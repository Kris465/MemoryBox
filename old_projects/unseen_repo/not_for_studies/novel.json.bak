Marriage is free, you can get married and divorced if you want. Itâs unreasonable for you to be throwing a tantrum like this.â\nâSheâs just a shrew. Why are you trying to reason with her?â The youngest sister of the Fang family was furious and yelled at her brother, âTake her and throw her out. There are so many people in our family. Are we going to let her trouble us like this?â\nThe two grown men looked at each other and both felt that it was not appropriate. They turned their eyes to the eldest brother, Fang Zhongcheng, who was shocked.\nThe one crying, making a scene, and then hanging herself was his wife, and her making a scene gave him a headache and made him feel ashamed. He wanted a divorce when he entered university, and now that he has graduated and been assigned a job, this matter cannot be put off any longer.\nâSnapped,â\nSeeing that no one could take the rope from the womanâs hand, she cried and made a scene, trying to wrap the rope around the beam. He raised his hand and slapped her hard, causing the woman to fall to the ground.\nâStop making a fuss. What are you making a fuss about? There are so many divorced people, but Iâve never seen anyone cry and act crazy like you. Just tell me, which man would want a shrew like you? And youâre saying itâs for the sake of the children. The children donât want a mother like youâ¦â\nâDad, Mom isnât moving.â\nThe woman fell to the ground after being slapped by him. It was just a simple slap, but he didnât care. He was venting his dissatisfaction there, and didnât notice that she had her eyes closed and didnât move at all. The two children called her, but she didnât respond at all.\nHearing his daughter talking, he finally stopped talking. Seeing that she was indeed motionless, he immediately panicked. No way, could a slap in the face kill someone?\nHe was stunned and stood there without moving. The second brother came to his senses and squatted forward. He reached out and felt the woman and found that she was still breathing. He patted her chest and looked up to tell his family that she was fine.\nâSheâs breathing and her heart is beating. Maybe he fainted from anger.â\nâNow what?â\nâIâll go get a bucket of cold water and splash it over her so she can wake up.â\nThe youngest sister ran to scoop up a bucket of cold water and splashed it on the womanâs face. She had been married to the eldest son of the Fang family for many years, but the family didnât consider her a member of the family at all.\nThe eldest son of the Fang family wanted to divorce her, and the whole family supported him. The sisters came together to persuade her, and their parents hid outside for fear of being labeled as bullies.\nLi Xia took a deep breath, shuddered, and opened her eyes. The scene before her confused her and she didnât know how to react. She was alone in the empty night, watching the TV in a daze. She had been suffering from insomnia for a long time and thought it would be another sleepless night, but what was going on now?\nâLook, sheâs awake now.â The younger sister was close enough to see clearly, and her words were extremely harsh. âI said this kind of woman is very lucky. She wonât die even if we torture her to death. Donât be afraid of her, brother. Take her to the Civil Affairs Bureau. Even a de-facto marriage needs to go through the divorce procedures, otherwise she will keep pestering us.â\nThe eldest brother sighed and looked at the mother and daughter on the ground with indifference. Li Xia, who had just woken up, turned her head and looked around. When she saw her seven-year-old daughter, she reached out and pulled the child to her.\nI havenât seen my daughter for a long time. Every time we meet, we either argue or are speechless. The child graduated from high school and went out to work. The daughter was so old but still refuses to get married. She tried talking to her, but it was useless. The child doesnât say anything and just looks at her with pity. Itâs as if sheâs asking, âAre you living a good life? Youâre not living a good life yourself, why do you want me to get married?â\nShe opened a breakfast shop in the county town. There were more people during the day, but it was empty after closing. Her daughter didnât want to quarrel with her and stayed away from home. Her son rarely came back after going to college in the city. Later, she found out that he had recognized Fang Zhongcheng as his father even after he abandoned them and hence the mother and son quarreled until their faces turned red and their necks became thick.\nâMother,â\nThe youngest son squatted beside them, and when he saw the mother and daughter hugging each other, he also came over. There was fear in the little guyâs black and white eyes. She had been very extreme these days, and she would go crazy at any time. Just now, she cried and wanted to hang herself. Both children were a little scared.\nâLi Xia, donât be crazy. No matter what you do, I will divorce you. I donât want you even if you hang yourself.â\nThe woman looked up at the man who was speaking, her eyes dark and shadowy. This was the man who had given her the oath for lifetime, lived with her for many years and had two children with her, divorced her after graduation from college, and abandoned her and her children.\nHe had a stable job and remarried to start a family, while she was a rural woman who had not even finished junior high school. She also had two children.\nHe had a leisurely job, but she worked hard from dawn to dusk and treated herself like a man. The children she raised with great effort were filial to her but would also avoid her. He does nothing, but his son still calls him father when he grows up.\nWhy is God so unfair? She worked so hard but at end she was lonely in her old age, and her daughter was also lonely and unwilling to get married. But he who abandoned his wife and children may have many children and grandchildren, and live happily with his wife. No, it shouldnât be like this.\nâLi Xia, speak up.â\nâDonât play dead.â The younger sister of the Fang family scolded: âYou were desperate just now, why are you playing dead now? Hurry up and go with my eldest brother to handle the formalities, take your two kids and get out of our Fang family.â\nâSnapped,â\nLi Xia let go of her daughter, stood up suddenly, and slapped her in the face. She had always scolded and threatened her the most, but this sudden slap stunned the girl. She covered her cheek and her eyes turned red instantly.\nâYou dare to hit me?â\nâIâm going to hit you.â\nThe five words landed loudly, but her state was completely different from before. She looked crazy just now, but now her words, actions and expressions were very calm.\nâIâll fightâ¦â\nThe girl was about to start a fight, but Li Xia grabbed her arm with her left hand and slapped her with her right hand. Seeing the man walking forward, she picked up the mirror on the table and threw it on the edge of the table.\nWith a snap, the mirror broke into pieces. She took the largest piece and held it in her hand. âWhoever dares to come over here, Iâll cut his neck.â\nThe stunned ones are afraid of the aggressive ones, and the aggressive ones are afraid of the desperate ones. When she did this, the whole family retreated, and the eldest brother Fang Zhongcheng sat down on the bunk bed behind him. He waved his hands and looked panicked. It turned out that the panic caused by hurting oneself and hurting others was different. The family was full of disgust just now, but now they were all pale with fear. They dared not open their mouths to insult casually anymore.\nâLi Xia, donât be like thisâ¦â\nâYes, put the glass down first. We can discuss anything. Donât get too aggressive right away.â\nâYes, put it down. Letâs sit down and discuss it.â\nThe most weakest one was dragged by Li Xia and dared not say a word. The two children were also scared and hid aside. The daughter wanted to go to her, but was pulled back by Fang Zhongcheng.\nLi Xia sneered, holding the glass in her right hand and grabbing the youngest daughter of the Fang family with her left hand. She thought to herself, she made a mistake once, and was bullied and ridiculed by them. Now she got a new chance, will she still be bullied by them again?\nâWhat do you want to discussing?â\nThose three men almost tripped, and you were crying and making a fuss, wanting to commit suicide and kill people. Donât you know what to discuss?\nThe two younger brothers of the Fang family turned around to look at their eldest brother, and Fang Zhongcheng spoke gently: âLetâs discuss, discuss our divorce.â\nThis time, Li Xia sneered and sat down on the chair. âTalk.â\nShe was willing to sit down and talk properly, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The younger sister who was released had her wrists bruised by the pulling, but seeing her sit down and pour herself some water as if nothing had happened, she pointed at her and yelled.\nâShe just hit me and my hand. Look what happened to me. Are you just going to let her go?â\nThe men looked at each other in dismay. If they let it go, it would seem like they were incompetent. If they didnât, they were afraid that Li Xia would start making trouble again. Even if they called the police, it would be a family matter. If they criticized and educated her and then let her go, it would probably be even more difficult to deal with her.\nLi Xia lived for several decades in her previous life, so she could see this clearly. She was sure that they couldnât do anything to her, so she took the opportunity to vent her anger.\nIn the family, this sister-in-law was the most troublemaking and scolded her the most harshly. In her previous life, she was concerned about her husband and didnât want to divorce him. In this life, she has made up her mind to divorce, and didnât care about anyone.\nâHave you made up your mind? Should we rush in and have a fight, or should we sit down and discuss it?â\nThese words, coupled with her contemptuous look, made the three brothers lose their breath. Fight? She had been doing farm work for many years and was very strong. She looked angry and ready to fight with others. Who dared to fight with her? Those who are barefoot are not afraid of those who wear shoes. They also wear shoes and dare not confront others head-on.\nâLetâs talk.â\nFang Zhongcheng said calmly, thinking that you are the rubble and we are the porcelain, so we wonât be tough with you. I was just trying to get you to agree to a divorce, and now that you have agreed, thatâs just what I want. As for the younger sister who was beaten, itâs not a big deal if she didnât get hurt.\nThe brothers all backed off, and Fang Xiaomei, who had been beaten, had no choice but to do nothing. She had looked down on Li Xia and ridiculed her before, but now she could do nothing about it even though she had bitten her lips until they were broken. She couldnât beat Li Xia, and if the brothers didnât help, she would just get beaten.\nThe two parties sat down to discuss, but there was actually nothing to discuss. There were only two thatched houses in the countryside, and the annual income was only enough to feed and cloth them, so there was nothing to divide.\nFang Zhongcheng was about to speak, but Li Xia spoke first: âWhat happened to me just now?â\nThe Fang brothers looked at each other, and then the younger sister Fang said, âYou were so noisy at home, and my eldest brother hit you just to save your dignity. Who knew you were so weak that you fainted on the ground.â\nOkay, itâs good to know the reason. Li Xiaâs expression remained unchanged, she quickly stood up and slapped Fang Zhongcheng. The manâs eyes were red from being slapped, and he wanted to fight in anger, but Li Xia raised her hand and grabbed his arm.\nâIf you donât want a divorce, go ahead and slap me. Iâm not in a hurry anyway.â\nThe woman had an expression that she was not at a disadvantage. The Fang family had no way to deal with her at this time. They could still ridicule and despise her just now, but now they were strangled by her step by step and could only follow her rhythm. They couldnât even fight back after being beaten.\nâI have saved five dollars. I will give it all to you so that you can go home and buy a ticket. You must take the children and leave immediately.â\nLi Xia sneered: âYouâre sending me away with five dollars?â\nIf it was in her previous life, she would have been cold-hearted and wanted nothing. But she is no longer a woman in her twenties. She has experienced the beatings of society and is no longer naive.\nâYou want moreâ¦â\nâShut up, or Iâll tear your skin apart.â\nFang Xiaomei actually dared to interrupt, and glared at Li Xia after being confronted. She was not afraid unless she took action, and when she saw Li Xia was about to stand up and raise her hand, she screamed and ran out of the room quickly.\nShe is not capable, but she deserves a beating. If you refuse the favor given by her, donât blame hee for beating you. After beating her, Li Xia swept her eyes over the three brothers. The two brothers-in-law stepped back subconsciously and dared not say anything.\nâThirty. Thatâs all I have. Iâll give it all to you.â\nLi Xia knew he wouldnât have much money because he hadnât started working yet. She looked at him without saying anything or taking the money, her eyes moving between the two children.\nâThirty is thirty. But what about the two children? What are you going to do?â\nAfter he was admitted to university, she gave birth to her second child. At that time, people were worried about this day. After the birth of the child, an educated youth who did not pass the college entrance examination and had not left helped her name the second child Ruyi.\nPersistence, consistency. This implication, now she heard it was ironic. This child was smart, clever, and good at talking, she liked him very much. But now she wondered if she should leave him with his father? He longed for his father so much, wouldnât he be happier with his father?\nFang Zhongcheng looked at his two children, his heart was in turmoil. She was the one who took care of the children, so he was a little unfamiliar with them. When he heard her talking about this topic, his daughter ran to hug her arm. His son stood beside him, looking around with a confused look.\nSeeing that he didnât say anything, Li Xia said, âThe daughter is mine, and the son is yours. Weâll break up now, and weâll each raise one child. Thereâs no need to talk about child support.â\nIn fact, in her previous life, she raised two children by herself, and he never gave her any child support. When she saw this term on TV, she was still laughing, not knowing whether she was laughing at herself for being silly or stupid.\nâMother,â\nThe little guy ran to his mother and grabbed the corner of her clothes. Li Xia looked at her sonâs tender face and felt mixed emotions.\nIt was as if she saw him growing up, from a cute little boy to a handsome young man. From elementary school to junior high school to high school, he ranked among the top and became the top scorer in science at No. 1 Middle School. She was invited to the stage as a mother to give a speech, and she was radiant with light because of her son among the thousands of people.\nThe child who brought her glory also hurt her from head to toe. âHe is my father, he should support my education, canât you just relax a little?â\nFor more than ten years, he never showed up. I was the one who was with him when he was sick, sad, when he studied ,Â  when he needed tuition, and took care of all aspects of his life. Finally, he told me that he was his father, accepted his compensation, and called him dad.\n",

Her son had been a good student since he was young, and boys naturally yearn for their fathers, so let him follow his father.\n　　”I can’t raise two children, so Ruyi will follow you.”\n　　Fang Zhongcheng was stunned when he heard this. This arrangement was beyond his expectations. He knew how much she loved their children, but he didn’t expect that she didn’t want a son even though they were getting divorced.\n　　He just graduated, and his mother said yesterday that she would find him a good family girl to start a new family. If he had a child, would that be smooth? But looking at her, it seemed like she had planned it. If he didn’t agree…\n　　”The child is not mine alone. You, as a father, cannot completely shirk this responsibility. If you don’t want to, then the three of us will stay. It is a man’s responsibility to support the family and take care of his wife and children. You won’t just pull up your pants and do nothing, right?”\n　　”I,”\n　　Fang Zhongcheng’s face turned pale and blue at her words, and he looked down on her out of anger. “Look at you, you’re even more vulgar than a foot-picking man. You said such rubbish in front of your brother-in-law, are you still a woman? With someone like you, which man would be willing to live with you?”\n　　Li Xia sneered, “You thought it was hopeless to return to the city, so you came to live with me, so that you could carry on the family line and have someone to wash clothes and cook for you. Now that you have returned to the city, you abandon your wife and children and are irresponsible. You find a new wife to live with. I am just uneducated, but your character is worse than a toilet.”\n　　”you,”\n　　Fang Zhongcheng stood up angrily, raised his finger and pointed at her, panting. Li Xia rolled her eyes and stood still, watching him trembling with anger, and the resentment in her heart finally dissipated.\n　　She finally let out the anger she hadn’t gotten out in her previous life. When you don’t care about someone, you can speak without restraint. In her previous life, she was bullied by him until her tears dried up, but she was still laughed at. She had thought about this for many years, and pondered it over and over for a long time.\n　　”Either you pay the child support for both children until they reach adulthood, or we pay one child each. It doesn’t make sense that you can take off your pants and enjoy yourself, while I have to work hard for the rest of my life to raise your children.”\n　　Her own flesh and blood, born after ten months of pregnancy and twelve broken ribs. She loved her children , but the children were not hers alone.\n　　”That’s my dad, he should be responsible for me. He spent money to support my education, so you can relax. Why don’t you want him to share the burden? Why do you have to work so hard? You get up early and stay up late, and your back is bent. Mom, can’t you see the white hair on your head? How much older are you than your peers?”\n　　Her son from her previous life called out to her, and she felt anxious and distressed. Her heart suddenly ached again. What should she say? After going through the most difficult days in her life, she didn’t want any candy from anyone, especially the man who abandoned them when she was in the most difficult time.\n　　If the blood relationship between father and son cannot be broken, then take him when the time is most difficult, don’t just think about picking up the ready-made one. We all can endure the hard times together, she suffered all her life, but still noone  understood her in the end.\n　　Now that she is divorced, she is more clean-headed than she should be. If she continues to take the two children with her as she did in her previous life, the three of them will suffer together. She is under the pressure of life and her children do not like their mother, and she does not like herself like that either.\n　　”You woman, you don’t even want your own child, how good is your character?”\n　　”…The responsibility is equally shared. Where did I go wrong?”\n　　Li Xia calmed down for a while before asking this question. She was so angry that she almost jumped up and had a fight with him. In her previous life, she still missed him and cried just to keep him and save her marriage. In this life, she just wanted to separate and divorce. Her hands were clenched tightly, and her nails dug into her flesh. The pain reminded her what her purpose was.\n　　Her clear words silenced the three brothers. Divorce is about the division of property and child support. There is nothing wrong with what they said. You are a father. If you dare to say that you don’t want either child and won’t pay a penny for child support, you are slapping yourself in the face and being irresponsible. Such a statement is not allowed by law or morality.\n　　Fang Zhongcheng looked at her silently, his eyes and heart full of scrutiny. Her series of actions after waking up were beyond his expectations. It seemed that she didn’t care about him at all and wanted to cut off all ties with him immediately. Could it be that because she had a problem with him, she didn’t want her son anymore?\n　　”My son, Didn’t I left home to go to school when he was born, and you brought him up by yourself. Are you really willing to give him to me?”\n　　”That’s your son.”\n　　Li Xia was helpless. It took her a lifetime to understand this truth. The child was theirs. He was not a cat or a dog. He had his own thoughts. Moreover, father and son were not only related by blood, but also had a legal obligation to raise and support him. She could not raise him alone just by working herself to death.\n　　She really wanted to let him go, and Fang Zhongcheng felt that he had miscalculated. No one in the room spoke anymore, leaving only the sound of everyone’s gentle breathing.\n　　Li Xia reminded herself to keep calm and give him time to think about it. They had been together for many years and they knew each other well. He should have expected that she would not want to give up the child, while he wanted to be free and easy. Now her change had thrown him off balance.\n　　The hour hand reached eleven, and the aroma of cooking wafted in from outside. It was almost noon, and because of her sudden calmness, the neighbors who were watching the excitement outside also dispersed, leaving only a few gossipy people watching from afar.\n　　”Have you discussed it?”\n　　The old couple of the Fang family came back, and the old lady asked her son. The daughter-in-law was crying and making a fuss before, but now she is quiet. She didn’t know if he has managed her. She looks reasonable.\n　　”She said she agrees to the divorce, but we should take one child each.”\n　　”How can a mother not want a child?”\n　　”So the child is the mother’s alone? You gave birth to and raised all these children in your family by yourself?”\n　　Suddenly, the old lady was speechless with calm and rational words. Take it when you need it, and leave it when you don’t? Men enjoy themselves for a while, and women take care of them for the rest of their lives. Women shoulder the heavy responsibility alone, and you will recognize them when they grow up?\n　　She also hoped that the child was hers alone, but the fact was that it was impossible. His blood flowed in his body, and this was an unchangeable fact.\n　　”Li Xia, please think about this again. You have been taking care of the child since birth. Can the child adapt to being left behind so suddenly? As a mother, you have to think about the child. Wouldn’t you feel bad if the child gets sick?”\n　　”If you don’t want to raise the child yourself, just pay the child support in one lump sum. I’ll take the child with me, and I’ll leave right now. I’ll raise my child, and I won’t shirk my responsibilities.”\n　　”I, I’m not shirking my responsibility. It’s just that I still live in the dormitory. How can I take care of the child?”\n　　”Then how do you say we should solve this problem? Ever since you started school, I’ve been the only one working to support the three of us. I borrowed the ticket to get out this time, and I still owe money to the brigade. As the head of the family and the father of the child, I can’t do anything if you want to divorce me, after all, the country also stipulates freedom of marriage. But you have to solve the problem of the child.”\n　　It’s steady and well-reasoned. As a father, you have neglected your children for several years. Are you just going to divorce her and abandon your wife and children and be done with it, without taking any responsibility?\n　　Such calm and reasonable reasoning may not work for scoundrels, but it is very effective for hypocrites like Fang Zhongcheng. She was too stupid in her previous life and didn’t understand anything. She only thought about raising her child, and she almost exhausted herself to death for decades.\n　　”Divorce is normal, but isn’t it unreasonable to ignore the children? The work points a woman earns in the countryside are at most enough for her own food and drink, how can she support two children?”\n　　”It’s a hard life for this woman too. It’s not easy.”\n　　”My mother’s family is from the countryside. If a woman wants to earn money to support her and her  children, she has to work like an animal. Look at her hand, it looks like there’s a cut on it. This is summer, who knows what would happen if it was winter.”\n　　”If you become capable, you will ignore your wife and children. Isn’t this Shameless?”\n　　When the neighbors heard her words, their attitude changed. At first, they laughed at her and looked down on her for being a vulgar, but now they all felt sorry for her. Once the man succeeded, she was abandoned. He didn’t even care about their children.\n　　The Fang family members were all very upset. Old Man Fang pushed his wife to cook. There were so many people watching, and the marriage hadn’t ended yet. Could you not let your daughter-in-law and grandchildren eat?\n　　The old lady had no choice but to scoop up the grain and go to the kitchen. Everyone stayed quiet, and the two children came in timidly to their mother. Seeing that she was not angry, the youngest son took out the candy in his pocket and gave it to her.\n　　”Mom, here.”\n　　When he called her in a baby voice, her heart softened. Her son, the son who had brought her infinite glory. She didn’t know what he was thinking.\n　　She can understand why he wanted to recognize the father who didn’t raise him that day. But at this time he was still a child, and his eyes were full of admiration when he looked at her.\n　　”Mom doesn’t want to eat, Yi Yi eat it by yourself.”\n　　The eldest daughter also gave her candy, and the two children snuggled up to her, one on each side. She couldn’t tell what she felt. She was so shocked that she couldn’t think too much.\n　　She ate lunch with the children without paying attention to others. Her stomach was growling and she was eager for food. The two children’s stomachs were also growling. She ate while feeding the children.\n　　The mother and her two children have been hungry for a day and have eaten too much. Her parents-in-law and their family are not happy with them, but if they want to drive them away, they have to solve the problem first. They have been dragging it out before, and now they want to get a divorce, but what about the children?\n　　After dinner, she coaxed the two children to sleep, and the family sat down to discuss, and they finally agreed to have one child each. In the afternoon, we went to the Civil Affairs Bureau to handle the formalities. The agreement clearly stated that each of them would raise one child, and each would bear the cost without the other paying child support. They both had visitation rights, and they could negotiate a time to see the children if they wanted to.\n　　”Bring Huihua to me quietly, don’t let Yi Yi know.”\n　　The man didn’t want to go through another crying child, so he nodded. She waited at the entrance of the alley, and he quickly brought her Huihua out. She held her daughter in one hand and her bag in the other, and the mother and daughter walked aimlessly.\n“Mom, where’s my brother?”\n　　The siblings usually eat and sleep together, and it is her daughter who takes care of her brother when she goes to work. She should explain this to her daughter now. But she is only seven years old. Can she understand what divorce means?\n　　First she found a corner where no one was around and squat in front of the child. “Mom and Dad are divorced. Do you know what divorce means?”\n　　The little girl’s eyes instantly filled with tears, and she nodded obediently. She threw himself into her arms, and imitated her by patting her back.\n　　”Don’t be sad, mom. I want you.”\n　　The child knows that she has been abandoned and wants to comfort her. The baby knows that if she goes home, there will only be a thatched house and coarse food, but still wants to follow her closely. They are just simply attached to their mother. She wished time would stay here forever. All the baby needs is the mother’s embrace and mother’s love.\n　　”Mom is alone,” she wanted to say that mom can’t raise two children, but she changed the subject after she said it. “Mom is not capable enough to let you all suffer with me. So I left your brother to your father. Your father will find a job soon. He has a stable job, which is better than mom’s. Your brother won’t suffer.”\n　　The little girl thought about it and nodded silently. Grandpa and grandma’s place is indeed better than her home. But no matter how good it is, there is no mother. Children without mothers are the most pitiful. But she didn’t say this because she knew her mother was too tired.\n　　After explaining everything to her daughter, she saw that it was getting dark. She took out the money and coupons from her pocket and counted them. She still had some money and food coupons. Her father had put them in her bag before she left, and she didn’t want to spend them during the journey.\n　　”Come on, mom will buy you something to eat.”\n　　”Mom, do you have any money or tickets?”\n　　”Yes.”\n　　The mother and daughter went to the canteen and bought a few steamed buns made of various grains, the cheapest food. She had a letter of introduction in her pocket, which could allow her to stay at a guest house, but she was reluctant to leave.\n　　The village will not be divided into households until next year, and even if the land is distributed, it will only be enough for the mother and daughter to eat. She wants to stay in the city and do a small business, which is better than living in the countryside. She has foresight to start over again, and she can’t be stupid enough to go home and farm again.\n　　The mother and daughter sat at the entrance of the alley, eating steamed bun with water. The weather in early summer was quite cold at night. She planned to cover her daughter with a thin cotton coat, and she would spend the night outside holding the child.\n",

When she came back, she found a place in the alley that was sheltered from the wind and took out her coat from her bag. As a result, when she opened it, many banknotes fell out. There were 1, 2, and 50 cents, and three one-yuan notes.\n　　She couldn’t hold back her tears, and while picking up the money she muttered, “Brother San, why are you so stupid? You stuffed all the money you’ve saved into my pocket.”\n　　”Mom, this must have been stuffed by my third uncle. I saw him sneaking into the house.”\n　　”Yes.” She wrapped her daughter in her coat and sat on the stone, hugging her. She remembered the kindness of her third brother. She was only one year older than her third brother, and he had protected her since she was a child.\n　　”Go to sleep, mom is here.”\n　　A few years old, a mother is everything for a child. She fell asleep quietly under the sound of her mother’s patting, and she was exhausted after a day of triuble.\n　　The child fell asleep, and Li Xia looked around. Two women wearing red sleeves came over, and she took out the letter of introduction. “The man doesn’t want us anymore, and we really have nowhere to go at night.”\n　　As a woman, she didn’t make things difficult for her. She just told her to return home as soon as possible and not wander around. “Okay just don’t wander around.”\n” Yes I won’t “\n　　Unlike later times, in this period, people without a place to live, a household registration, or a job were not allowed to sleep on the streets in the city, and the population could not move around freely. Li Xia exhaled silently, and began to feel troubled.\n　　She only had a few dollars in her pocket, and there was no room for her here. Why not go home first? She could come out in a few years when things are more open. She thought so rationally, but emotionally she didn’t want to leave.\n　　The future belongs to cities, and staying in the city will help you develop earlier. But the problem now is that she is a “no” person, so she can’t stay in the city for a few days even if she wants to.\n　　At night, she held her daughter against the wall and slept for a while. The next morning, the child woke up and came down obediently, saying that she would not let her hold her again no matter what. Her daughter felt sorry for her and knew that she was working hard. She smiled at her and endured the numbness in her legs.\n　　”Mom, are your legs numb from being pressed by me? Let me massage them for you.”\n　”Don’t, just let mom take it easy.”\n　　She had a bad temper when she was young, and she was often in a bad mood because of the stress and fatigue in her previous life. If she had a chance to do it again, she would try to be kind to her daughter. If the child is timid, she should talk to hrr nicely.\n　　” Okay”\n　　The girl waited obediently, waiting for the pain and numbness from the thousands of needles to pass and for her to stand up. She stamped her feet hard and took her daughter outside.\n　　There was a vendor selling breakfast outside the alley, simple soy milk buns, she bought two buns and didn’t want to buy soy milk. She silently calculated the value in her mind and estimated that there was a profit of 50 to 60 percent. The capital for small business was not large. She had opened a breakfast shop in her previous life, so doing these things was no problem.\n　　She quickly finished her breakfast and wandered around during the day looking for opportunities to stay. She asked people if anyone was looking for a babysitter, or someone who could look after children, the elderly, cook, or do housework.\n　　However, during this period, the population was growing rapidly, but the industry could not keep up. The city could not even find a job for unemployed young people, and there were even fewer families who needed nannies. The security in this area was even stricter, and as it was getting dark, she took her daughter back to the original place.\n　　After searching for a whole day without finding any place, she gave the half-baked steamed bread she had saved to her daughter at night. She put her coat on her and told her to eat quickly. “The water is still hot. If you are thirsty, drink a few more sips. Otherwise, it will get cold in a while.”\n　　”Mom you eat too.”\n　　”Mom is not hungry, you eat quickly.”\n　　”Mom, take a bite.”\n　　The mother was calm, so the little girl was a little bolder. Tentatively, Li Xia took the steamed bread, kissed her little girl’s face, and took a small bite.\n　　The child sat and ate obediently, and she stood up and looked around. She would not stay in the provincial capital for much time, and it would be extremely difficult for her to find a job with her child.\n　　Sitting there worrying at night, a person walked out of the alley. When she got closer, she saw it was an old lady, hunched over with a firm gaze, looking at the mother and daughter for a while.\n　　”Auntie, I…I have nowhere to go, so I’ll just stay here for one night and not disturb others.”\n　　”Do you want to stay in the provincial capital?”\n　　”You, your family needs a babysitter?”\n　　The old lady nodded and shook her head, then sighed and pointed to the alley. “Come on, let’s go to my home and talk.”\n　　”Why.”\n　　Someone invited her home, at worst she might be able to find an opportunity to save herself. So she led her daughter to follow quickly, and after turning left and right in the alley, she found that the big courtyard that the aunt entered was actually the one where Fang Zhongcheng’s family lived.\n　　There are several courtyards inside and outside. These were the houses of the landlords in the past. Now, the original appearance has been affected by illegal construction. In the next ten years, this place will be demolished.\n　　There were many forked paths in the courtyard, and Auntie was not in the same courtyard as the Fang family. When she arrived, she found that the routes were different, but the two courtyards were actually separated by only a wall. The Fang family lived in a small and cramped courtyard, but Auntie’s courtyard maintained its original appearance, a square courtyard.\n　　The aunt entered the main room, and she led her daughter to follow. The three main rooms were separated by partitions, with the living room in the middle and bedrooms on the east and west sides. The house was quite large, spacious and well-lit.\n　　The old lady did not arrange for them to sit down, but led her to open the door of the east room. Inside, there was a wardrobe, a bed, a dressing table, and a man lying on the bed.\n　　The man’s cheeks were sunken, and he didn’t move at all when they came in. The old lady brought two stools for them to sit on, and she sat on the bed herself. She stared at the man on the bed for a while, then turned to her and got straight to the point.\n　　”My son is in a vegetative after an accident. My daughter-in-law divorced him and left behind my grandson. We both the grandparent and grandchild, we depend on each other for survival. But, I won’t hide it from you. I have a disease and I won’t live long. I think…”\n　　”You want to hire me as a nanny to take care of you and your son? I can do that. I…”\n　　Li Xia didn’t think too much about it. She was just happy to find a job when the old lady waved her hand to interrupt her. She was confused, if you don’t want me to be a nanny, then why did you bring me back?\n　　”Will you marry my son?”\n　　No, your son is already in a  vegetative state, how can he marry a wife? Li Xia was very confused and didn’t understand what the old lady was thinking.\n　　”There are only three of us in this family. When I’m gone, you, an outsider, won’t be able to stay here. When you’re driven away, my son will be in this state, and my grandson will be so young… How are they going to live? They’ll be at the mercy of others.”\n　　Oh, the old lady has considered it very well. To hire a nanny, there must be a civil person in the family, otherwise how can a nanny be the head of the family? But she just got divorced, and if she married a vegetative person in order to stay? And she also has to raise a child?\n　　”Where’s your grandson?”\n　　”He’s playing in the west room.” The old lady smiled kindly when she mentioned her grandson. “He’s seven years old, a very good, smart and obedient child, when I told him to find a mother for him, he nodded in agreement, saying that he would listen to his mother.”\n　　”My son is 33 years old this year and used to work in the procuratorate ( agency responsible for legal prosecution and prosecutorial investigation) ….I… I don’t know if he can wake up, but I always hope that he can wake up. He is so young, how can he…”\n　　The old lady explained the situation, and Li Xia looked at the motionless man with mixed feelings. Seeing that she didn’t say anything, the old lady wiped her tears and continued to speak.\n　　”If you are willing to marry him and take care of him and his son, then this house will belong to you. I will find someone to help you and your daughter get a permanent residence.”\n　　What? Changing from rural to non-rural, Li Xia’s eyes lit up immediately. With the housing issues and household registration solved, the mother and daughter can stay here, and the child’s schooling will not be a problem.\n　　There were no private schools during this period, and if you wanted to go to school in the city, you had to have a household registration. She was most worried about her daughter’s schooling, but she also understood how difficult it was to change from a rural to a non-rural during this period. Even those educated youth who wanted to return to the city could only return by themselves, and the families who brought their wives and children back could not register their household registration. If you wanted to study in the city, you had to use connections to pay a large amount of tuition.\n　　Being a nanny was the first step for her to stay here. Now the conditions are much better than being a nanny. In the late 1980s, it was said that it was impossible to transfer\nhousehold registration from rural to non-rural status even if they gave 10,000 yuan.\n　　But if she married this man, she would have to consider supporting them. Maybe the family had no savings, and if the man lived for another ten or eight years, she would not only have to take care of him but also support them. This matter had to be legitimate, otherwise she would be driven away as soon as the old lady died.\n　　By raising the father and son, she got a household registration and a house. She paid a lot, but she also got a lot. These two things are hard to find in the city nowadays, and you may not be able to get them even if you have money, let alone she has no money.\n　　”Even if I marry your son, it won’t be that easy to get a household registration, right?”\n　　Seeing that she was moved, the old lady smiled and said, “My son was injured at work, and there is compensation for this kind of situation. We can arrange jobs for his family members, and settle their household registration and other issues.”\n　　Oh, so that’s how it is. In this era, there is a policy of replacing a job, and she has heard of this kind of thing. Although she doesn’t have this iron rice bowl job that everyone is fighting for now, she is very satisfied with getting a household registration and a house.\n　　”Can I see the child?”\n　　”Okay, wait.”\n　　The more cautious she was, the more reassured the old lady was. This was a responsible act, not a casual lie. The old lady shouted at the door, and soon a little boy came in. He was about the same height as Huihua, with gentle features, and looked at her a little timidly.\n　　”This is the new mother that grandma found for you, call her quickly.”\n　　The child’s lips moved, and he was obviously resisting the stranger, looking at her with scrutiny. Li Xia quickly spoke up: “No, no, don’t rush to let the child call. Well, just call me auntie.”\n　　This time the little guy nodded obediently: “Hello, Auntie.”\n　　”Hello. What’s your name and how old are you?”\n　　”My name is Shen Hui, I’m seven years old.”\n　　Shen Hui, why does this name sound so familiar? Li Xia thought about it and realized that she had seen this name in a newspaper news in her previous life. A murderer who committed manslaughter and murdered his mother had this name. He was seventeen years old in 1992, so the age was right.\n　　But the child in that case is the child of a single mother and has no father, so it’s just a coincidence, right?\n　　She was thinking about something, and the old lady looked at her with burning eyes. “My daughter, what do you think? I know it’s a heavy burden, but Huihui is getting older and older, and he can help take care of his father, so you don’t have to work so hard all the time.”\n　　The little guy nodded when he heard it, “I will take care of Dad.”\n　　The child is so sensible, it shouldn’t be difficult to raise him. “I’m responsible for taking care of them. Just feed them and keep them warm, right?”\n　　”Um.”\n　　”Okay, let’s do it this way.”\n　　It was settled, and thet would do it one by one tomorrow. The old lady got up to cook, and Li Xia quickly followed and said she would do it. She rolled out the noodles and made a pot of noodles. Everyone was very happy to eat. The old lady praised her for her delicious cooking. The little guy was pushed by his grandmother and nodded.\n　　When she learned that the two side rooms on the east side were also hers, Li Xia felt more comfortable. Without the old lady telling her, she went to fetch water to wash the man’s face and feet, and carefully asked the old lady what she needed to pay attention to in taking care of him.\n　　After talking to the old lady for a long time about the precautions for taking care of  the man, the mother and daughter were arranged to sleep in the west bedroom at night. After wandering for a long time, they could finally lie down and sleep peacefully. There were bedding, sheets, pillows and quilts. After washing up, they lay down steadily. The feeling of stretching made them sigh uncontrollably.\n　　”Mom, it’s so comfortable to sleep in bed.”\n　　”Well, go to bed quickly.”\n　　After all this, both mother and daughter were very tired and fell asleep quickly. The next day, Li Xia was awakened by her biological clock at dawn. She got up, dressed and cleaned the three main rooms. The old lady was usually quite clean, but she was no longer physically fit. With her at home, the family immediately became more lively.\n　　The old lady came in and saw her turning her son over in bed, then after a moment’s hesitation, she took off his clothes. It took a lot of effort for her to do this because she was old, but she turned him over without much effort. She wiped his back and turned him over again, dried the other side, and put on clean clothes for him.\n　　”It’s still early. I’ll go wash my clothes first. Can we make porridge for breakfast?”\n　　What a neat woman! The old lady nodded with a smile. “You do the laundry, and I’ll make breakfast.”\n　　”You can take a rest. I work very efficiently and won’t waste any time.”\n　　Li Xia is not just talking, she is really good at work. First she goes to the kitchen to turn on the stove and add water to the pot to cook porridge. After the water boils and the rice is added, she closes the air vent below, so that the fire becomes smaller, in this way coal is saved, and the pot will not explode. She used it when she ran a breakfast shop in her previous life.\n　　After cooking porridge on the fire, she went to the yard to wash clothes. A neighbor who had been watching the fun noticed her and asked her curiously why she was there.\n　　”From now on, she will be the daughter-in-law of our Shen family.”\n　　”What, your daughte-in-law?”\n　　The old lady happily announced the good news to the neighbors in the yard. Li Xia worked silently beside her, smiling whenever she met someone’s eyes. This happy event seemed strange to others, but it was indeed a happy event to her. From now on, she would settled down in the provincial capital. Her daughter can go to school in the provincial capital and start a business to make money. This is a great joy.\n　　The old lady became more and more excited as the crowd gathered around her. She wanted to establish Li Xia’s status, to let her support the family, and to let her stay here legitimately after her death.\n　　After breakfast, she took her to the Civil Affairs Bureau eagerly. They were the only strange among the couples. The staff came forward to ask about the situation and told them that this was not feasible.\n　　”Marriage requires the consent of both men and women, and both must be capable of talking. Old lady, your son has become a vegetative, so he is not eligible for marriage.”\n　　The old lady didn’t understand this. Li Xia lived in a small place in her previous life. She learned a lot of knowledge from TV and movies, so she didn’t understand much about this. Both of them were basically ignorant of the law. They thought that marriage was voluntary. The old lady immediately took Li Xia’s hand and asked.\n　　”She agreed. Is it not okay if she agreed? I agreed on behalf of my son’s. Is it not okay ?”\n",
    "4": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c4/\nCHAPTER 4\n　　”No. Marriage must be voluntary on the part of both men and women. Remember, it must be both men and women. They must be present in person and sign in person.”\n　　The staff patiently explained it again, but this time the old lady looked depressed, as if she had suffered a great blow. She tried hard to find a daughter-in-law who she thought was reliable, but was told that it was not possible.\n　　Li Xia helped her sit down aside. The old lady took a while to stand up again and found the staff to ask again: “What if we hold the wedding banquet at home?”\n　　”Holding a wedding?” Seeing the old lady nod, the female comrade continued: “We have no control over holding a wedding, it’s considered a de facto marriage. But your son…”\n　　”That’s fine.”\n　　The old lady dragged Li Xia away without waiting for her to finish. It didn’t matter if it was a de facto marriage and not registered. Li Xia had just thought about signing an agreement or something to see if it would be okay, but she didn’t expect the old lady to do this.\n　　It seems that the concept of de facto marriage was abolished in later generations. She is not sure when exactly, but it is certain that it has been recognized in the past decade. As for whether their situation is protected by law or not, she thinks it is not important. As long as they can register their mother and daughter, she is willing to support the father and son. If the man wakes up and recovers and is not willing to live with her, she will leave.\n　　The two of them immediately went to buy the ingredients, buying all the vegetables, oil, eggs, etc. listed in the food allowance. When they got home, Li Xia cooked, while the old lady went to inform relatives and friends.\n　　A sumptuous meal was prepared in the evening. A pair of brooches of the bride and groom were worn on the lapels of her and the man on the bed. A new red enamel basin was placed on the washbasin stand in the corner, with a brand new towel on it. The old lady also skillfully cut out red wedding characters and pasted them on the wardrobe and other things. As soon as you enter the room, you will feel the atmosphere of a wedding.\n　　The old lady introduced them to her one by one. The couple of her friends, a man who was a classmate and close friend of Shen Haiyang, and the rest were neighbors who got along well with her. Everyone suppressed their curiosity and didn’t ask her in person, but greeted her with a smile. Shen Haiyang’s close friend worked at the police station and had already privately told the old lady about the situation of registering for residence.\n　　It is difficult to change from an agricultural to a non-agricultural status, but Shen Haiyang was injured at work. In order to ensure that the worker can be taken care of, they let Li Xia and her daughter register their local household registration, and said that they could arrange a job for Li Xia. People turned a blind eye to de facto marriages, otherwise Shen Haiyang’s situation could not be settled.\n　　Li Xia nodded in agreement. She was satisfied that the most difficult household registration problem had been solved. After settling down in the city, she would be someone’s wife and a mother to a little kid. She would work hard in the future, as the burden was not light.\n　　The man looked at her with gentle and firm eyes. Having seen countless people, he felt that the old lady had good vision and that this person looked trustworthy. At least as long as his nephew was breathing and having a heartbeat, he would be well taken care of and not suffer.\n　　”What’s your name?”\n　　As soon as the man spoke in a bad tone, Li Xia stood up with a smile on her face. “My name is Li Xia, Uncle, you can call me Xiao Li or Xia.”\n　　The Uncke snorted coldly and pointed at the man on the bed. “He’s in a vegetative state. The doctor said he won’t wake up. Are you really willing to marry him?”\n　　” I am willing.”\n　　”Why? You look like you’re in your twenties, are you really going to live with a vegetative for the rest of your life? And you have to raise a child who’s only a few years old, don’t you feel humiliated or at a disadvantage? If you do this, your life will be ruined.”\n　　”i don’t hate it, and I don’t resent him either, I am happy with it.”\n　　In her previous life, she brought her two children with her and did not look for another one. In this life, she was nominally a daughter-in-law but actually a nanny, but what she got was a stable place to stay and a household registration for both herself and her daughter.\n       After the house was demolished, it would be enough for Shen Hui to marry a wife and she would just raise their children. As for her, she had nothing to fear after she had a new life and a household registration and could settle down in the city.\n　　”Why?”\n　　The woman followed up her husband’s question and asked again. Li Xia smiled and asked back, “Sister, what do you think a woman should look for in a husband?”\n　　”Needless to say. Marrying a man means having clothes and food, so of course you need someone to rely on.” The Aunt sneered and pointed at the man on the bed and Shen Hui: “One can’t move, and the other is so young. You are not looking for someone to rely on, but finding yourself two big burdens, and I don’t know how many years these burdens will drag you down. Tell me, what exactly are you planning as a wife?”\n　　” Haiyang’s aunt , ahem…” The old lady was anxious, her cheeks flushed with anger. Li Xia reached out and patted her on the back, handed her a glass of water to calm her down, and then she spoke up.\n　　”I married him. So that me and my daughter can have a place to live, and my daughter can go to school in the city. Oh, by the way, it seems that the company can also help arrange a job for me. There are so many benefits, are you thinking about it too, auntie? “\n　　”I, why should I worry about it? It’s not my benefit.”\n　　”Well, you have to be someone’s wife.”\n　　You are mocking me for doing it for the benefit, I am doing it for the benefit. Why are you so anxious to stop me? What are you planning? Outsiders cannot be in charge of the family. You can just wait until the old lady dies so that you can manipulate them. What is the purpose? No one needs to tell me.\n　　”Well, it’s actually pretty good. The mother and daughter have a place to stay in the city, and Haiyang has someone to take care of him. Haiyang’s mother is relieved too, it’s good then.”\n　　The neighbors laughed and everyone became happy. Seeing that another lively was unhappy during the whole meal. After the meal, the neighbors left first and introduced their home to Li Xia, asking her to visit more when she had time.\n　　”A distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor. We will all live together in the future. If there is anything, just call us.”\n　　The two neighboring ladies were full of pity, thinking that a woman in her prime had her life wasted like this. She had to be a widow and take care of a vegetative patient to support them.\n　　”Okay, thank you, Auntie.”\n　　Li Xia saw the guests off, and after the neighbor left, then classmate of Shen Haiyang came to the door. “Li Xia, are you really willing to do this or not?”\n　　”I am 100% willingly.”\n　　”In Haiyang’s case, the doctor said he will never wake up. But we don’t know how long he will remain in a vegetative state. If it lasts ten or twenty years, it will be very difficult for you to take care of him and his son. You will waste the best years of your life.”\n　　”It’s okay. I know what it will cost me to do this.”\n　　Li Xia smiled sincerely. She had received so many benefits, so of course she had to take good care of others. “I can’t do other things, but I can take care of people. You are welcome to visit your friend at home more often in the future. I will cook some snacks for you. You two can sit and chat. The doctor said it’s better to talk to him more, but I’m not good at talking.”\n　　This was a welcome for his supervision. The man nodded with a smile: “I will handle the household registration for you and your daughter as soon as possible. You send the relocation permit back and ask your family to ask the brigade to stamp it. I will take care of the rest.”\n　　”Thank you very much.”\n　　The man left after he finished speaking. Li Xia shook her head and laughed. She married a vegetative man and had a burden. Everyone must feel sorry for her. In fact, it was nothing. They both got what they needed. She knew how to live in the future. She cleared the table and went to the west room to turn Shen Haiyang over and give him a massage. She asked her daughter to sit on the stool and talk with him.\n　　”Mom, are we going to live here from now on? No one will chase us away, right? If we don’t go back to our hometown, grandma and grandpa will be worried.”\n　　”Yes. We will live here in the future, and no one can drive us away legitimately. Mom can write a letter to tell grandma and grandpa, and they won’t worry anymore.”\n　　Seeing her daughter was timid, she continued to reassure her. If she remarried, the child would definitely feel uneasy because she would feel like a burden.\n　　”Don’t be afraid. Mom will take you wherever she goes. You and Mom will always be together.”\n　　”Well, I’m not afraid when my mother is around.”\n　　The child nodded and thought of her brother, but she knew that this was an adult matter and she couldn’t do anything about it. She didn’t dare to go and see her brother, nor did she dare to say anything for fear of adding to her mother’s burden.\n　　As the mother and daughter were talking, the voices in the west room became louder and louder. She could hear everything clearly with the door open. The uncle and aunt were trying to persuade the old lady, but they were probably angry because they couldn’t persuade her.\n　　”Once you die, that Li Xia will torture Haiyang to death and this house will be hers. As a stepmother, she would even bully Huihui. Why are you so stupid? She did it for the house. For the benefit that Haiyang got at the cost of his life.”\n　　”I’m happy to do so.” The old lady’s three words made them gasp for air and unable to speak for a long time. Then the old lady continued: “Return the money to him. I have already cut off all ties with him. I know what you are up to, but I’m telling you it’s impossible. Don’t think of using Haiyang to make money.”\n　　”Sister-in-law, what are you doing? Your brother sincerely…”\n　　”Get lost “\n　　The old lady chased them away when they were mentioned. In fact, she had not interacted with them much in the early years. But now her life is coming to an end, her son is like that, and her grandson is still young. She must find a reliable person for them.\n　　Otherwise, she would die without closing her eyes. This treacherous couple are already looking at their home as if it were a big pie, waiting for her to close her eyes so they could manipulate them.\n　　He is Shen Haiyang’s uncle. If she dies, these people will be the head of this family. Friends, nannies, and any other relationships are not as reliable as this family’s mistress. However, this mistress was not easy to find. She took a lot of effort to find Li Xia.\n　　A job offer, a household transfer, a house, and the money that person mailed. There were so many temptations, and none of them was small. She knew they had been eyeing them for a long time. So she forced herself to find a wife for her son, and fortunately she found one. Otherwise, once she died, her brother would have used them to get all these.\n　　City people have a household registration, the government will arrange jobs for them, and they have houses at home. It is impossible to attract city women to marry here. Even rural women find it difficult to come here, after all, the burden is too heavy. Women have to sacrifice their youth and years for the rest of their lives, and it is not worth it to go to the city. The uncle and aunt thought that the old lady would definitely not be find a wife, but they didn’t expect that there would be a fool who jumped into this fire pit.\n　　”Hey, if my niece-in-law finds out about the money, will she come and ask for it from us?”\n　　The woman asked from the back of the bicycle, while the man sighed as he pedaled. “Where did the old lady find such a woman? She looks quite powerful. There was one vegetative patient, one dying, and one so young in this family, and now there’s a niece-in-law like this, what else can we do?”\n　　”What was that woman thinking, marrying a vegetative just for a place to live. This time, your brother will definitely come here first when he comes back. Compared with his son and daughter-in-law, your cousin has to take a back seat.”\n　　”You damned old woman, if you want to die, go ahead and die, but you brought another woman like this into the family. I promised to find a job for my nephew, but now this woman has taken it all. How can I explain this to my sister?\n　　This woman is also stupid. Just a few rooms, but she sacrificed her whole life. Shen Haiyang will be vegetative for more than ten or twenty years, and she has to support the father and son. This deal will lose a lot of money. I’ll wait and see how she cries later then. “\n　　”Do you think Li Xia will wait until the old woman dies before starving or freezing your nephew to death? There are many ways to die. Then she can get a house for free. If the little brats bully her, she will take care of him too.”\n　　”She’s dreaming. I’ll keep an eye on her every day and I won’t let her take our Shen family’s things for free.”\n",

Originally, the old lady took care of Shen Haiyang at night, but now it was her turn. It was quiet at night. She checked the urine bag and sat on a chair beside it.\n　　She looked at this man quietly under the light. He had his eyes tightly closed so she couldn’t see what they looked like. She could only see that he had thick eyebrows, a high nose bridge, and thin lips that were very handsome, giving people a very gentle feeling. This man was quite good-looking, but it was a pity that he didn’t have any reaction now.\n　　This was her wedding night, and people outside didn’t know whether to pity her or laugh at her. But Li Xia was very happy. It was so good. She could make her own decision and do whatever she wanted.\n　　She reached out and poked his cheek playfully: “I will take care of you from now on, don’t be shy. We are having a wedding today, you can treat me as your wife or as your nurse. You can’t choose now, this is your mother’s choice, if you can get better, you can make the decision for yourself then, I am a reasonable person, I won’t blackmail you.”\n　　Of course the man on the bed didn’t react. She fetched some water, washed a towel, wiped his face, and shaved. “Such a handsome man, but he doesn’t grow any weight if he doesn’t move. He’s too skinny.”\n　　She cleaned up for him cheerfully, took off her short-sleeved shirt and wore only the vest inside to sleep on the single bed next to him. With her coming, the originally lifeless main room began to be revitalized, the windows were cleaned and the kitchen was filled with the aroma of food on time. The bedding and winter clothes were washed and hung in the yard, a lively scene.\n　　Little Shen Hui helped her get the basin. After a moment’s pause, he looked around and shouted, “Mom, here’s the basin for you.”\n　　The child suddenly spoke, and she was stunned for a moment before she smiled and said, ” Good Boy, play with your sister.”\n　　The child looked back at his grandmother, who smiled at him. He turned around and asked Huihua to play with him. He was born in the first month of the year and Huihua was born in the twelfth month. Although the two children were the same age, he was actually almost a year older than Huihua.\n　　The neighbors all changed their ways after seeing the child, and smiled at the old lady. This family is also pitiful. The son was injured at work and became a vegetative, and the daughter-in-law divorced and left without even wanting the child. There are three a elderly and weak, a disabled, and small child in their family. Fortunately, this woman came now…\n　　Thinking of this, the neighbors began to look at Li Xia with pity. Although she had settled down in the city, the burden was too heavy. A woman taking care of a comatose husband and two children, life would be difficult in the future. With a salary of about 20 yuan a month, it was hard for her to make ends meet.\n　　Li Xia felt that the neighbors in the courtyard were all very kind, and she didn’t know that everyone was pitying her. Some people were gloating and watching the joke. In the afternoon, when she went to buy vegetables, she met Fang’s younger sister and Fang Ruyi in the alley. The child looked listless, but when he raised his head and saw them, he ran over quickly.\n　　”Mom, sister,”\n　　The child ran towards them, yelling, and hugged her thighs. He was excited at first, but suddenly tears fell when he saw her face.\n　　”Mom, where have you been? Why didn’t you take me with you? Mom and grandma said you didn’t want me anymore. She lied to me, didn’t she?”\n　　Li Xia squatted down to wipe the tears of the child. They would live in a large compound in the same area in the future, and the child would see her often. When she was just reborn, her mind was full of the words her son yelled at her. She had to work hard to force herself to rationally break up this marriage.\n　　Although the son lives with his father after the divorce, she is the mother. No matter what disagreements she has with her son, she never forgets that she brought the child into this world. She has a responsibility to the child.\n　　Now, facing the child’s tender little face, she has to remind herself to be rational every time. Don’t act rashly, which will hurt herself and the child in the end.\n　　”Your mother remarried and doesn’t want you anymore. I’ve told you several times…”\n　　”Shut up.”\n　　The youngest sister of the Fang family was interrupted by her viciously, she reached out to hug her son, and then said to his little face: “Dad and mom are separated, sister follows mom, and Yi Yi follows dad. Do you understand what I mean?”\n　　She didn’t expect a three or four-year-old to understand, but since things had come to this point, she would try her best to explain it in words that he might understand.\n　　”Can’t I stay with my mother when we are apart?”\n　　”Mom is with your sister, and you are a boy so you follow your father. Didn’t you say you wanted to learn how to write? You can ask your father to teach you. Dad is a college student, and you always miss him, don’t you?”\n　”me …. I want to…Okay, I’ll let dad raise me.”\n　　The child pursed his lips in grievance, looking so pitiful. The younger sister of the Fang family curled her lips in disdain and whispered, “You married a vegetative person just to stay in the city. I knew you are a vain woman. Humph, so what if you stay? Shen Haiyang was a cadre before, so what? Now you have to take care of a vegetative person for the rest of your life and live as a widow. How pitiful.”\n　　The woman muttered to herself and came over to take the child away. He followed his aunt for a few steps and looked back at his mother and sister. When they were buying vegetables at the vegetable store, he ran over and held her hand.\n　　”Can I come to you if I miss my mom?”\n　　”……you can.”\n　　On the way home to cook, she saw the younger sister of the Fang family holding the child’s hand and turning away from her. She remembered that in her previous life, she was raising two children by herself and had little affection for them. She was too tired to work hard from dawn to dusk, and all her patience and tenderness were exhausted under extreme fatigue.\n　　She would hit and yell at them, and her daughter was naturally timid and afraid of her. Her son was bolder and would hide from her when he gets into trouble. She herself has a hard life, and probably in the minds of her children, their mother is also scary, and had zero communication with them.\n　　She kept nagging her daughter for urging her to get married, but her daughter went far away to work. After her son went to college, he often bought her things, but he basically had nothing to say to her. The two children looked at her with annoyance, pity and heartache.\n　　She wanted to be a good mother and start over with gentleness towards her children. To speak well, she had to feel safe and calm herself.\n　　”Xia, what are we having for dinner?”\n　　The old lady came out to ask, and she quickly reached out to support her. Perhaps because she had arranged her marriage, the old lady suddenly looked much older and was not as energetic as before.\n　　”I’ll make porridge tonight. I bought some potatoes and made some mashed potatoes for you. They’re soft and suitable for you to eat.”\n　　”What’s a mashed potatoes?”\n　　”Just peel the potatoes, grate them, coat them with flour, and steam them in a pot. After steaming for five or six minutes, stir-fry them with your favorite vegetables. This will make the potatoes soft and have a little bit of sweetness. Can I stir-fry them with spinach and tomatoes for you?”\n\n\n\n\n“Okay.” The old lady smiled, looked to her left at Huihua, who was obediently serving as her walking stick, and smiled kindly at the child. She took out two candies from her pocket, one for each of her and Shen Hui. She looked up and said to Li Xia.\n　　”The child can just stay with me in the yard, you go and cook.”\n　　”Okay.” Li Xia responded, turned around and smiled at the two children, “Be good and help grandma run errands. Call mom if you need anything.”\n　　”Okay”\n　　There was an old lady and two children in the yard, and she went into the house to cook. She heard the old lady outside talking to the little ones, asking them what they liked to eat, what they liked to play, what they used to do at home, how they lived, etc.\n　　The old lady liked the potatoes cooked this way for dinner. After dinner, Li Xia brought her some water. She washed up, took her medicine, and went to bed. The old lady lay down, held her hand, and talked to her.\n　　”Li Xia is so filial, who wouldn’t envy me when seeing this? Huihui is also well-behaved, I told him to listen to you, I’ll leave the father and son to you in the future…”\n　　The old woman fell asleep mumblingly. She went out and closed the door. When she returned to her bedroom, her daughter smiled happily at her. “Mom, I washed my feet myself. I changed the water for you to clean. You wash up and we go to bed.”\n　　She bent down and kissed the child: “Good girl, mommy’s good baby.”\n　　Mom is very different now. In her memory, she always missed Dad. She got angry when Dad ignored her and was not nice to them. Now she knows that she has moved to a new home. The new dad can’t do anything when he lies in bed, but he won’t get angry or scold Mom. Mom has become much gentler, which makes her feel safe.\n　　Lying on the bed, she secretly looked at my mother, hoping that she would always be so gentle. In that case, it would not matter if there was no such a good house, such good bedding and food.\n　　After she washed up and lay down on the bed, her daughter crawled into her bed. The little girl saw her brother today. The two children exchanged glances when the adults were not looking, and they were particularly excited tonight.\n　　”Mom, can I play with my brother later?”\n　　”sure.”\n　　”My brother can come to our place, too? I can go to grandma’s house to see him, too?”\n　　”I haven’t asked the grandmother here for her opinion, and if you go over there…”\n　　”Then I’ll make an agreement with my brother next time so we can play together outside. My brother also said I can play with him.”\n　　”Okay. Be safe when you play outside.”\n　　”Oh yeah.”\n　　Looking at her daughter’s excited and red face, she lowered her head and kissed her baby. The child was sensible since she was young. After her divorce , she raised them alone. In order to work more, she often came home in the dark. The child learned to cook, wash clothes, and play with her younger brother at a young age.\n　　”You want to be with your brother?”\n　　The little girl looked up at her when she heard that. Seeing that she was still smiling, she spoke: “I miss my brother. Mom, will this cause you trouble? You don’t want a brother anymore, right?”\n　　”It won’t cause any trouble to mom. Just play with your brother if you like.”\n　　”Oh, that’s nice.”\n　　The little girl clapped her hands excitedly and laughed happily. She fell asleep in the patting of her mother. The child was obviously more lively than before. Li Xia looked around and was really glad to be able to stay in the city.\n　　She was such a considerate daughter to her. In her previous life, she knew she was tired and helped her with everything. When she failed to get into high school, she started to help her earn money to share the pressure of life. She always felt sorry for her as a mother. If she could do it again, she would make her daughter happy and live a more relaxed life. Her daughter’s academic performance was not very good, so she would find a way to let her choose another path.\n　　Lying on the bed, she silently looked at the window reflecting the moonlight, her heart was in turmoil as she made plans for the future. She had no money and her family had old and young and there was one lying in bed, so she couldn’t go south to sell goods. So she can start a small business first, getting up early to sell breakfast.\n　　She can make fried dough sticks, steamed buns, and soy milk. Nowadays, few people make these things, so as long as they can sell them, they don’t have to worry about making money. And she can make a lot of money doing this, so she has no intention of getting a stable job.\n　　Thinking about her worries, she quickly fell asleep. The next day was another busy day. The old lady suddenly became distracted and confused. She quickly found a flatbed cart to send her to the hospital. After the doctor examined her, he shook his head and said that it was too late to save her.\n　　The old lady woke up on the hospital bed and knew her condition very well. She insisted on not staying in the hospital and let her take her home. When she entered the house, she took out a box from the cupboard and handed it to her.\n　　”Mom, what are you doing…”\n　　”I’m going to transfer the food and beverage tickets, the grain tickets, the cash, the property certificates… I’m handing all my belongings over to you, please keep them safe. Don’t send me to the hospital anymore, it’s a waste of money. If I can’t make it, I’ll die on the kang at home.”\n　　”Don’t say that. You’re still strong.”\n　　To reassure the old lady, she went to the kitchen and cooked a bowl of dragon beard noodles. The old lady ate two mouthfuls from her small bowl and stopped eating. Upon hearing the news, the neighbors came in to visit.\n\n\n\n　　The old lady was weak all over and her spirit was scattered all of a sudden. Li Xia chatted with everyone for a few minutes, and after seeing the guests off, she told her children to stay home with their grandmother.\n　　”Where are you going, Mom?”\n　　”Mom has something to do.”\n　　She made old clothes from scraps of cloth. There were no ready-made ones for sale at that time, and she would be late when the old lady died. She went to the department store twice and bought everything she needed. She was busy making them at home. Fortunately, she had a sewing machine, so she made them quickly. The old lady had only prepared a cotton jacket for the outside, and she hurriedly made the underwear and cotton pants.\n　　The old lady’s condition took a turn for the worse, and she was busy taking care of the patient at home. The two children were very sensible and helped her pass things. After dinner, she gave the man a massage in the house, and when she went out of the kitchen, she found that the pots and bowls had been washed.\n　　”Huihua, did you wash the pots and dishes?”\n　　The little girl nodded. “You put it on the ground, so I can reach it. Mom, when you finish eating, just put it on the ground like this for me, so I can wash it.”\n　　She reached out to hug her daughter and kissed her little face: “Mom can handle it, you just have to play.”\n　　”I just play with water when I wash dishes.” Huihua smiled and asked her secretly, “Mom, can I share the cookies you gave me with my brother?”\n　　”Okay. It’s your stuff, you can do whatever you want with it.”\n　　”Then I’m going to play.”\n　　The little girl ran out to play happily, and she took a basin to wash clothes. The old lady’s health was getting worse day by day, so she put all her plans aside temporarily and took care of the old lady wholeheartedly at home.\n　　At night, she discussed with little Shen Hui: “You and your sister should go to the west room to sleep at night. I will stay here with grandma, okay?”\n　　She had been here for less than ten days.\n　　He was still somewhat resistant to her. “Why?”\n",
    "6": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c6/\nCHAPTER 6\nããLi Xia didnât know how to explain to the child. Grandmaâs disease had spread all over her body, and the doctor said she could die at any time. She might be talking to you one minute, and then sheâd roll her eyes and die the next.\nããIf this happened at night, she was afraid that it would scare the child, but she couldnât explain it directly.\nããâHuihui, listen to mom. You and your sister go sleep over there, and let mom stay with grandma.â\nããThe old lady obviously knew why she came, and she explained to her grandson. The little guy knew that his grandmother was seriously ill, and he was reluctant to leave his dearest relative. Hearing this, he ran to the edge of the kang, took his grandmotherâs hand, and asked quietly why.\nããâI can also help you pour water and get things. I want to be with grandma.â\nããShe had been raising the little guy since he was born, and her grandson was her lifeblood. She touched the childâs head lovingly and smiled to comfort the child.\nããâGrandma has something to tell your mom tonight, and we need to have a private conversation. So just go with your sister and donât get in the way here.â\nããâOh, okay.â\nããThis child is really well behaved. This is the conclusion Li Xia came to after these few days of contact. The neighbors also said so. But Li Xia took care of Shen Haiyang every day. The more she looked at him, the more she felt that the suspect in the newspaper in the previous life who was murderer was a bit like him.\nããIs it all just a coincidence?\nããWith this question in mind, she laid out the bedding for the two children and arranged for them to sleep, then went to the side room to chat with the old lady. As they chatted, they came to the place where Shen Huiâs biological mother came from. When she mentioned this, the old lady sighed.\nããâAt the beginning, they were in love relationship. Many of her sisters had to go to the countryside, but she stayed because Haiyang found a job for her. Soon after they got married, they had Huihui. She was very impatient with the child. I thought it was because of her young age, but later when Haiyang got into trouble, she divorced and leftâ¦\nããI cooked and took care of the child for many years after they got married. I thought I would have a daughter. I treated her well and she would treat me well in the future. Who would have thought that once something happened to Haiyang, she would divorce and leave so quickly, not even caring about Huihui. â\nããâwhat is her name?â\nããâMurong Danling.â\nããOh my god, it matches. The news didnât mention the specific name, but it did mention the surname. It couldnât be such a coincidence that everything fits perfectly.\nããâWhatâs wrong? Why are you suddenly silent?â\nããâNothing.â She quickly calmed down, thought for a moment and continued the conversation. âWhere is she now? Why havenât I seen her before?â âIs she still working in the union?â\nThe old lady sighed, âShe left more than a year ago, and I havenât seen her since. Huihui would ask about it before, but now he doesnât mention it anymore.â\nããLi Xia was silent. She felt that she had not raised her own children well, and now she had multiple stepchildren who might be like this. How should she raise these children in the future? While she was worrying about this, the old lady thought of another thing.\nããâDo you miss your son? If so, go see him, or you can let him come here. No matter how much you hate that man, donât take it out on your child.â\nããâwithout,â\nããShe said this word in a confused manner, not knowing whether she missed her son or hated the man. The old lady said so much to her just to put herself in other peopleâs shoes, and not to blame the child for everything, as the child was young and innocent.\nããThe old lady fell asleep in a daze. She looked out the window for a long time before closing her eyes. She was awakened by groaning in the night. It was the old lady who couldnât bear the pain. She quickly went to get her some painkillers. After taking a lot, she fell asleep again.\nããThe old lady couldnât get out of the field these days, and all the neighbors in the courtyard knew about this. The next day, Li Xia found that her neighbor to the east was actually using a cart to bring in bricks, each of which was neat and new.\nããâWhy are you carrying these bricks? Why are they piled up under my window?â\nããâBuild a room. Iâm getting married and thereâs no room for me. The company said it would give me some money but now it doesnât. I can only do it myself to make ends meet.â\nããThe neighbor to the east has two sons. This man, Liu Biao, is the second oldest. The eldest is married and lives in the east wing with his parents and sister. Li Xia felt something was wrong. Could this guy be planning to build a room outside the east wing for himself? As expected, she guessed right. This guy really planned to build a house here.\nããâYou canât build this house.â\nããâWhy canât I build it? Itâs right under my window. I can build it if I want. Havenât you seen how many people are building it in the yard? Itâs none of your business.â\nããThe boy had a thick back and big eyes that looked very fierce. Huihua was afraid that her mother would be beaten, so she ran over and held her motherâs hand. Li Xia smiled and comforted the child first, then winked at Shen Hui to take his sister away. The little boy was very sensible and coaxed his sister to go away. The two of them stood at the door of their main room.\nããâOther people have at most occupied a public passage, and usually itâs behind someone elseâs house.â Li Xia said as she stretched out her hand to stop him from building a house in this location.\nããâYour window is right in front of the east window of my main room. If you build a small house here, the light to the east of my house and the light to the side room will be completely blocked. Moreover, the road to the side room has already been blocked by you, leaving only a narrow strip, and the side room has no light at all and has become a small dark room. How can this have nothing to do with me? Who would allow others to build a house right under their windows?â\nããâHey, originally your mother-in-law was throwing a tantrum and not letting us build it, and now youâre stopping it again. This is really like family members living together, only caring about yourself and not caring about others. Your house is spacious and can accommodate a large number of people, so you donât care about us, right? I donât care about you too, I want to get married and I want to build a house.â\nããâIf you want to build a house, please find another place. You are not allowed to build it in the passageway of my house or in front of my window.â\nããâI, Iâm going to do it, letâs see what you can do to me.â\nããDuring this period, illegal construction was rampant in the shantytowns, and the housing management department did not have clear regulations prohibiting this, so they did not enforce it strictly. When they came, they just tried to persuade them, and sometimes they did not come at all, and people continued to build after they left. Li Xia knew this, and she did not even think of calling the housing management staff.\nããâIâm standing right here. Do you have the guts to pile cement, sand and bricks on me?â\nããFacing the burly man, this woman was not afraid at all. Liu Biao was helpless and could not bring in bricks because of her blocking him. When the two were about to fight, Liu Biaoâs mother came out to separate them.\nããâShenâs wife, you canât do this. You canât just ignore us because we have no place, when you have a place to live, right?â\nããâItâs not my responsibility that you donât have a house to get married. You should go find your boss. Iâm in the Shen family, and I have to maintain the house in the same condition. You want to take my things, but I canât let you bully me.â\nããâYou daughter-in-law, why are you so ruthless with us?â\nããâAm I being ruthless?â Li Xia pointed at the house and two children behind her, and said to the crowd with a wry smile, âThere is a old and sick, a disabled and two small children in our family, all of us are weak. Liu family, you want to build a house to block my passage and my windows, and I just come out to stop you. So how come I am being ruthless? Itâs you Liu family, bullying our family of weak and orphan.â\nããAs she spoke, her mouth trembled with grievance, her face full of pain. The two children came to stand beside their mother, crying pitifully. Well, this time the weak and orphan were portrayed vividly. The public began to pity them and no longer supported the Liu family.\nããâThis courtyard is different from other places. Their is a side courtyard, and the house is cramped, not as big as the main courtyard over there. Your house completely blocks these peopleâs space, which is really inappropriate.â\nããThe neighbor in the west room said, âI just knew that the yard was too small and never thought about it. Otherwise, if you had built it like this under my windows, and the windows and doors of the main room would have to be sealed.â\nããâThe yard is too small. It canât compare to the big yard over there. You canât learn from others.â\nããAlthough the public opinion was in favor of Li Xia and her family, Liu Biao had already bought the bricks and tiles, so how could he let the matter go? He waved his hand and refused to listen to the advice, still carrying bricks in.\nããLi Xia stood in front of the flatbed truck and refused to let him in. The two of them were fighting silently. Liu Biaoâs mother raised her hand and moved a few bricks inside, then scolded her family.\nããâWhy are you standing there? If she doesnât allow us to push the cart in, then weâll just use people to move it in.â\nããAs the Liu family members were about to start, Li Xia saw the right moment and stepped aside, and Liu Biao could not hold back and rushed straight in. Some of the Liu family members who were moving bricks were crushed by the wheels of the cart, and some were scratched by the side of the cart. Liu Biao himself fell on the cart due to inertia, and the bricks made his mouth taste rusty. When he opened his mouth and spat out a tooth and blood.\nããâAh,â the man was furious, looking at Li Xia and about to hit her. Li Xia had expected this, and had just signaled the child to go home. At this moment, she also turned around and went home, closed the door and packed it.\nãâGet out here, I wonât let you go.â\nããâWhat does your falling have to do with me?â\nããLi Xia spoke with tears in her voice. She sounded pitiful, innocent and wronged when she questioned him. Huihua was stunned. She thought her mother was going to pick up a knife and fight with others, but she just showed weakness again and again.\nããâDonât bully us. You rely on your Liu familyâs large numbers to bully us orphans and weak. Arenât you afraid of being struck by lightning for doing this?â\nããThe act of closing the door is to avoid, the orphan and the widow hide inside, and the burly man outside is ferocious. Although Liu Biaoâs forehead was cut and the corner of his mouth was bleeding, everyone thought he was bullying. He could do nothing but watch, so he went back to move bricks in anger.\nããIf you donât believe me, Iâm going to build a house today. You can hide if you want.\nããHe pushed the cart out, and Li Xia walked out of the house. She picked up a brick from the yard and stood in the middle, her chest heaving violently with anger, as if she had been pushed to the extreme and could no longer bear it.\nããâLiu family, you are bullying me so much, letâs fight to the death today. As long as I, Li Xia, am here, you can never block the doors and windows of my house.â\nããThe passage was not as spacious as before, and the lighting was worse, which made her sound as if she was blocking their house into a grave. Liu Biaoâs mother tried to pull her away, but she raised her hand and threw her aside. Just now she was weak flower, and in the blink of an eye she became strong man. Her arms were very strong from years of farm work. In order to earn more work points, she did all the work of men, and her arms were full of muscles.\nããâIâm telling you, donât try to bully us weak people. If you provoke me, Iâll trade you for my entire family. Iâd rather die than live on, but donât even think about blocking my house.â\nããA simple dispute over building a house to block out the sun made her shout like she was breaking out of a desperate situation on the battlefield. She shouted at the top of her lungs, and before Liu Biao came over with his cart, she rushed over and hit him on the forehead with a brick. The manâs head immediately started bleeding, and everyone quickly arranged to send him to the hospital.\nããThe Liu family members were busy with other things. She clapped her hands and piled the red bricks they had pulled in onto the cart. âHuihua, Huihui, come and help.â\nããThe mother and her two children worked together, and the neighbors who were watching were dumbfounded and didnât know what was going on. The red bricks were quickly cleared away, and soon the Liu family returned, along with the police from the police station.\nããThis time, Li Xia turned into weak again. She cried silently when she saw the police and nodded obediently to admit that she was the one who beat Liu Biao.\nããâWe are an family having old, sick and a vegetative husband with no one to stand up for us, and he bullied us by building a house right under my window. Policeman, tell me, why didÂ  heÂ  want to build a house right under my window? He also wanted to beat us. If we hadnât dodged quickly, we three would be lying down now.â\nããâHey, you are confusing right and wrong. Where did our family beat you? And who built a house under your window? Itâs obviously under my window.â\nããThe east window of the main room and the north window of the east wing, were too close to each other. After listening to what the two families said, the police mediated the situation and said not to build a house.\nããâThis place is too small. If you build a house here, it will definitely block other peopleâs lighting and passages. No one would be happy about that.â\nããLiu Biaoâs injury was bandaged for a few cents, and the rest was fine. The attitude of the police and the housing management office was to not allow the house to be built again, and the Liu family was anxious and had no idea what to do.\nããWhen it comes to public management, they can act first and ask for permission later. They can do nothing about building a house. But now that Li Xia has made such a fuss, the house cannot be built, whether in public or private.\nããâThen I got beaten for nothing?â\nããâIf you donât bully others, will they beat you?â\nããThis period was different from later times. There were no specific regulations on compensation for disputes, and people did not have the concept of suing for hospitalization fee. As long as nothing serious happened, the government would basically mediate. When comparing the two families, one family had strong people and the other had old and sick people , it went without saying that he must have bullied the other too harshly. Besides, his injury was not serious, so the mediation was over.\nããThe housing management and police officers left, warning him not to build any more houses. The Liu family had worked in vain, and returned all the bricks, tiles, prefabricated panels they had bought.\nããLi Xia went to the kitchen to cook and then went inside to take care of the old lady. The old lady heard the commotion outside from inside. The Liu family had this idea before, but the neighbors knew that she would definitely not allow it. When she got old, she just sat on the ground and they had no way to deal with it. They were waiting for her to die, so that she couldnât stop them.\nããâNot bad, you can hold the door.â\nããLi Xia smiled and said: âThatâs right, we canât let people bullying us. If the passages and windows are blocked, what will become of our house? If we canât stop the east, the west will also start to make plans. Then we wonât be able to live in this house.â\nããâBe careful when you do that. Donât hurt anyone. If you hurt someone, youâll have to pay compensation at best, or you might go to jail at worst.â\nããâYes, I hit him right on the forehead. This is the strongest part, so usually it will just bleed and break the skin, nothing serious will happen.â\nããThe daughter-in-law is quite capable and can handle both public and private affairs. The old lady let out a long sigh and felt that she had chosen the right person. As she was comforting her, she looked up and saw her cousin-in-law and his wife coming in with a big net bag in their hands.\n",

Li Xia didn’t answer them with a gloomy face. The man was immediately angry because he lost face and started to scold her.\n　　”My niece-in-law, even if you are from the countryside, you should know the rules of etiquette. I came to see your mother-in-law with gifts, shouldn’t you be warm and welcoming?”\n　　”My mother-in-law said that you are a weasel paying New Year’s greetings to a chicken with no good intentions.”\n　　At first glance, this uncle and his wife were two-faced people, and Li Xia didn’t want to pretend with them. She could pretend for a while, but if she pretended too much, she was afraid that she would be led astray.\n　　They never expected her to be like this. She didn’t give them any face when she spoke. The uncle and his wife were so angry that their faces turned pale. The uncle pointed at her and was about to speak, but she spoke before him.\n　　”You just said I don’t know etiquette. Uncle, you are pointing at me like this is the most impolite thing. If you have something to say, just say it. If you don’t, just leave. Don’t make a fool of yourself like this.”\n　　The uncle was so angry that he almost fainted. It took him a while to recover. Just as he was about to speak, the old lady on the kang opened her eyes and sat up.\n　　”Don’t think that you can use Haiyang’s influence to help your relative get a job. I tell you, it’s impossible. If you haven’t returned the money Haiyang’s father sent, then give it to me. If you have returned it, forget it.”\n　　The Uncle’s eyes widened, frightened by the old lady. She had always cut off all ties with her husband before, and returned all the money he sent to her last year. So He had no choice but to transfer it through him for them.\n　　He had long wanted to take such a large sum of US dollars for himself. Why did the old lady suddenly want it again? He came here to get the job quota, not to pay her back.\n　　”Sister-in-law” the man said shamelessly, sitting down on the edge of the kang. “Is that so? Listen to what I have to say from the bottom of my heart. Your daughter-in-law is clearly here for the good things. Do you really want to put everything on her? You’ve given her your household registration, job, house, money, and if something happens to you, she’ll kill Haiyang without anyone noticing, and then…”\n　　”You think it’s all yours.” The old lady pointed at the door, “Get lost.”\n　　”Sister-in-law, you…”\n　　”Uncle, you’d better go. My mother has been feeling unwell these days and needs to rest. Don’t make her angry. Oh, by the way, bring the money mother just mentioned.”\n　　After Li Xia finished speaking, she remembered what her mother-in-law had just said. Although she didn’t know the details, she knew it was related to money, and that money should have belonged to them. Since it should belong to the Shen family father and son, of course they had to take it back. Why let others enjoy what belonged to them?\n　　The uncle stuttered, feeling like he had lost more than he gained. “No, your mother asked me to return it, so I sent it back a long time ago.”\n“Where’s the remittance slip? Let me see it.”\n　　This rural woman actually knew about the remittance slip. The uncle and his wife were really dumbfounded. How could he be willing to return so much money? He was just perfunctory.\n　　”The remittance slip, the remittance slip is lost. I don’t know where it went.”\n　　The aunt said hurriedly and was glared at by the uncle. You idiot, won’t people suspect you if you say that? He was disgusted by the poor answer, but he stood there dumbfounded and didn’t know what to say. His brain was working fast, and it took him a while to make amends.\n　　”Your mother-in-law is ill and confused. Where did the money come from? There is none at all.”\n　　The man dragged the woman away and ran away, without paying attention to their previous plans. Li Xia looked at the things in the net bag, and when she turned around, she heard a plop. She quickly went back to the kang to check on her mother-in-law.\n　　”Mom, mom, are you okay?”\n　　”Grandma, what’s wrong with you? Don’t scare us.”\n　　The old lady seemed to be full of energy just now, but now she seemed to have lost all her energy and didn’t want to talk. She reluctantly waved her hand to show that she was fine, and then closed her eyes.\n　　”You two stay with grandma. Call me if anything goes wrong.”\n　　After asking the two children to watch over her, she quickly went to the kitchen. She made a bowl of malted milk for the old lady, brought it in and carefully fed her. The doctor said that as long as the person could still eat, he or she would be fine, so when she saw her mother-in-law like this, she quickly went to get her something to eat.\n　　The old lady drank a few sips slowly, waved her hand and said no more. Seeing that everyone was worried about her, she calmed down and lay down to speak.\n　　”Don’t…..Don’t worry, I’m fine.”\n　　Li Xia heaved a sigh of relief, gave the two children some biscuits and let them go out to play, then sat on the kang and waited for the old lady to tell her something. This unspoken tacit understanding comforted the old lady, and she slowly spoke after the children left.\n　　”I married Haiyang’s father six years ago, and then the country was in turmoil. He…”\n　　The old lady sighed as she spoke of this. She had kept this matter in her heart for many years and had never mentioned it again. Now that she was dying, she entrusted her son and grandson to her. She had to explain the matter to her so that she could deal with it and avoid being confused and fooled by others.\n　　”He wanted to leave, but I didn’t want him to. We had so much trouble arguing about it that we didn’t want to continue. In the end, he couldn’t persuade me anymore, so he left on his own. But whenever I heard something happened, I always thought he died on the road. I felt sorry for him and resented him all these years, and never mentioned him to Haiyang.”\n　　The old lady shook her head, sniffed and continued slowly: “Two years ago, he wrote to me and sent me money, but I was so angry that I returned it. I was too excited at the time, but now I think it was unnecessary. His decision was not wrong. If he had stayed, he would have suffered for ten years. He is living a good life now that he is gone. People in the mainland thought he was dead, and my son and I did suffer because of it.”\n　　” Haiyang is in this state now, it’s good to have his father to take care of him. At the beginning, he didn’t know Haiyang existed at all. Now even if he doesn’t come back, you can live easily with financial support. I used to think that my child has nothing to do with him, but now I think it’s such a stupid idea. That’s his biological father, why not let the child enjoy the convenience brought by his biological father. “\n　　The old lady finished explaining the whole story, and Li Xia stayed silent. It turned out that the uncle was not only thinking about the household registration and job that Shen Haiyang might get due to his work-related injury, but he was also thinking about getting Shen Haiyang and his son into his own hands so that he could continue to ask his father for money, right?\n　　After all, she had heard in her previous life that those overseas were very rich. Even if they were just doing ordinary things abroad, they were still doing better than in China in recent years. When they were communicating before, Shen Haiyang hadn’t gotten into trouble yet, and the old lady refused to acknowledge him. Now that Shen Haiyang was like this, and she was about to reach the end of her life, many of her thoughts were different.\n　　”Don’t think too much. I’m sure I’ll be able to support them in the future. You don’t have to worry about that. In short, as long as I, Li Xia, am here, I will definitely take good care of them.”\n　　Give her assurance, let her feel at ease. No matter what his father, whom she has never met, is like, they both have me. And sometimes money comes too easily, and if the amount is large, it will cause a lot of trouble.\n　　”I, I don’t care.” The old lady suddenly grinned. “As long as they can have someone to rely on, I don’t care.”\n　　As she spoke, she closed her eyes. Li Xia was startled. She stretched out her hand and found that she was breathing. She closed her eyes and calmed down. She gently stroked the old lady’s chest to help her breathe. After a while, her heartbeat and breathing became stable and she fell asleep.\n        In the following days, she was completely unable to eat and had to rely on drinking a few sips of milk powder to survive. Li Xia was so worried that she ran to find a doctor to give her a few days of nutrient solution.\n　　The old lady was enduring the pain and sometimes couldn’t sleep. When she felt better at night, she talked to Li Xia and asked her to go to her cousin-in-law’s house to get the money back.\n　　”Your uncle can’t possibly return the money, so you have to find a way to get it back. He is Haiyang’s biological father and Huihui’s biological grandfather. They are like this now, and now that I’m gone, it’s time for him, as a father and grandfather, to take care of the children with all his heart.\nI used to blame him, I didn’t want his things. Now I think it’s so stupid, as father, why didn’t I let him take care of the children. I’m doing nothing but making the children suffer with me. I’m not happy, and the children can’t enjoy the things that originally belonged to them. “\n　　”Okay, I’ll go get it.”\n　　Li Xia didn’t say much about this, she just lay on the kang and thought about what the old lady said. She had been struggling for a lifetime, but now she understood this truth.\n　　When we separated, I was full of resentment, thinking that I gave birth to the child and I raised him, and it had nothing to do with you, forgetting that blood ties cannot be severed. You did not let the child enjoy the benefits brought by the father, which made the child suffer and yourself embarrassed. In the future, when the man is old, the child still has the obligation to support him. It is better to accept his compensation and pay him back as what he owes you.\n　　She woke up several times at night to take care of the old lady. The next morning, she asked the aunt in the west side to take care of her, and she rode her bike to the uncle’s house. As soon as she entered the door, she didn’t say anything or go into the house. She went straight to the point in the yard, attracting a lot of onlookers.\n　　”Give me the money my father-in-law sent you to pass on.”\n　　The uncle and aunt were in a panic. The uncle continued to play dirty tricks: “I said I would send it back, but your mother-in-law said she didn’t want it, so I sent it back.”\n　　”My father-in-law is in the United States now. He gave me his home phone number in his last letter. Since you said so, let’s go to the post office and make an international call so that the three of us can confront each other.”\n　　There is actually a contact number? That can be connected immediately. The uncle was immediately panicked. The money he asked him to pass on was a bribe to him. If he dared to keep it all…\n　　”No, I don’t have the money.”\n　　This guy actually wanted to keep all the money privately, it seems that the amount of money is not small. Li Xia smiled and had already thought of a countermeasure on the way. In her previous life, watching TV was a daily pastime, and she had seen a lot of different things.\n　　”Everyone heard it. He didn’t acknowledge the money.”\n　　The crowd was talking about it and many people nodded, but she turned and left. The uncle didn’t know what she was doing. From the look of her face, she seemed to have a back-up plan, but he couldn’t figure out what it was.\n　　After waiting anxiously for about an hour, the police and the Economic and Trade Bureau came directly to his house. They retrieved the evidence that had been mailed to him from the post office and asked him to hand over the money.\n　　”We are entrusted by Mr. Shen overseas to come and ask you to return the remittance on his behalf.” The male police officer did not wait for him to say and explained directly: “Don’t cheat. If you embezzle the remittance entrusted to you, it will be illegal. Come with us now. Once this matter is recorded, it will be a public matter. It is not as simple as a family matter. If it is confirmed that you have embezzled, jail will be waiting for you.”\n　　The police man said that he would not argue with him in a businesslike manner, and the uncle was immediately frightened. Public affairs are not private affairs where you can cheat. If he is found guilty of breaking the law, he will be in big trouble and lose both his money and his life.\n　　”Yes, they are all here. I’ll get them.”\n　　A deposit slip with the uncle’s own name on it. All the 40,000 US dollars were deposited in his name. This old guy is really greedy. There is also a paper bag full of foreign exchange coupons. She counted them and found more than 10,000.\n　　”A total of 50,000, I saved 40,000 and exchanged it for 10,000 foreign exchange coupons. I…” He regretted it so much, he should have spent some money earlier. He saved it and was reluctant to spend it, and now it’s all returned to her.\n　　After getting the money, she took her uncle to the bank and deposited the 50,000 US dollars in the names of Shen Haiyang and his son. The old lady said that Shen Hui got 30,000 dollar and Shen Haiyang got 18,000 dollar, and the rest to be taken home. The staff asked her if she wanted to exchange it for RMB, and she shook her head and refused.\n　　The current interest rate is because the country has just started to switch from a planned economy, so the country has two exchange rates. Li Xia doesn’t understand economics and doesn’t know how these are calculated, so she decided to keep the US dollars and not exchange them. She even exchanged the foreign exchange coupons for 8,000. If she wants to exchange them later, she can exchange them according to the future exchange rate.\n　　The exchange rate is now 1:1.2. She remembered that in the late 1990s, it was more than 8:1, but the prices were much higher then. If it is exchanged now, it is more than 70,000, and after a few years with interest, it will be less than 100,000. If it is exchanged in a dozen years, it will be 400,000 or 500,000. It is definitely more cost-effective to store it this way.\n　　Those who don’t know what will happen in the future will think the interest rate is high, while those who know that they can redeem the money after more than ten years will think it is better to redeem it after more than ten years. In fact, both methods are not very good.\n　　Li Xia knew that it was the most unprofitable to save money in the bank during this period. She followed the old lady’s advice and kept Shen Hui’s money in a fixed deposit without moving it, and she planned to find a suitable time to invest Shen Haiyang’s money in real estate. She didn’t know much about other things, so she would leave the risky things for herself later. One of the father and son was a vegetative and the other was a child, so it was the safest way to invest in a few houses for them.\n",
    "8": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c8/\nCHAPTER 8\n　　She took the foreign exchange certificates and deposit slips home to show them to the old lady and explained everything to her. She was worried about how to tell the old lady that it would be more cost-effective to use the money to buy real estate in the future. Otherwise, life would get better and better in the future, but the currency would become less and less valuable, and it would be too much of a loss to deposit it in the bank.\n　　”Mom, I’m thinking of using Haiyang’s share of the money to buy a house. It will be valuable when I sell it in the future, or I can rent it out to make a living. What do you think?”\n　　The old lady was silent for a while and said, “I’ll listen to you. I’ll keep Huihui’s portion for him to use in the future, and you can handle Haiyang’s portion.”\n　　The old lady thought carefully, and Li Xia nodded and smiled. “Mom, are you really not afraid that I will lose money if I mess around?”\n　　”You are the daughter-in-law of the Shen family. I picked you myself. I trust you.”\n　　”The deposit is in the name of their father and son, and Haiyang will take care of you no matter what you do. I can’t continue to take care of them, I can only trust you. However, the old lady lived in the Republic of China for many years, and she felt that if the current situation were to return to the Republic of China, let alone being so open, it would be more appropriate to have a house.”\n　　”Don’t worry, I will definitely take good care of them.”\n　　”Go make yourself some new clothes. You’ve been wronged by the wedding. Now that you have money, don’t treat yourself badly. Go quickly. Make wear something festive to bring me good luck.”\n　　The old lady gave her all the foreign exchange coupons and insisted that she go to buy cloth to make new clothes. Li Xia didn’t really care about this, but the old lady wanted to compensate her, so she had to ride her bike to the foreign trade mall to make the old lady happy.\n　　In summer, single clothes are made quickly and look brand new the next day. She wore dark blue pants with a short-sleeved shirt with a white background and red flowers, and dark blue cloth shoes. She tied her hair up with a handkerchief and put it on the back of her head, and smeared the vanishing cream she bought yesterday on her face.\n　　She has a very good foundation, with delicate and fair skin. After so many years of hard work, her skin is not so white, but her foundation is still there. Once she is dressed up, she looks young and sunny, and she is obviously a capable young wife.\n　　”Good, that’s great.”\n　　The old lady praised her happily, and she looked very energetic, drinking milk powder from the bowl. Li Xia was worried about her and asked her what she wanted to eat.\n　　”Red-braised pork.” The old man smiled and said, “I’ve been thinking about that smell a lot lately. The smell of meat, so good.”\n\n\n\n　　”Wait, I’ll go buy some meat.”\n　　She went to buy meat with a basket and new clothes on. She greeted her neighbors on the way. She picked a piece of pork belly with fat and lean meat and went home. People who knew her talked about it behind her back.\n　　”This wife looks pretty after she’s dressed up. She’s no worse than Shen Haiyang’s previous wife.”\n　　”She must be pretty, otherwise she wouldn’t have been favored by her ex-husband in the city.” Fang’s neighbor shook his head: “What a pity, such a good young wife is now married to a vegetative man with a burden. The rest of her life will be difficult.”\n　　Fang Xiaomei snorted disdainfully: “No matter how she dresses up, she is still just a rural woman. She would be living with a vegetative for her whole life. She must be born cheap.”\n　　Her neighbor retorted, “That’s not necessarily true. You may not know, but I heard that Shen Haiyang’s father sent back a lot of money from abroad. Didn’t you see that everything she wore today was new? Maybe she is richer than your family. Didn’t you see that she is wearing better clothes than you? She even bought meat just now.”\n　　The younger sister of the Fang family was speechless. She was jealous of Li Xia’s new clothes, which were made of the latest materials. She wanted them but couldn’t buy them. Unexpectedly, Li Xia wore them.\n　　When they heard about the wealth, everyone envied her for a moment, but then they shook their heads. “No matter how rich you are, but you have to take care of a vegetative person and a burden, it’s just like a widow. It’s too pathetic to stay like this for her whole life.”\n　　The aunties secretly felt sorry for Li Xia, who was busy planning for the future. The old lady was dying, so they tried their best to take care of her in her last days. They would deal with their own affairs after the old lady passed away. She had already asked someone to make a cart and welded an iron stove. She had done the preparations and could start working when the time was right.\n　　When she got home, she first went to the side room to look at the old lady, and then went to the kitchen to make braised pork. The old lady hadn’t eaten for many days, but today she ate a piece of meat. After eating, she drank some soup and sighed with satisfaction.\n　　She had explained everything she needed to, and had eaten what she wanted. She had complained about the pain before, but now she didn’t. After she finished eating, she asked Li Xia to help her go to the main room.\n　　”I’ll carry you over.” Li Xia squatted in front of her.\n　　”No, I can walk.”\n　　The spirit that comes suddenly,\n　　Li Xia knew something was wrong. She obediently helped her to the main room. After a few steps, she saw that she had no strength left, so she bent down and picked her up.\n　　The two children were in the front and were ready to lift the door curtain, but their grandmother walked too slowly. Seeing Li Xia pick her up, the two children hurriedly lifted the door curtain completely.\n　　Li Xia knew that the old woman wanted to see her son, so she carried her directly to Shen Haiyang’s bed. She sat behind the old woman to support her. The old woman looked between her son and grandson, and reached out to hold Shen Hui’s hand with her rough and dry hand. Before she could speak, the little guy spoke first with a pursed mouth.\n　　”I will take care of Dad, don’t worry, grandma.”\n　　Tears silently flowed as he spoke. Li Xia turned her head and looked at Shen Haiyang, hoping that he would wake up suddenly. The old and the young looked pitiful. She had only been in this family for a short time, and it was impossible for her to replace her and give them enough sense of security.\n　　Huihua saw Shen Hui crying, and she cried too, silently holding her brother’s hand. Her brother was so pitiful, his father was lying in bed motionless, and his grandmother was also seriously ill.\n　　”Good boy,”\n　　The old lady touched her grandson’s head and turned to lean on Li Xia’s arms. “I’ll leave everything to you.”\n　　”Don’t worry, I will do what I promised.”\n　　After sitting in the east room for about ten minutes, the old man could no longer hold on and was carried back to her original room by Li Xia. She died that night, holding Li Xia’s hand tightly.\n　　”Don’t worry, don’t worry, I’m here.”\n　　The old lady passed away with her promise, and according to the custom, they cried to send her off. The neighbors heard the cries and came to help. The next day, all of Shen Haiyang’s classmates, friends, and colleagues who had a good relationship with him came to help. Li Xia had no shortage of money, so things went smoothly. Three days later, in the hottest weather, the old lady was cremated and buried.\n————\n　　She wore mourning clothes to see her mother-in-law to her grave. After the matter was over and the people who helped her were sent away, she went into the house to change her clothes. She folded the newly made short-sleeved shirt with a white background and red flowers in the closet and put it at the bottom of the box.\n　　The purpose is to make the old lady happy. She cannot wear this dress again before mourning for three years. Black cuffs are put on the short sleeves with white background and blue flowers. Wearing mourning clothes for the elderly will make outsiders know what is going on.\n　　After a day off, they cleaned up the house. Most of the old lady’s things were burned, leaving only a few as souvenirs. The bed was replaced with new sheets, and the room was tidy. Only the owner was missing. Shen Hui couldn’t control his tears when he came in. Li Xia patted the child and squatted in front of him.\n　　”Don’t be sad, grandma knows how distressed you are.”\n　　When she said this, the child cried even harder. She hugged the child and let him vent. Busy with the funeral, the child was sensible and didn’t dare to make trouble. The pain of a loved one’s death is like a thorn piercing your flesh. After the initial numbness, you will find more and more clearly in your daily life that she is really gone and you will never see her again.\n　　The child cried with tears in his eyes, and Li Xia patted him to comfort him. “It’s okay, you will have your mother in the future, and she will accompany you to grow up. If you are unhappy, tell me, I will see you grow up, get married and have children . Then we will go and tell grandma together, she will be very happy.”\n　　”Mom, can grandma really see us?”\n　　”Yes, grandma is always by your side.”\n　　”Can I sleep with my sister in the west room tonight?” After saying that, he pursed his lips and felt a little aggrieved when Li Xia didn’t respond for a while. Li Xia quickly said yes.\n　　”I originally thought that since you are a boy, you need to be trained to be independent from a young age, but your grandma just passed away and you are not used to it for the time being, so I’ll just keep you company for now.”\n　　After settling the two children at night, she turned around and went out to close the door. She fetched some water and went to the east room to wash the man, talking to him while she worked. The doctor said she should talk to him more, but she didn’t know what to say, so she told him about her daily trivialities.\n　　”Now that mom is gone, the saddest person is Shen Hui. In this family, besides grandma, you are the closest to him, but you are quiet now. The child must feel insecure, and his timid eyes make me sad. I hope you can get better. So the child at least has a father without a mother. It’s okay, I’ll just keep talking to you. It doesn’t matter if you don’t get up. The child still has a father lying here.”\n　　After finishing her work, she went to sleep in her own little bed, getting up two or three times a night to take care of him. The next day, she began to pack her cart, stove and other items, and after finishing them, she borrowed a cart to go to the suburbs to buy vegetables.\n　　It’s 1982, and It’s not completely open. The southern frontier is more open and no longer relies on various coupons, but in the north, you still need a ticket to buy everything. She couldn’t buy large quantities of vegetables in the vegetable store, so she thought of going to the suburbs to try.\n　　”Mom has prepared everything. Huihui, you and your sister stay at home to take care of Dad. I’m going to go shopping and will be back as soon as possible.”\n　　Huihua ran over and grabbed her hand: “Mom, what are you going to do?”\n　　The little girl was much braver than before, holding her hand and looking at her with her big watery eyes, looking like a spoiled child. Li Xia smiled and touched her daughter’s head, thinking about where to find a painting teacher for her child.\n　　The baby has been dexterous since she was young and has a unique understanding of beauty. In her previous life, she could make paper-cuts come alive and draw anything lifelike. Unfortunately, they lived in the countryside in their previous life and no one thought it was a big deal. An art teacher told her about her child’s talent, but she was so poor that she couldn’t even buy paints and brushes, let alone provide her with professional art courses.\n　　”Mom is going to the suburbs to buy vegetables. When she comes back, we will make dumplings and sell them early tomorrow. When mom earns money, she will buy Huihua delicious food and new clothes.”\n　　”I’ll go with mom then. If there’s an uphill road, I’ll help mom push the cart.”\n　　Bend down and hug your daughter. How can this child be so caring? At such a young age, she always feels sorry for her mother. Maybe she is too incompetent as a mother. Life is already difficult, and she always puts that bastard Fang Zhongcheng first.\n　　”No, I don’t need to buy a lot. Mom can pull it all by herself.” Seeing that her daughter still wanted to help, she smiled and said, “Help me pick the vegetables when I come back. I have already fermented the dough. You can help me steam the buns together.”\n　　”Okay, I’ll help you when you get back.”\n　　The girl nodded obediently, so sheput on a straw hat, and pushed the cart out of the house. In this trip to the suburbs, she bought cheap leeks, water chestnuts, and cabbages without much effort, but the rest of the beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. were not sold to her.\n　　”These are all supplied to the state-owned enterprises. You didn’t even tell us in advance. If you wanted then we would have grown more.”\n　　”It’s okay. Youcan plant radishes and cabbages now. You can grow more and sell them to me in the fall.”\n　　”Okay, no problem. The land has been distributed to households this year, so we have enough space to grow vegetables.”\n　　As Li Xia was pulling the vegetables home, she was thinking about getting a business license so that she could work legally. In her previous life, she seemed to remember that the first small stall in Beijing was in 1980. This year is 1982, so it should be approved, right?\n　　When she drove home, she saw Shen Haiyang’s classmate who worked at the police station. He was holding a red book and gave it to her as soon as they met.\n　　”Your household registration has been processed, and I heard that a job will be arranged for you as soon as possible.”\n　　”Really?” She excitedly went to take it, but pulled back her hand and rubbed it vigorously on her clothes before taking the red book from him. The first page was the household head, and her name was on it. The second page was still hers, and the third page was written as Li huihua, and her relationship with the household head was mother and daughter.\n　　”Huihua, come and see. We have settled down. You can go to school with your brother in the fall.”\n　　Huihua had already run to her side, happily took it and looked at it from left to right. Although she could not read, the child knew what it meant. She and her mother had a household registration, and they would never be chased away again. Her mother said that if she made money, she could buy a house in the city and become a city people.\n　　”Li huihua, look, this is your name.”\n　　The little girl stroked the household registration card and said, “That’s great. I have my mother’s last name.”\n　　Happy about the household registration, Han Jun ( the male classmate) asked her why she pulled so many vegetables: “Pickled vegetables?”\n　　”No. I want to get up early and sell buns.”\n　　He knew she had so much money, but he didn’t expect her to work so hard. This was good, because it showed that she was not the kind of person who liked to take advantage of others.\n　　”I’ll help you get the license. You can go find Lao Wang, he’s at the Industrial and Commercial Bureau a friend of mine.”\n　”Really? Thank you very much.”\n",

Li Xia felt relieved this time. She prepared the stuffings at night and got up at two o’clock in the morning to wrap the dumplings by herself.\n　　She rode her bike to the stall at 5:30. She had already told the two children about this. Not long after she left, both children got up. Shen Hui went to get water for his father to wash, draw pictures and clean up.\n　　”Selling steamed buns, hot steamed buns and soy milk.”\n　　”How much is it?”\n　　”One dime each.”\n　　This is the popular price, she had already explored the bottom before. The meat buns were 1.5 dime, but she didn’t buy meat, so she made all vegetarian today.\n　”What kind of fillings are they?”\n　”Cabbage, leek and tofu, radish and green onion, and fennel. These are the four for now.”\n　”Give us both, some fennel.”\n　　The shop opened, and as the light got brighter, more and more people came to buy breakfast. By seven o’clock, all the steamed buns and soy milk in the pot were sold out. When she heard someone wanted to buy something, she said it was sold out without even looking up.\n　” I will put up early tomorrow…”\n　　When she looked up and saw that it was Fang Zhongcheng, she swallowed back half of her words. The man was also stunned when he saw that it was her. He had heard a lot of rumors about her recently. In order to stay in the city, she married Shen Haiyang, the vegetative man.\n　　Shen Haiyang was about the same age as him, and the two grew up in the same compound. They went to school together when they were young, and were in the same class in junior high school. However, they were not the same type of people, so although they looked close, they were actually very distant, not even ordinary friends.\n　　”I heard that Shen Haiyang’s overseas father sent him a lot of money, and his company even arranged a job for you. Why are you still doing this?”\n　　Selling breakfasts is hard work, and people at that time generally looked down on small businesses. A stable job is definitely better than this. They divorced, and he looked at her with pity. In order to stay in the city, her life was ruined, and she had to be a widow for the rest of her life and carry such a heavy burden.\n　　”You can buy breakfast tomorrow as soon as possible, they are all sold out today.”\n　　Li Xia didn’t respond to his previous words, and treated him as an ordinary customer. The man looked at her with pity in his eyes. She ignored him and lowered her head to pack up the things on the stall.\n　　After closing the stall, she rode her bike home, and the two children came to greet her happily. “Mom, we fed Dad, and we also ate the buns and soy milk you left for us.”\n　　She smiled and touched her daughter’s head, but her eyes were towards Shen Hui. “Are the buns delicious? What kind of filling do you like? I’ll save some for you tomorrow.”\n　　The boy was a little embarrassed and said, “Anything is fine. They are all delicious.”\n　　The two of them helped her carry the things to the room. Huahua laughed and exposed her brother’s shortcomings. “My brother doesn’t eat fennel, so I ate it for him.”\n　　”Really?” Li Xia looked back at the child and said, “If you don’t like something, just tell me and I’ll save the food you like. If you don’t tell me, I won’t know. In the end, you’ll be hungry and I won’t know why.”\n　　The boy smiled shyly: “I just don’t like it very much, but it’s okay actually.”\n　　”Don’t force yourself. Everyone has food they don’t like to eat, and there’s nothing you can do when you don’t have a choice. But this is what we sell at home now, so don’t feel wronged. If you don’t like it, don’t eat it. Mom will make whatever you like.”\n　　Huihua agreed: “Yes, mom’s cooking is delicious. Brother, just tell mom what you like, and also tell mom what you don’t like.”\n　　”Okay. Actually, I…I just don’t like foods with strong smells.”\n　　”Fennel, coriander, celery, mint, nepeta…” Li Xia listed all the foods with special smells, and the child nodded silently. “Okay, Mommy knows. I will pay attention to it next time I cook.”\n　　For lunch, she made noodles. She originally wanted to stir-fry celery and stew, but later changed it to tofu and tomatoes.\n\n\n\n     The little boy ate the noodles with a smile on his face. After eating, he gave his father water and whispered to him.\n　　”Dad, this mom is really good. She takes good care of me and treats you well. She turns you over and massages you every day, and orders milk for us to drink.”\n　　Li Xia took a nap, went shopping in the afternoon, ate, slept, and made dumplings. Huihua felt sorry for her mother and woke up at night to help.\n　　”Children who don’t sleep well at night will not grow tall.” Li Xia feels helpless towards her daughter. She is too worried. She wants to help her when she sees her hard work. Shen Hui sleeps till dawn. Can’t she sleep well too?\n　　”Mom, I’ll help too.”\n　　Just as she said Shen Hui who was sleeping soundly, he also got up. The two children stood at the kitchen door, and she loved them but also felt sorry for them. Are children from single-parent families too sensitive? Are they afraid that she will be exhausted and no one will take care of them?\n　　No, definitely not. Shen Hui knew how much money he had in his name. In this era when even a millionaire is rare, according to current prices, he could have just laid aside that money for the rest of his life without doing anything.\n　　”Go back to bed. Mom is an adult, and adults are not afraid of this kind of regular life. But you are children and you can’t do this, otherwise it will make you all dwarfs. Be obedient, or I will be angry.”\n　　After sending the two children back to bed, she kneaded the bread and steamed the buns. When they were all steamed, she moved them to the cart outside the door. In one big pot, she boiled soybean milk, and in another, she boiled millet porridge.\n　　As usual, she went to set up the stall at 5:30, and after she set up the stall outside, it was around 6:00 when  people started to come in sporadically, and it reached its peak around 7:00. It was almost 8:00 when she finished selling out. She packed up her things and put all the money and bills in her bag and carried it close to her body.\n　　”Mother,”\n　　When she turned around, it was her son, the little guy was alone on the street, so she quickly pulled the child to her. In the 1980s, family planning was implemented, and human traffickers became rampant. You have to be careful when bringing children. The media was not well developed at that time, so no one knew about it. When this kind of thing broke out on a large scale, many people had already lost their children.\n　　”Who did you come out with?”\n　　”By myself. Dad said yesterday that you were selling buns here, so I wanted to come and see you.”\n　　”I’m sorry, Mommy has sold all the buns today. Wait until tomorrow… Don’t go out by yourself tomorrow. It’s too dangerous. Go find your sister. Mommy will leave the buns for you at home.”\n　　”So, can I go eat it too?”\n　　” Yes you can “\n　　”I knew it. Mom doesn’t abandon me. Mom, here’s what I’m giving you.”\n　　The kid took out a lot of change from his pocket, including two dimes. “Here you go.”\n　　”Where did you get the money?”\n　　”My grandma, dad, and uncle gave it to me.” The little guy laughed and put all the money into Li Xia’s arms. “Mom, keep it all. This is very little. I will earn a lot of money for you when I grow up.”\n　　Li Xia touched her son’s head and wondered what it felt like. He had said the same thing in his previous life, but he had grown up and moved to the city, where he met his biological father. She felt that the child she had raised with great effort had been taken advantage of by that man, and in this life she didn’t want to embarrass herself or her child. Let’s just let nature take its course.\n　　”Okay, Mom will wait for you to grow up.”\n　　She put the child in the bike and took him home. There were two leek and tofu buns left at home, and the little guy happily ate one. After eating, he burped and smiled at his sister.\n　　”I want to drink soy milk tomorrow too.”\n　　”Okay, I’ll leave it for you.”\n　　The children went out to play together, and Li Xia asked the two older ones to keep an eye on the younger ones. She went into the house and poured out the two days’ income, carefully smoothing it out and putting it in different categories. She calculated that the net profit for the day was about 30 yuan.\n　　Not bad. Although it is hard work, the reward is definitely worth it. While everyone is looking down on this job, she is making money as soon as possible, so that she can give her daughter a good education.\n　　She has asked Han Jun to help her find a painting teacher. If she finds one, she will let her daughter learn art from an early age. Moreover, their area is in the center of the provincial capital, and the schools are all top-notch. This is much better than the previous life in the countryside where there were only five teachers and three agents in one school. How could her daughter be better in her previous life?\n　　”Is anyone home?”\n　　When she heard someone shouting, she quickly collected the money and went out from the inner room. There were visitors, one of whom was Han Jun, and the other was a colleague of Shen Haiyang.\n　　”We heard about your story and the organization has arranged a job for you as soon as possible. Considering your educational level, we have arranged a job for you to clean the cafeteria. You can start work next Monday.”\n　　Without asking, Li Xia also knew the salary during that period. Cleaning the canteen did not make more than 30 yuan a month, and this little money was enough for the four of them to not starve to death.\n　　”Thank you for your concern. However, this job should be assigned to those who need it more.\n　　I can now support myself and will not cause any trouble to the organization.”\n　　”Comrade Li Xia, I know you’re selling breakfast. But you have to get up early and work late, and there’s no guarantee at all. What if you can’t buy vegetables or encounter extreme weather, or you can’t sell them after you’ve made them? And what about retirement? What will you do when you get old after setting up your own stall?”\n　　During this period, only those who were out of work and could only do small business like did this. No one had a good idea about it and felt that there was no guarantee. But Li Xia knew the future development, and she was confident that she could deal with his concerns. And as time goes by, the environment will become more and more open.\n　　Soon the income from making missiles will be less than that from selling tea eggs. Of course, the contributions of the two to society are incomparable, and the country will soon adjust the income of various industries. If she can’t make missiles, then there is no need to consider whether she contributes or not. From the perspective of making money, she is of course doing business.\n　　”It’s okay. I’ve thought about all this. I have a solution.”\n　　”Comrade Li Xia, if you refuse this arrangement, it won’t be so easy to get it again in the future. The position may not always be reserved for you.”\n　　”I know. I will definitely not mention work to our manager anymore, so you can rest assured.”\n　　After she turned down the iron rice bowl i.e job, people outside who knew about it started to laugh at her behind her back. The funniest thing was her uncle, who was so angry that he came to her house to criticize her.\n　　”Li Xia, you are such a fool from the countryside. That’s a stable job, many people want it but can’t get it. You should have said earlier that you didn’t want it, you big fool.”\n　　Be polite to your manager and don’t embarrass Shen Haiyang. Li Xia didn’t have such a good temper towards him. While she was cleaning up the cooking utensils, she started to scold him.\n　　”It’s my stuff. I can take it if I want it and don’t want it if I don’t want it. What does it have to do with you? Even if you want it, I’m not happy to give it to you.”\n",
    "10": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c10/\nCHAPTER 10\n“You…you woman…you…”\nShe didn’t even have a tactful excuse, and directly said that she was not willing to give it to you. This made the uncle very angry, and he stammered and didn’t know what to say. He was so angry that he couldn’t answer correctly. The aunt poured a glass of water for her husband to calm him down, and started to criticize Li Xia.\n“Niece-in-law, how can you talk like that? We are your elders, and you don’t know the rules when you talk to us like that. What if you make your uncle angry and make him sick? That job…”\nLi Xia was in a hurry to make the buns, and was too lazy to talk nonsense with them. She interrupted her directly: “Auntie, you are right about one thing. I am from the countryside, and I really don’t know the rules. So I do whatever I like, and don’t tell me about the rules in the future. I am the master of my family, and it is not your turn to point fingers.”\n“you,”\n“Goodbye. Please don’t come here again in the future, or you will get mad and then have to blame me. I don’t accept blackmail, so let’s keep our distance from each other in the future.”\n“you,”\nThey were so angry that they were shaking all over. This time they were not pretending, they were really angry to the point of fainting. Although the niece-in-law before was also quite arrogant, she was not as ruthless as her.\n“You, you just wait and see how I deal with you.”\nLi Xia saw them leave, sneered and quickly made buns. “I don’t have time to fight with you, so don’t always try to get something for free from me. I’m a woman with two children and a vegetative husband, so I have to be tough in what I say and do. I’m the pillar of the family, so I have to stand up for myself.”\nShe gets up early and works late to sell steamed buns and soy milk. In the past month, her business has been getting better and better because of her clean style and fragrant taste. A preliminary calculation shows that her net income is several hundred yuan a month.\nCounting the money she earned, she was really happy this time. There were tens of thousands of dollars in the passbook that she kept for safekeeping, and it was in US dollars. But she knew that it belonged to the Shen family father and son, and the money she earned through her own labor was the guarantee for her and her daughter. She kept the passbook for Shen Hui well, and she would buy him a house for investment after finding a suitable house.\n“I earn by myself. I have my housing and household registration settled. At this rate, I will be able to save several thousand by the end of this year, and I can buy a house myself.”\nShe really didn’t dare to calculate it in detail. She was shocked when she did so. Although she knew what to do during this period, she was still shocked when she really got her first pot of gold. No wonder the old saying goes that money can’t buy foresight. If she had known this in her previous life, she would have gone to the city early.\n“Mom, Uncle Han is here.”\nShen Hui called out from outside, and she put away the food and came out to entertain the guests. “Hurry up and sit down. I’ll pour you some water.”\nHan Jun has seen his old classmate. After observing him for a while, he has more respect for Li Xia. This woman is capable and kind. Her home is clean and tidy, and she takes good care of the father and son. She is also a good cook. The buns she made are also delicious. He heard that her business is good.\n“Don’t worry, I came here to tell you something.”\nLi Xia poured him some water and sat down beside him. “What’s the matter?”\n“The day after tomorrow, Jianshe Road Primary School will enroll new students for the preschool class. Don’t forget to enroll your two children…”\n“I know. I saw the notice posted at the school gate.”\n“Another thing is that I found the art teacher you asked me to find. She graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts and is now a teacher at the Academy of Fine Arts. I showed her the paper-cuts your daughter drew, and she liked them very much. If it weren’t for the paper-cuts, she wouldn’t have accepted such a young student.”\nUpon hearing this, Li Xia immediately smiled. “Okay, then I’ll take HuiHua to their home one day so they can see the child?”\n“We have an appointment. The day after tomorrow. I will take you there at 3:30 in the afternoon.”\n“Okay, I understand.”\nAfter seeing off the guests, she walked around the room. Her daughter was going to see the teacher, who was very interested in the children’s paper cutting. If this thing was done, it could be said that her future path in painting would be more than half paved. In art, her daughter’s previous life, no one taught her, but she could draw so well and win the first prize in the county. If she really had such a good teacher in this life, she would definitely be able to follow this path and not have to study hard in cultural subjects.\n“I need to make new clothes to give the teacher a good impression. What should I do if I don’t have any fabric or coupons at home?”\nShe was so worried that she had money but no tickets, so she could only take out the remaining foreign exchange coupons from the drawer. When she started talking about making new clothes for the two children, Shen Hui frowned when she heard about spending money.\n“You don’t have to buy it for me. My clothes are still wearable.”\nThis child is really frugal. He still doesn’t want to spend the money even though he has so much money to his name. Li Xia reached out and touched the child’s head, and began to explain to him.\n“Because we don’t have tickets, we have to use foreign exchange coupons.” She took out a few big notes from her pocket. “Look, I’ve made money too. Don’t worry, I’m here, and you won’t go hungry. You have to buy clothes, you’re going to school soon. If our family wears tattered clothes, people will look down on us and underestimate us.”\n“Then the saved money won’t be moved, right?”\n“No… that money is for buying you a house.”\n“What about my dad? The money is for my dad’s medical treatment. I can’t just ignore him.”\nThe child spoke in a hurry, his voice getting louder. Li Xia realized where his anxiety came from, and quickly explained to him to calm him down.\n“Don’t worry, I am here. I promised your grandma I’d take care of him and I’ll keep my word. I’ll take care of daily expenses, and I’ll invest some of the money and keep it for emergencies. In short, don’t worry, I’ll never ignore you and your dad. If you don’t want to use the foreign exchange coupons, then I won’t use them. I’ll try to get some cloth coupons back.”\n“Grandma told me to listen to you, so I will.” He looked up at her timidly and said, “I will be good and obedient.”\nHe is only seven years old, but he always puts his father first. He doesn’t ask for pocket money, and saves the few cents his grandmother gives him. When he thinks of money, the first person he thinks of is his father.\nHis mother was gone, his grandmother was dead, and his father lay there motionless. He must be afraid, right? Afraid that his father would not have money for treatment one day, afraid that his father would leave him. Li Xia reached out and touched him, trying to give him a sense of security.\n“Come on, mom will take you two out for some shopping today. School is about to start, and I’ll make new clothes for both of you. Don’t think too much. I’m working hard to make money now, and it won’t be a problem to support the family.”\n“okay.”\nShe took the two children to a foreign trade store, bought cloth and made them at home to save money. She let the two children choose the patterns they liked. Shen Hui chose dark blue pants and a light gray corduroy top under her persuasion, and Huihua chose an orange printed top and brown corduroy pants for herself.\n“Mom, pick one for yourself too.”\n“Yes, mom, you pick it quickly.”\n“Okay, Mom will pick one too.” Most of the clothes she had before were patched up. They were bought for her wedding and now she couldn’t wear them during the mourning period. Buying a new set would make her look neater.\nThe mother and her two children each bought a set of cloth, which was cheap and didn’t cost much. She worked overtime to cut and make them at home.\n“Huihua, Mom bought you some colored pencils and paper. Draw a few pictures these days and bring them to the teacher when you meet her, this teacher is not an ordinary person. If she doesn’t think highly of you, you can’t learn from her then .”\n“Okay, mom, I get it. I’ll draw it well.”\nAfter the new clothes were made, the mother and daughter went to see the teacher of the Academy of Fine Arts under the guidance of Han Jun. The teacher looked at the girl’s painting and asked her to cut paper in front of her. She cut a monkey paper-cut seriously, and the teacher nodded happily.\n“Yes, I’ll take this child.”\n“Hurry up, Huihua thank the teacher.”\nThe mother and daughter stood up together to thank the teacher, who asked them to come every Sunday morning at nine o’clock. Li Xia looked at the paintings hanging on the wall of the teacher’s house and felt happy secretly. Her daughter finally took another path. She didn’t have to work in the factory even if she didn’t study well.\nIn her previous life, a teacher said that her daughter had a talent for art and that if she cultivated it well, she would definitely be able to do so. But she had two children to support and the normal tuition and living expenses for the year were already taxing her, so she really didn’t have the extra energy to support her children to learn this.\nAfter leaving the teacher’s house, she took her child to buy the tools needed for learning painting. Art knives and scissors, paints, brushes, paper…\nThe teacher originally said that it only needed to be simple and not too many colors, but she bought 24 colors at once, and she felt happy when she saw the child’s face turn red with excitement.\n” Mom is making money now, so you don’t have to paint from blue leaves and red bamboo anymore. ”\nHuihua smiled brightly at her mother while holding these tools. She has loved painting since she was a child, but there was no paint at home, so she used the pencils left by her father to paint on waste paper, she doesn’t think the patterns are difficult at all, no matter how difficult they are. In the past, her mother always told her that it was useless and asked her to study hard, but she didn’t expect that she would find a teacher for her and buy so many materials.\n“Mom, do you think art is useful?” If it’s useless, wouldn’t it be a waste to spend so much money? She looked at her mother with great trepidation.\n“It’s useful. If you like painting, it must be useful.”\n“Then, I will definitely study hard.”\n“good.”\nIn a short time, the timidity on the little girl’s face faded a lot. Now her mother is the head of the family, and Shen Hui is a good-tempered child who never bullies her. Living here makes her feel safe, and she smiles a lot more than before.\nShe is happy when her daughter is happy, and she goes home to make dumplings quickly. Make money, make money, only with money in hand can you choose life.\n“Mom, let me help.”\n“Okay, help mom wash the vegetables. Wash them cleanly.”\n“Okay.”\nIt was autumn, and she had recently received a batch of potatoes, cabbages, radishes and other winter vegetables. The brigade had a cellar for her to store them, so she just rode her bike to get them every few days.\nUsually they were vegetarian buns, but later she found a place to buy water and developed a bun with meat – pork head and chili buns. She dried the chili in the summer, mixed the chili with pork head, and added vermicelli, which tasted very fragrant.\n“Mom, the tofu and vermicelli buns you made are delicious. I like that one best. My brother likes the one with cabbage and mushrooms, but cabbage alone is fine.”\n“We’re out of mushrooms for now. I’ll make some for you in a few days when mom goes to the countryside to find fellow villagers to collect mushrooms.”\n“Okay.”\n“Mom, I bought tofu.”\nLi Xia hurried out upon hearing the sound, took the bucket from her son and carried it into the house. “Why did you go alone? Didn’t I say I would go later? Or you can go with your sister, and both of you can carry it with a pole.”\n“I was playing outside when I remembered this, so I went with my friends to get it back for you.”\n“Is that so? Then you can share the buns with your friends next time.”\n“I’ve given it to them before. They all said it was delicious. Four of us shared one and they licked their fingers.”\n“We’re out of mushrooms, so Today we’re making cabbage vermicelli. I’ll save one extra for you tomorrow.”\n“thanks Mom.”\nPrepare everything in the evening, get up in the middle of the night after a good night’s sleep, steam buns and boil soy milk, soak beans and rice to make porridge, and go out to sell on time.\nWhen closing her stall, she would ride her bike into the alley to get information. She had been doing this since she started her stall. During this period, many things were done privately, and she was afraid that she would not be able to get first-hand information if she did not go into the alley.\nSure enough, she got the news today that someone wanted to sell a house. The house had just been returned to the original owner, who planned to sell it to pay for his child’s medical treatment.\nShe rode over and looked inside through the crack of the gate. The yard was quite neat. It was a square courtyard. Under the main hall corridor, an old man was sitting in a rocking chair, leisurely drinking tea.\n",
    "11": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c11/\nCHAPTER 11\n“Uncle, is your house for sale?”\nThe old man straightened up at the sound, looked at her and waved for her to come in. “Not me, I’m looking after the house for my nephew.”\n“So, is this house for sale?”\n“Yes. My nephew needs money urgently, so he wants to sell the house.” The old man looked her up and down, as if assessing her ability to buy a house. “Sell the whole yard, I want cash.”\n“How many?”\nSeeing her expression, the old man hesitated for a moment and held up two fingers. “Twenty thousand.”\n“It’s too expensive.”\nAt that time, it would cost about 2000 to 3000 yuan to build a neat bungalow in the countryside. With the ceiling, flooring, window glass, etc., it would cost less than 5000 yuan. Even if this is a provincial capital, it is incomparable to the countryside, but 20000 yuan is really too high. After all, it was just the beginning of the opening up, and people could not see the advantages brought by the geographical location, and the housing prices were not high at all.\n“My nephew said that the price of this land will definitely increase in the future. Also, look at the surrounding area. There is a street outside the south house. We can do business there once it is open. Such a good location is hard to come by.”\nWhat the old man said was true. She was delighted with the location just now. The yard was close to several schools on the street. With the expansion of universities, the consumption in this place would definitely be extraordinary in the future. No matter what business she did, it would be fine.\n“That 20,000 is too high. Not to mention the provincial capital, even the capital doesn’t have such a high price.” The golden age of real estate is after the millennium. How much can you earn by doing business with money for such a long time? She choose long-term investment for insurance.\n“This is the price my nephew mentioned. If you really want it, just name a price. I’ll tell him when he comes back.”\nLi Xia thought about it and said a middle price. “Five thousand.”\nThe old man shook his head and smiled without saying much, waving his hand to see the guest off. She came out of the yard feeling uneasy, wondering if she had paid too low price. Good houses are hard to come by, and buying one is definitely more cost-effective than saving money in the bank in the long run. Real estate prices will rise in the future, and it will be hard to find another one if you miss it.\nShe was doing the math while riding her bike. In 20 years, the price of housing in the provincial capital will be around 2,000 per square meter, but that is for a building, not this kind of private courtyard. This courtyard, including the house and the courtyard, is about 400 square meters, and the area of the house alone is about 250-260 square meters. She heard that the demolition of the house is based on the same area, and the courtyard is based on half the area.\nThis condition is that the buildings are in the same geographical location. If you calculate this way, you can get two buildings and a shop in the city center. If it is a little further away, it may be doubled. 20,000 US dollars can be exchanged for nearly 200,000 at that time, plus interest, it is about 200,000. If it is exchanged for a house, it will be worth at least 700,000 or 800,000.\nThis means you have made a profit, and the housing price will continue to rise over time. You can live in the house for more than ten years, or rent it out to earn rent, which is also an invisible profit. In the future, if you replace the building with a new one and the upper floor can be rent out, which is also a profit.\nShe will come back tomorrow. If she can lower the price, she will make more money. After all, few people can afford to buy a house now. If he insists on 20,000, it will be difficult to sell. It’s okay. After doing this calculation, she has a bottom line in her mind.\nIn fact, she only lived to 2006 in her previous life. If she had lived a dozen years longer, she would have understood that housing prices had only skyrocketed since the millennium. Even if she bought it for 20,000 now, it would definitely be a big profit.\nThere were only a handful of people who could come up with tens of thousands of dollars at once during this period. She rode home with confidence, and when she entered the yard, she saw her ex-mother-in-law standing. The old lady was telling the neighbors something and when she saw her coming back, she raised her voice to reiterate it.\n“Look, see. She sells buns every day, yet she still asks for money from her child for the bun. Have you ever seen a mother like this? Even if they are divorced, the child is her own. She asks for money just for a bun. Isn’t that too much?”\nSo that’s why,  Li Xia got out of the bike and parked it, and then she asked indifferently, “Do you know how much a bun costs?”\nThe old lady was stunned for a moment and replied: “1 dime.”\n“How much pocket money did you give Yi Yi?”\n“I don’t remember this clearly.”\nLi Xia rolled her eyes at her, went into the house and took out a handful of banknotes. “Count them.”\nShe took it and everyone saw that most of them were one or two cents.\nAs expected, she counted them one by one, and the total was 44 cents.\nHer grandson came to his mother every day, and she knew it very well. Even if there was one a day, that would be more than 30. There were no tickets at all, and the difference of one dime was too much. After counting the money, she was too embarrassed to say anything. How could Li Xia let her go? She asked directly in front of the crowd of onlookers.\n“How many?”\nShe didn’t say that someone who saw it said, “44 cents.”\n“From the time I started selling buns to now, do you think this money is enough? The child said he loves his mother and hence gave the money, so I can’t refuse it. Why do you think I’m selling buns to my son? We don’t live far away, and even though we’re divorced, the child is still mine ?”\nFacts speak louder than words. The ex mother-in-law was immediately furious when she was hit by this fact. Fang Zhongcheng never gave Huihua anything, but Yi Yi often came to his mother’s house. What they eat is more than just buns.\n“The Fang family is really stingy. They come to look for trouble even for such a small matter. Can you really separate a mother and her son?”\n“What? You don’t know.” An insider began to reveal: “They want to push the child to Li Xia and not care about him at all. I heard they are introducing a girl to Fang Zhongcheng. Having a child is a burden.”\n“That’s too much. Li Xia is exhausted to death because she has one child each. The children are not born by her alone, so of course the father has to be responsible.”\n“Don’t talk nonsense.” Old Lady Fang interrupted the crowd and tried to make amends. “We raise our grandchildren ourselves. We didn’t say we don’t care. We each have one child and we each have our own responsibilities.”\nAfter she finished speaking, she pushed through the crowd and fled in dismay. Everyone pointed and laughed at her behind her. “Then don’t come to trouble the child’s mother. It’s just a few cents of pocket money for the child, and you’re still worried that the child’s mother will take advantage of it. A few cents, not tens of dollars.”\n“Really. A penny is as big as a millstone. Li Xia is raising three people by herself, and her husband is a vegetative. He has no end in sight for his life. Who wouldn’t feel sorry for him? She said she was raising a grandson, but in fact she let the grandson run to eat at his mother. Otherwise, could she sell the buns for money.”\n“Of course. She’s less than 30 years old, and she’s supporting three people alone. It’s pitiful for her to be a widow at such a young age.”\n“That’s right. If Shen Haiyang doesn’t wake up, her life will be ruined.”\n“She might be even more pitiful if Shen Haiyang wakes up.”\nWhether it was her ex-mother-in-law or outsiders, they were enough to make her speechless. Most importantly, her neighbors all pitied her, and she wanted to retort but they seemed to be ungrateful, so she simply never listened.\nThe crowd was gossiping, Li Xia was busy packing up her things and didn’t pay attention to others. It’s useless to talk about different values. Why pity her? She thinks she lives a good life.\nShe shook my head and went home to pack up the things she had sold. After that, she fed the man in bed through a nasogastric tube, talking to him while feeding him.\n“I found a very suitable house. Even if I buy it at the price they offer, I will definitely make a profit. But I want to stretch it a little bit, the less the better. Huihui and Huihua have started school. They are in kindergarten this year and will be in the first grade next year.\nI think Huihui will be able to study well in the future. Now we can see that he has a very good memory and reaction. He can memorize the text that the teacher asks him to recite after reading it twice, but huihus hasn’t memorized even one word from a book. Alas, this girl is only good at drawing, and she can do color matching without being taught, but she is doomed when asked to recite a book or do math problems. ”\nShe talked to the man about some trivial matters in life, and when she was done, she wiped his face clean, changed the basin and towel to wash his feet. After she was done, she called the two children over, she helped the man up, and the two children quickly changed his bed sheets and pillowcases.\n“Okay, I’ll give Dad a massage, you two can go play.” The two children responded and prepared to leave. She remembered about buying a house and called Huihui back. She started talking to the children about buying a house.\n“With your dad being like this now, Mom has to discuss things with you. I think buying a house is definitely better than keeping money in a bank. Are you willing to buy a house?”\n“I’ll listen to you.” The little guy smiled, “Uncle Han said that you are my guardian now, so I should listen to you.”\n“Then buy it. I’ll take you there when the transfer is completed.”\nHan Jun and his uncle, needless to say, are also people who supervise her. However, Han Jun is positive. As long as she has the right mind, he will take care of her in all aspects of life.\nThe uncle is two-faced, causing her troubles and also acting as a supervisor, but as long as she has the right intentions, he can do nothing about it. To put it bluntly, she has nothing to fear as long as she is upright.\nShe liked the house and went to look at it every day. She talked to the old man day by day, making it seem like she was interested in buying a house but didn’t have enough money.\n“My nephew said he can’t sell it at your price. The house will definitely be worth more in a few years, and it would be a loss for him to sell it too cheap.”\n“Uncle, this business is all about asking for a high price and paying back the money. Your nephew said that the housing prices will double in a few years. Hasn’t he thought that in a few years, prices will rise and money will not have the purchasing power it has today?”\nThese economic terms were all learned from TV in her previous life, and she was learning and applying them to the old man now. The old man didn’t understand this either, after all, the prices in the country hadn’t changed for many years.\nUnder the planned economy, there was a shortage of materials but stable prices. When it suddenly changed to a market economy, many people could not think straight and never thought of exchanging money for materials to prevent inflation. In her previous life, there was a family of four men in her village who farmed and worked as laborers during the slack season. They saved money in the bank anyway. But after saving for more than ten years, they found that the money that could build a two-story building was not enough to buy a bungalow.\n“This old man doesn’t understand. Wait, I’ll tell my nephew what you said.”\nShebcame here several times, but she didn’t even see the owner. But according to the owner’s speculation, he should be a knowledgeable person. The planned economy is changing to a market economy, and it is gradually integrating with the international standards. If you don’t have knowledge and courage, and only rely on decades of experience, you will not only fail to make a fortune, but also suffer a great loss.\n“Okay, I’ll come back the day after tomorrow.”\nAfter bidding farewell to the old man, she returned home. The two children were not yet out of school. She cleaned the house as usual in the morning and then prepared the dumplings. Before she knew it, it was noon. Today, she made some extra radish and tofu stuffing and made dumplings for the two children.\n“Mom, we’re back.”\nShe leaned over and smiled at the two children, “Be good, go wash your hands and get ready for dinner.”\nDumplings, although they were vegetarian, the two children still enjoyed them. Li Xia subconsciously looked outside. Her son hadn’t come in the past few days. Was it because the old lady at home was up to something? She couldn’t control her so Would she bully her son behind his back?\n“Huihui,”\nShe was worried about her son when a woman stood at the door called Shen Hui. Li Xia immediately recognized the her. No wonder the woman looked so familiar. It turned out to be Shen Hui’s biological mother. She had seen her photo in the album.\nThe woman at this time was more fashionable than in the photo, wearing high heels, straight trouser seams, a woolen top, and bright and aggressive facial features. She was completely different from Li Xia’s simple dress.\n“Huihui, come quickly, it’s been such a short time, don’t you recognize your mother?”\n",
    "12": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c12/\nCHAPTER 12\nThe woman stood at the door of the inner room and stopped moving in. Shen Hui stood by his father’s bed and looked at her silently. The seven-year-old child had been separated from his biological mother for more than a year. He stood there and looked at her with a strange look in his eyes.\n“You little brat, you don’t even recognize your biological mother now that you have a stepmother? You were born to me, so I am your mother.”\nAs the woman spoke, her eyes moved back and forth between Li Xia and Shen Hui. It was obvious that she was targeting them. She was angry about her son’s attitude, and she was also dissatisfied with Li Xia’s presence.\n“The child is still young, what can he understand? As a mother, you should talk to him nicely.”\nUnexpectedly, Li Xia spoke in a teaching tone, and the woman sneered and came directly at her. “Who do you think you are? How can you interfere in our mother-son relationship?”\n“I am Shen Hui’s guardian now, and I am responsible for all his affairs.”\nLi Xia was very calm, and the years had already worn away her impetuousness. Facing this beautifully dressed woman, she did not have any inferiority or cowardice at all, and spoke calmly and reasonably.\n“I’m his biological mother, he…”\nShe was speechless for a moment, and the uncle shen next to her said, “Li Xia, don’t get involved here. It’s not your place to butt in on the affairs of a mother and her son.”\n“That’s not right.” Faced with the two of them squeezing her together, Li Xia was not at all panicked and was not afraid to speak up and argue with them.\n“I am Shen Hui’s guardian. Everything about him is related to me. And this is my home. Whatever you want to do when you come to my home, it has to do with me. How can you say it’s not my turn to speak? I am the owner of this house. It’s already very rude for you to come here uninvited as guests. It’s even more unreasonable to talk to the owner like this.”\n“We…” The uncle rolled his eyes and pulled Shen Hui to the door. “This is your mother, your biological mother. You can’t have forgotten your biological mother and been fooled by a stepmother all day long.”\nThe woman immediately put on a friendly look, stretched out her hand and pulled Shen Hui back to the outer living room. “Son, mom is here to pick you up. Mom left in a hurry and didn’t take you with her. Are you angry with mom?”\n“Mother,”\nThe child started to cry, and the woman happily hugged him and kissed him. “You are such a good son. Come on, go home with me, and you won’t have to endure this woman’s anger anymore. No stepmother is good, and she actually asked you to serve that dead man…”\n“My father is not dead.”\nSuddenly, as if a switch had been triggered, the child threw away her hand and roared at her. His big eyes were full of anger, staring at her like a wounded little animal.\n“You little brat, I carried you for ten months, gave birth to you and fed you milk, and this is how you repay me? You keep talking about your dad, your dad. Your dad has become a vegetative, how can he stand up?”\n“Go away, go away, my father is not dead, my father will not die.”\nThe child suddenly became emotional and stretched out his hand to push the woman out. Li Xia was very worried about the child and stretched out her hand to stop her when she saw her uncle trying to pull her away.\n“Mind your own business. It has nothing to do with you. Also, why are you here today? You’re just causing more trouble every day.”\n“Hey, how come I’m the one causing trouble? It’s obviously you who wanted to monopolize Shen Hui’s money, so you tried to sow discord between the mother and son.”\nThe woman had been pushed to the door by Shen Hui, and she shouted, “Yes, it’s you. You are such a bad woman. You are trying to sow discord between us and take my son’s money. I tell you, no way.”\nWas she tricked by his uncle? No, this uncle wanted to take both the father and the son into his pocket. But this woman also got the news, and of course she would not let go of such a large sum of money. She is Shen Hui’s biological mother, and she has an advantage over him in the custody of Shen Hui. The two of them hit it off and immediately went to the house together to get Shen Hui first, so that they would have more advantages in the lawsuit.\nThe key to this matter is Shen Hui, who has so much money in his name. Now that his father is like this, if his biological mother gets custody of him, then the money will really go to the woman along with Shen Hui.\n“I have filed a lawsuit. I want custody of my son. Don’t try to take advantage of my son, woman. He is mine. He belongs to me.”\nShen Hui was stunned, and Li Xia had nothing to say. If this matter was sued again by the woman, it would be hard to say what the result would be. After all, she was the stepmother and she was the biological mother.\n“Let’s go, Huihui, follow mom.”\nThe woman tried to pull the boy again, but the little guy slipped into his father’s room on the east side. The woman stood at the door and called for a long time, but he didn’t come out. The Uncle Shen signaled her to go in and pull him out, but she shook her head and refused. The Uncle Shen wanted to do it himself, but Li Xia pulled him out.\n“You are not involved in this matter, why are you joining in the fun?” Li Xia said as she picked up the door-knocking stick, and the Uncle Shen ran out of the house in fear. Even so, he still did not give up, and was still shouting inside to give advice to Shen Hui’s biological mother.\n“Go in, go in and take him with you. He is your own son, and it is only natural that he will listen to you.”\nThe woman stomped her feet and came out: “Let’s go, I’ll come again tomorrow.” After that, she gritted her teeth at Li Xia and said, “You are trying to sow discord between mother and son. You are such a bad woman. You can do anything for money. You, a woman, will not die well.”\nIn stark contrast to her anger, Li Xia’s emotions remained calm. “You are talking about yourself.”\n“You… Humph, just wait for me. You must not take my son’s things.”\nThe woman left shouting, and the onlookers were talking about it. How could Li Xia have taken the child’s property? It was obvious that she got the news and came to ask for the property. If she really loved her son, why didn’t she take him with her when she divorced?\nLi Xia: No matter what others say, you can’t control others’ mouths. As long as they are true to their conscience, they can say whatever they want. She walked into the house quickly, went to Shen Hui and took the child’s hand.\nThe little guy was very sad, holding his father’s hand and crying. The old lady said before that he was mostly taken care of by his grandmother since he was born, and after he was weaned at the age of one, he was taken care of by his grandmother day and night. His mother left before, and now she suddenly came back, and she asked for money as soon as she opened her mouth. I don’t know what the little guy is thinking.\n“Don’t cry, Dad will be sad if he knows.”\nShe touched the child’s head and took out a handkerchief from her pocket to wipe his tears. The little guy was still sobbing and twitching. He looked up and asked her with tears in his eyes.\n“What about her?”\n“She is gone.”\n“It was grand uncle who told her about the money, right?”\n“maybe.”\nUnexpectedly, at such a young age, he was so keenly aware of his mother’s intentions. Li Xia said nothing except silently comforting him. She was in an awkward position, and saying more would seem like provoking him.\nAfter dinner in the evening and sending the two children to bed, she washed Shen Haiyang and massaged his limbs, talking to him while working.\n“I was originally planning to buy a house, but now your ex-wife is here. From the sound of her voice, she wants money. If she gets the custody of Huihui, then I really have to give her Huihui’s share of money. I’m a stepmother, ah, really… Is she responsible enough for Huihui? Are you assured of giving Huihui to her? Huihui is still young. If she gets the custody, then all the property under Huihui’s name will be hers to deal with.”\nShe kept talking but got no response. At night, she lay on my bed and looked out the window, thinking silently. In the previous life, why did Murong Danling and Shen Hui, mother and son, quarrel so fiercely, and then accidentally got killed by him? Was it because of money? Shen Haiyang’s father sent back 50,000 yuan at a time. Is he very rich?\nShe didn’t care whether the other person had money or not. What she cared about in her new life was changing the miserable life of her previous life. God gave her several decades of foresight, she could earn money by herself and didn’t covet others. But she promised the old lady to take good care of the father and son. Shen Hui was her responsibility and she couldn’t ignore him.\n“Money is the root of all trouble. That old saying is so true.”\nShe was too irritable to sleep, so she just got up and made dumplings. She went to the stall early in the morning, and when she came back she was so tired that she took a nap. She made a simple noodle soup for lunch, and when she was almost done eating, Huihua turned around and saw a little figure at the door. She went out and brought her little brother in.\n“What are you doing? Why haven’t you come these past two days? The buns that sister saved for you are about to go bad.”\nThe little guy had been secretly observing Li Xia’s expression since he was at the door. He pouted timidly at her. Li Xia didn’t say much. She served him a bowl of rice and asked him to sit down to eat. Huihua also brought him the buns that she had specially reserved for him.\nThe little guy was attracted by the buns, took a bite and put it down as if he remembered something. He looked up at Li Xia and hesitated to speak. He didn’t know when his clear and pure eyes became heavy.\n“What’s wrong? What do you want to say?”\n“Mother……”\n“It’s okay to just say whatever you want to say.”\n“Grandma said that if I kept coming to see you every day, I should not go back to that house. So I ran away secretly.”\nIn divorce, the children are the ones who are hurt the most. In her previous life, her life was ruined, and she lived like she was 70 at the age of 50. She had always disagreed with this statement in her previous life, and felt that divorce would hurt her the most. But at this moment, she realized it. In divorce, except for the scumbag, the three of them were all victims.\nIn her previous life, she was nagging, sensitive, irritable, aggrieved, and even mean, and the children felt pity, annoyance, and distress for her. In this life, she thought it was good for the child to leave him with his favorite father, but it turned out that he also longed for her as a mother, and looked at her with attachment like a little animal.\n“Don’t be afraid, Mom will talk to Dad, and the adults will solve this matter.”\nFang Zhongcheng is so irresponsible. He said he left his son to him to raise, but in fact he pushed everything to his parents and family. You are a father, and you don’t care about your son. Do you know how your mother treats your son?\n“So I can still have a mother, right?”\n“Yes, you have a mother.”\nShe invited her son to eat, and after that she asked the two older ones to play with him. In the afternoon, when the children went to school, she took the younger one to find Fang Zhongcheng. When the man came out of the office gate, he saw her leading her son, and immediately looked around. When he found no familiar people, he pointed to a secluded place.\n“Why did you bring Yi Yi to see me? Did you encounter any difficulties? I just started working and I can’t help you…”\n“Do you know how your mother treats Yi Yi?” Li Xia silently rolled her eyes in her heart, interrupting his self-righteous words. She would not come to him even if she encountered difficulties. Who do you think you are? I can live without you.\n“What happened to my mom?”\n“What did we say about our divorce? I took care of the Huihua and you took care of Yi Yi. Now, you’ve left the child completely to your parents. Your mother first made trouble for me, then threatened Yi Yi not to come to me after she felt guilty and embarrassed. Tell me, is it too much to ask a child this young to not come to his mother?”\n“My mother, my mother…”\nHis mother had said this to him in person, so he knew she would do this. But the divorce staff had made it clear that parents had visitation rights over each other’s children. He had also visited his daughter when he passed by the school, and now that the two families were so close, how could he not let his son go to his mother?\n“When people get old, they become stubborn. Don’t take it seriously.”\n“I won’t argue with her. But what about Yi Yi? What should Yi Yi do? You are the child’s guardian. Do you think you have fulfilled your responsibilities as a guardian? Children are not cats or dogs that can be eaten by others. Have you paid attention to his physical and mental health?”\nThe series of questions made Fang Zhongcheng look at this woman he had always looked down upon with new eyes. He didn’t know that these were all what Li Xia had seen on TV in her previous life. He just thought that she had been reborn in such a short time after entering the city.\n“What else can I do? I have to go to work.”\nHe reached out and picked up his son, speaking helplessly but confidently. Li Xia was very angry about this and rebuked him mercilessly.\n“It’s just like who doesn’t have to work. Open your eyes and look at how many women are working and taking care of children at the same time. Family members and parents can only be auxiliary. Is there anyone who would just leave the child to them like you? You are Yi Yi’s guardian, you have to fulfill your guardian responsibilities.”\n“Okay, I got it. I’ll pick Yi Yi up after I get off work in the evening.”\nHe had already promised, and Li Xia didn’t say anything more. She was busy selling buns and taking care of a vegetative person and two school-age children. Now Uncle Shen and Shen Hui’s biological mother were causing trouble again, and she really didn’t have the ability to take care of another one.\nIf she rashly took him to her side, she would repeat the same mistakes of her previous life. She would be exhausted and have a bad temper, and the children would hide from her and be afraid of her. In the end, their relationship will be deteriorated, and she would be sad and upset, and she would not be able to raise the children well.\n“Talk to your mother and don’t impose the grudges of adults on the child. Also, you are the father and you have to take the responsibility of raising and caring for the child. Don’t push it onto your parents.” She didn’t know if she could convince the other party of this truth she had only figured out after starting over in her life.\n“I want to find a way to send our child to a nursery so that my mother doesn’t have to take care of him all the time.”\n“Okay, then give the child to mom, I have to go back and prepare the buns.”\n“Li Xia,” She was about to leave when she heard him calling and immediately turned back. He actually started to persuade her, as if he was doing it for her own good.\n“I heard that Shen Haiyang and his company have arranged a job for you. Why don’t you take such a good job? Selling buns every day is embarrassing and tiring, and there is no guarantee for the future. What if Shen Haiyang wakes up and doesn’t want you anymore, you won’t even have a job. Fortunately, you didn’t sell the quota. Maybe it’s not too late to go to the leader now… Hey, Li Xia, I’m speaking from the bottom of my heart.”\nLi Xia had already left, and she didn’t want to say anything more about it. She work hard to make money because she know that if you rely on others, they will run away. His worries are unnecessary. She can support herself in this life and in the past life, so you don’t need to worry about me.\nIf you really want to, just take good care of the child, and stop thinking about exhausting yourself. I have done my share of responsibility, and when the child grows up, you can pick the ready-made ones. As for selling the quota, if there is any trouble, it will implicate Shen Haiyang. If he wakes up in the future, he will have to work. It is not worth it for that little money. I can earn money by myself, and I will not be greedy for this cheapness.\nA few days later, Fang Zhongcheng found a nursery for his son and took him to his dormitory at night. Li Xia could no longer see her son every day, but she felt more relieved than when she could see him at his grandparents’ house.\nThe child was picked up by Fang Zhongcheng. She thought that this man was quite responsible for his son. After she went home and cooked dinner for the children, she asked about the two children’s school situation.\n“What did teachers teach in school?”\nShen Hui replied: “Today we were taught to recite “Viewing the Waterfall at Mount Lu”. It was written by Li Bai, a poet from the Tang Dynasty .”\nWhen she heard about this, Huihua was a little nervous, thinking that her mother would ask about the content, but she didn’t memorize it. In the end, she was only concerned about what happened in school. She asked what they played after class and whether anyone bullied them.\n“No, we played the game of Drop the Handkerchief, and it was great. Whoever lost got to sing a song. I sang a little tune that mom taught me, and my classmates liked it very much.”\n“What’s the tune?”\n“Fireflies, red every night, grandma weaves lanterns out of Chinese cabbage…”\n“Okay, just be happy.”\nAfter the mother and her two children finished their meal, they went to wash the dishes. Shen Hui was feeding his father through the nasogastric tube. Li Xia came to get something, but the child reached out and grabbed the corner of her clothes. After hesitating for a moment, he asked her.\n“Did she come to see you today?”\n“No.” It won’t be long. Maybe seeing Shen Hui is unmoved, the other party will directly sue? She has no idea about this. She doesn’t know what Murong Danling’s next move will be.\n",
    "13": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c13/\nCHAPTER 13\n　　She was worried and didn’t get enough rest for several days. After selling steamed buns, she ran to the police station to find Han Jun and ask about the child’s custody.\n　　”Haiyang is in this state now. If Murong Danling really sues, the case will most likely be given to her.”\n　　Han Jun also sighed after he finished speaking. He and Shen Haiyang have been best friends since elementary school. He has had little contact with Murong Danling over the years and doesn’t know her well. But this woman’s character can be seen from the fact that she divorced Shen Haiyang as soon as he got into trouble and didn’t take the child with her. How could anyone feel at ease leaving Shen Hui to her?\n　　”Then, is there no other way? Shen Hui’s share of the money is a fixed deposit. If she becomes the guardian, can she find a way to withdraw it?”\n　　”It should be. After all, Shen Hui is still young. If Haiyang doesn’t wake up, this matter will be difficult to deal with. But don’t be too anxious, we will find a way.”\n　　”All right.”\n　　Shen Haiyang is now incapable of acting, and as his guardian, she can supervise his share. Now that the Uncle Shen is like this, she is worried that there will be other tricks, and with Murong Danling, the two of them are plotting against the father and son together.\n　　”Find a way to contact Shen Haiyang’s father. This money was given by the old man. As long as we can contact the old man, as he is the direct relative of the father and son, the amount will definitely be enough. No one should think of getting money anymore, because their true colors will be exposed by then.\n　　Otherwise, if Haiyang’s uncle sues you for not being qualified as a guardian, or if Murong Danling gets custody of Shen Hui and then turns her attention to Shen Haiyang, it will be troublesome.”\n　　”But the provincial post office can’t make international long-distance calls now. If you want to make a call, you have to go to Beijing, and it seems you need to apply for it. And what if I go there and can’t get through? If I go, what will happen to the three of them at home?”\n　　Last time, Uncle Shen yelled at her. After all, she had to consult Han Jun and the people at the post office to understand the situation. Now, if she wants to call, she has to travel far away, which is really inconvenient.\n　　”Do you have an address? Write to me.”\n　　”Okay.” Li Xia knew the backwardness of this period, and sighed: “I don’t know when I can receive this letter?”\n　　Han Jun hesitated for a moment and said, “I see someone is selling a house. You can turn the money into physical objects and transfer it to your name. We can’t do anything about Huihui’s custody, but at least we can find a way to keep Haiyang…”\n　　He hesitated to speak, his eyes a little guilty. He felt that Li Xia was trustworthy these days, but he felt that the adult’s vigilance was still a bit too cautious.\n　　”Let’s be frank…”\n　　Li Xia didn’t wait for him to speak and spoke: “It’s written in black and white, let’s do what we have to do. I already have the house and household registration, I won’t covet their things anymore.”\n　　”I’m sorry, thank you for everything you’ve done for them.”\n　　”As I should, I have gained something. I told the old lady that I would take good care of them, so I must do my best. But, will they sue me for transferring Shen Haiyang’s property? Isn’t this illegal?”\n　　”You are his guardian, so it’s not illegal to do this. The most you can do is lose the case and you will be ordered to return the money to Haiyang. Then they will have to sue separately if they want the money, and the back and forth will delay a lot of time. Then we will contact Shen Haiyang’s father, and he will make the decision.”\n　　”That’s fine.”\n　　When the old lady was alive, she helped her get a household registration and transferred the house to her name. Just for this trust and great favor, she had to do her best to protect them. As for what outsiders would say about her, she was not afraid of what others would say because she was true to her conscience.\n　　After leaving the police station, she rode her bike to the place where the house was being sold. The old man told her that his nephew would be back in a few days and asked her to come in person to talk then.\n　　”Daughter, my nephew will most likely disagree with your price. I advise you to prepare more if you really want it.”\n　　”Thank you, sir.”\n　　She rode home, washed up, and started preparing stuffing. For lunch, she made three-grain noodles and added two eggs to the water chestnut stew. The two children came back with their heads down and looked unhappy. She looked at her daughter and asked what was going on.\n　　Huihua turned to look at her brother, and Shen Hui raised his head and said, “My mom was waiting for me at the school gate, saying she wanted to buy me some clothes. I didn’t go, so she stuffed this into my pocket.”\n　　The child took out a handful of transparent glass eggs from his schoolbag. This thing was new and a favorite among children. The woman was obviously trying to please her son and seemed to want to win him over first.\n　　”I’ll cook the noodles, you guys wash your hands and eat.”\n　　At the dinner table, Shen Hui observed her expression and then said, “Mom, if you don’t like it, I’ll throw away the egg later.”\n　　”Why throw it away? There’s nothing wrong with the item.”\n　　The relationship between mother and child is not something that outsiders can interfere with. If she hadn’t seen the news in her previous life, if Murong Danling divorced and took the child away and just came to ask for money, she would have given the child as much as she should reasonably. With Shen Haiyang’s condition, it would definitely be better for the child to stay with his biological mother. But after seeing the news, she had to make plans for the child.\n　　After dinner, she went into the house to talk to the child about buying a house. The child was silent for a while and said, “Grandma said that you can decide on Dad’s share, and keep my share for me to use in the future. Mine is 30,000, right?”\n　　”right.”\n　　Since the old lady had already said it, Li Xia didn’t say anything more to the child. But from the tone of his voice, his attitude was different from before. It seemed that his biological mother had a lot of influence. I don’t know what provocative words she said behind his back. The relationship between the stepmother was already difficult, and with the biological mother messing around, she… Anyway, she just did her best and lived up to her conscience.\n　　She was busy buying a house, so the renovated courtyard house could not be sold for the time being. She rushed home anxiously, and within two days she received a court summons. And there were two of them.\n　　One was for Murong Danling to ask for custody, and the other was for her cousin to apply for custody of Shen Haiyang, saying that she had not fulfilled her responsibilities and applying to cancel her custody. She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when holding the subpoena, and she talked to Shen Haiyang again at night.\n　　”You and your son are both incompetent. If you didn’t have a cent, you would have avoided him like the plague. Now that you have money, it’s like a child holding a gold brick on the street. Everything that can stick to you will stick to you. Shen Haiyang, can you wake up? You lie here without any response. I can’t contact your father for the time being. As a stepmother, I will most likely lose the lawsuit for Shen Hui’s custody.”\n　　She was worried and was so focused on talking that she didn’t notice Shen Haiyang’s fingers moving slightly and his eyelashes trembling a few times.\n　　Neighbors who knew about the situation were also discussing it. Zhang Qiuhua from the west room came in specially at night, looked at Shen Haiyang lying on the bed, and sighed several times.\n　　This girl is 24 years old this year. She failed to get into college after going to the countryside and is now assigned to work in a machinery factory. Li Xia has been here for a few months. She has been to the main room three times, looking at the room where Shen Haiyang is and sighing silently.\n　　”Li Xia, what are you planning to do?”\n　　”I have no idea.”\n　　”How could you not know? Uncle Shen has bad intentions. If he gets the guardianship of Shen Haiyang, he will definitely not take good care of him. Although you are not well educated, Brother Haiyang would definitely not want you if he was normal. But you take good care of him, at least better than his uncle.”\n　　”This matter has nothing to do with you. You have no right to speak.”\n　　Hey, what do you mean, girl? Is it fun to belittle me in front of me? Whether Shen Haiyang likes me or not is his business. It has nothing to do with you, right?\n　　”I, I just want to help you out of kindness.”\n　　”How will you help?”\n　　”As a neighbor, I can testify that you took good care of him.”\n　　”Thank you very much.”\n　　”Actually…” She stood up and was about to leave, then came back to ask, “Do you really think it’s worth it to spend your whole life in it? Or are you waiting for Brother Haiyang to die, then you can remarry.”\n　　”This is my business, it has nothing to do with you.”\n　　The woman lifted the curtain and prepared to leave. Her words were clearly heard by Li Xia. “If Shen Haiyang and his son had no money, you probably wouldn’t be in charge of this.”\n　　”I hope they have no money.”\n　　Zhang Qiuhua stepped back and said, “Li Xia, don’t sound so noble. That much money is more than you can spend in a lifetime…”\n　　”So you are jealous?”\n　　”I, humph, why should I be jealous? That money will belong to Shen Hui in the future and you can’t take it. Besides, those two are suing you, maybe you will end up with nothing.”\n　　”I just hope you can speak according to your conscience in the court. Thank you very much.”\n　　This woman obviously had good intentions towards Shen Haiyang and his son, so Li Xia did not quarrel with her.\n　　There were rumors that she might be kicked out with nothing, but she knew that the house had long been in her name and no one could kick her out.\n　　She has a house and a household registration, and the money originally belonged to Shen Hui, so she didn’t want to take it. If she had known, she could have earned money on her own, but now she was worried about how to live up to the old lady’s trust.\n　　She promised the old lady to take care of them, so now she had to find a way to at least keep the custody of Shen Haiyang and take good care of him in his last days to live up to the gift of the household registration and house. As for Shen Hui, he still had a long time to wait until he became an adult and something happened. If there was no way now, she could find a way out later.\n　　To be on the safe side, she asked Han Jun to find someone who knew about the law for advice, so that she could be prepared for any eventuality. The other party invited them to sit down and explained the situation after listening to them.\n　　”In the case of Shen Hui, it is very likely that he will be given to his biological mother. As for your case, there are no clear provisions, so it is hard to say. Your case is different from the rural cases where people do not obtain a marriage certificate. I am not sure whether it will be considered a de facto marriage or invalid.\n　　I personally think the judge will definitely lean more towards the legal level. Your marriage is obviously illegal. If it is ruled invalid, then your guardianship qualification will be… You should start looking for familiar neighbors to testify for you. The more witnesses the better. As long as you can prove that you have taken good care of the old lady and fulfilled the guardianship duties entrusted by the old lady, there is still hope.\n　　Of course, the best thing to do is to contact Shen Haiyang’s father. As the donor of the money and the immediate family of the father and son, his words carry weight. If he follows the old lady’s wishes and entrusts you as the guardian to keep the money, the problem will naturally be solved.”\n　　She nodded to the lawyer, as it coincided with her idea. She went home and began to win over the neighbors in the courtyard. She got along well with the neighbors in the past few months. She would sell them buns even if they didn’t have food coupons, so she was popular with them.\n　　Notary offices are units that have been restored in recent years. Li Xia later learned about their functions from TV. She had thought about this at the time, but the provincial capital notary office was still in preparation and had not yet been opened. Now that it has started normal work, the old lady has passed away, and it is too late.\n　　The purpose of the two was very clear, it was for the 50,000 US dollars. The money was in the name of the father and son. Now if they wanted the money, they had to ask the two of them. This would actually reduce her burden. Anyway, she already had a house and a household registration. Han Jun was worried that she would just go with the flow. But she hesitated for a long time and asked him to help take care of the family for a few days.\n　　”I’m going to Beijing and I have to contact Shen Haiyang’s father as soon as possible.”\n　\n",
    "14": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c14/\nCHAPTER 14\nããâWill there be any problem?â\nããAt this time, international contacts were not completely opened up. At the beginning, they were all written, and the letters were checked in the first few years. She didnât know what happened in the past two years. Now she wants to apply for international long-distance calls, and he is worried that it will cause trouble. But Li Xia knows the future development trend and shakes her head and says it doesnât matter.\nããâIâm just sorry to bother you for a few days. I donât know when I can get through to him on this phone.â\nããâI, Iâll find a way. Donât worry, Iâll give you at least a week.â\nããâThanks.â\nããHan Junâs father was paralyzed in bed, and his mother was ill and needed care all year round. His wife was already busy taking care of the children and the elderly, so he would rush home after get off work every day. But now he had to help, and he thought of his cousin. Even if he had to pay her, he had to get through this period.\nããLi Xia knew his worries, so when she got home, she went to the west room to find her neighbor. She asked her to help take care of the three of them for 15 yuan for ten days.\nããZhang Qiuhuaâs mother was an unemployed housewife. She nodded in agreement immediately as she could earn money and take care of the family at such a close distance.\nããâI have no problem taking care of them, but where are you going? You are going for so many days.â\nããâNothing, Iâll be back as soon as possible.â\nããWithout saying much, she gave the other party ten yuan, and the other party patted her chest and promised to help her take care of the family. With Han Jun helping to look after her, Li Xia prepared to buy a ticket to Beijing the next day.\nããShe told the two children about the situation that night, and Huihua nodded obediently. âI will help take care of them. I know what to feed them.â\nããShen Hui also agreed: âI will take care of Dad.â\nããAfter telling her family, she bought a ticket to Beijing the next day. The train was rattling for several hours, and it was already late at night when she arrived. She stayed in a guesthouse for one night with the letter of introduction issued by the street office. The next step was to apply, wait for approval, and then make a phone call.\nããDuring this time, she was traveling around Beijing and happened to come across a house for sale. It was basically the same as the courtyard house she saw in the provincial capital. The house was well maintained and not much damaged. The other party offered 11,000 yuan, urgent sale, cash.\nããThis was really a pillow for a sleepy person. She had seen a report in the newspaper in her previous life that during this period, someone bought a courtyard house in Beijing for about 10,000 yuan, and it was worth tens of millions after the millennium. She paid a deposit of 500 yuan, and in order to get the money as soon as possible, she did not choose to remit it through the post office, but went to Province B.\nããIt was agreed that she would go to the provincial capital to get the money in five days, and she would pay for the travel expenses. After the contract was signed, the other party shook his head and said that she, a woman, was quite knowledgeable.\nããLi Xia put away the receipt and contract and said with a smile: âSee you in the provincial capital in five days.â\nããâOkay.â\nããAfter buying the house, she finally got the chance to make an international call, but the first attempt didnât go through. She was so anxious that her forehead was sweating. Fortunately, the staff allowed her to make the second call.\nããâBeep, beep, beep,â the sound of the standby phone made her heart beat so fast that it seemed to jump into her throat. She prayed silently in her heart: Please answer it, please answer it, please.\nããâHello, May I help you,â\nããâHello, Iâm looking for Mr. Shen.â\nããShe nervously said what she had planned, but the other party actually replied in English. She tried to speak a few more sentences, but the other party was still speaking English, which clearly showed that the other party did not understand Chinese.\nããSoon the call was hung up by the other party, and she was dumbfounded holding the receiver. The staff took the receiver from her and called the next person. She had already paid the money, and was now pushed aside by people who were in a hurry to make a call.\nããItâs over. Did she dial the wrong number? No, she checked it over and over again. It couldnât be wrong to dial according to the letter. Maybe the other party wrote it wrong? Or maybe the phone number was changed?\nããAnyway, her call didnât work. She called again but still couldnât communicate in a foreign language, so she had no choice but to return. Before leaving, she sent another letter from here according to the address, hoping to get in touch as soon as possible.\nããThe trip took a week. When she got home and just entered the yard, Zhang Qiuhuaâs mother told her another piece of news: âHuihui was taken away by his mother. Han Jun went to look for her, but I donât know how she managed to keep the child. You have to be careful.â\nããSeeing that she was stunned, the woman began to persuade her: âIf it were me, you should leave this child alone. If the biological mother is willing to raise the child, then let the child live with the biological mother.\nBeing a stepmother is hard enough for you, and his father is still lying in bed and needs you to take care of him, so why add so much trouble to yourself? â\nããThe neighbor outside the courtyard heard it and said, âThatâs right. People outside say youâre doing it for the money, but in fact the money is all in the bank. You work hard every day to earn money and you donât get any money from others. Why do you want to have it both ways? You raise a child and still get criticized like that.â\nããâGive his child and money to his mother. She is his flesh and blood, so You can have peace of mind.â\nããNeighbors who knew her well had said so recently, and she knew it too. But she had promised the old lady that she would take good care of the child. Now that things had come to this, she could only do her best and leave the rest to fate. If the child was really awarded to Murong Danling, she would have no other choice.\nããShe said nothing about the comments of outsiders, washed and changed her clothes to go to Murong Danlingâs motherâs house to see the child. She had to ask Han Jun what the situation was. If it was really the childâs wish, she would not interfere. A forced melon is not sweet, not to mention that she, as a stepmother, was against the biological mother, and she had no right to force it.\nããShe packed up and waited for her daughter to get home from school, and the girl told her the details.\nããâMom, brother hui was taken away. The day after you left, a few adults came after school and took him away. I heard them talking about mom and granduncle, and my brother struggled and said he didnât want to go, but he was still taken away.â\nããâYes, mom knows. Mom will go find brother.â\nããShe went out to find Han Jun to inquire about the situation. Han Jun sighed and said to her, âI donât know what Murong Danling said to the child, but Shen Hui has believed her now. She said that she would bring the father to live with them in the future, and the family would live together. This alone has won the childâs heart, and he no longer resists her.â\nããâThen, it seems that Shen Hui is going to be with his mother. Does he have to give the savings under his name to Murong Danling as well? Or is there any other way to not give it to her?â\nããâIt has to be given according to the law. If she becomes the childâs guardian, then the property under the childâs name must be given to her for safekeeping.â Han Jun sighed: âForget it, she is the biological mother after all. The worst that can happen is that she will waste the money. After all, she will raise the child well, right?â\nããâI hope so.â Thinking of the news she saw in her previous life and the words the old lady told her before she died, she decided to go see the child. âTake me to Murong Danlingâs house.â\nããâOK.â\nããThe two of them arrived at the place quickly, and just as they opened their mouths, Murong Danling led Shen Hui out. The two parties immediately stood there in a confrontation. Murong Danling touched her sonâs head and looked at Li Xia with pride.\nããâTell her that you will follow your mother from now on.â\nããLi Xiaâs eyes moved to Shen Hui, and the little guy lowered his head and didnât dare to look at her. He finally raised his eyes with apology. He didnât listen to Murong Danlingâs words, and looked at Li Xia with some guilt.\nããChildren are born to yearn for their parents. This is the nature of humans and all animals. If he wants to follow his mother, then, there is nothing to say. She just needs to fulfill her responsibilities and have a clear conscience.\nããâHuihui, are you okay?â\nããThe little boy shook his head and nodded again. âIâm sorry.â\nããâItâs okay. I was just worried about you so I came to see you. Do you want to come home with me now or stay here?â\nããâOf course my son follows me, his biological mother.â\nããNot long after Li Xia left, she took Shen Hui to live with her. Judging from the childâs current attitude, he has been brainwashed a lot during this period. As a stepmother (outsider), it is really not appropriate for her to interfere in the relationship between the biological mother and child, because it is likely to be thankless and may even have a counterproductive effect.\nããâThen Huihui, Iâm leaving now.â\nããShe had done her best, and there was nothing more she could do. Otherwise, it would only backfire if the child rebelled and regarded her as a bad person, and she would not be able to interrupt him in the future. Anyway, even if the custody of Shen Hui was given to Murong Danling, they would still live in the same city. She would take it one step at a time and act according to circumstances. For the sake of the old lady, she would try her best to take care of him and give him some advice, which was worthy of the old lady giving her a house and helping her settle down.\nããâI, Iâm going back to see my dad.â\nããUnexpectedly, the little guy shook off Murong Danling and chased after her. Li Xia smiled and took the childâs hand. The people from the Murong family behind her wanted to pull her back anxiously, but they were stopped by Han Jun.\nããAfter returning home with the child, the little guy fetched water to wash his fatherâs face and feet. Without Li Xia asking, he took the initiative to explain to her.\nããâMy mom said that we could take my dad to be taken care of, and we can be together as a family of three in the future.â\nããââ¦â¦Do you believe it?â\nããâMy grandparents and my uncle and aunt all said so. They said that my mother didnât take me with her because there was no place to live. Now my second uncleâs company has a new place to live and he has moved out, so we can have a place to live. And my moneyâ¦â\nããAfter all, he is a child, and he hopes that his parents will be together. What can Li Xia say about this? She can only keep quiet and think of ways to leave him a way out. Use his fatherâs money to buy him a house, so that he will have a way out in the future, and he will not do anything extreme for money.\nããAfter going to the bank to withdraw money, she completed the transaction with the person accompanied by Han Jun. She took the receipt and went to Beijing to handle the house transfer. When she came back, it was already three nights later.\nããBecause of time constraints, she didnât set up the stall the next day. Zhang Qiuhuaâs mother came to settle the account for her previous help, and after the matter was settled, she began to persuade her.\nããâPeople should know when they are content. You took care of them for a few months and saw the old lady to her final resting place, but you also got the house and household registration. Now they want people and money, so just let them go. Donât be tooâ¦â\nããâAunt, do you also think that I am greedy for their father and sonâs money?â\nããâWhy donât you let go? The dispute is about money. Thatâs what people say. Youâre in court over the money of this father and son.â\nããLi Xia didnât explain anything. This kind of thing couldnât be explained clearly. She sat on the bed and massaged Shen Haiyang, and then she started to argue. âAunt, you and Shen Haiyang have been neighbors for decades. In your opinion, is it okay for me to take care of them during this period?â\nããâVery good. We neighbors have all seen this. You are efficient and takes good care of them. No one can say anything about this.â\nããâIf the trial on Shen Haiyangâs guardianship is held, can you help me testify?â\nããâWhat are you proving? Just saying that you took good care of them and werenât irresponsibleâ\nããâright.â\nããâOkay, Iâll testify for you. His uncle has bad intentions. If it wasnât for the benefits, he wouldnât rush to take care of a vegetative person. He disappeared when Haiyang first got into trouble. Ever since he knew that the father and son got the money, he has started to make plans.â\nããâThank you very much.â\nããTry your best to get people to testify for her. She is the guardian chosen by Shen Haiyangâs mother to take care of her son. If the neighbors testify, the slander of the uncle should be broken. As for Shen Hui, it may be useful to find a way to make him see Murong Danling clearly.\nããLooking at Shen Haiyang on the bed, she whispered, âDo you know that you and your son have become the fat meat that everyone wants to take a bite of? Without money, no one wants your combination, and now that you have money, itâs troublesome. Your mother passed away, and your father canât be contacted. I wonder if our marriage is considered good?â\nããAfter she finished speaking, she smiled and sighed, âBut donât worry too much. Even if your uncle wins the lawsuit, I wonât let him take you away. I promised your mother to take care of you, and I will do my duty. Your uncle is a man with bad intentions, and I wonât give him the chance to harm you. As for the money, donât worry, he canât swallow it. As long as we contact your father, he will have to spit out whatever he gets.â\nããLi Xia had an idea in mind and was not in a hurry about the court hearing. In her previous life, she saw on the news that Shen Hui grew up in a single-parent family, so she always thought that Shen Haiyang would be like this in his life and did not notice his changes during this period. His eyelashes trembled and his fingers were shaking slightly, as if he was trying hard to open his eyes and wake up.\nããAfter a dayâs rest, she continued to set up the stall to sell buns. At noon, she told Shen Hui that she was a little busy these days, so she asked his mother to help take care of Shen Haiyang.\nããâAs a family of three, she needs to get used to it first, right?â\nããâOkay. My mom said she was ignorant before, but she will take good care of my dad in the future.â\nããâWell, Iâll go sell the food, and Iâll leave your dad to your mom.â\nããMurong Danling never expected that she would be dragged by her son to take care of Shen Haiyang. She was already shivering slightly when she stood at the door. She was extremely resistant to entering the house where Shen Haiyang lived. When her son dragged her to the door, she racked her brains to think of how to refuse. She really couldnât go in. Standing at the door, she seemed to smell an unpleasant smell, which made her hair grow all over.\nããâHuihui, Mommyâ¦ Mommyâs stomach hurts, Mommy doesnât feel well. Mommyâ¦â\nããAlthough Shen Hui is young, he has been through a lot. The residual memory of the accident just now made him stop suddenly. His big eyes looked at her, and the clear black and white reflected her resistance.\nããâMom, didnât you say that we would be a family of three together in the future? You will take care of Dad. We are a family and blood relatives.â\nããâIâ¦I, give me some time. Iâ¦â\nããâYou donât want to take care of dad at all, do you?â\nããâYes. I just donât want to take care of his eating, drinking, defecating and urinating.â The woman was forced into a corner by her son, and her suppressed emotions burst out and she began to speak without thinking. After she finished speaking, she saw her sonâs cold eyes and instantly came back to her senses, remembering what her family had discussed. She blamed herself for speaking too quickly and quickly made up for it.\nããâMom is, Mom is your mom. I just want to take care of you. Mom loves you very much. Children all want to be with their biological mothers. Donât you want to live with Mom?â\nããSeeing Shen Hui remained silent, she pointed at Shen Haiyang on the bed and continued, âYour father is already a useless man. He canât give you anything. But mom can take you out to play, to the zoo, anywhere you want to go. Only then can mom love you.â\nããâI have to take care of Dad.â\nããThe little guy said firmly, then went in and squatted down to empty the urine bag for his father. After finishing the job, he walked out with the urine pot. Seeing this, Murong Danling quickly dodged to the side, still dodging the urine pot that looked clean.\nããShen Hui emptied the urinal and fetched water to wipe his fatherâs hands and face. Murong Danling was so anxious that her head was buzzing. Then she rushed in and snatched the towel from his hand, washed it in the basin, and wiped the patient on the bed.\nããâIâll take care of him, okay?â The woman took the towel from her sonâs hand and wiped the manâs hands and face. Seeing her sonâs expression softened, she gave the little guy a look and said, âI was the one who took care of your dad when he got into trouble. You donât remember it at all. Now that Li Xia has only taken care of him for a few days, you all remember her kindness. You are so ungrateful.â\n",

It seems that it has always been my grandmother who has taken care of them. The little guy was full of doubts. Murong Danlingâs eyes flickered but her words were firm.\nããâOf course. Iâm his wife, if itâs not me who will take care of him?â\nããâThen why did you leave later? If you hadnât left, grandma wouldnât have gone to find a new mother. Our family of three would have been together.â\nããHow could the brat have so many questions? Murong Danling was furious. If it was before, she would have raised her hand to beat him, but now he was a golden baby, she didnât dare. If she pissed off the little guy and he didnât want to follow her, then she would lose more than she gained. Looking at the brat, thinking about the 30,000 US dollars, she suddenly felt that he was glowing with gold, and her anger towards him was suppressed.\nããâMom has no choice. Your grandma blames me for your dadâs accident and bullied me every day. If I didnât leave, Iâll be bullied to death. I, I also wanted to take you with me, but your grandma wonât let me. Baby, you talk to mom like this, is your grandma always saying bad things about me to you? I know, she mustâ¦â\nããâNo, grandma didnât say anything about you.â When the little guy mentioned the old lady, he pouted and looked very sad. âI wanted to find you, and grandma took me to grandmaâs house. Grandma said you were not there, and told us not to come again.â\nããâYour grandma also wanted me to start a new life. I was crowded with my colleagues at work at that time, so I really couldnât take you with me.â\nããâAll right.â\nããFinally, the matter was resolved, and Murong Danling secretly breathed a sigh of relief. She talked to her son for a while to strengthen the parent-child relationship, and left two dimes for the child before leaving.\nããâBuy whatever you want to eat. If someone bullies you, go find your mother.â\nããThe child nodded and shook his head: âShe never bullied me.â\nããMurong Danling didnât like what she heard, and she tried hard to hold back her anger. âIâm leaving now. When your custody is returned to me, Iâll come and pick you up.â\nããâAnd Dad.â\nããâUm.â\nããThe answer was very reluctant and in a very low voice. Unfortunately, the little guy was so immersed in the happiness of his parents and the three of them being together that he didnât hear it.\nããLi Xia saw that Shen Hui was still yearning for his dream, so she said nothing. In the following days, she was still busy with her own business of making money. Investing in real estate was one aspect, and on the other hand, she had to rely on herself to make money.\nFirst Selling food accumulates funds to prepare for future sales. Trading goods back and forth between the north and the south is when you can make big money.\nããShe waited for the uncle and nephew to come back and sat down with the seller to have a deep discussion. Finally, the price was set at 7,600. At that time, the region did not have a big impact on the housing price. The location of this place in the provincial capital was very good. The other party thought it would appreciate in value in the future, but it was not so valuable at the moment. The owner was in a hurry to use the money, so she finally spent less than 20,000 to buy two courtyard houses in the provincial capital.\nããLooking at the property certificate with her name on it early in the morning, she felt like she was dreaming. She glanced at Shen Haiyang and started talking to him again.\nããâThese two properties will be worth tens of millions in 20 years. With this, Shen Hui should not have to worry. Even if we cannot contact your father, even if his money is taken away by his biological mother, he will have a way out if the mother and son have a rift over money in the future. I am making a lot of money from selling buns now, and I plan to modify the south wing of the newly bought house and open it to the street. In this way, I can open a store. I will open a breakfast shop first. The location is good and the business will probably be goodâ¦â\nããSuddenly she saw the manâs arm raised, she stood up halfway in shock. Then she rubbed her eyes, and the man stopped moving again. She patted her chest to calm herself down.\nããâIâm dizzy, I was scared to death. Shen Haiyang, Iâm telling you, Iâve done my best to protect you and your son. If you can live a few more years, your son will still have a dad and a home here. I promised his grandmother to take care of himâ¦ Oh my god!â\nããShen Haiyang actually opened his eyes after his arm moved, but she was not as frightened this time as before. She had seen scenes of vegetative patients waking up in TV dramas in her previous life, so she calmed herself down after the shock and reached out to observe Shen Haiyang.\nããâHey, Shen Haiyang, are you awake? Are you awake or are you making any muscle movements? Can you speak or even blink?â\nããThen he blinked. Li Xia was overjoyed. She stomped her feet on the ground with joy and didnât know what to say.\nããâWhatâs wrong?â\nããBecause of Murong Danlingâs appearance, Shen Hui no longer called her mother. But at this moment, she didnât care about this at all, and happily pointed at the person on the bed and talked to the child.\nããâYour father is awake, your father is awake.â\nããâreally ?â\nããShen Hui hurriedly ran to the bed and found that his father had actually opened his eyes. He called him happily and threw himself into his arms. Tears flowed out uncontrollably.\nããâDad, Dad, are you really awake?â\nããâcough,â\nããShen Haiyang coughed, and Li Xia quickly pulled the child up. âThe child is too excited, please donât mind. Iâll get you some water to moisten your throat.â\nããWithout the gastric tube, he drank a mouthful of water from his mouth. This progress made them ecstatic. And after drinking the water, he looked at Li Xia and wanted to speak. After thinking for a long time, he asked doubtfully.\nããâWho are you?â\nããLi Xia didnât know how to answer for a moment. She was speechless. He looked at her and stammered again: âI want to hear you talking ?â\nããHe just woke up and couldnât say much, Li Xia was too embarrassed to say anything. But Shen Hui, who was standing next to him, was eager to answer his fatherâs questions.\nããâShe is the wife grandma married for you. But my mom said that doesnât count, and some people said that having a wedding banquet does count, so I donât know if it counts or not.â\nããâWhereâs your mom?â\nããâMy mom divorced you.â He felt a little ashamed when talking about this child, âBut my mom said that she will take good care of you in the future, and our family of three will be very happy.â\nããShen Haiyang frowned and turned his gaze to Li Xia. Li Xia smiled and took clean clothes for him from the closet. âItâs good that youâre awake. We can talk about other things later. Letâs go, put on your coat and go to the hospital for a check-up.â\nããAfter changing her clothes, she took the mattress and went outside to pad the tricycle. She came in and let the two children hold her, and she squatted in front of him and carried him on her back. The man was embarrassed, and she saw that he didnât move, thinking that he felt uncomfortable, so she turned around and picked him up.\nããAfter lying down for so long, the man was so skinny that he looked light. But for Li Xia, who was used to doing hard work, it was nothing. She carried him to the flatbed outside in a princess-like manner.\nããâHuihua, go to the room and get a pillow for him to lean on.â\nããâOkay.â\nããWith a mattress and pillows, Shen Haiyang was safely placed in the flatbed cart. She turned around and rode her bike, and Shen Hui also got on to follow. She glanced at Huihua and asked her to stand in front while she pedaled the bike and the family of four went to the hospital.\nããThe car drove out steadily. The neighbors who saw it greeted him one after another, and when they saw Shen Haiyang woke up, they all congratulated him.\nããâItâs not easy for your wife. You must treat her well in the future.â\nããâYes, a woman is taking care of the three of you, getting up early and going to bed late. â\nããThis is what they said when they were on good terms. The aunt in the east room, who was unable to build a house because of Li Xia, was just behind him, not too loud so that Shen Haiyang could hear her.\nããâJust for the money of this father and son, she got the house. Whatâs so difficult about that? You are a snob who is only interested in money.â\nããShen Haiyang heard the auntâs words clearly. He was still immersed in the embarrassment of being carried like a princess just now, but when he heard these words, his face turned pale and he subconsciously looked at Li Xia in front of him.\nããLi Xia also heard it, stopped what she was doing and turned back: âItâs useless to be jealous. No matter how jealous your eyes are, the house and the money have nothing to do with you, and your son will still be single. Iâm not saying that with the character of you and your son, itâs natural that you wonât be able to find a wife.â\nããâyou,â\nããThe old lady was so angry that she pointed at her arm and trembled. Li Xia said nothing more and turned to ride away. You always want to take advantage of me. Donât you know that itâs not worth it to make someone angry to death? If you want to be tortured, donât blame me.\nããShe rode her bike to the provincial hospital quickly, and the doctor checked him out and said he was fine. âThe next step is rehabilitation. Lying down for such a long time will take time for muscles, bones, and organs to recover, so we still have to be careful about the care we take.â\nããLi Xia nodded carefully: âDoctor, I will remember everything you said.â\nããShe memorized a bunch of doctorâs instructions one by one. When she heard that he should be careful about his diet and not eat anything raw, cold or hard all at once, she went home in the evening and made him some thin dragon beard noodle soup.\nããThere was soup made from tomato sauce, white noodles, and beaten eggs scattered throughout, but the large bowl was only filled with half of it and was brought to him.\nããâTry to eat on your own. The doctor said to eat small and frequent meals. I prepared milk biscuits for you when you get hungry in the middle of the night.â\nããThe man looked up at her and smiled: âThank you.â\nããLi Xia waved her hands, looking at his gentle and elegant eyes with some embarrassment. âItâs okay, itâs okay, Iâm just taking care of you, this is what I should do.â\nããThe man ate the noodles slowly with a spoon. Seeing that he was fine, Li Xia turned around to prepare the stuffing for the buns. She had to take care of him for rehabilitation, so she might have to put the buns on hold. But the noodles and stuffing that were already half-finished had to be sold, otherwise it would be a waste.\nããShe took her daughter to the side room, while Shen Haiyang ate in the main room and asked about his sonâs recent situation. Hearing that his mother had passed away, he couldnât help but shed tears.\nããâGrandma, did she say anything before leaving?â\nããâYes, she told me to listen to her.â\nããIt seems that his mother trusts this woman very much. Shen Haiyang remained silent after hearing this. He ate the noodles and asked his son to take the bowl away. Then he heard his son say that his biological mother wanted to sue for his custody.\nããAfter all, the child was too young to explain clearly, which made him full of doubts. In the evening, Li Xia prepared the buns and fetched water for him to wash. As usual, she got a towel to wipe his face, and the man reached out to take it.\nããâI will do it myself.â\nããShe smiled sheepishly and handed him the towel: âIâm used to it. I forgot you were awake. Here, wipe it yourself.â\nããHe spoke incoherently, and after stuttering once, his speech slowed down, and now it was almost impossible to hear the punctuation. He washed his hands, face, and teeth, and Li Xia changed the water to wash his feet. The manâs gentle eyes were obviously embarrassed. He wanted to wash himself, but Li Xia refused.\nããâSit still. The doctor said you have to proceed step by step and not be impatient, otherwise itâs bad for your health.â After saying that, she raised her head and smiled, both to ease the awkwardness and to show her kindness to him. âJust think of me as your babysitter, thereâs nothing to be embarrassed about.â\nããShe took good care of him, reminding him of the comfort he felt when he couldnât move. âWhen did my mother die?â\nããâIn early July. She was already seriously ill when she came to see me, relying on painkillers to hold on. After she brought me to take care of you both. She passed away peacefully.â\nããIgnoring the pain the old lady was in, she didnât want him to feel bad as a son. But when she looked up, he was still in tears, so she quickly handed him the towel.\nããâMom, what she was most worried about was you, her son. The doctor said that there was almost no chance of you waking up, so she thought someone would take care of you. Now that youâve woken up, she must be very happy in heaven. Donât be sad, she must be smiling when she sees you now.â\nããâThanks.â\nããHe saw the black cuffs on her arms, and this thank you was extremely serious. Li Xia waved her hand and said itâs okay, washed his feet, helped him lie down, and put the chamber pot beside his bed.\nããâCall me if you need to pee. You just woke up and your body is not flexible, so donât try to force yourself.â After saying that, she saw that the man looked embarrassed. She knew he was embarrassed, so she said casually, âDonât be embarrassed. I have been taking care of you these days, and I have seen every part of your body.â\nããShe originally wanted to ease the embarrassment, but after she finished speaking, she found that his face suddenly turned red. In all her years, she had never seen such a thin-skinned man. She smiled awkwardly, feeling inexplicably funny, as if she had teased a decent man.\nããâIâm from the countryside, I havenât received much education, so I speak frankly. Donât be offended. If you find anything I said wrong, just tell me and Iâll try to correct it.â\nããThe manâs face was a little sunken due to his thinness, but now that he had woken up, his big eyes were more prominent. He was in his thirties, but his eyes were very clear. Pure and bright, like a spring stream, moist and warm. Hearing her words, he slightly raised the corners of his mouth, his eyes full of joy.\nãâItâs okay, thank you for the time.â\nããâItâs okay. Your mother helped me and my daughter get our household registration, and also provided me with a shelter from the wind and rain. This is a huge favor to me. I promised her to take good care of you, and I will definitely do it.â\nããThe two of them tacitly agreed not to mention the wedding ceremony. Li Xia arranged for him to lie down and go to sleep, and she also lay down on the small bed beside him.\nããShe Turned off the lights and drew the curtains, soon the room is plunged into darkness.\nããIn the dark night, she could faintly hear the other personâs shallow breathing. Li Xia was thinking silently with her back to him.\nããThe next day, the two children went to school. After selling steamed buns, she took him to the hospital for rehabilitation. Seeing him sweating profusely, she kept encouraging him and wiping his sweat. She wanted to help him several times but was stopped by the doctor. The man looked back at her anxious face and smiled calmly.\nããâItâs okay, I can hold on.â\nããâYeah. If youâre really tired, take a rest.â After saying that, she turned her head and looked at the corridor: âThe doctor is not here, why donât you sit for a while?â\nããâNo. I want to continue.â\nããAfter two hours of rehabilitation in the morning, he gritted his teeth in pain when he went home. When he got off the car at home, Li Xia saw him like that and picked him up and carried him back into the house.\nããâTake your time, donât be too anxious. Now that youâre awake, itâs only a matter of time before you get back to normal.â\nããHe had given up the unnecessary embarrassment of being carried like a princess by a woman, and nodded to her with a grateful smile. Li Xia got him some water to wash up, and then handed him two property certificates. Facing his puzzled eyes, she began to explain.\nããâThe money your father sent, 30,000 is in Huihuiâs name. His grandmother said to keep it for his education. This is your 20,000. I bought you a house. The house will be valuable in the future, so itâs better than keeping it in the bank. Your uncle sued me for your custody. I canât contact your father, so I can only transfer the house to my name first. In case he really wins the lawsuit for your custody, the house in my name can delay the time.â\nããShen Haiyang nodded. Although she didnât say it clearly, he could figure out the truth from her words. He knew his uncleâs personality. He was fighting for his custody just for money. His mother found him a wife, probably to protect him. She had worked hard these days. Not only did she take care of the father and son, but she also had to do everything she could to protect their property.\nããâWhen you feel better, weâll transfer the house to you. After thatâ¦â\nããâBrother Haiyang, are you really awake?â\nããZhang Qiuhua interrupted her mid-sentence. The woman rushed across the living room and into the bedroom. Seeing that Shen Haiyang had indeed woken up, she excitedly ran to the bedside and threw herself on him.\nããLi Xia reached out to pull her, âHe just woke up and you are rushing at him. Do you know how frail he is? He canât stand your rush.â\nããThe woman was pulled away by her, and did not notice the grateful look of Shen Haiyang looking at Li Xia on the bed. She was very dissatisfied with this move and started yelling at Li Xia directly.\nããâWhat are you doing? Brother Haiyang has watched me grow up since I was a child. I treat him like my own brother. Iâm happy that he wakes upâ¦â\nããâHeâs sore all over from the rehabilitation he did this morning. Donât add to his burden.â\nããâOh,â the woman replied softly, shyly, and turned to give Shen Haiyang a charming smile. âIâm sorry, Brother Haiyang, I didnât know you were doing rehabilitation. Is it very tiring to do rehabilitation? Can I go with you tomorrow?â\nããLi Xia, who had experienced this, could see what this person was up to, but she didnât say anything. She turned around and went out to cook first, as the children would be back soon.\nããâNo need, as long as she accompanies me.â\nããâLi Xia, sheâs from the countryside and doesnât know anything. Itâs better for me to accompany you.â\nããâSheâs very nice and knows everything.â\nããââ¦â\nããâIf you have nothing to do, please go out. I want to get some sleep.â\nããShen Haiyang didnât say anything more. This simple sentence made Zhang Qiuhua shut up immediately. She stood there for a while, not knowing what to say. Shen Haiyang asked her to leave. She felt dizzy when she walked out of the hall.\nããLi Xia was in high spirits while cooking in the kitchen after hearing his words. It felt so good to have someone to recognize her efforts and to protect her when she was despised by others. It was like seeing flowers blooming on branches and butterflies fluttering in.\nããFor lunch, She made him nutritious fish soup, carp tofu, side dishes and rice. The man ate very well, and the two children also liked it very much.\nããAfter eating, she stood up to clean up, and Huihua followed. Li Xia left with a pile of dishes. The girl handed Shen Haiyang a towel and hesitated before calling him.\nããâDaddy wipe your mouth.â\nããShen Haiyang was stunned for a moment, but soon reacted. He smiled gently at the little girl and reached out to touch her little head. âThank you.â\nããâIt doesnât matter.â\nããShen Hui who was beside rubbed his fatherâs legs, looked up and said to him, âWe often work together to take care of you. Huihua was very careful and cleaned your legs very well.â\nããâThank you for your hard work.â The man looked at the child apologetically, âIâll take you guys out to play when Daddy recovers. Where do you want to go?â\nããâMy mom said she wants to take me to the zoo to see tigers.â Shen Hui was very eager when he talked about this: âDad, should we go with mom orâ¦â\nãâweâll talk about it then.â\nããâAll right.â\nããShen Hui was looking forward to reuniting with his parents, but he didnât see his mother for a few days after Shen Haiyang woke up. He was angry at the school gate after school and thought she was lying.\nããLi Xia had been taking care of his father before he woke up. After he woke up, she stopped selling steamed buns and focused on accompanying him in his rehabilitation, making all kinds of delicious food to nourish his body. His biological mother said she was taking care of his father, but she hadnât been seen for several days.\nããâBrother, whatâs wrong with you?â\nããHuiHua asked quietly, knowing that he was unhappy. Shen Hui shook his head, looked at her and whispered, âYou call my dad dad, do you want my dad to live with your mom?â\nããâGrandma told me to call him that when they got married.â\nããâMy mother said their marriage didnât count at all, and that they were not registered and had no protection.â\nããâWhat do you mean by registration? Isnât that what marriage is all about? You put up a wedding sign and invite people to dinner. My mom and your dad both wear the bride and groomâs clothes.â\nããShen Hui couldnât be fooled by the innocent words of the little girl. He was still young and heard everything from adults. He longed for his biological mother but also blamed her. He lowered his head and said nothing more. When he went home and saw Li Xia cooking in the kitchen, he quietly asked his father if he would be with his mother in the future.\nããâMom promised to take good care of you. She said that stepmother only took care of you for your money. The three of us are a family. Uncle also said that she bought the house to transfer your money. She canât be trusted without blood relationship.â\nããâDonât worry about adult matters, Daddy is awake now, and he will take care of these things in the future.â\nããâOkay. Iâll follow Dad anyway.â\nããThe little guy stayed close to his father and was always close to his kind father. Shen Haiyang touched his sonâs head and looked at the drawer not far away. There were photos taken when he married his ex-wife, and his mind was filled with the memories left after the accident.\nããFor dinner, Li Xia cooked pork ribs and lotus root soup for him. âEat as much as you can. Stop if you feel uncomfortable.â\nããâOkay I will.â\nããLi Xia was so busy that she forgot about the court session the next day. When she was washing dishes at night, her daughter asked her quietly: âMom, can we still live here in the future? You said you were moving before, so are we still moving?â\nããShe squatted down and kissed her daughter to reassure her: âThis house is already ours. No one can evict us from the house under momâs name. You donât have to worry about that. If there is no storefront, mom will continue to sell buns from a cart. Donât worry, mom can support you.â\nããâReally? This house is ours.â\nããâYes, this house is ours.â\nããâOh, then Iâm relieved.â The little girl has a simple mind. As long as she is sure that the house is habitable and her mother is still with her, she has nothing to worry about. As for the rest, those are the adultsâ business and she just needs to be obedient.\n",

After sending him to the hospital the next day and asking the doctor to issue a certificate, she turned around and left for the court.\n　　The uncle also consulted a lawyer for this lawsuit, and bribed Li Xia’s neighbors to give false testimony for him. He felt that he had a sure win in the lawsuit, and proudly raised his head at the door of the court.\n　　”Humph, as long as I can prove that you didn’t fulfill your responsibility to take good care of him, the court will definitely give my nephew to me. Then all his money will be mine.”\n　　He only thought about this secretly without saying anything. His wife whispered beside him: “It would be great if we could get Huihui’s custody as well. Thirty thousand, all in this kid’s name.”\n　　”We need to go to Shen Haiyang first. Twenty thousand, twenty thousand. There are a few millionaires nowadays. If we win the lawsuit, we can become one in no time.”\n　　”That’s right. By then, we will be outstanding figures in the provincial capital.”\n　　As they were talking, they saw Li Xia coming over on her bike and immediately looked at her with pride. Li Xia parked her bike and went up the steps.\nHe couldn’t wait to vent his anger. He was always criticized by her, and now that he can take his nephew away from her, she must be very anxious, right?\n　　”My sister-in-law gave you that house because she asked you to take care of Haiyang. Now Haiyang has me to take care of him and you are no longer needed. Please vacate the house as soon as possible.”\n　　”That’s right, you two should go back to where you came from. People from the countryside should farm in the countryside. The city is not the place for you. It would be more suitable for you to go back to your hometown and dig dirt.”\n　　This, this didn’t sound like what he should say before the trial, but rather it sounded like he had won the case hence saying such. Li Xia wasn’t angry at the sarcastic words, she just stood there and looked at them like fools.\n　　”Shen Haiyang has woken up and can make his own decisions. The guardianship issue no longer exists. What are you two dreaming about?”\n　　”What?”\n　　”You’re talking nonsense.” The uncle was furious and tried to pull her back, but she pushed him away. “How could he wake up? The doctor said he wouldn’t live long…”\n　　”Shut your stinky mouth.” Li Xia interrupted his own fantasy and pointed at her neighbors who had just arrived. “You can ask them whether what I said is true or not, and see if I am lying to you.”\n　　The neighbors who were bribed to make false testimony were devastated. They could not earn money this time. If they had known, they should have asked him to pay first. Now that Shen Haiyang has woken up, there is no need to fight the lawsuit. They went to look for him two days ago but couldn’t find him. Today, they thought about it and decided to go to the court.\n　　Seeing them nod, Uncle Shen almost fell down in shock. His wife held him up, and the old couple looked at each other in silence, as if they had lost their parents.\n　　Shen Haiyang woke up, and the lawsuit about his guardian was dropped. The plaintiff and the defendant came out of the court together, and the uncle and aunt looked at Li Xia’s upright body and trembled with jealousy.\n　　”Don’t be too proud. My nephew is a top student and a cadre. He won’t marry a country woman like you.”\n　　”Yes. Just wait to be kicked out.”\n　　Li Xia turned around and looked at them with contempt. “Do you two think that everyone in the world is the same as you two? You stink like the shit in the toilet, and you think the whole world is shit?”\n　　”you,”\n　　”Don’t be so stubborn. I’m waiting for you to be kicked out.”\n　　”Then wait and see. But be careful and don’t get mad at yourself to death. If you get mad at yourself to death, there will be no compensation.”\n　　”You, you woman…”\n　　Whatever they wanted to say, Li Xia had already walked away, and no one could hear them. They were so angry that they stamped their feet on the ground. All their plans had gone to waste, and they felt regretful and angry.\n　　”Husband, what should we do next?”\n　　”Go shopping and buy some nutritional supplements suitable for the patient.”\n　　”What?”\n　　”I need to have a good talk with Haiyang.”\n　　The woman rolled her eyes and said, “Okay.”\n　　Li Xia returned to the hospital from the court to pick up Shen Haiyang. As soon as she entered, she saw that his forehead was covered with sweat, which flowed down his cheeks and into his neck. She quickly took a towel to wipe it for him.\n　　It was almost time, so she packed up and went home. On the way, Shen Haiyang asked her where she had been, and she replied, “Your Uncle sued me for not taking good care of you, and he wanted custody of you. The trial was held today, so I went to the court. After I explained the situation, the case was dropped.”\n　　”Did he often pick on you during the time I was unconscious? I’m sorry, thank you for your hard work.”\n　　”It’s okay.” Li Xia turned around and smiled, “By the way, Murong Danling is suing for custody of Shen Hui, and the trial is about to begin.”\n　　After that, the two of them stopped talking. It was inappropriate to discuss this on the street. Li Xia originally planned to go home and talk to him in detail. When she arrived at the yard, she happened to meet Han Jun. She poured tea for them and let them talk.\n　　Seeing her turn to leave, Han Jun opened up and told him everything that had happened during the time he was in trouble. Shen Haiyang felt deeply ashamed of his mother. At the end of her life, he not only failed to fulfill his filial duty as a son, but also made her worry.\n　　”My mother, was she in a lot of pain and discomfort at that time?”\n　　”To be honest, I don’t know. I only found out that she was ill after you remarried. Li Xia took care of her during her last days. She also took care of the funeral.”\n　　Shen Haiyang stopped talking and looked towards the side room where his mother lived. Han Jun patted him on the shoulder to comfort him and told him about Shen Hui’s custody.\n　　”Thirty thousand dollars is in the child’s name. It would be tempting for anyone to have such a huge sum of money. What are you going to do now?”\n　　”If she wants to sue, she can. She didn’t want the child when she divorced me, so it’s not that easy to get it now.”\n　　”The most important thing is your son. The little guy has been coaxed by Murong Danling these days and has become very close to her. He always wants to be with his parents.”\n　　”Don’t worry, I have a way.”\n　　Han Jun smiled easily, “That’s right. Now that you’re awake, these aren’t a big deal. Li Xia and I don’t have to worry about our hair turning gray.”\n　　”You and Li Xia?”\n　　”Hey, buddy, what were you thinking? You were unconscious, and your mom asked me to help them.”\n　　”Thank you very much.”\n　　He thanked her sincerely. Han Jun glanced out the window, then leaned close to him and whispered, “Looking at your expression, have you accepted this wife?”\n　　”It’s none of your business.”\n　　”Why are you still so shy with me?”\n　　”Han Jun.”\n　　”Okay, I won’t ask anymore.”\n　　He had a meal of millet rice at his good brother’s place for lunch, and ate a piece of the chicken stewed for Shen Haiyang. After eating and drinking, he got up and left, repeatedly reminding him to come to him if he needed anything.\n　　”I know. I won’t be polite with you.”\n　　The two grew up together and had a very close relationship. Han Jun said goodbye and left. Li Xia took out the remaining foreign exchange coupons and her spending bills for the money and showed them to Shen Haiyang.\n　　”With mom’s funeral, shopping, and the house, you only have less than 2,000 left out of the 20,000 yuan in your name. I see your clothes don’t fit you anymore, so I thought I’d go buy you some fabric this afternoon to make you some clothes. I don’t have any tickets, so if I want to buy anything, I’ll have to use foreign exchange coupons to go to the Foreign Trade Market.”\n　　Shen Haiyang didn’t look at the money, he just glanced at the bill for his mother’s funeral. He pushed the money to her and said, “Just take charge of the household affairs. Don’t just bring it for me, bring for you three too.”\n　　Li Xia was very happy that he respected her so much. She put away all the things and money, leaving only a few bills for the afternoon. She poured him a glass of water, and the two of them sat together. He asked about his mother, and she told him about the old lady.\n　　” She just worry about you two. She was very peaceful when she passed away. She said she wanted to eat meat and she ate it and died then.”\n　　”Thank you.”\n　　”you have said these two words countless times since you woke up.” Li Xia smiled and pointed at the space they were in : “This house has been transferred to my name, and my daughter and I have registered our household registration. That’s all. In return I plan to take care of you for the rest of your lives.”\n　　The man also smiled, his eyes full of warmth. “You seemed to have said before that we were moving?”\n　　”Yes. I bought a courtyard house in Dongcheng. I showed you the property certificate just now. It’s right next to the street. The south house has a door at the back so I can do business on the street. I plan to open a breakfast shop.”\n　　”When are we moving?”\n　　What does he mean? Continue to live with her, or… Stop it, she stopped thinking. Maybe he just wanted to thank her for taking care of him during this period of time and gave her the south house for her business.\n　　”Let’s talk about it when you’re almost recovered.”\n　　After chatting for a while, she put away the things he needed and went out. She bought a lot of things in the foreign trade mall. Now it is winter, and she has to take care of everything from inside to outside. She bought pure cotton underwear, cotton, cloth, hats, shoes and socks, wool, and all kinds of things to replace.\n　　She bought enough cloth for the children to make a set of clothes, and bought autumn clothes for the three children. She spent all the money she brought with her. When she got home, Shen Haiyang asked her why she didn’t buy anything for herself.\n　　”You’ve taken care of everything, but you forgot about yourself? How come you’re like my mother, always putting yourself last?” When he talked about his mother, his eyes were full of warmth. Suddenly he thought of something and asked, “Did you use all  your foreign exchange coupons?”\n　　”No. It’s almost two thousand. How can I use it all up by buying some clothes? I have clothes, so I don’t need to buy more.”\n　　She bent down to get the wool. At that time, the wool was all loose, so one person had to help hold it up and one person had to wrap it into a ball to make it convenient for knitting a sweater. Shen Haiyang took the initiative to help her hold it up as a rack, and she started chatting with him.\n　　”I bought one for my son, too, using your foreign exchange coupons…”\n　　”I told you, you can make your own decisions on these, you don’t have to tell me or explain it.”\n　　”Thanks.”\n　　The two thanked each other, looked up and smiled shyly. During the chat, Li Xia’s story came up, and she explained how she got divorced and came to his house.\n　　”If you miss your son, why don’t you bring him to your side?”\n　　”It’s good for him to follow his father.”\n　　The sensitive topic was dropped after a word, and the two of them were silent in the room, with only the sound of the yarn winding echoing in their ears. The sun shone diagonally on the two of them through the window glass, one standing and the other sitting, connected by the flowing yarn in the middle.\n　　”Hey, it seems you’ve recovered well. You can even play knitting now.”\n　　When the leader of Shen Haiyang’s unit heard the news, he came to visit. Li Xia quickly packed up and let the guest sit down. She poured tea for him and was busy cooking. When the meal was ready, the leader left. She saw him out the door and came back to ask Shen Haiyang excitedly if he could go to work after he recovered.\n　　”yes.”\n　　”That’s great. Life is back on track. We were able to transfer our household registration because of you. Now that you’re well, there won’t be any changes, right?”\n　　”Won’t.”\n　　”I can rest assured then.”\n　　”When will the court hearing for Huihui’s custody case begin?”\n　　”The day after tomorrow. I was just about to discuss with you what to do about this matter. Do you want to go find her and have a good talk?”\n　　”What was your original plan?”\n　　”If you were still in vegetative state like that before, I would have definitely lost the lawsuit. Huihui’s custody and guardianship would have gone to her, and the savings under Huihui’s name would also be under her control. So I used your money to buy a house to give Huihui a backup plan. The investment of a house is more cost-effective than bank interest. With these two houses, the child can do whatever he wants in the future, and his grandmother won’t have to worry im the heaven.”\n　　Shen Haiyang opened his mouth to thank her, but then smiled and said nothing. She cared so much about them and their future, and had planned everything clearly. Such thoughts and efforts could not be expressed with just a word of thanks.\n　　”No need to look for her. I’ll see her in court.”\n　　”Okay, I’ll rent you a wheelchair at the hospital and push you there.”\n　　A few days later, the court opened. When Murong Danling saw her ex-husband at the door of the court, her mouth dropped open in shock. She had not been in the city for a while because her son asked her to take care of the man. She wanted to get the custody by trickery. When did this man wake up?\n　　Li Xia looked down at Shen Haiyang, and the man pointed at the door and told her to go in. They didn’t say anything outside the court, but when the court opened, Shen Haiyang’s appearance changed things drastically. Originally, he had no capacity to act, so the biological mother was more qualified for custody. Now that he has recovered, it is better for the child to stay where he is after comparing all aspects.\n　　”After the divorce, the child has been with me. His mother had given up custody at that time. I have basically recovered now and will be able to go back to work after two months of rehabilitation. I will take good care of my son and give him a healthy family.”\n　　Shen Haiyang made his speech, and then it was Murong Danling’s turn. She looked at the judge, her body trembling slightly, and calmed down before speaking to fight for it.\n　　”I had difficulties with the divorce. Now I have no problem. Of course it is better for the child to be with his mother. I am the mother, and the child needs motherly love the most when he is so young.”\n　　Shen Haiyang retorted, getting straight to the point: “You are now living in a dormitory with your colleagues. How can you raise a child under such circumstances?”\n　　”My son and I have so much money in our names. Why can’t we use some of it to buy a house for us to live in? My son’s money must be used to make his life comfortable.”\n　　The court adjourned for mediation in the middle of the trial, and the judge was clearly more inclined to maintain the situation. The child was originally with his father, and now his father has woken up, and his conditions are far better than her mother’s in all aspects.\n　　Murong Danling was furious and started arguing with the judge. She felt that they were biased towards the rich. “My son is rich. As long as he is mine, I will arrange a good life for him and me. Thirty thousand dollars is enough to buy a house, save money and earn interest. Do I have to worry about it for the rest of my life? I can support him.”\n　　Haha, is this you raising him or he raising you? The mediators stopped talking. This kind of custody lawsuit is based on what is better for the child. Now it seems that it is definitely better for the child to stay with his father. The 30,000 yuan education fund will not be touched, and his father has a house and a job to provide for his living.\n　　The court will be adjourned for three days.\n　　Murong Danling knew that she had made a bad start, so she ran straight to Shen Haiyang after leaving the court.\n　　”Haiyang, I, are you feeling well now?”\n　　Murong Danling is very beautiful, like a rose with thorns. She is bold and open-minded. She didn’t want to go to the countryside at first, but she met Shen Haiyang, an only child. She fell into his arms in public for the first time, creating the illusion that they were very intimate. Then she took the initiative to use public opinion to quickly take him down, and got married quickly to avoid going to the countryside.\n　　After he got into trouble, she left without hesitation. She would not be tied to a loser. Before, she was provoked by his uncle and she flattered for the money. Now that he has recovered, her thoughts became more greedy. The father and son have 50,000 US dollars. One is her son, and the other is her son’s father. With so much wealth, of course she has to enjoy it.\n　　”Please get out of the way. I have to go home. If you have anything to say, let’s talk about it in court.”\n　　”Haiyang, why are you talking to me like that? I’m your wife…”\n　　”Ex-wife.”\n　　Interrupting her pretentious performance, Shen Haiyang’s usually gentle face turned very cold. Murong Danling seemed to be frozen by his cold attitude, and her lips moved several times without saying anything. In the past, when he was unhappy, she could ease his mood by acting coquettishly, but now, looking at his cold eyes, coupled with this awkward location and relationship, she really didn’t know how to treat him for a moment.\n　　Seeing that he had no interest in chatting with his ex-wife, Li Xia immediately pushed him to her tricycle. She lifted him up and put the wheelchair away before riding the bike in front.\n　　”Hey, Haiyang…”\n　　Her action was so quick that Murong Danling only saw the rear of the cart when she looked up in anger. She chased for a few steps and stopped, stamping her feet in anger. US dollars, US dollars. Her ex-husband, who was shining like a golden child, was dragged away by someone. She felt so distressed that it seemed to be bleeding. She stood there anxiously, with no idea what to do.\n　　Li Xia didn’t say a word about the couple’s affairs. After she settled him down at home, she went to the kitchen to cook. In the evening, when the two children came back, Huihua came to help her roll out the dough and make dumplings.\n　　”My brother has been called in for a talk. Mom, what do you say…oh, what should I call him now?”\n　　”Who?”\n　　”My brother’s father. I called him dad before, but my brother said your marriage doesn’t count. What should I call him now?”\n　　This kid has really been sweet taught well by his mother. Li Xia was also troubled by this, but now was not the right time to ask Shen Haiyang. If she asked this as soon as he woke up, it would look like she was forcing him to get married.\n　　”Don’t say anything yet. Wait until he’s fully recovered. If it doesn’t count, we’ll stay here and they’ll move out. If it counts but he doesn’t want to, then we’ll divorce and they’ll move out. Don’t be afraid. We have a household registration and a house anyway, so we’re not afraid of anything.”\n　　”Okay.” The mother has confidence and everything sorted out so the child also feels safe. She has been very happy learning to paint recently. After asking this, she became concerned about Shen Hui’s custody. “He will still follow his father in the future, right?”\n　　”I think so.”\n　　”Where’s my brother? I haven’t seen him for a long time. I miss him a little.”\n　　”Next week, Mom will make some clothes for your brother and I’ll take you to give them to him.”\n　　”Okay.”\n　　The mother’s eyes were firm and her words were gentle, and the little girl felt very safe following her mother. The mother and daughter were chatting here to strengthen the parent-child relationship, and Shen Haiyang and his son were also chatting in the room over there.\n　　After the dumplings were wrapped, Li Xia boiled water to put them in, while HuiHua obediently peeled and mashed garlic. When cleaning up and serving the meal, she found that Shen Hui’s eyes were a little red, as if he had cried. She didn’t know what Shen Haiyang said to his son.\n　　Li Xia served the dumplings, which were stuffed with pork, cabbage and green onions, to the father and son. “Eat them quickly. Even though there is not much meat, they have the taste of meat, so they are meat dumplings.”\n　　Shen Haiyang smiled and thanked her, looking up at his son. Shen Hui, who had been distant from Li Xia recently, looked up and said obediently: “Thank you.”\n　　”It’s okay, eat quickly.”\n　　The family of four ate in silence, and before they had finished, an uninvited guest arrived. Seeing his uncle and his wife, Li Xia really wanted to use a broom to drive them out. She looked back at Shen Haiyang, and the man motioned for her to eat first.\n　　Its his relative is he going to solve it himself? No matter what, Li Xia decided not to intervene for the time being. She lowered her head to eat as if she didn’t see anything.\n      He didn’t say a word when his uncle greeted Shen Haiyang. For a moment, the old couple’s face turned red and white.\n　　”Hey, nephew, you are so rude.”\n　　Shen Haiyang remained silent, lowering his head and eating slowly. As the host, no matter how thick-skinned his uncle was, he didn’t know what to do. The couple was left alone, holding gifts like begging for favors. For a moment, he was embarrassed and waited until the others finished their meal and cleared the table before Shen Haiyang finally spoke.\n　　”No one comes to visit you for no reason. What are you doing at this time, uncle?”\n　　”Here…” He saw Li Xia carrying the dishes to the kitchen, and immediately sat next to Shen Haiyang with a thick face. “Nephew, don’t be fooled by this woman. She is two-faced and unfilial, and extremely rude to the elders. But she is not as good as Danling, and Danling is your son’s biological mother…”\n　　The old man spoke out what he had rehearsed in advance like a script, and Shen Haiyang sat and listened to him. Originally, he could not play a big role in this matter, so he just ignored him, but after hearing him slander Li Xia, the man could not help but refute him.\n　　”It’s been almost half a year, and she has been taking care of my son and me. She accompanied my mother to her death, wearing mourning clothes. I don’t know where your so-called disrespect for elders comes from. As for Murong Danling, I divorced her a long time ago. If you come to me and talk about her again, don’t blame me for kicking you out.”\n　　”No, nephew, you were deceived by that woman. She stayed to take care of you for your house, job, and household registration. She also used your money to buy a house for herself. She is not a good person at all.”\n　　”If she’s not a good person, then who is? You?” Shen Haiyang was annoyed and didn’t bother to talk nonsense with him anymore. He pointed at the door and sent him away directly: “The door is over there, just leave by yourself. Don’t come here in the future, we’ll sever our relationship from now on.”\n　　“You, you…”\n　　”Haiyang .. Uncle is doing this for your own good. Don’t be fooled.”\n　　As they were talking, Murong Danling appeared at the door. It was unknown whether she had just arrived or the two had colluded. Shen Haiyang was more inclined to the latter. These two were too shameless. When he was unconscious, they tried to defraud their father and son of their money. Now that he was awake, they still wanted to do it? Did they treat him as a fool or a soft persimmon?\n　　”Don’t you feel embarrassed to say this? There are so many people in this courtyard, and everyone has seen what she did. You slander her and throw dirty water on her like this, aren’t you afraid of being struck by lightning?”\n　　He believed Li Xia without a doubt, which made Murong Danling, who had prepared a lot of words to persuade him but had no chance to speak, angry and gnashed her teeth. He was so good to her when they first got married, how could he trust another woman so much now.\n　　”Who is she? She is just a woman who covets your house. How dare you side with her like this?”\n　　My uncle also agreed: “Yes. She just wants your house and money…”\n　　”Shut up.” Shen Haiyang interrupted them harshly, looking at Murong Danling and speaking firmly. “She is my wife, and I should stand by her. You are standing in my house and accusing my wife. You are too confused. What qualifications do you have to criticize her? This is her home.”\n　　”I,”\n　　Murong Danling was so angered by his words that her face was horrible. She bit her lip and trembled with excitement, forgetting the speech she had prepared. The uncle next to her was thick-skinned and calmed down first.\n　　”Nephew, she’s a country girl who doesn’t know anything. Do you really want a wife like her? Danling is pretty, a city girl, and Huihui’s biological mother. How can you want a country girl like Li Xia as your wife ? Is that bitch threatening you? I tell you, you haven’t registered yet, so you’re not considered husband and wife at all.”\n　　”Haiyang, are you really threatened?” Murong Danling was reminded by her uncle’s words and quickly calmed down: “Don’t be afraid of her. We will all testify for you, don’t be threatened by her. She is a rural woman…”\n　　”Shut up.”\n　　Seeing that he was really angry, Murong Danling lost her voice after being yelled at by him. She stood there with her face turning pale and dark. She turned her head to look at her son and then moved her gaze to Shen Haiyang.\n　　”We three are a family. Haiyang, what’s wrong with you? Have you forgotten how happy you were when I was pregnant with Huihui? I was in so much pain in the delivery room when I gave birth, and you said you would treat me well in the future. Now that Li Xia has only been around for a short time, have you forgotten all your promises to me?”\n　　Good move, the uncle appreciated this in his heart. Shen Haiyang is soft-hearted and plays the family card\n　　Most suitable. As expected, when the woman said this, Shen Haiyang sighed deeply. But just when he thought Shen Haiyang was being controlled by Murong Danling, the man put Murong Danling on the fire as soon as he opened his mouth.\n　　”We have made vows to each other since we were first married, and you even gave birth to my son after ten months of pregnancy. I should not forget that. But Li Xia took good care of my son and me during the time when I was a vegetative, and she also took care of my mother until her death. I cannot treat her unfairly. How about this, since you care about our love, then give the property under my and Huihui’s names to Li Xia, and we will go with you, do you think it’s okay?”\n　　Murong Danling was stunned for a moment. Things were a little beyond her expectations. After living together for a few years, she knew that Shen Haiyang looked gentle but was never weak and could not be bullied. She knew that he valued feelings, so she played the emotional card. Sure enough, he looked very emotional, but the words he said were too hot for her to handle.\n　　”She already has a household registration and housing, so there’s no need to give her that much money.”\n　　”Since she has gained so many benefits, why don’t I stay and let her take care of me while you take Huihui and the savings away?”\n　　”Well… no, I mean…”\n　　Murong Danling spoke too fast, and she didn’t hold back and spoke out her heart. That’s what she thought. She covered her mouth anxiously, and fell into his trap without paying attention. Is it too late to make amends now? She was about to speak, but she was met with Shen Haiyang’s disdainful smile.\n　　”Do you think I’m stupid?”\n　　He was stupid, but he was more clever than a monkey when he got close to her. She tried to trick him with words, but Murong Danling knew that her trick had failed. Before he got into accident, their relationship had been getting worse year by year. He didn’t want his mother to worry about him, so he basically didn’t quarrel with her, so everyone thought they were doing well.\n　　Later, when he was in accident, she divorced and abandoned them father and son. What should she say now to soften his heart and make him forgive her previous actions?\n　　Murong Danling thought quickly. In her eyes, this father and son were now shining golden. She didn’t want to give up so easily no matter what.\n　　”Huihui, Mommy promised to take you to the zoo. Can you tell Daddy that we can go together tomorrow?”\n　　She failed to win the father, so she turned her attention to her son. Shen Hui looked up at her, then stood behind his father without saying a word. Seeing that the father and son could not be won over for the time being, Murong Danling decided to fight again another day. Things cannot be rushed, otherwise it will be even more difficult to turn things around if things get awkward. Children can be coaxed, this is her own son, she believes she can coax him.\n　　”You misunderstood mom… Never mind, you are still young and don’t understand many things. Mom will leave first and come to see you in a few days.”\n　　Seeing that the ally he had found left because the situation was not right, the uncle was so anxious that he didn’t hold him back. He turned around and wanted to say something to Shen Haiyang, but was stopped by the other party. Knowing what the old man was thinking, he opened his mouth to block the other party’s words. Don’t say it out loud and make things difficult for others.\n　　”Li Xia is the daughter-in-law of the Shen family. My mother witnessed the wedding and worshipped the heaven, earth and ancestors. The only thing missing from the de facto marriage is a marriage certificate. I will go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get it tomorrow. She took care of my mother until her death and wore mourning clothes. She is the daughter-in-law of our Shen family. You slander my wife in my house, then I should serve you with the big broom.”\n　　Shen Hui handed his father a broom, and Shen Haiyang raised his hand to chase him away. The uncle did not expect him to have such an attitude, and they were immediately humiliated.\n",

In the eyes of outsiders, the Shen family finally had a leader to support the family. It was not that Li Xia could not support it, but it was a problem of recognition from others.\nããThe uncle knew that he would never get the tens of thousands of dollars, and the most important thing now was to repair his relationship with his nephew. When he was kicked out by his nephew, he smiled at Li Xia and called her âniece-in-lawâ affectionately again.\nããâDonât be angry, niece-in-law. Iâm justâ¦ Hey, you think Iâm old and confused, donât bother with me.â\nããLi Xia heard what Shen Haiyang said just now, and it was really funny for a moment. The old lady had given her a wedding banquet to justify her, but these people still wanted to overthrow her and snatch these two helpless golden babies. Now that Shen Haiyang said he wanted to get the marriage certificate, these people immediately changed their faces, which shows how important it is to have a legitimate name.\nããâIf you are old and confused, just go home and rest. Donât talk nonsense to me.â\nããUnexpectedly, she was so unreasonable that the uncle and aunt lost face. Their faces turned red like pig livers. Standing there in a dilemma, they looked at Shen Haiyang, hoping that he would give them some face, but the man pointed directly at the door.\nããâPlease go. My wife has already seen you off. What are you waiting for?â\nããShen Haiyangâs voice was as gentle and soft as his personality, like a breeze blowing over the hills. However, this feeling was different for different people. Li Xia was overjoyed, while his uncle felt a chill on his back. He glanced at his nephew and chose to leave first.\nããâWell, then weâll leave first and come back to see you tomorrow. Haiyang, just rest and recuperate. If you need any help, just call me.â\nããThe man had already walked out of the house while talking. The aunt stepped behind and turned back to Li Xia and said with a smile: âMy niece-in-law , I have a lot of pickled cabbage. I will send you some tomorrow. You are busy selling buns every day and probably donât have time to pickle vegetables. I also have Chinese mustard greens and other things. I will give them to you.â\nããâKeep it for yourself.â\nããOf course, Li Xia didnât appreciate her kindness, and she was dragged away by her uncle. The crowd watching the excitement outside the house laughed without disguising, and the two of them lowered their heads like mice crossing the street, not daring to raise them, and left the Shen family in shame.\nããEveryone was laughing at the fact that all the uncleâs plans had come to nothing. God still had eyes, Shen Haiyang woke up in time, so donât be ill-intentioned all day long.\nããâHe teamed up with Shen Huiâs mother to get rid of Shen Hui. He happened to eat the Shen familyâs extinction. This man is so evil. Fortunately, Old lady Shen found a wife for her son before she left, so that the family could be saved.â\nããâOf course. When Brother Haiyang got into trouble, his ex wife divorced him and left. She didnât even come to see the child. I heard that the son has become rich, and hence she came to take him away from here.â\nããâLuckily Haiyang woke up, otherwise that woman would have succeeded. After all, they are mother and son, and the blood relationship cannot be broken. The child is also young and easy to coax. When the money is in her hand, she wonât have to worry about anything in my life.â\nããâMy cousin works in the same unit as her. I heard that she recently found a partner. The two of them are looking for a house to buy. They donât like the three- or five-room houses and want to buy a house with a big yard.â\nããâThis is just already planning to spend the money even before she got it.â\nããShen Haiyang heard the noises of the onlookersâ discussions. Shen Hui stood by with a pale face and biting his lips. The man patted his shoulder and said nothing. The little guy looked at his father and tears fell. Then he raised his hand to wipe it, and silently lowered his head to get water for his father to wash.\nããThe little guy stood straight with a stubborn and strong expression on his face. He helped his father brush his teeth and wash his face, and helped him sit on the bed. Then he was broken by a gentle hug from his father, and burst into tears on his broad chest.\nããShen Haiyang gently patted his sonâs back and let him digest the complicated emotions by himself. The child was not stupid, he was just young and simply longed for love.\nããâOkay, now that youâre done crying, remember your lesson and go to sleep.â\nããâDad, give you the money in my name. I donât want it anymore.â\nããâDo you know how much that is?â\nããâI donât want it no matter how much it is. Once I have nothing, so they wonât rob me.â\nããA man is innocent but he is guilty of possessing a treasure. Having too much wealth that makes people jealous without the ability to match it will bring nothing but troubles. Sometimes it will even bring danger. After all, it is not uncommon for a family to be wiped out.\nããThe money Shen Hui had received was left to him by his grandmother, and it was meant to be an education fund for the child after he turned 18. Now that Shen Haiyang was the childâs guardian, he had control over the money.\nããHe transferred his worries to his father and didnât want to see adults doing anything for money anymore.\nããBecause of what happened that night, the two of them felt a little awkward that night. Li Xia didnât mention anything about the registration, and after she took care of him and put him to bed, she also went to sleep on the small bed beside him.\nããIn the quiet night, she was thinking about when she could reopen her steamed bun shop. Everything else is fake, only when you have the ability can you have the choice.\nããâWhat are you thinking about?â\nããSuddenly he asked, and she turned around and said, âIâm thinking about opening out the breakfast stall. By the way, can I use the south room of your house? Iâll pay the rent.â\nããThe man laughed softly in the dark night: âIâll give it to you, no rent required. Not only the south room, but the whole yard is yours. Itâs under your name now.â\nããâIâm keeping it for safekeeping.â\nããâThen Iâll give you a it you now.â\nããLi Xia was so excited by these words that she sat up: âAre you serious?â\nããThe man looked at her with a smile: âReally.â\nããâNo, no,â she shook her head hurriedly, âIâm not that greedy. I just want to rent a good location to open a small shop.â\nããâThatâs great. Itâs an honor to earn money with your own hands. Then start working. This house is just right for you.â\nããâNo, Shen Haiyang, why are you teasing me?â\nããâI am teasing you? Am Iâ¦going to get the marriage certificate tomorrow?â After saying that, seeing her staring with wide eyes without saying anything, he cleared his throat and continued, âMy conditions are not bad, are they? You were happy when I was lying there, but now that Iâm well, youâre not happy?â\nããâIâm a rural woman who didnât even graduate from junior high school. If you really marry me, wonât you regret it later?â\nããâNo regrets.â\nããâIf I donât get married, will I be unable to use your house?â After a while, without waiting for his answer, she continued, âLetâs get married. After we get married, I donât have to pay rent for you. Iâm getting a great deal.â\nããShe lay down to sleep after saying that, and made a quick decision. Shen Haiyang looked at her back and smiled secretly, liking her straightforward nature.\nããThe next day, before going to rehabilitation, they went to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get their marriage certificate. This time, they became a legally recognized couple. They got their marriage certificate and their household registration was combined into one book. When the family members of the patients in the hospital asked her who he was, she could openly say that he was her husband.\nããâItâs not easy. Itâs hard to take care of a vegetative person. Youâve managed to wake him up. It wonât take long for him to be like a normal person.â\nããWhen Shen Haiyang heard this, he turned around and smiled at her, then said to the old lady who asked the question, âWell, my wife has worked hard, and I am blessed.â\nããââââ\nããLittle boy Shen Hui thought he could have some peace and quiet now that he had no money, but the next day he was blocked by his mother at the school gate. âHui Hui, Hui Hui, donât run away.â\nããHis mother grabbed his arm and he looked up at the sky helplessly. âAll my money has been transferred to my fatherâs name.â\nããMurong Danling was stunned for a moment, but recovered quickly. âMy child, I came to see you because I missed you. Donât keep talking about money. We are mother and son, and we are inseparable.â\nããâSo what are you going to do?â\nããâMom, will take you to the cafeteria to eat dumplings. Donât you like the ones with leek and pork filling the most?â\nããâWe have it at night. Not only dumplings, but also cooked meat, my favorite pigâs trotters, and fried pork intestines.â\nããâThat woman just wonât make it.â\nããâSo you eat in the cafeteria every day to survive?â\nããâHow do you talk to your mother?â\nããâIf you donât like to listen, donât come.â\nããHuihua stood aside as a background. Her brother didnât wave her away, and she hesitated whether to leave or stay. Soon Shen Hui shook off Murong Danlingâs hand and took her hand. The two of them headed home.\nããMurong Danling was scratching her hair in anger, looking mad. âGod, are you kidding me? Why didnât I know Shen Haiyang had a rich father? Why did he become a vegetative after an accident? Why did he wake up again?â\nããâIf you make a mistake, you will not be able to catch up with the hot shit.â The one who mocked her was Zhang Qiuhua. The woman happened to pass by after getting off work and saw her appearance and could not help but come to watch the fun. âYou abandoned your husband and children when they were in the most difficult time. You deserve nothing.â\nããâHuh, if I canât get it, then how can you get it?Â  Little girl, why didnât you go after him when heâs already a vegetative? Itâs no use regretting it now. If you want to compete, go compete with that Li Xia.â\nããThis time Zhang Qiuhua also started to get mad, and the two women looked at each other with contempt and left angrily. Zhang Qiuhua, who lived in the same courtyard, learned that Shen Haiyang and Li Xia had registered as soon as she got home, and invited the neighbors to have a new banquet at home in the evening.\nããShe sighed, feeling like she had missed out on 100 million. Her mother asked her if she wanted to go, but she waved her hand to refuse. But she went with them at the last minute. After drinking two glasses of sorghum wine at the banquet, her cheeks turned red. She went over and grabbed Shen Haiyang who was toasting her.\nããâBrother Haiyang, do you still remember when you took me to catch cicadas when we were little? I couldnât walk, so you carried me on your backâ¦â\nããâWhat are you talking about?â Her mother quickly pulled her away to prevent Shen Haiyang from pushing her to the ground. âYou want to drink even though you canât hold your liquor. Letâs go, letâs go home.â\nããâI told you I would marry you, but you didnât wait for me and insisted on marrying that Murong Danling. Well, she ran away as soon as you got into trouble. Now youâve married this rural woman your mother picked for you. I know, I know, youâre a man of love and loyalty, and you wouldnât do such a thing as burning bridges after crossing them. But thereâs no need to sacrifice your whole lifeâ¦â\nããThe old lady pulled her out, but she was still mumbling. Her voice gradually became low, and finally it seemed as if someone had covered her mouth, and there was no sound at all. Everyone hurriedly blessed the newlyweds happily, and this little episode passed quickly.\n",
    "18": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c16-2/\nCHAPTER 16.2\nShen Haiyang reached out and squeezed Li Xiaâs hand, his eyes full of comfort. She smiled at the groom to say that it was okay, and pushed him to toast everyone. The simple wedding ended quickly, the table was cleared, the borrowed dishes were returned, and the family washed and went to bed.\nããIn the east bedroom, Li Xiaâs previous small bed had been folded up and replaced with a double bed. Shen Haiyangâs rehabilitation was not yet complete, and she thought that this bridal chamber was just a name. Who would have thought that after she closed the curtains, turned off the lights, went to bed, and got into her own bed, he also came in after a while.\nããFeeling her tenseness, the man put his arms around her and stroked her back. âI canât control what others say, but I know my heart. I really want to marry you and grow old with you. Donât be influenced by others, okay? Letâs live our own lives.â\nããShe had already gotten what she wanted in this marriage, and this man was very capable. He solved all the problems she faced as soon as she woke up. People who have experienced this naturally know what obligations they should fulfill in marriage. After a moment of tension, she relaxed herself and felt very warmed by his words. But she still had doubts in her heart, so she asked.\nããâWhy marry me?â\nããâBecause, does there have to be a reason?â\nããâUm.â\nããâWhy do you think men and women get married?â\nããHe did not answer but asked instead. Li Xia thought for a moment and said, âHaving children and reproducing offspring, having a companion to go through the ups and downs of life. Everyone has their own time when they have to take care of the elderly and children and are too busy to do anything, and they need help from each other. When you are old and sick, having a companion to support each other is a great help.â\nããâSo, I will marry you as my companion for the rest of my life.â\nããâHmm? What do you mean? Iâm asking you, not you asking me.â\nããâHaha,â the man laughed happily, and then he explained to her: âGo through it together, support each other, and the most important thing is to be reliable.â\nããâDo you think I can be trusted?â\nããâright.â\nããâItâs really weird. Other people get married because they like each other or because they love each other, but we get married because we can rely on each other.â\nããShen Haiyang smiled and felt embarrassed to say anything more cheesy. Marriage requires not only love, but also a tacit understanding of never leaving each other, a sense of loyalty, and unforgettable kindness.\nããWell, in her new life, Li Xia also thinks that character is the most important thing. The two men and women who had been through the gates of hell both thought that the other was pretty good, and they smiled at each other and entered into marriage.\nããHis body was not well and he was not so flexible. She took the initiative after she felt the changes in his body. The first time, the woman was on top. After the action, the wife fetched water to clean him. The man looked up at the sky in silence, and the woman smiled and kissed him.\nããâWait until you are fully recovered and you can be on top.â\nããâOkay. I must regain my manliness.â\nããâHa ha,â\nããIn the dark night, she held back her laughter with a flashlight.\nããShe held him still, letting him take the initiative.\nããâLetâs transfer the house to your name tomorrow.â\nããâWe are a couple, so it doesnât matter whose name it is under. Thereâs no need to go back and forth.â\nããThe property was worth nearly 20,000 yuan, which was a sum of money that most people could not earn in a lifetime in this era when most people only earned a few dozen yuan a month. Yet, he put it in her name with confidence.\nããLi Xiaâs chest suddenly swelled, and she felt indescribable. She was a straightforward person, and she would speak her mind clearly about what she liked. In her previous life, Fang Zhongcheng abandoned her and her son, and she wished she would have nothing to do with him in her next life. In this life, Shen Haiyang trusted her so much that she felt that even if he was lying in bed without a penny, she would take care of him for the rest of his life.\nããâLetâs move on the 16th day of the twelfth lunar month. I saw on the almanac that this day is a good day.â\nããâOK.â\nããAfter chatting for a while, they closed their eyes and fell asleep. Li Xia was afraid that she would kick him if she didnât sleep well, so she let him cover himself with a quilt. She got up early in the morning to cook and clean the house. When he woke up, the food was already on the table, and there was nutritious chicken noodle soup in front of him.\nããâWhy is there chicken soup?â\nããâI bought it yesterday. Itâs convenient to buy things with foreign exchange coupons, but itâs a little more expensive than normal ones. Itâs okay, there are enough foreign exchange coupons at home to replenish your body.â\nããâIâm going to transfer Huihuiâs US dollars to my name today, and exchange it for 500 foreign exchange coupons.â Since the family was well-off, she was naturally willing to spend money for everyone.\nããThe little guy had no objection to this, he just listened to his father. Li Xia quickly waved her hand to stop him: âItâs enough, donât waste the money. When my breakfast shop opens next year, my business will be on the rise and I can handle everything. Then we wonât lack meat. Your work unit will also issue tickets and so on, and I can also relax and accept various tickets, so we will have everything.â\nããâWhat about the clothes for the New Year?â\nããâThe last time the leader came to see you, he gave me a few zhang of cloth coupons, enough for us to celebrate the New Year.â\nããâThis time Iâll buy it for you first.â\nããWomen in this period basically devoted themselves to their families. Li Xia didnât wrong herself so much when she came back. She really had something to wear so she didnât buy anything, but the man kept thinking about it. She had originally planned to buy new clothes for the New Year, and now she nodded to him with a warm heart.\nããShe accompanied him to do rehabilitation and borrowed a wheelchair from the hospital to go to the bank to change the account of the deposit. The name of the fixed deposit cannot be changed. If you want to change it, you can only withdraw it. This will lose part of the interest. The staff asked Shen Haiyang what to do. He resolutely withdrew the deposit, exchanged the interest for foreign exchange coupons, and deposited the remaining principal again for one year.\nããAfter leaving the bank, he accompanied her to the department store. The man helped her pick out a blue-gray coat with a lapel. The coat was very fashionable and had a lining inside, so it was considered a jacket. She tried it on and it fit her perfectly. Just as she was about to say it was too expensive and she might as well make it herself, the man raised his hand and asked her to pay.\nããShe didnât say anything, but paid obediently in front of many people who were shopping. Then he picked out wool, shoes and other clothes for her.\nããLi Xia felt a little pained to spend so much money at once. Shen Haiyang looked at her with a knowing smile, and she immediately rolled her eyes and pushed him out of the building.\nããShe thought she could save money, but she ended up going to the Foreign Trade Mall again. âIâve never been there before.â\nããâI donât have a foreign exchange coupon, so I canât buy it even if I go there.â\nããâI have it.â\nããWell, now she pushed him to another place to spend money. There were rare foreign products of vanishing cream, and he had already bought it when she was about to say it was expensive.\nããâYou have good skin, you must protect it well.â\nããWell, she accepted her husbandâs concern. She upgraded from a skin cream worth one dollar to one worth more than twenty dollars. Holding it in her hand, she calculated how long it would last. About half a year, she could afford it by selling steamed buns. Thatâs right, she had to invest in herself after making money. Otherwise, she would become a yellow-faced woman sooner or later.\nããAfter buying some vanishing cream and shampoo, the man stopped her when she was about to leave. When she got closer, he whispered, âArenât you going to buy some underwear?â\nããShe immediately remembered the vest that had two holes in it, and his was also worn thin. âBuy it.â\nããAfter a big shopping spree, when the two of them got home, Li Xia helped him get off the tricycle and went into the house first, leaving the large and small bags on the tricycle for later use. To the west, Zhang Qiuhua had just come over fromwork to help, and when she saw that Li Xia had bought such an expensive face cream, she was immediately jealous and left without saying a word after putting down her things.\nããWhen Li Xia turned around, she saw that the other person had already entered the west room. She felt very strange. She had just said thank you for the apple, but how could she leave in the blink of an eye? There were still so many things in the tricycle.\nããâWhatâs going on with Zhang Qiuhua? I took out the apples, why did she put down the bag and leave?â\nããShen Haiyang took the bag and took out some things from it to help her put them away. Hearing this, he replied, âMaybe she suddenly remembered something urgent at home?â\nããâOh, not necessarily.â\nããAfter putting everything in order, she opened the ironing board and took out a piece of blue-black Decca fabric and spread it on top. She prepared a ruler, chalk, and scissors, and took the tape measure into the room to measure the man.\nããShe let him lie on the bed so that she could measure him. She made two pairs of pants first, and then took two shirts to the tailor shop to be made. At present, it was a four-pocket Zhongshan suit with a somewhat old cadre style. She had no problem making pants and other things, but she had to be a master in the tailor shop to make Zhongshan suits.\nããShe had two white Dacron shirts and knitted a sweater for him. The V-neck sweater perfectly showed off the white shirt collar. In the twelfth lunar month, the man was able to stand up and walk on his own. She dressed him up neatly.\nããAfter coming out of the hospital, she put a military coat on him, wrapping him up thickly so he wouldnât feel cold on the road. In the alley, she saw her son playing with some other kids, and she called out to him and the kid ran towards her quickly.\nããâMother,â\nããThe child hugged her neck and gave her a big kiss, saying that he missed his mother so much after not seeing her for so long. Li Xia had just finished making the cotton-padded jacket for her son, so she made room for him to stand in front and took him home.\nããThe little guy turned to look at Shen Haiyangâs expression. The man smiled at him, and he happily stood in front of his mother and went home with her.\nããWhen he didnât see his sister when he entered the room, Shen Hui put down his pen and came over to hold his hand: âYour sister wonât be back from class for another half an hour. Come on, brother will take you out to play.â\nããâLet him try the cotton coat first to see if it fits him before you leave.â\nããâOkay.â\nããShen Hui was wearing a new cotton-padded jacket and trousers. During this period, he and Li Xia got along well because of Shen Haiyang. He started to call Li Xia âMomâ again and was very close to his younger sister who was Huihua.\nããHe tried the cotton-padded jacket his mother made for him one by one. The sleeves were a little long and the body was a little big. He took it off and the children went to play. Li Xia took the needle and thread to corrvt it.\nããâDid you make this big on purpose?â\nããâWell, conditions are better now. We can wear autumn clothes inside and coats outside. Cotton clothes can last for three to five years. The older ones can be put away. As children grow older, the clothes can be opened.â\nããShen Haiyang looked at her silently, watching her scratch her scalp with a needle, the action was so similar to his mother. She was so concerned about her sonâs clothes and bought everything. She missed her child, right? She probably didnât bring him before because it was too much of a burden. Now that heâs awake, she should find time to talk to Fang Zhongcheng. If heâs willing, she should take the child over.\nããHe was reading a book on the side. She quickly put away her cotton coat and got up to cook, thinking about the current situation. Yi Yi sat next to her during the meal. She served the little guy half a bowl of noodles and a little less to dry quickly. The little guy turned his head to look at Shen Haiyang again. When he saw him smile and asked him to eat, he picked up his chopsticks.\nããLi Xia felt that the childâs reaction was a little strange, so she took the child to the kitchen after dinner to ask what happened. The child replied that his father had found a girlfriend, so he was sent back to his grandmotherâs house on the weekend.\n",
    "19": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c17/\nCHAPTER 17\nããâDad said that you depend on uncle for your living, and told me to pay attention to my uncleâs expression. If he is unhappy, he told me to go back to grandmaâs house as soon as possible and not to cause trouble for you.â\nããLi Xia reached out and hugged her son with mixed feelings. Fang Zhongcheng seemed to be thinking about her, but in fact, he was judging others by himself, showing his male superiority. âNo. Uncle likes Yi Yi very much, and he wonât be unhappy because you came. And mom doesnât rely on uncle for a living, so you donât have to be so cautious when you are at momâs house.â\nããâreally ?â\nããâReally. Your clothes were made of fabrics picked by your uncle himself.â\nããAt night, the child was taken back to his grandmotherâs house by his aunt. Li Xia kept thinking about his father finding a partner. What did Fang Zhongcheng mean by this? Was he going to find a partner and start a family? Was he going to leave the child with his grandmother for the time being, or would he not take care of him in the future?\nããâWhy donât you bring Yi Yi here? My mother always said that a child is the apple of her eye. You would be worried and anxious if the child is not with you.â\nããShen Haiyang spoke, and she turned back and sighed. âWhen we divorced, we agreed to keep each of us one child. He has the custody of Yi Yi.â\nããâWe are in a better condition now, with a spacious house, so donât worry about that. The child is still young, so itâs better for him to stay with his mother. Otherwise, Iâll find time to talk to Fang Zhongcheng and ask him to give you the custody.â\nããLi Xia didnât say anything, thinking about what to do in her heart. Fang Zhongcheng wants to remarry, will his stepmother be good to Yi Yi? After this period of rebirth, her mentality has become much calmer. She left her son to his father because she was not capable at the time and didnât want to repeat the mistakes of her previous life. After working hard for half a lifetime, the parent-child relationship was so strained.\nããNow that her most difficult time has passed, she has a stable residence and a good income from running a breakfast shop. If her son wants to live with her, then she can take him with her. She will find a time to talk to Fang Zhongcheng and see what he means as to change the custody, the other party must agree.\nããShen Haiyang became more and more flexible every day. When the family came to clean the new house, he could also do light work such as dusting. After the new house was dusted, some furniture was added.\nããThe back house had a door from the street, and the tables, chairs and benches were all custom-made, waiting to be opened early after the New Year. The couple lived in the main hall, and Shen Hui and Huihua lived in the east and west wing rooms respectively. Both of their rooms were not small, and they were divided into inside and outside by partitions.\nããâMom, can I still go find my brother in the future?â\nããThe area of the west wing is about 60 square meters, with the inner room as a bedroom and the outer room as a studio. The little girlâs living environment has been upgraded, and she is always thinking about her younger brother. But she is sensible and doesnât say anything extra to her mother, not wanting to add burden to her mother. Her younger brother now sleeps on a box with his grandmother, and she is afraid that he will fall down because the box is so high.\nããâOkay you can.â\nããThe next day, Huihua went to look for her brother. It was winter vacation and the kids had plenty of time. When she got there, she found her brother was gone. His father had taken him away. Just as she was about to leave, she was stopped by her grandmother.\nããâWhereâs your mom?â Huihua was afraid of her grandmother, so she was stunned for a moment and didnât answer. The old lady patted her. âIâm asking you a question, whereâs your mom?â\nããâOver at the new house.â\nããâLetâs go, Iâll take you back.â\nããThe grandmother was so kind that she wanted to take her home. She was so confused all the way. She was too small to resist and was forced to lead the way by the old lady.\nããAfter walking for about 20 to 30 minutes, the old lady and the child arrived at Li Xiaâs new home. The neat courtyard facing the street, Old Lady Fang sighed as soon as she entered, with envy and jealousy in her eyes. When they heard that Shen Haiyang had woken up, a group of people were waiting to see this rural woman abandoned, but the two of them actually got married and now live in such a nice house.\nããâMother,â\nããHuihua called out, and it was Shen Hui who came out of the room. âMom accompanied Dad to the hospital. Huihua, where did you go so early in the morning? I had to look for you everywhere just now.â\nããâIâm sorry. I went to look for my brother.â\nããâWhat about Yi Yi?â\nããâMy father took him away.â\nããThe brother and sister were talking to each other. The old lady rolled her eyes and interrupted, âHe squeezed on the box with me to sleep, and fell hard at night. Your mother is so cruel. She lives in such a spacious house, but she doesnât want her own son.â\nããâWhat, my brother fell? Why didnât you tell me just now, was his fall serious?â\nããâHow come you, little girl, are talking to your grandma?\nããâWho is talking?â Old Lady Fang almost raised her hand to hit her, but then she put it down after remembering the purpose of her visit. âItâs nothing to be afraid of if a child falls down, stop making such a fuss. Come on, go in and pour me a cup of tea, Iâm thirsty after walking all the way.â\nããThe two children couldnât handle such an old lady. Huihua asked anxiously where her brother was, but the old lady ignored her in a nonchalant manner.\nããWhile Huihua was circling with her grandmother, Li Xia ran into Fang Zhongcheng in the hospital corridor. The man was holding Yiyiâs hand, and the child had a square piece of gauze wrapped around his forehead. The little guy saw her with his sharp eyes, and he shook off his fatherâs hand and ran towards her from a distance.\nããâMother,â\nããShe squatted down and looked at the wound on the childâs forehead carefully, then looked up and asked Fang Zhongcheng what happened. âWhere did he fall? The wound has been treated. What did the doctor say?â\nããâHe fell off the bed at night and just broke his skin. The doctor said itâs okay.â\nããThe man avoided the main point, and Li Xia was so angry that she picked up her son. âHow can you be a father? You have only been asked to take care of the child for a short time and something like this happened. How could he fall down while sleeping? Wasnât there an adult outside to block the child?â\nããâItâs common for children to bump into things, so thereâs no need to make such a fuss about it.â\nããâYouâ¦ a kid can get hit on the head, but it can be a big deal. If you get a brain hemorrhage, itâs no joke.â\nããIn her previous life, she had seen this kind of thing on the news, and was very glad that her child had fallen a few times but was fine. She immediately became angry when she heard Fang Zhongchengâs nonchalant tone, which was very bad. Fang Zhongcheng was annoyed by what she said, and his voice was unconsciously amplified.\nããâThe doctor said it should be fine. Just take care of the wound and go home to rest. Itâs just a bump, no big deal.â\nããâFang Zhongcheng, you are the father and the guardian of the child. Arenât you embarrassed to say this?â\nããâWhy should I be embarrassed? I am taking care of the child. I will be responsible if anything happens.â\nããâYouâre responsible for nothing. Thatâs your brain. If something really happens, it will be too late to regret it.â\nããâMy own sonâ¦â\nããâMom and Dad, stop quarreling.â Yiyi suddenly spoke in tears, with a look of shock on his face. âItâs all because of Yiyi. Next time, Yiyi will listen so stop quarreling.â\nããThe two stopped arguing, and Li Xia patted her son on the shoulder to comfort him that everything was fine. Then she asked Fang Zhongcheng in a kind way, âWhat did the doctor say specifically? Is there anything I should pay attention to?â\nããâJust pay attention to the childâs emotions. If he is frightened, adults should comfort him and not blame him or increase his psychological burden.â\nããâIâll take care of him for a few days. You can pick him up when you have a day off.âÂ  She looked around and saw that it was not a good place for a conversation. âWeâll talk then.â\nããAfter all, women are more careful. If a child is injured or frightened, it is definitely better for him to stay with his mother. However, âYou are the kind of person who likes to make your own decisions. The head of the family is Shen Haiyang. Shouldnât you ask for his opinion first?â\nããThe house belonged to Shen Haiyang, and that was what outsiders knew. Li Xia said nothing about it, and just rolled her eyes at him and left with her son. He was furious at the cold stare, and turned around and left the hospital.\nããâWhen you are black-eyed and kicked out, you will naturally come to me.â\nããHe always thought that Li Xia, a rural woman, would be unhappy or even drive Shen Haiyang away if she interfered with her son. In fact, Shen Haiyang was concerned about the childâs forehead. The little guy was very sensible to Shen Haiyang and said clearly that he fell. He comforted the child and turned to talk to Li Xia.\nããâMake him some delicious food to nourish him at night. The little guy must be quite frightened. How about you take him to bed with you tonight?â\nããâYeah.â Li Xia agreed happily. âIt depends on him, whether he wants to be with me or his sister.â\nããâThank you, uncle. I want to stay with my sister.â\nããIn half a year, the originally heartless little son became very polite, and Li Xia felt distressed. What did Fang Zhongcheng say to the child that made the child very careful around her, for fear of causing trouble for her?\nããShe bought some pigâs feet from the hospital and stewed them with soybeans in the evening. Li Xia was playing with her son and asked him how he fekk on the ground at night. The little guy shook his head and said he forgot.\nããâWho do you sleep with?â\nããâgrandmother.â\nããâAre you on the inside or the outside?â\nããâCan not remember.â\nããHow could you not even remember this? Li Xia looked doubtful. The little guy had already run off to play with his sister, and obviously didnât want to talk about this issue anymore. Li Xia looked at the little guy with distress in her eyes, and while cooking, she was thinking about how to tell Fang Zhongcheng about her son.\nããFor dinner, she gave the little one two large pieces of pigâs trotters, and the child was very happy while eating. After dinner, the children went to play, and she discussed with Shen Haiyang about picking up her son.\nããâWhen we got divorced, I was penniless and had no place to stay, so I thought it would be better for him to stay with his father. Nowâ¦â\nããâTalk to Fang Zhongcheng about giving you the custody of Yi Yi. I have no objection. The current family planning policy allows one child per family, so having three in our family will make things more lively. I like children very much, and our conditions allow for raising them, so you donât have to worry that I wonât agree.â\nããâThanks.â\nããâWe are a couple. Itâs only natural for us to stick together when we encounter difficulties. You donât have to be so polite to me.â\nããLi Xia said nothing this time, and got up to make him some calcium-supplemented milk powder. She looked at him with a smile on her face, and felt warm in her heart.\nããWhen she was putting the children to sleep at night, she asked her son if he was willing to follow her in the future. The little guy was happy at first, but then he shook his head.\nããâIâll stay with Dad.â\nããâWhy?â\nããâDad should have raised me.â\nããThis little guy, is he worried that his mother is too burdened? âWho taught you this? You are so young, you donât need to think so much.â\nããâMom has worked very hard. They said that you work very hard selling buns from dawn to dusk and earn very little money. The house you live in now belongs to my uncle. You can only stay in the city because of my uncle.â\nããThey also said that you might be driven away by uncle someday, and no one likes a daughter-in-law with two burdens. The little guy looked at his mother and said nothing. He didnât want to add burden to his mother, and one less burden was a better one. He wanted his mother and sister to stay in the city, so that the three of them could all be in the city, and life in the city was better than in the countryside.\nããâMom, mom sells steamed buns to support herself. Sheâs not as poor as they think. Youâ¦â\nããâMom, can I come to eat buns with you often in the future?â\nããâYes, anytime. Remember, momâs home is your home. You can come whenever you want. You can stay here permanently. Uncle also welcomes you to come. He wonât be unhappy as you think.â\nããâOkay.â The little guy happily hugged her neck: âMom, I love you.â\nããâMom loves Yi Yi, too.â\nããThe little guy said he would sleep with his sister at night. After the conversation, Li Xia led them to the main room. Shen Haiyang told the three children stories, and she sat beside him while doing needlework.\nããShen Haiyang has soft features and a gentle temperament. After spending a few times with him, Yi Yi became very close to him and forgot everything his father and the others said. At night, he changed his mind and slept with his mother. He talked to his mother in bed for a long time. Li Xia didnât sleep well that night, and she was relieved to see that her son was fine the next day.\nããNowadays, the provincial hospital does not have a CT scan, so brain damage is usually not visible. The doctorâs instructions were the same as those passed down by the elderly, to pay attention to the childâs reaction for 24 hours, and she would not feel relieved until 24 hours had passed.\n",
    "20": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c17-2/\nCHAPTER 17.2\nThe New Year is coming soon, and the occasional sound of firecrackers can be heard on the street. Li Xia gave them pocket money, and the three children happily ran to buy firecrackers to play with. Li Xia was cooking in the kitchen, and when she came to see them, she gave the children a piece of sweet potato.\nããâOh, Mom, I forgot to tell you. My grandma came to look for you yesterday, but she left after waiting for you for a long time.â\nããâShe didnât tell you why she wanted to see me?â\nããYi Yi, who was led in by Shen Hui, answered: âShe wants to live in your previous house. I heard them talking.â\nããThe house that her mother-in-law transferred to her has five rooms, three main rooms and two side rooms. The space of nearly 100 square meters is definitely enough to make people jealous in this era, but no matter how jealous she is, it is not her turn to make plans, right?\nããHousing is tight in the provincial capital now, and it is hard to find a rental house. She felt that something that shouldnât have happened had happened. Just after breakfast, Mrs. Fang came again. This time the old couple came together. She was carrying something in her hand and went up to Yi Yi to hug the child and ask about his well-being.\nããAfter some polite conversation, he told Shen Haiyang that he wanted to rent his old house. âItâs two yuan a month. We donât live here for free. Is that okay with you?â\nããShen Haiyang still looked gentle: âThat house belongs to my wife, you ask her. She is the one who makes the decision.â\nããThey didnât want to confront Li Xia, but they had to confront her. The old couple smiled at their former daughter-in-law, no longer having the momentum they had before.\nããâLi Xia, even though you two are divorced, we still have Huihua and Yiyi, right? Letâs not be biased, we are the grandparents of the two children after all. Especially since Yiyi is still with his father, he sent him to me to take care of him when his father couldnât take care of him. My place is really small, and his second uncle and third uncle are getting married, and there is no place to put the beds at home. Yiyi can only sleep in a box with me when he comes. If you rent the house to us, it will be spacious for Yiyi to come.â\nããHow dare you say that you let my son sleep on a box? There are three bunk beds at home, why do you have to let my son sleep on a box? He fell down at night without any cover.\nããâThe house has been rented out, so forget it.â\nããâWho? Who rented it?â\nããLi Xia was about to say, âWhy do you care if I want to give it to whoever i want?â But an old neighbor came to the gate. Liu Biao, who was preparing to build a house in the east, was stopped by her. The man replied from a distance, âRent it to me.â\nããOld Lady Fang turned around and recognized him from a short distance away: âHow much?â\nããâSix yuan.â\nããOld Mrs. Fang gritted her teeth and stamped her feet: âIâll pay six yuan and one dime.â\nããLiu Biao sneered: âOh, who cares about your dime?â\nããâWell, Iâm taller than you anyway.â\nããWithout Li Xia saying anything, Liu Biao started bidding. âIâll bid seven yuan.â\nããOld Mrs. Fang was so overwhelmed by his sudden increase of 90 cents that her face turned red and her neck became thick with anxiety. âIâll pay 7.1 yuan.â\nããâEight.â\nããâEight yuan ? Thatâs too expensive.â\nããâI am happy with it, it is none of your business.â\nããWithout Li Xiaâs intervention, Liu Biao had already pissed off Old Lady Fang. She had no good impression of either of the two, as they had bullied her before. So she spoke up at the right time.\nããâEight yuan for the annex and nine yuan for the main house. Itâs just right for you two families to split.â\nããThis time, both families looked at her at the same time. You are too mean. We are in a hurry to use the house and you are taking advantage of the situation? She was dissatisfied in her heart but dared not offend her. After all, she said that she was not in a hurry on the day of moving, and she was reluctant to let others live in her house. She didnât like the rent at all, let alone rely on it to make a living.\nããâLi Xia, you are also the mother of my grandson, so we are relatedâ¦â\nããâForget it, donât try to be my relative.â After saying that, seeing that they were silent, she prepared to ride her tricycle. âForget it if you donât want to rent it. I wonât wait for the rice to cook anyway. Letâs go, I have to go out too.â\nããâ I will rent it.â\nããLiu Biao was determined to stay single because of the housing problem. He finally met a man who said he would rent a house, but he had been looking for a suitable house for several days. He finally found one, so he couldnât let it go even if it was expensive.\nããâNine yuan, I want the main room.â\nããUpon hearing this, Old Lady Fang quickly said, âThe main house is much bigger than the annex, and the lighting is better. The main house is nine dollars and the annex is eight dollars. The annex is a bit expensive, so Iâll give you three yaun less. How about five yuan?â\nããâNine dollars for the main room and eight yuan for the annex.â She raised her hand to stop Old Lady Fang: âIf you donât want to rent it, forget it. I said I wonât give it any less.â\nããShe didnât want to rent to the Fang family in the first place. Although she is now open-minded and doesnât care about anything, she still doesnât want to have anything to do with them. But the old lady confronted her in front of her tricycle, so she had to ask for a high price to scare them away. First, she said that she would rent the main house to Liu Biao, and then she raised the price to try to drive the old lady Fang away.\nããâLi Xia, look at thisâ¦â\nããâGet out of the way. If you donât want to rent it, leave. I still need to go out.â\nããâ I want to rent it.â\nããâOne deposit and three installments, if you rent, pay the money and sign the contract.â\nããDidnât scare her off the lease? For now, she was anxious to go to the hospital to accompany the man for rehabilitation. Letâs temporarily stabilize her and send her away. She gave Shen Haiyang paper and pen, and the man listened to her and wrote the contract. Liu Biao paid thirty-six, and his monthly salary was almost gone. Old Lady Fang also paid thirty-six.\nããThe rent was more than 200 yuan a year, which was about the salary of an ordinary worker. She took out the money that the client had sent back and gave it to Shen Haiyang to settle.\nããâWhy so many?â\nããLi Xia smiled and said, âMy plan has begun. The south-facing house in Beijing is rented out as a storefront.\nããThe price is higher than the housing. Wait, the rent will change every year. But the contract with the Fang family is only temporary. I donât want to argue with old lady Fang. I will find a chance to find Fang Zhongcheng and let him deal with his mother. â\nããShen Haiyang smiled and gave her a thumbs up: âYou have good vision. From now on, I will let you manage our familyâs money.â\nããâI want to open a store that sells home appliances.â\nããIn the 1980s, the home appliance industry was just emerging. Televisions, refrigerators, fans, washing machines, etc. began to slowly enter peopleâs lives. Buying televisions has become popular in the city, and this industry is now basically controlled by the state. Private small businesses have just started, and if you want to do this, you have to wait until the late 1980s. After a few years of accumulation, small vendors have money in their hands and the conditions have been formed.\nããâCanât get the goods?â\nããLi Xia nodded. âI definitely canât get the goods. I just have this idea, but the timing is not right yet.â\nããâYeah. Iâll support you when the time is right.â\nããâArenât you afraid of losing money?â\nããâOur country now has a population of one billion. If every family has a TV or fan, the market will be huge. And buying TVs is a trend. As long as we can sell them, we will definitely not lose money.â\nããLi Xia gave him a thumbs up, helped him onto the tricycle, and the two of them went to the hospital for rehabilitation as usual. âYou three stay at home and behave yourself. Iâll buy you some cooked food when I come back.â\nããâOkay.â\nããFang Ruyi stayed here until New Yearâs Eve. During this time, Fang Zhongcheng did not come to pick up the child, and Li Xia did not look for him. The whole family prepared new clothes for the New Year and bought firecrackers for the children.\nããShe used to live in the same courtyard with other people. It was lively among the neighbors, but it seemed like someone was watching her no matter what she did. Now she lives alone in her own house, and it is much more convenient to do anything. No one is watching what she eat, wear, or do anymore. She likes this privacy.\nããâWhat are you going to make for New Yearâs Eve dinner? I saw you bought chicken and meat.â\nããShen Haiyang could walk steadily without crutches, and practiced back and forth on the ground. Li Xia poured him a glass of water and put it on the table, then tied an apron and prepared to cook.\nããâRed-braised pork, scrambled eggs, pork with vinegar, braised tofu, black fungus and yuba, cold rice noodle soup, and chicken soup.â\n\n\n\n(Red-braised pork)\n\n\n\n(scrambled eggs)\n\n\n\n( pork with vinegar)\n\n\n\n( braised tofu)\n\n\n\n( black fungus and yuba)\n\n\n\n(cold rice noodle soup)\n\n\n\n( chicken soup)\nããâSo rich.â\nããAlthough most of the dishes are vegetarian, having six dishes and one soup for the New Year is already very good. Shen Haiyang likes his wifeâs cooking very much. Before, his mother cooked, and now his wife has taken over his motherâs cooking and become the hostess of the family.\nããâLet me help you pick the vegetables.â\nããâWell, sit there and help me pick the fungus and wash the vermicelli.â\nããShe helped him to the kitchen, she cooked and the man helped. The children were laughing and setting off firecrackers in the yard, and soon the three of them started quarreling.\nããLi Xia wiped her hands on her apron and ran out in a hurry. âWhatâs going on?â\nããShen Hui complained: âYi Yi is playing dirty and changing his ways midway. This is not the first time he has done this, he does this every time, and my firecrackers go into his pockets.â\nããHuihua was silent at the side. When she saw her mother looking over, she looked up and smiled at Shen Hui. âBrother, Iâll return the cracker to you. Donât be angry.â\nããIt turned out that the kids were playing a game, and the loser gave the winner firecrackers. Yiyi was a sly kid since he was young, and he cheated in the middle of the game and annoyed his brother.\nããBefore Li Xia could speak, HuiHua had already acted as a peacemaker to coax the two of them. âOkay, donât be angry. Iâll give you everything I have.â\nããYiyi saw that his sister gave all her share to his brother, and he stretched his neck to look at it with envy. As soon as Shen Hui turned his head and said he didnât want to play with him anymore, the little guy quickly rushed over and grabbed his brotherâs hand.\nããâBrother, good brother, letâs play together.â\nããâThen are you still cheating?â\nããâNo more cheating.â\nããâThen give me back what you just cheated on me.â\nããâDonât you have a sister?â\nããâDonât you want to play? Why donât you give me some of yours?â\nããâAll right.â\nããHuihua wanted to say that it was not necessary, as long as they had fun. Seeing her mother gesturing at her, she nodded and took the firecracker from her brother.\nããThe children solved the problem by themselves, and the adults didnât say anything. Li Xia was about to turn around and go back to the house when a man and a woman came in through the door. The man was Fang Zhongcheng, and the woman was someone she didnât know, and she was dressed very fashionably.\n",

The woman was wearing new clothes and her hair was permed into fashionable curls.\nããLi Xia was also wearing a brand new sweater and black polyester pants. The cotton slippers on her feet were very nicely made. Her hair was braided and tied behind her head. She looked neat and tidy with the gentleness of a housewife.\nããLi Xia thought to herself: Could this be Fang Zhongchengâs new girlfriend?\nããThe two women were silent, and Fang Zhongcheng spoke to Li Xia, âWanwan and I are getting married. So we came to my house today to meet my family and hence I came to pick up Yiyi to go home for the New Year.â\nããLi Xia looked back at her son. Little Fang Ruyi was having fun with his brothers and sisters and didnât want to leave. Yesterday he heard his uncle ask him to stay for the New Year. Since his uncle agreed, it was okay for him to stay, right?\nããâI want to play with my brother and sister. Dad, can I come back after kindergarten starts?â\nããHer son didnât want to leave. Li Xia originally wanted to talk to Fang Zhongcheng about changing the custody, but now didnât seem like the right time, so she said to Fang Zhongcheng first: âLet him stay here, itâs lively here. You just found a partner, so you can spend more time together and get to know each other better.â\nããAfter she said that, Fang Zhongchengâs new girlfriend pretended to greet Yi Yi. âYi Yi, I will be your new mother from now on. Can you say hello to your mother?â\nããLi Xia stood aside and said nothing, letting her son make his own choice. If he wanted to live with his father, he would have to have a good relationship with this woman. But now family planning is in place, does this woman have her own children? If she wants to have another child with Fang Zhongcheng, then it would be against the policy and she would be fired.\nããYiyi was somewhat resistant to this new mother and turned to look at his brother and sister. Shen Hui suddenly turned around and ran away, Huihua chased him and Yiyi followed. In the blink of an eye, the three little guys disappeared in the yard.\nããâWell, the kids are having a great time. Letâs talk about it after the Chinese New Year.â\nããSeeing the childrenâs situation, Fang Zhongcheng turned around to look at his girlfriend. The woman nodded, stepped on her high heels and walked away with the man. They went out to ride their bicycles, and the two quickly disappeared at the gate.\nããLi Xia closed the street door and went into the house. At the door, she heard Shen Haiyang telling stories to the children. He loved reading and had a lot of stories in his head. The children listened with great interest and smiled at her when they saw her come in.\nããAfter hearing the story, everyone helped and quickly prepared a table of food. There were six dishes, a soup and dumplings, and the children were eating with their mouths drooling.\nããAfter dinner, she helped to clean up the dishes, and the children went out to play in the alley with firecrackers. Li Xia had nothing to do, so she sat down to knit a sweater, and the couple talked about what had just happened.\nããâWhere is Yi Yiâs household registration now?â Shen Haiyang asked with concern. Fang Zhongcheng remarried, and if they wanted to have another child, then this would definitely be a problem.\nããâIn my hometown. There are many cases like Fang Zhongcheng across the country. I heard that the higher-ups will find a way to solve this problem. If he is willing, the child can be transferred with him in the future.â\nããâWhat if they want to have another baby?â\nããâThen wait until Yi-yi is older and takes the college entrance exam. Then he can get his household registration in the city. The trouble is that for the child to go to school, you have to find connections and pay tuition fees.â\nããâItâs okay, as long as there is a solution to the problem.â\nããSeeing each other like this, the couple began to plan for the little oneâs future. Li Xia worked quickly and knitted a sweater for the man.\nããThe dark grey cardigan with a white shirt inside made him look more refined and handsome, full of bookish air. Li Xia liked people who read books even though she didnât have much education. She used to listen to Fang Zhongchengâs words, but now, as long as it didnât touch the bottom line, she basically didnât refute what Shen Haiyang said.\nããAfter the fifth day of the New Year, all units started to work as normal. Li Xia opened her breakfast shop. She got up at around 2 a.m. and prepared. Not long after entering the kitchen, she heard the door open. When she turned around, it was Shen Haiyang.\nããâWhy are you here? Did I wake you up?â\nããâLet me help you. I know how to make dumplings. There will probably be a lot of people on the first day, so it will be faster if we have two people.â\nããHe didnât look down on the small business during this period. Li Xia was very happy just for this, not to mention that he came to help. He got a high stool for him to sit on, and the couple worked together to make dumplings quickly.\nããThe restaurant opened at 5 oâclock and soon welcomed the first batch of customers.\nããAs the clock struck 7, more and more customers came. She was busy running around, her feet hitting her head.\nããâComrade, give me two cabbage buns.â\nããâComrade, I want five carrots, two cabbages and two bowls of corn porridge.â\nããJust when Li Xia was so busy that she wished she could split herself up, Huihua and Shen Hui came in. The two little guys quickly collected the bowls and wiped the table, and Li Xia was finally able to go back to the kitchen to make dumplings.\nããJust after dawn, Yi Yi came in from the back door. âWhy didnât you ask me for help? Brother and sister, you two are not loyal enough.â\nããShen Hui rolled his eyes at him and said, âStop talking nonsense. Go to the kitchen and wash the dishes. There arenât enough bowls and chopsticks.â\nããâokay.â\nããThe two older ones were responsible for clearing the table, washing dishes, and collecting money. Shen Haiyang sat on a chair to help her make dumplings and serve rice to customers. Yiyi was the youngest, so she asked him to sit in a corner of the back room to avoid getting burned. The little guy happily sat on a stool to wash dishes, playing with water in the two large basins to help with the work. If there was anything dirty, Li Xia would clean it up again after using it.\nããâMom, are soy milk and porridge the same price?â Shen Hui shouted.\nããâYes. Vegetarian buns are the same price, but meat buns are 10 cents more than vegetarian ones. If you give meat coupons, itâs 5 cents less.â\nããâOkay, got it.â\nããThe family of five worked from 6:30 to 9:00 before they could sit down and rest. All the food they prepared was sold out, and even the food they wanted to eat was gone. Li Xia could only make boiled noodles.\nããShen Hui had been collecting the money today. The little guy had an excellent memory and was good at math. He was sitting there with a red face full of excitement. He sorted out the bills with his father and looked up to make suggestions to Li Xia.\nããâMom, many people asked if we have fried dough sticks and wontons today. Mom, can you make fried dough sticks and wontons?â\n\n\n\n\n\n\nããâYes. At the beginning, I didnât know how the business would be, so I didnât dare to prepare too much. You guys should work hard for a few days. If the business is still so good after the Lantern Festival, I will recruit more people.â\nããâOkay.â\nããAfter eating noodles, the three children went back to sleep. Li Xia took the money to buy ingredients, and came back to prepare the stuffing for the next dayâs buns. She bought an extra bag of flour today. The flour is not very white, but it does not affect the making of fried dough sticks and buns. Nowadays, the rural households are all under the control of the government, and the private sale of grain is considered to be a blind eye. After she found the channels, she used two methods to trade.\nããThe minced meat is chopped in advance and mixed with seasonings and vegetables, and then placed in a room without a stove. The dough is also mixed with leaven, and the vegetables are washed and chopped, and then seasoned and marinated in the evening.\nããIn the past, she did all these tasks by herself, but today Shen Haiyang was with her. The manâs legs and feet were not very agile, but his arms were very strong from the recent rehabilitation exercises, and he helped to knead most of the dough.\nããâIsnât that a lot? Will it be sellable?â\nããâToday I prepared 50 kilograms of buns, and they were all sold out around 8 oâclock.â\nããâAll right.â\nããAfter the preliminary preparations were done, She took a nap in the afternoon and got up to mix the vegetarian fillings with seasonings. She couldnât make wontons for the time being because there were no machine-made wonton wrappers for sale at that time, and it was too laborious to make.\nããAfter she was done, she put everything aside and counted the money in the box. She earned nearly fifty yuan in one day. She looked up at Shen Haiyang who came in from the door with excitement. The man had just helped her sort out the money, so he knew it.\nããâItâs a bit tiring, but it really makes money. You can earn as much as I earn in a month in just one day.â\nããâLife cannot be judged only by money. Your work can contribute more to society than running a restaurant.â\nããSince she doesnât have to pay rent for her own house and doesnât have to worry about making the landlord jealous and refusing to rent the house to her one day, Li Xia is full of energy and rolls up her sleeves.\nããShe sells steamed buns with various fillings, fried dough sticks, millet and cornmeal porridge, and cornmeal porridge. These are just a few simple items, but they are selling like hot cakes day by day. With small profits but quick turnover, many people at work would come to buy for convenience. With the accumulation of small amounts, her business is booming.\nããSelf-employed people are not popular in this era. Most people look down on them because they have no security and do not realize that this business can make so much money. She does not care about other peopleâs opinions and is only focused on making money.\nããâHere, this is the wages for the three of you.â\nããEach of the three children received two yuan, and after four days of work, they earned fifty cents a day. The children were very happy and sorted the money neatly.\nããShen Hui immediately gave the money to his father.\nããHis father became a vegetative, and his biggest need was to support and take care of his father. Everything he did was based on this premise. The reason why he wanted to stay with his biological mother was also because he was afraid that Li Xia would ignore him and his father after getting the money, or even harm his father, as others said.\nããHe chose to believe his biological mother between Li Xia and his biological mother. Since his father woke up, he has always followed his fatherâs lead. He knows that his father is rich, but the desire to protect his father has never changed.\nããShen Hui actually never lacked food or clothes when he lived with his grandmother, but he felt very insecure because of his parents. Huihua and her brother also felt insecure when they lived with their mother. When they had money, Huihua would return it to their mother, and Yiyi would also give it to her.\nããâIt costs money for me to learn painting, and so mother can save all this for my use.â\nããâIf you save up, you wonât have to worry about not having money to buy food.â\nããLi Xia was choked up for a moment, holding the money stuffed by her child in her hand and unable to speak. On the way to the provincial capital, she finished her dry food and was reluctant to spend money to buy food. The mother and her two children went hungry all the way to find Fang Zhongcheng. How old is he to still remember him?\nããFacing the three children, the two adults felt guilty for a moment. The children had no sense of security, even though they were living in a big house now and Shen Haiyang was recovering day by day. But the scars left on their young hearts could not be erased in a day or two.\nããâTake it all. This is your pocket money. You can spend it as you like. Donât worry too much, you are just a kid. We two adults are here to help you with painting, school, and food. You donât need to worry about it.â\nããShen Haiyangâs words were convincing. In addition, outsiders always said that he was the head of the family and the one who had the final say, so the little ones happily took the money from him and put it in their pockets.\nããLi Xia let the three children go to bed, and when they left, she looked at Shen Haiyang and smiled helplessly. âDo I make people feel so insecure? They all saw the money in the box, why do they still think Iâm unreliable? When you opened your mouth, everyone smiled happily.â\nããShen Haiyang smiled and continued kneading the dough. His legs and feet had become much stronger after the exercise in the past few days, so he could use more strength when standing. âItâs not easy to get rid of the psychological trauma of childhood, and the children donât know the actual profit even though they see the money. I still remember the feeling of being so hungry when I went to dig rat holes with my mother in 1960. Later, I had the habit of storing food for many years. When I ate, I always wanted to save some food for a rainy day.â\nããâI also remember going with my brother to dig wild vegetables and rob bird nests. Every time we cooked a meal, I always wanted to keep a handful of them, for fear that we would run out of food.â\nããAs she spoke, she lifted the steamer, revealing two buns inside. The couple looked at each other and smiled, their smiles were filled with helplessness. After so many years of food shortages, hiding food was ingrained in their bones. Except for the first day when they forgot, they would always save a few for themselves.\nããâThe children are still young, thereâs still time for everything.â Shen Haiyang consoled her with a smile: âWhen I start working and life returns to normal, weâll take them out for a trip every year. First, it can broaden the childrenâs horizons, and second, the children will be bolder and more responsible when they are with their father. I didnât have a father around, so I was soft-tempered when I was a child, but I slowly changed after I started working.â\nããâWell, with you here we have support.â\nããIn her previous life, she took care of two children. Although she tried her best, the children still felt insecure, right? In the final analysis, it was still a question of strength. If you donât have the strength, the children wouldnât believe anything you said.\nããWait, wait until I have transformed myself into a person who can fulfill your wishes, and then see if you still believe me.\n\n",

On the 18th day of the first lunar month, the children officially started school, and she hired three employees. Shen Haiyang also started working, and she had an overall view of the store.\nããAfter the porridge was cooked, it was placed in a soup bucket in a corner of the hall, with a bowl next to it. A piece of paper on the wall said âhelp yourselfâ. Two people in the kitchen were making dumplings and one was frying dough sticks. Li Xia went wherever she was needed.\nããThe three women hired were all very capable. After closing the stall, they made pickles from cabbage, radish, etc. and provided them for free. The porridge was served with fried dough sticks, steamed buns and pickles. The good quality and low price attracted more and more diners, and the business was very hot. Many people came in and took away their lunch boxes when they saw that there were no seats.\nããYi Yi was picked up by Fang Zhongcheng after school started. Li Xia wanted to talk to Fang Zhongcheng about the custody issue, but the little guy just pulled the man away and she didnât even have a chance to say anything. She didnât know what her son was thinking.\nããYes, could it be that he canât bear to part with Fang Zhongcheng? Iâll ask him next time.\nããLi Xia didnât see her son over the weekend. Huihua went to her grandmotherâs house to look for her brother, and heard that her brother had gone to her new motherâs home with her father and mother. After asking around, she found out that her new motherâs home was in the same courtyard as Murong Danlingâs. Shen Hui spoke immediately.\nããâCome on, I know where it is and Iâll take you there.â\nããShen Hui took Huihua to his grandmotherâs house. They heard Yi Yiâs shouting in the alley and hurried to pick up their pace. Yi Yi was fighting with two little boys in the alley. The two were the sons of Shen Huiâs uncle, both older than him.\nããâHey, how old are you two? Why are you bullying your little brother?â\nããShen Hui shouted from a distance, and the two boys looked back at him with disdain. They grabbed the small train and rubbed it back and forth on their palms as if to provoke.\nããâWho do you think you are? You are asking for trouble if you meddle in other peopleâs business.â\nããThe two started the fight, so Shen Hui had no choice but to fight back. Huihua ran to her brother and used a handkerchief to press the blood on his forehead. She was anxious to ask for help to treat her brotherâs wound first, but there were only children around and no one paid attention to this.\nããâStop fighting, stop fighting,â\nããThe kids didnât care about that at all. The two brothers pinned Shen Hui down and beat him up. While beating him, they kept muttering, âItâs all because of you, you little brat. We were going to buy a TV but now we wonât. You big idiot, you have to compensate me for my TV. I canât watch my cartoons anymore. The Hu family doesnât turn on the TV during the day.â\nããâThatâs right, itâs all your fault. It would have been great if you had followed your mother. Your mom even said she would buy you a big house. But now the big house is all enjoyed by your stepmother.â\nããShen Hui let his two cousins yell without saying a word, stubbornly protecting his head and fighting with them. Two fists are no match for four hands, not to mention that the two were bigger than him. He was at a disadvantage, and the twoâs fists rained down on him, making him feel pain all over.\nããHuihua, who was standing by, was anxious. She asked her brother to cover his forehead, and she joined the fight without caring whether she could win or not. The little girl got the courage from nowhere, picked up a half-brick, took a running start and jumped up to hit the highest one on the forehead.\nããBlood immediately flowed out, this was much more serious than knocking one finger at a time. The bright red blood flowed down the fingers and all over the cheeks. The children were all terrified, and many of them had already run away.\nããâYou, you little girlâ¦â\nããârun.â\nããHuihua was so frightened that she was stunned. Shen Hui reacted and dragged her away, taking the little one with him when he passed by Yiyi. The three children ran all the way home, scaring Li Xia who was out to pick up vegetables.\nããâwhat happened?â\nããâMom,â Huihua cried and said, âIâm in trouble.â\nããPutting down the bucket, she carefully checked the children. Shen Hui had a cut on his face and many bruises. She lifted his clothes and saw bruises on his lower back. Huihua was not injured, but Yiyi had a cut on his forehead. He covered it with a handkerchief and it was no longer bleeding.\nããShe was furious and asked Huihua what was going on. Huihua calmed down and told her mother what happened.\nããâI didnât mean to do that. I was just anxious. Who knew I would hit him on the forehead?â\nããâGreat shot.â\nããâAh? Momâ¦â Huihua was stunned. Didnât her mom always tell her not to fight with others? Why was she praising her? She had actually gotten someoneâs head slashed. âWill they come and ask for compensation?â\nããâDonât worry about that. You have a mother. If you encounter something like this next time, you should go fight sooner. If you delay, you will get beaten up many times.â\nããâWho got beaten?â\nããAs they were talking, Shen Haiyang came back and saw the children, taking them to the hospital first. He rode two wheels and Li Xia rode three wheels to take all three kids to the hospital.\nããOutside the pediatrics department, they happened to see Murong Danlingâs brother and sister-in-law taking their child to treat the wound. His wound was quite deep and needed stitches. The other party rushed over immediately.\nããâOkay, I just happened to meet you. Come on, come on, explain it to me clearly.â\nããSeeing that Li Xia was about to argue with someone, Shen Haiyang gently pushed her and asked her to take the children in. He suppressed the matter with a few words.\nããâKeep your voice down. We can talk later. This is a hospital. Donât you see the word âquietâ written everywhere?â\nããWhen he said this, the nurse next to him pointed at the wall and agreed: âIf you have anything to say, please go out and solve it later. Donât do it in the hospital. â\nããIn this way, the two families treated their childrenâs wounds. After leaving, Shen Haiyang didnât wait for the other party to speak, he spoke first.\nããâHow much did this cost your family?â\nããNow there is no CT scan, so he just treated the wound. âEighty cents. But the doctor said I have to pay attention to the child and feed him good food.â\nããShen Haiyang said, âWhat a coincidence, my family said the same thing. Yiyi is still young, and the injury to his head is serious. Huihui has bruises all over his body, and soft tissue damage, so he needs to rest well. Oh, yes, my family spent 1.13 yuan on these two. More than 30 cents more than yours.â\nããâThis, your cheap daughter used a brick to break my son headâ¦â\nããâYour two sons are older than my children, and they ganged up on them. Also, watch your mouth.â\nããBefore he could finish, Shen Haiyang interrupted him. He worked in the procuratorate and was still in uniform. He looked serious and argued with reason, giving people a sense of being a bureaucrat. The other partyâs arrogance was beaten down to pieces. As a relative of Shen Haiyang for many years, he knew that this seemingly gentle former brother-in-law would not give in at the critical moment.\nããâSo, then letâs just leave it at that?â\nããâIf you insist on compensating my son, I have no objection.â\nããâIâ¦â The man turned around angrily and pulled his son up, âLetâs go. You little bastard, youâre always causing trouble for me.â\nããThe woman next to him looked back, her eyes somewhat unconvinced. âHusband, are you just going to let this go?â\nããâWhat else? Would you be happy if you had a fight and let Shen Haiyang catch you?â\nããâIâ¦, his uncle seems to be even more powerful than before. My sister-in-law is really something, she doesnât know how to pester him. It would be great to remarry himâ¦â\nããThe womanâs words drifted in the wind, and Shen Haiyang suddenly felt embarrassed when he and Li Xia looked at each other. âShe is just talking nonsense.â\nããLi Xia smiled. She didnât say much about this matter from beginning to end, and just let him handle it. She thought he was going to fight, and she was ready for a fight. She didnât expect him to just drive him away. He is indeed a government official, and his way of doing things is different from that of an old farmer.\nããâItâs okay.â She smiled and asked the children to get in the cart, and whispered to the man: âActually, I think she is right.â\nããShen Haiyang blushed at what she said, and shook his head and laughed at her back. This woman was very wild, but she really respected him at home and outside. He saw her carrying a bag just now, and she had put bricks in it. But when he opened his mouth to solve the problem, she just waited quietly by the side without saying anything.\nããHe rode his bike and went away, while Li Xia got on the tricycle with the three children. Just as she was about to leave, she saw Fang Zhongcheng and his new wife coming from a distance, and she immediately jumped off the bike and rushed over.\nããBefore anyone could react, she raised her hand and slapped Fang Zhongcheng in the face. âIs this how you are as a father?â\n",
    "23": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c19/\nCHAPTER 19\nããBeing slapped in the face in public, the hypocrite Fang Zhongcheng did not dare to fight back in public. He was so angry that he cursed in a low voice: âYou, you bitch. Why was I so blind to marry you in the first place?â\nããâSame here.â\nããLi Xia had just learned some new words, and when she spoke them, she made him jump with anger. Fang Zhongcheng pointed at her angrily and was speechless for a while, so his new partner took the opportunity to speak.\nããâLeave the child to him to raise, and donât be so nosy. If you still have complaints, then raise the child yourself.â\nããLi Xia ignored her and turned to look at Fang Zhongcheng. âWhat do you say as a father?â\nããâIâ¦ We both have to go to work and we really donât have time to take care of the child. How aboutâ¦ I pay child support and you take care of the child?â\nããâDo I want your money?â\nããâNo, then, then what do you say we should do?â\nããShe had originally planned to take the child to her side, and was afraid that he would be unhappy. But now that he had brought it up, she was furious again. I can take the child back, but you canât push it to me. My child, my baby, do you despise me so much?\nããIn your previous life, the child you gave birth to later died in an accident, so you only have Huihua and Yiyi as your two children. In your previous life, you could still find excuses saying that you were not together and could not take care of them, but in this life, I want to see how you will explain it to Yiyi in the future.\nããThe little guy held by his sisterâs hand had a sad look in his eyes, and a hint of anger. In his previous life, only Li Xia had experienced the resentment of being abandoned by a man, and in this life, he also experienced this pain himself. You little bastard, only when you experience it yourself can you empathize with your motherâs sadness.\nããâFind a time to sign an agreement, and you give up your custody rights for Yi Yi. Pay child support and tuition fees, everything is subject to the law. Also, go back and tell your mother that I wonât rent the house anymore. Bring the agreement and Iâll return the money. Remember, if you let your mother, an old lady, argue with me about this again, I will report this matter to your unit.â\nããLi Xia turned around and asked the children to get in the car, andÂ  took the children home. Fang Zhongchengâs girlfriend knew what she meant by that. This womanâs attitude made Li Xia feel uneasy even if she followed her.\nããShe had inquired about it. This woman was getting married for the first time, so she must be planning to have a child. Family planning only allows one child per family. If Fang Zhongcheng takes Yi Yi with him, then having another child would be against the rules, and both of them would be fired from their jobs. Yi Yi was a stumbling block for them to have a child, and they had already pushed it out before they even got married.\nããAfter coming back to this world, she understood many things. Yiyi recognized Fang Zhongcheng in the previous life just because he didnât want her to be too tired. Whether she had conflicts with her son or not, he was still her biological son. Seeing that the two of them regarded him as a thorn in their eyes, she, as a mother, could no longer insist on each of them fulfilling their responsibilities.\nããIn her previous life, she was obsessed with drawing a line between herself and Fang Zhongcheng, and didnât want the children to call him dad. If she is still obsessed with having one child with Fang Zhongcheng in this life, regardless of the childrenâs situation, then she really has not made any progress in two lives.\nããShe had heard of murdering a child left by a previous wife in order to have her own child. As a mother, she would never let her own flesh and blood fall into such a situation.\nããAfter getting home and washing up, Li Xia quickly cooked and asked about her sonâs life at the dinner table. âAre you used to it? Did you have any quarrels with other kids?â\nããThe little guy took the bun from his mother and ate it while saying, âWe share a small bed. Mom, you donât know how badly Da Pang, who sleeps with me, sleeps. He tosses and turns and grinds his teeth. He snores even though heâs so young. At night, he even gnaws my feet and calls them pigâs trotters.â\nããâCan you sleep like this? Okay, next week mom will talk to the teacher and ask you to go back to the same daycare. Mom will pick you up in the evening.â\nããâOkay.â The little guy was usually very lively, but today he was very quiet. After answering her question, he whispered, âMom, Dad doesnât want me anymore, so can I always follow you in the future? Will you also not want me?â\nããHe had heard what was his dad said before and knew what it meant. Li Xia hugged him in her arms distressedly and lowered her head to touch the childâs cold face with her cheek.\nããâMom will always want you, and you will follow mom from now on.â\nããâWell, I have a mother. Hum, he doesnât want me, so I donât want him either.â\nããAfter dinner, they discussed where to live. Huihua was the first to raise her hand and said that she wanted her brother to live with her. Shen Haiyang thought it would be more appropriate for the two boys to live together. Moreover, if the children of a reconstituted family are separated deliberately, it is difficult to cultivate feelings. Three children cannot become one family.\nããDuring this period, housing was in short supply and many families lived together. She didnât expect him to think of this. Li Xia smiled and turned to ask Shen Hui if he was willing. The little guy pouted and looked at his father, and nodded in response to his expectation.\nããShen Hui lived in the east wing, a room with a width of three meters and a total area of about 40 square meters. At this time, the two of them were separated by a partition, one in the south and one in the north, and a small hall was arranged in the middle. There was a movable railing next to the little guyâs bed, so he would not be afraid of falling down when he pulled it up at night.\nããLet the children go wash up and go to bed. After washing their feet, they lifted the curtain of the main room and looked inside. Shen Haiyang turned back from the desk. The big and the small looked at each other, and the man waved at him.\nããAfter the little guy went in, he pointed to the inner bedroom and whispered, âMom is asleep. Are you looking for her?â\nããYi Yi shook his head and hesitated to speak. Shen Haiyang was not in a hurry and waited silently for him to speak: âUncle, is it really okay for me to live here forever?â\nããSeeing the insecurity in the little guyâs heart, Shen Haiyang nodded carefully and replied: âItâs Okay. You can call me daddy like your sister. This will be your home from now on, and you can be with mom and sister forever.â\nããâThank you, uncle.â\nããAfter receiving his affirmative answer, the little guyâs face relaxed. Dad always said that mom was not the head of the family and asked him not to cause trouble for mom. But now uncle agreed, and also said that he could call him dad like his sister. It was just a name, but for the child it was a sense of identity. Calling the two adults in this family dad and mom, then he is the child of this family, with a clear conscience.\nããShen Haiyang reached out and rubbed his hair, âCan you sleep alone at night?â\nããâI can. My brother said that if Iâm scared, I can call him and he will stay with me for a few days.â\nããâWell, go to sleep with your brother.â Seeing Shen Hui coming in, the man asked the two children to go to sleep.\nããâDad, you should go to bed early too.â Shen Hui said good night to his father, then walked out with his younger brother. As a result, the little guy also imitated him and turned around to wave to the man.\nããâDad, go to bed early.â\nããAfter the two children left, Shen Haiyang still seemed to hear the familiar name. Unexpectedly, the little guy did not reject it at all, but was quite happy.\nããWouldnât children always reject stepfathers and stepmothers at first? He was still thinking about this, not knowing that Yi Yi was so proud at the moment. He felt that if he called him dad, he could stay here peacefully and not cause trouble for his mother.\nããââââ\nããLi Xia got up quietly in the middle of the night and started a busy day. In the morning, the family brought breakfast from here to the dining room in the back, and Huihua asked Yiyi to eat quickly.\nããâHurry up, you still have to go to school after your sister drops you off. If you donât leave now, you will be too late.â\nããThe nursery and the elementary school where the painting was done were in opposite directions, and the little girl calculated that she had to leave 20 minutes earlier. As soon as she finished her words and nodded to eat quickly, she was interrupted by Shen Haiyang.\nããâBe careful, donât be in a hurry. Iâll take you there on my bike later.â\nããThe little guy looked up at him and smiled at him, âThank you, Dad.â\nããThis child is much sweeter than Huihua, or is he trying to please him on purpose? Shen Haiyang smiled and touched his little head: âYou donât have to be so polite to your dad. But I didnât prepare a seat for you today, can you sit on the beam?â\nããâWhat kind of seat? Is it the kind thatâs stuck in the front for children to sit on?â\nããâYes. Whatever color you like, you can ask mom to wrap it around so it wonât be cold when you sit on it.â\nããâI want blue, the kind of blue thatâs like the sky.â\nããâgood.â\nããWhen he followed his dad before, he always sat on the horizontal beam. He was small and unstable, so he always held the handlebars tightly for fear of falling off. At that time, he envied some children who had special seats, but he didnât expect that he would soon have one too.\nããThe child was so excited that he said goodbye to Shen Haiyang at the entrance of the nursery. Shen HaiyangÂ  pushed his bikeÂ  away and heard the conversation between the teacher and the little guy behind him.\nããâFang Ruyi, that doesnât seem to be your father, right?â\nããâTeacher, I have changed my father. He is my father.â\nããâDad can be changed too?â\nããâYes. My new dad is very niceâ¦â\nããThe sound can no longer be heard, Shen Haiyang rode his bike away.\nThis little guy is so funny, and from his childish words, you can tell that he is very satisfied with his new father.\nããWhen he went to pick him up after get off work in the evening, he asked him what he had done all day. The two talked as they walked. The little one was not afraid of riding the bike slowly, and he was very happy because he could show off his achievements to adults.\nããWhen he got home and was picked up, he ran to the kitchen and said, âMom, mom, I got a red flower today. The teacher praised me.â\nããâReally? What did she praise you for?â\nããâPraise me for my quick arithmetic skills.â He took out a piece of paper from his schoolbag. He got all the addition and subtraction within ten correct at once. There was a little red flower and a striking hundred on it.\nããâYeah, Yi Yi is great.â\nããWith a simple compliment, the child seemed to have won the world, jumping and dancing with joy. While they were talking, the two older children came back and chattered with the adults about what happened at school.\nããLi Xia was cooking, and Shen Haiyang washed his hands to help. While working, he talked to the children. The lively chatter was the atmosphere of the familyâs daily life.\nããYi Yi ran too fast and lost his shoes. Shen Hui bent down to help pick them up. Huihua didnât see his movements, so she reached out and patted her brother to make fun of him.\nããâIf you keep doing this and lose your shoes, and a fool picks them up and runs away, what will you wear?â\nããShen Hui froze in his action of picking up the shoes, turned around and asked, âShould I pick up these shoes or not?â\nããâHahahaâ¦â¦â\nããThe three children accidentally performed a joke that made everyone laugh. The children laughed so hard that they fell backwards. Yi Yi stomped his bare feet on the ground, Huihua smashed the garlic out of the stone mortar with a garlic hammer, and the other two laughed even harder. After laughing, Yi Yi went to get a broom and dustpan to clean up, and Shen Hui peeled two more cloves of garlic.\nããâTake it easy. How about I do it?â\nããLi Xia laughed along, and Shen Haiyang took the knife from her hand and cut the vegetables himself. Looking at the two children, she was extremely glad that she stayed in the city and met him.\nããLife was full of hope, and working in a bun shop was not as hard as working in the wind and sun. He simply helped her pass things or cut vegetables, which made her feel relaxed and know that she was not struggling alone.\nããShe was in a good mood and in a good state, so she could be good-tempered to the children. The three of them were obviously more cheerful than before, and children are most sensitive to the state of adults.\nããShe got up early to change Shen Huiâs medicine, and the children went to school. At noon, when Huihua came back from school and said that Shen Hui was taken away by his mother and uncle. Shen Haiyang and Li Xia looked at each other, and the man comforted her that everything was fine.\nããâIâll go check it out after dinner.â\nããâOkay.â\nããLi Xia put the chickens she bought in the yard and planned to wait for Shen Hui to come back before cooking. Both sons had a lot of injuries, so she bought this to nourish them.\nããShe let Shen Haiyang go to find his son with a clear conscience. On the other side, Murong Danling saw Shen Haiyang coming alone and immediately came out to greet him with a smile.\nããâCome in quickly, my mom made chestnut chicken for lunch. You used to like this the most, so I saved it for you.â\nããThere was an ambiguity in the enthusiasm of these words, as if they were still a couple. Shen Haiyang stopped at the door and politely said that he was looking for the child.\nããâShen Hui is still injured and needs a new dressing. Iâll take him home first. If you miss him, pick him up on the weekend.â\nããThis was a subtle condemnation of her for taking the child away without saying hello, and Murong Danlingâs expression suddenly became a little uncomfortable. He used to be so nice to her, and he would definitely agree to anything she wanted to do as long as she acted coquettishly. But now he is so cold to her that he doesnât even enter the house when she comes to invite, and doesnât even respond to any extra words.\nããTaking a deep breath to suppress her dissatisfaction, she slowly spoke: âI just heard that the child was injured, and I went to pick him up because I felt sorry for him. Huihui is my son, and no one loves him more than me. He got hurt like this in a fight with someone for your stepson, and you, as a father, gave half of his room to that kid. Haiyang, you raised this child with your own hands, and you have to take care of your son even if you marry a new wife.â\nããâDid Huihui say that? He doesnât want to live with his brother? Call the child out, and Iâll talk to him.â\nããâWhat are you talking about? Heâs so young and he always considers you in everything he does. If he doesnât want to, you donât know what his stepmother will do. For your own good, he doesnât dare to say no. He can only swallow his grievances.â\nããDid he let the child suffer? Shen Haiyang immediately reflected on himself. He justâ¦.This arrangement was made in order to allow the children to develop feelings for each other, and the two of them were separated well, so that each had their own space. Shen Hui didnât say anything, could it be that as she said, the child was taking him, the father, into consideration?\nããâdad,â\nããAs they were talking, Shen Hui came out, followed by several adults. They looked like they wanted to stop him, but they failed. They looked at Shen Haiyang awkwardly, and after a moment of embarrassment, they invited him into the house.\nããâCome in quickly, letâs talk inside. Iâll bring you some food, which Iâve left specially for you.â\nããâNo need, Iâll take the child and go first.â He reached out to hold his son, then nodded to Murong Danling: âI will take good care of the child. Youâd better tell me in advance when you pick up the child in the future.â\nããAfter he finished speaking, he picked up his son and put him in the back seat. Seeing him push the bike away, the people of the Murong family were anxious and could not stop him. The old lady reached out and pushed her daughter, and Murong Danling followed.\nããâHaiyang, donât be so anxious, come in and sit for a while so we can talk.â\nããâWe, donât have anything to talk about. If itâs about Huihui, then I know, I will talk to the child.â\nããShe was rejected again, and saw that he had already pushed the bike out of the yard. She anxiously reached out and grabbed the corner of his clothes. âWhy? The three of us are a family, youâ¦â\nããâThat was in the past.â Shen Haiyang interrupted her before she could finish, âWe divorced a long time ago, donât say such things again. If you miss Huihui and pick up the child on the weekend, donât affect his life.â\nããThe man rode away after saying this. Murong Danling stood there, mad and angry, stamping her feet and shouting. Her mother reached out and pulled her back home, complaining as soon as she opened her mouth.\nããâI told you to try to save the relationship earlier. Now that theyâve both gotten married, things have become even more difficult.â\nããâHow could I know that he would get married to that country girl so soon? Shen Haiyang, you are a big fool. Did you know that woman is after your money?â\nããâWhatâs the point of shouting these things at home? Go find him and make him understand.â\nããThe woman took a deep breath and calmed herself down. âDonât worry, Iâll find a way.â\nããThatâs fifty thousand dollars. With it, I can live my whole life without any worries. I can have everything I want. I will never give it up.\nããShe encouraged herself, while Shen Haiyang was pushing his bike on the road and talking to his son. âWhy didnât you tell daddy if you didnât like living in the same room with your brother?â\nããâI donât dislike living with my brother. I justâ¦â Seeing his fatherâs gentle face and quietly listening to him, the little guy continued: âIâm just afraid that Dad likes me or not.â\nããShen Haiyang rubbed his sonâs head. âWhat are you thinking about all the time? You are my son, and you will always be the first in my heart.â\nããâReally?â The little guy was a little confused. âIs it true that with a stepmother, even dad wonât be close to me anymore, as they say?â\nããâDo you think she treats you badly?â\nããShen Hui shook his head. No matter how much he was influenced by others, he couldnât say anything against his will. âShe was very good to me. She took care of us before you woke up. She would share any delicious food with me and Huihua.â\nããâIn that case, can you still treat her as your stepmother? Donât worry about what others say. You should have a good judgement in your heart. And you have to believe in daddy. He will never ignore you for any reason. No one can take away what is yours. Daddy is here for you.â\nããWas I too impatient? I wanted the children to spend more time together and develop feelings, but what if the children resisted? âIf you donât want to live with Yiyi, Dad will go back and move Yiyiâs things to the west wing.â\nããShen Hui smiled happily this time, and could feel the care and love from his fatherâs attitude. âNo need. I like Yi Yi very much, and itâs good to have him as a companion. Dad, itâs not me who wants to go with mom, itâs her and uncle who are holding me back, and I canât break free.â\nããâDad knows. If you have anything to say, tell him later.â\nããâUm.â\nããThe little guy smiled, he still believed in his father. When he got home, he found that Li Xia had bought a chicken and waited for him to come back to cook it in the evening. He immediately smiled at everyone, and after dinner, he took everyone to play. The little guy called him brother sweetly, which made him smile.\nããLi Xia did not ask about the father and son in detail. The child of the reconstituted family was in a normal mood and could be relieved in time. Shen Haiyang was a gentle and talkative person. Shen Huiâs mood was quite stable since he was brought back.\nããA few days later, Fang Zhongcheng came to see her and they signed a new agreement. She got custody of Yiyi and he paid child support. The previous rental contract was also returned, and Old lady Fang didnât dare to bother her again.\n\n",
    "24": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c19-2/\nããThe children go to school, the husband goes to work, and Li Xia is busy making money every day. Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, it is spring. On weekends, the husband takes the children to do a big cleaning, dusting, sweeping and mopping the floor, and taking out all the clothes that have been changed to wash.\nããHuihua couldnât help frowning as she looked at the clothes and sheets. âDad, there are so many. Can we wash them all?â\nããShen Hui rolled up his sleeves: âIâll wash too.â\nããYi Yi likes to imitate his brother recently: âI will wash too.â\nããShen Haiyang ordered the children to get basins while he went inside to fetch water. When Li Xia finished her work and came over, she saw the father and his children washing in the yard.\nããAs a family of five, Shen Haiyang and she both love cleanliness, and they also take care of the children and wash them frequently. She used to wash more, but now she is busy with business, and Shen Haiyang takes the initiative to take care of the house with the children. But washing so much by hand every week is really tiring. He also works from nine to five, and now he only has one day off a week. It is too tiring to do it every time.\nããâShall we go buy a washing machine?â\nããAs soon as she made the suggestion, Shen Haiyang looked up with a puzzled look in his eyes. âDo we sell this thing here? Iâm trying to get a TV ticket and was just discussing buying a TV with you.â\nããWhen they heard what he said, several children jumped up happily. âOh, buy a TV, buy a TV. Grandma Li next door bought a new TV for her grandsonâs wedding. Itâs a really nice TV.â\nããLi Xia was so busy that she forgot about it. In her previous life, she was also a TV lover. In this era, TV is a rare form of entertainment, and she should have bought one for her family long ago.\nããâBuy, buy the TV and washing machine. Everyone help, letâs finish washing quickly and go to the mall to see if there is any stock.â\nããâGreat.â\nããThis time the children were very enthusiastic and wanted to step in barefoot. The two adults worked together, and the three children helped, and soon all the clothes and sheets were washed and hung up. After going into the house to change clothes and pack up, the family rode their bikes to the mall.\nããBecause they had TV tickets, the family went to the department store first. At the appliance counter, there was only one black-and-white TV left. They asked the salesperson the price, and the male salesperson spoke arrogantly.\nããâThis 14-inch black and white TV is 610 yuan. Before that, I also had an 18-inch imported color TV. That color TV is really good. Itâs worth 2,980 yuan. I gave 20 yuan discount of 3,000 yuan.â\nããOh my god! Li Xia cried silently in her heart. Three thousand, this is the only money she has earned since the restaurant opened. But think about it, it is only the early 1980s, and color TVs will not be available in ordinary households until the 1990s.\nããâWhen will color TVs be available again and how can we buy them?â\nããThe salesperson glanced at them and saw that the whole family was dressed very nicely, so he answered her question. âItâs hard to say for imported products. You need to have indicators if you want to buy them.â\nããThe kids didnât care about color TV or not, they just wanted a black and white TV. Besides, the one next door was small, so this one looked bigger than that one. They all pulled her to get the black and white TV. The couple smiled, one took the money and the other took the ticket, and immediately took the Shanghai-made Kaige TV home.\nããThere were no washing machines in the department store, and she couldnât buy one even if she wanted to. There was a huge difference between the early and late 1980s, and the production of home appliances increased by dozens, hundreds, and thousands of times. Maybe she couldnât buy it this year, but next year it might be available all over the country. So she gave this task to the children, and asked them to come and see whenever they were free, and buy it when it was available.\nããThe money in her pocket was enough to buy a color TV, but the price made her feel very excited. She had to accumulate funds quickly, she wanted to sell home appliances, she wanted to open the largest home appliance mall.\nããâThe largest home appliance mall? Wife, have you ever thought of opening a home appliance factory?â\nããWhen she told Shen Haiyang about her plan before going to bed at night, he actually started to tease her. Li Xiaâs eyes widened for a moment, then she nodded and shook her head.\nããâThis is too difficult. A lot of start-up capital is needed. Iâd better find a way to get the goods to sell home appliances first, and then consider opening a factory.â\nããâOh my god, you really want to be rich?â\nããâIf possible, I will open it. The home appliance market will be very strong in the next few decades. Itâs huge, so you wonât lose money doing this.â\nããShen Haiyang reached out and touched her forehead: âYou are so bold.â\nããâHaha, Iâm just thinking about it. I canât get the goods even if I want to sell them now. The timing is not right.â\nããWhen a family buys a TV, the happiest people are the children. They can invite their friends to watch the TV together in the evening, which makes them look very proud among the children.\nããThe 14-inch one was clearer than the bigger one next door. For a while, the kids were all praising his TV. They watched whatever Shen Hui turned on. The little one became the leader of the kids, and those older than him followed his lead.\nããâStop arguing and listen to my brother.â\nããYi Yi followed Shen Hui around, and the little guy simply regarded his brother as his idol. He followed his brotherâs lead like a little tail, which greatly satisfied Shen Huiâs dignity and pride as a brother, and he treated him better and better.\nããâHuo Yuan Jia has started. Can I ask my mother to come and watch?â\nããâOK.â\nããWith a TV at home, the atmosphere became even more lively, with adults and children filling the house. Shen Haiyang saw Li Xia dozing off, so he pushed her and whispered something.\nããâGo to sleep over there in Huihuaâs roomâ\nããLi Xia shook her head. âNo need.â\nããKnowing that she found it troublesome, Shen Haiyang moved the TV to the west wing the next day. Everyone watched TV here, while Li Xia slept in the bedroom of the main hall. It was several rooms away, so this time she didnât have to be disturbed.\nããIn late spring, Fang Zhongcheng went to the school to see his child. After hearing about this, he went home and told his girlfriend about it. âHow much money did Shen Haiyangâs father give him? Even if itâs a lot, he canât spend it like this.â\nããHe thought that it was all US dollars that Shen Haiyang moved, but in fact it was all Li Xiaâs income. Because of this, Huihua and Yiyi both felt their backs straightened at home. Although Shen Haiyang was very kind, it felt different that his mother could earn money.\nããâWhy, are you envious? Even if you are envious, it is Li Xiaâs blessing and has nothing to do with you, her ex-husband.â\nããâWhat did you say?â\nããHe didnât hear the womanâs words clearly because they were stuck in her throat. When he asked again, she had changed her words. âDonât envy him. If we work hard, our lives wonât be that bad.â\nããThis completely satisfied the manâs self-esteem. He pinched her face and said greasyly, âI just like your mouth. I love to listen to your words.â\nããââââ\nããFang Zhongcheng listened to the woman and gave up the custody of the two children. The two were about to get married. Li Xia was busy with business and making money.\nããAt night she thought of her parents, and the next day she wrote a letter to her family and sent a hundred yuan. The land reform was going to divide the family, and the house had to be renovated. Her brothers had helped her a lot in her previous life, and now that she had more money in this life, she had to help her family. She bought Dacron fabric for her third brother and his wife, which didnât require a cloth coupon, as long as you had money.\nããAfter sending the things, she thought about how she still havenât contacted her father-in-law. Her father-in-law is old, could something have happened to him? He sent money to the mainland before, so it doesnât make sense that he would lose contact all of a sudden. And Shen Haiyang, when she saw the news about Shen Hui in the newspaper in her previous life, it said that the childâs father died early when he was young, so he wouldnât be in any health problems, right?\nããâShall we take the kids to Beijing during the summer vacation?â And then we can check his health at the same time.\nããâOkay but are you not worried about your business?â\nããâI have to make money and do things. So I couldnât get through to your father the last time I tried to contact him, and he hasnât replied yet. Letâs give him a call while weâre at it, maybe we can get through to him.â\nããSpeaking of his father, Shen Haiyang suddenly fell silent. He grew up with his mother and never saw his father. His impression was that his mother was full of resentment towards his father. She probably accepted his money in her later years because she was thinking about him and Shen Hui, and was afraid that they would be penniless and uncared for.\nããâMy motherâ¦â\nããHe hesitated to speak, and Li Xia guessed what he was worried about. âBefore she passed away, mother said that she had let go of all the unnecessary things. As long as you and your son live well, she will be happy in her grave. She also said that your father was not wrong, but they just had a disagreement.â\nããâreally ?â\nããâReally.â Li Xia curled her lips: âShe also advised me not to get angry with the man, let alone hurt the child because of this.â\nããThe two womenâs situations are somewhat similar. This time Shen Haiyang believed it. When a person is about to die, his words are good. When she was dying, it seemed that his mother had thought it through. Her biggest worry was what to do with her child and grandchild. As long as they could live well, she didnât care about anything else.\nããâWhen I was a kid, I asked who my father was, and my mother would angrily say that I was her only child and that my father was dead.â\nããâI give birth to my own child and I raise it. My child has nothing to do with other people. I used to think so too.â\nããâWhat now?â\nããâNow, he is the biological father of the child.â Li Xia smiled generously: âI used to hate him and I didnât want his things. Now I think itâs so stupid. He is my childâs father, why donât I let him take care of the child.â\nããAfter that, she added: âThe latter part was said by your mother. I once thought that if Fang Zhongcheng was a good father, I would let him take care of my son, but this guy turned out to be a bastard. Your father is definitely not like that. He didnât even know you existed. He thought of compensating mother by sending so much money back once the opening was opened.â\nããShen Haiyang remained silent, and she did not say anything more. Dependent on his mother, the knot in his heart cannot be untied in a short time. Li Xia did not intend to do any ideological work on him, but just talked a few more words. Emotional matters in this world are the most difficult to explain, and she herself was obsessed with it for a lifetime in her previous life.\nããThinking about taking the children out to play during the summer vacation, Li Xia has been making every effort to earn money these days, accumulate funds, and wait for the right time to sell the home appliances after the number increases.\nããRefrigerators, color TVs, and washing machines, the three major gadgets of the 1980s, will be popular for another 10 to 20 years. As long as you seize this golden period, you will make more money than you can spend in your lifetime.\nããThe couple had different schedules, getting up early and working late to sell buns. At night, when he went to bed, she was already in a deep sleep. When he woke up in the morning, she had already sold a round of buns. In this way, the couple did not even have the opportunity to have intimate.\nããShen Haiyang didnât watch TV that day. He went back to his room and closed the door after washing up at night. Li Xia just went to bed and heard a noise. It turned out to be him coming in. The two looked at each other, and as an experienced person, they immediately understood what was in his eyes.\nããShe smiled softly, pointed at the light cord and asked him to turn off the light. The manâs eyes lit up and he nodded silently and turned off the light above his head. When he got into bed, the creaking sound was very clear in the dark night.\nããâNo, someone will hear us.â\nããThere are so many people watching TV at home, it would be embarrassing if someone with nosy tastes eavesdropped. As an adult, Li Xia has also thought about the issue of married life recently. This thing is a reconciler between couples and enhances their feelings. Considering their schedules, this is the most suitable time. But this broken bed is not so nice.\nããâWhat should we do then?â\nããShe looked at the sewing machine in front of the bed and pointed at him to go to the floor. The man nodded happily, and the two walked down the floor hand in hand.\nããThis time, they had unlocked a new world. The man was well fed and drank and happily accompanied her to sleep. In the dark night, the two of them shared a quilt, occupying only half of the bed.\nããâCan we do this again next time?â\nããâItâs better to change to a better bed.â\nããâNo, I donât think itâs necessary.â\nããHaha, men, even if they appear to be gentle on the surface, they also have times when they think with their lower body.\n",

As the economy becomes more open and the weather warms up, a street vendor appears. The couple sells clothing, imported second-hand goods that they simply process and then sell. The good quality and low price make them popular.\nããWhen Li Xia went to buy flour, she was dragged by the clerk to look at clothes. The current batch of clothes on this stall are all summer clothes. Skirts, short sleeves, pants, etc., some new and some second-hand. They are good quality and low price. Li Xia picked a few for her family.\nããAfter returning home, the shop assistant Sister Li saw her boiling water to iron clothes and curiously asked what she was doing. âWhy do you need to boil water to iron new clothes?â\nããâA lot of new clothes have to be recycled, so who knows if there are any germs on them? Just boil them in hot water to be safe.â\nããâOh. Then, Iâll go home and get it permed, too.â\nããâAfter perming, put it in the sun to sterilize with ultraviolet rays.â\nããâWhat is ultraviolet light?â\nããâItâs the sun. The sun has ultraviolet rays.â\nããâOh, good, i will sterilize.â The woman saw her ironing the clothes and muttered to herself, âHow come buying a new piece of clothing is like buying a bag of bacteria?â\nããIn the 1960s and 1970s, although people were short of supplies, the raw materials were absolutely hygienic. Pure natural cotton, without any additives, was made into fabric. You could buy it and make it at home, and wear it as soon as it was finished.\nããBut things were different starting from the 1980s. Various chemical products and second-hand and third-hand items imported from overseas entered the market. The items were cheap but no one knew where they came from.\nããMany things may not look like anything on the surface, but in reality, you donât know what germs they contain. In her previous life, she had heard of people getting sick from this, and since then, many people have gradually developed the habit of washing or ironing new clothes when they get home. Li Xia also had this habit in her previous life.\nããAs soon as Shen Haiyang got off work, he saw the clothes hanging on the rope and went into the kitchen where Li Xia was cooking. âDid you buy new clothes today?â\nããâYes. You can wear it after it dries. I bought you a white short-sleeved shirt and black pants. I see you wear these most of the time to work.â\nããâAs a man, clothes are like that.â\nããYi Yi was picked up by him. He washed his hands and looked at new clothes in the yard. Then he ran in and asked, âMom, which one is mine? Is it the black overalls?â\nããâYes. Black overalls and white short sleeves.â\nããâOh, yeah, mine is just like dadâs.â\nããThe little guy looked at Shen Haiyang with full of admiration, and anyone who didnât know would think they were father and son. After a while, the two of them came back, and Shen Hui looked at his own, and the three of them were of the same color.\nããâMom, are you afraid that others donât know that we are a family?â\nããLi Xia smiled and said, âThis is called parent-child outfit. You two will look like your dad, and I will look like a huihua. When the weather is hot enough to wear short sleeves, our family will go out to the zoo and people will know at a glance that we are a family.â\nããHuihua looked around but didnât find hers. There were only two identical printed dresses, which were obviously her motherâs. âMom, which one is mine?â\nããâThen you can have one of the two identical ones.â\nããâItâs so big, how can I wear it?â\nããâJust change it.â\nããShe altered the long skirt to the right size for her daughter, and each of them got a white T-shirt that was just becoming popular. On the afternoon of the Dragon Boat Festival, the family took a break and rode their bikes to the zoo.\nããThere was a box selling ice cream at the entrance, and the three children looked at their mother with burning eyes. Without saying a word, Li Xia bought five ice creams, one for each of them.\nããThere were a lot of people on the weekend, and Li Xia kept telling her child to slow down. âHuihui, keep an eye on your little brother, donât let him get lost.â\nããShen Hui turned around: âI know, I am holding his hand the whole time.â\nããWhen they arrived at the elephant park, the fence was a bit high and Yiyi couldnât see it. The two big ones were clinging to the railings. Yiyi wanted to get on, but he was too small and couldnât get up with his small arms and legs. Shen Haiyang smiled and pulled him up and put him on his neck. Well, this time he was taller than his brothers and sisters, and the little guy clapped his hands happily.\nããâLook, Iâm taller than you.â\nããâChildish.â Shen Hui turned around and rolled his eyes at him, looking disgusted and angry. âI also rode on my fatherâs neck when I was a kid, which only shows that you are a brat.â\nããâI am just a little brat.â\nããThe two brothers were bickering loudly, attracting the attention of the people around them.\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Fang Zhongcheng, who came with his wife on the weekend, turned around and saw his son clinging to Shen Haiyangâs neck, calling him âDadâ. He immediately felt uncomfortable. He walked through the crowd and reached out to hug the child.\nããâYiyi, come here, daddy will hold you.â\nããThe little guy was just happy, but when he turned around and saw that his ex dadâs face was dark, he waved his hand and ignored him. âNo need,I am on my dadâs shoulder, I can see everything.â\nããMy dad? Who is your dad? Fang Zhongcheng was a little annoyed and turned around to glare at Li Xia. Li Xia rolled her eyes at him in amusement and was too lazy to say anything to him.\nããâLi Xia, is there anyone who teaches children like you?â\nããâWhatâs wrong with me?â\nããâYou, I am the childâs father, okay? Look at Yiyi and Huihua, they look like Shen Haiyangâs biological children.â\nããâThatâs perfect. Heâs the one raising the child, so itâs only natural for them to be close to him.â\nããâyouâ¦â¦â\nããWhen did this woman change? Her words can choke people to death. Fang Zhongchengâs arms trembled with anger. He felt that he could no longer see the shadow of the past in her. When she looked at him in the past, her eyes were like little stars, but now in the hot summer, he felt cold.\nããThe woman who used to be so rustic now looks beautiful, like a mountain hollyhock that has become a red rose in the garden. She wore a printed long skirt with a white T-shirt and a pair of white canvas shoes. Her hair is simply braided and tied behind her head, looking neat and generous. Her once gray eyes are now clear and bright, shining with the light of hope.\nããâHow about I take care of Yi Yi from now on?â\nããâDo you think heâs a kitten or a puppy? You can take it if you want it and give it back if you donât want it?â\nããFang Zhongcheng wanted to say something else, but the woman next to him held out her hand to stop him. âForget it. Itâs only been a few days and he is already trying to please others. Itâs useless to raise such an ungrateful little wolf.â\nããFang Zhongcheng looked at her speechlessly and was dragged away by her. But because of Yi Yiâs attitude, Fang Zhongcheng felt very uncomfortable. After all, he was his biological son. Thinking about it, he still felt that the scene he saw before was too dazzling. How could his son love Shen Haiyang so much, as if he was Shen Haiyangâs biological son?\nããâ Letâs bring Yi Yi to us to raise. He is still young now, we need to take good care of him, and he will be close to us when he grows up.â\nããâOh, close to you. Your son, even if you donât raise him, he is still your son. We agreed to have one child in the future, and you want him back, what should I do then ?â\nããâMy son has already called someone else dad. If this continues, will he still be my son?â\nããâSo, what do you want to do?â\nããâWe can bring him back home. He can be our flower boy at our wedding like Westerners do. At worst, we can find a family in the countryside to help take care of him. It wonât cost muchâ¦â\nããâLetâs break up.â\nããâWanwan, donâtâ¦â\nããAt the park, Huihua reached out to pull her mother, looked up at her mother and then at Shen Haiyang, then smiled easily. Shen Haiyang reached out and touched Shen Huiâs head. The little guy was sensitive and felt a little lost just now, so he took the opportunity to get into his fatherâs arms.\nããShen Haiyang couldnât take care of both of them at the same time, so he had to put Yiyi on the ground. Yiyi stood on the ground, staring blankly at his brother acting like a spoiled child with his father. Then he turned around to look at his sister and mother, and then walked towards his sister.\nããYiyi also heard what the woman said, but he was not affected like Shen Hui. Instead, he held his sisterâs hand, looked at each other and made a face. Huihua was amused by her brother, and the two siblings giggled and played with each other.\nããShen Haiyang patted his son and told him to go play with his younger siblings. The little guy was a little embarrassed for a moment. He had been a little nervous since Yiyi came to live at home. Just now, he felt lost when he saw his father holding Yiyi, so he took the opportunity to push Yiyi away from him. This was his father, who originally belonged to him alone.\nããâdad,â\nããHis father was his, the house was theirs, and his mother had been trying to force Li Xia out to live with the two of them, and a group of people were whispering in his ears to sow discord. The Li siblings were different, they knew their father didnât want them anymore, and they were able to stay in the city and live a good life because of their new father.\nããSo the two children have different attitudes towards reunification. They both try their best to help their mother live a good life. Shen Hui already has something, and now he is afraid that his things will be taken away. Yi Yi is too good at pleasing others, so he sensed some crisis.\nããâdad,â\nããShen Haiyang touched his sonâs head and realized that this boyâs possessiveness was at work. When his son was very young, he was not allowed to hug other children. He would grab them whenever he saw them. The old lady said that this is called occupying the embrace, and it will be fine when you grow up. But this boy is eight years old this year, and he is still jealous of his younger brother.\nããâGo and play.â\nããâUm.â\nããDad spoke, as if all his thoughts were seen through. He blushed, but was happy inside. He touched his head shyly and went to pull his brother. The little ones continued to play happily. They were a little disappointed that they didnât find the giant panda. They heard that there was one in the Beijing Zoo, and they chattered and said they wanted to go to Beijing.\nããâDad, can you take us there during the summer vacation?â\nããFour pairs of eyes, one big and three small, looked at him, and Shen Haiyang burst into laughter. Contact his father, go look at the house, and take the children out to play. Since the reason was so good, it seemed unreasonable not to agree.\nããâOkay.â\nããâyayy.â\nããThis time they were happy, because summer vacation would come soon after Childrenâs Day. The two older ones took the younger ones everywhere, and the couple followed behind with their bags, fearing that one of them would be lost. The three little ones stopped in the deer park, and Li Xia sat down on a stool beside them. She turned her head to look at Shen Haiyang, and he was also sweating profusely.\nããâIs it more tiring than working?â\nããThe man sat down next to her: âI wish I could tie a rope around the three of them so I donât have to keep an eye on them all the time.â\nããâI think I can consider it when I go to the capital.â\nããâHahaâ¦ do you want some ice cream? You look so sweaty.â\nããâYes.â Li Xia nodded and leaned close to him and whispered, âLetâs have one each, and make the three of them hungry to death.â\nããâMom, ice cream, buy ice cream.â\nããJust as they were talking, a man with a cart came over. All the children were clamoring for ice cream, and the three of them also came over to ask for help from the adults.\nããâIâll just eat a popsicle.â\nããâI want popsicles too. They quench your thirst better than ice cream.â\nããThe two older ones lowered their demands, perhaps to save money. A popsicle was only two cents, half the price of ice cream. Yi Yi looked at his older brother and sister and felt a little embarrassed because he wanted to eat a red bean popsicle, which cost five cents like ice cream.\nããShen Haiyang had already paid, and Shen Hui took out three cents to buy it. Yi Yi quickly caught up with his brother, holding his hand and smiling ingratiatingly. When he came back, everyone had a two-cent popsicle, but he was the only one holding a five-cent red bean popsicle.\nããThis kid is really a little naughty, licking the red bean ice cream with a smile on his face. When he looked up and saw his mother looking at him, the little guy immediately turned his head to look at his brother.\nããâMy brother bought it for me.â\nããShen Hui explained: âThe money Dad gave me is enough to buy him red bean ice cream. Mom, if you want to eat it too, Iâll buy it for you next time.â\nããLi Xia smiled and waved her hand: âNo, Iâll just eat a popsicle.â\nããThis child, before, was reluctant to spend a penny, like a miser. Now that Shen Haiyang has woken up, he is willing to buy a five-cent ice cream for his brother. Her son is also a troublemaker. No matter whether Shen Hui is smiling or sullen, he will stick to him happily.\nããâSince you woke up, the child has been much more docile.â\nããâdocile?â Shen Haiyang was very curious about this word. Can a person be described as docile?\nããâYeah. Before, he was like a twisted dough stick, worrying about this and that. Now that youâve woken up, you can soothe him into submission whenever he gets upset. He is as obedient and sensible as a kitten.â\nããThe man turned his eyes to his son and felt deeply sorry for him. Because he, as a father, lay down, the child had to bear many things that he shouldnât have to bear. He was competing for favor with Yi Yi just now, so he still didnât feel safe enough, right? This kid was actually still awkward. It was not easy to get along with a reconstituted family, and Murong Danlingâs family was still there to sabotage it, which had a very bad impact on Shen Hui.\n\n\nTRANSLATORâS NOTE:- HELLO GUYS, FROM TODAY ONWARDS YOU CAN READ CHAPTERS IN ADVANCEÂ !!!\nTHE FUNCTION IS :- THE ADVANCED CHAPTERS ARE LOCKED TILL THE REGULAR UPDATE i.e I will update regularly on my respective schedule but if you want to read the next chapter in advance you can unlock it while using the moondust (coins).

    "26": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c20-2/\nThe three kids had a great time at the zoo, and on their way home they met a toy seller. Both boys were attracted by the crudely made toy, and Shen Haiyang fulfilled the childrenâs wishes without hesitation. The two boys jumped for joy.\nããâWhat do you want Huihua?â\nããHuahua waved her hands at her stepfather: âI donât want anything. I, I have to finish my homework when I get home.â\nããâOkay, if you like it, study hard.â\nããThey originally planned to have dinner in the canteen outside, but when they got in, there were so many people. There are still too few private restaurants. People occasionally want to go out for a meal, but before they can taste the food, they canât praise the environment. How long do they have to wait in line?\nããâForget it, letâs go home and eat.â\nããThe original plan was changed, and the children had enough fun, so did not object. They met a man selling maltose on the street, and Shen Haiyang gave each of the three of them five cents, and the little ones happily ran to buy candy.\nããAfter cleaning up in the evening, Li Xia kept muttering that Yi Yi had barely eaten dinner. She turned around and asked HuiHua: âHow much candy did he eat? Is he full? He ate popsicles and candy this afternoon. He wonât get an upset stomach, will he?â\nããâhe,â¦â\nããHuahua didnât dare to tell her brother that he had eaten her share of candy. She smiled at her mother and didnât answer. She hoped that her brother was fine. But the boy was very good. He ate so much and nothing happened. He went to school the next day.\nââââ\nããBecause Shen Haiyang promised to take them out to play during the summer vacation, the period before summer vacation was very difficult. After school in the evening, Shen Hui and Huihua went to the kindergarten to pick up their younger brother, and the three siblings went home together. They bought three popsicles on the way. These are a great way to cool off in the hot summer, and they are the childrenâs favorite.\nããâHuihua,â\nããHearing someone shouting, Huihua turned around and saw a strange yet familiar face. Having been away from home for a long time, the child took a while to react before stepping forward.\nããâGrandpa, why are you here?â\nããâOh my God, I finally found you.â The old man happily held his granddaughter, and then reached out to pull Yiyi: âThis is Yiyi, he has changed a lot in a year. Isnât he with his father? Why is he here too?â\nããâYiyi also follows our mother now.â Huahua said, pointing at Shen Hui: âThis is my new fatherâs son, his name is Shen Hui.â\nããShen Hui immediately greeted him: âHello, Grandpa.â\nããâGood boy, good boy.â\nããHe took out a piece of candy from his pocket and gave it to Shen Hui first, and then to his two grandchildren. The child took him home, and as soon as she entered the door, she called for her mother. Li Xia came out of the house and quickly wiped her hands on her apron and came to greet him.\nããâDad, why are you here? Why didnât you tell me in advance so that I could pick you up at the train station?â\nããâOh, donât mention it.â\nããHuihua sensibly poured water for grandpa, and the old man drank some water before continuing: âThe roof of our house is leaking, and your second brother accidentally fell down when he was repairing it. The county hospital said it was a fracture and there was something wrong with the spleen, so they asked him to come to a big hospital, so I hurried over.â\nããUpon hearing this, Li Xia immediately became anxious. âWhat about my second brother? Has he been sent to the hospital? What did the doctor say?â\nããâHe was given traction for the fracture, and they said he have to wait until the swelling goes down before he can do surgery. His spleen also needs treatment, and he is receiving an IV in the hospital. Your second sister-in-lawâ¦ Iâ¦â\nããThe old man hesitated to speak. Needless to say, Li Xia also knew the dilemma her father was in. The second sister-in-law must have complained about everything. She would complain about everything. And there was money involved. The medical expenses were estimated to be quite a lot.\nããâDonât worry about the money, Iâll take care of it. Iâll go cook first and go to the hospital later. Dad, go take a shower and have a rest, donât worry too much. Youâve come to the provincial capital, Iâll take care of everything.â\nããShe arranged for her old father to wash up and took out Shen Haiyangâs clothes from the closet for him to change. As she was taking them out, she ran into Shen Haiyang coming back. The man glanced at her and pointed at the clothes.\nããâMy dad is here, letâs him change clothes first.â\nããSo thatâs it. The man nodded. âWhy did he come here suddenly?â\nããLi Xia explained the situation to him, and the man said he understood. âIâll go with you later.â\nããâOkay\nããâGive me the clothes, Iâll take them there. Hurry up and cook. Is there any meat at home? Ask the children to buy some cooked meat.â\nããIt was the first time for the father-in-law to come to the house, and it was also the first time for the father-in-law and son-in-law to meet. Li Xia was very happy with Shen Haiyangâs enthusiastic attitude, and nodded and went into the house to cook.\nããShen Haiyang originally planned to ask his children to run errands, but after thinking about it, he decided to go by himself. He asked Shen Hui to bring those clothes for grandpa. He rode his bike out and came back about half an hour later, carrying cooked meat and a bottle of Xinghua Village Fenjiu.\nããThe old man had washed and changed his clothes. When he heard the children say that their father was back, he hurried over to the house.\nããHe put away his smoke. His son-in-law is a city person and a cadre, so donât let him look down on himself\nããShen Haiyang came in carrying something, and the old man stood up. It was their first meeting, and he didnât know what to say. He was looking for help, so he looked nervous.\nããâDad, Iâm Shen Haiyang, your son-in-law, you can just call me by my name.â\nããThe son-in-law spoke kindly and relieved his anxiety. The old man smiled and nodded, and the father-in-law and son-in-law sat down on the sofa. The nature of Shen Haiyangâs work gave him a sense of authority. The old man was more nervous in front of him than in front of the commune cadres. He didnât dare to speak for a while, but Shen Haiyang smiled and opened the conversation.\nããAfter asking about the family situation, he started talking about the crops in the fields. Speaking of this, the old man had a lot to talk about. He said that the land reform in the village had been carried out, and the land and the house were divided among the family.\nããâThe house is not big enough and itâs old and leaky. I thought Iâd smear the mud on the house after harvesting the wheat, but this happened. Itâs bad luck. Old Fengâs son also fell before, but he just rested for a few days. But I donât know how her second brother could have fallen so hard.â\nããâItâs hard to say. If the fall didnât hit any important part of the body, it might be fine. But if it hits an important part of the body, even if itâs several meters high, it might be fatal. Fortunately, second brotherâs injury was not serious. The fracture was can be fixed with a surgery and it wonât affect his future life.â\nããâAlas!â The old man sighed. Although he didnât care about his life, he was upset when he thought about spending so much money. For the poor, money is life. A penny can make a hero fall, not to mention that he is not a hero, but just an ordinary old farmer.\nããâDad, donât worry too much. Iâll go to the hospital later. I have a classmate who knows someone in the orthopedics department. Iâll ask him to do a good job on second brotherâs surgery so there wonât be any sequelae.â\nããHearing that there was an acquaintance, the old man immediately grinned and nodded. This is the national situation, familiarity and unfamiliarity are two different things. This time the old man was relieved and had a drink with his son-in-law with pork head for dinner. Seeing the cooked meat and meat dumplings on the table, he looked at his daughter with disapproval.\nããâItâs too expensive. You have to be careful in your life. Have you forgotten what your father taught you?â\nããâYou have to be generous when you treat guests.â\nããThe old man was indeed angry and glared at her when she used his words to stop him. âWhat kind of guest is your father? He only needs to eat one bite of the home-cooked food. Itâs so wastefulâ¦â The old man looked back and continued when he saw that there was no one around.\nããâBe careful of son-in-lawâs complaints. We were worried at home when you married a city guy again. We really couldnât find you this time. In fact, Dad was worried all the time, fearing that it would cause trouble for you. I brought all the savings with me when I left, and I hope it will be enough.â\nããâHe is not Fang Zhongcheng, you can rest assured.â\nããâIt seems that they donât look down on us. But we canât go too far. We are from the countryside, so we canât do anything that would make people look down on us.â\nããâItâs not unreasonable for a son-in-law to entertain his father-in-law. Dad, you are so cautious. Letâs go to the hospital and ask Shen Haiyang to ask his acquaintances to find a doctor with better skills to perform the surgery.â\nããâHey. Sorry to bother my son-in-law.â\nããThe old man thought highly of his son-in-law. Li Xia smiled and said nothing. The three of them went to the hospital with lunch boxes. Outside the ward, they heard the second sister-in-law complaining again. She complained that the man accidentally fell down, that he shouldnât have been allowed to go up to the roof, why the father-in-law hadnât come yet, and whether the sister-in-law was unwilling to help.\nããâHowâs the second brother?â\nããLi Xia interrupted her as soon as she came in. The second brother on the bed saw them coming in and wanted to sit up, but was stopped by Li Xia. They introduced each other, and Shen Haiyang went out to find his classmates, leaving only their family in the room.\nããâeat first,â\nããThe second sister-in-lawâs words of complaint were blocked back, and she dared not say anything more to Li Xia. This sister-in-law is not a soft one, and she is not soft-hearted when she confronts people.\nããWhen she opened the lunch box, she found dumplings and cooked meat inside. She was so excited about the delicious food that she picked up her chopsticks and started eating.\nããAfter they finished their meal, Shen Haiyang came in with a doctor in a white coat. The doctor was Shen Haiyangâs high school classmate, and he agreed to find the director to perform the operation.\nããâThe tibia is comminuted and needs internal fixation. Donât worry, our director is an expert in this area and the surgical results are first-rate.â\nããâThank you, thank you, doctor.â\nããThe old man and his son couldnât help thanking him, but the doctor smiled and waved his hand, saying it was nothing. âHaiyang and I are good friends, if you have any problems, just come to me.â\nããâOkay, thank you.â\nããThe doctor came over to acknowledge her and then went out to do his own thing. Li Xia went out to inquire about the cost. Everything was cheap during this period, and the initial estimate was that one or two hundred yuan would be enough. She was relieved now that she was earning her own money, so this amount of money was nothing.\n",
    "27": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c21/\nCHAPTER 21\nããAt night, after exercising, Li Xia slowly spoke: âMy second brother got into trouble this time, and he definitely doesnât have enough money. I promised my father to lend him moneyâ¦â\nããâOf course we have to help with this kind of thing. You hold the financial power in our family, so you can decide how much you need.â\nããIn such a short time, he seemed to understand her very well. This was what she expected. She was very touched, but she was not good at talking, and she could not learn the skill of being a spoiled child like others. She kept this love in her heart. You love my family, and I will do the same to your family.\nããâI want to tell you that they wont pay you back soon. I know the income in rural areas. Now that the land reform has just begun, the most important problem for our family is not only food and clothing, but also housing. I donât know when they can pay back this money.â\nããLi Xia was a little nervous after she finished speaking. Actually, she didnât have to tell anyone. She could save some money and say that her parents paid it back. Besides, her father had money on him, but it was the familyâs savings for many years, and the house was still waiting for money to be repaired. She was able to afford it now. In her previous life, she was single and raised two child, and her parents helped her a lot. Now that they encountered such an emergency, she couldnât ignore her parents.\nããShe was testing his attitude. Who knows what might happen in her family in the future. Knowing his bottom line, she could be more measured in her words and actions.\nããâItâs okay. We are well-off, so itâs okay to help out. Your parents raised you, so you should give them some back.â\nããâum. Thank you.â\nããAppropriate, she pondered these two words secretly. In the end, it was still a matter of money. When money reached a certain level, this little money was nothing. In her this life, she wanted to live a good life and also help her parents. Making money could solve most of the troubles in life.\nããThe next day she found another person to help her in the breakfast shop. As for whether the outsider would embezzle money, she thought it would be fine as long as it did not exceed the limit. She was already very familiar with selling buns and could not be easily fooled.\nããShe made time to go out and wander around the streets, thinking about what business she could start to make money. The home appliance business was not ripe for the time being, so she couldnât do it. Smuggling was illegal, so she didnât do it, so she only had food and clothing left.\nããAfter a few days of wandering around the market, her second brotherâs swelling had subsided and he was ready for surgery. In the morning, they waited for the results of the surgery. When they heard the doctor say that everything went well, they all put their minds at ease.\nããIn the afternoon, she went home with her old father and took a detour to the entrance of the mall. She bought a can of milk powder for her second brother, but the salespersonâs attitude was still arrogant.\nããâIt was not until the 1990s that people started to be self-sufficient. Only then did they rent out counters and start private businesses.â\nããShe stood at the entrance of the state-owned shopping mall and muttered. The old man looked back at her and patted her like she was possessed. âWhat are you mumbling about?â\nããâHow to make money?â\nããâYour bun shop doesnât make money?â\nããThe old man was a little panicked. Whether his daughter made money or not gave him a completely different sense of confidence. Although his daughter was married, she could earn money by herself and help her parents when they needed it. If it was all up to her son-in-law, then the money his daughter borrowed might not be accepted. Her parents were holding her back, and the daughter was not upright in front of her son-in-law.\nããâNo.â No one knows a father better than his daughter. Li Xia knew what her father was thinking. âI make as much money as your son-in-law, so donât worry about it. Besides, your son-in-law agreed to lend this money, and he knows it all.â\nããâThen why do you want to make money? Just run your bun shop well and donât mess around. If you lose money, you wonât have time to cry. Is it easy to make money? You will be heartbroken if you lose money in business.â\nããâI know. I wonât make trouble.â\nããIt would be impossible to rent a state-owned counter in the next few years, so she decided to set up a stall. She would go to Beijing during the summer vacation to see if there was a wholesale clothing market there, and if not, she would go south.\nããNowadays, it is very rare to see street vendors in the City. Perhaps she can be one of the first to do wholesale. She has a certain amount of capital and a forward-looking vision. She knows what is popular in the next few decades. She buys in large quantities and lets the vendors sell on the street.\nããShe was thinking about how to get rich all the way. She didnât cook when she got home, but counted the money she had. It was less than 10,000 yuan, but the purchasing power of that time was incomparable to that of later generations. With this start-up capital, she could start her wholesale business.\nããâXia, why arenât you cooking?â\nããâHere it comes.â The old man shouted from outside, and she quickly put the money back.\nããToday is Saturday, and everyone should be back home by now. Li Xia is wearing an apron and walking towards the gate, but still didnât see anyone. The old man had brought Yi Yi back, and the little guy also looked out curiously.\nããâMom, why havenât my brother and sister come back yet?â\nããâI donât know. Your dad should be back by now, why is he still hanging around outside?â\nããShe went into the house to cook, and soon the three of them came back. Through the window, she asked why they came back so late, and Shen Haiyang raised his hand to show her. He was holding a big fish weighing two or three pounds, and flicked its tail in the dusk.\nããâWhere did the fish come from? Itâs so fresh.â\nããâI bought it by chance. I ran several miles to buy it, but I made an appointment with someone, so I will have a place to eat fish next time I want to.â\nããItâs so hard to buy something. Li Xia smiled and took a basin for him to pick up the fish. Wait a little longer, and everything will be fine in a few years. At least it wonât be like now where you canât buy anything even with money.\nããShe was going to make noodles in the evening, but since she had fish, she cooked rice instead. Two kinds of rice, stewed fish with tofu, and fresh cucumbers, water radishes and other cold dishes. After eating at home, she rode her bike to deliver food to her second brother. When she came back, she saw Shen Hui holding a flashlight to help light the way for others in the alley.\nããA man and a woman were carrying a wooden box together, and Shen Hui followed closely behind them with a flashlight in one hand and a small jar in the other. The woman was Murong Danling, how could she be here?\nããAfter she went into the house and washed her face, her father came over to talk to her with concern. âJust now, the woman asked son-in-law to help her move things, but he refused. My daughter, has this woman regretted her decision? She wants to come back to here again. But judging from son-in-lawâs attitude, he doesnât seem to want to reconcile with her .â\nããEven the old man could see that his son-in-law had no intention of reconciling with his ex-wife. Shen Haiyang knew how to handle things very well. After the old man finished speaking, he saw that his daughter was silent, looked at the door and sighed deeply.\nããâShe moved to your neighborhood. Why is this woman so stubborn? If she insists on sticking to you, it will be hard to deal with her since they have a son. Huihui was still angry when he first saw her, but then she said something about being pregnant for ten months and breastfeeding. There was no way the child would not go with her again.â\nããLi Xia didnât expect to encounter such a difficult situation. Murong Danling was obviously determined to get the father and son. Yes, fifty thousand dollars in this era was enough to make people forget everything and pounce on it.\nããAs they were talking, lightning flashed across the sky again, followed by a downpour. The father and daughter hurried back to the house. After stroking her hair a few times, Shen Haiyang handed her a towel from behind.\nããâIs everything alright at the hospital?â\nããâYesâ Li Xia looked at the heavy rain that suddenly poured down outside and asked, âDo you want to go find Huihui?â\nããâNo need. Let him figure out many things on his own. Give him time. Murong Danling said how hard it was to be pregnant with him and how painful it was to give birth to him. He absorbed all the nutrients from his motherâs belly. She got up several times at night to feed him. The milk was all made from her blood. This is a way to repay a favor. Not to mention that Huihui is so young, even if he is older, he would not be able to refuse.â\nããâWhy did Murong Danling suddenly move to our neighborhood?â\nããâShe said she missed her son.â Shen Haiyang let her go and looked into her eyes silently. âNo one would believe that, Huihui frowned, But he was her son, and this woman is using the grace of giving birth to her to justify herâ¦ This is a tricky one.â\nããIs this tricky? This is simply dirty. You are the mother, and the child was born by your own subjective will. He has no right to choose. From the moment you gave birth to him, you have the responsibility to raise him.\nããYou abandoned him when his father became a vegetative. Why didnât you fulfill your duty as a mother at that time? Now you have the nerve to tell the child that you gave birth to him and fed him milk.\nããâWhat should we do next?â\nããâShe is not a patient person and will soon show her true colors. She has already used up the grace of giving birth to him and raising him. Letâs see what else she can do next.â\nããIt seemed that this was the only way for now. Thinking of the news from her previous life, she hesitated whether to tell him. Later, she decided not to tell him for the time being and wait and see what would happen.\nããThe old man paced back and forth in the corridor, worried that his daughterâs bad temper would cause a quarrel with his son-in-law. He also knew that there was something wrong with this matter, but if there was a problem, he had to find a way to solve it. Getting angry and quarreling would only push people away. Whatâs more, it was the childâs own behavior, and his son-in-law didnât help.\nããIt was still raining outside, and one side of his body was soaked by the splashing rain. But he was worried about going back to the house, so he could only stand there and think about how to persuade them to stop arguing.\nããThere was no movement in the room until Li Xia came out to pour water.\nããâDad, what are you doing here? Itâs raining so hard, hurry back to the house. Your clothes are getting soaked.â\nããâoh oh.â\nããâDonât worry, donât worry, Iâll get you an umbrella.â\nããâNo, why would you need an umbrella for just two steps?â\nããThe old man covered his head and ran from the main hall to the side room. He went into the room and wiped the water off his face with a towel. He was still muttering to himself that he had guessed wrong. How could his impulsive daughter not quarrel with her son-in-law after such a thing happened?\nããHearing Shen Hui coming back, his daughter wiped the childâs face with a towel and found some clothes for him to change. The two adults didnât say anything about it, but he always felt uneasy. Rural people rarely get divorced, and he thought that after a divorce, both parties would become enemies, so how could he be willing to let the child see the other party?\nããHe thought Shen Huiâs move would definitely cause a lot of commotion, and he was so worried that he didnât sleep well all night, but the fact is that the family is doing what they want. On weekends, everyone didnât have to go to work or school, so they slept in. Li Xia was used to getting up early, cleaning up the yard and going into the kitchen to prepare noodle soup.\nããThe old man followed in and sat on a stool smoking. âXiaâer, are you two doing well?â\nããLi Xia knew that her father cared about her. In her previous life, the old man always advised her not to be so impatient in doing things and speaking. âItâs okay, we are fine.â\nããâYeah. Try to talk it over. My son-in-law is a reasonable man.â\nããâI know.â\nããâMarriages in the middle of life face many difficulties. You must trust each other and donât be petty. That woman is Huihuiâs biological mother. Itâs no big deal for her child to be close to his biological mother, as long as the son-in-law has the right intentions. A manâs heart is like sand in your hand. The more you want to hold it tightly, the faster it flows. In life, sometimes you just turn a blind eye and let it go.â\nããâDad, I know.â\nããIt is rare to be confused, that is an attitude towards life. Other things can be ignored, but emotional matters are always not good for three people. Li Xia didnât say much to her father, thinking about her own money-making plan.\nããEverything else was fake, only the money in her hand was real. She had two children to raise, so she didnât have time for romance. Murong Danling wanted to use this kind of lingering connection to sow discord between them, but it was a pity that the connection didnât work.\nããShen Haiyang had seen through her true colors and had given up on her. He refused to say a word, which only made people despise her more. She used Shen Hui as a breakthrough point, because he was her own son. But her own son also had a rift with her, and she put forward the credit of raising and feeding him. Such consumption, as Shen Haiyang said, no matter how deep the feelings and gratitude were, it could not withstand it.\nããMaybe Murong Danling used this trick in her previous life? Shen Hui was sentimental and stubborn. If she continued to use her feelings to buy money, her true colors would be discovered one day and Shen Hui would be devastated.\nããIn his previous life, when Shen Haiyang was gone, did Murong Danling support him, or did he live with his uncle? Thinking carefully, she didnât get any more useful information. What she knows is that he lost his grandmother and his father in his previous life, and his only relative was his mother. If she deceived him for money, it would not be difficult to understand why he and his mother quarreled and he accidentally killed her.\nããâWhat are you talking about?â\nããAs they were talking, Shen Haiyang came in. Li Xia looked up and changed the subject. âDad is worried about whether my second brotherâs leg can recover. Old farmers rely on their bodies to make a living, and they are worried that he will not be able to work well in the future. I was just trying to comfort him, that the doctor said that he has recovered and itâs okay, and you are just worrying about it.â\nããâDad, you have to believe what the doctor says. The surgery went very well. He will recover if he rest well.â\nããShen Haiyang continued her words to comfort his father-in-law, and the old man nodded in agreement. He was concerned about his sonâs affairs and his daughterâs current situation. He hoped that they would be well and live a happy life.\n",
    "28": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c21-2/\nBreakfast was ready, and the three children got up and washed up. Huihua used to get up early to help clean, but now she started to sleep in on weekends after being told by Li Xia. As a girl, she didnât want her to be too sensible. Let yourself be lazy appropriately, donât treat yourself like a machine. Working 365 days a year without a break is too tiring.\nããâMom,Â  can we have noodle soup today. I like noodle soup the most.â Huihua especially likes the current family atmosphere. Her mother is always gentle and she can say anything in a nice way.\nããâEat more if you like.â\nããâI also like the soup made by my mother the mostâ The little flatterer took the chopsticks and praised his mother, then saw that it was his father who served him the rice, and then smiled happily at his father, âThank you, Dad.â\nããâChoose it yourself, be careful of the heat.â\nããThe old man at the side laughed and rubbed his grandsonâs head. âYouâre a flatterer. Your mouth has become even sweeter since you came to the city. Itâs like you were covered in honey.â\nããâGrandpa, I like you too.â\nããâHa haâ¦â¦â\nããIs this child so shameless? As a mother, Li Xia wants to cover her face with her hands. In the previous life, this child seemed to be very sensitive like a little hedgehog. How come he has become a flatterer in this life? This skill of coaxing people is so good that he can deceive people to death. Who did he take after this? Fang Zhongcheng is a hypocrite and is not good at this.\nããHuihua was too embarrassed to whisper to Shen Hui. The two older children complained about their younger brotherâs behavior, and then laughed.\nããThe family had a lively breakfast, and Huihua carried her schoolbag to her teacherâs house to study. Shen Haiyang rode his bike to see her off, while Li Xia cleaned up the dishes, added water, and washed the pot.\nããThe old man went to the hospital to see his son, and Shen Hui took Yi Yi to play outside. Li Xia finished packing and went out, and saw Murong Danling talking to the children. She treated them all the same, and was very kind, as if she had a good relationship with her family. Then she gave each of the two children a candy, straightened up, smiled at Li Xia, turned around and rode away.\nãâCandies from mom and aunt.â\nããYiyi is a little smart guy, knowing that his mother doesnât like that woman coming. But she is his brotherâs mother, and his brother treats his mother well, so he canât not give his brother face. Li Xia pulled the corner of her mouth and said nothing. Murong Danling changed her strategy, and everything she did was intended to anger her.\nããThe incidents were minor, but they pierced into her flesh like thorns. The slight pain accumulated over time would become a huge injury. When she was angry, she would quarrel with Shen Haiyang, or get angry at the âinnocentâ Murong Danling. No matter which of them she was angry at, her relationship with Shen Haiyang would be disturbed.\nããAfter all, in this new life, Li Xia quickly figured out the connections. Murong Danling was interested in the property of the father and son, and if she wanted to back out, she would have to cut off the source of the trouble.\nããLi Xia thought about it for a day, and the next day she started to spread the rumor. The four employees in her store were all married women, and gossip spread very quickly. Within a few days, the rumor had spread everywhere.\nããâShen Haiyang signed an agreement. If he divorces his wife, he will leave the house with nothing, and all the property will belong to Li Xia.â\nããâOh my god, wouldnât that make her rich overnight?â\nããâNo wonder she lives so comfortably and doesnât disdains Shen Haiyangâs ex-wife. It turns out she has a plan in mind. Anyway, whether she gets a divorce or not, the money is in her hands, so what is there to be afraid of?â\nããThis time, the women looked at Li Xia with admiration, saying, âSister, you are so awesome.â She has a very secure life and can do whatever she wants.\nããThe rumor soon reached Murong Danlingâs ears, and she couldnât believe it. If Shen Haiyang and his son were to leave the house empty-handed after the divorce, then what was she doing here?\nããShe rushed to Li Xiaâs house without caring about anything else. Shen Haiyang was washing his face in the yard at that time. âShen Haiyang, is what people say outside true?â\nããShen Haiyang raised his head and frowned: âWhatâs true or false?â\nããâYou signed an agreement with Li Xia. If you divorce her, you will leave the house with nothing. Your money and the house will belong to her.â\nããAs soon as she said this, Li Xia at the kitchen door became a little nervous, silently looking at the man with expectation. As expected, Shen Haiyang no longer expected anything and nodded at Murong Danling.\nããâYes I fid.â\nããâAre you stupid?â Murong Danling was really anxious this time and spoke to him angrily. Shen Hui also suffered an unexpected disaster and was scolded by her.\nããâYou two are a pair of fools. Thatâs fifty thousand dollars, fifty thousand. A lifetimeâs worth of money. How did it end up in the hands of this woman who has nothing to do with you?â\nããShen Haiyang wiped his face and sneered: âArenât you meddling too much? This is our family affair and it has nothing to do with you. Secondly, she is my wife, how can she become someone who has nothing to do with me? It is only natural that my money should go to my wife, why do you, an outsider, have the right to interfere here?â\nããShen Haiyang was so awesome, calling her my wife and you an outsider, Murong Danling was so angry that she almost passed out. She was shaking all over and couldnât say anything. She staggered and turned around.\nããOut of the yard.\nããShen Hui was stunned. He couldnât believe it. His mother kept saying that she missed him and how hard it was to raise him. Was it all for money? He didnât even have any money to his name, but she was still targeting him.\nããShen Haiyang came over and took the childâs hand. The little guy looked at him and then at Li Xia, then collapsed and shouted, âI will never trust her again.â\nããShen Haiyang led the child into the house, and the father and son had another deep conversation. Murong Danling, who was outside, went out in a rage and ran back to her parentsâ home. She told her family about the matter, and the whole family scolded Shen Haiyang and his son for being fools. Finally, her second sister made up her mind and made a suggestion.\nããâIf you ask me, thereâs no need to go to such lengths. Since Shen Haiyang is so petty and holds a grudge, forget about getting back together with him. If you want money, just kidnap Shen Hui. Then you wonât have to worry about them not giving the money.â\nããMy God, this woman is so cruel. Murong Danling looked back at her second sister, as if she had just met her for the first time. Even if she wanted money, she couldnât kidnap a child, right?\nããâWhy are you looking at me like that? I am only saying to threatened them for money, I didnât say I would harm your son.â\nããHer two brothers slapped their thighs and agreed excitedly. âYes, thatâs a good idea.â\nããâNo, no,â\nããMurong Danling waved her hands and shook her head in panic. Her brothers and sisters stood up and sat in front of her, and began to bombard her one after another.\nããââââ\nããShen Hui was comforted by his father, but he was still a little depressed. Yiyi was very shameless and came up to share his toys and delicious food with his brother. Huihua also took a piece of drawing paper and said she wanted to draw for them to make her brother laugh. Shen Hui quickly played with his brother and felt that it was really good to have brothers and sisters.\nããShen Haiyang looked at the two little brothers in the yard and laughed silently. At this time, the importance of playmates was revealed. He turned back to look at Li Xia, who was hesitating to speak, and then asked with his eyes what you wanted to say.\nããâI acted on my own without consulting youâ¦â\nããThe man gave her a thumbs up and said, âWell done. You solved the problem quickly. Otherwise, if she had kept hanging around like this, Shen Hui would have been even more shocked when he found out the truth.â\nããâIn 1992, the newspaper published this news. The suspect Shen Hui accidentally stabbed his own mother to death. His mother was his only relativeâ¦â\nããâyouâ¦â¦â\nããLi Xia told him about her rebirth. If Murong Danling continued to pester him, she was afraid that Shen Hui would repeat the same mistake. As for whether to believe it or not, that was his business. As a husband, he always protected her, and she didnât hide it from him.\nããMost importantly, she was worried about his health, and she had to tell him the truth so that he would take it seriously. He didnât wake up in his previous life, and she had foresight in this life, but she didnât tell him because of her concerns. If something happened to him, she would regret it and blame herself. He could put the property that people in this era thought they could never earn in a lifetime under her name, and she couldnât let down such trust and affection.\nããShen Haiyang lost his voice after hearing this. He couldnât accept it for a moment and didnât know what to say. It would take him some time to accept such a mysterious thing, but Li Xia had already spoken, so fortunately she finished the story.\nããâThe age and name match, which makes me suspicious. And you, the news said that his biological father died young, so I have been worried about your health.â\nããShen Haiyang nodded blankly, âGive me some time to digest it.â\nããLi Xia nodded and left, leaving him alone in the room. He thought silently for a day, and at night he lay in bed and asked her some details in a low voice.\nããâDid the news say why that happened?â\nããâIt seems to be referring to the legacy left by his grandfather.â\nããShen Haiyang didnât know whether to cry or not. No matter how he thought about it, it was just like that. If there was no Li Xia in the previous life, then they would have become meat on the chopping board. If there was no Li Xia to ask his uncle for money, what would he have left after his mother left? Who took care of Shen Hui? Was the money embezzled by his uncle?\nããNo matter what, if his son has money, he will be a fat piece of meat and be fought over by others. If he has no money, he will be a burden and be despised by others. The child must have had a bad childhood. He is a bit stubborn to begin with, and I donât know what kind of personality he will have when he grows up like that. If he gets an inheritance again, Murong Danling will pounce on him and coax him like she does nowâ¦\nããHe dared not think any further, and felt cold sweat on his back.\nããThere are many cases of fathers and sons, mothers and sons killing each other, and there are also many cases of people becoming enemies or even secretly harming each other because of money or family members.\nããâIt says manslaughter.â\nããLi Xia said softly, and Shen Haiyang nodded silently. He didnât say anything more, it seemed that he needed time to digest this matter slowly. Li Xia turned her back to sleep, and he didnât sleep all night. This matter was too shocking to him, he couldnât imagine how much grievance his son had suffered in his previous life without anyone to protect him. How extreme his personality would become.\nããLetâs go to Beijing to get a physical check-up. Sometimes he felt uncomfortable in his chest and thought it was just weakness after the illness, but now it seems that he has to take it seriously.\nããThe next day, everyone did what they had to do, and the couple kept the matter to themselves. When Huihua came back from school at noon and went into the kitchen, the little girl remembered that she had forgotten to tell her mother about her participation in the competition.\nããâThe teacher asked me to represent the class in the competition and the painting must be completed before this Wednesday.â\nããâThatâs a good thing. Have you decided what to draw?â\nããâThe competition has a topic, and we have to draw nature.â\nããâThen do you need anything? Like paint or something, mom will buy it for you this afternoon.â\nããâNo. Mom, if itâs about nature, can I draw a sorghum field or a corn field?â\nããWhen you think of nature, you think of the countryside? Of course the countryside is natural, but if itâs a competition, wouldnât it be better to be more beautiful? âCome on, Iâll take you to the teacher and ask for her advice.â\n",
    "29": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c22/\nCHAPTER 22\n　　Although it was only a competition for elementary children, Li Xia still took it very seriously. The grapes in the yard were not ripe yet, so she went out to buy two kilograms of early-ripening sand apples, a pack of biscuits and a can of canned food and took them to the teacher’s house.\n　　”It’s okay, I’m here, I’ll guide her.” The teacher has no children and has been very interested in painting these days. Since ancient times, the relationship between a master and an apprentice is second only to that between a father and a son, and she is also very concerned about the little girl’s affairs.\n　”Thank you very much, teacher.”\n　　After a brief greeting, the mother and daughter said goodbye and left. On the way, Li Xia asked her daughter on her bike: “Do you still have any colored pencils or anything else?”\n　　“That’s quite a lot.”\n　　Since there is no need to buy new, let’s go home. She rode her daughter back on her bike. On the way, she drew pictures behind her and whispered to her.\n　　”Mom, my brother had a fight with a classmate this morning. But the fight wasn’t serious, so the teacher didn’t call our parents.”\n　　”What’s the fight about?”\n　　”Little Fatty said that brother hui was a flatterer who only liked to please the teacher, so brother hui started fighting with him.” After saying that, Huihua sighed, “My brother hui fought so fiercely that Little Fatty was so scared that he begged for mercy. Boys are really something, why would they fight for no reason?”\n　　Since the child was not injured and the matter did not warrant calling the parents, Li Xia remained ignorant of the matter. However, she still had to pay more attention to Shen Hui’s situation and go back to tell Shen Haiyang about the child’s fight at school.\n　　His father was still alive, but he was provoked by Murong Danling to fight with his classmates. In his previous life, he had no father, so he must have grown up crooked. She had already told Shen Haiyang what she knew about her previous life, and he should pay more attention to the child’s mental health.\n　　”When does summer vacation officially start?”\n　　”This weekend. The fifth graders have an exam today, and they will have a holiday after the exam. They will go to school next week to get their notices, and we will have a holiday this week. Mom, we…” The little girl hesitated halfway through her words, looking at her mother with some trepidation. When she saw her mother turn around and look at her with a gentle expression, she continued, “We also took the test. I don’t think I did very well.”\n　　”It’s okay. Just do your best in the exam.”\n　　She felt relieved when she said that, and spent the next two days doing the homework assigned by the teacher. On Friday afternoon, all three children in their family had their summer vacation, and ahe handed in the drawings for the competition. They said that there would be results after the summer vacation, so parents don’t need to worry.\n　　”Have you applied for leave? Shall we set off for the capital?”\n　　In the evening, Li Xia couldn’t wait to speak. She was ready to bring back a batch of goods. The bun shop at home had been arranged so that it could operate normally even without her. Time is money and can’t be missed.\n　　”Okay, give me a day to hand over the work.”\n　　Shen Hui was worried that Murong Danling was in a bad mood recently. If it was before, he would not care so much, thinking that the child was just upset. But after listening to Li Xia’s words, he began to be alert, fearing that the child had some psychological problems. Taking this opportunity to take the child out to see the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland, broadening his mind is beneficial to his physical and mental development.\n　　”Okay, I’ll go buy the tickets and pack our luggage, and we’ll leave the day after tomorrow when you’re done.”\n　　”What about the hospital?”\n　　”My second brother is being discharged from the hospital today. I will go see them off later and buy our tickets to the capital.”\n　　”I’ll call Lao Li and ask him to help buy a sleeper berth. You can go directly to the duty room to find him.”\n　　”Okay.”\n　　This was planned long ago, Shen Haiyang nodded in agreement. He rode his bike to the office to deal with things, and Li Xia rode her bike to the hospital first. As soon as she entered the door, she heard her second sister-in-law complaining to Li Xia’s father.\n　　”He can’t get out of bed like this. Why don’t we just stay here with Xia for a while? Why are you rushing home? She is your daughter, and the one lying in bed is her second brother. She shouldn’t…”\n　　”Shut your mouth.” The one who got angry and cursed was the second brother on the bed. “My surgery fee was borrowed by my sister, and she bought all the food and nutritional supplements for me during my hospital stay. You are such an unsatisfied woman, you even want to live in her house? What’s wrong with you?”\n　　”I, I didn’t say anything… I’m just worried about your legs. How are you going to take the train if you can’t get out of bed?”\n　　”How did I get here?” The second brother glared at her, and the woman lowered her head like a quail. “When I came here, I could lie under the seat. When I leave, I can still lie under the seat after discussing with others.”\n　　”Brother, have you completed the discharge procedures?? “\n　　Li Xia came in, and her old father hurried over to greet her. “It’s done, it’s done. Let’s pack up and get ready to go.”\n　　”Then I’ll go borrow the trolley from the department.”\n　　After paying the deposit, the two women helped the second brother onto the trolley. The orthopedics department was located on the first floor for the convenience of patients. They helped him get on the tricycle and sat him down. They went back to change the trolley, and Li Xia came out to take him to the train station.\n　　”My dear, you said last time that you could buy a sleeper berth. Does that mean we have to buy it in advance?”\n　　”Haiyang called and asked a classmate for help. We can just go and get it. Don’t worry about it. I know everything.”\n　　”That’s good , thank son-in-law for me.”\n　　After riding for more than half an hour to the train station, Li Xia had an acquaintance help her buy three berths for her father and his family. Two lower berths and one middle berth were in the same compartment, which was just right for taking care of the patient, the second brother.\n　　When Li Xia sent them to the train, she brought some dry food for the journey – steamed buns, and secretly gave her father 50 yuan. Knowing that her father would definitely not accept it, she stuffed it into the innerlayer of the bag containing the dry food.\n　　”Go home and say hello to my mother. If I have time during the New Year, I will take the children back to see you.”\n　　”Okay .”\n　　After saying goodbye to her father, she checked the time and got off the train. The second brother asked his wife to see her off, and she immediately caught up with Li Xia. She thought it was just a polite exchange, but when she got to the door of the carriage, the woman looked away from the father and son and spoke to Li Xia.\n　　”Your second brother’s legs are like this, and the doctor said he can’t do heavy work in the future. How are we going to live if an old farmer can’t do heavy work? Sister-in-law, please, can you find a job for your second brother in the city? Your husband is a leader, so he must know a lot of people. Please, I really have no other choice.”\n　　During the operation, it was found that the condition of my second brother’s leg was more serious than what was seen in the film beforehand. The broken bones were not long enough to be connected together, so an artificial bone was connected. If he continues to work like before, his leg will not be able to bear it and he may soon become a cripple.\n　　Li Xia knew about this situation and had been thinking about it for a while. She thought it was not appropriate to ask Shen Haiyang to help her find a job.\n　　First, her second brother has little education and no skills. If he finds a job, he can only do odd jobs. This kind of job earns little money and has no security, so he is not suitable for settling down. Second, her mother’s family is large and has many trivial matters. She can’t rely on Shen Haiyang for all of them. It will affect the relationship between the couple in the long run.\n　　”I understand. Let’s wait until my second brother’s leg is completely healed before we talk about this. Don’t worry. Take good care of him in the next year or so. Keeping healthy is more important than anything else. After all, you need a healthy body to do anything. If we encounter any difficulties, we can always get through it together.”\n　　”Yes, I know. Then, sister-in-law you must keep it in mind.”\n　　”Yeah.”\n　　After seeing her family off, she bought three sleeper tickets for her family. The three children were not old enough to buy tickets, but there were too many of them to take with her, and she would not be able to accommodate them without buying one more.\n　　”I’ll take HuiHua with me and let Huihui and Yiyi sleep together, so all three of them can sleep together.”\n　　After returning home and packing her luggage in the afternoon, she took out the ticket and showed it to Shen Haiyang. The man nodded and had no objection. His mind was now filled with the past life she mentioned, and he kept deducing the possibilities of the mother and son.\n　　If it was before, he wouldn’t think so much. As the old saying goes, even a tiger won’t eat its own cubs, Murong Danling is the child’s biological mother. But now it’s different, because of that possible possibility, he doesn’t mind maliciously speculating on how Murong Danling and her family will take the next step.\n　　The children didn’t like watching TV shows these days, so they would go out to play after dinner. He called the children to the main room, gave each of them a dime in pocket money, and then started talking to them.\n　　”Don’t go alone with Murong Danling. Next time she looks for you, run away. If you miss her, dad will take you there. Remember, don’t go with her by yourself.” After saying this to Shen Hui, he turned around and looked at the other two: “The same goes for you two. If she calls the three of you, remember, don’t follow her, come home together.”\n　　What does this mean? It’s not that he is not allowed to see his biological mother, but he is not allowed to go with his biological mother without his family knowing. Shen Hui didn’t understand what his father meant, but nodded obediently. Huihua and yiyi also nodded, not knowing what their father meant, but obeying the adults’ arrangements.\n　　”Yeah, we got it.”\n　　Shen Haiyang touched his son and said, “Be good.” After a moment of silence, he repeated: “Remember, if you want to meet her, your father must take you there. Don’t go with her alone. If your uncle forces you, just shout loudly and say you don’t know him.”\n　　”I will remember.” Seeing his father’s worried expression, the little boy nodded heavily at him, “I really remember. I won’t go with her alone. I won’t let my uncle take me away again. My mother said that if a child is walking on the main road and someone forces him, he should shout or knock over other people’s things.”\n　　”Well, just do as your mother says. If you miss her, make sure your father picks you up.”\n　　”I see.”\n　　”Okay, be good. Go and play.”\n　　He had talked to his son and had given him a heads up. He went to the yard with a palm leaf fan and sat on a reclining chair, thinking about the father and son again. The people of the Murong family were just selfish, not desperate, and would not dare to do anything crazy. If they were not alone with them, they would not be able to use Shen Hui.\n　　On the summer night with a bright moon and a light breeze, Li Xia came out of the house and sat down beside him, and the two of them chatted in the yard while enjoying the cool air. Shen Haiyang picked up the large cattail leaf fan on the table and fanned the two of them, not only to keep them cool, but also to drive away mosquitoes.\n　　”Pah,” just like that, a mosquito still landed on Shen Haiyang’s shoulder. She raised her hand and slapped it, but the mosquito ran away and she didn’t hit it. Facing Shen Haiyang’s playful smile, she quickly explained.\n　　”There are mosquitoes. Really. I’m not lying to you.”\n　　”I didn’t say anything.”\n　　”Your smile…” Li Xia raised her hand and patted him again, this time showing him her palm. “See, I didn’t lie.”\n　　”Well, thank you, wife.” In fact, he didn’t even look at it.\n　　Li Xia blushed at the sudden reveal of emotion. This man was really something. He usually looked as gentle as jade, but when they were alone, he was full of charm and seduction with just a slight raise of his eyebrows.\n　　For a moment, she forgot what she was going to say. She was stunned for a moment and then smiled and rolled her eyes at him. Shen Haiyang smiled and told her about going to Beijing. The couple chatted with each other.\n　　”You’re really not feeling unwell, right?”\n　　Shen Haiyang was silent for a moment and then smiled, “I’ll go to the hospital for a check-up as you said.” He sometimes felt stuffy and uncomfortable in his chest, but he didn’t tell her until the test results came out so as not to worry her.\n　　”Well, you’re smart, otherwise I might have knocked you out and carried you to the hospital.”\n　　”You’re a female bandit.”\n　　The two of them were enjoying their leisure time in the yard, unaware that the three children outside the yard had been targeted. The three little ones were playing with the other children outside, chasing fireflies everywhere, laughing and carefree, and before they knew it, they were already far away from the Shen family.\n　　”Huihui,” Murong Danling reached out to pull her son. When Shen Hui saw it was her, he immediately stopped smiling and stepped back to avoid her hand. Murong Danling looked nervous and didn’t care about his attitude, and continued.\n　　”Huihui its your mother. I’m telling you, don’t be fooled by others. In this world, biological mothers are the best. No stepmother is better. Come on, follow me. I’ll take care of you from now on.”\n　　Shen Hui wanted to leave but she grabbed him by the corner of his clothes. He looked at her helplessly. “Can’t you just be well? Don’t look for me anymore.”\n　　”What are you talking about, kid?” Murong Danling held him back and refused to let him go. “What did your stepmother say to you? Why are you so easily fooled by her?”\n　　”She didn’t coax me.” Shen Hui yelled, and then pulled the corner of the clothes out of her hand. “I’m not a fool, I can tell the difference between good and bad.”\n　　After he yelled, he turned and ran. The child was so fast that Murong Danling couldn’t catch him at all. Huihua and yiyi heard the noise and came over. Seeing Shen Hui ignoring his mother and running away, they followed him home.\n　　Murong Danling stamped her feet anxiously when she saw her son running away. Then she walked to the alley next to her. Her second brother glared at her and despised her for being useless.\n　　”If you can’t even coax your own son, what else can you do?”\n　　Murong Danling was also angry and retorted to him angrily. “If you have the ability, then go ahead. Take him away when no one is paying attention. Why don’t you go?”\n　　Her second brother looked at her like a fool: “You’ve lost your mind, haven’t you? You forgot what we discussed? Take the child away as a mother, coax him and play with him. Delay for a few days and we’ll ask Shen Haiyang for money. As long as we don’t leave any evidence and erase all traces, we can wait for the police.\n　　If they find out that it was you who took the child, at most they would criticize you for taking the child away without saying hello, causing misunderstanding.\n　　If I carry the child away and control him, that’s kidnapping. Kidnapping is something that only bandits dare to do in times of chaos. Now that we are in a peaceful time, if you are caught by the police, you will have to go to jail. We have lived here for generations. Where can I go if I break the law? I make money to enjoy myself and live a good life, not to hide from others. “\n　　”Since you don’t dare to do it, then don’t be jealous of those US dollars.”\n　　”You fucking bastard…” Her brother stared at her angrily, and she stared back at him. Her brother was so angry that he wanted to hit her, but then he put his hand down.\n　　”Okay, what’s the point of us arguing here? Find a chance to coax Shen Hui away, otherwise this matter can’t be solved.”\n　　His tone softened, and Murong Danling also relaxed. “That bastard ran away when he saw me, and didn’t even follow me.”\n　　”Look for him a few more times and be more gentle. Soften him over and over again, and then implement the plan.”\n　　”Okay. I’ll find another chance.”\n　　———————————\n　　”dad,”\n　　Shen Haiyang was startled by his son’s cry and stood up straight, turning around to see what happened to him. What happened so late at night?\n　　Shen Hui was the first to run into the yard. The child jumped into Shen Haiyang’s arms like a little cannonball. The two Huihua and yiyi who followed behind stopped in front of their mother.\n　　Shen Hui hugged his father and said nothing. Li Xia and Shen Haiyang looked up at the Huihua. The little girl drank a sip of water handed to her by her mother, and then began to explain.\n　　”Um, Auntie was here to see my brother.”\n　　Shen Hui suddenly raised his head and said, “Don’t say anything. Don’t mention her.”\n　　Well, this time they all shut up. Huihua was so frightened that she was as quiet as a cicada and dared not speak. Shen Haiyang saw that his son was very emotional and did not ask any more questions. He reached out and patted him to comfort him. At night, Yiyi went to bed and quietly told his mother that it was Murong Danling who came to see Shen Hui.\n　　”I didn’t hear what he said. My sister and I heard my brother yelling and went over, then ran back with him. Oh, Dongdong and I lost two games of playing dungeon, and we haven’t won them back yet.”\n　　”You little…”\n　　The little guy put his arms around his mother’s neck and rubbed his chubby face against her. “Mom, you are so nice. My brother’s mother is so mean. Last time she called my brother a fool, and today she seems to have called him a fool too. No wonder my brother doesn’t like her.”\n　　A child’s likes and dislikes are so simple, he doesn’t understand complicated things, but when he saw Murong Danling getting angry at Shen Hui, he felt that she was not a good person.\n　　”So if your mother scolds you, you will also think that she is bad and hate her?”\n　　”Mom, are you scolding me because I did something wrong?”\nThe child’s childish question made Li Xia silent. It turned out that such a young child was also entangled in right and wrong, and would care so much about whether he deserved to be punished. If you don’t respect him, he will also bear grudges after being wronged again and again. When the relationship is established, cracks appear again and again, which makes the child feel a kind of desire and resistance to his parents.\nUnfortunate people use their whole lives to heal their childhood, while lucky people use their childhood to heal their whole lives. This shows that the original family has a profound impact on people.\n　　”If you do something wrong, Mom will scold you.”\n　　”Ah?” The little guy first stepped back questioningly, then nodded as if he remembered something and said, “Oh. Mom, it seems like you haven’t scolded me for a long time.”\n　　Li Xia smiled and pinched his cheek: “Why, do you miss the days when your mother spanked you?”\n　　”No, no.” He said these words quickly and hastily, fearing that his mother would slap him. The little guy was very tactful and put his arms around his mother’s neck and said coquettishly: “I like the mother I have now.”\n　　”Mom also likes obedient Yi Yi.” Li Xia lowered her head and kissed the child, then reached out and patted him to coax him: “Go to sleep quickly.”\n　　”Mom, can I have a meat bun tomorrow?”\n　　”Okay. Go to sleep, or I won’t give you the meat buns.”\n　　After coaxing her son to sleep, she went out to see that the lights in Shen Hui’s room were already off. She closed the door of the outer room and went back to the main room to rest. After washing up and getting into bed, Shen Haiyang put down the newspaper in his hand and suddenly asked her about Shen Hui again.\n　　”Did the newspaper say what happened to the child?”\n　　Li Xia shook her head: I didn’t pay attention. The newspaper was ordered by the village, and I just happened to see it. There were some issues and some were not consistent. ”\nAfter saying that, she thought for a moment and suggested: “Find some time to talk to Murong Danling.”\n　　The man nodded, then sighed deeply: “It may not be useful. Murong Danling is very self-centered, or selfish. It is difficult for others to persuade her to do something she has decided on.”\n　　Because Murong Danling really came to look for the child, in the middle of the night, outdoors where the parents couldn’t reach her. What did she want to do? To secretly take the child away? Shen Haiyang worked at the Procuratorate, and he knew that she definitely had bad intentions, but he didn’t dare to force her. So he reiterated to Shen Hui the next day that he was not allowed to go alone with Murong Danling.\n　　”I remember Daddy and I won’t go alone with her.”\n　　”You are not allowed to go alone with anyone from the Murong family.”\n　　”Okay I know.”\n　　Li Xia made egg dumpling soup for the train this afternoon. Shen Hui saw her busy figure in the kitchen. She served the hot food to the table when they came in. Her cooking was delicious. After grandma left, the house felt like home with her.\n　　”Mom, what can I do to help?”\n　　”No, just sit down and eat, everything is ready.”\n　　The child’s call of “Mom” today seemed different from before, with a different feeling than before. Li Xia didn’t think much about it, she was happy that the child got along well with her.\n　　After dinner, the two older children cleaned up the dishes, and Li Xia washed the clothes that had been changed, so that they can dry and could be packed into the suitcase when she left in the afternoon. In the afternoon, she collected the clothes from the line and looked back to see that her son’s white short-sleeved shirt had a large black spot on his chest.\n　　”Fang Ruyi, where have you been?”\n　　The little guy looked down at himself, then slid and hid behind Shen Haiyang. His mother had just changed his new clothes for him, and he was lying on the stone steps outside.\n　　”You’re still hiding. Come here, or I’ll beat you up.”\n　　”Dad, Dad, help me.”\n　　Seeing Li Xia coming angrily, the little guy grabbed Shen Haiyang’s pants tightly. Shen Haiyang stretched out his hand to protect him and prevented Li Xia from fighting with the child. Li Xia gritted her teeth when she saw his little black hand and pulled him over.\n　　”Hurry and wash your hands. Your own clothes are stained, but it’s not enough, you want to smear your father’s too.”\n　　”Mom, I washed my hands. I didn’t pull Dad. I just…”\n　　”Okay, wash it clean with soap.”\n　　Let him wash it himself, she stood up angrily and took clean clothes for the brat to change. “Eight sets of clothes a day won’t last forever, you kid, can’t you be as clean as your brother, at least wear it for a day.”\n　　”My brother also went up the stairs to play just now.”\n　　”But my clothes are not dirty.”\n　　Shen Hui was wearing the same thing as Yi Yi, a white short-sleeved shirt and black shorts. Seeing his brother being scolded, he deliberately teased the little guy. Yi Yi looked up at him, then pouted and almost cried.\n　　”My brother is a bully. He is taller than me… wuwu…”\n　　”Ha ha……”\n　　He cried, and everyone else laughed unscrupulously. Li Xia patted him and urged him to hurry up, “It’s late. If you miss the train later, you can’t go to Beijing. I’ll leave you alone at home.”\n　　” I don’t want.”\n　　This time he was obedient, washing his hands and face and letting his mother change his clothes. Li Xia changed the water to wash his white short-sleeved shirt, fearing that the stains would soak in for a long time and could not be washed out.\n　　He followed his brother obediently and did not run around this time. When his brother and sister packed their school bags, he also put his favorite picture books into his own school bag.\n　　Huihua helped her mother scoop water, and then whispered to her mother. “Just now my brother’s biological mother came again, not far from our front door. But my brother ran back to our house when he saw her, and she stamped her feet in anger. She stared at our door for a while before leaving.”\n　　What is Murong Danling doing? Is she trying to trick the child again? Or is she planning something else? Forget it. Anyway, I have already told Shen Haiyang, and he will take care of everything. She is a stepmother and has not been in this family for long. She is not strong enough to compete with the biological mother. Looking at Shen Haiyang’s arrangement, he is not optimistic about the Murong family. It can be said that he is on high alert. Unless the other party uses force against their whole family, do they dare to do so in broad daylight?\n　　After packing up, the family set off. The children on the train were very curious about the sleeper berths. It was also Li Xia’s first time to sit on a sleeper berth. She tried lying on it and then spoke to Shen Haiyang in a low voice.\n　　”It doesn’t look big, but it’s quite comfortable to lie on. Hey, have you ever sat on a sleeper before?”\n　　”I’ve sat in it while on a business trip.”\n　　”very nice.”\n　　The sleeper berth was much safer than the hard seat, but she didn’t dare to let her guard down. At night, Li Xia slept with her head facing inwards, and put her small bag under her pillow. This was all her assets, the first money she planned to use to start a business. Nowadays, banks don’t have interbank deposit and exchange services, and it’s inconvenient to remit money at any time, so she can only carry it with her.\n　　Shen Hui and Yi Yi were in the middle bunk, and the two children were very happy about it. There was a railing in the middle bunk, and the two of them were quite quiet when they slept, so they shouldn’t fall off. The two of them were on both sides, kicking their feet back and forth in the middle. Only after being scolded by Shen Haiyang did they behave themselves and stopped moving around.\n　　”One person on each side is not allowed to play like that anymore. It’s not fun to fall from such a height.”\n　　”Okay.”\n　　After a nap on the train, they arrived at their destination early the next morning. Shen Haiyang saw her yawning twice in a row and asked her if she didn’t sleep well at night.\n　　”Well, I didn’t dare sleep too deeply.”\n         “Let’s go to the guesthouse and catch up on some sleep.”\n“It’s okay, I just didn’t sleep well the previous night, it won’t affect me.”\nAfter getting off the train, they first found a guesthouse to stay in, and then Shen Haiyang applied for an international long-distance call. The time was set for two days later. Li Xia wanted to go to the hospital for a check-up first, but Shen Haiyang saw that the children were so excited and said he would take them out to play for a day first.\n\n\nT/N :- HELLO GUYS , PLEASE DO COMMENT IF YOU LIKE THE NOVEL OR NOT OR ANY OF YOUR THOUGHTS, AS IT ENCOURAGES ME TO WORK HARD.\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTION FOR NOVEL TO TRANSLATE DO LET ME KNOW!!!!\nTHANK YOU <3\n",

Shen Haiyang saw her yawning twice in a row and asked her if she didnât sleep well at night.\nããâWell, I didnât dare sleep too deeply.â\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â âLetâs go to the guesthouse and catch up on some sleep.â\nâItâs okay, I just didnât sleep well the previous night, it wonât affect me.â\nAfter getting off the train, they first found a guesthouse to stay in, and then Shen Haiyang applied for an international long-distance call. The time was set for two days later. Li Xia wanted to go to the hospital for a check-up first, but Shen Haiyang saw that the children were so excited and said he would take them out to play for a day first.\nThe next day, He took the children to watch the flag-raising ceremony, and then took them to climb the Great Wall. This project was the most physically demanding. Yi Yi was too tired to climb in the second half, so Li Xia carried him up.\nShen Hui was also very tired, but the vastness of the Great Wall made him feel open-minded. The child had a smile on his face, and the previous gloom disappeared without a trace.\nâAre you tired? Do you want dad to carry you on his back?â\nThe boy subconsciously glanced at Li Xia and her son behind him, then shook his head at his father. âHow old am I? Iâm not Yi Yi. Dad, Mom must be tired carrying Yi Yi, how about you take her place for a while?â\nâOkay, Dad will carry him.â\nThe little guy changed to Shen Haiyangâs back and said happily that his fatherâs back was wider than his motherâs. âDad, if you are tired, put me down. I think I can walk again.â\nâBe good and stay here. Youâve walked a lot these past few days. Donât ruin your short legs.â\nâIâm not short-legged.â\nâWhose is shorter than yours?â\nâHa haâ¦â¦â\nHis brother, sister, and mother laughed unscrupulously, and he lay listlessly on his fatherâs back. âI need to eat more and grow taller. Next time I come, I want to carry my mother on my back.â\nShen Haiyang praised the child: âYou have great ambition. But you will only carry your mother on your back?â\nâAnd Dad too.â Shen Haiyang was just happy for a moment when he heard the little guy continue, âBut Dad is too tall and must be very heavy. So I will let my brother carry him.â\nLi Xia raised her hand and patted his little butt. âYou are so cunning. You just said you would carry dad on your back. A man should keep his word.â\nâOkay, then Iâll try my best to grow taller. When Iâm taller than dad, Iâll be able to carry him on my back.â\nThe family climbed the Great Wall, stopping and chatting, laughing. Today was a cloudy day without any sun. They had a picnic on the Great Wall at noon, and took out the paper and pen they brought with them to do some impromptu sketching.\nâMom, the feeling of seeing the real thing is different from what is in the picture or what the teacher said. The Great Wall is so wide and big, I donât know what words to use.â\nâThen donât say, you can just draw.â\nâIâm drawing. But Iâm not good at it. When can I draw as well as the teacher?â\nâLearn from the teacher, and one day you will become a teacher too.â\nâUm.â\nThey were having a picnic in the breeze, mother and daughter were whispering to each other, while the two sons were surrounding Shen Haiyang and asking him to tell stories about the Great Wall.\nâWe are now at the Badaling Great Wall, which is an important pass of the Great Wall. Our great leader once wrote the famous poem that one is not a true man if he has not been to the Great Wallâ¦â¦â\nShen Haiyang and his two children talked about geography and humanities. The children gained knowledge and broadened their horizons, and for a while they were immersed in the vast history of the past. Compared with this, the previous entanglements seemed nothing. When they returned, Shen Hui held his fatherâs hand and happily jumped on the stairs.\nâDad, Iâll be in the first grade when school starts.â\nâso what?â\nâSo Iâm the big kid.â\nâWhat does the older kid want to do?â Yi Yi at the side responded, âBrother wants a new schoolbag, right?â\nShen Hui looked up and glared at him: âGo, stop talking nonsense.â Then he said to his father: âI just want to say that I have grown up and will not get upset easily anymore.â\nShen Haiyang took the opportunity to praise: âThatâs great. Managing emotions is the first step to becoming an adult. As you get older, you should be able to control your emotions more easily. Crying and throwing tantrums at every turn are childish behavior. The first sign of growing up is that you can calmly analyze and deal with things when you encounter them. Of course, you are still young, so you can consider asking adults for help when you encounter problems.â\nâUm.â\nYiyi was lying on his fatherâs back, feeling very comfortable, with his head tilted on Shen Haiyangâs shoulder. âI will also tell mom if I had anything to say.â\nShen Hui patted him on the back and said, âYou little follower, you do whatever others do.â\nâHaha, Iâm imitating my brother.â\nLi Xia reached out and patted Shen Haiyang, then reached out and held Yi Yi in her arms. âYou donât look well, are you feeling unwell?â\nShe just said that she carried the child, but he insisted on showing off and said that he was a man with strength. When he went up just now, his face was red and he said it was normal after exercise, but why is his face pale now? She was shocked when she saw it just now.\nShen Haiyang wiped the sweat off his face, stopped and took a few deep breaths. âItâs okay, I might be a little tired, just go back and rest for a while.â\nSeeing that dad said he was tired, Yi Yi stepped down from momâs arms and said he would walk on his own. âItâs not tiring to go down the stairs, Iâll just walk slowly.â\nHuihua came over and held his hand: âFollow sister.â\nâOkay.â The little guy jumped down a step and stretched out his left hand to Shen Hui: âBrother, come on, letâs go together.â\nâWe agreed that you should walk carefully. I donât have the energy to play flying with you today.â\nThe little guy held his sisterâs hand with one hand and his brotherâs hand with the other. âI donât want to play. I will walk by myself obediently.â\nThe children walked by themselves. Li Xia carried Shen Haiyangâs bag on her back. She supported him with one hand and observed his expression from time to time. The man saw that she was nervous and smiled to reassure her.\nâItâs okay. Look, I look much better now.â\nThe color on his face had indeed returned, and his gentle features made people feel like spring breeze when he smiled. But this did not make Li Xia feel at ease, so she arranged for the three children to stay in the guesthouse the next day and accompanied Shen Haiyang to the hospital.\n",

After thinking of many ways, they finally had an ultrasound done in the evening when they were about to get off work. Pulse Doppler ultrasound is used to examine heart diseases more clearly. The city hospital does not have this machine.\nAfter rushing to finish all the tests before leaving, many results would have to wait until tomorrow, so Li Xia took him to the cafeteria for dinner. The hospital cafeteria had a rich variety of food, including noodles, rice, porridge, and cakes.\nâWhat do you want to eat?â Li Xia asked.\nâLetâs eat noodles.â\nâOkay.â\nThey both loved noodles, so Li Xia found a table for him to sit down, and she went to the window to get food. Each of them had a bowl of Datong sliced noodles, plus two braised eggs, two pieces of braised tofu, and two meatballs.\n\n\n\nShen Haiyang stood up and served the meal. Li Xia just sat down and stood up to scoop two bowls of noodle soup. The two of them ate in silence in the noisy environment. After finishing, they found a cool corner to sit and wait for the result.\nShe returned to the guesthouse at night feeling anxious and unable to sleep with her eyes open. She heard some noise and then Shen Haiyang hugged her from behind.\nâGo to sleep. There will always be a way out when you reach the mountain. Itâs useless to think so much.â\nLi Xia didnât say anything, not knowing what to say. A hemp rope always breaks at the thinnest part, and misfortune always picks on the unfortunate. Are they really that unfortunate? No, she believed that good things come hard. Since she could change his fate of dying before waking up, she could definitely cure his illness now.\nâYes,â she replied softly, turning around and hugging his waist. âIf you are sick, we will actively seek treatment. Nowadays, medicine is advanced and it will definitely be cured.â\nShen Haiyang was silent for a while, then chuckled softly. âGo to sleep.â He didnât say anything sentimental, but thanked God countless times in his heart for bringing her to him. Of course, at this moment, he couldnât help but feel sorry for her. If his life was destined to be restless, it would inevitably implicate her.\nWould she agree to a divorce with property division now? He knew the answer without asking, absolutely not. Not to mention that he had no shortage of money for treatment, even if he did, she would work hard to earn money. Husband and wife, support each other. She was also practicing it. Since he knew her intention, all he could do was to actively cooperate with the treatment, and he couldnât do the bloody drama of pretending to cheat and drive her away.\nShe had already been betrayed by her husband once, and was seriously hurt psychologically. He couldnât hurt her again under the pretext of doing good for her. Since they were already close relatives, they should stick together. Even if he really left one day, he should let her know that she was deeply loved. His heart was warm and confident.\nThe next morning, they went to the hospital and waited for the various test reports. They walked into the doctorâs office nervously. The doctor took the test results and looked at them carefully. âHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, have you had chest tightness and shortness of breath recently?â\nShen Haiyang nodded silently, and the doctor listened to him with the stethoscope again. âThere is a heart murmur and a fourth heart sound. The B-ultrasound results confirm that it is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.â\nâDoctor, do we need to be hospitalized? How much will it cost? Can you arrange for us to be hospitalized today?â\nUpon hearing that he was indeed ill, Li Xia was anxious to ask about the specific treatment. She brought a lot of cash with her, which should be enough for the treatment. If not, she would have to go back home. In short, he had to get treatment as soon as possible. Shen Haiyang saw that she was more nervous than himself, so he reached out and held her hand.\nThe two peopleâs clasped hands were sweaty, but Li Xia was too nervous to notice. Heart disease, this is probably a serious problem. The heart is not like other organs, if it stops beating for a few minutes, it will be fatal.\nShe was worried, but Shen Haiyang was calmer than her, and his mind was still thinking normally. When the enemy comes, the general will stop it, and when the water comes, the earth will cover it. Everyoneâs life trajectory is different. If his life is destined to be unusual, then there is nothing to complain about.\nâDonât worry too much. Your husbandâs condition is mild, not serious. Currently, this disease can be relieved and controlled by taking medicine, and there is no need to be hospitalized. New treatment methods are being studied both at home and abroad, and perhaps there will be better and more effective methods soon.â\nâDoes that mean it canât be cured at present?â Shen Haiyang asked.\nâYes. But donât worry too much, your case is not serious. As long as you pay attention to your daily life and take medicine, you can control it. There are cases showing that as long as it is properly controlled, people can still be alive and well in their seventies or eighties.â\nUpon hearing this, Li Xia heaved a sigh of relief. As long as it wasnât life-threatening,\nThere is hope. Medical technology is advancing, and who knows, there might be a better way one day. Even if they need to take medicine for the rest of their lives, as long as their lives are not in danger, they can afford it.\nâThis disease cannot be cured by medicine. Apart from waiting for better treatments, you should pay attention to your daily life. Donât get too excited, donât get too tired, donât get angryâ¦ In short, try to keep your emotions stable and donât let them fluctuate too much.â\nHearing what the doctor said, Li Xia regretted it very much. Yesterday, they climbed the Great Wall, and he even carried yiyi on his back for a long section. Fortunately, nothing irreversible happened.\nâDoctor, how did he get this disease?â\nâFifty to sixty percent of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is inherited in families, and thirty to forty percent is sporadic.â The male doctor looked at Shen Haiyang: âDoes anyone in your family have this disease?â\nShen Haiyang nodded: âI heard that my great-grandfather suffered from heart disease. But I donât know the details.â\nThe male doctor nodded and said nothing more. He prescribed medicine for them and told them the precautions again. Shen Haiyang asked at this time: âIf there is a possibility of inheritance, then is it better for my son to get a check-up as well?â\nâDid he have any symptoms?â\nânothing now.â\nâThat may be all right. But it would be best to get a checkup to be sure.â\nâOkay.â\nComing out of the hospital, she held everything in her hands. Looking at his empty hands, Shen Haiyang smiled and shook his head.\nâWife, you are too nervous. The doctor said that I should just be careful not to overexert myself. Itâs fine to lift something normally. Iâm not made of paper. I wonât break if I poke it.â\nâBetter be careful. Donât lift anything heavy in the future, and donât hug Yi Yi anymore. That kid weighs nearly 40 kilograms, very heavy.â\nShen Haiyang smiled and said nothing more. He knew his own health. He felt uncomfortable on the Great Wall yesterday, and he gave yiyi to her without any hesitation. He put the quick-acting heart-saving pills prescribed by the doctor in his coat pocket and held her hand when he went out.\nâDonât worry too much. Maybe there will be a cure soon. And my case is mild. Didnât the doctor say that there are cases that show people can live to 70 or 80? So donât worry. I will definitely stay with you for the rest of your life.â\nâYes.â Li Xia smiled and didnât want to add to his psychological burden. âIâll make an international call tomorrow. If I can get through, please ask your father to help me ask. Maybe there is a treatment method overseas now.â\nAfter a while, Shen Haiyang nodded silently in response to her expectant gaze. He had never met his father, let alone gotten along with him, so he felt a little embarrassed to talk about this in their first communication. But seeing how worried she was, he could only agree.\nThe two did not tell their children much about the hospital checkup. They just said that their father was not in good health and they should not make him angry in the future.\nâEspecially Yiyi, you are not allowed to let daddy hold you in his arms or carry you on his back anymore.â\nThe mother spoke sternly, and the little one nodded obediently, and came over to hold Shen Haiyangâs hand. His pretty face was raised, and his big watery eyes were filled with concern.\nâDad, does it hurt?â Shen Haiyang habitually reached out to hug him, but the little guy dodged. âDad, donât hug me.â\nShen Haiyang laughed softly, and the three children all looked at him with burning eyes. He squatted down to explain to the children and touched their hair one by one.\nâDad is fine, he just has a little problem.â He stretched out his hand and pinched Yiyiâs cheek, answering his previous question. âDad is not in pain, and itâs okay to hold Yiyi when he is in good condition.â\nâoh.â\nThe children relaxed, and Shen Hui let out a long sigh. Seeing his father stand up, he reached out to help him. His father was his heaven, and he felt safe only when he was around him. His grandmother was gone, and his mother was like that. He couldnât imagine what he would do if his father was not around.\nâDad, do you want some water? Iâll go get you some.â\nâDonât worry, go and have fun. Daddy just has a minor problem, he doesnât need anyone to take care of him.â After saying that, seeing that the child still didnât move, he reached out and touched him to comfort him. âReally, Daddy is fine, donât worry.â\nLi Xia didnât expect the children to care so much. She just wanted to tell them to pay attention. Seeing that the little ones were beginning to worry, she said nothing and took them out for dinner.\nEverything is normal now. This time they finally believe that what their father said was just a minor problem.\nWhen they reached the food restaurant they ordered,Braised pork elbow, braised pork chop, clear-boiled lamb, spicy diced chicken, blanched Chinese cabbage, persimmon and egg. After a full meal of meat today, she did not forget to ask the waiter for two vegetarian dishes.\nThe next day, they went to the post office to make an international long-distance call. Because of her previous experience,she hired an interpreter this time â a teacher from the Foreign Languages Department.\nAfter a busy tone of âbeep, beep, beep,â the other party finally picked up, still speaking in a foreign language. Shen Haiyang handed the receiver to the translator. The two parties only heard a chattering exchange, and then the translator told him that the other party said that Mr. Shen was in the hospital.\nHe had been bedridden since last year and had been discharged and re-admitted several times. Upon hearing the news, Shen Haiyang asked him to inform the other party of his situation and asked him to pass it on.\nThe call went through, but it didnât seem to go through. They couldnât say what they wanted to say, and they didnât know if the other party would help to pass on the message. The other party said that the old man had suffered from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy for many years and was recently hospitalized for recuperation. The letters from home said that Shen Haiyangâs half brother handled it, and he didnât know what was going on. After paying the money and parting ways with the translator, the couple walked and talked on the sidewalk in no hurry.\nâI found the root of the problem. Your father also suffers from this disease.â\nâThen you donât have to worry. Heâs already over 60 this year. Iâm sure heâll be fine.â\nLi Xia smiled. Suddenly, a real case appeared before her eyes, which seemed to give her more confidence. âDo you think itâs your brother who is playing tricks? Otherwise, how could we not receive any of the letters?â\nâMaybe. But it could also be that the old man is seriously ill, so he doesnât want him to worry too much.â\nâHow about we apply to go abroad? We can visit your father and get checked abroad. Maybe we can get you treated.â\nâItâs not that easy. Donât worry, maybe there will be a reply soon.â\nâThe last time I called, the servant told your brother, and he was the one who handled the letters. The old man probably doesnât know weâre in touch with him yet. I absolutely donât believe that this matter has nothing to do with your brother whom youâve never met.â\nâDonât think too much, just let it go.â\nâOkay.â Shen Haiyang was gentle and open-minded, and didnât seem to care about the illness at all. Li Xia was also influenced by him and seemed to think it was really nothing.\nâLetâs go, take Huihui to the hospital and get a checkup so we can rest assured.â\nThey left Huihua and yiyi at the guesthouse while they took Huihui to the hospital. They had already made an appointment for an ultrasound scan that day, so they could do it today, and it was early, so they got the results before the closing time.\nThe doctor had already listened to Shen Huiâs heart. He looked at the results and said to them, âThe child is healthy. Donât worry about it.â\n",
    "32": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c23-2/\nComing out of the hospital, Shen Haiyang felt relaxed. He held his son’s hand and the two looked at each other and smiled. He didn’t think his own illness was a big deal, but it would be troublesome if it was passed on to his child. If he had known that he carried such a gene, he might have chosen not to have children. Li Xia took a deep breath and talked about her original plan.\n“Originally, we planned that you would take the children back after everything was over, and I had to go to the south. Now that things are like this, how about I send you back to the city first?”\n“Do you really think I’m made of paper?”\nThe doctor said that it would be fine if we just needed to be careful. Li Xia smiled and said, “Then let’s stick to the original plan. I’ll go buy the tickets and we’ll go our separate ways tomorrow.”\nHis illness was not an emergency as long as he paid attention to it. He also had emergency medicine with him. He should be fine if he told the children to be good. He wanted to go with her to buy tickets, but Li Xia strongly asked him to go back to the guesthouse first.\n“If I can’t buy it for you, I’ll find another way. Otherwise, you’ll owe me a favor and you’ll have to pay it back in the future.”\nIt was very difficult to buy tickets for this section. She queued at the train station for an entire afternoon before finally buying a sleeper berth for the day after tomorrow. She bought two tickets for them and a seat ticket for herself to Guangzhou.\nIncreasing income and reducing expenditure, they must find ways to make money and save money. Their illnesses were minor, so the responsibility of saving money fell on her. There were two main things. The sleeper berth to Guangzhou would take five days to get, and she couldn’t wait.\nAfter dinner, Shen Haiyang went out, and she told the children in the house. “Be obedient on the road, don’t run around and make Dad worry. He has a bad heart, especially don’t get him angry. If you see that he doesn’t look right, remind him to take medicine. Have you remembered everything?”\nThe three little ones nodded obediently, she also gave special instructions to yiyi. “Follow your sister closely on the way, Huihua, take good care of your brother. Keep a close eye on him and make sure he is not kidnapped. If you are kidnapped to the deep mountains and forests, you will never see us again in this life, do you understand?”\nThe little one was lively and curious, so she could only give him a few more instructions and took out three dimes, one for each of them. Money should be spent where it counts and life should be spent where it counts. If you let the children be tempted by others for a snack, it would be a big loss.\n“Don’t eat water or food given by strangers. If you want to eat something, buy it yourself. Don’t talk too much to strangers. Once you get in the car, you three will have fun by yourselves. Do you remember that?”\n“remember.”\nThe little guys happily put away the money, and they had already thought about what to buy when they got home. As for the journey, their mother bought them a lot of delicious food, so they didn’t want to eat anything.\nThe next day, her train was more than an hour earlier than theirs. After Shen Haiyang knew that she had bought a seat ticket, he insisted on making a phone call. Then he used his connections to exchange the seat ticket for a sleeper. He had to find a way to repay the debt of favor. It was too tiring to sit on a hard seat for such a long journey. He didn’t stop his wife from starting her own business, but he would do whatever he could for her within his ability.\n“Be careful on the road, drink plenty of water and don’t get angry.”\n“Okay I will.”\nThe train started to move with a clang. Li Xia climbed onto her berth and lay down comfortably. But she was still very alert. There were several thousand yuan in her bag. If she lost it, all her hard work for more than half a year would go to waste. She would be heartbroken.\nThe clothes, shoes and socks she wore today were neither new nor old, neither flashy nor embarrassing. She was the kind that would be hard to find in a crowd of embarrassment. The bag of money was tied to her abdomen, making her look like a pregnant woman.\nAs the light outside the window dimmed, the lights in the carriage came on. Many people started to prepare for dinner, and she took out the pancakes she brought from her bag. She ate slowly, one mouthful at a time, with the water she got on the train. She was so simple that she was not noticeable in the crowd, and no one paid much attention to her.\nAt that time, trains had not yet been accelerated, and it took several days to travel thousands of kilometers. She arrived at her destination safely because she was wearing simple clothes and carrying a bag, and she didn’t talk much to people.\nIn the second half of the journey, the toilets on the train were packed with people and there was no way to get in, so as soon as we got off the train, we hurried to find the toilet. She carried her small bag with her and tied it around her waist, and her loose clothes covered her tightly.\nTaking advantage of her own advantages, she carried a large amount of money and asked around along the way to take the bus to find wholesale factories. She came to the forefront of the times, and it was indeed different from the mainland. The prosperity began to emerge, factories and shops were everywhere, and information was exchanged in various dialects in the morning teahouse. When she didn’t understand, she would speak and gesture.\nShe found a newly opened clothing factory, and the factory salesroom was already crowded with people. The styles were new and the prices were low, so people who wanted to do business were crowding in the salesroom.\n“Tomorrow, the sale will officially begin tomorrow. Everyone, prepare your cash and come early tomorrow.”\nThe factory manager shouted at the top of his lungs that the samples from this factory were well made and had the latest styles, so the most people gathered at the door. Everyone was driven out but was reluctant to leave, so they squatted or stood near the sales department.\nLi Xia also found a corner to sit down. She had finished the dry food in her bag. It was too hot on the train and she couldn’t change her clothes. She lowered her head and smelled the stench of sweat.\nSeeing that it was almost noon, she took a break and found a canteen. There was already a shop opened by Hong Kong people here, and the sign at the door read Hong Kong-style wonton noodles.\nShe went in and had a bowl of noodles. It was the first time she had noodles and wontons. The taste was really good. After eating, she went out and found a public toilet. The water temperature was not cold at noon. She washed her hair under the tap, wiped her body with a towel and changed clothes. She also washed the clothes she took off, and after returning to the factory, she found a tree branch to hang on and dry them quickly.\nAs night fell, some people chose to go to the guesthouse, and there were still many people scattered at the door. Li Xia stayed nearby with her bag, taking a nap in the corner leaning against the bag of clothes, making do with it at night.\nThe next day, everyone started queuing up before daybreak. Li Xia was nearby and had been paying attention, so she lined up very close to the front. They thought the store would open and everyone would go in one by one, but when they heard some movement inside, the line started to get chaotic.\nWhen the door was about to open, everyone started to squeeze forward. She couldn’t help but sigh.\nFortunately, she had foresight. She was at the front of the queue, and with her years of experience, she managed to squeeze in and enter the store.\n“Don’t all squeeze in, the first ten people come.”\nSure enough, the person in charge started to drive people away, and Li Xia happened to be among the ten people. The first batch paid one by one and chose from more than a dozen styles. Li Xia had already seen the pattern, workmanship, fabrics, styles, etc. of this store before, so she paid 8,500 yuan directly and took the receipt to choose the style and number she liked.\nAfter selecting the goods, she went to the warehouse next door to get them. She could not carry 8,500 yuan worth of goods by herself. The factory provided her with large sacks, and she went outside to find a tricycle that was specially used to transport goods. She took them to the train station and bought a ticket to return that day.\nThis time, there was a lot of cargo, so she could only check it in with the train. She didn’t buy a sleeper on the return trip, so she took a hard seat back to the provincial capital. On the way, she helped the crew clean up and successfully occupied the floor under a three-person bench. She mopped it clean, spread out some clothes and slept there at night.\nAlthough this place doesn’t smell good and there’s a risk of children getting wet if they sit there, you can lie down and stretch your legs so you don’t have to hold it in for a long time and get edema in your lower limbs. She didn’t have any children, so she quickly grabbed a seat first.\nA woman who was also taking a long-distance bus took up a seat between two people when there were few people on the bus at the beginning, and curled up to sleep on it. She looked disdainful when she saw Li Xia cleaning under the chair. But when the seats were almost full in the evening, she could only sit back and lean against the chair, while Li Xia lying flat next to her made her envious.\n“I wish I had taken a seat under the chair earlier.” After mumbling to herself, she squatted down and patted Li Xia’s legs. “Hey, is the ground really cold?”\nLi Xia leaned over to face her. “Not cold.”\n“really?”\n“really.”\nThe woman tried it with her hands and feet, and it was indeed not cold. But there was a big box under her seat, so she couldn’t lie down like Li Xia. She regretted it so much that she couldn’t fall asleep because her hands and feet were tired. Every time she saw Li Xia, she envied her.\nLi Xia heard this from people who traveled far away in her previous life, and she took the opportunity to put it into practice this time. The result was very good. She slept comfortably under the chair all night, and she also exchanged all the money she had with her for cargo consignment. She didn’t worry about losing money, and she slept soundly.\n“Not bad, it saves money and is comfortable.”\nShe muttered to herself as she went to find the place responsible for shipping the goods. Thinking that there were too many things for her to carry alone, she immediately went out and went home first. Today was Wednesday, and Shen Haiyang was probably not there.\n“Mom, why are you back?”\n“Mother,”\nThe three children were playing in the alley, and when they saw her, they ran towards her. She said she would be gone for about ten days, but she returned in less than a week. Seeing the expectant eyes of the little ones, she suddenly remembered that she had been busy buying goods and forgot to bring anything for the children.\n“Things went smoothly, so Mom came back early. I didn’t have time to buy anything for you, so I’ll give you 50 cents each. Go buy whatever you want to eat.”\nThe children didn’t argue. It was only 50 cents, so their mother was absolutely generous. After putting the money in her trouser pocket, Li Xia went into the yard to ride her tricycle.\n“Huihua and Huihui, you two come with me to the train station to pick up the goods. Yiyi, you just stay at home and be good.” It was noon and everyone in the breakfast shop had gone home from work. She needed someone to help watch over the things, and the two children were perfect for it.\n“Mom, I want to go too.”\n“Okay, be good and don’t run around. Just follow your brother and sister closely. If you run around, mom will beat you.”\n“I know.”\nShe took her three children to the railway station to pick up goods, and the consignment center moved out several large bags of her things. The two children helped her carry them together, she carried one end and the two children carried one end, and one sat in front of the tricycle outside to watch over the things.\nAfter putting down the bag, she took a deep breath and wiped the sweat off her forehead. The two children were also panting heavily from exhaustion. The clothes were still very heavy. The bag didn’t look too big, but it was definitely not light.\n“Come on, let’s go in and continue. When you’re done, mom will treat you to ice cream, jelly, and canned food.”\n“yayyy.”\n",
    "33": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c24/\nCHAPTER 24\nããAfter moving the items, Li Xia looked at the sky. It was still early in the morning and there were not many people at the shipping station. Her son was sitting alone in the cart. She suddenly raised her hand and patted herself. She was so busy that she didnât know how to let such a young child stay outside alone.\nããâOkay, Mom will go in and move the things. You three stay outside and help Mom look after the cart and the goods.â\nããShen Hui said, âIâll go with you, and let Huihua and Yiyi stay outside.â The bag was so heavy, how could the mother carry it alone.\nããâNo, I can just ask someone to help me. I can carry it.â\nããâMom, thereâs no one else in there. My uncle is very busy at work and he definitely canât take care of it.â\nããHuihua also said: âMom, let brother help you. I will watch yiyi and make sure he doesnât run around.â\nããâGood. If anything seems wrong just yell.â\nããâOkay.â\nããIt was broad daylight, and she would be out soon after she went in, so the siblings should be fine. She was still a little hesitant, and an old man passing by interrupted her with a smile.\nããâDonât worry, you canât lose a child this big.â\nããIsnât it because she is afraid of losing them? She is not afraid of being kidnapped, because the two children have snacks and pocket money every day, so they will not be tempted. She is afraid of being taken away by force, because the children are too young to resist.\nããâHuihui you also stay outside with your sister. Mommy will carry the things herself. You donât have to worry about it.â\nããIt was better to be safe. No one could knock out three children and take them away in broad daylight. The cart was right in front of the shipping center. If she shouted loudly, people inside would hear her. There were also pedestrians outside. She went in to find someone to help her, and then she carried the big bag on her shoulders.\nããAfter several large bags were loaded, there was no extra space for people to sit on the cart. There was still a cargo left, so she asked the staff what to do.\nããâYou have three children with you, so just let them help look after them for you.â\nããThe child was watching the goods. What if the child lost the goods? Where could she cry? âIs there no other way?â\nããâShort-term custody, but you have to pay.â You have three children, and you donât even have to spend money to take care of it by keeping them to look after the goods. You are such a weird woman.\nããâOkay, Iâll take care of it for two hours. Iâll come back later.â\nããAfter paying the fee, a note was attached to the goods, and someone was watching them. She would come back with the custody slip to pick up the goods. She went out to get a rope to tie up the goods on the cart, and when everything was ready, she was about to ask her child to follow slowly behind her, but when she turned around, she found that her son was gone.\nããâWhereâs Yiyi?â She looked around and shouted, âYiyi, where have you been?â\nããThe two older ones were also anxious, looking for their younger brother everywhere. Huihua even looked under the cart very experiencedly. Yiyi would hide there when he was naughty, but today there was no one there. She and her brother had just helped their mother pull the rope, and it had only been a few minutes. Where had the little brat gone?\nããâFang Ruyi, come out quickly, or Iâll beat you up.â It took her only a short time to tie the things, and he was just squatting on the ground playing. It was impossible for him to be kidnapped under her nose, so the brat must have run away on his own.\nããâYi Yi, Yi Yi, come out quickly.â HuiHua was also shouting.\nããâYiyi, Iâll buy you candy, red bean popsicles, andâ¦ whatever you want to eat. Come out quickly, come out quickly.â\nããâMother,â\nããJust when she felt her heart pounding, she saw the boy running over from the side. In less than two minutes, she was already anxious: âWhere did you run to? Do you want to be beaten? What did mother sayâ¦â\nããThe distance was not far and soon they were in front of him. The little guy was very tactful and interrupted to explain: âI went to the toilet over there. I ran back as soon as possible.â\nããLi Xia stopped in front of her son, looked at him, took a deep breath, squatted down and hugged him. Then, without saying anything, she took the child and quickly returned to the tricycle.\nããIt was a false alarm. The children were fine and the goods were also safe. Patting her chest to calm herself down, she took a deep breath and rode home, letting the three children follow behind.\nããâHold your brother tightly and stay away from the tricycle.â\nããThe two elders ones replied in unison: âOkay, I know.â\nããThe brat wanted to go to the toilet without telling her, and he scared her out of her wits. If it were in the past, Li Xia would have immediately turned her worries into anger and beat him up, but now she just took a deep breath to calm herself down, and didnât beat the child or give him a lecture.\nããThe brat must have heard them yelling. Seeing them like that, he must have been quite frightened. The panic on his face was so obvious. Since the child knew that it was wrong, she would wait until the incident was over before explaining the seriousness of the matter to him.\nããAt this moment, she was in a panic and could not control her emotions. She was afraid that if she opened her mouth, she would start to scold or even hit him. What she conveyed to the child was not her motherâs concern for him, but her rage. He would be depressed and reminded himself not to do it again, and he would also remember how fierce his mother was.\nããHe didnât mean it, he didnât mean it. People in this period didnât pay as much attention to the safety of their children as people in later generations. It wasnât long before another parent wouldnât have taken it seriously. She knew the abominations of human traffickers from reports in later generations, so she reacted so strongly.\nããAll the while, Li Xia reminded herself of the pair of frightened eyes she had just seen, turned all her emotions into motivation, and rode her bike down the road in one go.\nããThe journey home from the train station was not bumpy. The two big slopes were very gentle, one going up and one going down. When going down, she braked slowly, and when going up, the children came to help push. Although the three of them were not big, the combined strength of the three of them was still considerable, helping their mother to push up the slope smoothly.\nããThe cart was full of goods piled high. When the cart was unloading at the street gate, the neighbors passing by were curious about what it was. Someone who was familiar with Li Xia asked, and she smiled and answered that it was clothing.\nããâWe have skirts, sweaters, jackets, pants, all kinds of things, and if people want to buy then come over at night.â\nããâReally? Where did you get this stuff from? Is it expensive?â\nããâThe latest clothing from the South, absolutely good quality and low price. Iâll pack it up first, if youâre interested, come and have a look in the evening.â\nããâOh, okay.â\nããLi Xia took out the key to open the house door. Murong Danling came back from work and saw her mountain of goods. She wanted to say something to Shen Hui, but the boy opened the door and ran back home. Li Xia didnât say hello to her, and rode her bike into the yard.\nããShe was very angry with her son. After entering the next yard, she heard the neighbor say that Li Xia brought back a lot of clothes from the south. She immediately thought of the mountain of sacks she had seen just now. How much goods did she bring in? How much did so many clothes cost?\nããFor a moment, she was filled with jealousy and hated Shen Haiyang and his son. They were a pair of fools. They gave Li Xia so much money as start-up capital and didnât even give her money. Was Shen Haiyang blind? What did he like about Li Xia?\nããAnd Shen Hui is just an ungrateful person. The father and son live in a big house, but they donât think about her as a mother. He used to talk to her, but now he runs away when he sees her. The sistersâ plan has no chance to be implemented, and no one dares to use force. Shen Haiyang works in the procuratorate and has acquaintances everywhere in the public security, procuratorate and courts.\nããShe was so jealous of the goods that she was mad at the cart. After unloading the cart, Li Xia set off for the train station again. This time she bought a lot of goods, and one cart couldnât carry them all. In this era, the demand for clothing is still mainly low prices. The more goods she bought, the lower the price, so she was very bold and bought a lot at one time.\nããâYouâre back.â Shen Haiyang parked his bike in the yard and watched her prepare to go out again. âWhere are you going next?â\nããâThe train station. I havenât finished pulling the goods yet.â\nããThe man nodded: âCome on, Iâll go with you.â\nããâNo, kids, helped me bring them and gave me a push up the hill, and Iâll be back.â\nããâAm I worse than a child in your heart?â\nããShen Haiyang knew what she meant. She was just being considerate of his heart condition. But he felt that it was not serious. At least he could lead a normal life. As for the future, even if he lay in bed and did nothing, the disease would still develop. He would deal with it as it came. If it really could not be cured, he would deal with it later.\nããâWell, then.â\nããShe agreed to go with him, but it was still Li Xia who pedaled the bike. When they arrived at the train station, she went to move the goods and asked him to watch over them. The man wanted to go in to help, but she pointed at the bike and asked him to take care of it.\nããâThis cart is worth a lot of money, and there will be more goods on it later. If you donât watch it, what if it gets lost?â\nããâWatch me move the goods.â\nããâShen Haiyang,â\nããSeeing that she was getting anxious, Shen Haiyang stopped insisting. She went in to move the goods, and he only helped her when she came out to put the goods down. They were piled up high again, and she tied the goods up with ropes and fixed them on the car.\nããOn the way back, Shen Haiyang did what the children had done before, pushing the cart uphill from behind. Li Xia was afraid that he would get tired, so she pedaled with all her strength.\nããâDonât push too hard. As long as the bike doesnât fall backwards, just ignore it and Iâll pedal it myself.â\nããâOkay.â He knew what to do. When the cart went up the slope, he stood in front of his wife and asked, âLook at my face. Is it normal?â\nããHis breathing was not heavy and his complexion was fine. Li Xia nodded silently and continued to ride. The man followed her on foot, and the two talked as they walked.\nããâThe doctor said my case is mild, donât worry too much.â\nããâNo matter how minor it is, itâs still a heart problem. The heart is an organ that can kill you in an instant.â\nããHe knew she was worried about him, and smiled at his wife while adjusting his breathing as he walked. âItâs okay, this disease is not serious, and I carry quick-acting heart pills with me.â\nããAfter bringing all the consigned goods home, Li Xia began to unpack and sort them. She had just come back and was going to cook first, but Huihua had already cooked porridge, so Shen Haiyang asked her to help him make pancakes.\nããThe whole wing was filled with her things, and she took out some of the various things. This time she planned to sell them both wholesale and retail, so if anyone was willing to sell them wholesale, that would be fine.\nããâLetâs eat first.â\nããâgood.â\n",
    "34": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c24-2/\nAfter slurping her lunch, she continued to sort out the goods she had brought back. Shen Haiyang came in to help, and then asked, âYou need to apply for a business license first, right?â\nããâDo I need a business license to set up a street stall?â\nããâI almost donât care about small things, but I think you are going to do something big. If you want to develop in the future, a business license is still necessary.â\nããâOkay then. Iâll do it.â\nããThis period was very chaotic. The country was transitioning from a planned economy to a market economy. There were gray areas in many aspects. It was said that it was not allowed, but in reality no one cared. If it was not investigated, it would be fine. Once it was investigated, it might violate the law. However, she was not a parallel importer, so it would not be a big deal even if she was investigated.\nããâLi Xia, what kind of goods have you bought?â\nããBusiness came to her even before she opened her stall. The neighbors looked at her goods curiously. A daughter-in-law fell in love with a solid-colored dress and couldnât let it go. She tried on red, white, pink and other colors.\nããâHow much is this dress?â\nããâTwelve yuan and eighty cents. Iâll give you the lowest price.â\nããThe clothing market in the 1990s was full of mixed goods, and bargaining was the theme of this period. Li Xia knew that in the 1990s, bargaining was a way to double the money sold by cutting the price. She couldnât do that in the 1980s, because department stores in that period were all priced at the actual price, and the goods were not so high-end, so you couldnât fool people. If she dared to use the 1990s tricks, customers would be scared away.\nããâItâs a bit expensive.â With a monthly salary of more than 30 yuan, it was a bit painful to spend more than 10 yuan on a skirt. âSister-in-law, canât you make it cheaper? I heard that clothes are cheaper in the south. We are such close neighbors, why donât you give me a discount?â\nããThe woman who was eyeing a pair of polyester pants also agreed: âYes, sister, we are so close, you have to give it a discount.â\nããLi Xia smiled bitterly and pretended to be embarrassed. âDonât just listen to what others say. In fact, clothes in the south are also made stitch by stitch. Materials, labor, water and electricity, factories, machines, these are all costs. How much lower can it be? And these fabrics are all good. I am a small business, and I donât know if I can sell all these clothes. This is all because of the suppressed costs. If it is too low, I canât sell it.â\nããShe was selling things, her words were half true and half false. After she finished speaking, she slapped her thigh in embarrassment: âWe are neighbors, I wonât waste words. I will reduce the price of each piece by 30 cents. You can take this skirt for 12.5 yuan. It is ready-made, and the workmanship and fabric are first-class. Dacron material costs 1.1 yuan per foot in department stores. This skirt is more than 8 or 9 feet long, plus the labor fee of 3 yuan, you can calculate the cost yourself.â\nããItâs not expensive after all. The Dacron in the department store is not as good looking as this one. The workmanship is good and the style is right. Seeing that she was still hesitating, Li Xia took out another skirt.\nããâItâs made of cotton, half the price of Dacron. If you canât bear to part with it, just buy this. I buy a lot of decent clothes like this. Most people buy clothes at a bargain. I see that you make money, so I took out these few good clothes first.â\nããThe woman compared them and still preferred the new material Dacron. âNo, Iâd rather buy the good one. I earn my own money, so I can wear something good.â\nããAfter decades of planned economy, ordinary people had no idea about the profits of doing business. After hearing what Li Xia said, they thought she didnât make much money, because there were department stores selling clothes, and if they calculated it, they would think she worked hard but didnât make any money. For a while, they didnât say anything more. Several people bought the clothes they liked and left. After leaving, they were still talking about Li Xia.\nããâThis woman is really brave. See, there are so many goods. How much will she lose if she canât sell them?â\nããâOf course not. This woman is just stupid. She refused the stable job she was given. Now she has to live in the open air to do business. Itâs scary to have so much money tied up in her pocket.â\nããâYes, the dress in the department store is about the same price. But hers looks better than the one in the department store. The purchase price must be higher.â\nããEveryone was worried about losing money because they had the goods from the department store to compare. But Li Xia was calculating how much she could earn after selling this batch of goods, and how much goods she could sell to get back all her capital. Large factories and large-scale production reduce costs to the lowest level, but they donât calculate that way, and itâs not the retail price of department stores that they know.\nããShe only knew the simple abacus, which her teacher had taught her in primary school. At this moment, she was moving the beads on the abacus, with the corners of her mouth curled up and she couldnât close her mouth. Shen Haiyang came in and told her to go to bed, and she followed him out.\nããI carefully checked the house for fire prevention, and locked the door tightly when she got out. âIs the house door closed?â\nããâclosed.â\nããLooking around, the lights in the east and west wings were already off. âWhy didnât you watch TV today? The kids went to bed early.â\nããShen Haiyang raised his wrist to show her the time: âIs it still early? Itâs almost midnight.â\nããLi Xia took a look and realized it was really that late. She smiled at the man and took his arm: âNext time, donât worry about me and go to bed first.â\nããShen Haiyang smiled and shook his head, âReally? You are obsessed with money, right? Your eyes light up when you mention making money.â\nããâIsnât it good to make money?â\nããA gentleman loves money but gets it in a proper way. Although the ancients said so, there are still some people who are willing to live in poverty. Could he be the outlier? Then their three views will collide fiercely this time.\nããâItâs not bad.â Shen Haiyang went into the room, took off his pants and went to bed. Li Xia went to the washbasin to wash. He continued, âI think money is good as long as itâs enough. I have a job, a steamed bun shop, bank savings, and a house in Beijing. These are more than 99% of families. You donât have to work so hard.â\nLi Xia washed her face and applied night cream, âIâm not tired.â\nããâOkay, as long as you like it.â\nããShe didnât say that money will depreciate severely in the future. You think a lot at this time, but by then, there will be little left. Although she has invested in real estate, the money in the bank can also be invested in real estate in the future, then she will definitely not worry about her life. But she does business not only to make money. Accomplishing something brings her great spiritual satisfaction.\nããAfter returning home and having a good sleep, she went to apply for a business license the next day. After returning, she checked the business of the bun shop and found that it was basically the same as before. In order to reward everyone for their hard work, she rewarded everyone with a pair of Decca pants just in time for salary payment.\nããâOh my, I really became the boss now.â\nããâDeka pants, these pants have straight seams and look really good when worn.â\nããEveryone was delighted. Li Xia smiled and said that this was a half-year bonus. âIn the future, we will give everyone bonuses based on quarterly performance, and you can choose any clothes of the same price. So sisters, donât relax. The better the business of the bun shop, the more benefits you will get.â\nããThe food business has only been profitable in the past few years, so donât miss out. Reform and opening up have been rapid, and compared to other commodities, the growth rate of food is too low. If you want to make a lot of money from it, you have to do it on a big scale.\nããâOh, then I have to work hard in the future.â\nããâWell, you have to work harder.â\nããAfter winning over the employees of the steamed bun shop, she rode her bike to the street to set up a stall the next day.\nããNear her home. The three kids were very excited about this and helped her set up the stall.\nããT-shirts, shorts, long pants, short sleeves, and all kinds of clothing were hung on bamboo poles with hangers, and passers-by couldnât help but look over here. This street has a lot of traffic, and the stall opened in less than ten minutes.\nããThe short-sleeved shirt with a purchase price of 3.1 yuan was sold for 8.2 yuan, with a net profit of 5.1 yuan per piece.\nããâHuihua, go home and find your dad, and ask him to help mom write a wholesale and retail board.â\nããâOkay.â\nããâThe board should be bigger.â\nããSuddenly, she remembered that everyone thought she was selling goods on the street, and no one would ask about wholesale. She had to write down her intentions, so that she could attract people who also wanted to sell goods on the street.\nããSoon the little girl came back with a cardboard, followed by Shen Haiyang. The cardboard had words written on it according to her request, and Shen Haiyang asked her if it was good.\nããâIf itâs wrong, Iâll change it now.â\nããLi Xia picked it up and looked at it. There were a few big words written on it with paint. The minimum order is 20 pieces. The price can be negotiated. She nodded to the man and put the cardboard in a conspicuous place in the stall.\nããLooking back, she saw Shen Haiyang was still there, so she pushed him home. âLeave quickly, it wonât be good if someone you know sees us.â\nããâIt doesnât matter, actually.â\nããâNo, just go home quickly.â\nããâThen Iâll go. Iâll make lunch and bring it to you.â\nããâLet the child go home and get it, donât come over here.â\nããHe was a public officer, so Li Xia was very careful. The man nodded and went home, and she continued to promote her business. The novel style attracted the attention of young people, and business began to flow in after the opening.\nããThe three children helped to watch out for people stealing, while she kept bargaining with customers. Her mouth was dry all morning, so she had a simple lunch and rested for a while before continuing in the afternoon. She sold more than 100 pieces a day, so her business was definitely booming.\nããHer clothes are slightly cheaper than those sold in department stores at the same quality, and many of the styles are not available in department stores. These two factors have already attracted the attention of consumers. Those who have money can buy the expensive chemical fibers (Dacron, Deca, etc.) and those who canât afford them can buy cotton. Cotton is not as stiff as chemical fibers, but the factory she found this time has good workmanship.\nããWhen she was about to close the stall, she looked back and didnât see Yi Yi, so she quickly asked the two older ones, âWhereâs your brother? When did Yi Yi disappear?â\nããThe two children looked around and responded to her. âHe was just here, how come he disappeared in the blink of an eye?â\nããShen Hui shouted, âYiyi, Yiyi, where are you? Come out quickly.â\nããHuihua walked eastward, where a new small shop had opened. âYiyi, come out quickly, or Iâll beat you up.â\nããShe told him not to run around this morning, why wonât he listen? Li Xia looked around and saw a man leading a child in the alley to the east. She saw him from the corner of her eye and turned back with anger in her eyes.\nããâFang Zhongcheng, do you have a plan? Why didnât you tell me before you took the child away? Do you know how worried we were when you took the child away so suddenly?â\nããFang Zhongcheng felt a little annoyed and embarrassed by her yelling, but seeing how hard she was working to set up the stall, her face turning pale and red, her breathing rapid and her eyes even a little red, he couldnât help but take a deep breath and decided not to bother with her.\nããâSomeone stole your short-sleeved shirt, and I happened to run into him when Yi Yi ran after him.â The man handed her a white short-sleeved shirt and said, âDonât get angry at every turn. Your child is so young and has worked hard with you to set up a stall. As a mother, donât you feel guilty? Who said you would take good care of the child? Now, look at themâ¦â\nããâdad,â\nããâDonât talk about my mother.â\nããHuihua also came back at this time, and the siblings held hands and interrupted him in unison. Fang Zhongcheng looked at the childâs eyes full of protection for his mother, and he didnât know what it felt like. He gave up the child himself, but seeing them so close to their mother, and not even letting him say anything to blame, he felt bitter in his heart.\nããLi Xia reached out and pulled the three children over. The children had already defended her, so she did not argue with him in front of them. She gave the children money to buy popsicles. She lowered her head to clean up the stall, while Fang Zhongcheng stood there awkwardly, then walked away.\nããThe man lowered his head, his teeth were clacking. As he walked, he muttered, âI really donât know what you are after. You can obviously go to work and get a stable job with a pension after retirement, why do you have to work so hard to do small business? You used to speculate and profiteer, but now even if you let it go, people still look down on you. Whatâs in your mind, woman?â\nããLi Xia didnât care what he thought. She counted the remaining clothes while she was packing up. After she finished, she loaded the clothes into the cart and took them home. She took out her wallet and started to count the money.\nããThe daily turnover was over a thousand yuan. After checking the account book to see what clothes were sold, she estimated the net profit to be around five hundred yuan. Her hands were shaking with excitement as she counted the money.\nããMy God! For a small vendor in the 1980s, this east wind was definitely strong enough. If Fang Zhongcheng knew that she made so much money, would he still dare to look down on her?\nããIn fact, she was definitely the boss among the small vendors. The group of people who bought goods together came from all over the country, and she had the most funds and bought the most goods. The clothing factory sales department remembered her and made appointments with her for business next season.\nããâMother,â\nããâMom, did you make money?â\nããThe three children each had an ice cream cone. Huihua tore off the paper on a red bean ice cream cone and handed it to her. âIâve given Dadâs to him. This one is yours.â\nããâThanks.â\nããAfter taking a lick of the ice cream, the coolness and sweetness instantly permeated her heart. She smiled at the children, stretched out her hand and pulled Yi Yi to her side. She looked the child up and down, and then touched his little head.\nããâMom, thanks you for all the help. My son is amazing.â\nããThe little guy thought his mother was going to scold him, but it turned out to be a compliment. He was so happy that his face was not visible and he jumped a few times on the ground.\nããâYou, do you know how dangerous your behavior is? Mom knows you have good intentions, but do you think you can catch up with an adult with your small body? And what if the other party is a bad guy and kidnaps you as well?â\nããHe was scolded by his mother just when he was showing off. The little guy immediately became as wilted as a cucumber that had lost its water. He turned around to look at his brother and sister, but the two unscrupulous ones pretended not to see him. He immediately became listless and looked up at his mother, blinking pitifully.\nããLi Xia reached out and hugged her son. Although she was scolding him, there was not much anger on her face. So the child was not afraid of her, but was confused and a little aggrieved for a moment. Because there was no fear, his brain was not frightened and he could still think normally. He looked at his mother without saying anything, and carefully pondered the previous words. Then suddenly his eyes lit up, like little stars in the night.\nããâMom, are you afraid that someone will take me away from you?â\nããâYes.â Li Xia reached out and rubbed his little head. âYou must tell mom where you are going and let your brother and sister go with you. If you encounter someone stealing things again, just shout and let mom handle it. Donât be reckless and chase them on your own with your short legs. It doesnât matter if you lose a piece of clothing. If someone steals you, mom will cry and canât even find your grave.â\nããThe mother made no secret of her concern for the child. The little guy was so moved that he reached out and hugged his mother. He thought his mother was scolding him because he didnât take good care of his things, but she was afraid that she would lose him. Moreover, his mother said that it didnât matter if the clothes were lost, because he was much more important than the clothes.\nããâMom, youâre so nice.â\nããThe little guy hugged her neck tightly, and Li Xia reached out and patted his back to calm him down. The two older ones on the ground also looked at her, and she smiled and took the opportunity to spread safety knowledge to the children. Although they were not the age that human traffickers liked the most, they still took it seriously just in case.\nããâThe same goes for you two. Although you are older than Yiyi, you are still children. If you encounter danger, protect yourself first. Donât worry too much about other things. Tell your mother where you are going, otherwise the adults will worry. Do you understand?â\nããThe two children nodded obediently: âGot it.â\nããAfter she finished speaking and saw her daughter nod, she looked at Shen Hui again: âRemember? If you encounter danger, donât worry about your property. Nothing is worth mentioning compared to your life.â\nããâOkay we remember.â\nããLife is the most important thing. This seed has been planted in their hearts since childhood, and has influenced them subtly. No matter what happens, you canât gamble with your life. No matter what it is, it is as light as a feather compared to life. You canât do anything stupid for material things. Shen Hui, you must not be stubborn anymore. For anything,, you must not be stubborn.\nããItâs not worth sacrificing yourself.\n",
    "35": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c25/\nCHAPTER 25\nããAt night, she handed Shen Haiyang a pen and paper. âHelp me write a job advertisement.â\nããâRequirements ?.â\nããâFemale, between 20 to 40 years old. Good-looking, healthy, eloquent. Interested parties, please meet in person.â\nããShen Haiyang sat on a chair and ground ink, then took a brush and dipped it in ink and started writing on the paper. He quickly finished writing according to her request, and she smiled and went out to post the paper at the door of the bun shop.\nããThe next day, they did not get the job applicants, but they received a wholesaler. The couple looked quite young and lived in a city not far from the provincial capital. Facing Li Xiaâs curious eyes, they briefly explained their situation.\nããâWe both had jobs, but we started family planning a few years ago. Our first child was a girl, and our parents kept urging us to have another one. In the end,â the man smiled bitterly and spread his hands helplessly, âwe gave birth to a son, but we both lost our jobs after being reported.â\nããâSo you want to set up a street stall?â\nããâWe want to try it. Otherwise, we will starve to death.â\nããâWe have basically all the lines and styles here, with a minimum order of 20 pieces. The more you want, the lower the price. You can choose yourselves.â\nããâOkay, got it.â\nããThe couple carefully selected clothes, and Shen Hui watched silently. Huihua was careful and patient. She would look at the customers and answer their questions. She would also fold the messed-up clothes neatly. This made the stall look uncluttered and gave people a high-end feeling.\nããYiyi sat on a small stool beside his mother. When he heard the ding-ding-ding sound, he anxiously pulled his motherâs sleeve. Li Xia smiled and gave him fifty cents. The little guy hurriedly shouted at the old man with the basket.\nããâWait, I want to buy some candy.â\nããThe old man turned around and walked towards Li Xiaâs stall. Li Xia put pieces of candy on a piece of paper and asked the three of them to share it equally. Huihua wanted to give one piece to her mother, but her mother was too busy selling clothes to take care of it. She had no choice but to wrap the candy up and prepare to give it to her mother in the evening.\nããâAnd mine.â Shen Hui also kept some, and then they turned to look at Yi Yi, and the little guy also kept some of his own. âThe three of us will leave some for mom, mom has more work than us.â\nããHuihua reached out and pulled his ear: âSo you want to eat alone?â\nããâOf course not.â The little guy rubbed his ears, which didnât hurt at all, and smiled brightly at his sister. âI mean, maybe mommy wonât eat it at all, and sheâll still give it to us in the end.â\nããâThen give it to Dad.â\nããThis time Shen Hui nodded quickly, âAnyway, this is for mom and dad, you are not allowed to think about it.â\nããâI donât want it. Iâll buy it tomorrow.â\nããâYou little brat, you say youâre here to help your mom watch the stall every day, but youâre actually just thinking about the delicious food, right?â\nããThe little guy smiled triumphantly, then whispered to his brother and sister, âMom said she would buy me pig ears and pig skin jelly for lunch. They are smooth and slippery like jelly.â\nããHe just said that pig skin jelly is like jelly, and then a man came over with a pole to sell jelly. The pea jelly is slightly green, crystal clear, tender and smooth. People can be heard shouting from a distance, and the children who are shouting canât help but drool.\nããâSelling jelly.â\nããThe little guy looked at his brother and sister, then turned around quickly, his eyes suddenly bright as stars. He chewed the Ding Ding candy in his mouth, then ran to Li Xia and pulled her clothes. When she turned around, he pointed to the carrying pole not far away, and Li Xia smiled and took out another fifty cents from her pocket and gave it to him. This guy is simply the frontier of his brother and sister.\nããThe jelly cost 10 cents per bowl, and after each of the three children had a bowl, there was still 20 cents left. The three kids ran to ask for five bowls, and Huihua ran back to save the first bowl for her father to eat when he got off work.\nããThey had just eaten some candy and jelly, so they were not hungry at all. At noon, Shen Haiyang came back with cooked food and a machine-made noodle.\nããâHow about having noodle soup for lunch? Dad bought some pig ears.â\nããâOkay.â\nããThe man carried the things back home, and the three children continued to help their mother run the stall. The sun was blazing at noon, but Li Xiaâs stall was set up under a few big trees, and it was quite comfortable to sit on a bamboo chair in the shade and fan herself with a cattail leaf fan.\nããâHow much is this short-sleeved top?â\nããLi Xia got up quickly because she saw that the couple had bought 30 pieces of clothing wholesale, which was lower than the retail price, but the speed is fast, and she can make a net profit of more than one hundred yuan in one go.\nããâNine yuan and eighty cents.â She saw the other person frowning and then she explained fluently, âThis is imported fabric. We donât have it in China. You can ask around the provincial capital. You canât buy it anywhere else except here.â\nããâImported?â The woman reached out and touched the smooth material, and felt that it was more silky than Dacron. âItâs almost the same as Dacron, but the price is higher than Dacron. Can you make it cheaper? If I donât think it looks good, Iâll go to the tailor shop to make Dacron.â\nããâGirl, I really canât make it any cheaper. Imported fabrics are more expensive than domestic ones, and the workmanship and patterns of large factories are incomparable to those of small tailor shops. If you donât believe me, try it on and see if it looks good.â\nããThe woman was wearing a short-sleeved top, and she put it on. Just like that, the shape of the top was immediately different. The pattern fit the body curve very well, and it was much better looking than the one she was wearing.\nããâItâs still too expensive. Can you give me a discount?â\nããâGirl, do you think itâs easy for me to trade in the south and the north? If I sell it any cheaper, I wonât make any profit. In this hot weather, you say Iâm not making any money. Why am I here? I just want to earn enough money to eat. Okay wait, Let me give you a discount of 20 cents. Wear my imported clothes to work, and it will definitely attract peopleâs attention.â\nããFor Young people, this rate of turning heads is still very attractive. People of this period are not as hard-working as those in the 1990s to bargain, so she thought about asking her to give it a lower price.\nããâEight yuan and eight cents, and itâs auspicious. If you think itâs okay, Iâll take it. After all, itâs not easy for you to take care of the child in such a hot weather.â\nããâOkay, take it for 9.50 yuan . This is imported. I only bought a few of them. If you want it, someone else will buy it.â\nããThe Dacron shirts in the department store cost about 8 yuan. Hers is more expensive but the style is good and it looks good. As for whether the fabric is imported or not, since it looks good, Iâll just say itâs good.\nããThe woman was accompanied by a girl who was about in junior high school, probably her sister. Reaching out the money, she looked at Shen Hui and the other two with pity in her eyes. After turning around and walking a few steps, the girl next to her pointed at the foam box beside her and spoke.\nããâSister, itâs so hot, want to buy a popsicle?â\nããâBuy whatever clothes you want. Clothes can make you look good, but popsicles are wasted and nothing is left in your stomach. I told you to study hard but you didnât listen. Iâm telling you, if you donât study hard, you can only work in a factory or set up a street stall like them.â\nããThe woman paid the money and took the clothes away. They just happened to hear the words. The three childrenâs worldview was immediately washed away. They looked down and wondered if they were really so pitiful.\nããThe two older ones were thinking to themselves, and Yi Yi asked his mother without hesitation, âIs it shameful and pitiful to set up a street stall?â\nããAs soon as he said this, the other two older ones also looked at their mother. For a few days, Li Xia did not allow Shen Haiyang to come forward, and when she talked to customers, she always said that it was not easy for her. Now that the woman said it so bluntly, the three children immediately thought it was embarrassing.\nããDuring this period, people did look down on small vendors and self-employed individuals, but Li Xia felt that it was not shameful to make money with her own hands, whether in her past life or in this life. In her past life, she had no capital, no knowledge, and was isolated from the news in a small place, so she did not seize the opportunity. In this life, as one of the first batch of small businesses, she never felt that there was anything wrong.\nããShe thought for a moment and took out two dimes from her pocket and gave it to Yi Yi: âGo buy some popsicles. Itâs too hot.â\nããThe mother didnât answer his question directly, but gave him money to buy popsicles. The child immediately forgot the previous question and happily ran to buy four popsicles. On a hot day, the mother and the four children each had one to cool off.\nããSeeing the little ones enjoying their popsicle s, she took the opportunity to say, âThat woman has to bargain for a long time to buy clothes, and she canât even afford to buy a popsicle. She has to sacrifice her mouth for the sake of her clothes. But we can eat whatever we want and we are not restricted in what we wear. Do you think she is pitiful or we are pitiful?â\nããâshe is.â\nããThe three of them said in unison. The children knew how the food was at home, and they felt very superior when they talked about it with their friends.\nããThe clothes they wear are all new, and their mother even makes parent-child outfits for them. They donât have to save money to buy new clothes like other families do. Because they may only buy one every few months, the fabrics will definitely have color differences, and it is impossible for several people in the family to buy the same one.\nããIn this era of scarcity, when buying new clothes is considered a show-off, The three of them could eat whatever they wanted, and that was the only reason the woman was wrong.\nããâI want to set up a street stall when I grow up.â\nããShen Huiâs words shocked Li Xia, who quickly explained, âWhen you grow up, street vendors will have become a thing of the past. People will start to open companies by then.â\nããâ Start a company?â\nããâYes. The threshold for street stall economy is very low and it will soon become a thing of the past. You canât just look at the present, you have to look at the long term.â\nããâOh. But mom, how can we see the long term?â\nããâRead. Read thousands of books and travel thousands of miles. Only when you have insight and knowledge can you see far.â\nããâoh.â\nããLi Xia secretly patted her chest, finally getting her way. Yi Yi was also looking at her just now, and the little guy was also full of curiosity about making money. If she led two children who were so good at studying to the âevil pathâ of setting up stalls, she would be committing a great sin.\nããâMom, will I earn more money if I study?â Yi Yi asked.\nããâIâll leave the money-making to mom. Can you just study hard first?â\nããâI want to help my mother make money.â\nããâMomâs business will grow bigger in the future. If you donât study and donât know how to run it, how can you help me?â\nããâOkay, Iâll study first, and then help mom when I grow up.â\nããâOkay, if you want to help mom, you have to study hard first. Mom can do ordinary things, but if I encounter something I donât know how to do, Iâll rely on you to study hard and help me later.â\nããâUm.â\nããThe two boys nodded heavily. Shen Hui had done the first-grade test and got 99 points. This child is confident in learning. Yiyi is still young, and usually he follows his brother in doing whatever he does.\nããThey had lunch outside, and when she asked the children to go home and sleep, they all shook their heads. The children were energetic, but she didnât force them. She brought mats and cushions from home and let them play under the shade of the trees while watching the stall. She lay on the bamboo chair and closed her eyes to take a nap.\n\n\nT/N :- HELLO GUYS , PLEASE DO COMMENT IF YOU LIKE THE NOVEL OR NOT OR ANY OF YOUR THOUGHTS, AS IT ENCOURAGES ME TO WORK HARD.\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTION FOR NOVEL TO TRANSLATE DO LET ME KNOW!!!!\nTHANK YOU <3\n",
    "36": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c25-2/\nIn the late afternoon, a woman came to buy a suit for early autumn, but they couldnât agree on the price. This suit is made of the latest fabric polyester, which is more expensive than pure cotton at this time. Li Xia was not willing to sell it if she didnât make a lot of money.\nããâReally not. If you really like it, this is the price. Otherwise, you can go somewhere else and compare it.â\nããâI like your style. If you insist on not selling it, Iâll buy some cloth and have it made by a tailor.â\nããâSister, the ones made by the tailor shop look similar at first glance, but the actual pattern is not as good as that made by the big factory. Forget it, if you want to make it, just do it. I wonât stop you.â\nããAs she spoke, she lowered her head to close the stall. Her three children were also helping her, not noticing the woman gesturing to the alley next to her. After some discussion, the clothes were not sold, and Li Xia closed the stall and rode home.\nããThe two women behind her met under the shade of the tree where they had set up their stalls before. The woman whispered to Murong Danling, âNo one will sell it at your price. I think youâre asking a little too low. That skirt is so pretty, the stitching and workmanship are great, and the fabric is the most fashionable polyester. If you really like it, save some money and buy it this month.â\nããMurong Danling snorted coldly: âI have money, but I donât want to give it to her.â\nããâNo, letâs be honest. There is no guarantee for setting up a street stall. Itâs hard work under the sun and wind every day. Look how pitiful your son is. Donât be so picky.â\nããâHeâs happy with it, itâs none of my business. Well, come back tomorrow and try to bargain a few more times so that no one else can buy it. It would be a shame if they run out of my suitable size.â\nããâCome on, Iâm not coming. I canât afford to lose face.â\nããThat is, if you want to buy, buy it. If this happened in a department store, the salesperson at the counter would have cursed. Only the vendors on the street were very nice to attract customers. She talked to them for so long, and she would be too embarrassed to argue with them tomorrow.\nããâOh, please help me. Itâs not easy for me to buy from her. If you donât help me, I wonât be able to buy.â\nããâI can help you buy it, but the price canât be that low.â\nããMurong Danling nodded silently. She really liked that dress. She had seen it from afar but didnât want to deal with Li Xia, so she asked her colleagues for help. She deliberately lowered the price to test the water, because she was afraid that her money would be taken away by Li Xia.\nããThe next day, Li Xia had just completed a wholesale business of 20 pieces when the woman came over again.\nããThis time, she didnât bargain again and again, and just discussed buying the dress and also bought a Dacron skirt.\nããAfter buying the skirts they liked, the two women tried them on at Murong Danlingâs place. Because Li Xia said that if they didnât fit the skirts they took back, they could bring them back and exchange them within one day.\nããâHey, this skirt is so pretty. I didnât find the pattern I liked in the department store before, but I didnât expect she has so many of them here.â\nããMurong Danling was also very satisfied with the outfit she was wearing. She had already bought two summer skirts, and this time she fell in love with this early autumn suit at first sight.\nããShe was extremely helpless towards Shen Hui. She wanted to trick the brat into going with her, but now he ran away as fast as he could as if he saw the plague god. She wanted to give up Shen Haiyang and his son, but she was unwilling to do so. How could Li Xia have so many good clothes? They should have been hers.\nããâHow much do you think she can earn from these two sets of clothes? You said that itâs not easy for people like her to set up a stall. Itâs impossible for them to sell her at a loss, right?â\nããâShe can make a fortune from any piece of work she makes.â\nããâIsnât it possible?â Everyone can see that Li Xiaâs business is very successful. She does sell a lot of goods every day. But the woman is obviously more rational and started to analyze it with her.\nããâMy sister-in-law sells clothes in a department store. You donât calculate this kind of thing the way you do. Capital, inventory, and backlogs are all huge risks. In a state-owned department store, these are all borne by the state, but if she runs it on her own, she has to bear the costs herself. For example, if she earns one yuan per piece as you said, but the remaining 50 pieces are unsold or have defects, then she will have to pay for them. By then, she may not earn a penny, and she will just have a lot of unsold goods.â\nãâRight.â\nããâYou, donât just look at how much you earn, you have to calculate the risks behind it. Li Xia is so bold because she relies on her husbandâs savings and her familyâs bun shop can probably make some money. When she knows the risks of the clothing business, she may not do it anymore.â\nããâShen Haiyang is just an idiot. It will be too late for him to regret when Li Xia spends all his money. He wonât even be able to find his grave to cry at by then.â\nããâWhat can we do? They are happy for you to worry about it, but there is nothing we can do.â\nããâIdiot, bastard, when he starts crying I will definitely go over and take a good look. Then I will see how the father and son will have the nerve to see me.â\nããMurong Danling counted the money as her own, and felt sorry for Li Xiaâs risk. She thought about how to make fun of her every day, and even thought of several versions of how to win over the father and son.\nããThe next day when she met Shen Haiyang at work, she rolled her eyes with disdain. âShen Haiyang, there will be a time for you to cry.â\nããShen Haiyang got angry when he was called out by name, âI think you are the one crying.â\nããâYou, Shen Haiyang, why are you like this now? You are really with a rural womanâ¦â\nããâShut up and donât make me scold you.â\nããMurong Danling gritted her teeth at his words and swallowed back what she wanted to say. She rode away quickly, and Shen Haiyang was extremely disgusted with her behavior. Is money really that important, so important that it ignores family affection? If there is affection, it will be consumed by you, and if there is no affection, you still cling to it and wonât let go.\nããâI hope youâre not as bad as I thought. Heâs your son. Just leave when you figure it out and stop bothering me.â\nããShen Haiyang didnât want to see her, and hoped she would leave soon. She, on the other hand, waited day by day to see the show. She waited and waited, and waited until the end of summer vacation. There were fewer and fewer clothes on Li Xiaâs stall, and only the woman she hired was left to watch. Li Xia disappeared, and the Shen family father and son did not regret it.\nããWhen she went to work in the morning, she saw Shen Haiyang taking the two older children to register for elementary school. The younger one was mumbling that he would officially go to kindergarten the day after tomorrow.\nããâMy mother went to the south again. She promised to buy me a little one when she comes back.â\nããShen Hui also had an expectant expression: âMy mother said she would buy me a plane. I wonder if there is anyone selling planes in the south.â\nããHuihua also said, âMom said she would go out more this time and buy me some good paint.â\nããWell, the three kids were all promised by Li Xia, didnât Li Xia make less money this time? Murong Danling stood there in a daze. Shen Hui followed his father to register and didnât see her at all. People were coming and going at the school gate, but she felt lonely and began to feel cold.\nããMoney, with money she can buy what she wants and she can live a good life. But now it is Li Xia who lives in a big house. The clothes she bought with the money she saved from her mouth were bought from Li Xia. She just passed by Li Xiaâs stall and heard the loudspeaker shouting about a clearance sale. There was a crowd of people in front of the stall. Does this mean that the risk problem that her colleague mentioned does not exist at all?\nããHow ambitious she was before, is how disappointed she was now. She had no chance to say what she wanted to say. She left quickly, fearing that the man would see her.\nããWhen she got off work in the evening, she saw Shen Haiyang riding a tricycle and stopped at the house gate. The couple was surrounded by many neighbors. When she got closer, she heard that it turned out that Li Xia bought a double-tub washing machine. This new thing is not cheaper than a TV. It is definitely a luxury in this era.\nããâLi Xia, you are so capable that you are willing to buy this thing. Itâs just washing clothes, a big basin and washboard will do.â\nããâYou think they are you? They are busy making money all day. How can you compare with them?â\nããEveryone was busy looking at the washing machine that Li Xia bought from the south, and Murong Danling stood there with a look of shock on her face. Someone saw her, and everyone turned their eyes to look at her.\nããThose eyes were like the biting cold wind in winter, making her shiver all over. An old lady pointed at her and said something inaudible. She felt that if she stayed any longer, she would be tortured by those eyes.\nããShe turned around and rode back to her parentsâ home, fearing that she would be late and the neighbors in the yard would shake their heads in regret at her. She was unlucky, and she got angry every time she heard this, and felt that she could not bear it any more.\n",
    "37": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c26/\nCHAPTER 26\nããShe bought the washing machine and tried it out by filling it with water in the yard that night. She added water and detergent on the left side, turned the switch, and the motor started to rotate, driving the water inside to form a vortex. After the detergent dissolved, she threw the clothes to be washed into it, and it rotated back and forth.\nããShen Haiyang opened the right side and asked, âIs this the spin dryer? It has two cylinders. I heard there are very few of them on the market.â\nããLi Xia nodded. âThis is the only twin-cylinder engine they had. I almost had a fight with someone to get it. Later, the boss of the clothing factory helped me buy it.â\nããâReally?â\nããâReally. I heard that a spin dryer can spin clothes without dripping any water, which is exactly what we need in the north in winter. Otherwise, clothes will take several days to dry after washing, and it is even more troublesome to wash bed sheets in winter. If you have this, people say that it can be dried in one day after washing in winter. There are more single-bar ones on the market, and double-bar ones are very rare.â\nããâIs it So good?â\nããâWeâll know after we try it later.â She smiled and called the children, âGo get a big basin, add water and rinse it out, and then try to see if the bucket works well.â\nããâOkay.â The children hurriedly took out the large basin and washboard for washing clothes. Shen Hui connected the water pipe and filled it with water. âMom, this washing machine is not cheap, right?â\nããâYeah. Itâs okay. Weâll make more and more money in the future, so buying this wonât be a big deal.â\nããAfter 15 minutes, the first wave of clothes was washed. She wrung them out by hand and put them in a large basin for washing. Then she put them into the spin dryer one by one, covered them with the water pressure cover, closed the lid and turned on the switch. They heard the sound of the machine starting to work. After three minutes, She waited for it to stop and opened it to take a look.\nããâOh my god, itâs almost done.â\nããShen Haiyang came out of the kitchen after hearing this and reached out to touch it with a similarly shocked expression. The children also touched it happily and said that they would no longer be afraid of their clothes freezing and not being able to dry in winter.\nããâOh, all of this is used.â\nããThe neighbor came in to see how the washing machine actually washes clothes, after all, this is the first one in the neighborhood to buy this thing. Washing clothes is not a big deal, after all, they think washing by hand is just a little more troublesome, but when they saw the spin dryer, they were immediately envious.\nããâWow, this thing is so good. Hey, Li Xia, can you help me shake out my thick clothes after I wash them in winter?â\nããâSure, no problem.â\nããWhen the woman went out to advertise, many curious people came to see. They were envious of the number of clean clothes hung in Li Xiaâs yard in such a short time, and each piece was completely dry.\nããâWhen we have this thing sold here, I will save up and buy one.â A young wife who loves cleanliness very much yearns for this thing.\nããâThen you should tighten your belt from now on and save up enough money first. Otherwise, when the goods become available, you wonât have enough money and will be anxious and unable to buy them.â Her neighbor reminded her of the price, saying that this thing is not something that can be bought casually.\nããâIâve decided that from tomorrow on, every meal will be salted vegetable porridge.â\nããEveryone laughed, and this person was really fighting for the washing machine. The weather is getting colder day by day, and winter will come in two months. The biggest headache for women is the problem of laundry not drying. In the next few years, single-cylinder and double-cylinder washing machines will be peopleâs favorites. Until the full-automatic ones came out, the status of these two gradually declined.\nããDuring the night break, Shen Haiyang helped her massage her shoulders and said, âYouâve worked hard. You carried all these goods back and forth by yourself. Why donât you find a helper next time? Itâs too tiring for you to do it alone.â\nããâWell, I also plan to find help. In the next two or three years, trading goods back and forth like this will be a sure-fire business, so I have to take advantage of the opportunity to make more money.â\nããâThe city construction company is planning to build a market on Huanghua Road. I heard itâs invested by a foreign boss. Pre-sales will start the day after tomorrow. Youâ¦â\nããâReally?â Li Xia turned around and interrupted him eagerly before he could finish. âWhat about the price? Do you know the price?â\nããWhen it comes to doing business, she is just as excited as a chicken blood. Shen Haiyang smiled and handed her the milk powder. âI asked for you, about 400 per square meter. The average room is about 20 to 30 square meters. This is the actual area, and the corridor outside is not counted. The price fluctuates slightly depending on the location.â\nããâI want to buy two shops near the stairs.â\nããâThe place with the largest flow of people has the highest price. The price is definitely the highest.â\nããLi Xia suddenly fell silent. Most of her funds were invested in this batch of goods. There were tens of thousands of goods, most of which were winter clothes. She was planning to make a fortune during the Chinese New Year. She had to buy a store to open a wholesale market in the provincial capital, but the moneyâ¦\nããâCan it be rented?â Most people in this period didnât have much money, so this kind of start-up should be in the form of selling or renting, right?\nããâI heard itâs possible.â Shen Haiyang said and took out the passbook from the drawer. âTake it out and use it. You can choose the location.â\nããThe price of newly developed residential buildings in Shenzhen is about 1,000 yuan per square meter. At that time, the average wage in mainland China was only 30 or 40 yuan, so most of the buyers were Hong Kong people. The commercial buildings developed here are only about 400 yuan, and each one is not big. But even so, few people can afford it.\nããShould I buy or rent?\nããLi Xia quickly calculated in her mind. She had been to the provincial capital in her previous life in the 1990s. At that time, she heard that the rent for such a shop was more than 100,000 yuan a year, and the one with a good location was even more expensive. These tens of thousands of dollars would be worth hundreds of thousands a decade later. However, if she bought the shop, the annual rent in the 1990s alone would exceed its value. So it would be more appropriate to buy it.\nããReaching out to take his passbook, she thought about it and considered doing something big. âIf you trust me, we will invest all this money in buying a shop. I will never cheat you.â After saying that, seeing that he didnât say anything, she suddenly remembered something and quickly changed her words.\nããâNo, no, we canât do that. This money is in US dollars, and we have to keep it for your medical treatment. Once foreign countries have developed a cure for your disease, we will quickly apply to go abroad for treatment.â\nããShen Haiyang was still gentle, and he smiled and touched her hair. âLetâs invest in a shop. If we really need to go abroad for medical treatment in the future, we can exchange it for US dollars, and we donât have to guard it and be afraid to move.â\nããâThatâs right. Find a way to increase its value. The more money the better. As long as you have money in your hands, you wonât have to worry about not being able to exchange it for US dollars.â\nããThe couple reached an agreement and exchanged all the US dollars for foreign exchange certificates. When the shop opened, they bought two large shops and one small shop.\nããThey heard that the investor this time was an overseas Chinese, and the whole wholesale city was planned to be built on four floors. The first floor would be for home appliances and skin care products, and the second floor and above would be for clothing, fabrics, bedding, etc. She bought a room on the first floor, and one on the second and third floors.\nããThey thought there would be very few buyers, but it turns out that it is not as rare as they thought. Keeping a low profile is a principle that Chinese people have long understood. They lay dormant for a few years, but now that it is open, these people have come out of hibernation.\nããHalf of the shops were pre-sold, and the developer kept the remaining half for its own use. Li Xia and her husband bought three shops, and her name was written on all the contracts. Holding the newly-issued real estate contract, her hands were shaking. She looked up at Shen Haiyang, and this man really put all his property under her name.\nããAlthough she now has tens of thousands of goods, it is expected that the cash will reach hundreds of thousands. But that is not yet cashed in. At this time, holding these real estate contracts, she is looking at the value in ten years. The rent is hundreds of thousands, how much should the annual turnover be.\nããâI really canât imagine it how much I will earn.â\nããShen Haiyang turned back curiously: âWhat did you say?â\nããShe smiled foolishly. âNo, nothing.â\nããâBy the way, why are the things you promised to buy for the kids missing? Did you forget? The three of them were always talking about it before, but we were distracted by the washing machine and other things these days and may have forgotten about it. But if you didnât buy it, I think they would be disappointed.â\nããâI bought it. I bought it. Didnât you say that I have to keep my promise to my children? I remember it. The things are among my goods. Iâll find them for them when I get home.â\nããIn order to make money from the investment, the wholesale shopping mall is expected to be completed and delivered by the end of next year. In the next year or so, Li Xia feels that she needs to accumulate connections and clients, and also thoroughly understand the source manufacturers.\nããOn the way, she finally spoke. âHaiyang, why did you write my name on the shop?â\nããâIf anything happens to me, this will save you a lot of trouble.â\nããâIâ¦â¦â\nããâNo need to tell me, I know everything.â\nããMurong Danling is still trying to get through Shen Hui for money. If something happens to me, I must not let her use Shen Hui to cause you trouble again. I believe in you and am willing to put my life and property on your shoulders.\nããShen Haiyang had already deduced all the possible events. In the drawer were the letters and wills left for them. Since he knew that he was ill, he had to make all the necessary preparations. If something unfortunate happened, he couldnât leave her with a mess and let her be attacked from all sides.\n",

In the evening, the woman she hired to close the stall came in with a bag. âSister, there is no clothing left. The last few pieces were defective, so I sold them at the low price you asked. Several people came to ask about wholesale, and wanted to see what goods you have next.â\nããâWhere are the people?â\nããâOutside, I said I would come in and check out the situation first.â\nããâTell them to wait for a few minutes. Come in and help me get samples of all kinds of clothing so that it will be easier for them to choose.â\nããâOK.â\nããAutumn clothes can actually be worn in early winter, so she also bought a batch of cheap cotton-padded clothes. Large factories use machine cutting and large-scale processing to reduce costs. It is cheaper than buying cloth and cotton to make them by herself, and the styles are also beautiful. She thinks there is definitely a market for them.\nããShe opened each package and took out the samples one by one and hung them up. After checking that everything was complete, she covered the large packages with sheets and invited those who wanted to purchase wholesale to come in and choose.\nããâOh, this coat is really nice. It will go well with these blue or black and gray Decca pants. Boss Li, how much is it?â\nããâThis cotton coat is also nice, but I donât know the price.â\nããLi Xia took the purchase order and quoted prices to everyone one by one. For a moment, the room was as noisy as a vegetable market. They looked at the goods, bargained, placed orders, paid for the goods, and sent the goods away. The four of her family members had already heated up the vegetables twice.\nããShe felt a little sorry when she saw Shen Haiyang wearing an apron. The traditional idea was that women should take on housework, at least half of it. But now she was so busy that Shen Haiyang did most of the housework every day. When she went away, she left the house to him.\nããâsorry,â\nããâItâs okay, letâs eat quickly.â\nããAfter eating, she went to wash the dishes and cleaned up the backlog in the kitchen. Shen Haiyang didnât know how to cook before, and now he can only cook enough to eat. She was busy and wondered if she should consider finding someone to help, otherwise it would affect his health if he didnât eat well.\nããâMom, do you need me to do anything?â Huah5ua came in and asked.\nããâNo, it will be ready soon.â\nããâMom, my painting won the second prize.â\nããâReally?â Li Xia was very surprised, her eyes shining as she looked at her daughter.\nããâReally. The teacher said there might be some competitions at the end of the year, so I should prepare well during this period.â\nããâOh, what do you need mom to do?â\nããThe little girl smiled happily, âNo need for anything. You bought everything I needed, and the teacher also teaches me some skills every week. I will study hard.â\nããâOkay,â she reached out and touched the childâs braids. âWhen mommy was not home, who braids your hair for you?â\nããâThe auntie from the steamed bun shop.â The little girl laughed and leaned closer to her and said, âMy dad wanted to tie my hair, but he didnât know how. After he finished, he wasnât satisfied. My brother said it looked like a birdâs nest and Yi Yi said it looked like an old hen. Humph, these two guys, Iâll remember them.â\nããLi Xia was also amused by the imagined scene. She stroked her daughterâs hair and said she would heat up water to wash her hair. âMom will teach you how to comb your hair. You are a big kid now. You may not be able to do it well at first, but mom will help you. You will get it right after a few times. It is not a difficult task.â\nããâOkay. I was originally going to tell you that you should teach me.â\nããShe boiled water to wash her daughterâs hair and feet, and called her two sons to wash them. The boys all had short hair and washed quickly. During the washing process, she found that Yi Yiâs neck was so dirty, so she simply boiled more water for the two of them to bathe.\nããâItâs really troublesome. It would be great if there was a water heater.â\nããâWhat did you say, Mom?â\nããâNothing. You two go watch TV for a while. Iâll call you when the water is ready.â\nããWhen Li Xia came to the family, Shen Hui was seven years old. During this period, because there was no Internet, the children seemed to be slow to develop.\nããBefore the age of 18, he had no concept of gender. Since last year, Li Xia had been bathing him. But today, the little guy started to be awkward and came in and said he wanted to bathe himself.\nããLi Xia also understood the little boyâs thoughts, and looked at him silently and asked him what to do. Shen Hui turned his head to look at his brother and patted his chest proudly.\nããâLeave it to me. I washed his clothes while you were busy sellin.â\nããâOkay, then you two should wash well and clean yourself.â\nããâI know, mom.â\nããAfter arranging for the two boys to take a bath, she went out to clean up and returned to the main room. Shen Haiyang sat at the table reading a book, with only the lamp in front of him on. The dim yellow light made his facial features even softer, and his head bowed at the desk, full of bookish air, reminded her of the ancient officials who worked by candlelight in TV dramas.\nããSilently, she took a spoon and made him a cup of milk, and gently placed it on a corner of his desk. She didnât want to disturb him, but as soon as she moved, he raised his head towards her.\nããBecause of work, he suddenly raised his eyes with a sharp look. The moment he saw her, his eyebrows curved and he smiled, first the corners of his mouth turned up, then his eyes became gentle, and a warm smile bloomed on his face. Then he stretched, picked up the cup and took a sip. The sweet milk flavor spread in his mouth, making him feel even better.\nããâItâs nice to have you home.â\nããIt was just a simple sentence, but Li Xia was a little excited by the impact. In her previous life, she took good care of Fang Zhongcheng, but he never felt that what she did was meaningful.\nããAfter the divorce, she had to be both a father and a mother to raise two children. Because she was irritable and bad-tempered, the children never said to her in a gentle way to appreciate her efforts. She had been telling herself to be good and not to be stubborn since she was reborn, and now it seems to be working. The two biological children have said more than once that they like and love their mother, and Shen Hui, the stepson, also said that she is very good.\nããIn this life, she was busy making money, wishing she could earn enough for her life at once. She knew that the next few decades would be the fastest-changing decades, and the fastest depreciating things were cash and education, so even though she had already become a rare millionaire in the 1980s, she was still busy making money.\nããThe man thought she was worried because she had three children and he was sick, so he supported her all the time. In fact, she was full of confidence after she started making money. Her face was full of vitality and her eyes were shining with hope. She couldnât stop on the road of making money.\nããNow, not to mention the cash flow and goods under her name, the real estate alone will be worth hundreds of millions in a few decades. As for the family affairs, the foundation has been laid for decades, so she doesnât have to worry about it at all.\nããâIs the trip to the South going smoothly?â\nããâIt was OK. I wore old clothes on the road and put the bag of money on my belly to pretend to be pregnant. I didnât attract anyoneâs interest along the way. You know, a person who was also going to the south encountered a thief on the road. She cried and said that all the more than 5,000 yuan she had with her was stolen. I was so scared when I heard it that I didnât dare to sleep all night.â\nããâAre there many thieves on the road?â\nããâI donât know. Four or five people in the same compartment said they lost money, and the train police came but couldnât find any trace of the thief.â\nããâItâs still quite dangerous. Why donât you let Xiao Liu go with you next time, so that you two can have someone to look after you on the way.â\nããXiao Liu was the one she hired to help her sell goods. She nodded when she heard that. âThatâs what I was planning. Even if you are alert when you sleep, itâs not as safe as two people taking turns.â\nããâThe business is getting bigger and bigger, so we should hire a few more people.â\nããLi Xia nodded obediently, her bangs swaying back and forth as she did so. The man looked at her and laughed, his warm eyes making even this old lady blush.\nããA short absence is better than a new marriage. She had been away for nearly ten days, and when she came back, she was so tired that she lay down and fell asleep. After a few days of rest, she couldnât help but think of other things. At night, he sent the children to bed, and she sent away the neighbors who were watching TV and closed the house door.\nããShe tiptoed back to the living room like a kitten, and the man was already in bed. The lamp on the bedside table was on, and he looked up when he heard the noise, blinked his eyes and waved at her.\nããâWhy do you feel a little shy?â\nããThe man put his arm around her, âWhat are you mumbling about again?â\nããShe boldly put her long arms on his shoulders, and pulled her loose hair back seductively. She blinked at him with her big eyes, and leaned forward to kiss him.\nããThe kiss was too deep, and he seemed to be still unsatisfied after it was over. Shen Haiyang was so moved by her initiative that he forgot to turn off the lights first. Because of his emotions, his cheeks were flushed, and he was teased by his wife again.\nããâI said you are very delicious, and your blushing face is very tempting.â\nããâLi Xia,â the man was teased and couldnât help laughing. âYou are just like a female hooligan.â\nããâToday I will show you what a real female hooligan is.â\nããItâs not like I havenât taken the initiative before. When you were not feeling well, wasnât it me who took the initiative? Because of his gentleness and indulgence, Li Xia became more courageous in this regard.\nããThings that she had not dared to think about in her previous life were unlocked one by one under his indulgence. Of course, this was also related to her current self-confidence. When people are confident, they are naturally bold and feel that they can do anything, including teasing him.\nããBeing pushed by his wife, the manâs words were somewhat helpless, but in fact he cooperated with her obediently and enjoyed it very much. When Li Xia told him that she was reborn, she thought about what to do if he disliked her mental age. Now it seems that he may not have thought of this at all. After all, she appeared in front of him in her prime.\nããDid Shen Haiyang think about this? He really didnât think about it at all, or he thought it was unimportant. What he considered most every day was the future of this family.\nããThe next day, the couple got up late and brought some buns and porridge from the bun shop. Li Xia also cooked a packet of instant noodles for Shen Haiyang.\nããThe fried eggs, tomatoes, and spinach, in red, white, and green, looked very pretty. The three little ones were so greedy that they kept sniffing.\nããâEat it quickly. I know you donât like buns that much. I still have one pack left from the ones I bought on the way. These things taste attractive but they donât have much nutrition. You need to add eggs or something to make them more delicious.â\nããShen Haiyang looked at the three children opposite him. Li Xia handed him the chopsticks, then turned to the three children and said, âIf you want to eat, wait until next time. If the supply and marketing cooperative has it, Iâll buy two bags for each of you. Letâs eat buns first. Iâll give you meat buns.â\nããâOkay.â\nããAfter hearing this, the three little ones bought it. They nodded and ate porridge and buns. In this period, instant noodles were a luxury item that could only be found in cities. In the countryside, they had to wait until the late 1980s to get them. It was very prestigious to cook a pack for relatives when they came.\nããShen Haiyang took a bite and found the braised beef tasted really good. âIs this expensive?â\nããâNot cheap.â Li Xia smiled: âBut itâs within our spending power. Hey, actually, you can make money by opening an instant noodle factory.â\nããThe four of them looked at her together. This woman is really obsessed with money. She wants to make money from everything she sees. You are already very enviable now, okay?\nããAfter eating and going to work, Shen Haiyang walked a long way before he remembered that he forgot to tell her that he would go to court to deprive Murong Danling of her visitation rights. Murong Danling should receive a court order soon, so she should pay more attention to Shen Hui in the next few days, fearing that this woman would do something radical if she got angry.\nããâLetâs talk about it later. Iâll pick up the child in the evening.â\n",
    "39": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c27/\nCHAPTER 27\nããAfter dinner, the children went to school and the husband went to work. Li Xia and Xiao Liu set up a stall together. They did both retail and wholesale. As long as they could make money, she didnât care what form it took.\nããTime ticked to eleven oâclock. It was time to prepare lunch, but the flow of people on the street did not decrease at all. People going to and from work, people going out to buy things. The flow of people remained the same, and her plan to go home to cook was ruined again.\nããâXiao Liu, what time is it?â\nããAfter seeing off a customer, she asked, and Xiao Liu said 12:10. She looked in the direction of the elementary school, wondering why the two children hadnât come back yet. Just as she was getting anxious, the two came running over.\nããâMom, I forgot to tell you this morning that weâre going to the cafeteria at Dadâs workplace for lunch. Iâll bring you a portion when I come back, so you can just focus on selling the goods.â\nããâOkay, Mom got it.â She took out two dimes from her pocket and gave them to them, âBuy some ice cream.â\nããâthanks Mom.â\nããThe two children took the money and ran away quickly. Li Xia finally understood what Shen Haiyang meant by âthere is a way to solve itâ. On weekdays, he would take the children to the canteen for meals, there was a washing machine for laundry, and the father and son could clean the house over the weekends. She actually had time when she got home in the evening, and she could also do less work, so that the things at home could be sorted out.\nããAbout half an hour later, Shen Haiyang rode his bike to bring her lunch. âSliced noodles with meatballs for you. I rode pretty fast, so there shouldnât be any lumps.â\nããWhen she opened the lunch box, I saw that the noodles were still smooth and crisp. âYou havenât eaten yet?â\nããâWell, Iâll bring it to you first. Iâll eat it when I get back.â\nããâYou canât go hungry.â Li Xia handed him her lunch box and said, âEat this first.â\nããShen Haiyang chuckled. âI eat yours and then come back to deliver yours? I have nothing to do all day just delivering meals.â\nããâThen leave quickly, leave quickly. You canât starve. Eat it yourself and send it to me later. Or let the two children bring me some after they finish eating.â\nããâIâm leaving now, eat quickly.â\nããWith the food problem solved, Li Xia set up her stall with peace of mind. During this period, she met several wholesalers from small cities, and her goods were sold smoothly. At night, she went home happily humming songs, boiling water on the fire, and cleaning the house.\nããWhen there were few people in the afternoon, she would go home to do laundry and housework. During that period, the food in the canteen was very affordable, so the whole family ate in the canteen every meal.\nããâI forgot. I promised to buy instant noodles for the kids.â\nããSuddenly remembering this, she rode her bike to the largest department store in the provincial capital. Coincidentally, this thing was actually available today, so she bought a box and took it home.\nããThe egg and tomato flavor is the only one they have right now. You can also make egg and tomato noodles at home, so this flavor is the slowest to sell.\nããAt night, each of them cooked a pack of noodles for midnight snack, and they were all very satisfied. The two adults silently calculated in their minds that it would be better to buy noodles. Eggs and tomatoes are the easiest and fastest stew. If you have noodles, stir-frying the stew is more economical than cooking noodles, and the taste is not bad.\nããâThis noodle is delicious.â\nããWell, Li Xia said this unconsciously, and was immediately refuted by the little guy. Yi Yi is a little foodie who likes to eat instant noodles very much. He was very greedy for this in his previous life.\nããThe little guy was so anxious that he was afraid that his mother would not buy him more in the future. Li Xia looked at her son and suddenly remembered that he had the habit of hiding instant noodle seasoning in his previous life. Once, he put the instant noodle seasoning that others did not want into his pocket on the road. As a result, the neighborâs children saw it and spread it everywhere, saying that he could not afford instant noodles so he picked up the seasoning that others did not want.\nããThe child was so embarrassed that he would fight with anyone who mentioned this matter. He had always been at the top of the class in school, and the jealous people would use this as an excuse to make fun of him for not being able to afford instant noodles.\nããA pack of instant noodles cost 25 cents and had to be supplemented with stamps, which was a luxury item in an era when grain and oil were not completely liberalized. But she was already at the forefront of the times in her life, so could she let her child be so greedy for instant noodles that she would collect seasonings? Of course not.\nããâBuy it. If you like it, mom will buy it for you. Itâs just instant noodles, not like a lot of people. Eat it if you like it.â\nããâOh yeah,â\nããThis time the three children cheered together. It seems that they really like this thing. She now runs a steamed bun shop. This kind of business was already collecting food coupons, and by accumulating them little by little in a month, she could collect a lot. The flour for the bun shop could be bought from farmers, but the price was a little higher. The money she could get was definitely enough to buy instant noodles for the children.\nããThey could eat as much as they wanted from this box. Before they finished, she bought them another box, this time with braised flavor. She also bought a few pounds of fine flour noodles, half a pound of pork, and a pound of chili peppers. At night, she went home and made chili meat sauce for them, so that when they were hungry, they could cook meat sauce noodles or eat meat sauce with steamed buns.\nããA wholesaler came in this morning and quickly made a deal of 30 pieces. Just as she happily put the money in her wallet, Han Jun rode his bike quickly and stopped in front of her.\nããLi Xia couldnât help but feel nervous when she saw him. Sure enough, the man started talking about the accident. âBrother Shen was chasing a suspect and suddenly got sick. He has been sent to the hospital. I came here specially to inform you.â\nããLi Xia zipped up her wallet, turned around and went to ride her bike. âXiao Liu, Iâll leave the stall to you.â\nããâDonât worry, Iâm watching.â\nããPutting down the business in her hands, she quickly followed Han Jun to the hospital, and when she saw the doctor, she quickly told him the situation. âHe has a heart problem, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, doctor, you must save him.â\nããâGot it. Donât panic. The patient took the medicine himself and was brought in on time. He is basically fine and will be out soon.â\nããOh, itâs all right now. It was just a false alarm, and Li Xia sat down on the bench in the corridor. She took a few deep breaths to calm herself down.\nããâWhen was this problem discovered? Didnât he say everything was normal at the hospital when he first woke up?â\nããâI went to Beijing during the summer vacation. He sometimes felt chest tightness and shortness of breath. The provincial capital couldnât find anything wrong, so I took him to a big hospital in Beijing for a check-up. The doctor said there is no effective treatment for this disease at present, and we can only wait and see. He said that research is being conducted abroad.â\nããAs they were talking, the door to the emergency room opened. They hurried forward and the doctor took off his mask to explain the situation.\nããâHe was brought in on time and had taken medication, so he survived. The patient has heart problems, so you as his family members must be very careful in the future. He cannot do strenuous exercise or be exposed to too much stimulation. He absolutely cannot run after someone like he did today. Itâs very dangerous.â\nããLi Xia nodded obediently. âGot it. Thank you, doctor.â\nããAfter a narrow escape, the doctor recommended that he be hospitalized for two days of observation. Li Xia went to complete the hospitalization procedures, and when she returned to the ward, Han Jun was talking to Shen Haiyang who had just woken up.\nããâBrother, you scared me to death, donât you know that you are in poor health? Are you willing to work hard to waste your life?â\nããShen Haiyang was helpless with himself and felt that he had caused trouble to the people around him. âIâm sorry. I forgot about it in a hurry. I didnât expect that this disease would flare up so suddenly when it was fine normally. I took medicine as soon as I felt uncomfortable in my heart, but I didnât expect that I would still end up in the hospital.â\nããAfter the man finished speaking, he looked up and saw his wife, and smiled apologetically at Li Xia. Li Xia said nothing, and made him his favorite rice noodles with shredded pork for lunch. After settling him down, she went home to look for the two children.\nããShen Hui and HuiHua didnât see their father after school, so they came to ask Aunt Liu. After learning that their father was hospitalized, they went to the hospital and met Li Xia on the way.\nããâMom, is Dad okay?â Shen Hui was more worried and scared. Having a dad or not having a dad is completely different for a child.\nããâItâs okay.â She held the two childrenâs hands and went to the ward to see Shen Haiyang first, then she took them to the hospital cafeteria for lunch. The little ones were very sensible. When their father was sick, they chose the cheapest clear soup noodles for lunch.\nããâThree bowls of noodles, with eggs.â\nããâMom, just some clear soup noodles. Save the money for Dadâs medical treatment.â\nããHuihua said so, and Shen Hui nodded. Dadâs illness is very serious, and I heard that he may need to go abroad to be cured. Going abroad will definitely cost a lot of money, so I have to be frugal in the future.\nããShen Haiyang suddenly fell ill, which made the children realize that their father was really ill. The one who was most worried was Shen Hui. The worry that his father had put at ease after waking up was lifted up again.\nããâAdults are responsible for these matters, so donât think too much, kid. You have to eat nutritious food, otherwise your father will be heartbroken when he sees you grow up to be a dwarf with a pale face and skinny body.â\nããThere were a few greens in the noodles, and the soup was clear and oily without a speck of oil.\nããLi Xia added eggs to supplement protein and amino acids.\nããThe children ate their meal and went to school by themself. Li Xia repeatedly reminded them not to talk to strangers on the way. âJust say you donât know anything they ask, take the main road and not the small road. Remember that, right?â\nããHuihua asked, âMom, what if someone really needs help?â\nããâLet him find someone else, an adult. You are children, safety comes first.â\nããâOkay, got it.â\nããHer home is close to the school, so she is not too worried. However, the hospital is quite far from the school, so she wishes she could go there in person. However, she also has to keep an eye on Shen Haiyang.\nããâHow about mommy send you off?â\nããâNo need.â Shen Hui answered firmly. âMom, you take care of Dad in the hospital, and we will go to school by ourselves. Donât worry, we will be obedient and will definitely not talk to strangers.â After a pause, the child continued, âI wonât go with the Murong family, donât worry. If they want to use force, I will shout, they wonât dare to do that on the main road.â\nããâOkay, be careful on the road.â\nããShe gave the child some change to take the bus. She returned to the ward to take care of the patient, and Shen Haiyang felt a little sorry for this, thinking that he had troubled her again. She wanted to make more money to develop her career, and now he was holding her back.\nããâWife, I will apply to retire to the second line after I am discharged from the hospital. This kind of thing will not happen again in the future.â\nããâThatâs great.â Li Xia took an orange and peeled it. âI know career is important for men, but life is the most important thing, right? Good health is the key to a future. If your illness doesnât cause any trouble, itâs fine. But if it does, it could be a big deal. If youâre gone, everything else is meaningless.â\nããâYeah, youâre right.â\nããLi Xia was thinking about how to persuade him, but before she could speak, he took the initiative to say that he would retreat to the second line in the future. She pursed her lips and was secretly happy, because she was really scared by his body.\nããâYou can go home tonight. I can stay in the hospital by myself.â\nããLi Xia looked back at the family next the ward, thinking of sending some fruit to the family and asking them to look after him. But she thought about it carefully in the afternoon and still felt uneasy. He had a heart attack, and it would only take a few minutes. If he suddenly got sick and didnât have time to shout, people would definitely not watch him and it would be too late to regret it.\nããWhat about the children?\nããThe first person she thought of was Fang Zhongcheng. In fact, she didnât want to find him, but the two children were in the middle, and they both lived in the provincial capital. It was impossible to completely cut off the relationship. The law stipulates that the father has visitation rights, and the children have the obligation to support him in the future.\nããIf she didnât find him when the child needed to be taken care of, he would start to say nice things again. She had to find him, shut his mouth, tear off the mask he was maintaining, and slap him in the face so that he couldnât say nice things again.\nããIn the afternoon, Shen Haiyang fell asleep, so she asked the older sister in the next bed to help look after him, and she went out to look for Fang Zhongcheng. She rode her bike to the manâs workplace very quickly, and Fang Zhongcheng was very surprised to see her.\nããâHow did you find yourself here?â\nããâShen Haiyang is sick and in the hospital. I have to stay with him at night. Please take care of the children for a few days. Pick up the three children in the evening. Shen Hui will also be troubling you.â\nããâNo, Shen Haiyang is sick. Whatâs wrong with him? Is it serious? Do you have to stay with him at night?â\nããLi Xia had expected his attitude, but she still got angry after hearing it. What do you care what happened to me? Even if I didnât have any problem, itâs not wrong for you, as a father, to take care of the child for a few days. Itâs nice to say nice things, but when something really happened, I immediately had diarrhea.\nããâYiyi and Huihua are your own flesh and blood. You wouldnât be unwilling to take care of them temporarily, would you? As for Shen Hui, if you are so stingy and unwilling to help, I will find another way.â\nããâNo, Iâm not unhappy.â\nããâ Then what is that?â\nããâMy place is small, and I really canât take care of three children.â\nããâThen take two?â\nããââ¦There is no room for us.â\nããâ You just want to give birth and donât want to raise them. Fang Zhongcheng, I sincerely suggest that you get sterilized, lest someone blind enough to be reborn as your child would be unlucky for the rest of your life.â\nããThe sarcasm and her disdainful look instantly made Fang Zhongchengâs face burn. He was furious and wanted to confront her but didnât dare to. He watched her turn around and ride away. This is his unit, whatâs the problem?\nãHe had to swallow your anger.\nããLi Xia scolded him and lost her temper, but she was not angry. She knew the result and came here just to ridicule him. Hypocrite, letâs see how you can be hypocritical to me in the future.\nããShe returned home and found her helper who worked at the steamed bun shop. âI have to stay with Shen Haiyang in the hospital. Can you bring your children to my house to rest at night and help take care of the three of my children at home?â\nããAfter explaining the situation, the other party nodded without hesitation. âSure, why not? Iâll pick up your kid in the evening and let the three of them have dinner at my house.â\nããâThanks.â\nããâWe are all neighbors, no need to be so polite.â\nããA distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor. This is a case where even the childâs biological father cannot compare to her neighbor. After arranging the three children, she rode her bike to the hospital. At night, Shen Haiyang moved aside so that she could share a bed with him.\nããShe subconsciously looked towards the door, then waved at him. âNo, the nurse will scold me if she sees me.â\nããâWhy?â\nããâYou are disturbing the patientâs rest. Are you here to accompany the patient or to enjoy yourself?â\nããShen Haiyang was amused by her lifelike imitation of the tone, âWhen were you scolded?â\nããâWhen my second brother was in the hospital, I once heard the nurse talking about the caregiver of the bed next to theirs.â\nããâItâs okay. My illness is not serious. Itâs okay to sleep together.â\nããThe couple was talking here, and the old lady next door cheerfully interrupted. âIt is absolutely not allowed to lie in bed during the day, but the nurses usually donât care at night.â\nããâYeah?â\nããâYes. Otherwise, the beds are so tight, and the bed attendants are also very tired. It is not okay to not rest at all.â\nããThat was fine. Li Xia waited for the nurse on duty to check the room and then went to bed. They were both not fat, so it was no problem for them to squeeze together on the one-meter-wide bed.\n",
    "40": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c27-2/\nIn the dead of night, Shen Haiyang put his arm around her.\nããAfter shouting and not saying anything, Li Xia reached out and patted him gently. That means if you have something to say, just say it, donât be polite with me. We are a couple, the closest people.\nããâIf something happens to meâ¦â\nããâDonât say that.â\nããLi Xia knew what he was going to say. It wasnât that she didnât want to agree to his request, but she simply didnât want to think about that possibility. She wasnât short of money now. Not to mention that she knew how to earn it, even if she did nothing, the three shops alone were enough for the four of them to live on. According to her consumption level, she could spend it all in several lifetimes.\nããBut after meeting her real needs, she found that she still couldnât bear to leave him. Life is not just about food, clothing, housing and transportation. After meeting her daily needs, she found that she had spiritual needs. With him by her side, her body and mind are warm. She felt that she was not living numbly, but that her blood was flowing, and she was a living person.\nããâWife, Live your life well. Shen Hui is so weird, Iâm afraid you canât handle him.â\nããIn fact, Shen Hui has now accepted them and truly regards them as his family.\nããâIâm suing to deprive Murong Danling of her visitation rights. The case will go to trial next week.â\nããHe was a burden to her. She not only took care of herself but also worried about him. If he really had an accident one day, he knew that she would take good care of Shen Hui and raise him to adulthood. So he had to clear the trouble as much as possible to make her life smoother.\nããNow he had an accident and cannot be savedâ¦\nããFor a moment, he felt so overwhelmed that he wanted to say something but couldnât. Live well, live hard. He couldnât close his eyes when he died, leaving the four of them behind. So everything else took a back seat compared to physical health. He had to live.\nããAfter two days of observation in the hospital, he was fine. Since he was in the same city, the attending doctor gave him a discharge certificate in the evening, so he didnât have to wait until the next day. The patient could leave at night and come back the next day to complete the formalities. So Li Xia didnât complete the formalities, but she had no vegetables or rice at home, so she went to buy vegetables and rice while passing by.\nããâBy the way, letâs see if thereâs any mutton. If there is, letâs buy some and have mutton hotpot.â\nããâOkay. Chives, sesame paste, and some coriander and green onions mixed together and dipped in lamb is very delicious.â\nããâThen Iâll go buy some mutton first and see if we can enjoy it today.â\nããThe couple goes around first to buy the grocery store and they had mutton. People at that time were starving, so pork was more popular than mutton. Everyone disliked mutton because it was too dry and oily, so they would only choose it when there was no pork and they really needed to entertain guests.\nããShe bought a pound of lamb hind legs, as well as tofu, bean curd sticks, and lamb blood, so she had four items in total. She can go home and soak some black fungus, add vermicelli, and cut some potatoes and sweet potatoes, and then a sumptuous hot pot meal can be ready.\nããLi Xia rode her bike home, thinking about boiling the sheep bones to make soup. At that time, there was no ready-made hot pot base, and water alone was a bit bland. Boiling the sheep bones and adding onions and ginger to the soup would give it a flavor.\nããThe two of them were delayed for some time, Shen Hui went to pick up Yi Yi, and the three children came back from school and opened the door to put their schoolbags home. Knowing that they were coming back today, they all came out to play and wait at the house gate.\nããShen Hui had a stomachache and needed to go to the bathroom. He raised his voice to his brother and sister, âYou two watch the door while I go to the bathroom. Mom and Dad may be back soon.â\nããâI know. Go ahead.â\nããHe went to the toilet, and the neighbor who had been taking care of them came out and shouted, âHuiHua, your mother hasnât come back yet?â\nããâNot yet.â\nããâOh, maybe sheâll be back soon. If sheâs not back soon, Iâll come over and cook for you.â\nÂ  ãShen Hui ran to the toilet, which was not too far from here. The woman muttered something and turned to go into her own yard. Li Xia was busy taking care of Shen Haiyang these days, and she was helping to take care of the family. She didnât think much about watching the child go to the toilet. Nowadays, people donât think about abandoning their children at all. Nothing can happen at the door of their own house. Besides, Shen Hui is so old, and in this era, adults donât worry if he takes his younger brothers and sisters to play and go far away.\nããMurong Danling and her second brother hid in a corner, watching the sky darken and it was time for dinner. There were few people on the street, so her second brother pushed her.\nããâGo quickly.â\nããShe shivered, her palms sweating with nervousness. âBrother, is this really not against the law?â\nããâYou are the biological mother, you have visitation rights. Whatâs wrong with taking your own child away to foster a relationship?â\nããâButâ¦â¦â\nããâBut thatâs bullshit. Shen Haiyang has 50,000 US dollars. Li Xia runs a steamed bun shop and has sold all her clothes. They must have a lot of money. Shen Haiyang sued to deprive you of visitation rights. If the lawsuit is successful, you wonât be able to take him away secretly. Itâs really illegal to lose visitation rights.â\nããSeeing that she was still hesitant, he continued to instigate: âWhat are you afraid of? We are not going to hurt your son. We are just setting a trap to trick them for money. Go quickly while he is in the bathroom, otherwise we will be unable to do it together. Seize the time, once you miss the opportunity, there will be no next time. The lawsuit will be heard soon, Shen Haiyang works in the procuratorate, and the chances of you losing this lawsuit is nine out of ten.â\nããShe was pushed out, and walked towards the public toilet with a cold and windy attitude. At this time, when the light was the darkest, Shen Hui came out and walked a few steps before he looked up and saw her.\nããâWhat are you doing, going to the bathroom?â She lived nearby and this was a normal place to come, so the child didnât think anything was wrong.\nããâHuihui, mommy sees you alone, and your daddy is sick and no one is taking care of him. Come on, mommy will take you to eat something delicious.â\nããâI wonât go.â\nããâHey, why are you being so polite to mom? Letâs go. Thereâs a cafeteria over there.â\nããMurong Danling was about to pull him, but Shen Hui stood up and dodged her hand. Murong Danling was determined to get him today, and then rushed towards him again. This time it was his arm. Shen Hui dodged to the side in a hurry, and was forced into a corner.\nããâWhat are you doing? I said Iâm not going, donât pull me.â\nããSeeing his voice getting louder, Murong Danling was afraid that he would attract nosy people, so she leaned towards him in a hurry. After all, she was an adult, and the child was much bigger than her. She pounced on him with her whole body, and the child was pressed against the wall.\nããâSomeone helpâ¦â\nããShen Hui remembered what his parents had said and started to shout. But as soon as he said two words, Murong Danling covered his mouth. He was small and weak, and he couldnât break free even if he used all his strength.\nããTwo passers-by walked by the roadside and looked over here curiously. Murong Danlingâs heart was pounding, and she yelled at the passers-by angrily.\nããâWhat are you looking at? Have you never seen a mother discipline her son?â\nããDuring this period, it was normal for children to be beaten by their parents. When she yelled like this, passers-by stopped paying attention. Her second brother, who had been watching from the corner of the street, saw that she couldnât control Shen Hui for a while, and turned out from the corner in a hurry. He took two steps and then retreated. He couldnât go out. If he showed up at this time, he wouldnât be able to do anything.\nããTheir plan was for Murong Danling to take the child away and hide him in a secret place. They canÂ  use this opportunity to cheat money from Shen Haiyang. Except for Murong Danling, the biological mother, no one else had any contact with Shen Hui. They also can ask Shen Haiyang to put the money in a designated place and not to contact anyone else.\nããAt that time, Shen Hui was taken away by his biological mother, on the pretext of fostering affection with the child, and the police would at most accuse her of being reckless in criticizing and educating him. Even if there was suspicion, without evidence, they could safely get the money without being held legally responsible.\nããThe two sides acted separately. If they were to be involved and Shen Hui saw him, he would be implicated because he didnât have the guts to kill the victim. Once Shen Hui showed up, everything would be exposed. So he absolutely couldnât let Shen Hui see him.\nããHe was hiding and not going out, while Murong Danling was anxious and couldnât take her son away. There were still people at this intersection even in the evening, so they had to make a quick decision.\nããShe covered Shen Huiâs mouth with one hand and hugged him with one arm, âHuihui, be good and donât be stubborn with mommy. Mommy will take you to eat delicious food, donât be stubborn anymore.â\nããShe used force and sweet words to deceive him. If it was the previous Shen Hui, he might have been taken away by her. But after talking to Shen Haiyang, Shen Hui knew that his mother had no good intentions in taking him away, and he refused to go with her no matter what.\nããâNo. If you insist that I go to dinner with you, then wait for my dad to come back and arrange a time with my dad to pick me up.â\nããHe was controlled by Murong Danling and couldnât get away. He saw her pulling him away. She didnât listen to anything he said. He was too weak to pry her arm open. In a moment of desperation, he reached into his trouser pocket for a pencil sharpener. His slender fingers flexibly opened the knife and raised his hand to cut Murong Danlingâs arm.\nããâah,â\nããMurong Danling screamed in pain and then loosened the shackles on him. Shen Hui nervously held the knife in his hand. She looked up and saw the shining blade, and was extremely annoyed by the childâs behavior.\nããâHow dare you, little wolf cub, use a knife on your mother? Come here, or Iâll beat you to death today.â\nããShe cursed and went forward to pull him. In panic, Shen Hui swung the knife at her again, hitting her palm. She screamed in pain, covering her right hand with her left hand and jumping on the spot.\nããâYou bastard, how dare you scratch me? Iâm your own mother.â\nããâIâm sorry.â Seeing the blood on her arms and palms, Shen Hui was terrified and trembling all over. âI didnât mean it. You insisted that I go with you just now, and I was anxiousâ¦ How are you? Letâs go to the hospital quickly.â\nããâCome on, follow me.â\nããAs soon as he approached, she tried to drag him away again. Shen Hui forgot to put away the blade of the knife in his hand in fear, so he waved his hand and stabbed her again. Her arm was cut three times in a row, and she cursed Shen Hui in pain.\nããShe had been coaxing him with a very low voice just now, but Shen Huiâs voice was loud and had alarmed the neighbors. At this time, she shouted loudly, and the female neighbor who was entrusted by Li Xia to take care of them ran over here quickly. There was also a passerby who had just been watching silently, and now they moved closer, wanting to eat the melon up close.\nããThe female neighbor works at Li Xiaâs steamed bun shop. Before, when Li Xia was taking care of Shen Haiyang in the hospital, she was the one who looked after the three children. At this moment, she immediately put Shen Hui behind her, like a hen protecting her chicks.\nããItâs funny, this scene is really the opposite. Murong Danling is obviously Shen Huiâs biological mother, but Shen Huiâs panic and fear now all come from her. On the contrary, it was his stepmotherâs neighbor employee, who protected him so much and pulled him behind her without hesitation.\nããâMurong Danling, what do you want to do?â\nããMurong Danling started to curse, and many people were attracted by her shouting. It was impossible to secretly take Shen Hui away, which meant that their plan failed again. She was frustrated and annoyed, her arm was still aching, and she pointed at Shen Hui with gritted teeth, as if he was her mortal enemy.\nããâYouâre a wolf cub whoâs betraying your own peopleâ¦â\nããHuihua and Yiyi were also startled by the screams, and Yiyi almost lost his shoes.\nããThose around him worriedly asked him what happened. He had only been in the bathroom for a few minutes, why did he look so frightened in such a short time? Why did his mother scold him again? His brother did nothing, why did his mother always bully his brother?\nããâIâm in trouble.â\nããSeeing his brother and sister, he relaxed all of a sudden. He had only one thought in mind: he must not be taken away by her. His father had repeatedly told him not to go with her, which made him subconsciously know that if he went with her, something bad would happen. He realized what he had done and threw away the knife in his hand out of fear.\nããWhen Shen Haiyang and Li Xia came back, Murong Danling was still scolding Shen Hui. Shen Haiyang frowned in anger, because Li Xia was walking in front, and Shen Hui came over and threw himself on her.\nããâMom, I didnât mean it. I really didnât mean it.â\nããShen Haiyang squatted down to comfort his son, and Li Xia also touched the childâs head to comfort him. Hearing Murong Danlingâs angry scolding, she was furious. She had raised this child for such a long time, and he kept calling her mother. He was scared and rushed to them for help and shelter.\nããâSnapped,â\nããLi Xia asked Shen Haiyang to calm the child down, and without further ado, she gave Murong Danling a slap in the face. âShut your stinky mouth. Heâs your son. Iâve never seen a mother insult her child like this. If you donât like him, can you please stay away from him? Our whole family will thank you.â\nããâLi Xia,â\nããHer arm was slashed several times by her son with a knife, and Li Xia raised her hand to slap her in the face. She was furious and tried to fight back with her right hand out of habit, but it hurt so much that she had to put it down and it was too late to use other hand, as Li Xia had already slapped her.\nããâAh, second brother.â\nããShe lay sideways, her pretty face wet with tears, her right cheek swollen with clear marks of a slap. Her arms and palms were covered in blood. She turned around the corner to seek help after being hit. But there was no one there. Her second brother had already run away when he saw the opportunity, leaving her alone.\n",
    "41": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c28/\nCHAPTER 28\nããâLi Xia, donât go too far. Sheâs the biological mother. Whatâs wrong with wanting to take care of her own child?â\nããFang Zhongcheng came to see his son. He was scolded by Li Xia before, so he came here to show his face today, and he happened to see this. He was inexplicably a hero saving the beauty, and Shen Haiyang didnât waste any words and called the police directly. The couple didnât bother to pay attention to him. They had the same stance. It was a waste of time to talk to them.\nããMurong Danlingâs relationship with Shen Hui has become so irreconcilable that he will definitely win the lawsuit to deprive her of visitation rights. Although this will not prevent her from meeting Shen Hui in public, she will no longer be able to take Shen Hui away alone without being bound by the law.\nããShe tried again and again to take Shen Hui away without his knowledge. If he guessed correctly, they wanted to split their forces into two groups to launch an alternative kidnapping threat.\nããThe group soon sat down at the police station, and Shen Hui who was held by his father and told the story. Murong Danling tried to interrupt several times, but was stopped by the police.\nããâWait a minute, let the child finish speaking first.â\nããâComrade police officer, Iâm the one whoâs injured now.â Murong Danling raised her arm, âShouldnât you send me to the hospital first?â\nããThe police officer looked at her and said, âThe blood has already clotted. Itâs just a minor injury. It wonât be too late to go after we finish taking the statement.â\nããAnother person muttered, âReally? Itâs just a scratch. Donât worry about it and it will heal on its own.â\nããMurong Danling was so angry that she had no choice but to wait until the police finished listening to Shen Huiâs words and asked the child if what he said was true. She was so angry that she wanted to refute but couldnât.\nããâSo you wanted to take Shen Hui away by force, but Shen Hui didnât want to. When you used brute force, Shen Hui accidentally scratched your arm with a knife. Is that right?â\nããâNo, police comrade. The brat did it on purpose. He cut me with the knife on purpose.â She raised her bloodstained sleeves and palms. âLook, thereâs so much blood. If he didnât do it on purpose, would he have cut me three times?â\nããNeighbors and passersby also came to the police station to make statements. At this time, as bystanders, they spoke up: âBullshit. You tried to take the child away secretly one after another. The child shouted to wait for his father to come back, but you didnât listen at all. He was scared by you and scratched you a few times.â\nããâYou are such a mother, why do you have to take the child away with force? Just wait until his father comes back and tell everyone, then nothing will happen.â\nããThe information of all parties was collected and the police station took notes. This matter was not a big deal. After all, no one knew Murong Danlingâs motives, and she was not stupid enough to tell others. The mother-son feud was just a matter of mediation. The police meant that Shen Haiyang would treat Murong Danlingâs injuries and the matter would be over.\nããMurong Danling shouted that this matter was not that easy, and left the police station in a rage, preparing to go to the hospital. Fang Zhongcheng was also brought in for questioning, and he rode out to see her alone and pitiful. How did the couple teach their children? It must be Li Xia, who taught the children not to recognize their own biological parents.\nããâShall I take you there?â\nããâThanks.â\nããShen Haiyang was waiting for the court to open. With this case, he had a 99% chance of winning the case. Whether or not to deprive parents of their children of their visitation rights was based on the harm and impact on the children. Apart from this, even if the other party did pay child support, it was not allowed. This case was the opportunity.\nããEven though the lawsuit was filed, it is unlikely that there will be a result in a short period of time. Shen Hui was frightened and dared not sleep alone at night. Last night, Shen Haiyang accompanied him. Today, he said that he would let his younger brother accompany him.\nããâAre you really not afraid? Your brother is still young and may not be able to give you a sense of security.â\nããâItâs okay, Iâm not afraid anymore.â He looked at Shen Haiyang and said, âDad, her armâ¦â\nããThe child was frightened by the nagging, but still missed her. Shen Haiyang reached out and hugged the child, âItâs just a broken skin. It will heal quickly after cleaning and bandaging. Donât worry.â\nããâoh.â\nããShen Haiyang sighed silently, but decided to have a deep talk with him. âDo you know why she insisted on taking you away without telling me?â\nããShen Hui shook his head: âShe was definitely not missing me.â\nããâSomeone saw Murong Danlingâs second brother sneaking around the scene, which means she went there with her second brother.â\nããHis words are illogical and shen Hui is too young to guess.\nããHe continued, âShe would take you away when no one was around, hid you somewhere. Then you suddenly disappeared, what would happen to your parents?â\nããâYouâll be worried and look for me everywhere.â\nããâIf someone sends us a message at this moment, saying that you have been kidnapped, and asks us to pay them money, or they will kill you. What should we do? By the way, killing you means they will kill you if you donât pay them money.â\nããâAh? Will mom and dad be deceived and give them money?â\nããâA normal person would give money. No matter how important money is, it is not as important as your own children.â\nããMurong Danling didnât know that he had used all the money to buy the shop. If she succeeded this time, the couple would be very worried. They might have to call the police, but it was hard to say what would happen in the end.\nããItâs not that youâre afraid of thieves stealing, but youâre afraid of thieves thinking about it. Murong Danling has visitation rights, and she has been thinking of these evil ways. This time, her rights can be completely revoked, so she gave up. When there is no loophole to exploit, she dare not challenge the law.\nããShen Hui was silent, and Shen Haiyang didnât say anything, letting him sort it out on his own. The room was quiet for a few minutes, and the child raised his head and figured it out.\nããâShe, she is my biological mother, so it is legal for her to take me away. This way they can ask you for money without worrying about being caught by the police.â\nããâYes. So donât be afraid. She didnât mean to hurt you at all, and you didnât hurt her much. Of course, I mean physically.â\nããShen Hui nodded, and his fear of being forced dissipated a lot. It was money again. She would do anything for money. Although she didnât hurt his body, he hated her even more mentally.\nããâThen, if she comes to see me againâ¦â\nããâDad sued to deprive her of her visitation rights to you. If we win the lawsuit, she will lose the right to visit you freely. She canât take you away without my knowledge. Her advantage is gone. She doesnât dare to do it again because it is illegal and she doesnât have the guts. So donât be afraid of her. If you donât like her, just ignore her.â\nããâAll right.â\nããAfter talking to the child, he left and returned to the main room. He heard Yi Yi talking to his brother behind him. The little guyâs childish words saved Shen Hui from being bored.\nããLying on the bed, Li Xia turned sideways to him and said, âHuihui is like this, we have to find a way to ease his mood, right?â\nããâI talked to him, and he knows Murong Danling doesnât want to hurt him, so heâs not so sad or scared anymore. The case will go to court soon, and once Murong Danlingâs visitation rights are completely revoked, sheâll give up.â\nããâWell, he must feel bad if his own mother does this. How about this, letâs find some time to take them out to play. Letâs go for a walk nearby and let the children run around and play in the wild.â\nããThere were no psychologists at that time, so parents had to help their children relieve their emotions. Shen Haiyangâs conversation had helped Shen Hui slowly get rid of the feeling of being victimized, and he realized that Murong Danlingâs purpose was not to harm his life, but just for money. Now he can take the child out to play and let him relax.\nããâOkay. The day after tomorrow is the the weekend, letâs go play together.â\nããâOkay.â\nããLi Xia also arranged time for Xiao Liu to put out fewer goods at the stall. The family took the children to the wild on the weekend, and when they saw a wild rabbit on the road, the three children excitedly chased it.\nããIt was a sunny day with a gentle breeze on my face. The childrenâs laughter was heard in the ears. Seeing them laughing and playing happily in the wild made the adults feel relaxed. Li Xia found a flat grassy area and spread the bed sheet she brought, then sat down with Shen Haiyang. They can climb the mountain here, but Shen Haiyang has a bad heart, so they took a car to take them directly to the foot of the mountain.\nããThe adults sat and chatted, while the children ran around happily. At noon, they had a picnic outside. Li Xia brought bread, milk, instant noodles, and various fruits. She also cooked a pot of chicken soup and brought a bowl and spoon. She just lit a fire with a dead branch and heated it up. Everyone had a bowl of hot soup.\nããâEat it all. You have to finish this chicken.â\nããHuihua chatted with her mother: âMom, why do we have to finish everything?â\nããâ I brought it with me when I came here, so how can I bring it back with me when I go back?â\nããâHa ha,â\nããYi Yi was chewing chicken wings and said incoherently, âDonât worry, Iâm here, we can finish it all.â\nããA chicken was not too fat, and the family of five ate up all the meat and soup. In the afternoon, Shen Haiyang went fishing by the river, and Li Xia shared the food she brought with the children, hoping to go home empty-handed.\nããLying on the grass, leisurely and comfortable. âSo comfortable, as free as a bird.â\nããShen Haiyang looked back at her, and they smiled without saying anything. This kind of silent feeling is actually very good, and silence is better than words, which makes people feel very peaceful.\nããThe children played by themselves while he fished quietly. She lay on the grass in the sun and fell asleep in the warmth. She woke up to the sound of birds singing and was covered with his coat.\nããâwoke up?â\nããâHmm. Where are the three monkey kids?â\nããâPlaying with the fish over there.â\nããLi Xia looked back and saw that the pot was full of water. The children were discussing whether the fish in it should be braised or stewed. Thinking that Shen Haiyang had caught a big fish, she stood up and looked over. It was just a small crucian carp. It can be stewed or braised, but she should raise it first.\nããAfter a whole day of relaxation, Shen Hui was smiling when he returned. The gloom in his eyes disappeared, and he played with his brother. After all, he was a child, and his emotions came and went quickly. Without the fear of being hurt, and with his family by his side, all the gloom would dissipate.\nããHe went to school as usual on Monday, and the lawsuit was heard in a few days. The evidence provided by Shen Haiyang was very sufficient, and Murong Danling lost more than she gained this time, and was deprived of the right to visit her son.\nããIf she had no bad intentions, we were all in the same city and could be seen everywhere, at the school gate and at the doorstep of home, so she couldnât have any bad thoughts.\nããMurong Danling came out of the court with a cold look in her eyes and glared fiercely in the direction of her ex-husband. Her second brother wanted to talk to her, but she pushed him away, looking like she didnât want to listen.\nããâHey, Danling, Danling.â She turned and walked away quickly, with her second brother chasing after her.\nããShen Haiyang shook his head, hoping that his ex-wife would stop doing evil things. She would grab at anything that was profitable, and her eating with a bottomless stomach habit was so ugly and despicable that it made people feel sick.\n(eating with a bottomless stomach habit :- A person who can keep eating without ever seeming to fill up, or a vessel which never fills however much is added.)\n",
    "42": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c28-2/\nOn the way home, the couple bought a lot of vegetables and meat. Murong Danling lost her visitation rights, and the relationship with her son was legally divided. Emotionally, Shen Hui hated her behavior and rejected her from the bottom of his heart. Her influence on Shen Hui was getting weaker and weaker, which was worth celebrating.\nããStewed pork bones, braised pork with chestnuts, scrambled eggs with tomatoes, cold bean curd, pork ribs and lotus root soup, and today there was actually venison. Li Xia bought two pounds and roasted it in a frying pan, preparing to eat it with sweet and sour garlic and wrapped in vegetable leaves.\n\n\n\n(Stewed pork bones)\n\n\n\n(braised pork with chestnuts)\n\n\n\n(scrambled eggs with tomatoes)\n\n\n\n(cold bean curd)\n\n\n\n( pork ribs and lotus root soup)\nããâMom, itâs so rich.â\nããShen Haiyang was cooking with her, and the three little ones came over when they smelled the aroma, especially Yi Yi, who was so greedy that he wanted to open the pot and eat a piece of meat right away.\nããLi Xia clapped his hands and said, âItâs hot. You little troublemaker, youâve already become fat, and youâre still thinking about eating every day.â\nããYi Yi pouted, âBut the teacher said Iâm cute. My friend Xiaolu doesnât eat well, so the teacher only gives her half a bowl each time for fear that sheâll leave some leftovers. But for me, thereâs plenty, and if she sees Iâve finished, sheâll serve me more. Sheâll also give me more afternoon snacks, and sheâll secretly give me what Xiaolu canât finish.â\nããâHaha,â everyone laughed. Li Xia rolled her eyes at him. In her previous life, she remembered that he seemed to have started to lose weight after he was six years old, and he never gained weight again. Now he is small, maybe just baby fat.\nããâIs the Xiaolu a boy or a girl?â\nããâItâs a girl. Mom, you really donât care about me at all. Dad knows Xiaolu. Xiaolu likes my dad very much and told me that my dad is a good person. She also wants a dad like him.â\nããShen Hui replied: âForget it, we already have three at home, so donât let her come.â\nããThey nodded one by one, agreeing with their brother. âYes, so I didnât agree to her.â\nããThis naughty kid, it seems that if you agree to this father, he will give it to her. Shen Haiyang is really good-natured, and several children like him. He is also very knowledgeable and tells stories. Every day when he pick up Yi Yi, she hear the naughty kid talking to him. The naughty kid had never been like this with Li Xia in his previous life. He would run away as soon as he saw her holding a broom.\nããAfter a sumptuous meal, everyone said they were full. Shen Hui loved the roasted venison the most. âMom, the roasted meat is delicious. Can we have another meal during the Chinese New Year?â\n\n\n\nããâAs long as itâs available, weâll eat it again next month.â\nããâOh yeah.â\nããâYour Aunt Xu is from Sichuan, and she makes delicious pickles. Ask her to pickle two jars of kimchi for you. It will definitely taste good when you wrap them around the barbecue.â\nããâMom, I love that pickled ginger, tell auntie to remember to put more.â\nããThe girl finally made a request, and Li Xia was sure to satisfy it. âNo problem, Iâll make a jar just for you.â\nããâYou donât need that much. Donât waste too much.â\nããâYou can use it for cooking, so thereâs no waste.â\nããAunt Xu was the neighbor that Li Xia had asked to take care of them. She was quick-tempered and cooked delicious food. Li Xia did what she said. She bought the ingredients in the afternoon and asked her to pickle two jars of kimchi.\nããCowpeas, radishes, and peppers in red and green colors are soaked in a jar, and another smaller jar contains young ginger and peppers. They taste very good when stir-fried or used as side dishes.\nããXu Xifeng put the lid on and sealed the edges with water. âThis way, it will be sealed from the air and wonât go bad. You can eat it in three to five days. Iâll add some of my old pickled soup.â\nããâOkay, thank you.â\nããâDonât be polite, we are neighbors.â\nããThe next day was the weekend and there was no school. Li Xia was setting up a stall outside, and the three children were bored and came out to play nearby. Shen Hui knew that his mother and uncle would not dare to hurt him, so this time there was no sequelae. He just paid attention to the safety issues that his parents mentioned, but he didnât need to be too scared in crowded places in broad daylight.\nããLi Xia was bargaining with a customer. The customer was interested in the most expensive piece of clothing she had, so she was reluctant to give in. She wanted to earn more.\nããYi Yi got bored and started reciting ancient poems, from Li Bai to Du Fu, each of which was a short five-character quatrain but he couldnât help reciting so many poems one after another, and immediately attracted the attention of the male customer.\nããâIs this your son?â\nããLi Xia nodded: âYes, my son.â\nããâWhat a clever child, he can recite so many poems at such a young age. Did you teach him all of them?â\nããâNo, his father taught him.â\nããâIt seems your husband is very educated.â\nããLi Xia looked at him in confusion, âWhat are you talking about?â âWhat does my sonâs recitation of poetry have to do with you buying my clothes?â Yi Yi looked up at him and greeted him. He tilted his head and waved his little hand, looking very cute.\nããâHello, uncle.â\nããâHello.â\nããâUncle, arenât you going to buy my motherâs clothes?â\nããâI am considering.â\nããâIf I can recite âSong of the Wineâ, will you buy my motherâs clothes?â\nããâYou want to recite âSong of the Wineâ? Are you sure you can recite it?â\nããâWhat if I recite it?â\nããâThen I will buy this dress without hesitation.â\nããThe man obviously didnât believe that such a young child could recite a long masterpiece. Shen Hui thought to himself: Well, my brother has brought another business to my mother.\nããâDonât you see that the water of the Yellow River comes from the skyâ¦ Iâll call my son to exchange it for good wine, so that we can share our eternal sorrow.â\nããThe little guy recited Li Baiâs long poem fluently without any stuttering. The man was amazed, and then he paid for the dress quickly. Before leaving, he looked at the little guy and praised Li Xia endlessly.\nããâYou have to train him well. This child has an excellent memory.â\nããIn her previous life, Li Xia didnât understand these things and never taught them. She only knew that her son had been at the top of the class since he started school. In this life, Shen Haiyang picked up and dropped off the children most often, and he was the one who told the children stories. She didnât expect that he could recite such a long poem fluently at such a young age.\nããAfter the man left, Xiao Liu gave Yiyi a thumbs up. The little guy smiled happily after being in the spotlight, and Li Xia gave him a dime.\nããâDad actually taught you to recite such a long poem?â\nããâDad told me about the genres of poetry and then read me this one. Seeing that I liked it, he taught me to memorize it.â Then the little guy whispered to his mother: âI memorized it for a long time. This one is more difficult than the shorter ones.â\nããâGood.â\nããAfter closing the stall and returning home in the evening, Li Xia asked Shen Haiyang while cooking: âWhat is the genre of poetry?â\nããâLiterary genre refers to the category of literary works. Different poetry genres have different writing methods.â Shen Haiyang turned his head and looked at her curiously: â\nWhy are you asking about this?â\nããâWould you think Iâm useless?â\nããFang Zhongcheng had scolded her like this in her previous life. Oh, Fang Zhongcheng seemed to have scolded her like this when she just woke up in this life. She didnât finish junior high school in the countryside, so she didnât understand many things.\nããâWho said that about my wife? Tell me Iâll go find him.â\nããShen Haiyang was about to take off his apron and walk out, but Li Xia quickly stopped him. âNo, Iâm just afraid that youâll dislike me. I donât know how to do anything.â\nããThe man knew what she meant and teased her on purpose. He reached out and hugged her: âWho said you canât do anything? You can cook and wash clothes, and keep the house warm and tidy. You can take care of us and give us a warm home.â\nããâBut it seems like other women can do this, too.â\nããâBut other women are not you.â\nããThe subtext of this statement is: You are unique, there is no need to compare with anyone. It is you I met, and no one can replace you.\nããâAnd what you said is not right. Who says all women do these things? The wife of our neighbor Lao Wang plays mahjong all day long. Her mother-in-law says her house is like a pigsty. She doesnât care about her children and she still has debts after losing money. She has had several fights with her husband because of this.â\nããAfter saying that, he tilted his head and kissed her: âMy wife is so good, no one can compare to her. Itâs just that sometimes she works too hard, it would be better if she could take a proper rest.â\nããThese sweet words really touched her heart. She finally experienced what she had been unable to obtain in her previous life. After tasting it, she realized how sweet it was.\nããIn her previous life, she had chased Fang Zhongcheng, lived and died for him, and gave birth to two children for him. She had been soaked in bitter water all her life. In this life, she had a different person to live with, and the little bit of inferiority she had just felt was immediately wiped out by him.\nããâBut I have read so little. What if I donât understand what you say to me?â\nããâI have a mouth, canât I explain it to you?â the man asked back with a smile. âI just read a few more books, itâs no big deal. If you like it, Iâll tell you about it later in the evening.â\nããâUm.â\nããâLi Xia, Haiyang, a guy in the car is here to look for you, are you home?â\nããThe coupleâs warm embrace was broken, and they let go and walked out with a smile. Shen Haiyang held her and tucked her messy hair behind her ears, and then they walked out one after the other.\n",
    "43": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c29/\nCHAPTER 29\nããThere were already many people gathered at their house gate. She saw a family car in the crowd and immediately quickened her pace out of curiosity. Cars are rare nowadays. What kind of important person has come to her house?\nããâFinally youâre back. Haiyangâs brother came back from abroad to look for you. We were just talking about it when you came.â\nããThe person who spoke was an older sister-in-law from Li Xiaâs steamed bun shop. Hearing this, the couple looked at the man in a suit and tie, and the man also turned around and looked at them.\nããTheir eyes met in the air, and both parties were silently looking at each other. Shen Haiyang had recovered well in the past few days, with a full complexion and gentle features. The man who looked a bit like him had a slicked-back face, wore a black custom-made suit, and stood in the crowd with a somewhat impatient look. The woman next to him was wearing high heels and a fashionable Western-style suit, and she had rolled her eyes several times in such a short time.\nããâHello, Iâm Shen Haiyang.â\nããâIâm Shen Yaozong, and my fatherâs name is Shen Xiao.â\nããShen Haiyang went over to say hello and held out his hand. The man who claimed to be his younger brother also held out his hand after introducing himself, but he shook it lightly with an impatient look. The two brothers who met for the first time in decades were more unfamiliar than strangers.\nããDonât talk about your family affairs in public, Li Xia quickly opened the door and invited the guests in. The two of them looked around with disdain in their eyes. After entering the house, they looked down on the furnishings. Li Xia made some tea for them, but the woman rolled her eyes and said she didnât want to drink it.\nããâI only drink hand-ground coffee.â\nããâSorry, we donât have that at home.â\nããA mainland woman, she was not afraid at all when talking to her. The woman looked up at Li Xia and silently sized her up in her heart.\nããâThatâs understandable. People in the mainland just drink broken leaves.â\nããâSo, if you donât like anything, what are you doing here?â\nããLi Xiaâs words were full of sarcasm, and Shen Haiyang looked at his cheap brother with a questioning look on his face. What the hell, if you donât like it, donât come. If you come then show off your dead look to whoever wantsÂ  to see you.\nããâDo you think we are willing to come? Itâs because you guys keep calling us. Otherwise, we wouldnât careâ¦â\nããâAnnie,â\nããThe man interrupted the woman with a shout, and the woman rolled her eyes in anger and said nothing more. The man nodded to Shen Haiyang, then explained his purpose.\nããâFather heard the content of your phone call from the servant at home, and also received your letter. When the old man was sick, he said that he missed home and wanted to return to the mainland. He asked me to come back and buy a house near your home for him to live in.â\nããSo thatâs how it is, Shen Haiyang nodded to show that he understood. His father sent him so much money, and now he wanted to live with him in his old age, he couldnât refuse.\nããâItâs not easy to buy a house in a provincial capital, and itâs even harder if you want a house with a private door and yard. Iâll ask my friends to keep an eye out and let you know if thereâs a suitable one.â\nããâDo you really agree with your father coming back to live with you?â\nããThe manâs eyes were wide open, as if Shen Haiyang had done something unforgivable. His wife was also angry, looking at Li Xia and her husband with great rage.\nããâI said they went to so much trouble to contact our father over and over again, it must be for the inheritance. Now that the old man is coming back, of course they are happy.â\nããIt turned out to be about money again. Li Xia and her husband looked at each other and understood. This was the Shen familyâs business. Li Xia didnât say much and let Shen Haiyang solve it himself.\nããâYou said it yourself just now. It was the old manâs idea to return to China, and you came here to buy a house for him to live in. I was just doing my duty as a host and offering to help you. You two are so rude to ridicule me like this. Isnât it said that everything abroad is better than in China? I donât think so.â\nãã The couple was embarrassed by the ridicule. The woman wanted to say something but was stopped by the manâs eyes, so he started the conversation with Shen Haiyang.\nããâI grew up abroad. The environment and language habits are different from those in China. Maybe you didnât understand what I meant. I came here to tell you that the environment in China is too bad and not suitable for father to live in. You should work with me to persuade father to give up this idea.â\nããâIt is a traditional Chinese thought that fallen leaves return to their roots. It is the old manâs freedom to decide how to spend his old age. I think it is fine to spend his old age overseas or in China. I donât think There is something wrong with this decision, Iâm sorry I canât help you in advising him.â\nããShen Haiyang refused directly without even beating around the bush. As soon as he made his attitude clear, the coupleâs faces turned black. They had already looked down on him, and now they thought he was after the old manâs property.\nããâDad has been ill for the past few years and we have been taking care of him. Isnât this too unkind of you?â\nããâWhen he returns to the mainland, I will also fulfill my filial duty.â\nããAnother soft nail was hit back, and Shen Yaozong was speechless. He was also his fatherâs blood, and had the same inheritance rights as him. The old man had untied the knot in his heart, and after learning that he had a son and a grandson, he must return to the mainland. It seemed that it would be difficult for him to stop it.\nããâLetâs go. I told you itâs useless to come to them, but you wonât give up.â\nããThe woman was the first to leave the house in annoyance. Shen Yaozong glanced at the brother he met for the first time and then shook his head and left together. The two of them couldnât find the door they came in through in the yard. It was Shen Hui who was playing in the yard who pointed it out.\nããThe gate of the traditional Chinese courtyard house is located in the southeast corner, hidden in the courtyard and impossible to see at a glance. The ancient oriental thinking is incomprehensible to these two people who grew up in foreign countries. After leaving the courtyard, they were extremely dissatisfied with the house.\nããThe two got in the car and drove away. The three little ones came in and Shen Hui asked his father: âIs Grandpa, coming back?â\nããShen Haiyang nodded, and said nothing more to the children, asking them to go back to their room to do their homework. Li Xia had time to go into the kitchen to cook today, and after dinner the children watched TV, she took out her wallet and showed it to Shen Haiyang.\nããShe has done a lot of wholesale business since she came back, and she has recovered some of her funds. Shen Haiyang looked at the wallet on his lap in a daze, and asked her what she meant.\nããâWhy, do you want me to help you count the money?â\nããâThere are about six or seven thousand yuan here, which is almost enough to buy a yard.â\nããShen Haiyang looked at her and slowly opened his lips, revealing a knowing smile. She could see that he wanted to do something for his father whom he had never met. After all, he had accepted so many gifts.\nããâWill it affect your cash flow?â\nããâNo. I still have a lot of goods. Once I sell them all, I will have money.â\nããâThanks.â\nããâWe are a couple, no need to be so polite.â Li Xia smiled and said, âYou said it.â\nããâWith a wife like this, what more could a husband ask for?â\nããLi Xia didnât quite understand what this meant, but she knew it was definitely a compliment to her. He could put a property worth hundreds of millions of yuan in her name, and he could listen to her and use all his money to buy a shop for her to do business. She just took out money to buy a house for his father, wasnât this what she should do?\nããâIâll also help inquire and see if there is anyone suitable.â\nããâOkay.â Shen Haiyang said as he looked back. There was actually a complete courtyard behind his yard. The backyard was somewhat damaged and several families lived there. The original alley was blocked, and the two courtyards that were originally connected were now independent.\nããâHow about you find a way to buy the yard behind our house? Then we can renovate it and turn the blocked alley into a small door. When itâs closed, itâs independent, and when itâs opened, we can communicate with each other.â\nããâThere are five or six families living in the yard behind our house. How can we buy it? We should talk to each family one by one. There are no commercial houses in the provincial capital now. Ordinary people will not sell their houses, right? Even if the price is high, they canât sell it. Otherwise, where will they live?â\nããThis is indeed a problem. Today, it is not like the past when you can buy a house at will. As long as you have enough money, you can buy a house anywhere. Nowadays, everyone relies on housing for survival. If you sell your house, will the whole family live on the street?\nããâIâll try my best to figure it out. Whether it succeeds or not, Iâll see first.â\nããâThatâs fine. Just tell me what you need me to do, and weâll do our best to buy a suitable yard.â\n",

If you want to read all the chapters at once you can purchase them on my Ko-fi shop(as some of my readers were asking if i had advance chapter thing). Those who want to read it all at once can buy them. \nPlease Read more about it at the bottom.\n\n\nBecause the old man was coming back suddenly, the couple was thinking about what to do with the house. Their yard was not small, and if they exchanged the rooms, they could make room for the wing or the main room, and Li Xia was willing to give it to the old man.\nããBut her family was doing business in the back house, so it was a bit noisy every day. Otherwise, they moved back to the original house and gave this place to the old man? Once the street door was closed, the doors and windows of the back house were also closed, then there shouldnât be much impact.\nããThe next day, Li Xia told Shen Haiyang her thoughts, but the man just smiled and said nothing.\nããHe looked out the window and saw that no one was paying attention, so he leaned over and kissed her.\nããâDonât worry, Iâll think of other ways first.â\nããLi Xiaâs cheeks were reddened by his kiss early in the morning, and she didnât understand what she had said to make him so happy. Anyway, she started to prepare.\nããIn the morning, he went to work and the children went to school. She rode her bike to the old house to tell the tenants that the lease could be terminated at any time. Upon hearing this, both families were unhappy and started to yell at her.\nããâHow can you just say you donât want to rent it? We just bought furniture and wedding supplies. If you donât rent it to us, where are we going to live?â\nããThe tenants of the east room were also a young couple. At this time, the woman also said, âYes. We rented this house because we couldnât fit in our home. If you donât rent it to us, where will we live? Our rent is due until October.â\nããâI will definitely let you stay here until the end of October. During this time you can find another house.â\nããâThat wonât work. We live here well, and how can you just say you donât want to rent it ?â\nããâThis house is mine. I can rent it out if I want to, and I can take it back if I want to. Itâs my house and I have the final say. Itâs not your turn to have a say.â\nããâIâ¦.â\nããOld Lady Liu was so anxious that she had no idea what to do. What they said was reasonable. The house belonged to them, and they could take it back if they wanted. No matter how you look at it, they were right. It was not like the past, when the poorer one was right. You had to return someone elseâs property unconditionally.\nããâI know itâs hard to find a house, so I informed you all so long in advance to give you time to find one. We all know each other, and I wouldnât do this if I didnât have any difficulties. This house may be useful to you, but thereâs really nothing I can do.â\nããâLi Xia, are you having troubles for speaking like this?â\nããLi Xia nodded. âIf my problem is solved, you can continue to rent this house, but if itâs not solved, you have to move out when the rent expires.â\nããTo be clear, the two families were eager to help her solve her problem because her house had a good location. One by one, Li Xia asked, but she didnât say anything. Everyone had the same problem, so what was the point of telling you?\nããShe was preparing for the house and busy with business. Then in the afternoon, the postman delivered a letter with a remittance slip. The remittance slip was from abroad and the amount on it was 50,000 US dollars.\nããLi Xia didnât open it, and waited for Shen Haiyang to come back from work before handing him the letter and the remittance slip. âItâs from your father. Letâs see whatâs written inside. Why did he send so much money?â\nããShen Haiyang tore open the envelope and found the words written in pen. The specific content was that the old father first expressed his feelings to him, and talked about his helplessness and guilt towards the mother and son during the tense situation. Then he said that he wanted to return to his hometown and asked him to help buy a house.\nããShen Haiyang frowned after reading it, and Li Xia patted his shoulder to comfort him. âThey wonât be back until next year, so we can still make it. Iâve already told the two families who rented the house over there, and weâll take back the house when the rent expires. Then weâll move back and give this place to the old man. Weâll replace the main room with new furniture, and seal the doors and windows of the back room on the courtyard side. Letâs prepare anything else.â\nããShen Haiyang looked at her and relaxed his brows. âDonât worry, weâll talk about this later.â\nããHe said so, Li Xia nodded and got up to cook. His brother looked like he didnât want the old man to come back. He had received 50,000 US dollars from the old man before, and now he sent another 50,000 back. They had to take care of the house. Even if the old man came back to stay for only a month or even a week, the house had to be prepared.\nããâNext time they come, they will definitely have something bad to say. You donât have to give in. Just be more aggressive with them. Donât put yourself in a difficult position.â\nããLi Xia turned around and asked, âAre you talking about your brother and his wife?â\nããâUm.â\nããâI thought you felt guilty because you got the benefit.â\nããâI have nothing to be ashamed of. He is my biological father. My last name is Shen and I am a descendant of the Shen family. According to the inheritance law, his property should be mine. If the old man doesnât give it to me, I have nothing to say, but itâs not his turn to be dissatisfied.â\nããLi Xia gave him a thumbs up and agreed with what he said. The old manâs property, he can use it however he wants and give it to whoever he wants. As a younger brother, you always say that we are after money, do you have the qualifications?\nããThey donât know how much money his father has. If itâs a lot, what will happen in the future?\nããShe doesnât know what kind of temper the old man has. She hopes to get along better with my father-in-law when he returns to China and settle in a city.\nããIf you donât think about the future, you will have immediate worries. Seeing that there will be another elder in a few months, Li Xia couldnât help but think about it. Judging from the coupleâs style, the old man should be no ordinary person.\nããShen Haiyang cooked while thinking, and soon called the children to eat. When he went out to look for the children, he saw two who looked familiar. He asked his son and found out that they were indeed the two children of Murong Danlingâs sister.\nããâThey are at his grandmotherâs house, which is not far from here. I often see them playing outside recently. Dad, I didnât play with them. They were just playing together awith other kids.â\nããâWell, itâs best to keep some distance from them.â\nããâI know.â\nããâUncle.â\nããThe two children greeted him. Shen Haiyang frowned and was about to speak, but his brother patted him on the back of the head and scolded him, âYou should call him uncle shen, not uncle.â\nããThe younger brother touched his head and smiled at Shen Haiyang: âHello, Uncle Shen.â\nããâHello.â\nããThe child called him politely, and he answered casually. Shen Haiyang took his son home. Many people watched TV in the west wing room at night. He felt a little uncomfortable and did not go over. He read quietly in the main room.\nããThe TV in the west wing was showing a great show, and Li Xia went into the east wing to take inventory and keep accounts. She had bought a TV but had rarely watched it, as she was busy with her own things every day. She went in, turned on the light, closed the door, and sat down on a chair beside the kang.\nããThe kang was so full of goods that there was no place to step, so she moved all the remaining goods to this room. She checked the goods while looking at the account book, and time passed unnoticed while she was busy with her head down.\nããSuddenly, her eyes went dark and the light bulb above her head went out. She subconsciously looked up at the roof. During this period, power outages were common. She blinked her eyes and tried to adapt to the darkness as quickly as possible so that she could leave. She vaguely heard a sound coming from outside the door.\nããâWho, whoâs there?â\nããAs she spoke, she reached out to grope for the flashlight, but the more anxious she was, the harder it was to find. After she finished shouting, there were obvious footsteps outside the door. She fumbled for the flashlight in a hurry, turned it on, stood up and walked quickly to the door to open it.\nããIt was also pitch black outside, but everything was normal as far as the flashlight could see. There was a lot of noise in the west wing, and the people who were watching TV had obviously not left yet. This kind of power outage is sometimes temporary, and everyone is hoping that it will come back soon.\nããShe looked around but couldnât find anyone, so she went back to find the flashlight on the kang and came out again. She closed the door and locked it, then checked carefully with the flashlight.\nããThere was nothing wrong in the courtyard, so she went into the west wing to take a look. The people watching TV were sitting and discussing the previous plot, saying all sorts of things. When someone was accused of being argumentative, he became even more excited to refute others.\nããThe adults were sitting and talking excitedly, and the children were also discussing excitedly. Yi Yi said he wanted to go to the toilet, and Shen Hui got up to accompany him. There was nothing unusual about the others.\nããâMom, thereâs a power outage and you canât work?â Shen Hui asked.\nããâYeah.â She handed the flashlight to the child and asked casually, âWhat TV series did you just watch? Was it good? You were so motivated that you wanted to watch it and didnât want to miss it for even a second and had to hold in pee ?â\nããâHuo Yuanjia, mom, do you know Huo Yuanjia? He is a great hero, so powerful.â\nããâSo the ones watching donât even go to the toilet and hold it in?â\nããâThatâs it.â\nããShen Hui led Yi Yi out of the door quickly, and the two children followed them to the bathroom. HuiHua thought she was strange, and after the boys left, she gently pulled her clothes and spoke in a low voice.\nããâMom, is there something wrong with you?â\nããShe took her daughter out, and the two of them talked in the dark at the door of the east wing. âDid anyone who was watching TV in the room come out? It was before the power outage.â\nããThe little girl recalled carefully after hearing what she said, then shook her head: âI didnât notice it. The martial arts competition was just about to begin, and I was too busy watching TV. Whatâs wrong, mom? What happened?â\nããâNo, I was just asking.â\nããMaybe she heard it wrongly, mistaking the footsteps from somewhere else for those at my door? Maybe she was just being overly sensitive.\nããThe electricity that everyone was looking forward to never came, and those who were watching TV left one after another.\nããShe went to bed with a candle, and the moonlight gently sprinkled on the curtains through the window lattice. She could vaguely see the outline of objects in the room, and she muttered softly.\nããâWhy didnât you come out just now?â\nããIf there was moonlight just now, she would have been able to see the shadow, but it was pitch dark before and there was nothing. She didnât know if she was sensitive and heard it wrong, or if someone was coveting her.\nããâWhat did you say?â\nããâNo, I was just talking nonsense.â After saying that, she turned to him and asked casually, âDo you think that our familyâs current situation will make outsiders envious and jealous?â\nããShen Haiyang nodded. âProbably. Whatâs wrong? What happened?â\nããShe told him what happened before: âMaybe I heard it wrong.â\nããâMove the TV to the bun shop, and let everyone watch it there after closing the kitchen at night. Turning on the TV early in the morning can also attract people. There are ready-made seats there for watching TV. Although it is messy, it is not in our backyard.â\nããâgood idea.â\nããThe house door was closed, and the neighbors who were watching TV entered the back room from the door facing the street to watch TV. The tables and chairs were neatly arranged in the spacious hall, and two large thermoses of hot water were placed on the cabinet in the corner.\nããâThatâs great! They even prepared hot water for us.â\nããâItâs so comfortable to sit and watch, just like in a movie theater.â The woman smiled and poured herself some water from a bowl, pointing at the tall men and saying, âGo to the back. Youâre a big man but you donât have any sense of propriety. Youâre so tall, and if you stick your head forward, youâll block the view of the people behind you.â\nããThe man touched his nose and stood up. Finally, she sat down in the seat before him. The prime time was about to start. People came in one after another. Soon, adults and children sat in most of the room.\nããLi Xia cleared a side room and was busy with her goods at home. Shen Haiyang saw through the window and came to help. The yard was quiet. The couple was busy for more than two hours. When the TV show ended, there was no strange movement like yesterday.\nããThere was only one door on the side of the back room that led to the yard, and it was usually locked. The children would knock on the door and ask for it to be opened after everyone on the other side had left.\nããâMom, Iâm done watching TV.â\nããLi Xia took the key to open the door, and after letting the child out, she prepared to go in and clean the house. As a result, she went in and saw that the house was tidy, and the doors and windows leading to the street were closed tightly.\nããHuihua looked back at her as she went to get the broom and said, âA few aunties cleaned up before leaving. Mom, please come out, lock the door and go to sleep.â\nããâcoming.â\nããLi Xia smiled, shook her head and went out to lock the door again. She was too worried. Two of the people watching TV were working in her bun shop. How could they ignore the hygiene?\nããââââ\nããThat day, Fang Zhongcheng came by bike to help Murong Danling move. At the entrance of the alley, he happened to meet Shen Haiyang and his son at the house gate. The two looked at each other and wanted to say something but didnât say it. Shen Haiyang suddenly stopped because Shen Hui stretched out his hand and pulled him tightly, saying that he was uncomfortable.\nããâHuihui, whatâs wrong with you?â Shen Haiyang held his sonâs hand, and Yiyi threw away his schoolbag and ran out. âDad, you stay with my brother, Iâll go find mom.â\nããShen Hui was carried by his father to the hospital, and Li Xia came out pushing a tricycle. She took the child and put him on the tricycle, letting Shen Haiyang take care of him from behind while she rode in front, and the family hurried to the hospital.\nããIn the chaos, no one noticed that the two of them were there. After the family left, the onlookers started talking. They had heard that Shen Haiyang had a heart disease before, and now they began to think divergently and speculate.\nããâI heard that this disease may be hereditary. Could it be that Shen Hui has it too?â\nããâLi Xia is also suffering. She has been waiting for her husband to wake up, and the children are all well and obedient. Now her husband has this disease. What if Shen Hui inherits it? I heard that if you want to get treatment, you have to go abroad. Do you think that foreign countries are places that ordinary people like us can go?â\nããâGoing abroad for treatment, how much does that cost? No wonder Li Xia works day and night to make money. I havenât seen her rest for such a long time. She doesnât even watch TV at night.â\nããSomething that didnât exist made everyone guess. No one knew that she had received so much US dollars and how much money Li Xiaâs business made. Shen Hui only had dysentery and was fine after receiving an IV in the hospital.\nããMurong Danling and Fang Zhongcheng got the information from everyone and really thought that Shen Hui also inherited heart disease. They thought that the father and son were really a burden. They also said that Li Xia was blessed, but what kind of blessing was that? Whoever found this father and son would be unlucky.\n\n\nT/N : HELLO GUY, I WILL BE LITTLE LATE WITH POSTING THE UPDATES AS I USED TO POST THROUGH MY MOBLIE PHONE BUT UNFORTUANTELY IT BROKE DOWN AND I AM THINKING IF I SHOULD REPAIR IT (AS MONEY IS TIGHT) OR TRY TO BUY A CHEAP NEW ONE.

Two children from his aunt’s family also wanted to come in to watch, but he ordered them to go out with a few other children. The two children left the place in disgrace, and not far away they ran into Murong Danling.\n“Aunt.”\nShe was kind to the children and gave each of them a piece of candy. “Why did you come back so soon?”\n“Don’t mention it. Shen Hui’s stepmother moved the TV to the back room outside, and now outsiders can’t enter his yard at all. We went in yesterday when there was a power outage, but we didn’t see anything and were scared half to death by her. Today, Shen Hui didn’t let us watch TV at his house, and we were kicked out when we went in. Oh, Shen Hui just had dysentery, and he’s recovered after the infusion.”\nAs she was talking, her sister Murong Danfeng came over. “I say, what do you want to do?”\n“I want to make money. I must make them regret what they did to me.”\n“Ling, listen to my advice and stop fighting with them. That bastard broke up with you when he saw that you didn’t get the money. Now I see that Fang Zhongcheng is quite attentive to you. He is a college student with a stable job and his conditions are not bad.”\n“I know. I just want to see how Li Xia makes money. I want to make money, too. I want to make that father and son regret it to death.”\nShe wanted to make money, but she had no capital. She didn’t have the skills to sell snacks, and she couldn’t stand the hardship. She wanted to copy Li Xia’s model, but found that she couldn’t do it.\nAfter a moment of depression, she quickly decided to take another path. With her looks, even without Shen Haiyang’s inheritance, she can still find potential stocks. She can become an official’s wife in the future.\nThey’ll just set up a stall and wait until Li Xia loses all her money, and then they’ll see if this family will still be so arrogant.\n————\nThe days were getting colder. During the National Day holiday, Li Xia was busy making money, while Shen Haiyang took his three children to visit a cultural compound a hundred kilometers away.\n“Wife, you really aren’t coming?”\n“Mom, please come with us.” Huihua went over and took her arm and acted coquettishly.\n“Mom, let’s go together.” Yi Yi came over and held her other arm.\n“Mom,lets go.” Shen Hui, standing aside, also echoed.\nWhen packing at night, her family asked again, Li Xia felt a little sorry, but shook her head and refused. “During the National Day holiday, there will definitely be a lot of people, I have to take the opportunity to ship more goods.”\n“Forget it, don’t embarrass Mom.”\nShen Haiyang spoke to help her out. He stretched out his hand and beckoned, and Yiyi quickly ran to his side. He picked up the child and sat him on his left leg. Shen Hui looked at him silently, and he stretched out his hand to beckon the child to come over. Shen Hui looked at Huihua and saw that she was still clinging to her mother. He no longer felt awkward and ran to his father and leaned against him gently on the other side.\n“Be good, Daddy will take you out to play. You can think about it now, what do you want to buy and what do you want to play with when you go out.”\n“I want to see the plane.”\nYiyi raised his hand first. Seeing an airplane up close is the child’s recent dream. He is very curious about what an airplane looks like and how it can take people to the sky.\nThe two older ones said nothing, just looked at their younger brother and laughed at him. The children didn’t have any specific goals, they just felt very good to be able to go out with their dad during the holidays.\nWhen they were about to leave the next day, everyone realized that Li Xia was going with them. Everyone cheered happily. Although their mother was only going with them for two days, it was happy to be together as a family.\nLi Xia boiled eggs and made some pancakes for them early in the morning, and packed several bags of instant noodles that everyone loved. When the family went to the train station, Shen Haiyang asked her quietly why she changed her mind.\n“Don’t trust me?”\nLi Xia nodded: “Yes.” Then she smiled at him: “Xiao Liu’s sister is on holiday during the National Day holiday, and she said she would help out for a few days when she comes. If I can spare the time, of course I will join you. Otherwise, you will have to take care of these three little kids on the road by yourself, and I’m really afraid that they won’t listen.”\nHuihua turned around after hearing this and said, “Mom, you worry too much. My brother and I are obedient and we will take care of dad. Only Yiyi is a little fool, we can take care of him if we split up.”\nAfter hearing his sister call him a little fool, Yi Yi immediately quit. “I’m not a fool.”\nLi Xia reached out and touched her son’s head: “Be good, follow me closely on the road, don’t  run around by yourself. If you get lost, you’ll never see your mother again.”\n“I know. I will follow mother closely.”\n“Well, if you’re obedient, mom will give you a reward and take you out to eat delicious food.”\n“Oh yeah, I’ll be good.”\nThe family of five went out on October 1st, and the children didn’t really need many people to take care of them. Even the two older ones would often pay attention to Shen Haiyang, which made him, as a father, both funny and heartwarming.\n“Play by yourself, no need to pay attention to dad.”\n“You two look after your brother, and I’ll take care of your dad.”\nShen Hui nodded, and either held Yiyi’s hand or kept his eyes on him. This child was stubborn but attentive, and now he treated Yiyi as his own brother. Ever since this brat had gone off on his own twice, he and Huahua would pay special attention to his brother when they were outside.\nThe green mountains and clear waters made the mind relaxed and happy. The children played until their foreheads were full of sweat, and their eyes were bright and excited. Li Xia also felt open-minded and temporarily put all her worries behind her.\n“This is what life is. What I did in my previous life was just living.”\n“What are you mumbling about again?”\nLi Xia smiled and looked up at the blue sky and white clouds. “I think making money and having fun when you have time is what makes life interesting.”\n“If you like it, we should come out at least twice a year. When we are more open-minded, we can take the children abroad to broaden their horizons.”\n“I can also learn a lot.”\nShen Haiyang smiled and said, “Me too.”\nThe family had fun outside for two days. After returning home, they learned a shocking news from Xiao Liu – Murong Danling and Fang Zhongcheng were married.\n“They came after you two left, saying they were here to see the kids after getting married.” Xiao Liu sneered, “Really? Fish find fish, shrimp find shrimp, and toad finds a big frog. These two actually got together, and I don’t know if they can get along.”\nLi Xia was stunned and didn’t know how to react. She continued, “Actually, this is a good idea. If needed in the future, we can just let them help take care of the three children.”\nLi Xia smiled and nodded: “That’s right.”\nRely on those two to look after the child? Humph, she might as well rely on the neighbors. When they divorced, Fang Zhongcheng didn’t want to take care of the child, so he transferred Yi Yi to her when he found an opportunity. And Murong Danling, who divorced and left without taking her son. At that time, she didn’t even consider that Shen Haiyang was a vegetative and the child’s grandmother was so old.\nCould these two really get married? With this in mind, she made some inquiries and found out that they really did get married. They got the marriage certificate and set up two tables in the cafeteria on October 3rd as a ceremony.\nWell, since they are married, they should live their own lives. I hope these two don’t do anything weird.\nBeing in such a strange relationship, Li Xia sincerely hopes that the two can be fine, stop causing any trouble, and live their own lives.\nXu Xifeng talked about it here at night, and suddenly guessed something else. “They came to look for kids, they probably didn’t want to get the child back, right?”\nAs soon as she said this, the three people on the ground were immediately alarmed. Whether it was Fang Zhongcheng or Murong Danling, they gave the children a bad impression. When the three heard that they were going to follow them, they immediately felt unwell. Yiyi was the youngest and took the lead in hugging Shen Haiyang’s thighs tightly.\n“I don’t want to follow him. I don’t want to follow him. I want to follow this dad.”\nBrat, in your eyes, your mother is not as reliable as Shen Haiyang, right? Li Xia was so helpless with her son that she wanted to laugh. This kid has been shrewd since he was a child. He knew that if he clung to Shen Haiyang’s thigh, he would not embarrass her as a mother.\nHuihua, who was standing by, looked at her brother with envy and amusement. If she were a boy, she would have also gone to hug his thigh. But because she was a girl, she estimated that Fang Zhongcheng would definitely not want her.\nShen Hui rolled his eyes at his younger brother and went over to grab his father’s arm. The eldest son said nothing, but stared at him with burning eyes, which meant the same thing as Fang Ruyi had said.\nHe was unwilling to follow Murong Danling, even though she was his biological mother and he had longed for her. But now he was already disappointed with her, not to mention that she was married to Fang Zhongcheng. That man didn’t even raise his own children, so how could he raise someone else’s children?\nHe was extremely disappointed with Murong Danling, and Murong Danling had given up on him as well. The brat dared to cut her with a knife in a hurry. After raising him, she would be an ungrateful person. Xu Xifeng was just overthinking. Li Xia and Shen Haiyang knew the two of them very well and knew that they definitely did not come for this purpose.\nShen Haiyang held one child in each hand, and the two children sat next to him obediently and refused to be held by their father. “Don’t worry, they may just come here to show off that they are married.”\nLi Xia also said: “I guess they might have another child, and none of you three would be wanted.”\n“Oh yeahh.”\nFang Ruyi took advantage of his young age and did things that his older brother and sister didn’t dare to do. He stood up and quickly kissed Shen Haiyang, and his behavior was like a spoiled dog. The two older ones were extremely envious and jealous. Shen Hui raised his foot to chase him, and the little guy turned around and ran quickly.\n“Brother, brother, if you want it, I will kiss you too.”\n“I don’t want it, it’s all saliva.”\n“Hahaha……”\nLi Xia shook her head and laughed, unpacking the suitcases and sorting out the luggage they brought back. She took out all the clothes for washing, and also washed and hung towels, toothbrushes, etc.\nShen Haiyang wanted to help her but she refused and poured him some water and asked him to sit aside. “Are you feeling unwell?”\n“No. The doctor said that my illness may be cured in the next ten or eight years, so don’t worry too much.”\n“Wait for your father to come back and then ask him to help inquire abroad. If the disease can be cured, we will try to go abroad for treatment. I will take advantage of this period to earn more money and make preparations.”\n“sorry.”\n“Aren’t couples supposed to support each other? It’s so awkward to tell your wife this.”\nLi Xia knew what he meant and gave him a glare, saying nothing. The couple looked at each other and said nothing more, but all they had to say was clear.\nShe poured water to wash clothes, and the children in the yard laughed and talked happily. Seeing that Dad had gone to the toilet and Mom was left alone, the three of them played around for a while and then ran to help wash clothes. Li Xia wiped her hands on her apron and went to cook.\nPeeled water chestnuts, added tomatoes and spinach to make stew, and each person had an egg. Added a small amount of sorghum flour to the white flour to make noodles. In later generations, she watched health programs saying that eating some coarse grains in moderation is good for the body. Although people nowadays prefer refined rice and flour, she always adds some coarse grains.\nWater was boiling in the pot, and she was rolling noodles. Shen Haiyang went into the kitchen to wash his hands and help. He had just gone out to the bathroom and met a friend, and then learned a new piece of news.\n“Adult men or women who have a registered permanent residence at work can transfer their spouse and children’s permanent residence here. The time is from October this year to April next year.”\nLi Xia had heard of this situation in her previous life. Before the 1980s, many men worked outside the country with their registered permanent residence. In the 1980s, there was a family-based rural-to-urban transition. Only spouses and unmarried children were allowed to transfer.\n“When will the process begin?”\n“It has already begun.”\n“I’m going to find Fang Zhongcheng.”\nYiyi’s registered permanent residence is still in the countryside, and now she has to pay tuition fees to attend kindergarten. If her registered permanent residence is not transferred, it will be difficult to go to primary school in the future, and there will be restrictions in all aspects. If she can’t find a connection, it may be difficult to enroll in school, and further studies will be a hurdle. It is better to have a registered permanent residence.\n“Wife, you…”\n“I’ll find him first.” Li Xia said and left in a hurry.\nShen Haiyang had some guesses about Fang Zhongcheng, and he estimated that this trip would most likely fail. He believed that his wife should be able to guess it. He was a little confused as to why his wife didn’t tell him directly.\nHe and Li Xia cannot have another child, but Yi Yi has a household registration, so according to the policy, it is possible to transfer the child from rural to non-rural. If Fang Zhongcheng remarries, the two will definitely want to have another child. If Fang Zhongcheng transfers Yi Yi to their household registration, he will not be able to get a birth permit for his child. Will he and Murong Danling be happy with this?\nDue to time constraints, she was told that Fang Zhongcheng had already left work when she arrived at the company. She had no choice but to ride her bike to the tube-shaped building where he lived, but he was not there either. The neighbors in the building said that he had moved and had just moved into a new building yesterday.\n\n\n!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!\nI have completed the translation of this novel.

If you want to read all the chapters at once you can purchase them on my Ko-fi shop(as some of my readers were asking if i had advance chapter thing). Those who want to read it all at once can buy them.\nPlease Read more about it at the bottom.\n\n\nAfter finding out the address, she went to the man’s house again. It was Murong Danling who opened the door to the middle room on the third floor. The woman frowned as soon as she saw her.\n“What are you doing here?”\n“I’m looking for Fang Zhongcheng, ask him to come out.”\n“Li Xia, you are both divorced, right?”\n“I have something to ask him.”\n“Who’s looking for me?”\nFang Zhongcheng from the house\nWhen he came out, he was stunned for a moment when he saw her, and then his eyes were clear. He made way for her to enter the house, but Li Xia chose to talk at the door. After a few words, a neighbor opened the door and started to eat melons.\nLi Xia spoke frankly about the purpose of her visit. “Can you move Yi Yi’s household registration here?”\nFang Zhongcheng looked embarrassed: “There is a policy now, but I…”\n“Why, no, are you still planning to have another child?”\nFang Zhongcheng’s face turned pale at her contemptuous tone, and he didn’t know how to respond for a moment. Murong Danling on the side sneered and didn’t care at all, not feeling embarrassed at all.\n“Of course we have to have a child of our own after we get married. Your son has already followed you, how can you have the nerve to ask him to transfer the child’s household registration?”\nLi Xia sneered and turned to look at Fang Zhongcheng. “You said you are the child’s biological father, what do you mean?”\n“I…” Fang Zhongcheng sighed again in embarrassment, “Family planning is very strict nowadays, otherwise I would definitely transfer the child.”\n“So do you want this child or not? If you still recognize him as your son, then you can give him the household registration. Otherwise, what you are doing is the same as not wanting this child.”\n“I……”\n“Forget it, don’t regret it later if you don’t want it.”\nAt this point, Li Xia understood. You gave up your child so completely, Fang Zhongcheng, I hope you won’t regret it in the future. Even if you regret it, I won’t give you a chance. This is what you said yourself, and so many people heard it.\nShe turned around and went out, going downstairs. Upstairs, Fang Zhongcheng’s face was livid, and Murong Danling was comforting him softly.\nLi Xia didn’t pay attention to the movement behind her. She looked at the direction of the second floor and fiercely gave Fang Zhongcheng a middle finger. Bastard, why did I like you in the first place? She found a bear father like him for her two children. He has been a hands-off boss and has done nothing for the children since they were born.\nShe rode her bike home quickly, went straight into the main room, looked at Shen Haiyang, and hesitated to speak. Just as she was about to speak, Shen Haiyang spoke first.\n“Transfer Yi Yi to my household registration.”\nShe suddenly breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at him with embarrassment. “You are almost as bad as the worms in my stomach.” In fact, he had planned to do so. Li Xia had a household registration but no work unit, so she did not meet the requirements.\nAfter that, she asked cautiously, “Is this feasible?”\n“It’s feasible. This time it’s nationwide and in large quantities, and the inspection is not strict. Some people claim that their nephews are sons and have changed their rural status to non-rural status. This is a transfer of household registration, not a registration. As long as the child originally has a household registration, proving the relationship with me, and the child is unmarried, there will be no problem. Several old comrades in our unit have transferred their wives and children here.”\n“Then, if they are found to be stepfather and son, that would be fine, right?”\n“You could have said it at the beginning. There’s no need to hide it. My stepson can transfer from rural to non-rural with me.”\n“Thanks.”\n“Don’t tell me that.” The man still looked calm. After finishing his business, he picked up the book and continued reading. “Hurry up and have dinner. Come with me to the company tomorrow to get a certificate, and go to the police station to get the household registration transfer procedures. Then you can go home to handle the procedures.”\n“good.”\nAfter Li Xia finished speaking, she stood there, hesitating to speak. Shen Haiyang looked at her with doubt in his eyes. The child’s household registration can be transferred, and his future education will not be a problem. What are you still worrying about?\n“wife”\nHe asked softly, and Li Xia looked up and said, “Just say that this child is your biological child, and this time change the surname to Shen, is that ok?”\nShe didn’t care what the child’s surname was. In her heart, the child was her own flesh and blood no matter what his surname was. But Fang Zhongcheng, that bastard, gave up on the child so completely that she couldn’t help but change her son’s surname. She wanted him to feel what it felt like to have a child who called Shen Haiyang dad and took Shen Haiyang’s surname, and was no longer his child.\nThis is against the rules, Shen Haiyang knows it very well. Fang Zhongcheng can take legal action after knowing it, and there are traces to follow. But he also understands his wife’s thoughts, and this is the only chance to change Yi Yi’s surname.\n“It is feasible. But if Fang Zhongcheng is not happy after knowing it, we will lose the case through legal means. If he disagrees with Yi Yi’s surname change to Shen, it will be illegal.”\n“Can’t the child take the stepfather’s surname?” Why should the law protect the rights of such a biological father? He just shirks responsibility and doesn’t care about anything. What a shitty biological father. ”\n“If it’s a newborn or soon-to-be-born baby, then it can be registered with the mother’s or stepfather’s surname. But Yi Yi already has a household registration, so Fang Zhongcheng must agree to change his surname. You know he won’t agree, so you want to take this opportunity to transfer Yi Yi to my biological son, so that the surname can be changed naturally. Am I understanding correctly?”\nLi Xia nodded silently, looking at him a little embarrassed. “If I do this, will it affect your work?”\n“No. I’m already in the second line, and such a small personal matter will not affect my work. But the company needs a marriage certificate or a marriage and birth certificate from the place of residence to issue a certificate. The difference between the time on our marriage certificate and Yi Yi’s age will give us away. So we have to lie and say that the father of the child agreed. Nowadays, the inspection is not strict, and this is not included in the requirements. Maybe we can get away with it.”\nShe knew that she changed Huihua’s surname to Fang Zhongcheng, but he didn’t object. Now that she changed Yiyi’s surname, he would definitely not be happy. But Li Xia wanted to change the child’s surname, she didn’t want her son to continue to have the surname Fang. He wanted the child to not take up his birth quota but still have the surname Fang and be his son, which was not so easy.\n“Fang Zhongcheng…did he give you child support during this period?”\n“No.”\n“Find a way to let others know about this and use it as evidence in court. He is irresponsible and does not fulfill his obligations. He will be at a disadvantage in terms of both the surname issue and custody. If they have another child, I don’t think Fang Zhongcheng will sue. But it is better to be prepared than not. Be fully prepared.”\n“Okay.” She smiled at him, feeling overwhelmed with joy, and held his arm. He could understand her intentions as soon as she opened her mouth, and he chose to take advantage of the loophole without hesitation to help her achieve her intentions.\n“Sometimes I think I don’t need to bother with him. I am very happy now. But he pushes the child out again and again, and I am still very angry.”\nShen Haiyang patted her on the shoulder and said, “I know. Humans are emotional animals. He is the biological father of the child. How could he not care at all? I feel the same way about Murong. I can’t help but tremble with anger when I think about how she would treat Huihui, even though I haven’t seen it with my own eyes. How could he treat his beloved child like this?”\n“Yes, I am just angry about this. It is my bad luck that he abandoned me. I am blind. But for the attitude towards the children, I am angry. I feel sorry for the children.”\n“Okay, don’t be angry. The children have us now.”\n“Yeah. The three of them get along well, which really makes me happy.”\n“We are a happy family.”\nThe couple smiled at each other. She knew that doing so might cause trouble. Fang Zhongcheng might appeal and ask for the surname to be changed back, but she couldn’t bear it. Even if it was troublesome or she had to resort to some tricks, she didn’t want the child to continue to have the surname Fang. He didn’t deserve it.\nChanging the child’s surname to Li or Shen behind Fang Zhongcheng’s back doesn’t make much difference. If Fang Zhongcheng disagrees, he can apply to change it back. In this case, then change the surname to Shen. After all, the child takes the mother’s surname, and the man’s bad nature still thinks that this is his child, but if the child takes the stepfather’s surname, he will be as angry as if his property was taken away.\nBe angry, I wish you would die of anger. If you don’t agree to have a child today, you will regret it later and see how you can justify yourself.\n“Will this really not affect your work?”\n“No. If Fang Zhongcheng doesn’t admit it in the future, we can say that he went back on his word. He can’t explain this matter even if he has three mouths.”\nBecause they know how to exploit loopholes, Fang Zhongcheng will most likely have to accept the loss. He can only be angry after being cheated and appeal to the law. Even if the child changes his surname to Li, he will never be named Fang again.\nThe unit issued a certificate, and the large-scale transfer of rural to non-rural was indeed not strictly checked as Shen Haiyang said. They said that the child’s father agreed to change the surname. Facing the clerk’s eyes, Li Xia spoke to add weight.\n“They want to have another child, but he doesn’t want this one.” She said this in front of Fang Zhongcheng’s house so that others could hear her. She had witnesses.\nThis kind of thing happens a lot nowadays. It is not uncommon for people to remarry and have children but not be able to have more children, and want to start a new life without having previous children.\n“Then we’ll open Shen Ruyi, and Fang Ruyi is his former name.”\nThe unit issued a certificate.\nThe police station issued a permit for relocation. She went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy some candies, biscuits, etc. She originally wanted to go back by herself, but she couldn’t leave now because of her business.\nShe could only write to my father and ask him to help her. After receiving the letter and the things, the old man immediately asked the brigade to stamp it. There was a permit for relocation from the city, and the brigade stamped it very quickly. He took the stamped permit home to show to his wife Old Lady Li.\n“Yi Yi’s household registration is also going to be moved?”\n“That’s great! Now those mother and children, will all be city people from now on.”\nShe married an educated youth from the city, and now the mother and her two children have all moved to the city. The old lady was so happy holding her cotton-padded jacket that she could not stop smiling, and finally put her mind at ease about her daughter. With a house and a household registration, she has completely established a foothold in the city. When she went home in the evening, she whispered to the old man about it, and the topic came up.\n“Since this new son-in-law has the surname Shen, does Fang Zhongcheng want neither of his two children?”\n“He’s a bastard. Luckily my daughter met her now husband, otherwise she would have been screwed over by him in her life.”\n“Thank goodness, thank goodness.”\nThe brigade stamped the official seal on the relocation permit, and the old man immediately mailed it to Li Xia. Shen Haiyang went to settle the child’s household registration first, and Li Xia asked him to change Huihua’s surname to Shen as well. A family of three children, changing their surnames to the same one would be more conducive to unity.\n\n\n\n!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!\nI have completed the translation of this novel.

    "47": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c31/\nCHAPTER 31\nAfter the household registration was moved, she lived her life as usual. One day, she was cooking dinner in the kitchen when a strange yet familiar man appeared in front of the windowâShen Haiyangâs brother. She was curious about what this man was doing, so she left the kitchen before she finished rolling the noodles.\nâHello, Iâm sorry to come to your house again.â\nThe man was dressed in a suit and had slicked-back hair. He stood in the cozy courtyard and was very polite. His attitude was much better than it was last time. As the host, Shen Haiyang raised his hand to offer his seat, and the other person sat down on the chair opposite him.\nâYou must be here for something, right?â\nShen Haiyang looked calm, sitting in a rocking chair and drinking milk leisurely. He should have been drinking tea, but he had a heart disease and couldnât drink tea, so he had already given it up and switched to milk. The two brothers were talking, and Li Xia saw that the other party was quite polite, so she went into the house and poured him tea. Thinking of what his wife said last time, she thought that if he said the same thing, she would throw it in his face.\nâThanks.â\nWell, this time the courtesy was in place. Since they seemed to be harmonious on the surface, she would not care and let the two brothers talk on their own. Whether this person was sincere or had changed his strategy, Shen Haiyang was sure that he could handle it.\nâI should call you brother now. I was too abrupt last time. I apologize.â\nShen Haiyang waved his hand: âItâs okay. Just say whatever you want to say. Itâs okay.â\nâDo you know how our father survived overseas?â After saying that, seeing that Shen Haiyang didnât respond, he continued with a smile.\nâHe almost died when the railway was laying tracks. Later, he met my mother and recovered under her careful care. He started by delivering newspapers and then got involved in sales, and step by step, he got to where he is today. My mother followed him everywhere and was always by his side whenever he encountered a crisis. Now his health is getting worse, and the domestic environment is not good in all aspects.â\nâPlease speak frankly if you want to say anything.â Itâs just one-sided. I donât know how credible your words are. You donât have to tell me about your motherâs achievements.\nWith just one simple sentence, the manâs faint smile almost disappeared. âI mean, it has not been easy for father over the years. He is in poor health now, and it is not suitable for him to return to this backward place to retire. As a son, you should think about your father.â\nShen Haiyang was still calm and collected, and he got to the point as soon as he spoke: âWhy didnât you tell Father directly? And your motherâs contributionâdid she ask you to question me? She thinks I am not worthy of my fatherâs gift; do you want it back, or what do you mean?â\nThe man was silent for a moment and even blushed. His parents had divorced long ago, and their property had been divided. Strictly speaking, his fatherâs life had nothing to do with his mother.\nIt makes sense, but how can he be willing to accept it? If the old man really returns to the mainland and develops feelings for Shen Haiyang over time, coupled with the guilt he has felt for him over the years, if he leaves all his inheritance to him, wouldnât he be at a huge loss?\nâI say this just to let you know that it was us who stayed by our fatherâs side all these years, and it was also us who endured the hardships with him.â\nShen Haiyang still said the same thing: âYou should go and tell the old man about these things.â\nThe initiative is obviously in the hands of the old man. You canât control him, so you come to control us? You are picking on the weak. You know how to judge people by their appearance.\nâYouâ¦â The man frowned and was very angry. Something happened that was beyond his expectations. He couldnât argue and started to get angry.\nâPoor mountains and bad waters produce unruly people. It seems that the old Chinese saying is true. I tried to reason with you, but you didnât understand. It seems that I was just talking to a cow this time.â\nâYouâ¦â Li Xiaâs temper suddenly flared up, and just as she was about to speak, Shen Haiyang retorted back.\nâThe law stipulates that all children have equal inheritance rights. You want to take all of my fatherâs property, but you say we are unruly people. Then may I ask, What is the point of your monopolizing behavior?â\nThe manâs face turned red, and he was speechless. Shen Haiyang had been calm and composed from beginning to end. You came here to find fault in a new way. How long can you keep up the good work?\nâEverything I do is from my fatherâs perspective. The mainland is too backward and really not suitable for him to live on in his old age.â\nAfter being criticized, he put on his mask again. Shen Haiyang was not moved by any soft or hard words. Every word he spoke hit the nail on the head: âYou should tell this to the old man. He is the one who makes the decision.â\nShen Yaozong was really helpless. He didnât expect this half-brother to be so difficult to deal with. He returned empty-handed, and when he left, he was thinking about how to explain it to his father.\nAfter he left, Li Xia whispered to her husband, âItâs the common property of the couple. If Shen Yaozongâs mother is not willing to give it, then do we have to return the old manâs money? It doesnât seem right. You have the right of inheritance.â\nShen Haiyang explained to her, âI have the right to inherit the old manâs property. Donât worry about it. Judging from the situation, the old man has a lot of property, and Shen Yaozong is not here to ask for money. He is afraid that the old man will live with us, and we will be the first to get the moon. From this point of view, the old man should have a lot of property.â\nâOh, Iâm just calculating our cash flow and how much we need to solve any problems if they arise.â\nâDonât worry, just go about your business.â\nLi Xia went into the house to cook, and Shen Haiyang finished drinking milk and got up to go into the house to help. His attitude towards his father depends on his mother. Since his mother has let it go, it doesnât matter to him as a son. Although he has no feelings for his biological father, since they have contacted each other, they can get along naturally.\nHe didnât know his wife was pregnant, so he traveled across the ocean. Ignorance is not a crime, and his mother also said that his decision was not wrong. Shen Yaozong said that his mother accompanied him through hardships, so everything he has should be his. What about his original wife? Isnât it hard for her to raise the child and take care of the family alone?\nHe didnât care about the old manâs property, but that didnât mean he agreed with Shen Yaozongâs words. If the old man didnât give him a cent, he wouldnât fight for it. If the old man wanted to give it to him, then he would be justified both morally and legally, and it wouldnât be Shen Yaozongâs turn to say whether he deserved it or not.\nLi Xia had seen a lot of this kind of property dispute on TV, whether it was a TV series or a legal program, but she never thought it would happen to her one day. She smiled, shook her head, and went into the house to cook. For a moment, she felt that life was really like a drama.\nShe didnât know how much money the old man has, which makes him so anxious.\nOther peopleâs wealth is just an illusion; earning money yourself is real. Li Xia thought about it and made her own money. An old customer introduced a new customer to her, and she placed two wholesale orders the next day.\nThe goods are getting less and less, and the funds are getting more and more. At night, she sorted the cash according to the denominations and put the piles of money neatly into the small box. Seeing them, she feels more at ease.\nSuddenly, she heard someone talking outside, so she quickly closed her cash box. She stood up and pushed the door open. It was indeed Han Jun, Shen Haiyangâs old classmate. Shen Haiyang poured him some water, and the two sat down on the sofa in the living room.\nThe two of them had already exchanged greetings when they entered the room. Han Jun smiled and stood up when he saw her. âSister-in-law,\nâSit down.â Li Xia smiled and greeted them. After chatting for a while, she stood up and said, âYou two can chat. Iâll go see if the monkeys have finished watching TV. And let them go to bed early.â\nSeeing that she was about to leave, Han Jun stood up quickly. He seemed to be in a dilemma, as he hesitated to speak, and Shen Haiyang patted him and rolled his eyes at him.\nâWe are all brothers. Just say whatever you want to say. Your sister-in-law is not an outsider.â\nHan Jun smiled bitterly and touched the back of his head, then he spoke with determination, âI came here to borrow money. My motherâs condition worsened, and sheâs in the hospital, and Iâm short of money.â\nI see; no wonder he was having a hard time speaking. His mother was paralyzed in bed all year round, and he was the only one who could support the family, so the economy must be tight. A seven-foot-tall man asking for money was really a tough ask.\nâHow much?â\nShen Haiyang and his wife spoke together. This straightforward attitude made Han Jun feel better. He raised a finger. Li Xia immediately took over.\nâOne thousand? Wait, Iâll go get it for you.â\nâNo, no, one hundred.â\nHow much is the monthly salary? You asked for a thousand yuan right away. Han Jun quickly corrected himself, and was shocked by Li Xiaâs generosity. Was this because the old classmate had some US dollars left after buying the house, or did she make a lot of money from her business?\nTen big notes are already so hot in his hand. His family is a typical moonlighter, and sometimes they are even in debt. How long will it take to pay off the debt with their salary?\nHan Jun only wanted to borrow 100 yuan from them. Shen Haiyang looked at his wife and laughed helplessly. Li Xia also realized that she had done something wrong.\nIt was an inappropriate thing, but fortunately, the other party was her husbandâs best friend. Moreover, since coming to the city, Han Jun has helped her with everything. Han Jun knew how much money Shen Haiyangâs father had sent her, so she was not very wary of him.\nâDonât show off your wealth. Iâve been foolish today.â\nThe other party was Han Jun. Shen Haiyang smiled and said nothing. He trusted his childhood friend. âHow much did you have?â\nâEighty thousand.â\nAs expected, the only thing that can make people arrogant is wealth. With 80,000 yuan in cash at home, it is no wonder that they would think a finger is only 1,000 yuan.\nâItâs okay; Han Jun is not a quick-talker.â\nâIâll be more careful next time.â Putting aside the matter of borrowing money, she remembered that he seemed to come back a little late these days and immediately asked, âWhat have you been busy with these days? Is it about the house?â\nShen Haiyang nodded. âThere are no properties for sale in the whole yard at the moment, but there are several individual households. So I am negotiating with several families in the backyard to exchange. If successful, I will renovate the backyard, open up the alley, and turn it into a small gate, as you said, so that there will be someone to take care of it.â\nâExchange?Â  You mean you buy out those retail investors and then exchange houses with those people in the backyard?â\nâright.â\nâWill they agree to that? The location here is very good.â\nâItâs a question of price. I believe as long as the money is in place, changing the location is not a problem.â\nLi Xia nodded and agreed with him. If you can get a house and earn some money at the same time, I believe many people will do this deal. It just depends on the conditions of each family, and you can give more to those with better conditions.\nâHow did the talk go?â\nâThe east and west rooms have already been negotiated, and they will move in at the end of the month. The wife of the main room is not very happy about this. I guess she thinks the house is not good enough. I will look for another one.â\nThe house in the backyard is similar to theirs. It was originally a large courtyard. There is one entrance here and two entrances in the back. It was originally the place where the women of the family lived. However, the backyard is full of people living in a mess, and the main house has also been damaged by the private construction in the yard, affecting the overall beauty. When we buy it, we have to demolish it first and then renovate it.\nâDo you think the old man can get used to it when he comes back? He is sick, and the medical conditions on the mainland are not as good as those abroad. Will he stay for a few days before leaving?â\nâThatâs his business. Weâll help him find a house, and he can stay as long as he wants.â\nâWell, donât worry; take your time to look for it.â\nKnowing that she was worried about his health, Shen Haiyang nodded with a smile. She went out to tell the children to go to bed, and after opening the door, she found that Yiyi and Shen Hui were actually snorting at each other, ignoring each other.\nShe looked at her daughter silently, shook her head helplessly, and said nothing, pulling her to her bedroom in the west wing. As a result, Yiyi followed behind her, Shen Hui turned around and ignored everyone, and quickly returned to the east wing.\nLi Xia couldnât help but ask after entering the room, âWhatâs going on?â\nHuihua sighed again. The little girl had bright eyes, white teeth, and delicate skin. She looked at her mother with her big eyes and blinked playfully. Just as she was about to explain the two to her mother, Yiyi climbed onto his motherâs lap and sat down to speak for himself.\nâMy brother is a stingy person. We argued about watching different TVs, so he said he wouldnât let me sleep in the west room.â\nLi Xia looked back at her daughter, and Huihua nodded at her obediently. âRecently, Yiyi has been fighting with his brother for the TV, and his brother seems to hate him. How about letting Yiyi live with me in the west room?â\nÂ \n\n\nT/N:- I have posted ADVANCE Chapters (completed) of this novel on my Ko-fi page you can visit here. https://ko-fi.com/s/469b5da95e\n",
    "48": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c31-2/\nAt the beginning, they were arranged in the east wing because they were both boys and they wanted to foster their relationship. What should we do in this situation now? What is wrong with Shen Hui?\nIf the children of a reconstituted family are deliberately separated, wouldnât that create division in the family? If three children are divided into two groups and cannot get along as a family when they are young, how can they get along in the future?\nâYou and your brother were fighting over the TV station. Who won in the end?â\nYiyi puffed out his chest and said, âI won. My mother bought the TV, so of course he has to listen to me. Mom, he doesnât let me go back to the east room, so I will stay in the west room with my sister. Humph, I donât care.â\nâYou stinky boy, no wonder your brother doesnât want you anymore.â\nLi Xia habitually raised her hand, and then softened the force when she touched her sonâs butt. She hadnât played with the children for a long time, so his reactions were slow. Yiyi found that he had been beaten, and although it didnât hurt, he realized that his mother is angry and things are getting serious.\nâMother,â\nRealizing that he had done something wrong, the little guy looked at his mother timidly. Huihua saw that her motherâs face was gloomy, and she also felt that what her brother said was inappropriate and had already taught him a lesson. But seeing her brother being beaten, she couldnât help but plead for him.\nâYiyi didnât mean it. Heâs just too young to speak.â\nYiyi also quickly admitted his mistake: âI was wrong; I wonât do it again next time.â\nâWhat you wonât do?â\nâI wonât fight with my brother for the TV anymore.â\nâIs it a matter of grabbing the TV now?â\nThis time, the little guy was confused. What was the problem, if not the TV? He said he would not fight with his brother for the TV, so why was his mother still angry? He was obviously very aggrieved. Maybe he would never be able to see his favorite Coca-Cola in the future.\nLi Xia sighed helplessly at her son. The brat would always find trouble. If he were as well behaved as Huihua, she would have no more worries. Forget it. Forget it. Children are not exactly alike. This kid is smart. Correct guidance is the most important thing.\nâWho picks you up and drops you off at kindergarten every day?â\nâDad.Â  He made a child seat for me, so I can ride the bike more steadily. He also bought me soda on the way.â\nBefore the little guy finished speaking, he quickly covered his mouth. Dad said he couldnât tell mom about buying soda. Coca-Cola is such a delicious drink, but mom said itâs not good for children to drink, so she wouldnât buy it for them. Dad bought it for them secretly.\nLi Xia didnât have time to settle accounts with Shen Haiyang, and she wanted to deal with the brat first. âWhose father is your father? Whose fatherâs love did you enjoy originally?â\nâMy brotherâs.â\nâWe are a family. Mom and Dad are both your parents. You two have a new dad who loves you, so why do you want to monopolize the TV that mom bought? Donât you think Mom is not your brotherâs mother? Then do we have to move out of Dadâs house tomorrow because it belongs to Dad and your brother?â\nHer words were very clear, and not only Yiyi but also Huihua beside her finally realized why her mother was angry. In a reconstituted family, the sense of belonging of the children to the home is definitely different from that of the original one. Li Xia had deliberately ignored the house before because she didnât want the two children to feel like they were living under someone elseâs roof.\nBut now her son was spoiled, and Shen Hui, as the host, did not create division. When he was angry, he just said that he would not live in the same room with him but did not ask him to leave the yard.\nâI was wrong. I shouldnât have said that my mother bought the TV. My mother is also my brotherâs mother. I will go and apologize to my brother.â\nThe little guy turned very quickly, and he, who knows the times, is a hero. After saying that, he went out to the east wing, and Li Xia stood quietly in the yard, watching him do it himself.\nShe thought Shen Hui had closed the east wing, but it opened with a push. Li Xiaâs expression suddenly relaxed. Shen Hui was a kind child, or it was the result of such a long period of running. Although he had a quarrel with his brother, he did not lock him out.\nâBrother, brother, I was wrong; please donât be angry. I will never say that again.â\nThe brat went straight to Shen Huiâs bedroom in the north, calling him âbrotherâ all the time, and heard the conversation between the two of them. At first, Shen Hui ignored him, but after a while, he forgave his brother because of the boyâs sweet words and sincere apology.\nâThen you are not allowed to drink Coca-Cola anymore. Watch TV series with me.â\nââ¦â¦All right.â\nIt turned out that he was also a scheming person, and he didnât argue with his brother and finally achieved his goal. After a while, the two fell in love again.\nIn fact, in most families, it is very normal for siblings to quarrel, fight, and snatch things. Most parents will let the older one give in to the younger one or beat one of them up. Anyway, the only thing is to settle the dispute, and they donât care about anything else.\nOnly in their reconstituted family would Li Xia pay so much attention to the reasons why the children quarreled. After being beaten today, the brat realized that the family is a whole and cannot be divided. Dad and Mom are the parents of the three of them.\nShen Hui walked him to the south and turned on the light in his room. Li Xia turned and went into the main room. Shen Haiyang was leaning against the bed reading a book. When he saw her come in, he raised his eyebrows and asked silently. She took off her clothes and briefly explained the matter.\nâItâs just a child, donât worry too much.â\nShe lifted the quilt and crawled in, and suddenly felt that he also had a rough side. Or maybe he was strict with himself and lenient with others. This time, it was Shen Hui who was wronged. It would be better for her, his biological mother, to beat him up than for him to reason with her.\nâIt is because they are little that their words are the most hurtful. If we allow such thoughts to germinate and grow in their hearts, our family will be divided in their place.â\nâYouâre right. Iâll talk to Shen Hui tomorrow.â\nâNo need. This is Yiyiâs fault. It has nothing to do with Hui Hui. The child is a good kid. Even though he was bullied by his brother, he didnât say anything about sending him away.â\nâHe is the oldest, so he should act like an older brother.â\nâHow much older can they be? They are just children. We should treat them equally. We should deal with the matter, not the person. Whoever makes a mistake should bear the responsibility.â\nShen Haiyang smiled and put his arm around her. âI didnât expect you to understand children so well.â\nLi Xia smiled and said nothing. In her previous life, she had worked hard, but her children were separated from her. They all felt distressed and annoyed when they saw her. She would reflect on herself when she was alone. After her rebirth, her mind was open, and she could see many things more clearly.\nâWhat are you doing?â Li Xia pulled her vest off and looked at him with a smile.\nâWe are a couple; what do you think I am doing?â\nâYour bodyâ¦â\nâI am healthy.â\nSuch a gentle man would be gritting his teeth at this moment. It would be a loss of dignity for any man to be questioned by his wife in bed. Li Xia immediately smiled and kissed him on the face to calm her husbandâs resentment.\nâHow about I do?â\nâNo i will do it.â\nWhy do you like to take the initiative so much? You have to be in control of everything to feel safe. Shen Haiyang sometimes doesnât understand his wifeâs thoughts. But she is devoted to this family, to the children, and to him. If she likes to be in control, then she can be the boss. Itâs not a big deal.\nThough he thought so in his heart, he was willing to let his wife take charge of other things. But in bed, he still had to have the dignity of a man. Li Xia did not expose his thoughts, seeing that his body allowed it and he was in good spirits, so she cooperated obediently.\nThe next day, they each went about their own business. When Shen Haiyang was riding his bike to take Yiyi to school, Shen Hui stopped him. âDad, is Coca-Cola really that delicious? It looks like medicine, but Yiyi said itâs delicious.â\nâPersonally, I donât like it, but I let Yiyi drink it secretly once, and he liked it very much. Mom said itâs bad for the body. Why, do you want to try it too?â\nâYeah.â Although he had more pocket money than Shen Ruyi and could buy it himself, he still let his dad pay for it, so they could drink more often.\nâOkay, then the four of us will drink secretly outside today before going home.â\nBefore, he treated Huihua and Yiyi better; after all, he was not their biological father, so he had to deliberately get closer to them. Li Xia was the same with Shen Hui; she had to be more tolerant of them. Now, the four of them who had a good relationship with each other have done âbad thingsâ together behind the back of the mistress of the house.\nâOh yeah.â\nWhen Shen Hui turned around, Li Xia was there. He quickly said, âMom, we just drank it once.â\nâBrush your teeth at night after drinking it. That stuff corrodes your teeth.â\nâOkay.â\nIt is better to loosen than to block. Li Xia has understood this truth after living a new life. If a child is not satisfied in childhood, the desire in his heart will grow bigger and bigger. When he grows up, he will either make up for it by eating and drinking lavishly, or he will shrink back and feel that he is not worthy of it and dare not fight for what he wants.\nIn her previous life, her two children were timid and self-conscious. They dared not show their love for something and only hid it secretly. I remember that she bought a red woolen coat during the Chinese New Year, but she dared not wear it again after wearing it once because of a word from others. Yiyi used arrogance to cover himself up. If anyone dared to say anything to him, he would fight with them. In fact, to put it bluntly, he was still self-conscious and cared too much about others.\nShe really didnât think it tasted good because she had seen a health program on TV in her previous life and she really thought it was unhealthy, so she didnât buy it. But since the child liked it, then let him drink it.\nAfter setting up the stall in the morning, she saw someone delivering goods from the nearby store, so she immediately went to buy a few bottles. She gave one bottle to Xiao Liu, and when the children came to bring her lunch at noon, she gave one bottle to each of them.\nThe two children were very surprised and looked at her with silly smiles. âDrink it. If you like it, Iâll buy it for you every day. But remember to brush your teeth at night.â\nâThanks Mom.â\nLooking at her daughterâs cheerful smile, she felt that the sky was brighter. There was no more gloom in her daughterâs eyes, and she no longer looked depressed and fearful.\nâMom, donât you give it to Yiyi?â\nâDad will give it to you.â He will be worried that he will miss it by then. Who knows? Shen Ruyi may have pestered your dad to buy it for him on the way.â\nHuihua smiled and happily took a sip of Coke. The taste of carbonated drinks is a bit strange at first, but it makes people want to take another sip. Slowly, you fall in love with the taste. When you drink it into your mouth and swallow it into your stomach, it feels like nutrients, and a strong sense of happiness grows in your heart.\nThe child took the fresh drink to school, and she asked them to bring the bottle back in the evening. Nowadays, Coke is sold in glass bottles, which are recyclable.\nSeeing the children walk away, she sat down to eat slowly. In the afternoon, a customer who came to buy clothes mentioned that her neighbor was going to sell his house, so she quickly asked about the house.\nâOur house is pretty good, with three main rooms and two side rooms. Their son has settled down in the capital, so the old couple wants to sell the house and go live with their son in their old age.â\nâCan you take me there or give me an address?â\nâOkay. Iâll give you the address, and you can contact them yourself if you want.â\nShe closed her stall early in the evening and ran to the backyard to find the family in the main room. When she entered the house and explained her purpose, the other party was very impatient.\nâNo, no, weâve already said we wonât change this house. Whatâs wrong with you two? Why do you have to change to someone elseâs house?â\nâWe can exchange the same house for a new one, and we will even give you a subsidy. Why donât you agree to this, comrade? If the subsidy is not enough, we can discuss it again.â\nâSubsidy money?â The woman screamed in surprise and turned to question her mother-in-law and husband: âIs it true? Did you all know about it and only hide it from me?â\nAfter she finished speaking, seeing that the two of them didnât say anything, she immediately started to yell, âOkay, you and your family treat me as an outsider and make fun of me, right? I was wondering why everyone in the east and west rooms moved out happily. Who wouldnât be happy to move out when thereâs such a good thing? How much is the subsidy? You wonât take it all, right?â\nâNo, no, how could we be greedy? We havenât changed this house yet. I donât think the last house was good.â\nSince the matter had not been settled yet, the young wife glared at the man and turned back to greet Li Xia. After discussing the replacement conditions, she followed Li Xia to see the house.\nThe same main room, the same side room. The location was a little further away than the original one, but still within the school district. The two women discussed it again, and in the end, Li Xia gave the other party two sets of clothes in addition to compensation, and the deal was settled.\nâSo when can you move?â\nâI can move immediately after the house is sold.â\nâOkay, itâs settled.â\nWhen she got home that night, Shen Haiyang was cooking in the kitchen. She went in, washed her hands, put on an apron, and pushed him away. âWhat kind of house did you find last time? Can you settle the one on the back?â\nâWhy, have you found a suitable house for the family of the main hall?â\nâWell, we have already discussed it today. They will move in as soon as the house is transferred.â\nâOkay, then Iâll go talk to the family behind the house and try to vacate the house as soon as possible.â\nThe couple worked together to complete the house exchange within a few days. While they were moving in the backyard, Li Xia discussed the follow-up work with Shen Haiyang.\nâThe house needs to be repaired, and a lot of parts need to be demolished. We need to find a bricklayer, right? The weather is getting colder; where can we find help?â\nâHow about letting my dad bring my brother? Since my second brother canât walk well, let my dad bring my eldest and third brothers. The three grown men can at least dismantle everything that needs to be dismantled and prepare all the materials in one winter. Next spring, we will repaint the doors, windows, and walls, then put up the ceiling, tidy up the floor, prepare furniture, etc. What do you think?â\nâIt would be great if your family came over, but are they free at this time of year?â\nâYes. After the land reform, everyone will be responsible for their own profits and losses. The crops in the fields should be almost harvested this season. I wrote a letter asking them to finish the harvest as soon as possible and come to work.â\nâOkay. When they come, they will be paid according to the salary of the urban construction team, and meals will be provided, but neither of us has time, so they have to do it yourself. â\nâWeâre all family; thereâs no need to be so calculating, right?â\nâBrothers should settle accounts clearly. It is not good to let them suffer any loss.â\nLi Xia nodded and said nothing more. Each member of the construction team earns less than fifty yuan a month, and her father and his team wonât make much money after working for a few months. This is a good opportunity for them to make some extra money.\nShe wrote a letter and sent it home. It was estimated that it would take about a week for the letter to be received. At night, the three little ones each held a bottle of Coca-Cola and attracted the attention of many children while watching TV. This time, the adults suffered and were pestered by the children to buy Coke. The next day, the number of adults watching TV suddenly decreased by one-third.\nâHaha, I was scared by the kid, and I donât know where to hide to watch.â\nXu Xifeng, who worked at the steamed bun shop, gossiped with Li Xia while laughing, and the women all laughed when they heard it. The adults didnât understand what was so good about the Coke that tasted like medicinal soup, but they couldnât persuade the children at home.\nâMy naughty boy wanted more after finishing a bottle. He only behaved after I spanked him.â\nâSister Xu, you have two children, right? You and your husband both earn money, so you wouldnât beat your children for a bottle of Coke.â\nâOh, donât mention it. My husbandâs company allocated housing, and this time I finally managed to get one. I was in debt after trying to raise the money for the house.â\nâThis is a good thing. A house is a big thing. Having a house will give you stability.â\nThe woman smiled like a flower. âThatâs right, thatâs why I said those two brats were ignorant, and I gave them a beating before they\ngave up.â\n\n\nT/N:- I have posted ADVANCE Chapters (completed) of this novel on my Ko-fi page you can visit here.https://ko-fi.com/s/469b5da95e\n",

On Shen Huiâs side, Murong Danling was waiting for him at the school gate with this new thing after school. She rushed forward as soon as she saw it.\nâHuihui, son, look what mom bought you.â\nHuihua hasnât finished yet today, and the teacher called her to the office. Shen Hui was waiting for his sister, but he left when he saw her. He knew she wouldnât dare to hurt him, but he didnât want to stay with her any longer. The rare things that women thought were not attractive to her son at all, so she opened her mouth and used her trump card.\nâYou injured the tendons in my palm. I wonât be able to do delicate work anymore. I didnât make a fuss about it. Are you so cold-hearted as a son?â\nAs expected, Shen Hui stopped walking after hearing this: âReally?â\nI knew this kid was soft-hearted, and he would feel guilty if I said that. âOf course I am. I just came to see you and bring you something good, nothing else; you donât have to hide when you see me.â\nâsorry.â\nâItâs okay. How are your studies going recently?â There were people coming and going, and the two were talking at the school gate.\nâgood.â\nâRecently, your dad and your stepmother have been buying houses everywhere. I heard that they exchanged your backyard for theirs. Where did your stepmother get the goods? Whatâs the base price? Is she making a lot of money?â\nShen Hui raised his head suddenly, and his eyes turned cold. âI donât know.â\nMurong Danling slapped him in anger and said, âYou ungrateful boy, what secrets can you keep from your mother?â\nâItâs not a secret; itâs just that I really donât know. Iâm just a child; how can adults tell me what they do?â\nâHas she been very generous with her money recently? You should know that.â\nâShe has always been generous to us, buying us Coke every day. Winter is coming, so she made us new cotton-padded jackets and shoes. She also said that she would bring us new wind and snow jackets when she goes back to the south, saying that they are windproof and snowproof and very warm to wear in winter.â\nThis made Murong Danling very angry. The gentleness she had just shown disappeared all of a sudden. She raised her hand and slapped Shen Hui. But Shen Hui had been prepared for her and dodged to the side and ran away.\nThe apology he felt for her just now disappeared completely because of these questions and her raised hand. Her words of pity and concern for him were all fake. She just came to inquire about his family news.Â You are crazy. You envy my family for being rich, but you canât earn it yourself.\nOf course, Murong Danling came here to get information in order to make money. The information she got from everywhere was all mixed up. Some said she went to Shenzhen, some said she went to Guangzhou, and some said there were thieves and even robbers on the road. She was so nervous that she held the money she had collected and dared not move. She thought about asking her son for information, but she found out nothing.\nShen Hui went home alone in a daze, and Li Xia happened to be pushing her cart to close her stall, and the two met at the house gate. Li Xia saw that he looked a little upset, so she put down her cart and reached out to touch his forehead.\nâWhatâs wrong? Are you feeling unwell? You donât have a fever. Why donât we go see a doctor?â\nWith a gentle face and caring words, she watched him come back to his senses from his previous trance. He threw himself into Li Xiaâs arms, tears rushing out of his eyes.\nâMother,â\nâWhatâs wrong? Whatâs wrong? Tell mom if youâve been wronged. You have a dad and a mom. If anyone bullies you, we can go find them.â\nAs she was talking, Shen Haiyang came out of the yard. The couple took the child home, and they comforted him with words. Shen Hui finally calmed down after crying for a while. But he kept silent about why he was like this. Shen Haiyang checked his body and found no injuries, so he could only let it go for now.\nAt night, the couple quietly asked Huihua, and Huihua said that she saw Murong Danling after school, but she didnât know the details. The couple couldnât guess what Murong Danling had done to the child to make him so sad, and asking didnât seem to yield any results.\nâThe childâs heart has been hurt time and time again, and the mother and child are almost enemies.â\nShen Haiyang told his son to leave when he saw her, and the child nodded obediently. Murong Danling was so evil that she pushed her biological son further and further away again and again, which promoted the harmonious development of the relationship in their reconstituted family. Murong Danling did not appear again in the following days, and Li Xia was busy cleaning the backyard.\nIn less than ten days, all the houses in the backyard were replaced and soon moved out.\nThey started to buy putty, ceiling frames, paint, and other items. The busy scene made Murong Danling jealous. Fortunately, Fang Zhongchengâs house was also allocated. Although they owed some debts for the house, the joy of the new house still diluted the resentment in their hearts.\nNowadays, the housing units in the company are all plastered with cement and putty, and you can move in after cleaning up. She was busy buying curtains and cleaning up the new house, and when she was shopping for curtains and bed sheets on the street, she ran into Li Xia, who was coming out of the Foreign Trade Mall.\nLi Xia was carrying two large bundles, which looked like they were filled with cloth. One bundle was probably too full, and a corner of it was exposed. It was the most popular polyester curtain. It was royal blue and very dazzling in the sun.\nThis fabric is not cheap. Murong Danling was confused again. Humph, donât be arrogant. I donât believe your luck has always been so good. Now Shen Haiyang has retired to the second line due to illness, and his career is over. When Fang Zhongcheng becomes a high-ranking official, we will definitely be better than you two.\nLi Xia didnât even look at her; she just put her things on the tricycle and rode away. Not long after she got home, her father and brothers arrived, followed by three young men, including the second son, whose legs were still not very good. The old man was full of apologies when he faced his daughter. He was about to say something, but the second sonâs wife spoke first.\nâSister, your house is really nice. Your second brother canât do manual labor now, and my family has paid the public grain tax this yearâ¦â\nâThatâs enough.â The old man was so angry with his daughter-in-law after saying this in front of her. I told you that I would give you food to live on, but you insisted on coming with me. Come on, we will share some of the food, which will be enough for you two to eat, but why are you saying this?\nâXia, we all have a place to stay once we get here, right? Your third brother doesnât know how to do carpentry, and I thought youâd need to rebuild the doors, windows, and ceiling, so I called your eldest cousin over and let him do all the carpentry work. Weâll do the demolition work.â\nThe eldest cousin said to Li Xia cheerfully, âJust tell me what you want, boss.â\nLi Xia smiled and patted him without saying anything. This guy is still so lively after not seeing him for so many years. In her previous life, he seemed to be a small contractor, and she even went to the construction site to cook to earn money.\nThe man changed the subject, and Li Xia smiled and ignored her second sister-in-law, talking to her old father and the others. âYes, the backyard needs to be renovated. Itâs such a big place that you can live anywhere.â\nâThatâs good.â\nLi Xia went into the house to cook, while her third brother fetched water for everyone to wash up. She opened the door of the west wing and let her second brother go inside to rest. While she was cooking, she chatted with her old father and the other two brothers about family matters.\nâIs the harvest in the fields bad?â\nThe third brother replied, âItâs good. The harvest is higher when you take care of the crops yourself than when you were in the collective. Donât listen to that womanâs nonsense; she just wants to take advantage of it. You said in the letter that you would pay her according to the construction teamâs monthly salary, and she was immediately tempted. Itâs hard to find work in the winter, and she would rather drag your second brotherâs lame leg to make some money. Your third sister-in-law wanted to come to see you and help with cooking, but she didnât come because she and her husband came.â\nâMy second brotherâs leg doesnât seem to be recovering well.â\nThe old man sighed. âI told him not to rush to the fields and to help him after youâre done with this. But that woman was so anxious that your second brother went to the fields early, carrying the things, isnât it?â\nâGo to the hospital for a checkup to see if his bones are in any way damaged.â Itâs winter now, so come and stay here and take good care of yourself.â\nâHow can that be possible? We are here to work. If you let him recover here, how will your son-in-law look at you and our family?â\nâItâs okay, Dad; donât worry about it. Shen Haiyang is a good person, not the kind of person who would find fault with others.â Seeing that her father still disagreed, she continued, âI am making money from my small business now, and I am not entirely dependent on him for support. I have a say at home.â\nâReally? A small business isnât bad, is it?â\nâMore than Shen Haiyang earns.â\nâWell, well, well.â\nMoney is a personâs courage and a personâs backbone. When they heard that their daughter earned more than their son-in-law in business, the three of them burst into laughter. Although they knew that she lived a good life, they still stopped her from having pancakes for dinner.\nâNo, itâs too late to eat dry food at night. Just make soup noodles; donât make dry rice.â\nAfter a big pot of noodles was made, Shen Haiyang came back and saw that there were guests, and he immediately asked the children to go out and buy cooked food and steamed buns.\nIt was a very luxurious dinner for them. The three brothers-in-law tried to please their brother-in-law, but Shen Haiyang didnât put on airs with his family and quickly got to know them.\nThey were arranged to sleep in the backyard at night. When they arrived, they were worried that Li Xia didnât have enough bedding, so they brought it with them and just spread the kang mat on the kang to sleep.\nThe next morning, Li Xia cooked rice and ate the leftover steamed buns from last night. After Shen Haiyang and the children left, she arranged work for everyone.\nâDad, go to the backyard and dismantle the sheds, kitchens, and other things that have been built. Then remove the kangs in the main hall and the west wing. You and my third brother will be in charge of the dismantling work. My eldest cousin and I will go buy wood and come back to make the ceiling frames and other things that need to be replaced. My second brother canât do anything since his legs and feet are not in good condition. My second sister-in-law will help with the cooking at home.â\nSeveral men can do these jobs, and they nodded immediately. In the morning, they went to buy the necessary tools, such as pickaxes, shovels, and carts. Seeing everyone working, the second brother was eager to do it but was stopped by Li Xia.\nâYour legs are a little lame. If you continue to do this kind of heavy physical work and you canât recover well, what will happen if you become disabled? Donât be impatient. Sharpening the knife does not delay the chopping of wood. Itâs not too late to do it after you have recovered.â\nâBut Iâm just having a meal here; I canât stay here. Why donât we go home? Thereâs a train in the evening.â\nThe second sister-in-law curled her lips in disapproval. âWhy go back home now? It would be a waste of time to go back now, and I even spent money on the trip. The doctor said itâs not a big deal. A country man is lame, so what? I donât mind anyway.â\nLi Xia turned around and glared at her. âHeâs about to collapse in bed from exhaustion, and you donât mind. Are you going to support him?â\nâIâm a woman; how can I support him? A man gets food and clothing, and Iâm marrying him so he can support me.â\nâFeng Gaixiang, your shamelessness has really pushed my bottom line. Husbands and wives have the obligation to help each other, but you only distinguish between usefulness and ineffectiveness? My brother is lame and earns money, but when something goes wrong, you just walk away? Have you ever thought about it? with a cold-hearted woman like you, which man would dare to want you?â\nThe woman was a little embarrassed after being scolded by her sister-in-law. âThen isnât it natural for him, a grown man, to earn money for the family?â\nâMay I ask if you have no food at home? Now that you are all here with me, I will take care of your meals. There is no need to force my brother to work with his limping legs, right?â\nâThe family still has debts, the children are in school, and daily expenses all require moneyâ¦â\nâWe can slowly get through this difficult time. But let me ask you: If my brother is forced by you like this and he really collapses from exhaustion and lies on the kang, what will you do then?â\nâI,â\nâHe is the pillar of the family. If he falls, you will all be doomed.â\nâI, I just want to pay off my debts as soon as possible. I need to save some money to build a house. I canât always live in that leaky house.â\nâTake your time and donât push too hard. You help with the cooking here, and Iâll pay you.â\nâReally?â\nâReally.â\nâHow much?â\nWhen it comes to money, the woman is as happy as a flower. The embarrassment of being scolded before has long been thrown aside, and the fine lines on her face are like scratches on paper, full of the hardships of life.\nLi Xiaâs anger deflated like a deflated balloon, all because of the pressure of life. If she had to start over again to change her fate, she would have to find a way to help her parents and brothers, who had once cared for her.\nâItâs the same as working in a bun shop.â\nThe work intensity in the steamed bun shop was higher, and she was just cooking for a few people at home. After a moment of disappointment, the woman quickly nodded, smiled, and promised that she would definitely do a good job.\nShe worked very efficiently. Not only did she cook in the morning, she also cleaned the house and tidied the yard and the house. The second brother sat in the yard with nothing to do and helped peel potatoes for the bun shop.\nâIâm so sorry.â Xu Xifeng smiled and felt that Li Xiaâs family was honest and kind.\nâNothing. My legs arenât very strong, but it doesnât affect my work. Iâm idle anyway, so I might as well do something.â\nThey are all people who canât sit still, so they work hard when they arrive. The illegally built houses in the backyard are being demolished bit by bit, and Li Xiaâs business is also busy.\nAt night, when the third brother was washing up in the kitchen, the two siblings had time to chat alone.\nâ Your sister-in-law really liked the things you sent back, so I want to thank you for that.â\nLi Xia smiled at her third brother. âWhy are you being so polite to me? When I left home and came to the provincial capital to find Fang Zhongcheng, you gave me all that money. Third brother, you donât know; when I saw that, I burst into tears.â\nâAh, itâs all because your third brother is incompetent. He couldnât give you more, even if he wanted to. Fortunately, you are living so well now. If you had taken the two children back to the countryside, I would have had to lead the animals( her brothers ) to plow the fields for you now.â\nâHaha!â Li Xia laughed so hard that tears came out. In her previous life, her brothers helped her do the work that women couldnât do. In the days without machines, a woman who farmed the land would rely on the help of her brothers.\nâYou are helping me with my work now.â\nâThatâs different. Youâre living a good life now, and if we come to work, it will help us. I know that.â\nThird brother, thank you. Selling clothes is not suitable for you now. We are isolated, so it is not the right time to do this business. Wait, wait until society develops, and I will see what we can do to make money.\nWhile her father and his friends were helping with the work, Li Xia heard from Xu Xifeng that Fang Zhongcheng had borrowed money from outsiders. âItâs just a house, but those two are so proud of it. Humph, whatâs so great about it? Theyâre still in debt, just like me.â\nLi Xia suddenly felt that the time had come, and she talked to Shen Haiyang about it in the evening. The man immediately nodded and agreed with her.\nâFind some time to look for Fang Zhongcheng. Find a time when all his neighbors are around. That way, there will be more witnesses.â\nâI know I will make this known to all the neighbors.â\n\n\nT/N:- Hello guys I have made a schedule.

    "50": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c33/\nCHAPTER 33\nããShen Haiyang really looked down on Fang Zhongcheng. He was not really a man. He had neglected his child for such a long time. He was unworthy of being a father.\nããShen Haiyang didnât care whether to pay child support or not, he had no shortage of money and Li Xia also earned a lot. But he had to help his wife vent her anger, and hence changed the surnames of both children, and tried to make sure that he couldnât change it back even if he knew about it, and to piss off that bastard to death.\nããKnowing yourself and your enemy will ensure victory in every battle. After learning that Fang Zhongcheng was in debt because of his house and wife, Li Xia immediately went to him to ask for child support. Her purpose was to let his neighbors know that he didnât care about his two children.\nããShe chose to go at dinner time, when everyone was eating at home. His house was allocated by the company, and all his colleagues lived there. As a civil servant, they would definitely testify in court if necessary.\nããâBoom boom boom,â\nããAfter knocking on the door three times, Murong Danling opened it from the inside. As soon as she saw her, she frowned, looking impatient. âWhat are you doing here again?â\nããâCall Fang Zhongcheng out.â Li Xia said, intentionally raising her voice, using her loud voice from the fields to speak: âFang Zhongcheng, Fang Zhongcheng, come out.â\nããWhen she shouted, Fang Zhongcheng came out, and the crowd of onlookers also came out. Some of them were openly in the corridor, peeking out through the cracks in the doors of people on the same floor, and their eyes were all shining with gossip.\nããFang Zhongcheng was immediately annoyed by this phenomenon. He was a hypocrite who cared a lot about his reputation. He liked to talk about things in private. Li Xia thought that he was hiding his thoughts. He had lost his temper with her because of this. She was happy for him, and later his temper changed a lot.\nããAfter all, she had experience in this life and was very restrained in her actions. After marrying Shen Haiyang, she would always consider Shen Haiyangâs face before doing anything. On the contrary, Shen Haiyang often encouraged her to say whatever she wanted. She was always protecting this home and her family, and she was not afraid of being laughed at.\nããâAre you crazy? Why are you here making trouble again? We are divorced. I have nothing to do with you anymore.â\nããâHa,â Li Xia sneered sarcastically. âDivorce has nothing to do with me, but you havenât forgotten that you still have two children, right? Itâs been so long, you still have to pay me child support and my sonâs tuition and childcare fees.â\nããâIâ¦â Fang Zhongcheng was speechless. He was short of money and couldnât be tough. The people around him had already started to discuss quietly. The looks in their eyes made him feel ashamed and angry. But he was in the wrong, and he couldnât get angry even if he wanted to.\nããâWhy arenât you talking? Youâre getting remarried and planning on having another baby. Are you planning on leaving those two behind?â\nããHis face turned red and his neck became thick due to her ridicule. The discussion around him became louder. He was so ashamed and angry that he wanted to find a crack in the ground to crawl into, or cover her mouth with tape. But he couldnât do either of these two things, not even close the door to avoid her. His colleagues and family members were watching him, so he would be even more unreasonable if he hid back.\nããâI, Iâm a little tightâ¦â\nããâYou werenât worried about remarrying, buying a house, and living your own life, but youâre short on money now that you have two children? Oh, so you donât have the money to raise the children. Then why did you give birth to them in the first place?â\nããFang Zhongcheng lowered his head and gritted his teeth at her ridicule. His shame had already faded away, and now he was only annoyed. Oh, no, it had escalated into anger. He was so angry that he wanted to push this woman who slapped him in the face in public down the stairs.\nããBut he couldnât vent his anger, his face turned pale, blue, and red. His whole body was shaking like he was having the hiccups. Facts speak louder than words, nothing he said could change the situation. Unless he threw the money in Li Xiaâs face, he had no money and still owed foreign debts.\nããâIâll make it up to you when I have money.â\nããâOh, itâs been so long. If I didnât come, you wouldnât give me anything. If I came, you still wouldnât give me anything. The brigade has no money, so you can write me an IOU. Are you going to write me an IOU for your son?â\nããSomeone couldnât help laughing. This woman is really mean. But she deserves it. The stinky man divorced and didnât raise the children, leaving them all to the woman. He remarried and didnât want the children to start a new life. Have you ever thought about how difficult it would be for his ex-wife with two children? If her husband did this, she would have to die with him.\nããâLi Xia, donât go too far.â Fang Zhongchengâs body was shaking, his voice was shaking as well. His eyes were red, like an animal that was cornered. But he couldnât fight back, and had to bear all the damage himself.\nããMurong Danling did have money, but it was her money for business, so she certainly couldnât pay child support for him. She didnât even care about her own son. Of course, Shen Haiyang had sued to deprive her of visitation rights, and she didnât take Shen Hui seriously.\nããâIâm being too harsh?â Li Xia also started to act. She was no longer as fierce as before, but aggrieved and pitiful. âAfter the divorce, you pushed the two children to me. I worked in the wind and sun every day to raise the children. Now you say Iâm being too harsh? Are these two my own children?â\nããFang Zhongcheng was already so bullied by her that he couldnât say a word. People around him were talking about it, all accusing him of being irresponsible. If you donât like rural women, why did you marry her in the first place? If you donât like rural women, how did you get those two children? This kind of person is a complete beast, unable to control his lower body.\nããLi Xia realized that she had achieved her goal and didnât stay any longer. As if in slow motion, she turned around and said, âForget it, forget it. I gave birth to them and I will raise them. I will, raise them.â\nããShe left, and the crowd dispersed. Fang Zhongcheng was dragged into the house by his wife like a ghost, and soon a fierce quarrel broke out inside, and there were sounds of things breaking.\nããLi Xia didnât care how the couple quarreled, her goal had been achieved. This time everyone knew about the quarrel, even if he paid the child support later, the bad impression would be deeply rooted in peopleâs minds. The child support was something she had worked so hard to get, and Fang Zhongcheng didnât care about the two children.\nããââââ\nããGenerally, starting from the tenth month of the lunar calendar, people start to prepare clothes for the New Year. At the same time, more and more small businesses are opening, and her clothes are soon sold out. She gathers funds and prepares to go south to buy another batch.\nããShe counted the cash at night, and she was a little scared of the heavy bag. In this era without computers, sending money from the bank was very troublesome and time-consuming, and she was really nervous about carrying cash. It was winter, and the roads were even more dangerous. If it was stolen or robbed, all her hard work would go to waste.\nããâHow about asking Han Jun to help me? Iâll give him a commission. Otherwise, I can ask third brother to accompany me.â\nããHan Jun is a retired soldier and is now a policeman. With him, the safety factor will definitely increase. But he is a working person. Isnât it bad to do this privately? Li Xia regretted it a little after she finished speaking, and quickly tried to make up for it by asking her third brother to go with her.\nããâThereâs still work to do at home, and third brother has no experience traveling far away. Letâs find Han Jun and see if he has time.â\nããShen Haiyang said this, and Li Xia nodded. The third brother was honest and had no experience in dealing with these things. If the two of them encountered robbers or scammers on the road, or a combination of the two, Han Jun would be better able to deal with them, and his status would also be able to suppress those villains.\nããAs for Han Jun, he came the next day and said, âSister-in-law, do you have any job that can make money for me? I reallyâ¦â\nããLi Xia and her husband looked at each other and she said softly, âAre you thinking of going into the adult entertainment industry?â\nããIn the late 1980s, when the craze for going into business was still in its infancy, people were still very conservative. They didnât dare to take risks, especially those with stable jobs, who didnât dare to gamble everything on one throw. Was he forced into a corner by life, or was he envious of her money?\nããâIâm so in debt that I canât make ends meet. I donât care if itâs a stable job or not. I just want to make money now, even if I can make a penny more.â\nããâDo you have time recently? If so, come with me to the south. Iâll give you a monthâs salary and weâll be gone for about a week. Trading requires capital, so if you donât have any, accumulate some first.â\nããâOkay, Iâll take ten days off.â\nããShen Haiyang couldnât say much because of the pressure of life. If he didnât have the money his father gave him as a foundation and Li Xia didnât make as much money, he would probably have the same idea at this time. After all, itâs not easy to raise three children. Especially if you want to raise them well, it will cost more money.\nããHuihua is learning to paint, and Shen Hui seems to be very interested in mental arithmetic. He is looking for a teacher for his child recently. Yiyi is also very smart, and it is necessary to cultivate the childâs interests. And all these require money to support. His father gave him enough US dollars, but he was reluctant to spend them on daily life.\nããThe next day, Li Xia told her family that she and Han Jun are going south to buy goods. The old father didnât know how much his daughter could earn from doing all this, but the bun shop was running and the son-in-law was kind to them, so the grandfathers worked hard and tried to finish the demolition before the end of the year and the doors, windows, cabinets and the house and everything else are ready. When the weather warms up next year, they can start the renovation.\nããThe family was busy cleaning the house. Accompanied by Han Jun, she returned safely. Li Xia told Shen Haiyang about the thrilling experience on the road. âIt was a robbery, with a knife in his hand. My God, if Han Jun hadnât been there, I would have been scared to death.â\nããShen Haiyang was also shocked when he heard this: âThis is too dangerous, where did you meet him? Did he know that you were carrying a large amount of cash or was he robbing you blindly?â\nããâHe didnât rob us. He was just outside the industrial zone, observing and looking for someone to attack. We caught up with him and were blocked in the alley. Han jun was holding the money in his hand, and then he handed the bag to me and took out a dagger. Wow, didnât you see that? He was so powerful. He scared those people away in just a few moves.â\nããHan Jun had been in elementary school, and later trained in the army, so he had real kung fu skills. He didnât fight to the death, probably because he cared about the cash he brought and the safety of other peopleâs lives and property. âItâs good that youâre okay. What happened next? How did you deal with it?â\nããâWe called the police, but they didnât catch the gang until we left. The two women they targeted were also well-dressed and carrying small suitcases. They looked rich. Itâs a recipe for disaster. You donât know how to show off your wealth.â\nããâItâs too dangerous. Let Han Jun go with you next time.â\nããLi Xia nodded: âI have agreed with him that he will come once every two or three months in the future. He can earn extra money this way, but I am afraid that his company will not agree if it lasts too long.â\nããA few years later, there was a wave of people going into business. The country developed rapidly but the wages of companies were not adjusted in time, causing many people to leave their previous jobs one by one, either due to livelihood pressure or because of envy of small business owners.\nããAlong the way, she chatted with Han Jun and learned that he was in a very difficult situation. His mother was ill and hospitalized. She had serious sequelae after a cerebral hemorrhage and was basically dependent on medication and treatment. The two children in the family were in school, and his wife could not work because she had to take care of the family. The burden of the family fell on his shoulders alone. He was a very active person, and perhaps he would have a choice soon.\nããAfter applying night cream, she got into bed, put her feet on the hot water bottle and relaxed her whole body. âHowâs the backyard renovation going?â\nããâThe ones built in the yard have been dismantled almost completely. Next we will dismantle the suspended ceiling and the bad doors and windows. My eldest cousin made two windows and said that there is so much work to be done that he will not go home during the Chinese New Year and will stay here to work overtime.â\nããLi Xia smiled and thought of the list she had made. It is easier to buy furniture now than in previous years, but she meant to make some antique furniture herself. A pure Chinese courtyard house looks so good with antique furniture. The demolition here will be more than ten years later. In the next ten years, let the old man enjoy the pure Chinese style. If he doesnât live there, all of them will be hers.\nããAfter the goods were received, several people came to her for wholesale the next day. In the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, the first thing to prepare for the New Year is clothes. This period is the golden period for clothing, and she is busy every day.\nããâXia, this cotton coat is so beautiful. People in big cities really have a good life!â\nããThe second sister-in-law held a silk cotton jacket and said something that could make you jealous. Nowadays, rural people still buy cloth to make clothes, and the styles are definitely not comparable to those made by large factories in the south. Moreover, silk cotton is thin and light, and it is more stylish than soft cotton, and it makes you look thin and neat when you wear it.\nããLi Xia ignored the obvious tone of asking for money, and the second sister-in-law was so angry that she put down her cotton jacket and went out to cook. In the evening, she complained to her husband that her sister-in-law was too unkind, but the man not only did not help her but scolded her instead.\nããâYou had to drag a person like me who canât work here to eat and drink for free. You just helped to cook and you want to be paid. How dare you ask for a cotton-padded jacket? Feng Gaixiang, if you continue to be so ignorant, I will break off my relationship with Xia Xia. I want to see how you can take advantage of her in the future.â\nããâLi Lao Er, who is the one you will spend your life with? Why do you always turn your elbow outward?â\nããâThatâs my sister. We are from the same mother. How can she be considered an outsider? Anyway, we should not be shameless.â\nããâYou said I was shameless, Li Lao Er, you have no conscience. Who am I doing all this forâ¦â\nããThe couple had a quarrel, and no one in the courtyard who heard it asked about it. Let the young couple solve their own problems. Li Xia didnât know about this at all. She was not reluctant to part with a cotton jacket, but she had her own plans. The one that the second sonâs wife took was in very good condition and could be sold at a high price.\nããDuring this period, the clothing business was not Strict, there will be contaminated, defective and unqualified ones in every batch. She thought that she would give her one after she had sold most of them. Besides, it was the New Year, and her old father and brother had worked here for a whole winter, so they couldnât go home empty-handed. And there were also her mother and two sisters-in-law, so it was best to take care of them all.\nããRural people are family members, so they can wash dirty clothes and repair defective ones without any problem. In this way, they can wear as many pieces as possible, so that they can all wear new clothes during the New Year.\nããThe second sonâs wife was angry because of being scolded by the man. She looked cold and didnât say much the next day. During breakfast, Huihua asked her where the vinegar was, and she stood aside without saying a word. The old man glanced at her. She quickly took out the vinegar from the cupboard and handed it to her niece.\nããâHere. Aunt didnât hear what you said just now.â\nããHuihua poured vinegar and went to the yard to eat. She didnât dare to face her father-in-law, and lowered her head awkwardly, secretly regretting that she shouldnât have lost her temper.\nããâIf you donât want to stay, go home.â\nããWith just one simple sentence, the woman apologized again. When Li Xia came in, she served everyone food attentively, and after they finished eating, she offered to send Yi Yi to kindergarten.\nããâDonât bother, Iâll send him on my way.â\nããShen Haiyang took the children to school, and Li Xia was busy setting up the stall. The whole family left the kitchen, and the old man smoked a pack of cigarettes, tapped the pipe, and started to scold his daughter-in-law again.\nããâThe old ancestors were right. If you donât want to earn this money, go home. Your sister-in-law and your brotherâs wife can do it.â\nããâDad, I didnât mean it. Iâll do my best.â\nããEveryone left, and she washed the dishes and cleaned up by herself, not daring to quarrel with others. As soon as she was about to ask for more, she was extinguished one after another.\nããIn the following days, she didnât dare to say anything bad, and she didnât go to see Li Xiaâs stuff. She just cooked and cleaned the house honestly, for fear that such a good job would not be needed for her.\nããBy the end of the year, all the demolition work in the backyard had been done. The whole house looked bare and desolate, and the old father reached out and patted her, smiling and comforting her.\nããâWeâll just have to clean it up again in the spring.â\nããâWell, itâs much more open than before.â\nããâLaying floor tiles, replacing doors and windows, painting, hanging ceilings, and painting walls, there will be a lot of work next year.â\nããâCan you guys take care of it?â\nããâI can take care of it. Iâll ask relatives to help with the planting. Your sister-in-law and the others can do the rest. And your eldest brother is at home, so donât worry.â\nããâWell. Then you can leave this afternoon and come back after the New Year. Iâll see whatâs going on here. If I have time, Iâll come back. If I donât have timeâ¦â\nããâJust take care of yourselves and donât worry about home.â\nããâWell, take everything.â\nããThe old man then realized that his daughter had prepared two large bags of clothes for him, and he immediately refused to take them. Li Xia opened them for him to see and told him that they were all defective.\nããâSome are dirty, some have jumpers, some have broken wires, some have buttons missing, etc. Anyway, they all have problems and cannot be sold. Take them home and let my mother and others fix them.â\nããâItâs just a small problem. It wonât affect your wearing. You can keep it and sell it.â\nããâI canât sell it. If I really want to sell it, the price will be very low, less than the cost. Itâs better to take it home and wear it ourselves.â\nããThe eldest cousin joked about staying, but he had almost finished the carpentry work in a hurry. Everyone worked hard for their sister. Before leaving, he saw that his cousin had prepared a bag of clothes for him, and his face was immediately full of joy. It was worth his overtime work for her.\nããâDonât be disgusted, cousin. Itâs just a small flaw. It wonât affect your ability to wear it if you fix it.â\nããâWhy would you dislike such nice clothes? Your sister-in-law will be so happy to see them. Okay, weâll continue working after the New Year. Donât worry, I promise to do it well for you.â\nããThe old man still felt bad, so he put the money his daughter gave him under the bed before leaving. It was not right for a father to come to help his daughter during the off-season and ask for wages, not to mention that she gave him so many clothes before leaving. TheÂ  couple even bought all the autumn clothes and trousers for the house, so how could he get more money?\nããLi Xia found out that her father didnât take the money, so she had to go to the post office to send it back to him. The whole family joined in the year-end cleaning. When they were done, Shen Hui didnât know what he was looking for, and he found the household registration book in the drawer. He had heard from his father about moving Yi Yiâs household registration a long time ago, but today he saw the five members of the family neatly in one book. He took it and showed it to Yi Yi.\nããâLook, this is our household registration book. This page is about you.â\nããâShen Ruyi,â Yi Yi pointed at the big characters on his page in the household registration book and read them one by one happily. Then he raised his head and showed off to Shen Hui: âBrother, I also have the last name Shen, just like you. Whether you are happy or not, I am very happy.â\nããShen Hui rolled his eyes at him, seemingly disdainful, but actually reached out and stuffed a piece of candy into his mouth. âWhatâs there to be happy about having a stupid little brother?â\nããâIâm not stupid, Iâm the smartest.â\nããâOkay, youâre a smart guy.â\nããHuohua took the household registration book and read it several times, then looked up at her father and smiled silently. Someone at school once asked her why she didnât have the same last name as her brother, but her mother, and she didnât know how to answer. But now she wonât be asked such a question again.\nããâDad, Iâm going to practice calligraphy.â\nããThe little girl handed the household registration booklet to Shen Haiyang, turned around and went back to her room in the west room. She did well in Chinese in the final exam, but not in math. The little girl knew where her shortcomings were, and she started attending the schoolâs calligraphy class last year. Now she writes big characters seriously every day.\nããPainting, calligraphy and painting have been inseparable since ancient times. She likes art and was deeply shocked after coming into contact with Chinese painting. She made up her mind to apply for an art college in the future and start practicing calligraphy from now on.\nããShen Hui took his brother to watch TV after drawing and writing calligraphy. He got full marks in both subjects in the final exam. Shen Haiyang found him a teacher to teach mental arithmetic. He started learning before the New Year and resumed the course on the eighth day after the New Year. He could have a few days of carefree fun.\nããâIt would be better if I stayed a child.â\nããâBrother, what did you say?â\nããShen Hui patted the back of his head and said, âI envy you, little idiot. You donât have to learn anything and just play every day.â\nããâDad said he would sign me up for next year, but I wonât be able to play anymore.â\nããâNo way, Dad is too cruel. He wonât let any of us three go.â\nããâBrother, isnât it fun to learn arithmetic?â\nããâIt was fun at first. It wasnât a big deal, it was fun.â\nããShen Hui smiled and pulled his brother to sit on the chair. The happy time of the little fool was about to pass, and they would become brothers in distress in the future. Thinking of this, he suddenly felt that he liked this brother very much. It was great to have him, and it was also great to have him to draw with.\nããLi Xia watched through the glass window as her daughter quietly practiced calligraphy at the table. She bit her lips and looked calm and resolute. She was a calm and steady person in her previous life. In this life, she had shed her inferiority complex and now looked calm and confident.\nããâShen Haiyang, do you think it would be a good idea to let Huihua learn another instrument?â\nããâIt depends on what the child wants.â Shen Haiyang smiled and cooked with her. âPlaying music, chess, calligraphy and painting, are you trying to train your daughter to be a lady from a noble family?â\nããâI just heard people say that music can cultivate oneâs sentiments and improve oneâs temperament. I have not studied much in my life, and I donât understand anything elegant. Of course I want my daughter to be beautiful and elegant, and not to grow up like me.â\nããâWhatâs wrong with you? Youâre fine.â\nããLi Xia blushed when she was praised by her husband. However, this yearâs results gave her unlimited confidence. She looked at him a little embarrassed, but she did not avoid him out of inferiority.\nããâI have sold all my goods this year and recovered all my funds. I will go south after the Lantern Festival. This time I plan to buy bell-bottom pants and shirts that young people like.â\nããâI just said my wife is very good and amazing.â\n",
    "51": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c33-2/\nDuring the Chinese New Year, Shen Haiyang had to be on duty, so she took her three children back to her hometown. Her parents saw the warm reception and the relatives gathered around to ask questions. She was afraid that Shen Hui would not be used to the countryside, so she asked Huihua and yiyi to take care of their brother.\nããSpending the New Year with her family, reuniting after several years is a lively experience. On the fifth day of the first lunar month, she took the children back to the city, and after the Lantern Festival, she went south again. After her father and brother came, they began to replace the doors and windows and repair the floor.\nããThe second sonâs wife worked for fifty days in winter and earned two new sets of clothes and thirty-two yuan. After returning home, she calculated that it was more cost-effective here, so after the New Year, she left the second son at home to prepare the land for planting, and she came here again to earn more money.\nããThe tiles on the floor that were not in good condition were replaced, the doors and windows were replaced, the ceilings, walls were painted, and the doors, windows and furniture were paintedâ¦ As the weather warmed up,\nããThe backyard was renovated in an orderly manner. By April, all the renovations were completed and the entire backyard was restored to its original appearance. It was no longer messy and old, but presented a brand new look.\nããLi Xiaâs business entered the off-season after the beginning of spring, and she sold goods slowly day by day. With the second sonâs wife cooking and cleaning at home, she was quite relaxed. When she had time, she would show her eldest cousin how to make furniture. When the furniture was ready, the old man would sand it over and over again until it was as smooth as a mirror before applying paint evenly.\nããLi Xia chose both the wood and the paint. After the furniture, doors and windows are painted, as the weather warms up, they will dry and the smell will evaporate in good ventilation.\nããTime passed quickly and everyone changed into thin clothes. The men who worked even started to go shirtless at noon. Her cousin said that it would save clothes. Li Xia looked at the bleeding cut on his face and could only buy him some Yunnan Baiyao.\nããAt dinner, the old man tapped his pipe and said goodbye to Li Xia. âThe furniture has been put away. We can move in once the paint dries and the smell has settled. Itâs time for us to go home. The corn and wheat are almost harvested, and thereâs a lot of work to do at home.â\nããâOkay, let my third brother buy the tickets this afternoon, and you guys should prepare to go back.â\nããAfter the Chinese New Year, each person worked for more than two months, and she paid them according to the actual number of days worked. Everyone smiled happily after receiving the money, but the third one felt a little embarrassed in front of her and stretched out his hand to refuse.\nããâI got a lot before the New Year, and new clothes. Forget about the wages this time. Thereâs no need to be so calculating when relatives do a favor.â\nããAfter he said that, the cousin was a little hesitant. The old man didnât want it at first, but Li Xia stuffed it into his bag during the New Year. Now he was hesitating about how to refuse.\nããâHere. Letâs be fair. You put down your work in the fields and come to help me. How can I let you go back empty-handed?â\nããAfter putting the money into the third brotherâs pocket and smiling at her cousin, she turned around and went out to pack her things. This time when she went to the south, she bought a lot of fleece clothes and trousers, and sorted out the ones that the family could wear and asked her father to take them back. In the past, in the early spring, they took off their cotton clothes and wore jackets or single clothes. They would shiver in the morning and at night. The fleece clothes are made of acrylic, which is very easy to generate static electricity. People with bad skin will feel itchy, but it is definitely a magic weapon for this period.\nããâDongdong,â\nããShe was sorting things inside when she heard a knock on the door and came to answer it. It was her second sister-in-law, who looked at her with a smile on her face. She sat down, stroked the woolen coat she had given her, and said words of thanks, then changed the subject and got down to business.\nããâXia, can you arrange for me to work in your bun shop?â After saying that, she stood up and rolled up her sleeves and added, âIâm good at work, definitely not worse than them. We are a family, you wonât give the lucrative job to others and not give it to me, right?â\nããâMy brother and two kids are at home. What will they do if you stay here? Besides, the people in the bun shop are doing well. There is no room for you.â\nããâThe bun shop is yours, so itâs up to you to decide whether thereâs space or not. I can see that your man listens to you in everything, so he wonât say anything if you help your family with this little thing.â\nããLi Xia looked at her in silence, then shook her head and refused. âItâs still what I said just now, I canât drive away someone who is doing a good job for no reason.â\nããâThen Iâll stay and help you sell clothes.â\nããânot needed for now.â\nããâXia, I am your sister-in-law. Donât worry, I will obey you if you hire me to do any work. I understand this now.â\nããâI know, but thereâs no suitable place.â\nããâThen, then you have to arrange for me first when there is a suitable place. Write to me and I will come right away.â\nããâBesides, this isnât that easy.â\nããâOkay, you remember your family anyway.â\nããNodding to her sister-in-law, she took the sweater and got up to leave. Li Xia lowered her head and thought about it. The second sister-in-law was a petty person with a lot of small problems. But this woman was also very capable, just wanting to live a better life, and seeing that she was capable, she wanted her help.\nããShe was thinking of some suitable small businesses for them to start, and she would help them at first. Her eldest brother and his wife are too old to come to the city, and her third brotherâs children are in school, so itâs impossible for them to leave. Iâll take it slow and find suitable families one by one.\nããThis is a win-win situation. If her parents are doing well, she doesnât have to worry about them anymore, and her parents can feel at ease. Her two brothers will come to the city to help her. Itâs more convenient to do physical work than to ask outsiders.\nããSending off her old father and her brother and sister-in-law,\nããThey started to eat in the canteen again. Clothing wholesale and retail business was basically back on track, and although they were busy every day, they were no longer so flustered.\nããWhen she closed the stall and went home in the evening, she saw Shen Haiyang wearing an apron and busy in front of the stove through the window. She put the goods and the cart in the corridor connecting the main. room and the east wing, covered them with plastic sheeting, and then went into the kitchen.\nããShe washed her hands with water and asked, âDidnât you say the food in the cafeteria was delicious? Why are you cooking at home again?â\nããShen Haiyangâs illness always made her worried. It was just a meal, the cafeteria couldnât handle it. She felt a little resentful that he didnât take care of his body, and her tone naturally brought it out, and her brows were furrowed.\nããAfter washing her hands, she wanted to take over the cooking, but Shen Haiyang dodged her. The man smiled with gentle features, and there were stars in his clear eyes. She was also infected and raised the corners of her mouth, looking at him and taking a deep breath.\nããâIâm sorry, I was just worried about you.â\nããShen Haiyang looked at the window, then leaned over to kiss her. He was ill, and there was no effective cure. He knew she was worried, so she bought him nutritional supplements and took the time to do the housework because she was afraid that he would be tired.\nããâI feel very good recently, donât worry. Today is Yiyiâs birthday, and I promised to make longevity noodles for him.â\nããLi Xia raised her hand and slapped her forehead, looking at him in annoyance and regret. âIâm sorry, I lost my mind. Come on, give it to me, Iâll do it.â\nããCrack three eggs into the flour, add water and stir. My sonâs birthday, how could I forget it? I had a chance to do it again. I clearly thought that the most important thing was to raise my child well, but why did I seem to be going further and further away?\nããMake money, make money. Iâve had enough of the pain of being poor. I only think that money can solve most of the problems in life. I must seize the opportunity and work hard to make money.\nããShe admits that she is not well educated, not very capable, and not even very courageous. She dares to think and act now because she knows the future development. When this period is over and she is completely in the dark, she will definitely not be so open-minded. So she hurried to make money, but it seems that she ignored the spiritual needs of the children. She is not as close to the children as Shen Haiyang.\nããâYi Yi, have you been naughty recently? Have you gotten yourself scolded?â\nããShen Haiyang was peeling green onions with a smile, his slender fingers doing everything slowly and methodically. âHe broke the thermos a few days ago, but it was empty so he didnât get burned.â\nããâI knew this brat was restless. Iâll pick him up tomorrow. Did he get into a fight with someone? You must have been scolded a lot because of him.â\nããShen Haiyang glanced outside the door and saw a small shadow disappearing quickly at the door. âAfter all, he is my son.â\nããWith just one simple sentence, Li Xia stopped talking. She had originally wanted to insist on picking up her son at her own time, but now she suddenly felt that doing so would hurt his feelings.\nããStart by kneading the cotton wool into dough, flattening the eggs and cutting into shreds, cutting into fungus shreds, and chopping the day lily. Today she is making saozi noodles for the little brat. Heâs sure to like the sour, spicy and fragrant taste.\n\n\n\nããShe took over the cooking. Shen Haiyang peeled the green onions and went out to get the cake he ordered. This yearâs new cake shop had a lot of people buying this new thing. If you want it, you have to make a reservation one day in advance.\nããThe little guy had a cake and his favorite noodles for his birthday. He made a wish and started to cut them. âIâll do it myself. I want a big piece for dad.â\nããThe little guy cut the cake by himself, put the biggest piece into a bowl and placed it in front of Shen Haiyang. âHappy birthday, Dad.â\nããâHaha,â everyone wanted to laugh at him. When someone said happy birthday to him, he actually imitated and said it to Shen Haiyang. Huihua wanted to correct him, but he didnât take it seriously. He raised his little head and looked very proud.\nããâI want to spend my birthday with dad.â\nããâCan I celebrate my birthday with someone?â Shen Hui took a bite of the cake and rolled his eyes at him, then turned to Shen Haiyang and asked. âDad, I want a cake for my birthday next year, too.â\nããâOkay, from now on, you three will have cakes on your birthdays.â\nããâOh yeah, Dad is the best, long live Dad.â\nããThe family never ran out of ordinary candies and biscuits. Shen Haiyang would also be satisfied with new things like Coca-Cola and cakes. The little ones cheered for their father, and one by one even kissed him on the face with their butter-covered mouths.\nããâHa ha,â\nããThe little guy laughed out loud at his fatherâs appearance. Shen Haiyang always had that smile on his face towards the children.\nããLi Xia wiped him clean with a towel and scolded her son, telling him to eat well and not to mess around.\nããâEat this expensive food well and stop making trouble, or Iâll beat you up.â\nããâOkay.â\nããShe handed out paper to everyone and went to the stove to cook noodles. Yi Yi looked at her from behind and whispered, âMom is so stingy.â\nããShen Haiyang also imitated him and whispered: âThe money to buy you the cake was given by your mother.â\nããThe little guy looked up and widened his eyes, his black and white eyes were full of disbelief. âReally?â\nããâreally.â\nããâCan I buy another cake tomorrow?â\nããLi Xia turned around and glared at him: âYouâll be bright if you get some sunshine, right? Is your butt itchy again?â\nããâNo.â His brother and sister laughed at him, but he smiled playfully. âWhen can I buy it next time, Mom?â\nããThis brat, he climbed up as soon as he was given a pole. He likes sweets, and he likes this kind of soft and sweet food very much. In his previous life, he wanted to eat it but couldnât, so he could only watch, and never mentioned these requests to her.\nããâWe can buy a normal cake, but itâs a little weird to buy a birthday cake for daily eating.â\nããâOkay. I like any cake.â\nããRelying on being the youngest in the family, he asked for the benefits. Turning around to show off to his brothers and sisters, Shen Hui raised his head proudly, and his expression silently said that my mother would give it to me if I asked for it.\nããââââ\nããThe little guyâs birthday had been celebrated a few days ago, and Fang Zhongcheng suddenly remembered that he had a son. In the evening, after school, he went to the kindergarten to see his son, and he heard the teacher calling him Shen Ruyi.\nããâShen Ruyi?â\nããWhen did his son change his surname to Shen? This was like a bolt from the blue. He immediately found Shen Haiyang in the crowd and questioned him, with veins on his forehead bulging as he spoke.\nããâShen Haiyang, explain this to me. How come my son, Fang Ruyi, has your last name Shen? How dare you be so arrogant? donât you have a son of your own, but youâre trying to steal mineâ¦â\nããâHush,â Shen Haiyang felt that it was inappropriate to shout like that in public. Fang Zhongcheng calmed down quickly after getting excited. They were all intellectuals, so they should find a place to talk. Such careless and shrew-like behavior made him blush.\nããâLetâs go to your house and talk.â\nããThe two men took the child back to Shen Haiyangâs home. Li Xia saw the situation at the intersection. She handed the stall to Xiao Liu and quickly followed him back home.\nããâNo matter what the reason is, Yi Yi is my son. How could he change his last name?â\nããâWhy canât we change it?â Li Xia came in and glared at him, speaking with confidence. âMy son, I gave birth to him and raised him, I can give him whatever surname I want.â\nããâLi Xia, you are being unreasonable. Since ancient times, children have taken their fatherâs surname. I am not a live-in son-in-law, so why shouldnât my son take my surname?â\nããâBecause you only care about giving birth but not raising the child, and because you donât want to transfer the childâs household registration to your name. You donât even want to have the child, and you still have the nerve to ask me why, Fang Zhongcheng, who gave you such a big face?â\nããLi Xia spoke bluntly, and Huihua heard her motherâs angry rebuke from outside the door. The three children stood in the yard, staring at each other, and Shen Hui looked at his younger brother and sister with some sympathy.\nããI used to think they had a good mother who would never abandon her children no matter the circumstances. But their father still had a stable job and didnât want themÂ  even if she divorced him. But now it seems that they are quite pitiful.\nããChildrenâs brain circuits are so interesting. After comparing, they immediately found resonance. Shen Hui held sisterâs hand with his left hand and the other with his right hand. The three children seemed to be closer with their schoolbags on their backs. It turned out that they were all âbrothers in distressâ.\nããFang Zhongcheng was so angry that his face turned red and he didnât know where to start. They had been trying to have another child since last year, but they still hadnât gotten pregnant. They went to the hospital for a checkup and they said there was nothing wrong with them, but they just couldnât get pregnant.\nããHe was upset and went to the kindergarten to see his son, but his son had changed his last name. Shen Haiyang had custody of his son, and with the last name changed, it seemed like his son had nothing to do with him anymore.\nããâAnyway, you canât just change my sonâs last name.â\nããâThe law states that a child can take either the fatherâs or the motherâs surname. First, we are raising the child, and the household registration is under my husbandâs name. It is reasonable for him to change his surname to Shen.â\nããâI was originally raising YiYi, so please give him back to me now.â\nããâFang Zhongcheng, can you please be more careful? Children are not cats and dogs. Iâve told you several times, donât you understand what Iâm saying?â Li Xia was really angry this time. She raised her hand and picked up the broom in the yard.\nããâYou are already in your thirties or even forties, but what you say is just bullshit. Marriage, children, the most important and responsible things in life have become just a game for you. You can take what you want and not take what you donât want. Who do you think you are? The sun, should the whole earth revolve around you?â\nããSeeing her furious and ready to hit someone, Fang Zhongcheng subconsciously took a step back. In the past two years, Li Xia had become much gentler, making him forget that she used to be a fearless person in a fight. Today, if she wanted to hit him twice, he could only take it.\nããâGo away, you can visit your kids if you want, but you have no right to say anything else.â\nããâThatâs my son, my own son, how could Iâ¦â\nããâWhy didnât you say he was your own son when I was raising him alone? Why didnât you say he was your own son when I asked you to move his household registration? You donât take responsibility, but youâre just talking nonsense here about your rights. You only gave birth to the child but didnât raise him. You didnât even move his household registration. How thick-skinned do you have to be to say these things?â\nããAfter speaking with reason and evidence, Fang Zhongcheng was speechless. She continued to ridicule him: âI used to think you were a scholar, and scholars are the most responsible and have a sense of face. Now your actions one after another are simply shocking to my cognition. I didnât expect that there are scholars like you who are shameless in this world.â\nããâMany who are righteous are butchers, and most who are unfaithful are scholars.â\nããThe crowd watching the fun said something like this, and everyone started to talk about it. There were all kinds of things to say, but as for todayâs gossip, the female friend felt that Fang Zhongcheng was indeed unreasonable.\nããâThe mother is raising the child, so naturally she has the final say on the surname.â\nããWomen are awakening to the idea of taking on family and social responsibilities, and they also want to have their own rights. Why should a child only take the fatherâs surname? I gave birth to the child and I raised him. If you donât care, you have no right to interfere with the childâs surname.\nããâyiyi â\nããFang Zhongchengâs old face flushed, and he called his son. He had lost face today, and he wanted to walk away in anger, but that would be like running away, so he asked his son for help. If the child was close to him, then he wouldnât be so ridiculous today.\nããHe had a good idea, but he obviously overestimated his importance in his sonâs heart. When Yi Yi heard him calling himself, he hid behind Shen Haiyang.\nããThe little guyâs behavior made the crowd look at him even more amused. Fang Zhongcheng wished he could find a crack in the ground to crawl into, or just disappear on the spot. Why did he come here? He was just asking for a beating. His face flushed with shame and anger, and he lowered his head, pushed the crowd away, and left in a hurry.\nããShen Haiyang looked at the brat and didnât know whether to laugh or cry. This kid was very cunning and sly. He knew exactly what to do and when to do it. He was very helpful to the couple. But he didnât respect his ex father very much. Fang Zhongcheng lost face today and became a complete joke.\n",

Yiyi smiled foolishly at Shen Haiyang, and the man touched his head and told the children to do their homework.\n　　After Shen Haiyang took away her broom, Li Xia took a deep breath to calm down from the displeasure just now. She thought that she had calmed down after her new life and would not be emotional for Fang Zhongcheng anymore, but she was still shaking with anger after hearing what he said. In a hurry, she said everything she had hidden, and all the dirty words came out.\n　　Now that she had calmed down, she felt a little embarrassed to face Shen Haiyang. Would he think she was too rude? She stood there and took a few deep breaths, looking at him, wanting to say something but not saying it, and then turned around and walked out of the yard.\n　　”I haven’t closed my stall yet, I’ll go and close it first. I’ll buy some pressed noodles for dinner, and we’ll have braised noodles. Don’t worry about it, I’ll come back and cook.”\n\n\n\n　　She fled in haste. Shen Haiyang laughed silently behind her, thinking his wife was so cute sometimes. She was just scolding someone, but she was still shy afterwards.\n　　”Huihui, take the flour to the east alley entrance to exchange for thin noodles. Mom said she will make braised noodles tonight.”\n　　Even though he was told not to worry about it, he still scooped out some flour and asked his son to replace the machine-made noodles. Then he took out the dried beans, soaked them, and washed them. He peeled the potatoes and cut them into thick strips. There would definitely be no meat in the dinner that night. He fried the dried beans and potatoes with oil until fragrant, and then stewed the noodles on the dishes.\n　　When Li Xia came in, he had almost finished cooking. She untied his apron and tied it around herself, then took the spatula from his hand and continued cooking.\n　　Add half a bowl of water, a little oil and some chopped green onion and soy sauce to the bowl, mix well and sprinkle a little on the stewed noodles. The noodles made in this way are not dry or woody and have a chewy texture.\n\n\n\n　　”Let’s go buy a TV and a washing machine tomorrow. The backyard is fully equipped so it’s convenient to live here without disturbing anyone.”\n　　”Okay, tomorrow is weekend, let’s go together in the afternoon.”\n　　After May, the weather got warmer day by day, and the whole family went shopping on the weekend. Li Xia and her daughter wore the same thin sweater, and the husband and his sons all wore white shirts and blue waistcoats.\n　　”Mom, everyone is looking at us.”\n　　Hihua was a little shy because she attracted so many attention. But her little brother was different. He was very proud, holding his father with one hand and his brother with the other. He liked the feeling of being noticed.\n　　”Just watch, what are you afraid of, just let them watch openly.”\n　　Huihua smiled, looked around, and whispered to her mother, “Mom, how can you buy clothes of different sizes but the same style? And they look good on me or you, not childish or old-fashioned.”\n　　”I picked out the style after a lot of effort. As for the size, I can just alter the big one to the one that fits you.”\n　　”Ah, adult clothes are more expensive than children’s. You are losing out by doing this, Mom.”\n　　”As expected of my daughter, she knows business as well as she opens her mouth.” She glanced at her daughter, then turned her eyes to the counter. “Is there anything you want to buy?”\n　　“No.” Food, clothing, and daily necessities are all prepared at home. When we go out, we just go shopping and have a delicious meal.\n　　”Mom, there’s a color TV.”\n　　Yiyi saw the TV counter at a glance. Today there were two color TVs on display. The machines were turned on and were playing cartoons.\n　　”The Tales of the Heavenly Book” was broadcast on CTV, and the color TVs clearly displayed its exquisite pictures. The immortals in white Taoist robes, the purple thunderclouds in the sky, the noble vermilion Emperor of Heaven and Taibai Jinxing, and the colorful scenery in the heavenly palace, the world that children like is no longer black and white, and it inspires endless imagination in their hearts.\n　　Yiyi pulled Shen Haiyang to stand in front of the counter without moving, while Shen Hui and HuiHua were also fascinated. Li Xia and her husband looked at each other and simply bought the largest one.\n　　Imported color TVs, imported washing machines, imported refrigerators, when these big guys were unloaded at the gate of the house, all the neighbors were alarmed.\n　　”Xia Xia, you already have a washing machine and a TV at home, why did you buy this?”\n　　”My goodness, what is this tall thing? Why are there two of them?”\n　　The two people who were asking questions were both employees of her steamed bun shop. They all started to help. Feeling that they were exhausted, they started to call their husband at home to come out. While Li Xia was busy unloading the truck, she spoke to everyone.\n　　”The expensive ones are refrigerators. We have one in the backyard. I often can’t take care of my family. With a refrigerator, I can cook at night and put it in. Whenever I want to eat, I can just take it out and heat it up. It’s convenient.”\n　　”Then, why did you buy a TV and a washing machine again? Is your TV this time a color one, or a foreign-language one? Imported? How expensive would it be?”\n　　”I bought this for the backyard. It needs to be fully equipped when my father-in-law comes back.”\n　　”My goodness, how much does this cost?”\n　　”It’s not just about money. Imported goods cannot be purchased without foreign exchange coupons.”\n　　”They have US dollars, so let’s forget about it.”\n　　”Ohh the importance of having a good father.” A teenager started to speak, and his father slapped him in the face as soon as he landed.\n　　”Can you choose your father? It’s all fate. If I could choose, I would like to change my son to one who can get 100 points in the exam.”\n　　”Hey, Haiyang, can you show us this color TV tonight?”\n　　Shen Haiyang was assigned by Li Xia to open the door for everyone, and was not allowed to move such heavy things. Hearing what the neighbor said, he nodded generously.\n　　”Everyone help hold up the antenna, I’ll let it go.”\n　　”Okay.”\n　　Color TV, refrigerator, washing machine, these three major appliances that became popular in the 1990s, they already had them in the early 1980s. And they even had one in the front and back yards. But everyone thought it was Shen Haiyang’s father’s money, and they just envied the couple for having a rich father.\n　　”Xia, you are really generous. You bought two houses for the front and back yards. Even if the old man comes back, won’t one be enough?”\n　　”They are used to living abroad, and these are necessities. The money is theirs, and I am just running errands for them. My TV is black and white, and if you want to watch color, you have to go to the backyard to get it.”\n　　“Foreigners just have money.”\n　　”Of course, they developed earlier than us.” Sister Xu said and turned to the front yard to look at Li Xia’s refrigerator, a double-door refrigerator with a capacity of less than 200. People in later generations thought it was small, but it was definitely a big deal at that time.\n　　”Xia, are you getting this for running errands?”\n　　”yes.”\n　　”That would be great. I wish I had a rich eunuch. I would do nothing all day and serve him as a maid.”\n　　”Don’t worry, we can have everything by ourselves.”\n　　”Oh, it’s easy to talk.”\n　　As the heavy items were carried into the yard, Zhang Qiuhua, who had been hesitant, became more determined to find Li Xia. When the people at the street gate had dispersed and the idle people were crowded in the backyard watching TV, she went into Li Xia’s kitchen.\n　　”Hey, what a rare visitor.”\n　　A neighbor in the same courtyard, this girl had a crush on Shen Haiyang before. She heard that they are now married and they rarely see each other after moving out of the original courtyard.\n　　”I don’t come to you for no reason. I came to you to discuss business with you.”\n　　Li Xia would definitely do a business that makes money. She nodded and poured her a glass of sugar water. “What business? Tell me about it.”\n　　”Assembly of semiconductor components…”\n　　”Don’t.” Li Xia interrupted her before she could finish. “Sister, this is illegal. You may end up in jail. Who told you to do this? You can’t do this if you want to make money.”\n　　”Tsk, Sister Li Xia, I thought you were a trendsetter, why are you so timid? Nowadays, the brave ones will die of overeating while the timid ones will die of starvation. There are so many people who do this kind of thing, but no one has been arrested. Nowadays, all places are developing their economies, and no one cares as long as you can make money.”\n　　Li Xia had been living in the countryside since her divorce in her previous life. She learned about the tide of the times from TV or from people’s conversations. She knew that many people made their fortunes through these side doors, but she was not sure whether any of them had been arrested because of it. But even if she were to start over again, even if she knew how to make money, she still did not plan to try this side door.\n　　”You should find someone else. Oh no, I advise you not to do this. If you want to make money, you can wholesale clothes from me and set up a street stall. Although the money doesn’t come so quickly, it can be considered a side job after get off work and you can make money. Now that the weather is getting warmer, there are many more people setting up street stalls this year than last year…”\n　　”Okay, if you don’t want to do it, I won’t bother you.”\n　　Zhang Qiuhua was a little annoyed and stood up to leave. She thought Li Xia would be willing to do such a lucrative job.\n　　She would have been willing to invest, but who would have thought that she was so timid and only focused on promoting her small clothing business.\n　　”She has no vision at all, she is as timid as a mouse, she would not do a business that can earn money, I wonder what is going on in her mind?”\n　　Zhang Qiuhua rode her bike to Fang Zhongcheng’s workplace while mumbling. Fang Zhongcheng’s mother said Murong Danling was also thinking about doing business. If she went to find her, Murong Danling would definitely not be as timid as Li Xia.\n\n",
    "53": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c34-2/\n—————————————\n　　At Li Xia’s place, she shook her head and sighed after Zhang Qiuhua left. In this era full of changes, many people have made fortunes, many have risen for a while, and many have fallen. The further you go, the more temptations and dangers there are, and the more opportunities there are. It all depends on who can grasp them. She was a small vendor before, and she was thinking about home appliances. The accumulation of time over the past year has calmed her mind.\n　　You can’t be timid and stop moving forward, but you can’t always look at the mountains from the sky. Especially, she will never do things that are on the edge, and she won’t be jealous of others who succeed. She firmly believes that if you often walk by the river, you will get your feet wet. If you have too much luck, you will forget to be respectful, and it will be a matter of time before you fall.\n　　The shop she bought was said to be completed in October and would be officially open before the end of the year. She had decided that the largest shop would still sell clothes. The other two shops would sell shoes, hats, accessories and bedding, and one on the first floor would sell hardware.\n　　All three shops will adopt the wholesale and retail model. This building takes the wholesale route and is determined to build a wholesale base in the provincial capital. As long as she keeps steady, she can make a lot of money in the next 20 years.\n　　She blamed the conflicts with her children in her previous life on the hardship of life, and the hardship of life was all due to lack of money. And Shen Haiyang’s illness, Shen Hui pointed a knife at his biological mother, and his life was ruined. Everything was because of money, so the way to make money must be broad and stable. She didn’t want to be the richest man, she just wants to solve the troubles in life.\n　　”You were so absorbed in your thoughts that you didn’t even hear me calling you twice.”\n　　When she looked up, she saw Shen Haiyang standing at the door. She smiled and wanted to tell him about her future plans, but when she saw there were people in the yard, she shook her head and didn’t mention it.\n　　”Call the children to dinner.”\n　　”we are coming.”\n　　Most people don’t like to watch the news during the news broadcast. The three little ones came to eat during this time, and they all told her how good the color TV was.\n　　”Mom, color TV is much clearer than black and white. Can we buy a color TV too?”\n　　Yiyi, this brat, likes everything good. In her previous life, he only started to like color TV in the millennium, but now it’s only the 1980s and he’s already coveting it.\n　　”No. The money must be saved for Dad’s medical treatment. Otherwise, what will we do if we don’t have money when treatment is available abroad?”\n　　Shen Hui was a thoughtful child who never forgot the important things at home. He had no problem drinking Coke and eating a cake occasionally, but he was not happy about such a big thing.\n　　Li Xia was about to explain to Yiyi when the little one nodded obediently to his brother. “Brother is right, I don’t want a color TV anymore. I want to save the money for Dad’s medical treatment.”\n　　The cute little guy spoke clearly, and his big, usually cunning eyes were now very sincere. It was not a compromise, a perfunctory response, or a flattery. He was really worried about his father, just like his brother.\n　”Good boy, Dad thanks you first.”\n　　”Dad, you must be well. I don’t want to change my dad again. Xiaofang in our kindergarten has a bad dad, and I don’t want to change to a bad dad too.”\n　　The brat’s childish words made people laugh and cry. Li Xia covered her face and was speechless. Is this kid too selfish? Did he recognize Fang Zhongcheng as his father in his previous life just because it was profitable and had nothing to do with blood being thicker than water?\n　　Worried about het younger son, she talked about this with Shen Haiyang at night. “Do you think Yiyi is too… that? Should he be taught a lesson? Where do you think we should start?”\n　　”He used to give you the pocket money he saved, and now he shares anything good with his brothers and sisters. This kid is more cunning and hard-hearted than the other two, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. I will treat anyone who treats me well, and I will get rid of anyone who treats me badly, no matter who they are or what they are to me. This is considered a clear distinction between gratitude and resentment.”\n　　Clearly distinguish between gratitude and resentment? Is that so? Li Xia lay silently thinking about her own thoughts. In her previous life, the brat rebuilt a house for her after she went to college, saying it was a scholarship. In fact, the scholarship was only part of it, and most of the money came from Fang Zhongcheng.\n　　At that time, she was in poor health and often needed to take medicine, and it was not easy for her to work outside. He believed that Fang Zhongcheng could gain connections in the city, and also get money to support her as a mother, and at the same time he would not have to bear the burden of Huihua. Killing three birds with one stone, the brat is profit-seeking but also sentimental.\n　　The mother and son have different styles of doing things. No wonder she and her son always seemed to have a disagreement in her previous life. She was too straightforward. She hated someone so much that she would never accept his help and would never have anything to do with him again. But this brat could put aside love and hate as long as it was beneficial.\n　　”What are you thinking about?”\n　　”effective communication.”\n　　”?”\n　　”Communication, even the closest relationships, can become stagnant without effective communication.”\n　　”Yeah.” Shen Haiyang turned over and hugged her, “So if you have anything to say, tell me. We are a reconstituted family, so we have to face more problems than a natural family. Solve problems when they arise, and don’t let them accumulate.”\n　　”From what I can see now, it seems like we’re getting along well. I’m just worried that your father will come back…”\n　　”It’s okay. I’ll take care of everything.”\n　　”That’s what you said. If your father is difficult to get along with, you are responsible for mediating between us.”\n　　”Okay, I’ll take care of everything.”\n　　As a daughter-in-law, getting along with the man’s parents is a difficult problem. Especially since his father has lived abroad for decades, the huge gap may make it more difficult to get along. But fortunately, there is Shen Haiyang, who has a gentle personality and is good at communication. With him as a bridge, I can get much better.\n　　In the evening, she talked about her father-in-law’s return to China, and the next morning she received a letter from abroad. The old man said he would arrive around June, and she stretched out her hand to count the days. She hurried to prepare all the bedding, pots and pans, thermos, tea sets, and everything else she could think of for the backyard. When he arrived, he could move in directly.\n　　”Mom, this quilt is so soft.”\n　　Yiyi stroked the new quilt for grandpa and put his head on it to feel the softness. Li Xia raised her hand and pulled her son up, giving him a disdainful look.\n　　”Have you washed your hands? Don’t let the new quilt get dirty.”\n　　”I washed it, I washed it.” The little guy stretched out his hand to show her. “It’s so clean, I washed it with soap.”\n　　Huihua also admired the soft quilt and looked up to ask her mother: “This quilt seems different from ours.”\n　　”Yes, this is a silk quilt. It’s made of mulberry silk, thin, warm and breathable.”\n　　”Oh. Mom, is that expensive?”\n　　“Well, it’s quite expensive.”\n　　”It’s great to be a grandfather. I can enjoy so many good things. I want to be a grandfather too.”\n　　”Ha ha……”\n　　Yi Yi’s words made everyone laugh. Li Xia raised her hand and tapped his forehead. “You can’t get all these just by being a grandfather. It’s because grandpa worked hard when he was young that he has all these today. If you want them, you have to work hard too. Otherwise, not only will you not have them when you are old, you will have to beg on the street or starve to death.”\n　　”Oh, I see. Then I will study hard. Dad said that if I study more, I can get into a good university, get a good job, and have a good future.”\n　　Shen Hui smiled and touched his head: “Would you like to compete to see who did better in the exam?”\n　　”Let’s compete. I’m going to start learning mental arithmetic soon, so we can compete at the end of the year.”\n　　”Oh, you’re quite boastful. I’ll wait.”\n　　While talking, she helped to move things to the backyard. The big double bed was covered with a thick new mattress, and on top of it were the pure cotton sheets and pillowcases that Li Xia bought at the Foreign Trade Mall. The quilt was folded neatly on the pillow, and she habitually reached out to smooth the sheets.\n　　”Mom, when Grandpa comes back, can we still come to the backyard and watch the color TV?”\n　　Yi Yi stood in front of the TV and was reluctant to leave. It didn’t matter if he didn’t have other things, but watching cartoons on a color TV was really exciting. If he couldn’t watch them anymore and could only watch black and white, he would feel lost just thinking about it.\n　　Huihua and Shen Hui also turned their heads and looked at their mother with burning eyes, feeling very reluctant to part with the color TV. People are like this, it is easy to go from simple to luxurious, but it is difficult to go from luxurious to simple. It would be fine if they never had a color TV, but after seeing the imported large color TV, they began to dislike the small black and white one.\n　　”That’s going to require us to wait for grandpa to come back and see what his attitude is. Otherwise, shall we also change to a color TV?” She earns a lot of money now, and it’s not that she can’t afford it.\n　　”No, we’ll just watch the black and white one. That’s good. Mom, save the money.”\n　　Shen Hui never forgot his father’s illness. When he said this, Huihua and Yiyi also nodded. The little ones swept away their previous melancholy and started to be happy.\n　　”Many of my classmates don’t have a TV at home. It’s great that we have one.”\n　　”Yes,” Yi Yi agreed with his brother, following his lead. “Many of our kindergarten children also have to go to the neighbors’ houses to watch TV. They all envy me.”\n　　”Mom, I’ll go get some water and wipe the dust off again so that grandpa can see a clean house when he comes back.”\n　　The children were all very sensible, so Li Xia put aside her worries and went to get some water to clean up the house. She and her daughter wiped the dust in the house while Shen Hui and Yi Yi went outside to sweep the yard.\n　　”Xia, Li Xia, someone is looking for you. Your father-in-law is back.”\n　　Just after cleaning, they heard someone shouting outside, and the mother and her two children put down their tools and walked out. She nervously brushed her hair and asked Shen Hui and HuiHua to go to Shen Haiyang’s office to find him.\n　　”Tell Dad that Grandpa is back, and ask him to come back soon.”\n　　”Okay, got it.”\n　　The two children ran to find Shen Haiyang quickly, while Li Xia stood at the street gate, waiting for the Mercedes to slowly open its door. Shen Yaozong got out first, then he opened the passenger seat and helped a gray-haired old man out.\n　　The old man was wearing a moon-white Tai Chi Kung Fu shirt, and his loose cotton trousers were casual and comfortable. Li Xia looked up and was stunned for a moment when she met his face.\n　　They look alike, too alike. These three generations of grandparents and grandchildren practically share the same face. When you see Shen Hui, you know what Shen Haiyang looked like when he was a child. When you see the old man, you know what Shen Haiyang looks like when he is old.\n　　The old man looked nervous and excited, probably because he was more afraid of home. He left when Shen Haiyang was still in belly. It was the first time he saw his son in so many years, and his hands were shaking slightly. His eyes searched around, and then Li Xia took a step forward.\n　　”Hello, I’m Li Xia, your daughter-in-law.”\n　　”Oh, hello, hello.”\n　　The old man had gentle features and a kind demeanor, and Li Xia’s nervousness eased a little. She stepped forward and supported his other arm, and started to introduce the man as they walked in.\n　　”Shen Haiyang was at work and didn’t know you were coming back, so he didn’t pick you up. I asked the kids to call him and he should be back soon. We’ll live in the front yard and the backyard has been cleaned up for you. If you find anything you’re not satisfied with, we’ll fix it up.”\n　　Before they even crossed the alley, Shen Yaozong replied with a sullen face, “What good can there be in the countryside?”\n　　”Yao Zong,”\n　　The old man shouted at him, and the man lowered his head and said nothing, his eyes full of dissatisfaction. The old man smiled at Li Xia, and nodded when he saw the backyard view.\n　　”Good, that’s great. What’s in this big jar?”\n　　”Water lilies. There are water and flowers in the yard, which is pleasing to the eye. Besides, water represents wealth, which is a good omen.”\n　　”Okay, okay, okay, it will be very beautiful when the flowers bloom.”\n　　The old man said three good things and was very satisfied with this courtyard. When he entered the house, the antique furniture and the traditional Chinese style house complemented each other. The Chinese sofa was covered with thick cushions, which was soft and comfortable to sit on.\n　　”Okay, okay, you all put in the effort.”\n　　The old man walked around and looked around. The inner room separated by a partition was set up as a bedroom, and there was an ancient-style bunk bed inside. The misty blue bed curtain was hung with silver hooks at the opening, and the quilt and pillow on the bed were all brand new.\n　　”If you don’t like this kind of bed, there’s a Western-style bed next door. We can change it for you.”\n　　”No, I like it very much.” The old man looked back at her kindly and said, “Thank you, thank you for your hard work. I have no regrets in my life if I can return to such an environment when I am old.”\n　　Li Xia turned around when she heard footsteps. It was indeed Shen Haiyang who came back. The man’s face was a little red as he left, so she quickly poured him a glass of water.\n　　”Don’t be in a hurry, drink some water first.”\n　　Shen Haiyang took the cup, and the father and son, who met for the first time, looked at each other without saying a word. The old man suddenly burst into tears when he saw his son, and raised his outstretched hand and then put it down.\n　　Li Xia extended her hand to call the children over. She smiled at the old man and introduced the children to him first.\n　　Calm down and don’t get so excited.\n　　”This is Shen Hui, your grandson.” As he spoke, he pulled Shen Hui to his grandfather. The old man held his grandson’s hand and smiled kindly, looking up at the siblings. “This is Huihua and Yiyi, right?”\n　　”Yes.” After answering, she urged the children: “Call grandpa quickly.”\n　　”Hello, Grandpa.”\n　　”Hello, Grandpa.”\n　　”Hello, Grandpa. I’m Shen Ruyi.”\n　　The brat was not at all stage-frightened and started to introduce himself. He emphasized the word “Shen” the most and told the old man of the Shen family that his surname was also Shen.\n　　”Haha,” As expected, the old man laughed out loud at his joke, holding his little grandson’s hand with his other hand. “Okay, you are all good kids.”\n　　The old man took the child and sat down on the sofa, then looked up and asked Shen Yaozong for his bag. “Take out all the gifts I prepared for the children and see if they like them.”\n　　Yiyi is the youngest and doesn’t seem to know what it means to be embarrassed. He can make people happy as soon as he opens his mouth: “We like whatever gift grandpa gives us.”\n　　Shen Hui and HuiHua said nothing, feeling ashamed of their brother’s flattery. The two older children knew more and were more aware of being shy, while HuiHua was trying to pull his younger brother to restrain himself.\n　　Shen Yaozong opened the suitcase on the ground, and the old man excitedly took out gifts for his grandchildren. For Huihua, it was an exquisite doll and a set of watercolors, for Yiyi, it was an airplane and a tank model, and Shen Hui’s was the same as Yiyi’s.\n　　”How is it? Do you like it? If you are not satisfied, grandpa will take you to the mall another day and we will buy whatever you like.”\n　　”We like it grandpa.”\n　　The children were very sensible and spoke in unison. The first meeting between the grandparents and grandchildren seemed very harmonious. After receiving the gifts, the children went to play, and the old man’s eyes returned to Shen Haiyang again.\n　　Shen Haiyang drank some water and his complexion returned to normal. Seeing the old man looking at him, he took a few steps in his direction, stopped in front of him, and nodded to him.\n　　”Hello,”\n　　In the end, he didn’t call him that name, but the simple greeting made the old man burst into tears. He stood up from the sofa and patted his shoulder.\n　　”Okay, okay, I’m sorry, I’m sorry for you and your son…”\n　　The old man choked up and couldn’t go on. Shen Haiyang handed him a handkerchief and said comfortingly: “It’s all in the past, don’t worry about it.”\n　　The father and son met for the first time, and after the excitement, they expressed their feelings for each other. The old man insisted on visiting the grave of Shen Haiyang’s mother that afternoon, so the whole family had to accompany him to the cemetery.\n　　Shen Yaozong barely touched his chopsticks for lunch, and was determined not to go on the afternoon trip. He thought they couldn’t go if he didn’t come to drive. As a result, Shen Haiyang drove everyone away, and he was so angry that he stamped his feet in the yard.\n　　No matter how unhappy he was, the old man was very satisfied with this place. Seeing that his plan to return to his home country to settle down and retire could not be changed, he was annoyed but helpless.\n　　”Calm down and observe carefully. How old are you and yet you are so impetuous?”\n　　After being scolded by the old man early in the morning, Shen Yaozong stood at the door of the east wing and rolled his eyes silently. “There is a saying in Chinese that goes ‘love the new and hate the old.’ You have a new son, so you don’t like your old son, right?”\n　　”If you don’t want to stay, just leave.”\n　　”Dad, I grew up by your side. Are you really just trying to make up for your eldest son, as Annie said?”\n　　”You,” the old man pointed at him with a look of disappointment. “It’s because I doted on you too much that you became so indecisive and arrogant.”\n　　Being belittled by his father again, Shen Yaozong was even more furious. He put down the toothbrush cup and stood up and left the yard. Seeing Li Xia busy in the kitchen in the front yard, he looked disdainful and left quickly.\n　　Because no suitable nanny was found in the past two days, Li Xia took time to take care of the old man. For breakfast, steamed buns, wontons, tofu brain and a few side dishes were prepared. When they were served, the old man was very satisfied.\n　　”Why is second brother out yet? Is he not used to Chinese food?”\n　　”Don’t worry about him.”\n　　She was happy to hear him say that. He is so old that he will not starve himself. Moreover, even if he is really not used to Chinese food, she can’t do anything about it. After all, she can’t cook Western food. She is just being polite.\n　　Just asking, no other meaning.\n　　”Dad, can I ask you something?”\n　　The old man raised his head with the spoon in his hand and said, “We are all family, no need to be so polite.”\n　　”Oh, that’s right. Are there any treatments for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy abroad now?”\n　　”Is it Haiyang?” He knew that this disease was hereditary.\n",
    "54": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c35/\n” Yes .”\nThe old man closed his eyes upon hearing this, and when he opened them again, his cloudy eyes were full of heartache. He himself had this problem, and he had suffered for so many years. He didn’t expect that this son, whom he had never raised for a day, would also have heart disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was inherited from him.\n“I heard that they are studying it, and the current surgery results are very good.”\n“So, that means there is no cure yet, right?”\n“right.”\nDuring this period, science and technology in all aspects developed rapidly. Li Xia was not discouraged after hearing this. She took a deep breath to cheer herself up, and she picked up a bun for the old man with chopsticks.\n“You have experience. If it can be treated, would the cost be very high?”\n“Don’t worry about the cost. As long as it can be cured, I have accumulated experience over the years, and it is not a problem to cure a disease.” The old man sighed helplessly: “Child, please take care of him. This disease needs to be treated well; otherwise, if it worsens, the consequences will be disastrous.”\n“I know.” After saying this, Li Xia took out a bag from her back and opened it to reveal several stacks of cash. “This is the remaining money from the house renovation. I exchanged it for foreign exchange certificates. This is a kind of money equivalent to currency, and it is more popular than currency. Only this can be used to shop in the foreign trade mall; ordinary currency cannot be used.”\nThe old man looked down at the paper, then smiled and said he could understand this way of shopping. He had been doing business for half his life, so he knew why it was so without any explanation.\nHe raised his hand and pushed the cash back to her. “Thank you for taking the trouble to help me find a house, renovate it, and prepare all this. I’m not short of money, so you don’t have to calculate it so clearly with me.”\n“Brothers should settle accounts clearly. Besides, this is not a small amount. This amount of money is equivalent to several decades of salary for an ordinary worker in the mainland. It is enough to buy another house like this.”\n“Then keep it as the cost of you taking care of me. I will need your help when I am old. Thank you in advance.”\nDaughter-in-law and father-in-law, the relationship is supposed to be very close. But Li Xia spoke politely but with a hint of unfamiliarity. There was even an account book on the cash, clearly recording every expense of the house renovation. The old man had a gentle look and a kind attitude, repeatedly emphasizing the need to get closer, and Li Xia naturally felt it.\nHe had previously gifted Shen Haiyang and his mother a sum of US$50,000, which she had invested, so she naturally appreciated the old man’s kindness. She had originally planned to take care of him in his later years, but she didn’t dare get too familiar with him for the time being. The old man said so, and she smiled and zipped up her bag.\n“Dad, I’ll keep the money for now. If you need it, you can always ask me for it.”\nThe old man nodded and said nothing more to her. Yaozong always felt that the couple prepared a house for him because they wanted his property, so he could understand why Li Xia did this.\n“I heard that you are in the clothing business now?”\n“Yes. I used the US dollars you sent Haiyang to buy the courtyard house and the shop…”\nEven though she knew he was Shen Haiyang’s biological father, it was only natural for a biological father to give money to his biological son. If she gave money to the three children in the family, she would think it was normal. The elderly had money to support the children, and as a younger generation, it was all right for them to take care of and respect them.\nBut she always felt strange in front of the old man and felt short of breath unconsciously. This was just a test. If he had any regrets, she would find a way to raise money to pay him back as soon as possible.\n“Alas,” the old man sighed softly. The affection he had felt since childhood was not something he could buy with money. “What did you call me just now?”\nLi Xia was stunned for a moment and replied, “Dad.”\n“I know money can’t make up for anything, but I’m old, and I don’t have anything else except money.”\nLi Xia bit her lip and said nothing. She couldn’t respond. The old man took a sip from the cup and looked at her with a smile. “Thank you for accompanying her on her last journey. I feel sorry for her in this life. If she didn’t feel at ease before she passed away and there was no one to see her off, I…”\nAre you feeling guilty? When Li Xia saw him, she thought of Fang Zhongcheng. The same irresponsibility ruined his wife’s life.\nFang Zhongcheng felt guilty when he saw her weather-beaten appearance again many years later, but what could a belated apology make up for?\nOf course, the old man had historical reasons. He could not care about other things when his life was in danger, and he did not know his wife was pregnant. Fang Zhongchengg was a complete scumbag. He kicked her away after using her. He knew that she was a woman with two children in the countryside, but he did not care about her for more than ten years. He only remembered her when his own child died.\n“What my mother is most worried about is Haiyang. He is sick again.”\nWhether you feel guilty or something else, the old lady has let it go in the end. As long as it is good for the child, she doesn’t care. In this case, you should find a way to help Shen Haiyang get treated. You must have connections abroad and US dollars in your hands over the years. If you want to make up for it, please take care of it. Thank you very much.\n“I wrote to my friend in the United States, asking him to pay attention to the development in this area. Once the technology breaks through and can be used for treatment, I will arrange for you to go abroad.”\nLi Xia stood up and bowed to him solemnly. “Thank you.”\nCarrying the bag of cash out of the backyard, she smiled silently and felt that her move was very scheming, taking advantage of the old man’s guilt to achieve her own goal.\n“It doesn’t matter whether you are a philistine or not. It’s childish for an adult to give up opportunities for unnecessary things.”\nShe is also seeking benefits and avoiding harm. When she saw Yiyi at night, her eyes were full of smiles. The little guy grew up in a single-parent family in his previous life and suffered a lot of ridicule all the way to a key university. When he recognized Fang Zhongcheng, he was thinking about benefits, right?\n“Mom, why are you looking at me? I was very good today. I didn’t fight with other kids. If you don’t believe me, ask Dad to see if the teacher said anything.”\nThe brat was quite sensitive, so Li Xia gave him a glare and told him to eat quickly. After she sat down, she said to Shen Haiyang, “I just delivered food to the backyard, and Shen Yaozong went out this morning and hasn’t come back yet.”\n“What’s going on? Is he having a quarrel with the old man?”\n“I don’t know. Go to the backyard to accompany the old man at night. You can’t leave him alone.”\n“We’ll talk about it later.”\nThis man looks gentle, but why is he so awkward with his biological father? They are respectful to each other on weekdays, but it is difficult to get closer. When she asked him to accompany his father at night, he immediately looked resistant.\nReason is one thing; he knew that he was his biological father. Emotion is another; he wanted to get close to him but couldn’t, and even subconsciously felt awkward.\nLi Xia knew that it takes time to cultivate feelings, but now that Shen Yaozong has gone away, the old man can’t just be left alone. After dinner, a middle-aged woman came and wanted to apply for the job of the old man’s nanny. The couple looked at Han Jun’s wife, Qin Mu, and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. They asked her to sit down first, and Li Xia stood up and poured her a glass of water.\n“Huihua, go to Grandpa’s place and collect the dishes. Mom is here to talk to Auntie about something.”\n“Okay.”\nThe child obediently went to the backyard, and Shen Haiyang also got up and left. She sat down to talk to the woman. “Sister, what happened?”\nAs soon as she said this, the woman couldn’t hold back her tears.\n” Han Jun said that he was the only one who earned money in the family for so many years. I have been taking care of his paralyzed mother since I entered his house. I am busy every day after having a child. I have to take care of the old and the young, and I have to serve him. How can I… am I worthless?”\nThe woman wiped her tears and continued, “Since what I do at home is worthless, if I come out to do this and make money, then will I have value?”\n“Han Jun deserves to be beaten for saying that. Just looking at his family’s mess, how much money would it cost to have a nanny take care of them for so many years? You did it all silently; is he blind and can’t see it?”\n“That’s why I came to you. I know you’re looking for a nanny for your father-in-law. Don’t worry, I can do this job. I’ve been doing laundry, cooking, and taking care of people for so many years. I’m also a pretty good cook, and I promise to take good care of the old man for you.”\n“So, what about your family?”\nThough I feel sorry for her, if I really take her in, wouldn’t that be like venting Lao Han’s anger? Lao Han did something wrong, and it’s OK to help mediate the conflict between husband and wife instead of cutting off the fire and leaving people in the cold.\n“He has already said that to me. I don’t care this time. I am an adult now, and I don’t need him to support me.”\nAs the two were talking, Han Jun came running in from outside in a hurry. The couple had an argument. Why are you coming here to tell my sister-in-law ? Come on, come home with me.”\nHan Jun said he was going to catch his wife, but the woman turned away. “I won’t go back. If someone else pays me for the work I do at home, I can still make money.”\n“I didn’t say you couldn’t make money; I always…”\nHan Jun looked annoyed, probably regretting his decision. He was under great financial pressure, and perhaps he spoke without thinking in a hurry. Li Xia quietly withdrew and gave the two of them space.\nThrough the window, she saw the man bending over with an apologetic look on his face, probably trying to make amends with his wife. Li Xia was watching with great interest when Shen Haiyang came out of the house and stood behind her.\n“What are you looking at? You look so excited.”\n“Hush, look at how Han Jun apologizes to his wife.”\nShe pulled her husband to hide in a corner to watch the show and whispered to him about the matter. The couple agreed that Han Jun was wrong, and when he coaxed his wife out to say goodbye, he was squeezed by Li Xia.\n“She has been taking care of the old and the young for so many years. It’s not that she has no job. She just has no salary.”\n“I was wrong. Don’t worry, sister-in-law, I won’t say this again.”\n“Remember what you said? If you do that again, I will find a job for your sister-in-law and see what your family will do then.”\nHan Jun nodded and bowed. “Sister-in-law, please forgive me. Without her at home, the world will fall apart and everything will be in chaos.”\n“That’s good to know.”\nAfter seeing the couple off, Li Xia at the gate shook her head and said, “It would be great if Qin Mu could free up her hands. Even if she can help us for a while, we can slowly find a suitable person. When the shop opens, let her sell goods, which can also increase her family’s income.”\n“Let’s look for it later; don’t worry now.”\n“Shen Yaozong hasn’t come back yet.”\nShen Haiyang sighed: “I’ll go to the backyard to accompany him at night.”\n“What do you think happened between the father and son? Why don’t you ask the old man tonight?”\n“Do not ask.”\nShen Haiyang seemed gentle, but he was actually quite stubborn. He kept his distance from his biological father. At night, he and the old man lived in the backyard, one on each side. The father and son treated each other with respect.\nLi Xia was eager to sell her goods, but she couldn’t find a suitable nanny. An applicant came in the morning. She was good at cleaning, but the food she cooked was really rough. She couldn’t like the food, let alone the old man.\nAt noon, she made noodles with soybean paste and served them to the old man with some cold dishes. She asked, “Dad, where is your second brother?”\nThe old man shook his head and said he didn’t know. “I can handle it here by myself. There’s no need for Haiyang to come over to accompany me at night. The front and back yards are so close. If there’s anything, I can just call you.”\nThe couple separated on purpose. Was the old man upset? She thought for a moment and said, “How about letting Shen Hui and Yiyi come to accompany you? Children are lively, but I’m afraid they will disturb your peace.”\nThe old man waved his hand. “I wish my children were happy. It would be my blessing to have grandchildren around me in my old age.”\n“Then I’ll clean up the west side and let them live there. If anything happens, just call them.”\nThe old man likes to have his grandsons around, and the two boys like to have a color TV at their grandfather’s place. This solves the problem of companionship to everyone’s satisfaction.\nWhile worrying about finding a nanny, Han Jun’s mother suddenly suffered a stroke and was sent to the hospital but could not be saved. The old lady passed away quickly, and the funeral was also done quickly in the hot weather. When the old lady died, Qin Mu told Li Xia that she wanted to work for her.\n“Do you mind if I wear mourning clothes?”\n“That’s okay. I welcome you to come. But does Han Jun agree?”\nHe and Shen Haiyang were classmates; would he be unhappy about his wife coming to help out at his classmate’s house? But in fact, Li Xia hoped that Qin Mu could go out and earn money. A woman’s financial independence and not being independent are two completely different concepts.\nLet’s not talk about anything else. Just say that if you want to buy something you like, you can earn your own money. But the family is not well-off, and they dare not even buy a bottle of good vanishing cream. The economy is a very realistic problem. Men who can say nice things are nothing more than making big promises, saying that they are wronged now, and they will do this and that when they have money in the future. Like Han Jun, he can’t even make big promises. He just starts with the reality that he earns money alone and owes a lot of debt. His straightforward words can make you angry to death.\n“Why would he be unhappy? When I graduated from junior high school, I didn’t have a stable job, and now I have even less. It’s great to have a job and earn money.”\nHan Jun happened to come in and heard it, and he had no objection to his wife going to help out at her friend’s house. What kind of nanny is not good? Didn’t he see that Li Xia was afraid that people would mind, and she kept saying it was help? The family has been financially tight for so many years, and they owe money for their mother’s medical treatment and funeral. He tried to pay off the debt, and he took the children to eat in the cafeteria. At least his wife can buy what she likes with her own money. Buy some good clothes, creams, etc., and buy more.\nOh, he is still incompetent. If the family had money, there would be no need to argue about money. This guy is still like this. He doesn’t know at all that his wife still cares about what he said about him being the only one earning money in the family. He thinks his wife is angry that he doesn’t have money to buy her dress. But it was that she kept his words of earning alone in her mind and hence wanted to earn money herself so that she could keep him shut about the money.\nIn less than a week, the problem of finding a nanny for the old man was solved. Qin Mu was very careful in her work, and her cooking skills were also to the old man’s taste. Let’s do this first. When her shop opens, if Qin Mu wants to go to the shop, she will be arranged to sell things. During this time, the family can slowly look for a suitable person.\nLi Xia went to the stall without any worries. After a busy day, she returned home and found that there was a piano in her house. The big white piano was placed in the west wing of the backyard. The three children stood there and played with it.\n“Where did you get this? Don’t play with it like this. What if you break it? This thing is not cheap.”\nThe old man was sitting in a rocking chair in the yard, drinking tea. Hearing this, he said, “It’s okay; let the children play.”\nIt seems that this thing was brought by the old man, and Li Xia stopped caring about it after he said so. It seems that her daughter is quite interested in it. If the child likes it, it is a good idea to find a teacher to teach it seriously.\n“Dad, did you decide this a long time ago?”\n“Yes. Music can cultivate one’s sentiments, and learning the piano can cultivate one’s temperament. Find a teacher for each of the three of them, and I’ll pay for it.”\n“Okay, I’ll do it for them.\n“Thank you, Grandpa.”\nIs this because he has a bad relationship with his son and wants to train his grandchildren in his later years? Recently, the three children have gone to the backyard to watch color TV every night, and their relationship with their grandfather has improved by leaps and bounds.\nJust as she was complaining about the old man, a visitor came to the courtyard. The leader of the Provincial Investment Promotion Office came to visit the old man in person. The old man stood up and invited the guest into the house, and Qin Mu hurried to make tea.\nAfter some polite conversation, the people in the room got down to business, and Li Xia realized that her father-in-law was an entrepreneur overseas. The investment promotion office invited the old man to attend the investment promotion conference next week and persuaded him to invest on the mainland.\n“We are in need of returned overseas Chinese like Mr. Shen. I have wanted to visit you for a long time, but I was afraid of disturbing your family reunion, so I have delayed it until now. Our country is now in a state of disrepair, and it is time for people with lofty ideals to show their talents.”\n“Thank you for the invitation. I will definitely go then.”\nShen Xiao nodded with a smile, and Li Xia realized that the old man’s return to China might not just be a return to his hometown to retire. This period was the golden period of domestic development, and many people made their fortunes with this favorable wind. Especially for those who have a certain foundation and use money to invest to make money, as long as the project is chosen correctly, there is no loss.\nShe sent the people from the investment promotion office away on behalf of her father-in-law, and when they went, the old man asked her if she was willing to go with him. “You want to develop, and it would be good to go out and see the world.”\nLi Xia nodded obediently. She really had not seen much of the world. On such occasions, getting to know more people might be useful in the future. Personal connections are very important in China, a society where relationships are important.\nA few days later, the telecom people came to install the phone. Li Xia then knew that the old man had applied for international long-distance calls, and she couldn’t help but sigh that it was good to have money.\n“When we apply for a phone within the same province, we have to wait in line for a long time. But the international long-distance number that the old man applied for was approved so quickly.”\nShen Haiyang nodded and sighed: “If we are bolder and move faster, the result of deepening reform will be like blowing up a balloon. Perhaps the changes in the next few years will exceed those in the previous decades.”\nLi Xia had seen this result in her previous life, so naturally she had no doubts. “I was planning to apply for domestic long-distance calls, but now that the old man has international long-distance calls, do you think I should still apply?”\n“…Don’t apply.”\n“Okay, I’ll find time to undo it.”\n",
    "55": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c35-2/\nThe international long-distance call in the backyard was quickly connected, and the old man told Li Xia to use it if she needed it. On Tuesday, someone from the investment promotion office drove to pick them up, and she followed the old man to the investment promotion office.\nA group of returned overseas Chinese sat down to drink tea and chat. After a conversation, they were led by the investment promotion office to inspect various places. The investment environment in the provincial capital made the bigwigs frown. Not to mention anything else, the roads alone were full of potholes.\nIf you want to get rich, you must build roads first. No matter what you invest in, you can’t avoid transportation. The transportation conditions are really disappointing. The people in the investment promotion office also saw this and quickly explained that the road construction work would start immediately.\n“We have already applied for it. Once the approval comes from above, construction will start immediately. Don’t have any doubts about the road. The new document from above has already indicated that the first livelihood project to be implemented is road construction.”\nEven so, some people still shook their heads and said they couldn’t believe it. It was because there hadn’t been much change in the country for many years, which made these people feel unsure. But Li Xia knew that in the next few decades, the mainland would undergo earth-shaking changes. Cities would look different every few years, and if you went away for three years and came back, you might not be able to find a place.\nSome state-owned factories and some small factories with subsidiaries were accompanied by leaders, all of whom wanted to get investment. Everyone walked and looked; the old man never spoke, and Li Xia followed behind him and just nodded to everyone. She was wearing a dress today, with her hair tied behind her head, and everyone thought she was the old man’s assistant or secretary.\nA man couldn’t get a word in with the big guys, so he rushed to offer her water to get close to her. Li Xia smiled and waved her hands, indicating that she didn’t care about it, so he shouldn’t waste his time.\nBut the other party obviously didn’t believe it and treated her very attentively along the way. During lunch, he heard her calling the old man “Dad,”  and this time he kept chasing her. I thought she was a secretary, but it turned out to be a daughter.\nNot much investment was made that day, and the old man looked around and didn’t invest in any factories. The man opened a paint factory and urgently needed funds to turn it around. He couldn’t get money from others, so he turned to Li Xia.\n“Madam, this is the information about my factory. I am not exaggerating. The paint is next fortune. There is definitely a lot to be done.”\n“I’m very sorry, but I have no say in this matter. It’s useless for you to tell me all this.”\nThe man was a little frustrated after being rejected. He worked hard all day but didn’t make any investments. He left in the afternoon feeling dejected. He looked back at Li Xia, who said she couldn’t help him. The development of paint is not something that can be achieved in a short time, from heavy odors to various non-toxic products. The old man is obviously not interested in this.\nWhen returning, most people brought their own cars and drivers. Shen Yaozong gave up the responsibility of the old man, so the business office drove them. An old lady with gray hair accidentally tripped when getting on the car, and Li Xia quickly reached out to help her.\n“thanks, thanks,”\nDue to inertia, she was pushed by the old lady and bumped into the car. The old lady was fine, and she thanked her repeatedly. Seeing that her arm was scratched, she said she would take her to the hospital.\n“It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s just a small cut. I’ll go home and apply some red medicine to it, and it will heal quickly.”\nSeeing her sincerity, the old lady smiled and said nothing more. She took out a business card from her bag and handed it to her. “You can contact me anytime if you need anything.”\nThe chairman of Xingchen International, Ms. Li. What kind of company is this? Li Xia has not heard of it because she has little knowledge of it. But those who can come here today are all well-known people. Whether this relationship is useful or not, she will nod with a smile. Make good relationships in the business world.\nAfter sending Ms. Li to the car, she followed the old man to another car. After getting off the car, the old man shook his head and said that the car of a department in the provincial capital was really not very good.\nLi Xia helped him walk home, and the door to the backyard was opened from behind. The old man’s brand new Cadillac was parked in the garage. Seeing that she didn’t say anything, the old man continued.\n“Have you ever thought about learning to drive? Cars are definitely indispensable for future development. Do you plan to always use a tricycle every time you have so much cargo?”\n“I’ve already signed up.”\nThis time, the old man showed an approving look. The scrutiny from this elder put Li Xia under great pressure. She herself had a low level of education, a low family background, and little knowledge of reality. Most of what she knew came from TV. In her new life, she wanted to rely on her foresight to make money first. But why did the old man seem to be giving her some advice? Did she look like a talented person with great potential?\nShe thought that home appliances would definitely make money in this era, but that was only a prediction from her past life. She only had a few dollars now, and home appliances were basically monopolized by state-owned shopping malls. She wanted to sell home appliances, but the timing was not right and the conditions were not ripe. However, selling clothes was going well, which gave her the idea of opening a clothing factory. But she knew that the clothing business would become more and more difficult, so this was just an idea, and she had not made a final decision.\nThinking about their own things, the two of them went into the backyard and sat down in the main room. Qin Mu made tea for them. The old man leaned against the sofa and closed his eyes to rest. Li Xia drank a sip of water and was about to say goodbye and leave when he spoke.\n“We’ve inspected so many things today. What do you think is the most promising investment?”\n“electronic.”\nThe current electronics market is dominated by traditional home appliances such as televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines, and the domestic market alone is huge. Mobile phones became popular after the millennium, and the development of that thing was even faster. BB machines seemed to disappear just as they became popular and were replaced by mobile phones.\nBefore she was reborn, she had seen mobile phones such as the Big Brother on TV and had seen the mobile phone in Fang Zhongcheng’s hand. It was a black flip phone, much smaller than the Big Brother. However, the signal in the village was not good, and the children said that this thing was very popular in the city.\n“Is it better to make end-of-line accessories or finished products?”\n“Of course we can make finished products if we have the ability. We can make black-and-white TVs for at least another ten years, and the replacement of color TVs can continue.”\nLi Xia suddenly stopped talking. She was a rural woman, and her words made people suspicious. The old man looked at her with an unchanged expression, as if he was not disturbed at all.\n“There are no suitable existing manufacturers for the electronics business, so we have to start from scratch.”\nIs he planning to invest in an electronics factory? The investment in this business is not small. How much money does the old man have? He had already calculated it when he planned to return to China. It can’t be a sudden whim.\n“I don’t understand this.”\nThe old man smiled and said, “Isn’t there a night school now?”\nNight school? At her age, she is learning how to manage a business. Is this too difficult? She only wanted to sell home appliances, do home appliance distribution, and produce electronic products.\nShe didn’t understand at all and shouldn’t have been so quick to say that. In the 1990s, electronics was dominated by Japanese capital, and all the famous brands seemed to have some Japanese capital. Did the old man also have a joint venture with a Japanese company?\n“This is an era of change. If you don’t handle it right, you will be washed away by the waves on the beach.”\nThe old man saw that she had ambitions, but she really didn’t think she could do them. Being a regional general agent for home appliance distribution and striving for more brands was the biggest platform she felt she could handle.\nThose who do this and that to make money are just her talk. Running a business is not like selling goods back and forth. She knows the future development of selling goods back and forth and just buys and sells. Running a business is not that easy. Many factories established in the 1980s were finished in the 1990s and swallowed up by large enterprises, and the brands disappeared.\nIt has only been such a short time, and she feels that she has not made much progress, yet the old man actually suggests that she go to school.\n“Let me see.”\nShe walked out of the backyard with heavy steps, as if a heavy burden had been placed on her shoulders. Qin Mu was cooking in the kitchen, and she stared blankly at the pomegranate tree in the yard.\n“Mom, what are you looking at?”\nHuihua came in with her schoolbag, and she subconsciously raised her hand to help her child carry the schoolbag. The heavy feeling in her hand made her realize that she wanted to give her children a good life again, but the most important knowledge, the most critical thing in life, still needed them to work hard to obtain.\nThe children were all carrying heavy burdens and moving forward, learning the skills to make a living so that they could live better in the future. How could she, as a mother, stand still and be complacent with her knowledge of her past life? She would soon be eliminated by the times.\n“I’m thinking about signing up for night school.”\n“Mom, are you going to night school?” The little girl looked at her mother with admiration and said, “Mom, you are awesome! After you graduate from night school, you can be a college student.”\nLi Xia smiled awkwardly. As a college student, these three words were far from her; she had never dared to think about them. “Do you want to learn piano? If you like, mom will find a teacher for you. But let’s make it clear that playing a musical instrument requires self-discipline and hard practice. If you like it and are willing to spend time practicing, then we will learn. If you are not interested, mom is too busy to supervise you, and I am afraid you will not learn well.”\n“I like it. Mom, does it cost a lot to learn piano?”\n“Don’t worry about the money. Our family can afford it. What you need to consider are your hobbies. If you like them, take the time to learn and practice. As the old saying goes, it’s good to have many skills. The more you know, the wider your future will be.”\n“Then I’ll learn. I was just worried about spending too much money. My brother will go to college if he studies well, but I won’t study well, so I’ll learn something else. I heard that having talents can add extra points to the college entrance examination. Maybe I can go to college with these in the future.”\n“Mom will buy you another violin. See which one you like. These can indeed add points to the college entrance examination. If you are interested in one, study hard. You can apply to the music department or the fine arts department in the future. With the foundation accumulated since childhood, there will be no problem.”\n“thanks Mom.”\nThe child actually knew whether the family was well-off or not. If it were in her previous life, she would never have mentioned these things to Li Xia. She knew her mother’s hard work and her mother’s difficulties. But in this life, with Shen Haiyang, the house was spacious, and the family’s living standard was not inferior to that of their classmates and was even higher, so the child felt relieved.\nIt was decided that the child would learn a musical instrument, and she discussed these matters with Shen Haiyang that night. “Do you think a night school can accept someone like me ?”\nShen Haiyang was in college during the chaos, so he didn’t learn much. After he was transferred to the procuratorate, he took a unified training course.\n“If you don’t have to pass an exam to get a diploma, then it shouldn’t be too strict. What level did you reach in junior high school? Did you learn functions?”\n“No. Our place is a small place, and the teachers are not very good. In addition, in those years, school classes were often labor classes. Later, everyone basically went home. Since it was labor, it would be better to go home and earn work points.”\n“I’ll go with you to sign up; let’s see how it goes first.” Shen Haiyang smiled and said, “Don’t worry, just ask me if you have any doubt; I’ll help you with some lessons at home.”\nLi Xia sighed, feeling the pressure. “Also, please help the children find a music teacher to teach piano.”\n“Okay, I’ll talk to the kids in detail.”\nShen Haiyang did what he said. That night, after talking to the three children, they decided to let all three learn piano. Now the three children are still young, so let them learn first to see if they have talent. If possible, cultivate them well. If they are mediocre, they can also develop talents in the future.\nHe asked for teachers for the children, and Li Xia signed up for night school. For business administration, she was a little scared when she heard the high-sounding name. The other party was also scared when they heard her level, but she didn’t require a certain level after completing the course, so they accepted her reluctantly.\nAfter paying the fees and receiving the books, she was told that the class would start on Saturday night. She bought herself a pen and a notebook. After so many years, she started studying again. These things were still heavy in her hands.\nWhen she got home, Shen Haiyang said he had found a piano teacher for the children. “She’s a working music teacher, a woman in her early 40s. Not many people are willing to let their children learn musical instruments these days, and piano is even rarer, so she only has three students from our family. Oh, and her little daughter is also learning, so there are four of them in total. For two hours each on Saturday and weekend nights, her home is not far to the east of ours.”\n“Okay, let them study for a while first and see. But I have to go to school on Saturdays and Sundays, so you have to pick up the kids when they come back.”\n“Leave it to me.” Shen Haiyang smiled and casually flipped through the books she received today: “From now on, your focus should be to study hard, and I will provide you with logistics support.”\n“I don’t know what I’ll learn yet.”\n“Don’t be discouraged; you have to encourage yourself. You are a role model for the children; you have to work hard.”\n“Yeah, I will.”\nOn Saturday afternoon, the children had a day off, so Li Xia closed her stall and went home early. In the evening, everyone went to study, and she sat in the classroom with her hands shaking unconsciously.\nDon’t be afraid. After more than a decade of accumulation, when you are big enough, your children will graduate from college. If you can’t do it, you still have your children. Huihui is so smart that he can always take over. Because she knows that many local tycoons who can’t keep up with the times have gone bankrupt in the later period, she can’t help but feel nervous.\nShe comforted herself silently in her heart, and after calming down, she realized that she did not completely fail to understand. She wrote down the parts she understood in her notebook and marked the parts she did not understand in the book so that she could study them slowly when she had time.\nA class lasted two hours, and time passed quickly because she was so absorbed in listening. After leaving, she lowered her head and recalled what she had just learned. She accidentally bumped into someone, so she quickly looked up and said.\n“Sorry, I……”\nIt turned out to be Murong Danling, who was carrying a handbag and looked surprised when she saw her. Li Xia also felt that it was really a narrow road for enemies to meet on the main road in such a big provincial capital.\n“You, are you in school?”\nLi Xia didn’t want to answer this question. She had already apologized for bumping into her without noticing, so she said sorry again and turned away.\nShe quickly got on her tricycle and disappeared on the road. Murong Danling was very angry at her attitude. “What’s so great about you? You’re just a country girl. When my business becomes big, I’ll pin you down and see if you can still be so arrogant.”\nLi Xia had already walked away, so she naturally didn’t know the woman’s expression of expecting a good show. She looked down at her newly bought bag with a smug look on her face.\n“Humph, that’s no big deal. I can live a good life on my own.”\nLi Xia arrived home soon. The bun shop in the front yard was brightly lit, and she was watching TV, but the yard was dark. She went into the house, turned on the light, took out the book, and carefully recalled what she had just learned. The knowledge filled her mind. She was reading the book, and soon Shen Haiyang came back with the three children.\nThe father and his two sons were happily discussing the piano. Huihua was eager to practice but was stopped by Shen Hui.\n“The provincial TV station is broadcasting Hong Kong movies at this time. Let’s go and watch TV first and practice the piano tomorrow.”\nGrandpa was about to go to bed at this time, and practicing the piano would disturb the neighbors next door. Huihua nodded, and the three little ones ran to the backyard to watch TV without going into the house.\n",
    "56": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c36/\nCHAPTER 36\nChildren are busy studying and attending extracurricular classes. Most children of this age play during the holidays, but her family is all learning talents. Especially Yiyi, who started learning mental arithmetic after the New Year. Even before entering elementary school, he can do addition and subtraction within 100 with ease.\nâYiyi is a very smart child. He understands everything the teacher says very quickly. Although he is young, he has a very good memory and comprehension. He is also very talented at the piano. He is a few years younger than the other two, but his hands are very flexible, and he has a very good grasp of rhythm. But he is a little lazy. He always needs the other two to coax and praise him before he is willing to study hard.â\nDuring this period, Shen Haiyang was responsible for picking up and dropping off the children for their interest classes and reporting the childrenâs situation to Li Xia in a timely manner. In the late evening, the sunset glowed half the sky red. The two chatted and washed clothes in the yard. Their lives were rich, and their faces were calm. Especially Li Xia, since her life was changed, her eyes were much brighter than before.\nâThis brat needs to be pushed. He wants to slack off when his life is too comfortable. Since he has talent, let him do it. He should not give up mental arithmetic or piano.â\nThe school curriculum during this period was much more relaxed than in later generations, and it was not so demanding. If the academic workload was relaxed, then, of course, one had to learn some talents if possible. In her previous life, she had heard behind her back that Yiyi had told his sister that he did not know how to participate in any activities held at school and that he envied those talented classmates.\nThe brat clearly loves to show off but is too lazy to put in the effort to learn. How can that be? No pain, no gain. If you want to be prominent in front of others, you must suffer behind them. Nothing comes for free.\nâWhat about Huihui? How is he feeling recently? He was in a bad mood after meeting his mother the last time. I think Murong Danling hasnât contacted him during this period.â\nâProbably not. I didnât notice anything wrong with him, nor did I hear him mention it.â\nâPay more attention to his emotions. I always feel that nothing is formed in one day. This period is the critical period for the formation of childrenâs values, and they must not be raised in a distorted way.â\nShen Haiyang thought of her past life and nodded seriously. If he died of a heart attack in his past life, Shen Hui must have suffered a great blow. Murong Danling loved to play and loved freedom. She had only taken care of the child a few times since he was born. If she brought the child to her for money, she would probably abandon him to her parents.\nHer parents have several grandchildren. Shen Hui is a sensitive child with strong self-esteem. It is conceivable that he grew up in a bad environment. If he lacks love and care, it is possible that he will value money more. Manslaughter: even if the child is not sentenced to death, it will be difficult for him to get over the psychological trauma of accidentally killing his mother.\nâwifeâ\nâWhatâs wrong? You seem to be hesitant to speak. Is there anything you canât tell me?â\nShen Haiyang smiled and pointed to the door of the main room where they lived. Li Xia followed him into the room. After closing the door, he asked her again about what she knew. Then he solemnly asked her to take care of Shen Hui.\nâIf, I mean if, anything happens to me and his grandfather, Huihui will be in your care.â\nHe had originally arranged this, but now that the old man was here, it looked like he was going to settle down. Both the father and son were ill, and if something happened, the old man would leave behind money, which would do more harm than good to an underage child. He could only bring up the old matter again with her.\nIf you donât think about the future, you will have immediate worries. Now that we have come to this, letâs entrust the child to her. Shen Haiyang works in the legal field and has seen many cases. For this kind of thing, he has the attitude of being fully prepared. Between Murong Danling and her, he chose to trust her without hesitation and entrust the child to her.\nâYou are a thoughtful person who thinks too much. Didnât you see that the old man still lived to this age? Medical science has developed rapidly during this period. I remember that in the 1990s, many heart diseases could be treated, and even important organ transplants could be performed. What you need to do now is take good care of yourself. The longer you live, the greater your hope.â\nThis was so straightforward; Shen Haiyang was helpless and amused, and he leaned forward to kiss her with his upturned mouth corners. Their lips and teeth were entangled, and there was no need to say anything else. When he met her clear eyes, he knew that she would definitely not ignore Shen Hui.\nQin Mu looked at the washing machine outside the yard, but the two people washing clothes were nowhere to be seen. She peeked out of the window and took a look at the main room, then looked as if she understood and was a little surprised and embarrassed. Li Xia was also very shy when she came out again, lowering her head and working silently. Meeting Shen Haiyangâs eyes with anger and annoyance, Shen Haiyang touched his nose and took the initiative to deliver dinner to the old man himself.\nThe man who delivered the meal hadnât come back for a while, so Li Xia invited everyone to eat. If the father and son had a chance to chat alone, maybe they could improve their relationship. She canât say they are really good, but just like ordinary neighbors, itâs not bad. After all, now they live in the front and back yards, and they see each other every day.\nIn the following days, the task of accompanying the old man for dinner was given to Shen Haiyang. Li Xia was busy setting up the stall and attending classes. Every day was busy but fulfilling. Life was going well, and there was a confident and kind light in her eyes.\nOn Childrenâs Day, the school held a sports meeting and invited all parents to come. When the children mentioned it before, they didnât dare to agree immediately, but when they arrived, they took time out to go to school.\nYiyi is in kindergarten. Todayâs public kindergartens are not like those in later times; at least this year, there are no programs. So the couple took the little one to the elementary school to see what programs the children participated in.\nThis public elementary school covers a large area and can accommodate tens of thousands of people. There are more than 20 classes for students of their age, and the number of students born in the 1970s before the one-child policy was very large.\nThere were not many parents of students who came. In this era, adults are rough in raising children . Not to mention that they donât have time; even if they do, they rarely come to participate in childrenâs activities. The family of three followed the sound of people to the playground stands and did not see their two children along the way.\nAfter the two sat down and looked around, Li Xia whispered, âDid they tell you what programs they were going to participate in?â\nâShen Hui will participate in 100-meter runs, skipped rope races, and relay races.â\nâWhy arenât these two here? Could it be that weâre too late and their competition has already passed?â\nShen Haiyang raised his hand and looked at his watch. âIt shouldnât be. It just started at this time.â\nâYiyi, look where your brothers and sister are, and tell mom if you see them.â\nâOkay.â\nThe little guy had very good eyesight, and he stood in the stands and looked around. At this time, there was a tug-of-war game on the field, and judging by the figure, he should be a senior student.\nâMom, mom, I saw my brother. He was holding a box. Oh, it was popsicles.â\nLi Xia and her husband followed the direction of their youngest sonâs finger and saw Shen Hui carrying a small box and trading with someone. Huihua stood beside him, looking around, her fair little face full of panic.\nShen Haiyang picked up Yiyi and walked over there, and Li Xia followed closely behind. What are these two kids doing? Why are they selling popsicles in the school? This is against school rules. These two little bastards are so bold.\nâBrother, run; the teacher is coming.â\nHuihua anxiously reached out to grab Shen Huiâs clothes. Shen Hui turned around and saw students leading the teacher over. He picked up his treasure box and turned away. Huihua followed him nervously.\nâDonât run; why are you running? Stop right there.â\nThe teacher saw the children running away and ran after them. The two children turned a corner and bumped into Li Xia. Li Xia was tall and could see that the teacher was chasing them. She raised her hand to take the small foam box from Shen Hui and signaled them to hide quickly.\nâWhy are you standing there? Do you want the teacher to find out and punish you two?â\nâoh.â\nâMother,â\nHuihua was worried about her mother, so Li Xia pushed her and told her to leave quickly. Shen Hui turned around and pulled his sister along, and the two little ones quickly disappeared into the flowers.\nWhen the teacher caught up, the two had disappeared, leaving only Li Xia and her family of three with a small foam box in her hand. The teacher looked at her, and she looked at the teacher. Just as she was about to speak, Shen Haiyang spoke first.\nâJust now, two little classmates stuffed a box into my wifeâs hands and ran away. We are parents who came to watch the sports meeting.â\nThe man was wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, buttoned up except for the top button, and black dickey pants with straight seams that matched the black leather shoes below. Li Xia, who was standing next to him, was wearing a purple waist-hugging dress with a bow tie around her waist, which made her look intellectual and elegant. YiYi, who was standing next to her, was also wearing a brand new white short-sleeved shirt with suspenders, which looked neat, clean, and beautiful.\nNo one would think that this family of three was selling popsicles on campus. Shen Haiyang looked like a cadre, so he definitely would not do such a thing.\nThe teacher nodded at them and turned to ask the two students behind him, âDo you know who did it? What grade and class are they in?â\nThe two shook their heads, obviously not knowing each other. âIt looks like they should be from the lower grades.â\nThere are thousands of students in the first grade, and now they have all run away. Where can they find a needle in a haystack? Moreover, the physical evidence is in Li Xiaâs hands. If they catch him, he will probably not admit it.\nThe teacher reached out and took the box from Li Xia. âIâm taking this away. Parents, please go over there and watch the sports meet.â\nThe box was quite heavy, which meant there were a lot of popsicles inside. Li Xia was a little reluctant to give it up and was dragged away by Shen Haiyang. On the way, she felt pain in her flesh just thinking about the popsicles, and when she sat in the stands and watched the two participating in the event, she rolled her eyes at them from a distance.\nShen Haiyang held Yiyi in his arms and glanced at his wife from time to time, then secretly laughed in his heart. It was just a small box; how much could it be filled with? She was so wealthy now, and she was actually angry over a few popsicles.\nLi Xia turned around and met his eyes accidentally, and he instantly understood what he was thinking. She bit her lip and smiled. The two of them didnât say anything at school. They waited until school was over at noon and called the two to the main room after they got home.\nâStand against the wall.â\n",
    "57": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c36-2/\nThe two children stood at the wall with their heads down, looking at their mother holding a feather duster with fear in their eyes. Huihua looked at her father for help, but her father turned around and left.\nâWhy do you do something that violates school rules? Whose idea was it?â\nâI.â\nShen Hui raised his hand without hesitation. The child felt a little disappointed and a little desperate. It was just a beating; what was the big deal?\nHuihua is a well-behaved child who doesnât lie. This idea was indeed proposed by Shen Hui, so she didnât know what to say for a moment. Looking at the feather duster in her motherâs hand, she silently used her body to block her brotherâs pull. Needless to say, the meaning is that we are in trouble together, and I will take the beating for you.\nâWhy do you do this?â\nShen Hui was a little stunned. He looked up at her and slowly breathed a sigh of relief. Most of the family education during this period was simple and rough; if they did something wrong, they would be beaten without asking any questions. He didnât expect her to give them a chance to explain. From the looks of it, as long as the reason was sufficient, it would probably be just a threat.\nBut he just couldnât say the reason. The little boy had very strong self-esteem and was as stubborn as a duck. He just wouldnât say what he should say.\nHe didnât say anything. Li Xia felt helpless and turned to look at her daughter. Huihua looked at her mother and explained, âBrother wants toâ¦â\nâDonât tell Huihua.â\nWell, he was stubborn and refused to explain, nor did he let his sister explain. Huihua had been with him for such a long time, and she admired her smart brother very much, so she naturally listened to him. As soon as he called her, she immediately shut up.\nâMother,â\nThe little girl spoke softly, with a hint of pleading. Seeing Shen Haiyang coming in with the teapot, the girl once again cast her eyes on her stepfather. Shen Haiyang looked at his son. The little guy was stubborn and awkward, and he looked like he was determined to stick with it to the end.\nLi Xia turned to look at Shen Haiyang, silently asking him what to do. Can you handle this hot potato? Shen Haiyang nodded slightly at her and took the feather duster from her hand.\nâNo matter what your purpose is, itâs wrong for you to do this. Since you donât want to explain why, we wonât ask. Iâll punish you two for cleaning up the house, and this matter will be over. Donât do it again in the future.â\nThe family has been busy recently, and the front yard has not been cleaned for several days. The two children took the broom, dustpan, and rag and started cleaning without any objection to their fatherâs decision. Shen Hui raised his hand and pulled Yiyi to work. The little guy was given a broom by his brother, and he looked like who am I, where am I, and what am I doing.\nâelder brother,â\nâWe are brothers in this life and in all eternity. We share the good times and the bad times. We are both punished; do you want to stay out of it?â\nHe nodded and then quickly shook his head. âIâm with my brother and sister.â\nâThen stop talking nonsense and get to work.â\nLooking at the three busy figures, Li Xia stood by the bed and held her forehead helplessly. âWe usually give them pocket money and snacks all the time. Why do you think they are doing this? And they donât seem to spend their pocket money very much. Shen Hui has a piggy bank. When I was cleaning, I found that it seemed to be getting heavier day by day.â\nâDo they want something special?â\nâIâve already promised to buy them a bicycle for the kids this summer; why would they have to work so hard to buy something like that?â Li Xia sighed and suddenly thought of something. âCould it be that they were influenced by me? Seeing me set up a stall to make money every day, they have no interest in studying, and their minds are only on money.â\nWithout waiting for Shen Haiyang to speak, she continued, âIf this is true, itâs bad. We must correct it in time. If you have had such small thoughts since childhood, you will only be able to do small things when you grow up, and you wonât be able to do big things.â\nShen Haiyang frowned when he heard that the old mother was worried about her children. But he felt that things were not that simple. The family had not been in financial difficulty in the past two years, so the children would not be obsessed with money.\nâIâll talk to Shen Hui in private.â\nThe three little ones were cleaning up with their butts sticking out. After dinner, Shen Haiyang went into the east wing, and Li Xia went into the west wing. The result of the news surprised her.\nâMy brother and I heard my second uncle say that our family was after grandpaâs property, saying that dadâs illness was caused by bad intentions, so he wanted to go home to protect his own rights. My brother said he hated his condescending attitude and that we could earn enough money to treat dadâs illness without him and grandpa.â\nâSo, this isnât the first time youâve sold something at school?â\nâYeah. My brother bought a lot of pencils and erasers wholesale before, but he sold them at the school gate after class.â\nThe child is devoted to the family and the father; what else can the parents say? The child should know that the familyâs living standard is not short of money, and living with the old man is a blood relative that cannot be refused. And the old man is currently a very kind old man, making people happy to live with him. Is Shen Hui too sensitive? He cares so much about what Shen Yaozong says.\nâMother,â , Huahua called her timidly, and she reached out and hugged her daughter. This child was too soft. In her previous life, apart from hiding away and resolutely not getting married, everything else she did was consider herself a mother. Looking into her eyes, she felt distressed. Even if she lost her temper, the child still called her on time to give her money.\nâYou like this father very much and are afraid of losing him?â\nHuihua nodded obediently. âI know we have a house and a household registration now, and mom can earn money to support us. We also know that Mom is very capable and can support this family. We just want to do something for Dad. Mom, a home feels like a home only when there is dad.â\nAfter hearing the last sentence, Li Xia immediately broke down and hugged her daughter to comfort her gently. Who wouldnât want such a young child to have both parents and a harmonious family? Especially since Shen Haiyang was very good to them and he was a good-tempered person, the children naturally liked him. They were not happy with Shen Yaozong saying that about him.\nâMom will take care of the money-making. You are still young, so the most important thing is to study hard.â\nâYes. But mom, my brotherâs doing this doesnât affect his studies at all. He ranked first in the grade in the midterm exam, scoring 100 points in both exams. The teacher thought my brother was amazing, so she gave him second-grade math homework, and he actually knew how to do multiplication. I donât even know when he learned the multiplication formulas. The teacher asked him if he wanted to skip a grade, and he shook his head and refused.â\nThe little girlâs eyes lit up when she mentioned her brother. During her studies, her admiration for the top student was so obvious. Not only did she admire Shen Hui, but she also admired Yiyi. Her brother was several years younger than her, but he could calculate faster than her.\nâGo watch TV. Iâll discuss this with your father.â\nThe little girl was ready to leave happily, but when she reached the door, she turned back and whispered, âMom, donât tell him I said that.â\nâOkay.â\nAfter being questioned, the two kids went to the backyard to watch TV, and Li Xia and her husband returned to the main room. Judging from Shen Haiyangâs appearance, he should have talked to Shen Hui and knew why his son did this.\nâIâve told him not to break school rules in the future. This kidâ¦ looks quite gentle; why is he so worried?â\nâThis child is very sensitive and cares too much about the attitudes and words of others. But our conditions are good now, and when the child becomes more and more confident, he will not care so much about others.â Li Xia smiled and made him a cup of milk powder.\nâTo be honest, Iâm a little jealous of you. The three children are so close to you. Yiyi said that he doesnât want to change his father, and Huihua said that a home feels like a home only when there is a father.â\nSpeaking of this, Shen Haiyang also smiled, his face full of relief. Needless to say, his own flesh and blood are in his heart, and the two of them have become very close to him after spending some time together. Outsiders who donât know them would never think that they are stepchildren. His efforts have been rewarded, which makes him more determined to live a good life.\nâOne of my classmates went abroad this year, and I asked him to help me find out about the progress in treating heart disease abroad. If it can be treated, we will go abroad.â\nLi Xia nodded. âDonât worry about the money. At worst, we can sell all those shops. With the development of business, the value of shops will double.â\nâFather,â\nShen Haiyang started but didnât continue, and Li Xia didnât ask. She took a natural approach to this kind of relationship. After thinking it over again, she felt more open-minded, not particularly entangled or complaining, but she also wouldnât urge him to fix the rift. They were all people of this age, and they had their own standards for everything. Emotional matters had to come naturally.\nThey are also thinking of other ways to get money and connections for treatment and are not completely dependent on him. They donât feel inferior to others for asking for help, and the relationship between them is more natural.\nâShen Yaozongâs intention is to stop him from investing in the mainland, but I think he seems to have a plan in mind. I heard that he has already discussed the location of the factory with the Investment Promotion Office. I donât know what the final outcome will be.â\nShe seemed to be talking to herself, and without waiting for his answer, she continued, âNo matter what they do, we should renovate our shop as soon as it is completed in the fall. We canât delay the peak season before the New Year.â\n",

They sell everything from pencils, erasers, knives, and eggs to pencil cases and clipboards for exams.\n“This is how much money they have saved up. They even bought big items like pencil cases.”\nYiyi sighed at the side: “My brother took all my pocket money, saying it was for investment.”\nLi Xia smiled and said, “Where did he learn this? Could it be that his grandfather taught him?”\nShen Haiyang looked towards the backyard and said, “Maybe he has also invested in it.”\nThe whole family is obsessed with money. Is this really good? She herself has a low level of education and attaches great importance to learning. She talked to the two children in the evening and solemnly explained to them.\n“If your academic performance drops, you will not be able to run this business. I will confiscate all your money. Do you understand me?”\nHuihua nodded obediently and said, “I know, Mom. I didn’t miss any practice. Look at my handwriting. The teacher said, I have made progress.”\nThe child said as she handed the big characters she had written to Li Xia. The neat handwriting made Li Xia ignore the ink stains on her sleeves. It was not easy to learn a talent. There was not a single piece of her clothing that was not stained with ink. It was very difficult to wash it.\n“Okay, don’t slack off on writing every day.”\n“Okay, I know. I’ll urge you to recite the words one by one after I finish writing them.”\nLi Xia smiled and turned her gaze towards Shen Hui. The little boy’s eyes rolled around, and then he smiled and nodded. “Don’t worry, Mom. If my score is lower than 98, I won’t do anything. You can confiscate all my money.”\n“Okay, remember what you said. We are going to do great things in the future. If you are uneducated and can’t manage well, then I will give you up one by one.”\n“Mom, are you going to open a factory?”\n“That’s a possibility. I’m attending night school now because I’m afraid I won’t be able to manage something big in the future. When mom gets old, you’ll have to take over. If you don’t have any education, what you learn in night school will definitely not be as good as what regular college students can teach you.”\n“Yes.” After hearing that he could earn money by learning knowledge, Shen Hui nodded more seriously this time. “I will study hard and won’t fall behind.”\nAfter giving the two children a shot of prevention, Shen Haiyang paid attention to their study problems in the following days. Li Xia was busy setting up the stall and attending classes every day. Time passed quickly in the busyness, and the children had their summer vacation. Shen Hui’s grades remained the same, and he scored more than 80 in painting, which was an improvement over before.\n“It’s better to teach in the city!”\nThe first grade was over. Huihua picked up the blank math test paper that the teacher had left behind and coaxed her younger brother to do it in the afternoon. She promised to buy him a popsicle when he finished.\nYiyi took the pencils sharpened by his sister and worked hard for the popsicles. He had been learning mental arithmetic for less than half a year, but his calculation skills were envied by Huihua. He lowered his head, stretched out his fingers, and quickly wrote down the standard answers for the 20 calculation questions in the first attempt.\nHe couldn’t read the following questions, so Huihua explained them to him. Most of the first-grade stuff was still about calculations, and the following questions were just a change of format to test the child’s thinking. Huihua found that her brother was younger than her, but his comprehension ability was better than hers. He understood the basics at a glance, and when she read out the last word problem, he quickly wrote the formula below, calculating clearly.\nThe boy was given an hour to answer a math test paper, but he only took half the time to finish it. After finishing, he didn’t care whether he was right or wrong, and he dragged his sister to buy popsicles. There was a refrigerator at home, but Li Xia didn’t let them eat too much, so she didn’t buy any popsicles at home.\nHuihua used her pocket money to buy her brother a popsicle, and the little guy tore off the package and licked it eagerly. “So cool, so refreshing, sister, why don’t you buy one for yourself?”\n“Eat yours.”\nFulfilling her promise, she took the paper her brother had written and ran to find Shen Hui. “Brother, let me use your final exam paper.”\nShen Hui had just finished memorizing ancient poems, which were extra homework his father gave him during the summer vacation. There were two ancient poems a day, and there was an extra pile of books on the bookshelf. The complete collection of 300 Tang poems, appreciation of Song poems, as for what to memorize, it was up to him to decide. He was busy playing, practicing piano, and thinking about what to sell when school started. How could he have the energy to choose? He just memorized one book after another.\n“Why do you want my test paper? To copy it? I don’t think the teacher gave me this homework. Homework for those who score above 90, above 80, and below 80 is all different, okay?”\nReally ?? You got full marks yourself; the teacher didn’t ask you guys to do summer homework at all. You just need to hand in your calligraphy practice when school starts. How can you understand how much a poor student like her has to write?\n“Okay, okay, if you can’t finish writing, just bring a copy here and I’ll help you write it, okay?”\n“I do not want it.”\n“You don’t want this, but it’s not that I, as your brother, won’t help.”\nHuihua took the pen, put the two test papers on the table, and began to compare the answers. She didn’t say a word about her brother’s words. This guy was from Versailles.\nRight, right, right… As he ticked the boxes one by one, Huihua’s face turned gloomy, and he was really shocked. Shen Hui also saw the test paper at this time. There were basically no Chinese characters except numbers. Such questions were not answered well. If you don’t answer the application questions in full, you won’t get full marks.\n“Who wrote the number? Why does it look so much like one by one?”\nThe Huihua was also shocked at this time. Except for the last four application questions, which were about not being able to write Chinese characters because they had not learned them, the rest were all correct.\n“Just write them one by one.” After saying this, the little girl sat in silence on the chair. Shen Hui raised his hand to pick up the paper and looked at it, then spoke nonchalantly.\n“He’s good at mental arithmetic, but his handwriting is terrible and crooked. But mom said he’s still young and can’t hold a pen and write too many words. He’ll have more practice with his handwriting when he goes to school.”\nShen Hui finished speaking, folded up the test paper, and put it away. He turned around and saw Huahua’s disappointed face. “Everyone has their own strengths. I needed your help to pass my art homework. I even had to scribble so that the teacher wouldn’t notice. You were so confident back then. Why are you sulking here over a few points?”\n“But Yiyi is several years younger than me, and he can do everything right. Why can’t I do it?”\n“Maybe you were careless.” The boy smiled and took her out to play. “Come on, don’t think too much. Mom said that as long as you can pass the exam, it’s fine. You’ve exceeded the passing line by more than ten points this time. You’re good at drawing, and you learn piano quickly. If you study well, you’ll be able to survive.”\nThe little boy was good at comforting people. Just a few words made Huihua smile. The brother and sister went out to find Yiyi, and they played together with a few friends outside the street. The girls jumped a rubber rope, and the boy picked up a brick and threw it at his father.\nAfter a while of playing, a car stopped in front of his house. His friends called out to them subconsciously, thinking that he was the only relative on this street who had a car. Oh, yes, his grandfather also had a car, which was unique on this street.\nShen Hui stopped Huihua and turned around to see Shen Yaozong. With him was his wife, who had come with him once before. The woman was holding a boy who was about five or six years old.\nAs soon as the mother and son got off the car, they frowned and looked reluctant. The woman even waved her hand in front of her nose to fan the air, as if the air here made her very impatient. In fact, the pollution on the mainland during this period was not serious, and the air was absolutely fresh.\n“Honey, are we really going to live here?”\n“At least until the old man changes his mind.” The old man likes his children and grandchildren to be around him. He also has a wife and child. It’s not only Shen Haiyang who can provide this kind of emotional value.\n“Oh my God, I can’t survive this.”\n“If you don’t care about that property, then you can leave now.”\nShen Yaozong had a gloomy face and was too lazy to coax his wife. She only knew how to enjoy herself every day and couldn’t help at all. The child next to him was also very dissatisfied with the ground under his feet. He wanted to say something but didn’t dare to say it now.\n“Let’s go in and have a good talk with the old man.”\nWhen they arrived, Shen Hui and Huihua looked at each other and went to inform their parents. It was already evening, and Li Xia and Shen Haiyang arrived home quickly. They heard the noise in the backyard from the front yard, and the couple walked to the backyard.\n“Dad, I advise you to turn back and not go down this path. What can be developed on such poor land? If you get stuck in the quagmire, it will be too late to get out, and you won’t even have a place to cry.”\nShen Yaozong was obviously not optimistic about the investment environment on the mainland. Not only was it backward now, but also the shadow that the chaos over the past decade had cast on his mind. If the mainland were to do the same thing again, the title of capitalist would be gone.\n“Yes, father, just listen to Mike. It’s not bad to go back to the United States. It’s so backward here. What if your old illness relapses?”\nThe couple really did their homework, and every word of persuasion was very practical. The old man remained silent in front of his son and daughter-in-law and raised his hand to hand his grandson a few lychees.\nIn this era of underdeveloped logistics, many people in the north don’t even know this. But the boy didn’t care about the rare fruit that Shen Haiyang asked someone to bring. He thought its rough skin was a bit ugly and threw it on the ground.\n“It’s ugly. I don’t want it.”\nThe old man took a deep breath, stood up, and picked up the lychees himself. He looked at Shen Haiyang with a bit of apology and then did not answer the couple’s previous words. Instead, he peeled the lychees and ate them slowly while explaining to the brat.\n“Lychees grow in the southern region with a mild climate and prefer a high temperature and high humidity environment. Lychees are sweet and warm in nature and can stimulate the appetite. The flesh of lychees is white and sweet. In ancient times, when transportation was not well developed, we could not eat such fruits at all due to our geographical location.”\nThe little boy had never eaten lychees before. He thought it was not a good thing because of its rough skin. But after listening to his grandfather, he realized that it was very rare. And after peeling off the skin, the flesh inside was white and delicate, and he could smell a refreshing fragrance.\n“Grandpa, isn’t it said that the mainland is very poor? Why does it have such good things?”\n“China is a vast country with abundant resources. It stretches from Mohe, Heilongjiang, at 53 degrees north latitude in the north to the Nansha Islands at 4 degrees north latitude in the south. It stretches from Fuyuan County, Heilongjiang, at 135 degrees east longitude in the east to the Pamir Plateau in Xinjiang, at 73 degrees east longitude in the west. The time difference is more than four hours. It spans 49 degrees from north to south and is 5,500 kilometers long.\nWith such a large latitude and longitude, China is rich in products, including almost all kinds of tropical, temperate, and cold zone animals and plants. The lychee you just ate is a tropical fruit. Although we are located in the temperate zone, because of the vast territory of the country, we can enjoy it without importing it. ”\nThe little boy chewed the delicious and juicy lychee flesh and nodded to his grandfather, “It turns out that China is not that poor. Then grandpa, besides lychees, do you have apples, avocados, and black currants here?”\n“Because of the different geographical locations, the types of fruits and vegetables are also very different. There are no avocados and black currants here, but there are cantaloupes, pears, and grapes, all of which are produced in Xinjiang. In the south, there are also lychees, longans, oranges, mangoes, etc. The products are very abundant.”\n“oh!”\nThe little boy showed a surprised expression and had a different understanding of this strange country, the hometown his grandfather mentioned. He had disliked lychees just now, but now he enjoyed the delicious taste.\nHis parents were not interested in talking about products with the old man, and they sneered at what the old man said. No matter how big this country is, its industry is seriously backward, and the living standards of the people are far behind those of the United States. Forget about cars; it’s already good enough for people here to be able to afford bicycles.\n",
    "59": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c38/\nCHAPTER 38\nWhy did they choose to return to such a backward country when the environment in the United States is so good? They also want to open an electronics factory. With such a standard of living, can they afford electronic products? Do they have to produce them here and then sell them back to the United States at a high tariff?\n“Dad, business in the United States is not easy. We can explore overseas markets or transform into other businesses. But you are making a big mistake by investing in the mainland and discussing cooperation with Xixi Electronics. The living standards here are simply not enough to consume electronic products.”\nThe old man looked up at the son who had grown up beside him and sighed silently in his heart. “You are too arbitrary. I tell you, in ten years, you will regret and apologize for your rampant contempt today.”\n“No, I never would.”\n“Dad, you think too highly of your hometown.” Daughter-in-law Annie also echoed her husband, trying to persuade her father-in-law to change his mind. “This country is too backward. It will be difficult for them to have enough food and clothing in 20 years, let alone 10 years.”\nHis son and daughter-in-law had a deep prejudice against this place, and the old man knew that it would be difficult to convince them with empty words. So he shook his head and said no more, asking them to take a bath and prepare for dinner.\nThe family of three went to take a shower, and naturally they complained about the bathroom without a water heater. Li Xia went to the front yard to cook with Qin Mu. Since they were guests, they had to be entertained.\n“There’s no cooked food left, not even many vegetables. Luckily, there’s a refrigerator at home where you froze pig pigtails and chicken. Otherwise, you would have been laughed at by that family of three again today.”\nThe hair of the pig’s tail had been cleaned before freezing, so it was cut into pieces, blanched, and fried with the chicken. With a sizzling sound, the rich aroma of meat and seasonings hit the nose.\nShe held a spatula in her hand while Qin Mu peeled beans and potatoes to prepare side dishes. She spoke while frying the meat.\n“I guess I’ll be laughed at for this.”\n“Ah, no way?” Qin Mu’s family burden has been heavy these years, and she has been living a very frugal life. Not to mention chicken and pig tails; putting two taels of meat in a meal is only during the Chinese New Year, so she doesn’t believe it.\n“Rice, chicken with pig’s tail, cold spinach, hot and sour cabbage, smashed cucumber, cold shredded ear, cold shredded chicken, winter melon meatball soup, this is…” Qin Mu stretched out his hand to count: “This is six dishes and one soup. If they are still not satisfied, do they want to eat dragon liver and phoenix gall?”\n\n\n\n(chicken with pig’s tail)\n\n\n\n(cold spinach)\n\n\n\n( hot and sour cabbage)\n\n\n\n(smashed cucumber)\n\n\n\n(cold shredded pig ear)\n\n\n\n(cold shredded chicken)\n\n\n\n( winter melon meatball soup)\nVision limits imagination. In Qin Mu’s eyes, such a sumptuous dinner is already at the level of the emperor’s imperial meal. Li Xia had decades of experience in her previous life. She had heard that those rich people lived luxuriously. The old man was not picky at all. Generally, he would order two dishes, a soup or noodles, and side dishes. As long as they suited his taste, it was fine. So Qin Mu had no idea how luxurious the lives of rich people would be. And you can’t wake up a person who pretends to be asleep. They can find fault with anything they want.\n“Don’t worry about the three of them. Just cook according to the old man’s taste and increase the amount of food.”\nQin Mu looked back with some trepidation: “That’s the old man’s biological son and grandson, so there’s really no need to worry about it?”\n“No need.” The old man’s attitude was obviously to teach Shen Yaozong a lesson. He had no intention of giving in. If he didn’t give in, why should they give in to him? If you don’t like to be with us, just leave. We didn’t invite you here.\n“But…how long do you think they’ll be here?”\nQin Mu mainly takes care of the old man’s life and cooks for Li Xia’s family. It was good before, and they were easy to get along with. But now, with Shen Yaozong’s family of three, it’s not so pleasant.\n“I estimate that there will be a result in less than a week. If they are determined to stay, they will find another house. It is impossible for them to live together. If the old man can’t be persuaded and he himself can’t adapt to life here, then it’s time to leave. Don’t be afraid; anyway, you won’t be with them for long.”\n“Oh.” Qin Mu smiled: “Thanks to you.”\n“You don’t have to give in to that family. We have freedom and equality, so we should confront them when we have to.”\n“Ah? That’s not good.”\n“There’s nothing wrong with that. Respect is mutual. If they don’t respect you, just confront them directly.”\n“What should I do if he runs away?”\n“It’s just right that they ran away. Let them live outside and stop being an eyesore here.”\nWhen the food was served, the couple frowned. Annie said the food was too oily, and Shen Yaozong frowned and said he was tired from traveling, so he wanted to eat something easy. The old man didn’t wait for Qin Mu and Li Xia to retort because he was so disrespectful to the person who cooked and entertained them.\n“If you don’t want to eat, leave. No one is begging you to sit down.”\nThe old man’s words choked Shen Yaozong and his wife. They couldn’t bear it, so they stood up and left angrily. No one on the seat paid any attention to them; even their son ignored his mother’s gaze and took a spoon to put a piece of red oil ear shreds into his mouth.\nThe crispness of the ears and the fragrance of the chili oil blend perfectly together, and the little guy was eating with a smile on his face. The old man has lived abroad for decades. When he had the conditions, he hired a Chinese aunt to cook, and Chinese food was often served on the table. The little guy lived with his grandfather when he was abroad, and he also liked Chinese food very much.\n“What is this? The crust is delicious.”\n“Pig tails are rich in collagen.”\n“Mm, it smells good.”\nHaving been eating Western food with his mother these days, he already missed Chinese food. This meal was very satisfying, and after finishing it, the children went to wash their hands, and then the sound of the piano ding-dong-dong came.\nLi Xia was clearing the dishes when she saw Kevin, Shen Yaozong’s son, playing the piano in the side room. Although the little guy was young, he was very familiar with the piano and looked very happy. His white and tender fingers flew, and the smooth piano music flowed out from his fingertips.\nHis behavior was a silent challenge, and he would look back at the three people from time to time while playing the piano. He was the same age as Yiyi, and his eyes were especially directed at Yiyi.\nThe three kids at home have only been learning for a short time. If they can’t stand the provocation and fight, they will be using their own weakness to attack the enemy’s strength. Just when she was worried, the three kids at home rolled their eyes and walked away hand in hand.\nKevin was feeling very proud, but when he looked back, his peers were nowhere to be seen. The child immediately lost interest in showing off his skills, stopped moving his hands, walked out of the house, and spoke to Li Xia.\n“Where are they?”\nLi Xia kept walking with the basin in her hand. Seeing that she ignored him, the little boy reached out and grabbed her clothes. “Hey, I’m asking you, where are they? Where did they go?”\nLi Xia was pulled to a stop and looked back at him. “Are you talking to me?”\n“Yeah, who else am I talking to?”\n“You are so rude. When you talk to me, you have to address me first. If you don’t address me, I have no obligation to answer you.”\nAfter being taught a lesson, the little boy tilted his head as if thinking. “What should I call you?”\n“According to the seniority system in China, you should call me aunt.”\n“Okay, Auntie. Where did the three of them go?”\n“I have no idea.”\nLi Xia got up and left, leaving the little boy alone in the wind. “I’m already polite; I’ve even called you aunt; why don’t you answer my question?”\nBecause the old man had transferred most of his business back to the mainland, Shen Yaozong and his family of three stayed reluctantly. The old man was in poor health and wanted Shen Yaozong to negotiate a series of matters such as land, construction, and equipment, but this guy refused to go.\nOn the sofa, the father and son seemed to be confronting each other. Returning to the mainland to invest and start all over again. This is not an easy thing, and the old man’s current physical condition makes it difficult to support it.\n“Dad, you’re not fair.”\n“How do I say this?”\n“When you were there, life was so difficult, and it was me and my mom who accompanied you. Now you are actually moving all your life’s struggles back to the mainland. We were the ones who suffered, but now it is Shen Haiyang, who has done nothing for you, who is enjoying the day.”\n“Did you suffer when you were a child?” The old man sneered, “What kind of suffering did you suffer? Even in the most difficult times, your family guaranteed you bread, milk, and meat every now and then. You dare to say that you suffered with such a life?”\nShen Yaozong’s face turned red because the old man’s words reminded him of life on the mainland in the past few decades. Each person was given a certain amount of grain, oil, meat, cloth, and all other daily necessities. There was only so much food a month, and 60 to 70 percent of the food for those who didn’t have a job was coarse grains such as corn. There was even less oil and meat, and there was basically no oil in the food.\nHe has heard that foreign countries do not report on the good things about the mainland, so the impression he has of the mainland is that it is poor and backward.\n“Well, you can’t use all of your wealth to compensate him. I am also your son. It’s unfair to me that you are so biased.”\nShen Yaozong’s mother divorced his father a long time ago, and the property was divided at that time. In the past ten years, his father has seized the opportunity to develop rapidly, and the money his mother got was already wasted. So he came to find his father, and he has lived very close to his father in recent years.\nHe thought he was the only son, and everything that belonged to his father was his, but he never thought that his father would return to China. He really didn’t understand what was so good about such a backward place where even bathing and toileting were inconvenient.\n“Whether it is the laws of the United States or the mainland, I have absolute control over my property.”\n“But I am also your son.”\n“I didn’t say no.”\nIf the old man had not transferred his property back to the mainland, he would not have said these words. After all, the United States is his territory. But now that the old man has transferred all his property back to China, Shen Haiyang will be the first to get the moon. If he persuades the old man to sign an unequal will, he will be at a disadvantage if he is not around.\n“You have decided not to return to the United States, right?”\n“right.”\n“What about me?”\nIn the end, it was all about property. The old man sighed and said, “I’m not dead yet.”\nThe United States is a country that values freedom. Many elderly people give their property to others after they die because their children are not around. Now that the elderly are still alive, forcing them to divide their property now is not justifiable in any way. Neither the law nor human feelings support it.\nShen Yaozong gave up and wanted to see what his father would do. The old man smiled, did not force him, and instead found Li Xia. Li Xia had hired a new employee these days who was about the same age as Xiao Liu. She used a base salary plus commission to increase the enthusiasm of the employees and handed over the clothing business to them. She was going to go south again to plan the business after the store opened.\n“Dad, do you have something to talk to me about?”\n“Kid, can you do me a favor?”\n“You say.”\n“Temporarily help with a series of trivial matters, such as factory construction.”\n“Why?”\nShen Yaozong is back. She heard that he was the one who helped the old man run the business in the United States. She thought he was trying to pressure him to stay and continue building the factory. Oh, Li Xia understood all of a sudden.\n“Do you want my second brother to stay?”\n“This child is too impetuous and lacks understanding of the mainland. Give him some time. Once he is familiar with it, he will no longer be so repulsive.”\nIn fact, Li Xia wanted to ask why force others to do something. If he wants to leave, just let him go. You can give him as much inheritance as he deserves in the future. Why do you have to let him stay and do this?\nElectronics factory, black and white TV—this is the project that the old man started first. From his usual voice, Li Xia knew that he also cooperated with a foreign electronics company, and it seemed that he basically relied on the other party’s imports. That is, he took various parts produced by the other party and then assembled them back. But he could put his own brand on it, which was in exchange for buying the other party’s retired production line.\n \n",
    "60": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c38-2/\nLi Xia felt that she could hire someone else to be the manager, and there was no need to hire Shen Yaozong. But from a father’s perspective, she could understand this mentality. Once family affection is involved in something, it cannot be explained by ordinary reason. As a mother with three children, Li Xia could fully understand this feeling of wanting to share her good things with her son.\n“I haven’t done this.”\n“If you have any questions, you can ask me.”\n“Okay. How long will it take? I’ll be very busy if the store over there delivers it.”\n“You can take care of both sides and outsource the construction of the factory, which does not require you to spend too much energy.”\n“Well, then.”\nLi Xia agreed, and the old man turned to look at her. She looked down at herself and asked, “Is there anything wrong with me?”\n“Kid, you didn’t mention the reward. You’re going to lose money doing business this way.”\n“We are a family.”\nThe old man’s shrewd eyes were filled with tenderness. “Good girl. This time, the factory construction is left to you, and you can manage the funds.”\nAll the profits from the factory construction will belong to her. Li Xia smiled and nodded. “Okay, I will do my best.”\nOn the one hand, he wanted to keep Shen Yaozong and let him seize the opportunity to develop well on the mainland. At the same time, he also wanted to help Li Xia and give her the experience of building a factory. She is now engaged in wholesale, and the next step to expanding is to open a factory. The theory of night school, the practical operation of building a factory, and the advice of the old man have helped her grow step by step.\n“Come on, let’s go and have a look.”\nToday, the old man drove himself, and Li Xia felt that she had to speed up the process of getting a driver’s license. After accompanying the old man back from the factory, she asked Shen Haiyang, who was returning home from getting off work, to teach her how to drive.\nAfter finding an empty route, Shen Haiyang gave her the driving seat. Li Xia was not particularly brave, but there were no cars on this road, and Shen Haiyang was watching her, so she was not afraid at all. She started the car, held the steering wheel, and stared straight ahead.\nShe walked in a straight line very smoothly for two days. Then she started to practice other things, such as reversing into a parking space, starting on a slope, and S-shaped roads.\nWhile practicing driving, she was looking for a suitable construction team. This time the project was not small, and her father and cousin had no experience or qualifications to undertake it. Finally, she found the Provincial Urban Construction Company, which was the general contractor. She took on a small job for her father.\nNot long after writing the letter, the old man came to the provincial capital with his son and several villagers. Li Xia took them directly to the construction site, and the person in charge of the project arranged for them to work in the shed.\nThe makeshift house was built with wood, and it was full of bunk beds. The floor was muddy, the floor was not flat, and the room was hot in summer and cold in winter, with no insulation. But this environment is not only now but also on construction sites more than ten years later. Li Xia can’t do anything about it.\n“If it’s not raining, we can sleep outside. If it’s raining, we can go inside. Okay, Xia, please come back soon. We can do it ourselves. We can do the construction according to their requirements, such as wall construction and plastering.”\nThe workers who came were matched with the big and small ones. The old man was worried about his son, so he came along. This time, the eldest and the second son stayed at home to harvest the autumn harvest, and the father and third son carried their bedding to the city to earn money.\nLi Xia handed the things for her father and third brother to them, respectively. The old man took the gray short-sleeved thin Dickies trousers in his hands with a smile on his face, but he looked at his daughter and scolded her.\n“Just one set is enough; why did you give me two sets? It’s easy to fool people in the summer. You just don’t know how to spend money. You just earned a little money, and you start to spend it recklessly. You have three children. You should save all the extra money. In the future, the children will go to school and get married. There will be many places to spend money.” He handed the set back to her and said, “Here, take this back and sell it.”\nThe third brother also meant the same thing but was pushed back by Li Xia. She smiled and said to her old father, “It’s not a lot of money. What does your daughter do now? She deals with this. She doesn’t need anything—not clothes. By the way, are the clothes I sent to my mother suitable for her?”\n“She is not wearing it. She gave it to your sister-in-law.”\n“Why?”\n“Your mother isn’t used to the way your clothes look.”\nOh, the old lady had been wearing the kind of tops with side openings all her life, and her trousers were also the old-fashioned Burmese crotch trousers. Although the ones she bought for her were also dark blue, the old lady was not used to that style.\n“Then I’ll pull the cloth for her next time.”\n“No, she just said you wouldn’t, and you’re spending money again. We’ve already been given so much; don’t worry about it. In the summer, your sister-in-law will buy her a 12-foot-long one, enough for her to wear for a whole set.”\nThe father and daughter talked as they walked and soon reached the roadside. Li Xia asked, “Where’s my second sister-in-law? Didn’t she say she was coming this time?”\n“Didn’t I tell you? Your second brother stopped her. They planted three acres of sesame this year. It’s so hard to harvest it. If she leaves, your second brother won’t be able to handle it all by himself.”\nThe two children of the eldest sister-in-law are grown up and can help, but the second brother’s children are still young and in school. The second brother is right to do so. It is not right for his wife to earn money outside and leave the housework to others.\n“Okay, Dad, go back. I’ll come to see you guys when I’m free. We’re doing this job ourselves, so don’t get too tired. Just do as little as you can and rest when you’re tired.”\nThe girl felt sorry for him, and the old man was so happy that his teeth were not visible. “I know, I know.”\nLi Xia glanced at her third brother before leaving. Just as she was about to speak, he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll watch over him. I’ll take care of dad.”\nShe rode her bike home and heard the noise in the backyard as soon as she entered the gate. Qin Mu whispered to her and acted as her ear-splitting god.\n“The couple quarreled every day. The woman said she wanted to go back to the United States, and the man tried every means to stop her. Yesterday, a western restaurant opened on Century Road, and the three of them went to eat there. Well, this way, they don’t have to find fault with me every day.”\n“I’m sorry for making you feel wronged.”\nQin Mu waved her hand and said, “It’s okay. The old man is very reasonable. He will help me speak up and scold them as long as he hears it. He also told me not to be polite with them, and it doesn’t matter if they want to eat or not.”\n“Well, the old man is right. You don’t have to be too polite to them. Just go ahead and criticize them if you have to.”\nQin Mu smiled and didn’t say anything. She just wanted to be sure. She was hired by Li Xia to take care of the old man. The couple was only here for a short period of time, so she just ignored them.\n“Wait until my shop opens, then you can come and work there.” The wife of the husband’s friend would feel uncomfortable if she helped at home for a long time, as she would be treated as a nanny.\n“Actually, I’m fine at your house.”\n“It’s better to work in a shop. It’s more formal than this.”\n“That’s fine.”\nQin Mu’s education level was not high. She had been a housewife at home for many years and had long been accustomed to this kind of family life. But she could guess what Li Xia was thinking. If someone arranged for her to go to the store, then she would go to the store. In fact, when she thought about selling goods and interacting with all kinds of people, she began to feel scared.\n“Brother, brother, please take me with you.”\nKevin’s voice; it’s only been a few days, and he’s calling him brother all the time. Shen Hui was holding a long bamboo pole with a laundry detergent bag tied to the thin end. The bag was stretched open with wire to form an open shape. This was obviously to catch cicadas, one of the favorite activities for children in the summer.\n“Oh, I’m so annoyed. If I take you there, I don’t know what your mother will say when we get back, saying that we have corrupted you. Just stay at home and watch TV; don’t follow us. We are all wild children, and we can’t take care of a grown man like you.”\nWhat did Annie say? Li Xia had never heard the children say that. As she was talking, the children came in and saw her. Huihua and Shen Hui looked at each other, asking if their mother had heard what they had just said. Their mother was very busy every day, and they didn’t want to cause any more trouble for her.\n“mom,”\n“Are you going to catch cicadas?”\nYiyi came out of the kitchen holding two soda bottles filled with cold water. Seeing Li Xia, the brat quickly said, “Auntie gave me boiled water, not tap water.”\n“Go have fun, and be safe.”\nThe three children turned around and left happily, and Kevin was anxious to follow them. Shen Hui handed the pole in his hand to Huihua, turned around, grabbed Kevin’s collar, and pulled him back.\n“Don’t come with me; don’t come with me. How many times do I have to tell you before you understand?”\n“Brother, I want to play with you.”\n“I don’t want to play with you.”\nShen Hui used a lot of force and seemed to be very resentful of his little cousin. After dragging him to the door of the east wing, he let go and ran away quickly.\nKevin wanted to chase them, but Li Xia held him back. “Don’t run around; they’ve already run far away, and you can’t catch up. You’re not familiar with the terrain; what will you do if you get lost?”\nThe little guy couldn’t break free, so he relaxed dejectedly. “Auntie, I want to play with my brothers and sister. Can you let them play with me?”\n“Then do you know why your brothers and sister didn’t take you with them?”\n“Because my mother said they were wild kids, unsophisticated. And it would turn me into an unsophisticated kid, too. But that’s what my mother said. I like my brothers and sister, and I like to go out and play. I don’t want to stay at home and play the piano all day.”\n“Kevin,”\nAnnie came out of the backyard while talking. Kevin hid behind Li Xia as soon as he heard his mother calling him. Li Xia got up and went into the kitchen, and Annie took him back to the backyard.\nSoon the sound of the piano could be heard, and soon Annie’s scolding followed. Qin Mu shook her head, feeling very sympathetic towards the little guy.\n“Children this young are just at the right age to love playing. I thought you were very strict with your three children and were willing to spend money on them. But I didn’t expect Annie to be even more strict… Kevin is about the same age as Yiyi, but he is actually asked to practice the piano for six hours a day. My God, let alone a child, an adult would not be able to sit still either.”\n“That’s how pianists are made.” Facing Qin Mu’s surprised eyes, she continued, “Talent alone is not enough without hard work. These three members of my family just practice as a hobby, and I don’t have time to watch them practice every day. It’s up to you; I don’t want them to become pianists.”\n“It’s not easy for children. My family doesn’t care about anything else except school. They don’t do homework during holidays and just play all day. They are still young. If they don’t play now, they won’t have free time when they have jobs, start families, and have heavy burdens.”\n“Your two children are doing well in their studies, right?”\nShen Haiyang got married late, so Han Jun, who is younger than him, has a child who is older than Shen Hui. The older one is in the third grade, and the younger one is in the first grade.\n“Not bad. Not as good as your Shen Hui, but we don’t ask for too much; 70 or 80 is good enough.”\nLi Xia never figured out whether it was more important for children to have a happy childhood or to seize the time to learn. So she was split between the two, letting them learn as much as they could within their capacity. The more they learn when they are young, the wider the road ahead and the greater the choices they will have.\nThe couple didn’t come to the table for dinner. This has been going on for days. Li Xia didn’t even call them. Eat it or not. Who indulges in your bad habits? If you want to eat Western food, cook it yourself or go out for dinner.\nShen Yaozong tried to persuade the old man but failed, and the family of three was stuck here these days. They wanted to leave, but they were afraid that the old man would leave all his property to Shen Haiyang. If they stayed, the conditions were too difficult for them to adapt to.\nAfter dinner, Li Xia learned that the family of three had left with their luggage. She thought they couldn’t stand it anymore, so they returned to the United States overnight. However, the family of three came back the next morning.\n“Half a month. I will leave after half a month. I can’t stand it here anymore.”\nAnnie gave Shen Yaozong an ultimatum at the gate, and Shen Yaozong frowned and nodded, very annoyed with the current situation. On the contrary, Kevin liked this place very much, and as soon as he entered the door, he broke away from his mother’s hand and went to find Shen Hui.\n“Brother, brother, I…”\n“Kevin, come back here.”\nAnnie was furious and said she couldn’t tolerate her son’s behavior. He was such a good and fashionable child, but after such a short time back home, he actually liked rolling hoops, skipping rubber ropes, and playing with eggs.\nHow could this be possible? She would never allow her westernized son to become a country boy.\nKevin was stopped by his mother, and his plan to find his brother failed again. The family of three went to the backyard, and soon the piano sounded again. But this time it was not rhythmic piano music but a chaotic mess, and the heart of the listener lost its rhythm.\nLi Xia glanced at Shen Haiyang, then turned and walked towards the backyard. She hurried over, and before the old man standing at the door could speak, she pulled the brat off the piano bench.\nKevin was frightened by his aunt’s angry look, and for a moment he was as quiet as a cicada and dared not speak. Anne was also very angry about her son’s disruptive behavior and was ready to teach him a lesson, but she was immediately unhappy because someone else had done it first.\n“Li Xia, you treat your nephew like this.”\n“Go, leave here right now.” The old man didn’t wait for her to finish, and he drove them away directly, holding his chest. He didn’t say it to his daughter-in-law but to Shen Yaozong, who looked apologetic.\n“I can’t afford to be pampered like this. Take your wife and children and leave now.”\n“Dad, I’m sorry.”\n“No need to apologize; just leave now.”\nAfter being kicked out by his father, Shen Yaozong lost all his temper. He started to complain to Annie, but Annie took the child and left without paying any attention to him.\n“I didn’t want to stay any longer anyway, so you can stay if you want.”\nThe woman took the child away. Kevin turned around and stretched out his hand to call Daddy, but he was too small to resist. His mother held him back, and he couldn’t stop.\nOn that day, the mother and son bought train tickets to Shanghai and then flew back to the United States. Shen Yaozong was in a dilemma and could not help but blame his father and Shen Haiyang again. It was all Shen Haiyang’s fault. If it weren’t for him, his father would not have given up his development in the United States and returned to this backward place.\nA new barbecue stall had just opened on the street. After drinking two bottles of beer, he knocked on the door of the Shen family. It was ten o’clock at night, and it was Shen Haiyang who answered the door.\n“Shen Haiyang, you are really my nemesis.”\n“Then you should stay away from me.”\n“It was you who broke into my life.”\n“I already exist, and it won’t change because of you.”\nShen Yaozong gritted his teeth in hatred, but he could do nothing about the current situation. The old man wanted him to stay and manage the factory, but he was not optimistic about opening a factory on the mainland, and he could not accept the living environment on the mainland.\nThe next day, he was carrying his luggage, looking like he was leaving, and said only one sentence to the old man when he said goodbye: “Don’t forget, you still have a son like me.”\nThe old man sighed and wanted to learn from his American parents. He was already so old, and as a father, he should not care about him anymore and let him bump into things on his own.\nHowever, he was educated in China since he was young, and he returned to his roots when he got old. The ancients’ thoughts suppressed his Western ideas abroad for decades. Seeing the huge business opportunities and the dragon that was beginning to take off, he wanted him to take off with the east wind and feel the patriotism in his blood.\n“You know very well that our previous business can no longer continue. It’s time to seek a breakthrough. China is now reforming, and the population alone is a huge market. From small things like food, drink, and defecation to various household items, No matter what you do, there are many choices. Don’t be so impetuous; calm down and observe carefully. Do good market research; don’t just listen to what others say. Use your own eyes to see.”\nThe old man spoke, and Shen Yaozong stayed with simple words. He returned to the east room, and the old man looked at his back and shook his head. If you want to stay, I have to treat you well. But you are not a decent kid. I will give you time to slowly understand this country. Don’t be prejudiced; go and experience it yourself.\n",
    "61": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c39/\nCHAPTER 39\nShen Yaozong didn’t leave, but he usually stayed in the backyard at home and didn’t have much interaction with the front yard, so they didn’t bother each other. The old man asked him to observe carefully and do market research. He often went out, and no one knew what he was doing.\nLi Xia just got her driver’s license, and the old man gave heran imported an imported American car. She was so surprised that she didn’t know what to do. She looked back at her husband,, thanked him,him, and accepted it. The old man’s actions were all for his son. If Shen Haiyang said to accept it, she would accept it.\nThe children were looking at the new car and were and were very happy. They had ridden in Grandpa’s car many times before, but this one belonged to their family, so it felt different. Li Xia wanted to take the children for a ride, but the old man asked the couple to go in and talk, so she said hello to the children and asked them to wait.\nAfter entering the house, she made milk powder for the father and son, and the three of them sat down on the sofa to talk. The old man did not beat around the bush and directly took out two passbooks from an envelope and handed them to Shen Haiyang. Li Xia leaned over and saw that they were all in foreign languages.\n“What”What is this?”\n“Two deposits, put in the Federal Bank. One for $200,000 is for Haiyang’s future medical treatment. If he needs surgery, this will definitely be enough. The other $300,000 is for the three children’s future college education. It’s enough, according to the current Harvard tuition. If there are any changes in the future, we will make adjustments.”\nLi Xia finally understood what he meant by “he is too old to have anything else but money.” Some of his assets in the United States have been transferred back to China, but most of them are still in the United States. The money from partners is the biggest part, and there is no need to transfer money back and forth between the two countries. The cash went directly into his account, which was a way to manage his assets while making arrangements for his children and grandchildren.\nIn addition to the investment, the old man kept the cash for his son and grandson independently, which was not affected by his investment or Li Xia’s business. The old man said nothing, mailed the passbook back, and bought a car before giving it to them.\n“Thank you.” Shen Haiyang said, not for the money, but for his kindness.\n“I want to thank Grandpa on behalf of the three children.” Li Xia thanked him sincerely. The old man treated the two children she brought with her and Shen Hui equally, which was worthy of her respect.\n“But, Dad, it’s not easy to study abroad in the United States, right? Huihui and Yiyi can work hard on their own, but I’m afraid Huihua won’t be able to pass the exam with her grades in painting.”\nThe old man sat back with a smile on his face. “You can also study at an art school in the United States.”\n“Um.”\nThat’s great; her daughter can go abroad in the future. In the 1990s, students studying abroad were so rich. As for whether the money was enough, if not, she would pay for it. And looking at the old man, once his factory was running, it would make a fortune, so there was no need for her to pay for it.\nShe put away the passbook and calmed down. “Dad, let’s go out for a drive to test the new car. Do you want to come?”\n“I won’t go. I’ll just take a stroll around the area. Please drive carefully.”\n“Ohkay, I know.”\nThe passbook was put away, and the children were taken for a ride. The new car performed very well, but Li Xia was not very good at driving. She would brake immediately if there was any disturbance on the road.\n“Mom, it’s the way you drove that caused the three of us to almost fall into the front glass.” Huihua touched her nose, which had just hit the back of the front seat.\n“Dad’s driving is still the best.” Yiyi touched his nose and offered his opinion.\n“Mom, you should practice more in the future. It seems that you will become more stable the more you drive.” Shen Hui said this in a rather subtle way and reached out to touch his forehead.\nLi Xia also knew that she had stepped on the brakes too hard. If her husband, who was sitting in the passenger seat, had not been wearing a seat belt, he would have been thrown into the windshield. She smiled embarrassedly, and Shen Haiyang spoke up to help his wife out.\n“Don’t discourage mom’s enthusiasm. Mom just got her driver’s license, so it’s inevitable that she’s nervous. It’s good that she knows how to brake. At least she won’t drive into the ditch or hit a tree.”\nThe three kids looked at each other without saying anything, then smiled secretly. What? Dad, you have such low expectations. It’s good enough as long as your wife doesn’t throw you into the ditch.\nSeeing the children laughing in the rearview mirror, Li Xia also smiled. Driving is a matter of practice. Her husband was right. She would become good at driving after driving more.\nBefore going to bed at night, she played with the car keys and said, “It seems that everything the old man gave you is cheap to me now.”\nThe house and the shop were all in her name. Because of the nature of his job, he certainly couldn’t drive to work, so the old man gave the car to her. The old man also made preparations for the children’s education fund and the money for his medical treatment, so she now has no worries.\n“Husband and wife are one; what’s mine is yours.”\nShe smiled brightly and put her arm around her husband’s waist. “The old man intends to let Shen Yaozong stay to manage the factory. If you are not interested in this kind of job, will the old man train you to do business?”\n“He mentioned it before, and I refused.”\n“I knew he wouldn’t be so partial.”\nShen Haiyang likes his job very much. The old man has never raised him since he was a child, so he has no right to persuade him to change his career. He would probably be turned down by his cold attitude as soon as he opened his mouth.\n“We are just the two of us; let me say a few more words to you.” She looked like she was talking about a private conversation between husband and wife. Shen Haiyang nodded silently, and she continued.\n“The old man grew up in China and has a filter for China. Now is indeed a good time for development, and his judgment is correct. He thinks this place is good and wants his youngest son to open up a new world here. As a mother, I understand his heart as a father very well.\nHowever, Shen Yaozong grew up in the United States and was taught that China was very poor and backward. In fact, it is indeed the case now. Will there be any problems with such a big difference between father and son? ”\n“It’s true that the old man wants to keep Shen Yaozong in China to manage the business, but he won’t force Shen Yaozong to stay if he insists. Now Shen Yaozong can’t persuade the old man to return to the United States, but he is reluctant to give up all these and leave on his own. The old man wants Shen Yaozong to know more about China, but it’s hard to say how effective it will be. As you said, without filters, people in China are all eager to go abroad, not to mention that he grew up abroad.”\n“Shen Yaozong is the same. If you don’t like this place, just leave. According to the old man’s style, no matter who manages the factory, these properties will definitely belong to you two brothers in the future. Is he afraid that the old man will leave it all to you and he won’t get a share?”\n“He is not optimistic about the domestic situation. I think he is probably worried that the old man will lose everything he has in his life. When the big river dries up, there will be no small river left, and everyone will be left with nothing.”\nLi Xia had never thought of this. However, from a different perspective, as someone who grew up in the United States, the current situation in China is really not good. The number of returning overseas Chinese only increased in the 1990s, and now they are all bold and sharp-sighted.\n“Well, do you want to remind the old man?”\n“He knows what he is doing. He gave Shen Yaozong a way out and asked him to stay and observe for a while. As for effectiveness, it’s hard to say. How to do it is his business.”\n“Okay, just a quick chat with you. Time to go to bed. Sleep.”\nThe next day, Li Xia went to apply for a business license. The weather was not good, so she drove out. Nowadays, there are few cars on the road, so she drove to the Industry and Commerce Bureau quickly.\n“Rainbow, the name of the store is Rainbow.”\nAfter applying for a business license, she expanded the scope of her business as much as possible. She grouped all the fabric and clothing products together and then opened a hardware business. With the development of the times, people’s requirements for housing and home furnishings are getting higher and higher, and hardware products are definitely selling well.\nTo get a business license, things have to be done step by step. When she returned home at night, the front yard was quiet, and Qin Mu was picking vegetables in the yard. She came to help, and Qin Mu chatted with her.\n“Your second brother-in-law came back this morning and advised the old man to withdraw his investment and return to the United States. He said that he would lose everything here. Tell me, is our country really so unpromising? Every day he is unwilling to help his father with his work, and the more he sees, the more he advises the old man to give up.”\n“For many years, our country has been labeled poor, and now the living standard is far behind that of the United States. He doubts our country’s consumption capacity, but he should not doubt the old man’s investment vision. This man is too conceited or stubborn. He probably won’t believe something even if the facts don’t slap him in the face.”\nQin Mu looked up at her and said, “Is the United States really that good? Are we so far behind them? Otherwise, why would they look down on everything?”\n“I heard that there is a big difference. Nowadays, going abroad is popular, and many people in big cities are scrambling to go abroad. There are only a few who are willing to pay any price to go abroad, and those who have a long-term vision like the old man are few and farsighted.”\nIn her previous life, she heard about a story about a man in Beijing who sold his courtyard house and went to the United States. When he returned to China ten years later, he found that his wealth accumulated in the past ten years abroad was not even worth one fifth of the money he had spent buying that house.\n“You have good vision.”\nQin Mu admired her very much. Li Xia smiled and said nothing. She was cheating, standing on the shoulders of giants. But she didn’t deserve the praise. She walked and pondered, and the things she saw and heard on TV in her previous life were slowly put into practice. In the process of practicing, she discovered new things. She was changing little by little, just like in this era.\nThe family chatted at the dinner table, and the old man asked about Li Xia, and she said she went to apply for a business license. “There are so many people; this year is obviously different from last year.”\n“It’s changing little by little, and only those who observe carefully can see it.”\nThe old man picked up a piece of tofu, moved his chopsticks towards Shen Haiyang next to him, and finally put it steadily into his bowl. The father and son met each other’s eyes, and Shen Haiyang said thank you in a low voice.\nBecause Shen Yaozong’s family was not at home, Shen Haiyang’s family had dinner with the old man in the backyard. The old man tried to pick up some food for his son, and when he saw that it was successful, he smiled and picked up a piece of braised pork for his grandson.\n“Children are growing up, so they should eat more meat.”\n“Thank you, Grandpa.”\nYiyi smiled and held out the bowl. “Grandpa, I want one too.”\n“Okay, all of them.”\nAfter clipping and drawing for her, the little girl looked up and thanked him generously. She was nine years old, and she had grown a lot in the past two years. Girls develop early, and when they stand together, she is taller than Shen Hui.\nThe old man likes children, and Li Xia and her husband are also happy to have them get close. They eat and talk at the table; the little ones chatter about their holiday lives, and the adults chat with them from time to time.\nWithout that family, they ate in harmony. The old man drank a bowl of grain porridge with some side dishes. He didn’t eat much and basically didn’t eat meat, but he required meat for every meal. It was very convenient to buy things by exchanging US dollars for foreign exchange certificates.\n",

Her own store was about to be completed, and she was busy with decoration, purchasing, hiring, and finding sources of goods.\nShe could make some money from the project this time, and the three shops would do wholesale business by the end of the year, and based on her experience, she could make several times more. Money was no longer a problem. Life was no longer stressful.\nBut now she seems to be addicted to making money. She has already become one of the first to get rich, but she still doesn’t want to stop making money. No matter how much money the old man leaves Shen Haiyang in the future, her career is the result of her own hard work. It is the source of her confidence and self-confidence.\nBefore the shop was completed, she was going to go south again. This time, she wanted a lot of goods, and she couldn’t do it alone. In the evening, she went to Qin Mu’s house with her. When Han Jun saw that she came to his house in person, he guessed that she was going south.\n“To be honest, I want to take a leave of absence. It’s boring every day; I might as well run around outside.”\n“Really? I’m planning to do a hardware business; men are more sensitive in this field. And the goods going back and forth will be very heavy. If you are really interested, I won’t ask someone else to be responsible.”\nHan Jun thought about it in silence, then nodded. He had considered the decision to take a leave of absence for a long time. Seeing that Li Xia’s family was living so well while his family of four was still squeezed into a small house of dozens of square meters with a pile of debts that he didn’t know when to pay off, the thought of making money kept coming up.\n“I’ll learn more about this business first, and then I’ll work hard for you.”\n“We will head south tomorrow night. Once we get there, you can go around and learn more about it. Then we can look for a suitable source of goods based on our needs.”\n“Okay, I’ll pick you up tomorrow night.”\nThe three of them set out on this trip with Li Xia and her assistants, Han Jun and Xiao Liu. They dressed simply, arrived at the forefront of reform, and opened up smoothly.\nWhen she got off the train, she ran into an acquaintance. It was Murong Danling and Zhang Qiuhua who got off from a few carriages away. The two glanced at each other without saying a word and then went their separate ways after leaving the train station.\nLi Xia’s main purpose of this trip was to find a suitable supplier, which was not something that could be done in a short time. The three of them found a cheap guesthouse and booked two rooms. After washing up, they split up and went to the industrial zone.\nThis time, she mainly visited clothing factories, visiting each one and selecting the hot items she thought of. In the 1980s, clothing was still based on style and price. People did not pay attention to brand, workmanship, fabrics, etc., which were ranked after price and style.\nShe is selecting the most suitable clothes for this era. Currently, they only make adult clothes. She is selecting autumn clothes and winter clothes and planning the purchase order. Coming out of the clothing factory, Xiao Liu is amazed when she holds the purchase order.\n“Sister, I think you can open a clothing factory.”\nLi Xia’s business volume is indeed increasing, and she has more and more small business owners developing offline. But if she wants to open a clothing factory, where should she position it?\nHigh-end clothing, designers, pattern making, etc. require a lot of investment, and there has not been much market for high-end clothing in recent years. Low-end clothing has been OK in recent years, but it will be very difficult in a few years. You can only do OEM for orders, and you can only wait for death if you can’t get orders.\nCan she run a garment factory? After thinking about it for a few days, she decided to give it a try. At the beginning, she took the low-end development route. There was a textile enterprise in her province, and the fabrics could be purchased nearby. The wages of workers are also very low nowadays, and there is no problem finding female workers. She won by price, made some money in the next few years, and then seized the opportunity to transform after a few years.\nThis is an era of rapid change. If you do something unchanged, you will soon be eliminated. After realizing this, she no longer plans to do anything that will last a long time. Anyway, you have to keep up with the times. Falling behind a little bit may be a disaster.\nNot to mention her small investment; even if the electronics factory invested by her father-in-law did not seize the opportunity to transform and develop, the golden age of black and white televisions would be over.\nRun a garment factory to accumulate funds, and then expand into other fields when the time is right. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If one industry encounters a crisis, there are other industries to support it, so all will not fall at once.\nWith the intention of opening a clothing factory, she paid close attention to matters in this regard and judged whether the time was right. In the evening, while having dinner at a restaurant, she heard someone talking about jeans, and after listening for a while, she realized that the other person was a pattern designer.\nJeans were not popular at that time, but they would soon become popular and a favorite among young people. Li Xia looked at the sample from a distance, then walked up to the other party and started a conversation.\n“Do you sell this version?”\nThe woman was stunned for a moment, then nodded and said, “Sell it.” Afraid that Li Xia didn’t understand, she told her about the origin of jeans and how popular they were in the West.\n“This kind of pants will definitely be popular among young people. As a product favored by the main consumers, it will definitely make money.”\nLi Xia nodded. She certainly knew how popular jeans would be in the future. The model in the woman’s hand was good, just suitable for young people’s aesthetics. They sat down and talked in depth. The other party was eager to sell, and finally Li Xia bought three pairs of jeans without spending much money.\nDuring the conversation, Li Xia learned that the lady surnamed Min was a fashion designer, and she immediately exchanged contact information with her. After buying three pairs of jeans, she began to think carefully about how to operate them.\nIn which year did jeans become popular? It seems that her investment vision is a bit ahead of her time. However, she didn’t plan to make a living now after buying it, but just picked up a bargain to prepare for the future.\nThe popular ones nowadays are Decca straight-leg pants. The fitted Decca material has straight and ironed trouser seams, which are dignified and formal. The ordinary and cheap ones are the simplest wide straight-leg pants. Most people wear this kind of pants, and she has the most of them every time she purchases them.\n“Sister, are these jeans really going to be popular? Now that you’ve bought the pattern, what are you going to do next?”\nIt is definitely popular, but nowadays, denim fabrics are all imported, and the price is definitely higher than ordinary clothes. There is definitely no market for it now.\n“Don’t worry, it will be useful later.”\nWithout the impact of imported goods in the past few years, not many people can accept this fashionable thing. If you rashly bet your life on it, you may lose everything. The timing must be just right. Being too early or too late may lead to failure.\n“What did you say, sister?”\n“Nothing.”\nShe had never seen denim in many clothing factories before, so she went to look for it. It turned out that there was only one Hong Kong company producing this kind of pants on the market. And it was not targeting ordinary people.\nThe retail price is around 100 yuan, which is equivalent to more than two months’ salary for an ordinary worker. Fuck, at this price, selling it now is simply courting death. The timing is not right; this thing has to wait.\n“Oh my god, these jeans are too expensive!”\nXiao Liu was amazed at the trousers, rubbing them carefully, and she really didn’t understand why they were so expensive. Li Xia also shook her head silently, thinking that these trousers were obviously hard-wearing and dirt-resistant trousers worn by working people in Western countries, so how did they become a luxury item in their country?\n“Sister, this thing will definitely not sell in the north.”\nLi Xia put down her jeans and nodded silently. “Let’s go and take a look at that cotton clothing factory.”\nToday, the degree of reform and opening up in the north is really different from that of the frontier. Most people are very satisfied with having a stable job, and very few are doing business. With that level of consumption, no matter what you sell, you have to win by price.\nThis stage is not yet the peak season of October, so this time she compared the prices of three stores. No, she compared the prices of all stores. After comparing, selecting, and bargaining, she began to place orders.\nThis time, the purchase volume is large, and she uses the two-month off-season to decide on the clothing for the entire winter and the New Year. The price can be lowered, and the quality will be better than in the peak season. As for the styles that others are considering, she believes in her own vision as a person who has experienced them.\nAfter the clothes were ordered, the factory began to speed up production, and she began to buy accessories. From scarves and hats to hairpins and rubber bands, she placed large orders for the styles she liked.\nHan Jun also found a suitable manufacturer for hardware accessories, and he selected the goods that were most needed locally. Li Xia also placed large orders, which frightened Han Jun so much that he wanted to stop her.\n“Sister-in-law, with so many goods, if you can’t sell them all at once, you’ll be stuck with a lot of money. By then, you won’t be able to recover the money, and it will be piled up.”\n“I know what’s going on; don’t worry.”\nThe biggest advantage of hardware is that it is not afraid of spoilage or expiration. Now that prices are rising, if you have a backlog of these things, the price may double in a year. She can put them in the warehouse and sell them slowly; anyway, it is a sure profit. Moreover, her father-in-law’s factory needs a lot of them. These are all of good quality. How can there be a large backlog if she sells the first batch of goods first?\nAll goods are negotiated with the manufacturer for a 70% down payment, and the remaining balance is to be paid in March of the following year. Although it cannot be refunded, she must pay the balance regardless of whether she has a backlog or makes money due, but she is confident in her vision.\n",
    "63": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c40/\nCHAPTER 40\nSeeing that the goods were almost ordered, they prepared to return. On the train platform, the two familiar faces were seen again in the afterglow of the setting sun. They came from the consignment side. Murong Danling walked slowly; her face was pale and sick, as if she had just had a serious illness.\nThe two carriages were next to each other, and Murong Danling saw them when they were queuing. The woman looked pale and tired, but the moment she saw Li Xia, she immediately stood up like a hedgehog with spikes all over her body, raised her head and chest, and looked like a victorious rooster.\nLi Xia turned her head and ignored her. Soon the train came over, the attendant opened the door of the carriage, and everyone began to board the train in an orderly manner. Because it was the starting station, there was plenty of time, and there was no problem of not being able to get on the train, so this station was the least crowded and the most harmonious.\nThey had been sitting in hard seats for several days, but this time they didn’t get a seat under the seat. There were a lot of people on the return trip, and the carriage was packed with people. If you wanted to go to the toilet, you had to follow the cart selling cigarettes, beer, and drinks. Li Xia bought three seats in the dining car, and this time the three of them could sit comfortably and drink tea and chat.\n“A female passenger in carriage No. 10 has fainted. If there is a doctor on board, please rush to carriage No. 10 to rescue her.”\nLi Xia went to get some water when the announcement came over the radio. The dining car was in carriage number nine, and next to it was carriage number ten. Sure enough, there was a lot of noise over there, and she seemed to hear Zhang Qiuhua’s voice faintly.\nThe incident was very close to the water-receiving area where she was. The water was not turned on yet. She squeezed over while waiting and stood on tiptoe to look inside. At this time, a doctor heard the broadcast and rushed over. Everyone made way for a passage, and Li Xia saw that it was Murong Danling lying on the three-person chair.\nShe was lying quietly on the chair with no blood on her face, and her pants were all red. The doctor came over to check on her, and Zhang Qiuhua, who was holding her body, told the doctor about the situation.\n“She had a miscarriage three days ago and had a curettage in the hospital.”\nThe doctor looked up at the passengers and said, “If you have any sheets, please take them out to cover her. Thank you.”\nSome passengers actually brought these things with them, and they immediately went to get them. Under the coordination of the flight attendants and the police, a small, independent space was separated with sheets.\nAfter the examination, it was found that the uterine bleeding was caused by overwork after miscarriage, and this situation could not be treated on the train. Soon the train arrived at the station, which was a small town. With the help of the staff, Zhang Qiuhua took Murong Danling off the train and sought medical treatment nearby.\nLi Xia and the others continued to sit, waiting to get off the train. She and Xiao Liu both had swollen lower limbs, but Han Jun’s physical condition was not serious. The three of them stood on the platform and slowly moved their limbs, while some female passengers walked out of the station quickly, probably because they couldn’t hold it in any longer.\n“Let’s go; let’s find a toilet first.”\nNot only did she hold it in for almost a day, she also didn’t eat much that day because the environment really made her lose her appetite. She went to the toilet to solve her personal problem, and after coming out, Li Xia generously took a taxi home. There are many three-wheeled taxis in the provincial capital this year, and everyone calls this kind of car a three-wheeled taxi.\n“Sister, let’s go to the bathhouse and take a bath.”\nThe train ride was so long, and just thinking about the environment on the train made them feel itchy all over. Everyone was working hard to make money. It was not easy to buy a sleeper berth during this period, especially for people like them who were in a hurry to sell goods. They often had hard seats. After such a long round trip, a few people’s legs were not swollen.\n“Wash your hands and face before eating, or you’ll pass out in the bathhouse.”\nWhen the three of them got home, Qin Mu quickly arranged to pour them some water, some for drinking and some for washing. Han Jun took off his outer shirt and hung it on the rope in the yard.\n“Wife, go and make some food quickly. We have been hungry all day.”\n“Okay.” The woman said, pulling off her apron and tying it on. “Why didn’t you eat all day? You forgot to bring some dry food along the way. There should be some for sale on the train. Even if it’s more expensive, don’t go hungry all the time.”\n“Don’t mention it.”\nSeeing his wife, Han Jun also started to complain. In fact, there were too many people on this train. There was no water in the second half of the trip, and the bathroom was inaccessible. He didn’t want to eat, even if he had food. He ate a bowl of rice, while Li Xia and Xiao Liu didn’t finish their meals even with the windows open.\n“I’m so hungry that I want to die. The rolled noodles you make, sister-in-law, are so delicious.” Xiao Liu is very slim and usually a bit picky about food, but today she thinks ordinary noodles are better than a full banquet.\n“Hmm. These noodles are really delicious.” Li Xia also put down her bowl.\n“Wife, another half bowl.”\nHan Jun used the largest bowl of noodles, and the grown man still felt unfull after finishing his meal. Qin Mu scooped up another bowl with her chopsticks, met his dissatisfied gaze, and began to explain.\n“Don’t eat too much at once. I’ll make it for you in the evening.”\nWell, that’s the truth. Li Xia and Xiao Liu stopped eating, put down their bowls, stood up, and walked around, then packed up their things and went to the bathhouse together.\nAfter eating and drinking, they took a bath and felt like they had stretched their muscles and bones. They felt alive when they got home in the evening. The three children came to greet Li Xia after school and heard that their mother had worked hard all the way and did not want any gifts. Huihua pointed to the bed and asked her mother to lie down.\n“Let me massage your legs.”\n“I’ll give it to mom too.”\n“And I.”\nThe children rushed to give their mother a massage, and in the end, this job was snatched by Shen Haiyang. “Hurry up and do your homework, and then practice the piano. Otherwise, you are not allowed to watch TV tonight.”\nThe kids all left, leaving the couple alone in the house. “The shop was completed yesterday and can be renovated. How do you want to do it? How about I go over with you tomorrow to take a look?”\n“Okay, I’ll take a look first, and then decide.” She turned her head and said, “Where’s Shen Yaozong? Has he done anything weird recently?”\n“Everything is normal. I didn’t hear anything.”\n“Oh, by the way. I met Murong Danling on the road. She had a miscarriage and was bleeding heavily on the train. She was sent to F City Hospital. Do you think I should tell Huihui about this?”\n“Is she safe?”\n“I have no idea.”\n“Wait a minute; I’ll find out what’s going on.”\nWhile the couple was busy renovating their shop, they inquired about Murong Danling. Later, they learned that she was rescued and returned to the provincial capital after staying in the city hospital for a few days. They heard that her uterus had been removed and she would never be able to get pregnant again.\n“Huihui, Shen Hui,”\nThe couple just said that since everything was fine, they shouldn’t tell the child. Shen Hui was a thoughtful child, and he might feel bad if he knew. They didn’t plan to tell him, but someone kept disturbing them. The one who came to call Shen Hui was his grandmother. The elderly woman walked straight in from the front door with a cane. She was so unsteady that they didn’t dare to stop her, for fear that she would fall to the ground accidentally.\nShen Hui came out of the house when he heard the shouting. The old woman quickened her pace when she saw him. “Hui, did you know that your mother almost died? Why didn’t you say you would go see her? She missed you so much.”\nShen Hui was a little confused and subconsciously turned back to look at his father. Shen Haiyang told his son about the matter. His tone and expression indicated that it was up to you. If you want to see your mother, go ahead, and I won’t stop you.\n“Let’s go and see your mother with grandma.”\n“I’m not going. Since she’s fine now, just let her take good care of herself.”\nShen Hui broke free from the old woman’s hand, and the old woman pointed at his trembling arm. “You are such a heartless little bastard; that’s your biological mother. You didn’t even go to see her when she was in such big trouble; do you still have your mother in your heart?”\n“She asked you to come to me.”\nThe child still remembered the last time Murong Danling wanted to beat him; her eyes were bloodshot as if he were an enemy. What was wrong with this woman? If she hated him, didn’t like him, or even hated him, then why did she come to him?\n“Whether she said it or not, as a son, you should go see her.”\n“I won’t go.” He refused categorically, then turned back to the house, muttering to himself quietly, “As long as she is fine, I hope she is fine.”\nThe old lady wanted to pull him back, but unfortunately, she failed. She turned around and wanted to say something to Shen Haiyang, but Shen Haiyang also turned around and went into the house. Both the father and son ignored her, and she was so angry that she yelled a few words in the yard before her eldest daughter came in and helped her walk away.\nShen Hui smiled softly after learning that Murong Danling could no longer have children. “No wonder you thought of me again.”\nIs it because of this? No, in fact, Murong Danling never said she wanted to see him. All this was just the old woman’s own idea. Her daughter couldn’t have children anymore, and she only had Shen Hui in her life. Things were different now, and she felt that her daughter should get closer to her son.\nLi Xia was busy decorating her shop, and several shops next to each other on the same floor agreed to do the decoration together. At that time, decoration was not that complicated. It was just a simple matter of painting the walls, laying the floor, connecting the electricity, putting up the shelves and samples, and then opening the shop.\nThe warehouses of the shops are reserved for the malls, and private ones have to find their own. Li Xia considered it for a long time and decided to rent a reverse house close to the street. It’s just a warehouse; the most important thing is that it is dry and convenient for transportation. This reverse house is not easy to live in because it is in the shade, but it is definitely convenient for storing things. You just need to open a door from the street side.\nShe rode her bike around the area, thinking the closer, the better. Finally, she found a house with six rooms in a row. Outside was a street, which was quite wide. Not only tricycles but also trucks could enter. But they didn’t want to rent it; they wanted to sell it.\n“I’m going abroad, so I’ll clean up this house all at once.”\nIf it had been two months ago, she would have bought it without even having to spend money. But after she went south to place a large order, she had to decorate the shop and order shelves when she came back, so she didn’t have enough money to buy the house.\n“Let me consider it.”\n“As soon as possible, there have been several people asking about this house in the past few days.”\n“Okay, I’ll do it as soon as possible.”\nEveryone is looking for a warehouse; the competition is really fierce. But most people are probably like her; where do they get so much liquidity? She will go home and see where to get the best money.\nRiding her bike towards the main road, she met Murong Danling selling goods at the end of the path. It has been less than a month since her miscarriage; why is she so eager to come out to work? Making money is important, but health is more important. Her body is blocking the view of what she is selling, but she had bought goods with Zhang Qiuhua before, and the goods she bought are very intriguing.\nThe man was talking to a customer, and when he saw her, he quickly put his things away. At this moment, a voice called out, “The police are coming,” and she ran away quickly with her bag. Her speed was almost as fast as that of a sprinter. She disappeared on the street in the blink of an eye.\nWhy can’t you do some honest business? This kind of thing can make a lot of money, but you really have to worry about going bankrupt one day.\nShe rode her bike home, and Murong Danling gritted her teeth in hatred, thinking that she was the one who reported her. When she told Zhang Qiuhua about it, Zhang Qiuhua thought it was not the case.\n“For this kind of thing, we need to search for the stuff. Our stuff is all in a secret place. The two things you have with you, if you are caught, you can say you brought them for a friend. Li Xia is not that stupid. Reporting this won’t catch us, and it won’t benefit her. She won’t do something that won’t hurt anyone and won’t benefit herself.”\n“You shouldn’t have contacted her in the first place; otherwise, she wouldn’t know anything about us. What if she reports us under her real name? If the police target us, we’ll be exposed sooner or later.”\n“Let’s buy some fabrics and sell them, or borrow someone else’s stall to sell fabrics and hide them from others. The most important thing is to hide it from Li Xia so that we don’t have to worry about her reporting us.”\n“OK.”\nLi Xia rode her bike home. She didn’t tell the police that she knew Murong Danling. She didn’t know what she was doing, so she couldn’t make random guesses. It was the police’s job to crack down on illegal activities, and they had already taken action.\n“It’s coming all together.”\n“What are you talking about?” Shen Haiyang came in from outside.\n“I went to rent a warehouse, but the other party wanted to sell it. I couldn’t come up with so much money all at once, so I was thinking about where to get some money from.”\nShen Haiyang smiled and took out a remittance slip from his bag. “The rent from Beijing has been sent all at once. How much is left after adding this? We’ll find a way.”\nLi Xia took it and looked at it, then happily lowered her head and kissed the remittance slip. “It’s a timely relief, and with these, it won’t be much of a difference.”\nShen Haiyang came closer and pointed at his cheek. “Shouldn’t you kiss it?”\nLi Xia turned her head and glanced out the window. Before she could look back, he kissed her on the cheek. The past two years of business had been hard, but she had bought good skin care products, so her skin was well protected. It was smooth and tender, with a faint fragrance.\nThe couple looked at each other and smiled embarrassedly. Li Xia added her own money and the rent together and found that she was still a little short of the amount. It was not worth asking the old man for such a small amount of money. She was very principled and did not embezzle the project funds. She thought of other ways to solve the problem.\n“Oh, I saw Murong Danling today. When the police came, she disappeared in the blink of an eye.”\n“This person…” Shen Haiyang shook his head and said, “Her courage is not the same as your courage. Forget it; I don’t know what to say about her.”\nThe couple was wondering if Murong Danling was doing anything illegal, and within two days they ran into her and Zhang Qiuhua selling fabrics at a stall. Li Xia suddenly felt that she was overthinking, so she rode her bike past quickly, no longer thinking about whether the goods were parallel imports or not.\nRiding a bicycle to the old house, the two tenants came to give rent, which had been overdue for a week. This time they were asked to pay six months at a time, and the two tenants were immediately unhappy. The couple living in the east room came out of the house, and the woman began to cry poor to Li Xia.\n“Sister-in-law, don’t you think half a year is too much? Since I gave birth to a child, my family’s expenses have increased. Raising a child is really expensive. My in-laws and my own family don’t give me any money. Life is hard, and I really don’t have any savings. I’m thinking of borrowing some money from my colleagues for three months’ rent; otherwise, there won’t be enough for my family.”\n“Yeah, raising a child is really expensive. I wanted to give you more time, but you’re giving me another half year. That’s too much.”\nLiu Biao’s wife was not happy either. Every time she paid the rent, she said she would wait. Every time it happened, Li Xia was immediately annoyed. The deposit was one-third of the rent, and every time she collected the rent, she was pushed back, and sometimes she had to come several times. Liu Biao was strong and always said he would wait for the salary, and the family in the east room always cried poor. Anyway, they would not pay it all at once, so she had to make more trips and wait for a while.\n“The rent will not increase. It’s just a six-month advance rent. This saves a lot of trouble. If you are willing to pay, then continue to live here. If you are not willing to pay, then move out, and I will find new tenants.”\nLiu Biao came out of the house and said, “We are living here well. Why do you say we can’t live here?”\n“Oh, why? Because I am the owner of this house.”\n“It’s my house; you have lived in it for two years, and you think it belongs to you? You keep making excuses for paying the rent, and I have to go ten times to ask you about it. You even have the nerve to ask me why. If my house is demolished one day, do you still think you should get the demolition fee or get a house? Otherwise, where are you going to live in the future?\n“You…” The young wife in the ear room was a little angry.\n“It’s fine if you don’t want to pay. You’re already a week overdue. I’ll give you five more days to move out.”\n“We’ve been living here for such a long time; how can we just move out when you say so?” Liu Biao started to act tough again.\n“Then I’ll call the police. I just can’t believe it. In a society ruled by law, I can’t make the decision about my own house.”\nLi Xia did what she said, and she didn’t waste time talking to him. She rode her bike to the police station to report the incident. The police officer who answered the call knew Han Jun, and he followed her to the yard without saying a word.\n“No problem; it’s their house, and they have the final say. If they tell you to move out, then move out. Otherwise, you will be charged with trespassing on other people’s property. I’ll detain you for a few days first, and we’ll talk later.”\nMy God, it turns out this is really illegal. This time Liu Biao was no longer stubborn; he handed a cigarette to the police officer, Xiao Liu, nodded and bowed, and began to speak nicely.\n“It’s just that I don’t have money right now. I didn’t say I wouldn’t pay it.”\n“No, I won’t rent this house anymore. I’m not unreasonable. I’ll give you five more days to move out. I’ll come and take possession of the house after five days.”\nEvery time she asks them to pay, they make excuses. Is it really the case that the one who owes the debt is the grandfather, and the one who asks for the debt is the grandson? It’s obviously you who should pay me the rent, but every time I am treated like a beggar, I have to say nice things to you again and again.\n“No, Li Xia, you… We used to live in the same courtyard as our neighbors; don’t go too far.”\n“I went too far.” Li Xia looked at Liu Biao. “It’s my house, and I have the final say. How could I have gone too far?”\n“Where do we live then?”\n“I don’t care where you live. That’s your business. It has nothing to do with me.”\n“I… Officer Liu, we’ve lived in this house for two years; can you just kick us out?”\n“What else can I do? This is someone else’s house. Whether you live here for two years or ten years, it is still someone else’s house. They can make the decision themselves.”\n“Okay, I’ll move.”\nLiu Biao got angry and told the police officer to leave. After the police officer left, he grabbed Li Xia, who was about to ride away.\n“I’m telling you, if you don’t make life easy for me, I won’t make life easy for you either. Even if I move out of this house, I won’t let anyone else live in it.”\n“Liu Biao, if I remember correctly, you work in the third workshop of the machinery factory, right?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Are you not afraid of being fired? So how can you threaten me?” Li Xia sneered and stopped on the ground with her legs supported. “What will your wife, your son, your parents, your family… do when you lose your job ?”\n“You…you dare?”\n“What am I afraid of? If you dare to threaten me and make me live a bad life, I will make you lose your job. Living on the streets is good. If you get drunk and drown in a cesspool, you won’t have to fight with others for a house in your life.”\n“I…” Liu Biao lost his temper and recalled the time when she stopped him from building a small house. At that time, she was the only one in her family, and she was so powerful. Now Shen Haiyang is now familiar with the police, procuratorate, and courts. What dare he do? He dares not do anything.\n“Woman, why do you become more difficult as you get older?”\n“Am I being difficult?” Seeing that he softened his attitude, Li Xia calmly reasoned with him. “You rented my house. Tell me yourself, except for the first time, have you ever paid the rent quickly? I asked for a six-month payment so that I would have to run less. But you acted tough with me as soon as you opened your mouth. Do I have to rent it to you and then go to you again and again to talk nicely and collect the rent?”\n“I will pay half a year’s payment, which is fine.”\n“No.” He shouted, and Li Xia followed suit. Damn, I can’t lose my temper. “I won’t rent it to you anymore. Five days, five days to move out. I don’t want to deal with people like you.”\nLi Xia was about to ride away when Liu Biao grabbed the wheel of her bike. “Add 50 cents a month for half a year; is that okay?”\nLiu Biao’s wife likes cleanliness very much, and the house is well maintained. He suppressed his arrogance, increased the rent, and Li Xia no longer insisted on driving him out. But she has to add conditions and make him understand thoroughly that she has the final say in her house.\n“Add fifty cents every month and pay for a year at a time. Give me the money in three days. If you are not happy, you can move out. It’s quick.” Once a year, it won’t be as hard as before.\n“……good.”\nPeople are like this; they regret when they are manipulated. If Li Xia had no way to control him, he would definitely be very proud of himself and think he was very capable. Now that he was manipulated, he had to pay more for the rent to keep his place. He was angry but could do nothing. He thought he would find someone else this year and move out if he found someone suitable. This woman is not to be trifled with.\nLi Xia went home and told Shen Haiyang about this. The man nodded and thought she did a good job. If the tenants are not happy, just move out. Liu Biao needs to be taught a lesson. Don’t think that this house belongs to him after living there for two years. It’s so hard to collect rent.\n“Change your clothes; I’ll go move the washing machine.”\n“I’ll wash; you go lie down and rest for a while; you have to go to night school tonight.”\nLi Xia took out the clothes for both of them from the closet, put them on the bed, and prepared to wash and change her clothes. “At my age, I am capable. This is nothing. If I were in the countryside, I would be more tired from working in the fields all day.”\n",
    "64": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c40-2/\nThe next day was a working day, and the old man asked her to drive him to the notary office. On the way, he picked up a lawyer as a witness. The old man came to notarize the will, which he wrote with his own hand, signed with his name, and stamped with his private seal.\nDuring this period, many mainland Chinese people thought that making a will was unlucky. For those wealthy families, it directly led to unrest after death, and their children could fight and swear in court for property. The old man had lived abroad for many years, and his mind was relatively open. Li Xia withdrew from the notary office. She felt that she was not suitable to be present at such a thing. The old man made the following allocation, but she didn’t know.\nOn the public side, that is, the factory he invested in now, the two brothers each owned 40%, and the remaining 20% was given to Li Xia. The old man was grateful for her care for his wife and let her die peacefully.\nAnd now he is still being taken care of; his daughter-in-law is taking care of him in his old age, and it is estimated that they will also be the ones to see him off to the grave. All his personal belongings were left to them, and there are quite a few valuables in them.\nAfter everything was done, she drove the old man home. She parked at the door, and the old man turned around and smiled at her when she helped him get out of the car.\n“Daughter-in-law, you should drive more often in the future.”\n“Okay, I’m driving quite a lot now.”\nAre you complaining about my poor driving skills? Well, I just got my driver’s license, and my first reaction to a situation is to know how to brake, which is pretty good. I was very calm when I hit the car without mistaking the accelerator for the brake. And I didn’t brake hard today, which is much better than before.\nShe walked the old man to the backyard and sat him down. After chatting for a few minutes, she heard someone shouting in the alley: “Xia, someone is looking for you.”\nHearing Qin Mu’s voice, Li Xia came out from the backyard to the front. The people who came were Fang Zhongcheng’s second brother and his wife. What were they doing here? They didn’t rent her house at the beginning, so why did they come to her house again?\nThe Fang couple really came to talk about the house. Li Xia did not invite them into the house, so they talked in the yard. The woman was holding the child happily and began to pull Huihua to get close to Li Xia.\n“Your daughter is our niece, so we are relatives anyway.”\nIf she hadn’t mentioned this, Li Xia could have ignored it. But when she mentioned this, Li Xia immediately thought of that scumbag. She thought she would let him support her son in her next life, but it turned out that bastard was completely irresponsible. He was like a chicken that only gave birth to eggs but didn’t raise them.\n“No, there is no need to ask why. This is my house, and I have the final say.”\nThe second son of the Fang family glared at his wife fiercely. “How can you be so stupid?” She actually used Huihua to get close to her, which was counterproductive. He knew how much she hated his eldest brother. Speaking of the eldest brother, he would not let them live in the house.\n“No, our house is too far away, and it’s not convenient for us to go to work. Your wing is vacant, so why can’t you rent it to us? We’ll pay the rent. It’s a one-time payment for six months. We understand it.”\n“No, I won’t rent it.”\nSeeing that Li Xia was not willing to give in, the woman pulled Huihua to ask her to help her speak. The little girl pulled her arm out with all her strength, turned around, and ran away without saying anything. The couple looked at Yiyi again, and when Yiyi spoke, they were extremely disappointed.\nPointing at Shen Haiyang, he said, “My dad is over there. My name is Shen Ruyi. Don’t try to be my relative.”\nAt this point, the second son of the Fang family and his wife were completely speechless. When did this child even change his last name? How could Li Xia do this? What about his brother? Didn’t his brother care about it?\n“Huihua, what’s your last name?”\n“Of course my sister’s last name is also Shen.”\nYiyi was shaking his head as he spoke; his big eyes were clear and innocent, and he looked naive and cute. The innocent child spoke without disguising anything, making it impossible for the two people to doubt him.\nThey thought of a thousand ways on the way, but none of them worked. Before leaving, Fang Lao Er tried to make excuses for himself: “Blood ties cannot be severed. You are always my brother’s son.”\nHis wife turned and walked away, so he turned around and quickly chased after her. After catching up, he heard his wife start to complain that his frown was so tight that it could kill a mosquito.\n“At first, your mother said she had a wedding house. But in the end, you live in such a remote place. You liar, there is not a single good person in your family. And your eldest brother is a bastard who doesn’t even want his own child. I say, if you dare to do the same to me, I will.”\nThe child was in her arms; what could she do if he did the same? Throw the child out on the street. This was just a moment of rage. She couldn’t bear to let him go now.\n“Okay, okay, we have a place to live now, and we’re not asking you to sleep on the street.”\nHe was already in a bad mood, thinking that Li Xia was too heartless and too much, and his wife kept nagging him, which made him angry and even more resentful. The couple started arguing in the street.\nAs for Li Xia, after they left, Yiyi tilted his head and smiled at his mother. His proud expressions looked like he were asking her to praise him. Li Xia reached out and touched the brat’s head, rewarding him with candy.\nThe brat happily took the candy and went to play, and he decided to say the same thing to Fang Zhongcheng next time he met him. If he didn’t want him anymore, didn’t support him, and didn’t even transfer his household registration, then why did he still recognize him as his father? He has a mother who can earn money and a father who can transfer his household registration and accompany them to school. Fang Zhongcheng didn’t want him as a son, and he had long since stopped recognizing him as his father.\n————\nFive days later, Li Xia took back the west-side old house and soon found a tenant. The new tenant paid the rent without hesitation, paying one-tenth of the deposit and six-tenths of the rent. Liu Biao also paid the rent for a year.\nThe money was saved up, and the storehouse was bought for storage. The shop was being renovated. The mall was officially opened during the National Day holiday, and all the private shops were preparing intensively, fearing that they would miss the traffic during the National Day holiday.\nLi Xia was so busy that she had no time to take care of her family and children. Fortunately, she had found a nanny before this, and the nanny and they were still getting used to each other, so everyone was a little uncomfortable for a while. Shen Haiyang was taking care of the children. Sometimes she came back late and left early, and she didn’t see the children for several days.\nAt noon that day, Han Jun and she went to the train station to collect a batch of goods. It was past lunch time when we finished. The two of them found a canteen and ordered two bowls of vegetarian noodles.\nWhile waiting for the noodles, two people came out of the private room; one was Shen Yaozong, and the other was someone she didn’t know. Shen Yaozong nodded and greeted her, but didn’t say anything.\nAfter the two left, their noodles came. Li Xia took out some paper to wipe the chopsticks and handed them to Han Jun. The man smiled and said she was particular.\n“Your brother-in-law is quite arrogant. He wears a suit and has slicked-back hair. He looks quite Western.”\n“They are returned overseas Chinese, so it’s not normal for them to have Western influences.”\n“That’s right.” Han Jun looked away. “You arranged for my wife to work in the store. Aren’t you afraid that she will mess things up for you? She has never worked before. She is OK with housework, but can she do the work in the store? She doesn’t like dealing with strangers. Why did she agree to let you sell goods in the store this time?”\n“How do you know if you don’t try? You have to give her a chance and give her some practice. I plan to train her to be my store manager.”\nThe two chatted for a while and then stopped talking. They lowered their heads and ate their meal quickly. In the afternoon, they returned to the mall to start stocking the goods. They were busy until 10 o’clock at night before they got home.\nThe three children were still awake today. After watching TV in the backyard, they came out and saw her in the living room, so they lifted the door curtain and came in one by one.\n“Mom,” Huihua said, putting her arms around her mother’s waist. “I haven’t seen you for several days. What are you busy with?”\nYiyi also held his mother’s arm and acted coquettishly: “Mom, I miss you so much.”\nLi Xia smiled and said, “I come back every day, okay? There’s no need to put on such a show.”\n“Are you there? Why haven’t I seen you for several days?” The brat turned around and looked at his brother: “Brother, am I right? Have you not seen Mom for several days?”\nShen Hui smiled and handed the comb on the table to Li Xia, who had just washed her hair and was about to comb it. “Mom, you are busy with the opening of the business; isn’t it very hard? Tomorrow is the weekend, and we don’t have school, so let’s go and help you.”\nLi Xia reached out and gave the eldest a hug, gently, and then let go. In this life again, she was not stingy in expressing her feelings, and she loved her children so that they could feel it. Especially Shen Hui, who was the oldest and most of the time would not show too much enthusiasm. Then she would close the distance and treat the eldest the same way as she treated the other two.\n“Thank you, kids. It’s a deal now. You all go help mom tomorrow.”\n“Oh yeah, we can go to the mall to play.” Yiyi jumped and shouted.\nWell, the brat just wants to play all day. Li Xia rolled her eyes at him and began to tell the children about the precautions of going to the mall. Because everyone is in the stage of distributing goods at this time, don’t make any trouble if you are in a mess.\n“Just follow mom. We can only be in our own store. You are not allowed to touch other people’s things. Also, you must plan your time well. You can’t delay your own business.”\n“Oh, I see.”\nThe next day, Shen Haiyang brought his three children to help her. They opened three stores at the same time and finally finished the work after a few days of hard work. On National Day, the mall opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. For a while, people came and went, and the mall was crowded.\nThis is the first privately owned shopping mall in the provincial capital. Many people who are interested in doing business have come to inquire about the situation, including Murong Danling.\nShe and Zhang Qiuhua went together and saw Shen Haiyang and his son helping to sell hardware on the first floor. On the second floor, they saw Li Xia and her daughter busy with clothing. Next door was a hat accessory shop. Huihua had a butterfly-shaped hairpin on her head and her flying ponytail tied with a fashionable hairband, which was simply a living sign.\n“Three?” Zhang Qiuhua’s eyes widened in surprise, and she looked back at Murong Danling. “You said these three shops are not hers, right? How much money has she made in the past two years by renting three shops at once?”\nMurong Danling’s face was as gloomy as water. “Maybe she bought it.”\n“What did she buy? You mean the shops? No, no way. I heard that the shops cost hundreds of dollars per square meter. It’s not bad to buy one. How could she buy three at once? Oh, I forgot about Shen Haiyang.”\nAfter that, the two women kept silent, looking at the busy family across the crowd. Their hearts were like those squeezed out of a vinegar jar.\n“My husband divorced me because of this. He said I was taking a shortcut instead of taking the right path when I had a stable job. But look at Li Xia. Shen Haiyang supports everything she does. He has so much money, and he invested it all in her business.”\nZhang Qiuhua’s words made Murong Danling even more angry. She had to hide her sales, and she was exhausted every day. But Li Xia actually went from being a street vendor to a wholesale mall. She even bought three stores at once and has become a big boss now.\n“Let’s go and look somewhere else.”\nPulling Zhang Qiuhua away, she couldn’t help but think about Li Xia’s business. Clothing, accessories, shoes and hats, hardware—these are all very promising businesses. She didn’t import many rare and expensive goods but chose ordinary ones to win by price.\n“A rural woman who is capable and has accomplished everything. She is so lucky. Shen Haiyang, that idiot, must have taken some kind of drug from her and let her spend the money as she pleases.”\n“What are you mumbling about by yourself?”\n“nothing.”\nMurong Danling calmed down and thought that she had to find a suitable shop next. As for the business license, she would try to get Fang Zhongcheng to help her. This guy enjoyed the delicious food and drinks she brought, so he had to help her a little.\nThe two walked around several times but didn’t find any taxis. When they left, each of them bought a scarf. When they came out, there was a man selling roasted sweet potatoes. Zhang Qiuhua bought two and handed one to her.\n“How about you ask Brother Shen for help? He has three shops. What’s wrong with renting one to you? You are his son’s biological mother.”\n“You are still your big brother, Shen’s little fangirl. You grew up together. Why don’t you go?”\n“I, you are such a person; your words can choke people to death. I am also doing this for future development. We both lost our jobs. What will we do if development is not going well? I am living in my mother’s house now. If I didn’t go home every day with anything, would my mother and sister-in-law let me live like this?”\n“You’re just too stupid to find a man to marry. That way, you’ll have a place to live.”\n“Can you marry someone so casually?”\n“Look at your little bit of thinking; what can you accomplish? As long as there is a need, anything can be used.”\nZhang Qiuhua was being brainwashed by Murong Danling, and her words made her feel that everything was clear. Whatever house or shop you want, you can get it if you risk your life. The brave will die of overeating, while the timid will die of starvation. There is nothing you dare not do.\n————\nThe two of them didn’t find a shop for a while, so they continued to go from street to street in the cold weather. Li Xia’s business became more prosperous as the weather got colder.\nToday, more and more people are doing small business, and many unemployed young people or those without jobs have started to join this industry. She even received a staff member from a unit who was doing this, saying that it was more cost-effective to make money doing this than to go to work.\nXiao Liu was helping him find the goods, and Li Xia poured him a glass of water and sat down to chat. “Aren’t you afraid of losing your job?”\n“Oh, it’s okay. I’ll buy the goods wholesale and let my wife sell them at a stall. When we make money, she won’t object. I’ll let her come to you to buy the goods herself. Who knows, if she finds out that the profits are huge, she might ask me to resign.”\nThis man is very bold, talkative, and lively. After a conversation, Li Xia learned that he is the purchasing agent of the company, has traveled a lot, and has a wide range of experience.\n“I don’t know what the future holds for my job. With the expansion going on, I won’t be purchasing anymore. I guess there will be too many things to sell, so the factory will have to send people to do sales.”\nWow, you have good vision. Purchasing has only been around for a few years, but it completely declined in the 1990s and then completely withdrew from the historical stage. Sales took their place.\n“Do you think sales are harder than purchasing?” Li Xia wants to get in touch with such talents; who knows who might be able to use them in the future?\n“It should be more difficult. Purchasing means finding the products you need, and then people will sell them to you. If we go out without enough money, we can get a letter of introduction from our company as a token of trust. We can sign an IOU and take the goods away. But if things continue like this, sales will probably be like a grandson, begging people to buy from us.”\n“Leave me your contact information. I’ll make you a regular customer. I’ll give you a discount when you mention your name next time.”\n“That’s great. If anyone wants to set up a clothing stall, I’ll introduce them to you. But you must not overcharge them.”\n“Look at what you’re saying. What’s the point of doing business? I want to make it last. If I cut someone off, will they still come back to me in the future? How can I continue my business?”\n“That’s right. I also think you are an honest person; otherwise, I wouldn’t choose you here.”\nThe three stores have an astonishingly high turnover day by day. And now it is all cash flow. When she goes home at night, the money is packed. The bag she puts money in is ordinary, just like the one she uses to buy groceries. At night, she carries it in the car and goes home.\nQin Mu was arranged by her to sell goods in the mall, and now another aunt is cooking at home. For dinner, she made porridge, fried shredded potatoes, and cut a plate of pickled radish and cowpea.\nWhen Li Xia came in, the meal was already on the table. She pointed at the table and asked, “Didn’t I tell you to stew the chicken and make cold shredded chicken? I’ll make chicken noodle soup tomorrow morning. And there are staple foods like steamed buns or pancakes; why is there only porridge?”\nThe aunt glared at her. “What are you doing eating heavy food so late at night? It’s unnecessary. You want stewed chicken and cold-shredded chicken. But why eat meat every day? We just had braised fish yesterday.”\nLi Xia was immediately annoyed by her attitude. Whose house is this, and who has the final say? “I am the hostess of this house, and you just do whatever I tell you to do. There is no need to waste your time. Now, immediately, go knead the dough and get the meat from the refrigerator to make pies.”\nShe was annoyed, and so was the nanny. She took off her apron with an indignant look on her face. “Really? Do you know how to live? My meal is so good, but you want me to make it again without eating it? I’m telling you, no one can bully people like you. Even the landlords in the old society couldn’t bully people like this.”\n“When I first approached you, I specifically emphasized the cooking aspect, and since you’re a decent cook, I let you stay. I asked you to come here just to have a good meal, not to just send you away like this. If you had told me earlier that you didn’t like to cook well, I wouldn’t have wanted you.”\n“Why don’t I cook properly?” The woman pointed at the table: “Thin porridge, shredded potatoes, and kimchi. Isn’t this a good meal at this late hour?”\nShen Haiyang and the children came over when they heard the noise. Li Xia took a deep breath, took out the money from her pocket, and counted out five days’ wages.\n“You worked for three days, so here’s five days’ pay. Take it and go.”\n“You are such a disrespectful woman.” The woman turned back to Shen Haiyang and said, “Your wife is so disrespectful to the working people, and you don’t care about it?”\nShen Haiyang lifted the door curtain: “Please go out. We have already given you your salary. You don’t need to come again in the future.”\nThe couple looked the same. The woman was furious, picked up her coat, and walked away. “What kind of family is this? I don’t care.”\nLi Xia really wanted to go up and have a fight with her. What the hell are you? Do you understand the reason? We have old people and young children in our family. Both of them have heart disease. They have to eat well and take care of their health. Otherwise, why would I hire a nanny to cook for them?\nShen Haiyang came over and patted his wife to comfort her. “It’s a waste of time to get angry with her.” As he said this, he tied on an apron and went to scoop noodles and knead the dough. “Okay, let’s cook and eat. You’re tired after a busy day. Have a good rest after dinner.”\nThe three children also came over to help pick and wash the vegetables. “Mom, don’t be angry.”\nLi Xia was cutting green onions. “What’s wrong with this person? The food she cooks tastes okay. I put all the household supplies in the drawer for her. She just has to take them and cook them. Why do we have to do it according to her wishes?”\nShen Haiyang smiled and calmed her down: “You have too much self-consciousness and can’t tell the difference between inside and outside. Okay, don’t be angry; I’ll look for someone tomorrow.”\n“The last one who came here was okay at cooking, but the hygiene was terrible. She couldn’t clean the kitchen stove, and she swept the floor like a clown. That was fine, but she also forgot to change the water in the thermos for the old man, let alone remind him to take his medicine. I poured him some water for the medicine, but the water was barely warm.”\n“The world is full of wonders. It’s not easy to find someone who is suitable for our family.” Shen Haiyang spoke at the right time, allowing her to vent her dissatisfaction. Women can’t hold back their dissatisfaction. Holding their dissatisfaction will make them sick.\n“Yes, the more people you meet, the more you will encounter. If it’s in a shopping mall or a bun shop, as long as she can do that job, it’s fine. But at home, we have to take care of the hygiene and cooking. Sending this away today, she’s not here to be a nanny but to act like my mother-in-law, complaining about me for not knowing how to live.”\nShen Haiyang laughed, the children laughed too, the family members helped with the housework, and Li Xia vented her dissatisfaction and laughed easily. Then she heard her man whispering to her.\n“Don’t dare let your father-in-law hear this.”\n“Haha, I’m just making an analogy. With her behavior, even her own daughter-in-law probably doesn’t like her.”\n“What?”\nThe old man actually came over, and Li Xia quickly made amends: “I fired the aunt who cooked, and she was scolding me.”\n“Good decision.” The old man didn’t say much, and it seemed that he was also dissatisfied with the woman.\n“Dad, play chess with the kids and wait; the meal will be ready soon.”\n",
    "65": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c41/\nCHAPTER 41\nThe nanny was fired, and she had to look for another one. Shen Haiyang wrote an advertisement and posted it at the door of his bun shop. In the morning, a woman in her thirties came. After saying hello, Li Xia asked her to cook. Washing clothes and cleaning at home are not important tasks. The most important thing is to cook well and carefully.\n“okay.”\nThe woman tied an apron and started cooking. She chopped the killed chicken into pieces, washed it, and took it out, then heated up the oil in a pan and prepared to stir-fry it.\n“Don’t you blanch the chicken?”\n“Why blanch the water? There’s no need to go through so much trouble.”\nLi Xia stopped her hand from taking the basin: “It’s better to blanch it in water, otherwise it will smell fishy.”\n“Meat, isn’t it all about the fishy smell?” Although the woman said this, she still scooped a bucket of water into the pot.\n“A cooking pot cannot be used for blanching.”\n“Ah?” The woman was surprised. “Your family is too particular. Forget it. Forget it. I don’t want to do this anymore.”\nAs she was talking, she took off her apron and left. Li Xia was fired this time. She stood there, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and made her own lunch.\nIn the afternoon, she filled the thermos for the old man and reminded him to take medicine. Then she went to the mall. She went to the hardware store on the first floor to have a look. Han Jun was sitting there and told her about the sales volume during this period. He was the only one in the store. He came every day when the store opened and left only when it closed.\n“There are more retail sales than wholesale sales, and the quantities are not large.”\nSeeing that he was worried, Li Xia smiled and relieved his pressure. “Don’t be so anxious. We have just started, and the publicity is not in place. Many people don’t even know that this place exists. Besides, the hardware has been used on the construction site, and there is no loss, so what are you afraid of?”\n“Rent, goods, staff salaries—you have to pay them every day. Sister-in-law, let me tell you, you are a woman with more courage than many men.”\nLi Xia smiled and shook her head, thinking, I can sit on this seat so calmly because I know how the future will develop. If I am really so calm, so courageous, and so accurate in my vision, I must have been a female boss in my previous life. How could I open a steamed bun shop after just a few decades of hard work?\n“Oh, my wife…”\n“What’s wrong? Tell me, why are you speaking so unpleasantly?”\n“She doesn’t want to be in the mall. Do you think you can ask her to go back and take care of your old man?”\n“Qin Mu said that herself.”\n“Um.”\n“I’ll go up and take a look at the situation.”\nGo out, turn around, and go upstairs. Qin Mu is now in the jewelry and hat store. Li Xia came over to see that she had just sent off a customer, then took a deep breath and looked frustrated. Seeing her come in, she pulled her to sit on the chair.\n“Can you let me go back and cook for you?”\n“What’s wrong? Are you not satisfied with the work?”\n“I’m not cut out for selling. Not only am I no match for Xiao Liu, but I’m tired of dealing with people. I really want to go home and cook and clean without having to talk to people.”\n“Is it so difficult for you to communicate with others?”\nQin Mu nodded quickly. “I have been like this since I was a child. It’s not that I can’t talk to people. It’s just uncomfortable to deal with strangers every day. Let me go home and cook.”\nHer eyes were red as she spoke. Just as Li Xia was about to ask, Xiao Liu at the side spoke up. “There were too many people, and the money was miscalculated. She lost her entire month’s salary.”\nWhat? Are you losing money to come to work? Li Xia quickly said, “Well, don’t be too burdened. The loss will be mine. I’ll give you some time to get used to it.”\n“I’m not cut out to sell goods. Sister-in-law, if you really want to give me a job, let me go back to cook and take care of the old man. Otherwise, I’ll go home. I won’t force you to do anything if you can’t make money.”\n“Okay, come back to my house and take care of our old man.”\nEven if she finds a suitable nanny, she still needs to get used to it. Of course, it is better for her to go back. She was worried that Han Jun would not say it, but he would mind his wife working as a nanny at his friend’s house, so she gave Qin Mu a chance. If it works out, the couple will follow her to do business in the future.\nNow that they themselves are asking for this, what else can she say? Selling goods for a few days costs her a month’s salary. If she can’t adapt, she can’t do this job.\nQin Mu then went back to cook and take care of the old man. Han Jun often came to eat at home, and her children would come sometimes. Of course, Han Jun never came empty-handed. The two families got along like one family, and no one looked down on people who did housework.\nAfter work that day, Li Xia called Han Jun. “Let’s go to our house for dinner.”\n“Haha, if it weren’t for the relationship between our two families, you would have kicked my wife out, right?”\n“Not really.” Li Xia teased him deliberately: “It’s mainly because of Qin Mu’s face. She is so meticulous and thoughtful in her work. If I fire her, I’m afraid I won’t be able to find such a good person to help me.”\n“Ah, how did Lao Shen and I end up being reduced to being just female foils?”\n“Ha ha……”\nLi Xia smiled and got into the car, and the two went home together. When she went in to wash up, Li Xia told Qin Mu what he said as a joke, and Qin Mu gave him a blank look.\n“Gender equality; you just don’t have enough awareness. Look at Brother Shen; he cooperates with his wife more every day.”\n“I’ll cooperate with you. You work here, and I’ll cook and eat here.”\n“How dare you say that? I have to cook for you while I’m at work, and that’s because you and Brother Shen have a close relationship. Would it work if I changed jobs?”\n“No, Li Xia said that it’s all because of your good work; otherwise, she wouldn’t let me have a meal.”\n“Ha ha,”\nEveryone laughed out loud, stamping their feet on the ground. Shen Hui and Huihua, who were older, covered their mouths and laughed secretly. Aunt Qin was gentle and patient, and now she gets along very well with their mother. Uncle Han really benefited from his wife; otherwise, it would be useless for him to have a good relationship with his father because his father always listened to his mother.\n“What are you talking about so happily?”\nThe old man came in from outside with a cane, and Yiyibrought a chair to Grandpa with special eyes. The little guy said clearly that everyone was laughing at Han Jun, Huihua went into the room to pour a cup of tea for Grandpa, and Shen Hui squatted on the ground to massage his legs.\nThe old man sat on the chair and listened to their gossip leisurely, looking at his grandson with loving eyes. He had children and grandchildren all around him, but he never thought that he would have such a day. He was born in a turbulent time and had a narrow escape from death. After divorcing Shen Yaozong’s mother, he thought he would die alone.\nUnexpectedly, the mainland opened up, and he returned to the land where he was born and raised. After a tour, he found that he still liked this kind of life the most. Children and grandchildren were around, and the family lived together in harmony.\n“Xia, is the construction site about to stop working? Will we have to wait until next year to continue?”\nAfter dinner, the old man asked Li Xia to stay and talk. The two sat on their own sides, and the sound of a piano came from the side room. It seemed that Shen Hui was playing.\n“Yes, it’s too cold to do any construction. My dad and his family are leaving soon, so we’ll have the day off after we finish pouring the foundation in the next few days.”\n“When is the expected date for completion next year?”\n“In March, we’ll start building walls and stuff. If we speed things up, it should be ready in May. If you’re pressed for time, I’ll have them rush the work and try to get it done in the shortest possible time.”\n“May, no later than June.”\n“Okay.”\nIt is estimated that the production line and products in the United States will be delivered in May or June, so the factory here must be prepared. She is responsible for the factory, and she will definitely try her best to meet the employer’s needs. Discuss with the construction company, and when the weather warms up next year and large-scale work can be carried out, at most one more construction team can be added to try to advance the construction schedule.\nThe weather was cold, and Han Jun was eager to try Li Xia’s car. Most men like cars, and he was still riding a two-wheeled bicycle, while Li Xia was already riding a four-wheeled one.\n“Such a nice car; how about letting me try it?”\nLi Xia threw the key to him and said, “Drive carefully. Let me see how good your skills are.”\n“That’s definitely first-rate.” Han Jun took the keys and got in the car. “I learned to drive in the army, so my driving skills are definitely good.”\nShe drove home and met Shen Yaozong at the street entrance. She went back to the house to wash up and soon heard a quarrel in the backyard. But the voices were not loud, and she couldn’t hear what they were arguing about. It has been very quiet these days, so what happened?\n“What are they arguing about? The old man is old and in poor health. He can do what he wants and leave when he doesn’t want to. What is this all about?”\nShen Haiyang took a basin to fetch water. He had just returned home from work. “He must be conflicted too.”\n“You mean Shen Yaozong?”\n“Mom, grandpa, and uncle are here.”\nHuihua called out from outside the door, Li Xia hurried out, and Shen Haiyang also hurried to wash his face and go out. His father-in-law and brother-in-law had been at the construction site since they came, so he had to treat them well before they left.\n“Dad, have you guys packed up your bedding? Is the construction site closed for the holiday?”\nAfter opening the door to the main room, everyone placed their bedding in the main room and sat on the sofa. The old man took out his pipe and filled it with a pot, and Li Xia opened the window for ventilation. Following her words, her cousin started talking.\n“It’s vacation time. We’ll come back next year. Xia, I’m so grateful to you. You’re really capable now.”\n“Just work hard; money is not a problem.” Li Xia smiled. The old man let her manage the funds for the construction site. “What about the others? When do you plan to come back?”\n“The others are at the construction site. We bought our tickets for this afternoon. We will gather at the train station then.”\n“So urgent? It would be nice if you could stay for a night. Also, have you received all your wages, or only 80 percent?”\nThe old man tapped his pipe and said, “We have settled our accounts. The foreman knows our relationship. We just came to see you and find out what’s going on.”\nAfter the money was settled, Li Xia felt relieved. The most difficult thing about working on a construction site in the 1990s was getting paid. Small contractors basically brought in people from all over the country, and everyone knew each other. If they didn’t get paid for all the hard work, they would have no way to explain themselves to these people.\nShen Haiyang happened to hear his father-in-law’s plan and quickly took out money for the children to buy cooked food. Pork liver, pig head, pig heart, and roast chicken—except for lunch; the rest were all cut up and put in lunch boxes for them to take with them. It was a good meal on the train, with steamed buns and boiled water.\nIn the main room, the third brother took out a handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to Li Xia. “You took on this project, and the money was settled so quickly because of you. This is your share.”\nLi Xia raised her hand and pushed him back. “My dear brother, it’s my duty to help you. Why are you being so polite to me? I’m so busy that I can’t even go home. Our parents are mostly taken care of by my sister-in-law. You buy her something, and she’ll be happy too.”\nAs she spoke, she took out a bundle from the cupboard and said, “Although I have prepared it, it is different for you as a husband to buy it. If my sister-in-law is happy, it will be easier to take care of my mother.”\nWomen, what they love is nothing more than clothes or skin care products. This time, Li Xia prepared skin care products for the sisters-in-law. The men in the family smiled happily when they saw these good things, saying what else they wanted.\n“Don’t worry, Dad and Mom. We will take care of you in your old age. We sons are here to help you.”\nAs they were talking, the old man heard that his in-laws were coming and came out to meet them. The two old men were very different in every aspect, but the atmosphere was unexpectedly harmonious when they were together. The old man was not arrogant at all. The old man was simple and unpretentious, kind and amiable.\nTalking about their lives over the years and the crops in the countryside, the two old men actually had a lot in common. With something to talk about, Li Xia’s father’s nervousness in front of the big boss gradually dissipated, and he felt close to his in-laws.\nLi Xia boiled water to make tea for them and leaned in close to whisper to Shen Haiyang, “Your father is really amazing. He can chat with anyone. No matter if they are big international businessmen or ordinary people like my father, he is always so amiable. He is very popular. You are similar to him in this respect, more like him than Shen Yaozong.”\n“Yeah?”\nLi Xia nodded. Blood ties are really amazing. Even if they have not been around since childhood, people can recognize blood relatives at a glance based on their natural facial features, appearance, and temperament.\nThe old man treated his in-laws to a meal and gave them two bottles of good wine, two cans of imported milk powder, and some imported candies and chocolates before they left. Li Xia’s father was very embarrassed and kept saying that he would send vegetables from his hometown to his in-laws next year.\n“The food grown in our own fields tastes great. I’ll grow whatever vegetables you like at home. We can raise chickens and ducks as we please now, so we don’t need them at home. We drink spring water and eat real food, and the food tastes great. I’ll come and get you duck eggs, chickens, ducks, and geese next year.”\n“Ducks are good. I like ducks very much.”\nAged wine and milk powder are good products, as are their own vegetables, chickens, and ducks. Both sides are thoughtful and respectful toward each other. The old man is not the kind of person who lacks vegetables, but he still discusses what to eat with his in-laws very seriously, giving people the feeling of being valued and respected. Before getting on the train, the old man also told his daughter to be filial to her father-in-law.\n“What a kind person he is. He doesn’t have a partner now. As his daughter-in-law, you should pay more attention to him and take good care of him.”\n“Okay, I know.”\nThe old man patted Shen Haiyang on the back and said, “Nothing can compare to blood relatives. Besides, your father is such a good man. Be more filial to him.”\nShen Haiyang also nodded. “I understand. Dad, don’t be too tired when you go home.”\nThe old man laughed: “I have a very strong body. You can’t compare with me in this respect.”\nAfter seeing off her family, Li Xia chatted with Shen Haiyang in the car as she returned. “The weather is getting cold, and Christmas is coming soon. Do you think Shen Yaozong is planning to go back to the United States to celebrate the holiday?”\n“It’s possible. I heard that we have to go to the site to see the ordered equipment and products. The assembly sounds complicated.”\nIt was getting cold, and within a few days, the temperature suddenly dropped to minus ten degrees. During dinner, Shen Yaozong told the old man that he wanted to go back to the United States to see his son and then go to the production line and products on site to check matters out. The old man immediately nodded in agreement.\n“If Annie and Kevin are willing, bring them back to celebrate the Spring Festival.”\n“Let’s talk later.”\nIn November, Shen Yaozong left here and returned to the United States. He left with his suitcase, and when he reached the corner of the street, he looked back at the entrance of Li Xia’s house for about a minute, then turned around and strode away.\nQin Mu, who saw this, was carrying a basket of charcoal and muttering to himself, “He is just going back to celebrate the festival, but it seems like he won’t be back in the future.”\nA heavy snowfall brought even lower temperatures, and the rivers began to freeze. All the leaves fell, leaving nothing but bare trees.\nIt’s cold outside, but the mall where Li Xia works is getting hotter day by day. The New Year is coming, and everyone is starting to prepare for the New Year. She mainly does wholesale here, and those who want to start a small business will go straight here when they come to the provincial capital.\nShe mainly sells chemical fibers here, which can be bought without coupons. She can also import a lot of cotton goods from the south without coupons, including second-hand clothes, all washed and ironed, and some reprocessed to look like new. The manufacturers she chooses are all regular and will disinfect. In her new life, she still knows what to pay attention to in this regard.\nThe goods ordered before have basically all arrived, and she has all the goods in stock. The prices are right, the styles are generous, and with the old customers accumulated before, the business is booming before the New Year, and there are customers every day.\nAt 5:30 in the evening, they started taking inventory, and at 5:50, everyone started to go out. Now that she has her own car, she doesn’t have to get cold in the winter. With nothing else to do today, she thought about making something delicious for her family.\nWhat to cook but ?? She doesn’t know what the old man likes. After parking the car and entering the house, Qin Mu was chopping meat in the kitchen, chopping rhythmically. When she saw her come in, she turned around, smiled, and said to her.\n“The old man wanted to eat meat patties and donkey meat hot pot. I have prepared the noodles, and the donkey meat should be cooked. You can try it and see how it tastes.”\n\n  (meat patties)\n\n(donkey meat hot pot)\n \nLi Xia lifted the lid of the pot, and the aroma of sauce filled her nose. The two dishes made today are both special delicacies that were not available in previous years. Now that all industries have begun to recover, more livestock have been raised, and meat is not so difficult to buy.\n“It smells good. Your cooking skills are quite good. You can open a restaurant.”\nQin Mu smiled and continued to chop the meat. “My grandfather used to sell donkey meat, so my family is still good at it. But my father’s generation has stopped doing this business. My grandfather said it’s too tiring.”\nLi Xia washed her hands and helped, taking out the noodles from the basin to make fire-baked skin. “What can we do that is not tiring? There is no job in this world that is not tiring as long as it is related to making money.”\n“I thought so too. But I couldn’t do it myself in the past few years, and there was no way for me to find a job in my situation.”\n“Do you want to open one? If you do, I can help you find a store.”\nQin Mu shook his head and said, “No, I’m fine with you. At my age, I feel good about a stable job. The salary the old man gives is three times higher than that of an ordinary nanny. I’m satisfied in every aspect, so I won’t bother anymore.”\nAfter a while of hard work, Qin Mu’s meat pie came out of the pan, and Li Xia’s crispy and tender fire-baked bread was also ready. As soon as Shen Haiyang and the three children entered the house, they smelled the rich aroma that made people swallow their saliva and began to praise it.\n“Donkey meat hotpot; my sister-in-law’s cooking skills are really good.”\nYiyianxiously reached out to eat, but Li Xia slapped the back of his hand. “Wash your hands, or you won’t get any.”\n",
    "66": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c41-2/\nThe three had just come back from piano lessons, and they quickly washed their hands. Li Xia started boiling water to cook wontons, and dinner was wontons, donkey meat hot pot, and meat pie.\nThis dinner is definitely hard, and the neighbors will think it is a waste when they smell it. But Li Xiaâs family canât get together at noon and can only get together in the evening. So the old man always asks for a richer dinner.\nThe family was happily eating in the backyard, and Qin Mu was also in the backyard today. Usually, when Han Jun was there, she would eat with him in the front yard, but today Han Jun was on a business trip, so she ate with everyone.\nThe atmosphere at the dinner table was very good. The old man took a bite of the donkey meat and praised Qin Muâs cooking skills. Qin Mu said that more donkey meat was sold this winter, and the old man liked it so much that he would make it again next time.\nâI can also make donkey offal soup. Iâll make it for you to try some other day.â\nâOkay, remember to add more coriander.â\nYiyilooked up and said, âI donât eat cilantro.â\nShen Hui also said, âI donât eat it either.â\nThe old man touched his two grandsonsâ heads lovingly and said, âOkay, I wonât put it in for you two. Put the one in Grandpaâs bowl separately.â\nâThank you, Grandpa.â\nAfter dinner, the children practiced the piano, and Shen Haiyang played chess with the old man. The relationship between the father and son is not very good, but it is very harmonious. In winter, they often sit like this after dinner.\nLi Xia was busy shipping the goods, trying to sell all the clothes she ordered before the New Year. The clothing business is most afraid of overstocking; once overstocking occurs, it is likely to be a loss. So when the twelfth lunar month was approaching, she lowered the price a little bit, and in less than ten days, there was not much left.\nâItâs safe.â\nXiao Liu gave her a thumbs up and said, âBoss, you are really courageous. You put all the money into the purchase and reduced the price when it came to shipping. Now we are stable, and I am spending this year with peace of mind.â\nâWe are in the wholesale business. If we donât reduce the price now, it will be too late. Look at the next door.â\nThe store next door is high-end, and its business is not as good as theirs. Moreover, the boss is very strict about the price, and the goods are still piled up in the warehouse when the twelfth lunar month is almost halfway through.\nâShe said at worst she could sell it next year.â\nâNext year? Will her products still be popular next year?â\nRegardless of others, Li Xia went home at night and took all the cash back home. After entering the main room, she closed the door, opened the cabinet, and took out all the cash she brought home every day.\nWow, in this era when there were no hundred-yuan notes, her cash flow during this period had piled up into a small mountain. She tied the thick stacks of ten-yuan notes together with rubber bands. Each stack was five thousand, which was very convenient to count.\nâwifeâ\nShen Haiyang called softly from outside, and Li Xia quickly got down to open the door. The curtains were drawn, so she wasnât afraid of being seen by outsiders. Shen Haiyang came in and saw so much cash, and I reminded her that it would be better to put it in the bank.\nâDeposit it in a current account and withdraw it whenever you need it.â\nâOkay.â\nâIâll go with you. Youâ¦â The man used his hand to pick up the pile of money. âWife, is this how much you make in business?â\nâOf course. The year before last, there were so many people with an annual income of 10,000 yuan in the provincial capital. In the past two years, as long as the investment is appropriate, it will definitely increase several times or even dozens of times.â\nâThatâs terrible. Who would be willing to work if things continued like this? I canât make as much as you did in the past six months of my lifetime.â\nâThe country will adjust. As the economy changes, prices and wages will slowly adjust. Especially for welfare benefits, your company can be said to be guaranteed by the government for life. For businessmen, you may have made money in the past few years, but if you fail, you may lose everything.â\nâThatâs true. We have a pension and medical care after retirement. I feel at ease knowing that someone will take care of me throughout my life.â\nâYou are a cadre, and you will have good benefits after retirement. So you should work hard, and you are the backbone of our family.â\nShen Haiyang smiled and nodded. He had no intention of quitting his job to start a business. Not to mention that his health did not allow it; even if he was healthy, he would not be interested in doing business.\nThe couple took a bag, put the cash in it, and drove to the bank the next day to deposit a large sum of money. They kept some cash at home, and they would have to go south to buy goods in the spring, and they would have to withdraw some more when the time came.\nWhen they got home, Huihua was cutting paper. The bright red paper looked festive. The girl was already itching to cut paper-cuts with scissors while drawing. The little girl had studied art for such a long time and had her own unique understanding of beauty. Now she cuts a lot more patterns. After cutting one, she showed it to Li Xia.\nâMom, do you think they look alike?â\nâYes, it is! It looks like the photo. How can it be cut so similarly?â\nâMom, do you like it? If you like it, Iâll cut one for you too.â\nâOK.â\nThe little girl glanced at Shen Haiyang and said, âCut the two of you together, like a group photo.â\nShen Haiyang never hesitates to give compliments: âMy daughter is very clever and skilled.â\nMom and Dad both praised her. She was so happy that her mouth stretched to her ears when she was drawing with scissors. Her grades in the final exam were not good, but she could draw, cut paper, and play the piano, so Mom and Dad both praised her.\nâHuihuaâ¦â¦â\nJust as her heart was soaring, Fang Zhongchengâs voice came from outside the house. The little girlâs face fell immediately, and she stood up and stood beside her mother. What was he doing here? He was usually nowhere to be seen, so why did he suddenly appear when the New Year was almost approaching?\nWhen they went out of the house, the person who came was Fang Zhongcheng. Hearing their shouts, the three little ones also came out of the house. At this time, they all came to their parents, and they looked like the big bad wolf.\nâWhat are you doing here?â Shen Haiyang asked.\nThe five members of their family were becoming more and more close to each other, but Fang Zhongcheng still had a smile on his face. He reached out to pull Yi Yi, but the little guy dodged him.\nâDad bought you new clothes and toys. Come and see if you like them.â\nFang Zhongcheng took out a toy from the bag he was carrying, but his son was not moved at all and reached out to grab the corner of Shen Haiyangâs clothes tightly.\nâI have all of these.â\nFang Zhongcheng choked: âBut this is what dad bought for you.â\nâI have a father.â\nWell, is this a change of surname to completely deny his biological father? This is Fang Zhongchengâs child, a blood relative. If Li Xia hadnât instigated behind the scenes, the child wouldnât have been like this with him. This guy doesnât reflect on himself but only blames others.\nâLi Xia, you are ruining your child by teaching him this way. Morality is the foundation of a personâs life. I am his biological father. Is this how you teach your child? You donât recognize your own blood relatives.â\nâYes, thatâs what I taught you.â\nIf it were the previous Li Xia, she would definitely try her best to argue with him. But now Li Xia was too lazy to bother with him. She said, âIâll make you angry to death. Iâll say whatever I want to make you angry.â\nItâs obviously you who are irresponsible and broke the childâs heart, so the child is like this. But you still want to blame me and talk about ethics and morality. Bullshit, do you have ethics and morality?\nâYouâ¦â Fang Zhongcheng pointed at her, but Li Xia waved her hand away. âDonât point your finger at me; it makes me angry. If you do that to me again, Iâll chop it up with a knife.â\nâLi Xia,â\nSure enough, Fang Zhongcheng was so angry that he was furious. He could never have imagined that in just a few years, this woman had become a completely different person. She used to be so gentle and considerate, but now she would start to scold him as soon as she opened her mouth, and she would not stop until she was pissed to death.\nâShen Haiyang, you are a public official, but you live with a woman like this? Can she educate the child well? The child will be corrupted by her.â\nShen Haiyang met his gaze and smiled slightly, then spoke gently. His words were not as explosive as Li Xiaâs, but the effect was the same, which made Fang Zhongcheng fall backwards in anger.\nâI like it this way. I think my wife is pretty good. As for educating children, I think our children are very good. I donât know what you mean by bad.â\nâShen Haiyang, you have such bad vision; you are totally blind.â\nShen Haiyang remained calm and said, âI should be the one saying this to you. Youâre stealing my lines.â\nâHa ha,â\nLi Xia couldnât help it, and the mother and her children laughed. Yiyi was the youngest, and she laughed the loudest. His vision was really not very good. Murong Danling was so cruel to his brother. She was not a good mother.\nFang Zhongcheng was mentally prepared this time, so he took advantage of the open gate to go into the house. With no outsiders around, he continued to coax his son.\nâYiyi, you are still young, so be good and obedient. I am your real father. Come on, spend the New Year with Dad. Dad will accompany you to set off firecrackers and take you to watch fireworks. Dad will buy you whatever you want.â\nShen Ruyi stepped back and said, âNo, I donât want it.â\nAfter refusing, the little guy turned and ran, slipping into the inner bedroom. With that look, I wonât listen to anything you say. Fang Zhongcheng turned to look at his daughter helplessly. Huihua met his gaze, turned, and ran away without waiting for him to speak. She wouldnât refuse anyone, so sheâd better not listen to what he said.\nLi Xia rolled her eyes at him and said, âAlright, hurry up and leave. Donât embarrass yourself here.â\nFang Zhongcheng tried to coax them away for a long time but failed. He turned around and saw Shen Hui, who also ran away quickly. This man is now his stepfather, so just in case, he should have less contact with him and not coax him away. He was not willing to follow them.\nHe returned empty-handed, thinking that his brother and his children were all happy together during the Chinese New Year, but his wife was infertile. The two of them had three children, but none of them would stay with them.\nFurious, he came out and yelled at Murong Danling, who was waiting not far away. âHow nice it would be if you came in with me; we could coax them together; who knows who would be willing to follow? Donât you worry about people laughing at us being alone without a child during the New Year?â\nâFang Zhongcheng, you bastard. What a joke! Iâm not afraid of being laughed at. How can you not be laughed at when you eat well, dress well, and enjoy the money I earn? You gave your sister a semiconductor before, but itâs all mine. Now youâre afraid of being laughed at when you think of your child during the Chinese New Year. You can die without a child, right?â\nâYou woman,â Murong Danling said even more ruthlessly, no less than Li Xia now, and it made him so angry that his liver hurt. âYou are right that you canât give birth, right? If you had given birth to our child, would I have to try to get close to that brat?â\nâWhy did I lose my child? I earn money for this family; otherwise, how could you live so well?â\nâGet out of my house if you have the guts. You lived in my house, and I bought you clothes before; why didnât you tell me then? Now you make some dirty money.â\nâDonât regret it.â\nBefore he finished speaking, Murong Danling said something harsh and turned away. The couple parted unhappily. Fang Zhongcheng held his forehead helplessly. He couldnât remember how many times they had quarreled since remarrying. He was so angry that he pushed the cart slowly and turned to his mother-in-lawâs house when he was almost home. He had been divorced once and couldnât divorce again. Donât wait for the big sister from the unit to mediate. He should go and pick her up himself.\nThe two of them were arguing not far from Shenâs house, and Yi Yi, who ran out, saw the scene. The little boy was very cunning, and after running out to watch, he went home to tellÂ  his brother and sister, and finally shook his head and came to a conclusion.\nâDonât go with them. They fight so fiercely among themselves, and they will be even more merciless when beating children.â\nHe didnât need to tell them that neither of them wanted to go with him. Yiyi was also afraid of such a stepmother and held his brotherâs hand distressedly. âDonât be afraid; Mom and Dad wonât give us to them.â\nShen Hui nodded. âYes, we both have the surname Shen.â\nâYes, we are the children of the Shen family.â\nâWhat are you doing in the house?â The three kids were talking in whispers when Li Xia came in. She was wearing a cotton coat and a scarf, and she looked like she was going out. âAll three of you should wear cotton coats and go out with me. Iâll buy you those new hiking shoes today.â\nâWhat are hiking shoes?â The little ones asked curiously, one by one, as they prepared to get dressed.\nâThey are just new shoes. Donât ask; you will know when you get there. If I wasnât afraid that they wouldnât fit, I would buy them for you.â\nâoh.â\nâPut on your cotton clothes and tie your scarves.â\nShe told the children to get dressed and let them choose any childrenâs clothes and shoes in the mall. The lively atmosphere in the mall immediately dispelled the previous unhappiness, and the three children were all immersed in the joy of shopping.\nHiking shoes, snow jackets, and popular clothes for the children. Shen Haiyang picked out a particularly eye-catching red down jacket for his wife, which fit Li Xia well and looked fashionable. Her own clothing business mainly follows the low-end route, shipping in large quantities. This kind of clothing is much more expensive than hers and can only be found in foreign trade malls.\nâDoes it look good?â She zipped up her clothes and turned around, and the four people nodded in unison.\nâMom is so beautiful.â Yiyiis never stingy with compliments.\nâIt looks good.â Shen Hui and Huihua were more reserved.\nLi Xia turned her eyes to Shen Haiyang, and the man gave her a thumbs up. The salesperson also said that she looked good in the dress, and she promptly issued the bill and paid.\nShen Haiyang carried the bag and left the counter. She leaned close to him and asked in a low voice, âIs it really not too eye-catching?â\nâItâs great to have a high rate of returning attention. Why should you be afraid of being seen?â\nâAll right.â\nItâs the end of the year, and the days go by so fast that it seems like New Yearâs Eve is here in the blink of an eye. The bun shops and shopping malls are open until the morning of the 30th, and everyone has a day off in the afternoon. People who have been busy all year can finally take a break.\nLi Xia prepared a cotton-padded jacket for everyone as a year-end benefit. After putting on the new cotton-padded jacket, everyone said happy words. Han Jun said that he could finally go home and have a good sleep, but was immediately besieged by a group of women.\nâMen are such a jerk. As soon as they have a holiday, they just want to sleep and rest. Now that the New Year is almost here, donât you want to go home and help your wife?â\nâThatâs right. I told my mom that today was a holiday, and she asked me to go home right after getting off work to help chop the stuffing and fry the meatballs. I asked her why she didnât let my brother help, as my brother had been on holiday from university for a long time. She said that my brother was a man, and men didnât have to cook or do housework. Why? Women go to work, do housework, and have to give birth to and take care of children after marriage, but men only have to work.â\nâItâs a rule passed down by our ancestors. What can we do about it? If I dare not do it, my mother-in-law will stab me to death.â\nHan Jun wanted to explain, but since the topic had gone off track, he didnât need to say anything. The women started to complain about the injustice, not against him. It was just that this period was at a turning point; women had already risen up to be independent, but men couldnât keep up and still wanted to be masters and wait on women. So he, who knew what women were thinking, went home, tied an apron, and worked with his wife.\nLi Xia drove Han Jun home and asked him to leave with Qin Mu after dinner. The custom here is to have a reunion dinner at noon on New Yearâs Eve, but Li Xia and her friends were too busy to care about the custom. They were still busy in the morning on New Yearâs Eve, so the reunion dinner was arranged in the evening.\nQin Mu arranged it well, saying that they would just have a simple lunch. The couple finished their meal with meat and vegetables in the front yard. Qin Mu stood up to clean up the pots and bowls, and Han Jun helped her. Li Xia came in and took away the pot brush from Qin Muâs hand, smiling and telling her to go home quickly.\nâItâs New Yearâs Day, and the children are waiting for you at home. Come back as soon as possible.â\nâIâll clean up the dishes before I leave.â\nLi Xia pushed her and said, âYou guys go. Iâll do it.â\nAfter seeing them off, Li Xia tied on an apron and cleaned up the pots and bowls. After the two children finished eating in the backyard, they brought all the dishes and chopsticks over to her, and she worked briskly in front of the stove.\nâWhat should I do? What else should we cook for dinner besides dumplings?â\nShen Haiyang came from the backyard with the tea set, and while talking to Li Xia, he took the water to wash the tea set. The old man likes to drink tea, but it is not suitable for heart disease. She didnât know where he got the tea from, but he said that it was okay to drink less. The father and son will drink together when they have time. Shen Haiyang is responsible for the daily cleaning of the tea set.\nâBraised fish, braised pork, chestnut roast chicken, beer duck, hot and sour radish, pork with vinegar, tofu with scallions, vermicelli with bean curd, and winter melon meatball soupâwhat do you think?â\n\n(Braised fish)\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  (braised pork)\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â  (chestnut roast chicken)\n\n( beer duck)\n \nÂ Â Â Â  (hot and sour radish)\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (pork with vinegar)\n\nÂ  (tofu with scallions)\n \nÂ Â  (vermicelli with bean curd)\n\nÂ (winter melon meatball soup)\nShen Haiyang smiled and nodded. âIâll help you.â\nHe turned to the front yard to cook with Li Xia. After finishing the painting practice, Huihua took the initiative to come over to help. The little girl was very considerate. As long as she saw her mother busy, she would never stand idly by.\nâHelp mom peel the onions and garlic. Mom will teach you how to roll out the dumpling wrappers. Weâll wrap the dumplings and freeze them outside.â\nâOkay.â\nIn the future, men and women will be more equal, so she doesnât insist that her daughter can cook. The child is willing to help, and she canât refuse her kindness. Moreover, if she can cook, she can cook for herself. When she grows up and lives on her own, itâs not good to eat in the cafeteria every day.\nâShen Hui, Yi Yi, come and make dumplings.â\nâcoming.â\nThe two boys were called over, and the family of five worked in the kitchen. Fortunately, her kitchen was big enough. If it was a small house, there would not be enough space for so many people.\nThe dumplings were made in a variety of ways, but Li Xiaâs requirement was simple: just pinch them tightly so that the fillings donât show. She kept smiling, and the children were having a lot of fun.\nAfter making the dumplings, she started to cook. Shen Haiyang helped her. The children saw that they had nothing to do, so they all wanted to go out to play. There were gunshots outside from time to time, and the little onesâ minds had already flown outside.\nâGo and have fun. Our firecrackers are placed in the east corner of the backyard. Go get them yourselves. Be careful. Throw them where thereâs no one. Donât let anyone get hurt.â\nâOkayâ¦â\nThe two soms walked out hand in hand, and one by one they made conditions for their brother: âBrother, when we play later, you must play with me, and you canât let others win all the games.â\nâLetâs just have fun on our own and not play the game of winning or losing with them.â\nâAh, I want to win a few more.â\nâYou are a gambler. You like gambling so much.â\nâThe winner is free; donât you like free?â\nWhen the two sonsâ voices faded away, Li Xia smiled, pointed at the door, and said to her daughter, âGo and play. Thereâs not much work left. Your dad and I can take care of it.â\nâOkay.â\nGrilled fish, grilled meatâ¦ busy preparing a sumptuous New Yearâs Eve dinner. When the dishes were brought to the backyard, three firecrackers were set off one by one in the yard. The neighbors nearby also set off firecrackers while eating, and the sound of firecrackers continued for a while. Amid the deafening sound, the old man couldnât help but tear up when he sat at the table.\nAfter so many years, he finally returned to the land where he was born and raised. Now his family is around him, and his children and grandchildren are around him. Although his youngest son is not around, life is not bad. He should be content.\nâShall we have a drink today?â\nThe old man turned around and asked Shen Haiyang, who turned back to look at Li Xia. Ever since he was diagnosed with heart disease, Li Xia had not allowed him to drink, and now he had to get his wifeâs permission if he wanted to drink.\nâHow about a glass of wine?â\nBoth of them have heart problems. No matter how happy we are, we dare not give them white wine. The alcohol content of white wine is too high, and their hearts cannot bear it. It would be bad if the joy of the New Year turned into sorrow.\nâOkay, listen to my daughter-in-law; letâs have a glass of wine.â\nLi Xia went to the cupboard to get some wine and poured more for herself and less for the two of them. She could drink quite well, but she never drank unless necessary. Today was the New Year, and she was happy, so she drank with them.\nâHappy New Year.â\nâHappy New Year.â\nThe adults drank wine, the children drank Coca-Cola, and everyone toasted to celebrate the first New Year after the old man returned to China. With the sound of the Spring Festival Gala, the New Yearâs Eve dinner was full of joy.\nStaying up all night, eating dumplings, and letting the old man feel the long-lost New Year atmosphere. After the Spring Festival Gala ended, Li Xia asked the children to go to bed, and the sound of firecrackers began again in the morning of the next day. In the past two years, everyone has more money in their pockets, and it is much more lively than in previous years.\nEarly in the morning of the New Year, the children went to pay New Yearâs greetings to their elders. The red envelopes given by the old man were generous, and the three little ones were surprised when they saw them. As a result, when they went to pay New Yearâs greetings to their parents, the red envelopes given by their mother were also generous.\nThey came out of the main room and went to the east room, taking out the money and counting it one by one. âMom is so generous.â\nHuihua also nodded. âMom is so awesome.â\nShen Hui stroked the brand new coins one by one and said, âI want to make a lot of money in the future.â Yiyiimmediately raised his hand to agree, âCount me in.â After saying that, he saw his brother laughing, and he turned back to look at Huihua. âSister, donât you want to join us?â\nShe was a little hesitant, as she didnât think she could make a lot of money. She was hesitant about what to say, but her elder and younger brother spoke at the same time: âIt doesnât matter; we will make the money in the future, and you just spend it happily.â\n\n\nT/N :-Â  Hey Guys, thank you so much for all your comments and Ko-fi support.

Looking at the calendar, it has been a long time since Christmas; why hasnât Shen Yaozong come back yet?\nThis year, the beginning of spring came early, and the solar term has not arrived yet. Cement-related work cannot be done yet. She plans to return to the south before the start of construction. The preparations are in place, and the factory building was built very quickly. She didnât know what the situation was with the equipment and spare parts.\nLi Xia thought about it and was still worried. She felt that since they were all family, she should still show some concern. She mentioned it to the old man in the backyard, and the old man said to call Shen Yaozong.\nâThis kid is really; I donât know what to say about him.â\nHe muttered something and raised his hand to make an international call. After a while, the call was finally connected. Li Xia couldnât hear clearly, but from the old manâs words, she could tell that Shen Yaozong said he would be back by then. The equipment and parts had been negotiated, so the old man didnât have to worry.\nThatâs good. She didnât have to think too much. She made some tea for the old man, who frowned after taking a sip. Li Xia met his gaze, smiled, and began to explain.\nâThe doctor said that people with heart problems should not drink strong tea, but lighter tea is fine. Dad, you and Haiyang should drink less tea in the future; it will be good for your health.â\nYou canât just put a piece of tea leaf, right?\nThe old man smiled, put down the teacup, and nodded obediently to his daughter-in-law. In the past, in the United States, his son and daughter-in-law never cared about him. Now Shen Haiyang and his wife take care of everything for him, from food to clothing. He doesnât feel annoyed, but instead has a sense of happiness that he has someone to rely on when he is old.\nâDaughter-in-law, what are your plans for the next step? Are you going to travel back and forth between the north and the south to sell goods?â\nâIf the time is right next year, I will open a garment factory.â Li Xia smiled. There was nothing she couldnât tell her father-in-law.\nâUm.â\nThe old man responded softly, and Li Xia was wondering what this meant as she turned and left. He agreed and thought her development path was correct. Was he planning to invest in her?\nAfter the Lantern Festival, Li Xia went south. Before leaving, she discussed the project after the New Year with the person in charge of the project contracted last year. It was decided to start in March and still leave some work for her father and his people. The other party promised that there would be no problem.\nFrom north to south, after reaching the forefront of reform and opening up, it suddenly turned from winter to summer. The daytime temperature was almost 30 degrees, so she could just wear light clothes. She put away all her thick cotton clothes and put them in the suitcase.\nPurchase spring clothes, order summer clothes, and predict what styles will be popular this year. Xiao Liu saw that she had bought a large number of bell-bottom pants and asked in surprise, âCan such pants be sold?â\nâOf course.â\nBell bottoms have existed before and will become popular from now on, becoming the favorite of young people. Dance halls have already started to open in the south, and the north will soon follow the trend.\nSeveral people walked around Shenzhen and saw a man and a woman standing in the alley near the machinery factory, with several large bags beside them.\nZhang Qiuhua lowered her head quickly when she saw them, pulling her hat down low as if she didnât know them. Li Xia and the others didnât pay much attention to the others, and they were approached by someone not long after they walked out.\nâHey, want some electronics?â\nI just saw someone trading and buying goods, and then someone came to them with a bag to sell them. Bent goods, low price, high quality, absolutely good stuff.\nâLet me see. Are they legal ?â\nâAbsolutely the real deal. Good quality and low price.â\nElectronic hardware, she deliberately expanded the scope of business when applying for a business license. Now it is a legal business.\nThey contacted a group of low-priced electronic products. Small-commodity wholesale requires a complete range of goods. Then the three of them continued to travel and brought back a lot of ready-made goods on the way back.\nAfter a trip, it was much warmer when they returned to the north. In the second month of the lunar calendar, the pear trees were in full bloom, and the basins of water placed outside at night no longer froze.\nThe shop was being taken care of, and Li Xia had some free time during the off-season. She began to do a thorough cleaning at home, taking apart and washing her thick winter jacket and thick quilts. For several days in a row, the clothesline at home was full of clothes.\nIn the afternoon, the sun was shining brightly, and Qin Mu and she were sewing a quilt together on the floor. The two women each took one end, and they quickly finished sewing the quilt. Qin Mu was about to fold it up but was stopped by Li Xia.\nâWait a minute, I bought a quilt cover this time. Put it on the quilt, and you can just wash the quilt cover when it gets dirty. You donât have to take it apart and wash it.â\nOrdinary blue printed cloth, the style is different from that of later generations. There are no openings on the four sides, but a square opening is left in the middle of the quilt. After the two people put the quilt in, they can pull it flat on both sides. The lower part that touches the skin is covered tightly, and the opening is on the upper side that does not touch the skin.\nâThatâs great. Itâs so easy to clean when it gets dirty. I want to buy it. Is it expensive?â\nâThere are a lot of them coming in. Iâll give you two.â\nâDonât. You already have the capital. Even if we have a good relationship, I canât take it from you for free.â\nâOkay, Iâll give it to you at the purchase price. You can choose the pattern yourself, and Iâll deduct it from Lao Hanâs salary at the end of the month.â\nâThanks.â\nIn a few days, she cleaned the house from top to bottom, took apart and washed all the cotton-padded jackets and trousers and put them away, and bought some wool to knit sweaters for her family.\nâSister-in-law, come quickly.â\nJust as she took out the wool and hadnât finished knitting the four knitting needles, she heard Qin Muâs anxious shout from the backyard. She dropped her needle and thread and ran to the backyard. Both the father and son had heart disease, and this was the first thing she thought of when they heard about the accident.\nSure enough, the old man fainted on the ground in the backyard. Qin Mu had come to deliver snacks, and now the snacks were scattered all over the ground. She reached out to support the old man, but she couldnât move him alone, and sweat appeared on her forehead in anxiety.\nâWhen I came in, I saw him letting go of the receiver and about to fall, so I hurried over to help him up. Whatâ¦what should I do?â\nLi Xia calmly took out the quick-acting heart pills from the drawer and put two pills in the old manâs mouth. Then she reached out and grabbed the old manâs arms, and she turned her back to him and prepared to carry him on her back.\nâHelp me; we need to get to the hospital quickly.â\nâOh, oh, okay.â\nThey were both working people, and the two women were quite strong. With the help of Qin Mu, Li Xia carried her father-in-law on her back. She gently put him in the car and laid him flat in the back seat. Qin Mu also sat in the back seat to support him. Li Xia went to the driverâs seat, closed the door, started the car, and drove towards the hospital at high speed.\n",

She asked Qin Mu to watch over the patient while she borrowed a phone from the nurse station and called Shen Haiyang.\n“We’re already in the hospital. Don’t worry. Come slowly on the way.”\nThey were father and son, and she had to inform Shen Haiyang even though she knew he couldn’t be stimulated. But she didn’t give him the information before, but only after he was sent to the hospital and in the emergency room. In this way, he knew that the rest was the doctor’s business, so he was not so anxious.\nAfter making a phone call, the nurse gave her a bill and asked her to go and pay. She ran up and down the stairs several times to pay the bill, and when she returned, Shen Haiyang was already standing outside the emergency room. Qin Mu was telling him about the situation, and everyone’s face was anxious.\nLi Xia poured him a cup of warm water and asked him to sit down and wait. “Don’t worry, there’s a doctor here; he’ll be fine.”\nTime always passes so slowly outside the emergency room. The three of them waited anxiously outside until the door finally opened and the doctor came out. The three of them stepped forward, and the doctor spoke fluently.\n“He was sent to the hospital in time and was resuscitated. He is not awake yet and needs to be observed.”\nLi Xia and her husband stayed to take care of the patient, while Qin Mu returned home to cook. A few minutes after she left, Li Xia turned around and saw that she was back.\n“Why are you back again?”\n“Someone is looking for you.”\nFollowing behind her was the old man’s assistant. The man came in hurriedly, and when he saw the old man’s condition, his eyes were full of regret.\n“Oh, I should have known not to call him. But… I have to tell my boss if something happens.”\n“What happened?” Li Xia and her husband asked in unison.\n“The boss’s money in the US account was swindled away by Shen Yaozong.” The first sentence briefly states the facts, followed by an explanation.\n“The boss cooperated with Xixi Electronics and bought their retired old production line. In the first year, we produced most of the parts for 50,000 black-and-white TVs. After we came back, we purchased some unimportant small accessories and assembled them. The money was paid in three installments. The down payment had already been paid, but the largest amount of the mid-term payment did not enter the other party’s account at all. Instead, it was transferred to other places by Shen Yaozong.”\nThe man explained the matter simply and clearly, and Li Xia and her husband didn’t know what to say after listening. Shen Yaozong took his father’s money and ran away. This was premeditated. No wonder the old man was so angry that he had a heart attack. No one would not be anxious after hearing this. A lifetime of hard work, just gone like this?\n“Have you called the police?” Li Xia asked.\n“I have reported it, but… he is not in the United States, and the money is not in the United States either.”\nShen Haiyang works in the procuratorate and is very familiar with this kind of thing. “Shen Yaozong has been prepared for this. It’s hard to say where the money has been transferred. Even he himself doesn’t know where it is right now. The world is so big; where can we catch him?”\n“So, can we just let it go like this?”\nThe two men were silent; they really didn’t know how to answer. The world is so big, and there are so many unsolved cases every day. In economic cases and transnational crimes, you have to catch the person, and his money must not be squandered; otherwise, it’s useless to catch him. Even if he goes to jail, you will still have no money, and it doesn’t solve the problem at all.\n“What should I do now? The project payment is in my hands, so I can build a factory. But the equipment and components are the big expense. What’s the point of building an empty factory after what he did? The partner only paid the down payment, and if the balance is not paid, they will not deliver these things.”\n“Don’t worry, wait until the old man wakes up.”\n“All right.”\nThe man left, and Li Xia and her husband sat in the chairs with gloomy faces. What kind of thing is this? Their own son stabbed them in the back. No one can bear it. The current problem is money. How can they fill such a huge funding gap? Let’s wait for the old man to wake up and see how much he has left. Then we can calculate and think of a solution.\nIf the factory can’t be opened, the factory building and land are still valuable. But with such a good opportunity, can they just give up?\n“What a pity. The past decade or so has been the golden period for the sales of black and white TVs. Is Shen Yaozong stupid? Wait until the factory runs for a few years, and the money will multiply many times over in a few years.”\nLi Xia shook her head, angry and resentful towards Shen Yaozong. Damn it, can’t you wait until you make money? Even if you make money, you can’t secretly do something for your father. Just because he disagrees with you and you repeatedly persuade him to return to the United States to no avail, do you do something like this?\n“Don’t think about that. Take good care of your father for now. Wait until he wakes up before making any plans.”\n“All right.”\nThis is the only way for now; otherwise, Li Xia’s money would be a big deal for ordinary people today. But for these entrepreneurs who invest, it is still not enough.\nQin Mu came to deliver food in the evening, and Li Xia asked Shen Haiyang to drive home to rest. “Don’t argue with me; I’m in better health than you.”\nThe man took the car keys. “I didn’t argue with you.”\nHe also has a heart disease and can’t stay up late or overwork. If he gets sick, she will have to take care of him, which will cause trouble for her. For now, let’s wait and see how his father’s condition changes before deciding whether to hire someone to take care of him.\nHe drove Qin Mu back to her home first, and then went home. The three little ones had washed up and finished their homework. When he got home, the children heard the noise and ran out of the backyard.\n“Dad, how is Grandpa?”\n“He is not awake yet,” he said, stopping the car, turning off the engine, and smiling at the children. “Go watch TV; mom and dad will take care of all these things.”\n“Oh, is Mom staying with Grandpa in the hospital tonight?” Huihua asked, and the two brothers also looked at her inquiringly.\n“right.”\n“Dad, go and have some rest. We’ll go to bed after we finish watching.”\n“Okay.”\nThe street door was closed, and Shen Haiyang went to sleep. There were employees watching TV in the bun shop in front, and they would clean up and lock the door after watching at night.\nThe next morning, he got up early and called his office to ask for leave. Now he was in logistics, so it was easy to ask for leave. After talking to his boss and hanging up the phone, he was about to go to the hospital to deliver food when a guest came to his house.\n“Brother, what are you doing? Come in and sit down.”\nThe second son and his wife were standing in the yard, carrying large bags. The construction site had not started yet, and Li Xia had not written home to ask them to come, so how come they suddenly came, and it was them?\n“Hey, it’s already the New Year, and we two are coming to live with you. Let Xia find us a job.” She pointed at her husband and said, “His leg is healed, and he can do any work on the construction site. I can cook for you guys, or let Xia arrange for me to go to the mall and watch the counter for her.”\nShen Haiyang poured them some water, and the second brother apologized to his brother-in-law. “Don’t listen to her nonsense. She didn’t even graduate from elementary school and doesn’t even know how to count accounts. It would be nice to let her cook for everyone. The main thing is that I haven’t received Xia’s letter so far, so I came to see what the construction site is like this year.”\n“You are the one who doesn’t understand…”\n“Okay, shut up. Have you forgotten what we talked about before?”\nThe second brother spoke sternly, and the woman finally stopped talking about going to the mall to look after the counter. Qin Mu brought them breakfast, and the second brother saw Shen Haiyang carrying a lunch box and quickly asked who he was delivering the breakfast to.\n“My dad is in the hospital.”\n“Oh, no wonder I didn’t see Xia. Then you should go to work. I’ll bring her food.”\nLao Er was about to take the lunch box from his hand, but Shen Haiyang dodged him. “I’ve asked for leave; I’ll go deliver it. You guys eat quickly; we’ll talk about work later.”\nAfter Shen Haiyang left, the second son glared at his wife. “Hurry up and eat. After you finish eating, help Xia do something. If Xia doesn’t want to work at the construction site anymore, we can go home in a few days.”\n“Hey, Li Lao Er, you are such a person… If we stop working at the construction site, then wouldn’t our travel expenses be wasted?”\n“You deserve it. You did it on your own initiative. I can’t stop you.”\n“Then you, I just want to earn more money.”\n“Okay, stop talking nonsense. Eat your meal and get back to work. I’ll go clean up the yard.”\nNormally, the construction site should be open at this time, but Li Xia is quiet. The grandfathers at home discussed coming to see her, but they couldn’t write to her because they were slow. She insisted on coming, so he followed her. Sure enough, Li Xia’s father-in-law is sick, but his illness doesn’t affect the work at the construction site. Is there anything else? I’ll ask her when she comes back.\nAfter Shen Haiyang arrived at the hospital, he told Li Xia that her second brother and his wife had come. Li Xia nodded and thought about how to arrange it. Her second brother had been good to her since she was a child, but her second sister-in-law always wanted to take advantage of her, so she was not willing to get along with her for a long time. Her family was concerned about her and asked her second brother to come and see the situation and then write to the family after the matter was resolved.\n“Let’s settle down first.”\nIf the old man continues to build the factory, then the couple can make arrangements. But if the money cannot be recovered and the factory cannot continue, then they can invest in opening another breakfast shop.\nThe breakfast shop has a small investment and a quick return. She has been doing this for many years and knows how to master the taste. As long as the couple is diligent, they will have no worries about making a living.\nHer family’s affairs were trivial. If someone wanted to move to the city, she could help them settle down without having to trouble others for help. The most worrying thing right now was the old man’s factory. If the money could not be recovered, would he really give up such a good business opportunity?\nThe couple took care of the elderly in the hospital, while Qin Mu and the second son and his wife were at home. The two of them had nothing to do, so the second son’s wife started knitting sweaters for the children, and the second son took the initiative to take over the work of delivering meals and running errands, letting Shen Haiyang go to work.\n“I don’t know when he will wake up, so I can’t keep asking for leave.”\nThat’s the reason. Shen Haiyang returned to work two days later. Such a big thing happened in his family. When the weather was warm enough to start the work, their construction site was deserted, and there was no movement at all.\nMurong Danling went to the mall where Li Xia worked to buy things. When she heard the news, she couldn’t help laughing; her mouth almost stretched to her ears.\n“Just wait. The old man dies first, and then Shen Haiyang dies. Li Xia’s good days will be over.”\nFang Zhongcheng pulled her aside and reminded her to keep her voice down. “How can you say that in public? Are you crazy? You go crazy when you mention them.”\n“Humph, don’t you wish them bad luck?”\n“I….”\nEven if you are looking forward to it, you can’t say it openly. Fang Zhongcheng said nothing, and he strongly disagreed with her approach. He looked up at Li Xia’s shop, and his calculations were hidden deep inside.\nOn Li Xia’s side, the old man in the hospital woke up after being in a coma for three days. He sighed for what Shen Yaozong had done, closed his eyes, and didn’t speak for a long time.\n“Dad, please don’t worry. Money is something you can’t bring with you when you are born, and you can’t take it with you when you die. You can’t spend all the money you have left in your lifetime. Don’t hurt yourself for it.”\nShe knew that he was not only hurt about the loss of money but also because of his son’s betrayal. Shen Yaozong had always been pessimistic about mainland investment, and it was possible that he was thinking about doing this for the good of the old man. He was afraid that he would lose everything, so he transferred the funds in advance to retain his strength.\nThis shameless idea was just her blind guess. She asked for money to comfort the old man without bringing it. He was sick, and his spirit was even worse. He couldn’t be stimulated again.\nThe old man drank the milk slowly and took deep breaths to adjust his mentality. It doesn’t matter; just think that he took the share that I prepared for him in advance. Since he is so pessimistic about the mainland, it’s better for him to leave. Just don’t regret it in the future; there is no way to regret it. Mountains of gold and silver have nothing to do with him anymore.\nThe old man quickly recovered from the blow, and after drinking the milk, he said to Li Xia, “Daughter-in-law, are you interested in investing in an electronics factory?”\n“I,”\nLi Xia was thinking quickly. There was no business that made money that she was not interested in, but she had to have the ability to do it. Perhaps she could put everything she had on the line and then find some investment to open this factory that was already halfway completed.\nOriginally, with her ability, it was impossible to do this at this time. But Shen Yaozong did this, and she had a chance. Even if she didn’t own too much, the profit would be greater than her selling clothes.\nLast year, she traded all her earnings and the remaining money for buying a house for the old man, and her funds increased several times. If the old man had said this before, she would have just shaken her head, saying that he was not short of money and that her money was not worth mentioning in the electronics factory. She couldn’t take advantage of this.\nBut now it’s different. The old man is facing a funding gap and needs a reliable person to help him do things. Looking for investment, she can buy shares; this time is just right.\n\n\nTRANSLATOR’S NOTE :- I have completed the translation of this novel.

The land, licenses, and production permits could only be approved so easily because of his overseas Chinese status. If he gave up, it would all be in vain.\nShe went home to help the old man go to bed and rest, while Qin Mu took care of him in the backyard. When she came out of the backyard, her second brother and his wife were waiting at home.\nLi Lao Er saw his sister coming out and quickly poured her a glass of water. Li Xia moistened her throat and said, âThe work on the construction site is uncertain now.â\nBefore she finished her words, the second son, regardless of his wifeâs disappointed face, quickly said, âOh, then weâll leave this afternoon. We canât help you here, so we wonât cause you any trouble.â\nâNo, thatâs not what I meant.â The second sister-in-law immediately looked up and looked at her with burning eyes. âIf you want to stay in the city, I can lend you money to open a breakfast shop, and you can pay me back when you make money. What do you think?â\nThe second brother said, âYour second sister-in-law is just an average cook; is this okay?â\nâIâll teach you the formula, and you just follow it. Itâs not that difficult. The investment is small, and the return is quick. As long as you are willing to work hard, there will be no problem.â\nThe second brother thought about it and nodded. âOkay. We have some savings.â\nWhen the second sister-in-law heard that she had to pay for it herself, she immediately shouted, âHusbandâ¦â\nThe second brother turned around and glared at her. You want to make money yourself, but you donât want to invest. What? You want my sister to pay for it? Absolutely not. At most, if itâs not enough, I can borrow from her a little less. When I make money, I will pay her back first.\nâXia, letâs do as you say and run this breakfast shop. How much do you want? Let me see if what I have is enough.â\nLi Xia smiled and said, âItâs okay. If itâs not enough, I can lend it to you. You guys go find a store first, a place with a good location.â\nShe supported her second brother and his wife to open a breakfast shop so that they could earn money independently in the city. This way, they could do their own things and not have to interfere with each other in the future. She didnât want to deal with her second sister-in-law all day long. She just wanted to support them out of consideration for the brother-sister relationship. The factory needed help from someone close to her, so she planned to let her third brother and her sister-in-law come to stay over later.\nThe second brother and his wife found a shop quickly. After Li Xia helped them check it out, they signed a contract with the landlord. The second brother didnât have enough money, so she borrowed the rent for the first year.\nâSister-in-law, you are really a kind person.â\nPeople at that time had just come from the era of the big collective, and many people did not understand these things at all. Many people suffered losses from this kind of verbal agreement, but then others regretted it. Li Xia had seen this situation on TV, so of course she would not make a mistake.\nâItâs better to write it clearly.â\nThe contract is for 20 years, but the rent is paid annually. The specific amount is calculated based on the situation of the year and the average rent of the year, and the landlord cannot ask for more, nor can the tenant not pay.\nThis is stable, and neither side suffers. After signing the contract, the couple immediately packed up the house in a hurry. There was no news from Li Xia about recovering the debt, and even Shen Yaozong couldnât be found. Across the country, Shen Haiyang said that there was basically no hope for the money.\nâWhat do you think about selling all three of our stores?â\nShen Haiyang was a little surprised. His wife was really bold. Maybe running an electronics factory was really profitable; otherwise, why would she be so reluctant to give it up?\nâIs it enough? Probably not.â\nâItâs definitely not enough. Itâs far from enough.â\nIf it were another ten years, the money from her shop plus the courtyard would probably be enough for the current investment. Well, no one can make money from the time difference, and she doesnât have Doraemonâs Anywhere Door.\nâLooking for investment. Iâll try one company after another. I canât just give up on this.â\nShe decided to close her shop and look for investment to open an electronics factory, so she went to the backyard to discuss it with the old man. He was the legal owner of the factory. She had made up her mind, and the two of them had to have a good talk.\nAfter hearing her idea, the old man looked at her with new eyes. He thought she was very courageous as a rural woman. She didnât deposit the money in the bank but invested in shops and houses. Now that so much capital in his factory had been withdrawn, he made a suggestion, and she made a decision in such a short time.\nâWhat if you donât find an investment? If you sell your shop, the price wonât be the same as it is now.â\nâI know. When doing business, there are always opportunities along with dangers. Itâs okay. Even if I lose, I can just start over again.â\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, I knew what to do to make money. At the very least, I could earn enough for my retirement, so there was nothing to worry about.\nâI still have some funds in my hand. If you are determined, I will give you all of them.â\nâIf you trust me, letâs do it.â\nâOkay, go ahead and do it. If it succeeds, weâll divide the factory into shares according to the amount of investment. Iâll change my will someday, and everything under my name will be yours from now on.â\nIn other words, after the factory is opened, apart from the investment, the rest will all belong to the couple. The old man spoke clearly, and Shen Yaozong did this, so the relationship between father and son would be resolved. He was in poor health, and Li Xia took the lead, so the financial aspects had to be clarified.\nThe old man had bet everything on itâhis life savings. If he couldnât find an investment, then the down payment he had paid for the production line would be wasted.\nâThen Iâll look for investment.â\nâIâll give you the budget.â\nAfter receiving the budget, Li Xia calculated the sum of money from all parties and how much investment was needed. Who should she go to? The partner had already paid part of the money in advance, and the funding gap now was the remaining part.\nThe old man signed a cooperation agreement with the other party. He bought the other partyâs production line, and most of the core parts were also provided by the other party, and the other party also provided technical support. This kind of nature is most suitable for the mainland today. Once it goes into production and the product passes the quality inspection and is put on the market, money will soon come like a tide.\nâIâll try to contact my partner to see if I can pay on credit. First, send us 10,000 worth of goods, and then pay the rest when our funds are in circulation.â\nThe old man also tried his best. He didnât know if this method would work, but he had to try it now. The down payment had been paid, and the other party had already produced so many products. If they just returned the money, it would be troublesome for them. He tried to persuade them with emotion and reason, to see if he could persuade them.\nâOkay, letâs try everything.â\nSelling the shop. Because she knew the future, she acted decisively. She immediately posted an advertisement for selling the shop and asked people to bring the goods. Otherwise, if the shop was sold, it would be troublesome for her to keep the goods.\nâSister, do you really want to sell it?â\nXiao Liu had been working for the shop for such a long time, and she was immediately panicked when she heard the news. She was now the shop manager, and her basic salary plus commission income was much higher than her brotherâs. What would she do if the shop was sold? Wouldnât she be despised by her mother, who favored boys over girls and sold them for a high bride price?\nâI canât help it. I need money urgently.â\nâHow much do you need? Canât we all chip in?â another clerk asked.\nâDonât search your pockets,â Li Xia sighed softly. âI need a large sum of money. Iâm sorry, everyone; I really canât help it. If the people who take over the shops donât want you, Iâll give you two more monthsâ salary, and you can find another job.â\nIt was so hard to find a job during this period. The news shocked everyone in her store. Han Junâs eyes widened in fear. He couldnât work here anymore. He probably couldnât go back to his company. What should he do? He didnât have the capital to start a business. Should he find a job? He would regret it if he threw away his stable job and looked for another one.\nâDonât worry, just follow me. You can help me with whatever I do. As long as I earn money, I will never treat you unfairly.â\nHis facial expression was so vivid that he had perfectly expressed his meaning without even opening his mouth. Hearing what Li Xia said, he patted his chest and finally felt relieved. She had so much money in her hands that if she didnât do this, she would definitely do something else. Who cares what she does? As long as she doesnât commit a crime, he will follow her.\nâWhat about these goods? Letâs sell them as soon as possible. Otherwise, if we sell them to the shop, the other party may lower the price.â\nâI also want to get out as soon as possible, but this is not something that can be imagined.â\nâI will go find buyers and try to lessen the lossâ¦ Try not to make a loss, or make some money.â\nâOkay.â\nThe shop is being resold, and the shop is being sold at a low price. As soon as this big slogan was posted, people in the mall were talking about it. Such a good business; it was so prosperous during the Chinese New Year last year; why is it being sold? People donât know the value of this shop in the future, and if they knew, they would be even more distressed.\nZhang Qiuhua came here to check the market and naturally saw the news. She was immediately overjoyed, ran out quickly, and rode her bike all the way to find Murong Danling.\nâWhat are you doing?â\nMurong Danling opened the door for her and asked curiously when she saw that she was out of breath. They opened the door and went into the house. Zhang Qiuhua saw that Fang Zhongcheng was at home, shook her head, and whispered to her to go out for a while. After changing shoes and going downstairs, the two found a secluded place to talk.\nâWhat did you say? Buy Li Xiaâs shop.â\nâYes. Letâs buy a shop together and become business owners in the future. Apply for a business license, and we wonât have to worry about being checked.â\nâLi Xia is selling her shop.â Murong Danling lowered her head and muttered to herself, thinking about something completely different from her. âIt seems that her familyâs problem is serious. They are so poor that they have to sell their shop. Hahaâ¦â\nShe laughed so hard that she looked crazy, which frightened Zhang Qiuhua. She pushed her and tried to get back to the point. âHey, weâre talking about buying Li Xiaâs shop. What the hell are you laughing at?â\nâBuy her shop? Humph, I wonât buy it, and I wonât give her cash. Let her be embarrassed; there will be many more embarrassments in the future.â\nâNot buying?â\nâNot buying.â\nMurong Danling turned and left, leaving Zhang Qiuhua in a daze. What kind of brain circuit is this girl using? Why do you care why Li Xia is selling it? We bought it because it would definitely be useful, right? Sell the goods in your hands quickly, and we will have enough money.\nâYou are hurting others and not benefiting yourself. Are you mentally ill? Why did I choose a partner like you?â\nMurong Danling was not happy about it. She didnât have enough money to buy a shop. She checked all the people she knew in her mind, but found that there was no one she could borrow money from.\nShe pushed the cart home dejectedly, and the next day she went to the mall again with a thought in her mind. She found that the store with the smallest area was already being negotiated.\nLi Xia spent half the morning negotiating prices with someone. When she returned home at noon, her second sister-in-law stopped her and asked about the situation. âAre you really selling all of them? What about us? We are cleaning up our house. You are not going to rush to ask us for the rent, are you?â\nâNo. Just go ahead with your business.â Itâs just a few dollars; I wouldnât ask you for it.\nâI thought that since you couldnât even run a business as big as your mall, you would be even less likely to look down on this small steamed bun shop. I was afraid.â\nâDonât worry. The bun shop is to help you gain a foothold in the provincial capital. It has nothing to do with my business.â\nâThatâs good; thatâs good. Oh, luckily I didnât go to the mall to help you sell goods; otherwise, I would have to leave now.â\nâSo you should develop yourself, work hard, and lay a foundation for yourself. It is better to rely on yourself than on anyone else.â\nâOh, thatâs the reason.â\nThe back hall of the store, rented by my second brother and his wife, was a place for rest. After packing up the store a few days ago, the two of them moved their bedding over there. Li Xia was busy looking for investment, and she came back in the evening with a happy face.\nâI have contacted that lady. She said she would be returning to the provincial capital soon. We will meet then to discuss in detail.â\nShen Haiyang poured her a glass of water and said, âThen donât worry; look at the blisters at the corners of your mouth.â\nLi Xia touched it, and it really hurt. âItâs because I didnât drink enough water. Spring is too dry. I will bring a water bottle tomorrow to replenish water at any time.â\nâWell, donât push yourself too hard.â\nThe man supported her so much that he didnât even mention that the money for the shop was given to him by his father when she sold the shop. He also had no objection to his fatherâs suggestion of dividing the shares in the future. All the money she earned and the money from his shop were counted as her shares. With her husbandâs support and protection, she had nothing to fear.\nThe three little ones all knew that something had happened at home recently, and they were all very well behaved. The Huihua was going to participate in the childrenâs competition, so she practiced after finishing her homework every day, and she didnât even watch TV. The other two were also very self-conscious, doing their homework, practicing the piano, and going to bed on time.\nThe next day, a shop found a buyer. She originally sold accessories, shoes, and hats, and the other party seemed to want to continue this business, so he started to negotiate the price for the goods.\nAfter an afternoon of bargaining, the two sides finally reached an agreement. The payment was in cash, and the store and the goods were handed over to the buyer immediately.\nLi Xia took the money and got into the car. She looked up at the mall and felt disappointed. She had just warmed up the food, and it was sold out. Her business was so booming last year, and she made so much money, which was beyond her expectations.\nâItâs okay. Once my electronics factory opens, Iâm sure Iâll make a fortune.â\nTake a deep breath and tell yourself that there is gain in loss. This is just a sesame seed, and there is a watermelon waiting for her to earn ahead. Donât lose the big picture for the small one. You canât catch the wolf without sacrificing the child.\nOver the next few days, more people came to ask about the store, but they couldnât agree on the price. This time, she turned around on the way to the mall and went to the drama troupe. She hired two people to perform a play for her for ten yuan. The two, a man and a woman, often played husband and wife on stage and agreed to her request. They rushed to the mall first and talked to Han Jun. When Li Xia arrived, the two families had already started arguing.\nâHey, first come, first served; we saw this store first.â\nâIâve never heard of first come, first served in buying and selling. Do you think it was the supply and marketing cooperatives of the past where people had to queue up to buy things? Now itâs a market economy; whoever bids the highest gets it.â\nâHey, you are so unreasonable. I liked it first; how come you came to snatch it from me?â\nâIâve had my eye on it for a long time and have contacted him before. But I didnât sign the contract due to other reasons.â\nThe actor invited by Li Xia glanced at Han Jun while speaking, and Han Jun immediately understood and nodded quickly. The more buyers, the better. The more competition there is, the higher the price can be sold.\nâHey, our boss is here. Letâs talk to her about the details.â\nThe three parties sat down to discuss the price. When there was only one company, the other party tried to lower the price. Now the competitor started with the original price, and he was anxious to add another 200 yuan.\nâIâll add another three hundred.â\nâIâll add three hundred.â\nNeither side had much money, so they just raised the price by two or three hundred. The two actors had already known Li Xiaâs bottom line beforehand, and when the price reached a certain level, they gave up with regret. In the end, the other party completed the transaction with a price higher than Li Xiaâs.\nAfter signing the contract and transferring the property, Han Jun walked out of the mall with cash. When he returned, he learned that it was the person she hired, and he was immediately impressed.\nâHow could you come up with such a weird idea? We were in a hurry to sell, so the price would definitely be suppressed. But what you did was not only suppress it, but it was even higher.â\nLi Xia smiled but said nothing, thinking that it was all due to watching TV. People in that period were still very simple, and business had just started to develop, so no one had so many tricks. After decades of experience, these tricks were childâs play and did not work at all.\nShe went home, counted her money again, and went to see the lady the next day. She was told to come back in two days and to go again in two days. After that, she went to the city construction company to discuss the start of construction.\nThe project was scheduled to start next week. She went home and wrote to her motherâs family, asking her third brother to bring people to the construction site. After the construction was completed, she asked him to stay and help her. A factory would need a lot of people, and she had to have a few who she could trust and rely on.\n",
    "70": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c43-2/\nThe next morning, she told the old man her decision. The old man had been ill for a long time and nodded silently after hearing her decision.\n“The equipment we ordered was to be delivered in June this year, according to the contract. I contacted the other party by phone, but they did not agree to give us the products in batches, so we still have to find the investment.”\n“Okay, got it.”\nShe went out and got in the car, sitting in the mall for the whole morning. In the afternoon, another man came, and the man next door also came to test her bottom line. Both families had the same idea: they were short of money.\n“Can you pay part of it and owe part of it? Don’t be afraid; I’ll pay it off as soon as possible. It’s just that I don’t have that much money at the moment, so”\n“Me too. Half a year. We will definitely pay it off in half a year.”\n“No. I wouldn’t sell it if I didn’t need the money urgently.”\n“Then, make it cheaper.”\n“Big sister, we know each other well. You know how much it cost when we bought it and how much the shop can earn. Do you think my price is too high?”\nThe woman smiled awkwardly. She knew the price was right. But she didn’t have that much money. She hesitated for two days and wanted to negotiate with Li Xia, but it turned out that there was no room for negotiation. That’s right, if they were in a hurry to sell it, they were short of money. If they owed money, why would they sell it?\n“Give me some time, and I’ll try to find a way to raise the money.”\n“I’ll sell if someone wants to buy it.”\n“I’ll go raise the money right away.”\n“Then I’ll go raise money too.”\nThe woman planned to buy her business and then open up a large wholesale business. After that, she immediately left the mall to raise money. Li Xia calculated the money in her hand and in her mind, wondering how long she could last.\nThe person who wanted to buy a shop went to raise money, and she went to visit the lady ( the one she met at the conference with her father-in-law) when the time came. After a discussion, the lady read her plan and nodded. However, it was not an investment but a loan of money.\n“In two years, you have to pay back all the loan and interest.”\nIs this pessimistic or optimistic? If optimistic, why not choose investment, a high-return method? If she is not optimistic, how can you lend her money? Li Xia can’t figure it out, so she didn’t think about it. Anyway, she just needs to get the money.\n“Okay, two years, and I’ll pay you back with interest.”\nShe went home with vegetables and meat in her arms, looking very happy. Qin Mu knew that something good must have happened, and she was happy for her. The two of them were chatting while cooking in the kitchen, and soon Han Jun came in.\n“Zhang Qiuhua was arrested.”\n“What’s the situation?”\n“She was really smuggling. The police have been cracking down on smuggling these days, and they noticed her a long time ago. They caught her red-handed on Xinhua Street yesterday.”\n“How long is the sentence usually?”\n“It depends on how much she smuggled.”\n“Oh.” You choose your own path, and you have to bear the consequences yourself. This incident once again proves her saying that if you often walk by the river, you will get your feet wet. She just didn’t know if Zhang Qiuhua would betray Murong Danling.\nAfter being arrested, Zhang Qiuhua thought for a long time whether to confess or not and decided not to tell. They still have a batch of goods, which are worth a lot of money. If they confess, not only will they both have to go to jail, but if they are involved in this batch of goods, the crime will be even more serious. The money is gone, and the freedom is still gone. It is better to negotiate with Murong Danling.\nForty-eight hours later, Murong Danling met her, and after a few glances and gestures, they finally reached an agreement. She took the blame for herself.\nA few days later, Murong Danling asked Fang Zhongcheng to help find someone to buy Li Xia’s shop for her. Fang Zhongcheng asked curiously, “Didn’t you say you wouldn’t buy her shop and give her cash? Why did you change your mind now?”\n“The factory had a funding gap, and she invested the money in building a factory building. I want her to invest everything and lose everything in the end.”\n“Are you sure she can’t find investment or sell the factory?”\n“It’s been so long. If she finds an investment, will she still sell the shop? Humph, when selling the factory, won’t you let her fail to sell it or sell it at a loss? By then, she will go bankrupt, and our shop will make a lot of money. Your son will come to you obediently.”\n“Okay, I’ll listen to you.”\nFang Zhongcheng gnashed his teeth and blamed Li Xia for his children’s coldness and dissatisfaction with him. Murong Danling can make money now, but she can’t have children anymore. The couple discussed which of the three children to take back. He thought she would want Shen Hui, but she chose Yiyi.”\n“Children are easier to educate when they are young.”\nMurong Danling said so, and he felt the same way. Although he was still curious why she didn’t choose her own son, he would definitely be happy to choose his son, as men still value blood ties.\nLi Xia went out for a while, and when she came back, Han Jun told her that the shop had been sold. The person who came forward was someone entrusted to Murong Danling, and the transaction went very smoothly.\nMurong Danling didn’t know that Li Xia had found an investor, and Li Xia didn’t know that Murong Danling hated her. This competition was like two people competing on a track. She had to run hard, and when she saw the opportunity, she wanted to kick Li Xia so that her opponent couldn’t get up again. She and Zhang Qiuhua both thought that Li Xia was secretly harming them, and now their hatred for Li Xia is getting deeper and deeper.\nLi Xia was busy with her own affairs, not thinking about her intrigues. You have to rely on yourself on the road of life, and you have to walk upright and stand straight. She had no worries, and she was busy with her career. She will not let go of those who hurt her, and the remaining others have nothing to do with her.\nWith the funds in place and the foundations laid, the roar of machinery could be heard again at the construction site. Li Xia came to see her father. “They said you are old and that my third brother and others should do the work. Why don’t you listen to them?”\nThe old man smiled naively: “I don’t do any heavy work; I just help to check the materials and take care of safety issues. How tiring can it be? Your brothers have no experience either, so I feel more at ease if I help them take care of it.”\n“Okay, be safe.”\n“Yes, I will.”\nThe project is in progress, changing every day. Li Xia will go to the construction site to supervise whenever she has time. This is her first factory, so she must not be fooled. It must be built solidly, as she will have to add more factories in the future. If the first batch fails to pass the test and needs to be reworked, it will be troublesome.\nThe electronics factory will start with two production lines in the first batch. She is moving towards her goal, while Murong Danling is hoping that she will be desperate. She pays close attention to her, day by day.\nThe clothing store was in the off-season, so Murong Danling put all her money on the line and borrowed a large sum of money. She was trying to save money recently. At night, she and her husband simply cooked noodles in clear soup, which tasted bland. But when she thought about how much money the store would make after paying off the debt, she immediately became energetic again.\n“When Yiyicomes, you have to feed him well and dress him well. You can’t be outdone by his mother.”\n“Don’t worry, once Li Xia loses everything, our brat will come looking for you.”\nFang Zhongcheng laughed, as if he saw Li Xia in such a state of desolation. Days passed, and as the temperature rose, the business of the shop improved. The couple lived a more delicious life, and in the evening, they carried wine and cooked meat, singing as they walked.\nThe construction site was rushing to finish the work, and Li Xia and Han Jun drove to order some spare parts that did not require much technical content. At first, this matter was handed over to Shen Yaozong, thinking that this guy had already finished it, but in the end, it was nothing.\nWith the funds in place, all preparations were made in full swing. The two first went to Shanghai, where they compared and negotiated with several machinery factories one by one.\nShe doesn’t have a lot of money now, so she has to be very tight on the price. “The quality has to be good too. Even though it’s just an unimportant accessory, there can’t be any problems. This is related to the quality of our products. If there’s a problem with this, our reputation will be ruined.”\nHan Jun nodded. “A comrade of mine works at the Second Machinery Factory. I will treat him to dinner tonight to test the waters.”\n“Okay.”\nAfter treating everyone to a meal, she was shocked by the news Han Jun brought back. “The orders from their factory have already reached October in the second half of the year. This is a well-established state-owned factory, and the quality must be up to standard, but what should we do at this point in time? The production line in the United States will be shipped back for installation next month, and we can’t produce if the small parts here are not in place.”\nLi Xia stood up anxiously. She really didn’t expect these situations. “What should we do?”\n“I’ll go ask other factories.”\nAfter two days in Shanghai, several manufacturers had their orders scheduled until the second half of the year, and they were not in a hurry. Li Xia was so angry that she cursed Shen Yaozong. If it weren’t for him, they would have received the goods by now. But now they are worried about who to place the order with.\n“Let’s go. There are several factories in the Central Plains that can produce it. Let’s go over there and take a look.”\nThey drove from Shanghai to Zhongyuan Machinery and finally found a factory that could help them place an order. They also had an order, but the time was not too tight. They were in a hurry, so they could produce a batch for them first.\n“Director Xu, the quality must be guaranteed.”\nThe man, surnamed Xu, patted his chest and said, “Don’t worry. Our Zhongyuan Machinery products can definitely stand the test.”\nAfter dinner, Han Jun drove Director Xu home and stuffed a bag into the man’s hand. The man refused, but Han Jun forced it into his hand.\n“Please ask Director Xu for help with this batch of goods. It must be completed before the specified time.”\n“Don’t worry, don’t worry.”\nAfter using some tricks, they finally succeeded in placing the order. The holes caused by Shen Yaozong were now completely plugged. The two of them rested well at night and drove back the next day.\nIt was afternoon when they got home, and they took turns driving, so they didn’t feel tired. She went to the backyard and told the old man about the situation, and the old man nodded and let her go to rest first.\n“You’ve worked hard. Go wash up and take a rest.”\nShe took a shower, changed clothes, and filled the washing machine with water as usual. It wasn’t too late to wash clothes before going to bed since it wasn’t dark yet.\nQin Mu pushed her and said, “Go and have a rest. I’ll wash your clothes.”\n“How can I let you do that?” She was just taking care of the old man and cooking for the five of them. The cleaning of the front yard and the laundry were not hers.\n“Why are you being so polite to me? With our relationship, don’t be so fussy. If you’re tired, I’ll do more. If you have time, you can do it.”\n“Thank you.” Li Xia thanked her sincerely, thinking about buying her a set of skin care products next time she goes to the mall.\nShe seemed to be very energetic when she was thinking about the pile of work, but now she feels that she is not fine for the time being and is yawning with sleepiness. She fell into a deep sleep after lying on the bed for a while, and she didn’t even know when her family came back.\nThe four people came back and saw that she was asleep, and they left quietly. They didn’t call her for dinner so that she could sleep well, and they left her food and hot water at night, but she didn’t wake up at all.\nThe next day, when she opened her eyes at dawn, she turned over and sat up. Shen Haiyang also woke up. “Are you awake? Are you hungry?”\nShe looked back, sleepy. “What time is it?”\nShen Haiyang took out his watch from under his pillow. “Six ten.”\n“Slept so good.”\n“It’s still early; why don’t you get some sleep?” She must not have gotten enough rest after rushing all the way to find a suitable manufacturer.\n“No, I’ve had enough sleep.”\nShe got up, washed her face, brushed my teeth, and put her hair up. Then I went to the construction site in the morning and found that the work was basically done, with only some finishing touches left.\n“Mr. Chen, how many days will it take for the delivery?”\n“One week, at most.”\n“Okay, I’ll find someone to inspect it in a week.”\n“Be assured that our projects will be of high quality.”\nThe factory was completed on schedule, and she had already paid the mid-term payment to the partner in the United States, and the goods would be shipped to China at the end of the month. A batch of small parts would be delivered next month, enough for 10,000 units. Then, normal production would resume, and the products would be put on the market after passing quality inspection.\nSoon, you will see the return of money. When the sales of TV sets start to explode, the money will roll in.\nFang Zhongcheng went to attend a birthday party for a colleague’s son, and when he came out, he thought of his son again. He rode his bike around Shen Haiyang’s house and saw his son playing with other kids. He didn’t throw stones or roll hoops today, but he was performing mental arithmetic for a few older kids.\nHe stood aside and listened quietly, and he found that his son could calculate the addition and subtraction of thousands of digits in an instant. How old is he? A child who has just started preschool has such strong calculation abilities.\nThen he started to do multiplication. He knew single-digit numbers by heart, and he could multiply double-digit numbers by single-digit numbers with just a flick of his fingers. It was as if he had an abacus between his fingers, and he could tell the answer immediately by tapping his fingers on his pants.\n“you win,”\nThe older kid gave the money to Yiyidejectedly, and the younger kid proudly said he was going to buy popsicles. A group of kids around his age followed him, buying popsicles for two cents each or five for ten cents.\n“Give one to my brother and sister, and share the remaining two.”\nAt such a young age, he won cheers and applause for himself. At this moment, he was like a child king, and everyone agreed with whatever he said.\n“You must get my son to me.”\nShen Ruyi was so harsh to his father and humiliated him in front of so many people. But his father just wanted to get him to his side. The little guy proved his strength with facts, making his father crazy about him and regretting him so much that he wanted to bang his head against the wall.\n",
    "71": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c44/\nCHAPTER 44\nFang Zhongcheng missed his son and hoped that Li Xia would go bankrupt soon. She had sold all the goods in her three shops and heard that her father-in-law was facing a huge funding gap. Her little money was not enough to fill such a big hole, and it was just a drop in the bucket waiting to be burned up.\nThere has been no further movement in the electronics factory until now. Whatâs the point of this woman insisting on building the factory? Without the core stuff, these are just broken bricks and tiles and are not worth much.\nEver since he saw the boy doing mental arithmetic, he began to pass by Shenâs house whenever he had time. He followed Shen Haiyang on the road and heard his son reciting ancient poems fluently, reciting quatrains and seven-character regulated verses without any stuttering.\nMy god, how can my son be so smart? What was wrong with him at the beginning? Otherwise, he would still be my son. Fang Zhongcheng, It doesnât matter. When Li Xia falls, my son will still be Fang Ruyi.\nThe father and son in front of him didnât notice him at all. Shen Haiyang had nothing to do during this trip, so he taught the child to recite poems every day. The boy had a really good memory, and he could basically recite it after being taught once or twice. Such a smart child brought infinite joy and a sense of accomplishment to the person who taught him. The family bought a lot of books on purpose, as if they were afraid that one day they would have nothing to teach after they finished teaching.\nâDad, have you been learning foreign languages with Grandpa recently? I heard you guys talking a lot.â\nâYes, I am learning foreign languages from your grandfather. Nowadays, students in junior high school learn English. You should learn it in the future, too.â\nâOh. Why do you want to learn to speak like a foreigner?â\nâBecause we want to keep pace with the world and become internationalized. To join the international community, language is the primary means of communication.â\nâThen why do we all learn English?â\nâBecause English is an international language, people from all countries learn English, and when we meet, we can communicate in English.â\nâWhy is English an international language? Canât Chinese be an international language?â\nâHaha, we donât have the final say on this.â\nâHmph, when I have the final say, Iâll make them all learn Chinese.â\nâSo youâre learning English now?â\nâYes.â\nAfter dinner in the evening, she discussed the current situation with the old man: âThe order for small parts was placed too late, and production may be delayed by three to five days.â\nâIt doesnât matter. Everything is ready. It doesnât matter if itâs a few days late.â\nThatâs what he said. But until the production line was installed and the TVs were produced and passed the quality inspection, she would always be worried.\nShe went out of the backyard at night, and she had no mood to watch TV. The moon was bright and clear, and she was alone in the yard looking up at the sky. In the quiet little yard, Huihua came out from behind and reached out to hold her hand.\nâMom, are you in trouble?â\nâItâs okay, just a few difficulties.â\nâWe have midterm exams coming up, and after that, weâll have summer vacation in two months.â\nBecause she has always controlled her temper well, her daughter has a much closer relationship with her in this life. Although she knows that she has been in trouble recently, she still dares to talk to her. As she spoke, she took out her piggy bank from the house and put it in her hand.\nâThe money we three saved is all here; Iâll give it to you.â Seeing that she didnât say anything, the girl added, âYiyi and brother Hui both agreed. Yiyi is very stingy with others, but he is willing to give it to mom.â\nâHaha,â she said, hugging her daughter in a good mood and kissing her on the forehead. She was too busy recently to ask her, but today she had some free time and started chatting with her.\nâNo one bullies you at school, right?â\nâNo, last time a female classmate asked me to borrow colored pencils, but I refused. She quarreled with me and wanted to fight, but my brother grabbed her arm. Haha, mom, my brother is so powerful. He just glared at her, and she ran away in fear.â\nâWhy donât you lend colored pencils to your female classmates?â Her daughter has always been very gentle, and she would not be stingy when it came to helping her classmates.\nâBecause sheâs annoying. She doesnât take good care of the things she borrows from others. Sheâs borrowed things from me many times, and she cuts off most of the eraser when she returns it to me. She dropped my colored pencil on the ground, and the lead inside was broken. I felt so sad when she was sharpening it, but she said it was no big deal. If itâs no big deal, then she should just buy it herself and stop borrowing from me all the time.â\nâOh I see.â\nâyes.â\nThe little girl kept telling her mother about the trivial things she encountered in life and study. Li Xia found that her daughter was much bolder than in her previous life and dared not refuse. In her previous life, she insisted on not getting married after breaking up with that man. She had basically no opinions from childhood to adulthood. She even took evasive measures when facing her urge to get married.\nâHave you run out of colored pencils? Mommy will buy you some tomorrow.â\nâNo , I still have a box that I havenât touched yet, so you donât have to buy it for me. I just donât like her wasting things. Yes, she only wastes other peopleâs things, but she is so distressed about her own things that she doesnât buy many of them and just waits to borrow them from others.â\nâWell, if you donât like it, donât play with her.â\nâMom, donât you think Iâm stingy?â\nâThatâs not being stingy. If you want to share your things with others, then do so. If you donât want to, thatâs your right.â\nâOh, Mom is so nice.â\nMy daughter is a caring little girl, and she shares her thoughts with her mother the most. Itâs great that her child is healthy, happy, lively, and independent. She can take care of herself, so even if she doesnât want to get married, I donât have to worry about her too much in the future.\nA few days later, the school had two days off after the midterm exam. Li Xia went out to do some work early in the morning, and the children were playing near the door of their home. At noon, Fang Zhongcheng and his wife came over. The man was holding a toy car in his hand, and he happily showed it to everyone.\nâThis is a toy dad bought for you. Itâs the latest model of car. This thing is only available overseas; you will definitely be the only one among all the kids.â\nWhat little boy doesnât like toys? He was immediately attracted by it. Fang Zhongcheng put the car in his hand, and he took it and stroked it carefully.\nâYou like it, donât you? If you like it, Dad will buy you another one next time. Why donât you come with Dad? Dad will take you to eat something delicious.â\nâTake it .â\nWithout hesitation, the car was put in his hands. The little guy turned hostile. He remembered that his mother didnât like him asking for Fang Zhongchengâs things. And he wanted to take him away, but he didnât want to follow him. With such an unreliable father, he could stay wherever he wanted.\nâMy mom will buy it for me; I donât want yours.â\nâYiyi , Iâm your father.â\nâMy father threw me out to get married.â\nâYou little brat,â Fang Zhongcheng was angry that his son spoke so sharply and didnât give him any face at all.\nâYou are already so old, and you donât understand anything? You just listen to what your mother says, and you treat Shen Haiyang as your real father all day long? Let me tell you, you are my blood, the son of Fang Zhongcheng.â\nâItâs you who donât want me anymore.â Yiyi shouted, âAnd donât talk about my mom all the time. My mom is the best momâa thousand times better than you. My dad is also better than you. Donât talk about them.â\nLi Xia parked the car, but before she opened the door, she heard her sonâs loud roar. The little guyâs face turned red because of the loud roar, and he looked at Fang Zhongcheng with his spines erected like a little animal. He was protecting his mother, not allowing him to say bad things about her, and even gave up his favorite car, choosing to protect his mother over his own interests.\nShe got out of the car and squatted in front of her son, and the little guy dived into her arms. He said nothing, but his gesture was full of attachment. Fang Zhongcheng was so angry that he spoke without thinking out of embarrassment.\nâNo matter what, we are father and son. Blood is thicker than water. How can you sow discord between us? As a motherâ¦â\nâDo I need to sow discord between you two?â Li Xia would not tolerate him. Before he could finish, she said, âYou bastard, you gave birth to a child but didnât raise it. You just wanted to remarry and shove your child into my hands without caring about anything. You still have the nerve to say that I was the one who sowed discord between you and your son? You are such an irresponsible person. You donât have money to buy a mirror. Why donât you take a piss and look at it?â\nâI,â\nFang Zhongcheng is not good at speaking. Every time Li Xia confronts him, he trembles all over; blood rushes to his head, but he canât speak. Thatâs because he does things irrationally. He has nothing to say if he wants to quibble, and he canât open his mouth if he wants to deny it.\nâLi Xia, stop throwing tantrums like a child. You canât protect yourself now, and youâre about to lose money. Letâs take Yiyi away, and weâll take good care of her. Yiyi is a smart child.â\nâIâm not following you.â\nYiyi poked his head out of his motherâs arms and yelled at Murong Danling fiercely. Shen Hui, who was standing by, raised his mouth with a sneer. His motherâs words were like a basin of cold water pouring over him from head to toe, making his heart feel like it was freezing.\nShen Haiyang reached out and held his sonâs hand. Shen Hui looked back at his father, his eyes gradually warming up. His smile became warmer, and he obediently went over and held Yi Yiâs hand.\nThis time, the five members of the family were on the same front, and Murong Danling had a smug smile on her face. In the eyes of others, the family was united, and the reconstituted family was more harmonious than the original one, which was enviable. But in her eyes, it became the last stubbornness of the Shen family, which was hit hard, and the Shen family was about to be in trouble.\nThe biggest and richest of the Shen family went bankrupt, and Li Xia wanted to save the situation without knowing how to do it. She sold the shop and built an empty factory. Even if she sold the factory in the future, how much money would she get? It would not be easy for her to buy back the shop. Without the shop, she would have to sell goods to make money, and small business is not as easy to do as before.\nAfter thinking about it, the couple came to the conclusion that the Shen family was doomed. Fang Zhongcheng wanted a son, and Murong Danling followed him for the sake of family stability. Yiyi , this child is indeed smart, so he can raise him if he wants, because she canât give birth to one herself. As for Shen Hui, itâs her son who has to be raised or not.\nâRaising a child is expensive. We will continue the mental arithmetic and piano lessons you signed up for, Yi Yi. This way, you can save some money and not be too strapped for cash.â\nLi Xia sneered and looked at her. âWhat kind of dream are you having? Do you want me to slap you to wake you up? Itâs just raising three children. We are not so strapped for cash.â\nWithout waiting for the couple to respond, she continued, âGo quickly; donât make yourself uncomfortable outside my house. You didnât want the child in the first place, so donât think about it now. I still say that he is not a kitten or a puppy that you can throw around as you please. You just heard that the child doesnât want to follow you at all. So, go quickly; take the main road.â\nâLi Xia, youâve sold your shop and borrowed money everywhere. If you canât find any so-called investments, you should sell the factory next. Donât be so stubborn. If you canât raise a child, donât try to be stubborn. You will harm the child. Let Yiyi follow us, and I will continue to enroll him in classes.â\nâI donât care,â Yiyi shouted at Fang Zhongcheng, reaching out to hold his motherâs hand. âIâll just follow my mother, as long as thereâs food to eat. No, if thereâs no food to eat, Iâll go beg for food, but Iâll just follow my mother.â\nAt this moment, Li Xiaâs eyes were moist. Her son thought she had not solved the problem, but he did not abandon her as a mother at this time. In her previous life, Fang Zhongcheng got money to support her, built a new house for her to improve her living environment, and stopped her from sending him tuition and living expenses. In this life, he yelled at Fang Zhongcheng fiercely to support her as a mother.\nâWhere did you hear that I should sell the factory after selling the shop?â After asking, seeing that Murong Danling was a little confused, she continued without waiting for her to answer: âGet out quickly. Whether I succeed or fail, these three will only follow the two of us. The children have nothing to do with you, so donât think about it anymore.â\nâLi Xia, you are really good at pretending. Donât regret it when you are poor.â\nâIt has nothing to do with you two. Now, immediately, leave here, and donât embarrass yourself and make the child uncomfortable.â\nAfter saying that, she did not wait for the other party to answer but stood up and opened the house door. The two adults led the three children home. They closed the house door and let the people outside talk about it, but they did not listen to it and did not get annoyed. They were too lazy to waste their words with two selfish and confused people.\nMom and Dad are the ones who have the confidence. The three children quickly calmed down their embarrassment when they got home. Li Xia and Shen Haiyang went into the house to clean up and prepare to wash clothes. The three children complained about the couple in Shen Huiâs room.\nâHmph, they still want to support me and take care of me in their old age? Thatâs wishful thinking. I donât want it. They want to bribe me with just a car? Am I so easy to bribe?â Yiyi raised his head proudly.\nâCome on, stop being so ungrateful. Sheâs my biological mother, and she didnât want me, but she wants you. Youâre so popular now.â\nIt seems that Shen Hui is bothered by this. He really canât understand how a biological mother can be like this. Li Xia treats the two children as if they were her life and is also responsible for her stepson, caring about all his problems. On the contrary, his biological mother treats him like an enemy and beats him. Later, she simply treats him as nothing and doesnât want him to be her biological son.\nâThen you are better than me, brother Hui.â He only has eyes for Yiyi , as if I am not his child. Forget it; we have a father and a mother; why miss them? Who knows what is in their heads; maybe it is different from normal people.â\nâBut I heard Uncle Han say last time that people like us who are blood relatives will have to provide for their care in the future when we grow up.â\nâWhat no!?â\nâRealyy?â\nThe three children couldnât accept it and couldnât imagine what logic this was. When parents abandon their children, do they still have to provide for them when they grow up? That would be so frustrating.\nâHow about we go and ask them for money? Mom is short on money right now. Weâll have to provide for their retirement in the future anyway, so why not ask for more money now? At least it will lighten the burden on Mom and Dad.â\nÂ \n",
    "72": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c44-2/\nAs expected of Shen Ruyi, who always takes a practical approach, he thought of asking for money so quickly after getting angry, which is the most practical thing to do. But the two people on the side obviously didnât think so, and their faces were distorted with confusion.\nâWhatâs wrong? Can they only ask us to support them in the future? But we canât ask them to give us money now.â\nShen Hui raised his hand and gently brushed his head. âYou little brat, all you care about is money, right?â\nâWhat else? If we donât ask for money now, wonât we lose out when we grow up? Mom and Dad will lose out too. They raised us, but we still have to support that irresponsible person. My mom is losing out too much; we have to ask for money.â\nâLetâs not do that.â\nHuihua was a gentle person, and when she thought about asking the two for money, she immediately wanted to back out. What if the two used this opportunity to ask one of the three of them to stay? She herself was definitely not willing to follow them, and she was reluctant to part with her elder brother and younger brother.\nâYes, I donât want their money.â Shen Hui was very stubborn. He was extremely disappointed with his mother and didnât want to look for her at all.\nâOh, how could you two be so stupid?â Yiyi jumped off the bed anxiously: âWhen they get old and canât work anymore and come to us, none of us three can run away. Isnât it stipulated by law? So we have to ask for money now; otherwise, the three of us will lose money in the future, and so will our parents.â\nâHumph, Iâll go far away so they canât find me. Letâs see how they let me support them.â\nShen Huiâs personality is really similar to Li Xiaâs. Li Xia would rather her son do this than what he did, so the mother and son quarreled like that in the previous life. But her son has such a personality. When he heard that he would have to support that person in the future, he immediately wanted to ask him for money. Otherwise, it would be too bad. As for feelings, there is no feeling here except calculation.\nâYes, letâs go far away and take our parents with us.â Huihua is really a caring little girl who never forgets her parents.\nWell, since his brother and sister couldnât be persuaded, Yiyi could only give up his plan. Anyway, his mother said that the problem of lack of money has been solved, so there is no need to look for money for the time being.\nIn the main room, Shen Haiyang asked with concern what was going on. âWe have placed an order for small parts at the factory in Zhongyuan. The equipment and components from the United States will arrive soon. The factory is preparing to recruit workers, and they need to be trained before they can start working.â\nâGo for it; Iâll be there for you whether you make a profit or a loss. If there are any more problems, we can just sell the house or the car.â\nâno,â\nLi Xia was at a loss for words for her husband. He was supporting her by selling his house and car. But it sounded so unimpressive. Why did he start by calculating what he would do if I lost money?\nâDonât worry, I wonât make you poor. Just wait for my good news.â\nâOkay, Iâll wait for you to make a lot of money.â\nThe couple took the sheets, pillowcases, and clothes outside to wash, chatting while washing. Seeing how relaxed they were, the three little ones also happily came out to play in the water.\nQin Mu was cooking in the kitchen. In addition to being responsible for the familyâs meals, she also took care of the old manâs daily life. She was also worried that Li Xiaâs business would fail; after all, the couple now followed her. Seeing how their family was today, it was estimated that there would be no problem.\nâAdd two dishes tonight: spinach with nuts and pork with garlic. Letâs celebrate.â\nÂ  Â  Â  \nÂ \nLi Xia paid the balance of the equipment and then waited for the manufacturer to deliver it to China for installation. By this time, the factory building had been completed, and she had kept 20% of the project payment.\nâI will definitely settle it next year.â\nâNo, youâre putting too much pressure on me.â\nâI havenât used the factory yet, so of course I have to put some pressure on it. Otherwise, who would I turn to if something went wrong?â\nâHow could there be any problem with our city construction project?â\nâMr. Chen, time is the only criterion for verification.â\nNo matter what, Li Xia withheld a part of the project payment. She didnât have enough money. A 1.8-meter-tall man was covered with a 1.6-meter-long quilt. If he pulled a little more, he would be embarrassed. She could only try to keep as little as possible so that she could have more money.\nIt was her first time opening a factory, so she was nervous and under great pressure. It was the first time she felt tired since her rebirth, and she felt heavy all over. She didnât say a word when she got home. She didnât hire an engineer, and he could only serve as a consultant. She didnât have any technicians at all, so she couldnât run the factory like this.\nShe has classes tonight and has to go to class after dinner. She lies on the bed and waits for dinner. Her body is resting, but her mind is still working, thinking about what to do next and how to make the most of the money in her hand.\nAfter thinking it over, she realized that the money was not enough. The equipment will arrive soon. She should recruit workers now, so she would have to pay them next month. There would have to be at least a few hundred workers, and the monthly salary alone would be a considerable amount.\nItâs okay; itâs okay; the investment is big, but the return is also big. Once the factory starts operating, the profit will be huge. With hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, she will have a bigger platform to display her talents.\nShe was very tired and fell asleep while thinking about something. She vaguely heard someone talking, and then someone went out. She wanted to open my eyes but closed them because she was too sleepy. Then she woke up, got out of bed, put on her shoes, and went to see what was going on.\nWhen she went out of the yard, she could vaguely hear voices coming from not far away, so she followed the sound and walked towards the place. When she arrived, she saw a group of children standing by a ditch. Her father-in-law picked up her son from inside, and Huihua and Shen Hui reached out to catch their brother.\nâMom,â Huihua saw her shouting, and she comforted the little guy: âYou guys take care of your brother first; Iâll help grandpa up.â\nâOkay.â\nShe helped the old man out of the canal, and both of them were covered with half of their calves in stinky water. The old man, who was so elegant, became embarrassed this time, and it was all her sonâs fault. She looked back at her son with a gloomy face, and the little guy quickly explained.\nâMom, it was Xiaopeng who pushed me down, and he ran away. Humph, when I get better, I will seek revenge on him.â\nâOkay, canât you just be a good boy? Itâs so nice to watch TV at home with your brother and sister instead of getting into trouble outside every day.â\nâDaughter-in-law,â the old man and Shen Haiyang spoke at almost the same speed, neither hurried nor slow, very gently. âChildren learn about the world through exploration and play. Yiyi has a cheerful personality, rich imagination, and strong hands-on ability. These are all the childâs strengths. As for any small accidents in the process, I have just told the child to pay attention to safety.â\nLi Xia took a deep breath and looked at her father-in-law, feeling sorry for causing him to go down the canal and getting his trouser legs covered in stinky mud. The old man smiled slightly and didnât care at all.\nâI will just go home and wash it.â\nYiyi looked at his mother and grandfather and guessed why his mother was like that. He smiled brightly at his grandfather. âThank you, Grandpa.â\nThe old man reached out and rubbed his head. âLet mom take you to the hospital. Be good on the way.â\nâOk, I know.â\nâDad, then youâ¦â\nAt this time, Qin Mu was passing by while buying groceries. After telling her about the situation, she helped the old man home, and Li Xia took her son to see a doctor. The little guy was held by his mother and kept silent. He also made his motherâs clothes full of stinky mud.\nShen Hui stood up and said, âMom, wait here for me. Iâll go home and ride the tricycle over.â\nâNo, you two watch Yi Yi; Iâll ride.â\nShe couldnât drive because she was so dirty, so she asked the children to wait here. She went home, changed her pants, and quickly rode the tricycle back. The three children sat on her back, and she rode to the hospital.\nThe boy was examined in the hospital and found that his joint was dislocated. The doctor moved his hands to reset it. Yiyi screamed in pain and then covered his mouth. Facing his motherâs distressed eyes, he grinned and said it didnât hurt.\nâIt doesnât hurt anymore.â\nLi Xia touched the childâs head distressedly and said, âIâll make you something delicious when I get home.â\nWhen they came out of the clinic, Li Xia was still carrying him on her back, with the two older children in front. He whispered to his mother on her back. âI caused Grandpa to fall into the canal. Mom didnât want Grandpa to be angry with me, so she scolded me, right?â\nâYes.â She never said these things to her children in her previous life, but in this life she pays great attention to communicating with her children. She should let her children know that she loves them. âYou are my biological child, so you donât have to care about what your mother says about you in front of others. But you must remember what your parents say to you behind your back.â\nâI understand. Grandpa is actually very good to me. He treats us like brother Hui.â\nâGrandpa is just like dad; both are generous and forgiving people. But our relationship with Grandpa is not at that level yet, so sometimes we still have to be careful. When time goes by and our relationship deepens, we wonât have to worry about any minor frictions.â\nâOh. I will be nice to Grandpa in the future, even better than my biological Grandpa. After a long time, we will be close, just like dad and I.â\nWhat a naughty boy! Li Xia smiled and asked something else. âAre you familiar with the kid who was playing with you?â\nâYeah. His father is paralyzed, and they live with their grandmother.â\nReally, itâs so similar to what Shen Hui did before. Li Xia didnât plan to go to the door to ask for an explanation. The child didnât play on purpose. The family was so pitiful, she just had to accept the fact that she spent money on the brat.\nâMom,â Shen Hui was about to say that he would carry Yiyi on his back for a while when he suddenly saw his familyâs car coming towards them. âDad is here to pick us up.â\nNot far from the hospital, Shen Haiyang drove over. He listened to what the child said on the way but did not criticize him. Yiyi was the most mischievous of the three children. Li Xia said that he seemed to become more stable after entering high school.\nâBe careful; luckily, no bones were broken. Choose a safe place when you play.â\nâGot it. Dad, where did you go this weekend?â\nâThereâs something I need to work overtime to solve.â\nâoh.â\nChildren donât understand adult matters, so they donât ask any more questions. The brat was locked in the room when he got home and was not allowed to come out. His brother and sister strictly followed their motherâs orders. He was locked up and couldnât go out. He sighed when he looked at his feet.\nâIâll be more careful next time.â\nKnowing what the little boy feared the most, Li Xia immediately controlled his vital point. He could have gotten out of bed in three days, but he was kept in bed for a week. The little boy would learn a lesson much more easily if he was scolded. In the future, he can play around, but he must remember to pay attention to safety. He would act like a spoiled child when he saw his mother, wanting her to spend more time with him.\nâHave you memorized all the poems your father taught you?â\nâIâve memorized them all. Mom, can I go out and play tomorrow?â\nâOkay.â\nâOh yeah, Iâm finally free.â\nAfter being liberated, Li Xia was still busy. Her father and his team were originally going to return home after the project was completed, but when he heard that she was looking for workers, his eldest brother immediately had an idea.\nâWhat are the conditions? How high a level of education is required?â\nâYes, at least you have to graduate from junior high school. And you have to receive training after you come here; otherwise, you wonât be able to take up the job.â\nâYou have to be younger, right?â\nâBrother, do you want to work in the factory?â\nâNo. I want your nephew to do this.â\nHer eldest brotherâs eldest son is 20 years old this year and is also working on the construction site. This kid is a hard worker and not a troublemaker. It is not impossible for him to stay in the factory now. He can be competent for the work on the assembly line after training.\nâOkay.â Before her brother could finish his joy, she continued, âHe canât mention his relationship with me in the factory. I treat all the workers equally. He should do what he is capable of. I wonât give him any backdoors. I wonât take care of him if he lives in the dormitory.â\nâOf course. He is your nephew, so even if he canât help, he wonât cause you any trouble. Big brother knows that this is the Shen familyâs business, so he wonât make things difficult for you.â\nâWell, then let Xuedong stay and sign up when the factory starts recruiting.â\nâOK.â\nâThird brother, you should stay and learn how to drive, and help me with transportation in the future.â\nâIsnât it going to cause you any trouble?â\nâNo, I also need someone I can rely on to do things around me.â\nâOkay, Iâll go and learn, and Iâll work hard for you in the future.â\nFinding workers for the assembly line is not a problem, but Li Xia is worried about technicians. The old man signed a cooperation agreement with a foreign manufacturer. In addition to the production line, most of the core parts were also provided by them. They will come to provide technical guidance for the installation.\nBut they canât stay for long, and once production starts, technicians are a must. At this time in China, college students and technicians have iron rice bowls that cannot be easily pried away.\nâIf we recruit technicians, the salary will be three times that of ordinary workers. If they are at the engineer level, the salary will be more than ten times that.â\nA big reward will always attract a brave man. Now this is the only way to recruit technicians. After the product is launched, she plans to set up a research and development department to develop her own products. If she canât make a complex one, she will make a relatively simple one. The next 20 years will be the golden age of home appliances.\nThe factory recruited workers, and the general workers required half men and half women, aged between 20 and 35. There was no age requirement for technical jobs, and the conditions were very generous.\nThere was no movement for the skilled workers, but the general workers were fully recruited in three days. They were notified to come for training in two days, and the training teacher was hired by Li Xia from night school, majoring in mechanical engineering. Anyway, they were both earning extra money, so they were happy to earn an extra job.\nâWhy donât you consider working for me?â Li Xia took the opportunity to win people over.\nâItâs okay to make extra money, but itâs not okay to give up your stable job.â The man paused and shook his head. âThatâs not okay.â\nLi Xia was helpless, as they were all reluctant to give up their stable jobs. In the afternoon, she was training workers and saw a familiar figure in the crowd: Fang Zhongchenggâs second brotherâs wife.\nAfter a closer look, it was really her. This person should not be unaware of whose factory this was. Why did she come to her factory? Could she be a spy planted by Fang Zhongcheng and his wife?\nNo matter what, she couldnât keep the woman in her factory in such a relationship. She immediately called Xiao Liu, the person in charge, and said, âFire that woman.â\nXiao Liu had been working with Li Xia since she started selling clothes, so she nodded without asking any questions. Fang Laoerâs wife was fired just after she successfully signed up, and she kept asking why.\nâYour hands are not up to standard.â Xiao Liu made an excuse.\nâMy hands are not up to standard. Why are my hands not up to standard?â\nâYour little finger is too long, which affects your work on the assembly line.â She waved her hands and said, âOkay, okay, itâs only the first day, and we havenât lost anything. You can just find another one.â\nXiao Liu left, and she stamped her feet on the ground in anger. Murong Danling asked her to find out about Li Xiaâs situation, and she also wanted to make money. The two of them hit it off, but how come she was chased away as soon as she came in?\nâIt must be Li Xia. She refused to rent the house to us, and now sheâs ruining my job.â\nAre you sure they want to destroy your job? This job belongs to someone else. They might give it to you, but knowing the relationship between your two families, how can they give it to you? You have bad intentions, but you are blaming others.\nâSister Xia,â Xiao Liu still habitually called her sister, âare the salaries of technical staff really that high?â\nâYes. Why did someone come to sign up?â\nâHere comes one. He said he used to work on the assembly line in a state-owned factory.â\nâOh. Let the teacher we hired interview him later, and if he is okay, he can stay.â\nR&D needs more high-end talents, but workshop production also needs ordinary technicians. If we canât recruit high-end ones, itâs okay to recruit a few ordinary ones.\nThe workers were trained for half a month, during which time four ordinary technicians were recruited. The production line and the first batch of electrical components from the United States also arrived, and the factory immediately began installation in full swing.\nThe two technicians from the United States did not understand Chinese, so language communication was difficult for a while. It was only after Li Xia hired a translator teacher who trained the workers to act as interpreters that the work went smoothly.\nThe factory was led by technicians to install the production line, and she became busy day by day. She ran around the factory and other places during the day and went home at night to the backyard to chat with the old man. In fact, she was asking for advice.\nThe more she listened to the old man, the more she realized how poor she was. Although she had a second life, her knowledge and experience basically came from TV and word of mouth, and she had no idea about the insights and details of the story.\nWhat you learn from books is always superficial. One must practice it oneself to truly understand it.\nâWe must focus on quality and taxation, and we must not play tricks on them. Quality determines the life or death of a factory, and taxation determines whether a factory has a future.â\nâI know that quality is important. If the quality is not up to standard, the company will soon go bankrupt. But as for taxation, many people in this eraâ¦ I will strictly control the taxation and will not cheat or slack off.â\nNo matter how much she lost in taxes, she couldnât think of this loophole, no matter how tight her money was. The old man looked at her with a teachable look, and the father-in-law and daughter-in-law were more like teacher and student together.\n",
    "73": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c45/\nCHAPTER 45\nDays passed, and the weather was getting hotter. The children had their summer vacation after their exams. This was supposed to be the longest time for them to go out and play, but this year, Li Xia was so busy that she couldn’t take care of it.\n“Mom, our classmate said that his parents took him to Beijing to watch the flag-raising ceremony during the summer vacation.”\nYiyi will be going to primary school in the second half of the year. He will be one year ahead of the other children. She heard from Shen Haiyang that their teacher gave him a test and suggested that he should skip a grade. They discussed it and asked Yiyi for his opinion. Finally, they decided to let nature take its course and let the child make his own decision during the process of going to school.\nHe was admitted to a key university in his previous life; how could he reach this level in this life? Looking at the boy’s current performance, these are actually not big deals. He studies like playing now, and Li Xia focuses on letting him practice the piano. Study is the main job, and the other jobs are side jobs. The more talents a child has, the more confident he will be.\n“So, you want to go too?”\n“I asked my dad, but he said he was too busy this year and didn’t have time.”\n“Then why are you saying this?”\nThe little guy stamped his feet anxiously: “Oh, I just reminded you that you didn’t take us to play this time.”\n“Then what?”\n“What then? I mean, you guys are all busy this year, and you won’t go out during the summer vacation, so can we go out and play during the National Day or winter vacation?”\n“What if we still don’t have time?”\nYiyi was almost discouraged. “Then… well, I might as well wait until I grow up and go by myself.”\n“You will be going alone?”\n“I will take my parents and my older brother and sister.” Facing his mother’s approving gaze, he smiled proudly: “I am learning foreign languages from my grandfather, and I will take my mother abroad to travel in the future. Grandpa said that Hawaii, in the United States, has beautiful natural scenery and many islands. There is also Yellowstone Park, which is a magical paradise. There are also Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which are both world-class universities that gather outstanding teachers and students from all over the world.”\n“Okay, Mom will wait for you to take us abroad. Then you have to learn foreign languages well; otherwise, we won’t know how to ask for directions when we get lost abroad. And you have to be able to speak, recognize, and write when ordering food in a restaurant and reading road signs. If you want to go to college in the United States, you have to be proficient in foreign languages, not just half-baked. Otherwise, you won’t understand what the teacher is saying.”\n“Well, I will try my best.”\nAfter talking with her son, she found that he had become much more sensible during the summer vacation. He doesn’t cause any trouble when he goes out to play. He learned foreign languages with his grandfather every day and started writing words. He doesn’t need his sister to urge him to practice the piano. He practices on time every day.\nThe three children arranged their own time, while Li Xia was busy with factory affairs. Qin Mu was taking care of her father-in-law, who was ill, and she did not hear him coughing when she returned home in the afternoon.\nAs soon as the couple entered the backyard, they saw flowers blooming all over the windowsill. Purple, yellow, pink, and a pot of green. The flowers in full bloom were arranged in an orderly manner, and the water lilies in the large pot were also blooming. There was a kind of quiet beauty, and the colorful flowers were very beautiful.\nLi Xia was attracted by the beautiful flowers and couldn’t help but slow down her pace. Shen Haiyang entered the room and lifted the door curtain; only then did he find that she had stopped in front of the rare green platycodon.\nHe lowered the door curtain and walked towards her. “Like this?”\nLi Xia nodded and reached out to gently touch the flowers. “I was so busy every day that I didn’t pay attention to anything else except work. I almost missed such a beautiful flower blooming next to me.”\nShen Haiyang held her shoulders and asked her to sit down on the stone bench: “Then sit down today and take a good look at these flowers.”\nSeeing him get up and walk out, she asked, “Where are you going?”\n“Make a pot of tea and sit quietly for a while.”\nThe children went out to play, and the courtyard was quiet and warm in the afternoon. They had a few cups of light tea and sat leisurely to enjoy the flowers. The old man came out of the house happily and sat in the shade. He drank it in one gulp and thought it was too light.\n“It would be so perfect to have a drink. Haiyang, go get a bottle of wine.”\n“No.” Li Xia immediately stopped him. “You just recovered from a cold; you can’t drink.”\n“Wine has the effect of softening blood vessels. Drinking a small amount is good for your health.”\n“The doctor said you can’t drink.”\nLi Xia didn’t know what kind of wine had what effect; she just remembered that the doctor said that they had better not drink. She was worried if they drank a little bit during the New Year and other festivals, so it was better not to drink on ordinary days.\nShe was afraid that Shen Haiyang would go get the wine, so she stood up anxiously, ready to stop him. The father and son looked at each other and laughed when they saw how nervous she was. It was a great happiness in life to be strictly controlled by a daughter-in-law.\n“Okay, I won’t drink it. But, Xia, can you make me some chestnut cake? The one you make tastes great, and no one else can make it as good as you.”\n“Okay, no problem. I’ll go get some chestnuts.”\n“Don’t worry, you can do it when you are free.”\n“I’m free now. I’ve already enjoyed the flowers and tasted tea, so it’s a good time to exercise.”\n( These are the ancient Chinese chestnut cakes )\n \nQin Mu cooked dinner, and she bought chestnuts to make chestnut cakes. The two women chatted while cooking in the house, and in the backyard, the father and son set up the chessboard. They looked kind and calm on the surface, but the battle on the chessboard was fierce.\nFor supper, the old man ate the chestnut cake made by his daughter-in-law and looked at the flowers on the windowsill with a smile. Originally, they planned to install a boiler to heat the front and back yards this year. If everything goes well at the factory, it will be in time.\nThe factory, his retirement, and his son’s illness. He was most worried about his son. The factory had seen hope, and he could overcome the bumps. He was old and felt at ease returning to his hometown. But his son’s illness could not be further treated, and he would not be able to close his eyes when he died.\nOn Li Xia’s side, the high salary did not attract fresh graduates. Instead, during the period when the factory was busy installing machines and training employees, it attracted two middle-aged people. Middle-aged people have great pressure with elderly parents and young children to take care of, and Li Xia thought this was the reason for the job hopping.\n“I was fired for having too many children.” The 36-year-old Fang Long was helpless when he spoke. He was not afraid of being laughed at. Anyway, this was the fact. His parents at home were urging him to have a grandchild. He would rather give up his job in exchange for his parents’ peace of mind. He really couldn’t stand it anymore.\n“My son doesn’t speak and has intellectual disabilities. I want to earn more money to go abroad to see a doctor for him.”\nThe 37-year-old Xu Weidong was also forced to do so by life, for the same reason Li Xia guessed. Both of them were experienced mechanical technicians, and her R&D department took shape immediately.\nThese two were arranged to accompany the two foreign engineers, and they must make sure to smooth out the entire production process. As the weather was getting hotter, the production line was installed, the first batch of parts from abroad arrived, and the parts she ordered domestically also arrived, and the factory officially started production.\nThe factory has also completed its training and recruited workers. Under the leadership of the technicians, the factory has started production in full swing. The first TV set comes off the production line and is tested by the technicians.\nAt such a critical moment, this historic moment, the old man also came to the factory. Li Xia’s palms were wet with nervousness, and beads of sweat could be seen on her forehead.\nThe old man turned around and comforted her softly: “Don’t be nervous; the original factory technicians are here; there should be no problem. I discussed it with them at the beginning, and they also thought this plan was feasible.”\nMost of the parts are from the original production line manufacturers, and only a few low-end ones are produced on the mainland. Although several technicians think there should be no problem, she can’t let go of her worries until the product is absolutely qualified.\nAs the power was turned on, the technician pressed the TV power button. The expected screen did not light up, and there was not even a sound. The inspection room was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Everyone was staring at the TV that had just come off the production line, and Li Xia even wanted to go up and tap it because she did this in her previous life when her neighbor’s TV stopped working.\n“what happened?”\n“Let me see.”\nThe technician came forward to check the situation, and the old man bent over nervously and tiredly. Han Jun was very considerate and brought a chair to help the old man sit down. The technicians who didn’t understand the technology waited nervously for the technician’s conclusion.\nThe waiting time is always so slow; the time ticks by every second. From 4 p.m. until the lights were turned on in the house, several technicians dismantled the TV to pieces but still could not find what was wrong.\n“What’s the situation?”\nThe technician she hired turned around and said, “I don’t know. I checked, and everything was fine, but why is it not working?”\nThe product situation was unclear, and Li Xia was extremely anxious. She got up and walked around the house twice and suddenly found that the old man looked bad, so she quickly sent him home. She gave him some medicine on the way, and she comforted him while driving.\n“Everything is difficult at the beginning, so don’t worry too much. After all, this production line has been relocated, and some parts are made in China, so we have to give them some time to adjust.”\n“I’m fine.” The old man sighed. “This body is really a burden. I’m old and don’t expect anything. I hope a treatment method can be developed quickly. Haiyang is still young.”\n“Rest more and don’t worry. It’s okay. Leave the factory to me from now on.”\n“Okay, I’m counting on you.”\n",
    "74": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c45-2/\nAfter sending the old man home to rest, Qin Mu prepared dinner. She was so upset that she had no appetite at all. She ate a bite, put down her chopsticks, and left.\nThe technicians in the factory also ate a bite of food and continued to tinker with the TV. The production line had stopped, and they couldn’t continue working because they couldn’t find the problem.\nLi Xia sat in the laboratory until after 1 a.m., then she was too sleepy to sleep and lay down on a chair for a while. The next morning, the problem was still not found. Several technicians were yawning from exhaustion, so she waved her hand and asked them to go back and rest.\nHan Jun got up from the table. He also didn’t get much sleep the whole night. “What should we do now?”\n“Keep looking; you never know what the problem is. The smaller the problem, the harder it is to find, but once you find it, it’s easy to fix.”\n“I find that sometimes you like to prepare for the worst, and sometimes you are quite optimistic.”\n“When something happens, you have to think about the worst so that you can deal with it adequately. Things are already on the edge of a cliff, and if you take a step back, you will be crushed to pieces. I can only think positively; otherwise, I will be crushed to death.”\nLi Xia stood up and stretched. “Okay, you look after the workshop. I’ll go to the office to take a nap. We’ll continue to wait for the results in the afternoon.”\nThere were problems with production, so she and Han Jun stayed in the factory and didn’t go home. Just as she was about to set up her bed in the office, Shen Haiyang knocked on the door and came in. It was the weekend, and he didn’t work, so he came to look for her because he didn’t wait for her all night.\n“Why are you here? Didn’t you say that you ran into some trouble and might not go home? Why are you still worried?” Li Xia asked him to sit down on the chair and turned to pour him a glass of water.\n“Anyway, I have nothing to do today, so I came to take a look. The three kids wanted to come, but I stopped them.”\n“Don’t let them come, especially Shen Ruyi.”\n“Yiyi has been very well behaved recently.”\n“I just think he’s noisy.”\n“You didn’t sleep last night; are you planning to take a nap?”\n“Um.”\n“Then go to sleep and stop talking.”\n“And you?”\n“I’ll read a book here.”\n“Okay, whatever you want.”\nOne of the couples sat quietly reading a book, while the other fell asleep quickly on the simple bed. After resting for about an hour, they heard someone break in.\n“Boss, we found the reason.” Han Jun shouted loudly, and his roar could be heard within a radius of hundreds of meters.\n“Hush, keep your voice down. She just fell asleep.”\n“Oh. Man…”\n“Have you found the cause? Are you sure?”\nLi Xia had already stood up, and Han Jun quickly turned back to report the situation to her. “It’s confirmed. The sample has produced images and sounds, and everything is normal. It’s playing a Hong Kong movie now. The image and sound are clear. You’ll know when you go over and take a look.”\n“Let’s go.”\nThe two of them walked out of the door one after the other. Li Xia was so excited that she forgot her husband in the office and talked to her friend as they walked. “What was the problem?”\n“Solder paste. There was no image or sound before, so we kept looking for it in the circuits and parts. Fang Long suddenly thought of this after leaving the inspection room and then went to the warehouse to look for solder paste again. This time, the image and sound appeared immediately after it was re-fixed.”\n“Isn’t this solder paste from a batch?”\n“It was given to us all at once, but the production date was not for a batch.”\nThis thing was ordered from China. I don’t know if it’s a quality issue or a date issue. Anyway, it’s good to find the cause. As for this thing, if it doesn’t work, find a suitable manufacturer.\n“Director, look, our TV is so good.”\nThe 14-inch black-and-white TV was playing The Legend of the Condor Heroes. Brother Jing’s honest eyes were clear and distinct, and the Mandarin version of the voice-over coming from the TV made Li Xia want to cry with such familiarity.\nShe really assembled all these bits and pieces, and the televisions coming off her production line are no different from those displayed in department stores. After passing quality inspection, they can enter the market.\n“Director, let’s start production next, shall we?”\n“Production, notify the workers to start work.”\nThe quiet factory was bustling with activity. Workers took their positions, and the production line started to operate. Li Xia went home and told the old man the good news. The old man relaxed and rocked back and forth in his rocking chair.\n“Let’s make something delicious tonight to celebrate. The kids are worried about you not being home these few days.”\n“Okay, let’s make something delicious to celebrate.”\n————\n“I have money now. I have money now.”\nAt night, she was humming happily, and Shen Haiyang discussed it with her. “Wife, the two technicians have returned to China. If the sales go well, shall we take the elderly and children out to play on the 11th?”\nLi Xia nodded when she heard it. “Where are we going? Do you have a destination?”\n“Suzhou and Hangzhou. Huihua said last time that she saw a proverb in her textbook that there is heaven above and Suzhou and Hangzhou below, and she longed for these two places.”\n“Okay, let’s make a travel plan in advance and take the kids out to have some fun. The old man has gotten much better these days, and he said he wanted to go to Hanshan Temple. Is it far?”\n“Hanshan Temple is in Suzhou. Let’s take them there.”\n“Okay, the factory is going to hold a sales meeting soon; let me see if it goes well. If it does, we’ll go.”\nThe product was sent to the national unit for quality inspection. Han Jun ran around and got the certificate of quality inspection in the shortest time. With this, the product can be put on the market, and he immediately invited distributors. If you like it, you can place an order, and you can come to pick it up when it is due, or the factory will deliver it.\nLi Xia attends night school on weekends and works in the factory during the day. The product passes a quality inspection, and a sales meeting is held a week later. Han Jun prepares the venue, and Li Xia asks if she should treat these people to a meal.\nSales became very difficult after the 1990s. If you didn’t drink until you vomited blood at the table, you couldn’t get any orders. She heard all this from others, and she wasn’t sure what the situation was now.\n“Why treat them to a meal? Just use the factory cafeteria for meals. Our products are in great demand right now, and all the buyers are saying good things about them.”\n“Really? Well, you’ve had a great time. In a few years, when the product is saturated, you’ll have to beg them to place an order.”\n“So I have to build a good relationship with them; it will be useful in the future.”\n“Well, buy them a drink, and the factory will reimburse them.”\n“That would be great.”\nThe sales meeting was held on the afternoon of the 16th. After looking at the products and quality inspection reports, a group of people began to rush to place orders. In the end, Li Xia held the pile of orders and smiled silently.\nThe production line is fully operational, and these orders must be completed within half a year. Each buyer only took a few units, and the order of taking the rest will be determined by the amount of deposit paid.\nThe order she had signed with the foreign factory was for 60,000 units, and she had already ordered more than half of it. Next, Xiao Liu would oversee production, while Fang Long would lead a team to set up a research and development department to research small household appliances.\nAs soon as the money came in, she was ready to spend it. The R&D department had to invest a lot. But her face was full of smiles, and her eyes were full of hope.\nLi Xia had a clear goal: to develop small household appliances independently. From the late 1980s to the 1990s, large household appliances were basically Japanese-funded. It was impossible for her to break through the technology of a color TV, refrigerator, air conditioner, etc. in a short period of time. She was not happy to let foreign capital control the company. It was better to develop small household appliances that people had great demand for.\nWhen she went back to the office from the factory, she ran into her third brother outside. The third brother was carrying goods with the workers. The man learned to drive and did this job in the factory. He was responsible and strong, so Li Xia didn’t have to worry about this. The brother and sister ran into each other, and the third brother put down the goods and stood there talking to his sister.\n“Are you used to living in the dormitory?”\n“Very good.” The third brother smiled naively and wiped the sweat off his face with his sleeve. “I’m so happy for you. I was so worried about you before that I couldn’t sleep. I wanted to ask you about it but was afraid of causing trouble for you. Now it seems that everything is fine, right?”\n“It’s going well. Find a chance to come home for dinner. Your brother-in-law was talking about treating you guys.”\n“Okay, let’s get together this weekend.”\nLi Xia smiled and nodded. The brother and sister chatted for a while before the third brother pushed the cart to work. She walked back to the office and asked someone to discuss the situation of solder paste. In the afternoon, she looked at the material report again.\nThe children knew that their mother had overcome the difficulties and that the product was selling well. At dinner, the children happily clinked their Coke glasses. Li Xia’s cheeks were also flushed with excitement. She thought that what she might have been able to do in the 1990s was actually accomplished now.\nNo matter how much foreign debt she borrowed, no matter that this product is now basically imported, the fact is that she opened the factory in the 1980s.\n“Mom, are you going to be a boss?” Huihua heard the latest term and thought her mother would be suitable too.\n“Mom, did you really make a TV? It’s as high-tech as the one we have. Some of our neighbors don’t even buy them. How come you made it?” Shen Hui’s focus was different from his sister’s. He was not shocked by the opening of the factory, but by the factory’s products.\n“Mom is so awesome; she’s the big boss.” Yiyi danced with joy, taking the results very seriously.\nLi Xia smiled and said truthfully, “Your grandfather owns the factory, and your mother is just managing it on his behalf. We don’t produce the televisions ourselves; we just assemble them now. But we can put our own brand on it, and we will definitely be able to produce our own products in the future.”\n“That’s amazing too.”\n“Mom is the best.”\nThe children were all full of pride and honor, and the old man also picked up his teacup and drank tea instead of wine. “Daughter-in-law, let me toast you. If it weren’t for you, this factory would be gone, and my life’s hard work would have gone to waste.”\nAs a junior, Li Xia stood up and clinked glasses with her father-in-law. “I’m the lucky one to have you.”\nThe two drank it all in one gulp, and the old man shook his head and said, “Don’t belittle yourself. You have courage and determination; otherwise, you can’t do this.”\nLi Xia smiled but said nothing, her heart filled with satisfaction. The sense of urgency she had felt since her rebirth had faded. She now had a successful factory, and her family was by her side. Shen Haiyang was very supportive of her, and he took care of the children while she was busy with work. This allowed her to not have to deal with everything and adjust herself in time. Although she was busy, she did not feel as exhausted as she did in her previous life.\n",
    "75": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c46/\nCHAPTER 46\nThe factory has been formalized, and she plans to go on a trip during the National Day holiday. The factory is busy. She canât leave her father-in-law alone at home during the New Year, so she takes time to go home and see her parents.\nWhile the production and sales in the factory were settled, she went to the department store to buy a lot of things and prepared to go back to her hometown. Every time she was told that everything was fine and she didnât need to worry about her family, this time she had time to go back and visit.\nShe didnât ask Shen Haiyang to take a leave, and she drove the car to load a lot of things to go back to see her parents. The road conditions today were not as good as in the future, so she didnât drive too fast.\nThe car drove all the way to the commune, along the dirt road in the village, and directly to the gate. The car caused a sensation as soon as it entered the village. When her mother heard her return from inside the house, she got off the kang excitedly and went out, hugged her, and looked her up and down. She looked as if she had returned from some dangerous place, and her eyes were full of worry and concern. Besides, it was better to see it with your own eyes than to say that everything was fine.\nâMom, Iâm fine.â\nâwell.â\nâLet the children come in and talk.â\nShe went into the house with her parents and sat on the kang, talking about the separation. The old lady was so angry that she scolded Fang Zhongcheng again, and she was very glad that she had found a good man who could accommodate her two children.\nâYou should also be nice to his child too.â\nâI know.â\nAs she was talking, her brother and sister-in-law all came over after hearing that she was back. The eldest sister-in-law brought a basket of eggs and a rooster, and the third sister-in-law brought a large bottle of sesame oil ground from her own sesame seeds, as well as her own soy sauce and rice vinegar.\nâYou saved so many eggs?â The old lady took them and put them aside. She was very satisfied with her two daughters-in-law. She got so many things from her daughters-in-law. Now she knows how to give and take. The value of things is not important; itâs about personal ability. The key is to have this heart.\nâYes. You should give my sister-in-law more eggs these days, and give her some more when she leaves. My chickens lay eggs very quickly, so save some for her these days. Iâll have my dad kill the rooster and stew it for my sister-in-law.â\nThe family members were chatting about family affairs. When talking about the second brother and his wife, Li Xia didnât say anything about the second sister-in-law, but just said that the breakfast shop was very good. She heard that there are many small shops opened by private individuals in the city now, and the third sister-in-law sighed with regret.\nâMy two children are both in school, and I canât leave. How about I work in your factory and settle down in the city with your third brother? That would be great. Or I can open my own tailor shop, which is definitely better than staying in the village.â\nThe second couple had already left their children to their parents, so they couldnât do the same. The old people were too old to have so many children.\nâDonât worry. When the children are older and live in the school dormitory, you can give the land to your elder brother and his wife to farm, and you two can move to the city. This way, your elder brother and his wife will earn more, and you can earn well in the city.â\nâThat would be great.â\nThe two sisters-in-law were all happy. This was a mutually beneficial thing. Her eldest brother and his wife were too old to work outside. They could earn a good income by farming the land for more than a dozen people. Their son was still working in the city. The other two families moved to the city and would settle down there.\nThe old lady said, âHave you discussed this with son-in-law? Donât act on your own and make him unhappy. The family can have enough food and is not cold now, so you donât need to worry about supporting them.â\nâItâs okay. I asked because I have the ability to do so. Besides, my third brother is very good at his job. He can take care of the transportation, so I donât have to worry about it anymore.â\nâWell, thatâs fine.â\nShe shared the things she brought back with everyone, and her two sisters-in-law thanked her with a smile. She stayed at home with her parents for two days, and when she left, they gave her more things than when she came back. She smiled helplessly and said that the car couldnât fit them all.\nâThird sister-in-law, wonât the chickens and ducks suffocate if they are tied up like this and put in the bag? Why donât you let them out?â\nâDonât. Theyâll poop on the road, and I donât want you to dirty the car. Just keep them in the bag. Donât worry, they wonât suffocate. This bag is breathable.â\nâOkay. Iâm leaving now. Please take care of my parents. Iâll come back when I have time.â\nThe third sister-in-law replied, âDonât worry about it; we will take care of your parents.â\nThe eldest sister-in-law smiled and said, âThese are all trivial matters. You donât need to worry about them. Just do your own thing. Donât worry if you have time to come back or not. I will take care of your parents. When you all move to the city in the future, I will be there for your parents. Donât worry.â\nFamily membersâ thoughts, she really couldnât refuse. In the end, the car was packed full, the trunk was definitely full, and the back seat was filled with various boxes and bags.\nShe didnât dare to drive too fast. There were not only a lot of chicken and duck eggs in the car, but also various sauces that her two sisters-in-law gave her, all in porcelain jars. However, they were separated by straw to prevent collisions. When she got home, everything was fine, and there was no problem of anything being broken or spilled.\nâOh my god, why are there so many things? You looked like you were going to stock up on goods when you went back home this time.â Qin Mu helped her move things and reached out to pick up a bag, but it turned out to be so heavy that she simply carried it on her shoulders. âWhatâs in here? Itâs so heavy.â\nâMillet. That bag is flour. There are also sweet potatoes and yams.â Li Xia smiled, feeling warmed by the love of her family. In the past few years, they didnât have enough food, but food is still precious these days. If you are not the closest relatives, who would be willing to give you so much of their own food? They are afraid that you canât buy good food, and they think it is expensive, so it is better to give it to you from home so that you donât have to spend money.\nâThere are so many eggs. The big ones must be duck eggs. Letâs salt them into salted eggs; otherwise, we wonât be able to finish them all.â\nâOkay. There are also various beans, corn grits, and so on. You can see how to cook them.â\nâIâll soak the red beans and make bean curd dumplings tomorrow, and weâll make corn and sorghum porridge tonight.â\nâOK.â\nThe two of them packed up their things, and soon the three children came back. Yiyi jumped on his mother as soon as he entered the door. He was the youngest in the family and seemed to have never grown up.\nIn his previous life, Li Xia had a bad temper and was naughty, so he kept his distance from his mother after being beaten. Now he acts like a spoiled child whenever he sees his mother, and he always thinks he is a little kid.\nâMom, we are on holiday. Shall we leave for Suzhou tomorrow?â\nâWeâll be gone for several days, so finish your homework first.â\nâokay.â\nâDo you have a lot of homework?â\nâNot much. I got full marks on the test, and the teacher said, Just write one word.â\nThe brat made his sister so angry as soon as he opened his mouth. Among the three children, Shen Hui and Yiyi were both top students in their grades and had very little homework. Only she had a lot of homework, and she couldnât finish it even if she didnât go play.\nâSister, whatâs wrong with you?â\nHuihua ignored him and went back to the room angrily, with Yiyi calling her from behind. Li Xia patted him and whispered to him, âHelp your sister with the oral arithmetic questions.â\nâokay.â\nLi Xia looked up at Shen Hui, and the boy smiled and nodded at her. âIâll help her write the new characters and words.â\nâGood boy.â\nHer elder brother and younger brother helped her with her homework. The key is that her mother asked them to do it. She lowered her head and smiled secretly while eating at night, humming nursery rhymes happily.\nThen the three of them worked together to finish all the homework in one day, packed their luggage, and then set off south as a family.\nAccording to the regulations of later times, a car can only have one person over the limit. But the regulations were not strict at this time, so a child like this could be ignored. The family left, and Qin Mu returned to her own home. But she came to check on the house every day and cleaned up the place.\nThat day, she came to clean the house, and seeing that the weather was bad, she carefully checked the doors and windows. She heard someone shouting outside, and when she went out, she saw that it was Fang Zhongcheng and his wife.\nâWhere are the rest of the family? Why arenât the children around?â\nâThe whole family went to the south for fun.â After answering his question, I asked, âWhat are you doing here?â\nâfine.â\nWhen Murong Danling heard that the whole family had gone south to play, she turned away with a gloomy face. Fang Zhongcheng said two words casually and hurried out to chase his wife.\nâWait, Danling, why are you walking so fast?â\nFang Zhongcheng stepped forward and stretched out his hand to hold his wife. Murong Danling stopped in anger. There was a Polonaise next to her, and she held the car keys in her hand. She had come here arrogantly, but now she was unhappy, as if she had accumulated all her strength but punched cotton.\nâDid they really produce a TV set, and it really sold well? Is Li Xia really the director of such a big factory now?â\nâMaybe itâs just bluffing. Donât be discouraged. Iâll go and ask around.â\nThe two had no first-hand information and were still dreaming of a great future. After Murong Danling made money, she spent tens of thousands of dollars to buy a car. The two wanted to use it to attract children, but the family had already left.\nThey went south with the old and the young to visit beautiful places.\nLi Xia and her family went on a trip and had no idea what was happening at home. The car went south, and the first stop was Hangzhou.\nThey found a guesthouse to stay in. Li Xia took out the sheets and pillowcases she had brought with her and changed them in the three rooms. After washing up, everyone had a good nightâs rest and set out to visit West Lake the next day.\nWest Lake, Wuzhen, first in Hangzhou. Lion Grove, Tiger Hill, Hanshan Temple, and then in Suzhou. The natural scenery and cultural landscapes allowed the children to relax and play while also learning a lot of historical and cultural knowledge. When Shen Hui left for the return trip, he wrote an 800-word report on it.\nHuihua was reading her brotherâs manuscript carefully in the car. Shen Hui held his forehead helplessly and said, âDo you still want to memorize it?â\nâYes. I have a writing requirement, so Iâll just copy yours. I wonât have to copy it all, just part of it. The teacher said 300 words is enough.â\nâWhat about me? What should I write?â\nâHey, brother, just write another one. Or we can split it up; you take half and I take half.â\nâIâd better rewrite it. Can you give me your painting of the autumn moon over the lake?â\nâno problem.â\nThe two older ones rewrote the paintings they were supposed to draw, and Shen Haiyang asked the younger son to write one as well. âThereâs no limit to the number of words. Just write whatever you want, whatever you think of.â\nâOkay, but I canât write many words.â\nâIf you canât write, look it up in the dictionary. Didnât Dad buy you a dictionary? Itâs for learning characters.â\nâAll right.â\nThe little guy seems to be able to play freely, but in fact, it is not easy to do. He knows a few words, and just looking up the dictionary is a big project. Moreover, he is not sure whether the word he finds is the one he is looking for, so he can only ask the elder one again and again. But the result of this is that his vocabulary has increased rapidly, and he basically does not need the teacher to read the questions during the exam.\nThe family played for a week, and Shen Haiyang and the children took a few more days off. They went back to work and school as soon as they came back.\nLi Xia went to the factory in the morning and went home early in the afternoon after handling some official business. She took out a book to read when she had time, and the temperature was just right when she sat in a rocking chair in the yard.\nItâs rare to have a half day of leisure in life. Itâs really pleasant to sit in a rocking chair and read a book in the summer afternoon. She was lying comfortably reading a book, and she didnât know when she fell asleep.\nShe slept until she woke up naturally, and then she stretched herself. Qin Mu was already in the kitchen, cooking. She put down her book and went in: âWhatâs for dinner?â\nâBeef dumplings. I bought some fresh beef forelegs today, and I kept some in the freezer. Weâll use the two pounds to make carrot and green onion dumplings.â\n \nLi Xia went to wash her hands and said, âIâll knead the dough and wrap it with you.â\nThey were happily making dumplings at home, unaware that the second daughter-in-law of the Fang family was squatting nearby at the factory. They saw with their own eyes a truck carrying a load of televisions leaving the factory and heard the old man at the gate say that these were goods to be delivered to City E.\nâReally?â Murong Danling couldnât believe it. âIs Li Xiaâs factory really running normally?â\nFang Laoerâs wife nodded, and then Fang Zhongcheng came in with a pale face. He confirmed the news. âIt has passed the quality inspection and is on the market.â\nâSo, how much can she earn in a year from this factory?â\nâIt must be a lot.â\nFang Laoerâs wife left with the child in her arms, and Murong Danling was speechless. Her Polonaise, which she wanted to show off to Li Xia, All her earnings this year were used to buy a car, and she had no money left for purchasing goods. She wanted to show off and take the children to ride in their car, but now she had no chance.\nTelevision sets have a retail price of about 600 yuan each. Ten thousand sets would be 6 million yuan. Such a large factory would produce tens of thousands of sets a year. Thinking of this, she immediately shrank.\nWhen she was so excited about thousands of yuan, she lost her mind and used all the money to buy a car without paying the future payment, while Li Xia had already started to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars. Her little money was not worth much in the eyes of others.\n\n\nTranslatorâs Note:- Sorry for the late update guys, I am not feeling well ð\nAnd Do check out my new novel : Shenjing Dessert ShopÂ https://moonlightnovel.com/novels/shengjing-dessert-shop/\n",
    "76": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c47/\nCHAPTER 47\n“What about the next payment?”\nThe thought of suppressing the other party was extinguished, and she remembered her own business. She couldn’t get in the limelight anymore, and she didn’t want to cut off her future path. She had risked her life to build up her kingdom, and she couldn’t let it end like this.\n“I don’t know what I am doing, and I just want to be in the spotlight every day.”\nShe asked her relatives for money but was laughed at. She was so angry that her liver hurt, and finally her sister helped her get some money.\n“Don’t worry, sister. I will definitely think of you first when I have any good work in the future.”\n“Okay, you should make money as soon as possible and stop thinking about those messy things. Don’t worry about the short term; look at the long term. You can pick up the previous business again. What are you afraid of? Zhang Qiuhua went to jail, but not everyone will go to jail. I see many people are still doing this.”\n“I haven’t stopped working. Sister, what do you want to do? Let’s do it together. I’ve found a good job that will definitely make money.”\nAfter the National Day holiday, the weather got colder day by day. Li Xia took a shower at night and went to the east and west wing rooms to check on the children. When she came back, her feet were a little cold. Her husband lifted the quilt to let her in, but she shook her head and went into the cold quilt next to her. She curled up in the quilt because of the cold, and after shaking it off, she went into a warm embrace.\n“Hey, hey, Shen Haiyang, don’t hug me. I’m cold, and you will feel uncomfortable.”\n“Am I made of paper?”\nThe man spoke in a deep voice, and Li Xia smiled and turned back to give him a kiss. Since she started to be busy, she would lie down and sleep at night when she was tired, or she would worry about the lawsuit. Now she can finally relax and exercise to improve the relationship between husband and wife. Her husband waited especially to warm her bed, and she was also very proactive.\n“Are the three kids okay lately?” After they were done, the two of them lay down, and Li Xia chatted with him.\n“Yes. The painting Huihua drew entered a provincial children’s competition, and the results will be announced at the end of the year. If she wins, she’ll be invited to a provincial children’s party, and we’ll go with her then.”\n“Okay, I get it.” Li Xia said with a smile, “Don’t say that; this girl is not good at studying, but she is really good at painting.”\n“Don’t keep telling your child that she’s not doing well in school. It will hurt her confidence. She scored over 80 in the midterm exam, and her Chinese score is pretty good too.”\n“Oh, I didn’t dare say it to her face; I’ll just talk to you behind her back.”\n“I don’t think I’ve ever said it to her face, but why does Huihua always get so scared when we talk about studying?”\n“How should I know?” She looked up at him and said, “Maybe she feels guilty.”\n“It’s probably because girls are too sensitive. Huihui and Yiyi ‘s grades are too good, which is in stark contrast to hers. Even if we don’t put this kind of pressure on them, their classmates and teachers at school will put it on them.”\n“Yes, that should be the reason. Especially since she and Huihui are in the same class. One is the top student in the grade, while the other is the bottom student in the class. She would be sad if the teacher or classmates made any comparisons. Oh, what can we do? This child’s grades are just not that good.”\nIn her previous life, the high school in the town where her daughter went was the worst among the dozen high schools in the city. Even so, she was a little short of the mark, and she was able to get in because the enrollment was not enough. Children have different talents, and her daughter is very sensitive to images but slow to respond to digital things.\n“If our daughter’s painting wins a prize this time, we will hold a small party for her and invite all her classmates and friends. The two boys will serve as a foil for our daughter, boosting her confidence and letting her not worry too much about her academic performance. She has a talent for painting and a good sense of music, which many people don’t have.”\nShen Haiyang is a very considerate person, and he pays close attention to the children’s condition. When the elders mentioned studying, she lowered her head, and it was obvious that she was inferior in this regard.\n“Will Huihui be unhappy?”\n“No. The brat was just being awkward before, but he has gotten along well in the past few years. He is a boy and a brother. If he doesn’t even have this little tolerance, he deserves a beating.”\n“Don’t do it,” Li Xia said, looking at him with burning eyes. She was really afraid that this gentleman would get angry and use violence against the child.\n“Huihui is very sensible. She will listen to you when you reason with her. It’s normal for children in reconstituted families to be afraid that their parents will be partial to them. Especially since you are the biological father, you must not hurt the child’s feelings.”\nShen Haiyang smiled, folded his arms, and hummed softly. At the beginning, many people laughed at him behind his back for having to live with a rural woman after a serious illness, but he didn’t care at the time and thought they were superficial. Now he feels that he is so lucky to have met her. Life is full of ups and downs, but with her, my heart is so stable and peaceful, and I feel that the years are quiet and good.\n“I hope the United States can quickly develop a cure for your disease so that we can go abroad for treatment. Haiyang, how are you doing with your foreign language skills? Otherwise, we won’t be able to communicate with others if we don’t speak a foreign language when we go abroad.”\n“I’m learning. I’ll study hard.”\n“Actually, I should learn something. But I don’t have the time. I’m still behind in my night school classes. Fortunately, this kind of thing can be made up. I’ll work harder when the factory is formal.”\nWith technicians watching over the production, Li Xia was finally not so busy after it got back on track. She had some free time during this period, so she quickly took advantage of it to go to night school.\nAt night, Fang Zhongcheng rode his bike past her, not far from the classroom, and stopped. The man walked out for a while and then came back, reaching out and grabbing Li Xia.\n“It’s really you; I thought I was seeing things.”\nLi Xia was not willing to pay attention to him, so she pushed his hand away and walked into the classroom. The man called out to her from behind, but she turned a deaf ear. When the class started, she found out that the lecturer was actually Fang Zhongcheng.\nA Chinese quintessence flashed through her mind. When did this guy become this teacher? He studied trade in college and now works in the Economic and Trade Bureau. He obviously prefers the latter between money and power. Although he envied his wife for making money in business, he did not resign. In his previous life, he had always been in the unit, and later he seemed to be a director.\nDuring this period, everything was a bit chaotic, and many areas of economic transformation were in the gray area. He gave lectures in his spare time to earn extra money. Did he suddenly discover his ability to make money?\nHe was speaking on the stage, and Li Xia was taking notes seriously. It’s okay to be hard on people, but not on things, especially knowledge. She had the self-cultivation that she had only in her second life, and her son was born with it, and he didn’t need to be taught at all.\nThe class lasted two hours, and she felt dizzy after class. She had a weak foundation, and it was difficult for her to absorb all this knowledge. She stood up to pack her books. Fang Zhong Cheng was surrounded by students on the podium, asking questions. She walked through the crowd and left through the front door.\n“Li Xia, wait a minute.”\nShe was about to leave with the bicycle when the man behind her called out. She rolled her eyes and stopped, letting him say whatever he wanted to say. If she could handle the problem outside, he wouldn’t come to her house anymore, so as to save the whole family from getting upset.\n“Why are you walking so fast? Did you understand what I just said?”\n“If you have something to say, say it. If you don’t, leave. Do I not know you well?”\n“Why are you so sharp when you speak? I mean, well, please don’t ignore me.” Li Xia was about to leave on her bike before he finished her words, so he quickly stopped her and got back to the point. “I want to discuss something with you.”\n“No discussion.”\n“Li Xia, can you calm down and think carefully?”\n“I’ve thought about it.” Li Xia’s voice was originally very impatient, but she sighed to calm herself down so that he wouldn’t always think that she was impulsive and bring up this again and again.\n“Yiyi is grown up now; he has his own ideas. If you are worried about him, why not have a new child?”\n“If I could have a child, would I have to tell you this again?”\nLi Xia sneered, “Fang Zhongcheng, you two are really a perfect match; you are both shameless enough.”\nAfter saying that, she pushed the bike away fiercely, not wanting to say another word to him. What the hell? In his previous life, he went to find Yiyi again when his child from his remarriage had an accident. It’s the same in this life. His wife couldn’t give birth, so he started to have ideas about Yi Yi. And this damn man is also son-centric, and he almost never said he wanted to Huihua.\n“You bastard, you look down on my daughter so much? Bastard, when you have eyes for my daughter one day, I will make you regret it like you do now, and regret it till your intestines turn green.”\nThe more she thought about it, the angrier she got. The more she thought about it, the more she felt sorry for her daughter. How could she have been so blind to marry such a thing? He was just educated, but she was young, ignorant, and foolish enough to fall for this and find such a father for her children.\nWhen she entered the room, her cheeks were still puffy with anger. Shen Haiyang heard the noise and came out of the backyard. As soon as he entered the room, he saw her throwing her coat fiercely on the bed, with a look of “I’m angry” written all over her face.\n“what happened?”\nHearing his gentle voice, Li Xia sighed as if she had lost all her energy. She reached out and pulled him to sit next to her, holding his arm and resting her head on his shoulder. She sat there in silence for a while before she started talking.\n“I want to train Huihua to be a lady who is proficient in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, so that that bastard can’t reach her.”\n“Fang Zhongcheng is looking for you again.” This was not a question but an affirmative sentence. After seeing her nod, he smiled and touched her hair, comforting her like a child.\n“If you use even a little emotion on him, you will lose. Are you going to sacrifice your child’s happiness for a selfish person? You have such a caring daughter like Huihua; are you willing to make your child unhappy and disrupt her life day by day for others?”\n“Yeah, I almost did something stupid again. That bastard can do whatever he wants; I will just pretend he doesn’t exist. The two children must support him according to the law in the future; that’s the children’s business; I don’t care.”\nShen Haiyang smiled and put his arm around her shoulders. “Fang Zhongcheng will have a pension in the future, and he doesn’t need money from his children. What he needs is psychological care and comfort. You are overthinking this. With Yi Yi’s personality, can he obediently take care of him in his old age and give him psychological comfort?”\n“Yes, what he needs is love. No wonder he wants to take Yiyi away again and again. But now that things are like this, how can he mend the broken relationship?”\n“So you don’t have to care about him. There is no free lunch in the world. When he pushed the child out, he was destined to lose this son.”\nThe two chatted for a few words, and Li Xia threw Fang Zhongcheng to the back of her head. After that, she treated him as a stranger when she went to class. If he wanted to talk privately, she would leave immediately. Not to mention quarreling with him; she was too lazy to even give him a glance.\n“It’s just that there are some things I don’t understand that I can’t ask.” She smiled and said, “But I thought of a good idea. I’ll write down the things I don’t understand and let my deskmate ask them.”\n“That’s a good idea.”\n——————\nThe days passed quickly when she was busy, and before she knew it, she had put on her heavy winter clothes. Everything was bleak outside, but the production workshop in the factory was still bustling.\nShe wore the red down jacket to work that day and immediately attracted the attention of many people in the office. Xiao Liu touched it with great interest and said she would buy one for the New Year.\nShe looked at the financial statements in the office, and the numbers on them made me very happy. Ten percent of the profits were invested in research and development, and the rest was prepared to expand the business. Now is a good time; they must hurry up to develop their own products that can be produced independently and put them on the market, and they can’t always rely on others.\nAfter a busy day, she went home to take a shower first, and when she came out, she wiped her hair with a towel. When she felt that it was no longer dripping, she hung the towel on the shelf, and Shen Haiyang handed her the facial oil.\n“Huihua won a prize for drawing. First place in the youth category.”\nShe stopped twisting the lid and said with surprise, “Really?”\n“really.”\n“My daughter is amazing.”\n“The provincial TV station has invited our family to a party. Remember to make time for it.”\n“Okay, okay, got it.”\nThe daughter’s painting won a prize, and Li Xia excitedly hugged her daughter during dinner. Huihua was startled by her mother for a moment, and then she smiled happily at her. Her mother’s face was full of pride, and this honor was brought to her mother by her. She also has her own strengths, and she can use her strengths to bring joy and happiness to her mother.\n“Mom, are you very happy that I won the prize?”\n“Of course. My daughter is so talented. I told you that you are good at drawing, and you should study art.”\nHuihua had a smug smile on her face; she was also capable. Shen Hui and Yiyi were also happy for her. Looking at her brother’s sincere smiles, her inferiority complex caused by her grades was no longer heavy.\n“Sister, we have to draw sunflowers in art class. Please draw one for me.”\n“Sunflowers are simple. I’ll teach you how to draw them.”\n“Forget it; I don’t like art. I’ll play chess with Grandpa when I have time. Grandpa has been studying Go recently and said that I’m a good match for him. I’m just right for him to keep him company.”\nThe children like completely different things. When drawing, she showed confidence in her face. Even a smart child like her younger brother would have things he doesn’t like or is not good at. She doesn’t need to be too hard on herself.\nThis time she won a prize for her painting, and the teacher also said that when God closes a window for you, he will open another door.\nShe had to go on stage and give a speech at the party, so the organizers asked her to go to the rehearsal. Li Xia took time out to take her there, and the two boys also accompanied her. She changed into a new dress. When she was putting on makeup backstage, she was very nervous and suddenly grabbed her mother’s hand and said she didn’t want to go.\n“Mother,”\n“What are you afraid of? Don’t be afraid; tell mom I’m with you.”\n“I’m afraid I won’t be able to speak well. I’m afraid; I’m afraid I won’t look good.”\n“It’s okay; this is just a rehearsal. The official recording will be made after you perform well.” She smiled and reached out to touch her daughter’s face. “My daughter is so pretty; she will definitely look good on camera. If you don’t believe me, go up and try it. You will know if you are pretty or not.”\nAdults are also nervous when they go on stage for the first time, let alone a child. Li Xia comforted and encouraged her softly. There was also a child on the other side, and the parents began to scold him in a low voice when they could not comfort him well.\nHuihua hugged her mother’s waist, as if drawing strength from her. “Mom, what if I mess up?”\n“It’s just a rehearsal. If you mess up, just start over. Even if you mess up in the official show, it doesn’t matter. You still have your mom here. This show is recorded, not live. If you make a mistake, just start over. Don’t be afraid. Mom will back you up, so don’t be afraid.”\nShen Hui patted her on the shoulder and encouraged her silently, holding her hands one by one: “Don’t be afraid, sister. If you mess up, you mess up. Just start over. This is not something that cannot be reversed. Don’t be afraid; we are all with you.”\n“Um.”\nThe three little ones reached out their hands and clenched their fists in perfect sync, saying in unison, “Come on.”\nWith her mother and her brothers cheering her on, Huihua was not so nervous, and she was very calm and performed very well on stage. She rehearsed very well, practicing again and again to get along well with her partner. She rehearsed for a few days in a row, and when it was almost ready, she was notified to go to the official recording three days later.\nWhen Huihua saw herself on TV, she excitedly stood up from the stool, her hands trembling slightly. Yiyi jumped happily on the ground and turned around to show off to his grandfather.\n“Grandpa, look, my sister is on TV.”\nThe old man nodded with a smile. “Yeah, I see. She is really good at painting; she can even be on TV.”\nYiyi tilted his head and said, “It would be great if I could be on TV someday. It would be best if there was a mental arithmetic competition and I could participate. That way, my brother and I could both be on TV.”\nTelevision had only been around for a few years, and being on TV was definitely something to brag about. Not only people you knew, but even neighbors who you didn’t know well would congratulate you when they saw you.\nThe classmates who were invited to watch the party were also envious and thought she was amazing at drawing. Although her brother and younger brother were good at studying, she was good at drawing and could even appear on TV.\nLi Xia prepared Coke, biscuits, canned food, popcorn, melon seeds, and peanut candy for the children. The children felt that it was more lively here than at school during the holidays. The old man left after seeing his granddaughter, leaving the little ones to play wildly by themselves.\n“Oh yeah,”\n“cheers,”\n“Let’s row our oars and push the boat through the waves.”\nThe house was brightly lit and bustling with people. They sang loudly and stood up excitedly, holding hands and spinning around. They dared to do everything they didn’t dare to do at school. They had food, drinks, and a color TV. Whether it was being on TV or being entertained at home, they were all envied by their classmates.\nThe best friend of Huihua whispered to her in a low voice, “Your parents are so kind; they really are willing to let you go.”\nAnother best friend whispered, “Her brother is good too; he knows how to protect girls. Some of Huihua’s homework was written by Shen Hui; I can see the handwriting.”\nHuihua smiled happily but didn’t say anything. The two looked at each other and whispered at the same time, “I’m so envious.”\n",
    "77": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c47-2/\n \nAfter the party, the final exam was approaching, and Huihua no longer had that worry on her face. She had to study hard and take the exam. As long as she worked hard, there was nothing to be ashamed of.\nAt the end of December, the three of them came back with their admission notices, put their schoolbags on the table, and went out to play. They would start extracurricular classes next week, so they could play freely during this time. In addition to reciting an ancient poem every day, the two boys had to practice piano.\nNew Year approached\nLi Xia’s factory has made a lot of money recently. She has received several orders and can finish them in the second half of next year. She took time to take her children out to play. This year, she went to the northwest. The ancient capital of 13 dynasties has a rich historical and cultural heritage. The Terracotta Warriors and Horses of Qin Shihuang are magnificent and majestic, and she can feel the majesty and dominance of the first emperor.\nThe old man didn’t come this time, as he was getting older and his health was getting worse. The five of them drove into Tongguan and were originally going to stay in Xi’an for ten days. During this long time, the three children just wanted to play around in the area.\nIn the ancient capital, they drove around and found the best guesthouse. The bedding was new, and all the rooms had private bathrooms. On the night they checked in, the three kids had an argument about where to go the next day.\n“Let’s go see the inscriptionless monument.” Shen Hui was very curious about the empress.\n“Let’s go see the Big Wild Goose Pagoda.” Huihua wanted to observe this famous ancient building up close.\n“I bought him some good wine when we went to Li Bai’s tomb.” Yiyi shook the bottle in his hand and said, “Look, it cost me more than one yuan. It’s authentic from Xinghua Village.”\nThe three children started quarreling. This had never happened before in Suzhou or Hangzhou. Li Xia looked back at Shen Haiyang and decided to let him handle the quarrels between the children.\n“Let’s play Guess the Ding Shell, best of three; whoever wins gets to go to the place they want to go the most first.”\n“Okay.”\nThe three of them started guessing the number of Ding Ke on the ground, and Li Xia looked at Shen Haiyang in confusion. It was that simple—no need to scold or reason with them?\nShen Haiyang replied to her with his eyes without saying anything: It would be much more difficult otherwise.\nYiyi lost every time he guessed, so he left the wine he bought at the guesthouse and followed his family around. Finally, they took him to see Li Bai. He excitedly began to recite Li Bai’s poems one by one on the way.\nThis kid has a really good memory. In his previous life, he left a small mountain village and still became the top scorer in science. Li Xia looked at his smug look through the rearview mirror and wondered if Fang Zhongcheng regretted it every time he saw him.\nRegret? Of course. Ever since he saw how smart his son was, he started to pay attention to his son’s grades. He went to find his child’s teacher and regretted it so much when he came out of school. He went to find his son again during the holidays, but the family went out for a trip again.\nAs soon as Fang Zhongcheng entered the room, he saw Murong Danling had just gotten up and was sitting in front of the dressing table, drawing her eyebrows and eyes. It was twelve o’clock, the house was cold, and there was not even a bit of warmth in the air.\n“Do you look like a married woman? Is there a wife like you? Luckily, my mother didn’t see it; otherwise, she would have scolded you.”\n“Who praised me for being pretty in the first place? You want me to be both virtuous and fashionable; who do you think you are? And your mother scolds me. I earn my own money and spend it myself; what right does she have to scold me?”\nThey started arguing again while talking at home, and Li Xia drove back to Beijing. She went to the hospital to check on Shen Haiyang first, and the family returned home after he was fine.\nDuring the winter vacation, Huihua was required to write ten pages. This trip provided her with enough materials. Li Xia also bought her a travel book on the way. This time, the little girl no longer had to worry about writing a diary. She thought that writing twenty pages would not be a problem, let alone ten.\nThe three little ones arranged their own time. Shen Haiyang would check on them from time to time and listen to them practicing the piano when he had time. During the winter vacation, the little ones had a great time. Yiyi did not miss any time to play, but he also memorized many words and chatted with his grandfather every day.\n————\nThe following summer, during the summer vacation, a crew came to the provincial capital to film a play. The crew was looking for young actors; boys between ten and twelve years old who could play the piano would be best.\nShen Hui met all the requirements. After Li Xia read the news in the newspaper, she went home and called her child over. “The crew is looking for actors. You meet the requirements. Do you want to go?”\nShen Hui took the newspaper from her hand and looked at it with hesitation. “Is the crew just filming a TV show?”\n“It’s a movie. The protagonist’s child has returned from abroad, so he wants to find a child who can play the piano.”\nThe child didn’t speak for a long time. Li Xia turned her head and silently observed his expression, then asked, “Don’t you want to go?”\n“I don’t know either. Let’s ask dad when he comes back.”\n“Okay, let’s discuss it with Dad.”\nWhen Shen Haiyang came back and heard about this, he had no special opinion on it. “It’s up to you. If you want to go, go. If you don’t want to go, don’t go. Besides, after this registration, there is still an assessment, and you may not be selected. ”\n“Then, shall I try?”\n“Okay, then I’ll sign you up first.”\nLi Xia thought Shen Hui was very good. This child looked like a combination of Murong Danling and Shen Haiyang, with red lips, white teeth, delicate features, and a pair of watery eyes that seemed to be filled with mist, giving off a melancholy feeling.\nHan Jun came over during dinner, and Li Xia told the couple the news. “The crew is looking for actors, boys between ten and twelve years old. I remember your son being one year older than Huihui, right? He also meets the requirements.”\n“Actor, I’m going to sign up for my son.” Qin Mu was interested in what she heard.\n“Who are you signing up?” Han Jun scolded her, “Let the child study hard, go to college in the future, and bring honor to our Han family.”\n“Han Jun, your thinking is really backward. What era is this? This is an era of equality and freedom. What’s wrong with being an actor? There’s nothing to look down on when someone makes a living based on their own abilities.”\nLi Xia started to refute, and Han Jun smiled awkwardly. “No, I mean, my kid is so ugly; he’s not cut out for this job. It’s better for him to go to college or join the army.”\nLi Xia did not say anything more about other people’s family affairs. The next day, she went to register Shen Hui, and Qin Mu also followed to register her son.\n“He is such an old-fashioned guy. What’s wrong with letting your kid go out and see the world?”\n“Did he agree to it?”\n“I agreed. But he ignored me with a sullen face and said there was a high probability that my son would not be selected. Humph, I don’t care. I just want the child to see more different things.”\nQin Mu smiled and turned to ask her, “Do you and Brother Shen quarrel? I’ve been here for such a long time, and I haven’t heard you two quarrel.”\n“There’s nothing to argue about.”\nThis was too much of a Versailles statement, and Qin Mu was immediately disappointed. They were not short of money, especially after the factory was running normally. Han Jun said that the money was flowing like water. And money can solve 10% of the troubles in life. The rest can be dealt with through discussion.\n“We both have similar education levels and come from similar families, yet we quarrel all the time. You two grew up in very different environments, yet you don’t have any differences in your thinking. It seems that love can really resolve conflicts. If you like someone, you will think everything he says is good.”\nLi Xia was embarrassed by this. How could she talk about love at such an old age? She and Shen Haiyang really had nothing to argue about. It was enough for the couple to respect each other. He had a good temper, and his words and actions were like a trickle of water. She would be quenched by his anger. As time went by, her temper seemed to have calmed down a lot.\n“Han Jun is a bit old-fashioned.”\n“Yes, he is the same age as brother Shen, but he seems to be so uncivilized. Before, they all said that since I don’t make money, I should obey men. Now that I make money myself, I have to reform him.”\nLi Xia smiled and stopped talking. Many things in life are actually acceptable. If it is not a matter of principle, it can be resolved by mutual compromise and tolerance. Qin Mu has listened to her husband for so many years, and now it is time for her husband to compromise. As for today’s matter, the most important thing should be the child’s opinion. It is good to respect children.\nThey drove to the location quickly and handed in photos of their two children to register. “Come here for the audition at 9 a.m. the day after tomorrow. Don’t be late.”\n“Okay.”\nThe two mothers came to sign up together, and two days later they brought their children to audition together. Yiyi was curious about what the crew was like, so he followed along. Li Xia told him to behave himself, and the little guy nodded quickly. When she led Shen Hui into the compound for the audition, the brat started to wander around.\nThis place was rented temporarily by the crew, and there was nothing to see. He wandered around and found it boring, so he followed the crew into the audition yard.\nThere is a little boy performing in the movie. In this part, he made a mistake and was beaten by his father. He was hysterical and quarreled with his father. The setting is that the child has been abroad for two years and has a very extroverted personality. He can’t accept his parents hitting him at all.\nBut this child was very timid and could not let go of the assistant director who was auditioning. He was lightly hit by the assistant director and was so confused that he didn’t know how to express his anger. His big eyes were full of confusion. He was just lightly hit. What was there to be angry about?\n“You can’t do this.”\nThis one\nIt was Shen Hui’s turn. Murong Danling had tried to beat him several times, so he knew what it felt like to be beaten. But he was introverted, and he couldn’t get excited at all when facing strangers.\nSeeing the assistant director pointing fingers and being dissatisfied, Yiyi got angry and rushed over. “Brother, just lose your temper with him.”\nAfter saying that, the little guy turned around and pushed the assistant director hard, causing the big man to stumble. “How dare you hit me? What right do you have to hit me? My mother has worked so hard to raise me, and she has never hit me. Why do you, ah, what right do you have?”\nThe assistant director was stunned for a moment before continuing, “Because I’m your father.”\n“What’s wrong with my father? Are you superior to others? My mom has taken care of my eating, drinking, and toileting since I was a child. How dare you hit me, dad? Who do you think you are? Do you think you can control children just because you are tall? Children will grow up quickly. I don’t want a father like you.”\nThe director didn’t know if it was his true emotions or if the little guy was born with an acting talent, but he spoke these lines with full emotion and just the right expression, and the assistant director’s eyes lit up as he looked at him.\n“What number is this? Where are the parents? Where are the parents?”\nLi Xia quickly stepped forward and said, “He is less than ten years old. He does not meet your requirements. He has not even registered.”\nThe assistant director looked at him carefully and said, “It doesn’t matter. The age difference is not a big deal. Can he play the piano?”\nThe children, one after another, all couldn’t do it, and the assistant director estimated that this child probably couldn’t do it either. But he acted really well, and at most, the piano would be done later.\n“I know a little.”\n“Well, don’t leave yet. Wait for the director to come. If it’s confirmed, you will join the crew in two days.”\nThe assistant director said this and went back to work. Li Xia subconsciously looked at Shen Hui. It was agreed that he would come for the audition, but this brat, isn’t he stealing the show?\n“Mom, Yiyi acted really well; let him join the group.”\n“Aren’t you angry? The brat acted on his own initiative.”\n“Why will I be angry? I get nervous and scared when I get on stage. Let Yiyi take care of this matter.”\nShen Hui didn’t like it, but the director happened to take a fancy to his youngest son, who was a talented actor. The boy was selected to join the group and play a rebellious child.\nAfter the summer vacation, Li Xia asked for a month’s leave for her son. Yi Yi’s grades were good, so the teacher said nothing. She gave her new textbooks and asked her to take them home so that the child could study on his own.\n“It doesn’t matter if you don’t have time to study. With Shen Ruyi’s ability, he can take the math test now. As for Chinese, I can teach him more when he comes back.”\n“Thank you, teacher.”\nBecause the child had to go to school, the crew filmed his scenes first. Less than a month later, the brat came back, and the crew gave Li Xia a set of pictures.\nIn it, he sits in the sunset, thinking sadly of his mother; he sits in front of the piano like a little gentleman; and he quarrels with his father with puffed cheeks, his eyes full of anger, perfectly showing his dissatisfaction with his father without any words or actions.\n“Mom, does it look good?”\n“It’s nice. You should concentrate on going to school tomorrow. It’s time to go out after the show. Don’t think about it anymore.”\nOriginally, she wanted to smooth Shen Hui’s temper, but the brat interrupted. He nodded obediently after hearing what his mother said and went to school with his schoolbag on his back the next day.\nSummer turns to winter, and time flies. In late autumn, when the movie was about to be released, the cinema put up a poster. When Fang Zhongcheng saw that his son was actually acting in a movie, he was so excited that he spread the word everywhere.\nHe queued up to buy more than ten tickets for the first show and gave them to his friends and colleagues. He proudly showed off to others that the person playing the piano on the poster was his son.\n“Awesome, really awesome. Brother, your son is awesome. He’s good-looking and can act in movies. He really brings honor to you as a father.”\n“That’s right. Chief Fang, you are so lucky to have such an outstanding son.”\nFang Zhongcheng was flattered and ecstatic, but soon the movie started. As the plot progressed, the color on his face began to fade, until it was completely gone and as pale as paper.\n“What’s wrong with being a father? Are you superior to others? My mom has taken care of my eating, drinking, and toileting since I was a child. Why do you control me now? Do you think you can control children just because you are tall? Children will grow up quickly. I don’t want a dad like you.”\nHis son’s scream went straight through the screen and into him.\nIn his heart, his head was buzzing. The toy he bought for his son fell to the ground, and he had forgotten to pick it up.\nThe colleagues who had been praising and envying him just now were all silent now, as everyone knew what was happening between him and his son.\nPa, Pa, Pa. He seemed to hear the sound of claps, and his cheeks turned red. Being shamed in public, he trembled with shame. The hurt from his own son was like a knife stabbing into his heart accurately. The pain made him lose the strength to speak.\nA few days later, Li Xia received a summons from the court; Fang Zhongcheng sued her.\nThe couple sat down to discuss the matter in the evening. Shen Haiyang held the notice and shook his head silently. “Is it because Yiyi acted in a movie that stimulated him?”\n“Who knows?”\n“It’s okay. Yiyi is grown up now, and he will have a certain influence once the movie is released. Fang Zhongcheng voluntarily gave up the custody of the child back then, but it’s not that easy to get it now.”\nHe works in the procuratorate. Although he is not on the front line, he still knows about this kind of thing. Li Xia was not too worried. After all, the child is not a dead thing; he is a living person. The court will give Yiyi to Fang Zhongcheng. Will the child live with him obediently? The brat will run here every day. Can the judge send the police to arrest him every day?\nAt the end of the month, Li Xia started to reconcile accounts, calculate wages, bonuses, taxes, and a series of other things at the factory. In the evening, she mentioned this to the brat, who shared the same opinion as his mother. He didn’t want to follow Fang Zhongcheng.\n“Even if I am given to him, I won’t go with him.” After saying that, the little guy ran over to let Shen Haiyang hold him: “I have a dad; I don’t want him.”\nHuihua and Shen Hui were reluctant to leave him, and they were relieved when they heard him say that. The movie had been released for more than a month on the day of the trial, and the brat boldly asked for leave from his teacher and ran to the court by himself.\n“He didn’t want me back then. Now my last name is Shen, so I won’t follow him.”\nThe judge will naturally consider the child’s wishes. Fang Zhongcheng had borrowed money in advance to buy a bigger house. Now he argued in court that he has a high degree of education and a spacious residence, and it would be better for the child to live with him, but this was refuted by Li Xia.\n“Our house, with its front and back yards added up to several hundred square meters, is definitely more spacious than yours. My husband is also a college student, and my father-in-law studied abroad and is now teaching our children foreign languages. The learning atmosphere in our home is better than with you.”\nThe trial was unlikely to come to a conclusion quickly, so during the break, Fang Zhongcheng came to find Li Xia. “You hate me so much that you tried every possible way to make my son and I enemies. I admit that I was wrong back then, and I shouldn’t have abandoned you.”\n“Don’t. You’re good at abandoning it.”\n“Li Xia, are you still unable to let me go? But you shouldn’t use the child to hurt me.”\nLi Xia was about to leave, but turned around in shock when she heard this and interrupted him. “Are you still asleep?” She took a deep breath and spoke calmly. “Even if there was no movie, do you plan to fight for the custody of Yi Yi?”\nFang Zhongcheng was silent. He had indeed thought of this method. His son was so smart, and he was still young. If he could bring him up well, he would definitely bring him honor in the future.\nHe knew that he had little chance of winning the case, so he kept delaying it, thinking about building a good relationship with his child first. Sometimes he comforted himself that no matter how good the child she and Shen Haiyang raised was, it was still his own, but this time his son’s scream on the big screen broke his heart. The movie was just an opportunity, and what he thought was a face-saving thing turned out to be a slap in the face. In anger and humiliation, he sued her regardless.\n“No matter what I do, you won’t give me my son.”\nBecause of the lawsuit, he had inquired about Li Xia’s current assets in advance. After a trip to the tax bureau, he was completely exhausted. He gritted his teeth and made those statements today. He knew that, with his own conditions, it would be difficult to win the custody case.\nSeeing Li Xia’s confident speech in court, he felt bitter. Her words seemed to be read out like a script, without any momentum. It seemed like she was giving an explanation to herself and others. He tried hard to raise his son, but this woman didn’t give him a chance.\n“yes.”\nLi Xia turned around and left, not feeling his regretful face at all. In her previous life, she also wanted his excellent son when he grew up, but your apology is really cheaper than grass.\nThe child is excellent.\nIf a child is stupid, will you abandon him like a worn-out shoe? Whoever is your son in this world is unlucky. How can there be a father like you?\nFather’s love is like a mountain; mother’s love is like water. The mountain is steady, solid, and reliable. It is the goal of children’s learning and also a harbor for children to protect from wind and rain.\nBut look at you; you are so utilitarian in loving your child. If he is not so smart, if he is sick or stupid, then you would say now that this is not your son at all.\nIf she didn’t have such a good economic condition and a good family environment, wouldn’t he ignore the child’s wishes and her wishes and forcibly use legal means to take him away and separate her from him? In the final analysis, he doesn’t love anyone but himself.\nLi Xia took a deep breath while driving. She was no longer willing to waste her emotions on a man like him. He couldn’t win the lawsuit, so she just went through the motions.\nFang Zhongcheng returned home in dejection. He was already feeling extremely miserable, and Murong Danling even stabbed him in the heart.\n“Li Xia seems to have been named one of the top ten rich young people in the province, and the award ceremony will be held before the New Year.” As she spoke, her rosy lips smiled.\n“When she was with you, she was so gray and without a trace of brilliance. But when she was with Shen Haiyang, she became a legend in the provincial capital. It seems that you, as a man, don’t take care of others. You have no ability to nourish a woman at all.”\nHe felt a pang of blood in his heart, and it was stabbed through his heart. He knew he had no chance of winning the custody lawsuit, so he had to keep a low profile at home and abroad; otherwise, his wife’s words would be more sharp than a knife.\nAt the end of the year, Li Xia and a group of entrepreneurial pioneers gathered at the TV station. The award ceremony has passed, and this year the provincial TV station held a simple evening party. As leaders of the times, they will be interviewed in the middle of the evening party.\nLi Xia was a little nervous sitting there, glowing in the spotlight. In her previous life, she was on stage only when her son became the top scorer in the college entrance examination. At that time, her face was already frosted, and her eyes were cloudy. But in this life, she walked in front of the crowd, wearing bright clothes, with a smile on her face, full of youthful vitality.\n",

It is said that behind every successful man there is a woman who silently contributes. Do you have a man in your family who supports you?â\nLi Xia took the microphone with a smile. After taking a deep breath, she calmed her nervousness. She said openly, âYes, I have three children. If my husband hadnât been silently supporting me from behind, I would have been too busy to focus on my career.â\nâSo should we take this opportunity to express your feelings to your husband?â\nLi Xia is facing the camera, her cheeks rosy, her eyes shy and happy. âWe are husband and wife, hand in hand, through thick and thin together. I am grateful for having you in my life. You have contributed half to my success today. Letâs celebrate together when we get home.â\nThe host took the microphone, his voice rising and falling. âHusband and wife join hands, through thick and thin, together. What a beautiful relationship. In the new era and new look, women can hold up half the sky. Letâs walk hand in hand on the road of time. Next, please enjoy âWe Walk on the Road.â\nThe family of fiveâthree of themâappeared on the screen this year. The Shen family was the center of attention among the people they knew. Li Xiaâs program was also recorded, so when she saw this scene on TV, she was sitting with her family, drinking tea, and chatting.\nOn TV, she held a microphone, but in reality, she held a teacup. Her eyes were like spring water, and her cheeks were full of rosy clouds. She smiled at Shen Haiyang in front of all her family members. Moreover, she did not speak properly but started to sing.\nâThe medal of honor is half mine and half yours.â\nAfter the song was over, everyone led the applause. Shen Haiyang also blushed. His wife was sometimes quite romantic. It would be fine to say this in private, but why was she so serious about it?\nâDad, Dad, please sing a song in response to Mom.â\nYou little brat, do you think this is Liu Sanjie singing a duet? Everyone laughed for a moment. Li Xia clinked her teacup with her husbandâs. She drank the tea with such gusto that even Huihua was afraid that she would drop the cup on the ground.\nâIt seems like a wedding wine.â\nThey murmured one by one, and the elder brother and sister nodded in agreement. Li Xia was so happy to see her family that she took out a bottle of Wuliangye from the cabinet and poured herself a glass. She tilted her head back and drank it in one gulp. The spicy and sweet aroma of the wine made her very addicted.\nâTake it easy.â\nShen Haiyang knew she was happy, so he didnât stop her. The old man went out wearing his military coat to set off firecrackers with the children, while the two of them drank and chatted in the house.\nShe leaned close to Shen Haiyang and put her arms on his shoulders. They could smell each otherâs breath, and she couldnât suppress her excitement. âDo you know how much money we made this year?â She stretched out her hand and said, âSo much, so much money; we donât have to worry about money anymore.â\nâSo youâve paid off your debt?â\nLi Xia shook her head and said, âNo, I put most of the money into research and development and am preparing to expand production. Now the factory basically relies on external assistance, just assembly. In the future, we have to produce our own products. It is always unreliable to rely on others.â\nâWife, you are really generous.â\nBeing praised by her husband, Li Xiaâs already excited nerves became even more excited. âWe agreed to pay off the debt with interest in two years. I didnât use the money I earned this year to pay off the debt, but I added a new production line and invested the rest in research and development. Shen Haiyang, do you want a car? Iâll buy you one.â\nâI only earn 180 yuan a month, and you want me to drive a car to work.â\nâIt seems like it has a bad influence.â She laughed and said nothing. âThen what do you want? We have plenty of money now.â\nâI do not want anything.â\nHe held her in his arms and sat down, and Li Xia picked up her glass and drank another one. The children outside called her to set off fireworks, and the couple got up and went out. When crossing the threshold, Li Xia stumbled and fell into Shen Haiyangâs arms, and the two almost fell down together.\nâHa ha,â\nâDrunk?â\nShe felt a little dizzy, but she refused to admit that she was drunk. âNo, we are just getting started. Letâs stay up all night to celebrate the New Year and set off fireworks.â\nThe fire was blazing in the yard, and the children were running around happily, setting off fireworks. Many children from the neighboring families came to join in the fun, so the children called them out to set off fireworks.\nAt that time, fireworks were still high-end products, and many ordinary workers were reluctant to buy them. There were only a few firecrackers around. This year, Li Xia bought more than a dozen big fireworks, and in such a lively atmosphere, of course they had to set off two to make the children happy.\nShen Haiyang turned around and prepared to get the fireworks, but the two brats had already carried one out. After putting it down, they clapped their hands and continued, âDad, donât worry about it; we can just move it.â\nThey shouted one by one, âDonât release it; wait until we come back.â\nTwo barrels of fireworks were placed a few meters apart, and Shen Haiyang asked the children to stand further away. The bravest of them took a match and lit the one on the left. The fuse burned with a crackling sound, and a beam of light shot up into the sky.\nColorful fireworks exploded overhead, and before one wave of colorful mist faded, another wave rose up. People who were watching TV in the small shop in the front yard came out when they heard the noise, and adults and children enjoyed a romantic star shower from a distance.\nâHey, how much money did Li Xia make this year?â\nThe older sister, who has worked in the bun shop for several years, really admires the boss. She used to laugh at her, but now she feels so embarrassed. She is not only a pioneer in entrepreneurship in the province, but she also has a harmonious family. Look at the couple talking to each other from a distanceâhow sweet it isâthat many men and women envy.\nâOur boss is really capable and courageous. At first, the factory was said to be going bankrupt, and some people wanted to buy the land. Now, it seems that she has revived it.â\nâWe are still saving money to buy a TV, but they have already started making TVs. Why is the gap between people so big?â\nâThereâs nothing we can do. Even if we were offered a job at a factory like that, we wouldnât dare take it.â\nâThatâs right. This woman is really courageous. She sold such a profitable shop without hesitation.â\nA group of people were envious and sighing. They envied others for having such a good life and sighed that they themselves would not dare to take this opportunity given to them.\nLi Xia has the foresight of rebirth, and she really dares to do it. No matter how big the risk is, if she fails, she will have to start all over again. Selling goods from north to south and sitting on a hard seat on a train, some people probably donât want to start all over again. But she is determined to go forward and not retreat. The opportunity is right in front of her, and she has to try her best no matter how big the risk is.\nTwo big fireworks were set off, and the three little ones stole the show. After that, they went to play with their friends, and they were all still talking about how beautiful the fireworks were.\nThe old man was old, so he went to sleep after the New Yearâs bell rang. The couple turned off the main lights in the house, leaving only a small, dim yellow light.\nLi Xia said she would stay up all night to celebrate the New Year, but in fact, she returned to her room, was pushed down by her husband, and fell asleep after that. She was also tired this year, not physically but mentally. Now that she is finally on the right track, she will take a good rest this New Year.\nShe slept soundly in her husbandâs arms. The three little ones came back to see that the lights in their parentsâ room were turned off, so they went to sleep obediently.\nOn the third day of the New Year, the old man hosted a banquet for all the relatives of the Shen family at the restaurant. When Li Xia saw Uncle Shen, she shook her head silently. How could this man be so shameless? His face was even thicker than the corner of the city wall.\nShen Haiyang had told him to cut off the relationship, but he came back after the old man came back. The old man was closer to him, and they still had a childhood friendship. As people age, they are more nostalgic, so he borrowed a few hundred yuan from the old man. She guesses the old man just thought of it as a companion for him to reminisce.\nâMy niece-in-law is really capable. She now runs a factory and appears on TV. My niece-in-lawÂ  is so successful. I envy and praise her when I watch her on TV. Our Shen family has such a daughter-in-law. It must be a blessing from our ancestors.â\nThe old man liked to hear this and immediately smiled. âYes, Haiyang has a good wife.â\nThe waiter poured tea for them. Li Xia didnât want to sit with a group of old men. She got up and went to the private room next door with a few little kids.\nâMom, and that uncle is so annoying.â\nHuihua sat down and complained, and Shen Hui nodded and continued, âHeâs so shameless. How could there be an elder as shameless as dadâs uncle in our clan for people like me and my father?â\nâA dragon gives birth to nine sons, and each of them is different. Whatâs more, they are just from the same clan.â Li Xia explained.\nâOh, brother, you are just too thin-skinned. Although dadâs uncle is not very capable, he can still get benefits from being thick-skinned. He knows that my grandfather misses his country very much; specifically, he misses his home and his family. He relies on this fact and knows that my grandfather will never kick him out.â\nLi Xia looked back at her son. How old is this brat, and he can actually see all this?\nShe was still nostalgic for the first half of her life, so she didnât bother with him. And that thick-skinned man was so shameless that he had offended her and Shen Haiyang before, but later he apologized happily when he saw them both.\nâIsnât he just like the villains in the books?â Shen Hui looked down on him. He might be able to accept a hypocrite, but he really couldnât accept such a shameless villain. âWill Grandpa be deceived by him?â\nâBrother, you think too much.â Yiyi took a piece of raw carrot and ate it. âGrandpa is a smart man. He gave him some benefits just to have someone to accompany him and tell him about the past. As for saying that he lied to Grandpa, thatâs impossible. The second uncle was able to transfer so much money because he is Grandpaâs biological son. Uncle Shen is far from that.â\nLi Xia looked back at her son and said, âShen Ruyi, who taught you this?â\nThe little guy stuffed the last bit of carrot into his mouth and tilted his head back to let his mother wipe his mouth. âSometimes adults would say that grandpa would give me some pointers when I played chess. And the fact is there. Grandpa was happy to have someone to recall his childhood with, and dadâs uncle was also happy to receive some small things from grandpaâs fingers.â\nâYou think this is a win-win situation?â\nâThatâs right.â The little guy looked up, his big eyes rolling around, not understanding where he had said anything wrong.\nâHe called you a burden before; donât you bear a grudge? Donât you find him annoying?â\nLi Xia asked this, and Shen Hui also expressed the same meaning with his eyes and expression. He has offended me, and I just hate him. I hate him in my heart and on my face.\nâHe is an eyesore and bears grudges. Why do you bother about him, brother? You know what kind of person he is. Just start calculating with him without getting emotional. If you are happy on the surface, others will not be able to say anything. Otherwise, outsiders will think you donât respect your elders. This will be disadvantageous to you.\nYou forgot the story of Zeng Guofan that Grandpa told us. He failed in the officialdom at the beginning , and he didnât understand why he was not tolerated by others even though he acted uprightly. Later, he wrote to his brother: âI have recently seen the way of heaven and earthâthat hardness and softness can be used together, and neither can be neglected.â\nWell, Li Xia didnât say anything this time. Who did her son take after? He was so young, yet he could get rid of the contempt others had for him.\nIn his previous life, no one taught him to figure things out. He was sensitive when he was young, but he still had a lot of good friends. He learned to hide things when he grew up, and he had very good interpersonal relationships in college. In this life, the old man actually taught him at such a young age that he should be gentle but firm and use both firmness and gentleness. In this life, he is very confident in such a family environment, and the inferiority and arrogance in his previous life did not show up at all.\nThe mother and her children were talking when Shen Haiyang came in.\nâShould I learn from Yi Yi? In the business world, it is inevitable that there will be people you donât like or have grudges against. If you meet someone, itâs only beneficial, so you should put aside the past grudges.â\nShen Haiyang nodded. âYou already knew that the previous shop was bought by Murong Danling, and you didnât argue with her. You already knew the truth, and you have always done it this way. You donât like my uncle, but you still treat him as a relative. In your eyes, relatives should be based on feelings, and you are disgusted by such relatives.â\nShe slapped her forehead. âIâm still stupid. Why should I treat him as a relative? I should just treat him as someone who can entertain the old man.â\nâAll those who came today are here to show respect. If the old man chooses to be buried in the Shen familyâs ancestral tomb a hundred years later, these people will still come and go. The Shen family members gathered together because of our prosperity, and we entertained them for the old manâs sake. Didnât you see that the old man didnât hold a banquet at home but chose to hold it outside?â\nShen Haiyang looks gentle, but he is actually very savvy. He is ruthless when it comes to fighting back and has a good grasp of interpersonal relationships.\nAt the dinner table, the uncle gave red envelopes to the children and started by praising them. âOh, our Yiyi has grown up so much. He is so sensible.â He took out a red envelope from his pocket and gave one to each of the three children. âLook how good this is. Other families have only one person, but we have three people, so itâs lively. They grew up together and will continue to support each other in the future. We are better than them.â\nAs the oldest child, Shen Hui felt awkward at this moment. If it were in the past, he would have gone up one by one. But today, the brat did not move and just looked at his brother. He stood behind his brother and followed his brotherâs lead. Grandpa taught us that people should not be arrogant but should have pride. There is no need to bend when it is not necessary to compromise.\nShen Hui hesitated for a moment, then stepped forward and politely took the red envelope and thanked him.\nâThank you, Grandpa Uncle.â\nâHey, look how sensible our Huihui is. He looks like the eldest grandson of the Shen family.â\nShen Hui took it, and Huihua and Yiyi followed suit to take it and thank him. Old Master Shen nodded secretly and said, âHuihui, pour tea for Grandpa Uncle.â\nThe little boy was stunned for a moment, then did it obediently. After pouring it, he paused and said, âGrandpa Uncle, please have some tea.â\nYoung boys are teachable. Old Master Shen gave his grandson an approving look. Stubbornness is the worst thing for boys. Shen Hui is especially easily influenced by others. If someone instigates him, a stubborn child will easily get stuck at a dead end. It is too easy for people to see through his emotions, and he will be easily taken advantage of.\nYiyi is a little slippery and can easily see through the conflicts of interest between people. His slippery personality easily gives people the impression that he has no backbone. But this child has a very good advantage; he is ruthless and sentimental. He will never abandon those who are rejected, and he will never abandon those who are in his heart. Just a simple hint, and he will immediately follow his brother today.\nThe little one is not important; at most, he will be accused of being a child with no rules and no respect for elders. But the elder brother is very important; if the elder brother canât let go, he will be scolded together with the elder brother.\nNeither of the two children let him down. They were very malleable and could listen to the teachings of their elders. Huihui was too sentimental and could not learn to scheme against his relatives. This was both good and bad, because love can warm people but also hurt them. And he had a biological mother like that, so he could not be too naive or simple.\nThe elders of the Shen family sat down at the table one after another. The uncle felt that he had guessed correctly and had connected with the rich cousin again. When people get old, they miss the past, and he really misses his cousin. He thought that the old man didnât care about his past because he missed it, but in fact, that was not the case at all.\nAfter coming back for so long, the old man discovered his grandsonâs shortcomings and kept him to correct his character. Shen Hui was too straightforward, and his guts were straight to the end. Everything was written on his face, and this was not okay.\nToo much rigidity will break easily, and too much softness will lead to failure. Only by combining rigidity and softness can one prosper forever. He is the eldest grandson of the Shen family. Even if he does not have to take on the responsibility and does not have to worry too much about interpersonal relationships in the future, he cannot be too simple and must be well matched with Yi Yi.\nThe uncle thought he had guessed the old manâs thoughts. After dinner, when most people had left, he spoke to Li Xia without knowing whether to behave or not.\nâNiece-in-law, Uncle wants to trouble you for help. My nephew still has no job. Can you arrange for him to work in your factory? Donât worry; I will never cause any trouble for you. Just give him an ordinary position.â\nHe had told his cousin before, but the old man said that Li Xia was in charge of the factory and asked him to contact Li Xia directly. He then found an opportunity to ask for help from the woman who had once made him lose his face.\nâIâm really sorry, but the factory is so full of people, there are no extra positions. I recruited a group last summer; why didnât he sign up?â\nSign up? You are so strict, I donât need to tell you that he wonât be selected. âI didnât hear the news; I missed it. Niece-in-law, we are all relatives. My nephew is looking for a wife, and itâs hard to find a job. You can make some concessions. You are the factory director; itâs not a big deal to arrange someone.â\nâUncle, you said you wouldnât embarrass me.â\nShe didnât even bother to find a reason to refuse, and she directly blocked his words. With that tone, if youâre nice, we can just maintain our face for now, but if you keep talking, Iâll fight you.\nThe uncle, who was such a troublesome person, was suddenly stunned. Now he was the one begging others, not others begging him. The uncle listened to Li Xiaâs words and would never confront his daughter-in-law for him. If he confronted Li Xia, he might be kicked out by Shen Haiyang in the next second. His nephew looked gentle, but in fact, he would not retreat at all when he had to confront him.\nâWell, forget it then.â\nThe uncle left in disgrace, and Shen Hui looked at his back and shook his head. This guy is really thick-skinned, and he probably wonât be able to be so thick-skinned in his life. But if you donât like him, just stick to your bottom line, just like mom didnât promise him anything today.\nAnd the speed at which Momâs expression changed just now was also very fast, just like Yi Yi. He seemed to have some understanding of the limits of doing things. He should give up when it is time to give up and not dwell on blood ties. Some people should not be taken to heart.\nWhen they got home, the child held her hand and said, âMom, are we going to grandmaâs house tomorrow?â\nâYes, get up early tomorrow. Grandpa is going to visit an old classmate for a few days. We just happened to have some free time, so the whole family is going home to pay New Yearâs greetings to your maternal grandparents.â\nOn the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, the family drove to Li Xiaâs parentsâ home. This was Shen Haiyangâs first visit to his parents-in-lawâs home. Li Xia had told her third brother during the holiday, so the family was already prepared.\nAs soon as they entered the house, they were quickly invited to sit on the kang, and hot eggs and sugar water were served to quench their thirst. The dinner was also sumptuous.\nThe dumplings were stuffed with three kinds of fillings and made into three different kinds of styles. You can eat whatever you like. Stewed mutton, braised fish, stewed chestnuts, braised pork chops, tofu with spring onions, cold bean curd, shredded ear with red oil, onion, and black fungus. Four main dishes, four cold dishes, and a casserole of mutton soup.\n Â Â Â Â Â  (Vegetable Dumpling)\nÂ  Â  Â (Beef Dumpling)\n Â  (Garlic Chicken Spinach Dumpling)\nÂ Â Â   (Stewed mutton)\nÂ Â Â   (braised fish)\n Â  (stewed chestnuts)\nÂ Â   ( braised pork chops)\n  (tofu with spring onions)\nÂ   ( cold bean curd)\nÂ   ( shredded ear with red oil)\nÂ   (onion and black fungus)\n\n\nT/N :- Hey guys, sorry about the zero updates till now in this week.

    "79": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c48-2/\nThe three brothers, their sisters-in-law, and the children were all there, sitting at two tables in the room. There were two portions of food for everyone. The three little ones were with their cousins, while the adults sat around the round table, drinking and eating meat.\nThe meal was very lively, and at night everyone slept on a big kang. Huihui was a little uncomfortable with the new bed and tossed and turned for a long time before falling asleep.\nThe next day, when everyone got up, Li Xia didn’t wake him up. She brushed her teeth and washed her face in the yard, while the mother and daughter chatted while cooking. The old man didn’t want to disturb his grandson’s sleep, so he put on his clothes and went out to chat with his old friend with his hands behind his back.\nWhen Shen Hui woke up, the sun was shining brightly. He sat up and dressed quickly. Li Xia came in, and the little guy looked at his mother with some embarrassment.\n“Mother,”\nLi Xia saw that he had already put on his clothes and patted his head. “Go downstairs to wash your face and prepare for lunch.”\n“oh.”\nThe child obeyed obediently, went downstairs to put on his shoes, and shouted to the old lady, “Grandma, which one is the wash basin?”\nThe old lady quickly went to get it: “Here, here. Come, let me scoop some water for you. This is a new towel.”\nThe child took the basin obediently: “No need to get a new one; Yiyi and I can just use one.”\nAfter washing his face and eating, the child was smiling the whole time and got along with everyone very naturally. He called grandpa, grandma, uncle, and aunt as if Li Xia was his biological mother, and there was no trace of the alienation he had shown the last time he came.\nThe old lady whispered to her daughter, “If one doesn’t know, they might think he came out of your belly. Last time you came back, he didn’t really call us family, but this time he looks no different than a Huihua.”\n“So don’t worry, mother.”\nThe old lady’s wrinkled face was full of joy. “Don’t worry, don’t worry. You are a famous one here now; everyone will give you a thumbs up when you mention it.”\nShe went there on the fourth day of the Chinese New Year and left on the sixth. Although her parents were reluctant to let her go, they still bid farewell with tears. As long as their daughter was doing well, they would be relieved.\nAfter May, all units started to resume work. Li Xia’s factory never stopped working. During the New Year, Han Jun and Xiao Liu each took charge of one end of the factory, and production was in good order.\nAfter the Lantern Festival, the factory produced another batch of goods. During the meeting, Fang Long from the R&D department said, “I suggest that the R&D department give everyone a bonus for every technology they develop. This will motivate everyone.”\nXiao Liu said, “Why? We all work; your salary is already high, and you get bonuses every time you develop a new product. You are really obsessed with money.”\nShe had long been dissatisfied with the fact that the technical staff’s salary was higher than that of Xiao Liu, the department leader. This time, Fang Long brought up a series of issues regarding bonuses and other rewards, and she was the first to jump out and refute.\nHan Jun also felt that Fang Long was a bit too much. He wanted a bonus, even though he was paid so much. You don’t work for the factory for free. I have never seen anyone make extra requests to the boss for the work they get paid for.\n“I think Xiao Liu is right. We can’t ask for money for everything.”\nFang Long sighed silently and looked back at Li Xia. In this era of making quick money, she was able to recruit technical personnel and organize a research and development department from the beginning. This vision was definitely not just for the immediate benefits.\nThe R&D department has invested so much money, and the various equipment alone is a big expense. Technicians are different from ordinary workers. Workers are like assembly lines, with only so much work to do every day. But the work of technicians is not easy. If we can inspire everyone’s enthusiasm and shorten the R&D time of a technology, then these bonuses are definitely worth it.\nThe faster you develop new products and launch them, the faster you can make money. Time is money. In this era of rapid change, the earlier you enter the industry, the faster you can seize market share.\n“I think Director Fang’s proposal is good and can be implemented. ”\nHan Jun turned around and said, “Director, is this really necessary?”\nXiao Liu: “Sister, there’s no need to pay this extra fee, right?”\nLi Xia shook her finger and explained, “If we can produce our next product ahead of schedule, then this little bonus is what the technicians deserve.”\nShe is the boss; she has the final say. This is not a state-owned factory, and they have to consult other people, vote by raising hands, report for approval, and pass each level. If they can’t pass, then this can’t be implemented. Sometimes, when all the levels are passed, the business opportunity is also passed. It’s good to do it without losing money.\nIn the private sector, what she said was what she meant. Han Jun and Xiao Liu stopped talking, and no matter how unwilling they were, they had to swallow their anger.\nFang Long was very satisfied with Li Xia as a boss. He did not expect her to be so decisive. “I have recruited two more talents in weak current. We will develop what you need as soon as possible.”\n“Okay, work harder. Once the product is developed, I’ll give you bonuses based on its value.”\n“Boss, just wait for the results.”\nAt that time, most technical personnel were in state-owned enterprises, and private enterprises wanted to recruit them by offering high salaries and benefits. In state-owned enterprises, people lost their enthusiasm after a long time because of the low salaries. Now that private enterprises are so tempting, everyone is full of energy, like clockwork.\nIn March, the custody case was heard again. Fang Zhongcheng had voluntarily given up the child before, and now the child was not willing to be with him at all. Moreover, Li Xia’s conditions were better than those of the two families. Therefore, the first instance court ruled that the child should stay where he was and follow his mother.\nFang Zhongcheng came out of the court with his head down, looking a little depressed. It seemed that he would not be able to get his son back. If the first trial was like this, it would be useless to appeal. Seeing that Li Xia was about to leave, he called out to her to stop.\n“Li Xia, let’s talk.”\nLi Xia looked around, and he continued, “There’s a new western restaurant nearby. I’ll treat you to a meal. We can talk while we eat.”\nLi Xia was not happy to go out with him to eat Western food. “Forget about the Yiyi matter. Everything is in accordance with the law. There is nothing to discuss between us.”\nShe was about to leave, but Fang Zhongcheng hurried over to pull her back: “Don’t be like this; let’s talk it over.”\n“We, do you think there is really a need to talk?”\n“Let Yiyi stay with me on weekends. I’ll take him to extracurricular classes.” He frowned and said, “I’m his father. But look at him now. He looks like Shen Haiyang’s biological son. He’s my son. I can’t just give him to Shen Haiyang like this.”\n“You’re just thinking that now. It’s too late.”\n“Then I will sue to restore the child’s surname.” He panted, his face full of indignation. “Even if the child has your surname Li, they can’t both have the surname Shen.”\nIf it has her last name, it’s still your child. If it has Shen Haiyang’s last name, you’ll feel like it’s been taken away from you. Li Xia sneered, having expected his bad nature. Sure enough, this is a thorn that sticks into his flesh and hurts him when he moves.\n“When they turn 18, they can make their own decisions. Even if you try your best to change their surnames, how can you save face when they change their surnames back? No matter if their surnames are Shen or Li, they can’t have the surname Fang. They are no longer your children, Fang Zhongcheng. Don’t try to plot against them in the future.”\nAfter she finished speaking, she walked away quickly, opened the door, got into the car, and soon disappeared from his sight. Fang Zhongcheng’s face was as pale as a sheet of paper. He regretted it, but it was irreversible. His son would never be close to him when he grew up. Even if the law required him to support him, the most he could do was to give him some living expenses or send him to a nursing home.\n“Shen Ruyi is no longer your son.”\nHe was already upset, and Murong Danling provoked him when he got home. He was so angry that he didn’t eat dinner and was sulking for several days. After that, he thought it through and told Murong Danling to ask Shen Hui to come over. Shen Hui was more easily influenced and easier to coax.\n“I don’t want to.”\nHe didn’t understand why she was doing this to her own son. “Then why don’t we adopt one?”\n“I didn’t raise them. A dog can’t be attached to sheep, and I don’t bother to work on other people’s blood.”\n————\nLi Xia’s factory produced 50,000 black-and-white TVs last year, and this year Li Xia is expected to produce 80,000. When the time came, she took the check to pay back the money, but she heard that the old lady had passed away.\n“What? How could this happen?”\n“Madam was ill when you came to see her, but she didn’t tell anyone. She said in her last will and testament that if you come between these dates, you don’t have to pay back the money.”\n“No, what does that mean?”\nThe two people shook their heads. “We don’t understand either. But this is what she ordered before she died, and it’s written in her will. I’ll take you to see a lawyer. The IOU is with the lawyer.”\nShe followed the person to the lawyer’s office and found that the will was indeed written like this. She took the check back and destroyed the IOU on the spot. Such a large sum of money went into her pocket.\nThe IOU says that if Li Xia fails, she will have to pay it back. But she is allowed to postpone it for one year. If she comes to pay it back before one year, she will have to pay it back, but without interest. But she doesn’t have to pay it back if she delays until the deadline is almost due.\nLi Xia was thinking all the way while driving, wondering what the old lady meant. She had no children, and part of her property was set up as a fund, and part was donated. Although the money was useless to her, why would she give such a large sum to herself in this way? Moreover, if she used the money she earned last year to pay off her debts first, she would not get it.\nWhen she returned home, she was full of doubts and took the check to the backyard to tell her father-in-law about it. This was related to the factory accounts, and she had to explain it to the old man. After listening to what she said, the old man took the check in his hand.\n“To help someone in need is to test your character and judgment.”\n“She lent me money to help me start the factory, and then she made this arrangement before she left. If I don’t pay it back, a lawyer will definitely sue me. If I pay it back early, it means I don’t have much courage, but she still waived the interest for me, which is a recognition of my character. And now I have extended the repayment period to the limit, which shows that I am capable of doing things, so this money is her help to me.” Said Li Xia.\nThe old man nodded. This lady was affectionate and rational. His daughter-in-law was indeed courageous. As a small peasant woman, she dared to use all her money to buy a house, invest in a shop, and then decisively sell the shop to invest in a factory. The factory made so much money in a year, but she did not rush to pay off the debt like ordinary people. Instead, she invested most of her income in research and development.\nLi Xia: Several million yuan seemed like a huge sum of money at that time, but it depreciated very quickly. It was one of the items that depreciated the most after the reform and opening up. Of course, we had to invest in research and development. Only by developing better products could we make more money, and the factory could continue to develop.\nShe always felt that she was incapable and was afraid that she would not be able to keep up with the development of the times. So she let her children learn as much as they could. She taught them from a young age that development is ever-changing and they need to change. Her children should not be the kind of people who are satisfied with the present moment.\nNow that she has received such a gift from the old man, she will also lend it to the Buddha. The old lady had no children, and after her death, her money was used for charity. So she will also do charity, donating a few percent of the profit every year. In this way, she can give back to society and live up to the old lady’s kindness.\n“Well, Dad, what to do about this money? I plan to open another washing machine production workshop. I’m doing the preparatory work now. The R&D department is almost ready, and we can start production once the factory building is built.”\n“Okay, that’s about enough money. This time, it’s yours.”\n“We are all family, so there is no need to calculate so clearly. I didn’t invest half before, and you gave me half of the shares. And you also gave me the money to buy the shop.”\nThe old man waved his hand and said, “From now on, it will all be yours.”\nLi Xia knew that the old man had changed his will, but she still accompanied him. All the property was left to the couple, and the future would be theirs, so there was no need to worry about so much now.\nIn just a few years, Li Xia went from being a person with clean pockets to the person who now owns most of the factory. The old man gave her more money when distributing it, and now this part of the money that does not need to be repaid is all hers. If you calculate carefully, she is richer than Shen Haiyang.\nShe happily walked out of the backyard, and Yiyi came back from school with her schoolbag on her back. When she saw her, she rushed over. “Mom, what’s the good news?”\n“How do you know that Mom ” good news?”\n“Mom’s eyes are full of joy.”\nLi Xia squatted down and wanted to hug her son, but she found that he had grown up and it was difficult to hold him. “What did you eat to make you so heavy? I can’t hold you anymore.”\n“Haha, when I grow up and hug my mom, it will be the same.”\n“Then grow up quickly and study hard. Then you can take over mom’s job so that mom can just lie at home and do nothing.”\n“Okay, no problem.”\nThe guy got off his mother and said, “But mom, won’t you be bored lying at home all day? Why don’t you go traveling with dad? Now we are just traveling around the country, and you can travel around the world in the future. Mom, there are so many countries abroad; they are so big.”\n“Well, what my son said makes sense. When you take over, Mom will travel around the world with your dad. We will visit Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, 20 countries in Europe, America, Africa, and everything in between.”\nIn her previous life, her son had signed her up for a tour group so that she could travel and relax, but at that time she was twisted like a doughnut, angry that he shouldn’t recognize Fang Zhongcheng. She was not moved by the child’s kindness at all. She tore up the tour group ticket and had a big fight with her son.\n“Okay, I’ll make money for mom and dad.”\nLi Xia smiled. In her previous life, her son studied computer science, which was a relatively unpopular major at the time. In this life, she still does not interfere if he likes it. With computers and mobile phones, there should be room for development for children to study these in the future.\nWhen Shen Haiyang came back in the evening and told Shen Haiyang about these things, it was the first time Shen Haiyang heard that his father had left all his property to him. But he didn’t care much about it; the old man was still alive, so he didn’t need to think too much about it.\n“I remember the land we had before was quite large. You don’t need to apply for another one to build your workshop this time, right?”\n“No need. Just continue building the other side.”\nWith her as a prophet, land grants will definitely be granted as soon as possible. It is easy and cheap during this period, so of course they have to be the first to get such a good thing.\nThe first thing she did was assemble TV sets. In the 1990s, several well-known home appliance companies seemed to be joint ventures using ordinary technology. They had no choice but to trade the market for technology.\nSince it is difficult to develop home appliances like air conditioners and color TVs and she does not want foreign capital to control the company, she will start developing simple products herself. Fans, washing machines, rice cookers, stereos, tape recorders…\nShe had her own direction and made preparations in advance. Soon, the foreign partner proposed to take control of her. The US company sent a special person over, and Mr. Shen personally received him outside. Oh no, he was translating for Li Xia. In business talks, Americans are always straightforward.\n“If you don’t agree to our controlling stake, then we can only terminate our cooperation.”\n“You want to hold the controlling stake, so is this factory still mine?”\n“Of course it’s yours. But we have the final say on what products to produce and what brand to put on them.”\n“I can’t even own the trademark anymore. I’m sorry, I can’t accept this condition.”\n“Ms. Li, you have to think carefully. Without our technical support, your factory will be closed immediately.”\n“Then we’ll wait and see.”\nLi Xia smiled and shook her head, firmly refusing. She could already survive independently without relying on him, and she was no longer limited to simple product assembly. The fans had been on the market for a year, and the response to the fans, big and small, was very good, with good quality and a low price.\nShe used their production line and parts to assemble and sell black and white TVs for several years and invested most of the profits in the R&D department. How could she be stuck in this situation for the rest of her life? If she can’t make sophisticated home appliances, then she’ll make simple home appliances.\nShe has her own ideas, and she has discussed them with the old man before. In the past two years, she has invested heavily in research and development, and the old man, as a major shareholder, fully supports her.\nThe domestic economy is booming, and the home appliance market should not be underestimated now or in the future. By the late 1990s, they could start exporting their products, and with excellent quality, Chinese products will definitely stand the test.\n————— Time dividing line—————\nIn 1991, Li Xia’s factory had already occupied a certain market share in small household appliances. With the development of the times, she also recruited more technical talents. This year, they developed a video recorder. Although some core components were still imported, most of them could be produced by themselves. After passing the inspection, they were ready to be put on the market in large quantities.\nHuihua and Shen Hui both went to No. 1 Middle School. Shen Hui got in by himself and was in the top class. Huihua got in because of her special talent and was in the last class. Yiyi was in the third year of junior high school, but the brat skipped a grade, saying that he was wasting time in school. It would be better to take the college entrance examination earlier.\nShen Haiyang made an agreement with him that he had to study hard for three years in high school. He had to learn the knowledge thoroughly; otherwise, he would not do well in the college entrance examination. The boy agreed, and at the age of thirteen, he had already started preparing for the junior high school entrance examination.\n“My brother scored so high, I can’t score lower; otherwise, I will embarrass him.”\nHuihua patted him on the back of the head and said, “You’ll die if you don’t compete with your brother. You pushed me all the way to the top class of No. 1 Middle School. Now that you’ve come in this year, everyone will start to wonder if the top student in that grade is your brother. Your brother is so awesome.”\nShen Ruyi rolled his eyes and sank down on the sofa, looking hopeless. “I can’t live anymore.”\n“Ha ha……”\nShen Huihua is also very good at studying, but she is just a little behind Yi Yi. Because Yiyi is so famous, she has a strong sense of self-esteem and keeps trying to catch up with him, not wanting others to look down on her. Tired? She doesn’t feel tired without Yi Yi, but when she is compared to him, she has to complain about him.\nShe had already seen the gap between her and these two in the painting. She would not compete with them in studying because that would be asking for trouble. She could go to No. 1 Middle School and study art in the future. These two said that if she couldn’t find a job, they would support her for life.\n“Ring, ring, ring …,”\nThe three children were talking when the phone rang. Huihua, who was closest to them, picked it up. But the other party spoke in a foreign language, so she quickly passed the phone to her brother. Her brother learned English from his grandfather and could speak it fluently.\nDuring the conversation, Shen Hui seemed very excited. They only heard a few words from him, and their hands were shaking with nervousness. When Shen Hui put down the phone, he met their inquiring eyes and spoke automatically.\n“The United States has a better way to treat Dad’s illness. Ventricular septal myectomy, they say the technology is already perfect.”\n",
    "80": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c49/\nCHAPTER 49\nOver the years, Li Xia has been preparing for Shen Haiyangâs treatment. Perhaps with divine help, the passports and visas they applied for last year were valid, and good news came. After returning home and listening to what the children said, she immediately called Shen Haiyang and asked him to take a leave.\nGrandpa Shen has been in poor health for many years. Fortunately, he found an old Chinese doctor a few years ago. The old Chinese doctor could not cure this disease, but after years of acupuncture and medicine, the old man was still in good health. But the Western doctor said that he had missed the opportunity for surgery, and even if the surgery could cure it, his body could not bear it.\nShen Haiyang has also been treated by an old Chinese doctor in recent years. He also learned a set of Qigong from the old Chinese doctor. He is a patient and perseverant person. He has never slacked off in the morning or evening for so many years. Itâs really effective. He has survived several instances of discomfort safely.\nâHave you asked for leave?â Li Xia asked anxiously as Shen Haiyang entered the room. She was in charge of the factoryâs water dispenser, which had just passed the quality inspection and was put on the market. The rest of the work would be left to Han Jun.\nâYes.â After a few years, the manâs face became more elegant, and his smile was refreshing. âDonât worry. We have waited for so many years, so it doesnât matter if you wait a little longer.â\nLi Xia took a deep breath and went over the things on hand in her mind. She had to attend a meeting at work tomorrow. She would not be back for a short time, so she had to explain everything clearly.\nâI have a meeting at work tomorrow, so make arrangements as soon as you can. We will leave for Shanghai as soon as possible and transfer to another flight abroad from Shanghai.â\nâOkay.â\nAfter Li Xia finished speaking, she looked back at the three little ones. Shen Hui raised his hand first and said, âDonât worry about us. We can take care of ourselves. Mom, please take good care of Dad along the way. The flight abroad takes a long time, and itâs tiring to sit there.â\nHuihua nodded and then added, âDonât worry about studying; we will arrange it ourselves. The piano exam will be in the second half of the year, and you will definitely be back by then, so it wonât be delayed.â\nâAlthough Iâm about to take the high school entrance exam, you can go ahead, mom and dad.â Yiyi patted his chest and said, âThe exam is not a big deal. I can handle it myself.â\nLi Xia had never worried about the boyâs studies in his past life or in this life. She nodded when she heard it. She didnât care about him in the first place. Her presence or absence would not hinder the boyâs performance.\nâWell, itâs settled then. You guys take care of yourselves.â\nâI know. You can go without worries.â\nYiyi waved his hand carelessly, and Shen Huiâs eyes were filled with worry. After returning to the room, he paced back and forth in the room and took a deep breath, and his mind could not stop worrying. In the evening, Shen Haiyang asked him to go to the study, and he could see the worry in his fatherâs eyes.\nShen Hui is sixteen this year, and at 1.8 meters tall, he already looks like a young man. However, no matter how tall he is, the childishness on his face has not faded. His dark eyes seem to be able to speak, and the blinking of his eyes can let people read the ownerâs emotions. In front of his closest relatives, he still reveals his emotions.\nâdad,â\nShen Haiyang pulled a stool over for him to sit on. âAre you worried about your dad?â\nâYeah.â Shen Hui said as he took a deep breath. âDad, keep going. Iâll be waiting for you to come back safely at home.â\nAs age increases, hypertrophic myocardium will continue to thicken, and the condition will become more serious. Because of his fatherâs illness, he has specifically looked up information on this aspect and knows that surgery is imperative at this time. The United States has developed medical care and mature technology, but when it comes to his turn, he still canât help but worry.\nShen Haiyang stood up and gave his son a hug. âThatâs right, be brave. You are already sixteen years old, and you will be a full adult in two years. Be independent in doing things, and donât be stubborn.â\nThough his son has been doing much better these years, as a father, Shen Haiyang is still worried about his son. He has completely believed what Li Xia told him about his past life, and what he is most worried about is the entanglement between his son and Murong Danling.\nBut since Murong Danling went into business, her life has been thriving. Not only did she not bother him anymore, she even seemed to have forgotten that she had a son. She was only focused on making money, and heÂ  heard that she lived a carefree life and was a frequent visitor to the dance hall.\nâIf, Daddy is talking about ifâs. If Daddy has any problems, you must listen to Mommy. Donât be instigated by others; donât believe in other peopleâs nonsense. If you encounter problems, discuss them with Mommy; donât be impulsive.â\nShen Hui nodded with tears in his eyes. âI know. I was young at that time, and I remember how my mother treated me over the years. I know. I have long regarded her as my own mother and will never doubt her for anything again.â\nâThen Dad will be relieved. Remember, if Mom does something that you canât understand, you must talk to her properly, and donât hold it in and dwell on it.â\nâOkay, I will remember.â\nAfter leaving the main room, he lifted the curtain and entered the east room. Yiyi was sitting in the small hall in the middle, reading a book. When he heard the noise, he raised his head, stood up, and pulled him over to sit down.\nâBrother, did Dad talk to you?â After asking and seeing Shen Hui nod, he continued one by one.\nâDad is under a lot of pressure himself. You didnât say anything to make him worry, did you?â\nâProbably not. I said I would wait for him to come back safely.â\nShen Hui thought about it; he didnât say anything he shouldnât have said. But no one knows a son better than his father. He tried hard to pretend that nothing happened, but he probably couldnât fool his fatherâs eyes. His father was still worried about him.\nâThatâs good. I just discussed with my sister that we should go to the temple in Xishan to pray for Dadâs safety and blessings. I heard from those aunts that the temple in Xishan is very effective. Now there is a direct bus to that place. Letâs take the bus and then climb the mountain.â\nâOK.â\nâWhat are you talking about? Are you talking about our trip to Xishan?â\nAs she was talking, Huihua came in. The little girl had grown into a graceful lady. Her facial features were not like those of Li Xia or Fang Zhongcheng, but somewhat similar to those of Shen Haiyang. People who were familiar with her said that they looked like each other, with clear eyes and gentle features, and she looked like a lady in her quietness.\nâYes. Sister, please bring some money with you; otherwise, we will be left stranded without money for a ride, and mom will have to pick us up.â\nYiyi âs pocket money is all with his sister. Huihua nodded when she heard this. âI know. I will prepare food and drinks. You guys should get up early tomorrow.â\nThe three children agreed to go to a classmateâs house the next day and left one after another with their schoolbags on their backs. Li Xia was also busy attending a meeting at work and had no time to find out what they were doing.\nShe was busy in a meeting at work in the morning, arranging the next work. âDonât worry, Iâll call you when I get there and give you the contact information. If you canât make a decision, just call me.â\nHan Jun breathed a sigh of relief: âOkay. Remember to call me when you get there.â\nâgood.â\nâIâll drive you there tomorrow.â\nâOkay.â\nAfter saying goodbye to Han Jun, Li Xia drove home, took out the suitcase, and opened the cabinet to pack their clothes. Shen Haiyang also went to the unit to hand it over to his colleagues and came back at noon.\nâWhy havenât the children come back from their classmateâs house yet? They seem so mysterious; are they up to something?â\nâWhat can they do? They are old enough; they wonât cause trouble. Besides, Huihua is there; they canât cause any big trouble with her there.â\nThatâs right, Huihua has always been the most well-behaved. When she was around, anything she agreed to was definitely not something to mess with. The couple smiled, packed their luggage, and ate lunch without waiting for the children.\nBy the time they woke up from their nap, the three were nowhere to be seen. Li Xia was a little anxious, thinking about how good it would be to have a cell phone. Just as she was getting anxious, the three came back. However, their clothes and pants were stained, especially at the knees, where Yiyi and Shen Huiâs pants were torn, revealing their skin. Huihuaâs pants were wear-resistant, but they were also too thin to be worn through.\nâWhatâs wrong with your forehead and the clothes on your body?â Shen Haiyang asked.\nâCould they have gone to the Xishan Temple to kowtow?â Li Xia had also heard of that place. It was obvious from the looks of the three of them that they had gone there to kowtow.\nThe three little ones nodded obediently, and Shen Hui took out a triangular yellow paper package from his arms, tied with a red string. âDad, this is the amulet we prayed for you.â\nShen Haiyang was a little shocked and felt deeply shocked. He spoke one by one: âDad, hurry up and continue. This is what the three of us prayed for together. We kowtowed all the way from the mountain gate to the main hall. If we are sincere, it will definitely work. My brother kowtowed so hard that his forehead was swollen.â In fact, the foreheads of the three people were swollen.\nHuihua also nodded. âDad, they say that one blessing is there on each and every step of the way, and we pray for it all the way sincerely. We hope Dad will return safely.â\nShen Haiyangâs outstretched hand was trembling, and he couldnât speak at all. Not to mention that he was greatly shocked, Li Xia beside him began to wipe away tears.\nYou stinky kids, they did what she had thought about but she had no time to do. Although some people think this is superstition, when science cannot guarantee the lives of their loved ones, they would rather believe in superstition.\nâPut it on; the children are all sincere.â\nShen Haiyang was given the yellow amulet by his wife, and he looked at the three children, not knowing what to say. Going to the temple to ask for an amulet was a little unexpected, but it was generally normal.\nLi Xia was busy in the past few years, so he took care of the children more and had a deep relationship with them. But he never expected that the three of them would kowtow every time they took a step. How deep must the relationship and expectations be to do this?\nâDad, you must come back safely.â\nHuihua is a girl who is delicate, gentle, and soft-hearted. She couldnât help crying after she said a word. She quickly reached out to wipe it away, thinking it was unlucky. She was worried when she heard the news yesterday, especially because the operation was still abroad, and she was even more worried because she couldnât see it. She didnât dare talk to her father, for fear that she would burst into tears as soon as she opened her mouth.\nâOkay, okay, it feels like a life-and-death separation. Donât worry; Dad will come back and be safe. I will take you out to play during the holidays, and you wonât have a bad time.â\nShen Haiyang spoke and dispersed the strong feeling of separation. The children smiled and chattered, and they no longer talked about their worries. One by one, they promised to stay at home and let them go abroad for treatment without worry.\nAfter packing their luggage, Han Jun drove them to the train station the next day. They took a sleeper to Shanghai and then flew abroad. When buying the ticket, Li Xia considered buying a business-class ticket. Shen Haiyang was in poor health, and it was too tiring to sit in economy class.\nAfter buying the ticket and waiting in the departure lounge, she took out a water cup from her bag and gave it to him. After drinking it, Shen Haiyang wanted to fill it, but Li Xia stopped him and told him that she would go. Looking at her back, the man smiled softly. She has been taking care of him to the best of her ability for so many years. He is so lucky to have her accompany him in this life.\nHe was bored and took a magazine to read. Time passed very quickly when he was reading. When he looked up again, his wife had not come back yet. He couldnât help but wonder, Where did she go to get water?\nâHaiyang, Haiyang,â she said, coming back with a cup of water just as he was worried about her. She hurried over to him, sat down, and continued in a low voice, âGuess who I saw?â\nâwho?â\nâMurong Danlingâs sister.â\nâWhy is she here?â\nâI donât know. She was sneaking around in the bathroom with a woman. She was carrying a big bag, and they seemed to be trading something. But what was it? Why were they hiding it so much?â\nâYou didnât go and see?â\nLi Xia smiled. No one knows a wife better than her husband. He knew she would go to see it even without saying anything. âShe gave the bag to that woman. The woman was holding a boarding pass. She was on the same flight as us.â\nâGo to the United States? Or rather, go back to the United States.â\nâIt should be. I heard her speaking a foreign language to people.â\nâWhat about Murong Danfeng?â\nâLetâs go. Weâre heading towards the exit.â\nShen Haiyang pondered for a while, âDonât worry about it; there is security at the airport. These will be strictly checked.â\nâoh.â\nShe was really curious: what exactly is Murong Danfeng trading with foreigners? And she heard her say sheâd trade here again next time.\nâLetâs go; board the plane.â\nâoh.â\nThe two of them boarded the plane with their luggage. The woman from before was no longer seen in the business class. It was the first time for both of them to take a plane. After the novelty wore off, Shen Haiyang leaned back and closed his eyes to rest. She felt bored and followed suit.\nThe flight lasted more than eight hours, and they had a meal once during the flight. When they landed, it was 4 a.m., US time. They carried their luggage through a security check, and Shen Haiyang was in charge of communication. He had learned foreign languages from his father over the years, and his oral and written skills were not weak.\nThere was no language barrier, and they got out quickly. They went to the airport to find a bus to the city, and on the way, they met the woman who had made a deal with Murong Danfeng. The woman was still holding the bag in her hand, and after meeting a man, she opened the bag to show him. The two of them were talking very fast, and Li Xia could hardly keep up.\nThe man took out some of the things in the bag, rubbed them, and put them back, then got into a car with the woman. Li Xia asked Shen Haiyang what they talked about, and the man looked heavy.\nâDid you see whatâs in the bag?â\nâItâs not very clear.â\nâThey said it was a bronze artifact, but I donât know if itâs a national cultural relic.â\nâOh. Itâs an antique shop opened by Murong Danfeng. What kind of antiques are considered cultural relics?â The sisters of the Murong family now mostly follow Murong Danling to do business. Once Murong Danling is involved in something, they always feel that something is wrong.\nâIâm not too sure. Iâm so far away that I donât know whatâs inside. I canât be sure. Itâs illegal to resell cultural relics, but since it passed the airport security check, it might be a normal antique. Or a replica?â\nMurong Danfeng runs an antique shop and has an antique business license, but because of this incident, the couple canât help but think too much.\nBecause of what they saw, both of them were thinking and didnât say much. They went all the way to the city center. They found a hotel to stay at. Li Xia was shocked by how expensive things were here. Staying in a hotel was much more expensive than in a city like Shanghai.\nCheck in and get the key. Li Xia didnât say a word the whole time; she had enough money with her. She just smacked her lips and complained silently, not saying anything out loud.\nAfter taking a shower, Shen Haiyang pondered for a long time before picking up the receiver and making an international call. He told a friend what he had seen and asked him to pay attention to Murong Danfengâs antique shop.\nAfter taking a shower and resting for the night, they first found Father Shenâs good friend the next morning. Under his guidance, they went to the bank to withdraw money and then went to the hospital for hospitalization.\nâFederal Hospital is the best hospital in the United States.â\nAfter going in for a checkup, they asked for payment. One hundred and twenty thousand dollars. Li Xia nodded immediately. As long as it can be cured, itâs fine. The old man had saved two hundred thousand dollars back then. The principal plus interest over the years is more than enough now.\nIn a capitalist country, everything is easy if you have money. She arranged hospitalization, a series of examinations, and then waited for the operation. Although the arrangement time was a bit long, Li Xia felt very conflicted. She wanted to go as fast as possible, but she was afraid to go to the operating room right away. There was still some time left, so she was worried and enjoyed it at the same time.\nSitting in front of the bed, she peeled an apple for him, cut it into small pieces with a knife, and asked him to eat it with toothpicks. Shen Haiyangâs helpless smile was filled with deep happiness.\nâYou are not even that careful with our children.â\nâChildren are nothing. They will all be gone in a few years. We are the ones who will grow old together and be together for life.â\nShen Haiyang agreed with this, nodded, and smiled at his wife. He insisted on exercising these years, hoping to grow old with her. Now it really works. The doctor said that his lung function was good, so he could better support the operation.\nâWhat do you want to eat for lunch?â\nâwhatever.â\nThey were both not used to Western food. These days, Li Xia has bought him some meat and other things. She was used to it since she was a child and thought that meat was nutritious. But she didnât like the cooking method of Western food, so she thought about whether she could find a place where she could cook. There was still some time before the operation, and he had to rest well after the operation. How could he survive without eating well?\nâIâm going to go out and rent an apartment or something where I can cook. It might take a long time for me to be gone, so donât worry about you in the hospital.â\nShen Haiyang reached out and held her. His wife acted quickly and said, âDonât worry. Iâll look in the newspaper to see if there is any rental information. Then you can call them first. If itâs suitable, we can go and find them directly.â\nâOh, thatâs a good idea. I was worried that with my current level, I would become mute and would have to use my hands to gesture.â Li Xia said.\nShen Haiyang smiled and went out to the nursesâ station to find some newspapers. As expected, there was information about renting a house in the newspaper. He used the wardâs phone to start contacting people. He wanted to find one near the hospital. It didnât matter how old it was, as long as it could cook.\nThey successfully rented an apartment near the Federal Hospital. The apartment was less than 20 square meters, only big enough for one person. Moreover, the landlord required a one-time deposit of 10% and a four-month payment. Li Xia and her family could not live there for such a long time. But she rented the apartment without hesitation. Although the apartment was small, it had everything you needed, you could cook, and it was very close and convenient.\nLi Xia immediately went to the supermarket to buy ingredientsâbeef, tomatoes, and onionsâand went home to stew a pot of beef and tomatoes. It simmered for two hours, during which time she also steamed flower rolls, and when she packed it up, she mixed a cucumber and lettuce salad.\nÂ Â  Â  Â  (stew a pot of beef and tomatoes)\nÂ Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â (steamed flower rolls)\nShe went out with her lunch box, and not far away she saw a familiar figure. Shen Yaozong, is he in the United States? She thought this guy had moved so much money and fled to other countries. Maybe she was dazzled.\nWhile she was thinking, her legs had their own thoughts and followed the figure.\nThe man was wearing casual clothes and a hat. She changed her angle several times, but she couldnât see his face clearly. She followed him for a long distance without realizing it.\nÂ \n",
    "81": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c49-2/\nâShen Yaozong,â\nShe called out in a hurry, and the other person turned around subconsciously. It was him; it was really this guy. Li Xia walked towards him with her lunch box, and the other person also recognized her and ran away.\nâDonât run. Stop right there.â\nOne ran, and the other chased. The two staged a chase on the streets of the United States. Li Xia was in good physical condition and ran very fast. However, she was not familiar with the terrain and did not understand some road signs. Therefore, she lost the other partyâs trace after chasing for two streets.\nâItâs so cold. There are so many people on the street, but no one helped me.â\nShe stopped and took a deep breath. People around her looked at her curiously and then went about their business. Having lost track of them, she had no choice but to go back. When she caught her breath, she realized she was lost.\nâOh my god, where is this?â\nShe had no other choice but to ask for directions, but her hearing level was better when people spoke slowly in China, but people in foreign countries spoke too fast, and she couldnât understand them at all. She could only tell people over and over again that she wanted to go to the Federal Hospital, hoping to meet a kind person who could give her directions.\nDonât mention it; she really encountered it. A Chinese guy gestured to her to show her the way, and seeing that she was confused, he simply grabbed her sleeve.\nâIâll take you,â\nLi Xia felt very familiar with the young man who could speak Chinese. She returned to the Federal Hospital under the guidance of the young man. She thanked him and then entered the building with her lunch box.\nâYou actually went after Shen Yaozong? Youâre so brave; what if you get lost?â\nLi Xia smiled as she served him some rice: âItâs just that I got lost. This guy always ran around in corners. After a while, I couldnât see him anymore, and I got lost too.â\nâThen how did you get back?â\nâThereâs a mouth under your nose, so I asked.â She laughed. âA young man gestured to me for a long time, but I still couldnât understand, so he brought me here.â\nâFortunately, fortunately.â Shen Haiyang took the bowl from her hand and said, âShen Yaozongâs economic case has exceeded the statute of limitations, so itâs useless to arrest him. Next time you see him, ignore him.â\nâOh, is that so?â\nâright.â\nâBut the old man is old; I think he must want to meet this man. I am not chasing him for the money. So much time has passed, and our crisis has long passed. Just think that he took his share of the property in advance. Isnât that what the old man thinks? The rest is all yours, and he has no share.â\nAs a child and a parent, Shen Haiyang can understand his fatherâs heart. Although his father didnât tell him for so many years, he must want to know whether he is safe and where he is in the world. Life has come to an end, and everything has been let go. Money canât be brought with you when you are born, and it canât be taken with you when you die. After all these years after the crisis, he no longer holds a grudge.\nâIf you meet him again, just yell at him. Itâs his business whether he listens or not.â\nâMaybe heâs hiding and will never be seen again.â\nâHe will never feel at ease in his life because he has a guilty conscience.â\nâI hope he has a good conscience, thinks of his father, and goes back to visit him.â\nAfter that, Li Xia never saw Shen Yaozong again. She ran back and forth between the rented house and the hospital every day. More than ten days later, when Shen Haiyang had surgery, she was restless outside the operating room. The doctor asked her to sign a consent form and informed her of the risks of the surgery. If he couldnât get off the operating table, he would be gone, without even a chance to say goodbye.\nThe day before the operation, she went to the doctorâs office accompanied by her father-in-lawâs friend. When she talked about all this, she felt that her heart was wrapped in an invisible hand. As the situation deepened, her face was completely pale when she returned to the ward.\nShen Haiyang was shocked when he saw her. She, a normal person, looked weaker than him, a patient. âWhatâs wrong? Are you scared by the doctor?â He reached out to her and hugged her. After coming to the United States, the foreigners he met were very open, and he now had more body movements.\nâDonât be afraid. Doctors love to exaggerate. They even say the probability is one in a thousand or one in ten thousand. In reality, it is impossible to be so dangerous.â\nLi Xia reached out and hugged his waist back without saying a word. Her heart was filled with heavy affection, and she felt that no words could express it.\nIn her previous life, Fang Zhongcheng hurt her. When she thought about it in the silence of night, she thought that she would be cremated after death, and her ashes would be scattered in the mountains. Rural people still think of burial. After her death, she had no husband and no ancestral grave. Her bones would be crushed and her ashes would beÂ  scattered, and she would never come back to this world again.\nBut she married him in this life, and they have been together for so many years. He always supports and helps her in everything. If there is a problem, he will discuss it and find a solution with her. If the children have any psychological problems, he will intervene in time. Now he is going to the operating room. When she thinks of the possible dangers, her hands and feet are numb with worry.\nWithout him, her life would be black and white. Without color, whatâs the point of living? âYou must keep working hard. We came here together, and we must go back together. Otherwise, I wonât be able to pass the security check with my foreign language level.â\nâOkay, letâs go home together.â\nWhen he was sent to the operating room, she was so nervous that her hands and feet were shaking. Her father-in-lawâs friend accompanied her, smiled, and said that they had a good relationship.\nâItâs almost noon. Iâll bring you whatever you want to eat.â The man was very gentlemanly and took good care of her.\nâNo, I have no appetite. Jerry, go eat by yourself; Iâll just wait here.â\nâOh, itâs okay, Iâll stay with you.â\nThe two waited until after 2 a.m., when the lights in the operating room finally went out. Li Xia stood anxiously at the door of the operating room, wishing she had X-ray vision so she could see inside.\nFinally, the door was opened from the inside, and the medical staff came out. Jerry talked to them, and Li Xia understood that the operation went smoothly, and finally she felt relieved.\nAfter the doctor left, Jerry congratulated her: âAs long as he doesnât do any particularly strenuous exercise, he can live like a normal person in the future and donât have to worry about it. The results of the previous follow-up cases were very good. If you pay attention, there shouldnât be any major problems in the future.â\nâthanks, thanks.â\nApart from these two words, she could not say anything else. She could not help but shed tears of excitement. Jerry handed her a tissue, and she wiped her tears and cried and laughed.\nâOkay, itâs okay.â\nThe operation was successful, and the heavy stone in her heart was finally removed. Li Xia then took good care of her husband. This kind of operation usually takes seven or eight days to be discharged from the hospital. A week later, Shen Haiyang recovered well.\nâItâs only 20 minutes from here to the apartment. I donât feel comfortable with you taking such a long flight.â\nDuring this period, large incisions were made, and heart surgery opened up the entire chest cavity. Recovery was more difficult than minimally invasive surgery in later generations. After listening to Shen Haiyangâs retelling of the doctorâs words, she began to make suggestions.\nShen Haiyang nodded and didnât argue with her. He knew his own body. After the operation, he no longer had that faint feeling of chest tightness, but his legs were weak. His body really needed to recover.\nAfter being discharged from the hospital, the two of them squeezed into a small apartment of more than ten square meters. The small space was decorated by Li Xia to be very cozy. The floor and walls could not be moved, and she changed the bedding and curtains to the colors they liked.\nThey woke up naturally in the morning and saw each other as soon as they opened their eyes in the quiet space. They were a reconstituted family, with children as soon as they got together, so itâs the first time for them to spend time alone without anyone disturbing. It feels really good.\nAfter lunch, they took a short nap and went out hand in hand in the evening. They walked hand in hand on the tree-lined path, looking up to see each otherâs smiling faces. The sun shone through the shade of the trees, and it seemed like a peaceful time.\nLi Xia already called home to inform them that the surgery was successful, but no one has called to disturb them in the past few days. It may also be that international long-distance calls are too expensive, and everyone is stingy and doesnât want toÂ Â  waste the money.\nThey put their minds at ease and lived a quiet life. Time seemed to slow down. After so many years of hard work, Li Xia finally had the chance to enjoy life.\nâWhen we get old, how about we find a small town to live in? A water town in the south of the Yangtze River with a mild climate, mountains, and water. We can grow some vegetables, raise some chickens, and just slowly enjoy life.â\nShen Haiyang turned and nodded at her. âOkay. When I retire, weâll go wherever you like.â\nâSo we have to work for another ten years?â\nThe man laughed at her dissatisfied tone and reached out to touch her hair. âYour job will probably have to wait until Yiyi graduates from university; otherwise, there will be no one to take over.â\nâThat little brat can come work for me while he is in college. He canât be idle during the winter and summer vacations.â\nYiyi âs scores for this yearâs high school entrance exam have not come out yet. The couple is not looking forward to the results at all, as the boy has never had to worry about his studies since he was a child.\nWalking and chatting, the slow life felt very comfortable after adapting. Li Xia met a Chinese woman and found a Chinese supermarket under her guidance. The supermarket has basic daily necessities for Chinese people. Many ingredients and seasonings that Westerners donât eat can be bought here.\nShe cooked delicious food for her husband in various ways. After a month, he looked rosy-cheeked and a little fatter than before. Seeing that he had recovered well, Li Xia returned the house, bought a plane ticket, and packed her luggage for the return trip.\nItâs the last night here, and she felt reluctant to leave when she lied on the bed. Although they stayed here for a short time, the time they spent alone was so slow and warm that it made her nostalgic.\nThe two turned over and faced each other, smiling at each other without saying anything. After living together for so many years, there is a tacit understanding that is more silent than words.\nThe next day, they took a taxi to the airport and were taken back to their motherland by plane. They still transferred from Shanghai, found a place to rest for a night after getting off the plane, and took the train back to the provincial capital the next day.\nLi Xia was carrying the luggage, while Shen Haiyang was empty-handed. As soon as they got off the train, they saw Han Jun. The man took the luggage from Li Xiaâs hand and smiled heartily at his best friend, happy for him. He wanted to pat him, but he took his hand back. He had just had surgery not long ago, so donât be reckless.\nâYouâre back just in time. Thereâs new progress in the R&D department. Iâll tell you when you come back. Oh, and your youngest son ranked first in the high school entrance exam. No. 1 Middle School and No. 2 Middle School have both called to try to get him in. No. 2 Middle School offered to waive all tuition and miscellaneous fees, and No. 1 Middle School also said a certain amount would be waived.â\nIt had only been a short while since they had been living a leisurely life together, and now the trivialities of life were coming upon them. Well, it was not time for her to retire. She was not used to not taking care of anything during this period.\nâIâll go to work tomorrow and notify the R&D department to hold a meeting. Yiyi can choose his own school. He can go wherever he wants. I donât need the money for his education.â\nWhen they got in the car and went home, the three kids were waiting at the door. Shen Hui was so excited to look at his father that he held his fatherâs arm. Yiyi was on the other side, and Huihua was holding a bouquet of fresh carnations.\nâYou two are such idiots. How can Daddy accept my flowers if you are like this?â\nThe two sons let go of Shen Haiyang with a smile, and Huihua handed the flowers to him. The three children said together, âWelcome home, Dad.â\nâThank you, kids.â\nShen Haiyangâs disease was effectively controlled, and the old man breathed a sigh of relief. Li Xia did not tell him about what she saw in the United States. If Shen Yaozong does not come to see him, he will feel bad in his heart.\nThe illness was cured, the leave was finished, and life returned to normal. Shen Haiyangâs position changed after he arrived at the unit, and he was transferred to the Anti-Corruption Bureau. When he got home and told Li Xia about it, she smiled happily because he had gotten a promotion.\nâThereâs still a chance to show your talents. Congratulations.â\nMen still care a lot about their careers, and when they are in good health, they will definitely want to develop better. Shen Haiyang was very happy about this, and at night, Li Xia suddenly remembered to ask him about Murong Danfeng.\nâThe police are currently following up.â\nâIf you canât tell me, then donât tell me. Iâm worried about Huihui. Itâs already 1991, and the newspaper I saw said it was the spring of 1992. Although they havenât had much contact in these years, who knows? But this time point still makes me worried.â\nâProbably not. Huihui is very stable now and wonât act impulsively.â\nâI hope she gives up, doesnât show up again, and doesnât think of her son no matter what happens.â\nIn the evening, Li Xia met Murong Danling at the restaurant the next day. Li Xia invited several clients to dinner here, and she should have the same purpose. She was carrying a bag in her hand and dressing fashionably and beautifully.\nThe two passed each other without saying anything. After the drinking party was over, Li Xia met Murong Danling again. To be honest, she really didnât know what business the other party had been doing over the years. The shop was sold a few years ago, and carrying a bag every day reminded her of that new term, a shell company.\nWhen she was leaving, the waiter handed her a flyer. After she got in the car, she took it out and saw that it was a property developed in Xicheng. It was on pre-sale and would be completed in April next year.\nThere are two apartment types printed on the flyer: a two-bedroom apartment and a three-bedroom apartment.\nThere are two types of rooms, some large and some small. The price per square meter varies according to the floor, and the highest is no more than 800. The location is really good. It is close to the key primary school and not far from the city hospital.\nâQin Mu, are you buying a house? Didnât you say before that you wanted to buy a house? Let me show you this.â\nShe entered the yard and called out, and Qin Mu came out of the kitchen. She wiped her hands on her apron, took the flyer from her hand, and looked at it carefully. After studying it for a long time, she saw Li Xia coming out after washing up, and she looked up to ask Li Xia for her opinion.\nâWhat do you think of this house?â\nâI think itâs a good idea. Go home and talk to your husband, and buy a house as soon as possible. Donât mess around. In the end, you wonât save any money, and the appreciation of the house will be prohibitive.â\nLi Xia now speaks with a leadership tone, and Qin Mu nodded when she heard her. She silently calculated how much money she had and whether the family had enough money.\nAt dinner that night, Shen Hui said, âI have a physics competition tomorrow, and the exam site is a bit far away. Mom, do you have time to take me there? Iâm afraid it will take time to go back and forth on the bus.â\nâOkay, Iâll take you there.â\nLi Xia turned to look at Shen Haiyang and asked, âIs it okay to buy you a car?â\nThe man met her expectant gaze and said, âGive me your old car, and you can buy a new one yourself.â\nThis person has always been low-key. Li Xia nodded in agreement. Motorcycles were popular in the 1990s. The number of bicycles on the streets was decreasing, and the number of motorcycles was increasing day by day. Good motorcycles were not cheap, and young people liked the cool feeling.\nâHow about buying you a motorcycle too?â\nShen Haiyang looked at her helplessly: âHow old am I?â\nâOkay, Iâll buy it for Huihui later.â\nâMom, I donât want a motorcycle.â\nLi Xia looked up at the child and said, âNo. Okay, buy it for Yiyi then.â\nShen Ruyi looked up at the ceiling. âItâll take another five years.â\nIn the end, Li Xia didnât spend the money. When she made the bed that night, she murmured, âIs it because you and your son donât like speed and excitement like motorcycles, or is it because youâre getting old?â\nâWhoâs old?â\nLi Xia turned around and smiled at her husband, throwing him a flirtatious glance provocatively. âIf youâre not old, prove it.â\nThe recovery from the surgery was very good. The doctorâs advice was that he could have a normal married life in two months, which was long overdue. He also continued to practice Taoist Qigong and felt that he was no different from a young man. His wife had clearly invited him, and he would not be a man if he didnât go.\nBeing pressed on the bed by her husband, the woman laughed softly. This guyâs heart is fine; he is full of energy. She rejected him before because she was afraid that he had not recovered well, but today she saw him coming in and teased him on purpose.\nAfter the deed, she lay there feeling happy and didnât want to move, letting him hand her the paper. âThereâs a property thatâs opening soon; what do you think about us buying two houses?â\nâWhy do you want to buy so many houses?â\nâOne floor for two households, buy two three-bedroom apartments and connect them for us to live in, and connect the two-bedroom apartment for the old man. He and a nanny will have independent space without being crowded. The building has heating in the bathroom, which makes living convenient and comfortable.â\nâThe houses over there are going to be demolished soon, so thereâs no need to buy these houses.â\nLi Xia sat up and said, âReally? How did you know?â\nâThe news from the city construction department should be correct.â\nThe pillow came when she was sleepy. This time, she wanted to buy an apartment. However, there were only two two-bedroom apartments to be demolished there, so she still planned to buy a house. Donât buy a building, but buy a villa for the old man.\nThe next day, Li Xia drove Shen Hui to participate in the physics competition. The trip went smoothly. She waited outside after the child entered the examination room.\nThere were a few parents outside the examination room. People in this period did not attach as much importance to learning as they did in later generations. Another reason was that many candidates were from other places and were brought here by their teachers. She found a shady place, and when she looked up, she found a huge billboard opposite.\nâThe designated beverage for the Asian Games is Coca-Cola.â\nCoca-Colaâs advertisements are so popular. They are on TV, and there is such a big billboard here. She looked up at the advertisement and was thinking about something. She didnât see Murong Danling driving by. After glancing at her, Murong Danling saw the school behind her.\nOut of curiosity, she went home to ask what was going on here today, and the answer she got was that it was a high school physics competition. All the top students in the province gathered here. Physics competition,\nTop student? Who is taking the test, Shen Hui? Is he such a good student?\n",

The child has grown into a young man, 1.85 meters tall. Sitting in the passenger seat, the mother and son began to chat.\nâMom, Yiyi is ranked first in the grade again in the initial test.â\nâReally? That brat didnât say that.â\nâHeâs used to it, so he doesnât bother to talk about it.â\nLi Xia looked back at her eldest son. Shen Hui leaned back in his chair and sighed. âI wanted to suggest that someone else come to the physics competition this time. But itâs all Shen Ruyiâs fault.â\nThis statement seemed to be made in anger, but in fact it was full of complaints. Without waiting for Li Xia to say anything, he continued.\nâOur teacher said: Shen Hui, Shen Ruyi, who skipped a grade in high school, is your younger brother. Your younger brother ranked first in the grade. Isnât it unreasonable for you not to win a place for our class in the physics competition?â\nLi Xia smiled, knowing that the child was just complaining, not hating Yi Yi. Every time the teacher compared him with Yi Yi, he would complain. This child is much more cheerful than in previous years. He would joke with her and complain about her own son without any scruples. He treated her as his own mother, and there was no barrier between them when dealing with things.\nâYou are the top student in physics in the class. If the teacher doesnât let you participate, who else can? And you still blame Yiyi for this?â\nShen Hui smiled, knowing that his mother was teasing him. But every time he was told about his younger brother, who skipped a grade, he was helpless and had nothing to say. He was very competitive and had been studying hard. But with Yiyi chasing after him, he felt more urgent and would complain every time. It seemed like he was releasing pressure in this way.\nâMom, I heard thereâs a Sichuan hotpot restaurant on Xihu Road. How about we go there someday?â\nâOkay, today is fine too.â\nâThen letâs go home and pick them up, and then go find dad at his workplace.â\nâOkay. You go to the hot pot restaurant and reserve a seat first. Iâll go get them.â\nAfter driving to the hot pot restaurant and dropping him off to reserve a seat, Li Xia drove home. After entering, she went to the backyard first, where the old man was leisurely drinking tea. The tea soup was so light that you couldnât see the color, but with two leaves of tea, it was considered a tea tasting and satisfied her craving.\nâDad, Huihui said we should go eat Sichuan hotpot. Letâs go; Iâll help you.â\nThe old man raised his head and waved his hand: âYou guys go by yourselves; Iâm not going.â\nâWhy? Sichuan hotpot tastes different from northern hotpot. Itâs spicy, fresh, and delicious. If you have a sore throat and donât like spicy food, then we can have a shabu-shabu pot.â\nThe old man smiled. âDo they have sesame paste?â\nâLast time I had it dipped in oil, Well, isnât this just a change of taste? Why do you want sesame sauce? If you insist on sesame sauce, then next time weâll have northern-style braised lamb with plenty of sesame sauce.â\nâThen wait until next time.â\nâdad,â\nThe old man waved his hand and said, âI really wonât go. Iâll just stay at home.â\nHe has been less and less active recently. Qin Muâs meals are to his liking, so he eats more than when he was abroad, and he has gained weight in the past few years. Li Xia wanted him to move around, but maybe he really had a heart problem, so she didnât dare to force him.\nâOkay, we will go out to eat then.â\nâGo ahead, go ahead. Ask Qin Mu to go with you. I can eat at home by myself.â\nShe went to the front yard to call the others. In the west room, her daughter was sitting in front of a painting frame, her face calm and gentle. Her daughterâs appearance in this life has not changed, but her temperament and knowledge are incomparable to those in the previous life.\nShe called her daughter to change her clothes and went out to the kitchen. âQin Mu, get everything ready for the old man. Letâs go eat hot pot. The old man asked you to come with us.â\nQin Mu made egg custard, millet pumpkin porridge, minced meat and eggplant, and mushroom tofu for the old man. At this time, it was basically ready.\nâNo, Iâll stay at home with the old man.â\nâYour meal is ready, and the old man wants you to come with us.â\nQin Mu refused. She knew what she was doing in this family. They had been getting along well for so many years, and they knew the right balance between the two. âNo, you go by yourselves.â\nâThen Iâll bring you your favorite cake when I come back.â\nQin Mu is very considerate of the elderly. She was so considerate when taking care of her parents-in-law before, and now she is also so kind to the old man. The old man has nothing to give back; he just has a lot of money. Usually the salary is very high, and he gives big red envelopes whenever he gets the chance during festivals and birthdays.\nAfter the old man said this, Qin Mu felt that she had to take better care of him. With two good things, the relationship would naturally become closer and closer. She was also very polite to Qin Mu and gave her enough respect.\nShe drove to Shen Haiyangâs workplace. As soon as he got off work, he saw his car, so he didnât ride his bike but walked over and got in the passenger seat.\nâAny plans for today?â\nâHuihui said thereâs a new Sichuan hotpot restaurant, so letâs go eat together. Heâs already gone to reserve a seat.â\nâSichuan hotpot is very spicy and numbing. Can you get used to it?â\nâYou can have a shabu-shabu hotpot.â\nYiyi chimed in from the back: âA classmate of mine is from Sichuan, and he said the hotpot there is better than the lamb hotpot in the north.â\nâOkay, letâs try it.â\nA family of five went to eat hot pot. When they got off the bus, a girl was kneeling on the roadside opposite the restaurant. She was wearing a shirt that was so old that it turned white, and her pants were patched at the hips. In front of her was a large piece of cloth with words written on it.\nThe family of four were all attracted by the scene. Instead of entering the restaurant, they came closer to take a closer look at what was going on.\nâMy name is Wang Fang. I grew up with my mother for many years because my parents divorced. My mother is sick and in the hospital and urgently needsâ As she got closer, she heard someone next to her reading the words above in a low voice.\nA single-parent family asked for help. Li Xia didnât know whether it was true or not. She has been doing charity work over the years and has donated a lot of money every year, much of which was used to help students. This girl has good handwriting, and her head is lowered but her back is straight. If it is true, she needs to be helped.\nâMom and Dad, why donât you go in now that youâre here?â\nThere were several people surrounding them, but Shen Hui saw Shen Haiyang and Li Xia at a glance when he came out of the hot pot restaurant. He asked curiously, walked in and saw the girl surrounded in the middle, and then fixed his eyes on her.\nLi Xia looked back at him with a look of shock. Could it be that they knew each other? The girl kept her head down because of the gazes of others. There were a few cents of change in the small bowl in front of her.\nWithout figuring out what was going on, Li Xia did nothing. She reached out and pulled the father and son into the store, and Huihua and Yiyi quickly followed. They sat down in the store and ordered food, and Shen Hui was a little absent-minded during this time.\nHanding the menu to the waiter, she asked, âDo you know her?â\nThe child nodded at her and said, â She was in the same grade as mine, a classmate from Class 8.â\nâThen do you know about her family situation?â\nâI donât know. I saw that her clothes were very old. I heard that she dropped out of school when school started this year. Her classmates said that her family was not well off, and her mother was a sanitation worker sweeping the streets. I heard from her classmates that once they saw her accompanying her mother to sweep the streets.â\nâSo it seems to be true?â\nYiyi nodded. âSo she is quite pitiful. Mom, shall we help her?â\nLi Xia picked up the teacup and took a sip of water. âHow do you want to help?â\nâYou mean you donât care and let me figure it out on my own?â\nLi Xia rolled her eyes at him: âWhat else? You said you wanted to help, but if you donât care, do you want me to care? Should I help or you?â\nâIâll find a way if I can.â\nThe brat made a bold statement. Li Xia and Shen Haiyang looked at each other and smiled, waiting for the result. The hot pot was served soon. Today, they ordered a slightly spicy hot pot, which Li Xia really enjoyed after tasting.\nâWhy didnât Aunt Mu and Grandpa come?â Shen Hui came back to his senses from the scene of his classmates kneeling on the ground, begging for help, and asked.\nâGrandpa said he doesnât like to go out. Next time we eat mutton at home, he wants sesame sauce, fermented bean curd, and chives.â\nYiyi took a bite of the tripe and slurped it up because it was so spicy. âGrandpa is also strange. His stomach hasnât changed after so many years abroad. He still likes things like mutton and donkey meat hot pot.â\nHuihua said, âPeopleâs tastes are determined when they are young. They like what they have been used to eating since childhood.â\nYiyi refuted her: âNo, I wonât. I want to eat all over the world, whatever is delicious.â\nThe three children chatted while they ate. When the meal was over, Li Xia paid the bill, and the girl was still kneeling there when the family left. The money in the teacup was all small-denomination bills, and there wasnât much.\nShen Hui looked at her and seemed very touched. When they got home, Shen Haiyang patted him. The child saw concern in his fatherâs eyes and then smiled and spoke.\nâI just feel that children from single-parent families are pitiful. If she had a father, even a stepfather, she wouldnât have to be so humble now.â\nHe couldnât say the rest of the words; Shen Haiyang knew he was talking about begging. In the 1990s, peopleâs living standards had improved a lot, and motorcycles and other things could be seen everywhere in the provincial capital. But this child was able to be admitted to No. 1 Middle School but dropped out of school because his mother was sick.\nâFate is sometimes strange, as if it is deliberately testing us. We must believe that after darkness comes dawn.â\nLi Xia didnât ask her son how he would help. She planned to watch quietly. The next day, she went to work and got up very early in the morning. When she washed up, she saw that the watch on Shen Haiyangâs wrist was missing. She pointed at his wrist and asked silently.\nShen Haiyang smiled helplessly and said, âI was robbed.â\nâWhat?â\nâYi Yi, he asked me to donate money to help that sister yesterday. I casually said that I had no money, and he set his eyes on my watch.â\nâWho else did he rob?â\nâThe old man, Shen Hui, Huihua, none of them were spared.â\nHuihua heard her father talking about her brotherâs behavior outside the door and quickly complained to her mother. âNot only did Shen Ruyi take my pocket money, he also took away several of my hairpins.â\nLi Xia asked, âWhat about Shen Hui? What was taken away from you?â\nShen Hui replied in the courtyard, âPocket money and my model.â\nâNo.â Li Xia looked up at the sky in silence and said, âDonât you have hands? You just let him take it. I donât know when our family members became so easy to talk to.â\nShen Haiyang spoke first: âHe said he would buy me a Rolex when he works part-time in college.â\nShen Hui: âNext year, he will save money to buy me the latest airplane model.â\nHuihua: âHe said to buy me the latest accessories; the ones I have are all old.â\nLi Xia burst out laughing and said, âHe is just trying to appease you with some words. It seems that you are taking these words seriously.â\n",
    "83": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c50-2/\nAfter breakfast, Li Xia told the old man about the factory. The old man basically didnât care about it now, so he just listened. After finishing talking about this matter, he turned to Shen Ruyi.\nâYiyi is a very talented kid who is very active and eloquent. Huihui also wanted to help his classmates, but he only thought about it. The next step was to take out his own savings. But Yiyi not only took out his own things but also robbed us all.â\nâYouâre still praising him. Heâs just making empty promises. His pocket money is not enough to buy those things for everyone. If he canât deliver, heâs just lying.â\nâHow can this be called cheating? This is called financing. The brighter the prospects are, the better. As for whether it can be realized, that is the investorâs own judgment and vision. We voluntarily gave it to him, which means his plan is very attractive to us.â\nâYou were just fooled by him.â\nLi Xia didnât praise her son much. The brat was more humble than Shen Hui, and he was also more courageous. Nowadays, there are many shell companies everywhere, and many people make their fortunes with just a mouth and a bag, becoming successful overnight. He was not born with a down-to-earth personality, and his way of doing things was different from Shen Huiâs.\nShe drove to work and came back to see what happened next. Her son had to sell his fatherâs watch after robbing him. Maybe she, as a mother, supported him from behind.\nThe company held a meeting to understand the production situation at each factory. After that, Fang Long from the R&D department asked if the factory could issue patent dividends to the R&D department. A technical patent for the R&D department has been approved.\nLi Xia didnât say anything, so Xiao Liu retorted: âMoney, money, Director Fang, are you obsessed with money? You want money as soon as you achieve something. If you donât get money, will you quit tomorrow?â\nHan Jun also frowned: âThe R&D department invested so much in equipment, and that was all the factoryâs money. Without that equipment, you wouldnât be able to develop those things. This patent is the credit of the factory, and it was the factory that gave you the platform.â\nLi Xiaâs third brother is now in charge of transportation, and he doesnât say anything about things that have nothing to do with him. He turned around and glanced at his sister silently, and then remained silent.\nFang Long was surrounded, and he let out a long sigh of helplessness. He had recruited all the technical personnel in the R&D department in the past few years, so he must take care of everyoneâs interests.\nThe patents of the factoryâs R&D department should have belonged to the factory. They were paid salaries and bonuses, and now they want a share of the patented technology. No wonder they both quit.\nBut we canât generalize. Whatâs the situation now? Talents are hard to come by. Those people gave up their stable and secure jobs to come here for profit. Without something special, how can you attract more high-end talent?\nLi Xia knew that what Xiao Liu and Han Jun said was right. Logically, the things developed by the R&D department belonged to the factory. But Li Xia had her own considerations and thought that she could give some according to the value of the patent.\nâHow much?â\nAs soon as she finished speaking, Han Jun turned around and said, âBoss, you canât spoil the people in the R&D department like this, can you? Their bonuses in recent years have been high, and they earn more than the leaders of our department. Now they want some patent dividends; isnât that too much?â\nXiao Liu also said, âThatâs right. They are getting fatter than you, the factory director.â\nLi Xia glanced at everyone present and said, âWhy donât we vote?â\nFang Long, Han Jun, Xiao Liu, Li Xia, and her third brother raised their hands to vote. Needless to say, Xiao Liu and Han Jun opposed, and then Li Xia and Fang Long agreed. The remaining one, Li Xiaâs third brother, was in charge of transportation, and at this time he followed his sister without hesitation. He didnât understand what to do, but since his sister decided so, he followed.\nâThe vote passed, and the patent will be distributed to relevant technicians as a percentage of market value.â\nFang Long looked at Li Xia and was very satisfied with this boss. From the late 1980s to now, she has never let him down. He knows people who have also switched to private companies, but after the initial enthusiasm, many bosses did not realize the importance of R&D.\nThey either donât invest in equipment or think that they earn too much and their platform is more effective. Those who change jobs are in a dilemma, unable to return to their original companies and unable to earn the income they expected in private companies. If Li Xia is willing to give a part of the dividends from the patents, he will have more capital to attract talent.\nThere was a disagreement for a while, and the atmosphere in the meeting room was a little weird. Li Xiaâs third brother turned his head to look at this and that, then smiled and stood up, taking the thermos to add water to everyone, which, by the way, eased the awkward atmosphere.\nâAlright, alright, itâs unavoidable to have arguments while working, and sometimes even your tongue will clash with your teeth. We work together all day long, so itâs unavoidable to have some bumps and bruises.â\nHe was also a veteran of the factory, and everyoneâs expression eased up immediately after laughing. Xiao Liu smiled at Li Laosan, and Han Jun said nothing, but his expression had improved a lot. No more was said at the meeting. The previous topic was handled as Li Xia said, and dividends were given to relevant personnel according to a percentage of the patent fee.\nFang Long has secured benefits for his subordinates, so they naturally obey him. In recent years, the R&D department has been very motivated. When doing market research, they have selected products that are relatively simple but needed by every household. Li Xiaâs several factories have initially achieved independent production of small household appliances such as fans and washing machines. Now, water dispensers, heaters, etc. have also been launched on the market.\nAfter getting off work at the factory, Li Xia did not go to talk to Han Jun. The R&D department invested a lot of money every year, and he became dissatisfied after a while.\nHe thinks the factory already has products to support it, and their fans are selling so well. Why invest so much money in the R&D department? After investing so much, they still have to share the royalties with them after the technology patents are obtained. He has never seen other factories do this.\nLi Xia knew what he was thinking. She had indeed paid generous salaries to her R&D staff. But there was nothing she could do. If a private factory wanted to retain these people, it had to pay them generous salaries.\nâWhat does a person think about?â\nShen Haiyang came back, and she relaxed and told him that there was a little trouble at work, but it had been resolved. Keep your work and private life separate, and donât bring your work troubles home. Even if Han Jun had a problem with her, it had nothing to do with Shen Haiyang, and they were still close friends.\nâOur old house is going to be demolished, and the documents have been issued.â\nâReally.â\nâYes. I asked someone and found out that our house can probably provide one two-bedroom and one one-bedroom. There is a new area of small Western-style buildings in the north of the city. It is a bit far from the city, but I think it is suitable for the old man to live in his old age.â\nâThatâs great. Letâs buy a small western-style house for the old man to live in during his retirement, and then we can buy a house in the city. Or we can wait for our house to be demolished. This area will probably be demolished in a few years.â\nâOkay, then after our old house is demolished, do you plan to sell it orâ¦â\nâKeep it. We donât need that little money. When the kids grow up, they might want their own space, so let them live there.â\nâWhich level do you want?â\nâOf course, the middle one. Two, three, or four will do.â\nâThen we need the third floor. Iâll talk to someone tomorrow.â\nâOkay. Ask someone and see if I can get two two-bedroom apartments for a fee.â\nâIt should be possible. Let me ask.â\nThe demolition was handed over to Shen Haiyang, while Li Xia took an economics book and read it slowly. Her night school grades were not very good, but after two years of intensive study, she was no longer the girl who only knew the context of her past life.\nNow Qin Mu is in charge of taking care of the old man, and they hired an aunt to cook and clean the house. The auntâs surname is Xu; she is a few years older than Li Xia, and she looks kind and amiable. She read for a while, and the aunt outside called her to eat.\nJust after they had finished eating and cleared the dishes, Han Jun arrived. Qin Mu knew he had something to do when she saw him. She poured them some tea and left the main room. She never interfered in matters that had nothing to do with her.\nThe two of them sat on their own sides of the sofa, and Shen Haiyang went to the backyard to give them a separate space to talk. Han Jun picked up the cup to hide his embarrassment but found that the tea was too hot to drink, so he could only put it down silently.\nLi Xia sat there silently, waiting for him to speak. Han Jun was silent as he prepared his speech, thinking that Li Xia was becoming more and more cunning. In the past few years, she showed everything on her face, but now he couldnât understand her at all.\nâI know you value product research and development, but have you carefully looked at the accounts over the years? How much money has been invested in the R&D department since the factory became profitable? They enjoy such a good R&D environment, earning a lot of salary and bonuses. They use the factoryâs platform to develop patented products, which should belong to the factory.â\nâDo you know how much this patent would be worth if sold on the market?â\nâBut thatâs already a high salary and bonus.â Han Jun said anxiously, âIn these years of working in the factory, everyone says that your business is getting bigger and bigger, and there are more and more factories. Our brand has also been established, and everyone says that our products are good, and there are many of them. Several companies of the same period have either gone bankrupt or been merged, but we have established ourselves.\nBut look, your house is still the same as it was back then. The car you drive is still the Cadillac that your father-in-law gave you. Your husband, who is such a big boss, still rides a bicycle. â\nâYour only business car is that old Santana.â\nHan Jun became more and more excited as he spoke. Li Xia smiled and added, âItâs normal to have different work concepts and disagreements. You came to me, so itâs better to talk it out.â\nHan Jun felt a little embarrassed about her last sentence. He was not selfish, and he only cared about himself. He felt that she was putting all the money into the factory and into product research and development, which was a bit too much.\nâIt doesnât matter what car we drive; I just canât stand you pampering those R&D personnel. Also, your car represents you and your factory. People who are familiar with it will know it, but those who are not familiar with it have to use it to keep up appearances.â\nâHan Jun, tell me yourself. How many new products have we launched in recent years? How much profit have they brought in? Who brought them all?â\nâYes, I acknowledge the R&D departmentâs contribution. Fang Long has recruited a lot of talents in the past few years, and this time they have broken through a technical barrier, which can reduce costs for the factory. But their platform is provided by the factory, and they have a salary.â\nâOkay, stop nagging. We are back to the same old story. Platforms and talents are indispensable and complement each other. I know you think that if you give them salaries and bonuses, they will have to work for the factory. But think about it: What do these technicians want to do by leaving state-owned enterprises and coming to our small place?â\nHan Jun didnât say anything. She continued, âIf a state-owned enterprise goes bankrupt, you can switch to another one or even join a scientific research institution. With a stable job, you donât have to stay up late to work overtime. When you have enough experience, you will be allocated housing, and you will have pensions after retirement. If it werenât for the high salary and this dividend model, who do you think would be stupid enough to come here? Go and see those small factories that donât have their own products and are now doing OEM to get by. How many of them have even gone bankrupt?â\nâI know youâre a little dissatisfied. They are ordinary R&D personnel with a higher income than you.â\nâI didnât say that.â Han Jun interrupted her before she finished. âIncome should be proportional to contribution so that peopleâs enthusiasm can be mobilized. Revitalization depends on products, and there must be new things injected. There must be new products, and old products must also be upgraded and replaced.â This is what Li Xia once said. After he finished speaking, he sighed: âForget it; Iâll listen to you on these matters.â\nLi Xia smiled and asked him to drink tea. There are always bumps in the road at work. Itâs good to figure it out. After all, he is a veteran. He has been moved wherever he is needed over the years and has done a lot of work.\nHan Jun took a sip of tea and said, âAre you planning to renovate your house? Wooden decoration is popular nowadays. You can change the ceiling, floor, doors, windows, and furniture to make it look more fashionable.â\nâWith your taste, donât give me any advice. By the way, your wife said she wanted to buy a house; howâs that going?â\nThis time, he smiled. He had earned a lot of money following her over the years. Otherwise, he couldnât afford such an expensive commercial house with his salary. The most he could get from his company was a small, two-bedroom apartment, not a big house like this.\nLast year, the state issued the âProvisional Regulations on the Use and Transfer of State-owned Landâ, and the era of commercial housing began, but few are being built now, and they are all prepared for those who are at the forefront of the times. Ordinary workers cannot afford it.\nâItâs settled. A three-bedroom apartment of 142 square meters. Delivery next year. Hey, you donât want to buy a house? You live in this big yard comfortably, but if itâs demolished someday, are you going to rent a house in the interim?â\nâI will buy.â Li Xia didnât want to say it at first because it would seem like she was showing off. But he just felt sorry for Shen Haiyang, thinking that the house was not well decorated and the car was not a good one, so she should tell him.\nâA 500-square-meter villa with a garden. Delivery in the fall.â\nâOh my God!â He exclaimed and laughed: âThis is the style of a big boss.â\nLi Xia stood up with a smile and was speechless about his train of thought. You have to enjoy the money you make first; otherwise, you will feel bad. He bought a motorcycle last year, and before that, he also bought his next-door neighborâs house. Now he has a new house, but he still canât stand the people in the R&D department making money.\nAfter the two talked, Han Jun left with his wife. In the past few years, the couple has been working with Li Xia. Although Qin Mu is at home, she earns more than working outside. In the past few years, he has been very tough in front of Han Jun. Money is a personâs courage.\nShen Haiyang did not ask about his wifeâs work, thinking it was just a small matter to discuss. As a result, he was dragged to the 4S store by Li Xia on the weekend.\nShe said she would buy him one before, but he said he would drive her old one. Anyway, the family needs two or three cars.\nâMaâam, which car do you like? I can give you a test drive.â\nLi Xia looked around the spacious exhibition hall, trying to see which car caught her eye. Shen Haiyang was beside her, and the couple were discussing the cars while looking at them.\nA salesperson saw that she liked the new Mercedes-Benz and came over to her and whispered, âMaâam, if you think this is too expensive, I can recommend you a cheaper one.â\nLi Xia was very curious. Arenât there many low-priced cars? I just like Mercedes-Benz. This car can also bring a face to the factory. What low-priced car do you want to introduce to me?\nâA low-priced car?â\nThe man said in a low voice, âOh, no. Just this model, but the price is much lower than here.â\nâWhy?â\nThe man was about to whisper something to her when he suddenly saw Shen Haiyangâs clothes. His eyes changed, and his expression was panicked for a moment before he immediately returned to normal.\nâNothing. Maâam , if you like this model, you can test drive it.â\nWhatâs going on? This guy confused Li Xia. He just introduced her to something cheaper, and then he became a serious salesperson.\nForget it; who cares? She walked around the showroom and test-drove several brands of cars. In the end, she decided to buy a Mercedes-Benz.\nShe chose the Mercedes-Benz because it represented her factory. Shen Haiyang insisted on buying a Santana, and she didnât force him. In the end, they bought a Mercedes-Benz and a Santana. Shen Haiyang looked at the cars and shook his head in amusement. After paying, he whispered, âHow are we going to drive three cars back home?â\nâCall Han Jun to come over.â\nShen Haiyang was stunned for a moment. âI thought you were going to ask the third brother to come.â\nâHan Jun said yesterday that I made so much money, but you still ride a bicycle and donât decorate my house. It makes me sound like Iâve treated you unfairly. I told you how much money the factory makes, and the investment was agreed upon by you and the old man. Well, Iâm made to look like a stingy person. Let him see today that the boss is the boss.â\nâHa ha,â\nShen Haiyang couldnât help laughing. His wife was really funny sometimes. Han Jun was a screw-up. Why did you bother with him about this?\nâThis guy wants to enjoy himself when he has money. He has been very lucky over the years, thanks to Qin Mu. Now that he has successfully bought a house, he probably has some extra money.â\nâWhen he comes, Iâll use this Mercedes to seduce him and see if he continues to be a spendthrift. If heâs stimulated, maybe heâll save money to buy a car soon.â\nâOur previous Cadillac was given to the factory for use. He has one to drive, so I guess he wonât buy it.â\nLi Laosan and Han Jun probably went together before, so they arrived at the store together. Seeing Li Xiaâs hand, Han Jun was shocked this time, and he dared not say that her family was not good or her car was not good. He was not in charge of finance, and he was not clear about the specific income in these years, but he knew that Li Xia must be rich.\nThis is more reasonable. The factory has to maintain its reputation; otherwise, people will think that our factory does not make money. It is more impressive to drive the car to receive customers. When the old man goes out to participate in some activities, it will also bring honor to the factory if the driver drives the car.\n",

It would be so cool if he could borrow it and drive it back home. He was arm in arm with Shen Haiyang, but Shen Haiyang pulled his arm away.\nâNo.â\nâNo, youâre not that stingy. Weâre such close friends; why donât you lend me your car?â\nâNo.â\nShen Haiyangâs two words were so light that Han Jun was at a loss. His intestines and brain were in a knot, and his mouth seemed to be in a knot too, and he didnât know what to say. His facial features were wrinkled, and he looked confused.\nâIf you want to drive and buy it yourself,â\nâHey, did you hear what my wife said? I tell you, she is stingy. A grown man must take care of his face when he is out. She only knows how to save money all day long. That wonât work.â\nIn the 1990s, Han Jun spent so much money to buy a house, and this was still a burden under the high consumption. Qin Muâs thinking was still the same as before, but he suddenly opened the door to a new world after making money. Qin Mu disliked his extravagant spending and began to strictly control his pocket money after buying a house.\nThere were three cars. Han Jun drove Li Xiaâs old car back to his home and drove it back to the factory the next day to use it as a company car.\nAt Li Xiaâs home, the couple each had a new car. The third brother gave her the key and said he was going home. Shen Haiyang invited him to have dinner, and the man smiled and went to wash his hands. After dinner, the children quickly left the table and ran out to see the new car.\nThe three of them took the keys from the table and went out. They went to the garage, opened the car door, and got in. Seeing Yiyi was jealous, Shen Hui smiled and said, âI will be able to get a driverâs license in two years. Then I will drive you on the road.â\nâYou donât have a car.â\nâCanât I drive Dadâs car? Mom is busy all day and needs the car, but Dad is at work. I can just drop him off at work and then drive his car.â\nâCan you drive?â\nâOf course I can. My father taught me that before.â Shen Hui also got excited and started the car, ready to drive away. Huihua was shocked and tried to stop him.\nâHey, hey, you two just need to talk about it, but donât really do it. Youâre not old enough.â\nOne by one, they looked at the steering wheel and said, âThere are no traffic police at night.â\nHuihua scolded: âShen Ruyi, if you dare to instigate your brother to go on the road, I will tell mom right away and see if she wonât beat you.â\nThis time, the two guys were completely exhausted, turned off the engine, pulled out the key, and prepared to push the door to get out. At this time, Li Laosan came out to use the toilet, opened the doors one by one, and pulled him over.\nâUncle San, take us for a ride.â\nâYou kidâ¦â\nThe third brother laughed and cursed, but still took the keys and prepared to take the children for a ride. Such a nice car; not only the children liked it, but he also liked it. In the past few years, he worked with his sister and earned a lot of salary and bonuses. He settled down in the provincial capital and bought a house. But he couldnât afford such a nice car.\nThe third brother drove the car slowly out of the garage and parked it on the side of the road. He was about to get out of the car to close the garage door. A bright light roared past at high speed. He had no time to react, and the other party rushed over. He closed the door anxiously, and the other party rushed away with the car door.\nThey all heard a swishing sound in the car, but the man who scratched the car didnât slow down at all and seemed to speed up. He couldnât have been unaware of the scratch, so it was obvious that he was fleeing.\nThe third brother reached out and touched the brand new car and found a scratch on it. Blood rushed to his head, and he inserted the key, stepped on the accelerator, and rushed out. You bastards, I donât believe I canât catch you.\nThe car chased the motorcycle, and they definitely couldnât get away in such a short time. When the guys found someone chasing them, they rode their motorcycles faster. They sped along the street like gangsters, which was frightening to watch.\nSeeing that they were about to be caught up, the three guys parted ways at the intersection. The third brother concentrated on driving, while Yiyi and Shen Hui stared at the man who scratched the car. At this time, he immediately directed his uncle to chase after the man who scratched the car.\nHuihua shouted anxiously, âUncle San, why donât you stop chasing them? What if something happens again?â\nThe third brother stared at the motorcycle in front of him, and he hesitated after hearing what his niece said. If he chased after it, he was afraid of getting into trouble, but if he didnât chase after it, he would feel too frustrated.\nYiyi shouted at this time: âUncle San, follow him steadily; donât let him enter the alley. Iâll make the call.â\nThe biker saw that he was being targeted and rode away at full speed. Suddenly, someone behind him shouted, âStop, stop, or I will hit you and kill you. Your death will be in vain. Do you want to live or not? If you donât want to, I will hit you and make sure you die completely.â\nOne on the left and one on the right, distracting the other person on the main road. Giving him the illusion that he would die if he didnât stop. Seeing that the car behind him was about to hit him, he couldnât enter the alley on the side. At this time, his car ran out of gas and slowed down, so he had to stop by the wall.\nâFuck you, letâs see where youâre going this time.â\nHe turned off the engine, opened the door, and got out. Huihua also pushed the door open quickly, fearing that the two would cause trouble with their impulsiveness. The third brother also pushed the door open quickly and got out of the car. If they caught someone, he would have to pay compensation, so he didnât want to cause trouble.\nâDonât be impulsive. Letâs talk it over nicely.â\nAs he was shouting, the third brother had already pulled the man on the motorcycle up. The motorcycle he was riding fell to the ground, and Huihua and Shen Hui pulled it aside. In the process, a bag fell from the handlebars. She picked it up and saw that there was a sculpture of an animal head inside.\nâYou fucking â¦â\nâBrother, brother, donât hit me.â\nThe car lights were still on. Shen Hui looked over at the sound and found that the boy was actually his cousin. His mother, Murong Danlingâs sisterâs child, had always wanted to play with him near his house and even sneaked into his house to watch TV, but was later driven away by him.\nâYou kid, are you in a hurry to reincarnate? You scratched my momâs new car. How do you want to compensate her?â\nâHow can I accompany you? I have no money.â\nâNo money?â Yiyi found a brick on the roadside and moved it over. âIf you donât have money, Iâll give you a beating today.â\nâBrother, brother,â he was frightened and shouted when he saw Yiyi coming up. âDonât hit me; donât hit me; Iâll pay for it.â\nâWhat are you going to pay?â Yiyi still held the brick. The third brother stood aside without saying a word, silently supporting his nephewâs behavior like a bodyguard.\nâI have an antique in my bag. Iâll give it to you as compensation.â\nYiyi saw the thing in her sisterâs hand and said with disdain, âHow much can a broken animalâs head be worth?â\nâThatâs not an ordinary animal head. It was brought back from the Lama Temple in Qinghai. Itâs a cultural relic and very valuable.â\nThe new car was scratched, and there was also something called a Lama temple animal head. This matter was no longer easy to solve, so the third brother asked them to wait where they were while he took a flashlight to call the police. The scene had to be preserved so that it would not be difficult to explain later.\nHe went to the traffic police office to call the police and, at the same time, called Shen Haiyang and his wife. After Shen Haiyang received the call, he drove with his wife, and the couple quickly rushed to the scene. A boy was squatting on the ground, and his three children were scolding him. They donât know what he said, but Shen Hui kicked him and wanted to kick him again, but Shen Haiyang quickly stopped him.\nâHe was the one who scratched our car.â\nAs soon as Shen Hui nodded, the boy quickly rushed to Shen Haiyangâs side to prevent Yiyi and Shen Hui from beating him again. âUncle, itâs me. My mother is Murong Danfeng.â\nShen Hui raised his leg, kicked him again, this time using all his strength, and kicked him to the ground. âStop trying to get close to my dad. Who is your uncle? My mom doesnât have a nephew like you.â\nShen Haiyang grabbed his son, who was running away, and said, âOkay, letâs talk about what happened first.â\nShen Hui told the whole story from beginning to end and then apologized to Li Xia: âIâm sorry. Mom, I really didnât mean it. I didnât expect that this bastard would ride his broken motorcycle like he was going to take off. He didnât take such a wide road but chose to paddle across our car. I shouldnât have let my third uncle drive us for a ride.â\nHe was so angry that he wanted to kick the boy again, and the boy hid quickly in fear. While hiding, he said, âMy bike is a top-grade racing bike, an imported one. Itâs not a broken motorcycle.â\nShen Hui chased him and yelled, âYou dare to call that a top-level racing car with your lousy stuff? Arenât you afraid that the wind will blow your tongue away?â\nShen Haiyang stopped the two and looked back at Li Xia. The couple looked at each other, and Li Xia looked down at her car. There was a long scratch on the driverâs door, and it was heartbreaking to see such a good new car.\nâMy new car has become a broken car before it even hits the road.â\nShen Haiyang looked at it carefully and felt very sad. A car worth hundreds of thousands of yuan had just become a used car.\nâIâll give you mine.â\nHis car was cheaper than this one, but it was brand new after all. Li Xia smiled: âI was just saying it casually.â Facing the manâs expression of âyou call it casual talk,âÂ  she shrugged. âWhat else should I say?â\nSoon, the traffic police arrived, inspected the scene, and took everyone back to the traffic police team. The responsibility was divided, and the motorcycle rider was fully responsible. He drove without a license, damaged the other vehicle, and then fled the scene.\nâItâs too late today. I donât know if I can find his guardian. Please wait for a moment.â\nAt this time, the antique expert Shen Haiyang had called also arrived and found a place to study the animal head. Getting anxious while waiting, Shen Haiyang asked Li Xia to take the children home first.\nâIâll keep an eye on this place, and Third Brother is here too, so you can go home without worry.â\nâOkay.â\nEveryone sat and waited in the police station, and soon Murong Danfeng came, accompanied by her sister. It had been a long time since they last met, and Murong Danling looked at Shen Haiyang with mixed emotions.\nThis man seemed to have a more charming temperament in his middle years. It was hard to say what it was, but he was very attractive. She also found out the result of the competition Shen Hui participated in last time. Her son took the first place.\nShe was now infertile, and when she suddenly found out that her own son was so outstanding in her middle age, it was impossible for her to say that she had no thoughts. But her son and she had long since broken ties, and she would not give up the family fortune she had accumulated. She felt that there would still be a day when mother and son would be reconciled.\nâSince we are fully responsible, we will compensate you. My car is the same model as this one, so why not exchange mine for yours?â\nMurong Danling looked at Shen Haiyang with a big face, as if she were rich. Her beautiful face smiled at him, as if silently saying, Without you, I am no worse than Li Xia now.\nDo you regret it? Shen Haiyang read the question from her expression and frowned slightly.\nâThere is no need to replace it; you are fully responsible; just pay for the repairs and compensation.â\nââââ\nThe three children followed their mother into the car; all of them were silent. It was really unlucky today. Momâs good car was damaged. It would definitely not be as good as a new one after repair. And they donât know if the other party has money to compensate. If not, the money for repairing the car will have to be paid by mom herself.\nâWhy arenât you talking?â she asked, but still no one said anything. âHuihui, have you heard your physics competition ranking? Why havenât I heard you tell me?â\nâItâs out. I was going to tell you today, but I forgot when I saw the new car.â The child said with deep remorse, âIâm sorry, Mom. I shouldnât have.â\nâOkay, okay. Letâs talk about the exam.â\nâNo. 1 in the province.â\nâWow. My son is amazing.â\nAfter his mother praised him, Shen Hui felt a little relieved. In fact, their parents only ask about studying as a routine matter. Itâs not that they donât care, but they donât put pressure on them. You can decide how many places you get in the exams and whether you want to participate in these competitions. Thatâs your own business.\nâMom, that carâ¦â\nâThe car just needs repairing.â\nYiyi immediately gave his mother a thumbs up: âMy mom is awesome.â\nLi Xia glared at him through the rearview mirror: âI havenât asked you yet; you said you would help that sister; how is it going?â\nAs soon as she finished speaking, Huihua and Shen Hui couldnât help but burst out laughing. Shen Ruyi was thick-skinned and didnât care at all. He didnât wait for his brother and sister to speak, and he told his mother the follow-up.\nâThe head teacher of Class 8 held a fundraising meeting at school, which was very effective. We have raised enough money for the surgery for the sisterâs mother, and they said that the surgery can be performed as early as next week.â\nHuihua laughed even louder, and Li Xia looked at her daughter. The girl finally stopped laughing and said to her mother, âMom, you donât know how funny Yiyi is. He used the shovel handle in the classroom as a microphone and danced in front of his classmates. Hahaâ¦â\nAdolescents are at the stage of budding sexual awareness. They attach great importance to their image in front of the opposite sex. Their clothes, hair, and shoes are all kept clean. Is her son not grown up, or does he not know what an image is?\nâWhatâs so funny about this? Didnât they donate money after I jumped a few times? Since they said they would help that classmate, I will definitely do my best.â\nShen Hui also felt the classmate was very pitiful and donated all his pocket money. But he couldnât do that. He had ideas and was very motivated. He was so open in front of his classmates. The bad boy is now a celebrity at No. 1 Middle School. Even he is now known as Shen Ruyiâs brother. Because of his younger brother, he is more famous than before.\nSince the girlâs motherâs surgery problem has been solved, Li Xia will arrange for someone to sponsor her to re-enroll in school next semester. Itâs good to be able to get into No. 1 Middle School, so donât delay it.\nThe new car was damaged like that, but it was not a big deal for this family. Li Xia did not say much and planned to send it to 4S for repair after the traffic police team dealt with it. This kind of car probably needs to be taken to Hong Kong for repair, which is not cheap.\nAfter returning home, the two boys watched TV, did homework, washed their faces, and went to bed. Li Xia took a bath and sat in front of the dressing table to do skin care. She has been very busy with work in recent years, but she has never slacked off on skin care. Women dress to please themselves and pick up things that they didnât care about in their previous lives. If you protect your skin well, you will look younger than your peers.\nShe took off the mask, washed her face again, and applied some toner and moisturizer. She looked up and saw that it was almost eleven oâclock. The traffic police team should have finished their work.\nJust as she was thinking about going back, she heard footsteps in the yard. She walked to the door, and Shen Haiyang lifted the curtain and came in. âWaiting for me?â\nâOf course.â\nThe man took off his coat and washed his hands, getting ready for bed. âMurong Danfeng said she had no money and the motorcycle had no insurance. This should have been a quibble.â\nLi Xia guessed that this might be the case. The two sisters left a bad impression on her. She was about to say that she would just take her time to argue, and she would take the car to be repaired first. Shen Haiyang continued.\nâMurong Danling is very wealthy and agreed to compensate you without hesitation. Her new car is the same model as yours, and she said she would just give it to us.â Li Xia was about to speak, but he continued, âI refused. She said she would pay for you to get a new one.â\nLi Xia smiled. As expected, no one knows a wife better than her husband. He knew that she would definitely not be happy to have a car that Murong Danling had driven. âShe went there too?â\nâYeah. She drives a luxury car, wears fashionable clothes, and has a dazzling ring on her finger.â\nThey donât know what Murong Danling has been doing in the past few years, but it can be seen that she has made a fortune. Zhang Qiuhua was arrested and imprisoned. They wonder if she has been released now. They didnât know what happened at the beginning, and since then, Murong Danling has made a fortune year by year. They donât know what she is doing specifically, but on the surface, she looks very prosperous.\nâWhatâs the situation with her sisterâs antique?â\nâIt is considered a third-level cultural relic and can be traded in China.â\nâWhat about the bronze artifact from before?â\nâWithout the physical object, it is impossible to confirm.â\nâOkay, since itâs not against the law, letâs just ignore it. Letâs go to bed.â\nThat being said, Shen Haiyang still cared about Murong Danling and her sister. Someone was already paying attention to Murong Danfengâs antique shop, so he asked people to pay attention to Murong Danling.\nLi Xiaâs car was sent for replacement, and she had to wait two days before she could pick it up. Shen Haiyang got up early and sent her to work. He wanted to give her the new car first, but she refused.\nâIâll just drive the same car I had before.â\nShen Haiyang drove a brand new car to work, and his colleagues were all envious. A very good colleague started to tease him.\nâHey, this was bought by your wife, right? Do you think youâre just a gigolo?â\nShen Haiyang has a very good relationship with him, and everyone is just joking. Those who have known him for a long time know whatâs going on in his family. His wifeâs factory is the foundation of his father, and he is a typical rich second generation.\nâYeah, are you jealous?â\nThe other person punched him and said, âBoy, you seem to be getting younger and younger. You were mature when you were young, and now you are in your forties, but you are still like a young man. You are cheerful every day and always make jokes.â\nAs they walked, Shen Haiyang said, âI have a good attitude. You should learn from me. Donât be so irritable and angry when you talk.â\nâI want to, too.â The man sighed. âIâm middle-aged now, with old parents and young children to take care of. I feel a lot of pressure and burden. I discussed buying a motorcycle with my wife, but she still wonât agree. Yesterday I received a phone call saying that my father-in-law is ill, so thereâs no chance of buying a motorcycle this time.â\nThe two chatted for a while while walking, then stopped talking when they entered the office and began to devote themselves to the dayâs work. They ate in the cafeteria at noon, and when Li Xia came home in the evening, he washed his hands and went to the backyard to play chess with the old man.\nâDad, please pay attention. â\nShen Haiyang played chess very well. He jumped to the general position and reminded his father to pay attention. The old man raised his hand and smiled at his son.\nThe game lasted for an hour, and Li Xia happened to hear her father-in-law say in the corridor, âI want to be buried with your mother in a hundred years; is that okay?â\nLi Xia stopped and stood in the alley, feeling a dilemma. She didnât want to get involved in his family affairs. But it seemed unnecessary to leave at this time. She was the daughter-in-law of the Shen family, so why not listen?\nLi Xia pricked up her ears. After a long silence in the backyard, Shen Haiyang spoke: âNext year, during the Qingming Festival, I will go to my motherâs grave and ask the yin and yang masters to ask for it. It depends on what my mother wants.â\nâUm.â\nShen Haiyang actually believed this, and Li Xia suddenly felt that she and he had something in common. Her father-in-lawâs health had been deteriorating this year; no wonder he asked this. He wanted to be buried with his ex-wife; was it because they had been in love and harmony in the past?\nShe turned around silently and prepared to leave, thinking that this was not the right time for her to show up. As soon as she turned around, she bumped into someone, and they both put their hands on their lips to signal the other to be quiet.\nQin Mu tiptoed out of the alley and went to the front yard, where she placed the basket on the stone table. There were beans in the basket, and she began to pick them. She pinched the two ends of the beans and pulled the beans down, then broke them into sections.\nâThe old man hasnât been feeling well lately. Would he like to be hospitalized for a while?â\nLi Xia nodded. There were no places for recuperation in China before, but she heard that a new Chinese medicine hospital was built this year. The old manâs illness can only be alleviated, and it would be great if Chinese medicine could make him feel better.\nThe children are now in evening self-study and donât come home for dinner. They are the only adults at home. She discussed it with the old man during dinner. She thought he would agree, but he shook his head.\nâAsk Doctor Wang to prescribe some medicine. Iâll be fine at home.â\nThe old man was unwilling to go, and the children could not force him to go. At night, Li Xia secretly asked Shen Haiyang, âDo you want to prepare funeral clothes for the old man?â\nâI saw a funeral clothing store open on Nanhua Road. They have ready-made clothes there.â\nâReally? Someone has started this business. So thereâs no need to rush.â\nAfter all, he is old and his heart is not good, so these are inevitable worries. In the evening, the couple was discussing the elderly. The next day, an unexpected guest came to the house, who was related to the old man.\n\n\nTranslatorâs Note:- Hey guys, as a Christmas Gift I have decided to do mass release (10 chapters) of the novel which gets most votes in the poll posted on my Ko-fi page.\nIf you want mass release for this novel then vote for this novel in the poll.\nThis is the link to the poll: https://ko-fi.com/polls/Which-Novel-Mass-Release-do-you-want-V7V217M3GX\n\n",
    "85": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c52/\nCHAPTER 52\nâWho do you say you are?â\nThere were three people standing in front of Li Xia: one woman and two men. The woman wore glasses, and her clothes were open and Western-style. Beside her were two boys, one big and one small. The taller one was about 1.6 meters tall and about the same age as Yiyi , and he was holding the hand of a little boy who was about four or five years old.\nâHello, Auntie. Iâm Kevin.â He speaks Chinese well and even has a little accent when he speaks slowly. He raised his hand to introduce the people around him. âThis is my brother, and this lady is my grandmother.â\nâOh, you are hereâ¦â\nKevin continued, âWe havenât seen each other for many years. We came to visit grandpa. I want to apologize to him on behalf of my father.â\nLi Xia had no way to respond to this, but the lady next to her felt that her grandson had not told completely, so she spoke up. Her Chinese was much worse than Kevinâs, as if she had not spoken it for a long time.\nâMike was chased by a debtor, and his whereabouts are still unknown. Some people say he fell off a cliff and died. Anne was sentenced to three years in prison for a fight in a bar.â\nShen Haiyangâs expression changed slightly. Li Xia didnât feel much about the coupleâs affairs. They deserved it. They ignored the good investment environment on the mainland and used illegal means to put the old manâs money to waste. Now itâs all good; itâs all retribution.\nShen Haiyang continued: âMy father has not been in good health recently, so itâs better not to tell him this news. And Mikeâs information has not been confirmed; maybe he is fine at all.â\nâOh, no, he is the father; I canât lie to him.â\nForeigners may not understand what a white lie is; anyway, the old lady couldnât understand. The conversation here, probably because of the foreign language mixed in, quickly alarmed the old man, and the woman told him the matter immediately.\nWhen the old man heard that his son was missing, he was shaken for a moment, and Shen Haiyang quickly reached out to hold him. He quickly took out a quick-acting heart pill from his pocket, gave it to him, and helped him sit down in the rocking chair.\nâDad, calm down; itâs just missing.â\nShen Haiyang rarely called him dad; he was usually an old man or father during the New Year and other festivals. When he called him like this today, the old man held his hand tightly. He took a deep breath to calm himself down as his son called him.\nThe old man took the medicine, and Qin Mu called the Chinese medicine doctor to come. The old manâs current treatment with Western medicine is not as effective as Chinese medicine, so when the doctor came and gave the old man acupuncture, the situation soon calmed down.\nKevin was very sorry about this. Seeing his uncle coming out of the house, he said, âIâm sorry.â\nShen Haiyang was very polite to the child, especially the child who looked so polite and apologetic. âItâs not your fault.â\nKevin took a deep breath and wondered if he should have come here. He had developed a strong interest in this land after listening to his grandfatherâs words. After being taken away by his mother, he had been learning Chinese in the United States. The more he understood what his grandfather said about his roots, the more he yearned for them.\nHis fatherâs business failed, and his mother was arrested and asked his grandmother to take care of them. But his grandmother actually brought them to see his grandfather, and he only found out before boarding the plane. He felt ashamed to see him, but after being pulled away, he thought about coming to see his grandfather. He is old and has a heart disease, and this may be the only chance to see him again in this life.\nâUncle, can I go in and see grandpa?â\nâGrandpa is asleep. Wait until he wakes up.â\nâOkay.â\nKevin speaks the most fluent Chinese among the three. Shen Haiyang pointed at Qin Mu and said to him, âThis auntie is the one who takes care of Grandpa.â If you need to communicate anything, you can talk to her.â\nâOK.â\nQin Mu prepared breakfast for the three people in the backyard. Shen Haiyang was in a hurry to go to work, and the children were in a hurry to go to school. Li Xia was the boss herself, and no one cared if she went late or didnât go, but she had to entertain a group of customers today. Many of the customers this time were from other provinces, and if they wanted to open up sales channels, these dealers were absolutely indispensable.\nâQin Mu, arrange for them to stay in the backyard wing. If thereâs anything, we can talk about it when we get back.â\nâokay.â\nThe east wing was divided into two bedrooms, one for each of the brothers, and the old lady lived in the west wing. Li Xia made arrangements and drove away quickly, and Shen Haiyang said he would come back as soon as possible today.\nâDonât worry about the family. I will take leave after dealing with an emergency at work.â\nâOkay.â\nLi Xia went to the company to hold a meeting first. A batch of products had passed the quality inspection and were ready for sale. Today, they were the customers to be invited. The water dispenser was on the market for the first time, so she had to introduce the product to everyone.\nIn the 1990s, it became a buyerâs market. If you want to sell your products, you have to have some skills. Salespeople in factories have to drink a lot because they may be forced to drink too much at the dinner table.\nHan Jun is in charge of the factoryâs sales channels. These people have a long history with him. They have been together since the 1980s, when they stole things. Even if they drink, they will give him some face. At most, they will get him drunk, but they wonât drink him to death.\nThis batch of products were all small household appliances. During the day, they had been tested one by one in the factory with dealers to get familiar with their performance. In the evening, Li Xia hosted a banquet for these people at Zuixianju. In the afternoon, she had some time, so she called home, and Qin Mu answered the phone.\nâBrother Shen is back; just go ahead and do your thing.â\nOh, that puts her at ease. In the evening, they drove several cars to the restaurant together. Just as two cold dishes were served, the wine glasses were already filled one by one.\nâI would like to offer a toast to everyone and thank you for your support of Rainbow over the years.â\nA bunch of old men gave her face, and after drinking the toast, they didnât say they had to force her to drink but rushed towards Han Jun one by one. There were so many people today, and she was afraid that Han Jun couldnât hold them off alone, so she specially called her third brother and her nephew to come as well.\nA bunch of men were drinking and chatting at the table, and she went out to hide for a while. After drinking, they received a lot of orders, and at 12 oâclock in the evening, they were sent directly to the hotel next door.\nThe drunks were all settled, and her third brother asked the driver to take her home first and pick them up later. Han Jun and her nephew nodded, and the two men sat on the steps, lowering their heads and not talking. They really drank a lot today for the order.\nâThen Iâ¦ no need; Shen Haiyang is here to pick me up.â\nThe man came over with a coat in his hand and put it on her first. Since he was here, the driver took the three drunks to see them off one by one. Shen Haiyang helped her get into the car, and she shook her head.\nâLet me stay outside for a while. I feel dizzy.â\nIt was rare for her to act like a spoiled child with her husband. She leaned her head on his shoulder while talking, and she almost leaned her whole body on his arms. Shen Haiyang was afraid that she would fall, so he reached out and held her tightly.\nâCan you please sit in the car for a while? Youâre not comfortable standing like this.â\nâNo, Iâm going to stay like this.â\nâOkay, then donât move.â\nâhusband,â\nLi Xia said in a low voice in a Hong Kong and Taiwan accent, and suddenly he felt sweet and embarrassed. She was so old, but when she was drunk, she acted like a little girl. She was usually so capable, but when he came just now, she was standing straight, and nothing happened. But when he came, she leaned on his arms.\nâBe good; go home and sleep, okay?â\nâOksy.â\nShe got drunk and woke up with a splitting headache the next day. She got out of bed with her head covered. A glass of honey water was handed to her. She looked up and saw her husbandâs smiling face. She didnât take the glass of water but hugged his waist instead.\nShen Haiyang raised his hand, afraid of spilling the honey water. âWhatâs wrong? Are you still not awake?â\nHis wife looked up, her eyes hazy and her expression coquettish: âI want to act crazy with you when Iâm drunk.â\nThe man laughed softly, put the honey water aside, put his arms around her, and gave her a French kiss early in the morning. Li Xiaâs body, which was already limp from his kiss, became even softer like noodles, and she lay on him.\nThe two of them became more and more intoxicated, and Shen Haiyang stretched out his hands and began to pull his clothes off when he fell on the bed. Suddenly, he woke up and quickly got up.\nSitting on the bed to calm his restless emotions, he reached out and patted his wife, who was still lying in bed. âGet up. Breakfast should be ready.â\nLi Xia sat up, took the honey water from his hand, and took a sip. âNothing happened to those three yesterday, right?â\nShen Haiyang still looked calm and composed, as if he could handle anything with ease. âItâs nothing; donât worry. The old man has a plan in mind and knows how to handle things properly.â\nSixty to seventy percent of the factoryâs shares are in her name, and although the old man seems gentle, he is actually very principled in doing things. There is no need to be afraid, even if that woman has any intentions.\nSince you are here to seek refuge with the old man, let them handle it. After drinking honey water, she got up, dressed, and had dinner before going to work. After putting on her base shirt, she suddenly remembered.\nâItâs the weekend, right?â\nâYes, today is the weekend.â\nThere is no need to go to work or school; the whole family is at home. Breakfast is divided into two tables, and the three of them and the old man are arranged in the backyard. There are only five of them in the front yard, so they can talk without being disturbed.\nShen Hui took a bite of the pancake, swallowed it, and then said, âI remember Kevin being very lively when he was a child; how come he is like this now? He came yesterday and stayed in our room, but he didnât say much.â\nYiyi answered, âI spoke to him last night, and he only responded in a low voice.â\nHuihua said, âMaybe there seems to be shame in his eyes; maybe he feels embarrassed to face us.â\nShen Hui nodded. âHe should know what his father did back then. He lowered his head when talking to Grandpa and repeatedly said, Sorry.â\nAfter dinner, the nanny cleaned up, and Shen Hui went into the room to do his homework. He is a sophomore this year, and his studies are still very intense. He painted and wrote an essay in the room, took out the physics book to take a look, and then went to find his brother.\nLi Xia usually takes care of herself on her days off. After washing up, she lies on the bed and puts on a facial mask. The tape recorder next to her plays Teresa Tengâs songs. Her sweet voice seems to be able to squeeze out honey, and she closes her eyes and sings along.\nâSweet, your smile is so sweet.â\nâItâs you. Itâs you I met.â\nShen Haiyang came in and sang. Li Xia opened her eyes immediately. His middle-aged and more elegant face was right in front of her. They smiled at each other, and their eyes were as sweet as the song said.\nâLetâs go shopping.â\nâYouâll accompany me?â\nâIâll accompany you.â He knows that she is mentally strong now and wonât be affected by those three people. But he still takes the opportunity to go out for a walk, spend the weekend alone, and go on a date.\nShe sat up and took off her mask. âLetâs go. After shopping, weâll go to the movies.â\nThe child has grown up and no longer needs to be followed by them. He is in good health now and can go wherever he wants.\nAs for these things at home, they canât affect her at all. She handles so many things every day now, and most of the shares are in her hands. The old man canât shake her position. And the old man is not confused, so there is no need to worry.\nLi Xia quickly washed her face and put on some light makeup. She was wearing casual clothes and flat shoes, which were very suitable for her to go shopping. Shen Haiyang helped her carry her bag, and when they went out, they ran into Qin Mu.\nâHey, where are you going? You two look ten years younger in these clothes. If I didnât know, I might think you two are dating.â\nLi Xia started the conversation: âWe didnât talk about it back then, so letâs make it up now.â\nâHaha!â Qin Mu laughed, and the aunt who cooked and cleaned the house also laughed beside her. âIâm really envious. You two have been married for many years, and your relationship is so good.â\nLi Xia smiled and stopped talking about it. âYou donât have to cook lunch for us. If weâre not back by 5 p.m., you donât have to cook dinner either.â\nYiyi came out of the house and said, âMom, where are you going? Take me with you.â\nLi Xia waved her hand, like shooing away a fly: âGo, why are you joining in the fun? Youâve finally grown up; go play by yourselves and donât follow me.â\nâMom, Iâm only thirteen.â\nâYou are in high school now.â\nâIâ¦â Yiyi âs eyes widened in anxiety. His mother ignored him and walked away with his fatherâs arm. His father gave him a helpless look, and he stamped his feet in anxiety at the door.\nâHumph, I wouldnât have skipped a grade if I had known. Iâm obviously not that old, but you treat me like an adult all day long. Iâm still five years away from adulthood. This is child abuse.â\nShen Hui and Huihua were behind him at some point, laughing at him. Shen Hui said mercilessly, âWho said youâve grown up and asked dad to buy you a motorcycle?â\nYiyi made a face that said you donât understand me. âI wanted the Doraemon set, so I raised the conditions a little bit. When I lowered the conditions step by step, my father agreed and bought me the whole set of comics at once.â\nHuihua and Shen Hui looked down on him, and the siblings spoke together. âYou are the only one who has a lot of tricks.â\nThe three kids were bickering and doing homework at home, while Li Xia and her husband drove to a boutique department store. This was newly opened last year, and it mainly sells high-end clothing. European, American, Japanese, and Korean brands are gathered here, and shopping is convenient without bargaining. Li Xiaâs ability to cut corners in her previous life was never put to good use in this life.\nAt the skin care counter, Shen Haiyang bought himself a set of imported French brands. Li Xia smelled a perfume and nodded to pay for it. She never used these before, but now she has to pay attention to her image on some occasions. The one he picked has a light and elegant scent, which is suitable for her age.\nOn the second floor, all the clothes are menâs clothes. Suits, shirts, ties, casual jackets, jeans, etc. are all carefully made. Li Xia buys everything she sees. Before she even goes to the third floor, her husband is almost drowned by the bags. She is still bending over to choose a tie, and Shen Haiyang looks up at the sky in silence. Isnât his wife very stingy and thrifty? When did she become a shopping maniac?\nâHoney, if I buy more, I really wonât have anywhere to put them.â\nLi Xia looked back at him. The tall man was really blocked by the shopping bags, with only his face showing. She laughed and still paid for the tie and cufflinks she liked.\nâIâll send it to the car first, so you donât have to worry about not being able to get it.â\n\n\nTranslatorâs Note:- Hey guys, as a Christmas Gift I have decided to do mass release (10 chapters) of the novel which gets most votes in the poll posted on my Ko-fi page.\nIf you want mass release for this novel then vote for this novel in the poll.\nThis is the link to the poll: https://ko-fi.com/polls/Which-Novel-Mass-Release-do-you-want-V7V217M3GX\n\n",
    "86": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c52-2/\nOn the third floor, she bought herself a lot of womenâs clothing and bags. This time, Shen Haiyang said nothing, even though he was soon buried in shopping bags again.\nThe fourth floor is for teenagers and childrenâs clothing. She definitely wonât forget the three little ones at home. Everyone got a share, and she bought an extra piece for Huihua. The girlsâ clothing is really nice, and there are more styles than the boysâ.\nâAnd the Kevin brothers.â\nShen Haiyang reminded her, and Li Xia nodded silently. No matter how bad Shen Yaozong was, Kevin and Jimmy were so well behaved, so he didnât have to be hard on them. These two were Shen Haiyangâs nephews by blood, and now they live here, so it was considered a face-saving thing to bring one with them.\nâWhat time is it? Why do I feel hungry?â\nShen Haiyang raised his hand and was about to let her check the time when he found that his wrist was bare. âI forgot; the watch was sold by Yiyi .â\nThe salesperson next to him smiled and replied, âItâs half past one.â\nLi Xia laughed: âLetâs go buy a watch. Then we can go eat after buying the watch. Iâm starving.â\nLi Xia wanted to buy him a Rolex but was stopped by Shen Haiyang, so he picked out an ordinary one. âYiyi will buy me a Rolex.â\nâOkay, wait for the brat to buy it.â Li Xia saw a Japanese food store across the street and was very curious about it. âLetâs go eat Japanese food. Iâve never eaten it before.â\nâOkay, letâs try it.â\n\nIt was her first time eating here, and she didnât know what to order, so she asked the waiter to give her the restaurantâs specialties. When the dishes came, they were really exquisite. The salmon sashimi was dipped in mustard, and Shen Haiyang was choked by tears.\nHe reached out to grab a napkin, wiped his own eyes, and grabbed a few more for his wife. Li Xia was also choked, and she couldnât stand the strong mustard smell. Not only did her tears flow, but her nose seemed to be full of water. Her husband reached out to wipe her tears, and she wanted to grab a few pieces of paper to wipe her nose, but he snored while wiping her eyes.\nLi Xia felt embarrassed and said, âIâll wipe it myself.â\nShen Haiyang threw the paper into the trash can. âWhy are you being shy with me? We are going to be together until we grow old, and we will show each other everything we are like.â\nLi Xia was still chewing salmon, and she said incoherently, âWe canât do that nowâ¦ Never mind, itâs been so many years; itâs a bit late to think about the image now.â\nHer eyes were clear, with a few strands of hair falling on her cheeks, and her cheeks were puffy as she chewed something. The woman in her thirties made him think of the word cute.\nIt is true that a good man raises his wife to be a child, while a bad man drives his wife crazy. Marriage cannot be smooth sailing; there will always be troubles of one kind or another. He will use all his abilities to bear the storm with you, and he will hold up an umbrella to isolate you from the wind and rain.\nSalmon sashimi, eel rice, miso soupâ¦ After leaving the Japanese restaurant, Li Xia felt like she was not full. Should she go for another bowl of sliced noodles? Forget it; it seemed like her stomach was full again.\n(eel rice) Â \n( miso soup) Â \nShe had a rare Japanese meal with such hesitation. If you ask her if she would eat it again next time, she will definitely shake her head. A little bit is not enough to fill you up, and it is so expensive.\nAfter entering the cinema in the afternoon, Shen Haiyang went to buy juice and popcorn. Most of the people in the cinema were young couples, and they were dressed very young today. Seeing others holding hands or putting their arms around each otherâs shoulders, Shen Haiyang also held his wifeâs hand.\nThe two of them went in and found a seat to sit down. Li Xiaâs face flushed. In such an environment, it really felt like being in love.\nIn the 1990s, mainland Chinaâs film industry was in a slump. People were watching videos now, and Hong Kong and Taiwan videos were extremely popular. The movie being shown in the cinema today was also a Hong Kong movie.\nâTricky Brainsâ is a movie by Stephen Chow that makes you laugh all the way to the end. His nonsensical way of making people laugh is very popular among young people. There was constant laughter in the theater from the beginning of the movie. Li Xia was shaking with laughter while holding Shen Haiyangâs hand, and she fell into his arms several times.\nAfter the movie, she walked out of the cinema with a group of young people. When she got home, she still had a smile on her face. She called the three little ones to help her get things. Huihua noticed that her mother was different from before.\nâMom, what good news do you have today?â\nLi Xia reached out and touched her face. Why was she smiling so obviously? âNothing. I just watched a movie.â\nâCan a movie make you so happy?â\nâif not?â\nâYou are so happy; your eyes are full of smiles. Itâs not just because of the movie, right?â\nLi Xia smiled but didnât say anything, and while Yiyi called his sister over there to help, âDonât just whisper to mom. Dad and mom have moved the department store back today, so hurry up and help us.â\nThe whole family went out together, and Qin Mu was shocked when she saw it. âOh my God, when you go out, you go all out. This time, itâs too scary. Brother Shen is so patient. If it were my husband, he wouldnât accompany me for a whole day. He would run away halfway.â\nLi Xia joked with her: âTie him up with a rope and see where he runs.â\nâForget it; I might as well go shopping by myself.â\nAfter a few small talks, they divided up the things they bought. The three children took their own clothes to try on, while Shen Haiyang took the clothes he bought for the other two and went to the backyard.\nLi Xia didnât ask the other two whether they were wearing the clothes or not. She looked around and saw that the three children were wearing the clothes she bought. She felt that Huihua and Shen Hui were really good-looking.\nShen Hui is over 1.8 meters tall, with a tall and handsome figure. When he puts on the shirt and trousers she bought, he looks like a handsome young man, much better than the usual school uniform. Huihua is over 1.6 meters tall, and the clothes make her look even better, with a slender figure and picturesque features.\nTurning to look at her youngest son, she collapsed immediately. âShen Ruyi, when are you going to lose weight? You tell me yourself.â\nYiyi is thirteen years old, not as tall as Shen Hui, but heavier than him. This child has loved eating since he was young, and he is chubby and cute. In his previous life, he naturally lost weight after he grew up and lost his baby fat to become a teenager. So in this life, Li Xia didnât pay much attention to this, and as a result, he ate himself into a fat man.\nâIt will be fine when I grow up.â\nâHow big have you grown?â Li Xia was somewhat helpless. He was already thirteen; he is still young. âHow about getting up early every day to exercise?â\nâI have morning self-study at 6:30 in the morning and canât go to bed until after 11:00 at night.â\nThis means, look at my time in a day; how can I find the time to exercise? Li Xia also knows that the child is studying hard, but if he is allowed to continue like this, will he grow up to be a fat boy?\nâThen control your diet.â\nâMom, how do I control it?â\nâCancel the midnight snack. Go straight to bed when you get home.â\nâThen how would I go to bed early if Iâm hungry?â\nâWhat else can I do? Control your mouth and move your legs. If you donât like these two methods, what else can you do?â\nâIâm not that fat.â\nLi Xia rolled her eyes at him and said, âLetâs go and see on the scale.â\nâOkay, okay, I wonât have midnight snacks anymore. Iâll go to bed as soon as I get home.â\nShen Haiyang heard his wife and son talking about losing weight at the door, but he didnât go in at all. Yiyi was the best at acting like a spoiled child, and he was afraid that if he went in, he would ruin his wifeâs plan.\nBecause he was not allowed to have midnight snacks, Yiyi planned to have an extra bowl of rice at night. But after he finished the second bowl, his mother took away his rice bowl. Looking at his empty hands, he turned to look at his mother pitifully.\nAm I not allowed to eat my fill?\nâTwo bowls are enough.â\nWell, he is adapting to the first day of weight loss. The rice bowl is gone, but the chopsticks are still in his hand, and he starts to pick up the food to eat. Li Xia wanted to say something but was afraid that the children would not be able to accept it if she was too strict, so she had to look at them one by one. Shen Haiyang received the message from his wife and took the lead to speed up.\nThen they found that they hadnât eaten much of the food, so they all put down their bowls and chopsticks. His mother cleared the dishes and even whispered something to the cook. He didnât need to listen; he could guess that she must have asked her to put the food away.\nAfter finishing homework during the day, the entertainment at night after dinner is watching TV. Li Xia bought an 18-inch color TV and placed it in the west wing.\nShen Haiyang called out to Shen Hui in the yard, âDad, what do you want me to do?â\nâGo to the backyard and see Kevin and his brother. You can ask them to watch TV with you.â\nâOh.â Shen Hui responded habitually, then took two steps, realized something was wrong, and turned back. âDad, Jimmy doesnât speak Chinese very well; can he understand TV?â\nâIf he doesnât understand, you can teach him and practice your spoken English at the same time.â\nâNo, Dad, do I have to teach him Chinese just to watch TV?â\nShen Haiyang looked at his son in silence for a moment, then said earnestly, âThey both encountered an unexpected change, and grandpa and grandma havenât contacted each other for many years. They are like strangers. They have been staying in the room for a day.â\nâOh, children are innocent of the grudges between adults, right? I know. I will go and take care of my two cousins.â\nThe son didnât need him to say anything else; he fully understood what he meant. The two of them really looked pitiful. Such a big family change happened all of a sudden, and those who are less able to bear it might develop psychological problems.\nHe walked through the alley and went around to the backyard. He heard a lot of foreign chatter coming from the main room in the backyard. He listened attentively. It was Kevinâs grandmother complaining to his grandfather.\nHe heard his grandfather ask her to take the two children away. Then the two of them started a discussion about the children, one after another, and the womanâs voice became louder and louder.\nShen Hui turned around and looked at the east wing. The two brothers in there must have heard it. He wondered what they were thinking at this moment. Alas, itâs so pitiful for a child without a father or mother.\nShen Hui went to the backyard to call his two cousins to come over to watch TV. After knocking on the door several times, it was finally opened. Little Jimmy looked at him shyly and tried several times but failed to speak. He finally smiled and spoke.\nâCome to the front and watch TV with us. Itâs boring to stay in the house all the time. After watching TV, Iâll take you out for a walk.â\nâIâm not going.â\nâWhy? The TV series is very interesting. If you donât understand it, I can tell you after itâs over.â\nâOh well.â\nAfter all, he was young, so Shen Hui persuaded him with a few words and prepared to go out with him. He had heard his brother talk about his uncleâs sons and daughter, and he was very envious of those brothers who could play the piano, catch cicadas, and roll iron rings.\nâAsk your brother to come along. Heâs bored in the room alone.â\nâBut my brother wonât go.â\nâWhy?â\nâMy brother said we shouldnât have come to see grandpa in the first place.â\nâChildren should not be burdened with adult matters.â Shen Hui said as he walked inside, wanting to relieve the burden borne by the little kid who used to pull him and call him brother when they were little.\nâKevin, Kevin, do you really not want to come out? This place is different from when you came here. There are many local delicacies in the night market at night. I will take you to try them.â\nâOK, thanks.â\nKevin was very curious about China, and although he felt embarrassed, he still came out to appreciate the kindness of his cousin. The two brothers followed their cousin to the front yard to watch TV. Jimmy was not interested in the TV series that the older children were watching. Huihua noticed it and found him a cartoon after a paragraph.\nâIf you donât understand something, ask your brothers.â\nâWhy canât I ask you, sister?â\nâBecause, sister,â Huihua stuttered for a moment, not knowing how to express herself. Her foreign language proficiency is the worst among the three siblings. The three of them have been learning from their grandfather since they were young, but these two have good brains and excellent memory and are better than her in all aspects except painting.\nâAre you the little question, prince? Why are you asking so many whys?â Yiyi spoke up to help his sister out.\nâWhat is the problem, little prince?â\nâOh, no.â\nYiyi slapped his forehead with his hand, looking extremely helpless. The process of watching the animation refreshed his cognition again and again. He was tortured by his little cousin, and he was very distressed. He got stuck in his speech many times. Talking with someone who didnât understand Chinese at all really improved his foreign language level.\nâBrother.â Yiyi was about to collapse and called Shen Hui. The brat was brought here by his brother, and now he and Kevin were silent, throwing the question to him.\nShen Hui and Kevin were laughing. âLetâs go to the night market.â\nâWhatâs available at the night market?â Jimmy asked.\nâDelicious food.â Foodie Shen Ruyi started to count. âGrilled fish and meat, oden, fried rice noodles, donkey meat hot potâ¦ Oh, there are so many delicious things. Letâs go; you will know how many there are when we get there.â\nâOkay.â\nThe four-year-old boy had an oriental face but didnât understand Chinese at all. Yiyi was afraid that he would get lost, so he held his hand tightly, just like his older brother and sister took care of him when he was a child.\nThe three siblings rode their bikes and took the two brothers to the pedestrian street. The night market was crowded at that time. They bought teppanyaki and a few skewers of squid each.\n\n\n\nThe squid is cut into small pieces and fried on a hot iron plate. It is brushed with sauce and sprinkled with pepper and other seasonings, and it smells delicious.\nThe two brothers had never eaten it in the United States. After they got it, they took a bite quickly after smelling the fragrance. Their taste buds were conquered in an instant, and their eyes brightened. Jimmy gave a thumbs up.\nâBrother, itâs delicious.â\nYiyi raised his head halfway in a proud manner and said, âThis is just the beginning. Wait for your brother to take you to eat all over the city and make sure you are fat and plump.â\nâLike my brother?â\nBang, Jimmyâs arrow hit the bullâs eye, and Yiyi suddenly felt that the teppanyaki in his hand was a little hot. His mother just told him to lose weight and control his diet today. He didnât eat enough for dinner, and he was a little hungry after watching TV just now.\nHe put a bunch of tofu skin rolls under his nose and smelled them, then he opened his mouth and took a big bite. âEat your fill first, then think about everything.â\nHe said this in Chinese. Jimmy looked up and asked him, âBrother, what did you say?â\nâI say the biggest thing in the world is to eat enough.â\nHe still spoke in Chinese, and the little boy looked confused. Facing the little boyâs confused look, he laughed loudly and reached out to rub his head, ruffling his hair.\nâWant to understand?â This time, it became a foreign language.\nâYes.â\nâThen learn it. You are now in China; how can you survive if you donât understand Chinese?â\nShen Hui also said, âYour brother speaks Chinese very well. You are Chinese; how can you not know Chinese?â\nThe people around were attracted by the foreign language, and they couldnât help but admire Shen Ruyi and Shen Hui for switching between Chinese and English. Whose child is so well-educated? He looks like he is only in junior high school, but he speaks foreign languages fluently.\nâKids, did you grow up abroad?â asked a curious middle-aged man.\nâNo.â Yiyi replied with a polite smile.\nâIs this your brother? Why doesnât he understand Chinese?â\nâHeâs my cousin. He grew up abroad.â\nâOh, so there is a language environment at home.â\nâItâs said that a dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives birth to a phoenix, and a mouseâs son can dig holes. Such an outstanding child must have very capable parents.â\nEveryone had no ill will but instead praised him. Yiyi smiled and said nothing more. His parents were great, of course. His grandfather was a college student during the Republic of China, and his father was also a college student. Moreover, his grandfather had been abroad for many years, and he had learned spoken English from his grandfather since he was a child. He was not like those children who started to learn foreign languages in junior high school.\nFive children walked from one end of the night market to the other, with stalls selling all kinds of things on both sides. He suddenly remembered what his mother said when he was a childâthat the golden age of stalls would soon passâand asked him to study hard because the future is the era of technology. Today, stalls still earn more than fixed wages, but they are no longer so rare and profitable.\nâMy mom has a really good eye. Awesome.â\nLi Xia didnât know she was being praised by her son. She took a bath, put on a facial mask, and listened to music. Shen Haiyang came over and sat beside her bed to give her a massage. She felt comfortable and hummed along.\nâOver the years, you said you were so confused back then.â\nWhen Shen Haiyang came, she tore off the mask, opened her eyes, and smiled at her husband. âDid I sing well?â\nShen Haiyang nodded immediately. âNot much worse than Mao Amin.â\nâI love to hear that.â After saying that, she leaned over and kissed him, then went to wash her face and take care of her skin.\nThe man reached out and touched his face, saying with a smile, âYou made my face full of mask water; itâs sticky.â\nâThose are all for skin nourishment. Didnât you see that I often apply facial masks? Look how good my skin is.â\nShe is less than 40 years old this year and has had good skin to begin with. She has taken continuous care of her skin over the years and does not have to work in the fields and be exposed to the wind and sun. She looks a dozen years younger than she did at the same stage in her previous life.\nâThatâs right. My wife hasnât changed in all these years. She still looks the same as before.â\nLi Xia washed her face and applied toner, then stood up and sat next to him, gently nudging him with her body. âWhether itâs true or not, I like to hear that.â\nâLook at you. Do I have to lie to you?â\nâreally?â\nâOf course.â She put her hand down after applying the toner. He turned his head to take a closer look. âYou really havenât changed at all since the first time I saw you.â\nThis man spoke seriously, which was more credible than a man who spoke in a slick way. Li Xia was immediately overjoyed, and she leaned over to give him another sweet kiss.\nâDonât use this trick on others.â\nShen Haiyang laughed at his wifeâs possessiveness. After applying the night cream, she sat there and talked to him about business. âDid Dad say what to do with them?â\nâHe couldnât reach an agreement with that woman, and they were arguing.â\nâThen, what does that woman want to do? Does she want to stay and remarry the old man?â\nâI do not know.â\nâah?â\nShen Haiyang suddenly burst into laughter and reached out to pinch her surprised cheek. His wife was so interesting, and sometimes it was fun to tease her and see her get angry.\nâHe has called someone to find a host family for the two children. Their mother will be released in three years, and the old man will cover all expenses for the next three years. The two brothers can live together, just like foreigners studying in the United States, and the cost is not much. She wanted to take care of the two grandchildren and let the old man pay for it, and now they are arguing about this.â\nâThen why did you say you didnât know before?â\nâJust to tease you.â\nâAh, Shen Haiyang, you are so annoying.â\nShen Haiyang laughed when his wife tickled him. She didnât dare to use too much strength; she was just playing around. âHaha, okay, okay, I wonât tease you anymore.â\nâBad guy, you just know how to bully me.â\nShen Haiyang hugged his wife tightly in his arms and said, âDonât worry about them; Iâm here. When the old man asks someone to find a good host family to send the two brothers away, the woman will naturally have to leave.â\nâOkay.â\nLi Xia stood up and took the book from the bookshelf, not worrying about it any more. The old man had a bottom line. Even if the parents of these two grandsons were unreliable, he would at most support them in their studies and give them living expenses until they reached adulthood. Shen Yaozong taught him a lesson: he himself had no ability, and money could sometimes be a calamity.\nThis is not a big deal. Her factory spends more on charity every year. She supports the children of outsiders. This is a good child with a blood relationship. Even if the old man doesnât say anything, she and Shen Haiyang will also support the two of them to study.\nShen Haiyang went to the toilet and ran into the five people laughing when he came back. Jimmy said the snacks were delicious, and Kevin said China was very rich and developing very fast.\nâI must come back to visit after I graduate from college.â\nYiyi straightened up and raised his head when he saw his father grinning at him. Suddenly, he remembered something and quickly raised his hand to wipe his mouth. Jimmy didnât understand what he meant, but his strong ability to imitate made him do the same thing.\nThis attempt to hide the truth made Shen Haiyang laugh in his heart, but he remained serious on his face. âWhere did you go?â\nâJust wandering around outside.â\nâYou smell like barbecue?â\nYiyi âs face fell immediately, knowing that he couldnât deceive her. He smiled at his father and put his arm around his. âDad, please donât tell my mom.â\nâWhat did your mother say to you today?â\nâLose weight and control your diet.â\nâSo what are you doing now?â\nâBut how can I have the energy to lose weight if I donât eat enough?â\nâShen Ruyi, what kind of fallacy are you talking about?â\nâThis is a serious truth, Dad; why donât you understand? Think about it: to lose weight, you have to exercise; I have to go out. Iâll be so hungry I canât even walk; I have to replenish my energy; otherwise, how can I lose weight?â\nShen Haiyang looked at him helplessly and amusedly. This child was not as well-behaved as the other two. He has had his own ideas since he was young. Shen Hui, Kevin, and Huihua were laughing on the side. Shen Ruyi, who was so confident just now, could also be so flattering.\nâSo are you going to lose weight or not?â\nââ¦â¦reduce.â\nâWhat about a midnight snack?â\nâNo more.â\nYiyi looked hopeless; no matter how he tried to get around his father, he could always catch his weakness. Jimmy didnât understand what they were saying, and he felt sorry for his brother. The little hand silently took his hand, and he smelled a barbecue smell.\nIt smells so good. Iâll go out to eat with my brother tomorrow.\nLittle Jimmy was still thinking about the food and pointed to the backyard one by one and made a soft gesture, asking them to go back quietly. His mother was still awake at this time; if he disturbed her, he would be scolded again today.\n\n\nTranslatorâs Note:- Hey guys, as a Christmas Gift I have decided to do mass release (10 chapters) of the novel which gets most votes in the poll posted on my Ko-fi page.\nIf you want mass release for this novel then vote for this novel in the poll.\nThis is the link to the poll: https://ko-fi.com/polls/Which-Novel-Mass-Release-do-you-want-V7V217M3GX\n\n",

They had separate meals in the front and back yards these days. Today, only Li Xia and her husband were in the front yard. The three children were in evening self-study, stayed in school to eat, and did not come back.\nâWhen our three kids go to college and get married and start a family, we can live in peace like this every day. When we retire, we can live in Sichuan for a year. The kimchi there seems to be especially delicious.â\nShen Haiyang smiled: âThere are so many delicious foods in Sichuan, but you only like kimchi?â\nâEverything else is fine, but I like the sour and spicy taste of kimchi. The ones made in Sichuan are particularly authentic and taste better than those made elsewhere.â\nâIt should be because of the water and climate.â\nThe couple was eating and chatting when they suddenly heard a womanâs noise coming from the backyard. They stood up and looked towards the backyard at the same time. Just as they were about to go to see what was going on, Kevin ran out of the backyard.\nâUncle, can you arrange for us to return home right away? If we leave, grandma will naturally stop making trouble with grandpa.â\nThe old man had already asked someone to make the arrangements, and now it seemed that the woman was getting anxious. Li Xia accompanied Shen Haiyang to the backyard. She couldnât keep up with the foreign language that was being spoken at such a fast pace, and she could only hear a few familiar words from it.\nIt seems that her guess was right. The old lady wanted to leave, but she was not satisfied with the old manâs plan. The two old people were arguing, and Shen Haiyang stood there as a peacemaker, fearing that his father would be angry.\nLi Xia didnât understand, so she just took the two children to eat. The most important thing in this matter is the childâs own wishes. Have you, as an old lady, asked your grandson?\nâKevin, would you like to live on your own or with your grandmother?â\nâMyself.â Kevin was a little embarrassed.\nâWe shouldnât have come, butâ¦ Iâm only in junior high school. If Grandpa had given us some financial support, we wouldnât have to go to the orphanage. In a few years, my mother will be able to raise Jimmy, and Iâll be old enough to work by myself. Grandpa said he was looking for a host family for us, and I canât wait. Mainly, I donât want grandma to use us as an excuse to trouble grandpa.â\nThe most important thing in this matter is the childâs own wishes. It seems that the old man has talked to the child. Children who have lived abroad since childhood may cause a series of problems once they change their environment. And Kevin made it very clear that he wants to get help, not stay in China with his brother. Then this matter is very simple.\nâAsk your uncle to contact you as soon as possible. Donât worry; your grandfather will take care of the tuition. You can live your life in peace.â\nâThank you, auntie.â\nThe two of them spoke slowly, communicating well in both Chinese and English. It would take some time to get in touch with them, but since things had been settled, there was nothing to worry about. As for the old lady in the backyard, she couldnât hear them during the day because she was at work, so it would probably take a few days to get rid of her.\nâIs the food not to your liking? Otherwise, Iâll take you to the night market.â\nShe talked and gestured, and Jimmy understood everything. His eyes immediately lit up like stars, and he nodded frantically. âMy brother took me to the night market, where we had barbecue and popcorn.â\nHe couldnât say the name for a moment, and he was scratching his head anxiously. âAnyway, there are a lot of delicious things.â\nâThen letâs go together.â\nGrandpa and his uncle were very kind and willing to help. Kevin was in a good mood and happily followed them to the night market. Maybe he will leave soon, and he will really miss the delicious food in China. The mountains and rivers that Grandpa described are also very desirable. He will come back to visit them after he graduates from college.\nBoth the food and the scenery should not be wasted.\nLi Xia left a note and took the two children to the night market. Holding Jimmyâs hand on the way, she began to ask him questions.\nâJimmy, you said, took you to the night market. Which brother took you there?â\nâWe went together, three brothers and one sister.â\nâwhen?â\nâJust last night.â\nâYouâre so good, Shen Ruyi. You promised me to lose weight, but you went to the night market to eat late at night. With your good appetite, youâd be sorry for all those delicious foods if you didnât gain two pounds.â\nâWhat did you say, Aunt?â\nLi Xia turned around and said, âNo, nothing.â\nThe night market had just started to set up stalls, so she took the two children to a store and ordered three bowls of wontons. The wontons were stuffed with pork and shrimp, and the large wontons were considered a proper meal.\nShe always made sure the children had good food, and she always thought that just eating skewers was not enough. No wonder Yiyi was so chubby that he needed to lose weight.\nThe two children followed her obediently, and after eating wontons, the three of them began to walk slowly around the night market. Jimmy saw a small toy, and although the production was a bit primitive, the child liked it, so Li Xia paid for it without saying a word.\nKevin felt more confident and interested in going to the night market. After finishing the skewers in his hand, he covered his nose and asked Li Xia what she was selling.\nâWhy is it so smelly? But I see they seem to be eating. Can food really smell so bad?â\nâStinky tofu. Itâs a famous Hunan snack. It smells bad but tastes delicious.â\nThe brothers shook their heads, not believing that this thing could be eaten. Jimmy said, âI didnât smell this yesterday. It stinks.â\nThe more this happened, the more Li Xia wanted them to try it. After all, they were Chinese, so how could they not try the local specialties when they came here?\nâCome on, Iâll take you to try it. I guarantee youâll want to eat more after trying it.â\nâOh, no.â\nThe two brothers were obviously resisting, but Li Xia, in a playful mood, bought them some stinky tofu. Each of the three of them had a box, and the two brothers held the box as far away from themselves as possible.\nLi Xia didnât say much either. She ate the food with a bamboo stick and made an exaggerated expression as if it were delicious. The two brothers looked confused, and they hesitated whether to try it or not as they watched others eat.\nâIf you donât eat it, you will regret it later.â\nThe two brothers hesitated for a few minutes, and when they saw that Li Xia had almost finished her box, they finally looked at each other and reached out for a bamboo stick. They stabbed a piece of tofu with sauce on it and put it into their mouths with a fearless expression.\nThen they took a bite, and then another bite, and then they both opened their eyes. Jimmy said excitedly, âIt turns out itâs really delicious.â\nKevin said, âIt smells bad but tastes delicious.â\nLi Xia proudly threw away the empty box: âI was right, itâs delicious.â\nAs she was walking with them while eating, she suddenly heard someone calling her. She turned around and saw Shen Haiyang. âYou didnât take me with you to the night market.â\nâYou came here by yourself.â\nWith him around, communication with the two children is smoother. Walking slowly from east to west, Li Xia saw a silk scarf she liked and turned back to ask Shen Haiyang for his opinion, only to find that he was staring at it in a daze.\nâItâs Murong Danfengâs son.â Li Xia pretended to go over and said, âGo over and see what he is saying to that person.â\nâDonât alert the enemy.â Shen Haiyang grabbed her.\nâIs there any problem?â\nShen Haiyang nodded and didnât say much to his wife. The police were paying attention to them, had already found some clues, and were investigating further. How could he stand by the river and dry his shoes all the time?\nThe two of them took the children home, and the three little ones also came back from their evening self-study. Jimmy happily told Yiyi that he had eaten stinky tofu today, and Yiyi asked him quietly if he had told his mother about what happened last night.\nâI said, Brother is very nice.â\nYiyi Yi slapped his forehead and said, âItâs over.â\nâShen Ruyi,â his mother called out, and he turned back with a bitter face. Huihua and Shen Hui were both laughing at him. You little bastard, I let you eat secretly, and you told my mother that there is no such thing as a wall that is impenetrable.\nâMom, I will never eat it again.â\nâSet a goal for yourself. Put the scale in your room and monitor yourself every day. If you are still this fat at the age of sixteen, your mother will enroll you in a weight loss camp and have you do high-intensity exercise every day.â\nâNo, no, I control myself. Iâm over 150 now, and I want to reduce it to 120 by the end of this year. That should be fine, right?â\nHe is just over 1.6 meters tall, and if he weighs less than 120 to 130 grams, he is not too fat. Li Xia nodded. âYou said it yourself; keep your word.â\nâI will.â\nThere were two candies in his schoolbag, and he immediately took them out and gave them to his sister. Brush your teeth, wash your face, and go to bed. You should be more self-disciplined in managing your mouth in the future. Donât be lazy in physical education class; otherwise, mom will have to spend money to reduce his weight.\nIf her son wants to do something, he still has the willpower. Li Xia decided to supervise him and let the boy try to return to a normal body shape.\nControl your diet as a supplement, but donât be too strict and donât lack nutrition.\nThe main thing is to exercise. He canât just sit there after eating. He is about to enter the second growth period. With three measures to strengthen his body, he should be able to return to normal shape soon.\nKevin and Jimmy quietly went back to their rooms to sleep. The little one was addicted to stinky tofu and told his brother as he walked that he would buy two boxes to take on the plane when he returned to the United States.\nâNo. Such strong-tasting food is not allowed on the plane.â\nâThen Iâll eat more while Iâm here.â\nLi Xia smiled and thought about taking them out to the night market tomorrow. This time, she would drive farther and go to a different place. They probably didnât have much time left on the mainland, so it was just a good meal, not a big deal.\nAfter washing up and sleeping, she went to work the next day. Han Jun from the factory told her the news. âA Japanese company manager came to contact us and was very interested in our factory. He said he was interested in cooperating with us and that he would bring more advanced technology.â\nItâs the same set of tricks that have been used before. Now many domestic companies have their own shadows, joint ventures, and use their already existing technology in exchange for such a large market.\nâWould you like to meet him?â\nLi Xia shook her head. The result would be the same, whether she met him or not. She would rather have a hard time than hand it over to Japanese companies as a cradle for them to make money. She had discussed this with the old man long ago, and the old man had the same idea as her. She would rather have lower profits; as long as she could get through this period, she believed that domestic products would eventually rise.\nâBut if other factories agree and increase their advertising, Iâm afraid we will be squeezed out and have a hard time surviving.â\nâIâll find a way.â\nFor small home appliances, the first thing to consider is quality, and the second is price. After these two aspects are met, people will start to pay attention to appearance.Â Humph, you use a lot of advertising and prices to squeeze me, so I will fight back with appearance. Nowadays, when life is better and the price is not much different, appearance should be able to drive some sales.\nFans are now the most common black and white, but Li Xia decided to launch colored ones in the next batch. Fans are not very technical, so they can only focus on appearance. There are also rice cookers, which can be made small and beautiful, targeting middle-class families.\nWhen she got home at night, she went into her daughterâs room, took her daughterâs colored pencils and paper, and started drawing in the room. The large fan is designed to be majestic and steady, with a silver-gray base and white blades. The small fan is made of color as a whole, with some cute cartoon images added to the shape.\nShe designed a small desktop fan in the shape of a cat, painted eyes and a mouth on the top of its head, put two erect ears on it, and decorated it with colors.\nâWow, what a beautiful fan.â\nWhen Huihua came back from painting, she saw what her mother was drawing on the table. She immediately praised her. Li Xia looked up and smiled at her daughter, happy to have won her daughterâs heart.\nâYou think it looks good too?â\nâOf course. Mom, how did you come up with the idea to make the fan so beautiful?â\nâIf it were you, would you like these fancy things?â\nâYes. They are so cute, much prettier than the monotonous ones. They seem to have life.â\nShen Hui and Yiyi followed in after hearing the noise. The two boys were not as sensitive to this as the girls. The most important thing about a fan is that it can blow air.\nâIf Doraemon is made into a fan, I would consider buying it.â Everyone expressed their opinions one by one.\nâThen we have to buy the copyright, which increases the cost.â\nShe had just talked to her son about the cost in the evening, and the next day she went to the factory to show the R&D department her drawings. The department began to calculate what materials would be needed to produce something of the quality she had drawn.\nAfter some research, it was determined that this thing could be made. However, the production line had to be adjusted, the price would be slightly higher than before, and the initial adjustment of the model would require investment. Li Xia called a meeting for everyone to express their opinions.\nâIt looks good, but whatâs the point of a fan looking good?â Han Jun is indeed a straight man.\nâOf course I buy something I like.â Xiao Liu held up the blue bear and said, âI like this one, and my son will definitely like it too.â\nLi Xia looked at the third brother, who smiled innocently. âI really donât understand this. Anyway, if it were me, I would definitely choose the one with the lowest price if I could use it.â\nSeveral men objected, but Li Xia insisted on her own.\nIf the cooperation is successful, they will definitely be the first to deal with it. If you donât find a way to break through, it will be too late when you are surrounded by them.\nFans, rice cookers, electric kettles, and water dispensersâthe technology in their factory was already perfect, so she began to make a lot of improvements in appearance. Under the existing conditions, she tried to make them as beautiful as possible.\nâDirector, why donât we accept Japanese companies? They have technology, and the labor costs in China are low, so we can reduce production costs. If they start a price war with us, we estimateâ\nWhen Xiao Liu spoke, everyone was shocked. But the men who just didnât care about the appearance of the product supported Li Xia.\nâWe follow our own path and will never cooperate with these companies.â\nâYes, if we donât believe it, we wonât be able to walk out of our own path.â\nâThatâs right. Our country can make all the gadgets, so why canât we defeat them with these little gadgets?â\nLi Xia said the ugly words first: âIf we are attacked by the other party, we may face a financial crisis. If sales volume does not increase, everyoneâs bonus will also not increase. I hope that everyone can still work together like this and not hinder each other.â\nHan Jun spoke first: âDonât worry. I, Han Jun, will be the first to support you. As long as we have food to eat, we will never compromise.â\nLi Laosan also raised his hand and said, âI will definitely support you to the end.â\nXiao Liu said, âCount me in. As long as we have food to eat, we will stand together with the factory.â\nUnwilling to be controlled, she tried to survive in this turbulent era. As long as she could maintain her current status while saving her life, after the millennium, domestic products began to gradually emerge. With the rise of the motherland, consumers have gained national confidence and will no longer think that domestic products are inferior to foreign products for no reason.\nWhen faced with a crisis, she set herself a minimum goal: survival. As long as the factory could survive, she would not go the route of a joint venture or a controlling shareholder.\nWhen she got home to her daughterâs room, she sat down and drew all kinds of shapes, including petals, rabbits, and even fruits.\nâKnock Knock,â\nSomeone knocked on the door. She looked up and saw that it was the father-in-lawâs ex-wife. The woman came in through the curtain and spoke in a foreign language. She was talking a lot.\nâIâm sorry, I donât understand what youâre saying.â Li Xia was too lazy to listen and simply said she didnât understand. The old man is negotiating with you; why are you looking for me?\nâI heard that the factory is managed by you.â\nYou can speak Chinese; why are you pretending to be foreign to me then? You are Chinese, and now you have come to China, but you are not willing to speak Chinese? Just for this reason, Li Xiaâs impression of her dropped a lot.\nâYes.â\nThe woman spoke again, stuttering and intermittently, with a very strange accent, but she finally made her intention clear: she wanted Li Xia to withdraw the funds.\nâ No.â\nâWhy?â\nâBecause you are not my elder, I am not bound by you.â\nI donât care what you can do. Li Xia didnât waste words with her and directly refused. The woman wanted to say more, but the old man came in with a cane.\nThe two chatted again, and Li Xia hurried to get some water and medicine: âDad, donât get too agitated. We can find a way to solve the problem. If you get angry, it will be more trouble than gain.â\nHer words made the old man laugh, and he stopped arguing with the woman and took a sip of water from the cup. âI met the wrong person in my marriage. I didnât expect that I would have to go through this trouble when Iâm old.â\nâAs the old saying goes, the emperor has three poor relatives. Itâs normal for every family to have some troubles.â\nThey spoke very fast with a local accent, so the woman couldnât quite understand. She wanted to say something but couldnât get a word in. Li Xia helped the old man out of the west room, and she followed him all the way. But no matter whether she spoke in broken Chinese or fluent foreign languages, the two just ignored her.\nShe was so angry that she didnât eat at night. Qin Mu asked the old man if she should call her, but he waved his hand. After eating with his two grandsons in the backyard, he received a phone call and went to the front yard with his crutches.\nThe father-in-law must have come for something. Li Xia poured him some water and sat next to Shen Haiyang. The three of them sat down, and the old man spoke: âThe two childrenâs problems have been arranged. I had an old friend of mine help me find a foster family. It is a nice family. Middle-class couple who love kids. I paid for it, and they were happy to take care of them for the time being.â\nThe concept in the United States is different from that on the mainland. They care more about raising children. So many families will adopt these children. Let the children return to a familiar social environment. Children are young and adapt quickly. And it is best for the two brothers to be together.\nLi Xia and her husband nodded, and they agreed with the old manâs decision. They didnât have the time or energy to raise two more children who grew up abroad, so this arrangement was good for everyone.\nShen Haiyang asked, âWhen will you send them off?â\nâDonât worry. Letâs do this tomorrow.â\nThe old man gave some instructions, and Li Xia and her husband nodded. They gave their aunt a day off in the evening. The next morning, when the old manâs ex-wife went to the bathroom, she came back to find the door locked. Her suitcase was at the door.\nShe was so anxious that she shouted everywhere, but the family just disappeared. Someone saw her like this and called the police. As an overseas Chinese, the police took her back to the police station.\nAfter some investigation, it was found that except for the three children who were in school, no one else in the family could be contacted. When the eldest child, Shen Hui, was asked, the children replied that they didnât know.\nâDad said he had to leave for something, so the three of us stayed at my third uncleâs house for the time being.â\nLi Laosan(Third brother Li) also showed up to confirm this. âI donât know what happened, but they asked me to help take care of the children. And police officer, this woman is the ex-wife of my sisterâs father-in-law, and they divorced a long time ago.â\nOh, another new piece of news. It turns out that they are not a legal couple, but an ex-wife. This makes sense; no wonder they locked her out of the street.\nThe police wanted to contact the embassy to see what she should do. The woman also understood her situation and knew she was being kicked out.\nâNo, Iâll go by myself.â\nAs soon as the old man used his trick, she was immediately forced to leave. She took the train to Beijing, and not long after she got on the train, the old man returned home accompanied by Qin Mu.\nHe is nostalgic and not easy to control. His ex-wife has too many expectations about her ex-husband, who has been divorced for many years.\n\n",
    "88": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c53-2/\nLi Xia and Shen Haiyang drove to Shanghai with the two children and then went to the airport to handle the relevant procedures for the transportation of unaccompanied minors because the two children were minors. When they landed in the United States, the other party could pick up the children with their identity documents.\nAfter parking the car at the airport, they walked the two children into the terminal. After putting down their luggage, Shen Haiyang went to go through the formalities to get their boarding passes, while Li Xia told the children about what to do.\nâIf you encounter any problems, call grandpa or call your uncle. You are a minor, and we relatives will not leave you alone.â\nâThank you, auntie.â\nShen Haiyang went through the formalities while she waited with the children. She was told that the relevant staff would come in half an hour. She walked around and observed. She might find inspiration from the fans and ornaments in the airport. Now that the factory is facing an impact, she is always thinking about R&D. No one in the R&D department cares about market research as much as she does.\nHey, that seems to be Murong Danfeng over there. She is dragging a big box in her hand, and she is walking slowly. She is looking around while walking.\nThe second time she saw her at the airport, Antiques again? What kind of foreign business was she doing? Why did she sell all the antiques abroad? Although Shen Haiyang didnât say anything specific, she could guess that Murong Danfeng must be up to something.\nShe paid attention to Murong Danfeng, and then she found that Murong Danfeng sat down in the lobby, and she didnât seem to be in a hurry to check in. Curious, she looked around, and then she found that Murong Danfengâs husband was carrying the luggage through the security check, and he looked a little anxious.\nHe was going through a security check while Murong Danfeng was walking out with her suitcase. She didnât understand what the couple was doing. She followed her out of the hall, and then Murong Danfeng suddenly sped up. Li Xia found a woman running towards her at high speed.\nThe woman was agile, and Murong Danfeng also ran very fast. She was stopped in the parking lot while she was pulling a suitcase, and then she took out her ID to search her suitcase on the spot.\nMurong Danfeng was very calm, shrugging her shoulders and looking indifferent. The woman asked her for the password to the box, but she hesitated and refused to tell her. The woman had no way to deal with her for a while, and the two sides were in a stalemate.\nLi Xia stepped forward and said what she had guessed: âThe thing you want to find may not be in her suitcase. She was followed by her husband. I donât know where he bought the ticket to fly to. I saw him go through security just now; maybe he will board the plane and take off soon. â\nThe woman came back to her senses immediately after hearing this. This case involved a lot of people, and they were short of manpower. She didnât realize that Murong Danfeng had an accomplice. After finding the clues, they followed the clues to the airport. Seeing her carrying a suitcase and looking like she was running away, they immediately chased her. But it turned out that this woman was escaping by using a trick.\nWhen Murong Danfeng heard Li Xiaâs words, her expression changed, and she looked at her as if she were an enemy. âLi Xia, you little bitch. You have a grudge against my sister, but donât throw dirty water on me like this. Whatâs the matter? The last time your son hit my son, we had to pay compensation. You, Scoundrel, canât you see that I am doing well? You keep talking nonsense all day long.â\nMurong Danfeng rushed forward as she spoke. Since someone was looking for trouble, Li Xia had no choice but to fight back. The two women soon started fighting each other.\nThe policewoman subconsciously stepped forward to separate them, and a gleam of light flashed in Murong Danfengâs eyes. The plane is about to take off, and as long as we leave the country, you canât do anything about it.\nâDonât worry about us. Go chase her, man. It will be too late once the plane takes off.â\nThe policewoman kicked Murong Danfeng hard and rescued Li Xia from her. Li Xia took the opportunity to kick Murong Danfeng as well, and then told the policewoman to chase the man.\nâDonât waste time. If you continue to waste time, that person will leave on a plane.â\nâBut sheâ¦â What if this is a trick she used to lure the tiger away from the mountain, to lure her away to capture the man, and it turns out that the box in her hand is a cultural relic?\nâI will look after her.â\nWith the help of the female police, Li Xia had already restrained Murong Danfeng and pinned her to the ground. As they were talking, Murong Danfeng suddenly smiled.\nâHa ha,â\nShe suddenly burst into laughter, and the policewoman was completely unsure. She didnât know Murong Danfeng and Li Xia; could they be in the same group? She acted separately from her senior brother, and the handcuffs she brought were with her senior brother, so she couldnât handcuff the suspect at the moment.\nSeeing that she didnât believe her, Li Xia fumbled around anxiously. Finally, she took out her ID card from her pocket. âHere, if Iâm in cahoots with her, you can go find me.â\nJust as the policewoman was about to believe it, Murong Danfeng said, âItâs just an ID card. We can make as many fake IDs as you want.â\nAfter she said that, the female police officer made a decision. She raised her hand to pick up the box on the ground and drag it into the building. Evidence cannot be lost, and cultural relics cannot be lost. As long as the cultural relics are recovered, the suspect can be caught if he escapes.\nShe dragged a heavy box, and she had already exerted her potential to the extreme. The elevator was too slow, and there were too many people up there. The woman chose the stairs directly, running out of breath but not daring to stop.\nAt the boarding gate, the man boarded the plane. Fortunately, the female police officer had her work ID and immediately slid him down when the plane was about to close the door.\nThe big box he carried with him also fell into the hands of the female police officer this time. Both boxes were password boxes, and they could not be opened for a while without the other partyâs permission. Now that there is time, she can choose to break them violently, but there are national treasures inside, so she should take them back to the police station first.\nâHello, comrade, you were chasing Murong Danfeng, right? Did you see a woman following her?â\nShen Haiyang accompanied his nephew to wait for the staff, but his wife was missing. He searched everywhere in the airport but couldnât find her. At this time, he saw the female police arrest Murong Danfengâs husband, holding the coupleâs two suitcases in her hands, so he quickly came over to ask.\nâWhat is her name?â\nâLi Xia.â\nThe policewoman took out Li Xiaâs ID card and gave it to him. âIs it her?â\nâYes, yes, where is she now?â\nâParking lot, she said, help me keep an eye on the suspect.â\nâOh, OK, Iâll go find her.â He took out his ID and handed it to the policewoman. âHereâs my ID.â\nâOh, you are from the procuratorate. Hello.â\nâHello, Iâm going to find my wife first.â\nThe man was handed over to the airport police for guarding, and the female police officer tried to open the two boxes in the airport duty room. Shen Haiyang followed the airport police to the parking lot to look for his wife, but when he arrived, he only found traces on the ground.\nMurong Danfengâs car drove away, and Li Xia disappeared. Judging from the traces at the scene, she must have been dragged into the car.\nShen Haiyang panicked. Where would Murong Danfeng take his wife? This case should be a gang crime. Murong Danfeng might not have done this for the first time. Did she take Li Xia to the gang?\nAll the cases he had heard of and encountered flew through his mind at once, and the more he thought about them, the more scared he became. For such a gang, Murong Danfeng might have some weapons on her, and his wife, an ordinary person, might have fallen into the trap of the criminals.\nFollowing the police back to the airport police station, the female police officer was also shocked when she heard the news. The situation was too urgent at the time, and she had already kicked Murong Danfeng hard, thinking that she had no chance of turning the tables.\nâI was careless. Time was really too tight, and there was no time to do anything.â\nAfter a phone call, the parties reunited. The box was quickly opened and identified by cultural relic experts. It was indeed freshly dug out of the ground. Preliminary analysis showed that it was used for sacrifices during the former Qin Dynasty. The stone drum was engraved with small seal characters, recording a major historical event. This thing is quite valuable and is a national treasure. It is definitely not allowed to be traded privately and taken out of the country.\nâHow did they get through security?â\nThe airport staff replied, âThey have trading permits and certificates to prove that this is a counterfeit.â\nShen Haiyang asked anxiously, âWhat about my wife? You must go and catch up with her as soon as possible.â\nA police officer replied, âWe have sent someone to look for her; donât worry.â\nHow could he not be anxious? He recently had heart surgery; otherwise, the disease would have recurred. He silently put a pill in his mouth, called someone he knew, and asked them to intercept Murong Danfengâs car as soon as possible, and he sat there anxiously waiting for news.\nAt Li Xiaâs side, time went back to the policewoman dragging the suitcase away. She controlled Murong Danfeng and looked around for a rope to tie her hands and feet.\nBut where can a rope be found in the parking lot? Naturally, nothing was found. Murong Danfeng saw the police leave and began to play the emotional card with her.\nâLi Xia, can you let me go first?â\nâno.â\nâI was wrongly accused. The box contained only ordinary antiques. The police made a mistake. Donât make trouble for me.â\nâWhether itâs a mistake or not, it will become clear when the police arrive.â\nâLi Xia, we know each other; why are you so heartless?â\nâWhen did I have a relationship with you?â\nShe wanted to play the emotional card, but Li Xiaâs words could choke people to death. She was so angry that she rolled her eyes on the ground, and then she remembered that she had put something good in her waist.\nâI might be having my period; please let me put some paper under me.â\nâItâs such a coincidence. Donât play tricks.â\nâah,â\nShe yelled in anger. Li Xia looked down and noticed a red mark on her face. This girl really had her period. As a woman, she understood the embarrassment of women. Even if she broke the law, she should have the last bit of dignity, right? Saying that she had to pee was a lie, but you couldnât fake your period.\nWhat should she do? Murong Danfeng was not a vicious person, so she was a little relaxed about it and thought about covering it with something. The police would also cover the handcuffs when they took the suspect away because the suspect had not been convicted. She was not a criminal yet.\nWhile hesitating, Murong Danfeng touched the bottle of spray gas. Li Xia thought she was struggling because she was uncomfortable during her period, but she unexpectedly sprayed chloroform gas on her.\nThe chloroform gas, although not directed at the mouth and nose, passed out without any time to react after inhalation. Murong Danfeng dragged her into the car and drove away at high speed.\nThere werenât as many cameras in this era as in later generations, so it wasnât easy to find an ordinary car. Murong Danfeng made the choice in a hurry, and as she drove farther and farther away, she herself was confused and didnât know where to go.\nShe would probably dig up a lot of things for reselling cultural relics. But this crime would only get her a few years in prison, but if she hurt someoneâs life, she would be courting death.\nHide? Where can she hide by herself? If she wants to hide, she has to put Li Xia down in the trunk first; otherwise, she canât hide. And she has to give up the car because the license plate will be tracked. Should she take the train?\nThe crime she was involved in was not a serious one. If her sisterâs affair was discovered, it would be fatal. However, her husband didnât know about her sisterâs affair, so it was okay for him to be caught.\nBut what should she do? Will he take the blame for her??\nShe was confused and didnât know where to go. She drove the car with a restless heart. She didnât dare to trust the man completely, but she also expected him to be loyal and righteous. She hurriedly dragged Li Xia into the car, but now she regretted looking for a place to secretly put her down.\nAs she panicked, Li Xia in the trunk was awakened by the wind. She felt weak all over and opened her eyes to understand where she was. Although her body had not recovered yet, she looked around for ways to seek help.\nShe searched around in the trunk and found a wrench under her feet. She hadnât recovered yet, so she waited until she could lift the wrench, and then she started to use it to hit the headlight.\nThe trunk of this car cannot be opened. She smashed it again and again. Finally, the headlight fell off. She took off her coat and put it outside through the hole. She wanted to let the passing cars see it.\nNo, thinking of this, she quickly put her clothes back on. After attracting the attention of passersby, they might remind Murong Danfeng; after all, they didnât know what was going on inside.\nDonât be impatient; donât be impatient; wait for the opportunity. She lay down quietly and thought about the countermeasures. Soon the car stopped, and she saw through the hole that there was a gas station outside.\nThe opportunity had come. She remained silent, like a hunter waiting for an opportunity. When she heard Murong Danfeng ask someone if there was a bathroom, the other person replied that it was on the east side.\nShe tied her clothes around her waist and wanted to get out of the car to solve her physiological problem. Li Xia seized the opportunity, holding the wrench, and asked for help outside.\nâHelp, help,â\nWhen she shouted, the staff at the gas station immediately looked over here. Murong Danfeng panicked and hurriedly got out of the car to open the trunk. At the same time, she did not forget to hold the bottle of chloroform in her hand.\nâboom,â\nLi Xia held her breath tightly, firmly believing in the principle of striking first to gain the upper hand. She had been tricked before because she was soft-hearted, but this time it was self-defense, and she would act decisively.\nThe moment the trunk was opened, a wrench was swung over, hitting the arm of Murong Danfeng holding the spray. She screamed in pain, and the spray in her hand fell to the ground. At the same time, she stepped back subconsciously because of the attack.\nLi Xia came out of the trunk without hesitation. She raised her hands and attacked her legs one after another, causing her to scream in pain. This series of actions stunned the staff member. How could someone lock her in the trunk when she was so strong?\nHow did she lose it? Of course, because she was soft-hearted. He who strikes first is strong, and he who strikes later will suffer. You donât need to give some people dignity, because they donât deserve it.\n\n",
    "89": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c54/\nCHAPTER 54\nAfter subduing Murong Danfeng in a few moves, Li Xia asked someone to find a rope to tie her up. The gas station staff asked, “Should we call the police?”\n“She’s a suspect on the run. The police should know about this. Forget it. I’ll drive to the police station.”\nShe originally wanted to drive back to the airport but then decided to go to the nearest police station. She tied the woman up and threw her in the back seat, then drove all the way to the local police station.\nComing here, there is naturally a set of procedures, and soon they contacted Shanghai. Shen Haiyang heard her voice on the phone and finally put down his hanging heart.\n“Are you hurt?”\n“No, I am fine.”\n“That’s good. You wait for me there, there, there, and I’ll drive to find you.”\n“Be careful on the road.”\n“Um.”\nThe case was transferred to the Provincial Public Security Bureau, and the female police officer, who had met Li Xia before, took Murong Danfeng away. “Comrade Li Xia, you helped us solve the case of smuggling cultural relics this time. I will recommend you for the credit.”\nLi Xia waved her hand and said, “It’s okay; it’s my duty as a citizen.”\nThe policewoman saluted her and said, “I’ll go first. I will report your deeds truthfully.”\n~~~~~~~~~\nLi Xia took a shower and had a meal before Shen Haiyang came and dressed herself up. He must have been scared when she suddenly disappeared, so she wanted him to see her like this to comfort him.\nShen Haiyang drove several hours to pick her up, and the couple took the highway from here and returned to the provincial capital. Li Xia wanted to take over his driving, but he refused.\n“Angry?”\n“No.” Shen Haiyang sighed and hugged her tightly. “It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have told you about the great principles of family, country, and the world. You are so brave to help the police catch the suspect. I think it’s normal for me to do this, but I’m really scared when you do it.”\n“It’s okay, it’s okay. She’s not a vicious murderer.”\nLi Xia fell silent at this point. Even rabbits bite when they are angry, let alone criminals who are at the end of their rope. She wanted to help the police, but she forgot that she was not a professional at all.\n“I will never make this mistake again next time. I will put some self-defense items in my bag and tie them up after I subdue them, and I won’t let them go no matter what.”\nShen Haiyang was really scared this time, but he also knew that if it weren’t for his wife, the things would have been taken away, and the couple would have continued to beat the risk of escape.\nShe has made contributions to the motherland. Although something went wrong, how can professionals guarantee that there will be no mistakes? Taking a deep breath to digest the negative emotions caused by worry, he reached out and hugged his wife tightly.\n“I’ll find a way to get you some special self-defense moves and a spray, so you can be prepared when you’re alone outside.”\nShen Haiyang said no more, thinking about what to buy for her to protect herself. Not to mention this incident, even if she was alone outside, it would be good to carry it with her. It was nonsense to say that he was worried because she couldn’t stay at home and not go out.\n“But we agreed that you should not interfere easily in matters that do not endanger you.”\n“I know. This time I knew Murong Danfeng, and I discovered that she might be up to something. If I didn’t know her, I wouldn’t know what she was doing, so I wouldn’t easily interfere. If I got in the way of the public security personnel, I would be doing more harm than good.”\nLi Xia smiled and said, “Then I’ll drive…”\nShen Haiyang touched her head and let her sit in the passenger seat. “I’m in good health now. I’m relieved that you’re safe. There’s no problem with driving. Just sit down and rest.”\n“Then I’ll rest.”\n“Okay.”\nAs the car started, Shen Haiyang noticed that his wife was stealing glances at him. The man was very tactful and asked directly without her asking, “Do you want to ask how many years Murong Danfeng will be sentenced this time?”\nLi Xia’s eyes lit up, up, up, and she nodded slightly. It was she who caught Murong Danfeng. It was her first time participating in such a thing. She finally caught the person without any danger. Maybe she could implicate the person behind the scenes through the couple.\n“This is a national treasure. Both the font and the content have great research value. They took away several pieces right after they were unearthed. They were almost taken out of the country.”\n“So, how long will the sentence be? Tell me in secret. I won’t tell anyone.”\n“This is a gang. The sentence will depend on what they did in the gang. I estimate that Murong Danfeng will get at least five years.”\nNo matter what, it’s good that the criminals have been caught. Her husband works in the procuratorate, and under his influence, she has a strong sense of justice. She didn’t think much about her own safety when she encountered it but only thought about not letting the suspect run away. Murong Danfeng was in charge of contacting the resellers, so she must know a lot.\n“The people of the Murong family are really bold.”\nShen Haiyang has been a relative of Murong’s family for many years, so he has some understanding of them. “Benefits: their family members are very profit-oriented. If you don’t have the idea that a gentleman loves money but earns it in a proper way, you will be swallowed up by money little by little, and you will be lucky enough to get rich, and then your greed will be getting bigger and bigger.”\n“Murong Danfeng cried and said she regretted it. That’s bullshit. If she hadn’t been caught, she wouldn’t have regretted it.”\nShen Haiyang laughed. “Well, she regrets being arrested, not that she shouldn’t have done something illegal.”\nThe couple drove all the way back to the provincial capital and did not tell their family about these things on the way, so as not to worry them. Soon they received a call from the United States, and the two children had been arranged by the old man’s good friend.\nThe underage children were settled, and the grandfather was relieved. The weather was fine this weekend, and the old man was in a good mood in the afternoon and said he would treat everyone to dinner in the evening.\n“Sichuan hotpot. I remember that our children love it.”\nShen Hui was very considerate of his grandfather: “Let’s have the mutton, sesame paste, chives, fermented bean curd, and some chopped green onions and coriander for grandpa.”\nThe old man smiled and said, “Okay, give me more coriander.”\nHuihua and Yiyi smiled and agreed with their brother: “So, should we go out to eat this northern mutton hotpot or eat it at home? Make more dipping sauce, and Grandpa can eat whatever he likes.”\nQin Mu said on the side, “Then eat at home. I’ll go buy some groceries.”\nThe old man waved his hand to stop her: “Don’t bother; I’ll take them out to eat. We don’t have a soup base at home, and the atmosphere is not like outside.”\n“Fine.”\nThe family drove to eat, and the aunt at home went home early from getting off work, and Qin Mu went with them. Thanks to her careful care of the old man over the years, she would be invited to such occasions.\nTwo cars drove to the restaurant. They didn’t order any wine in the private room, but the drinks and dishes that were ordered were definitely enough to cover the cost of the private room. They wanted the best quality lamb from the Inner Mongolian grasslands. There was a big copper hot pot in the middle, and the atmosphere was very good.\n“Let’s cook the mutton first. That way, the soup will be rich, and the vegetables and vermicelli will be more fragrant later.”\nEveryone in the family eats meat, so Qin Mu tells everyone out of habit. When the fat mutton changes color after being put into the pot, it can be taken out, put into the dipping bowl, and handed to the old man.\n“Be careful with the heat.”\n“Mm, it tastes good.”\nHotpot is a dish that can cater to everyone’s preferences. There are so many dishes that you can always find your favorite. Today, the restaurant imported some large shrimp, and Li Xia ordered two pounds. She also ordered a portion of the fish balls they made themselves.\nAfter the mutton, she added prawns and fish balls. After tasting the fish balls, she found that they were very much to her liking. Huihua and Qin Mu also liked it, so she ordered two more. She and Shen Haiyang sat near the door so that they could take care of everyone. If they saw something that everyone liked, they would immediately order more.\nWhen the conversation was almost over, Qin Mu went to the bathroom and came back to tell Li Xia that she had run into someone she knew. “We almost had a fight, but when I turned around, I realized it was someone I knew.”\n“Friends?”\n“No. A young girl was washing her hands and splashing water everywhere, and she splashed it on my face. I got angry and turned around to ask her to apologize, but then I found out that we were investors together and had met before.”\n“Investment? I haven’t heard you mention that.”\n“We are just small fry; we can’t compare with you.”\n“Pay attention to the safety of funds and clarify the investment projects.”\nQin Mu was unwilling to elaborate, and Li Xia could not ask more questions, so she kindly reminded her that after all, it was someone else’s business, and they were not happy to say so, so she should not ask too much. If she asked too much, it would seem like she was showing off her ability, which would disgust people.\n“Well, the boss said it’s safe, and you can make a lot of money.”\nWhen she said this, Li Xia immediately had a bad feeling. Pyramid schemes and illegal fundraising—it was only the early 1990s; had they already emerged? Or was she overthinking it?\nIn her previous life, she had also encountered pyramid selling in the county town. She bought a swing machine that was said to be good for exercising. Then you get into a group, and the more recruits you have, the more commissions you get.\nA pyramid scheme is a business model that earns primarily by enrolling others in the scheme; however, rather than earning income (or providing returns on investments) by selling legitimate products to end consumers, it mainly earns by recruiting new members with the promise of payments (or services). As recruiting multiplies, the process quickly becomes increasingly difficult until it is impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.\nShe didn’t know it was illegal at the time; she just thought that if she became the last in line, she would only invest the money and not make any money. If she recruited friends and relatives to be in the scheme, scheme, scheme, and if they became the last in line, she would be cheating them, so she didn’t do it.\n“Mom, we are full; let’s go downstairs to pay the bill.”\n“Oh, OK.” I’ll talk to her when I get home. Our two families are so close that I can’t just watch her fall into this trap. At least I’ll do my best to talk to her. If she doesn’t listen, there’s nothing I can do. do. do. ~ Li Xia thought.\nThe group went downstairs to pay the bill. A young couple at the corner of the first floor saw them and stood up. The girl came over and looked at Qin Mu, and the man spoke to Li Xia.\n“Aunt, did you guys come here to eat too?”\nLi Xia turned around and saw her nephew and smiled, “Yeah. You’re here to eat here too, alone?”\n“No, I came with my girlfriend.”\nThe quick-talker had finished speaking, and he turned around and pulled the girl over. “This is my girlfriend, Xue Qin. Qinqin, come and say hello. This is my aunt, the one I mentioned to you.”\n“Hello, aunt.”\nHis aunt is a well-known entrepreneur in the province. She is an advanced person and a pioneer in getting rich. Xue Qin is the object of her worship, and she wants to get to know this outstanding woman. She didn’t expect to meet her here. And the lady who invested with her seemed to know her, and they were very close.\n“Hello.”\nThe girl smiled and took the opportunity to speak: “I know Sister Qin…”\nLi Xia pointed around with a smile and said, “This is not the place to talk.”\nThe girl smiled even brighter: “Then can I visit you at your home? We can talk in person.”\n“next time.”\n“That’s good. Take care, little aunt. I’ll visit you another day.”\nAfter Li Xia and her group left, her nephew Li Xuedong waved goodbye to his elders and boasted to his girlfriend, “I was right; wasn’t my aunt really amazing?”\nXue Qin smiled like a flower. “Let’s go tomorrow, okay?”\n“I have to go to work tomorrow. I’ll go with you the day after tomorrow.”\nAs for Li Xia, she kept shaking her head at her nephew on the way home. Since she came to the city, he has been dazzled by all the flowers. He has dated several girls, all of whom are fashionable. She is not saying that being fashionable is bad; she just thinks her nephew is not worthy of her. The two of them standing together are obviously not a good match, and it is unclear what the girl wants to do by being with him.\n“How old is Xuedong this year?” After parking the car and getting out, Shen Haiyang started chatting.\n“Twenty-seven. People his age in the countryside are already fathers, but he still can’t settle down. My eldest brother and his wife are so worried.”\n“Didn’t you say before that he was interested in a girl in the workshop? Why did he change his mind again?”\n“He is spoiled for choice.”\nAs they were talking, they opened the door and entered the yard. Qin Mu helped the old man back to the backyard while Li Xia and the others fetched water to wash up. After a while, someone shouted that it was her third brother who had arrived.\n“Xia, are you home?”\n“Yes, I just got back.”\nThe third brother came in after opening the door. Li Xia and the third brother sat on the sofa. He told her about some work matters, and after that, the two siblings sat there chatting and talked about their childhood.\n“Sewing machines were so popular back then. There was only one in our village in the 1970s. Now they are rarely used at home.”\n“Yes, your third sister-in-law is diligent in cleaning, but she is rarely using it. Nowadays, clothes are bought ready-made.”\nYiyi was outside, gossiping with his sister and brother and talking to them in a low voice. “Looking back, do you think we will be like our mom and uncle when we are this age?”\nShen Hui nodded. “It’s very likely. You’d better deliver on what you promised to give me; otherwise, I’ll bring it up every time I see you.”\n“Brother, you are so stingy. You won’t be as stingy as our father, will you?”\n“So you plan to delay it until more than 20 years later, when I will be as broad-minded as our father and not care about it, and then you can default on your debt.”\n“Shen Ruyi, you promised to buy me a hairpin.”\nWhen Huihua also followed her brother and teased him on purpose, she said, You little bastard, we are the older brothers and sisters at home, and you are the younger brother.\n“I will buy it. I’m saving money.”\nYiyi had a bitter face. He didn’t have a penny to spend on half a year’s pocket money. Forget it. Forget it. That sister is really pitiful. For a single-parent family, this is really adding insult to injury. He doesn’t have to spend it. All this is a matter of life and death for that sister’s family.\nHuihua and Shen Hui were teasing him on purpose. They knew he was helping a classmate, so how could they embarrass him? They just took the opportunity to tease him. Usually, when the brat was saving money, they would buy him food and daily necessities.\nThe children went to watch TV. “Shanghai Family” was a popular TV series this year, and they liked it very much. The two boys didn’t like it very much, so they went to watch the old black-and-white TV these days.\nBefore the TV show started, the two brothers looked at each other and decided to go find their mother. Yiyi and Shen Hui entered the living room, where his father was reading a magazine.\n“Looking for Mom?”\nThe two brothers nodded and said one by one, “We have something important to ask our mother.”\n“Mom has something to say to Aunt Qin Mu. Please sit and wait. She should be back soon.”\nLi Xia hadn’t come back yet, so he moved closer to his son and imitated his mysterious look. “What’s the big deal about looking for Mom? Why don’t you talk to Dad first?”\n“There’s a set of commercials aired during prime time, shot by this year’s popular star, Lin.” The brat deliberately kept it a secret, and Shen Haiyang guessed it after thinking about it: “Electronic commercials?”\n“Yes. The products of the joint venture. Rice cookers, electric heaters, and microwave ovens completely overlap with my mother’s factory. They have invested so much money; if my mother didn’t advertise on TV, who would buy her products? Now people talk about brands; it’s different from before.”\nLi Xia came in and patted him lightly. “Your mother’s products are also branded.”\n“What’s the point if no one knows?” He said quickly and patted himself: “I was wrong; I was just a little anxious. But now everyone is talking about famous brands. What is a famous brand? Ordinary people think that a famous brand is one that everyone knows. Just like us children, when we talk about sports shoes, we think of Adidas and other brands that everyone knows. Under the same conditions, we will definitely buy the brand we know.”\nThe two sons have a keen sense of business. They thought of their mother’s factory when they saw a TV commercial. Maybe she always said that they would be in charge of the factory in the future, so they started to pay attention to the development of electronics before they even reached adulthood.\n“Mom,” Shen Hui said, “we both feel that your previous advertising was not strong enough. Is it because the factory is short on funds that you didn’t hire celebrities or put a large number of ads on major TV stations?”\n“There are factors in this regard.”\nYiyi gritted his teeth. “Even if we have to borrow money, I think we have to do this advertisement. It’s no longer the era where good wine needs no bush. If you don’t advertise, others won’t know about your products at all.”\nShen Hui added, “You need to find a big star. Nowadays, everyone is watching TV, and those big stars are very popular. If the price is the same, the good things recommended by the big stars in the advertisements will definitely be the first choice.”\nDon’t mention it; this kind of thinking is really in line with the current trend. Li Xia also understands this principle. The era of fierce competition has arrived, and the eight immortals will show their magical powers.\n“Got it. Mom will consider it.”\nThe next day at work, the first thing to be discussed at the meeting was this issue. Everyone also watched TV and realized this. They had previously placed advertisements, but now that the Japanese capital was coming in with great force and trying to squeeze them out, they naturally could not just sit there and wait for death.\nHan Jun spoke first: “The price of TV’s prime time should be very high, plus how much would it cost if we wanted to invite big stars?? I have no objection to shooting commercials, but do we have that much money to invest?”\nXiao Liu knows the factory’s financial situation best, and his words are very sharp. “If we hire celebrities and put them on TV, we may not have enough funds.”\nMost of the profits from the factory over the years have been used for development, and she used her personal expenses to buy a villa for the old man and two cars for the family. The car is a facade and cannot be saved, and the house is also prepared for demolition.\nIt is impossible for people to earn money without spending it. What is the meaning of earning money? When funds are tight, they go to collect the money owed to them. These guys really delay as long as they can. If you don’t chase them, they will think you have enough funds and don’t care. You can also find a business partner to borrow money from and treat it as an investment in the short term. Many people do this.\n“Have the final payments of those dealers been paid?”\n“No.”\n“Han Jun, I’ve given this job to you. Hurry up and get the money back. We have a lot of expenses here, and we have to settle accounts with several machinery factories in Central China later. We have to hurry up and pay off the money owed to us.”\nHan Jun nodded. “Okay, got it; I’ll contact them right away.”\nShe turned around and asked Fang Long, “How are you studying the drawings I gave you? Is it feasible?”\n“It’s feasible. We just need to modify the exterior production line.”\n“Then you can make a few samples first and let Han Jun find customers to sell them. Let’s see how effective they are.”\n“OK.”\n \n\n",
    "90": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c54-2/\nThe peak season for electric fan sales starts after the Chinese New Year, and it slowly starts from the south to the north. The fan workshop is now suspended, waiting for samples to be produced, and now they are looking for orders for new products. They are advertising in advance and preparing for a new round of battles.\n“Then, what about the advertising?” Fang Long asked.\n“I’ll contact some celebrities to see if there are any suitable ones.”\nThe factory doesn’t have a dedicated person in charge of this area now, so it’s usually handled by her and Han Jun. She leaves the capital turnover and new product matters to Han Jun, and she takes care of the commercials herself.\nWhen she went home to pack her luggage for a business trip, Shen Haiyang came in and asked, “Are you going to Beijing or Shanghai?”\n“I am going to Shanghai first, and then to Beijing if that doesn’t work.”\nLi Xia left by train, and not long after she left, Li Xuedong came home with his girlfriend. After being told that she was not at home, the girl talked to Shen Haiyang about investment for half an hour.First, invest in buying a former Soviet ship and convert it into a cruise hotel. They said this project has great prospects, and many people are vying to invest.\n“Uncle-in-law, you should have money, right? This project is definitely a big money-making project, with a 300% return rate..”\n“I have no money.”\nShen Haiyang is really a bachelor; he doesn’t care about his face at all. The girl was choked by these three words, stopped wasting her time recommending him, and stood up and said goodbye politely.\n“Then I will come to visit you again when my aunt comes back. I’m leaving first. Bye, uncle.”\nAfter the couple left, Shen Haiyang shook his head and laughed. What the hell was going on? There are so many shell companies nowadays that it is hard to tell which is real or fake. But even if he didn’t understand business investment, it sounded unreliable. He was in the Anti-Corruption Bureau now, so this kind of thing was not his responsibility. But he still called the relevant department to report the matter.\nHe naturally didn’t mention this to Li Xia over the phone, as he himself thought it was unreliable. The three children kept asking when their mother would be back, and he just said it would be soon.\n“You are all in high school now; take care of your own affairs; don’t let Mom worry about you.\nI’m very busy and can’t take care of you.”\n“We know.”\nHuihua was practicing piano and calligraphy every day. Shen Hui and Yiyi don’t need Shen Haiyang to worry about their studies. Li Xia was away for eight days, and when she came back, she smiled and shook her head when she saw Shen Haiyang’s inquiring face.\n“I’ve looked for the few I could find, but either they were busy filming or their prices were too high. There are two male actors, but my style this time is cute, so they don’t fit in.”\nAs she spoke, she unpacked her suitcase and luggage. Shen Haiyang also came to help. “What about the advertisement?”\n“I talked to a director from our provincial film studio, and he can find a team to take on this job. As for the actors, our three monkeys will play the roles. Cute kids paired with cute home appliances may have a better effect than the actors.”\n“The kids don’t have this kind of experience; they will mess it up.”\n“We just want to capture the feeling of an ordinary family. We produce household appliances, so there’s nothing wrong with taking photos of family members.”\nThe three children at home were very interested when they heard about this. Yiyi had acted in a movie before, and he was very relaxed when he was young, so he is still very relaxed now that he has grown up. Shen Hui was not very relaxed at that time, but now he heard that he would act in an advertisement, just a small clip, so he thought he could give it a try.\n“Starting next Saturday afternoon, I’ll pick you up after school.”\n“Mom, where’s the script?” Yiyi asked. Seeing that his mother had nothing to take, he said helplessly, “Even if it’s an advertisement, it needs creativity and a script. Otherwise, how can we shoot it?”\n“I know. There will be.”\nShe finished writing the script before Friday and showed it to Shen Haiyang first. “What do you think?”\n“Good.”\n“Then let’s go find the director.”\nIn order to shoot this commercial, they consulted with the director and moved the piano from home to the studio. They quickly set up the location before the children went to bed.\nHan Jun and Li Laosan led the workers to move the piano, and Li Xuedong and his girlfriend came to see Li Xia again. Shen Haiyang mentioned the project that the girl mentioned to Li Xia, and she naturally knew that it was unreliable. He had already reported it to the relevant departments, so he just had to wait for the relevant departments to deal with it.\n“Aunt…”\nAfter speaking out these words anxiously, Li Xia raised her hand to interrupt: “I have no other plans to invest at the moment.”\n“Aunt, this is a formal company. Our boss is a genuine person. If you don’t believe me, I’ll take you to meet him. We are a registered company.”\n“No thanks, I don’t have time.”\nAfter that, she scolded her nephew in front of everyone without giving him any face. “You forgot what your parents said, didn’t you? Be a down-to-earth person and work hard. If your father knows what you are doing, you know the repercussions.”\n“I understand, little aunt.”\nHaving worked for Li Xia for many years, and with his parents repeatedly emphasizing that he should listen to his aunt, he was in awe of Li Xia. This was because he was blinded by lust and brainwashed by his girlfriend; otherwise, he would not dare come to Li Xia to talk about investment.\n“Work hard. If I find out you’re not working hard, you can go back home.”\n“Yes, I understand.”\nLi Xuedong left dejectedly with his girlfriend. Han Jun came out of the yard and asked curiously, “It was your nephew, right? Why is he leaving right after he got here?”\n“He came to raise funds with his girlfriend? It sounds so unreliable; maybe it’s a scam.”\nQin Mu came out and stood next to Han Jun.Jun. “No way, what they said sounded so real. That project…”\nLi Xia turned around and asked, “Is this the investment you mentioned before?” After asking twice, she said that the other party was very reliable. Is this reliable?\nQin Mu hesitated, and Han Jun slapped his forehead: “Hurry up and find someone to get the money back. Why are you such an idiot?? Is it so easy to invest?”\n“I know a lot of people who have invested in it. They say that the money can be multiplied several times in two years. I think it’s just like you guys opening a factory. The profit is distributed to the investors. Isn’t that right?”\nHan Jun spoke in an anxious tone: “How much registered capital does the other company have? Project implementation plan, investment amount, and target consumer group. Market analysis, risk assessment—have you read all of these?”\n“No.” Qin Mu panicked. It turned out that investing was so troublesome. She just listened to that person and told them how much money they could earn in a year. How could she understand that?\nHan Jun sighed helplessly: “Go get it back quickly; I’m going to call the police. This is a fake company; it’s just a bunch of rip-offs.”\n“Oh, I’ll go now. I’ll ask Sister Xu to come with me.”\n————\nWhen they went to ask for money, Han Jun called the police. After coming out, he directed the workers to move things and set up the venue. There was a princess bed, pink bed curtains, pink floor mats on the floor, and a pure white piano next to it. In the vase on the piano were a bunch of blooming eustoma flowers.\nNext to it is a fan designed by Li Xia. The fan is in the color of a rainbow, with a red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple design. It is more beautiful than the market.\nThose round fans are much more beautiful.\n\n“Where’s the electric heater? Is it next to the piano?”\n“Um.”\nThe electric heater is only fancy in color. It used to be white or black, but now it is colorful. This room is a princess room, mainly pink and white. The electric heater is also pink.\n“Director, what do you think?”\n“Beautiful. This room inspires so many young girls.” The director looked at it carefully with a professional eye and made some minor adjustments to the furniture.\n“See you tomorrow afternoon at four o’clock. I’ve already made an appointment with the guys, and they’ll be waiting for you then.”\n“Okay, I promise to be there at four.”\n“Let the children sleep well at night and face the filming in their best mental state.”\n“Okay.”\nIn the evening, Li Xia gave the script to the three children, who quickly memorized the short lines. One by one, they looked up and asked, “Mom, is this job of making egg tarts in the microwave mine?”\n“It’s your brother’s.”\nYiyi glanced at his brother and said, “Okay.”\n“Eat well and sleep well at night. Don’t feel burdened. This is our own commercial, so whatever is produced is fine.”\n“Mom, I want to eat cake.” He made his requests one by one.\n“Okay, I will buy it.”\nEating cake as an early celebration, the next afternoon after school, Li Xia drove the children to the photo studio. After changing clothes and putting on makeup, the lighting and photography were ready, and the studio was as bright as day.\nSitting in front of the piano in a dress, she played the gentle song “Water Lilies.”” Her slender fingers danced on the black-and-white keys. A rainbow-colored fan blew her long hair slowly, creating a dreamy and cool feeling.\n“Cut,” the director called for a stop. Huihua stopped and took a deep breath. She was so nervous. Even though her mother repeatedly told her not to be nervous, how could she not be nervous?\n“Very good; take the next shot.”\nThere are several shots of family scenes, with fans, microwave ovens, and rice cookers highlighting the household appliances. Finally, the three children say the slogan together.\n“Rainbow Electric Appliances is by your side, accompanying you every day of your life.”\nThe plan was to edit a commercial of no more than 30 seconds, starting at 4 p.m. on Saturday and continuing until the early morning. The next day, they shot again and finally finished it in the early hours of the night.\n“Give me three days in post-production. I’ll contact you to pick up the tape after three days. If you find anything inappropriate, you can make minor changes.”\n“Okay, good.”\nThe three kids in the car were all tired and fell asleep. Shen Haiyang said to his wife while driving, “You go to sleep too. I’ll wake you up when we get there.”\n“Well,” Li Xia leaned back in her chair, “I have to go get all the stuff back tomorrow.”\n“Just leave it to the Han Jun.”\nThe commercial was shot, and the next step was to air it. There was no space left in TV’s prime-time slot, and daytime spots would have to wait until next month. She didn’t sign it at the time.\nThe provincial TV station now shares a channel with the neighboring province, and she plans to buy the prime-time advertising time of both stations at the same time. She will broadcast it on the two provincial TV stations first, and all Chinese families with closed-circuit televisions will be able to see it. Her main attraction this time is beautiful and exquisite, and the main consumers are in the city. She doesn’t need to spend a lot of money to broadcast it on CTV, which has better reception.\nThey went home to sleep, and the next day the children went to school. They took time to finish their homework in the studio, so they didn’t miss any time. They did whatever they needed to do the next morning, and a few days later, Li Xia got the sample film.\nWow, it’s really good. Her daughter and sons all look so good on camera. She excitedly took it to the office to play it on the projector, and when Xiao Liu came in, she showed it off to everyone.\n“Well, my children are all great.”\nThe boss’s child—that’s good, not to mention that this is really very good. Huihua is graceful, gentle, and generous. Shen Hui wears glasses and is intellectual and handsome, and Yiyi is naughty and cute.\n“Great! This is so much better than those videos taken by celebrities. Those electronic commercials don’t have anyone in them; they just introduce the product. This is great; it leads the youth.”\n“No. No.” Li Xia suddenly felt something was wrong. “Teenagers are not our consumer group. Does this advertisement only appeal to teenagers?”\n“Nowadays, every family has one, and the children at home are all little princes and princesses. As long as the children like it, why worry that the parents will not pay for it?”\n“That’s the right idea.”\nSatisfied with the advertisement, Li Xia and Han Jun took the tape to the TV station’s advertising department. The prices were clearly marked, including the time period, duration of the advertisement, and time of release. After comparing each item, they signed the contract.\n“Comrade, can you bargain?” Han Jun was shameless enough. He knew that the other party probably wouldn’t bargain, but he still asked.\n“No bargaining. Comrade, you are really ridiculous. This is not buying vegetables or clothes; why are you bargaining?”\nLi Xia smiled. She had become thick-skinned now and was not embarrassed at all.\n“”Are all the procedures handled here?”\n“Yes. Now we share the same channel, and the ads on both channels are linked. You can do it in one place.”\nThis was quite convenient. Li Xia signed a six-month advertising contract immediately. She paid three months’ advertising fees and would pay the remaining three months’ fees two months later. If she cancelled it, she would have to pay a penalty.\nComing out of the TV station, Han Jun took a deep breath. “I still prefer to take orders and watch those people pay deposits.”\nLi Xia took out the car keys from her pocket and said, “How can you gain anything without investment? Researching and developing new products and advertising are essential. No, you are willing to spend money on buying motorcycles, so why are you so stingy when the factory invests?”\n“That’s different. I buy things for enjoyment, but this investment…” He got stuck and smiled, “It’s for better sales. The more people buy our products, the more money we can make.”\n“That’s the right idea.” Li Xia smiled and asked, “By the way, did Qin Mu get the money back?”\n“Not yet. I’ve already told my police buddies; they’re keeping an eye on that group of people.”\n“That’s good.”\n“I ran into that guy yesterday. Do you know who the leader of this group is?”\n“Didn’t you say it was a foreigner?”\n“There are indeed two guys with high noses, but my buddy said this incident involves a woman who was recently released from prison. And those two foreigners actually spoke in a dialect; they are not foreigners at all.”\n“She was released from prison not long ago. I know her?”\n“Zhang Qiuhua. He asked me if I was familiar with this woman, and I told him everything I knew. But this time, Zhang Qiuhua ran away, and there is no trace of her now.”\nJust after she told Han Jun about this, Li Xuedong came again the next day at noon. “Aunt, Xue Qin was arrested by the police. They said they were suspected of illegal fundraising.”\n“Did you invest any money?”\n“I did. But now that they have caught the two leaders, maybe we can get the money back.” He said this in a very depressed tone and apologized to Li Xia: “I’m sorry.”\n“You don’t need to apologize to me. Once the money is recovered, find a good partner and live a peaceful life. Don’t let your parents worry about you.”\n“Okay, I get it.”\nLi Xuedong apologized to his aunt and turned away. Shen Haiyang met him at the door and came in to ask, and Li Xia told him about it.\n“Xuedong is young and inevitably has no defenses against young girls. Don’t worry about it; the worst that can happen is that he cheated. In this kind of situation, getting cheated out of some money is not necessarily a bad thing. If you don’t get cheated badly, you may get cheated even more next time.”\nThe three kids came back from school for lunch at noon, and they came in one by one to answer the call. “A blessing in disguise. Mom, don’t worry too much; let your cousin wrestle by himself. He won’t learn his lesson unless he gets hurt.”\n“No matter what, they’ve already caught the guy. He didn’t have time to transfer the funds, so they should be able to recover them.” Li Xia waved her hand: “Let’s go; let’s go eat.”\nThe whole family was here today, so the aunt quickly went to make two more dishes: blanched choy sum and stewed three fresh vegetables. The dishes were quickly served, and everyone looked up and asked the aunt.\n      (blanched choy sum)\n“Is there no meat at home?”\nThe aunt pointed at the table and said, “Stir-fried meat with tofu and stir-fried meat with garlic sprouts—aren’t these all meat? There are pork ribs in the winter melon and pork ribs soup. Aren’t they also meat??”\n            (stir-fried meat with tofu)\n         (stir-fried meat with garlic sprouts)\n“No, that little bit of meat is not enough. It’s better to stew a pot of chestnut chicken, or stew a big goose in an iron pot, or a pot of mutton will do.”\n“Ha ha,”\nHuihua and Shen Hui were laughing, and Auntie was also amused by him. Who was this kid in his previous life? Why did he like these high-fat and high-sugar foods so much?\n“Who said you wanted to lose weight?”\n“I only eat a bowl of noodles at school at night, and I don’t eat midnight snacks. If I don’t have some meat dishes for lunch, Yiyi put down his chopsticks and leaned back in his chair. “I feel like life is meaningless.”\nLi Xia used her eyes to signal the aunt to eat without paying attention to him, and she picked up some cauliflower with chopsticks. The cauliflower was blanched in boiling water to remove the astringency of the vegetable, then seasoned with onions and garlic and drizzled with hot oil. It was very crispy when chewed.\n“Eat quickly; this choy sum is delicious, better than meat.”\nYiyi rolled his eyes. “Mom, do you think I’m a three-year-old child?”\nEven so, he still picked up his chopsticks and ate. There were only a few pieces of shredded meat and slices in the two meat dishes, and he couldn’t eat it all by himself. He had to use a spoon to scoop up the soup and eat a piece of the ribs in the soup.\nThe ribs were stewed until they were boneless and soft, and one bite was not enough to satisfy him. “Mom, let’s make braised meat on the weekend, as well as donkey meat and pork head meat. Grandpa likes it.”\nThe old man, who was eating the senior meal at the side, looked at his grandson and smiled silently. It seemed that the child was really greedy. However, they kept silent about Li Xia’s discipline. Being fat when young was cute, but how the fat child looked when he grew up was secondary. They were afraid that it would affect the child’s health.\n“It depends on your weight. If you haven’t gained any weight, I’ll make it for you. If you have gained weight, you can continue to be a vegetarian.”\n“ah,”\nYiyi called out softly, pouting his lips and looking like he had lost all hope in life. He turned to look at his father, who shrugged helplessly. He stayed there for a while, waiting for the table to be cleared. When he was fully revived, he chased his mother to negotiate terms.\n“Mom, if I get first place in the final exam, how about we go out for a nice meal?”\n“no.”\n“Why?”\n“Because no matter how well you study, you can’t eat until you’re fat. First, you won’t be as good-looking as your brother and sister. Second, it will affect your health. Third, I’m afraid you won’t be able to find a wife with your body shape. So, no matter how many points you get in the exam, it depends on the ratio of your weight to your height. As long as it’s about the same or a little more, mom won’t force it and will definitely take you to eat delicious food.”\n“Okay. During recess, I’ll go to the playground to run and play basketball. I don’t believe I can’t control it.”\nYiyi stood up and walked out. Shen Hui put his arm on his shoulders. He leaned close to his ear and whispered something, which made Yiyi blush and glare at his brother. Shen Hui stood up and ran, and Yiyi ran after him.\n“Don’t run.”\nHuihua was wiping her hands with a smile and telling her mother about what happened at school. “Mom, I’m telling you, I heard that a female classmate stuffed a love letter into my brother’s pocket.”\n“Is this true? Your brother wouldn’t fall in love too early, would he?”\n“Probably not. But a girl in our class said she liked Yiyi when she was in her first year of high school, and she asked me to send a love letter to Yiyi, but I refused.”\nLi Xia smiled and walked out with her daughter. “What about you? Has anyone written you a love letter?”\n“Of course not, no.”\nThe girl blushed, wondering if this was a confession. Li Xia smiled and didn’t ask any more questions. She should give the child some freedom. “Study first; don’t forget your goal.”\n“I know. My teacher said that with my grades plus the extra points for art, I should have no problem getting into an art school.”\n“Yeah.” Li Xia looked at her daughter’s youthful face with a look of satisfaction and reached out to touch her smooth hair. “The New Year is coming soon; do you want anything?”\n“Mom, can I buy a pair of small leather shoes?”\n“You cab.”\n“Mom, you are so nice. Our classmate’s mother doesn’t allow her to buy these things, saying that they will affect her studies.”\n“You are at an age when you love beauty. As long as you know what you should do, it is necessary to properly satisfy your pursuit of beauty.”\n“I like my mother the most.”\n“Let’s go shopping with mom on the weekend.”\n“Take the three of us clothes shopping.”\n“No, it’s just the two of us.” Li Xia leaned in and whispered to her daughter, “It’s time to change your underwear.”\nHuihua smiled shyly and nodded. Her mother paid close attention to her development in all aspects. She had talked to her about menstrual periods when she was twelve or thirteen years old. After entering puberty, she often changed her underwear to the appropriate size.\n————\n“Mom, our classmates saw the commercial I shot.” The next day, Huihua ran excitedly to the main room after school, and Li Xia poked her head out of her west room. “Here I am.”\nOh, the girl turned around and went back to her room. She took the water her mother poured for her and gulped down several gulps. “Mom, several of my classmates have seen the commercial I shot.”\n“Then what?”\n“And they envied me. Oh, by the way, there’s also Brother Hui, who is even more famous this time. During the afternoon break, he played basketball with Yiyi, and there were a lot of people watching on the playground. The girls even bought water for my brother Hui, but unfortunately, he didn’t want it. Oh, you didn’t see it; all the girls’ hearts were broken at that moment.”\n“What about you and Yiyi?”\n“I’m still the same. But Yiyi and my brother Hui are very popular. They already had good grades and attracted a lot of attention, and now this ad has made them even more popular. Especially brother Hui; he was already handsome and had good grades, and now that he’s on TV, he’s even more popular.”\n“Will it affect his studies?”\n“No. Mom, you don’t know that my brother looks very gentle at home, but he is actually very cold at school. Those girls are just crazy about him behind his back, but they will only get rejected in front of my brother. If they get rejected like this, they won’t dare approach him again.”\n“What are you saying about me again?”\nShen Hui also came back, lifted the curtain, and stood at the door. Huihua stuck out her tongue playfully, and Li Xia motioned for the child to come in.\n“Keep calm and don’t be affected. This is also a test for you. The ad is scheduled to be broadcast for half a year. Once it is stopped, its popularity will naturally fade. However, judging from the current feedback, this ad is very popular among people your age. I wonder if people your age can influence things like buying electrical appliances at home.”\n“It should have some impact. When buying fans for their rooms, several of my classmates have said they want to buy the rainbow one we have. I said we also have rabbit and orange ones, and everyone wants to see them.”\n“Don’t they know that this is our family’s company?”\nYiyi came in and shook his head with his brothers and sisters. “They don’t know. We just said we were invited to shoot an advertisement. We know to keep a low profile when we should. Don’t worry that it won’t affect our studies. We are just shooting an advertisement. Our classmates will only be excited for a few days.”\nThe mother and her two children briefly discussed the advertisement at home, and the next day Han Jun went to her office to ask for permission. “I’m going to the south to try to get more orders before the New Year. Let’s prepare first; the peak season will come soon.”\n“Okay, be careful on the road. Be generous when you treat them to a meal; the factory will reimburse you.”\n“Okay, I know.”\nHan Jun was on a business trip, and when she got home that night, Shen Haiyang just put down the phone and told her the good news with a smile. “We provided clues, and you keenly discovered and helped the police recover the national treasure in time, and you also arrested the suspect yourself. The public security agency recommended you for merit and will issue you a medal to commend you. A new interview program on the provincial TV station wants to interview you.”\nInterview on provincial TV? This is a good opportunity for advertising, and it is the icing on the cake for product promotion. The boss is such a good person, so how can the product be bad?\n\n\nTranslator’s Note:- This novel will be completed in few days!! Thank you for sticking till now.<3<3\n \n",

If the order volume was large, the funds might be insufficient, but it didn’t matter. The funds would slowly come back as the products were produced. If the situation was really urgent, they could talk to the supplier to delay the payment and pay the interest. Anyway, as long as there were orders, nothing else would matter.\n“Director, Mr. Tian Mu wants to see you. The lady who is with him is Murong Danling, and she said you two have known each other for many years.”\nTian Mu had always wanted to control her factory, so why did Murong Danling go with him? Now that they were in a confrontation, it would be good to meet and get a feel for what was going on.\n“Please go to the conference room. I’ll be there right away.”\n“OK.”\nKnowing yourself and your enemy will ensure victory in every battle. Since she is here again, let’s go and test her bottom line. She called Fang Long to go with her. When it comes to technical matters, Fang Long has to make the judgment.\nShe looked in the mirror and tidied herself up. Her professional suit was well-fitting, and she put on light makeup. Fang Long came in and met her first, and then they went to the meeting room.\nAs soon as she entered the door, Li Xia saw her old friend, Murong Danling.\nThey had rarely met in recent years, and Li Xia didn’t know what she was doing. At this moment, she was wearing international brand clothing, and the diamond necklace on her neck and the diamond ring on her hand seemed to be a set. The diamond was cut very well, and it sparkled in the sun.\nMurong Danling saw her standing up and stretched out her hand to her. “Old acquaintance, we meet again. Hello.”\nLi Xia also extended her hand to greet her politely. After so many years, the two of them have been in the business world and are no longer the young and naive girls they were back then. They have a lot of things to say in their hearts, but they don’t show it on their faces.\n“Hello.”\n“Oh, let me introduce him to you.” Murong Danling pointed at the man standing next to her and said, “This is Mr. Tian Mu, the general manager of Rifei. You should know, Rifei. There is no need for me to say more. It is a leading electronics company.”\n“Hello.” The man bowed. Li Xia had seen that gesture many times in movies, and it was quite familiar.\n“Hello.”\nAfter some pleasantries, the two parties sat down to discuss business. There was nothing new about it. They wanted to control her factories again. The other party provided her with technology and technical support, and she just sat there and collected dividends.\n“I’m sorry, Mr. Tian. I don’t have any plans to do that at the moment.”\nTake over her factory and then bankrupt it. All obstacles that hinder your monopoly on the market can be destroyed by you. You can cover the sky with one hand and play with such a large market at your fingertips, right?\n“Ms. Li Xia, I advise you not to be stubborn. You need to be flexible when doing business. In today’s turbulent times, a small factory like yours is like a small boat in the waves. It is easy to be overturned.”\n“I know what I am doing. Thank you, Mr. Tian Mu, for reminding me.”\nThis is to send the guests away. Tian Mu’s eyes showed displeasure. This woman is too difficult to deal with. He has invested in many factories and successfully entered the Chinese market, but this woman has set up a research and development department early and developed products by herself. She has broken through many technical barriers and can manufacture many small household appliances without their technical support.\nThey wanted to suppress her with price, but she actually designed such a beautiful product. In this way, they broke through their price war. In recent years, the living standards of Chinese people have been rising steadily. Many families would think of spending an extra one or two yuan to buy a beautiful one.\n“Ms. Li, I advise you not to act on impulse.”\nMurong Danling also smiled and advised, “Yes, don’t be stubborn in the business world. It’s obviously a good thing for everyone to make money; why do you have to refuse it? You are so tired of running a factory every day; isn’t it better to sit and count money?”\n“I’m sorry, I was born to be a hard worker.”\nAfter being rejected again, these two were not the kind of people who would pester others for a small business. They politely said goodbye and left, but they were actually very angry. Fang Long, a technical geek, could see their unhappy look.\n“Boss, are they doing anything behind our backs?” He is good at technology but not good at interpersonal relationships.\n“Don’t worry. We’re just dealing with each other’s moves.”\nA few days later, Han Jun called and said he had received two big orders. The man on the phone was very excited, as if he was going to do something big this time.\n“We have to earn back the advertising fee eight or ten times; otherwise, we will feel like we are losing money.”\nHan Jun had recovered most of the money from the dealers and received many more orders. She began to think about how much money would be needed to run the production line at full capacity. She went to the finance office next door, and Xiao Liu gave her some advice after listening.\n“Sister, we can talk to the suppliers and get them back on track in two or three months. If that doesn’t work, we can give them some interest and just treat it as their bank deposit. What do you think?”\n“You can try.”\nShe contacted several suppliers by phone, and many of them agreed to this approach. This is equivalent to a short-term investment in Li Xia’s products, and they can earn interest from the profits of her factory. There is nothing wrong with this if the funds are not tight.\nAfter solving the funding problem, when she ran into her son as soon as she got home that night, she asked curiously, “Didn’t you go to evening self-study tonight?”\nYiyi shook his head and said, “Mom, today is Saturday.”\nAs she walked, she said, “I’ve been so busy. How are you guys doing lately? Do you have anything you want to tell mom?”\n“Nothing happened, Mom; you can continue to take care of your big things. We can handle our small matters ourselves.”\n“Heh, is everything okay?”\n“Olay.”\nThe brat said it was okay, and Li Xia smiled and went to take a shower. She came out and knocked on her daughter’s door, and her daughter came over with a smile and took her arm.\n“Mom, have you been very busy recently? You were drunk when we came back the day before yesterday, and my dad coaxed you for a long time before you went to sleep.”\nLi Xia blushed and felt very embarrassed in front of her daughter. “I didn’t say anything stupid, did I?”\n“No. Dad said you’ve worked hard for the factory, so he asked me to make some honey water for you.” Huihua smiled. Her mother made her bed while she sat on a chair beside her. “Mom, sometimes I envy you so much. You’ve been married to my dad for such a long time, and you have such a good relationship.”\n“You, do you have a crush?” Seeing her daughter blushing and waving her hands, she comforted her, “It’s okay. It’s normal for you to have a crush at your age due to the effects of hormones. As long as you behave properly, there’s nothing wrong with it.”\n“Mom, don’t you think premature love is a disaster? Our teachers are crazy about preventing premature love. They don’t allow boys and girls to sit at the same table during meals.”\n“The teacher is doing this for your own good. After all, you are at a critical stage in your life. The best time will never come back. If you miss it, you will never have another opportunity to study like this again.”\n“I know.”\n“Shall we go shopping tomorrow morning?”\n“Okay. After we buy the clothes, shall we go to the movies?”\n“Are there any movies you like recently?”\n“Yeah. Leslie Cheung is in Across the World.”\n“Okay, after we finish shopping, let’s have something delicious and then go to the movies.”\nOn the weekend, the mother and daughter got up early. After washing and changing clothes, Li Xia sat in front of the dressing mirror and put on some light makeup. In recent years, she has paid much attention to her image in public and is very good at using cosmetics.\n“What are you doing?” Shen Haiyang came in and asked.\n“I’m going to the mall with Huihua to buy clothes.”\n“Not taking the three of us?”\nLi Xia turned around and asked, “You want to go too?”\n“Um.”\n“Then let’s go together. But we have a deal. I’m going to buy some girly things for Huihua, and you can take those two aside then.”\n“Is that so? Then you two should go alone, and don’t let those two brats follow you.”\n“Then let’s go after dinner.” Li Xia turned around and grabbed the corner of his clothes. “What do you want? I’ll buy it for you when I come back.”\nShen Haiyang looked down at himself and said, “It seems that I don’t need anything.”\n“Let’s buy a pair of shoes. It’s getting cold. See if there are any cotton-padded shoes to keep you warm.”\n“Don’t. It’s too warm, and your feet will sweat and stink.”\n“If it stinks, just wash it. It’s better than freezing, right?”\n“Really. I also drive to work this year. Both my home and my workplace have heaters, so it’s not cold at all.”\n“Okay, buy some shoes then.”\nThe mother and daughter went shopping. In addition to buying some teenage girl supplies for Huihua, they also bought some clothes for the family. The New Year is coming soon, so if you have time, you can prepare a little.\nAfter buying some food and eating some delicious food, the mother and daughter went into the cinema with popcorn. After coming out, they chatted with each other. “Mom, Leslie Cheung is a great actor.”\n“Are you star-chasing?”\n“Not really; I just really like his acting skills, and he looks good too. Sometimes he looks sunny and handsome, and sometimes his eyes look sad. His acting is really good.”\n“I still think Chow Yun is better looking.”\n“Haha, don’t let my dad hear this.”\n“It’s okay to hear it. Your dad also likes Chow Yun.”\n“That’s different.”\nThe mother and daughter smiled at each other and stopped talking about it. Huihua suddenly stopped, and Li Xia asked curiously, “What’s wrong?”\nShe whispered, “Mom, what should I do? I think I’m having my period.”\nAs a woman, Li Xia naturally knew what this meant, so she quickly looked around. “Let’s go back to the cinema. There’s a bathroom there.”\n“But I don’t have any sanitary napkins in my bag.”\n“I brought it.”\nShe accompanied my daughter to the cinema to use sanitary napkins to deal with a menstrual problem. When they came out, the cold drink in Huihua’s hand was taken away by Li Xia.\n“Don’t forget that you had a stomachache before. You can’t drink cold drinks during your period.”\n“Okay, I know.”\nThe mother and daughter had just walked in and put down their bags when the phone rang. Li Xia reached out to answer the phone. It was Han Jun. The man sounded excited, and his mouth was wet. He must have drunk a lot.\n“Boss, do you know how big an order I got? With this order, we don’t have to worry anymore. There are a few smaller ones, and we will make a lot of money if we add them up.”\nLi Xia listened to the drunkard’s mumbling with a good temper and then comforted him to go to sleep. “Take a shower and go to bed, so that you don’t smell of alcohol. If you have anything to say, wait until you sober up; there’s no rush.”\n“No, you doubt me? I’m telling you, boss, I definitely made a great contribution to the factory this time. As for the year-end bonus, you have to give me a big red envelope.”\n“Okay, okay, you have done a great job; I will give you a red envelope.”\nAfter saying that, Li Xia hung up the phone. Shen Haiyang came in and looked at her curiously. Who was she calling? She spoke in a tone like she was coaxing a child.\n“Han Jun, he’s drunk. I don’t know if what he said is true or just drunken talk. I’m hanging up on him. I’ll call him again tomorrow.”\n“Han Jun, this guy has a high alcohol tolerance now.”\n“It is said that he has a man under his command who can drink three or four times as much as the average person. I don’t know where he found him.”\n“What kind of trend is this now? When they get to the table, they just drink to death.”\n“Isn’t this the case in your unit?”\n“We don’t have that problem. This phenomenon mainly exists between factories and customers.”\n“I can’t help it. I need help from others.”\nGet orders; only with orders can a factory survive. The next day, Han Jun woke up and called her into the office. This guy really has a lot of orders this time, and Li Xia was very happy after hearing that.\n“Then I will start organizing production now. We need to get another batch of parts.”\n“Just go for it. Many people are interested in our cute design, especially underage children and female consumers. One customer said that his daughter has been asking him to buy her the rabbit fan. Also, he wants to change the order for ordinary table fans that Lao Xu placed before to this new model.”\nThe advertisement was very successful, and her use of her beauty seemed to have worked well. The factory was ready, and everything was in place except for the money. Now that the money had come, there was nothing more to say. Production had already begun, and now it had to be stepped up.\nWith the business coming in, the management of the factory is all very happy. Bonuses are directly linked to performance, so if the factory makes money, they make money, so this year looks like another good year.\nXiao Liu accompanied Li Xia to the workshop for a walk, and the two walked and talked as they came out. “Boss, how about we go to Sanya for the New Year this year? I heard that Sanya is great, warm, and you can see the sea. Let’s take the kids to the beach to play with sand and see what the sea looks like.”\n“I took my children there the autumn before last.” Li Xia smiled. “Besides, my three children are all grown up and have long passed the age of playing with sand. My father-in-law is in very poor health this year. I won’t go out; I’ll just spend the New Year at home.”\n“Then I’ll look for Xiao Xu from the R&D department to see if the couple will go.”\nOne should go out and play whenever they have the chance. Life is good only when you have money and leisure time. Otherwise, it would be too tiring to just work like an old ox pulling a cart every day. You need to take a proper rest.\nThe products are being produced in an orderly manner, and the orders have been received. These can be converted into cash soon. The electric heaters are also selling very well in winter, and the factory will definitely have generous bonuses at the end of the year.\nHan Jun was away on a business trip for more than a month, and when he came back, his face was full of a rosy glow. In the cold weather, a lot of goods had been taken away, and cash flow began to return. In the middle of the month, the salary was paid, and Lao Han was so happy that his mouth was almost grinning when he received the bonus. Calm down and talk to her about business.\n“There is an international trade fair in Shanghai on the 12th. Should I go alone this time, or will you come with me?” Han Jun is now in charge of sales and is very concerned about these things.\n“I am coming too.”\nHan Jun was so extravagant after receiving the money that he came with Li Xia to have dinner at her house. After finishing the business, he started to talk about gossip, looking at his wife and then at Li Xia.\n“Why don’t you two wear jewelry? I see other women wearing gold earrings and gold rings. Come on, wife, tomorrow I’ll buy you a gold necklace, gold earrings, and gold bracelets, so you can look great.”\nQin Mu glanced at him and said, “Come on, you are just showing off your money. Give it all to me; don’t waste it outside.”\n“You woman, you are not happy when I buy you jewelry.”\nQin Mu glanced at him and said, “Buy jewelry? What kind of jewelry? Save the money for your son to get married in the future.”\n“You, a woman, don’t understand life. Look at Li Xia. She wouldn’t always talk about finding a wife for her son. Children and grandchildren will have their own blessings. Why bother about so much?”\n“Shen Hui and Yiyi are top students. With their abilities, why should Li Xia worry about finding a wife? Don’t you look at your son? How can I be assured of him being like that?”\n“Okay, okay, don’t think too much.” Li Xia laughed, “My son Yiyi successfully lost weight this year; otherwise, I would also be worried about him getting married.”\nAs soon as this was mentioned, the topic immediately changed. Qin Mu was very fond of Yiyi : “This kid has grown a lot taller this year. How did he lose weight? Now he looks slender and full of youthful energy.”\n“He hasn’t grown much; he just got thinner, which makes him look taller. When buying clothes, I still bought the same size as last year, just to make the width and height even.”\nAfter a few small talks, Han Jun drove his wife home, and the next day he and Li Xia went on a business trip to Shanghai. This time there were five or six people with them, and most of them were new products from the factory, the kind that were advertised.\nTheir location in the exhibition hall was not very good, but the bright colors attracted the attention of everyone who passed by. Everyone who came by would take a look at the table fans of various colors and shapes, and some people began to contact them.\n \nA lady started speaking in English, and Li Xia managed to keep in touch with her. Seeing that she was not fluent in English, the other party slowed down her speech. This time, the communication was fine with both speaking and gestures.\nThe other party is a home appliance distributor in Southeast Asia. Fans sell well in the hot climate of Southeast Asia. Many countries in Southeast Asia have developed economies, and the requirements for products are not limited to performance. She thinks this design is unique and will definitely stand out from the crowd of ordinary fans.\nOn the first day, Han Jun received an export order. He looked at the boss in disbelief. The product was more expensive than the ordinary one, but it was just different in appearance. It was not only sold in China but also abroad.\n“Boss, does anyone really look at appearance when buying things?”\nThe two assistants were packing up the stall while Li Xia collected the orders. “It’s not enough to just have a good appearance. The first thing a product should consider is performance, followed by price. If the performance is good and the price is not much different, then the appearance will naturally add points.”\n“Awesome. Several domestic distributors also said that you have a unique way of thinking. When others are still thinking about the price war, you have already found another way. By focusing on their appearance, you can break their price war in one go. You don’t have to worry about being killed by their price.”\n“Let’s go back to the hotel and continue tomorrow.”\n“Boss, what if they copy ours?”\n“It takes time to imitate. We made a lot of money in one year. We can use this year to improve the performance of the microwave oven, for example, by adding more firepower, and other products are also being improved. We continue to improve our products in terms of convenience, energy savings, and aesthetics. We maintain our market competitiveness. If they imitate us, they can only follow us. ”\nHan Jun gave Li Xia a thumbs up this time, and Li Xia smiled without saying anything. We are all standing on the shoulders of giants, and we don’t deserve your praise.\nThe next day, the trade fair continued. Han Jun was watching over Li Xia’s booth as she walked around with her bag on her back. It was the 1990s, and the days of material scarcity had long passed. There were both traditional and new things at the trade fair.\nShe walked around and bought some things for her family. After the first order, people started placing orders at the stall, including from domestic customers and two Taiwanese companies.\nLi Xia smiled when she received the order. You know, in the 1990s, Japanese companies dominated the electrical appliance industry. She was able to open up overseas sales channels under the pressure of Japanese companies, so it would be even more difficult for them to squeeze her to death.\nHan Jun smiled and said, “If Tian Mu knew about this, he would be furious. He wanted to squeeze us with price, but our price went up instead of down, and we still got a lot of orders.”\n“Don’t be so cocky. Tell the factory to speed up production and ensure quality and quantity.”\n“Okay.”\nAt the World Expo, the exquisite new products successfully opened up the foreign market. Previously, the domestic orders for such new products were not large, but the orders from foreign countries were not small.\nTian Mu, who was also attending the Expo, also heard the news. He was so angry that he smashed a teacup in the house, then clenched his fists with gritted teeth.\n————\nLi Xia returned with a full load, and the factory resumed operation. Soon it was the twelfth lunar month, the first batch of orders was delivered and passed customs, and the other party also paid the balance after inspection. The factory was busy calculating everyone’s year-end bonuses.\nYiyi also met his mother’s requirements one by one and asked her for a reward. He bought a hairpin for his sister and a model for his brother. Although he didn’t keep the money, he was in a good mood because the girl he helped came to thank him.\nHis mother no longer restricted his diet. She asked his aunt to cook him braised fish, beef brisket stewed with potatoes, donkey meat with sauce, and braised pork every day. He kept exercising and went out to play basketball when the weather was good. His father said that playing basketball not only helped him lose weight but also helped him grow taller. His head was too low among his classmates, so he had to grow up quickly.\n\n \n",
    "92": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c55-2/\n“Daughter-in-law, Father was right about you. You have the foresight and the ability to fight your way out of the Japanese siege.”\nIn the 1980s, you could make money by doing OEM. In the 1990s, electrical appliances became the world of Japanese capital, and small factories lost their competitiveness. Not to mention China, a country that had just opened up; even the European and American markets were occupied by them. Either they were swallowed up by them, or they were controlled and killed. In short, they only kept their own, and they wanted to control the market.\nLi Xia took the tea from the old man with a smile and said respectfully, “Dad, you are really too kind. I am just a blind cat that met a dead mouse.”\n“Don’t underestimate yourself.” The old man pays close attention to current affairs and knows that it’s not easy for her. “Fight hard when you encounter difficulties, and don’t be afraid if you fall. We are all your solid supporters.”\nLi Xia smiled at her father-in-law and raised her teacup to him. “With your words, I will do my best.”\n“Don’t be afraid.” Family and friends all said, “We all support you.”\nLi Xia smiled and drank tea. In fact, in the 1990s, as the factory became larger and larger and the number of workers increased, she was under great pressure. So many people followed her to make a living. In the 1990s, fierce competition led to the reduction or even merger and closure of many factories, and a wave of layoffs began to come.\nShe herself was facing pressure from the Japanese capital, and if she wanted to be safe, she had to sell the products. The money she earned over the years could not be spent in several lifetimes. But what about the workers? And it was not easy for her to get to where she is now, and she would move forward despite the pressure. She thought along the way and found a way out for the workers.\nThe adults were talking in the main room, and the three children were all gathered in front of the TV. Recently, a Taiwanese martial arts film was being broadcast, and the three children were all very fascinated by it.\nThe fighting scenes during this period were well-filmed, and when one episode ended, Yiyi raised his hands and reached out to Shen Hui, imitating what he saw on TV, and the two began to fight.\nThe news was interrupted in the middle of the TV series. Huihua was watching the two brothers play around, but when the two key words came out in the news, the three children all looked at the TV.\nThey ran to the main room to tell their mother the news as soon as possible.\n“A family used an electric heater to keep warm, and their home caught fire. That heater was our brand.”\nYiyi was running in the front, panting heavily while talking. Huihua and Shen Hui also looked nervous; their children were grown up and knew what this meant to their factory.\n“Mom, what should we do? It’s all on the news now.”\nThe four adults all stood up nervously, and Li Xia asked, “Are there any casualties?”\nHuihua was confused and couldn’t remember the incident. Yiyi replied, “A grandmother seemed to be injured and was sent to the hospital. The three of them went to my grandmother’s house and found the house on fire.”\nAs they were talking, the phone rang. It was Xiao Liu, who had also seen the news. Then it was Fang Long from the R&D department, her third brother… In short, everyone who had seen the news called, and she was so nervous that she felt like she was on fire.\n“How about we go back to the factory and hold a meeting to discuss this?” Han Jun saw that no one was talking, so he spoke tentatively. For such a big matter, everyone should brainstorm.\nLi Xia waved her hand and said, “Let’s go. We will set off to the scene immediately and try to control the situation as soon as possible.”\nAfter saying that, she turned around and smiled to comfort her father-in-law: “Don’t worry, I will take care of it.”\nThe old man waved his hand and said, “Go and do your thing.”\nThis may not have much impact on old brands or foreign companies. But their heaters are only in their second year, and their reputation has not been established. Once public opinion is overwhelmingly positive that the new product has quality problems, the entire brand may collapse.\nIf someone spreads the word that it is a quality problem, consumers will immediately think that domestic products are inferior to imported ones. The wind is not in their favor. If they want to gain a foothold in joint ventures and imports, they cannot make even the slightest mistake. Otherwise, once the factory goes bankrupt, it will be difficult to revive it.\nHan Jun nodded. “Give me the car keys; I’ll go with you.”\nShen Haiyang held his wife and said, “I have some friendship with the police chief of City Z. I’ll call him. When you get there, go find him and ask him to help investigate and calm public opinion as soon as possible.”\n“Um.”\nProduct quality issues are a big hat that no one can avoid. Especially now that they are in competition, once our competitors take advantage of it and amplify it to create public opinion, the consequences will be disastrous.\nBefore they set out, they contacted Fang Long, who was in charge of technology, to see what was going on on the spot. Then they contacted the local salesperson, as it would be more convenient to work with a local boss.\nLi Xia , Han Jun, and Fang Long rushed to City Z and found that the other party had been transferred to another hospital. The doctor said that the injury was not serious, but they insisted on transferring to another hospital after treating the wound. The specific situation is unknown.\nHan Jun guessed: “Could it be that the enemy is ahead of us?”\nLi Xia speculated: “Could it be that the enemy is playing tricks?”\n“So despicable?” Thinking about the methods used in his daily life, Han Jun nodded and agreed with Li Xia’s guess, thinking it was possible.\n“If it’s really our rivals who are targeting us, they will never let this go. Public opinion will get bigger and bigger, and the worse the impact on us, the better for them. They will force us to death and then come to acquire us. If it’s really as we think, this strategy is really vicious.”\n“Now that we can’t find the victim, what should we do? Should we go to the Public Security Bureau first and ask someone to help investigate what happened? Our electric heaters are absolutely qualified and have leakage protection. They cannot catch fire during normal use.” Fang Long is very confident in the quality of his products.\n“We need to contact the fire department and the public security bureau to find out the cause of the fire immediately. If there is no official conclusion, the other party will use this to create public opinion, and we will face unimaginable difficulties.”\n“Let’s go find someone.”\nHe looked at the time and waited for a few minutes until the salesperson arrived. Besides being anxious and angry about the matter, he also wanted to find someone to investigate the truth as soon as possible. The four of them got in the car and set off to the police station together.\n“We’ve sold this electric heater for two years. It’s always been working fine. How could it break down now? Hey, do you think they covered the heater with wet clothes or something, causing a short circuit?”\nFang Long explained: “It has leakage protection. If you really do that, it will trigger product protection and will never cause a fire.”\n“Oh, so it’s not the matter, I see.”\nAfter a moment of silence, the man suddenly said, “Could it be that the fire was caused by the aging of the wiring? That place is a bungalow, and the wiring has not been changed for many years. If you use a lot of high-power electrical appliances at once, it is easy for the wiring to age and cause a fire. Maybe it’s not a product problem at all, but now everything points to the fire being caused by the use of electric heaters.”\nNo one could come to a conclusion until the matter was thoroughly investigated. Li Xia found the director of the Public Security Bureau, who knew Shen Haiyang and readily agreed to send someone to investigate.\n“I’ll also tell the fire department. Don’t worry, just wait and see how things develop.”\nWait, who can be quiet in this situation? But what else can we do if we don’t calm down? Everything has to wait for the results of the accident investigation to come out; otherwise, it will be useless to say anything.\n“Even if the results come out, we don’t know if we can clear ourselves of the charges.” Han Jun sat down in the guesthouse, his face full of worry. Rumors spread quickly, but it’s not easy to suppress them. If this matter is really related to the opponent, they will definitely not be able to clear themselves of the charges so easily.\nAfter washing her face and changing her clothes, Li Xia put on some light makeup, giving her a fresh and neat feeling. Before she could make a move, the provincial TV station’s reporter had already come to her door.\n“The reporter came to see you.”\n“Okay, I will meet.”\nIt’s okay not to meet. If you don’t meet, the other party will definitely say that you are guilty. It will be even harder to explain. Li Xia’s factory doesn’t have a dedicated public relations department yet, so she has to deal with it herself. Besides, Han Jun and the salesperson have other things to do, so they have to find the victim as soon as possible. No matter what caused the accident, they have to find the person involved to find a solution.\n“Hello, may I ask what you think about the incident in which residents used your factory’s products, which caused a fire?”\n“Our products have all passed quality inspections. There will be no problems with normal use. Even if customers do not use it according to the instructions, it has a leakage protection function and will never cause a fire. The matter is still under investigation, and the cause of the cause of the fire  has not been determined. I hope everyone will not believe the rumors.”\n“But some people say that you are a small private workshop, and your products are all pieced together, and the quality may not be reliable at all. They are three-no products.”\n“That’s not true. It’s true that our factory is privately owned, but it’s definitely not a small workshop. Our products are independently developed and have all passed national quality inspections. They are definitely not “three-no” products.”\nThe reporter’s questions were tricky, and they kept saying that their products were not good. Li Xia suppressed her anger and explained again and again. Now was not the time to be angry, and there was no telling where these reporters could go.\n“First of all, I would like to express my sympathy and condolences to the victims. At the same time, I hope they will stop hiding and come out as soon as possible. If there is any problem, we can solve it face-to-face. The fire department is already investigating the accident scene, and the cause of the accident will soon be known.”\nAfter sending the two reporters away, Li Xia paced back and forth in the guesthouse. Her eyelids felt sleepy, but she couldn’t fall asleep. She was about to break through the siege and usher in a new life, but now it was almost the New Year, and something like this happened. If this matter is not handled properly, it will be a huge disaster.\nShe was so anxious that she didn’t eat lunch and only had one bite of dinner. When Han Jun came back, she knew from his face that work was not going well.\n“Didn’t find anyone?”\nHan Jun nodded. “We asked around the hospital, the family’s relatives, colleagues at work, close friends, and everywhere we could find them. But it was as if the family had disappeared.”\nAt this point, it is impossible to say that there is no one causing trouble. “What benefits did the other party get, and what will they do next?”\nHan Jun sat down and drank some water, his thoughts following hers. “If it is really the other party who is causing trouble, the next step should be to get the victim out after the accident is determined. If the accident is determined to be caused by other reasons, then it is time for them to come out and confuse right and wrong.”\nLi Xia also thought of this, but how to solve it?\nConsumers are not concerned about the truth, or they subconsciously feel that it is difficult to distinguish between the truth and the false. The reflection in the market is that they will not buy your products, no matter whether they are good or bad. As long as they don’t buy your products, you can’t harm them. It is so difficult to establish a brand, but to destroy a brand, it may only take an opportunity—a verbal battle.\nWhat they should do now is not argue about who is right or wrong or who is responsible, but to calm the situation down as soon as possible. However, the other party did not show up at all.\nBefore going to bed at night, Shen Haiyang called to ask about the progress of the matter.\nThere is no particularly good solution. This is not a lawsuit where you lose or win. What they are fighting now is a war of public opinion. This kind of thing needs to be suppressed quickly. It cannot be allowed to continue to ferment. Otherwise, people will feel that something has happened to this brand, and they should not buy it.\n“I’ll call Lao Xu again and ask him to find someone as soon as possible. It will be easy to deal with once we find that person. No matter what the reason is, we need to spend money to suppress the matter as soon as possible.”\nAfter a sleepless night, the accident investigation results came out the next day. The authorities gave a certificate, and after everyone left, Fang Long explained the investigation results in detail.\n“The fire started at the power strip. The inferior power strip could not bear the power of the heater and caused the fire. But… our products were tampered with, and the protection inside was removed. They probably wanted to catch fire in the electric heater, but it was the inferior power strip and wiring in the house that caught fire first.”\nAs a technical geek, Fang Long could also keenly sense that there was a mastermind behind this. However, the mastermind did not expect that the heater would be removed to protect the organization, and the plug board and the line caught fire first.\n“Where’s the heater? Can it still be used as evidence?”\nFang Long nodded. “It was discovered in time, and only the top was burned. It’s fine as evidence. We can prove that this was man-made.”\nThe firefighters had some connections with Han Jun, and Shen Haiyang knew the police chief, so the matter was resolved so quickly.\nWith the official results, Li Xia and Han Jun quickly contacted reporters and tried to get the news out tonight, while at the same time calling on the parties involved to contact her as soon as possible.\n“Out of humanitarianism, our factory is willing to do its part in the treatment of the elderly.”\nAfter a long discussion, the two decided to take the humanitarian route. It turned out that their products were not substandard, but as a manufacturer, they could only compensate out of humanitarianism; otherwise, the people at that time would think they were bullying. Because of their concepts, this was the only way to deal with it.\nWhile calling on the other party to come out on TV, the Public Security Bureau also helped to find them. Li Xia asked the dealer to find someone to help her that day. Everyone stayed in the place where the person might appear, trying to find them as soon as possible.\nThe person involved went out at this time and secretly met with the reporter of the Provincial Evening News. “We don’t understand either. I just heard my mother say that she saw the heater on fire. Everything was normal at home before. It was only this year that this happened after the old woman bought this heater because he was afraid of the cold.”\nThe evening paper and the TV news come out at about the same time. When the TV news and the newspaper come out together, this matter will be pushed to the forefront again.\nThe man said something ambiguous to the reporter as planned and tried to hide again after leaving here. However, he was caught in the alley by the police, who had been monitoring the area. Then he called Li Xia to inform her.\n“Why are you running away? Damn it, when something went wrong, you secretly said that there was a problem with the product, but you didn’t contact the product manufacturer. Tell me clearly: What are you planning? Did you secretly modify our product and try to blackmail us?”\n“No, I didn’t.”\nHan Jun exerted force on his hand, and there was a sound of “crack.” The man screamed in pain, as if his arm had been removed by Han Jun. “It hurts, it hurts, ah, it hurts.”\n“Tell me or not? If you don’t, I’ll break your arm and make you a cripple for the rest of your life.”\n“I……”\nLi Xia arrived at this time and remained silent. Han Jun had already controlled the other party and wanted to see if he could get some useful information from him.\n“explain,”\n“Ah!” the man screamed again, trembling in pain. He didn’t expect to meet such a person who would attack him without saying a word. He was so frightened that he forgot that he should deny it.\n“Let go, I’ll tell you.”\nHan Jun finally let him go. The man’s arm was hanging down, and it looked like Han Jun had taken it off. He was sweating from the pain, and he was hesitant and unhappy.\n“Tell me, what are you dawdling about?”\nHan Jun roared, and the other party shuddered. His arm was still hurting, and he finally spoke. “Someone asked me to modify the heater. I saw the house on fire and ran back. My mother’s injuries are not serious.”\n“Then what?” Li Xia asked.\n“Then we hid first so that no one could touch us. He asked me to come out today and say something to a reporter. ”\n“What did you say?”\nThe man repeated those words, and Li Xia and Han Jun were shocked immediately after hearing them. It was murderous, and he was ambiguous but still pulled the electric heater and refused to let go. Ordinary people didn’t understand so much and just thought that the fire was caused by the electric heater.\nHan Jun was so angry that he reached out to hit someone again but was stopped by Li Xia. You beat someone up and injured him, and he will be in the newspaper later. The factory’s substandard products caused a fire, and then the factory manager beat someone up. With this headline, you are not passing a message to the other party.\n“How much did they pay you?”\n“Thirty thousand.”\nThe house price here is about 600 yuan, which is cheaper here than in the provincial capital. 30,000 yuan is enough to buy a house. No wonder this family didn’t even care about the old mother’s injury and was willing to become a knife in the hands of the other party.\n“What are their demands?”\n“We just say those things in the newspapers. Then, if reporters interview us again, we pretend to be very pitiful so that everyone will sympathize with us.”\n“Do you know who the other party is?”\n“I have no idea.”\nWell, he was so elusive that no one could catch him. Even if she wanted to fight back, she had no clear target. Li Xia thought quickly and could not afford to fight back. What she had to do was suppress the matter as soon as possible. She didn’t want people to spread rumors anymore.\n“Go find the Evening News reporter right away and find a way to get this replaced.”\nShe immediately went to the reporter stationed here and explained clearly that the news had to be removed. In a few days, she would be interviewed by the provincial TV station after the commendation, because the fire incident was a good topic to talk about. When she came forward in person, it could actually increase the popularity of their products.\nThat’s how it is. Unfavorable news can become positive publicity if done well. But the unfavorable news can’t be too big; otherwise, the positive and negative sides will be in opposition, leaving consumers with a feeling of confusion.\nThe positive news must outweigh the negative news, so at this time, they must control the negative news and not let it increase. As long as they cancel this news and wait for her to appear on the show with the official accident report, the matter will be solved.\n“What I said was not true. In fact, when my mother woke up, she saw that the socket was on fire, and it had already ignited the table. The electric heater and board were burned along the burning wires and the surrounding objects.”\nUnder the threat of the police, the other party did not dare to resist. Although he did not believe Li Xia’s words about giving money, he still told the truth. He thought that this would replace the news that night, but this reporter was surprisingly bold.\n“They threatened you, right? Don’t be afraid; tell me, and I will expose them. These rich people don’t treat ordinary people as human beings. When something goes wrong, they don’t admit that there is a problem with their products, but actually threaten consumers.”\n“What nonsense are you talking about?” Li Xia shouted angrily.\n“What the hell are you talking about? Do you know the truth? Haven’t you heard that the official investigation has shown that the fire started from the socket and wires, not the heater at all?” Han Jun’s eyes widened with anger.\n“Who knows the result of how you bought it secretly?”\nHan Jun raised his hand angrily and said, “You f*cking …”\n“If you dare, try it. Unless you kill me, I will expose your evil deeds.”\nThe reporter’s forehead was covered with sweat, and his arms were shaking with nervousness. But he couldn’t back down, as he had already received money for the news. If he withdrew it, how would he survive in the future?\n“Call right now.” Seeing that time was running out, Han Jun was so anxious that he wanted to beat someone up. But he knew that if he did, the matter would become even more serious.\n“News reports should be based on the principles of truth and objectivity. As a journalist, you don’t even have the most basic professional ethics. We will sue you. You will never be able to stay in this industry again if you do this.”\n“Scare me? I was raised on fear. This is intimidation. I will definitely expose you. You are using your power to bully others. It is obvious that your products have problems, but you are still threatening consumers.”\nThis guy must be up to something, and it’s impossible to expect him to take down the news. She was afraid that calling the provincial evening newspaper would not work, and she didn’t know who the other reporter would trust.\nIf the other party does not change, even if they apologize to you in the newspaper after the report is false, it will be a mess. The loss cannot be recovered by an apology in the newspaper.\nLi Xia picked up the phone on his desk and called Shen Haiyang. She called directly to his office, hoping that he was not out today.\n“Beep, beep…” Shen Haiyang, answer it quickly. Answer it quickly.\n\n",
    "93": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c56/\nCHAPTER 56\n“Hello, I’m Shen Haiyang.”\n“Haiyang, it’s me.”\n“Wife,” Shen Haiyang recognized her voice, “if you have anything to say, please speak up.”\nLi Xia quickly explained the situation to him: “Is there any way to remove or replace this news? The newspaper will be published soon, and once it is published, there will be another layer of trouble.”\n“I’ll try to find a way.”\nShen Haiyang didn’t waste any time; he hung up the phone and went to find his colleague. This colleague’s elder brother seemed to work for the provincial newspaper, and if he hurried, he could remove the news.\nShen Haiyang asked his colleague for help in a hurry. His colleague called his brother without saying anything. His brother is now the editor-in-chief. After talking to Li Xia and confirming that the news was wrong, he became anxious.\n“It’s about to be printed; what can we use to replace it now? Xiao Xu is not reliable at all. He actually published such misleading news to consumers.”\nShen Haiyang extracted important information from these words: It’s about to be printed; what should be used to replace the message?\n“Well, replace the message with an advertisement for our factory. I’ll pay for the advertising later.”\n“What slogan should I use?” Is it too late to write this now? You really know how to give me a difficult question.\n“It’s on TV, so just use that.”\n“Oh, OK. If the page is large, I’ll include a screenshot of the poster and increase the advertising fee. And our newspaper advertisements are valid for at least one month.”\n“Okay, okay, that’s fine.”\nThe editor-in-chief made a phone call, removed the false news, and replaced it with the advertisement shot by Li Xia. The poster and the slogan were directly copied. The layout was quickly replaced, and the printing began on an expedited basis.\nThe newspaper’s news was intercepted, and Shen Haiyang called his wife to inform her. Li Xia finally breathed a sigh of relief after hearing this, and after hanging up the phone, she left with Han Jun and the person involved. The young reporters will be dealt with by their leaders, and he has no ethics as a media person, and he will not have a good result.\nThe young reporter was also very surprised when he heard that the news had really been replaced. This person actually has connections with their newspaper and was able to replace his news urgently. It’s over; this woman has a complicated relationship behind her, and he has fallen into the trap this time.\nLi Xia didn’t care what he did. She and Han Jun took the client to the hotel where they were staying. On the way, Han Jun had already reset his dislocated bones and joints, and there was no visible scar on the surface.\n“Tell me, what is your plan?”\n“I have to sue your factory and distributor for compensation. I will definitely lose the lawsuit. But I really have no choice. This was the condition I agreed to in the first place.”\nHan Jun said quickly, “Withdraw the lawsuit, and we will compensate you for your losses.”\nThe man smiled bitterly: “In fact, this lawsuit is bound to be lost, so you don’t have to spend any more money.”\nLi Xia sat in deep thought, not in a hurry to speak. Should she file a lawsuit or spend money to suppress the matter? If she suppressed it, would the other party take the risk and deliberately create an accident? If she didn’t suppress it, how much impact would it have on her factory?\nThis is a matter of opportunity and danger. The negative impact of the fire has been eliminated. The official news is that the fire started from the socket and wires, and they used them improperly and covered the electric heater with wet clothes, ignoring the four big words “Do not cover” written on the top of the electric heater.\n“I think we should just leave the lawsuit as it is.”\nLi Xia said so, and Han Jun also reacted. She will be interviewed by a TV station soon, and there will be a lot of operations at that time. As for the lawsuit, the media will no longer pay attention to it. When it is reported again, it will be a trial. If the lawsuit is won, there will be another wave of public opinion. Rainbow is indeed of high quality, and it will win the case.\n“I think so.”\n“We have responded quickly. The fire has nothing to do with our products. The authorities have released the results of the investigation. The media dare not report it recklessly. The next step is to pay attention to this after the lawsuit is decided.”\nLi Xia continued, “During this period, we have to use public opinion to build momentum for ourselves and advertise our brand. This time, the power strip caught fire. I promised on the show that I would give away a high-quality power strip for every high-power appliance I sold. You should contact the power strip manufacturer, and they must be of high quality.”\nHan Jun clapped his hands and said, “Your reaction is too quick. This will elevate our factory’s image in the minds of consumers to a higher level.”\nAfter dealing with the negative impact on me, I can go with the flow. The man in the house smiled helplessly, thinking that these two were very capable. Before, they were eager to suppress it, but when things took a turn for the better, they immediately started to build momentum for themselves. This woman is really generous, giving away a power strip for every machine. How much money would that be?\nThe tree wants to be still, but the wind does not stop. They already know that someone is playing tricks on them. They cannot deal with things too hastily, lest the other party become desperate and artificially create trouble and public opinion. Since it has come to this point, they might as well take advantage of the situation and keep things under control.\nAs the saying goes, the business world is like a battlefield, changing rapidly and testing people’s abilities.\nHan Jun turned his head and glared at him. He trembled with fear. This man was too cruel. He removed his arm without hesitation. And now it has been put back in place, and it is as good as new. Outsiders can’t see it at all, but who knows the pain he is feeling inside?\n“Don’t talk nonsense in any news media anymore; otherwise…” Han Jun raised his hand, his joints cracking. The man was so scared that he just nodded and didn’t know what to say. He added, “Be careful not to spend the money you earn without conscience. Your son seems to be less than one year old.”\n“Don’t worry, don’t worry. What I promised them was what was in the newspaper before, and then I would sue you. I promise not to say anything else.”\n“What if they arrange for the media to interview you?”\n“Everything will be judged by the public. Let everyone listen to the official news.”\n“Did your old mother put the baby’s wet clothes on the electric heater?”\n“I’m not at home, so I don’t know. But the fire brigade went to put out the fire, and they saw it, so maybe they did. After all, my mother is old, so she might be confused.”\nImproper use should guide consumers to the correct understanding. Because it is clearly written on the heater that it cannot be covered. When everyone saw this, they immediately thought of the old lady’s improper use due to illiteracy. In addition, the plug board caught fire; these two items have made people no longer doubt the product quality.\nThe quick response turned things around. The TV first reported the fire and then reported that the fire was caused by improper use, aging circuits, substandard sockets, etc. The negative things did not ferment in the minds of consumers and turned into positive ones.\nLi Xia invited all the dealers in the city to dinner, and everyone had a copy of the official report. If anyone had doubts, they could use this. The news media would not pay attention to this matter for a while, so the next step would be word of mouth from consumers. They had seen on TV that it was not a product quality issue, and after seeing the official report with their own eyes, any doubts would disappear.\n“Please spread the word. Word of mouth, although it takes a little effort, can also build up a good reputation. At the end of the year, we will give everyone a commission based on sales. We have also hired many technical personnel for after-sales service, and the service will definitely be in place.”\nA dealer smiled and said, “No problem; we have been cooperating for many years, and we trust Boss Li.”\nMany of them were customers they had accumulated since they sold black-and-white TVs. Because of their interests and friendships, everyone was willing to help. Moreover, they had more orders from Li Xia than this. If something happened to their factory, they would not be in a good situation.\nThings have come to a close here. The lawsuit will not be resolved in a short time, and they have already made arrangements, so they are not afraid of the other party doing something bad.\nBefore leaving, Han Jun found the man again. The man trembled with fear when he saw him. “What else do you have to say?”\n“Are you worried that the other party might use violence against you?”\nThe man nodded, looking regretful and afraid in front of him. He was just a small fry who did things for money, so Han Jun didn’t make things difficult for him.\n“Don’t be afraid. If you encounter threats, go to the Public Security Bureau. We have already informed you. This is a recorder. If the other party comes to find you, you can record the evidence and delay them. Then hand this to the Public Security Bureau, and someone will naturally help you.”\nThe man’s hands were shaking. How did he get involved in this vortex? He didn’t even think about it. It was so much money. Money was so easy to earn. He was being used as a knife for others. How could the other party be happy if the knife didn’t hurt anyone?\n“It’s best to get the other party’s background so that it can become public opinion. The bigger the public opinion, the safer your family will be. The other party won’t dare to admit it, let alone hurt you again.”\n“Oh, oh, I know what to do.”\nHaving been in fear for so long, he decided to fight the other party. After the official investigation results were released by Li Xia, he could no longer attack her. If he continued to make false statements regardless of the facts, it would be a rumor, and he would be held criminally liable. It would be better to take the money from them and let them suffer in silence. Anyway, he had done what he promised them.\nAfter explaining this, Li Xia and Han Jun bought gifts and went to the Public Security Bureau chief to express their gratitude. After a conversation, they found out that the other party had known Shen Haiyang for many years. During the meeting this year, the two chatted together. Their relationship was not particularly close, but they definitely had a friendship.\n“Don’t worry, I’ll tell them to pay special attention to that area.”\n“Thanks.”\nAfter everything was arranged, she, Han Jun, and Fang Long returned to the provincial capital. It was already late when they arrived, so she got off at the door and asked Han Jun to drive her car home.\n“Just come pick me up tomorrow morning.”\n“Okay, I will go then.”\nAs soon as she entered the door, Shen Haiyang in the main room and the three children in the east and west wing rooms all came out after hearing the noise. The feeling of being cared for by her family made her tired face bloom with a smile.\n“Mom, is it solved?” Yiyi was the first to ask.\n“Yeah, it’s okay.”\nThe family members all looked relieved, and the children went back to their rooms without worrying about going to school tomorrow morning. Without saying much to them, she washed up.\nShe went back to the main room and told her husband in detail about their final plan.\n“Thanks to you. If the official report had not been issued in time and you had not removed the newspaper report, this matter would have become a big deal and it would have been difficult to resolve.”\nShe was combing her hair, and when she turned around, she looked at him with a smile on her face. The man reached out and took the comb from her hand, his expression still smiling and elegant.\n“You’re welcome to talk to me.” Then he remembered something: “But we have to pay for the replacement ads. I signed for them.”\n“Yeah, don’t worry, I’ll pay.”\n“Many suppliers have been visiting me one after another these days. This matter has been widely spread. I’m afraid some of them will be influenced and ask for money in advance. The villa you bought has been delivered. If you really can’t make it, sell the house. Let’s talk about it after this period has subsided.”\n“I’ll meet these people tomorrow and see the details.” She also needs to buy a batch of sockets to give away, which will cost a lot of money. But all this needs to be done; she just needs to figure it out on her own, and she doesn’t need to tell him everything. He has already helped her a lot.\n“okay.”\nKnowing that she was tired, Shen Haiyang helped her massage to relax her muscles and bones so that she could sleep well. After a good night’s sleep, Han Jun drove Qin Mu over the next day, had breakfast at her house, and then the two drove to work.\nShen Haiyang also drove away. The nanny at home smiled and shook her head, joking with Qin Mu. “Your man is with this woman all day long. Mr. Shen doesn’t mind, and neither do you. You have a really good relationship, which shows how much trust you have.”\nQin Mu sneered: “Li Xia would not like my husband’s rough and straight appearance. Especially compared with Brother Shen, he is not a match. Well, what’s the use of dislike? Half of my life has passed. I’m used to it.”\nAuntie didn’t take her self-deprecating words seriously. Han Jun’s temper is not as good as Shen Haiyang’s, but he is definitely a capable man. Of these two men, if Shen Haiyang is the gentle jade, Han Jun is the tall tree. He is a little rough, but absolutely reliable.\nWhen Li Xia arrived at the workplace, Xiao Liu was the first to come over and ask about the situation. Just as she was about to speak, her third brother, Fang Long, and Han Jun also came in. She heard that the other party had sued them and the dealer, and she couldn’t let her mind go.\n“What if the dealer returns the product?” Xiao Liu was rather timid. He felt that the matter was not completely resolved and was always uneasy.\n“The quality of our products is absolutely up to standard, and it’s not the first day that the dealers are selling them. Moreover, the authorities have already released the results of the investigation, and those people are not that stupid.” Fang Long is very confident in the technology and thinks that you must be very shortsighted to return such a good product.\nThe third brother said nothing and just listened to everyone’s opinions. He was not very good at production and sales, and he had no idea how to deal with this matter. His sister had made the decision, so he just listened to her.\nSeeing that she had made up her mind, Xiao Liu turned to another question. “The suppliers have been to your house these past few days, and I think they’ve been to your house too. I said I’d contact them when you get back. What do you think we should do about this?”\n“Are they still in the provincial capital? If they are, let’s meet tonight. Please notify them. I will treat them at Hongyun Restaurant tonight.”\n“Okay, got it. Then let’s go tonight, Han Jun, me and you, okay?”\n“Yes, the three of us will go. If you get drunk, let my third brother pick us up.”\nAfter talking to Xiao Liu, she turned to arrange Fang Long: “Let’s do it this way for now. The production in the workshop will be adjusted according to the order. Fang Long, you asked someone to keep an eye on this matter. That’s it; adjourn the meeting, and everyone go about their business.”\n“Okay.”\nNow the technical department and R&D department of the factory have not been separated, and both are managed by Fang Long. He responded and turned away, no longer expressing his opinion on sales. After he left, Han Jun and Xiao Liu also left one after another, leaving only Li Xia and her brother in the office.\nThe third brother saw that the door was closed, waited for a minute, took out a bag from his pocket, and put it in front of Li Xia. Li Xia stretched out her hand to look at it and asked, “What is this?”\nWhen she opened the bag, she saw two neatly stacked pieces of cash. There were two bundles of 100-yuan bills, one for 10,000 yuan. Li Xia looked up in surprise and asked her third brother where the money came from. They had already bought a house, so how could they still have money?\nThe third brother smiled naively and raised his hand to touch the back of his head. “I know this money is not much, but it is all our savings. You can use it first, and if it doesn’t work out, we will return the house. Don’t be afraid; there is no fire mountain in the world that cannot be overcome. Difficulties are only temporary, and such a large industry cannot be smooth sailing.”\n“Third brother….”\nWhen she left her hometown to come to the provincial capital to find Fang Zhongcheng, he stuffed a lot of  banknotes into her bag. Now that she is having trouble doing business, he has no hesitation in giving her all the cash in his home.\n“I will find a way to deal with my problem. And those people just saw it on the news, so I will explain it to them.”\n“Okay, okay,” the third brother interrupted her. “I know the money is not much; you can use it first. If it really doesn’t work, we can return the house. If we work together, we can get through the difficulties.”\nThe third brother turned around and left. Li Xia looked at the money.\nHer heart and eyes were burning, and she couldn’t control her tears. “Idiot,”\nThe third brother knew that she owed a lot of money for goods. These people had come to the factory two or three times in the past two days. Now the factory was sued again. Some people said that if the reputation was affected, the orders might be returned. If the products could not be sold, how could she pay back the money she owed? Although the money he had was probably a drop in the bucket for her, it was better than nothing.\nThe third brother and his wife both work in the factory. In terms of public affairs, they hope that the factory will be good. In terms of private affairs, they can’t just sit back and watch their sister encounter difficulties. The family has saved for many years, and all the money except for buying a house was taken out.\nLi Xia didn’t know the situation of those suppliers, but several of them were not due to pay the final payment yet. Even if those suppliers who agreed to delay the payment changed their minds, she should be able to suppress them with this proposal.\n“Knock, knock,” someone knocks on the door.\n“Come in.”\nAfter seeing them off, Li Xia led her right-hand men to the restaurant in the evening. A group of suppliers’ managers had been waiting there for a long time. It seemed that this news had a great impact on everyone. When they saw her coming in, they all stood up.\n“Director Li, you finally showed up.” Old Liu from Zhongyuan Machinery Factory No. 1 frowned, looking like he was neither crying nor laughing. “Such a big thing happened. Are you okay now?”\n“Old Liu, how do you do business with such courage?” His old friend beside him stabbed him. “Boss Li has such a big business, but there are some minor problems. We can solve them. What’s the big deal?”\n“Oh my, Old Xu, you are so capable. You are so capable that you have to go to Director Li several times in a hurry.”\n“I’m concerned about how things are going.”\nA bunch of people know each other and are bickering with each other. Li Xia took the brewed tea from the waiter and prepared to pour it for everyone, but Xiao Liu reached out to intercept it, so she waved her hand to stop her. Today she will pour it herself to give these people enough face.\n“Everyone should have seen the news. This is what happened. The fire was caused by aging wiring and cheap sockets. It has nothing to do with the quality of our products. As for the orders, the factory is still stepping up production. As for your payment, I will pay on time. Don’t worry.”\nOld Xu said with a smile, “I told you that Director Li had dealt with it a long time ago, but you didn’t believe me. See, I was right. It was just one piece of news, and the rest was suppressed. With the official report, who dares to talk nonsense?”\nEveryone was talking about what happened this time, and most of the emotions had been calmed down. When the food and drinks were ready, Li Xia and her right-hand men began to toast everyone in turn. The drinking culture in China is fully reflected. After a hearty drink, no one mentioned money when they left.\nThe third brother acted as a driver to take care of the drunks, and he and another person from the factory took them home. Li Xia and the other two sat on the steps. They didn’t drink much today; they were mainly socializing and making contacts.\n“Squeak,” a car stopped in front of them. Han Jun looked up and reached out to push Li Xia. “Hey, your man is here to pick you up. I say, woman, move, stop pretending.”\nLi Xia looked up and saw Shen Haiyang’s face in front of her. She smiled and raised her arm to his shoulder, addressing him in a popular way: “Husband, I knew you would come.”\nHaving drunk too much again, Shen Haiyang shook his head and laughed without saying much. He picked her up and put her in the car, then stood up and asked, “What about the two of you? Why don’t you get in the car too? I’ll take you home.”\nXiao Liu waved her hand and said, “No. Brother-in-law, just take good care of my sister; we will wait for the third brother Li to come.”\nShen Haiyang didn’t bother to be polite with them and drove away with his wife. Li Xia fell asleep in the car on the way home, and he didn’t wake her up when he carried her into the house. She didn’t get drunk this time, probably because she was too tired recently and fell asleep directly after drinking.\nHe took off her clothes, put her in pajamas, and fetched water for her to wash her face and feet. When he went out to get water, he met the old man. He put down the basin and helped him. The old man was happily supported by him as he walked to the backyard. The father and son talked as they walked. He sent his father back to the room to rest and changed the water in his thermos before leaving.\nThe next day, she had dinner and went to work. The next day, she recorded a program on TV. When the host mentioned her charity work over the years, Li Xia smiled modestly. Then she naturally talked about the heater fire incident. It turned out that the fire was caused by the poor quality of the plug board.\n“Electrical appliances have developed rapidly in recent years, and high-power appliances have put great pressure on the quality of power strips. Starting next week, all purchases of Rainbow brand heaters will receive a high-quality power strip for free. This will allow everyone to buy with peace of mind and use with confidence.”\n“Director Li has been enthusiastic about public welfare for many years, helping students, the elderly, and the poor. Now, she even paid out of her own pocket to send high-quality power strips to consumers because of a fire caused by a power strip of poor quality. Let us applaud Director Li for her spirit of socialist responsibility.”\nThe host led the applause, and the applause lasted for a long time.\nAfter the lawsuit, the company’s reputation was greatly improved, and this time it reached a new level. Han Jun did not need to look for it, as several manufacturers of power strips came to him to seek cooperation. They competed only to improve their own brands, and the price was not high at all.\nBuy a Rainbow-brand heater and get a free power strip. A fire has found a breakthrough in the crisis, and dealers report that sales are rising steadily.\n“Don’t worry, Han Jun, you and Director Li; we will definitely support you this time. The TV will broadcast Director Li’s interview program. She is now a celebrity and a conscientious entrepreneur. Rainbow brand electrical appliances are of excellent quality.”\n“This opportunity to be on TV comes at the right time. It is just in time. It is more effective than word-of-mouth. Director Li is a good person, and she has been rewarded many times. She has also caught the criminals. This time, we can use this opportunity perfectly.”\n \n\n",
    "94": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c57/\nCHAPTER 57\n“This is also a considerable amount of money.” Han Jun selected two power strip manufacturers for Li Xia to choose from, and Li Xia designated one of them.\n“That’s it. Go sign the contract and assign the goods to the dealer.”\n“Okay, got it.” Han Jun calculated and said, “We owe so many suppliers money. Will it affect our application to establish a company?”\n“No. We have so many assets here; owing a few yuans is nothing.”\n“That’s right. After a while, when the dealers get their money back, we can have another great year.”\nTo keep up with the development of the times, Li Xia asked her subordinates to submit applications for land to build an office building. Others just picked a name and put some money into setting up a company, but she didn’t apply until now, when she had so many businesses. With the establishment of the company, things like the public relations department and after-sales department also have to keep up. In the future, there will be more systematic management.\nThings were going well, and in the evening, she invited people from related units to dinner because of the company’s application for land to build an office building. Needless to say, drinking was inevitable in such interpersonal social activities.\nShen Haiyang took her home and put her on the bed. He took off her clothes and poured water on her to wipe her face. Li Xia had taken a nap in the car. When Shen Haiyang wiped her face and poured water for her, she opened her eyes and woke up.\nOutside, the old man came out to look at the stars and turned back to talk to his son. “Is your wife drunk?”\nShen Haiyang nodded with a smile and said, “Yes. She has been applying for a company recently and is also building an office building. So there’s a lot to do.”\n“Xia has had a hard time these years; you have to treat her well.” Although he knew that his son and daughter-in-law had a good relationship, he wanted to say a few more words today for some reason. Seeing his son smile and agree, he continued.\n“I’m not as lucky as you. I don’t have the same treatment as you for the same disease. Your wife has shouldered the heavy burden of the factory over the years. She has been very kind to you, me, and Huihui. As a wife, she works hard outside. Please be more considerate.”\nAfter saying that, he looked at his son and suddenly laughed to himself: “Really, I was just talking nonsense.”\nWhen his daughter-in-law has a social event at night, his son will definitely go to pick her up. He always coaxes his wife when she is drunk, and he fully supports her career. Over the years, Li Xia has treated Shen Hui like her own children, and he treats the two children like his own, and the reconstituted family is integrated from the inside out.\nShen Haiyang knew that his father wanted him to be happy, and he had developed feelings for him over the years. The two had similar personalities, and they smiled well-temperedly when they looked at each other. Shen Haiyang walked his father to the bedroom.\nHe helped him to sleep and was about to leave. He turned around and saw his eyes. Although the old man was old, his eyes were still clear and full of happiness and warmth when he looked at his son.\n“How about I sleep here with you tonight?”\nThe old man smiled, his whole body showing joy. “No need.”\nComing out of the old man’s room, he closed the door behind him. Before leaving, he glanced at the east bedroom. Shen Hui and Yiyi now lived with Grandpa in the backyard. Yiyi heard the noise and came out, glancing towards the main room.\n“Is Grandpa asleep?”\n“Well, you should go to bed soon; don’t read too late.”\n“Dad, is my mom drunk again?”\n“Yes. Go to bed quickly.”\n“okay.”\nAfter chatting with his son for a few words, he also walked back to his room to sleep. Li Xia sat on the bed with her head tilted and looked up when she heard the noise. “Did you go to see Dad?”\n“Yeah, I just came back from the backyard.”\n“Why don’t you sleep with him in the backyard tonight?”\nThey are not as close as they were when they were young, but after living together for so many years, he has a good relationship with his father. The old man’s health is getting worse, so he won’t regret it if he gets closer to him.\n“Then I’ll go.”\nLi Xia nodded and waved for him to go. Shen Haiyang went to the door and then came back: “Can you do it yourself?”\nLi Xia smiled and said, “It’s okay; I didn’t drink too much. Go, go, accompany the old man. ”\nShe was with his mother in her last days, and he is in poor health now, so he should accompany his dad more. Tomorrow, she will make his favorite chestnut cake and some other snacks. The father and son will play chess and drink tea on weekends, which is their favorite thing.\nThe next day, when Qin Mu arrived, the courtyard was quiet and empty, with only the aunt cooking in the kitchen. She lifted the curtain and went in.\nPut the rooster bought from the morning market in a basin and wash it.\n“Why is there no movement today? Where is the old man? Is he out?”\nAuntie replied, “No, he is doing Tai Chi with Mr. Shen in the backyard.”\n“Oh. These two were so quiet. I didn’t hear anything at all.”\n“What are you going to do with the chicken?”\n“Chicken noodle soup.”\nAs she was talking, Li Xia also got up, washed up, and took out chestnut flour and other ingredients to make cakes. For breakfast, they had chicken noodle soup, steamed dumplings, and tofu pudding. In the morning, the father and son played chess in the room, and Li Xia brought tea, chestnut cakes, and rose cakes. The old man was immediately happy when he saw this.\n“I really like it.”\nLi Xia smiled and pointed to the drawer over there, and Shen Haiyang nodded silently. She reminded him to give the old man some digestive tablets, as eating too much of his favorite cakes would make it difficult to digest.\nShe went out, leaving the space for the father and son, just like every weekend. She went out to the west room of her daughter’s room and sat quietly watching her daughter draw.\nAt night, Li Xia continued to let her husband accompany her father-in-law. Shen Haiyang had been feeling uneasy for no reason these days, so he should accompany the old man at night. The old man used to say that he was used to being alone and would not let anyone accompany him in the house. Shen Haiyang was very happy to accompany him yesterday, and it seemed that he still liked his son.\n“Then go to bed early.”\nFor several days in a row, Shen Haiyang stayed with his father in the backyard. One day, Li Xia got up and found that the two were silent, so she went to the backyard and knocked on the door.\nTwo soft clicks, no movement inside. Then three more rhythmic clicks, this time a little heavier than before. There is still no movement inside.\n“Dong, Dong, Shen Haiyang, get up early and have breakfast.”\n“Creaky,” the door was opened from the inside. Shen Haiyang looked at her with grief on his face without saying a word. He turned around and kneeled down again towards the bed.\nThe old man passed away peacefully, as if he were sleeping. According to the old man, he was a blessed man. He was born into a wealthy family and died in prosperous China. Although he was sick all his life, he did not suffer a single bit of pain when he passed away.\nThe son, whom he had never raised  since childhood and had a rift with, now has a good relationship with him and accompanies him as if by telepathy before he leaves. His face on the bed has a smile on it and looks full of happiness.\nShen Hui and Yiyi came in and saw the adults kneeling in front of Grandpa, and they immediately kneeled down as well. Tears rolled down their eyes, and their eyes were somewhat unbelievable. Grandpa’s health had not been very good, but he had survived year after year, so how could he suddenly pass away?\nHe died in his sleep, and his body was already somewhat stiff. Li Xia quickly went to buy some old clothes and put them on him while he was still able to move.\nThe funeral was held five days later, and the body was kept at home for five days. All the people in the provincial capital knew about it. People came and went at home, and many dealers and suppliers from other places also came.\n“Boss Li, you see, it’s difficult for us too. You have a big business, but we are a small business. If you have enough money, just pay me first. I need funds urgently.”\nA former supplier wanted money as well, and he was busy with his work when he got in front of me. The old man was a shareholder in the factory, and even those who didn’t know the inside story thought he had the lion’s share. Now that the old man has passed away, it’s unknown how his estate will be distributed. It’s normal for someone to want to settle accounts if they’re afraid of any turmoil.\n“Give me some time. Let’s finish our old man’s funeral first, and then we can talk.” Seeing that the two were still looking miserable, she said helplessly, “Our old man’s inheritance will be left to our family. The factory will not be divided because of this. There will be no disputes and no troubles.”\nReally? The two rolled their eyes and didn’t insist. “Then why didn’t I see the lawyer?”\n“The lawyer is on a business trip and won’t be back for a few days. Don’t worry, I can’t lie to you.”\nYiyi saw someone asking his mother for a debt. He thought the financial crisis had been resolved, but it turned out that it had not been completely suppressed. He was silently worried about his mother, but he didn’t dare ask her for fear of upsetting her.\nWearing mourning clothes, he went out to walk around the gate. Fang Zhongcheng heard the news and came to pay his respects. He was seen at the gate with his head down and in a low mood. There was a dead branch under his feet, which he rolled over and over again.\n“hmm,”\nHearing the sound, he looked up and saw him. Shen Ruyi then lowered his head and used his foot to pull the dead branch.\nThis father turned a blind eye. Fang Zhongcheng sighed helplessly, thinking of his son. Seeing his son, the regret in his heart surged up. Such an excellent child; why did he give up in the first place?\n“How is your mother doing lately?”\n“Good.”\n“Your mother’s factory was sued by the users, and your grandfather passed away at this critical time. If the dealers return the products, the products produced will not be sold, and the suppliers will demand payment; the factory may go bankrupt.”\n“You’re talking nonsense. My mother is fine. You don’t need to worry about her.”\n“Yiyi , you are a grown-up boy now; don’t act on impulse.”\nFang Zhongcheng was trying to persuade his son earnestly. Shen Ruyi thought about the supplier who came to ask for money before; the factory’s lawsuit had not yet been resolved, and his grandfather had passed away at this critical moment. All the pressure was on his mother’s shoulders. He was his mother’s son, and he had grown up and had to share his mother’s worries.\nAt night, the family burned paper for the old man, and Li Xia noticed that Yiyi was in a bad mood. “What’s wrong? What happened?”\nHe hesitated and said, “Mom, are you facing a financial crisis and in urgent need of money?”\nLi Xia nodded. “Yes, I’ve been a little short of money recently. What do you want to say? Can you get money for my mother?”\nShe just said this casually. The economic problem only occurred to the two timid ones, and the others were not affected much. Once the old man’s will was announced, everyone would naturally feel relieved. The factory belonged to her and Shen Haiyang. As long as the couple did not divorce, it would be as stable as a rock.\n“Fang Zhongcheng came to see me today and said that if I go with him, he will give me money. With this, you can…”\nLi Xia raised her hand and beat him without saying a word, and the bad boy got up and ran away.\n“Mom, mom, I didn’t agree. I didn’t agree. I mean, weren’t we attacked for poor product quality this time? I’m going to study mechanical and electronic engineering at the university, and I’ll organize a research and development department for you in the future. Didn’t you say you wanted to develop a mobile phone? I’ll lead people to develop it for you. It doesn’t matter if you can’t get through the current difficulties. When I develop a mobile phone for you, as long as our factory’s foundation is still there, we’ll be able to make a comeback in less than two years.”\nThe whole family was stunned, and Li Xia was also stunned. She thought the brat was thinking that since he was about to go to college, he could just treat him as if he were living on campus, and he would exchange one million for him.\nIt turned out that he had planned how to help her. He would learn the technology she needed most in college and take charge of the R&D department. Mom, you don’t have to be so tired and stressed. I’m here. I will develop new products for you. Even if we fail, we can still make a comeback. Don’t be afraid.\nShe stood there with tears in her eyes, and her emotions were surging like a huge wave. Even if her son chose to disagree with her again, he once again thought that as long as he could get money to help her, he would recognize Fang Zhongcheng. She would just beat him up out of anger and would not say words of breaking up like in her previous life.\nBut he didn’t. He didn’t know what his grandfather’s will was, nor did he know the current situation of the factory. Thinking that his mother was facing a huge crisis, he didn’t make a deal with Fang Zhongcheng. He chose to study the major that his mother needed most and let his mother wait for him to return after graduation to help her make a comeback.\n“How much did he say he would give you?”\n“one million.”\n“He underestimates me too much. He wants to buy my son for one million. Humph!” Li Xia sneered and turned to look at the brat. “How much does he give you to trade with him?”\nThe brat was stunned for a moment, then shook his head like a rattle. “I don’t like it at all. He told me to change my last name to Fang.” He shuddered all over.\n“No, no, I don’t want any money, no matter how much it costs. If I need money, I’ll go earn it myself. It’s not like I can’t make money. Our family is down for now, but I’ll help it get back up again in the future. What’s there to be afraid of?”\nLi Xia suddenly choked up and couldn’t speak. She reached out and hugged her son. She was ready to accept his realism, but he told her that he would never recognize that man no matter how much money he was offered.\nWith the changes in his living environment and education, he is no longer as proud and superficial as he was in his previous life. He no longer feels inferior and resentful, and he no longer argues about fairness or unfairness.\nInstead, he was as tough and unyielding as a man at a young age. When she encountered misfortunes and crises, he told his mother heroically, “Don’t be afraid; wait for me to come back. I will help you make a comeback.”\n“Don’t cry, Mom.” The older boy patted his mother’s back to comfort her. “We are all grown up.\nWe are grown up now, and we are there for you no matter what happens. And Dad, as long as we are together as a family, even if the factory collapses, we can help it get back up again together. ”\nLi Xia couldn’t stop crying, and Shen Hui came over to comfort her. The two tall boys protected their mother and patted her to comfort her.\n“Don’t cry, mom. Yiyi is right; you don’t have to be afraid. I also studied mechanical and electronic engineering in college, and you know I’ve always been good at physics. With the two of us here, we can develop high-end products and make a comeback in no time.”\nLi Xia burst into laughter, but she couldn’t stop crying. Huihua wiped her tears with a handkerchief. “Okay, stop crying. Although I’m not good at learning skills, I cook for mom, massage her back, draw for her, play the piano, and sing for her.”\nLi Xia looked at her husband and finally stopped crying. “You two bastards. The factory crisis is over. You were fooled. Fang Zhongcheng is a bastard. He wants nothing but bad things to happen to me. You want to take advantage of my misfortune and snatch my son away. No way.”\nShen Hui was confused: “Isn’t it that we were sued, our order was cancelled, and the creditor wants money?”\nYiyi was also confused: “Yes.”\n“I was sued because I didn’t want them to use more despicable tactics. Mom already has a trick up her sleeve to deal with them. The orders weren’t cancelled, but there were too many. The debts were from suppliers, and we’ve agreed to a three-month grace period. After three months, the dealers’ payments will come back, and the funding problem will be solved. After Grandpa’s will is announced, the suppliers will naturally stop asking for money.”\nThe brothers breathed a sigh of relief: “So that’s how it is.”\n“So, are you going to study mechanical and electronic engineering in the future?”\nThe two brothers nodded in unison and said, “Yes.”\nYiyi sniffed: “Then recruit more talents in college.”\nShen Hui nodded. “Yes. Talent reserve is very important.”\nThe family had dinner and stayed vigil for the old man at night. Shen Haiyang asked the three children to go to bed, but they all shook their heads. Grandpa was gone, and this was the last time I would accompany him.\n“Grandpa used to watch TV every day. Why don’t we turn on the TV?” Yiyi suggested.\n“Okay.” Shen Haiyang moved the TV to a new location, plugged it in, and turned it on.\nAt 11 o’clock, the provincial TV station started broadcasting Hong Kong movies. Everyone sat down to watch the TV series. Shen Haiyang made tea and poured a cup for his father, as if he were still there, and the family was still watching TV together.\nAfter a sleepless night, he kept vigil until dawn. With the help of relatives and friends, the old man was cremated and buried side by side with Shen Haiyang’s mother in the cemetery.\nAt first, the old man proposed to bury them together, but later he asked a Feng Shui master to tell his fortune, and he said it was normal. He neither disagreed nor agreed, which is a bit intriguing. Finally, after much consideration, he decided not to bury them together but to live next to each other.\n“I feel sorry for her. I will atone for my sins toward her when I go down.”\n\n",
    "95": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c58/\nCHAPTER 58\nThe old man’s funeral went smoothly. After the helpers left, the house suddenly felt empty. Qin Mu poured some water and prepared to get the medicine, and she suddenly realized that she no longer had to do this on time every day.\nHe left and would never come back. She had sent her parents-in-law away, and now she was sending this old man, who treated her like a girl, away. She felt very sad.\nThe bracelet on her hand was given to her by the old man. The red envelopes he gave her every year accumulated to form a considerable income. After the old man passed away, the lawyer announced his will and left her a set of tea sets as a souvenir. The tea sets are antiques, and their value is hard to estimate.\nLi Xia came in and patted her. She turned around and burst into tears again. “Why did he leave like that?”\nLi Xia comforted her, “My condolences. It’s hard for me to accept it for the time being. When I came in and saw all this, it seemed like he would appear in the rocking chair and talk to me the next moment.”\nAs they said their condolences, their tears became more and more violent. The busyness of the funeral was over, and the pain of losing a loved one surged. When they walked or sat down, they thought about it and felt like needles were stabbing their hearts. Shen Haiyang is also very quiet these days.\nThe two of them stopped talking, sitting on the stools in silence. After the discomfort passed, Qin Mu finally talked about business.\n“The old man is gone too; will you still need me in the future?”\n“I’ll show you a way.” There are opportunities in every era. After being together for so long, she has shown Qin Mu a bright future. If she seizes the opportunity, her future development will be limitless.\n“You are very good at stewing meat. Now is a good time to open a vacuum-packed cooked food factory. The initial investment is not large, but the profit is definitely considerable. As people travel more, there will be a great demand for this kind of convenient food. You can stew eggs, stew meat, chicken legs, duck legs, etc.”\nQin Mu was a little panicked when she heard about investing in a factory. The only time she invested was in illegal fundraising. When she thought about having to rely on herself to open a factory, she was worried about what to do if she couldn’t sell it. Li Xia could naturally see her state and patted her on the back.\n“Go home and discuss this with your husband, Mr. Han. If he supports it, you can go ahead and do it.”\n“But I still feel scared.”\n“If you have his support, what are you afraid of? Don’t be afraid. You only have one chance in life to live up to your efforts to become a better person.\nA huge business opportunity is right in front of you; it depends on whether you grab it or not. This vacuum food has great potential, and the future is limitless; it all depends on your specific operation and ability.\nIn a few years, my company will be listed on the stock market, and then Han Jun, as a veteran, will be able to get the original shares. Now that the timing is just right and we are all helping you, you can seize the opportunity and start your own business. As for the miscalculation at the beginning, now that we use computers, I don’t believe you can still make mistakes with this. ”\n————\nThree days after her father-in-law’s funeral was over, her family came to express their condolences according to etiquette. The second and third brothers and their wives, as well as the eldest brother, all three families came with gifts.\nThey had been there during the funeral, and now they were sitting down just to advise the couple not to feel too sad. In this kind of situation, other people’s words are superficial, and getting over the sadness of losing a loved one takes time.\nThey sat quietly; the silence was awkward. The second brother’s wife was now quiet and didn’t dare to say much. She had been disciplined by the second brother before, and now she was obedient. The third brother and his wife didn’t know what to say, so Shen Haiyang took the initiative to bring up other topics.\n“Xuedong, have you recovered your previous investment?”\nLi Xuedong, who was named, nodded quickly. “I recovered some of it.” Then he said to Li Xia, “Don’t be angry, aunt; I know I was deceived again this time. I will open my eyes when looking for a partner in the future and find a girl who is living a decent life.”\nLi Xia nodded silently without saying anything. The third daughter-in-law said to her nephew, “Don’t be too ambitious. We are just old farmers. Don’t always think about those fashionable girls. How can such girls be interested in us?”\nThe third brother also agreed: “Your third aunt is right. It’s best to find a simple girl in the workshop. Don’t make trouble every day. It will only make your father worry and cause trouble for your aunt. A girl like that doesn’t like you, but your aunt.”\n“Yes, I know.”\nLi Xia’s family had lunch there and left. Shen Haiyang took a half-month leave due to his father’s funeral, and he has not yet returned to work. The two of them talked about the pyramid scheme at home, not knowing that Zhang Qiuhua, who was raising funds on the other side, had already run to the station and was about to leave by bus.\nShe was carrying a bag, and Murong Danling came to see her off. These two were like twins, and they had never been completely separated. At the beginning, Zhang Qiuhua took all the blame by herself, and because she didn’t expose so many goods, she was not sentenced severely. After she was released, the two got together again, and now they are at the end of their rope again.\n“Here are two hundred thousand. Don’t come back once you leave.”\n“Murong Danling, you have such a dark heart. I left a batch of goods for you when I was in jail, and now that you’ve made your fortune, is this how you repay me?”\nMurong Danling didn’t care: “With so much money, what else do you want?”\n“The amount of money raised is much more than this.”\n“We were targeted. Do you think the money raised should be returned? I asked you to get Li Xia’s money, but you were arrested by the police as soon as you got in touch. Li Xia is our nemesis. She was the one who put my sister in jail.”\nZhang Qiuhua also felt a bit unlucky. How could she not be able to cheat Li Xia when so many people raised funds? She registered a company; the project had such a broad prospect, and so many nouveau riche invested in it, how could she see through it at a glance? Not only did she not cheat her money, but she also destroyed her nest. But now is not the time to be upset about this. Now is the time to ask for more money.\n“Don’t try to deceive me. I and the other two were the ones who raised the funds, and you were hiding behind them. But now the money is in your hands, and you just want to keep it for yourself.”\n“Why are you so stupid? Two of them have already been arrested. If they betray you, they will lead to me. I can’t run away, but you have to spit out everything.”\nThe two of them panted and were silent for a long time, then Murong Danling pushed her. “Hurry up and go, and start over after you get out.”\n“How about you?”\n“Don’t worry about me, just go away.”\nAs long as the money is returned, the crime is not serious, but neither of them is the kind of person who can take it and then spit it out. The car salesman escaped because of Shen Haiyang’s clothes. Zhang Qiuhua, who is in charge of fundraising, wanted to trick Li Xia again, and this time she ran into trouble.\nThe other party called the police without saying anything. This time, the police investigated everything thoroughly. How could a project with no trace withstand a thorough investigation? What about the retired ships from foreign countries? Private individuals cannot go to see them, so how can public security not find them?\nDue to their different personalities, the high-return projects they thought were good were not reliable in the eyes of Li Xia and her friends. They did not believe in pie in the sky. If it was really that good, how could they raise funds from ordinary people?\nZhang Qiuhua fled in a car, and Murong Danling smiled contemptuously behind her. Zhang Qiuhua had always been in charge of the fundraising, and the two fake foreigners didn’t know her at all. Zhang Qiuhua ran away, so she was naturally safe. No one would know that she was the one behind the scenes.\nZhang Qiuhua sat in the car with a sneer on her face. “Murong Danling, you have to pay the price for what you have done. I took the responsibility for you back then; now it’s your turn.”\nI’ve suffered a loss once; do you think I’m still so stupid? I’m working with you, so won’t I know about your background? You smuggle motorcycles, cars, and cultural relics; don’t think I don’t know. Wait, wait for the big gift I will give you. You use me to raise funds, and now that it fails, you will send me away so that you won’t be implicated. Humph, it’s not that easy.\nMurong Danling drove to the location to pick up a batch of goods, calculating in her mind how much she could earn this time. While handing over the goods to the other party, the familiar scene made her feel uneasy. Her right eyelid couldn’t stop twitching, and superstitious thoughts began to run through her mind.\nLeft eye twitching means good fortune; right eye twitching means disaster. Could it be that something bad is going to happen?\n“Hey, boss, I’ve checked the goods, and they’re all fine.”\nHer assistant spoke, and she nodded dully. The goods began to be loaded, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. It was dark all around, with only the flashlights they carried flashing.\nShe was panicking, and her right eyelid was twitching. She put out the cigarette in her hand, got in the car, and drove away. The road on the hillside looked down at this place silently through the night.\n“Don’t move”\nA loud thunderclap rang through the night sky, and a flash of lightning flashed by. She saw that her people and goods were surrounded by the police. It was over; it was really over this time.\nRun. This thought flashed through her mind, and she quickly got into the car. She started the car and stepped on the accelerator, and the car shot out like an arrow from a bow.\nShe was very familiar with the terrain and drove at full speed. If she was caught here, then the clues led to her being the one responsible. She could no longer shirk responsibility.\nShe felt extremely anxious and heavy inside. Where should she hide? Where could she hide? Should she flee the country with Zhang Qiuhua? But how could she be willing to do that?\nShe smuggled motorcycles from the Sun Country, and after accumulating funds, she started smuggling cars in the past two years. She has cars from the Sun Country in Europe and America, and that’s a huge profit. In a few months, she can make more than she did in many years of selling clothes and small commodities. She has become very arrogant in the past few years.\nFor this, she hooked up with Tian Mu, whose sister was selling antiques and cultural relics and also acting as a contact for smuggling cars. She thought that she would go abroad after making a few more profits and then enjoy life with handsome men in luxurious houses, but now such huge profits have nothing to do with her.\nShe would be arrested, her property would be confiscated, and she would be left with nothing. She would be thrown into prison and lose even her freedom, and maybe she would have to eat peanuts.\nThinking of these possibilities, she shook her head frantically while holding the steering wheel. No, it can’t be possible. Zhang Qiuhua had told her about life in there. It was hard enough to live in a dormitory without the freedom to work. The most important thing was that there was a law of the jungle, and she would be bullied and pushed to sleep next to the toilet.\nNo, she was a germaphobe and would never let herself fall to that level. If that really happened, she would rather die.\nEat peanuts, say that. She was really thinking about dying; how could she bear it? Her hands began to tremble while driving; the fear came late and finally surged into her heart at this moment.\nShe drove madly into the city and stopped in front of a bank on a familiar road. If she wanted to escape, she had to withdraw money first; otherwise, her whereabouts would be exposed. And her account would probably be frozen soon.\nShe stopped in front of the only bank with an ATM in the city center and inserted her bank card with shaking hands. The ATM could only withdraw 2,000 yuan at a time and a maximum of 10 transactions a day.\nShe withdrew again and again, and on the sixth time, the ATM showed that the balance was insufficient. She began to reduce the amount again and again, and the last withdrawal was 100 yuan.\nTen thousand and one hundred, plus the original amount, was less than thirty thousand, so this little money was not enough to spend. After coming out, she continued to wait in the car. She had to wait for the bank to open and withdraw more money. Once her account was frozen, she would have no money left.\nIt was still dark while she was waiting. She couldn’t help but regret that she should not have deposited the money in the bank. She should have kept it at home and just run away with the cash.\nCan she run away? She didn’t know. But she had just caught those people, and it would take time to interrogate them. She had to run quickly. Why wasn’t the bank open yet?\nShe looked at the time; it was almost seven o’clock. Why did she keep all my money in the bank? Oh, she was afraid that if she kept the cash at home, it would be a bargain for Fang Zhongcheng.\nShe didn’t even have anyone she could trust, and she was on guard in everything she did. Now that she was at the end of her rope, she could only struggle on her own.\nBefore dawn, before the bank door opened, she sat in the car, waiting anxiously. Lying on the steering wheel, her mind was in a mess. She thought of her son, the only son in her life. She heard that he was the top student in No. 1 Middle School and the teacher’s favorite.\nHer excellent son now calls Li Xia “Mom.” She feels sad when she thinks about it. How could Li Xia get all the benefits? She also wants to wait until she earns enough money to bring her son to immigrate. He is such a good student that he can go to the United States to study.\nEven at this point, she still has no self-reflection. She blames the heavens, the earth, and the air, but not herself. After abandoning her husband and son, Shen Haiyang woke up and thought it was God playing tricks on her. Shen Haiyang had a rich father, which was God playing tricks on her. She didn’t want her son, but he was so outstanding, which was also a bargain for Li Xia.\nShe never thought about what Shen Haiyang and his son would be like if there was no Li Xia and what her son would be like under her influence.\nShe sat there anxiously, holding the bag of cash in her arms. Her right eyelid began to twitch again, and she was so flustered that she couldn’t control herself. She rubbed the bank card repeatedly, then drove away with gritted teeth.\n————\nIt was dawn, and Aunt Xu had prepared dinner. Today was a workday, and Li Xia and her husband had already gotten up and washed up. The three children had breakfast at school, so they were the only ones left at home.\nThere were two houses in the front and back yards. It was so large that, with them the only ones there, it felt empty. Auntie chatted with Li Xia while eating and asked her when the villa she bought would be renovated.\n“Now that you’re done installing it, you should move over there, right?”\nLi Xia replied, “Probably.”\nShe didn’t say much, and the aunt didn’t ask much. After dinner, she went to work. The supplier’s payment was delayed, so she asked Han Jun to come to the office and ask him about the production situation these days. “The old man’s death didn’t have much impact. There were no orders cancelled, right?”\n“No. Ever since you started the promotion of buying a heater and giving away a socket, our heaters have suppressed other brands, and sales have been rising steadily. As soon as the old man’s will was announced, the suppliers also stabilized.”\n“That’s good.”\n“Don’t worry. Once the court hearing and the verdict are made, this matter will be completely over.”\n“Yeah. When does the trial start?”\n“next week.”\n“Okay, you can go there then.”\n“Okay, leave it to me.”\nHer job is stable now. She was in a good mood, so after getting off work, she went to buy a cake. Children like to eat this. Eating sweets can make people happy. Everyone is calm. The old man passed away, and life has to go on.\nIn the evening, they waited for the children to come back from their evening self-study before cutting the cake. The first piece was offered to Grandpa in the backyard. The seventh day had passed, and they didn’t know if the old man’s soul was still there. But they just assumed that he was there, and he was watching his family live a peaceful life.\nShen Hui put down the cake and kowtowed to his grandfather, remembering what his grandfather taught him. Boys should be broad-minded and compromise when necessary. They should be both firm and flexible, and remember that being too firm will lead to failure.\n“Grandpa, have you seen Grandma?” If you have, tell her that I am doing well so that she can rest assured. Dad is also doing well. We have been very happy these years because of mom.”\n“Brother, it’s time to eat.”\nYiyi called him from outside, and he stood up, bowed to the portrait, and left the room. The two brothers always quarreled with each other, and Yiyi was not as tall as his brother, so he jumped up and ran after his brother after he snatched his candied haws.\nA week later, the lawsuit in City E went to court. Li Xia had made preparations in advance, and all the reporters from newspapers and TV were present that day.\nIn court, there was an official accident investigation report, which clearly showed that the accident had nothing to do with product quality. The final verdict was that neither the manufacturer nor the dealer was responsible, and it was entirely due to improper use by the consumer. However, out of humanitarianism, the manufacturer gave appropriate compensation.\nAfter leaving the court, the reporter immediately went to interview the parties involved. “Is it true that there were wet clothes just washed on the electric heater on the day of the accident?”\n“It should be. My mother is old and illiterate, so she doesn’t know much about these electrical appliances.”\nOkay, the following is not important. At this point, the accident has nothing to do with product quality. Covering is strictly prohibited, and consumers know these four big words. If you don’t use it according to the instructions and buy a cheap plug board, you can only blame yourself if something goes wrong.\nThe lawsuit was won, and public opinion was building momentum. Rainbow Electric won, and there was no problem with the quality of its products.\n“Boss, we received another order for heaters today. Most areas in the north will be very cold for half a month after the heating is turned off. Now that living conditions have improved, many people will buy heaters. Speed up production, because once the weather gets warmer, this thing will enter the off-season.”\nLi Xia smiled on the phone: “It’s okay. Even if it’s the off-season, the fans should be running fast.”\n \n\n",
    "96": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c59/\nCHAPTER 59\nThe storm was completely suppressed from then on. When Han Jun came back from City E, he told her about the follow-up. “The other party got angry and threatened the person involved. The person involved went to the police station to report the case. There was a recording as evidence, and the other party was temporarily detained. But the guy was quite single, and he completely denied the boss behind him.\nHe said he was originally an employee of Rainbow, and after being fired, he held a grudge against us, so he targeted and framed us. The content in the recorder is also very rigorous, and the people behind it cannot be implicated. ”\n“So, he is the one who takes the blame for this?”\n“This should be.”\n“Normal. Our competition with Japanese capital is long-lasting. As the old saying goes, competitors are enemies.”\n“Well. It doesn’t matter. We won this battle completely. Our market share increased, and our brand became more famous. The opponent must be gritting his teeth in anger behind the TV. His actions have helped us. He lost people and money, but our brand became more famous. He lost this time.”\n“Quality, taxation, and key points must be grasped, and the other party must not be given an opportunity to take advantage of them. The other small tricks are not acceptable. We will have professional public relations in the future, and when the image of domestic brands is fully established, that is, when Japanese capital will fade away, We will not only compete with them for the domestic market, but we will also begin to expand our overseas sales channels to compete with them in all aspects.”\n“Okay.”\nHan Jun nodded. This is not the old days. In the old days , people dared to fight and kill and use force to force people. Now he has to pay the price for doing such a small thing. The key now is to stand firm and compete for market share. It would be more painful to let him not have a piece of cake than to let him go to jail.\nTaking away someone’s wealth is like killing their parents. The business world is a battlefield without the smoke of gunpowder. It is a protracted war. Her usual approach is to strengthen herself rather than get entangled with others. Strengthening yourself is weakening the enemy.\nAs long as you are still on the battlefield (market), the enemy will not disappear. Instead of wasting time entangled with anyone, it is better to strengthen yourself and not be afraid of wind and rain. Otherwise, you kill the wolf and turn around to find a tiger next to you. When you run out of strength, you lose the ability to fight.\nOf course, if you catch the handle, you have to make the other party pay the price. He has to throw out the car to save the king. It costs a lot to appease him behind the scenes.\nAs the two were talking, Xiao Liu came in with a bunch of stuff in her hands. “The group company we were planning to set up has been approved by the Industrial and Commercial Bureau. The seal has been changed, but the public account is still the same as before.\nAlso, our bid has been prepared; please take a look, boss. This is a good project to make money. After it is built, we can keep a few floors for our own use and rent out the rest. We can just wait for the rent to be collected in a year. The bidding will be at the beginning of next month, so we must be fully prepared. ”\n“I’ll take a look at it.”\n“Okay, I’ll put them all here for you.”\nThis battle was a great victory. The subsequent orders were delivered one by one, funds began to flow back, and all previous debts were paid off. After the New Year, when spring came and the flowers bloomed, she discussed with her husband that it was time to renovate the villa.\n“The house is ready for renovation. I guess our house will be demolished soon, so we’ll have a place to live when we move.”\n“OK.”\nShen Haiyang put down the book and kissed his wife’s energetic face. The factory has overcome another hurdle and has become stronger. From her voice, he knows she has money again. In recent years, the factory has been expanding, the R&D department has been constantly producing new products, and the popularity of the Rainbow brand has now reached a new level.\nThe couple did an exercise to promote their relationship, and they woke up the next day feeling refreshed. In the bathroom, she talked to her aunt about the decoration, and she enthusiastically discussed the current decoration style with her.\n“The heater is completely enclosed with hollow wooden boards, and the bedroom doors are also the kind with door frames. And the curtains are now popular. Gold velvet floor-length curtains are double-layered, with hollow tulle inside, which allows light to pass through but not people.”\n“Yeah. I called my cousin, and he came to install it for me.”\n“Your cousin is quite honest in his work, isn’t he?”\n“I think it’s okay. He’s not the kind of person who would take advantage of his acquaintances. We’re all real relatives. If he dares to cheat me, my aunt will beat him to death.”\n“Ha ha,”\nAs they were talking, they finished their breakfast. During the break, two policemen wearing wide-brimmed hats came in. The two policemen saluted as they entered the room. Shen Haiyang invited them to sit down in the main hall. The other party was not polite either.\nLet’s get to the point.\n“Murong Danling is guilty of smuggling, and the amount involved is huge. Now the evidence is irrefutable. She is on the run, and there has been no progress in her pursuit during this period. She is your son’s biological mother. Has she appeared in your home recently or contacted you?”\nShen Haiyang shook his head. “No.”\nMurong Danling was found out, which was both expected and unexpected. A few years ago, Zhang Qiuhua was imprisoned for smuggling, and she got her in even though they were partners. She didn’t stop, even though the boat had capsized. This time, she finally fell into the water and is now wanted by the police.\n“If she shows up or contacts you in any other way, please call the police immediately.”\n“OK.”\n“We have been keeping an eye on her accomplice, Zhang Qiuhua. She was arrested at the border and brought back. We have made a lot of progress in our surprise interrogation. According to her, Murong Danling is thinking about her own son, Shen Hui. Now that it has come to this, we believe that she may be looking for Shen Hui. Please call the police immediately if you find her.”\n“Okay.”\nAfter the police explained the situation, they said goodbye and left. Shen Haiyang looked solemn. Li Xia turned around and looked at him silently. The man explained: “It’s smuggling, and the amount involved is huge. She won’t be able to get away with it this time. As Huihui’s biological mother, Huihui will not be able to work in politics in the future.”\nHe sighed after saying this. “It wasn’t the child’s choice to do this. Now he is forced to cut off a path. I always feel it’s a pity.”\n“Didn’t the old man say that we can’t choose where we’re born, but we can choose our own lives? As long as Huihui is good enough, there are thousands of paths in this world. There’s no need to focus on just one and feel sorry for it.”\n“That’s right. I’m just worrying about nothing.”\nThe police came to the door and made it clear that Murong Danling might come to find Shen Hui. The couple immediately decided to talk to the child in the evening and let him know the development of the situation.\nShen Haiyang called her and told her the latest news: “Fang Zhongcheng has been suspended.”\n“Because of Murong Danling?”\n“It should be related.”\n“He deserves it. It’s almost impossible for him to say he didn’t know anything about his wife doing such a thing. Will he go to jail this time? Well, the three of the children can forget about becoming civil servants in the future.”\n“That’s not necessarily true. If there is no solid evidence to prove that he knew about it and participated in it, then he cannot be legally convicted. It just affected his career, and he may have to work in another industry in the future.”\n“The most important thing is Huihui. Now is the critical moment. We must tell the child that no matter what happens, he must remain calm.”\n“Well, I’ll talk to him.”\nAfter the evening self-study class, when they came home, Li Xia and Shen Haiyand told the children the news. Huihua opened her mouth but said nothing. Yiyi looked indifferent. He was much more hard-hearted than his sister. Shen Hui was also silent, not knowing what to say to his biological mother.\nHe washed up and went to bed at night, but he tossed and turned and couldn’t sleep. The next day was the weekend, and he got up early in the morning to go for a run. Soon, his father came over to the park. The two of them walked slowly, and his father waited for him to speak without saying anything.\n“Dad, if she is caught, how many years will she be sentenced to?”\n“I asked around, and I think it could be life imprisonment or the death penalty.”\nThe amount involved in the case was huge, and they really didn’t care about anything for the sake of money. Shen Hui didn’t ask any more questions, and he lowered his head with a very disappointed look.\n“Son, none of us can choose our parents, but we can choose our own lives.”\nShen Hui raised his head and said, “Dad, I know.” The child stretched out his finger and said, “Just run one more lap, and I’ll be fine. I still have to study. I promised mom that I would go to the best school to study electronic and mechanical engineering.”\n“Okay, Dad will run with you.”\nThe father and son ran slowly for 800 meters along the track. When they returned home, Shen Hui finally came out of his bad mood. When he got home, his mother had already prepared breakfast, including his favorite wontons and fried dough sticks. His mother made the wontons herself and fried the dough sticks herself.\n“Wash your hands and eat.”\nHis mother didn’t say anything. He smiled at her smiling face. “I’ll go call Yiyi .”\nOf the three children, Shen Hui was most concerned. She put aside the other two and didn’t take them seriously. Yiyi has been studying very hard recently. If she said that he used 60% of his effort before, now it seems that he is in the sprint.\nRecently, the light in his room was turned off around 12 o’clock, and he reads books while eating in the morning. Li Xia reached out to take away his book, and he looked at his mother with a confused expression.\n“You are only in your first year of high school. There are still more than two years before the college entrance examination.”\n“I plan to take the college entrance examination with my brother and sister and not waste time here.”\n“Shen Ruyi, what’s wrong with you? We agreed to study slowly over three years of high school; why do you want to compress the time?”\n“The three of us will take the TOEFL together in the second half of this year. If we pass, I would like to study abroad as soon as possible.”\n“Son, isn’t it too tiring? You’re only fourteen. Normally, you’ll go to junior high school, and those who enroll early will go to high school in the second half of the year. Are you planning to study abroad?”\n“It depends on the scores. If my scores are on par with my brother’s, I will apply. If not, I will continue to study in high school. Don’t worry, I will definitely learn well.”\nLi Xia turned to look at Shen Haiyang. The man remained silent and did not interfere with the child’s decision. This child has had his own ideas since he was young, and he should be respected. It would be good if the three children went out together so that they could take care of each other.\nWhen Huihua heard her brother say that he was worried about the TOEFL test, she decided to stay up an hour later at night. She had to study hard before the battle. In fact, she started learning foreign languages when she was very young, and her foreign language scores were always at the top in school. But when she took the test with her brother and Yiyi , she suddenly felt a lot of pressure.\nYiyi exerted all his strength, and Shen Hui was not willing to lag behind. The two brothers competed with each other in terms of learning. All Li Xia could do for her children was to ensure good logistics. She went to the vegetable market with the aunt, bought a lot of ingredients, and made nutritious meals for her children in various ways.\nAuntie took a leave of absence on Friday, so Shen Haiyang got up early in the morning to send the three children to school. Li Xia thought about going to the factory to deal with some things in the morning and rushing home before 11 o’clock so as not to delay cooking for the children. Recently, the three children have been studying very hard, so they stewed pork ribs for lunch and made tiger skin quail eggs. The three of them liked it very much.\n\n   (tiger skin quail eggs)\nAfter breakfast, the couple drove away and locked the house door. The huge house was empty, and the back room had been renovated, cleaned, and put on display shelves, waiting to be opened next week after the products were put on display.\nAt the corner, seeing that they had all left, the woman held the key in her hand and observed around before slowly approaching. When the incident first happened, the police also set up surveillance on Shen Hui’s activity route and followed Shen Hui’s activities for a week. Later, there were not enough police forces, so they did not continue these days.\nShe was dressed normally but looked a little nervous. But passersby were in a hurry, and no one paid attention to her. She was holding the key with her hands shaking nervously, for fear that a familiar neighbor of the Shen family would see her.\n“Click.” This key was really powerful. It opened the door quickly. She quickly pushed it open a crack and slipped in, then quickly closed the door and bolted it from the inside.\nThe same method was used to open the main room door. The woman looked up at the time and began to search through the boxes and cabinets to find the place where the cash was kept. Li Xia was such a big boss; her family should not be penniless.\nShe threw out the boxes, cabinets, and clothes inside. As time passed, she didn’t find the cash. She was angry and regretful. Why couldn’t she control her hands? Why did she go to gamble? All the money she brought with her was lost. Now she is so poor that she can’t make a living and has to hide from place to place. She can only come here to look for opportunities.\nShe rummaged through the drawers and found several hundred dollars under the pillow on the bed. She put the cash in her pocket and continued. She didn’t hear anyone coming back from outside.\nShen Hui had a stomachache for unknown reasons, so he had no choice but to ask for leave from his teacher to go home. Li Xia had prepared some common medicines at home, so he thought about going home to take the medicine first and then seeing how things went.\nThere was a padlock hanging on the door, and I pushed the door, but it wouldn’t open. It was obviously bolted, but who was home? Mom should be home to cook for them at this time.\n“Mom, are you home?”\nShen Hui shouted, and Murong Danling, who was rummaging inside, dropped the things in her hands on the ground in fear. She subconsciously wanted to hide. She opened the closet, lifted the bed sheet,. Where should she hide?\n“Mom, can you hear me? I came back from school with a stomachache.”\nShe quickly went out, took a fruit knife from the kitchen, and ran to open the house door neatly. Shen Hui was very surprised to see her, and before he could say anything, the woman pulled him in and locked the door again.\n“Why are you in my house?”\nMurong Danling didn’t answer him but turned and walked inside.\nShen Hui followed subconsciously and grabbed her at the door of the main room: “Speak up; why are you in my house? How did you get in? What are you doing in my house?”\n“Let go.” Murong Danling shook off his hand. “Why are you asking? I’m your mother; there’s nothing wrong with me coming to your house.”\nShen Hui was speechless. How could you say such a thing with such confidence? He remembered what his parents had told him before. Just as he was about to speak, she turned around and pointed a knife at him. The child was frightened and stepped back subconsciously, all the way to the wall.\n“What are you going to do?”\n“Give me all the money in your house.”\n“I don’t have any cash, just a passbook.”\nHold her back and find a way to call the police later. Dad said his own safety was the most important thing. As for her, it was okay to let her go in the current situation. Wait until she leaves, and then call the police. There are police to arrest her. There is no need to take risks as a child.\n“Go and get it.”\nUnder the knife point of her, Shen Hui went back to the house and took out his bankbook: “All my New Year’s money is here.”\nMurong Danling opened it and saw that the amount was not small. She started to feel jealous again. Li Xia had made a lot of money over the years. She had taken risks to make money, but now she was in danger and had to do the business of breaking into houses and picking locks. But Li Xia was safe and sound and didn’t take any risks. She had made much more than she had over the years.\n“Take the money and leave quickly.”\nShen Hui spoke again and made a move to walk toward the street gate. Murong Danling grabbed him and said, “Where is Li Xia’s money? Go and get it out for me.”\nShen Hui was full of surprise and smiled. “Who would keep a large amount of cash at home? What are you thinking? The company has its own public account, and individuals also have their own private accounts. The cash is only enough for daily expenses.”\n“Give me the money before I can leave. Otherwise, how can I go out like this?”\n“Isn’t my passbook money?”\n“Li Xia must have a passbook or something like that at home. Go get it and come with me to the bank to withdraw it for me. I’ll take it and go abroad. I’ll never come back, and I’ll never appear in front of you again. She’s so rich, she doesn’t care about these little things.”\nGreedy, Shen Hui smiled helplessly. No matter how many chances she was given, she would still follow the same path. She had never regretted her journey to where she was now. She would do anything for money. This was her mindset. The more he reminded her to leave, the more she started to think about other things.\n“I don’t know. How can my mother’s money tell me a little kid where she keeps her money ?”\n“Your mother? Shen Hui, you ungrateful bastard, who is your mother?”\nShen Hui looked coldly and wanted to say that it was definitely not you. But thinking of his grandfather’s teachings and his father’s instructions, he remained silent and did not argue with her.\n“My stomach hurts; I’m going to the backyard toilet to take care of it.”\n“Don’t leave. Don’t act pretentiously.”\nMurong Danling held him back, and Shen Hui pretended to bend over and hold his stomach. “I asked for leave because I was not feeling well; otherwise, why would I come home in the middle of the morning?”\nMurong Danling was in a dilemma. Shen Hui continued to say with a grin, “Let go quickly, or I’m going to poop my pants.”\nHe shook her off and ran to the backyard. He knew that Murong Danling would not do anything to him unless there was any danger. Sure enough, when Murong Danling saw him running to the backyard and heard him fart, she immediately covered her mouth and nose with a disgusted expression.\nHe ran to the bedroom of his grandfather on the east side of the main hall, and Murong Danling began to search the house where the old man lived. The old man was a rich man, so even if there was no cash, it would be fine if he could find something valuable.\nAfter Shen Hui entered the room and closed the door, he picked up the receiver and decisively dialed the police number. The police had come before, and he had left them his number. After the call was connected, he didn’t say anything. The other party suddenly reacted after being confused.\n“Is it Murong Danling who showed up?”\nHe remained silent, and the other party continued, “Okay, got it. Try to keep her steady; we’ll be there soon.”\nAfter the other party said this, he hung up the phone and waited in the house for the police to arrive. Murong Danling was searching for things while yelling at him, so he stood up and walked out to avoid alerting the enemy.\n“Why are you yelling? My stomach hurts.”\n“Don’t play tricks on me.”\n“I don’t want to bother with you.”\nHe was stalling for time in the house while Li Xia came back outside. Seeing that the door was bolted from the inside, she immediately became alert. She put down the food and went to the next door to call the police. The police from the nearest police station arrived within a few minutes.\nThe police officer opened the bolt in front and prepared to move forward. She went around the garage secret door with anti-wolf spray in her hand. She wanted to block the way and prevent the enemy from escaping. Although this place is very hidden and the enemy may find it and get out, it is still just in case.\nBefore opening the door, she leaned close to listen and heard the voices of Shen Hui and Murong. Through the crack in the door, she saw Murong holding a fruit knife. She had agreed with the police to just block the door, but now she was worried about her son, so she opened the door carefully and went in. This position was right behind Murong.\nShen Hui saw her, and the boy was in a state of panic, fearing that something might happen to her, but his expression remained unchanged, cooperating with her actions. He spoke to attract Murong Danling’s attention.\n“My mother never leaves cash at home. You are doomed to be disappointed. Go out now and get the money quickly. No one will know.”\n“Shut up. Li Xia is so rich; she must have jewelry, right?”\n“I’ve never seen her wearing it.”\n“you,”\n“Puff, puff.”\nLi Xia seized the opportunity, covered her mouth and nose, held her breath, and sprayed the spray at Murong Danling. After spraying, she pulled her son and ran, and the mother and son ran all the way to the entrance of the alley. Open the door of the alley from the inside so that they can attack or defend.\n“Help, help.”\nObviously, she was too vigilant this time. Murong Danling fell to the ground and lost her ability to move. The fruit knife in her hand fell to the side, and she was no longer able to reach it.\nMurong Danling was already exhausted, and her face was filled with fear.\nThe police officer in the front yard also opened the door and came in from the front. He went straight in, handcuffed her, and took all three of them back to the police station.\nMurong Danling was taken into the interrogation room while she and Shen Hui were outside taking notes. After the registration, the police asked them to wait for a while, then took the notes and went inside.\nLi Xia raised her hand and patted the child on the shoulder. “If you are sad, just say it out. You should vent your emotions appropriately.”\nThe child raised his head to face her, then smiled. “I’m not sad, really. I don’t know when I was no longer influenced by her. The result today is her own choice. She chose her own path, and it has nothing to do with me.”\n“That’s the right thing to think of.”\nLi Xia was outside with her son, and Shen Haiyang came and went into the interrogation room to see Murong Danling. The woman had been silent and didn’t say anything before, but when she saw him come in, she looked up. Her eyes were dazed for a moment, and his mature and elegant face now overlapped with his youthful face when she first saw him.\nAt that time, he was a little shy, and when she took the initiative, he blushed all of a sudden and was as immature and green as an unripe fruit on a tree. Now he is mature and steady, with gentle features and an elegant temperament, and his eyes are upright and clear.\nHe sat down opposite her because Murong Danling asked to see him. The two policemen withdrew and left the interrogation room to them, and they watched through the glass window.\n“What do you want me to say?”\n“Help, help me; I don’t want to die. After all, I am your son’s biological mother. A husband and wife for a day is a hundred days of grace. We have also…”\n“People always have to pay the price for what they do.”\nShen Haiyang got up and left without wasting any more time with her. Her words proved that she knew the consequences, but she still got herself into this situation step by step. She regretted being caught, but she regretted not hiding well and not doing such a thing.\nHe didn’t want to say anything more about her. The police notified him to come because they wanted to stop Murong Danling from thinking about it and let her confess the facts as soon as possible and not dream of having external help.\nThe law is fair, and he believes that the law will give her a fair ending.\n \n\n",

She held her mother’s hand and acted like a spoiled child, saying that she didn’t want to leave her and go abroad.\n“Mom, they are both going abroad, so I will stay in the country to accompany you and dad, okay?”\nLi Xia patted her daughter and said, “You can accompany mom and dad after you come back from studying abroad.”\n“But I don’t want to go.” Huahua leaned on her mother’s shoulder and looked at her father. Shen Haiyang always indulged his daughter. He let her go abroad because he wanted her to gain experience. If she didn’t want to, he wouldn’t force her.\n“Can you tell me why you didn’t want to go?”\n“I just want to stay with my parents.”\nShe is only seventeen years old, so it would be better for the girl to stay with her for a few more years. When she wants to go abroad after graduating from college, she will go there. By then, she will be older and more mature in dealing with the outside world.\n“Why not? Let’s wait until our daughter is a little older before we discuss this matter. If the two brats want to leave, let them go.”\n“All right.”\nShen Hui and Yiyi both learned foreign languages in elementary school. When they were young, they set a goal for themselves to study abroad, which required a high level of foreign language proficiency. With sufficient preparation, they passed the TOEFL test in one try.\nIn the second half of the year, Yiyi skipped a grade and took classes in the senior year. He took cram classes during the summer vacation and asked Li Xia to find three teachers for him. Shen Hui was overtaken by his brother and had no choice but to follow him. When the senior year started, his brother joined their class, and their grades started to sprint. The head teacher was very happy. With these two brothers, he would have a guaranteed bonus for this semester.\nLi Xia’s work at the factory was relatively stable. She would go home early to make supper for her children when she had time. Yiyi grew up very fast this year, from 1.66 meters to 1.78 meters in one year.\nThe brat completely lost his baby fat and became thin. Other high school students were paying attention to their appearance, but he was probably not old enough to be aware of this issue. He had short hair and asked for two sets of school uniforms, which he would wear when they got dirty.\nMany children dislike the large, dark blue and white striped school uniforms of high school. After the flag-raising ceremony on Monday, they must change into their own clothes on Tuesday, but this child said it was too troublesome and it was more comfortable to wear school uniforms. And he didn’t feel bad about it. He just wiped it with his sleeves when it got dirty.\nShe was thinking about going shopping to buy clothes for her kids in the afternoon, and now Qin Mu came to her house.\nAuntie was cooking dinner, and Li Xia was peeling sweet potatoes. Today, she was making sweet potato glutinous rice cakes for the kids. Qin Mu came and washed her hands familiarly while helping her cook and chatting with her.\n\n“Han Jun said that he’s working at Rainbow, and he’s not interested in the food factory. He doesn’t want to do it, and I don’t dare to do it alone.”\nHan Jun played an indispensable role in Li Xia’s entrepreneurship. Not to mention that he served her well later; even if he hadn’t been there at the beginning, she would have been robbed on the road when she was selling goods from north to south, and there would be no future. The original plan was to give him original shares when the company went public, and if he wanted to start his own business, she would give him some money. Now that he has made up his mind, he will just follow her in the future.\nHan Jun had his own considerations. At their age, it was really risky for them to quit their jobs and start a new business. He was doing well at Rainbow and earning a good income. Seeing that Rainbow had a bright future, there was no need to be obsessed with whether he could be the boss.\n“It takes a lot of work to open a factory. So, is there anything you want to do? If you don’t have enough investment, I can lend you some.”\nQin Mu smiled a little embarrassedly, not confident in this aspect. “I want to open a delicatessen.”\nLi Xia understood it all at once and smiled and nodded at her. Doing things step by step, standing in your position, only considering what to do to make more money, forgetting that things need a development process. In the past few years, individual stores were rare, and people were afraid of them and felt that they were not safe. Now that there are more individual stores, it can also give Qin Mu courage.\n“Very good. Have you found a suitable store?”\n“Do you think I can do it on my own?”\n“Absolutely.” She encouraged him with a smile, cheering him up. “Any problems you encounter, let Han Jun help you solve them. You can just take care of them yourself. If you need my help, just let me know. We’ve been sisters for so many years, and I’ll support you.”\nQin Mu took a deep breath and smiled. “If you say so, I’ll do it.”\n“Just do it. If you encounter a problem that Han Jun can’t solve, come to me.”\nShe washed the sweet potatoes, peeled them, sliced them, and steamed them. She also prepared pork and water chestnuts, chopped them up, and made glutinous rice balls. Huihua liked the sweet ones, and Shen Hui liked the salty ones. Either one was fine; as long as they had something to eat when they came home at night, they would be satisfied.\n“Qin Mu, let’s go shopping this afternoon.”\n“Okay, what are you going to buy? Are you going to buy clothes for Yiyi ? I see he wears school uniforms on weekends. The child has grown a lot in this year, and his clothes may not fit him anymore.”\n“Well, buy some clothes for the brat. He doesn’t choose his own clothes, and I can’t just let him wear school uniforms all the time. He’s going to apply to schools abroad soon, so he needs to dress up.”\n“Your three kids are really capable. I don’t know what the outcome will be for my son.”\n“It seems like your son hasn’t come to my house in the past two years. Is it because the kids don’t get along well?”\nQin Mu smiled. “What? He said he was too shocked to see the top student.”\n“You can ask Huihui or Yiyi to give him extra lessons.”\n“Forget it. Don’t waste the two kids’ time with his dull mind.”\nQin Mu was too modest. In fact, her two children should have no problem getting into college. Shen Hui said they were in the top 200 in their grade, so they should be able to get into college with this score.\nThe two chatted while cooking and eating and went shopping together in the afternoon. Li Xia bought the clothes for the brothers, and they had a big change of clothes. The weather was warm, and the clothes were thin, so she bought out whatever she liked.\nShirts, T-shirts, trousers, shorts, short-sleeved shirts, shoes and socks, underwear, watches, Qin Mu bought less than one-tenth of what she bought, and she just helped her carry things along the way.\n“It’s still a long way to go, so just buy three or five sets to keep for later use.”\n“We’ll see when he grows up. If he goes abroad, we have to prepare him well. This kid is too lazy in this regard. I don’t know if it’s because he’s too young; he doesn’t know the difference between beauty and ugliness, nor does he know how to be shy. He seems to be a bit stupid.”\n“He is young. The child should be in junior high school now, but now he is going to study abroad. He is too young to understand these things.”\n“Well, we’ll probably know in a few years.”\nYiyi was less enthusiastic about the clothes his mother bought him than about the midnight snacks. At Li Xia’s urging, he tried them one by one. He took them off impatiently and quickly went to eat the fried meatballs.\n“Yeah, delicious. Mom, why did you buy so many clothes? Just make more delicious food for me when you have time.”\n“If I don’t buy you clothes, how will you change them when you go out? If you are busy with schoolwork, then you can only wash them once a week at most. You have to have more clothes to change them.”\nLi Xia rolled her eyes at him and looked back at Shen Hui. Shen Hui was still wearing the shirt and trousers she bought for him today and said to his mother, “It fits perfectly.”\n“Very good. My son is good-looking and looks good in anything he wears.”\nShen Hui smiled embarrassedly, ate supper, and studied for another hour before turning off the lights and going to bed. He always felt that he was better than Yiyi , and he must not lose to him. Now he was in the same class as his younger brother, which was stressful but also very motivating.\n~~~~~~\nAfter the college entrance examination, he and Yiyi both got very good grades. With the recommendation of their grandfather’s friend, their applications to foreign universities were successfully approved. The next step was to apply for passports and visas, which they had been preparing for before, and now the process is very fast.\nThe two brothers went abroad together and studied at the same school and major. Although Li Xia told them to choose what they liked and that her factory could recruit college students majoring in electronic mechanics, they didn’t have to sacrifice their own preferences; the two children just smiled and still chose this.\nThe two brothers were determined to return to China as soon as possible, studying from dawn to dusk. They were either in school or on the way to school.\nShen Hui used to complain about his younger brother, but now he doesn’t say anything. The two brothers call home once a week. They have enough tuition and living expenses, so they spend all their time studying.\nHuihua got three extra points in painting and was successfully admitted to the Fine Arts Department of a key provincial university. The school was in the provincial capital, so she lived on campus and came home on weekends.\n“Mom, look what I bought for you.”\n“What rare things have you seen?” Li Xia came out of the house with a smile.\n“Tiger bone ointment is said to be able to treat rheumatic joints. Didn’t you say your legs hurt?”\nLi Xia laughed: “I just caught a cold because I stared at the quilt at night. I got better after warming myself up with hot water. Your mother was applying plasters when I was just a child.”\n“No need.” Huahua felt a little disappointed: “It’s a waste of money again.”\n“Mom will give it to you later.”\n“I feel bad about spending the money, not that I’m short of money. Mom, you’re really rich now, and you give me money all the time.”\n“Isn’t it better to give money?”\n“It is.”\nHer daughter is such a sweet and caring girl; she has so much to say to her. She didn’t feel it when her two sons were at home, but now that they are gone, she feels really empty inside. Fortunately, her daughter is by her side; otherwise, it would be so sad if all three children went abroad at once.\n“Mom, I’ll go shopping with you on the weekend.”\n“OK.”\n“My classmates all say that you are young and like an older sister to me.”\n“That’s because your classmates are giving you a face.”\n“No, it’s just that mom is really young.”\nWith her eldest daughter by her side, the three of them went on a trip together during the holidays. The two little boys on the other side of the ocean were extremely envious and said they wanted to go with everyone when they got home.\n“When they get back, Huihui will be in his twenties, and Yiyi will be around twenty too. At this age, it’s good that they don’t mind us being an eyesore.” Before going to bed at night, the couple chatted, and Li Xia turned around and said, “You said Huihui is getting older, so he won’t find a foreign girlfriend, right?”\nShen Haiyang was silent for a moment. “You don’t like foreign daughters-in-law?”\n“Not really. This is the child’s own life; of course he makes the decision. I’m afraid that if he marries a foreign wife, I won’t be able to communicate with her smoothly with my foreign language skills.”\n“Maybe my daughter-in-law speaks Chinese very well.”\n“Yeah, that can happen too.”\nLying on the bed, fanning herself with a palm leaf fan, they had moved to a villa, and the house was equipped with air conditioners, but they rarely turned them on. They still liked the old-fashioned fans. Shen Haiyang told her about Murong Danling, and she leaned to one side, her mind in turmoil.\n“Zhang Qiuhua was sentenced to four years and eight months, and Murong Danling was sentenced to death. Don’t tell Huihui about this. It’s useless to tell him. She is so bold that so many cases are related to her. If she is punished for multiple crimes, how can there be any good result?”\nLi Xia took out a passbook from the drawer of the bedside table and said, “Look, this was something Murong Danling forced him to take away, and Huihui gave it to me before he went abroad. This child…”\nShen Haiyang took the passbook and said, “She chose her own path, and she has to bear the consequences. Huihui didn’t tell me unless he asked. He would be upset at most if he knew about it later. After so many years, her influence on the child has become smaller and smaller. But Fang Zhongcheng—he seems to have not appeared in the past few years. Did he not look for his son because he knew that Yiyi went abroad?”\n“How can he have the face to do that? He is a complete hypocrite and is very concerned about his reputation. He is in a low period now and will not appear in front of the children. Oh, time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, I am becoming a mother-in-law. In a few years, we will be grandparents.”\nShen Haiyang smiled and laid down too. “It’s okay; don’t be afraid; I’ll be with you until you grow old together.”\nLi Xia looked back at him. In the dark night, there was a little moonlight in the room. His gentle features seemed even softer in the haze. The man took the palm-leaf fan from her hand and fanned her sideways.\nThe two were talking about how Shen Hui was most likely to find a partner first, but when they were shopping at the end of the year, they actually found their daughter shopping with a young man. They were holding hands; the boy was holding a milk tea in his hand and carrying a Huihua’s bag on his shoulder.\nLi Xia took Shen Haiyang and hid behind a pillar to observe the two closely. They entered a women’s clothing store, and the boy picked out an autumn and winter skirt for Huihua. Huihua smiled at him shyly and brightly.\nThe couple watched other people shopping and went down from the third floor to the second floor. Shen Haiyang wanted to follow, but Li Xia stopped him. She pulled him to sit on the bench at the elevator entrance. He looked into space and let out a long breath.\n“Our flowers are about to be taken away with the pots.”\n“Haha!” Li Xia couldn’t help laughing. It’s said that when a girl grows up and looks for a partner, the person she’s most reluctant to part with is her father. It seems to be true.\n“I have to investigate that boy to see if he is worthy of our daughter.”\n“What are you investigating?”\n“Everything from when he was young to when he was young, who his parents are, who else is in his family, where he is from, and what he does. Is he kind or not? Will he be suspected of bullying my daughter in the future? What major did this kid study, what are his future employment prospects, is he a good person, and how does he treat my daughter?”\n“Oh my god, you marry a daughter, and for that, you investigate his ancestors for eighteen generations.”\n“Of course we have to check it out. Marriage is a big deal, especially when you marry a girl. She has to integrate into the family. If the family is unreliable or the man is unreliable, the girl will suffer in the future.”\n“Okay, check it out.”\nWith the convenience of work, it was easy for Shen Haiyang to check who he wanted to find. In just a few days, he had found out everything about the other party.\nXu Zelin: This boy is good-looking, graduated from a key university, and his family is not bad. According to indirect inquiries, his parents are not the kind of sharp and mean people.\n“Do you want to ask your daughter?”\nLi Xia nodded. “I’ll go and test it first.”\nBefore she could speak, Huihua confessed to her that she was in love. The beautiful young girl blushed shyly when she mentioned this, and her eyes were shining with love as she looked at her mother.\n“I met him on the bus. He didn’t have any change, so he borrowed it from me, and then he went to the university to pay me back. He insisted on treating me to a meal, and then…”\n“Are you sure about the relationship?”\nHuihua nodded obediently. She turned 20 this year and was old enough to fall in love. She told her mother about the relationship not long after she confirmed it with that guy. She was very excited and happy, and she wanted to share this feeling of love with her mother.\n“Do you like him very much?”\nHuihua’s face was flushed, but she still nodded firmly. “He is very funny and interesting. I am very happy to be with him.”\n“anything else?”\n“Also, I will miss him a lot.” Huihua’s voice was very low, like the hum of a mosquito. “I am very happy to hear his voice, and I can’t help but laugh.”\nLi Xia stopped talking, a typical symptom of being in love. At this time, the hormones in the human body are secreted vigorously, and emotions outweigh rationality. People who are very sentimental may even have their IQ degraded to the point where they can no longer think. My daughter never mentioned the emotional trauma she suffered in her previous life, but now she is in love. I hope she won’t get hurt.\n“Promise mom. Love yourself more than others.”\nHuihua nodded. “I know. I was carefully raised by my parents. If I don’t love myself, then I will be sorry for my parents’ cultivation.”\n————\n“She is in love. I don’t know why I’m a little afraid of this passionate feeling. I hope she can get married and have children normally, but I’m afraid she will get hurt.”\nShen Haiyang put his arm around her and said, “Not everyone is Fang Zhongcheng.”\n“Yes, I know. The most important thing about marriage is that both parties are happy. If she is like me, she will definitely not say much. We are her solid support.”\n“Our previous house is going to be demolished, and we will have two shops and five residences. We will connect the two houses and renovate them for our daughter to use as her wedding house. We will give her both shops and buy her two cars. In the future, we will have Huihui and Yiyi , and they will be responsible for making money, and our daughter will just spend it.”\n“No, aren’t you being too partial?”\n“If boys are capable, they should earn their own way. It is useless to compete with their sisters.”\nLi Xia smiled and said nothing more. The two had said that they would support the elder sister (the younger sister for Shen Hui) in the future. Shen Hui once mentioned the demolition of the old house and said that after the demolition, all the houses would be given to the Huihua, and he would earn money for his house. The two of them studied electronics, and they would earn money by developing patents in the future, so they really didn’t care about this little property.\nGive her daughter enough confidence and let her freely choose her own life. Li Xia did not interfere much in her daughter’s love affairs and decided to let her develop on her own.\nRaising a daughter is probably like this: looking forward to her growing up but also being afraid that she will meet a bad man when she grows up. Life is full of variables, and the only way is to improve her ability to resist risks.\nThe bright girl was unaware that her parents had prepared a generous dowry for her. She was enjoying her love and youth. She was sitting in the studio, sketching a still life in front of her. When she turned around, she saw the boy’s smiling face through the window.\nXu Zelin graduated from university this year and returned to the provincial capital. He fell in love with her at first sight when he saw her at the bus stop. His heart was pounding, and he blushed and wanted to strike up a conversation with her, but he didn’t dare. When he got on the bus, he threw the coin in his hand into the sewer and mustered up the courage to create an opportunity for himself.\nTranslator’s Note : Yayyy only 2 more Chapters to go !!!

She was sitting in the studio sketching a still life and turned her head to see the boy’s smiling face through the window.\nXu Zelin graduated from university this year and returned to the provincial capital. He fell in love with her at first sight when he saw her at the bus stop. His heart was pounding, and he blushed and wanted to strike up a conversation but didn’t dare. When he got on the bus, he threw the coin in his hand into the sewer and mustered up the courage to create an opportunity for himself.\nHuihua put down the brush and walked out of the classroom. In the sunshine, the eyes of the young boy and girl were full of twinkling lights. Bubbles of joy spread in the sea of hearts, and the best time in life was like a flower blooming temporarily. Going home on weekends, Li Xia could feel the sweetness of her daughter without saying a word.\nWhen she went to bed at night, Shen Haiyang asked her what she had been busy with these days. She replied, “Decorating a house for my daughter.”\n“Have you asked her what she likes?”\n“I did. I connected two large two-bedroom apartments, converted the living room on the east side into a studio, and converted the kitchen and dining room into a cloakroom. This way, she has four rooms and two bathrooms. The dining room and kitchen are both complete, so it will still be spacious when she has children.”\n“I won’t go to work tomorrow; I’ll go help you.”\n“Let’s go over and check the progress and quality and leave the rest to the contractor. I have designed everything, and most of the furniture is custom-made.”\n“There are three more sets. Do you want to install them as well or wait until later?”\n“Let’s put it together.”\nThe other two three-bedroom apartments and one one-bedroom apartment are renovated,renovated, and the larger one is for my two sons to live in, while the smaller one is rented out. As the children grow up, they all need their own space, and it is inconvenient to always stay with their parents. After the old house was demolished, there were two two-bedroom apartments, which are no longer needed and are rented out.\nThe house was almost finished when Li Xia took her daughter to see it. She was so surprised that she couldn’t control her tears. It’s true that no one knows a daughter better than her mother. Her mother knew her preferences completely and decorated the house the way she liked.\n“Mother,”\n“Calm down, calm down. It’s just a house. Don’t get so excited. Your dad said that the two shops outside the building would also be given to you. You can open a studio or rent it out. It’s up to you. Go to the developer with Mom to sign a contract. These will all be your premarital properties in the future.”\n“That won’t work. There are still my brother and Yiyi. I’ve already got the house, so the shops can’t all be given to me.”\n“Just take it if it’s given to you. Your brother and Yiyi both agree on this.”\nWhen they were kids, the older and younger brothers joked that they would earn money for her in the future. Now they are both still in college and have no problem with the demolition of the property. When Li Xia mentioned this on the phone over the weekend, they both said they could give it to her.\nThe little boy who had low self-esteem in a single-parent family when his parents divorced has now grown into a strong man. He has strong abilities and doesn’t care about these trivial things. Moreover, his parents have consciously educated him since he was a child, making him feel that he should take care of his sister. Now he naturally won’t argue with her about these things.\nThe house was transferred to Huihua’s name. The girl liked it very much and cleaned the house after the renovation. She bought a lot of pots and pans for the kitchen. But she never lived here and still went back to her parents’ house on weekends.\nAs she was about to graduate from her senior year, some of her classmates were going to art training institutions, some to design studios, and some to commercial painting. She didn’t want to go to these places, so she came back to discuss it with her parents.\n“I don’t want to engage in commercial painting. I want to learn slowly, experience slowly, and express my thoughts on canvas. I don’t want to be a painter or anything like that. I just want to use a brush to express my heart. But the teacher said that to do this, you have to be able to endure loneliness and boredom, and you may not have any income for many years. I am not afraid of loneliness and boredom; I am.”\nShen Haiyang said, “Just live the way you like. Even if you don’t make money, your parents will support you.”\nLi Xia nodded. “Two thousand per month; Mom will transfer the money to your bank card on time.”\nHuihua smiled shyly. She could actually guess her family’s attitude. Her parents had spent so much money and effort on her over the years; all they wanted was for her to be happy. Now that she hadn’t gotten married yet, they had already prepared everything for her. She had saved so much for her living expenses over the years, and she also had income from two shops, so it was enough even if her mother didn’t give her anything. She just told her father and mother her thoughts.\n“that……”\nShe hesitated, feeling a little embarrassed. Li Xia and her husband looked at each other and guessed what she might say, but neither of them spoke, waiting for her to explain herself.\n“Zelin said he wanted to come visit you two at home.”\nThis was like a kitten’s meow, and she smiled shyly at them. My daughter is grown up now, and it’s time for him to meet her parents when she’s dating. Shen Haiyang said nothing, and Li Xia nodded.\n“Wait for your brother and Yiyi to come back, then bring him to our house to meet us.”\n“Okay.”\nIt was a hot summer day, and she told her parents about her worries. She was so happy that she couldn’t fall asleep for half the night. At 11 o’clock, the phone rang, and she quickly answered it while sitting on the sofa.\n“Hello,”\n“Huihua, have you told your parents?”\n“Yes, I did”\nDid they agree? When can I come over?”\n“My mom said we can all meet up when my brother Hui and Yiyi come back.”\n“Oh, I’m so nervous.”\n“You’re still nervous. I’m the one who’s nervous, okay? I went through the script several times before I could say it.”\n“I’m nervous too. The ugly son-in-law is going to meet his outstanding parents-in-law. I’ve been so nervous these past few days that I haven’t been able to sleep well.”\n“Hehe!” Huihua laughed softly while holding the receiver. Li Xia went downstairs to get something and saw her daughter’s sweet and silly look. She didn’t take anything and quietly returned to the bedroom.\n“Girls can’t be kept at home when they grow up.”\nThis was just a casual remark. She was very open-minded about marrying off her daughter. Her current attitude towards marriage was to let things take their own course. Everyone has to experience their own life. Only after tasting it can one know the ups and downs of life.\nNo one can replace anyone on the road of life. What parents can do is pave the way for their children and be their support. In her previous life, her daughter was inferior and even a little timid. After being hurt in love, she was unwilling to set foot again. She tried her best to persuade her child to start over, but it was unsuccessful. Now that her daughter is so happy, she is happy for her daughter.\nThe next day, they went to work. They thought their daughter was sleeping in, so they didn’t call her. There wasn’t much to do at work, so Li Xia went home early, at noon. When she drove to the door, she saw a handsome young man standing there, and her daughter came out to open the door.\n“Mom,” the expression shows a little girl who was caught by her mother doing something bad, and she was so scared that she didn’t know what to do. Seeing her like this, the young man quickly nodded to Li Xia.\n“Hello, Auntie. I’m Xu Zelin. Huihua is sick, so I’m here to bring her medicine.”\nLi Xia turned to look at her daughter and asked, “Where do you feel uncomfortable? Why don’t you go to the hospital?”\n“It’s just a headache and a runny nose. I think it’s a cold. I will just take some medicine, and it will be fine.”\nWe have medicines at home; what are you two doing? Li Xia looked at her daughter, who blushed and lowered her head, not daring to say a word.\n“Then, Huihua, I’ll give you the medicine. Remember to take it on time.” Xu Zelin handed the bag in his hand to Huihua, then bowed to Li Xia: “Auntie, I’ll leave first and visit you another day.”\nXu Zelin glanced at Huihua and turned away. Li Xia took her daughter home. When Huihua closed the door, she stuck her head out to look around. When she couldn’t see the other person anymore, she went back.\nThey are so inseparable that Li Xia, as a mother, is speechless. It seems that her daughter will get married soon, so will she have a baby soon? She is only in her early 40s. Will she become a grandmother soon? Why do things that I looked forward to in my previous life seem to go by so fast in this life? The time of youth is too fast, and it always slips through our fingers inadvertently.\n“Mom,” Huihua called coquettishly, reaching out to hold her mother’s arm. “I just have a heavy nasal tone, and he heard it and asked me. I said I had medicine at home, but he still bought some and sent it to me, saying that he wanted to see me.”\n“Your brother and Yiyi will be back the day after tomorrow. If it’s okay for you, go to the airport to pick them up.”\n“Yes, I will definitely go. The two of them haven’t come back even during their degree holidays in the past few years. I haven’t seen them for several years. I wonder if Yiyi has grown taller.”\n“You’ve grown taller, haven’t you? Your brother said he was two centimeters taller than him.”\n“Really? Shen Yiyi is actually that much taller than me.”\n“You’re a girl.”\n“The day after tomorrow. The two wanderers will also return home on this day.”\nWhat a coincidence! When she went to the airport to pick up her two sons, the five-star red flag was hung everywhere. Li Xia and Shen Haiyang\nwere staring at the airport exit without blinking; they first saw Shen Hui’s mature figure, and then a flying boy waving at them.\n“Mother,”\nFrom his mouth shape, it can be seen that he is calling for his mother, and he pulls the luggage past his brother and runs ahead. He goes around the railing, puts the suitcase on the ground, and reaches out to hug his mother tightly.\n“Mom, mom, I miss you so much.” Li Xia looked at her tall son and was speechless with excitement. The brat turned around and hugged Shen Haiyang beside him. “Dad, dad, I miss you so much too.”\nWhen Shen Hui came out, the father and son were hugging each other. He put the luggage in his hand and gave his mother a hug. Then he gently hugged his sister and reached out to touch the top of her head.\n“It seems like you have grown taller again.”\n“That’s your illusion, brother. I have never grown up.”\n“Haha,” Shen Hui laughed happily. “Brother thinks you have grown taller and more beautiful.”\nYiyi also came back to his senses from his excitement and looked at his sister from head to toe. “You haven’t grown taller; you seem to have gotten shorter.”\nHuihua raised her hand and hit him: “You stinky Yiyi, you are the one who has grown taller. You have become taller, and yet you say that I am short. You are getting worse and worse.”\nYiyi smiled and let his sister pat him. Then he hugged her tightly in his arms. “Sister, I missed you so much.”\nHuihua’s eyes were also filled with tears. The three children grew up together, and she missed them very much. “You said this three times. You are not sincere at all, brat.”\n“Sister, please don’t be so picky. I’m really excited right now. I have so many sentimental words in my mind, but I can’t say them all. This is the only sentence I can think of.”\n“Ha ha,”\nShen Haiyang smiled as he went to pick up the luggage. He had specially driven a business car to pick them up today. Shen Hui pulled out his own suitcase and looked at his father with a bright smile. The father and son had a reserved feeling, and everything was in their eyes.\nOn the way, they talked about meeting Kevin and Jimmy one by one. “Kevin is going to college this year, and Jimmy is also doing well. Their mother has come out, and I heard that her temper has become much more restrained.”\n“Where’s his father?”\n“No news.”\n“Kevin said that he would consider settling down here if possible after he graduated from college and came back to travel.”\n“Really.”\n“Yes, he is teaching himself Chinese geography and history. He is even more excited than I am when talking about this.”\n“That’s good.”\nIt was unknown whether Shen Yaozong was dead or alive, and the old man never saw him again before he left. But now that their mother had come out, the children were taken care of. Kevin was a good boy, and he is grown up now. With his younger brother being taken care of by him and with their financial support, it wouldn’t have much of an impact even if their mother was unreliable.\n“By the way, sister, what kind of person did you find?”\nAs they asked, Shen Hui turned around to look at his sister. Huihua blushed, but her eyes were filled with joy. “You’ll know when you meet tomorrow night.”\nLi Xia did not book a hotel to welcome the children home but cooked the children’s favorite dishes at home. The two people who had eaten enough Western food said everything was delicious, as if they had just returned from an African refugee camp.\n“Are your living expenses insufficient? Why don’t you say anything? There are Chinatowns and Chinese restaurants abroad too. You can always eat out even if you don’t know how to cook.”\nYiyi swallowed the braised pork in his mouth and said, “Chinese food abroad is not delicious.”\nShen Hui added, “It’s very sweet and tastes weird. I later learned to make simple tomato scrambled eggs and beef stew, but I couldn’t do it when I was busy with my studies.”\nThey raised their hands one by one: “My brother is amazing; he is much better at cooking than me.”\n“Okay, let’s go home. Mom will make whatever you want to eat next time.”\n“Oh yeah. But I think my brother makes really good beef stew.”\n“You’re so greedy.” Shen Hui seemed to be disgusted, but in fact, he went to the kitchen to learn how to cook just because his younger brother complained that the food was not to his liking. He always felt that he was the older brother and took care of him in all aspects of life and study.\nYiyi makes faces at his brother, seemingly naughty, but actually listens to him very much. The brothers are friendly and respectful and follow their elder brother’s lead in everything they do.\nA video about Hong Kong’s return to China was playing on TV. Everyone was reunited with their families, toasting happily to celebrate. After the excitement, they asked the two children to go to bed, but they couldn’t fall asleep due to the jet lag.\nAt night, they stayed in their own rooms to avoid disturbing others.\nTinkering with the computer. When it was almost dawn, the two of them fell asleep. Li Xia got up early in the morning, listened to the noise, and then quietly went downstairs.\nThe two of them slept all day and got up in the evening to dress themselves up from head to toe. Today they were going to meet their future brother-in-law. It was the first time for the son-in-law to come to the family, and the family members took it very seriously.\nThe aunt prepared a very sumptuous dinner, and Xu Zelin also brought a lot of gifts when he came. Maotai, ginseng, donkey-hide gelatin, and various high-end supplements filled their bags.\nWhen he walked in, his left foot almost tripped over his right foot. He quickly steadied himself and nodded to greet his future parents-in-law. “Hello, uncle and aunt. I’m Xu Zelin; I’m 27 years old, and I graduated from Fudan University.”\nShen Haiyang pointed to the sofa opposite him and said, “Sit down, sit down.”\nXu Zelin sat down in response, still very nervous. He didn’t know about his girlfriend’s family before and only talked about it after Huihua graduated this year. Just the fact that her father worked in the procuratorate and her mother was an entrepreneur made him feel very stressed. Her older and younger brothers had just returned from studying abroad. Both were younger than him, but they were already overseas masters.\n“Where do you work now?” Shen Haiyang asked.\n“What are your plans for the future?” Li Xia asked.\n“How much is your monthly salary?” Shen Hui asked.\n“My sister is very pampered. Can you afford to support her?” Yiyi asked.\nXu Zelin’s forehead was sweating. He took a deep breath, looked at his future father-in-law, and answered first. “I work in a foreign-funded enterprise in the provincial capital, in the planning department, which is related to my major. The income is not bad, and I can support my family. I can do all the housework and will not let Huihua and I suffer. The company intends to send me to study abroad. If the two elders agree, I want to marry Huihua first, and then we will go abroad together.”\nThe simple words were logical and answered everyone’s questions. Shen Haiyang was quite satisfied with the first round. This guy looked reliable.\nLi Xia was more concerned about the direct interaction between the two young people. Just now, they asked questions one by one, and Huihua wanted to speak for him anxiously but was stopped by him.\nHe tried to gain the approval of his girlfriend’s family so that his girlfriend would not be caught in the middle. Huihua was anxious to protect him, and he also protected her, not wanting her to be embarrassed.\nLi Xia is very satisfied with this alone. Husband and wife, a lifetime companion. It is not easy to find someone you love and who loves you too. Only when you are together can your life be full of joy and meaning.\n“What do your parents think about this?”\nNo matter how much two people love each other, they cannot ignore their family. If his parents are dissatisfied with Huihua, then this marriage is not a good match. Nowadays, unmarried men put their lovers first, but after getting married, they will pay attention to their parents. They are the parents who gave birth to them and raised them, so it is impossible not to contact them.\n“My parents have no objection and have asked me to find time to bring Huihua home. Also, we should find a time for both parents to meet and discuss marriage matters.”\nLi Xia and her husband looked at each other and understood each other’s intentions without saying anything. They would talk about everything in person, and they would naturally understand what the other party’s parents meant when they met.\nLi Xia stood up and said, “Let’s go; it’s time for dinner.”\n“I’ll help too.”\nXu Zelin quickly stood up and followed his future mother-in-law to work. He was very good at arranging the dishes, carrying the bowls, and placing the chopsticks. He was probably not the kind of person who would just eat when he had food.\n“Can you cook?” Shen Haiyang picked up a piece of pork chop for him and asked casually, as if chatting.\n“Yes. I can cook home-cooked meals. When I was a kid, my parents were busy with work, so I started cooking at a very young age.”\nWell, another advantage. When he saw his future father-in-law’s satisfied expression, he was immediately delighted. His family was strict, and entertaining the new son-in-law made him more nervous than the college entrance examination.\nShen Hui took out some white wine and poured it for him. Xu Zelin stood up modestly. “I’m not very good at drinking. Please forgive me if I get drunk, big brother.”\nHuihua wanted to laugh. How come this man looks so thin-skinned now? Her brother was not as old as him, but he actually called him Big Brother without hesitation.\n“It’s okay. Just sleep at home when you’re drunk.”\nShen Hui is much calmer now, and he doesn’t change his expression when someone older than him calls him brother. The elders poured tea, and the four younger generations held wine. He looked like he was testing his brother-in-law and followed his brother one by one to help him.\nThe first time Xu Zelin came home, he got drunk and was arranged to rest in the guest room at night. Huihua wanted to accompany him, but her mother glared at her, and she quickly went back to her bedroom.\nWhen it was a little late, Huihua went to check up on him.\n“Headache?”\nShe held a flashlight. Xu Zelin looked up and smiled at her, then patted the edge of the bed and asked her to sit down. “Your brother and your younger brother actually took turns getting me drunk.”\nHuihua laughed quietly but said nothing. A grown man can also act like a spoiled child. Then he took a sip of water and said, “If I bully you in the future, these two will kill me, right?”\n“You want to bully me?”\n“I dare not.” He smiled and leaned over to kiss her. “I can’t bear to do that.”\n“Drink the honey water and go to sleep quickly. I’ll call you tomorrow morning.”\nThe man checked the time: “Yeah.”\nThe man came to visit first, and then Huihua went to his home. Li Xia came back and asked carefully, and Huihua smiled and said that everything was fine. “His parents are very nice, and they prepared a rich meal. They cooked all the food I like, and it suits my appetite. They were also very enthusiastic about me and asked me to make an appointment with you to meet and discuss the marriage.”\n“Let’s meet at the new coffee shop on Jianshe Road on the weekend morning.”\n“Okay.”\nAfter they arranged to meet, Shen Hui and Yiyi went to work for the company. They went directly to the R&D department. They had already made some mobile phones during their college years. At this time, Li Xia provided them with complete R&D equipment. The brothers formed a research team with several young people and vowed to make a mobile phone within half a year.\nOn the Huihua side, the parents of both parties met on weekends. They had already known each other’s situation through their children, and the boy’s parents were particularly attentive to them.\nShe arrived at the store early, and when she heard her son say they were coming, she stood up to greet him. After some politeness, they got down to business. The man took the initiative to talk about the various situations.\n“Our family conditions are not comparable to yours, so we can only do our best. The house is ready and has been renovated. The betrothal gifts are in accordance with our local customs. You can choose the three golds, clothes, and other things by yourself. You can buy whatever you like. You decide on the wedding banquet, and we will follow suit. We cannot lower your standards. If you have any other requirements, please tell us, and we can discuss them.”\nLi Xia smiled and shook her head. “I don’t have any requests. I came here today just to meet you. If I really have to ask for anything, I just hope that my daughter can live a good life in the future.”\n“Don’t worry, dear relative. I will definitely treat her as my own daughter.”\nThe in-laws who had just met seemed to have nothing to say. The other party was attentive and good, and Li Xia and Shen Haiyang didn’t say much. Afterwards, the other party sent a betrothal gift according to local customs and bought three golds, and all the necessary etiquette was fulfilled.\nBecause Xu Zelin was going abroad, the wedding was held quickly. The wedding house was ready for Huihua, and she would live here when she returned to China. Shr brought so much dowry that her parents-in-law held her high.\n“I thought you wouldn’t leave, but you ended up going abroad too.”\nLi Xia was a little reluctant to let her daughter go, so Shen Haiyang comforted her: “She will be back soon, in about two or three years.”\n“Apply to continue your studies at the school. You can learn more and kill time. Remember to use contraception. You are still young and in a foreign country. You can have a child when you return.”\n“Okay, I know.”\nAfter their daughter got married and went abroad, the four of them were left at home. The two sons stayed in the laboratory all day, and Li Xia hadn’t seen them for several days.\n“Those two brats are so energetic. When I went to the lab that day, they were so busy that they didn’t have time to talk to me.”\nShen Haiyang was wearing an apron and cooking on the weekend. “When you are in your twenties, you are capable and hardworking.”\n“Huihua is married. Huihui is the same age as her. I don’t know when they will have any news. Boys are not in a hurry to get married, but he doesn’t even have a girlfriend. He spends his best years in the laboratory playing with machines.”\n“As long as he likes it.”\n“I’ll make dumplings for them tomorrow. These two brats don’t even know if they have a good meal every day.”\nBeing a mother means worrying a lot. When raising a child to be 100 years old, you often worry about 99 of them. When the child reaches a certain age, you want him to do things that are appropriate for that age. In high school, she was afraid of premature love, but now she hopes her child can have a rich life.\nThe next day, she got up to make dumplings and went to the lab with her lunch box. When her two sons saw her coming, they ran towards the lunch box in her hand. Yiyi took the chopsticks and handed a pair to his brother. He opened the lunch box, picked up a piece, and stuffed it into his mouth.\n“Mom, the dumplings you make are so delicious.”\nShen Hui nodded.\n“The pork and leek ones taste like grandma’s.”\nLi Xia watched her two sons eat with a smile, which was also a great pleasure for an old mother. Raising a son for a hundred years, worrying for ninety-nine. Shen Hui went back and forth between home and work every day, and Li Xia wondered if she should introduce a girlfriend to her son in the future.\nAs a result, when she was driving that day, she actually saw her son hugging a blonde foreign girl at the gate of the community. Oh no, to be exact, Shen Hui was hugged by the girl.\nShe was startled and stopped the car with her foot on the brakes. After a few seconds, she drove away. As a parent, it is not appropriate to stay too long at this time. Looking through the car window, her son had already pushed the blonde foreign girl away. The two of them were talking to each other, but she couldn’t hear clearly through the car window.\nWhen she got home from work in the afternoon, she found this girl still at the gate of her community. The management here is strict. Is she waiting here because she can’t enter the community?\nShe did not act on her own but went home and called her son. Shen Hui heard the news in the laboratory and sighed: “Mom, I know; I will handle it.”\n“If you have anything to say, talk to the girl nicely.”\n“I know, mom.”\nAfter hanging up the phone, Shen Haiyang came in and told her husband what she saw that morning. “I haven’t heard Huihui mention it, but the girl’s attitude was very enthusiastic. Westerners are very straightforward when expressing their feelings. Huihui was embarrassed and pulled her to the corner.”\n“Girls are chasing after him?”\nThough they know that this is how Westerners express their feelings, they still need time to adapt to this idea. Shen Hui is good-looking and has a good temperament, which is very characteristic of an oriental man. It is normal for girls to like him. He just needs time to adapt, maybe because of having a foreign wife.\nWhen Yiyi came back during dinner, Li Xia asked him if he knew about this. Yiyi quickly asked, “Is she blonde, blue-eyed, and very beautiful?”\n“yes.”\n“We met her at the airport when we returned home.”\n“What?” If they met at the airport when they returned to China, then they just met. Would you come all the way to see each other just after you met?\n“She accidentally bumped into my brother at the airport. Bother said it was okay, but she kept looking for opportunities to talk to her brother before we boarded the plane. She said she fell in love with him at first sight and that he had the unique charm of an oriental man. He had a mysterious oriental feel.”\n“What’s your brother’s attitude?”\n“He feels really disgusted. He has clearly rejected her, but she still keeps coming to him. It makes me feel upset.”\nThe couple looked at each other, and Shen Haiyang shook his head at her. After taking a shower at night, she sat in front of the dressing mirror to do skin care and suddenly found a silver light flashing above her head. She reached out anxiously, but the more anxious she was, the harder it was to find.\n“Shen Haiyang, please help me check if I have any white hair.”\nThe tone was urgent, and Shen Haiyang was so scared that he threw away the book in his hand immediately, but it turned out that she just had white hair. He stood up from the sofa happily and walked slowly.\n“Hurry up, I usually take good care of my hair; how come I have white hair now?”\nShen Haiyang stood beside her, bending down to look at her carefully. There was indeed gray hair among her black hair. Even if it was only one, it was equivalent to a signal. He silently plucked two of her hairs, hid the white hair, and handed the black hair to her.\n“Is it this one?”\nLi Xia took it and looked at it under the light. “Isn’t it black?”\n“You saw it wrong because of the lighting.”\nShe patted her chest and smiled at him. “It turns out I was just dazzled.”\n“You don’t have any white hair, but I have a lot.” He put his head close to hers and said, “Look, there are a lot of white hairs on the temples.”\nThe temple’s hair is gray; it’s true. “Why didn’t I notice it before?”\n“I’ve grown it recently. Besides, my hair is short, so it doesn’t stand out.”\n“It’s okay. I’ll grow them soon too. We’ll grow old together, and neither of us will hate the other.”\nShen Haiyang smiled and helped her blow-dry her hair. The buzzing sound of the hair dryer echoed in the warm space. He was gently stroking her scalp and closing her eyes comfortably.\nAt the dinner table the next morning, Shen Haiyang turned to look at his son. Without his father asking, Shen Hui took the initiative to explain: “Vera is gone. Oh, that yellow-haired foreigner.”\nHis parents and brother all looked unconvinced. He smiled bitterly and said, “Really? I pissed her off.”\n“But how??”\n“Tsk,” Shen Hui waved his hands in disdain. “Why are you everywhere?”\nYiyi shrugged and lowered his head to eat. When Shen Hui turned around, his parents seemed to be very interested. The child spoke in a funny way, not feeling embarrassed. Just think of him as a colorful dress to entertain his parents.\n“I rubbed stinky tofu on my body.”\n“Oh my God,”\nLi Xia exclaimed, Her son’s idea is really to cut off the fire from the bottom. Stinky tofu: many Chinese people can’t stand the smell, won’t eat it, and even avoid it when they see it. You actually smeared it on your body; that fashionable and beautiful girl must be driven away by you.\n“Ha ha,”\nYiyi laughed heartily and gave his brother a thumbs up. Vera was a perfume maker and liked to collect men with different smells. His brother was so conservative that there was no way he would play with her.\n“Mom, a gift for you and my dad.”\nLi Xia took it and said, “What is it? Oh, it’s a plane ticket to Europe.”\n“You said you wanted to go to Rome. Uncle Han said he’s not busy recently, so you can go with my dad. If you have time, you can travel more in Europe. If you don’t have that much time, you can play for a few days and then come back.”\nLi Xia nodded to her son, accepting his kindness. He is still young, a young man in his twenties, and he can handle his own affairs. It is a bit early to worry about children’s marriage nowadays. It is better for boys to marry later, so they are more mature and responsible.\nChildren and grandchildren have their own blessings. Now that they have grown up, parents should relax a little. On Saturday, Shen Haiyang took a leave, and the couple easily carried their luggage and boarded the plane.\nThe sky was blue, the sun was bright, and the scenery and people were different when we got off the plane. After settling in the hotel, the two walked out hand in hand, strolling leisurely in the exotic streets of Rome.\nIn a strange place, with familiar people around, look back at the other person and hold his (her) hand even tighter.\nTHE END \n \n\n",
    "99": "https://moonlightnovel.com/the-ex-wife-of-the-educated-youth-is-reborn/teweyr-c62/\nCHAPTER 62 EXTRA\nDuring the Spring Festival of 1998, Huihua got married and went abroad. There were only four of them left at home. The two naughty boys in their childhood are now quiet and stable, spending their days in the laboratory.\nOn the 30th, Yiyi stood in the living room with a dazed look on his face. When he heard some noise on the stairs, he turned around, and his eyes widened in surprise.\nLi Xia was wearing slippers. Her aunt was on holiday today, so she came down to cook. She glanced at her son and said, “Are you still sleepy? Go to sleep. Your dad and I will prepare the reunion dinner.”\n“My Dad?”\nYiyi was stunned, thinking, “When did you live with Fang Zhongcheng?” The house is so big and nice, and the key is that you are so young. She exudes confidence and elegance, still so neat, but speaks and acts in a calm manner.\n“Yeah. Go to sleep. Your dad will come down after brushing his teeth.”\nAfter she said that, Yiyi refused to leave. How could his mother live with Fang Zhongcheng? Their relationship had been like fire and water for a long time. Because he recognized Fang Zhongcheng as his father, she cut ties with him and chased him away with a broom. She said she no longer wanted a son like him.\nHe was upset that his mother had to work hard while Fang Zhongcheng had it easy, so he accepted Fang Zhongcheng’s apology and compensation. He just didn’t want her to suffer too much. It was obviously their child, but she shouldered everything alone. Why should Fang Zhongcheng not pay anything? He should bear the responsibility of raising the child, and he should compensate even if it was late, right?\nAfter selling the software developed by their team, they made a lot of money. They bought a house in the city and invited his mother and sister to live with them. If he gets married in the future, they will buy another one in the same community, so that it will be convenient to take care of him and he can have his own space. His mother has a bad temper, and she probably won’t get along with his wife in the future, so they have to live separately.\nAs for Fang Zhongcheng, he was too lazy to pay attention to him.\nHow could he make up for the loss of his father’s affection for more than ten years by spending a few bucks? He wanted his money because he wanted his mother to rest early; otherwise, she would have to spend money to support him to go to college, and she would have to work hard from dawn to dusk for several years.\nBut his mother was very angry, even heartbroken, thinking that he had betrayed her. He could not understand his mother’s thoughts and could only vent all his energy into studying and working.\n“Yiyi , what are you staring at?” Shen Haiyang came down from the building. The middle-aged man was elegant and gentle. It was the first time they met, but he felt very close to him. The fatherly love that he could not feel in Fang Zhongcheng seemed to be felt in him.\n“What time did you come back last night? Your brother is still sleeping; you should go to bed quickly too. You two brothers are really busy day and night with the mobile phone. Now the mobile phone has been successfully developed and will be put on the market after a quality inspection next year. You will bring Rainbow to another height. Okay, now you can have a good rest. Go to bed quickly.”\nFrom the simple conversations, one can feel the deep concern and pride in the achievements of his two sons. He never knew what fatherly love was when he was young, but now, standing in front of him, he feels the warmth of a father.\nLi Xia poked her head out from the kitchen: “Son, are you hungry? Mommy cooked wontons; come and have a bowl before going to bed.”\nHis mother was so gentle. It had been a long time since he had seen his mother so warm. He nodded subconsciously and lifted his legs subconsciously. He sat down, and his mother brought him a big bowl of wontons.\nThe young, gentle, and energetic mother called him son so affectionately. He looked at her eagerly and was reluctant to look away. Li Xia reached out and patted his head, smiling brightly.\n“What’s wrong with you today? Why are you still sleepy so early in the morning? Eat quickly, then go to sleep.”\nLi Xia and Shen Haiyang entered the kitchen. He watched his mother busying herself with tears in his eyes. At this time, another person came down from upstairs. He was a young man in his twenties, and I looked at him with the same bewilderment.\nThe two looked at each other without saying anything, their eyes full of judgment. Shen Haiyang saw his eldest son coming down and quickly cooked a bowl for him.\n“Huihui, why are you in a daze? Sit down and eat with your brother.”\nShen Hui looked at his father in surprise, shaking uncontrollably. He had been carrying his father’s photo in his arms for many years. Now he was more mature and elegant, but it was definitely him; there was no mistake. Seeing Shen Haiyang turning around to go into the kitchen, he quickly stepped forward and hugged him.\n“Dad, Dad.”\nShen Haiyang noticed that something was wrong with his son and reached out to pat his trembling back. “What’s wrong? You were fine yesterday. You told dad that the research and development were successful, and you were so excited that you couldn’t sleep. What happened today?”\nShen Hui stepped back, his eyes greedily glued to his father’s mature face.\nShen Haiyang patted his son: “Yes, Dad is here.”\nTears welled up in Shen Hui’s eyes, and Shen Haiyang quickly got him some paper and pulled him to sit on a chair. “What happened?”\nShen Hui shook his head and called out in a dreamy voice, “Dad.”\n“Yes, Dad is here.”\nLi Xia stood at the kitchen door. “What’s wrong with you two today? Are you too tired? Take a rest today and don’t do anything. Mom will call you for a reunion dinner in the evening. Now go and have a good sleep.”\nSleep! Who would want to sleep at this time? The two of them calmed down and sat on their own two sides to eat wontons. After eating, Li Xia came over to collect the bowls and reached out to touch Shen Gui’s forehead.\n“It’s not hot. Tell mom if you feel uncomfortable anywhere.”\n“Mother?”\nThe dream is so beautiful, and it turned out to be so warm. Not only was there a father, but also a mother who loved him so much.\n“This child, is he confused in his sleep or sick? Why don’t we take him to the hospital?”\nShen Hui shook his head and said, “No, it’s okay.”\nSeeing that the two were fine, Li Xia went in to continue cooking and asked them to go back to sleep. The two stood up and walked back to the room where they woke up in the direction of their memory without saying a word.\nTheir rooms were next to each other, so they went up to the second floor one after the other. After entering the room and closing the door, they began to look at the items in the room. The boys’ rooms were relatively simple—nothing special.\nHowever, Shen Hui had the habit of recording things, and he would record various things in his diary every now and then. He picked it up and read it carefully, page by page, and tears flowed down his face unconsciously. Comparing it with the days without his father, it was really miserable.\nHis grandma passed away, and his father passed away. His uncle took care of the funeral, and he was taken in by him to be raised. He thought he was a good man. But Murong Danling came to him not long after, and she told him that she missed him very much and that she was sorry and would make it up to him in the future.\nHis biological mother: after losing his grandmother and father, how could he not yearn for her? She fought a lawsuit with his uncle and got his custody. A lawyer came to see him that day, and he learned that they fought for him because his grandfather would give him money.\nGrandpa was devastated when he heard the news of his grandmother and father’s deaths and was bedridden. He sent someone to take him to the United States to study, saying that he would take care of him. But Murong Danling spoke so passionately about the deep love between mother and son that he chose to stay on the mainland. Grandpa didn’t say anything and sent him money on time.\nHe thought his life with his mother was warm, but it was not like that at all. She spent her days drinking and partying, and after resigning, she ran away from home. He felt like he was living in an ice cellar; his clothes were brand new, but his heart was barren.\nHis strong self-esteem and shame prevented him from asking his grandfather for help. He couldn’t say it. Every time he was asked in the letter whether he was fine, he answered that I was fine and my mother was fine. He studied hard and hoped that one day he could be admitted to a university in the United States, so that he could be with his grandfather.\nIn his second year of high school, his grandfather passed away. The only hope in his life was gone. His grandfather left him an inheritance, and Murong Danling pounced on him like a mosquito trying to suck blood. During the conversation, he learned that she was smuggling, and he refused to sign the application.\nThe money his grandfather left him before he came of age can only be withdrawn under special circumstances, probably just to be prepared for any eventuality. Murong Danling wanted to fake a serious illness, but he refused to cooperate.\nShe was furious and raised her hand to hit him. Just like when he didn’t listen to her when he was a kid. But he was grown up and was no longer the child who could be manipulated by others. During the argument, the fruit knife was stabbed into her abdomen.\nHe accidentally killed his biological mother, and he can’t get over this shadow. When he was interrogated, he said nothing and hoped they would just shoot him.\nThe detention center arranged psychological counseling for him, and slowly he began to speak up, regretting what he had done. He could have chosen to hold her back and call the police, or to be perfunctory with her, get into college, and stay away from her. But he stubbornly chose to confront her head-on. He didn’t explain after the incident and let things develop naturally without saving himself.\nShen Hui walked out with a lot of thoughts in his mind and bumped into Yiyi at the door. The two of them remained silent, looking at the family portrait on the second floor at the same time. Shen Haiyang and Li Xia were sitting happily, with three children standing behind them.\n“Elder Sister.”\nYiyi muttered to himself and then found the family photo album in the drawer. He sat on the sofa and slowly flipped through it, and Shen Hui sat next to him unconsciously.\nThe two saw every moment of happiness in the family of five, and the background of the photos was all over the country. From the beautiful scenery of Suzhou and Hangzhou to the magnificent Himalayas, There are the humanities and nature of the ancient capital, as well as the amazing Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Lake.\nThe two of them watched silently, browsing through the albums one by one, from small to large, as if they were walking through it all. In the evening, the family of four had a reunion dinner, and the two of them looked quite normal.\nWith the Spring Festival Gala and firecrackers, the house was filled with warm laughter. Yiyi raised his glass to toast his mom and dad, and as he looked at his mom’s happy and bright face, his eyes were also filled with warmth.\nShen Hui also toasted, his eyes fixed on the two elders. Thinking of the diary he had read before, he smiled at his father.\nMurong Danling was sentenced to death for smuggling a huge amount of money. Even without his participation, she would still have the same ending: death. He stopped her from using the money left by his grandfather to smuggle, and the ending was the same, so it made no difference whether he participated in this matter or not. He can let it go; it’s not his fault.\nIn a world with a father, he graduated from a world-renowned university, and his character is cheerful and generous. He has a deep affection for his stepmother, and his love for her is clearly revealed in his writing. His stepmother treats him as her own son, and at the critical moment, she risks her life to attack Murong Danling to protect him. He is also loved by his mother. He is also worthy of love.\nOh, and he also had his grandfather to teach him. Being too hard can easily break, while being too soft can easily lead to collapse. One must combine hardness and softness. He had understood this principle long ago, so he would never have ended up in such a situation.\n“Huihui, are you really not feeling well?”\nHis mother’s face was full of worry, and her clear eyes reflected his figure. Listening to her gentle words, it was as if hot spring water flowed through his body, warming his heart.\n“It’s okay. I’m fine.”\nShen Haiyang turned to look at Yiyi . Yiyi was more sensitive to people. He turned his head to meet his eyes and smiled at him subconsciously.\nThis man is good to his mother; you can tell by looking at her state. At this time in his previous life, his mother had already become old and hunched over, but now she is confident and sunny, with an outstanding temperament. She is also the boss of an electronics company, and she is radiant. (in the eyes of her son)\n“Dad,” the word on the tip of his tongue, was much more serious than calling Fang Zhongcheng. Although he didn’t have the other’s memory, this man nourished his mother so well, making her so young and happy, so he was willing to call him dad.\n“What happened to you two today?”\nThe two looked at each other and answered at the same time, “Nothing.”\nThe two children ate obediently, and Shen Haiyang and his wife stopped talking. After dinner, Li Xia sat on the sofa to make tea, and Yiyi followed her. Shen Haiyang went to the kitchen to wash the dishes, and Shen Hui followed closely.\nHe thought his father didn’t notice anything wrong, but as a father, especially Shen Haiyang, who is such a careful person, how could he not notice it?\n“son,”\nShen Haiyang called out softly, and Shen Hui’s eyes suddenly became wet with tears. However, after more than ten hours, he was able to control himself.\n“MIT is a great school.”\nThis was his goal. In a world with his grandfather, father, and stepmother, he should have been a shining star. Knowing that he had another possibility, he would never let them down.\nAfter washing the dishes, they went to the sofa to watch TV. Both children looked very eager for such a time. Li Xia met her son’s eyes again, and she felt that this child was very abnormal today.\n“Shen Ruyi, tell me the truth; have you gotten into trouble?”\nYiyi quickly shook his head and said, “No.”\nHe smiled at his mother, liking her gentle and sunny look. Although it seemed like she was scolding him, in fact, those words made him feel deep care and love. When his mother called him, he realized a deep problem.\nShen Ruyi, their mother, changed their surnames.\nIn a different time and space, his mother still took care of him and his sister without abandoning any of them. But it took some trouble to completely separate them from Fang Zhongcheng.\nAt this moment, he suddenly realized his mother’s hatred, At this moment, he suddenly realized his mother’s hatred, disdain, and disgust for Fang Zhongcheng. No matter how time and space changed, no matter whether his mother’s life was rich or hard, the moment Fang Zhongcheng abandoned her, she was no longer willing to have anything to do with that man.\nHe was wrong. His mother would rather suffer than let him be perfunctory to Fang Zhongcheng. He was raised by his mother, and every move he made touched her heart. How sad she must have felt when she heard him calling Fang Zhongcheng, his father.\nIt’s nothing to chase him away with a broom; his mother should have beaten him up with a stick. He should have gone through the difficulties with his mother, and when he grew up, he should have used the fact that Fang Zhongcheng did not fulfill his obligation to support him and complained to the relevant authorities about changing his surname to Li to attack him. Instead of ignoring his mother’s psychological needs for practical reasons,.\nThe increase in social experience allowed him to immediately understand problems that he did not understand before. Shen Ruyi’s mother must have hated Fang Zhongcheng so much that she changed his surname to Shen. This would have caused a greater blow to Fang Zhongcheng than changing his surname to Li.\n“Mother,”\nLi Xia turned around and waited for a long time, but nothing happened. “Go ahead.”\nYiyi ‘s voice was trembling slightly. “If I do something wrong, will you forgive me?”\n“I told you that you’d gotten into trouble.” Li Xia took a deep breath and said, “Tell me what happened. Don’t be afraid. Even if the sky falls, your parents will support you.”\nYiyi came over and hugged his mother, tears welling up in his eyes. “I was wrong; can you forgive me after you beat me up? Beat me hard; I deserve it. I feel sorry for you, and I am standing up for you.”\nHe spoke in a very low voice, so Li Xia, who was in his arms, heard it. Li Xia was startled by his incoherent words, and she wanted to ask something but couldn’t speak.\n“It’s okay, it’s okay. If you’re wrong, apologize to mom and talk it over nicely.”\n“Well, I will apologize to my mother. I will earn money to buy you an apartment and let you live a happy life.”\n“Good, good boy.”\nAs the New Year’s bell rang, the family went out to set off firecrackers. Groups of fireworks shot up into the sky, illuminating the happy faces of the two brothers.\nShen Hui turned to look at Yiyi and held out his hand to him. “Brother.”\nYiyi also reached out: “Brother.”\nTranslator’s Note:- Anddd its the END !!!!\nFirst :- THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYBODY WHO STICKED THROUGH THE END ON THIS JOURNEY.\nSecond:- DONT FORGET TO LEAVE A REVIEW ABOUT THE STORYLINE FOR THE AUTHOR AND ABOUT THE TRANSLATION FOR ME.
