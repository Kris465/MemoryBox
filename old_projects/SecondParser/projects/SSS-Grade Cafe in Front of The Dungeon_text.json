            "c119": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nSipping my warm caffe latte, I thought to myself.\nWhat should I do, I have nothing to do.\nI\u2019ve cleaned, washed the dishes, restocked, paid the bills, and even organised my phone\u2019s photo album. I guess I\u2019ve been working too hard all this time. The long-awaited free time feels awkward.\n\u201cAsh, there are no customers, let\u2019s take a break.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\nI made cafe mocha and some snacks for Ash, then I tried to find a game to play on my phone.\n\u201cEveryone went too far\u2026.\u201d\nJu Noeul, who was sitting at a table by the window and drinking her coffee, spoke in a low voice.\n\u201cHow can you leave this place and support that fake\u2026.\u201d\nJu Noeul was extremely angry about <Super Buff Coffee>, claiming that it was a fake. She got into a fight while criticising the cafe on the Hunter Channel. As a result, she got banned from the Hunter Channel for a month. Seeing her suffer from Internet community withdrawal, I felt both grateful and sorry for her.\nI hope she gets unbanned soon\u2026\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it either.\u201d\nThese were the words of Ki Yoohyun, who had just arrived at the cafe and ordered a coffee.\n\u201cIt goes without saying that Rieul-ssi\u2019s coffee tastes much better. A lot of people have problems with their sense of taste.\u201d\nSince there were only two customers in the cafe, I naturally heard their voices. Ju Noeul nodded her head and said, \u201cYou must be a customer with great taste.\u201d\n\u201cAh. We met at Christmas.\u201d \nAlthough that Christmas party ended early due to the confusion over the news about <Super Buff Coffee>, which is sad.\n\u201cHunter Ju Noeul also has a fine taste.\u201d\n\u201cI admit it\u2026.\u201d\nA dramatic consensus was formed between the two.\n\u201cHaha, thank you both.\u201d\nIt is inevitable that the number of customers has decreased. Cafes are about location, location, and location. A large chain with uniform services in front of the exit of the downtown subway station versus a private cafe with delicious coffee in the remote residential area? It\u2019s obvious which one will get the most customers.\nIn addition, it is a large four-story cafe in the downtown area where large guilds are concentrated while my cafe is in front of the Dungeon Gate. Given the same buff, people would probably prefer the more accessible one.\nHowever, a few regulars kept coming back to Cafe Rieul and were upset about the current situation.\nOne of them is Kim Jina\u2026.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I went through all the relevant regulations yesterday, but the legal basis for punishing Super Buff Coffee is ambiguous.\u201d\u201cHuck, you looked it all up?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m shocked that there\u2019s a loophole in the regulations like this!\u201d\u201cAhahaha \u2026 it can\u2019t be helped. Thank you for your concern.\u201d\u201cIf I had more power, I could make a regulation to punish those cowardly fake bastards right away! I\u2019m furious!\u201d\u201cYour kind intention is already making me happy enough.\u201d\u201cHmph, now is not the time for this. I need to pass the promotion test and get my hands on the power!\u201d\u201c\u2026.Jina-ssi?\u201d\u201cFor the betterment of the Hunter world\u2026.!\u201d\nThis incident burned her enthusiasm for promotion.\nI packed her a set of Iced americano and butter cookies to relieve her stress. With that kind of enthusiasm, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be promoted soon. I just hope she doesn\u2019t overwork herself.\nAlso, Kwon Jiwoon and Choi Yichan stopped by the cafe together. They said they were on their way to the Dungeon to organise a party to celebrate Choi Yichan\u2019s joining the White Silver Guild.\n\u201cI see. If you\u2019re going to the dungeon, you might as well take out some coffees. What do you want?\u201d\u201cFrom the beginning to the end of the menu\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Kwon Jiwoon?\u201d\u201cTen cups each.\u201d\u201cOppa, if you drink that much, you\u2019ll get addicted to caffeine?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll drink them all and then use the Status Abnormalities Potion.\u201d\u201cWhat? What the hell does that mean \u2026 Yichan-ah, stop Kwon Jiwoon.\u201d\u201cHahaha! Is your brother overdoing it? I\u2019ll keep it moderate. Just five drinks each from the beginning to the end of the menu.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026no.\u201d\nDo you think I\u2019m going to sleep on the street right now?\nI packed both of them with just enough coffee so they wouldn\u2019t get addicted to caffeine.\nIn addition, Lee Chorok sent me a box of Shine Muscat, and \u2026 I worried excessively about this.\nThings turned out this way, but I was fine. I\u2019m not pretending to be okay, I\u2019m really okay. I thought I wanted to help the world with my coffee, but being a popular celebrity cafe owner is not fit for me. I don\u2019t like the fact that every little thing I say on social media gets turned into an article. It\u2019s embarrassing when you go to the supermarket and someone recognises you.\n\u2018I don\u2019t want anyone to know me\u2026.\u2019\nCan\u2019t you just think of me as an NPC that sells coffee?\nWhile I was in this burdensome situation, another buff coffee vendor appeared.\nNow that Super Buff Coffee has opened, I should go back to my original plan and aim for the \u2018Hidden Cafe in front of a Secluded Dungeon Gate\u2018.\nIt would be a win-win for me to have a large chain cafe do the hard work for the Hunters. I\u2019ll leave the passionate business to Super Buff Coffee and stick to my role as a quiet F-class cafe owner.\nI came to this conclusion. However, I had one question.\nI ate the leftover rice cakes from yesterday as a snack and stared at Mieum, whose stomach had bulged.\n\u201c\u2026Waeoong?\u201d\nMieum felt my gaze and raised her ears.\n\u201cWaeung, waeooong (I, it wasn\u2019t just me, Lime ate too)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuuu!\u201d\nYeah, I know. Not that.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I\u2019m the only one who can use the coffee making skill?\u201d\n\u201cWaeuuung\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cOh, my. Did Mieum lie to me? You said it\u2019s amazing that I\u2019m the only one who can use it \u2026 did you just randomly say that?\u201d\n\u201cWaeooolg (That\u2019s not true).\u201d\n\u201cMieum, I trusted you, but \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t trust a cat.\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong, waeooolg (I always tell you the truth, human, on the honor of the Great System)!\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKyagyagyagyag! Gahh (You don\u2019t believe me! That skill is truly unique to you, no other Hunter has the same skill)!\u201d\nI looked at Mieum. Her fur stands on end and she stands on her front paws. In that state, she jumped up and down and punched the air wildly She looks really frustrated.\nJudging from this cat\u2019s frenzied behaviour, Mieum\u2019s words seem to be true. This cat is so bad at acting.\n\u201cKkyuuu! Kkyuu!\u201d\nBeside her, Lime also sided with Mieum. showing off its support with bouncing its body.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll trust you. Then what is Super Buff Coffee? How do they sell buff coffee?\u201d\nMieum, who had put her front paws down again and was sitting on her belly on the floor, shook her head sideways.\n\u201cWaeung, waeoong (I don\u2019t know about that, it\u2019s definitely not a skill, they must be using a different method).\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I get it for now.\u201d\nI stroked Mieum\u2019s rounded chin. She purred, as if she\u2019s happy the suspicions had been resolved.\nIf not a skill, what is it?\nIs there some sort of substance that buffs the coffee? However, mixing a potion wouldn\u2019t mask the bitterness of the potion and it would make it more expensive.\n\u201cHmmm\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who was drinking coffee next to me, spoke to me. The cat meowed all of a sudden and I was lost in thought with complicated expression, so it seems to have bothered him.\nWell, whatever method they use, it\u2019s none of my business. I decided not to think about Super Buff Coffee.\nJu Noeul has just left after throwing up her anger, and Ki Yoohyun is the only other customer in the store now. The timing is good. I talked about what I was originally going to say to Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cDid you get rid of the rifts in Gyeongju?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes. Cheongna is doing a follow-up investigation, but I think it will be over without any major issues.\u201d\n\u201cThe reason why you suddenly went to Gyeongju, is it because a rift broke there before the regression?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun nodded lightly, \u201cA lot of things are already different than they were before the regression, but there are some things that haven\u2019t changed, so I\u2019m glad we were able to stop it with less damage.\u201d\n\u201cEven the Munchkin regressor has a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\u201cHahaha \u2026 Munchkin, I\u2019m not that great.\u201d\nIf anyone else had heard this comment from Ki Yoohyun, they would have called him a deceiver. If he\u2019s not a Munchkin, then who?\n\u201cThere was also a video on the news, is that okay? I mean \u2026 your identity.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t it a secret that Ki Yoohyun is Muwon? He smiled at my concern.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I knew I was being filmed. I knew that my face wasn\u2019t captured, so I left it alone. I was wearing glasses anyway.\u201d\n\u201cGlasses? What\u2019s with the glasses?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun was still wearing the glasses he sometimes wore. They didn\u2019t hide his sharp features in the slightest.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they wouldn\u2019t recognize you just with one pair of glasses.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was weird, but \u2026 this is a very rare item, even if it looks like this.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun explained with a bitter smile. Those ordinary-looking glasses were an item that he specially ordered. They were said to have the effect of making the wearer unrecognisable to others, meaning that even if they saw Ki Yoohyun\u2019s face, they would quickly forget about him.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Noeul-ssi recognise Yoohyun-ssi earlier?\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t recognise me until I spoke to her.\u201d\n\u201cAha.\u201d\nWait, why didn\u2019t it work for me?\nTiling. As soon as I thought so, I got a system notification.\n[*system: the skill that intervenes in your consciousness is currently being invalidated.]\n\u201cAha\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not omnipotent. It just disrupts someone\u2019s consciousness a bit,. Still, it helps when I want to move quietly.\u201d\nClack, the door opened and a new guest came in.\n\u201cHello\u2026.\u201d\nHe was a regular customer who often came to Cafe Rieul. I had a chat with him the other day. His Hunter Channel nickname, \u2018HingHangHong\u2018, which was named after his real name, Kim Hyunghong, was memorable.\nFor your information, he also had a fight over Super Buff Coffee to defend our cafe on the Hunter Channel and his account got banned \u2026 I\u2019m grateful and sorry for that.\nAnyway, HingHangHong came to the counter, oblivious to Ki Yoohyun\u2019s presence, and ordered a drink. The effect of the glasses must have been real, because normally there\u2019s no way people wouldn\u2019t have spotted a man that stands out like that.\nHuh \u2026 but what\u2019s going on? HingHangHong looked very depressed.\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI\u2019m surprised that there\u2019s still new readers who started reading this series from 0 and went on reading marathon \u2026 I hope I didn\u2019t scare you guys with the previous translator notes \u2026 and thank you for all the old readers for still staying with me~\nanyway, prepare yourself to meet a lot of characters in this ARC! I\u2019m excited to finish this because the romance will start blooming after this ARC (ACTUALLY, HOW MANY CHAPTERS THIS HAS BEEN? THERE ARE TWO LEADS ON THE COVER, WHEN I PICKED THIS UP I THOUGHT THIS WILL BE FULL OF ROMANCE BUT 119 CHAPTERS AND THEY\u2019RE NOT EVEN PROPERLY HOLDING HANDS YET??

            "c118": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nI checked the architectural miniature making set box next to it. On the outside it said, \u201cEasy to Make DIY Miniature Sets. Create a Pretty Flower Shop \u2013 Great for Children\u2019s Emotional Development\u201c.\nHow do you remodel a flower shop to become a Demon Castle? \n\u201cWaeolg! This boy, he\u2019s quite talented!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu! Kkyuuu!\u201d\nThe animals in my house jumped up and down in front of the Demon Castle, admiring it. I had just created a mental distance between me and my family.\nA look of anticipation fell on me, expecting praise. I chose my words as best I could.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 well, Ash is great.\u201d\n\u201cHmph, this is nothing!\u201d\nHe added another words with an expectant look on his face, \u201cI can make you another one if you want.\u201d\n\u201cNoooooo, I appreciate the thought.\u201d\nI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t live up to your expectations. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d have wild dreams if I had one of those in my room.\n\u201c\u2026.Cheesh.\u201d Sighing, Ash placed the Demon Castle next to the Christmas tree.\nIn order to cultivate healthy emotions, I have done not only dungeon detox but also labor detox \u2026 I don\u2019t know what else I can detox from to get rid of the darkness in Ash\u2026.\nI have no idea\u2026\u2026.\nHe has very unique tastes, but as long as he\u2019s healthy, I\u2019m good. Huh.\nAnyway.\nWe decorated the cafe for Christmas using the Christmas decorations set. When we finished, this notification window appeared.\n[You have completed the Christmas decoration. The effect of the Christmas decoration set is activated].[Effect: The customer who came into the cafe feels like Christmas. Mood: +20]\nAfter all, everyone was already immersed in the Christmas spirit, so we couldn\u2019t feel the effect. Still, it was nice to see the decorations. \nBy the time everything was ready, it was a little past noon. It was almost time for the guests to arrive.\nCome to think of it, it\u2019s been quite a while since I met Ki Yoohyun. I had heard that he was back from Gyeongju, but I couldn\u2019t meet him. The twins too\u2026.\nIs it because of the Christmas decoration effect? I\u2019m starting to get excited too. I feel like I\u2019m going to hum the carols.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, hello.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\nThe first guests who arrived were a duo of government employees, team leader Kang Hyunwoo and Kim Jina. It\u2019s a shame that they\u2019re still in uniform even though today is a public holiday. Kim Jina explained that they couldn\u2019t make it to the party because of work, but they took a moment to stop by.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come all the way here, so have some hot chocolate.\u201d\nWith a heavy heart, I made them both a cup of Christmas hot chocolate. After taking a sip of the hot chocolate, Kim Jina said with a slightly softer expression, \u201cDrinking this somehow makes me feel like I\u2019m on holiday.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, me too, I\u2019ve never felt like this before.\u201d Team leader Kang Hyunwoo agreed with Kim Jina.\n\u201cThe agenda, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s okay if we don\u2019t finish it today?\u201d\n\u201cWe finished the urgent stuff last week, so there\u2019s room in the schedule.\u201d\nThe officials stare at each other\u2019s faces for a moment before coming to a dramatic agreement.\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t we just call it a day and enjoy Christmas?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\nOh. This \u2018It feels like Christmas\u2018 effect really worked.\nKwon Jiwoon and Choi Yichan came next. While Choi Yichan juggled the animals to the carol beat, I asked Kwon Jiwoon quietly.\n\u201cHave you not been able to get in touch with Uncle yet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. But don\u2019t worry too much. He\u2019s probably off somewhere else getting some fresh air again.\u201d\nIn fact, when Kwon Jiwoon said that, his face was full of worry. It was understandable, as his father, who had just returned from missing, disappeared again. I handed him a cup of hot chocolate. He went to the corner and started putting ornaments on the fir tree. Yes, I heard that moving your hands is a good stress reliever.\n\u201cEonni, Merry Christmas!\u201d\n\u201cYou idiot! I was going to say it first!\u201d\n\u201cYou idiot! Whoever speaks first wins!\u201d\nThe next guests were the twins, Ki Yoohyun, and Grandma Kim Deokyi. The twins wore cute Santa costumes, and they also brought Ash\u2019s shares of costumes.\n\u201cUgh, are you asking me to wear the clothes of a Saint? This is an insult!\u201d\n\u201cWow, you guys are so cute in those outfits. You look great in them!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Heu-heumm. I could wear it for you at least once.\u201d\nI took several photos of the twins and Ash in their Santa costumes. They are really cute.\nGrandma Kim Deokyi had a heated discussion with the public officials about transaction fees for crafted items.\nUmh \u2026 rather than a Christmas party, it seems like everyone is having fun on their own.\nOh well, it\u2019s good if they\u2019re having fun.\nChoi Cedric said he couldn\u2019t come because he spent Christmas with his sister every year. That means now there is only one guest left. When all the guests arrive, I can cut the cake then.\nThinking so, I talked to Ki Yoohyun, \u201cYoohyun-ssi, would you like some hot chocolate?\u201d\n\u201cSure. But why are you looking at me like that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What did I look like?\u201d\n\u201cYou look very curious.\u201d\nI was curious about Ki Yoohyun\u2019s reaction when he was in a Christmas mood. So far, he has a calm appearance, not blending in with the Christmas atmosphere around him, but wouldn\u2019t it be different if he drank this hot chocolate?\nI\u2019m so curious. What it looks like when this man, who always feels like he\u2019s taking a step back, gets excited?\nI was about to hand him the hot chocolate while hiding my ulterior motives.\nBoom!\n\u201cBig deal\u2026!\u201d\nA pale-faced Ju Noeul appeared.\n\u201cNoeul-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nShe was the last person scheduled to attend today\u2019s party. Judging by the red Santa hat on her head, she was on her way to the party.\nBut what does she mean with \u2018big deal\u2018?\n\u201cBig \u2026 big deal \u2026 heufh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHere, have some cold water first.\u201d\n\u201cHeuk, heuuh \u2026 thanks, hu, haa\u2026.\u201d\nJu Noeul took a one-shot of a cup of ice water and caught her breath. She looked like she\u2019d run a long way.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d\n\u201cLook at this\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nJu Noeul handed me her tablet and displayed a certain screen. When I checked the screen at her urging, it was an ordinary blog post.\n\n[New Cafe] HIP NEW HOT SPOT \u2018SUPER BUFF COFFEE\u2019 in Guild Jungangdong Branch\nWriter: Starry\nHello! This is Starry \ud83d\ude42Guild Jungang-dong, where many famous Hunter Guilds are located, is a hot spot these days, right?There\u2019s a new emotional cafe on Guild Street!Let me introduce \u201cSuper Buff Coffee,\u201d a new cafe that\u2019s expected to be a hit. \u266c#GuildJungangdongNewCafe #NewCafe #GuildStreetCafe #SuperBuffCoffee #BuffCoffee\n\nIt was an introduction post of a cafe, with several photos and a detailed description. The sparkling four-storey building along the boulevard was recently opened. The inside of the cafe was also stylish and colourful with a trendy interior.\nThey have a great selection of drinks \u2026 ah, and the desserts and bakery are good too. The cakes look delicious. It was a cafe with a good location, so it was sure to attract a lot of customers.\n\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s wrong with this cafe?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a very nice and colourful cafe, but I didn\u2019t feel a sense of crisis or competition.\nAbsolutely. How many cafes are there in downtown Seoul, no, all over the country? There is no reason to be surprised by other cafe with a different location, size, and target customer base.\nHowever, Ju Noeul beat her chest in frustration.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThis cafe is promoting that drinking their coffee will give you a buff effect\u2026!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\nOnly then did I notice the phrase at the bottom of the blog post.\n\nThe surprising thing is that the coffee of \u2018Super Buff Coffee\u2019 gives a buff effect to Hunters!From restoring your health to increasing your status to removing abnormal conditions\u266cYou can get various and powerful buffs \ud83d\ude42There are many more types of coffee than the menus in Cafe Rieul, which is famous for its buff coffee, so you can freely choose your favourite.It\u2019s located in the downtown area, so it\u2019s great for busy Hunters ^0^Recommended for Hunters who had a hard time queuing up at Cafe Rieul!Super Buff Coffee is planning to open the Hunter Market, Dungeon Management Office, Guild Crossing, and Yeouido Hunter TV branches soon \ud83d\ude42Starry\u2019s recommended menu is Einspanner!You should try it.\u266c\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cAt this rate, you\u2019re going to lose your customers\u2026.!\u201d\n\u201cOh my\u2026..\u201d\nIt was a shocking Christmas.\n***\nPage Eleven: Let\u2019s Use the Genuine Product\n\nKorea\u2019s No. 1 Hunter Community \u2013 Hunter Channel.\nFree Forum Board.\n\u2014 Ranking, The Slave Hunters Guild is banned.

The stores are all located in downtown Seoul with easy access for Hunters. In addition, large stores with parking lots, stylish interiors, long business hours, and active SNS with their viral marketing, etc \u2026 in an instant, Super Buff Coffee became a hit.\nTherefore, it was natural that the number of customers in Cafe Rieul was decreasing.\nJanuary 2nd. The first business day after the Lunar New Year holiday, the year when I turned 24 years old. Outside the window is a dungeon view with only a cold wind blowing. There\u2019s no shadow of a customer in sight.\nThis is how my celebrity life, where even the smallest photo on Instagram could be turned into an article, came to an end.\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nSorry for keep disappearing sahkjddjhdsh things are, eh, kind of bad lately.

            "c117": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cI heard you don\u2019t go home these days.\u201d\nLee Sein spoke to Choi Cedric. Her gaze was soft, as if she was worried about him.\n\u201cYeah, well. I just don\u2019t.\u201d\nChoi Cedric replied, trying to shake off the frightening image that had just flashed through his mind.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like where you live? Do you want me to find you somewhere else?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. The house is nice.\u201d\nChoi Cedric lived alone in a luxury apartment along the Han River owned by C&L Corporation. It is known for its panoramic view from the living room window, lavish interiors, and tight security optimised for celebrities.\nIt\u2019s a house anyone would envy, but there\u2019s a simple reason why Choi Cedric hasn\u2019t been home much lately: it\u2019s a place where Lee Sein\u2019s eyes can reach. Since it is owned by C&L Corporation and that place is his residence, it is natural for Lee Sein to manage it. However, from some point on, her intervention has been unwelcome and unbearable.\nSince when was it? Ah, it was after her secretary disappeared. The uncomfortable feeling has grown to the point where he feels more comfortable in a dungeon with an Eternal Flame than at home.\nSo no matter where he moves, the situation is the same.\n\u201cReally? Then, should we remodel it? While the CEO\u2019s office is also under construction, it would be refreshing to freshen everything completely.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe another time. It\u2019s still a bit of a mess.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026All right.\u201d\nWith a bright smile, Lee Sein gave some instructions to the employees. As if to prove the absurdity of the reluctance he\u2019d felt earlier, that figure was exactly Lee Sein whom Choi Cedric knew.\nAn ambitious yet sensible person who was willing to be a family of Choi Cedric and Choi Rona.\n\u201cWe only have one family. You should try what you can so that you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d\nAgain, the conversation he had with Kwon Rieul came to mind. It was something Choi Cedric had once said to her. He said that in such a smug way, but he himself had forgotten that words.\nHe can\u2019t rely on others. He has to figure out what\u2019s going on around him on his own.\n\u201c\u2026Cedric?\u201d\n\u201cI just stopped by while passing by. I know CEO-nim is busy, so I\u2019m going to go now.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. You\u2019re going to see Rona, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nDespite his words, when Choi Cedric left the representative\u2019s office, it wasn\u2019t to visit Rona\u2019s hospital room.\nOne floor down from the top floor, around the corner, in the innermost room. It was the office used by the secretary, Aeon, before he disappeared. They had already retrieved anything that might be evidence, but he was still hoping to obtain some information.\nIn Aeon\u2019s office, two employees were tearing down a partition.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cAh! Oh, Hunter Choi Cedric-nim.\u201d\nThe employees dropped the partition on the floor and turned around. A brief moment of embarrassment flashed across their faces. However, Choi Cedric didn\u2019t seem to care, and asked again what they were doing.\n\u201cCEO Lee Sein-nim said that this office is being demolished, so we were in the process of cleaning it up.\u201d\n\u201cReally? It\u2019s different from what she told me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe employees looked surprised.\n\u201cShe told me to keep it as it is in case there is evidence that we haven\u2019t found yet.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nConfused glances met in the air. Lee Sein is a strict about rewards and punishments. If there is confusion in the instructions and it is known that they tampered with the office, they will be greatly reprimanded.\nChoi Cedric, who had lied so casually, jerked his head and pointed out the door.\n\u201cLeave it.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Wait a second. About this.\u201d\nNow we\u2019re in trouble. Who said the wrong thing? Choi Cedric called back the employees who were trying to rush out while muttering such complaints.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better not to report this to the CEO for now. She\u2019s a little sensitive about the construction today.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a look of hesitation on their faces. According to the ethics, it was necessary to report the confusion of the instructions immediately and reconfirm the contents. However, it would have been a pain in the arse to go report to her while she was in a sensitive state.\nChoi Cedric eased their worries with a refreshing smile.\n\u201cI\u2019ll put in a good word for you later.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.! If you do, we\u2019ll be grateful.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cGo.\u201d\nOnly when they were completely gone and he couldn\u2019t hear their footsteps did he enter the office. He closed the door behind him and looked around.\nThe office was empty, however, as all incriminating items had been removed.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nWhile looking around, something got stuck in his foot. Looking down, it was a small star-shaped ornament. Is it a keyring?\nChoi Cedric moved his gaze towards the direction it had rolled. It\u2019s nothing but a blank wall. No, when he looked closely, there were fine lines drawn on the wall.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHe tapped on it and there was a sound from the inside. It was obviously hollow.\nChoi Cedric drew his sword and thrust it into the gap in the wall. He gave it a good twist and the outer panel came off without difficulty. Beyond the wall was a tiny space, barely big enough for a child to squeeze through. There was nothing to indicate that Aeon had touched it just before he disappeared.\nAll that remained was a photograph.\nIt looked like it had been taken a long time ago. It must have been not long after the founding of C&L. Lee Sein was smiling awkwardly at the camera. Beside her was her secretary, Aeon\u2026..\n\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d\nSuddenly, his head hurt. Choi Cedric stumbled and groaned, holding his head. The photo fell out of his hand and onto the floor.\nThe headache quickly subsided. Choi Cedric wiped the sweat from his brow with his hand and picked up the photo.\nIt looked like it had been taken a long time ago. It must have been not long after the founding of C&L. Lee Sein was smiling awkwardly at the camera. It\u2019s a self-portrait of Lee Sein.\nHe felt like he forgot something. What is it? He couldn\u2019t remember.\nA small note was written on the back of the photo. The content is\u2026.\n\u201cGrimoire\u2026.?\u201d\n***\nCafe sales were booming every day, and unintentionally I became quite famous.\nI\u2019m embarrassed to say it, but to my surprise, yesterday I was approached by someone who wanted to make a biography for children with me as a model.\n\u201cThank you for the offer, but I refuse.\u201d\u201cHunter Kwon Rieul-nim, please reconsider. So that children growing up can look up to you, Hunter-nim\u2026.!\u201d\u201c\u2026.don\u2019t say such scary things.\u201d\nWhy do children need to look up to me? I understand you\u2019re looking for fresh items, but isn\u2019t that too much?\nThe next regularly scheduled holiday, which had finally arrived, happened to be Christmas Day. I decided to throw a Christmas party since it\u2019s been a while. Even if it\u2019s called a party, all I planned was to do was invite acquaintances and have some snacks. I\u2019m tired of the unintentional celebrity life, so I should spend time like this sometimes.\nMost of the people I invited said they\u2019d be there, but I didn\u2019t hear back from my Uncle. Not only that, but he didn\u2019t even read the message on KakaoTalk.\nI thought he\u2019d be happy because he was dressed as Santa and handing out gifts\u2026.\nI asked Kwon Jiwoon, but he said he hadn\u2019t even met his father. He said he would search his whereabouts just in case. Judging by the lack of updates on YouTube, I don\u2019t think he went to the mountains again. \nI left him a message asking him to come to the party, even if it was late, and started preparing for the party.\n[Dimensional Shop \u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605 Christmas Special Sale \u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606\u00a7Loyal Customers\u00a7 Exclusive \u261eSpecial/Star/Ser/Vi/Ce \u261cThis is a special sale only for The Eligible customers who have been loyal to us.Christmas Party Set (including Christmas decoration set and Christmas recipe): \u2606\u2605Special Discount Price\u2605\u2606 50 Rubies\u203b Note: If you turn off this window now, you will never be able to purchase it again.]\nAck, my eyes hurt\u2026.\nThe Dimensional Shop was tactfully displaying such items. I could feel their intent to take my hard-earned rubies back from me, but I bought it with great enthusiasm anyway. I\u2019ve worked hard to earn them, so I should feel good about spending them like this.\n\u201cNyaaa, nyaaa (Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyu, kkyu, kkyu!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Bells.\u201d\nIt\u2019s\u00a0okay\u00a0because\u00a0my\u00a0family\u00a0is\u00a0enjoying\u00a0it\u00a0too.\n[You have acquired a new recipe \u2018Christmas Hot Chocolate\u2019.][You have acquired a new recipe \u2018Christmas Cake\u2019.][You have received the purchased Christmas Party Set in your inventory.]\nFirst, I decided to make hot chocolate.\nIn the mug, I put plenty of Chocolate Sauce from Hell. I poured in the heated milk, let it melt, and then topped it with soft milk foam. In the end, I decorated it with marshmallows and finely chopped chocolate, and it looked pretty good.\n[Item: Christmas Hot Chocolate (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 01:00:00)Effect: It makes you feel like Christmas.]\nUh\u2026.?\nIndeed, after the Christmas season passed, it would be a meaningless effect.\nNext, we made a Christmas cake together. The sponge cake was topped with whipped cream strawberries to make it look delicious.\n[The condition has been met.Combo bonus will be generated.Combo: Christmas Party Set (Christmas Hot Chocolate, Christmas Cake)Effect: It makes you incredibly feel like Christmas.]\nThe cake was kept in the fridge, and we all enjoyed some hot chocolate as a tasting before the guests arrived.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nHowever, I didn\u2019t notice any special effects. The hot chocolate, with its savoury milk and rich, sweet chocolate flavour, is very delicious, but that\u2019s all.\n\u201cNyaa, nyaaa, nya (Look out the window, look out the window)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyu, kkyu, kkyu!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nAha. I was already in the Christmas spirit before I even drank my hot chocolate, so I didn\u2019t feel the effect.\nThe final step was to decorate the cafe for Christmas. I took out a little light bulb from the decoration set I bought at the Dimensional Shop earlier. I thought it would be pretty if I put it on the wall of the store.\nBut then Ash looked in my direction as if he had something to say.\n\u201cHey, you know.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t call me \u2018Noona\u2018 these days. He was cute back then.\n\u201cAsh, what\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI have one of those too. Something to decorate the cafe.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so? Ah, the miniature one?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Yeah.\u201d\nHe put on a sulky face to hide his shyness, but I could tell he was proud.\n\u201cThen let\u2019s decorate the cafe with the ones Ash made. Hurry up and bring it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.! Okay.\u201d\nHe ran off to his room. When he returned, he held a \u2026 demon castle in his hand.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nAm I not fully awake? I saw something weird.\nI rubbed my eyes and looked again, but there was still an unbelievable sight in front of me.\nThe part-timer of my house placed a miniature of a castle with a proud expression on his face.\n\u201cAsh \u2026 what is this?\u201d\n\u201cThe palace where the Primordial Chaos dwells, the Throne of Darkness.\u201d\nIt even had a Gothic spires and a miniature dog with three heads on the wall. Ugh, it\u2019s a perfect miniature of a demonic castle that feels too realistic.\nAs I averted my gaze to avoid eye contact with the three-headed dog miniature, I had a sudden realisation.\nWait, I think I\u2019ve seen this before.

            "c116": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThen the only problem left is deciding what a reasonable menu price is\u2026.\n\u201cEh, but isn\u2019t this too expensive?\u201d\n\u201cNo, this is still considered cheap.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Considering the buff, it should be about this price.\u201d\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t raise it ten times the previous price. I\u2019ll lower it a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, then like this\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\nI sat down with the healer and the pharmacist and worked out a price list for the drinks. It took quite a while as we took into account a number of factors.\n\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d\nAsh, who returned from the warehouse, asked me. In his arms were hardboards, stationery supplies, and various craft materials tall as he was.\nI was concerned about what he\u2019s trying to make with such a large amount. Well, I suppose it\u2019ll be okay because it\u2019s only architectural miniatures.\n\u201cOh, I have something to do. Ash, sleep first.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Okay.\u201d\nAsh went into his room, and after a long conversation with the healer and the pharmacist, I made a reasonable new price list.\nBut then I had a sudden suspicion.\n\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019m not going to be punished for collusion or something like that, am I?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nThe healer declared confidently.\n\u201cThere are only two ways a Production Hunter can be punished for collusion: if they use their superior position to force abnormally high prices, or if they charge more than twenty percent above the standard price. There\u2019s no legal problem, and this is still cheap.\u201d\nThe pharmacist handed out the data.\nThere was such a thing as a standard price list. The law was quite well established.\nAs soon as I set the new menu prices, a system notification popped up.\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Sub Quest: Decorate the Menu Board\u2019.Please collect the rewards.][The entry for \u2018Throne of Darkness\u2019 has been added to the Ether-Wiki].\nFor some reason, just looking at the name of the updated item gave off an ominous feeling.\nI read it with an uneasy feeling, but it seemed to have nothing to do with me right away as it was a description of a place. \nWas I too suspicious of the system?\n[The system always puts your safety first.]\nI don\u2019t believe it more if you say that, but \u2026 I just turned off the Ether-Wiki.\n\u201cThen, I\u2019m sorry to bother you at such a late hour.\u201d\n\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll visit you as a guest.\u201d\nSatisfied with the arrangement, the two left.\nIt was a decision I was happy with, but I wondered if anyone would complain if I suddenly raised the price of coffee?\nSurprisingly, none complained.\n***\nThe next morning.\nIt was time to change the television channel over breakfast. I turned on the channel of the drama that Mieum wanted to watch, but suddenly a breaking news came out.\n\u201cKyaaaaolg! What is this all of sudden? Where is the next episode of Hunter\u2019s Temptation!\u201d\nEven if you complain, there\u2019s nothing we can do with breaking news. Soon, a news video appeared with large caption.\n0 Deaths from Gyeongju Rift \u2026 Safely Closed Confirmed\nThe news screen showed a street with completely collapsed buildings. However, everyone have bright faces. It must be thanks to the good news that there were zero deaths.\nA reporter came closer to interview a Hunter, who participated\u00a0in disposing of the rift.\nSince he just returned, the Hunter was still lightly wounded, but he exclaimed in an excited tone as if his wounds were nothing.\n\u2014 Muwon! Muwon showed up!\u2014 \u2026\u2026.!\nThe scene erupts in excitement.\nAfter a while, the screen turned into a news studio, and the announcer said with a flushed look.\n\u2014 Right now, we have a video sent by a viewer that the No. 1 Ranker, Muwon, has appeared at the scene of the rift in Gyeongju. We obtained it exclusively from Hunter TV. It\u2019s an exclusive report, viewers. We\u2019ll show you the footage right away.\nThe picture quality was low, with the screen jiggled\u00a0as\u00a0if\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0covered\u00a0with\u00a0sand. It seemed to be filmed inside a rift. Although it was blurry, it was enough to know what the situation was.\nAs\u00a0the\u00a0rift\u00a0broke\u00a0out,\u00a0there\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0lot\u00a0of\u00a0debris\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0building\u00a0that\u00a0was\u00a0sucked\u00a0in. Beyond that, you can see a group of monsters aiming for the Hunters. The dispatched party fought well, but the sheer number of monsters meant that the formation would soon be broken.\nThen, a black shadow appeared.\nThe\u00a0face\u00a0is\u00a0not visible.\nIt was blurry, but I recognised him immediately. That long body, that distinctive gait.\nKi Yoohyun.\n\u2014 Who is that? It can\u2019t be\u2026..!\nStepping forward, he stretched out his hand. Soon, a dense net of light seemed to surround the area, and an explosion roared with a flash.\nThe claws that were about to tear into the Hunter of the vanguard shattered.\nOne by one, the monsters that had been pouring out fell, literally fading into the light. It took only a few minutes for all monsters to completely die.\nIt\u2019s an overwhelming power.\nWhy does the video, where you can\u2019t see his face and only the blurred figure, feels both wondrous and lonely?\nIs it just an afterimage caused by Ki Yoohyun\u2019s past video I saw last time?\n\u2014 Whoooaaaaaaa!\nAlong with the cheers of the videographer, the screen shook greatly.\n\u2014 We\u2019re alive!\u2014 Thank you!\nHe turned his head towards the camera, as if he\u2019d just spotted it.\nJust before the shadow cast by the rubble of the building is lifted and the light shines on his face, the hem of his long coat flutters in the wind.\nThe next moment, he disappeared and the video ended. The news again led to an on-the-spot interviews.\n\u2014 Without Muwon, it wouldn\u2019t have ended without any harm. Keuheuk\u2026.! \u2018d like to take this opportunity to thank him!\nHe told me that I won\u2019t be able to contact him for a few days, so he must have known in advance that a rift would burst in Gyeongju. Did he change the future by blocking the rift alone?\nIn his own way, he\u2019s working hard as a Munchkin Regressor.\nI\u2019ll have to do my part too.\nThinking so, I tried to turn off the television, but on-site interviews continued.\n\u2014 Ah! And thank you for Cafe Rieul!\nHuh? Suddenly?\n\u2014 The first Healer that we deployed was caught in an abnormal condition and we almost died. They  actively helped in such a crisis situation. If it wasn\u2019t for their coffee, we wouldn\u2019t have lasted until the Healer recovered.\nAh. When I heard that, I remembered what happened.\nYesterday, group of people who seemed to be in a hurry appeared through the ConnectAnywhere\u2606MysteriousDoor.\nIt wasn\u2019t a normal situation even at first glance, so I stopped the business for a while and made them coffee until they were ready to go.\n\u2014 I see, Hunter-nim, you\u2019ve done a great job. If you have any last words, I\u2019d like to hear them.\u2014 I\u2019m worried about the low price of the coffee. I\u2019m hoping that such a good place will raise their prices!\nPardon?\nEh, that far?\nAs I live, I see consumers worrying about the low price.\nPerhaps because it was said in a live breaking news, the price increase was warmly welcomed rather than resisted.\nWell, regardless of the price increase.\n\u2018You were determined to benefit the world with coffee\u2018.\nIt feels a bit grandiose, but \u2026 does the coffee I make help the world in this way? If so, I\u2019m glad.\nI\u2019m glad no one died in the rift.\nTruly.\n***\nOne more thing happened.\nA few days after the price-changed menu was settled without difficulty, the healer and the pharmacist visited as guests as they promised.\nJudging from the fact that both of them ordered cafe latte without hesitation, it seems that they wanted to drink it that day\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cKeheum, ahem. Owner-nim.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\nIt was after the two drank all the cafe latte, filling the satisfaction bar to the end. The healer who had been watching me from earlier, as if he had something to say, opened his mouth.\n\u201cLook at this.\u201d\nThe healer held out his phone. The phone screen showed a white rabbit chewing on cabbage leaves. It\u2019s pretty cute.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my rabbit. She eats well, healthy, and really cute.\u201d\nAha. Back then this person actually wanted to brag about his pet too\u2026.\n\u201cWaeooong (Post my picture too)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyu!\u201d\nThe animals on my house, who recently dreaming of becoming social media stars, interfered at my feet. I calmed the animals down and immediately followed the healer\u2019s Instagram. The number of Instagram followings with such cute animal photos has increased.\nAnd while seeing off the healer and the pharmacist, I suddenly remembered.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nBeside me, Ash tilted his head.\n\u201cOh, it was him!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nI remembered where I met that healer. He\u2019s the healer who had accused Choi Cedric of power abuse before the regression!\nDue to that incident, The Garden of Blessings had boycotted the C&L Corporation, leading to their subsequent merger.\nI hadn\u2019t remembered it because it had nothing to do with me, but now I know for sure.\n\u2018Choi Cedric, is he okay?\u2019\nOf course, it is not for me to intervene if Choi Cedric actually abused his power or acted inappropriately. It would be best if he apologised and made amends, but it\u2019s his own responsibility anyway.\n\u2018Personally, I wish Choi Cedric would apologize.\u2026.\u2019\nI remembered him looking depressed and troubled when I met him in the Dungeon where Cthugha lived. \nHmm. I wonder what happened to him. Is he doing well?\n***\nChoi Cedric recalled what had happened so far.\nThe allegations of various illegal acts at C&L Corporation had been revealed to be the doings of the CEO\u2019s secretary, Aeon. Lee Sein issued an apology for failing to properly manage and supervise the secretary\u2019s behavior. She also added that she would actively cooperate with the arrest of her secretary.\nHowever, the secretary disappeared as if he had never existed in the first place.\nIn the end, the case was closed with the C&L Corporation paying considerable compensation.\nThe headquarters must have calculated that C&L, the largest of The Big Three, could not be pressured blindly. The decision was made in consideration of the gap in the dungeon raids, the conflict between each guild, and other variables. \nAnyway, C&L is back to normal.\nThe elevator stopped at the top floor, and Choi Cedric strode inward.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d\n\u201cAh, Cedric.\u201d\nLee Sein spotted him and smiled brightly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re renovating the representative office. It\u2019s been a mess for a while after what Aeon did, and I thought we should freshen things up a bit.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\nThe person in front of him is definitely the Lee Sein he knows.\nC&L is back to normal. He, too, should be back to his usual self\u2026..\nBut why does he feel so out of place?\n\u201cThen, isn\u2019t it like being possessed?\u201d\nAll of sudden, Kwon Rieul\u2019s flashed through his mind.\nWhat nonsense is that? There\u2019s no way such a ridiculous thing would happen.\n\u2026\u2026It can\u2019t happen, it won\u2019t happen.\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nsomeone get Choi Cedric out of that place before something happened sjddhsajkhfhsfh\nOh, and I picked up a new series!

            "c115": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the drink you ordered.\u201d\nAs I handed the take-out cup to the customer and turned my head, I got startled.\n\u2018WE CONDEMN CAFE RIEUL\u2019\nA large banner stole my attention.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThere\u2019s a banner like that right across from the cafe, in a good view from the counter, so what can I say?\nIt makes me look back at my life.\n\u2018Have I been living in the wrong way?\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve been living a good life, without even jaywalking once.\nI was a little lazy after the regression, but anyone would do the same if they\u2019re walking on my shoes. Only people who work full-time and overtime during the weekdays, and still able to go to the gym at 5 a.m. on Saturday, can blame me, shit.\n\u201cWaeuung (You speak so proudly).\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nI did recycling yesterday, washed my hands, and renewed my certificate. What\u2019s the problem?\nHeck, I almost looked back in the past, fruitlessly searching for something to reflect on.\n\u201cAsh, wait a minute.\u201d\nUnable to withstand the banner\u2019s self-reflection-inducing effect, I approached the banner. I need to know why they\u2019re condemning Cafe Rieul here.\nHowever, there was no group name or reason written on the banner. All it said was, \u2018We condemn Cafe Rieul\u2018.\nShashashak.\nAs I approached, there was a sign of someone running from behind the banner. He hid in the corner of the alley and looked this way, but said nothing.\n\u201cHey, if you have something to say, go ahead.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you put this up?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThere was no answer. I guess I have no choice.\nI calmly turned on my phone and reported the illegal banner. Before long, a person from the district office collected the banners.\nPhew, I think I\u2019ll live.\n\nLater that evening, after the cafe was closed.\n\u201cCan I see the warehouse?\u201d\nAs soon as I took off my apron, Ash asked.\n\u201cSure, but why? What do you need?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m running low on building materials.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, just go.\u201d\nAsh has been obsessed with making architectural miniatures these days. However, he was not satisfied with making it according to the instructions of the miniature set and started to remodel the building himself.\nI don\u2019t know what on earth he\u2019s making because he haven\u2019t shown it to me yet.\nIn any case, a proper hobby is welcome as it helps prevent the terrible workaholic disease. Labour detox is important.\nAfter sending Ash to the warehouse, I cleaned the hall with \u2018The Floor is Shiny\u2018 skill.\nWhen I switched off the light at the entrance and was ready to rest, suddenly there was a knock and the door opened.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re already closed for today.\u201d\n\u201cI want to meet the owner of Cafe Rieul.\u201d\nA strange man and woman stood at the door. They looked serious as if they knocked on the door with great determination.\nI could easily guess who they were. Under their coats, they wore T-shirts with \u2018We condemn Cafe Rieul\u2018 written on it.\nAha, they\u2019re the ones who set up the illegal banner.\nI hesitated for a moment, but then offered them a seat, figuring I\u2019d at least hear their story about why they\u2019d put up such a banner.\n\u201cAnyway, since you\u2019ve come all the way here \u2026 can I get you something to drink?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nI said so out of courtesy, but the two looked surprised. There is a clear sense of wariness on their faces.\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t take what the enemy gives you.\u201d\n\u201cEnemy?\u201d\nThe woman calmed the man down and answered in his stead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just give us, uh, some cold water please.\u201d\nIf you say so\u2026.\nI gave them two glasses of ice water and made my own hot caffe latte.\nThe savory smell spread through the air. The soft and savory taste of coffee restored the energy that had been drained throughout the day.\nTheir eyes focused on my coffee cup.\nThey looked like they wanted to drink it\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cWould you like some?\u201d\n\u201cA-ahem! No.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026it\u2019s all right.\u201d\nWell, if you refuse\u2026.\nI took another sip of my caffe latte and asked.\n\u201cSo, what is the reason for setting up such a banner in front of someone else\u2019s store?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\nAfter exchanging a quick glance, the two introduced themselves. \nThe man was a healer from the Garden of Blessings, a guild specialising in Healers. He had circles under his eyes and looked tired. Meanwhile, the woman was a potion pharmacist and the head of the Central Pharmacy Guild, which belonged to the Potion Making Alliance. She had a long, flowing hair and an air of intelligence around her.\nAs for the man, I feel like I\u2019ve seen him before. Hmm \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Since I can\u2019t remember him, it\u2019s probably nothing.\n\u201cWhat kind of bussiness a healer and a pharmacist might have with my cafe?\u201d\n\u201cUgh! Aren\u2019t you going too far?!\u201d\nThe healer snapped.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t know. The drinks here at Cafe Rieul!\u201d\n\u201cThe drinks?\u201d\nI blinked in confusion. The healer pounded on his chest and exclaimed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too cheap!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\nAfter calming the angry healer, the pharmacist added a calm explanation.\nIn short, the drinks at Cafe Rieul were so much cheaper than healers\u2019 fees and potion prices that they were driving customers away.\n\u201cThat Cafe Latte has the effect of restoring 50% of your energy. How much are you selling it for?\u201d\n\u201cTwo rubies.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cOh my God, this is\u2026..\u201d\nThey both sighed and put their hands on their foreheads. I spoke up, hoping to comfort them.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s coffee, after all. It\u2019s not like we can drink it indefinitely \u2026 aren\u2019t there a lot of Hunters looking for healers and potions?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. Look at this. There\u2019s stuff like this circulating in Hunchan.\u201d\nThe grim-faced pharmacist pulled a piece of paper from her coat pocket and held it out. It was a printed copy of the writings from Hunter Channel.\nAt her urging, I looked at the paper.\n\n[Humor] Potion vs Cafe Rieul Comparison (233)\nUpvotes: 227 / Downvotes: 2\n\nWriter: RubyCopyBug\nDebate closed.A landslide victory for CF.\n\n\u2014 Pink Jely Granny: agree agree\u2014\u00a0app***: agree agree\u2014\u00a0OO: agreeee\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nSimilar comments followed below.\nIn this post, they are talking about this. \nPotion is much more versatile and storable than coffee. Coffee has to be consumed within a certain amount of time, and there are fewer recipes than potions. There\u2019s also a need to mention the importance of healers who directly participating in a dungeon raids.\nIt\u2019s just an internet meme, so they\u2019re exaggerating. I don\u2019t think anyone really means it\u2026.\n\u201cHa\u2026..\u201d\nAlthough I said so, the pharmacist still had a serious expression on her face. She sighed deeply and drank the cold water.\nTrying to cheer her up, I pointed to the last item on the table and said.\n\u201cThen, hey, why don\u2019t you try raising a cute animal?\u201d\nEven if the rest didn\u2019t work out, she could still get an animal like I did.\n\u201cWaeoong?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu?\u201d\nThe animals of my house, which were stretched in a liquid state in front of the heater, raised their heads quickly, thinking we were talking about them.\nI didn\u2019t call you, guys. Just stay there and play.\n\u201cI\u2019m raising one! But my dog doesn\u2019t like the smell of potions, so I can\u2019t take him with me.\u201d\n\u201cWow, do you have a dog? If you have any pictures, please show me.\u201d\n\u201cHere, it\u2019s this puppy.\u201d\nThe pharmacist took out her phone and showed me an Instagram picture of a dog. It was a yellow puppy that looked like Injeolmi.\n\u201cWow, he\u2019s so cute. Can I follow you on Instagram?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s really smart. He\u2019s still young, but he already understands \u2018hand!'\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! What\u2019s your puppy\u2019s name?\u201d\n\u201cHis name is\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKeuheum, Ahem! Pharmacist-nim, ahem!\u201d\nThe tired-looking healer coughed and tapped the pharmacist on the shoulder. The pharmacist regained her senses and shoved her phone back into her pocket with an embarrassed expression.\nOoops. The puppy was so cute that we got sidetracked. Still, the atmosphere has softened a little. I put aside my disappointment and returned to the main topic.\n\u201cFor now, I understand the situation. But even if you condemn this cafe for that reason \u2026 that\u2019s right, why did you run away earlier?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I was waiting for the right time to tell you our request in private.\u201d\nThe healer scratched the back of his head awkwardly.\n\u201cAnd what is this secret request you have for me?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..! That\u2019s right, we have one favor to ask.\u201d\nTwo people with desperate expressions lowered their heads at the same time and shouted.\n\u201cPlease raise the price of the drinks!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yes?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d like you to raise the price at least twice, no, five times what it is now.\u201d\n\u201cFor something like that?\u201d\nI asked in surprise, but their expressions were serious.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just like that.\u201d\nThe pharmacist added an explanation, her face devoid of humor.\n\u201cEven with the menu called Irish Coffee, that is the case. In order to make a freezing nullification potion, I must use my skill for a long time in a sub-zero freezer. Still, I can\u2019t do anything with the bitter taste.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cBut how can you defend against freezing damage with just a cup of coffee! Really, ah \u2026 I was shocked.\u201d\n\u201cOn the Healer side, things are similar. Some novice healers are denied joining the party because they already have coffee.\u201d\nAs I listened to them, I was lost in thought.\nMy idea that the current price of coffee is reasonable remains unchanged. Considering the low price of raw materials, the current price is just right. I never thought I would hear that the price range of 1 ruby to 5 ruby is too cheap.\nHowever, these two people have a point.\nHmm, how do I do it?\nIf I\u2019m trying to be humble here\u2026.\n\u2018My coffee isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u2019\nI couldn\u2019t say it that way. After all, it would sound like I\u2019m diminishing the hard work that goes into healing people or making potions, not just my own work. If I say it\u2019s not a big deal, these people will become people who put their heart and soul into the trivial things.\nToo much humility is also a form of arrogance.\nBesides installing the banner that gave me useless worry, they have done me no harm.\nWell \u2026 I can\u2019t help it.\nI didn\u2019t want to hurt other Hunters who were doing similar things to enforce my views on coffee prices. I also have a Healer in my family.\n\u2026.even though it is irrelevant because Kwon Jiwoon is the best healer in Korea.\n\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s discuss it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nTwo people rejoiced at my words.\n[Sub Quest: Decorate the Menu Board]It is time to make a decision for sustainable cafe management.Let\u2019s adjust the price of the menu accordingly.Reset Menu Prices Reasonably: (Incomplete)Reward: Ether-Wiki Update]\nTiling!\nAs soon as I made my intentions known, a quest appeared in the system window.

            "c114": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nMoreover, young Ki Yoohyun.\nIt was cute because he had a different personality from the present Ki Yoohyun, but if he\u2019s that young, I\u2019m in trouble \u2026.. aaaaaaaah, I shouldn\u2019t think about this.\nLet\u2019s calm down. If there\u2019s a problem, there\u2019s a solution. I looked around with the mindset of finding the answer sheet for a maths workbook.\n\u201cWhat are you mumbling all by yourself, waeooong!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nPass. She looks like she doesn\u2019t know anything.\n\u201cAre you ignoring me!\u201d\nYou\u2019re getting quick-witted day by day, Meeum-ah.\nI opened my grandmother\u2019s diary again, but I can\u2019t see the visions anymore. There was nothing written on it, just blank pages.\nKi Yoohyun told me that he won\u2019t be able to be contacted for a few days. Even if it was possible, it would be awkward to suddenly ask about his childhood. It was difficult to explain how I knew about the past he had not told me about. It might arouse his suspicions.\nMost of all, his painful appearance, the explicit sight.\nCan I arbitrarily bring up the pain he didn\u2019t talk about just to get to the bottom of my question? Wouldn\u2019t my question dig up useless memories? Do I have the right to ask about his past?\nThen all that\u2019s left is\u2026\u2026.\nI got up and came out of the cabin.\nKeeping my distance from the flammable plants, I found a suitable clearing and opened the system window.\n[Skill: Eternal Flame (S) is used.][You summon Cthugha.]\nHwuuur.\nCthugha appeared with a blazing flame. The flames slowly transformed into a human with red hair.\nHowever, the system notification did not end.\n[Attack the area in 10-meter radius with Eternal Flame.][If you do not cancel within 10 seconds, it will be automatically executed. 10, 9, 8\u2026.]\n\u201cEek, cancel! Cancel!\u201d\n[The attack has been canceled.]\nGosh, I was surprised. What a scary ring.\nIf it burn everything in a radius of 10 meter, won\u2019t I die too?!\nI took a closer look at the skill window. There was a small option selection window under the \u2018Eternal Flame (S)\u2019.\n[Automatic Attack: On \u261c / Off]\nTo set the default setting of such a scary option to \u2018On\u2018 \u2026 I really couldn\u2019t be careless with this sytem. I quickly changed the option to \u2018Off\u2019.\n\u201cMy granddaughter!\u201d\nCthugha, whose appearance became completely human, called me.\n\u201cWhy have you never called me before? Do you know how bored \u2026 ahem, no, do you know how lonely I\u2019ve been?\u201d\nCthugha tried to hug me, but he stopped his action. He widened his eyes in surprise when he noticed the cabin on the border of the forest.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, this place\u2026.!\u201d\nDak dak. Cthugha ran towards the cabin. After passing through the empty living room, he spotted the fireplace in the kitchen and dropped to his knees. His sobs are muffled by the wind.\n\u201cOoh\u2026.\u201d\nThe answer is obvious from his reaction, but I still asked just to be sure.\n\u201cIs this where my grandmother used to live?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is. I never thought I\u2019d be able to come back here\u2026..\u201d\nHis head tilted at an angle. I watched him for a moment, then opened my mouth.\n\u201cI found this notebook here.\u201d\nI briefly described the vision I saw when I opened the notebook, then Cthugha spoke.\n\u201cThat looks like a fragment of causality left behind by Miss Heesun. To put it simply, a fragment of a broken link.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about\u2026.\u201d\nWhat is a fragment of a broken link? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something real like a hair tie.\n\u201cHuh, Goodness! This is why mortals are doomed. I can\u2019t believe you can\u2019t understand this simple explanation. What should I call it \u2026 it is like a VR experience. Yes,a VR game that takes you into the past!\u201d\n\u201cAha\u2026..\u201d\nI finally nodded at the customized explanation.\nIn other words, it was Ki Yoohyun\u2019s past.\nThe image of the boy in pain flashed in my eyes. What did the Church do to him?\nAlso, why did my grandmother leave a record of Ki Yoohyun and nothing else? She must not have known him in her lifetime.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWe were both lost in thought, me being me and Cthugha being Cthugha.\nI finally broke the heavy silence by bringing up the words that I hesitated to say.\n\u201cYou told me before that my grandmother left you without a word.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cMy grandmother left this place because my parents died. The sudden loss of contact must have been unintentional, so\u2026..\u201d\nI trailed off, unable to find the right words.\nIn the earliest years I can remember, my parents had already passed away. With no memory, there is no sorrow. It\u2019s just a vague sense of loss.\nThe first rift.\nIt refers to a large-scale rift that occurred simultaneously in various parts of the world shortly after the occurrence of the Great Dungeon Abyss.\nMy parents were caught in the first rift and died. They said that I was the only one lucky enough to be rescued. All I have left is a photograph.\n\u201cI see \u2026 was it something like that?\u201d\nCthugha, who rose in front of the fireplace, left the cabin.\nThis time, he stood on the cliff and crossed, lost in his own thought while looking down at the cabin. He looks wistful, as if he\u2019s searching for a time that no longer exists.\nThe problem was that whenever his emotions fluctuated, flames erupted around him.\nThis was a dangerous environment for him to set himself on fire.\n\u201cAaah, be careful!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nCthugha, who almost burned all the dungeon sugarcanes after a sigh, winced.\n\u201cHmm, Sorry. It wasn\u2019t intentional.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but over there, go over there.\u201d\nCthugha went to the place I pointed out and sat cross-legged. He sighed with a dreamy expression again. This time, however, the branch of the World Tree, Yggdrasil, was almost turned into firewood.\n\u201cMy granddaughter, somehow there\u2019s so much combustible material here.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because this is a field\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nCthugha, who wandered around in this space, eventually settled in front of a box containing green coffee beans. Coffee was the only thing here that he could set fire at will.\nApparently, Cthugha is used to being a gas burner himself. The fire roared to life, and soon there was a sound of beans being roasted.\nSmelling the strong coffee, I sank on the grass.\nJust as one question is solved, another arises.\nI said I wanted to be a cafe owner, not a detective. I\u2019m a person who reads mystery novels after checking the culprit spoiler first.\n\u201cWaeong\u2026..\u201d\nThen Mieum approached me. Lime wasn\u2019t with her, having gone to the Golden Triangular Rhino barn.\n\u201cMieum-ah, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget. You can do what you want to do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I want to do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat you wished for them in the first place. It\u2019s your job to do what you want to do. Waeuung\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201d\nI looked at Mieum quietly.\nHer expression was unusually serious. She looked desperate, as if she wanted to convey something.\n\u201cOur Mieum, for some reason, is saying the right thing.\u201d\n\u201cI always say the right thing, waeoong!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\nI reached out my hand and stroked Mieum. Mieum ducked her head as if she was being bothered, but soon she purred.\nYes, this cat is right.\nPhew, I almost got carried away. I was on the verge of becoming a person who agonized over the secrets of the world.\nNeither Ki Yoohyun\u2019s past nor the identity of the causality in my grandmother\u2019s vision could be known at this time.\nI opened the system window and checked the achievement list. Starting with the first \u2018Became a Beginner Cafe Owner\u2018 achievement, the latest achievement was written like this.\n\u2018You were determined to benefit the world with coffee\u2018.\nWhat a clear and good statement.\nLet\u2019s save the question to another regressor for later, and let\u2019s do what we can before then. I\u2019m talking about cafe management.\nJust as I was organizing my thoughts, Cthugha approached me.\n\u201cGranddaughter, I roasted all the coffee here.\u201d\nAll that much already?\nNot only that, but the color was perfect. The fire had been carefully controlled to achieve the optimal roast.\n\u201cHahahaha! I can do this for you as much as you want, so call me again.\u201d\nFeeling proud of his actions, Cthugha went back on his own.\nI\u2019m glad he\u2019s feeling better\u2026.\nThere is an immortal who enjoy roasting coffee, so I should work hard too.\nAfter making such a simple yet progressive conclusion, I went back to the store in good spirits.\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d\nAsh, who should have been deeply engrossed in the architectural miniatures, grabbed my sleeve and pulled me along.\n\u201cAsh, what\u2019s wrong with you all of a sudden? Is something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nAsh pointed out the window. As I turned my head to follow his fingers, I was startled. A large banner was hung in a prominent location.\n\u201cWe condemn Cafe Rieul\u2026.?\u201d\nIt\u2019s really a cafe management with no windy day.\n***\nSanta Claus, no, Kwon Seokmin hurried his steps.\nThe streets were buzzing with the anticipation of Christmas. He doesn\u2019t feels out of place in a red Santa costume. Even those who give him a glance don\u2019t take him seriously, thinking it\u2019s a part of promotional event.\nThere wasn\u2019t much time.\nThis happened because it took longer than expected to retrieve the Tikkoun Elixir from the hidden altar on Jirisan Cheonwangbong Peak. The entrance to the altar is guarded by a watcher. However, Kwon Seokmin, who was disconnected from the system, was able to avoid the eyes of the watcher. After he escaped the Maze dungeon, this is a blessing in disguise.\n\u201cTsk tsk, they said there could be a little time difference, but throwing away six years \u2026 it\u2019s a scam, a scam.\u201d\nKwon Seokmin grumbled to himself.\nThe experience at the Maze dungeon was terrible enough for him not to want to recall. However, there are some things that he learned from this experience.\n\u2018It\u2019s amazing. This world is actually\u2026\u2026.\u2019\n\u201cLong time no see. Where are you going that makes you so busy, Hunter Kwon Seokmin?\u201d\nA cold voice cut off Kwon Seokmin\u2019s thoughts. Surprised, Kwon Seokmin turned to the direction where the sound came from.\nAt the end of the narrow alley, a woman stood in front of him.\nShe was dressed in a suit, her hair neatly combed. Her arms are crossed, the posture gives a feeling of composure unique to a successful person.\n\u201cI\u2019m just a passing Santa.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? It\u2019s already been six years, but I\u2019ve met you at the guild leader\u2019s meeting.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting older these days, so my memory is a little blurry\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAt that time, I was still just a representative of the new guild, but I shook hands with Hunter Kwon Seokmin.\u201d\nSmile. Lee Sein smiled.\n\u201c\u2026Heh.\u201d\nAfter staring at her wordlessly for a moment, Kwon Seokmin clicked his tongue.\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop playing jokes that aren\u2019t funny. You\u2019ve already devoured that body, Aeon.\u201d\n\u201cUh-oh. Did you notice? Then this conversation will be fast.\u201d\nThe eyes shone coldly.\n\u201cHow did you get out of it alive?\u201d\n\u201cTsk tsk, putting people in labyrinths. You\u2019re so mean to someone with a bad sense of direction, really.\u201d\n\u201cThe Infinite Labyrinth. It\u2019s a place that a mere mortal can never get out of, so what did you do?\u201d\n\u201cHahahaha! Hahahaha!\u201d\nKwon Seokmin burst into laughter. He leaned his back against the wall of the alley and laughed.\nAt the same time, he scanned the surroundings.\nThree behind him, three in front. He\u2019s already surrounded. It\u2019s impossible for him to escape on his own.\n\u201cThe incarnation of the Mad God Chaos. Seeing that you came looking for me, it seems you haven\u2019t found it yet, right?\u201d\nThe expression, who had Lee Sein\u2019s body, hardened fiercely.\n\u201cWhere is the Grimoire?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m getting older these days, so my memory is a little blurry. Where did I put it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIf you tell me the location of the Grimoire, I might be able to save you.\u201d\n\u201cThe children will resent you for interrupting Santa Claus as he delivers happiness to children.\u201d\nLee Sein smiled as if she had heard a funny joke. With a light gesture, the attackers surrounded Kwon Seokmin in a circle.\n\u201cAs expected. It seems you have no intention of telling me the location.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ugh!\u201d\nFrom behind, a mysterious man attacked Kwon Seokmin.\nPuck! \nHis vision went black. Kwon Seokmin was dragged away.\n\n\n\nprevious\nnext\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nIt\u2019s really a cafe management with no windy day: the expression used in this sentence comes from the proverb \uac00\uc9c0 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub098\ubb34\uc5d0[\ub098\ubb34\uac00] \ubc14\ub78c \uc798 \ub0a0\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4, a tree with many branches doesn\u2019t have a peaceful day with the blowing wind. I used \u201cwith no windy day\u201d because the wind does not stop blowing that\u2019s why there\u2019s no windy day (since everyday has wind). Well, it means that a tree with many branches will always noisy because the branches will rustle and make noise even with a breeze/weak wind. It usually used to express that parents with many children will be under constant worries and concerns every day.\nAnyway, I think there\u2019s a lot of typos in this chapter so I\u2019ll comeback to check later skhsdskkjsjh I did this on my phone on hospital bed (nothing serious I swear, just apparently i\u2019m not suited with internship + volunteer works with too many physical activies, I\u2019ll stay in my bed and just keep this blog running from now on) instead of studying even though I have an online exam coming up tomorrow \u2026 please pray for me because it\u2019s an important exam T__T\nOh, I was feeling blue lately and opening this blog gave me joy \u2026 I hope this blog will live for a long a time so please don\u2019t  repost everything from here T__T This is my source of happiness\u2026.\nand tomorrow is Valentine Day! I hope you guys get a lot of love!\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c113": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cWaeoong\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cMieum-ah, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cWaeuung, The Great System, they cannot act against your will.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nShe must have been bothered by what my uncle said a while ago. Mieum rolled her eyes and added after staring at me for a long time.\n\n\u201cThis much is true. Believe me, waeooong!\u201d\nMy uncle had a point about the system. The system, or rather, the Saintess, had given me abilities with a certain intention, Still, now it is also true that the skills and quests the system gave me are helping me.\nSo\u2026.\nI smiled and poked Mieum\u2019s soft cheek.\n\u201cReally? Mieum-ah, whose side are you on? Is it me or the system?\u201d\n\u201cWaeong, waeooooong! That question is frivolous!\u201d\nLike a child who was asked, \u2018Do you like your mom or dad?\u2019, Mieum was torn. She glanced at me for a while before she replied in a small voice.\n\u201cOf course \u2026 Human, I like you better\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cOut! Your answer timed out. I\u2019m not giving you snacks today.\u201d\n\u201cI, I\u2019m trying to answer seriously \u2026 did you make fun of me, waeoong!\u201d\n\u201cOh, I got caught.\u201d\n\u201cKyayakyakyaoo!\u201d\nPak. A meow punch flew in.\nIn the meantime, I must have gotten very attached to this cat. Teasing her gave me so much fun.\nNo matter how the system works.\n\u2018I wish you\u2019d continue to be my cat\u2026.\u2019\nI went into the space with Lime and Mieum. The cat was glaringly sulky.\n\u201cMmoooo!\u201d\nCornelia Longinus, who had spotted Lime, came running from the barn. She licked Lime with her tongue.\nFor your information, Cornelia Longinus is the name of this Golden Triangular Rhinoceros.\n\u2026 in my defence, I didn\u2019t make up the name. Seriously.\nI couldn\u2019t think of a good name for the Golden Triangular Rhino, so I decided to ask everyone in the house for suggestions. We were going to have a vote and choose democratically.\nBut\u2026.\n\n\u201cHow about Bieup?\u201d\nCandidate No. 1, this is my opinion.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay to call it Spot, waeoong!\u201d\nCandidate No. 2, Mieum\u2019s opinion.\n\u201cKkyuuu! Kkyuuu!\u201d\nCandidate No. 3, when translated, means Pythagoras. I guess it\u2019s Pythagoras because it\u2019s a triangular rhinoceros.\n\u201cBelial. Hoho, I named it, but it\u2019s a nice name.\u201d\nCandidate No. 4, Ash\u2019s opinion. I looked it up and it was the name of a demon.\nThere were four candidates, but everyone insisted that their name was the best, so there was no consensus at all. The vote ended in a tie, and after much debate, we decided to let the Golden Triangular Rhinoceros decide for herself.\n\u201cMmmeh! Mmmoo!\u201d\nBut this cow snorted and got furious.\n[Summon: The Golden Triangular Rhinoceros in love reveals her name.][Name: Cornelia Longinus]\nThat\u2019s, umh, an elegant and wonderful name.\n[Cornelia Longinus angrily asks why you\u2019re trying to pick someone else\u2019s name.]\nUh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\n\u201cMooo!\u201d\nAs if accepting the apology, the Golden Triangular Rhino nodded.\n\nThat\u2019s how I learned this cow\u2019s name.\nI put a new bucket in Cornelia\u2019s barn. I thought I should give this cow a Christmas present, so I prepared it. I also replaced the full milk jug with a new one.\nIt was just when I finished my work, and I was going out with a bucket of milk.\n\u201c\u2026..?\u201d\nSuddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a slate roof. It was the roof of the cabin at the bottom of the cliff.\nThat\u2019s right, over there. That\u2019s the place where I found the hand mirror at Grandma Kim Deokyi\u2019s request. There were traces of my grandmother there.\nHow had I forgotten?\nWait, no way.\nNo, that\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s unbelievable, but \u2026 perhaps that cabin was the place where my grandmother lived, the one that Cthugha spoke of.\nI put the milk jug back on the floor.\n\u201cWaeong, where are you going?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu?\u201d\nLeaving behind the call of the animals, I went down the cliff.\nAfter passing a small path through a gap in a pile of stones, a large space appears. The cabin remained on the border of the forest. I immediately opened the door and went inside.\nThe room was like a living room with a thick carpet. There was a small door behind the table I hadn\u2019t noticed it when I first came to this place because it was hidden by the furniture.\nBeyond the door was an old-fashioned kitchen. A piece of charcoal remained in the fireplace. It was a sign of human habitation.\nI knew it right away. This is the cabin that Cthugha was talking about.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nMy head was spinning.\nUntil now, I hadn\u2019t really questioned the identity of this space. A forest shrouded in mist on all sides.. You can\u2019t see beyond the dense forest because there are no paths. So, I just assumed it was a closed space for planting and growing crops.\nIf the cabin that Cthugha said is really here, where the hell is this space?\nUnrefined questions popped out and stirred my head.\nNo, this is not the time.\nThere may be another traces of my grandmother left here. Let\u2019s find it. There\u2019s definitely something that could be a hint\u2026.\nHowever, the cabin is empty, with no plausible objects in sight.\nIn the end, I stick my hand into the unlit fireplace, just in case. When I stirred through the crumbled ash, something solid reached my hand.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026this is it.\u201d\nIt was a notebook.\nI swept the dirty surface with my palm. In the corner, my grandmother\u2019s name \u2018Park Heesun\u2019 was written. It looks like a diary.\nWhat could she have written in it?\nIt was the moment when I sat down on the floor and opened the diary.\n\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d\nA blinding light burst from the blank pages of the diary. My mind was pulled into somewhere. With the sound of a fast rewind, my vision blurred.\nBefore I knew it, I was in a pitch darkness.\nI\u2019ve already experienced this once. I noticed that I was seeing a vision.\nThe video rewinds quickly in front of my eyes and stops at one scene.\nA strange voice is heard.\n\u3010Our Foolish King.\u3011\u3010You may repeat the time of eons.\u3011\u3010If you can reach the end of Causality and awaken the King on the Throne of Darkness.\u3011\u3010Yes, even if it transcends eons of time.\u3011\nThen, I felt my consciousness being sucked into the video.\nThe next moment, I was in an unfamiliar space. It looked like a large auditorium.\nI inadvertently checked the floor. It was a solid ground, my footprints are imprinted in the dirt. It\u2019s the same as when the Saintess called me. The scene was too realistic to be a mere fantasy.\nWhat is different from then is the fact that there are many people here. Most of them were children who seemed to be in the upper grades of elementary school, and there were one or two adults who looked to be guiding them.\nWhat the hell is going on here? I walked around, trying to get a sense of the situation.\nHowever, these children didn\u2019t respond no matter how much I called them, as if they couldn\u2019t see me.\nThen, a familiar face caught my eye.\n\u201cAh, hey, kid!\u201d\nI reached out and grabbed the child by the shoulder.\n\u201c\u2026.Yes?\u201d\nThank goodness. This boy heard my voice properly. The boy turned around, looking slightly annoyed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember me? We\u2019ve met before.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nOn the way back from the Garden of Cthugha, this is the boy who led me.\nBut the boy had a sulky look on his face, as if he didn\u2019t remember me.\n\u201cMy name is Kwon Rieul. What\u2019s your name, kid?\u201d\n\u201cMy teacher told me not to tell my name to an adult I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nHe was a very smart boy\u2026\u2026\n\u201cTeacher? Is this a school?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that? Noona, you\u2019re really suspicious. Are you not a real kidnapper?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? No, I\u2019m not! I\u2019m the one who, uh, came to deliver goods! So I don\u2019t know, ahaha.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nI think I\u2019ve convinced him. That\u2019s good. It was a vision, but at least I didn\u2019t get accused of being a kidnapper.\n\u201cThis is the Church.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What did you just say\u2026.\u201d\nI wanted to ask more details, but the boy didn\u2019t listen to me and brought up another topic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all gathered today because we\u2019re going on a field trip. I wanted to go to Jeju Island, but they say we\u2019re going to Gyeongju. Noona, have you ever been to Jeju Island?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Uh, I\u2019ve been there once.\u201d\n\u201cChe, I envy you.\u201d\nThe boy kicked lightly on the floor.\n\u201cRather than that, what do you mean by what you said earlier? What is \u2018Church\u2018?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that either? That\u2019s it, of course, The Church of Starry\u2026.\u201d\nJust then, a chime sounded in the auditorium. The boy stopped talking and turned his head.\nAn adult was gathering the children. He must be the teacher.\nBehind him was a large door. It had an old-fashioned design that didn\u2019t look like it belonged in an auditorium.\nFor what? Something about that door felt ominous. It\u2019s very ominous and \u2026 I have a gut feeling that it shouldn\u2019t be opened.\n\u201cOh! It\u2019s time for the gathering, I have to go.\u201d\n\u201cWa-wait!\u201d\nI reached out in a panic, but grabbed nothing but air. Tada, the boy ran three steps and smiled brightly at me. The smile looked so much like someone I knew.\n\u201cIt was nice meeting you. My name is Ki Yoohyun.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe boy walked away.\nIt was impossible for me to intervene in what happened next. In an instant, the view became distant and I had no choice but to watch the scene in front of me like a spectator.\nThe door opened, and something dreadful beyond is about to be summoned.\nOnly then did I realize what this place was for.\nNo. All the kids here are going to die. An eerie premonition flashed through my mind.\nSoon, my surroundings turned into chaos. The children screamed in pain and fainted. The boy screamed and covered his ears. He looks distressed.\nNo, what are you doing? You\u2019re going to get killed!\nI shouted, but my voice did not reach the other side.\nThe moment when the slender body collapsed in a heap, unable to bear the pain.\nSlowly, the trembling stops. A net of light stretches out from the open doorway, wrapping around the boy\u2019s body and pulling him in.\nAh, I see. This is his \u2018Awakening\u2019.\nA net of light surrounded and patched up the boy\u2019s once shattered mind. Guided by the web of light, the boy\u2019s soul\u2026..\n\u3010Oh my, you were watching something like this.\u3011\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nIt was the Saintess\u2019 voice.\n\u3010Did you enjoy watching it?\u3011\u3010I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t show you more than this.\u3011\u3010Now, go back, to your world.\u3011\n\u2026\u2026.\n\u2026\u2026.\nMy vision is blacked out.\n\u201cHeuk, huuh\u2026.!\u201d\nMy forehead was damp with sweat. My eyes sting in the dim sunlight.\nWhen I came to my senses, I was crouching in front of an unlit fireplace.\n\u201cWaeooong! Human, what are you doing there?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu, kkyuu!\u201d\nMieum and Lime, who had followed me belatedly, jumped up and down in front of me.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKyaoog! Don\u2019t touch me with soot-stained hands!\u201d\nFirst of all, I\u2019m pretty sure that the boy I just saw in my vision is Ki Yoohyun\u2019s childhood self. I know up to that.\nBut why did the boy I met on the path of the stars have the appearance of a young Ki Yoohyun?\nIs it the Time Paradox or something similiar that appears in a lot of movies?\nDidn\u2019t he go back in time? Is it actually time travel, not regression?\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nSorry this is late (again), the Wi-Fi in my place had no connection since the day after the previous update and it\u2019s only been fixed yesterday. \nNow I suddenly want to see Yoohyun calling Rieul with \u2018noona\u2019\u2026..\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

I am also excited by the unique atmosphere of the end of the year.\nShould I play carols as store background music in Cafe Rieul? It would be nice to order decorations and decorate the cafe interior for Christmas.\nAt the end of the day, I was looking at the Christmas goods sales page on my phone with such thoughts.\nSuddenly, the door opened.\n\u201cHohohoho, merry Christmas!\u201d\n\nSanta appeared.\n\u201cHuh \u2026 uncle?\u201d\nTo be precise, it was my uncle dressed as Santa.\n\u201cDang, to find out the identity of this Santa right away like that. My niece has a very sharp eye.\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 it\u2019s usual to find out about it.\u201d\nThe cotton beard was on the verge of falling off his face. My uncle cleared his throat and fixed his beard.\nRed Santa suit and hat. In his hand, he was carrying a gift pouch and a large fir tree. He only has a simple makeup on, but it gave off a pretty plausible atmosphere.\n\u201cHow have you been, niece? This is your Christmas present.\u201d\nMy uncle gave me a fir tree just the right size to use as a decoration tree.\nHowever, there was one problem with this tree. It\u2019s not artificial, it\u2019s a real tree.\n\u201cUncle, it\u2019s illegal to bring coniferous trees from the mountains!\u201d\n\u201cHohoho! Don\u2019t worry, niece! I bought it at the market.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019m glad.\u201d\nI thought it would be a good idea to decorate this fir tree to create a Christmas atmosphere. I accepted the tree after thanking him.\nWould it be okay if I put it next to the counter? While contemplating where to put the fir tree, my uncle added with a serious expression.\n\u201cMy nephew, make sure to remember what your Uncle said. It\u2019s best to pay for everything.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, yes\u2026.\u201d\nI know he left the Hunter World to enjoy his life as a natural person, but\u2026.\nHe seems to have suffered a lot during this time. My uncle had become an ardent follower of the modern consumer society.\nI sincerely agree that it is better to pay for a living.\nFrom growing coffee to making sugar, now even milking the milk on my own \u2026 I didn\u2019t practice it much because I\u2019m running an extreme DIY cafe.\nMy uncle took out three gift boxes from his gift pouch. Mieum, Lime, and Ash each had one share.\n\u201cThen this Santa Claus should give presents to the good children.\u201d\u2019\n\u201cWaeoooong (You know the greatness of this body and pay tribute to it)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyu!\u201d\n\u201cSanta Claus \u2026 the one who originated from Saint Nicholas and distributes gifts on the eve of Christmas. \u201c\n\u201cHohoho! Yes, you know it well. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s just been scratched from the wiki.\u201d\nMieum and Lime\u2019s gift was a new rice bowl, and Ash\u2019s gift was a do-it-yourself architectural miniature.\nAside from the animals who were already excitedly running around the new bowl, would something like a miniature suit Ash\u2019s taste? I glanced at Ash\u2019s expression.\n\u201cCut this part and apply glue \u2026 hmm.\u201d\nHe was already reading the assembly manual. He seems to like it.\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ll make you something to drink. What would you like?\u201d\n\u201cThen, I\u2019ll have Irish coffee.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, please sit down for a moment.\u201d\nI headed in front of the espresso machine to make coffee. My uncle\u2019s request was heard again behind my back.\n\u201cNiece, I\u2019d like my Irish coffee with lots of whiskey and no coffee.\u201d\nThen isn\u2019t it just whiskey, not coffee?\nI didn\u2019t follow my uncle\u2019s instructions and handed him an Irish coffee with exactly the right amount of whiskey.\n\u201cHow have you been?\u201d\n\u201cKeuh, haaa! After all, the taste of civilization is good!\u201d\nHe took a sip of coffee and put on a thrilled expression. Hmm, it looks like he\u2019s been through a lot.\nMy uncle told me his story.\nIt\u2019s not unusual to start a natural life without preparation, but there were many hardships. It is said that it was a time to realize the importance of electricity, water, heating, and other civilizations.\nHis YouTube channel, which he started to open the second act of life, has 11 subscribers and the highest number of views 53 times. Sadly, he had no choice but to give up his dream of becoming a YouTube star and go down the mountain.\n\u201cDang \u2026 my friends, I even sent them a link on Kakaotalk! The \u20181\u2018 mark disappeared, but why isn\u2019t the number of YouTube views going up?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d\nActually, I didn\u2019t watch Uncle\u2019s YouTube either. I\u2019m sorry.\nAfter emptying the coffee, my uncle took off his Santa\u2019s top because it\u2019s hot and hung it on a chair.  After that, he put his hand on his chin and asked me a question.\n\u201cSo, what is the thing that made my niece curious that she wanted to see this big Uncle?\u201d\n\u201cI want to know about my grandmother.\u201d\nHis face, which was more than half covered by the made-of-cotton beard, had a serious expression. He looked as if he had been reminiscing the memories from a long time ago.\n\u201cDid Grandmother ever live in a cabin in the woods?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, and?\u201d\n\u201cAlso, I wonder if you know about the abilities that Grandmother had. Cthugha said that she could read the stream of stars.\u201d\n\u201cThe streams of stars. Well, for a crazy rice cooker, he used the exact expression.\u201d\nWhat a crazy rice cooker \u2026 it was a nickname that made me feel a little sorry for Cthugha.\nMy uncle lifted himself from the chair. He recited low, looking out of the window.\n\u201cStars. Yeah, it\u2019s the stars.\u201d\nIt was the time when the day has passed and darkness has fallen. The starlight was exceptionally clear today. As I raised my head following my uncle\u2019s gaze, I saw countless stars.\nIt must be because of my mood, but it felt like the stars were looking this way.\n\u201cThere are Gods who want to manipulate this world as they please. They are called by different names. Voices, Stars, The Constellations, Gods of Another World \u2026 the system calls them The Great Ones.\u201d\nThe uncle stopped talking for a moment and burst into laughter.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that funny, niece? There is a degree of self-consciousness to claim greatness with their own mouths.\u201d\n\u201cHahaha \u2026 uh, yes.\u201d\n\u201cThe system is a tool for those self-conscious transcendents to intervene in the life of humans without defying the causality.\u201d\nThe smiling eyes turned to me.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange? The system window that resembles a game gives us power.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cTranscendents try to manipulate us through the system.\u201d\nMy uncle spoke very cynically about the system.\nMaybe that\u2019s the reason. My uncle, who was a Hunter, seemed more comfortable now that he had lost his awakening ability.\n\u201c\u2026waeoong.\u201d\nAs if wanting to refute my uncle\u2019s words, Mi-eum let out a small cry. However, she just rolled her eyes didn\u2019t say anything more. She seemed to be lost in her own mind.\n\u201cMy mother \u2026 her eyes were special.\u201d\nA beat later, I realized that those words answered my question.\n\u201cHer eyes?\u201d\n\u201cYes. An eye that can read the Causality. It is also called The Fairy Eyes.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nEven before dungeons were created in the world and the Awakeneds appeared, my grandmother was said to have seen things others could not see.\nMy uncle chuckled, telling me that if she had acted as a fortune teller, she would have made a lot of money.\n\u201cAnd when her children grew up to a certain extent, she left behind a letter saying that she will solve the tangled casuality.\u201d\nHe said he wasn\u2019t surprised. In in the eyes of my uncle, Grandmother seemed like someone who would leave at any moment.\n\u201cIt must have been then that the crazy rice cooker met mother. She said lived somewhere quiet.\u201d\n\u201cThe tangled casuality \u2026 is it resolved?\u201d\nMy uncle shook his head. That\u2019s something only my grandmother knows.\nI remembered my grandmother who was strong and kind. I wish I had known more about my grandmother before she passed away. The grandmother in my uncle\u2019s story feels like a stranger.\nAfter we finished the conversation, my uncle prepared to go back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see Oppa, right? I\u2019ll call him in advance.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not yet. I have job to do.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Can\u2019t you just contact Oppa first? What are you going to do?\u201d\nMy uncle put on the top of Santa\u2019s clothes again, which he had taken off, and carefully checked to see if any part of his beard had fallen off when he was undressed.\n\u201cHohoho! Santa Claus has only one job to do. It is to give presents to the good children.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\nI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s serious. I could already see Kwon Jiwoon grabbing his throbbing forehead.\n\u201cWait, hold on! Uncle, just one. Tell me one more thing please!\u201d\nMy uncle was about to leave after saying he was busy delivering gifts before Christmas. I grabbed my uncle\u2019s sleeve in a hurry and poured out the question.\n\u201cCthugha told me that Grandmother suddenly disappeared from the cabin without a word. When and why did Grandmother, who had left like that, return?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Uncle?\u201d\nFrozen as if he was recollecting old memories, he was silent for a moment.\n\u201cMy mother returned\u2026.\u201d\nThe trembling breath filled with unspeakable emotions.\n\u201cMy younger brother and his wife, that \u2026 niece, she returned after she heard that your parents had died.\u201d\n***\nIt\u2019s late.\nI had to prepare for tomorrow\u2019s business and get ready to sleep.\nLong after my uncle left, I got up from sitting in a daze.\n\u201cAsh, you must be tired, so get some rest.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Ash?\u201d\nThere was no answer. When I looked at Ash, he was already immersed in making miniatures. With a serious expression on his face, he cut and sanded the parts.\nHow did he pick such a perfect gift for Ash\u2019s taste? Did Uncle and Ash become really close at the camping?\nAnyway, I\u2019ll leave him alone because it looks like he\u2019s having fun.\nI was going to leave Ash alone and go into the space for a while, but this time, Mieum blocked my way.\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner: \nI hope you guys don\u2019t mind getting Christmas chapters on late January\u2026..\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c111": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cUmh, don\u2019t be so surprised \u2026 I\u2019d like to get an advance payment\u2026..\u201d\nInstead of constantly receiving the payment when he\u2019s selling the numbered ticket, he asked for 100 rubies of the sale price first. \n\u201cHaha, there\u2019s an item that I want to buy, but I have to pay the balance by today \u2026 If you\u2019re unable to do it, I\u2019ll find someone else.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, wait, wait. You\u2019re so impatient!\u201d\nJinwoo did the calculating again. \n\n100 rubies was a quite big expenditure for his pocket. However, it is a waste to miss such a pushover. If he went to another merchant while Jinwoo was busy hesitating, he might realize that he got scammed.\nFurthermore, Jinwoo has to be careful for a while because the cafe owner remembered his face. He can\u2019t do this business for the time being.\n\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201d\nYeah, damnit. If he sells the numbered ticket, he can get the 100 rubies back in no time.\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s do that! I\u2019ve used my generosity.\u201d\nOf course, Jinwoo is not a pushover. Therefore, he carefully checked not only the opponent\u2019s contact information but also his Hunter ID Card. The advance payment was paid only after writing a simple contract with personal information.\nJinwoo, who took the numbered tickets, hurriedly left.\nThe remaining trading partner smiled and held his phone in his hand. A short dialing sound went on before the call is connected. His expression no longer bears any awkwardness.\n\u201cHello. I took care of it as you told me. It\u2019s useless to keep this money, so I\u2019ll donate it to an appropriate place.\u201d\n\u2014 Okay.\n\u201cYou owe me a debt, right?\u201d\n\u2014 \u2026\u2026..\nThe other person cut off the call without giving an answer. He\u2019s such a heartless man.\nThe man used his index finger to sweep the Hunter ID Card he just showed to Jinwoo. As the illusion spell was erased, the original letter, the name of the illusionist Oh Seoho, appeared. \nA Hunter who occupied the 18th place in the ranking, but now he was more widely known as an entertainer.\nStill, his ability to manipulate illusions was real.\n\u2018What on earth is that cafe that making even the No. 1 ranker cares about a fly?\u2019\nHis curiosity arises. Let\u2019s find out on his own sometime soon.\n***\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here\u2026.?\u201d\nAs soon as Jinwoo returned home, he posted  a numbered ticket of Cafe Rieul sales post on the Hunter Channel.\nHowever, it was weird. Usually, messages would have poured out before 10 minutes went by, but he received none this time.\nDid he get blocked because he posted a sales post?\nThere\u2019s no way. He changed his nickname several times so that he wouldn\u2019t get caught easily. \n\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLooking at the clock, there is not much time left until the cafe opens. He\u2019ll have to deal with all these numbered tickets before then.\nHe felt nervous. Jinwoo made up his mind and wrote another sales post by drastically lowering the price. However, this time, let alone message, the number of views of the post hardly increased.\nThis is a completely different reaction than before.\n\u2018Is it out of fashion?\u2019\nJinwoo put a search term related to <Cafe Rieul> on the Hunter Channel and then clicked on the latest post.\n\n[Chatting] My heart is racing,, (4)\nUpvotes: 38 / Downvotes: 0\n\nWriter: Sweet Sugar\n\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\nThere was a dungeon that I couldn\u2019t get through because of the damage caused by the frozen attributeI was on the verge of being frozen myself because I ran out of the non-freezing potions.I cleared it because they gave me coffee through that strange door.Thank youIt was an emergency, but they only received the payment in regular price;\u315c\u315c\n\n\u2014\u00a0OO: God R\u2014 Consignment Shop No. 2: The light that descended to the desolate Hunter World T_T\u2014\u00a0red***: To be honest, it seems like the price of the drink is too cheap. Does she get any profits after selling it so cheaply?\n\u2514 MM: LOL The pharmacist bastards who asked a sick person in front of them to pay express fees are animals\n\n\nThey still filled with all kinds of plagues with coffee, which was not a big deal. So it doesn\u2019t seem to have gone out of fashion, but the numbered tickets still doesn\u2019t get sold.\nDamn, it looks like he\u2019s just wasting money.\nJinwoo, who was in conflict while looking at the clock, got up. He was going to buy coffee with this numbered ticket himself and sell it. It\u2019s tight because there\u2019s a time limit on maintaining the coffee\u2019s condition, but it could also be sold at a high price if he caught a good pushover.\nBut\u2026.\n\u201cHmm\u2026.?\u201d\nThe cafe owner, who received the numbered ticket, tilted her head as if it were strange. Then, she returned the ticket to Jinwoo.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you can\u2019t buy coffee with this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I have a numbered ticket, so why can\u2019t I buy it?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t get this yourself, did you?\u201d\nThe cafe owner pointed to a small mark on the corner of the numbered ticket.\n\u201cThis numbered ticket has the binding effect to the first owner. If you were the first owner, it would glow, but there is no response.\u201d\nThe binding effect is usually given only to high-end equipment or items. It\u2019s astounding to use such a thing for a piece of paper. Still, the money already invested had to be recovered. Jinwoo lied with a calm face.\n\u201cI got it from a friend. It\u2019s not like friends can accept it for each other.\u201d\n\u201cStill, we have a rule that you should come to buy it on your own.\u201d\n\u201cMy friend told me to try the coffee here. Are you asking me to throw away his sincerity to the ground?!\u201d\nJinwoo\u2019s stubborn attitude made the cafe owner take a step back.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I can only accept it this time\u2026.\u201d\nHowever, Jinwoo hardened his face when he heard the cafe owner\u2019s next words.\n\u201cThe drink also has a bind effect, so the effect only works when the original owner drinks it. Is that okay with you?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nCrush. Jinwoo crumpled the numbered ticket in his hand.\n\u201cWhat do you mean by binding?! What about my money!\u201d\n\u201cMoney? This cafe doesn\u2019t charge a reservation fee, right?\u201d\nHe was beaten.\nHis gut instinct told him that this isn\u2019t accident. He was tricked. The stupid man, who took the advance payment with a lame excuse, hit him in the back of his head. He must have taken the money knowing about the binding effect.\nHe was enraged at the thought that he had been caught by a pushover.\n\u201cYou! You conspired with that nerd and took my money!\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d\nIf he thinks about it a little bit, he\u2019ll realise that it\u2019s a ridiculous speculation. However, the fact that he got caught by someone that he thought was a pushover made him lose his reasoning.\nAll eyes are on him. He heard whispers behind his back.\nHe was furious, but he couldn\u2019t make a fuss because the Hunter, who stood in line behind him and stared at him, looked strong.\n\u201cKeuheum, no, whatever. I\u2019ll end this for now\u2026.\u201d\nIn the end, Jinwoo faltered and stepped back. It was an excellent display of the strong and the weak.\nBut.\n\u201cCustomer-nim, wait a minute. Take this with you.\u201d\nThe cafe owner held out something. It was a cup of drink.\n\u201cAre you trying to drug me?\u201d\nTak, he knocked the cup off and tried to pour it onto the floor.\nChill.\nAgain, he felt a sharp gaze behind his back. It seemed like they wouldn\u2019t let him go if he refused the favor or spilled this drink.\n\u2018These pushover guys\u2026.\u2019\nAlthough he muttered those swear words on his mind, he had no confidence to confront them. Jinwoo, who had long embodied the attitude of \u2018strong-to-the-weak and weak-to-the-strong\u2019, grumbled and received the cup.\nA system notification immediately popped up.\n[You are identified as the original owner.][Item: Lemonade has a binding effect.]\n***\nI held the binding sign-pen in my hand.\nThen, without hesitation, I carefully marked the numbered tickets I had prepared in advance.\nI was able to effectively block the tickets scalpers with this pen. There was confusion among the customers for about a day after I announced that the numbered tickets and drinks will have a binding effect, but it was quickly sorted out. Most of the customers were happy to drive out the resellers.\n\u201cHmm, that\u2019s weird\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nI must have said it out loud without even realizing it. Ash poked his head from the side. I shook my head and told him it was nothing, then Iwent back to work.\n\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s strange\u2026.\u201d\nWhy doesn\u2019t the quest completion notification appear?\nNo more traders are in sight. I searched the Hunter Channel just in case, but there was no post about tranding numbered ticket or coffee.\nThen isn\u2019t it done? It\u2019s done, right? Is it because I complained that they\u2019re stingy with the rewards before?\n[This is the reward we have prepared with our utmost effort. Let\u2019s cherish it. \u0669(\u3147\u3145\u3147)\u0e07]\nThey\u2019re sulking\u2026.\nYeah, I\u2019m sorry for calling you stingy. I\u2019ll treasure it.\nI said that, but the quest completion notification still didn\u2019t ring.\nI opened the quest window and checked the completion conditions again.\n[Drive out the merchant who takes unfair advantage: (Incomplete)]\nNo other conditions are written. So, what else do I have to do to clear this quest?\nThe question was soon resolved.\n\n\u201cWhat about my money!\u201d\nThis is because a merchant who seemed to have been drawn by the big picture appeared.\n\u2018Ash, calm down. It\u2019s fine.\u2019\nI calmed Ash, who was about to jump out immediately.\nThe merchant was angry, but he couldn\u2019t do anything more because he was concerned about the eyes around him. He looked around and then slowly stepped back.\nBy the way, does anyone feel a sense of deja vu in this situation?\nIt reminded me of the time when a journalist came to our cafe before. It was nice to see the journalist\u2019s name on the main page of the portal site from time to time. He seemed to be walking on the path of a true journalist.\nAnd what purified the journalist\u2019s heart is\u2026.\n\u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019\nI handed the lemonade to the merchant with a half-doubt.\n\u201cAre you trying to drug me?\u201d\nThe merchant, who tried to refuse at first, could not overcome the pressures from his surrounding and reluctantly took the lemonade cup.\nAnd he drank it.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHe made a surprised face and emptied all the remaining lemonade. The merchant looked at me with clear eyes.\n\u201cI \u2026 I have lived the wrong life.\u201d\nAs expected, it\u2019s like this again\u2026.\nIt would be boring if I told you everything I\u2019ve already experienced once, so I\u2019ll summarize it briefly.\nAnyway, he will live a good life from now on; the story that he told me was something like that.\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Sub Quest: Let\u2019s Eradicate The Black Ticket Trade and Find The Light\u2019.Please collect the rewards.]\n[Experience: 10 EXP have been acquired.][You have obtained the Silver Teaspoon.][Fame: 1 / Popularity: 2 have been acquired.][<Cafe Rieul>\u2019s current Grade: D]\n[Item: Silver Teaspoon (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)It\u2019s just a teaspoon. Surprisingly, it can also be used as a weapon.Type: High-Speed Short-Range WeaponAttack: 1Note: It will discolor when it touches poison.]\nAs soon as the merchant was purified, a notification of the completion of the quest popped up.\nI was lost in thought for a moment, skimming through the status window.\nSo far, there have been many other customers who have ordered and drank this lemonade. However, their impressions were usually in this way.\n\u201cI feel refreshed somehow.\u201d\u201cIt seems to clear my head, but I\u2019m not sure\u2026.\u201d\u201cI think it helps me relax\u2026.\u201d\nThe words were more equivocal than a health supplement promotional phrase. To put it bluntly, this meant that there was no special buff effect.\nHowever, it has had a tremendous effect on some people to reflect on their lives.\nDoes \u2018purifying the mind\u2019 mean purifying small evil?\nIf so, wouldn\u2019t it be possible to purify something greater by raising the grade of lemonade?\nAnd maybe we can make a world free of misdemeanors by letting a lot of people drink it?\nUhm, seriously, I got a little scared because I thought it would be possible.\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nFinally we\u2019re done with this ARC. Personally, it was always satisfying to see Rieul using lemonade T__T\nNext chapter will be on the day after tomorrow, so you guys can come back by then! It was nice to see there\u2019s so many familiar names still showing up even after the vague hiatus\u2026. \nThank you Anonymous for the Wishlist Coffee!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c110": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nLast evening, Choi Yichan visited just after the cafe was closed.\n\u201cUnyaaah (this human, is he back now?)!\u201d\n\u201cWaeong, waeooong (Let\u2019s play! Play with me)!\u201d\nThe animals in our house circled around Choi Yichan and started crying. In addition, suddenly, Ash began cleaning the store, conscious of Choi Yichan as if he were looking at his competitor.\nThe cafe has already been closed and the cleanup has been finished. The inside of the cafe, which was cleaned using the skill \u2018The Floor is Shiny\u2019, didn\u2019t even have a speck of dust. There is nothing more to do.\nIn other words, all of them are just being a distraction.\n\nI sealed Ash and the animals in front of the television in the next room with snacks. An occult movie was airing at the moment. They finally became quiet as they focused on the screen.\n\u201cYichan-ah, sit down. Would you like some coffee?\u201d\n\u201cHaha, I\u2019d appreciate it if you give me some.\u201d\nI made ice cream coffee with plenty of ice cream in a glass. As if it wasn\u2019t cold, Choi Yichan emptied his glass right away. Seeing him drinking it well made me feel better.\n\u201cKuh, haaa, it\u2019s really delicious.\u201d\nHe tried to put the glass, which had been emptied to the last drop, down on the table. I reached out my hand in bewilderment.\n\u201cYichan-ah, be careful\u2026.\u201d\nBut it didn\u2019t break.\nThere was a clatter, but there was no crack in the glass. It was a perfect control of power.\nThe Spartan training of the Dungeon Management Office seems to have worked. Indeed, Korea is a country with a great passion for education. You can achieve anything even with a short-term education.\nChoi Yichan looked around the store with his chin resting on his hands. It must have looked like something new for him. I met him in the dungeon where Cthugha resided, but he was so busy that he didn\u2019t have time to look around the store back then.\n\u201cA lot has changed.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What? Oh, here?\u201d\nThe street is now slowly getting soaked in the year-end atmosphere. The period during his absence is not that long in terms of date, but in the meantime, the inside of the store has changed a lot.\nAs rewards from  the system, the tables have been upgraded to the \u2018Comfortable Table\u2019. Now, this place also has a mysterious door, a walk-through counter, and a new part-timer.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you seem to be doing well.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d\nChoi Yichan touched the pendant hanging around his neck with his fingertips. It was the pendant containing the dark ether that I gave him before.\nNot only had he already acquired the skills, but he had become an S-Class Hunter, so he didn\u2019t need to wear that pendant anymore. I briefly explained this before, but he was still wearing it.\n\u201cAre you still wearing that pendant?\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh. I like it.\u201d\n\u201cYou like it? The design?\u201d\nThe pendant is just a black stone the size of a pinky fingernail hanging from a plain string. It\u2019s a very boring design to be an accessory.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that\u2026..\u201d\nThe slightly drooping eyes closed softly. A bright smile followed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long-awaited gift that Rieul finally gave me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThank you, but saying that made the atmosphere very awkward. Feeling a tickle on my cheek, I quickly got up. I cleaned up the empty glass, then I asked if he would like another glass.\n\u201cOh, thanks, then!\u201d\nThere was no shadow in that bright answer.\nThis time, I decided to make dalgona coffee. Just in time, the newly made dalgona hardened just right. After crushing the dalgona with a spoon, I asked while picking out a large piece and placing it in a glass.\n\u201cYichan-ah, what were you trying to say when we met before?\u201d\n\u201cUng?\u201d\n\u201cBefore you got dragged away by Jina-ssi and Hunter Kang Hyunwoo, you said you had something to say to me.\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2026.\u201d\nI put the finished dalgona coffee in front of Choi Yichan.\n\u201cJust \u2026 I was going to say that now that I\u2019m back, I want to drink the coffee you make.\u201d\nChoi Yichan picked up a piece of dalgona and chewed it. There was a crunching sound. He wasn\u2019t lying when he claimed that he wanted to drink my coffee, judging from the light bar twinkling above his head.\nI noticed that Choi Yichan swallowed what he was originally going to say to me and changed the subject.\nShould I ask for more details?\nIf he\u2019s changing the subject because it\u2019s a difficult words to bring up, wouldn\u2019t it be better to just not ask?\n\u201cEih, I thought something\u2019s happening. I can listen to you as much as you want without having to say something so vague like that.\u201d\nI answered lightly and thought about it in my mind.\nPutting down the glass after a sip, Choi Yichan talked again. The smile that always hung on his face faded.\n\u201cKwon Ri, the man from before\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cBefore? Who do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe man I saw on the day we returned from the dungeon.\u201d\nIt was an ambiguous expression, but I immediately understood who he was talking about.\n\u201cAh, Yoohyun-ssi?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that person. What is your relationship with him?\u201d\nI was about to answer Choi Yichan\u2019s question, but I felt a strange gaze and turned my head.\nAsh and the animals, who were supposed to be watching TV in the next room, poked their heads out through the crack in the door.\n\u201c\u2026.waeong.\u201d\nWhen our eyes met, they pretended not to see me, but it was already too late. What\u2019s wrong with them? They looked like our conversation was more exciting than watching TV.\nI came back after replenishing snacks for my distracted family.\nWhat\u2019s my relationship with Ki Yoohyun?\nI know his true identity and his regression. The remaining answer was short, as I could not say that I felt a sense of homogeneity as a fellow regressor.\n\u201cHmm \u2026 I\u2019d say we\u2019re close friends. I got a lot of help from him.\u201d\nCoincidentally, shortly before Choi Yichan arrived at the store, Ki Yoohyun called.\nHe informed me that I would not be able to contact him for a few days because he had some business to do. While on the phone, when I mentioned that I had decided to get help from Grandma Kim Deokyi to deal with the ticket scalpers, he said it was a good idea. Later, he added.\n\u2014\u00a0Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll do something as well.\u201cIs that \u2026 you\u2019re not saying that you\u2019re going to find out what they look like and deal with them, are you?\u201d\u2014\u00a0Eh. I can\u2019t use such an ignorant method.\u201cHey, Yoohyun-ssi, I think law-abiding awareness is important.\u201d\u2014\u00a0Hahaha\u2026.\nThe phone was cut off with a cheerful but uneasy laugh and  goodbye.\nAs I reflected on my conversation with Ki Yoohyun, Choi Yichan looked at me with a thoughtful expression.\n\u201cYou got help \u2026 from him. Is that all?\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine if it\u2019s still like that.\u201d\nThe grin somehow bothered me.\n\u201cYichan-ah?\u201d\nThe moment I was about to ask again.\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to join The White Silver Guild.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\nI remembered a conversation I had with Choi Yichan before. It was not long after he became an S-Class. He had firmly stated that he had no intention of joining a guild.\nWhy did he suddenly change his mind?\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Kwon Jiwoon forced you to do so?\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, no. I asked him to join The White Silver Guild.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad if that\u2019s the case \u2026 why did you change your mind?\u201d\n\u201cKwon Ri \u2026 Rieul-ah.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nHe took a light breath and spoke calmly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you that I\u2019m still alive like this and become an S-Class.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No. That\u2019s not what happened. Your humility is too much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that I did various things to obtain the dark etheric item because I did not want to repeat the tragedy of the pre-regression past. However, the achievement is obviously his. In order to save the children, Choi Yichan jumped into the crack by himself and overcame it on his own. All I did was spice things a little.\nI heard he raised his level a lot while he was gone. Level 40. Isn\u2019t that effort also done by himself?\nEven though I said so, Choi Yichan shook his head.\n\u201cNow that I have obtained this power \u2026 I want to do what I can in return.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nMaybe it\u2019s because of the mood, his eyes seemed to be gleaming\u00a0sharply.for a moment.\nThe tip of Choi Yichan\u2019s finger touched my hand that was placed on the table casually. Even though it touched just a little, Choi Yichan was startled and removed his hand.\nThe atmosphere is strange. Choi Yichan added, scratching the back of his head awkwardly.\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think I can do a part-time job here. I\u2019m here to say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Well, of course you can\u2019t. You\u2019re officially doing hunter activities. That\u2019s right, if Kwon Jiwoon gives you hard time, let me know.\u201d\n\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Yichan closed his eyes and smiled.\nHe has an easy-going personality, an unreserved attitude, and even a bright smile. He is the Choi Yichan that I know, and yet now he seems to be somewhat complicated. I felt strange when I realised that I haven\u2019t meet someone who wasn\u2019t like this.\nKi Yoohyun, who said that he is a regressor, is trying to seal the Demon God.\nThe same goes for Choi Cedric, who seemed to be worried about his sickly younger sister.\nNow, it\u2019s Choi Yichan.\nThere are only people with complicated circumstances around me.\nGee, I couldn\u2019t believe I did a regression, but I\u2019m the only one who is simple?\n\u201cWaeooong, waeoolg (End of the story. Play with me)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu!\u201d\nAt that time, Mieum and Lime popped out of the next room with a loud noise.\n\u201cHahaha, yes, yes. Come here.\u201d\nChoi Yichan held Mieum and Lime in each hand and juggled them. I could hear the cries of our house\u2019s animals, who excitedly spinning in the air.\nThank God. I\u2019m still less simple than them.\nHeck, I inadvertently compared myself to a cat.\nAs a human being, I feel a sense of crisis\u2026..\n***\nTiling!\nIt was one gloomy afternoon when Jinwoo heard the Hunter Channel note notification.\n\u2018Hehe, another one caught.\u2019\nJinwoo recently made a lot of money. It was due to the transaction for the numbered ticket of Cafe Rieul.\nIt\u2019s none of his business what the cafe is all about and why all Hunters are making fuss about the coffee. The only important thing was the piece of paper that could order a drink was traded for at least 10 rubies and an average of 20 rubies.\nA cafe in a remote place in front of the Dungeon Gate suddenly rose to stardom. They rake up money every day. so it wouldn\u2019t be obvious if he stole some money from the stupid Hunters. It\u2019s mutually beneficial.\nOne thing that bothers him is that the cafe owner recognized him.\nShe has good eyes. He doesn\u2019t know how she remembered him in that large crowd. Still, it\u2019ll be annoying if he get caught.\n\u2018Hmm, I should save myself for the time being.\u2019\nAfter peeling off and eating the stupid Hunters until today.\nHowever, the note contained something he had not expected.\n\u201cHe said he would sell me numbered ticket \u2026? This much?\u201d\nIt was about wanting to sell the numbered ticket of Cafe Rieul at 3 rubies per ticket. It\u2019s a lot cheaper than the market price.\nJinwoo went to meet the person who sent the note with a half-doubt. If it smells fishy, he doesn\u2019t have to make a deal. It was based on the calculation that there was nothing to lose just by meeting him.\nThe place of the deal that went out like that.\nThe opponent was a young boy who looked like someone who was ignorant of the world. He held out three numbered tickets to him while paying attention to his surroundings with a clumsy attitude.\nThe calculator ran quickly in Jinwoo\u2019s head. At least 20 rubies per numbered ticket, and 30 rubies at best. It was a tremendous business.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to sell this to me? Three rubies per ticket?\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2026 I don\u2019t have time to go get coffee \u2026 Looking at the Hunter Channel, it seems like you\u2019re trading the numbered ticket, so I was wondering if you\u2019d get this too\u2026.\u201d\nJinwoo spoke in a condescending manner as if he had been generous.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you 10 rubies for three tickets.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.! Thank you.\u201d\nHowever, before the other person who received the 10 rubies goes back, he suddenly said this.\n\u201cI \u2026 I can trade numbered tickets tomorrow as well. The day after tomorrow too.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.is that true?\u201d\nThe other person said that there are numbered tickets that can be obtained through connections, and that he can sell three tickets every day. He was a total pushover. Jinwoo was about to tell him to bring as much as he wanted right away.\n\u201cBut \u2026 instead, there is a condition.\u201d\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c109": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nIt occurred to me.\nSince the atmosphere has been like this in the Hunter Market, some Hunters may also have a strong and weak tendency.\nI, who was treated coldly as an F-class, received a different hospitality than before. It\u2019s a typical cider situation, but I didn\u2019t feel like boasting about how satisfying it is.\nI just felt sick of it.\n\u201cI only sell coffee to people who get a numbered ticket by standing in the line.\u201d\n\nAfter saying that, I got up.\nCome on, let\u2019s finish our errands and go.\n\u201cMore than that, I\u2019d like to go to the consignment shop.\u201d\n\u201cYes? Hunter Kwon Rieul-nim, there are many items in our Hunter Market that are better than the lower-class items sold in consignment shops. Originally, it\u2019s not items that anyone can see, but I\u2019ll show them to you right away.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I have business in the consignment shop area.\u201d\nThe staff was persistent. After repeating similar recommendations and specifications several times, I was able to escape from that VVIP room or whatever they called it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fun here.\u201d\nAsh muttered with a sullen expression. I totally agree with his statement.\nI managed to leave thestaff who said they would guide me in person and entered the consignment shop area.\nIt\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve been here. When I first came, it was empty, but now various stalls have been opened, making it quite crowded. I headed to the shop in the most corner, inconspicuous of all. There were several items for beginners on the shelf, but no other customers were seen.\nThe shopkeeper greeted me with a bright smile.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\n\u201cGrandma, how have you been?\u201d\nIt was Grandma Kim Deokyi.\n\u201cToday you came with a cute little boy. Do you want this Grandmother to give you candy?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a kid\u2026.\u201d\nAsh didn\u2019t seem to like the expression \u2018little boy\u2018, but he quietly took candy. There was a rolling sound of candy in his mouth.\nTo find a way to deal with ticket scalpers, the person I consulted with was Grandma Kim Deokyi. Although she is retired now, I guessed that she would know how to do it because she is a Master in the production industry.\nMy guess was correct. Grandma Kim Deokyi said this after hearing the explanation over the phone.\n\u2014 Hmm. If that\u2019s the case, you can use that item.\u201cOh, do you know how to handle it?\u201d\u2014 Yes, come visit me sometime\u201cThen, I\u2019ll visit you at the workshop.\u201d\u2014 No. Let\u2019s meet somewhere other than the workshop.\u201cAll right. Where should I go?\u201d\nGrandmother Kim Deokyi called me to this place, the consignment shop area of Hunter Market.\nI found out that after retirement, she is hiding her identity and selling items for beginners as a hobby. Indeed, when I first met Grandma Kim Deokyi here, she was hiding her identity\u2026.\n\u201cBut doesn\u2019t anyone recognize your face?\u201d\nShe is a famous Master Craftsman who is the representative of the 1st generation Hunters. That\u2019s what I asked, but the old lady shook her head.\n\u201cHohoo \u2026 surprisingly, people don\u2019t look at other people\u2019s faces very well.\u201d\nSo far, no one has noticed her identity.\nI stared at Grandma Kim Deokyi again.\nEven though we were indoors, she wore a sun visor and silly Paisley-patterned pants with a gray arm sleeve on the arm. It was hard to recognize her as a craftsman by usual eyes.\nPerhaps Grandma Kim Deokyi is enjoying the real life of a powerful woman.\nNo, rather \u2026 a secret connection who gives mysterious power to the main character seems to be more suitable to describe her.\nOne day, just one person, Grandma Kim Deokyi will give a rare item to a Hunter who treats her politely.\nI\u2019ve heard a lot about this development of, uh, if you know, you know. It\u2019s the first law of the protagonist. Be kind to ordinary-looking old people.\nI glanced around. A Hunter, who happened to meet my eyes, quickly approached us.\nHoo, is that him?\nI watched him with excitement, but\u2026.\n\u201cWhere is the bathroom here?\u201d\nNot at all. It seems that a person who has the main character traits doesn\u2019t appear that easily.\n\u201cOh, here. I brought what you said.\u201d\nI handed over the stainless steel thermos from the inventory. Inside, there were several cups of cafe romano.\nItem: Cafe Romano (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 01:00:00)Effect: Increases enchantment success rate by 200% for 1 time, and prevents item damage in case of enchantment failure.]\nThe effect of this coffee is as follows.\nWhen I talked about the effect, Grandma said she wanted to try it. Since I came to see her for the first time in a long time, I have made it generously.\n\u201cThank you \u2026 huu.\u201d\nKim Deokyi, who was reading the status window of the cafe romano, sighed.\n\u201cIf I had this coffee, I wouldn\u2019t have had to break items like before\u2026.\u201d\nIt seems that she has been heartbroken when she recalled the items that she had cracked during the enchant process. I hope she can use it usefully.\n\u201cThis is the item for Miss Rieul.\u201d\nOn the surface, it was a pen that looked like an ordinary digital pen. Soon after I received it, the status window appeared.\n[Item: Sign Pen of Binding (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)Don\u2019t forget to write your name on things.When used, an item binding effect occurs to the first owner.]\n\u201cI made it in a hurry, but the effect will work.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.! Thank you!\u201d\nBinding refers to a phenomenon in which the item becomes completely the property of the owner. Simply put, it is similar to writing a name on an object. Items with your name on them cannot be sold to others. In other words, it\u2019s non-transferable and non-tradeable.\nGreat. This is enough to drive out the resellers.\n\u201cHohoho\u2026.\u201d\nJust by imagining the merchant panicked while holding a numbered ticket with binding effect, I laughed unconsciously. I put the sign pen into the inventory with a wicked smile, then Grandma suddenly spoke.\n\u201cFinally, you have regained the true power of the ring.\u201d\nHer eyes were on the Cthugha\u2019s Ring.\n\u201cYes? Ah, right.\u201d\nWhen I first received Cthugha\u2019s Ring from Grandma, the status window was like this.\n[Cthugha\u2019s RingType: AccessoriesEffect: Unusable.]\nHowever, after meeting Cthugha in the dungeon and signing a contract, the status window of the ring got updated.\n[Cthugha\u2019s Ring (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605)A token of a contract with The Eternal Living Flame, CthughaWhen used by the appropriate user, Cthugha can be summoned.]\nI haven\u2019t summoned Cthugha because there\u2019s nothing to do yet, but I can feel a different power than before just by wearing it.\nThe \u2018stone containing his power\u2019 that became the material of this ring was handed over to my grandmother by Cthugha. The stone revolved around and ended up in my hand. Could this be a mere coincidence?\nSure, solving the problem of ticket scalpers was an important matter, but the real reason I visited Grandma Kim Deokyi today was because I wanted to ask about the ring.\n\u201cGrandma, please tell me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cHow did you come to make this ring?\u201d\n***\nOn my way home from Hunter Market, I was lost in thought. I remembered what Grandma Kim Deokyi said to me a while ago.\n\n\u201cThe stone that became the material of the ring was given to me by Park Heesun-ssi as the price of lending her the hand mirror.\u201d\nAh, that hand mirror. I found it inside the cabin in the space at the request of  Grandma Kim Deokyi. We made Choi Yichan\u2019s pendant with the broken mirror.\n\u201cI succeeded in making Cthugha\u2019s Ring, but I couldn\u2019t use that power.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhen I asked Park Heesun-ssi, she said the ring was properly completed properly. She just said the right owner hasn\u2019t shown up yet. She asked me to deliver the ring to the appropriate user.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2026 is that me?\u201d\nGrandma Kim Deokyi nodded. However, it was vague how she came to know that I was the right user. She told me that it\u2019s like she heard a voice telling her I was the one.\nIn the end, I asked.\n\u201cWhat was my grandmother like?\u201d\u201cLet me see \u2026 she was too far away to be called a friend, so I don\u2019t have much to say. One thing is for sure\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cShe was someone who saw things you wouldn\u2019t normally see.\u201d\nA dim gaze reached me. The last words were filled with longing.\nHmm. There is something in common between the descriptions of my grandmother by people (and non-person) who remember her.\nFirst, she wasn\u2019t an Awakened. It wasn\u2019t a development of \u2018Is My Grandmother The Strongest Hunter of The First Generation?\u2019 or \u2018I Became The World\u2019s Strongest Through My Bloodline\u2018.\nActually, I was looking forward to it, so it\u2019s a pity.\nHowever, it is certain that the grandmother had some mysterious power. Cthugha told me that she could read the stream of the stars. For now, t is unknown what exactly that power is.\nHeck, if they\u2019re going to return me to the past, I wish they could have sent me back to when my grandmother was still alive.\n\u2018I miss my grandmother\u2026.\u2019\nLooking back, the reason I awakened was also because I went to my grandmother\u2019s store.\nNow it is just used as a place to grow crops, but the space in the store is also strange. Why there is a space like that in a building?\nMaybe I move along the path my grandmother prepared for me?\n\u2018Career planning should have been decided in consultation with the person concerned\u2026.\u2019\nIf so, what is at the end of this? A one-on-one battle with a crazy pseudo-religious man? Saving the world?\nAye, this isn\u2019t the case, though. I can help people clearing the dungeons through my cafe, but I\u2019m only a helper.\nHaha, ha\u2026..\nOnly a helper \u2026 right?\nAh. Talking about the crazy pseudo-religious man.\nWhen I decided to officially publicize Cafe Rieul, an unmanned security system was installed around the store. The crime prevention bell Ki Yoohyun gave me is also a valid security tool.\nI prepared for the worst, but fortunately, I haven\u2019t seen him yet. I hope he keeps not showing up like this\u2026.\n\u201cLook over there.\u201d\nAt that time, Ash pulled my collar slightly. Gosh, I\u2019ve been lost in my own thoughts for too long.\n\u201cSorry. I was thinking about something else for a second. Let\u2019s go. \u2026.? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026that.\u201d\nWhat Ash pointed to was a large electronic display board installed on the building opposite the road. It just so happened that the news was coming out. A news tap explaining road traffic conditions passed by, and Choi Yichan\u2019s face appeared on the screen.\nSoon there will be a big caption underneath.\nThe S-Class Hunter Choi Yichan, 6th in the Ranking \u2026  confirmed to join The White Silver Guild.\nAh. It\u2019s finally been officially announced.\nI stood there with Ash and calmly watched the news screen. The news dealt with the information quite heavily, saying that the game of the Domestic Hunter Guild is blah blah blah.\nThe reason for my indifferent response is simple. I heard about it in advance yesterday.\nChoi Yichan, who was finally freed from the Dungeon Management Office, stopped by our store yesterday. It had been almost a week since we returned from the dungeon.\nI couldn\u2019t say anything because it\u2019s Choi Yichan\u2019s own business. It is said that he was only released after taking tests on strength control training and related norms ranking, as well as ranking measurement in  his re-registration.\nHunter Registration \u2026 I finished it very quickly\u2026.\nBefore visiting the Hunter Market for the first time, I went to the community center to register as a Hunter.

            "c108": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nWhy did the post suddenly get deleted? What was it about? I became more curious because it got deleted.\nI\u2019ve come up with a determined spirit. I sat down and started browsing the posts on the Hunter Channel.\nIt was not an exaggeration to say that all Hunters registered in Korea use Hunchan, so it was not easy to find the information I wanted because it was a large community.\nIn addition, it was difficult to recognize because there were many cases where the title was written in an usual way to avoid showing up on the search result.\n\n[Chatting] I went to get a numbered ticket today.\nI found the most plausible title and clicked it\u2026.\n\n[Chatting] I went to get a numbered ticket today.\nUpvotes: 16 / Downvotes: 0\n\nWriter: Lick Pink Jelly\n(Photo)\nI went there today, and the calico cat is so cute.It looked like a baked bread in front of the heater.I also gave it snacks \u3147\u3145\u3147)v\n\n\u2014 Cherry Dumplings: aw aw cute cat\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nIt was completely unrelated.\nNo wonder Mieum didn\u2019t eat a lot today. It must have been because she got snacks.\n\u201cWae-waeooong! It\u2019s rude to take a picture of this body without permission!\u201d\nContrary to what she said, her face clearly showed joy.\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026.\u201d\nLime seemed to be disappointed because there was no talk about her.\nCheer up, Lime. You already have two ardent followers.\nIt took a long time to browse the Hunter Channel with the animals that kept interfering. This time, I found the post that I really wanted.\nIt was a new post that was posted 30 seconds ago.\n\n[Chating] CFR numbers for tomorrow, number n0 (0)\nUpvotes: 0 / Downvotes: 0\n\nWriter: YY\nNO HIT AND RUN.\nTomorrow\u2019s numbered ticket n0, one for the early phaseThere\u2019s one for the latter half of n0.\nWrite a note with the offer priceNo reply below 10 rubies\n\n\nHey, look at this.\nOnce I figured out the trick, I was able to find similar posts without difficulty.\n\n \n\nWriter: YY\nBought today. Good condition.There are two cups left for an hour and a half of state retention time.Price 10 rubies per cup.Direct transfer message.NO HIT AND RUN & NEGO.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d\nIt was outrageous and it annoyed me.\nI understand if you hand over the numbered ticket because you couldn\u2019t come to the cafe due to a situation. You might want others to be able to taste the coffee instead of making the ticket wasted for nothing.\nHowever, these posts reminded me of the time when I tried to get a concert ticket at the request of Shin Mira. There was only crazy ticket scalpers who wrote down a price that was several times the original price and came out like a trash human.\nIn other words, these posters are the same kind of guys. A merchant. Just look at the fact that they make a post with a temporary nickname, then deletes it immediately when they gets an offer.\nWhat is transfer! It\u2019s for sale and the price is 10 rubies?\nCurrently, the menu sold at the cafe is priced between 1 and 5 rubies. The cheapest Americano is 1 ruby. Since the price of whiskey sold at the Dimensional Shop was quite expensive, Irish Coffee was the most expensive at 5 rubies.\nI\u2019ve been asked to raise the price quite a bit. Previously, Ki Yoohyun also said that coffee prices were too cheap, but I have no intention of raising the price right now.\nIt was hard at first because I had to brew everything from coffee beans with my own labor. It\u2019s like a cafe life that starts with zero.\nHowever, now the coffee making is mostly automated. It costs little to make the ingredients, and once the beans are roasted, there is not much to do after that.\nSo, I think the price is reasonable.\nI\u2019m already rich enough to earn rubies one after another anyway. If I only think about money, there is no reason to do this labor. I\u2019m just doing it because I want to run a cafe.\nThat\u2019s it.\nBut when I saw them doing business with the coffee I made \u2026 I felt unhappy. Ash and I are working hard, but these bad resellers are earning money through our hardships.\nTiling. The system notification sounded just in time.\n[A quest has occurred.]\n[Sub Quest: Let\u2019s Eradicate The Black Ticket Trade and Find The LightThis is a big deal!Bad reseller has appeared in your cafe.Let\u2019s drive them out and create a healthy cafe culture together.\nDrive out the merchant who takes unfair advantage: (Incomplete)Rewards: Experience (10 EXP), Fame (1), Popularity (2), Silver Teaspoon]\nAs if it was made in haste, the quest reward were small. Still, the compensation was not a problem right now. Even if the quest didn\u2019t appear, I couldn\u2019t leave it like this.\nHmm, what should I do\u2026.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\nAs I stared at my phone and put on a hard expression, Ash poked his head. I showed the post I just found and briefly explained the situation to him.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe there are such vicious people\u2026.! It is an evil deed that even the primordial chaos would be astonished at.\u201d\nAs expected, Ash, who works at the cafe with me all day, was furious. Let\u2019s spend some time empathizing with each other using anger as fuel.\n\u201cWe have to blow up meteor on such humans.\u201d\n\u201cHuh \u2026 no, no, that\u2019s not it! Ash, stop for a second!\u201d\nI hurriedly rushed to catch the part-timer of my house.\nIt\u2019s very infuriating that the scalpers sold the numbered ticket and earned more money, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can use force. After I explained that, Ash calmed down, but he asked me with a sullen expression.\n\u201c\u2026.what are you going to do then?\u201d\nRight, what should I do? Report it to the Dungeon Management Office or Hunter Channel?\nThat will only have a temporary effect. There is a limit to sanctions if it is regarded as an individual transaction. At best, they will delete the post, and the merchant will do business more secretly in the future.\nThis is a problem with black tickets and illegal trading at higher prices. The harm is great, but the grounds for legal punishment are ambiguous.\nI can\u2019t use force immediately as my radical part-timer suggested\u2026.\nStill, I\u2019m too angry to leave it alone.\nAfter much consideration, I decided to ask Ki Yoohyun for his opinion. He\u2019s a veteran Hunter, so he might have some good ideas.\nI sent a KakaoTalk message with that in mind, and I received a reply right away.\n[Ki Yoohyun]If you tell me the description of that person, I\u2019ll take care of it. ^^\n\u2026\u2026.\nWhy are you asking about the description?\nI have a hunch that \u2018taking care of\u2018 that Ki Yoohyun mentioned is not a sincere conversation or persuasion. It was clear that this man\u2019s idea was not much different from Ash.\nAfter all, this happened because there was demand. Someone wants to get a numbered ticket comfortably without waiting even if they need to pay 10 rubies.\nI wish I could systematically prevent this situation first rather than directly harming the merchant.\nIs there any way\u2026\u2026\n\u2026.Ah.\nI called one of the contacts on my phone. The dialing went short and soon the call was connected.\n\u201cHello! Yes, it\u2019s been a while since I contacted you. How have you been? I\u2019d like to ask you a favor\u2026.\u201d\n***\n\u201cYou can just rest.\u201d\n\u201cHeh \u2026 a shady place is my path.\u201d\nIt has become a regular holiday for Cafe Rieul.\nIt\u2019s been a while, so I wanted to be idle all day long, but as soon as I woke up, I got ready to go out. The purpose, of course, was to find a way to deal with the ticket scalpers.\nAsh also decided to go with me. He still has a brusque expression, but he seems excited to wear his new clothes.\nIt\u2019s our first time going out together since we went shopping in Yongsan last time. Not to mention the trip to Yongsan ended up being a mess.\nMaybe I should have taken him around a little more\u2026.\n\u201cThen, children, stay calm and guard the house.\u201d\nAfter a while, the sounds of \u2018waeooong\u2019 and \u2018kyuuuu\u2019 were heard from the corner.The animals were already busy playing and didn\u2019t care about it, so I opened the door and left.\nAfter leaving the store, I headed to the Hunter Market.\nMy steps are heavy. To be honest, I didn\u2019t want to come. The last time I came to that place, the staff was so unkind.\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m hurt by every staff\u2019s attitude that is so strong to the weak. Still, I don\u2019t feel like I want to go get cold treatment\u2026.\n\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Aren\u2019t you going in here?\u201d\nSince I was standing in front and I didn\u2019t go straight into the entrance, Ash beckoned to me.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s useless to keep hesitating\u2026.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a saying that it\u2019s better to get hit first.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go. Ash, come with me.\u201d\nIn that way, I made my own determination and entered the entrance on the first floor of Hunter Market.\n\u201cWelcome. What can I do for you?\u201d\nA kind smile and a friendly tone greeted me, but I know this perfect customer service attitude will melt away like the snow the moment I give out my Hunter ID.\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m looking for something\u2026.\u201d\nIt was the moment I was about to reveal my purpose with a trembling heart.\n\u201cAh! I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t recognise you, Hunter-nim!\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cThank you for visiting Hunter Market. We will serve you with all our heart and soul to satisfy Hunter-nim today. I\u2019ll take you to the VVIP room, so please come this way with your company.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026.?\u201d\nI happened to be dragged into the VVIP room and sat down. With its luxurious interior, the sofa was soft enough to fall asleep right there. The staff accepted my bag and coat, and as soon as we sat down, they served expensive refreshments and juices as a welcome food.\nI didn\u2019t come to buy anything, this excessive kindness was burdensome.\nThe question of why they suddenly dud this to me didn\u2019t last long. The staff quiety approached me and talked to me.\n\u201cHunter Kwon RieuI-nim, I have heard the reputation of Cafe Rieul well.\u201d\n\u201cHaha \u2026 thank you.\u201d\nAha.\nI guess I was more famous than I thought I was. The coffee of Cafe Rieul is very popular, so I got this kind of treatment even though I\u2019m an F-class?\nThe staff spoke again, showing excessive kindness by pouring juice into the empty juice glasses.\n\u201cUmh, could you give me the honor of tasting Hunter-nim\u2019s coffee separately\u2026.?\u201d\n\u201cYou can come tomorrow morning and get the numbered ticket.\u201d\nHowever, the staff reacted with disdain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cOur Hunter Market has a close relationship with many VVIPs. We have a long-standing relationship with not only the top rankers, but also the executives of the main office.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026.?\u201d\n\u201cIf you allow me to taste Hunter-nim\u2019s coffee separately, you will be able to build a good relationship with many VVIPs. It will also help you establish your position in the Hunter World.\u201d\nAs I said before, my coffee is popular, so try serving it to those high-ranking people as a bribe.\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nLife happened (apparently, doing volunteer works is really time and energy consuming) and I missed the timing for the New Year\u2019s Eve, so I decided to start this year on Lunar New Year \u2026.\nHappy Lunar New Year, everyone!

            "c107": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThe camera turned on a red light.\nMieum and Lime, who were bickering and running around the floor until a while ago, suddenly became quiet. They leaned on the cushion and turning their heads slightly, both of them seemed to be conscious of the camera.\nOn the contrary, Ash ran away to the corner, perhaps not wanting to be seen on the screen.\n\u201cMeow, meow.\u201d\nMieum-ah, why are you suddenly crying out \u2018meow meow\u2019? Usually it was \u2018waeoong\u2019 or \u2018waeooolg\u2019.\nStill, it wasn\u2019t the right time to have this conversation.\n\u201cYes, this is the menu\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe left arm and left leg went out at the same time. I introduced the menu with an awkward gesture.\nI\u2019m glad I have the \u2018Smile\u2018 skill. Even though there\u2019s a fault in my posture, my expression showed the perfect business smile.\n\u201cSo you can look at the menu and order the menu that has the special effect you want.\u201d\nIt was the first opening day when the formal registration process was completed in an instant and the embargo was lifted.\nThe Dungeon Management Office proposed filming an introduction broadcast to publicize accurate information about the cafe.\nIt\u2019s a burden, but\u2026.\nIt\u2019s important to give proper information at first. Think of it as a process you have to go through once you decide to reveal about the cafe. I accepted it with that kind of mind.\n\u2018I had a hard time trying to stop Kwon Jiwoon from appearing on the broadcast\u2026.\u2019\nToday, reporters and several cameras rushed in to the cafe to film the first visitors.\nThe first customers to appear on the show was selected by lottery. They were three Hunters who seemed to be friends.\nOne of the customers who was looking at the menu with an excited expression suddenly asked.\n\u201cSo what is the effect of this cold brew coffee? There\u2019s nothing written here\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAh. It\u2019s random.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026random?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s a new menu that I made this time, and the type and amount of buffs applied are all random.\u201d\nThe customers\u2019 eyes seemed to sparkle and shine.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll have a cold brew.\u201d\n\u201cI want a cold brew too.\u201d\n\u201cUh, I was going to have a cold brew too.\u201d\nThe menu was unified in an instant. A reporter interrupted in a panic, probably because they wanted to film them ordering various menus for the broadcast.\n\u201cWait, everyone\u2026? There are a lot of different menus, are you not interested in this? For example, here, the caramel macchiato looks delicious.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not a Hunter if you avoid a challenge.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026? What does that have to do with the menu?\u201d\n\u201cI accept this challenge!\u201d\nThe reporter was forced to step down because of the stubbornness of the guests. I quickly made three cups of cold brew coffee and handed it to the customers.\n\u201cWow! It\u2019s real. A status window appeared, it said that this coffee gives random buffs.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d\n\u201cThen let\u2019s try it!\u201d\nThe customers held a coffee cup in one hand and reacted as requested in advance in front of the camera.\nIt was awkward, but I was awkward enough, so there\u2019s not much difference.\nImmediately, customers drank all the cold brew coffee. They\u2019re the prepared cast members so they didn\u2019t forget to show their reactions that the coffee is delicious.\n\u201c\u2026..! 80% increase in agility. Is this okay?\u201d\n\u201cI have a 5% increase in Luck \u2026 It\u2019s ruined, heung\u2026.\u201d\nNaturally, the gazes poured out to the last one. After drinking all the coffee, he briefly stared into the air to check his status window.\n\u2026 and he roared.\n\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaa! 200% strength!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cIs that true? Wow, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d\nThe reporter who was watching these various reactions was also interested in cold brew coffee. They asked if they could try a drink, so I made it right away.\n\u201cMmm, it\u2019s rich in scent \u2026 it tastes clean even until the end. It\u2019s really delicious \u2026 oh.\u201d\n\u201cReporter-nim, what di you get?!\u201d\n\u201cWow. It\u2019s \u2026 my intelligence has increased by 800%.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cWow, awesome\u2026..!\u201d\nThis was the beginning of the Great Hunter Gacha era.\n***\n\u201cThe person over there, you can\u2019t film YouTube!\u201d\n\u201cAh, wait a minute, the phone \u2026 yes, this is Cafe Rieul. No, I won\u2019t be appearing on TV anymore. What? You\u2019re going to promote it as a good restaurant? Don\u2019t say scary things.\u201d\n\u201cNext number, please come!\u201d\n\u201cTen cups of cold brew coffee, please.\u201d\n\u201cI can only sell up to two drinks per person.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that the national rule is to draw 10 consecutive draws? The owner has also tried it, right?!\u201d\nI\u2019ve tried it a lot\u2026.\n\u201cStill, I can only sell up to two cups.\u201d\n\u201cUgh \u2026 then I\u2019ll have two cups, please.\u201d\nThe customer who received the cold brew coffee sat down at an empty table and emptied a cup. They clenched their fists and shouted while looking into the air.\n\u201cPlease, please, please aaaaah!\u201d\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nIt\u2019s someone who\u2019s crazy about gacha\u2026.\n\u201cWaeooong (I don\u2019t think you have any rights to judge that).\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu!\u201d\nAfter the broadcast filmed on the first day was aired, drawing became a huge boom among the Hunters. Hunters flocked from the next day, and they began to order cold brew coffee one after another.\nThe popularity spread out of control as a Hunter, who hit a jackpot in the cold brew coffee draw, certified that he had killed the boss monster in a dungeon in one shot.\nThe challenge is to take out the cold brew coffee from our store and then drink it at the dungeon to test and certify the effect.\nOf course, I also like to draw. I once ate only collaboration red bean bread seven days a week to get a free draw ticket.\nBut no matter how much \u2026 why is this so popular?\nAs a result, such videos and articles have taken over the internet.\n\u2501 [Unprecedented] 1000% Agility, Great Cold Brew Effect\u2501 I\u2019m not good at lottery, but I want to catch the boss (edited version)\u2501 Cold Brew Draw | Probability Verification | Dungeon Speedrun Challenge with Draw Effect\nI don\u2019t know if I can say it\u2019s peaceful, what to say\u2026.\nThere was also an article saying that the speed of dungeon raids has increased thanks to the popularity of the challenge.\nI\u2019m glad to hear that it has a positive effect \u2026 I didn\u2019t know there are so many people who like to draw.\nIt was said that lottery was a bad civilization, but for the time being, there seems to be a long way off from the disappearance of lottery from the world.\nDue to the popularity of the Cold Brew Coffee, I was tempted to summon Cthugha for a while and use him as a part-timer. Still, supplementing the labor force is not a fundamental solution to this problem. \nI admitted that the relaxed YOLO life of the 5-day work-week system (\u203b5 days off. This is important), which was my first goal after returning to the past, has already gone away. However, I couldn\u2019t continue to be dragged around by these crazy lottery maniacs.\nHere\u2019s my status window at the moment.\n[Name: Kwon RieulClass: Cafe Owner (F)(Lv. 17)Stamina 140/140, Energy 140/140Strength: 26 (+10), Intelligence: 21, Agility: 18, Luck: 19]\nIn the meantime, experience accumulated through cafe sales, and my level became 17.\nStill, due to the low maximum energy, there was a limit to the amount that could be made in a day despite continuing to recover with coffee. For this reason, the sales method was changed by distributing numbered tickets to customers in advance.\nIf you submit a numbered ticket at your turn, you can purchase up to two cups per person. The cold brew coffee is also limited to one cup a day.\nOther than that, if a Hunter, who entered through the \u2018Connect Anywhere\u2606Mysterious Door\u2018 urgently needs recovery or buff, I decided to sell coffee to them regardless of the numbered tickets. The reason I decided to do this in the first place was because I wanted to help an injured Hunter. Urgent people come first.\nToday\u2019s last guest was Ju Noeul. She was with a party that seemed to belong to the Royal Guild.\n\u201cOh! It\u2019s finally our turn. Cold brew coffee \u2026 is already out of stock. Then I\u2019ll have a cookie set, please. What about the guild leader?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with Americano \u2026 more than that, Rieul-ssi, can I follow you on Instagram?\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, of course. I\u2019ll follow you back.\u201d\nIn the process of officially promoting the cafe, I unintentionally became quite famous. After the official cafe opening, the number of Instagram followers on my account, where I had posted a few pictures of coffee cups then forgot its existence, increased tremendously.\n\u201cHuh\u2026.?\u201d\nI was surprised when I opened the app to follow Ju Noeul\u2019s Instagram.\nThere was a DM from Lee Chorok, a former dungeon-farm owner and current fruit store part-timer. The content was, \u201cI will send you a Shine Muscat directly from the production area, so can you promote it on Instagram?\u201d.\n\u2018You\u2019re doing well\u2026.\u2019\nIt was a pity that the dungeon farm was closed, even though it was her fault. At least the fruit shop life seems to suit her aptitude.\nAfter Ju Noeul went back, I checked my watch. It was time to distribute the numbered ticket.\n\u201cAh, time\u2019s up. Eat this and rest.\u201d\nAfter giving Ash the snacks, I headed to the front of the store with the numbered tickets I prepared in advance. There was already a long line of customers waiting to get a numbered ticket. Seeing so many people, I was deeply moved.\n\u201cHere\u2019s the ticket. Thank you.\u201d\nI was handing out numbered tickets one by one in order.\nSuddenly, I found someone I thought I\u2019d seen somewhere. He was a middle-aged man with an ordinary impression, but the scarf pattern around his neck was unusual and drew attention. I saw him somewhere.\nAh, I remembered.\n\u201cOh! You came to get a ticket yesterday too. You must really like coffee!\u201d\nIt\u2019s a little embarrassing to say with my own mouth, but \u2026 the numbered ticket distribution, which is conducted twice a day in the morning and evening, is currently quite competitive. It\u2019s hard for even old regulars to visit every day.\nI thought it was amazing to come for two days in a row, so I talked to him lightly.\n\u201cAhem \u2026 what\u2026.\u201d\nNod. The customer who took the numbered ticket shyly averted his gaze and left.\nI looked at his back casually and realized a sense of incongruity a beat later.\nWait. That customer, he never came to buy coffee?\nDid I not recognize him when he ordered coffee? It could be, but \u2026 it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable.\nSomething similar happened again. Most of the customers who received the numbered tickets came to buy coffee. However, some people received the tickets for several days in a row, but I don\u2019t remember seeing them at the cafe.\nIs it simply that I was too busy to remember?\nNo. I thought that was not the case.

After finishing the closing and organizing the cafe, I accessed the Hunter Channel and searched for information about our store.\nI searched by changing keywords, but what came out was only ordinary small talk, appreciation post, and challenge certification.\n\u201cIs it not here\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you looking at by yourself, waeoong!\u201d\nJust as I was trying to avoid Mieum, who interrupted me from the side, a plausible title caught my eye.\n[Chatting] Cafe R Ticket number 10 sorry\n\u201cAh.

            "c106": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\nThe Hunter thought, it\u2019s a boring dungeon.\nThere\u2019s never been such a boring dungeon like this one. The Hunter waved his hand nonchalantly with a tired expression. The dagger, which flew in a parabolic arch motion, accurately stabbed the monster in the forehead. The monster that was weaker weaker than his level died leaving only the ether ore intact.\nWith a bored expression, the Hunter retrieved the ether ore and put it in his inventory. This is the hundredth. However, there is still a long way to go before reaching the target.\n\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe Hunter had no luck with guild. After wandering through several guilds, he was finally able to get accepted in his current guild. \nThe problem is that he cannot be promoted to a regular guild member unless he meets the ether ore quota. In addition, if he resigned in the middle, he cannot find items that have been ripped off as a membership deposit.\nThat\u2019s why for a few days, he\u2019s having a round to get a high-purity ether ore in the already stabilized dungeon. He has already made a few laps around this dungeon. Now, he could memorize the location of the monsters spawn, the terrain, and even the shelter. He\u2019s going crazy. He can see why repetition is driving people crazy.\n\u201cAh \u2026 I want to quit.\u201d\nThe Hunter casually sank on the floor of the safe zone.\nAs he caught monsters in a row, his stamina was slightly reduced, so he took out a potion and drank it. Since it was not a high-quality potion, he couldn\u2019t even enjoy the taste.\nHe want to eat something delicious other than this.\nHe want to lie down and watch TV after having a glass of beer with chicken.\nNo, that\u2019s not it. More than that\u2026.\nCome on, let\u2019s not think about it. If you miss what you don\u2019t have, you\u2019ll only feel the tastelessness of the potion.\nWhile he was standing up again to return to the boring work, he noticed a door. It was an ordinary door that was suitable for a family house.\nHe memorized all the topographical features of this dungeon. He has never seen anything like that before\u2026.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, the Hunter decided to surrender to curiosity. Whatever lies beyond, it won\u2019t be as boring as continuing to farm ore in this dungeon.\nHe approached and opened the door with that kind of mind \u2026 and found a cafe. A real cafe.\nThe door led to a cafe outside the dungeon.\n\u201cAh \u2026 where \u2026 how did you get here?\u201d\nThe cafe owner, who seemed to have not expected the appearance of the Hunter, opened her eyes wide. She has a soft impression.\nIt is not uncommon for indeterminate warp gates to occur in dungeons since the flow of irregular ethers randomly intertwines with ethers in other spaces. It\u2019s the first time he saw a gate in the shape of a normal door, and it leads to a cafe outside the dungeon, but\u2026.\nThe Hunter soon realized that he couldn\u2019t get out of the 1 meter radius of the door. However, the distance was enough to order a coffee. Yes, he just wanted to drink a sweet coffee.\nIt was when he returned to the tedious farming work, chewing on pieces of dalgona in his coffee, that the strange change strucked him.\n\u201cEh\u2026.?\u201d\nA monster fell. He felt an incomparable power.\n***\nLesson of the Day: Let\u2019s read the description carefully to the end.\n\u201cKiyaong, you realize that so quickly!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cIt would have been nice if you had thought of that from the moment you awakaned. Tsk tsk tsk, you skipped all the beautiful phrases written by the great system, and now you\u2019re tasting the price of skipping, waeoong!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI put Mieum in front of the heater and put a lot of cereal in her bowl. Fortunately, Mieum did not talk to me anymore as she was chomping and filling her stomach.\nA few days ago, a customer came from the dungeon for the first time through Connect Anywhere\u2606Mysterious Door. Since then, customers from the dungeon have consistently appeared through the door. The place where they originally came from was different.\n\u201cHuh? This is the Dungeon of Banyabong Peak in Jirisan Mountain.\u201d\u201cHey, you guys! Come here and order coffee. Ah, this place? This is Gimcheon.\u201d\u201cHello?\u201d\nThis is what I heard. The door was randomly created in dungeons in various places, and it is said that if you open them, all of them will be connected to the Cafe Rieul.\nJust connected, the person beyond the door could not come in more than a meter. It was also impossible to open the door at Cafe Rieul and go out to a random dungeon.\nNow, let\u2019s re-read the description of \u2018Connect Anywhere\u2606Mysterious Door\u2019.\n(\u203b The official name is a Personal, Space-Connected One-Way Door, but it is serviced with a familiar name to help you understand.)\nIt says \u2018one-way\u2018 in \u2018connected\u2018.\nIt really only connects to one side. Well, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that\u2026\u2026.\nI was puzzled because it\u2019s working in a completely different way from what I had guessed by looking at the name.\nAnyway, a customer is a customer. \nIt\u2019s a little unfair that I installed it excitedly because I got a new item, but it only increased my work.\nI decided to sell coffee to the hunters who appeared through this door. In fact, isn\u2019t fighting in the dungeon the moment when you need recovery coffee the most?\nIn order to process the orders quickly, a \u2018Comfortable Walk-Through Counter\u2019, which was received as an achievement reward, was installed in front of the door. It was a stronger and cleaner counter than the one I made to sell coffee to the fire spirits.\n\u201cKuu \u2026 I can\u2019t get any damage done because of the debuff.\u201d\n\u201cTry this Americano.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe Hunter with their eyes wide open exclaimed \u2018Tasty!\u2019.\nThe door opened again and a Hunter appeared.\n\u201cThe dungeon boss will appear soon, so I want to strengthen my skills.\u201d\n\u201cHmm \u2026 how about this vanilla latte?\u201d\n\u201cYaaay! Critical Hit!\u201d\nJust before the door closes, I can hear the magnificent roar of the boss who was hit by the skill. There\u2019s a lot of noise between the walls.\n\u201cHuu \u2026 even if I continue to pour healing skills, but the recovery is still slow.\u201d\nThis time it was several deeply wounded Hunters. I made several cups of cafe mocha and handed them over.\nIn this way, I also recommended coffee that has an appropriate effect for Hunters. I was proud to see the actual effects of my coffee and the Hunters that like them.\nI\u2019ve worked so hard.\n\u201cEuugh \u2026 uuh\u2026.\u201d\nI soon reached my limit.\nIn addition to the increase in the number of customers, there were many things to pay attention to because the customers came in directly from the dungeon.\nThere was no way it could go on for a long time in this illegitimate way.\n\u201cIs it time to make a decision\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026.?\u201d\nAs Ki Yoohyun suggested before, I should officially register <Cafe Rieul>.\nI didn\u2019t like it because it made me look too much like a Hunter when I registered it formally and claiming \u2018It\u2019s a coffee that has buff effects\u2018.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a Hunter, waeoong!\u201d\nPakpakpak. Heavy front paws flew at me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of feelings, feelings.\u201d\nA secluded cafe that you accidentally stumbled across in front of the dreary Dungeon Gate. A comfortable and cozy time. You feel better after drinking the delicious coffee. All I wanted was something like this.\n\u201cDo you know what kind of traditional fairy tale the world you imagined is\u2026..\u201d\nI heard a sermon from a cat.\n\u201cIt seems hopeless already.\u201d\nAsh, who finished washing a mountain of dishes, said the same thing.\nUnlike the customers I met inside the cafe, it bothered me to see the Hunters fighting in the dungeon through the door. As expected, I want to help what I can help.\nEarlier, a Hunter came through the door with a severe wound. They ran out of potions. I recommended cappuccino, which has a \u201840% stamina recovery\u2018 effect. The Hunter, who quickly recovered after drinking the cappuccino, thanked me.\n\u201cThank you. You saved my life. I will not forget this kindness.\u201d\u201cNo. I already got paid for the coffee.\u201d\u201cEven so, the fact that you have been a great help to me doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\nThe Hunter  bowed then disappeared through the door again. I realized at the same time that I felt proud of this.\nI\u2019m already bad at playing the role of an innkeeper in a beginner\u2019s village, at least in this lifetime\u2026..\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, you made a suggestion before.\u201d\n\u201cAh. You mean the proposal to formally reveal Rieul-ssi\u2019s skill and coffee.\u201d\nThe No. 1 ranker, who seems to have a hobby of drinking coffee in our store, answered.\n\u201cYes, that one. I made up my mind. I\u2019ll accept it.\u201d\nAs soon as I finished speaking, I heard a ringing sound of a cheerful notification.\n[Congratulations! You finally have the mindset of a Cafe Owner.][The condition has been met.In the future, the status window and effect of coffee can be viewed by others.]\n[Achievement: The Mindset of a Cafe OwnerYou were determined to benefit the world with coffee.\nReward: Cold Brew Coffee Recipe]\nNo, I didn\u2019t make such a grandiose decision\u2026.\nI was perplexed at the grand expression.\nUnless they had a special skill like Ki Yoohyun, I was the only one who could see the accurate status window of the coffee I made. Others just feel the effects with their bodies. But now, if other people can see the coffee status window, more accurate information will be delivered.\nSince then, the administrative process has proceeded without major obstacles. Ki Yoohyun also helped a lot.\nIt was quickly approved as a Hunter-based special business with a piece of paperwork and a due diligence showing the actual coffee making. In consideration of the echo of the birth of the unique potion that has never been seen before, an official announcement date for releasing the embossing was set.\nAnd the day before the official announcement,\nI was grinding a lot of coffee beans.\n***\nSoon, it will be the first day that Cafe Rieul, which has been officially registered as a special business, will take its first step.\nIt would be nice to have a new menu since it\u2019s been a while. With that in mind, I decided to prepare the most recently obtained recipe, Cold Brew Coffee.\nThere was also an intention that once the undiluted solution was made, it could be diluted and sold quickly.\nIf it was a small roaster that I used before,mI would have given up because it was cumbersome to prepare a lot of coffee beans, but now it is worth doing it because there is a fully automatic large roaster for businesses.\nI went into the space and moved the beans from the bean storage bag. Then, I put green beans in the roaster and lit them. It was a \u2018completely automatic\u2018 structure that was completed on its own where the result was put into the storage box.\nIn the meantime, this space has developed a lot.\n\u2018Shoo, shoo, shook, shook.\u2019\nI just planted it, but the tooth carrot that grew well on its own was biting hard again today.\nNext to it was the place where the suspicious seeds received from Lee Chorok were planted, but they have not sprouted yet.\n\u2018Those carrots don\u2019t suck up all the nutrients, right\u2026.?\u2019\nI\u2019ve put in a lot of crops and machines in this space.\n\u201cMmmmmeh!\u201d\nYeah, there\u2019s a cow too.\nI stroked the snorting cow as if not to leave her out. Perhaps because I wasn\u2019t with Lime, the cow showed an unpleasant reaction.\nThe cow has yet to be named. I can\u2019t come up with a name that fits perfectly. Let\u2019s think about it more slowly.\nAnyway, the coffee beans brought to the store were ground thickly into the size of thick salt. After putting a filter in a large container, I poured the coffee bean powder and cold water, then I mixed it well.\n[Item: Cold Brew Coffee extract (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)Status: ExtractingTime Remaining: 12:00:00]\nThe next morning, just 12 hours later, the extract was filtered through a filter to be completed.\nI tried making cold brew coffee right away by adding water and ice.\n[Item: Cold Brew (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 01:00:00)Effect: Get a random percentage of one random buff effect.]\nOh. Both types and amounts of buff effects were random. It\u2019s like we\u2019re doing a lucky draw.\nThis new menu will cause a bigger sensation than I thought.\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c105": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nI opened the window.\nThe cold wind blew in relentlessly. The stone wall of the Great Dungeon Abyss, which always looks dreary, greeted my eyes. It is still the same lonely view where there is no convenience store nearby. The store was well-located in the desolate 16th Street, Dungeon Gate 3.\nThis is my morning routine these days. Due to the incident where the entire store was taken to the dungeon a few days ago, the immobility of this property has been my concern. \nSure, I met Cthugha and Pepe, solved the milk problem, and thanks to the fish I received from the spirits, I\u2019ve had plenty of fish for several days\u2026..\nI gained a lot, but I didn\u2019t want to go through the same thing again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u2026\u201d\nAsh, who just woke up in the morning, opened the door and complained in a sullen voice. I quickly closed the road window and turned up the heater.\n\u201cEh, are you cold? I\u2019m sorry. Right, Ash is weak, so you shouldn\u2019t catch a cold. Sit in front of the heater.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.I\u2019m not that weak.\u201d\nAlthough he tried to pretend otherwise, Ash did not avoid the heater. What a dishonest fellow.\n\u201cUnyaaa\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu\u2026..\u201d\nIn the warmest place, Mieum and Lime were already stretched their bodies.\nIt\u2019s really winter now.\nThere was also one more thing I got from the dungeon. It is the \u2018Connect Anywhere \u2606 Mysterious Door\u2018.\nThe name is intuitive, it\u2019s easy to understand even for me . It means that I can connect anywhere through this door. I was curious when I received this as the quest reward, but I was busy with camping. I finally managed to bring it up now.\n[Item: Connect Anywhere \u2606 Mysterious Door (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)(\u203b The official name is a Personal, Space-Connected One-Way Door, but it is serviced with a familiar name to help you understand.)It connects anywhere.It can be installed inside the cafe. Please pay attention to the direction when installing.]\n[Choose the location where you want to install the Mysterious Door and select \u201cInstall\u201c]\nI took out the door from my inventory and selected a suitable blank wall I had previewed. A message soon came up.\n[Do you want to install the Mysterious Door?Yes \u261c / No]\n[Installing the Mysterious Door. Progress: 0%][Installing the Mysterious Door. Progress: 0.01%]\n\u2026\u2026.\n[Installing the Mysterious Door. Progress: 0.02%]\nIt was surprisingly slow. I feel like I\u2019m going to explode if I wait for the installation to finish.\nI can\u2019t. I\u2019m busy preparing for the opening of the cafe after breakfast, so I\u2019ll check it again after the business is over.\nAfter preparing for sales, I opened the door on time. Soon, customers with faces that lacked caffeine opened the door and rushed in.\n\u201cWelcome. Have you decided on your order?\u201d\nThus, the usual day began.\nThere are still many problems and concerns, but I am planning to spend a day faithful to my main job today. My main job is a Cafe Owner. If I continue caring about dungeon or whatever it is, I might as well lose my job.\n\u201cIf you feel cold, I recommend this new menu, Irish coffee.\u201d\nMundane life is precious\u2026\u2026.\nIf there was one thing I was wondering about, it was Ash\u2019s behavior.\nAsh, he is so\u2026.\n\u201cAh, I need to wipe the table \u2026 huh?\u201d\nThe table was already sparkling without a speck of dust.\n\u201cThen I have to wash the dishes \u2026 huh?\u201d\nAsh, who had just finished washing the stacked dishes, wiped the water off his hands.\n\u201cAh, that customer left his phone. I have to catch up and bring it to him \u2026 Huh, Kim Ash, where are you going?\u201d\nAsh, who hurriedly ran, returned the phone to its owner and came back to the store.\n\u201cAsh, let\u2019s get some rest now.\u201d\n\u201cI need to do this.\u201d\n\u2026 he worked too hard.\nOriginally, he was a genius part-timer, but today he moved quickly as if he were using cloning magic. The order was processed quickly, but I was worried that he might collapse.\n\u201cAsh, come here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nTaking advantage of the temporary absence of customers, I half-forced Ash to sit in the chair. I put Lime on his lap and gave him snacks and coffee to completely block his action.\nHowever, while eating a the apple jam cookie that I served as a snack, Ash flinched and looked toward the counter.\nNo way\u2026 is our part-time a workaholic?\nI can\u2019t let this happen. Workaholic is an incurable disease. To feel joy while jumping into the swamp of labor on his own, I couldn\u2019t let Ash be afflicted with such a terrifying disease.\n\u201cAsh, I\u2019m going to work alone today, so would you like to rest? Right, how about contacting Shinwoo and Shinhee? They must have missed you too.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.you don\u2019t need me?\u201d\nNo, why does the conversation end up like that?\nAlthough I explained that it was not the case, Ash still had a serious expression on his face. He poked the apple jam cookies with his fork for a moment before finally opening his mouth again.\n\u201cIf I do all the work by myself \u2026 you\u2019re not going to hire a new part-timer.\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t have plans to find a new part-timer?\u201d\nHaving Ash here is already enough, and there\u2019s no way I can easily get it just because I want to.\n\u201cWhat about the guy from before?\u201d\n\u201cWho? Ah, you mean Yichan?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nHe nodded his head suspiciously. He must have heard that Choi Yichan used to be a temporary part-timer.\nAside from the fact that Choi Yichan was a terrible cafe part-timer, his part-time job was almost dedicated to play with the animals.\nChoi Yichan is currently being held by the Dungeon Management Office. The renewal of the Hunter\u2019s rank and the ranking measurement were completed, but there were several procedures left.\nBecause of that, I haven\u2019t heard what he was going to say yet.\n\u201cHey, Yichan doesn\u2019t work part-time here. There was a special situation before. Why would an S-class Hunter have a part-time job here?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.I see.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as long as I have Ash, it\u2019s already enough. Still, let\u2019s take it easy.\u201d\n\u201cKeu-ahemm! I can\u2019t help it if you say that.\u201d\nAsh ate the apple jam cookie. He pretended not to, but I saw the corners of his mouth rising slowly.\nThen the door opened again and a customer came in.\nI told Ash that he shouldn\u2019t get up until he ate all the snacks and headed for the counter. Behind my back, I could hear the animals aiming for the cookie crumbs and Ash fighting to defend his plate.\n\u201cWelcome.\u201d\nThe customer was a regular who often came to our store for coffee.\n\u201cHello. I came yesterday too, but it was a pity that the cafe wasn\u2019t open yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha\u2026.\u201d\nI was actually a little worried about this.\nThe business has been going well lately, so there must have been customers who came when I was dragged into the dungeon. Then, they must have seen the whole store gone.\nHow am I supposed to explain the situation where the entire store disappeared and then reappeared? Am I allowed to say that I was summoned to the Dungeon and then returned?\nShould I say that the building was demolished in a day and rebuilt in a day?\nIt\u2019s unbelievable\u2026..\nHowever, the regular customer said this in a casual tone after completing the order.\n\u201cI heard the building was being repaired? Are the repairs finished?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Ah, yes, yes! It\u2019s done.\u201d\nThe ensuing customers had similar reactions.\n\u201cOld houses always have problems one by one.\u201d\u201cIn my house, the boiler always explodes in the winter.\u201d\u201cI heard the water pipe was broken? I know a good repair shop, do you want me to introduce it to you?\u201d\nWhat\u2019s going on here\u2026.\nWhile the store disappeared, all the customers knew that the building\u2019s water pipe had burst, so the cafe was temporarily closed.\nSomeone who has the ability to do this \u2026 there is only one person.\nTinkle, the door opened with the sound of a bell, and that one person came inside. It was Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cHello.\u201d\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, what did you do while I was away?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d\n\u201cThe customers thought our water pipe had burst.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Ah. Yes, I thought the problem would get bigger, so I slightly tweaked it.\u201d\nAccording to Ki Yoohyun, this was his reasoning: it was quite rare for a building to disappear without a rift. In order to prevent the repercussion, he used his skill in the empty space where the store disappeared to create a large-scale optical illusion effect.\nThe effect was to show the illusion of a store with a sign on its door that said, \u201cWe take a break due to building maintenance issues\u201d to those who approached the store. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a simple trick. It doesn\u2019t work for a hunter who\u2019s stronger than me.\u201d\nBut at least in Korea, a Hunter who is stronger than Ki Yoohyun\u2026..\n\u2026 there is none.\nAt first glance, it seems quite amazing to be able to say, \u201cI slightly tweaked it\u201c.\nAnyway, I\u2019m thankful that I avoided the troublesome things.\nAs a token of appreciation, I decided to treat him to coffee. Since I turned on the heater, the indoor air was warm, so I wanted to drink a cold drink. I made two iced Americanos and took Ki Yoohyun to a table in the corner.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been curious about something for a long time.\u201d\nI moistened my throat with cold coffee, then I stared at the regressor and the No. 1 Ranker in front of me. He also took a sip of coffee and made eye contact with me.\n\u201cDo you remember when we first met? When Yoohyun-ssi was standing in front of me with a very suspicious appearance.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026. did I look suspicious?\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Then, did you think that you\u2019re not suspicious at all until now?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nWe were briefly shocked for our own reasons.\n\u201cAh, anyway, when Yoohyun-ssi came, I was temporarily unable to open the system window.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun rolled his eyes. He took a sip of the iced Americano slowly. It was the reaction of a person who was obviously did something wrong.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you really blocked someone else\u2019s system window?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s not it.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun hurriedly waved his hand.\n\u201cNo matter what, I do not have that ability. The system is a unique area of each hunter and cannot be easily invaded. It\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYou did something.\u201d\n\u201cIn order to find out information about Rieul-ssi and this building, I spread the white light net\u2026.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, startled by my expression, blurted out his words. He shrugged his shoulders and let out a helpless laugh.\n\u201cLook, please. I told you I\u2019m a regressor. This place was an abandoned house before the regression. I had no choice but to doubt the part that had changed from the past..\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 I see. Why has it changed, ahaha\u2026.\u201d\nI lifted my coffee cup and hid my awkward smile.\n\u201cIn that case, this is the possibility I can think of. The system may have voluntarily blocked it to keep any information about Rieul-ssi or this store from me.\u201d\n\u201cIs it possible for the system to do that \u2026 No, it\u2019s possible, yes.\u201d\nI thought of the Saintess and immediately agreed.\nThe Saintess said she created system. It was plausible, considering her mysterious power and her tendency to intervene arbitrarily.\nThen, I suddenly thought of my uncle.\nAs soon as he returned from the dungeon, Kwon Jiwoon investigated the disappearance of Uncle\u2019s ability. The result has not changed. The uncle\u2019s ability disappeared and his system window was completely inaccessible.\nHowever, is it possible for an Awakened to become a normal person completely, not something caused by debuffs or abnormal conditions?\nIf Ki Yoohyun\u2019s hypothesis is correct\u2026.\nThere is a possibility that the connection between my uncle and the system window was cut off to avoid someone\u2019s surveillance.\nIn addition, he knew about Cthugha\u2019s ring \u2026 what on earth have you been up to, Uncle?\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t my uncle know more about my grandmother?\u2019\nEver since I met Cthugha, I\u2019ve been thinking about finding out more about my grandmother.\nWith that thought in mind, I sent my uncle a Kakaotalk message saying that I would like to see him, but\u2026.\n\n[Uncle] (MountainLife-Vlog) Healing Life in the Mountains After Retirement: Act 2 of Lifehttps://youtu.be/******\n[Me]What is this?\n[Uncle]Niece!

            "c104": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nPage Ten: Cafe Rieul is Always With You\n\nThe guild leader\u2019s office located on the top floor of The White Silver Guild.\nA few days ago, the guild leader was suddenly replaced, so the place was still untidy. The staff announced the arrival of the visitor with a knock.\nKwon Jiwoon, who headed to the drawing room, leaned deeply on the sofa and looked at the visitor.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? The friend of my sister, and my friend now.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Hello.\u201d\nChoi Yichan bowed his head.\n\nChoi Yichan, who had been held captive by the Dungeon Management Office for a full week, was finally released yesterday, and the ranking was updated.\nRanked 6th on his first registration. It was a phenomenal result.\nKwon Jiwoon slightly frowned as he recalled that his ranking had fallen by a notch thanks to that. He wasn\u2019t obsessed with the Hunter rankings, but it didn\u2019t feel good to lose the ranking he had maintained for a long time.\n\u201cI heard you\u2019re recruiting Hunters here.\u201d\n\u201cI heard the general story. The reason why Hunter Choi Yichan said he wanted to meet me this early in the morning. Our staff ran out of breath to inform me after you contacted us.\u201d\n\u201cThen, could you accept me into the guild?\u201d\nChoi Yichan, who immediately brought up the main point, was still in a daze. Kwon Jiwoon lifted the tea cup on the table, moistened his throat, and opened his mouth slowly.\n\u201cBefore that, I want to ask you something. What is the benefit for Hunter Choi Yichan to join The White Silver Guild?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know each other, so let\u2019s be more honest. Currently, The White Silver Guild has little real power compared to its past fame.\u201d\nThe words that followed revealed difficulties that could not be hidden.\n\u201cMy father \u2026 haa, he can\u2019t just throw everything at me \u2026 he told me that he wanted to appear on \u2018I am a Natural Person\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cHa, haha\u2026.\u201d\nThinking it was a joke to lighten the mood, Choi Yihan tried to laugh. However, he had no choice but stop laughing when he saw Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s expression.\nThat troubled look.\nHe\u2019s serious\u2026.\nHe\u2019s truly glad that his father, who has been missing for years, has returned. However, as a result, Kwon Jiwoon had one more headache.\nHe urged him to meet Kwon Rieul in a hurry, but when they returned from the dungeon, he disappeared with only the words that he would return to their hometown this time.\nIt seems like he has a plan based on his meaningful tone.\nDoes he \u2026 is that the case?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s thinking\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Yichan offered silent consolation.\n\u201cAhem, hm. I\u2019m ashamed to say this since it\u2019s an internal affair, but our guild is in a situation where a lot of people are missing and we have to rebuild the guild from scratch. It is difficult to treat Hunter Choi Yichan appropriately for his abilities.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. That kind of thing\u2026.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon\u2019s words continued even before Choi Yichan could say anything.\n\u201cAs far as I know, Hunter Ju Noeul contacted you. Although she looks carefree on the outside, she leads her guild with integrity. Won\u2019t you like their terms better?\u201d\n\u201cShe \u2026 I met her yesterday and refused.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon sighed inwardly.\nNo wonder \u2018Lime Love Team\u2018 kept writing depressing things on Hunter Channel this morning, so this was the reason.\n\u201cWhat about Cheongna? Coincidentally, I\u2019m close with Hunter Han Yiseong. It\u2019s a high-class guild.\u201d\n\u201cI have no intention of going there.\u201d\nHoo. That\u2019s an unexpectedly firm tone.\nKwon Jiwoon rested his chin on his hand. A crooked smile is hidden in the palm of his hand.\nNaturally, the sight he saw a few days ago came to mind. The day he returned with his younger sister from the Garden of the Eternal Living Flame, Cthugha.\nThe man who caught Kwon Rieul, Ki Yoohyun.\nWhen he saw him before, he couldn\u2019t look at it properly because he didn\u2019t have much time, but he looked very close to Rieul.\nIt also reminds him of Choi Yichan\u2019s expression when he saw them.\n\u2018It\u2019s easy to understand.\u2019\nNow, Kwon Jiwoon found his position both funny and unpleasant. He chose the last words to conclude the interview. The displeasure on his face was not completely hidden.\n\u201cI think you already know that I care a lot about my younger sister, Rieul, even if I don\u2019t say it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Yes.\u201d\nChoi Yichan nodded slightly.\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I will meddle in my sister\u2019s relationships. Whatever happens, I won\u2019t do it. If Rieul likes it, then I\u2026.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon swallowed his breath for a moment. That\u2019s what he said, but it was not a good feeling to have someone hanging around his younger sister. With a sigh, he spat out his irritation and continued.\n\u201c\u2026..I will accept it no matter who it is.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to join this guild because I\u2019m the family of Kwon Rieul, it means you should go home because you offended me, Hunter Choi Yichan.\u201d\nChoi Yichan was silent for a moment.\nHe was wondering if there was anything important to ask for a meeting this early in the morning, but it was a waste of time. He was about to raise his body and tell him to get things sorted out, but then Choi Yichan opened his mouth again.\n\u201cEven if the person is Muwon?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon looked at Choi Yichan quietly without even moving.\n\u201cHaha, you\u2019re not surprised.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I was surprised \u2026 that Hunter Choi Yichan knows about it.\u201d\nHan Yiseong did not directly reveal Muwon\u2019s identity to Kwon Jiwoon. He didn\u2019t even think about digging the information.\nHowever, there are things that you naturally notice when you interact for a long time. For example, things like the identity of the Hunter that Han Yiseong is particularly concerned about.\nIt was only a vague guess, but he just became convinced.\nThe reason he pretended not to know the obvious was simple. This is because all Hunters of the current generation feel a sense of debt to Muwon to some extent.\nKwon Jiwoon recalled an incident from long ago. It happened not long after he awakened.\nAn A-Grade rift broke out in the middle of downtown Changwon. Of course, it\u2019s a contingency.\nIt was also the day Kwon Jiwoon experienced his first real fight. It was harder than the thought to treat a person who was pouring blood in critical condition. Far from being proud of having fulfilled his mission, he just wanted to run away.\nThen, someone shouted, \u2018We\u2019re alive now!\u2019. He was going to ask \u2018what nonsense are you talking about when the situation is so serious?\u2018, but when he looked up, he was there.\nIt was far away, but it was clearly visible. It was the sight of only one person repairing the distorted and twisted space with a net of light and returning it to its original form.\nHe vividly remembers the emotions he felt that day.\nA feeling of inferiority, longing, jealousy, goodwill \u2026 there is a sense of indebtedness at the base of the countless emotions toward Muwon.\nTherefore, it\u2019s worth showing his loyalty by preventing that person\u2019s identity from being revealed in a form he doesn\u2019t wish for.\nIt wasn\u2019t difficult for Kwon Jiwoon to read the still intact boundary in the quiet man in front of him. Then, how did this newly awakened S-class learn about Muwon\u2019s identity and become wary of him?\n\u201cHe, that person, Muwon, will be the one who will resurrect the demon of the Great Dungeon Abyss.\u201d\nThe conversation jumped into a ridiculous place. The strongest Hunter in existence resurrects the Demon? That sounds unreasonable.\nKwon Jiwoon slightly narrowed his eyes and spoke.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to speak ill of your rival.\u201d\nAbyss is a large dungeon in the form of a tower divided into several floors. The hypothesis that something scary is asleep on the top floor has been around for a long time. However, the current generation of Hunters simply do not have the power to reach the end yet.\nHow far did the attacking progress go \u2026 he was in the middle of estimating it in his head.\n\u201cIf The White Silver is just a small guild, as the guild leader said, why did C&L aim for The White Silver in the first place?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026you know something.\u201d\n\u201cMore than the guild leader thinks. For example, there must be an old artifact in The White Silver that hasn\u2019t been unsealed yet.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nIt was unpleasant for an outsider to mention the internal circumstances of the guild.\nKwon Jiwoon rested his hand on chin again. This time, the hardened mouth was hidden in his plan.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Hunter Choi Yichan an S-class Berserker? Detection \u2026 no, do you have a prophecy skill?\u201d\n\u201cYou can meet a prophet.\u201d\nHis eyes are full of conviction. There must be something.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in occult. Hunter Choi Yichan, be careful if anyone sells amulets or jars.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Haha.\u201d\nChoi Yichan grabbed the pendant around his neck.\nThe small black stone sparkled exceptionally and stood out on the edge of his neck. He traced the shape of the black stone with his thumb and thought for a moment, as if it was an important object.\n\u201cWhen I was young, I was caught in a rift. The person who saved me was Hunter Kwon Seokmin. I have always thought that if I became a Hunter, I would definitely return the favor.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cYou look like you don\u2019t believe me at all.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it too coincidental to bring the story up now?\u201d\nChoi Yichan shyly scratched the back of his head.\n\u201cHaha, really. I want to join the guild to repay his kindness, so you can think about it that way.\u201d\n\u201cDuring the week when Hunter Choi Yichan memorizes the new awakening safety rules at the Dungeon Management Office,\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nChoi Yichan\u2019s face darkened when he recalled the time of hardship.\n\u201cI did some research on my father\u2019s condition. The cause is unknown, but it\u2019s true that the ability has disappeared. My father \u2026 is really a natural man \u2026 No, he wants to retire, so he wouldn\u2019t think that he\u2019s done a favor to Hunter Choi Yichan.\u201d\nIn other words, don\u2019t try to persuade him and just tell the real reason.\nChoi Yichan put down the hand that was touching the pendant. As if the conversation so far had only been an introduction, his expression became even more serious.\n\u201cAt least I want you to know that I\u2019m saying this in favor of you, guild leader.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAt this rate, Kwon Rieul\u2019s life will be in danger.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon\u2019s face hardened fiercely.\n\n\nprevious\nnext\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Cornner:\nI LOVE EVERYTHING IN THIS CHAPTER BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IS KWON JIWOON\u2019S HUNCHAN NICKNAME??? he even knew Ju Noeul\u2019s cyber identity\u2013 \nah sorry for the late update, it\u2019s raining a lot the last two days and they turn off the electricity many times because of that \u2026 how\u2019s the weather in your place? \nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c103": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nI caught hold of the hand in the nick of time. It was a cold, soft hand.\nI couldn\u2019t see anything in the dark, but the boy walked with my hand in his hand as if he knew the way. The soft light surrounding the boy\u2019s body leads me.\nIs it because of that light? My mind was strangely calm and I wasn\u2019t scared anymore. I felt a slight warmth through my palms.\nIt\u2019s a lot smaller, but that steady walk\u2026.\nAs expected, they look alike.\n\u201cHey, do you have a brother?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr a relative. He\u2019s about this tall, don\u2019t you know someone who looks a lot like you?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe boy was still silent.\nCan I trust and follow this boy? Maybe he\u2019s pretending to help me like this, then he will lock me up here?\nIt was a situation where such doubt would remain.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nOur eyes met.\nIt was hard to explain in words, but I felt that I could trust this boy. I held the boy\u2019s hand and silently followed him.\nThe lost path of light reappeared. The glistening light moved quickly and formed a path. At the end of the path, there was an exit.\n\u201cOkay, I can finally get out of here! Boy, you \u2026 huh\u2026.?\u201d\nI was startled when I turned my head. I was definitely holding the boy\u2019s hand tightly until just now, yet the boy\u2019s figure was nowhere to be seen.\nA bright light surrounded me, and I felt like my body was being sucked into somewhere.\n***\nThe view became bright in an instant.\nThe first thing I saw was the high stone wall of the Great Dungeon Abyss. I could feel the cold air. The dry, chilly wind of early winter knocked on my cheeks. My eyes are blinded by the clear morning sun. It was a change that  made the memory of being in a midsummer night\u2019s dungeon a while ago felt like a dream.\nNext, as promised, I saw the store building, which arrived first and was well placed in its original place.\nThank God. Everyone except me seems to have arrived safely. In front of the store, I could clearly see the faces of the group looking up at me.\nWait. Why are they looking up at me?\nI felt a sense of freedom in my feet. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m floating in the air\u2026.\n\u201cWhoa, uaaaaah\u2026..!\u201d\nTiling!\n[The connection will be reset. 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 \u2026 100. Done.]\n[Achievement: Light up the DarknessCongratulations!You were on the verge of getting lost by the bad \u00b4\u00cf\u00be\u00cb\u00b6\u00f3\u00c5\u00e4\u00c5\u00dc, but you returned safely.Who was it that guided you?Reward: Comfortable Walk-Through Counter (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)]\nThere was no time to carefully read the status window that appeared in front of me.\nThe point where I appeared was the air a little above the roof of the store. For now, I was floating as if I was not affected by gravity, but my body was about to plummet down.\nDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s been a lot of falling incident since I awakened? How many times have I done this already?\n\u201c\u2026.Uhh!\u201d\nI swallowed a scream. I felt my body going down.\nLet\u2019s stay calm. Now I\u2019m an expert in falling.\n\u2018The Bond of a Cup of Coffee!\u2019\nIt was the moment I was about to use Choi Yichan\u2019s defense skills that I copied straight away.\nThe falling body floated up again. A thin net of light that was barely visible wrapped around my body and held me up so that I wouldn\u2019t plummet to the ground.\nI have seen this skill many times already. I called the name of the person who used the skill out loud. Even though it had only been two days since we met, I was extremely happy.\n\u201c\u2026.Yoohyun-ssi!\u201d\nMy body, wrapped in the net of light, slowly descended. Just before my feet touched the ground, Ki Yoohyun reached out his arm to hold me.\nI stared at Ki Yoohyun for a while in that position. My eyes were still dazzled as I suddenly came out into bright place, but I could clearly see the eyes under the shadowed eyelashes. He looks surprised.\nThe soft hair blowing in the wind and those white cheeks really suited Ki Yoohyun.\nAs I was doing it for a long time, Ki Yoohyun secretly avoided my gaze. A soft word followed.\n\u201cI was surprised. I received a call, so I came to see what happened, and the building disappeared and appeared again. Rieul-ssi fell from the sky\u2026.\u201d\nI was very surprised, too. My heart is still pounding.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot of incidents.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to \u2026. more than that, are you really Yoohyun-ssi?\u201d\n\u201cDo I even have a fake?\u201d\nHe looked puzzled.\n\u201cDo you have a younger brother with a big age difference\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any brothers.\u201d\n\u201cThen\u2026..\u201d\nIt was a time when I went back to my memory to describe in more detail the boy who took me out of the path of stars.\n\u201cAhem, hmm, hmm!\u201d\nA coughing sound came from behind. It was Kwon Jiwoon. He was deliberately making exaggerated sounds as if he wanted it to be heard.\nIt looked awfully awkward. It is fortunate that Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s job is a Hunter. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any talent for acting.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\nWhen I just stared at him, he covered his mouth with his hand and coughed loudly this time.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nOnly then did I realize that I was too close to Ki Yoohyun in front of others.\nAs Ki Yoohyun caught my falling body, I was half-hugged. Our faces were close. My arm wrapped around Ki Yoohyun\u2019s shoulder, and Ki Yoohyun\u2019s arm supported my back and waist. If I tilted my head a little more, I could hear the sound of breathing.\n\u201cThat, hey, Yoohyun-ssi, your arm\u2026.\u201d\nWhen I panicked, Ki Yoohyun immediately loosened his arm. I dropped my body quickly.\nKwon Jiwoon, who approached with a frown on his forehead, asked.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nAccording to Kwon Jiwoon, others returned through the path of stars without any problems. The time I disappeared was less than seconds, even though the time felt much longer for me. When they arrived, they noticed that I was invisible, and soon I appeared from the sky.\nUmh\u2026.\nI checked the system window that just popped up again.\nSome letters were broken and unreadable, but the nuance that someone interfered with me was clear. That\u2019s all, no more information. Only unanswered questions piled up one after another.\n\u2018Give me some hints and then ask me to guess\u2026.\u2019\nCould it be the crazy pseudo-religious man from last time? There was no evidence, but the eyes caught up in the madness were enough to make this speculation.\nWhen I thought of him, I felt both uneasy and resentful at the same time.\nWhy only me?!\nI felt like my life is gradually flowing in a different direction from my goal.\nMaybe it\u2019s already went to that direction a long time ago, and I only realized it too late?\nIt seems likely. I shuddered at the frightening possibility.\n\u201c\u2026.Rieul-ah.\u201d\nThis time, Choi Yichan came close to me.\n\u201cDo you have a second? I have something to say\u2026.\u201d\nAlthough he said so, Choi Yichan\u2019s eyes were not on me, but on Ki Yoohyun next to me.\nOh. The two are seeing each other for the first time. Even when Choi Yichan had a temporary part-time job here, the time was different from when Ki Yoohyun visited.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Choi Yichan\u2019s shoulders drooped and his expression remained stiff. I spoke in a bright voice on purpose.\n\u201cAh! Yichan-ah, it\u2019s your first time seeing him, right? This is Ki Yoohyun, he\u2019s a Hunter from Cheongna. Yoohyun-ssi, as you probably know, this is\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cOf course I know. Choi Yichan, the S-Class Hunter. Nice to meet you.\u201d\nWith a smile, Ki Yoohyun held out his hand first.\nHowever, Choi Yichan did not accept the hand. He only looked at Ki Yoohyun with a serious expression.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence followed by a slight tension.\n\u201cYichan-ah?\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ah, wait\u2026.\u201d\nIt was the moment when Choi Yichan was about to say something,\n\u201cTeam leader! There he is, we found him! Hunter Choi Yichan!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t miss him this time. Let\u2019s go together.\u201d\nGovernment officials appeared from somewhere and surrounded Choi Yichan. It was Hunter Kang Hyunwoo and Kim Jina. This time, they were firmly armed with the determination not to miss this wild S-Class Hunter.\nIt hasn\u2019t been ten minutes since we came back here. How did they get here so fast? They have an amazing information source.\n\u201cYou came all the way here, how did you know?\u201d\nHunter Kang Hyunwoo answered with shining eyes.\n\u201cI heard the news that Choi Yichan Hunter appeared in The White Silver Guild. So, I thought the only place where he would appear next was here, Cafe Rieul.\u201d\nDid he go undercover?\n\u201cHeugh, I can finally go home and sleep today \u2026 I kept crouching down, and my turtle neck came back.\u201d\nHe really went undercover.\u2026.\nLooking at them carefully, the public officials were dressed in a sense of hardship. The area under the eyes looked hollow.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take long. Please listen to us.\u201d\nHowever, Choi Yichan waved his hand with a troubled expression.\n\u201cUh, wait, I need to talk to her for a moment \u2026 I have something to say to Rieul-ah.\u201d\n\u201cYes, as much as you like. I\u2019ll be waiting here, so you can take your time.\u201d\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve been waiting so far, but we can wait a little longer. Although the deadline for updating the measurement ranking is today \u2026 if we\u2019re late, we\u2019ll be called in by the Director again\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHa, haha\u2026.\u201d\nIt\u2019s incredibly burdensome.\nIt was hard to ignore the eyes of public officials who were watching Choi Yichan just one step away in case they missed him. It would be even more burdening since it was Choi Yichan, who enjoys helping others. In the end, Choi Yichan dropped his shoulders.\n\u201cSorry \u2026 I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\u201cYes, go with them. I\u2019ll hear what you want to tell me when you get back.\u201d\nThe incident of flying the entire store to the dungeon ended with Choi Yichan got arrested by the Dungeon Management Office.\nI waved my hand at Choi Yichan\u2019s back as he was helplessly moving away.\n***\nKorea\u2019s No. 1 Hunter Community \u2013 Hunter Channel.\nFree Forum Board.\n\u2014 Ranking, The Slave Hunters Guild is banned.

It\u2019s like pro gamers, the super-advanced players who show outstanding skills as if they are playing in the sky (hence, celestial realm). In this case, the OP was saying the ranking update doesn\u2019t really affect anything other than the top rankers world.Jonbeo: (\uc874\ubc84) an abbreviation of \u201cto hold out as fuck\u201d, which means to persevere no matter what difficulties may come and hold out \u201cuntil the better day comes.\u201d Used to describe mindsets similar to\u00a0\u201csticking until the end\u201d or \u201clast man standing\u201d.\nSorry this was supposed to be posted yesterday but I just found out that the formatting that I use for the internet forum can\u2019t be done on phone, so I went to the library today.

            "c102": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cOh, are you looking for me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re nowhere to be seen.\u201d\n\u201cI was just talking to Cedric for a minute.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Ah.\u201d\nChoi Yichan glanced toward the bonfire.\n\nChoi Cedric had already returned. All that\u2019s left is traces of a bonfire that\u2019s completely extinguished.\nA sharp light hovered in Choi Yichan\u2019s eyes, barely visible, then it melted in his smile and disappeared.\n\u201cChoi Cedric from C&L, he is that person. Are you close to him?\u201d\nI know his contact number, but our relationship is not to the extent of exchanging personal contact. We got caught up in the Monster Hell together, but it was a coincidence. I helped him in saving the Blue Celaeno flower, but that\u2019s all.\nIt\u2019s a bit strange to say that we\u2019re close, but it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know each other. I gave an ambiguous answer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, well \u2026 we know each other. Today, we met here by chance.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.I see.\u201d\nWe walked along the dark beach for a while. This quiet man is unfamiliar.\nWhile looking at the crashing white waves for a while, Choi Yichan suddenly opened his mouth.\n\u201cHey, Kwon Ri, maybe this is excessive solicitude.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better be careful. Uh, that, C&L.\u201d\nI stopped walking and looked up at Choi Yichan. He said that with cautious tone, but his expression was serious.\n\u201c\u2026Is it because of their involvement with The White Silver?\u201d\nThe Dungeon Management Office was investigating C&L due to allegations that C&L Corporation tried to merge The White Silver Guild in a hostile manner, as well as the last Long-tailed Phoenix case. I didn\u2019t hear about the situation from Kwon Jiwoon in detail, but I think it will be concluded soon with the confession of the arrogant old man and Park Heeyoung, whom I met in The White Silver Guild.\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s that, too.\u201d\nIn other words, that\u2019s not all.\nHowever, Choi Yichan didn\u2019t say anything more and just smiled.\nAlthough Choi Cedric may not have been directly involved in the circumstances involving C&L and The White Silver Guild, I don\u2019t believe that he is completely unrelated. I wasn\u2019t that optimistic.\nThe reason why Choi Cedric was being stuck in a corner instead of participating in the improvised camping trip must be because he was uncomfortable with Kwon Jiwoon. Considering that he did something useless like that, he has a better personality compared to his image.\nStill, I didn\u2019t have the heart to pretend I didn\u2019t see Choi Cedric, who gave the \u2018I\u2019m depressed\u2019 look.\nI guess I\u2019m a bit of an mediocre person.\nWe walked slowly toward the campsite.\n\u201cYichan-ah, I heard you saved my uncle? \u2026. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh, no! I just happened to \u2026 Kwon Ri, I\u2019m glad I was helpful to you.\u201d\nChoi Yichan waved his hand in embarrassment. His earlobes are slightly red.\nThe way he didn\u2019t know what to do even when he heard obvious things was really like the Choi Yichan I know. Seeing that, I felt relieved without even realizing it.\n\u201cWell, are you done with your training? You said, \u2018I will come back stronger.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Yichan thought for a moment, then he replied in a determined tone.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s over. Now I have to move on to the next level.\u201d\n\u201cNext level?\u201d\n\u201cUh, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWaeooolg!\u201d\nAt the moment Choi Yichan tried to say something again, Mieum and Lime popped out in front of us. Mieum was holding her toy, the sugarcane leaf, in her mouth.\nAs a result, the conversation was naturally cut off.\n\u201cWaeuung, waeoooong (Big man, I\u2019ll give you the right to play with me)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuuuu!\u201d\n\u201cAhahaha, yes, all right. Wait a minute.\u201d\nFollowing Choi Yichan\u2019s gesture, Mieum and Lime jumped up and down. They looked excited because someone who played well came.\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother Yichan too much.\u201d\n\u201cKyayakyakyak!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu!\u201d\nThey\u2019re not listening at all.\n\u201cWhere \u2026 are you going. Leave me alone\u2026.\u201d\nAs I turned my head to the lackluster voice, I saw Ash taking a commemorative photo between Ju Noeul and my uncle. Ash\u2019s face was full of fatigue.\nIt seems that the environment was too Inssa-like for our delicate part-timer to endure.\n***\nThe next night.\nA twinkling star appeared in the dark night sky. A gate appeared on the white sandy beach sprinkled with starlight.\nThis is the path of the stars that Cthugha said.\nIt was time to go back home. Although this beach was very beautiful, a dungeon is a dungeon. Now I desperately missed the outside world.\n\u201cI need Wi-Fi\u2026.\u201d\nYeah, no phones either.\nI looked at the party for the last time. Since Cthugha said he would install a movement magic in the store building, I thought we could just move together inside the building, but\u2026.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not confident in moving humans. There\u2019s a possibility that I can clone people into two, or that you\u2019ll go in a half.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.I will walk.\u201d\nI quickly gave up when I heard Cthugha\u2019s words.\nTherefore, adding the humans who enjoyed great camping yesterday and our animals, the group became a considerable number of people.\n\u201cLime-ah, is it okay if you come with me?\u201d\nAccording to Cthugha, Lime is a \u2018piece of flame\u2019 that ran away from home. Then this dungeon must be Lime\u2019s original home. It came back at best, but is it okay to leave the house again?\nThat\u2019s why I asked\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cKkyu, kkyuu, kkyuuuuuuu!\u201d\nLime bounced its body and drew a circle.\n\u201cTake it. I think that kid like it there.\u201d\nSince Cthugha said so, it will be okay.\n\u201cMmmoooo!\u201d\nAnd the golden triangular rhinoceros of my family, which follows Lime closely, was also with us. I had a hard time keeping Lime away from the barrel he was trying to lick.\nThe back of the cow was loaded with seafood given as a gift by the fire spirits.\nI should name this one too. What should I name it? Umh, cow \u2026 the name of a cow, um\u2026..\nI\u2019ll think about it later.\n\u201cPepe, farewell, sad.\u201d\n\u201cTake care, Pepe.\u201d\nAfter saying goodbye to everyone, it\u2019s time to finally leave.\nCthugha added the last words.\n\u201cIf you follow the path that the stars point to, you will find the way to your original home. You should never look back.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me \u2026 could you please not say such an ominous thing\u2026..?\u201d\nIt sounds like there will be a curse that turns you into stone if you look back.\nTogether, we set foot on the path of stars.\nLight continued long in the dark space reminiscent of the night sky. The name \u2018The Path of Stars\u2019 seemed to suit it.\nIt was around the time I had walked along the path of stars for some time.\n\u201cHuh\u2026.?\u201d\nSuddenly, like being blowed by sandstorm, my vision blurred. I rubbed my eyes and looked again, but the blur does not disappear.\nAnd this message.\n[An unauthorized user has just attempted to access the service.][You are not connected \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2026.]\nI was bewildered for a moment.\nSoon the blur cleared and the notification window disappeared. I guess I\u2019m fine now.\nAs I tried to walk again with confidence, I suddenly noticed that I couldn\u2019t see anyone else.\nObviously, we walked closely together until just now, but it\u2019s just darkness on either side. I reached out my hand, but nothing was caught.\n\u201c\u2026.Oppa? Uncle? Yichan-ah! Kim Ash, where are you?!\u201d\nOnly my voice echoes in the distant darkness. Lime, who I was holding in my arms, also disappeared.\nI looked at my feet and was stunned. There was no path of light that showed the direction to go. The light had gone out and it was dark under my feet, so I couldn\u2019t even know where to go now.\n\u201cEverybody, where are you?!\u201d\nI was the only one who fell. Anxiety flared up.\nDon\u2019t tell me I have to keep wandering in this black space. The mere imagination already gives me goosebumps.\n\u201cWhoa, ha\u2026.\u201d\nLet\u2019s stay calm. I\u2019ve already been through something similar once. Yes, like when the Saintess summoned me to a strange space.\nPerhaps the Saintess called me again this time. Otherwise, why would the others disappear?\nI shouted in a trembling voice into the air in front of me.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026If you call me, come out quickly!\u201d\nThere is no answer. I waited for a while, but the surroundings remained dark, and the blonde woman in fantasy-style clothes did not appear.\nIf it\u2019s not a call from the Saintess\u2026.\n\u2018Status Window.\u2019\nI tried to load the system status window. I thought there would be some hints about this situation.\nHowever\u2026.. \n[Interruption\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2026\u2026][Warning: Unable to Connect.]\n[System Error: Blocking Access][System Error: Blocking Access]\nThen, silence.\n\u201cHuh\u2026..?\u201d\nAt the end of the bright red error window, the system stopped responding. The same goes for the Ether-Wiki.\nThere have been several error windows so far, but this is the first time that such content has appeared.\nI could feel a cold sweat running down my forehead.\nIt\u2019s scary. When the system window stopped, I really felt like I was left alone in this unfamiliar space.\nI feel like the deep darkness is going to devour me right away.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nThis is different from the darkness of the time when the Saintess called me. This one is more bleak and endless \u2026 it\u2019s a darkness that\u2019s trying to do me harm. I feel scared and nauseous.\n\u2018You need to get a hold of yourself. There must be a way out. You\u2019re not alone.\u2019\n\u2026really?\nWhere they had gone, the others were already invisible. I\u2019m just left alone in this darkness.\nWhile I was on the verge of being eroded by fear and despair,\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nA young human figure appeared from the other side of the void.\nThat black hair, straight limbs, and black eyes that twinkled even in the dark \u2026 no way\u2026.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi?\u201d\nNo, it\u2019s not him.\nI soon realized the difference.\nThe person, who looked like Ki Yoohyun at first glance, became smaller as he got closer to me. When he reached my front, his height barely came a little below my chest.\n\u201cYo-you \u2026 who are you?\u201d\nSmile. Only a soft smile, there was no answer.\nHe looked like a young boy on the surface, but he resembles Ki Yoohyun a lot. If it was about 10 years ago, I thought Ki Yoohyun would look like this.\n\u201cAre you trying to help me?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nInstead of answering, the boy held out his hand.\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nnext\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nexcessive solicitude (\ub178\ud30c\uc2ec): the state of feeling overly worried and anxious about other\u2019s business.

There are cases where the ability becomes stronger or, conversely, weaker, but I have never heard of such a case of someone losing their awakening status.\n\u201cNyaaaah (It\u2019s real).\u201d\nMieum answered my question with a languid cry.\n\u201cThen maybe \u2026 is it possible to get it back?\u201d\n\u201cMeow, waeuuung (It\u2019s impossible. I don\u2019t know what happened \u2026 but the etheric affinity has disappeared, and the access to the system is completely lost.)\u201d\n\u2018Unbelievable\u2026.\u2019\n\u201cWhen we go back, I will first submit an investigation request to the main office. We\u2019re going to re-investigate the missing dungeon \u2026 what are you doing?\u201d\n\nWhen the large bomb suddenly exploded, only my uncle remained calm. My uncle cut off Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s words and talked to me.\n\u201cNiece, do you have a paper and a pen?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, I have. Here.\u201d\nI found a piece of paper and a pen in the drawer and handed it to my uncle. My uncle scribbled something in a flowy handwriting, stamped it with his thumprint, and handed it out to Kwon Jiwoon.\nLetter of AppointmentName: Kwon JiwoonI appoint the above person as the guild leader of The White Silver Guild.Kwon Seokmin \n\u201c\u2026.Father!\u201d\n\u201cFrom today on, you are the guild leader. Now, congratulations! Come on, clap.\u201d\nI was out of my mind. I don\u2019t know what the hell is happening, but everyone started to clap because we were swept away by the atmosphere. Nothing has been resolved, but when we applauded together, there was an atmosphere of celebration.\n\u201cCongratulations\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHaha, congratulations.\u201d\n\u201cThe darkness will be with you.\u201d\nIn this way, a new guild leader of the White Silver Guild was appointed in the dungeon.\nKwon Jiwoon still looked like he had a headache, but it didn\u2019t seem to be caused by motion sickness.\n***\nThe night has come even in the dungeon. The hot sun had set, and only the red moon shone on the calm night sea.\nI can\u2019t go back until tomorrow night, so I have to spend a day in this beach dungeon. However, the room in the store building was not enough for everyone to stay overnight.\nSince I figured out a way back, and Cthugha promised me a safe return, I told the people who came to see me to go home first.\n\u201cFather has finally returned, and it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been this relaxed, so I don\u2019t think I have to hurry.\u201d\n\u201cIs this child name Lime? \u2026. haaa, it\u2019s so cute.\u201d\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d\n\u201cHahaha, I don\u2019t have a home yet.\u201d\nEveryone refused for their own reasons.\nThen I\u2019m wondering if I should put a blanket on the floor of the store, but my uncle suggested a new opinion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s camping! If you come to the sea, of course you have to do camping!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good \u2026 I always wanted to do an Inssa event like this once\u2026.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Ju Noeul, who became close to my uncle, immediately expressed her consent.\nAll of a sudden, camping was decided with an atmosphere suitable for the \u2018Relaxing Episode Summer Vacation\u2019.\nAs they are all hunters, they have camping equipment for dungeon exploration in their inventory. After setting up a tent on the beach and grilling the seafood given by the fire spirits, the atmosphere was quite good.\nIt\u2019s safe, but when I think about how I ended up camping in the dungeon, I have mixed feelings\u2026.\nWell, I don\u2019t know. As long as it\u2019s fun.\nHowever, this thought occurred to me.\n\u2018I wish Yoohyun-ssi was here too.\u2019\nI think he will adapt well even among this random combination because he has a friendly personality.\nI wonder if he\u2019s surprised because the entire store building has disappeared by now.\nI wanted to tell him not to worry because I was safe, but it was frustrating because my phone has no connection. I haven\u2019t been able to tell him that I met a crazy pseudo-religious man yet \u2026 I should contact him as soon as I get out of here.\nPreviously, when revealing his secret, Ki Yoohyun said that he was trying to prevent the resurrection of the Demon.\nWe have only one thing in common: we are regressors. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything I can contribute to that goal, but I couldn\u2019t help but care about him.\n\u201cSo I wanted to tell Rieul-ssi. About who I am.\u201d\nAh. I can\u2019t. A memory that was bad for my heart almost came to my mind. It was not a good memory to recall when we were all building friendships like this.\nI tried to cut off the branching thoughts and looked around.\n\u201cWhy is Wi-Fi not working in the dungeon yet when we are an IT powerhouse\u2026.\u201d\nIn the midst of the murmur of Ju Noeul, who is suffering with her disconnected smartphone, is heard as background sound.\nSuddenly, I noticed that Choi Cedric was nowhere to be seen.\nWhere did he go? He was here when we set up the tent.\n\u201cAsh, wait a minute.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\nAs soon as I got up, Ash quickly tried to follow me. However, he was held back by a grab from the other side. It was my uncle.\n\u201cPart-time boy, come here and sit down. You\u2019re still young, but you work so hard for a part-time job. You\u2019re admirable. Come and eat more.\u201d\nTak!\nAsh spoke, roughly shaking off my uncle\u2019s hand.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it. The power of the Abyss is asleep in this hand.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThe relaxed atmosphere freezes. My uncle, who was eating the grilled fish, looked at Ash quietly, and Kwon Jiwoon quickly intervened in order to fix the atmosphere.\n\u201cFather, he\u2019s not a relative on the holiday, what is this? Let the little ones play.\u201d\n\u201cDang, son, just because you got the guild leader appointment letter, you are treating me like an old man in the back room now.\u201d\n\u201cHaa \u2026 didn\u2019t you just hand it over at your own will?\u201d\nI should give Kwon Jiwoon some headache medicine later.\nIgnoring Kwon Jiwoon, who rubbed his temple, next to him, my uncle continued to talk to Ash.\n\u201cI see, I see. But that hand, in my eyes, it looks like it\u2019s disconnected. The imprint has already disappeared.\u201d\n\u201cHoo \u2026 being able to see through that, for a human being, you\u2019re pretty good.\u201d\nIt worked?!\nAsh quietly sat down next to my uncle. My uncle said as he rummaged through his pockets.\n\u201cI should give pocket money to such a great child. Um \u2026 ah, I don\u2019t have my wallet. Son.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.here it is.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon handed his entire wallet to my uncle, who took out a bunch of money from inside.\n\u201cHere, pocket money.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t need such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cOho, if an adult gives it to you, you say yes and receive it. Take it now.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWell, given that atmosphere, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to leave it as it is.\nDuring this time, I sneakily left the campsite and headed to the dark beach in search of Choi Cedric.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find Choi Cedric. It was because Pepe\u2019s red body shone in a corner of the beach where there was no sign of anyone, and a sad voice was heard.\n\u201cHaaa \u2026 why am I like this\u2026.\u201d\nI have a sense of deja vu about this situation.\nChoi Cedric was sitting opposite the bonfire and muttering something with a depressed expression to Pepe. Pepe has a bored look on his face.\n\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHe guess he was so absorbed in his thoughts that he didn\u2019t even notice my presence. Choi Cedric\u2019s cheeks gradually heated up.\n\u201cYo-you, you! If someone looks serious, you have to pretend not to know!\u201d\n\u201cAh, I was going to, but\u2026.\u201d\nPepe kept staring at me as if he\u2019s asking me to do something.\nIt was strange that he said he didn\u2019t want to go home, but why is he being depressed here alone?\nI slumped down next to Choi Cedric to hear what happened. As if it was very boring, Pepe ran away as soon as I came.\n\u201cPepe, boredom, coming home!\u201d\nTap, tap, tap\u2026.\nPepe\u2019s footsteps faded away, and only the sound of waves and burning bonfire could be heard on the beach.\nChoi Cedric didn\u2019t kick me out, but he didn\u2019t say anything. He just gazed at the burning bonfire and sighed.\n\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nI quickly got bored.\nHowever, it was not possible to leave Choi Cedric, who looked like there\u2019s something wrong happened to him. Well, then I\u2019ll ask him first. I had something to say to Choi Cedric.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..do you know that Romeo and Juliet ends in tragedy?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? I know. They\u2019re both dead in the end. Why all of a sudden?\u201d\n\u201cHaa \u2026 that\u2019s why I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..?\u201d\nIt was an unexpected sound to say with such melancholic eyes. The words have no connection at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, because of the guild problem \u2026 never mind.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nIf it\u2019s a guild, it\u2019s probably related to C&L. I also don\u2019t have good feelings for C&L, and it was too much to ask a lot of questions about a guild\u2019s internal issues.\nSo I answered with a short answer, but Choi Cedric brought it up again on his own.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do people suddenly change?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the matter for that question?\u201d\n\u201cAh, oh, nothing happened! It\u2019s just, what is it, general! Yeah, generally speaking.\u201d\nThere\u2019s something going on\u2026\u2026.\nI looked at the bonfire that was gradually losing its flames and thought about the answer to Choi Cedric\u2019s ambiguous question.\n\u201cMmh \u2026 memory loss?\u201d\n\u201cNo, their memory is fine. They remember exactly what happened in the past.\u201d\n\u201cThen, isn\u2019t it just a change of heart? \u2018You just have to live a good life from today, eat three meals a day, and exercise\u2018, they might be thinking like this.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that kind of change, it feels uncomfortable, and sometimes I feel like they\u2019ve become a different person\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Cedric frowned, pouring out unorganized thoughts. I put the words that came to my mind into my mouth.\n\u201cThen, isn\u2019t it like being possessed?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You, uh, wha \u2026 what nonsense are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a general theory. I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a clich\u00e9 like that in general.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh \u2026 that\u2019s enough.\u201d\nAs if this topic was really over, Choi Cedric stopped talking. After that, he asked again.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you come because you had something to say? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that. I want to say thank you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thank you \u2026 wh-what, what?!\u201d\nIs it that surprising? When I saw Choi Cedric leaning backward with his eyes wide open, I laughed.\nI could see a camping site in the distance. Kwon Jiwoon was staring at my uncle with a bitter smile. Still, I know that look isn\u2019t really troubling. Even if he looks like that, he\u2019s enjoying himself.\nIf I had kept avoiding my relationship with Kwon Jiwoon, I wouldn\u2019t have seen him like that.\nThe decisive trigger for the reconciliation was the incident of the White Silver Guild, but it was Choi Cedric\u2019s words that helped before that.\n\u201cThat day, when we entered Monster Hell. Cedric, you told me. Since we only have one family, do what you can so you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThat was very helpful. That\u2019s why I wanted to say thank you, and I happened to meet you here.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nSeriously saying something like this in front of the dying bonfire, it feels so\u2026.\n\u2026incredibly embarrassing.\n\u201cAnyway, so Cedric, you should stop thinking about depressing things\u2026..\u201d\nI smiled and talked to change the awkward atmosphere.\nJump. Choi Cedric suddenly rose to his feet.\n\u201cYeah, I should try everything I can.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..?\u201d\n\u201cThis is not the time for this. You\u2019re right. There\u2019s no end if I\u2019m just avoiding it. I have to do what I can.\u201d\n\u201cUh, huh\u2026?\u201d\nSuddenly, he clenched his fist and made an enterprising expression. It looked like it could be used as an enlightenment poster.\nChoi Cedric took out a teleport scroll from his inventory. Before tearing the scroll, he glanced at me for the last time.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m leaving first. Let\u2019s meet when you get out of this place. I\u2019ll go to your cafe as a guest then.\u201d\nThe light flashed, and in an instant, Choi Cedric disappeared.\nAnyway, I\u2019m glad he got his energy back. It\u2019s a relief\u2026..\n\u201cThere must be a way for Romeo and Juliet to not end in tragedy.\u201d\nI have no idea what this last remark means.\nHas he been impressed by the classic masterpiece?\nThe bonfire was completely extinguished. It was then when I stood up thinking of going back to where other people were.\n\u201cRieul-ah.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.huh.\u201d\nWas he looking for me? Choi Yichan came closer.\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nInssa (\uc778\uc2f8): an abbreviation for Insider.

It felt nostalgic, actually, doing a chapter by phone. When I started this blog, I only used my phone to do the chapters. That was the reason why all the chapters that were posted in 2019 are really bad in quality, its really embarrassing T__T I used to write everything manually in my note book before then typing it to wordpress editor in mobile apps. It was possible back then because I don\u2019t need to study and I have no friends (and rejected all the hang out invitations), but now that I have academic and social life \u2026 I can only do this with phone when I have a lot of free time. It\u2019s fun anyway, doing something that I used to do. I like stability in life the best~\nah, sorry the rant is too long, I\u2019ll (hopefully) go back to my hiatus then. I hope you guys enjoy this holiday (?) ARC!\n(Oh, if you guys want update to my laptop situation: no, it can\u2019t be fixed ajsdjsdsldj since I already spent a lot for the previous repair and it did nothing, and everyone told me I need to accept the fact that I need to let my dear laptop rest in peace, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saving to buy a laptop. But why no one tell me separating with your old laptop feels a lot like a heartbreak T___T)\nThank you for Benny, Anonymous, Trashferret, Insideofadoge, Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous for the contribution to the wishlist!\n(see, there\u2019s so many people \u2026 I promise to work hard when I resolved this problem of mine\u2026.)\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c100": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nIn an instant, the Wyverns leapt into the space of the Garden of Cthugha, the Eternal Living Flame.\n\u201cThere it is!\u201d\nOn a cliff on a sunny beach, they could see a brick cafe building.\nHowever, as the Wyverns got closer to the cafe, they felt puzzled. An unexpected scene unfolded before their eyes.\nSmall fireballs lined up in front of the cafe.\n\n\u201cNow, one at a time, do not push!\u201d\n\u201cCoffee, coffee, coffee!\u201d\nA cheerful answer followed.\n***\nTime, overflowing.\nIngredient, the stock is sufficient.\nConsumer, they\u2019re being curious.\nQuest, there\u2019s a reward that looks good.\nThe conditions were perfect for business trip, but one problem remained.\nThe fire spirits could not be brought into the cafe. If these fire spirits, whose bodies are made of fire, enter, the inside of the building will burn quickly.\nHowever, if I said that I would not sell coffee to the spirits for that reason, they would be angry. The expectant eyes were directed at me.\n\u201cPerfect, gorgeous, wonderful!\u201d\n\u201cNumber one, fantastic, coffee!\u201d\nPepe\u2019s real-time reviews were also enough to stimulate the spirits. Pepe, you\u2019re good at viral marketing\u2026.\nAfter returning to the beach where the cafe was placed with spirits who were not about to back down, I was lost in thought.\nThere is an option to make coffee inside and bring it outside, but it is cumbersome.\nI\u2019d rather do this.\nI took out moderately-sized (and also flame-retardant) plate from the warehouse on the first floor of the store. I don\u2019t know why this stuff is in the warehouse. Come to think of it, this warehouse was large for the size of the store and had all kinds of items.\n\u2018Why did Grandmother collect these things\u2026.\u2019\nAnyway, let\u2019s leave the question behind.\nWith the help of Choi Cedric and Ash, I was able to quickly create the things I wanted. It is a counter where you can place an order and get a drink while walking outside.\nThe so-called walk-through counter.\n\u201cNow, one at a time, do not push!\u201d\nThe curious fire spirits quickly lined up at my words. Since everyone ordered Irish coffee, it didn\u2019t take long to process the order.\n\u201cCoffee, coffee, coffee!\u201d\nThe last fire spirit received the coffee with a lot of cream in a porcelain cup. The moment the spirit drank the coffee while emitting a hotter fire, the quest completion notification popped up immediately.\nTiling!\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Sub Quest: Business Trip Never Ends!\u2019.Please collect the rewards.][Experience: 200 EXP have been acquired.][You have acquired Connect Anywhere \u2606 Mysterious Door.][Fame: 10 / Popularity: 20.][<Cafe Rieul>\u2019s current Grade: E]\n\u201cOh, look over there!\u201d\n\u201cKyagyakyoo (It\u2019s a Wyvern)!\u201d\nWhen I was about to check the reward sone by one, I turned my head to the sharp cry of Choi Cedric and Mieum \u2026 and I got startled.\nUh, that\u2019s \u2026 a monster? No, there\u2019s a person riding it?\nFour monsters resembling dragons appeared in the middle of the bluish blue sky. If you look closely, you can see that they are flapping their wings with one person on their back.\nIt was the moment when I rubbed my eyes with my hands and tried to look again.\nWait \u2026 those wyverns, are they coming this way?\nA brilliant aerobatic flight embroidered the sky. While someone\u2019s screams echoed in the background, the Wyverns landed on the ground.\n\u201cOuch, it hurts\u2026.\u201d\nPoof. The Wyvern disappeared as if melting in the shadows, and the people who got off the Wyvern\u2019s back got up with the sound of pain.\nI was astonished to see their faces.\n\u201cUmh \u2026 excuse me?\u201d\nI knew all of them\u2026.\n***\n\u201c\u2026\u2026so I was selling coffee to the spirits.\u201d\nIt took quite some time to sort things out.\nFirst, it took a while to calm the fire spirits who wanted more coffee and send them back. Also, the visitors who came by riding the Wyverns required some time to overcome motion sickness.\nWe barely sat down and talked to each other about what had happened. This is the summary of what we talked about.\nFirst, Ju Noeul. She is a regular who often comes to our store to drink coffee.\n\u201cI was worried about the sudden disappearance of the store\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, it happened to be like this. Ah, I\u2019m Kwon Rieul. Please call me Rieul.\u201d\n\u201cI am Ju Noeul \u2026 I\u2019m the leader of the Royal Guild.\u201d\nHuk, she was a famous person. I thought she was YOLO life-seeker like me, so I felt an inner intimacy alone\u2026.\nWait, in this case, the heads of two Big Three guilds are regulars at my store.\nAren\u2019t my regulars too strong? Is this the S-Classes That I Fed?\nIt turned out that she was an S-class Summoner, who summoned the Wyverns and flew here.\nThe second is Kwon Jiwoon.\n\u201cUgh, Rieul-ah, get me some water, eub\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAre you okay? You\u2019re sweating a lot. Hurry, drink this ice water.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t come to his senses even after emptying all the cups of water. I let Kwon Jiwoon sit comfortably against the chair.\nLooks like he had a great flight.\nThere\u2019s also Choi Yichan.\n\u201cHaha \u2026 long time no see, Rieul-ah. How have you been doing?\u201d\nI was dumbfounded by the nonchalant greeting.\nHe left behind a strange note and disappeared, what? How have you been doing?\n\u201cLong time no see? You\u2019ve worried people, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to say?\u201d\nI was going to slap ahim on the back, but I gave up immediately. In the meantime, his body has become \u2026 stronger. It felt like my hand would hurt more if I hit it.\nNot only that, but the atmosphere has changed. There was a slightly sharp look on his face, made him looked like a gentle large dog. He also wore proper armor, not his usual training clothes.\nHe has become more like a Hunter. It seems that the content of the note \u201cI will come back stronger\u201d was not a lie.\nI met him for the first time in a long time, but it felt awkward when the atmosphere changed like this.\nChoi Yichan lightly grabbed my hand, which stopped halfway as I was about to throw a smash on his back. The calluses on Choi Yichan\u2019s palm touched my finger.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI could feel Ash\u2019s sharp gaze in the back of my head. He must have been nervous because there were a lot of strangers.\nAs if he was showing that he\u2019s sorry, Choi Yichan scratched the back of his head with one hand.\n\u201cHaha \u2026 sorry. Well, I tried to contact you right away, but my phone didn\u2019t work in the dungeon.\u201d\n\u201cOf course\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI came out of the dungeon and tried to call you, but this happened again.\u201d\nChoi Yichan took his phone out of his pocket and showed it to me. The screen had been completely smashed somewhere.\n\u201cI grabbed it hard and it became like this, haha.\u201d\nA shy laugh followed.\nThis Choi Yichan, who closed his eyes when he smiled, was the Choi Yichan that I knew. Actually, Choi Yichan is Choi Yichan, so things will not be that different from before.\nThe awkwardness finally disappeared and I lost the tension in my shoulders. Choi Yichan followed me with a smile.\nAnd the last one was my uncle.\nMy uncle, who has not been heard from since he went missing in the dungeon a long time ago. Choi Yichan is said to have stumbled upon him in the dungeon.\nI changed the future and Choi Yichan survived, and Choi Yichan saved my uncle and the future changed again. When I thought about it that way, I was both happy and moved.\n\u201cRieul-ah!\u201d\n\u201cUncle!\u201d\nHe was nice to me in the past. I was so moved that I hugged my uncle for a while.\n\u201cAh, thank goodness we met. Rieul, aren\u2019t you a high school student right now? How did a student open a cafe?\u201d\n\u201cI \u2026  I am twenty-three.\u201d\nHe thought I was years younger than I actually was. What the hell happened to him?\n\u201cIs that so? No wonder my niece seemed a little big. Hi, yes, I\u2019m glad the error rate is only this much. If it had been any further, I would have almost messed up my work.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.work?\u201d\nMy uncle gave me a serious look.\n\u201cNiece, listen up. Among the items your grandmother left behind, there is one that contain the power of Cthugha. I don\u2019t know who has it now, but we have to find it.\u201d\n\u201cAre you talking about this?\u201d\nI showed my uncle the ring on my hand.\n\u201cOh! I can\u2019t believe you got it already. Oh, I\u2019m proud of you, my niece. So now that crazy old man \u2026 no, we have to meet a fireball.\u201d\n\u201cFireball \u2026 are you talking about Cthugha?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t be surprised and listen. There is a secret island in this field. They say that the road can only be opened by the guidance of the fire spirit.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have been there.\u201d\n\u201cWe must meet Cthugha in the his temple on that island and make a contract. It\u2019s embarrassing, but now I believe that this eldest son needs to\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThe contract \u2026 has already been signed\u2026..\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Uncle?\u201d\nMy uncle was speechless. It seemed that he\u2019s disappointed. I felt a little sorry because I seemed to have unintentionally intercepted his words.\n\u201cEhem, ahem! My niece, you have become a good child on your own. You\u2019ve grown up so well, hahaha!\u201d\nBut how does my uncle, who has been missing for a long time, know about the ring and the contract with Cthugha? Did my uncle meet the saintess too?\n\u201cMore than that, Uncle, what have you been up to?\u201d\n\u201cThis worldline is tangled with too much work \u2026 To stop that \u2026. hmmm \u2026 heum\u2026..\u201d\nMumble, unfamiliar words followed. In this way, it was difficult to ask what had happened.\nI slowly released the arm that was hugging me with emotion.\nYes, how can I understand my uncle\u2019s feelings? I hoped my uncle would calm down and turned my head toward Kwon Jiwoon, who just took a shot of ice water.\n\u201cWhat happened to Uncle?\u201d\n\u201cHe was lost in the maze dungeon and when he came out \u2026 eugh, eub.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon vomited again with a pale face.\nMy uncle was lost in maze dungeon, and he spent a month inside that place. However, when he finally got out, he could barely understand that six years had passed.\nIf I asked him any more questions, he\u2019d probably spill what\u2019s inside his stomach soon, so I stopped talking.\n\u201c\u2026.okay, I\u2019ll listen to it later. Just take a rest\u2026.\u201d\nThen, I remembered one thing.\nIt has been a long time since Kwon Jiwoon took over the business, but the original guild leader of the White Silver Guild was my uncle. Now that my uncle has returned, Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s burden seems to be reduced.\n\u201cThen, Uncle, are you returning to become the guild leader now?\u201d\nHowever, my uncle gave an unexpected answer.\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, really?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Father, what do you mean?\u201d\nAs if it had never been heard of before, Kwon Jiwoon also raised his head in surprise.\n\u201cI have already lost all of my hunter abilities. Now that I am not an Awakened person, I\u2019m only an ordinary person, so I am going to step down from that position.\u201d\n\u201cWhat \u2026 Father, what happened?\u201d\n\u201cThere was some stuff happened in the dungeon.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nDoubts grew even more.\nHowever, my uncle did not elaborate further. He just shook his shoulders as if he was trying to forget the terrible memories.\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nnext\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nHappy 100 chapters!

Following Cthugha\u2019s declaration, a system window appeared in front of me.\n[Great Old One:\u00a0The Eternal Living Flame, Cthugha, wants a contract with you.][You can get the Blessing of Cthugha when signing the contract.]\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nLet\u2019s just sit back and look at the system window for a moment.\n[You can get the Blessing of Cthugha when signing the contract.][You can get the Blessing of Cthugha when signing the contract.]\nThe window flickered repeatedly, as if rushing me.\nBut\u2026.\n\u201cDo I have to do this?\u201d\nI can fully understand that it\u2019s amazing based on the atmosphere.\nA living flame with the ability to turn into a human and then turn into a fire again, if that\u2019s not great, that\u2019s even weirder. The name that spelled system window is \u2018Great\u2019, so it must be actually great.\nHowever, they said that with great power comes great responsibility.\nIn other words, with great unwanted power comes great unwanted responsibility.\nNo matter how great the power was, I wasn\u2019t confident I could make good use of it. There must be someone more suitable than me somewhere. I didn\u2019t readily nod at the thought.\nWouldn\u2019t Choi Cedric be more suitable? He\u2019s strong. I turned around with that thought.\n\u201cEung? Why? Is that burdensome? Heh, really, it suits you well, so accept it. You are the, what is that again, Coffee Tentaku!\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cNyaaaah, nyaaaaah (Coffee Tentaku, Coffee Tentaku)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu! Kyuuu!\u201d\nThe animals of my house are so excited that they\u2019re imitating him\u2026.\nI can\u2019t believe he still uses that title. In my mind, I prayed earnestly that Choi Cedric would develop the right language habit.\nThen, what about Ash, The (self-proclaimed) Demon King of Twilight?\n\u201cI hate fire.\u201d\nHowever, even before making eye contact, Ash expressed his refusal.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, granddaughter. It won\u2019t change anything if you don\u2019t want to. Just think of it as a contract to strengthen the power of the ring.\u201d\nThe hesitation was still there.\nYes, the power of the ring is essential when roasting beans\u2026..\nEr, I don\u2019t know. Complex thoughts do not fit me. There is a man around me who has the greatest power with the greatest responsibility in Korea. I wonder what would happen if someone without much determination like me signed such a contract.\nI nodded slowly.\nAt that moment, the ring on my left hand heated up and the system window popped up.\n[Great Old One: You have signed a contract with Cthugha, the Eternal Living Flame.][The Eligible: The ability is granted according to Kwon Rieul\u2019s will.]\n[Skill: Eternal Flame (S)Details: (Lv.max) You can summon Cthugha.]\nWait, S-grade?\nThere was a huge difference between feeling vaguely strong and seeing the grade mark in person.\n\u201c\u2026.Hick.\u201d\nI was so startled that I hiccuped.\n\u201cHik, heuck, hick!\u201d\n\u201cOh, hey, don\u2019t die. What did that fireball do to you? You can\u2019t breathe!\u201d\n\u201cNothing, I just gave her skill according to the contract. The skill grade is S-grade\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHik, heuck, i\u2019m dying \u2026 hick!\u201d\n\u201cWaeooong (You\u2019re such a human being with small liver to be surprised by such a thing).\u201d\n\u201cWater, water, water.\u201d\n\u201cHere, drink some water.\u201d\nI finally stopped hiccuping after emptying the glass of water that Ash gave me. Phew, I thought I was going to die.\nShe got an S-grade skill in an F-class water body and was so shocked that she hiccuped and died. With this content, I almost became a strong candidate for the \u2018Erwin Award\u2018 given to a Hunter who died unexpectedly.\nAfter barely calming down the disturbance.\nThe topic suddenly shifted because of the contract with Cthugha, but the most important thing is the return. The property that has become movable must be returned to its original place.\n\u201cThen, I can go back, right?  \u2026 with my building.\u201d\nCthugha shook his head.\n\u201cNot now. The nagging of \u2588\u2588 is enormous that the area where I can intervene is limited. Wait until the stream of stars changes.\u201d\n\u201cWhen is that?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026.\u201d\nCthugha looked up at the sky. I couldn\u2019t see the stars because of the sunlight, but he was lost in thought as if he were reading the stream of the stars.\nThe longer his silence grew, the more anxious I became.\nCthugha probably has lived a very long time because he said he\u2019s immortal. Earlier, Pepe also said he was 1200 years old.\nAn immortal with a different concept of time from humans, or a world where the flow of time is different from the outside world is a clich\u00e9. Don\u2019t tell me that sort of clich\u00e9 thing happens.\n\u201cBy any chance, it\u2019s just \u2026 300 years from now, it\u2019s not like this, is it?\u201d\nCthugha grinned, taking off his gaze toward the sky.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d\nWhew, I\u2019m glad. It\u2019s 299 years and 364 days faster than what I was worried about. I was moved by the K-different world that respects busy modern people.\n\u201cTomorrow night, a day later, the path of the stars opens when the when the starlight of Fomalhaut shines. I will install movement magic in the building, so you can go back through that path.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I can trust you, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, of course! Will the Flame of Eternity lie to his granddaughter?\nIt \u2026 the smell, no, the trace would be fine\u2026.\nLeastwise. Anyway, before I go back, I have to spend a day in this midsummer dungeon.\nThen, again, there is only one thing to do.\nPepe and the fire spirits approached and surrounded me. Their eyes were filled with curiosity and aspiration. The spirits shouted along Pepe\u2019s lead.\n\u201cCoffee, coffee, coffee.\u201d\n\u201cCoffee, coffee, coffee.\u201d\nAs if to match the response of the spirits, a ringing sound rang out.\n[Sub Quest: Business Trip Never Ends!Behold, the eyes of the eternal spirits.Listen, the voice of the spirits calling you.The fire spirits are interested in your coffee.Let\u2019s make a big profit from the business trip.\nSell Irish Coffee: 0/20Rewards: EXP (200 exp), Fame (10), Popularity (20), Connect Anywhere \u2606 Mysterious Door]\n***\nJu Noeul looked at the faces of those who quietly moved ahead.\nFirst, the new S-class hunter, Choi Yichan.\nKwon Seokmin, the guild leader of the White Silver Guild, who has been missing for several years.\nAnd Kwon Jiwoon, the healer of the White Silver Guild.\nIt\u2019s a unique combination. She\u2019s very curious about why they\u2019re looking for her regular cafe that has disappeared.\n\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you coming?\u201d\nChoi Yichan, who was walking ahead, called her.\n\u201cComing, I\u2019m coming\u2026.\u201d\nAs she moved quickly, Ju Noeul glanced at Choi Yichan. He only moves silently with a calm expression on his face.\nAmong them, Choi Yichan is the person she cares the most.\nBecause he turned down her offer of recruitment mercilessly.\n\u2018What\u2019s wrong with Royal\u2026.\u2019\nThe Royal Guild, which had many long-distance dealers in its early members, suffered from a chronic shortage of short-distance dealers. A new S-class melee berserker appeared at a time like this! She can\u2019t help but to desire it.\nSo she squeezed the budget and promised the best treatment in the industry. As a bonus, there is even a welfare system that supports his fan activity up to a certain amount of money per month!\nHowever, the feedback was unheard. In fact, he had just turned off his phone, but Ju Noeul did not know about it.\nThat Choi Yichan is with the father and son of The White Silver Guild. No way, are they promised to hire him under the water\u2026.\n\u2018I can\u2019t leave him like that\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nThis was the reason why Ju Noeul quickly stepped into this party.\nOf course, that\u2019s not the only reason. It is true that she was also concerned about the whereabouts of the missing regular cafe. Now, she doesn\u2019t feel like she has a proper day unless she drinks that cafe\u2019s coffee and watches the real red slime every day.\nHowever, the main reason is this.\nShe can\u2019t miss out on this exciting event. She\u2019ll have to follow along and figure out what\u2019s going on. To find out\u2026.\n\u2018I should write a review on Hunchan later\u2026.\u2019\nThe party moved to the seventh floor after passing the Dungeon Gate of the Great Dungeon Abyss. It was Kwon Seokmin who took the lead.\n\u201cSon, this way!\u201d\nHe proceeded through the dungeon without hesitation as if he knew where the cafe owner would be. He rode the warp gate, avoiding the path where annoying monsters appear.\n\u2018Don\u2019t tell me this road is\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nJu Noeul stopped walking. She put her question into her mouth.\n\u201cUmh, Hunter Kwon Seokmin-nim, are you going to the Garden of Cthugha, the Eternal Living Flame?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It must be there!\u201d\nAside from the question of why the cafe that disappeared as a whole is there.\n\u201cThat field is difficult to access \u2026when the Hunter enters, the owner of the garden gets angry and sets them on fire \u2026 it\u2019s totally well-done\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThen, is there no other way? Umh, you\u2026\u201d\nChoi Yichan looked back at Ju Noeul and blurred the end of his words.\n\u201cMy name is Ju Noeul\u2026.\u201d\nJu Noeul looked at Choi Yichan\u2019s face, clouded with worry. He looked like a sullen puppy worrying about his owner.\nWhat is his relationship with the cafe owner? While being curious about the relationship between Choi Yichan and the cafe owner, she shuddered at the thought of Choi Yichan\u2019s signing of the contract with the Royal Guild as a token of gratitude after solving the problem.\nShe doesn\u2019t want to be grilled by Eternal Flame. Still, it\u2019s a game worth playing for the S-Class Melee Berserker.\nWait, guild members of the Royal Guild! This guild leader will take the big fish as a new guild member!\nJu Noeul declared with confidence.\n\u201cJust trust me\u2026.\u201d\nJu Noeul took a small needle out of her pocket and pricked her finger.\nDrip, drip. Four drops of blood fell into the shadow of Ju Noeul. The shadow swirled as if swallowing the blood.\n[Skill: Wyvern Summon (S) is used.]\nFour winged little dragons emerged from the shadow. Kwon Jiwoon, who recognized this, briefly admired it.\n\u201cWyvern\u2026..!\u201d\nIt was Ju Noeul\u2019s main skill, Summoning.\nThe difference from the Taming skill is that it does not tame the subject. \nIn exchange for Ju Noeul\u2019s blood, the Wyverns signed a summon contract. The content is to quickly take the group to their destination. It only fulfills the role set according to the contract, and the Wyverns are not obligated to obey her.\nIn other words\u2026.\n\u201cEuegh, ug! Son, are you going to throw me, who has become useless, here? Are you succeeding to the throne?\u201d\n\u201cFather, since my head is ringing, the loud noise is a little, eub\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cEugh, I don\u2019t know what it is, but something is popping up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026..\u201d\nAs they prioritized speed, the comfort of the ride was extremely poor.\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nfan activity: the word used is \ub355\uc9c8\uc744, it\u2019s basically fangirling/fanboying, the things than a fan to do to fulfill their happiness \u2026 things like buying merchs, watching fancams, etc.\n(I haven\u2019t had the time to reply comments because things are chaotic lately, but I still read them) Ju Noeul is the guild leader of the Royal Guild. The Royal Guild is one of the big three guild along with Cheongna (Ki Yoohyun\u2019s guild) and C&L (Choi Cedric\u2019s guild). Her Hunchan account is called Lime Live Team (this is why I told you guys not to skip the forum things\u2026) and she\u2019s the hard fan of slime.\nah, and since I mentioned that I\u2019m saving for laptop, I will really appreciate it if you want to buy me a coffee on https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cabinfour or help the wishlist on https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cabinfour/w/4058 all the coffees given will go to my laptop funds~ but don\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t have a stable income, priority is imporant!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c98": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nAt that time.\nKi Yoohyun was thinking while looking at his phone. He got a KakaoTalk message from Kwon Rieul.\n[Kwon Rieul]Yoohyun-ssi today idk\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\n\u2026\u2026what does this mean?\n***\nPage Nine: The Eternal Flame Who Carries Love\n\nCthugha, in his human form, stared intently at me. The red eyes were filled with confusion, irritation and longing.\n\nUnable to overcome the pressure, I slowly retreated back, but Cthugha came closer. The heat hit me. Soon enough, the sound of breathing could be heard.\n\u201cAnswer me. Intruder, why do you smell like Heesun?\u201d\n\u201cYes? Perhaps \u2026 are you talking about Park Heesun?\u201d\nCthugha, who stood crookedly with his arms crossed, nodded his head.\n\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t forget this peculiar smell.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you smell people!\u201d\nI backed away, appalled.\nI took a shower in the morning. However, this field is in summer weather and I walked with Pepe for a long time.\nWhen I glanced at him as if I were looking at a strange person, Cthugha looked embarrassed. I opened my mouth cautiously.\n\u201cPark Heesun is my grandmother.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know that my grandmother\u2019s name would come out here again. What was the relationship between this Eternal Living Flame and my grandmother?\nAs soon as I answered, the flames died down, and the atmosphere became calmer.\n\u201cEuh-euhem. I see, grandgirl. Granddaughter, I mean. Here, here. Eat as much as you like.\u201d\nCthugha pushed the tuna plate towards me, but it had been a long time since he burned it to charcoal when he was angry.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThe hospitality here is so poor.\u201d\n\u201cPepe, sincerity, unfair.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\u201cTuna, tuna, tuna.\u201d\nPepe, who could not go against his master, quickly caught the tuna again.\nI picked up fresh sashimi and ate half-cooked tuna. It was delicious because it was cooked well.\n\u201cAsh, try this too. It\u2019s delicious.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I ate a lot.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Boy, you have to eat well to grow up like this Hyung. Yeah, I\u2019m in a good mood! If you eat it all, Choi Cedric will sign it for you.\u201d\n\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong, waeooolg (This guys, his eyes said, \u2018what\u2019s this annoying human being\u2018).\u201d\nI forgot about the troublesome situation and enjoyed the dinner for a while \u2026 until Cthugha spoke to me again.\n\u201cAll right, well \u2026 how is Heesun doing?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.she passed away.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nCthugha took a deep breath. He looked shocked.\n\u201cI see, that\u2019s right. Has it already been that way?\u201d\nRemorse was deeply etched on his face. It felt strange to see this human-shaped fireball mourning the death of my grandmother.\n\u201cI had a good time with Heesun. However \u2026 it\u2019s sad. Human time is too short. An immortal like me always misses the shadow of the mortal.\u201d\nMurmuring. The latter words ruffled into his breath.\nWait, don\u2019t tell me\u2026.?\nSuddenly, a possibility that I didn\u2019t want to think about ran through my head.\nMy grandmother had always been alone since I was very young. I thought my grandfather died early, but \u2026 now that I think about it, I\u2019ve never heard about him at all. Not only that, there is not a single photo left. As if he didn\u2019t exist in the first place.\nIn addition, my uncle, Kwon Jiwoon, and I are all awakened. There are three Awakeners in a row in one family. Isn\u2019t that a pretty rare chance?\nNo way.\nEh, that\u2019s ridiculous.\nI stared at Cthugha.\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nCthugha, with red hair and red eyes, looked just like a human.\nWhat if it\u2019s possible for these godlike creatures, like Cthugha, and humans, to produce offspring, and that\u2019s why their blood flows through me?\nWhat if the reason for the successive awakenings of my family is because of the secret of this birth?\nMieum\u2019s eyes shone as if she had reached the same question as me. Even if she pretended not to, I could still feel her excitement. She\u2019s like a K-drama fan who loves the secret of the main character\u2019s birth.\nI carefully raised my doubts.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2026 then, are you my grandfather?\u201d\nSpurt.  Choi Cedric spilled the juice he was drinking.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nA still silence where no breath can be heard.\nWith everyone\u2019s attention focused on us, Cthugha answered with a vague expression on his face.\n\u201cNo, Heesun and I had a pure relationship.\u201d\n\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201d\nThank God. I was free from the suspicion that 25% of my blood is non-human.\nMy precious humanity, my precious genes. I will continue to live like a human being.\n\u201cWas my grandmother awakened?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she was not an Awakeneds, but she could read the stream of the stars.\u201d\nAstrology \u2026 is it something like that? I asked again.\n\u201cThen, how did you meet my grandmother?\u201d\n\u201cAt that time, Heesun lived in a cabin in the forest. While wandering away from the ethereal world, I happened to meet her, and I was fascinated by her ability.\u201d\nThe story is likely to be long. The fire spirits attentively brought yellowtail sashimi and alcohol. Cthugha, who ate a piece of the well-cooked yellowtail sashimi and spewed vaporized alcohol, continued his words.\n\u201cHeesun was very picky, so she would not eat anything other than freshly cooked rice at every meal.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026yes?\u201d\n\u201cShe only slept at the warmest part of the room. So every morning I cut firewood and fetched water.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI had to work hard not to spit out the words that popped into my head.\nHowever, after hearing about how he made the charcoal himself and cooked rice by setting fire to the furnace for a long time, I couldn\u2019t help but to have this thought.\nSo this is\u2026\u2026.\n\u2026.rice shuttle? \nIt was a memory that didn\u2019t match the sad expression on his face.\n\u201cBut I am an immortal of the ethereal world. I couldn\u2019t always be by her side because of the limitations of causality. This is a body that can only move according to the stream of the stars.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nCthugha emptied his glass. The smell of alcohol whips through the air.\n\u201cThen one day, Heesun called me and made a request. She asked me to put my power on a stone so she can summon me any time.\u201d\nWait, don\u2019t tell me\u2026.\nI quietly hid my hand under the table. Cthugha continued his story.\nCthugha, who was happy to hear that she would call him anytime, quickly handed over a red stone containing his power.\nHowever, the next day, he said that my grandmother had disappeared.\nCthugha waited for my grandmother in the cabin until the stream of stars changed. Still, my grandmother did not return, and the causality imposed on him reached its limit.\nEventually, Cthugha returned to his garden, this place, and now time has passed. All he heard was that my grandmother had passed away a long time ago.\nIt was a strange story. At the time she ran her cafe, my grandmother seemed to have no interest in \u2018God of Another World\u2018  or \u2018Dungeon\u2018. I can\u2019t believe such an old lady met Cthugha.\nI felt the need to know more about my grandmother during my lifetime.\nBut that\u2019s for later, and for now\u2026\u2026.\nI hesitated for a moment and showed him my hand.\n\u201cIs this the stone with your power?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nCthugha\u2019s Ring. Since the name contains the name of Cthugha, it must be correct.\nThis ring was made by Grandma Kim Deokyi, but an item requires raw materials. Moreover, my grandmother and Kim Deokyi were acquaintances.\nIn other words, it is reasonable to think that the stone was passed away by the order of Cthugha \u2192 my grandmother \u2192 Grandma Kim Deokyi \u2192 me.\n\u201cHow could you\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHyuur.\nCthugha was again transformed into a great flame. This living flame erupted in rage in all directions and began to burn everything.\n\u201cMaster, fury, run away.\u201d\nThe fire spirits retreated, and the flames burned.\n\u201cI trusted her and handed her a stone of power. She tricked me! It\u2019s not supposed to be a stone that I gave humans so they can use my power recklessly!\u201d\n\u201cEu, aaaa\u2026..!\u201d\n\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s dangerous!\u201d\nChoi Cedric pulled me back, who almost got caught in the flames.\nCthugha, who was angry to the point that he looked like he would devour everything, quickly extinguished the push-type flames. The drooping red hair looked sullen.\n\u201cHaa \u2026 I thought it was strange.\u201d\nCthugha murmured desolately.\n\u201cI summoned the stone containing my power several times. Originally, she should have been summoned, but no matter what I did, there was no response. I managed to summon it today, but a brick building flew in.\u201d\nIt\u2019s you! Because of you, the whole store was summoned here.\nI found the culprit. In my mind, I wanted to grab his neck and shake him.\n\u201cMaster, heartbreak, sorrow.\u201d\nPepe said something that I didn\u2019t know whether it was consolation or not.\n\u201cThat \u2026 I have listened to you well, and I understand the situation well. Look, umh \u2026 cheer up.\u201d\nIf the cause is Cthugha, then Cthugha must have the solution as well.\n\u201cIs there any way to return to the original state with the building here?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThis is my garden. Once in, it is mine, the owner of the garden.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Where do you even get that idea? What kind of \u2018if you cross over with gold, it\u2019s all mine\u2019 is this?!\u201d\nAlthough I protested, Cthugha\u2019s reaction was cold.\n\u201cThe smell of Heesun remained in the building.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes. It\u2019s the building she lived in until she died.\u201d\n\u201cIf so, the building is a trace of Miss Heesun. Feel free to go back if you want to, but leave the trace of Heesun here.\u201d\nHe\u2019s crazy\u2026.\nYou said it\u2019s a pure relationship, a pure relationship!\nI should have recognized it since he mentioned the smell earlier.\nReal estate means a lot to modern people, but he wants me to leave it behind!\nStill, Cthugha was stubborn and I had no confidence to fight and win against him, who appeared to be close to God.\nAt that time when I was stuck in the situation, Lime, who had been quietly silent and held on my lap, bravely stepped forward.\n\u201cKkyuuuu.

However, I guess it\u2019s a fate that we met like this. You are like my granddaughter.\u201d\nCthugha smiled and continued.\n\u201cGood. I will make a contract with you.\u201d\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nrice shuttle: \ubc25\uc154\ud2c0 (babsyeoteul). The word shuttle (\uc154\ud2c0) comes from the popular slang bread shuttle (\ube75\uc154\ud2c0), \ube75  means bread and \uc154\ud2c0 means the english word \u2018shuttle\u2019.  It\u2019s means a shuttle (bus) that delivers breads to another person. The term was first used among Korean High School students and refers to a person who is being bullied, and does little errands such as delivering bread to their classmates. In here, Rieul used \ubc25 (boiled rice) to express that Cthugha is like someone who was builed by her grandmother to deliver rice.\nGrandma basically gave false hope to a God\u2026.\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

He must have been worried about Kwon Rieul a lot, and he should let her know about the good news right away.\nKwon Jiwoon immediately picked up his phone and called Kwon Rieul. However, there was only a dial tone and the phone call not get connected. Her KakaoTalk is also inactive.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not answering the phone right now. I\u2019ll try to contact her again in a little while.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have time. We have to meet her soon!\u201d\n\n\u201cFather, calm down.\u201d\nHowever, Kwon Seokmin looked impatient. In the end, Kwon Jiwoon could not win over his father and got up.\n\u201cRieul recently opened a cafe. The location is quite unique, but \u2026 it\u2019s very delicious. If we go there, we will meet her.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d\nHe deliberately postponed the interviews, but there were several reporters in front of the guild to see where the rumor came from.\nIt is not easy to solve the family affair. The three of them went out the back door to avoid the reporters and headed to the cafe run by Kwon Rieul.\n\u2026and they were surprised.\n\u201cSon, I can\u2019t see the cafe with my eyes. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nNo. 16 Dungeon Gate 3 Street, Jung-gu, Seoul.\nThe whole cafe building disappeared.\n\nAnd just at that moment.\nAnother person was surprised to see Cafe Rieul completely disappeared.\n\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nJu Noeul lamented.\nWhat kind of Wizard of Oz is this\u2026\u2026.\n***\n\u201cPepe, swimming, possible!\u201d\nA serene summer beach under the cliffs.\nWhen Pepe, the fire spirit, made a big gesture, the fire blazed and the waves split sideways.\n\u2026\u2026can I call this swimming?\nThe smell of salt in the air became stronger as the seawater vaporized in Pepe\u2019s heat. Soon the sea floor was completely exposed and the yellow road continued. Seaweed and seashells are trampled on.\n\u201cHere, guests, banquet!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026 well, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nAt the end of the road, I could see a small island. The star sign on the map pointed exactly to that place.\nI don\u2019t know what it is there, but that place has an event. Is there no other way but to go?\n\u201cThis guy, why can\u2019t you hold me more carefully, waeolg!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Walk on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, it\u2019s not bad if you do this.\u201d\nAs for the animals, Ash and I decided to walk with one each. I was with Lime and Ash took Mieum.\nMieum tossed to and fro for a long time as she felt uncomfortable in Ash\u2019 arms before she finally found a pose she liked and made a whining sound.\nThe Golden Triangular Rhino will be left in the barn. It was a long distance to walk with a cow, and the cow didn\u2019t want to move because it liked the barn.\nIt\u2019s been a while since the four of us walked behind Pepe.\n\u201cHeuk, huuuh\u2026.\u201d\nI breathed out. My eyes were tingling with sweat.\nIt was terribly hot\u2026\u2026.\nLime\u2019s body was cool, so it felt good to touch it, but there was a limit for that.\nThe effect of ice cream coffee has already ceased. Furthermore, the more I moved, the stronger the heat became.\n\u201cPepe, hukh \u2026 how long do we have left?\u201d\nI spoke to Pepe, the only one here who was fine.\n\u201cSoon, arrival, relax!\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it so hot here?\u201d\n\u201cHot? Pepe, cool!\u201d\nYeah, you would \u2026 my body is not made of fire, I felt like I\u2019m going to die\u2026.\nFortunately, however, as Pepe said, we soon arrived at our destination.\nThere was a village on a small island that I thought would only take 10 minutes to go around. Pepe led us to the village. Stone houses were sparsely visible, and there was a large temple in the center of the village. It was like an altar to worship the Eternal Living Flame.\nAnd soon, I discovered the identity of this tremendous heat.\n\u201cWho, visitor, guest?\u201d\nBeyond the stone wall, the fire spirits that looked just like Pepe stuck their heads out. It was so hot because of the heat they radiated.\n\u201cPepe, home, welcome.\u201d\n\u201cGuests, welcome, banquet!\u201d\nThe little spirits surrounded us and chattered. If possible, I would like to inform these spirits that there is a thing called structural prepositions in Korean. The words that were heard in pieces seemed to mean that they welcomed us as guests.\nPepe and the spirits took us to the center of town to hold a welcome party. However, there was an unexpected content among the words that were heard in pieces.\n\u201cHuh? There is other visitor besides us?\u201d\n\u201cTraveler, distress, visit.\u201d\nAlmost at the same time, an unfamiliar voice was heard in front of me.\n\u201cAh, hot, it\u2019s hot!\u201d\nNo, it\u2019s not an unfamiliar voice.\n\u201cHa, I understand that you really want to see it, but it gets hot when you touch it all of  a sudden. Yes, one by one, stand in line and watch one by one.\u201d\nThere was a man showing his weapon to the crowd of fire spirits. A face with a slightly frivolous atmosphere and upturned eyes caught my attention.\n\u201cOh, you guys, haha. Do you want to shake my hand? We can\u2019t shake hands because my palm will burn, but what about autographs?\u201d\nAnd this unbearable way of speaking.\n\u2026.No way.\n\u201c\u2026.Huh!\u201d\nChoi Cedric, who turned his head and found me, was startled.\n\u2026\u2026why are you here?\n***\nThe table was set.\nA large stone dining table in the town square. To not overshadow the word banquet, these fire spirits served a fairly generous menu.\nPerhaps because it was an island in the middle of the sea, the main menu was seafood. It was fortunate that it wasn\u2019t a fire-baked stone or black charcoal.\n\u201cPepe, common sense, yes. Humans, stones, not eaten.\u201d\n\u201cUh \u2026 I\u2019m sorry for the misunderstanding.\u201d\n\u201cFood, delicious, eat!\u201d\nIn particular, the fresh tuna sashimi that I picked up with chopsticks was delicious. The tuna tataki looked appetizing, and the grilled tuna tasted savory.\nThe heat emitted by the fire spirits cooked the seafood in real time.\n\u201cWaeolg, waeooong (The hospitality is quite good)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Not bad.\u201d\nAfter confirming that the party ate the food satisfactorily, I turned my head toward Choi Cedric. I never thought I would meet this guy here.\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Me? I\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Cedric, who was about to eat the well-cooked grilled tuna, put down his chopsticks and answered.\n\u201cMy heart is heavy.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\nChoi Cedric said he has a hobby of taking a dungeon walk whenever he feels depressed. \nIs it the problem with the urban sprawl? Is it because there is not enough green space in Seoul? Leaving the decent park and taking a walk in the dungeon isn\u2019t a hobby that I can sympathize with as a human being, but \u2026 everyone has different ways to relieve stress, so let\u2019s understand it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to do one round of the Great Dungeon Abyss.\u201d\n\u201cWait, is this Abyss?\u201d\n\u201cHuh, you didn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t know. I slept and woke up to find the whole store was here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the \u2026 listen.\u201d\nChoi Cedric continued his explanation in a pompous voice.\nIn the Great Dungeon Abyss, there is a floor called the Safe Zone. It is difficult to understand that \u2018Dungeon\u2019 and \u2018Safe\u2019 can be used in one sentence, but anyway, it is said to be so.\nTwenty years have passed since the huge dungeon suddenly appeared in the world. It wasn\u2019t that Hunters hadn\u2019t climbed the Great Dungeon for 20 years. The Safe Zone is where the moving gate was installed after the boss was eliminated.\n\u201cHmm, I understand. You\u2019re saying this is the Safe Zone, right?\u201d\nI picked up squid sashimi, which was raw squid sashimi, and asked. However, Choi Cedric shook his head.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..what?\u201d\nChoi Cedric was originally planning to go back after taking a walk in the Safe Zone. But he didn\u2019t want to go home, so he went a little further and deeper. Then, he was caught up in a sudden etheric wave and fell into this field.\nI expected a systematic explanation, but in the end, Choi Cedric is also in distress.\n\u201cHaaa, you \u2026 I thought you knew how to get out.\u201d\n\u201cI can go out?\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nChoi Cedric took out a teleport scroll from the inventory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scroll that teleports to the gate. You can use this.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back when you have something like this\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cJust because. I don\u2019t want to go home today.\u201d\n\u201cWaeooong (Hoo, this guy\u2019s natural flirting is pretty good).\n\u201c\u2026.Flirting?\u201d\nAsh turned his head with a sulky look. I pushed the grilled squid on the plate in front of Mieum. Fortunately, Mieum stopped talking nonsense because she was eating squid.\nAt that time, a fire spirit called Choi Cedric.\n\u201cHuman, friend, help.\u201d\n\u201cOh, seriously, I\u2019m in trouble if you keep calling me that. Yes, I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201d\nTuk, a freshly caught fish was placed on the table. \nShashashak. Choi Cedric took out his sword and sliced the fish in an instant. The fire spirit applauded and cheered.\n\u201cCutting, splendid, flawless.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Do you want me to do this too? Yeah, I can\u2019t help it then.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect, gorgeous, wonderful.\u201d\nHe\u2019s excited\u2026..\nSo, he doesn\u2019t know the details, but he doesn\u2019t want to go home and the reactions of the spirits were spectacular. Intoxicated by the response of these spirits, he was spending time here without returning immediately.\nChoi Cedric, who returned after slicing a few more fish, handed me his teleport scroll.\n\u201cI have an extra, so use this if you need it.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, thank you. Thank you so much!\u201d\nI accepted it without hesitation. I can go back if I have this scroll. If I can go back, it doesn\u2019t matter whether there\u2019s a star sign on the map or an event.\nHowever, I was devastated by Choi Cedric\u2019s words that followed after that.\n\u201cBut can you use it?\u201d\n\u201cUh \u2026 why?\u201d\nIs there any side effect? Or is it an item that cannot be used by F-class Awakeners?\n\u201cYou said you came with the whole building earlier? If you use the scroll and go back, what will you do with the property?\u201d\n\u2026\u2026.\n\u2026\u2026.\nAh, that\u2019s right. My store\u2026.\nIf I go back just with my body like this, I will only have a few family members without a house or a store\u2026.\nAt that moment of frustration, a huge flame suddenly appeared in the sky.\nFlames swirled in the air. A haze rose from the intense heat that could not be compared to before.\nThe fire spirits bowed down on the floor and cheered.\n\u201cMaster, appear, welcome.\u201d\n\u201cMaster, hooray, welcome.\u201d\n[The Great Old One: The Eternal Living Flame Cthugha has appeared.][Welcome to the Garden of Cthugha, the Eternal Living Flame.]\nThe flame that floated in the air gradually turned into a human form.\nRed hair flutters in the air. \nTak! The man who set foot on the floor with a bang looked like a human being made from flame. He looked like he was in his fifties. His hair, beard, and eyes were all red.\nPepe ran forward and bowed his head.\n\u201cMaster, Pepe, come home. Humans, home, help.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Hmm. Yes, you\u2019ve had a hard time.\u201d\nFortunately, the master of the spirits used the prepositions properly.\nHe looked at me in a crooked posture. Then, his face crumpled.\n\u201cWhy is there a human here who smells like Heesun?\u201d\nWhat \u2026 who?\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nnext\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nHi, hello again everyone. I\u2019m deeply sorry for the sudden long lack of updates T__T brought back my laptop to the service center and after a week, I took it back because not only they can\u2019t fix the problem, they added the problem \u2026 and they reinstalled my laptop to Windows 7 for absolutely no reason and now I\u2019m just sad because I lost all my apps, my saved settings, and now the windows notepad in my laptop can\u2019t read the korean file correctly\u2013\nso yeah, now I\u2019ll just accept this fate and start saving to buy a laptop.

After selecting the documents, the interview was conducted.\n\u201c\u2026.what is this?\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon, who was exhausted of interviewing one after another since morning, picked up the paper on the desk. The applicant in front of him answered quickly with a bright expression.\n\u201cThis is my heart, please accept it!\u201d\nIt was a slogan that said, \u2018I love you Eunrang\u2018.\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Haaa.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon touched his forehead.\nAt one time, there was a time when making a Hunter\u2019s name, different from the real name, was popular. It was a time when the public\u2019s attention was different because there were fewer rankers than now. The influence of the No. 1 ranker, Muwon, was also significant. Everyone tried to come up with a cool Hunter name like Muwon.\nNow, most of the Hunters just use their real names, so it\u2019s a dead trend.\nKwon Jiwoon also used the name \u2018Eunrang\u2018 immediately after awakening due to the influence of the trend. However as time went by, the name was a little, no, a lot \u2026embarrassing. Is it a little better than the Twitter nickname he made when he was in middle school? Today, the name is the same as his black history.\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bdaring to pick a name that has become a black history as a slogan and hand it over\u2026.\n\u2026.is she making fun of him?\nIt was at the moment when Kwon Jiwoon was about to notify the applicant \u2018I love you Eunrang\u2019 that she was rejected.\n\u201cGuard, call the guard!

Let\u2019s come over here and talk.\u201d\nBump! The intruder, who shook off the dissuading staff, opened the door without hesitation.\nHe was a middle-aged man who looked like a scoundrel. He is obscured by his messy hair and beard, but his face is familiar.\nFor some reason, he was with the new S-class, Hunter Choi Yichan.\nThe man shouted, avoiding the employee who was about to take him out immediately.\n\u201cI\u2019m your father!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\n***\nKorea\u2019s No. 1 Hunter Community \u2013 Hunter Channel.\nFree Forum Board.\n\u2014 Ranking, The Slave Hunters Guild is banned.

The anguish and anxiety of the past swept his mind like a wave.\n\u201cHow come the guild guards don\u2019t recognize the guild leader? Son, we almost couldn\u2019t even have a reunion between father and son because\u00a0I couldn\u2019t come into my guild.\u201d\n\u201cPlease understand. Over time, almost everyone has changed.\u201d\nKwon Seokmin looked confused at the remark.\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Why did you change all the guards just because I was away for a month? Did you actually try to kick your father out? Are you succeeding to the throne?\u201d\n\u201cWait, a month?\u201d\nIt was not uncommon for the time flow inside and outside the dungeon to be different. \nHowever, it has been at least six years. It was surprising when the time difference reached six years.\n\u201cNo wonder I thought you had grown up a lot. It looks like the building has been remodeled. Gosh, what year is it now?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026. Year 20\u00d7\u00d7.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! Damn, I skipped too much time. Still, it\u2019s still okay if the error rate is within 3 years. If we had any further differences, we would have a big problem.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026father?\u201d\nMumbling, words that do not make sense followed. This was not the situation to ask what had happened in the past.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon slowly lowered his arm that was about to hug his father in emotion.\nYes, how can he understand how his father, who returned after many years, feels? Kwon Jiwoon decided to give his father more time to calm his mind and turned his head to the side.\nChoi Yichan, who had followed Kwon Seokmin, bowed his head.\n\u201cHello! You\u2019re Rieul\u2019s cousin, right? I\u2019ve  heard about you a lot.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. What\u2019s your relationship with our Rieul?\u201d\n\u201cHaha, I\u2019m her friend from high school \u2026 for now.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon chuckled.\nHer friend is the new S-class Hunter that the Dungeon Management Office is currently looking for. It\u2019s like that Hunter from Cheongna and Choi Cedric as well. Somehow there\u2019s a lot of weird guys around his sister.\nBe that as it may.\n\u201cHow did you find my father?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 by chance, in the dungeon, I happened to run into him.\u201d\nIt was the moment when Kwon Jiwoon slightly frowned at the ambiguous answer and was about to ask again.\n\u201cHuk, that\u2019s right, Rieul!\u201d\nKwon Seokmin, who was muttering to himself, screamed.\n\u201cSon, where is Rieul?

            "c95": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThe sun is hot and the air is humid. Even though I took out thin clothes right away and put them on, the effect is insignificant. I was sweating profusely just by going out for a while and bringing the Golden Triangular Rhinoceros.\nIt would have been nice if the the air conditioner had been installed in advance, but now I only could taste the regret.\nHowever, how could I have guessed that the building would suddenly transport over a cliff on the beach in midsummer weather like this?\n[Item: Ice Cream Coffee (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 01:00:00)Effect: Your body will become very cold.]\n\nWhat caught my eye at that moment was the effect of ice cream coffee. With the sweet taste, cold energy flowed into my body. It was cool as if it\u2019s the blessed by Willis Carrier (the inventor of modern air conditioner). The heat has cooled down and I\u2019m feeling a bit refreshed.\nI murmured, emptying the rest of the coffee.\n\u201cThis is probably what they called leisure in the midst of business\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat Korean-Chinese phrase is accurate, waeoong.\u201d\nWhile tackling, Mieum also drank the ice cream coffee. I thought it must be hotter for her because she was a fur beast.\nI did get some milk though. About where on earth is this place or how can we get back, nothing has been resolved.\nStill, the fact that the coffee is delicious is comforting.\n\u201c\u2026.? What is it?\u201d\nAt that moment, Ash raised his head as if he had sensed something.\nStrange. I barely cooled down, but I felt the heat again. Furthermore, the heat grew stronger and stronger, as if a fire had been set nearby.\nI got surprised when I turned my head along with Ash\u2019s gaze.\nIt wasn\u2019t just my feeling.\nThere was a real fire in front of the store.\n\u201cFire\u2026.! Where\u2019s the fire extinguisher? We have to bring the fire extinguisher!\u201d\nAs I rushed to put out the fire, I was startled.\nWhen I looked closely, the fireball had the shape of a child. It looked like a fire spirit.\nAnd the fire spirit, who was trudging towards this side, began to shed tears.\nIt sounds strange that a fire sheds tears, but that was the only way I could express it. The tears that flowed from the spirit\u2019s eyes turned into water vapor and disappeared.\n\u201cHuhuhu\u2026.\u201d\nIt really sounds like, \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with me, so ask me quickly\u2018.\nThe mournful weeping continued for a long time. The spirit glanced at this side and then started crying again. It seemed that the spirit in front of the store would not move.\nAfter a moment of contemplation, I approached the fire spirit. I\u2019m worried because the spirit is crying a lot, and it was hard to ignore those eyes that say \u2018come and talk to me quickly\u2018.\nIt will be difficult when the spirit who\u2019s tired of crying comes into the store. Tables and chairs are all made of wood.\n\u201cHey, why are you crying?\u201d\nThe fire spirit raised his head, scattering water vapor.\n\u201cCold fire, gnome, bad.\u201d\n\u201cCold fire?\u201d\n\u201cThey, I, cooled down. Pepe, swimming, impossible. Pepe, home, impossible.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is your home?\u201d\n\u201cSea, Pepe, Master.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I see\u2026.\u201d\nI have no idea\u2026\u2026.\nPerhaps it was because there was no inquiry into the language system, it was difficult to understand the words of the fellow who just laid out words. \nThis is what I finally figured out after repeating the question and answer for a long time while sweating in the hot heat.\nHis name is Pepe. He is a fire elemental spirit, and he serves the master of \u2018Eternal Living Flame\u2018. One day, however, the Master\u2019s family, a piece of flame, ran away from home. It is said that Pepe went on a trip to find the piece that ran away from home under the order of his Master.\n\u201cPiece, run away, bad.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cHuh, Lime-ah, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026.\u201d\nSlowly, Lime hid behind me. The slime seemed to be avoiding Pepe.\nLime, don\u2019t tell me you\u2026\u2026.\nFor now, I calmed down Lime, who was clinging to me, and kept listening to the story.\nHe said that after looking for a runaway piece for a long time, he finally found a piece of flame. He swallowed the piece to take it right away. However, it was actually a piece of cold flame that was different from what Pepe was looking for. The action cooled his body and made him unable to swim in the sea.\n\u201cMaster, wait, sea.\u201d\nHe cried because he had to return to his master\u2019s side, but he couldn\u2019t cross the sea.\nAfter much deliberation, I spoke in a cautious tone so as not to hurt this spirit.\n\u201cPepe, look, it\u2019s supposed to be \u2026 fire goes out when it touches water.\u201d\nBut Pepe shook his head firmly.\n\u201cPossible, swim, ring.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Ring?\u201d\n\u201cCthugha-nim, ring, fire. Pepe, swim, possible.\u201d\n\u201cAre you talking about this?\u201d\nHe nodded.\nWhat Pepe was pointing to was a ring with a red stone in my hand. Cthuga\u2019s ring. It is an item that I use to roast coffee after buying it from Grandma Kim Deokyi.\n\u201cEternal, flame, fire.\u201d\nIs that okay? Pepe\u2019s body is also fire, and this ring is also used to light fire, so it\u2019s okay, right?\nI used the power of the ring towards Pepe in doubt.\nHyuur. Pepe\u2019s body caught the fire, and I felt an incomparable heat.\\\n\u201cPepe, warmth, joy.\u201d\nHowever, it was only for a short time that the intense flames enveloped his body. Pepe\u2019s body cooled again.\n\u201cPepe, cold, sadness.\u201d\nPepe burst into tears. While I was thinking about how to soothe this spirit that is scattering water vapor\u2026.\nTiling! Tiling! A notification window popped up with a cheerful sound that didn\u2019t fit the atmosphere. It was a quest.\n[Main Quest: Saving Pepe the Fire SpiritYou have met Pepe, a pitiful spirit who has lost his way.Let\u2019s warm Pepe\u2019s body and send him home.Since ancient times, alcohol has been used to warm the body. Coffee with alcohol will work.When you achieve it, the Eternal Living Flame will honor you.Item Required: Irish CoffeeDeliver Irish Coffee to Pepe: 0/1Reward: Starlight of Fomalhaut, Corresponding Dungeon Map]\nThere were two things worth noting in this random quest.\nSo far, the main quest has only appeared in a large number of cases. Therefore, it was highly likely that this quest would not only help Pepe who came across by chance, but also have an answer to the current situation.\nSecond, a map given as a reward.\nStarlight of Fomalhaut \u2026 is it an item? I don\u2019t know what it is, so let\u2019s skip it for now.\nThe important thing is the map. If I have a map, I can see what this place looks like. The exit may be marked, or I may get a hint of how to get out of this unidentified dungeon.\nThere is no time for hesitation. I checked the recipe and asked Pepe right away.\n\u201cPepe, how old are you?\u201d\n\u201cAge, question, boomer.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKoreans, rank consciousness, bad.\u201d\nHe was a very intelligent spirit\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, it\u2019s because it\u2019s the information we need to help Pepe.\u201d\n\u201cPepe, early, 1200 years old.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a lot more than I expected, but \u2026 he\u2019s not a minor, so that\u2019s fine.\nI asked Pepe to wait in front of the store for a moment, and then I returned to the store.\nWhiskey was needed to make Irish Coffee, the condition of the quest. When I selected whiskey in the dimensional shop, a warning window popped up.\n[Excessive drinking is bad for health and causes abnormalities.][Are you 19 years or older?Yes \u261c / No ]\nThat\u2019s pretty thorough\u2026\u2026.\nWhen I selected \u2018yes\u2018, a small glass bottle of whiskey fell into his hands. When I opened the lid, a strong smell came out. The alcohol seemed quite strong.\nI added sugar to the whiskey and heated it to the point where it wouldn\u2019t boil. Then, espresso and hot water were added one after another.\nNext, I needed whipped cream. The whipped cream was obtained by manipulating the buttons on the milking machine installed on the Golden Triangular Rhino.\nWhen I filled this whipped cream to the end of the glass, it\u2019s done.\n[Item: Irish Coffee (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 01:00:00)Effect: Your body will become very warm.]\nA strong scent emanated from the glass. The harmonious aroma of sugar, coffee, and whiskey made my mind relaxed.\nI immediately brought the glass to Pepe, who was waiting in front of the store.\n\u201cPepe, drink this.\u201d\n\u201cSmell, good, drink.\u201d\nPepe took the glass. The glass began to melt as soon as Pepe touched it, but fortunately, he was able to drink it all before it completely melted.\nAnd as the last drop of Irish coffee disappeared into his mouth, a powerful flame enveloped Pepe\u2019s body.\n\u201cPepe, hot, joy.\u201d\nMy sweat dripped down. It was so hot that I had to step back to avoid getting burned.\nWe have succeeded!\n[Congratulations!

You can observe the stars of Fomalhaut star in the space.][You have obtained the Dungeon Map.]\n\u201cPepe, thank you, repay.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to repay me.\u201d\nI did that just to complete the quest and get the map anyway.\n\u201cSavior, my home, invitation\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHowever, it seems that the alcohol in the Irish coffee was too strong. Drunken Pepe suddenly began to get excited.\n\u201cInvitation, banquet, excitement\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nEvery time Pepe moved, a burning flame spread out in all directions. At this rate, Pepe\u2019s flames would burn our house.\n\u201cOh, calm down, Pepe! Hold on. Calm down.\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cInvitation, decline, impossibe\u2026..!\u201d\nThe flames made scorched marks on the store\u2019s brick walls. Just before the fire spreads to the trees in the yard.\nIt was Ash who calmed Pepe. He threw a violent glance at the blazing flame.\n\u201cCalm down. What rudeness is this to my master!\u201d\n\u201cWorld, Twilight, Demon King\u2026.? Why, here, exist?\u201d\n\u201cThe spirit of fire, be courteous to my master.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Ash, if you say that about your employer, it might be misleading.\u201d\nI hope you don\u2019t misunderstand. The only contract between Asj and I is an employment contract that complies with the Labor Standards Act.\nMaster, it sounds a little \u2026 wrong.\n\u201cMaster, I don\u2019t know, sorry.\u201d\nFush, the flame died down.\nDramatic reconciliation between non-human beings \u2026 no, it seemed that the hierarchy has been sorted out.\nPepe, who became much calmer than before, hung his head sadly.\n\u201cPepe, friend, none. Alone, home, lonely. Apology, reflection, goodbye.\u201d\nThe tears that overflowed from Pepe\u2019s eyes became steam and scattered. He bowed his politely. I hurriedly called Pepe, who was about to leave.\n\u201cNo, Pepe, I will accept the invitation. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cReally, joy, excitement!\u201d\nI glanced at the map I just received as a quest reward.\nA small island in the middle of the sea. A large star was drawn where Pepe\u2019s house was. The \u2018Event\u2019 mark flickered.\nI don\u2019t know exactly what kind of event it is.\nPepe\u2019s invitation could be a solution to this unanswered situation.\n\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nleisure in the midst of business: \ub9dd\uc911\ud55c [\u5fd9\u4e2d\u9591] leisure in intervals of one\u2019s business; a moment of relief (snatched) from pressure of business; a break in the pressure of one\u2019s (official) work.

His face was thin because he lost weight, but his eyes were gleaming.\nIf this wasn\u2019t in the dungeon, the awful-looking man would be misunderstood as a homeless person.\nHowever, Choi Yichan approached him and bowed his head.\n\u201cAhjussi, hello!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nThe middle-aged homeless man turned his head. He looked confused about  where he was.\n\u201cI\u2019ve met you once before, do you remember me? I\u2019m a friend of Rieul, Choi Yichan. You\u2019re Rieul\u2019s uncle, right?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Huh?\u201d\nHunter Kwon Seokmin, the father of Kwon Jiwoon and the uncle of Kwon Rieul, who went missing in the maze dungeon a few years ago, looked surprised.\n***\n\u201cMmmoooo.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Go, go.\u201d\nIt\u2019s on its own. A big cown sat down in the space and cried. In the meantime, the area was expanded as a quest reward.\nAs I got closer, the notification rang.\n[You can build an exclusive barn. Do you want to build it?Yes \u261c / No ]\nIn an instant, a barn with a roof and a feeder was built.\n[Summon: The Golden Triangular Rhinoceros in love likes the special congratulatory address.][Advanced Automatic Milking Machine can be installed. Do you want to install it?Yes \u261c / No ]\nA milking machine with a thick tube and a stainless steel barrel was installed on the body of the Golden Triangular Rhino. I immediately pressed the button on the milking machine. For a moment, there was the sound of a machine running.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nDrip. White milk started pouring into the stainless steel barrel.\n[Item: Freshly Squeezed Milk (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Milk freshly squeezed from from a rare A-class Golden Triangular Rhinoceros.A rich taste different from ordinary milk.It makes the quality of the drink better.]\nThis milk has one more star than when it was purchased from the Dimensional Shop. It was worthwhile to bring the Golden Triangular Rhinoceros after all the hard work.\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026\u201d\nLime bounced its body as if telling me that it had done all the hard work.\nAnyway, since I finally got my hands on the milk, I decided to have a cup of coffee before I looked around more.\nAt the moment, there is no hint about where this place is, and the freshly squeezed milk with a fragrant smell looked very delicious.\nCan\u2019t I drink coffee in the dungeon?\nOf course, I can. Sure. Yes, dungeon exploration is also about eating.\nI went straight out of the space with milk and prepared to make coffee. I displayed the recipe list that was much longer than the beginning and thought about what to make for a while.\nThe answer soon came out. That\u2019s the menu I need now.\nIce cream coffee. This is a menu that I hadn\u2019t made since Choi Yichan left with only one note.\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t make it because of him. There were no customers looking for this menu because it was just winter.\nI can\u2019t even contact him through phone, and I don\u2019t know where and what Choi Yichan is doing.\nThe Dungeon Management Office is looking for him like crazy, but if he has not yet been found in this narrow Korea, is he still inside the dungeon? I hope everything\u2019s all right.\nWith that thought in mind, I quickly made coffee. I put ice, espresso, milk, and vanilla syrup in a glass. It was done after pouring plenty of ice cream and sprinkling chocolate powder.\nThis time, I also served the coffee to Mieum and Lime in a small glass. Although they were not usually interested in coffee, they drank the coffee without saying a word.\n\u201cCome on, Ash, try it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Okay.\u201d\nFirst, take a bite of ice cream, then mix it with coffee and take another bite. Naturally, exclamations flowed out.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to live a little now\u2026.\u201d\nAsh agreed with a nod.\nIt\u2019s a sweet coffee with milk that I haven\u2019t tasted in a long time. Of course, the taste is good, but there was another reason why I chose this menu now.\nBecause it was so hot right here.\nIt was winter outside, but in one night, I transported over to a cliff on the beach in midsummer.\n\n\nprevious\nnext\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nStorm and Stress: \uc9c8\ud48d\ub178\ub3c4, a term to describe the emotional and behavioral troubles of adolescence.

I can fix it, so let\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a foolish human being. You can\u2019t handle one of these things right.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? \u2026 uugh.\u201d\nThere was no time to question the sudden change of tone. Lee Sein was nauseous and hurriedly covered her mouth.\n\nIn front of her eyes, the human form of Aeon began to collapse. No, that can\u2019t be human. Such a terrible thing. What the hell is going on\u2026..\nThe thinking did not continue. Just looking at the collapsing figure, she felt the pain of something rubbing the delicate texture of her mind with sandpaper.\nAfter several seconds, Aeon turned into a half-melted, amorphous black mass.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe figure resembled the black mucus that attacked the city a few days ago.\nLee Sein suddenly remembered a name.\n\u2026.The Faceless One.\nIndeed, it\u2019s a suitable name for the object in front of her.\n\u201cUa-aaagh! Go away!\u201d\nSnap, the black mass collapsed and attacked Lee Sein.\n\u2018I have to use items for self-defense\u2026..\u2019\nLee Sein\u2019s class is a secondary wizard. He always carried a self-defense item that was simply activated to compensate for his lack of physical power. To compensate for the lack of physical strength, she always carried self-defense items that were simple to activate.\nHowever, before she could use her hands, the item that touched the half-melted Aeon melted away.\n\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d\nResistance is not enough. Lee Sein, who fell on the floor, threw the vase she caught while reaching out wildly.\nClatter! \nThere was a loud bang. The thrown vase was hit head-on by Aeon.\n\u201cHeuk, heugh \u2026. heugh \u2026 is it done?\u201d\nStartle. Aeon stopped moving. She was relieved for a while, then the half-melted face burst into laughter.\n\u201cKehehehe, hehehee, heheehee\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d\nWith a bizarre laughter, Aeon came closer. She thought he should run away, but her body did not move. As she witnessed the unknown horror, it seemed like he was cutting her mind with a carving knife.\nAeon, which melted completely and became a black mass, grabbed Lee Sein. Then, without hesitation, the black mucus was pushed into Lee Sein\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s suffocating.\n\u201cEu-euugh! Uugh!\u201d\n\u2018I have to tell Choi Cedric\u2026.\u2019\nIt was the last thought she had before she lost her mind.\nThe door opened again when the struggle had stopped completely. A Hunter of C&L Corporation spoke carefully.\n\u201cCEO Lee Sein-nim, I heard a loud noise. Is there something wrong?\u201d\nLee Sein slowly rose up. She combed her disheveled hair with her hand, arranged her crumpled suit, and turned back to look at the Hunter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I slipped my hand and dropped the vase. Can you call someone to clean it up?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll call them in a minute.\u201d\nThe Hunter, who was about to close the door and leave, tilted his head slightly and turned his head again.\n\u201cUh, by the way, CEO-nim.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cWere you alone? I saw Aeon-ssi coming this way earlier.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been alone the whole time. Maybe he went somewhere else?\u201d\nThe eyes of Lee Sein, who gave that answer, glowed dull like imitation jewels.\n***\nIt was a normal morning that day.\nAfter turning off the alarm on my phone three times, I reluctantly got up.\nI gave food for Mieum and Lime, then I ate breakfast on the first floor with Ash. Originally, I was going to make egg rolls, but I failed to flip it, so it became scrambled eggs. Well, it\u2019s cooked, so that\u2019s enough.\nAsh had been sulking for some reason since last night, but he didn\u2019t skip breakfast. I\u2019m glad, you have to eat well before going to work.\nAfter finishing the meal, I checked the stock. I still have enough coffee beans.\nThis was because I obtained an item after went through 10 consecutive rounds of golden drawing tickets accumulated as rewards for quests or achievements.\n[Item: Fully Automatic Large Roaster for Business (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Roast anything and everything.A fully automatic system that anyone can use easily.It can be installed in the space to save space.It can be used conveniently with the Cthugha\u2019s Ring.\u203b Free installation]\nThe large roster that I was eagerly waiting for!\nI fell in love as soon as I saw this item. Now, I can easily roast a large amount of coffee beans.\nSo, shall we make a little more sugar?\nThinking that way, I casually looked out the window and got surprised.\n\u201cHuh\u2026.?\u201d\nBlue sky and warm morning sun. The view is open and refreshing.\nDoes anyone realise what\u2019s weird here?\nThe ominous appearance of Abyss, the Great Dungeon that always looked big in the window, was nowhere to be seen.\nNo, more than that.\nI rushed out and checked the outside.\nSshwaa~\nI heard the sound of waves. Sunlight poured down over the golden sandy beach, and fantasy-style buildings were sparsely visible in the distance.\n\u201cWhere am I\u2026.?\u201d\nThe outside of the store had become a strange place.\nTiling, the alarm sounded.\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Sub Quest: A Dungeon Walk\u2019.Please collect the rewards.]\nCafe Rieul was placed on a cliff overlooking the sea. \nThe word \u2018placed\u2018 for a building is awkward, but this situation can only be expressed that way.\nDid a hurricane happen while I was asleep yesterday? It\u2019s not some sort of Wizard of Oz, how did the whole store building move to a strange place?\nI gazed blankly at the blue sea out the window.\nYes, I like the sea, too. A peaceful summer resort is great. A vacation where you lie on a sunbed and do nothing, then eat and do nothing again. It\u2019s fantastic.\nHowever, I did not want the whole store to fly to the sea.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here\u2026.\u201d\nI decided to calm down and see if there were any other abnormalities.\nThe inside of the store was as usual. The space was accessible as usual, and the electricity and water supply are fine. However, my phone has no connection.\nWhen I put down my phone that kept failing to connect, I found the quest completion notification blinking.\nWhat kind of quest was this? I checked the detailed explanation of the quest, and soon lamented.\n[Sub Quest: A Dungeon WalkYou\u2019re tired of your work, go away.Let\u2019s go around the dungeon, take care of your health, and refresh your mood.\nEnter a random dungeon: 1/1Rewards: EXP (500 EXP), 100 rubies, random recipe]\n[Experience: 500 EXP have been acquired.][You have reached Level 13.][You have acquired a new recipe \u2018Irish Coffee\u2019.]\n\u2026\u2026.Yeah, I got this quest.\nThe fact that this quest, which was constantly ignored, was suddenly completed, that is.\nThis is in the dungeon\u2026.\nSince I don\u2019t want to go into the dungeon, it throws the whole store into the dungeon while sleeping. It is truly a system of great thinking.\nI rubbed my forehead while glaring at the system notification, and Mieum protested next to me.\n\u201cWaeoolgh! Not me, it\u2019s not me! I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything yet?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just look at me suspiciously!\u201d\nThat\u2019s true. It was this cat that was most closely related to dungeons and the system here.\nHowever, Mieum ran wild, claiming that it was unfair, and eventually drooped her head and muttered.\n\u201cWaeoong \u2026 I don\u2019t have the authority to do such a big thing. What kind of power does a low position have\u2026.\u201d\nNext to this cat, who is in a state of wasting time and reciting the sorrow of a subordinate.\n\u201cKkyuuuuu! Kkyuu, kkyuuuu!\u201d\nThis time, Lime suddenly began to cry with tremendous momentum.\n\u201cLime-ah, what\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nSeeing the body bouncing like a rubber ball, it looks like it has something to say. I quickly took out the slime language translator and tried to interpret Lime\u2019s words.\n\u201cKkyuuu .. kkyuu!\u201d\n\u2501  I can feel His power up close.\n\u201cWho is he? Rather, Lime-ah, do you know where this place is?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyuu, kkyuuuuu!\u201d\n\u2501  The Eternal Living Flame, His great garden. Worship.\n\u201c\u2026.what? So who is that?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu, kkyu \u2026 kkyuuu\u2026.\u201d\n\u2501 3.14159265358979\u2026\u2026.\nThis time, the circumference rate came out. I asked a few more times, but the results were the same. The periodic table of elements, the quadratic formula, etc. Anyway, something irrelevant to what I was curious about came up and and then it ended up being silent.\nWhat a have-no-answer science slime.\nWhy are all the animals in my house like this\u2026.\nI gave up getting information from Mieum and Lime and approached the window. I opened the window slightly and looked outside with only my head sticking out. I looked around for a while, but all I could hear was the sound of the wind.\nAs I was doing it for a long time, Ash came closer and asked.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cAsh, shh!\u201d\nAlthough it is inside the dungeon, there is no sign of a monster.\nInstead, there is only a view that would fit a sub-title such as \u2018Relaxing Episode Summer Vacation\u2019.\nCan I go outside? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any dangerous monsters.\n\u201cOh, wait a minute, Ash! Don\u2019t go out on your own!\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to stay like that? If you\u2019re late, I\u2019ll leave you behind.\u201d\nAsh grabbed the doorknob and asked with a sullen look.\nEr, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like I can find a solution just by thinking about it here. I went out of the store after Ash.\nI searched around with Ash for a moment. However, there was nothing particularly noticeable, and the system window was still quiet.\nI was about to say let\u2019s not go too far and go back to the store first.\nRustling.\nI heard the sound of something stepping on dry grass right up close. At that moment, my nerves were on edge.\n\u201cAsh, stand back. There\u2019s something over there.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I\u2019ll take care of it if I have to.\u201d\nContrary to Ash\u2019s intention, the way he straightened his shoulders while saying that was very cute.\n\u201cSo if I protect you, you and I will\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWill?\u201d\n\u201cWill be\u2026!\u201d\nAs soon as Ash was about to say something, the presence beyond the bushes grew bigger. I was surprised as I stared over the bushes with the intention of roasting it with the power of the ring on my hand.\nIt was \u2026. a cow.\nA large body, black spotting fur on white background, and a mild-looking face. I rubbed my eyes and stared at it again, but it\u2019s really a cow. The only thing that was unusual was the golden triangular horns on its head.\nSoon, a system notification appeared in front of my eyes.\n[A Golden Triangular Rhinoceros (A) has appeared.]\nFortunately, the cow did not show aggression.\nThe cow, who glanced at us and soon lost interest, began to eat grass leisurely. The scenery worthy of the peaceful and idyllic summer vacation episode unfolded before my eyes.\nPhew, I\u2019m relieved. It\u2019s not a dangerous situation.\n\u201cAsh, let\u2019s go to the other side over there.\u201d\nBut the sound of Tiling, as if trying to grab my foot, rang again.\n[Sub Quest: Where is The Pounding Heart?Don\u2019t you need milk, an important ingredient that enriches the taste of coffee?A Golden Triangular Rhino appeared in front of you.Raise the favorability of the Golden Triangular Rhino to the highest level.If you succeed in taming it, you can get milk.Taming the Golden Triangular Rhinoceros: 0/1Rewards: Exclusive Barn, Advanced Automatic Milking Machine]\nEek\u2026..\nMilk is still out of stock at the Dimensional Shop, and as a result, and the range of menus has been greatly reduced.\nI need milk, I do need it, but \u2026 I don\u2019t want to get it from a cow myself.\nI hope this system remembers that I am a person who prefers to buy and spend money rather than DIY.\n[The Golden Triangular Rhinoceros is indifferent to you.][Favorability: \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661]\nThe problem is now that the entire store is teleported into an unknown dungeon.

Was it on the way back from buying the Purifying Tree at Dungeon Plant Farm? I vaguely remember that I said such a thing while talking about the twins, Joo Shinwoo and Joo Shinhee.\n\u201cThe moment I heard that, I felt relieved. I feel like you\u2019re telling me that I also haven\u2019t become a different person.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that \u2026 that\u2019s something anyone can say.\u201d\nIndeed, it is. It\u2019s not a big deal to hear what I said again through his mouth. If I randomly asked anyone on the street, they would say the same thing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s possible.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun readily affirmed what I said. He added straight away.\n\u201cBut Rieul-ssi is the only one who actually said that to me. So\u2026.\u201d\nHis voice fades into a trembling breath. I turned my head and looked at Ki Yoohyun quietly.\n\u201cSo I wanted to tell Rieul-ssi. About who I am. At least, I want to be honest with Rieul-ssi.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nBlurry? No presence? Why did I think of such a ridiculous idea earlier?\nThe man who\u2019s staring at me looks so clear. The eyes that shone even in the dark, the warm gaze, the well-shaped chin, and even the softly closed lips.\nMy heart was beating loudly.\nThis was different from the reflexive tension of facing a man who looked incredibly beautiful. I felt unfamiliar with this feeling.\nSurely, I am not sensible.  I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but\u2026.\nThe problem is that I\u2019m not ignorant enough to mistake this feeling as a sense of debt or concern for a man who sealed the Demon Gate alone.\nI hurriedly turned my head and murmured a little.\n\u201cThat \u2026 it\u2019s late, let\u2019s hurry up and go back. Ash asked me to come back quickly.\u201d\n\u201cHaha, yes.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun also turned around and straightened his posture. It was only after his eyes had moved away from me that I could barely breathe.\nMy grandmother told me to run away if I felt sorry for a man because I couldn\u2019t give an answer.\nGrandma, I think I\u2019m kind of screwed\u2026.\nWe hardly spoke to each other while driving toward the store. Finally, the car stopped in front of the store in a tense but not uncomfortable silence.\nI tried to open the car door quickly, but it didn\u2019t open well, perhaps because I was in a hurry. Ki Yoohyun\u2019s upper body got close to the point he could pull the lock without any problems. I tilted my head back in surprise.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, seat belt.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\nClick. Ki Yoohyun reached out toward me and unfastened the seat belt that had not been loosened properly. Then, he added with a smile.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, think carefully about my proposal.\u201d\n***\n\u201cHuh, ah, haaa\u2026..\u201d\nWhen the car that left after dropping me off was completely out of sight, I took a deep breath. As I inhaled the cold air, my mind finally calmed down. My cheeks were so hot that I could tell without having to touch them.\nCafe Rieul was right in front of me, but I couldn\u2019t go in like this. My face right now was obviously looked like someone who had something special happened to them.\nIt was difficult for me to respond to the overflowing curiosity of the animals in my family. I have to to cool my cheeks for a while before going inside.\nIt was when I was about to go around the alley in front of the store with that in mind.\n\u201c\u2026.Huh?\u201d\nI felt a strange gaze and turned my head.\nThere was a stranger standing on the other side of the road.\nThe first thing that stood out was a very beautiful appearance. Although the gender was not clear, I felt a strong charm that attracted my attention.\nHowever, the eyes that are just staring without any expression are creepy. The eyes that emptied the emotions that human eyes naturally contained seemed empty.\nI\u2019ll go into the store and cool my cheeks. At first glance, the stranger didn\u2019t seem like an ordinary person.\nI felt reluctant and tried to open the cafe door quickly, but my body didn\u2019t move. It was as if someone had paralyzed my body. \nThe strange man narrowed the distance with me in an instant.\nHis hand touched my cheek. I could feel a creepy coldness on my hot cheek. Before I knew it, a suspicious person\u2019s long finger slightly touched my hair and then moved away again.\n\u201c\u2026.it\u2019s you.\u201d\nWhat?\n\u201cThe owner of the key. The one who will reach the Ultimate Gate.\u201d\n\u2026.pardon?\nI want to ask what on earth is he talking about, but my lips don\u2019t move. I had no choice but listen to this strange man\u2019s words.\n\u201cAh, what absurd misunderstanding I have! Ha, hahaha \u2026 why did I just find out now! The change has already begun. So, this round has become an independent loop out of the infinite spiral. Yes, since the old human survived, or even earlier, the catastrophe had already begun.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve heard someone talking nonsense, without caring whether I listen to it or not, like this.\nThe eyes that were empty, as if they had been pierced with glass eyes, twinkled, and the feeling of this strange person was clearly felt.\nIt\u2019s joy. He trembled with joy.\nThe things that Ki Yoohyun said a while ago flashed my mind. He told me that a crazy religious group will appear.\nI knew it right away. It\u2019s this guy. There was a sapidity in his eyes, drunken with his own thoughts.\nThe strange person mumbled the unknown words for a while, and then smiled brightly.\nHick. It was like crazy pseudo-religion to do missionary work in a place like this. I want to run away, but my body doesn\u2019t move.\n\u201cAre you wary of me? Don\u2019t worry. Will I harm the owner of the key that finally appeared?\u201d\nAgain, his hand brushed my eyes and the pressure eased a little. I managed to utter my words with a barely suppressed breath.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 what is it?\u201d\nIs that it? You\u2019re Messiah or something, so pay for the apocalypse or buying a statue, is this that kind of pattern?\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know now. As long as you reach the Gate, we will naturally meet again.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know anything about that!\u201d\nI tried to speak as sharply as I could, but the trembling ends of my words were swallowed in my breath. Before I knew it, the sweat went into my eyes and it stung.\nI closed my eyes tightly, and when I opened them, the person holding me was gone.\n***\nCrash!\n\u201cHeuh, huuh\u2026.\u201d\nWhen I hurriedly opened the cafe door and entered, Ash and the animals turned their heads, as if they were waiting for me.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, waeong!\u201d\nWhen I heard Mieum\u2019s carefree voice, I finally realized that I had returned home. I wiped the cold sweat from my forehead with the back of my hand and pretended to be calm.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s too cold for run.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t see him like that, but he has no manners. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not taking you home after a date!\u201d\n\u201cDate?\u201d\nAsh asked sharply. Mieum added, throwing her front paws at Ash.\n\u201cThen what did you think the two went for, waeooong!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Humph.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t a date, and Ki Yoohyun took me to the front of the store.\nNo, rather than that, since when did Ash understand Mieum\u2019s words?\nThere was a lot of things to tackle, but I sat on the floor without saying anything. What had just happened was terrifying, and my body lost all strength. I murmured in my mind.\n\u2018What, I\u2019m scared\u2026.\u2019\nI should seriously consider Ki Yoohyun\u2019s proposal.\nOn the way back in the car, he made me an offer.\nThe proposal was to officially reveal <Cafe Rieul> as a cafe selling drinks with special effects. He said that it can be registered as a special business by requesting to the Dungeon Management Office. In return, he would make his guild guard this cafe in case something unpleasant happened.\nSo far, the cafe has been running without any problems, but it was unexpectedly popular. I don\u2019t know where and how the rumor spread.\nThe dream of a five-day work-weekend (which means five days of rest) has not been fulfilled, and there is no guarantee that it will be fine in the future even if it has been successful so far.\n\u2018But\u2026.\u2019\nSeeing my face filled with dislike, Ki Yoohyun added.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like having too many customers, you can only take a set number of people by reservation.\u201d\nAh. I didn\u2019t think of that.\nIt\u2019s not a damaging proposition for me. Rather, it\u2019s a proposal that doesn\u2019t benefit Ki Yoohyun.\nWhen I asked him that, Ki Yoohyun shook his head.\n\u201cNo way. If I can stably drink Rieul-ssi\u2019s coffee every day, that\u2019s a benefit.\u201d\nStill, I feel like I\u2019m one step further away from a relaxed and comfortable cafe. I put his offer on hold to think about it more and came back home.\nImmediately, a crazy pseudo-religious man appeared.\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply say that I was subjected to unpleasant missionary work, the joyous expression on his face was making me too uncomfortable.\nI immediately took out my phone and tried to send a message to Ki Yoohyun. However, the input was not done properly because my hands were shaking.\nHuu, let\u2019s calm down. It\u2019s late, so I\u2019ll go to bed first and I\u2019ll call him tomorrow morning to ask about the offer in detail.\nI turned off the chat window and stood up.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nBut the next morning.\nI couldn\u2019t contact Ki Yoohyun right away.\nBecause something unexpected happened.\n\u201cEh\u2026.?\u201d\n***\nIn the same time when Kwon Rieul was in shock, Lee Sein slowly raised her head.\nHer mind was clear as if she had woken up from a long dream. The throbbing headache and the strange voice disappeared. In that sense, Lee Sein could look around with a perfectly calm head.\nThe guild leader\u2019s room in the quiet C&L Corporation.\nShe could see what she had accomplished so far. Glittering skyscrapers, numerous commendations, strong position, fame, and countless Hunters who follow her words\u2026.\n\u2026.and for her who doesn\u2019t have a family, Choi Cedric and Choi Rona are like her real family members.\nHow long has it been since she stopped by Choi Rona\u2019s hospital room? Has she ever had a quiet conversation with Choi Cedric?\nShe has already had enough success, so why was she so restless? Didn\u2019t she miss something precious because she was chasing a mysterious thirst?\n\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s stop.\u201d\nLee Sein, who made such a decision, stood up.\nIn her hand was a request for the attendance as a witness sent by the Dungeon Management Office. The content was about explaining her relationship with the Neo-Crown Party.\nIt\u2019s better like this. It\u2019s still manageable. Let\u2019s quit the plan, acknowledge what they need to admit, and focus on the operation of the guild.\nClick!\nThen, the door opened. In front of the door stood Lee Sein\u2019s secretary, who had been missing for a while.\n\u201c\u2026Aeon.\u201d\nDays have passed since the Otherworld Gate was closed and the power of The Faceless One \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was deactivated. Lee Sein did not bother to look for her secretary even though she noticed that he had disappeared. He was always a reliable secretary, but from some point on, she felt uneasy.\n\u201cAeon, where have you been?\u201d\nTherefore, Lee Sein\u2019s words flowed out somewhat stiffly.\n\u201cCEO Lee Sein-nim.\u201d\nAeon entered the room with a silent step.\nThe secretary in front of her is smiling incredibly brightly. The beautiful eyes that would catch anyone\u2019s attention disappeared under the eyelids and then reappeared.\nStartle.\nLee Sein felt goosebumps on her back.\nWait, was Aeon originally look like this? What did he look like? How come \u2026 the person in front of her felt so unfamiliar.\nNo, was he human in the first place?\nA cold voice reached her ears.\n\u201cYou failed. This time, too.\u201d\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\n100 more chapters to the ending of the main story~\nAh, since this chapter was done by phone (I\u2019m bored and have nothing to do), please understand if you encounter too many typos\u2013 I hope I can get my laptop back soon.

            "c91": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nTherefore, in the present.\nKi Yoohyun made an appointment to meet with Rieul in order to reveal his identity. Ironically, even though he was nervous, his heart started to get excited. Perhaps because it is a meeting only for the purpose of meeting her, which is different from the previous loose relationship.\nHe reserved a restaurant that serves food that she might like. The atmosphere is calm, so it would be perfect to have a quiet conversation after eating.\nHowever, as soon as Rieul greeted him with a bright smile, his head went blank.\n\nKi Yoohyun can\u2019t imagine how her expression will change as soon as he opens his mouth.\nWill she get angry because he lied to her? If so, it\u2019s still fine. He will apologize as much as he can until her anger subsides.\nHowever\u2026.\nWhat should he do if she becomes wary of himself? If he\u2019s unable to see her comfortable smile again, if she sees him as a stranger \u2026 just imagining it seems to tighten the tension in his chest.\nThe moment he finally made up his mind and tried to open his mouth\u2026.\nThe staff knocked on the door, it was time for the dessert to be served.\nNot far beyond the wall, he could feel the presence of Han Yiseong. Even though he knows that he can\u2019t fool Ki Yoohyun\u2019s senses, he dares to continue to follow him, is it a protest because he asked for his understanding?\nHan Yiseong strongly objected his decision to reveal his identity to Rieul. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t understand why he was against it. He\u2019s probably worried about the loose relationship he has worked hard to build up.\nKi Yoohyun admitted that Han Yiseong\u2019s interference was rather welcome. This is not a good place to talk because of the interruptions.\nWith that excuse, he drove the car and headed for the dark observatory. He was confident that he would say it this time \u2026 until he saw the light of the fireworks shining on Rieul\u2019s white cheeks.\nHer chestnut brown hair slowly flutters in the wind. Her large eyes, who were looking at him, blinked slowly. Exhaling a light breath, she rubbed the canned drink with her cold fingers. The whole figure was clearly engraved in his eyes.\nA few minutes to urge the lips that were barely moving passed.\nKi Yoohyun neatly admitted defeat. He has never been so indecisive, but he doesn\u2019t have the courage.\nYeah, next time. Let\u2019s talk next time we meet.\nHe was greedy. He didn\u2019t want to break this soft atmosphere with useless words. He didn\u2019t wish to see those eyes, who were looking at the fireworks embroidering the sky, filled with vigilance.\nLet\u2019s do so. He enjoyed an ordinary outing like this.\nHe swallowed the words he was going to say, but when he was about to say let\u2019s go back because it will be cold soon, Rieul said something all of sudden.\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me some secret? For example \u2026 is it that Yoohyun-ssi is the No.1 ranker, Muwon?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun stared blankly at the woman in front of him. There was only one word that his spirit managed to utter.\n\u201c\u2026.yes?\u201d\n***\nIt\u2019s not something to be proud of, but I\u2019m really ignorant.\nAs such, I didn\u2019t guess Ki Yoohyun\u2019s identity from the beginning.\nAt first, I thought he was a Hunter on a bad end. In addition, until the fire broke out in the Grandma Kim Deokyi\u2019s workshop, I considered him as a Hunter who was stronger and had more time than I thought.\nBut soon I realized something strange.\nKi Yoohyun\u2019s ability to freely manipulate space using white light was strong and extremely useful. With that kind of ability, he could be famous, but only few people know about Ki Yoohyun.\nThe twin hunters of The Cheongna Guild follow Ki Yoohyun well. Han Yiseong also seemed somewhat polite to Ki Yoohyun. It was by no means the attitude toward the Guild\u2019s lowest-position Hunter.\nIn the first place, can a Hunter at the bottom of the Cheongna Guild, not just any small guild, use his time freely like that? Isn\u2019t Hunter some kind of employment contract?\nCrucially, the suspicion was solidified because when Kwon Jiwoon was in crisis in the White Silver Guild, the Director of the Dungeon Management Office took over the case himself.\nA Hunter who can move the Director who stayed at the Jeju branch due to some kind of dungeon development problem\u2026..\nLet\u2019s think about it. He is a strong member of the Cheongna Guild, but there is only one hunter whose personal information is unknown.\nThe leader of the secretly powerful trend, the No. 1 ranker, Muwon.\nMoreover, meaningful words that can never be thought of something an end-position ranker would say keep passing by. He was changing the subject so clearly.\u2026\nOnce the hypothesis was established, all the evidence was clear.\nThe first and best S-class that has maintained his position at the top of the tower all the time. Someone who\u2019s completely like the protagonist of a fantasy novel, Muwon.\nHowever, the images of the two were so different that it took a long time to connect them.\nIt was clear that Ki Yoohyun was not good at hiding his identity, or had no intention of hiding it from the beginning. Otherwise, how can he go around showing off his power?\nWhen I recited my thoughts, Ki Yoohyun sighed lightly and rubbed his forehead with his fingertips. The thin tension that had been floating around was nowhere to be found. There was a complicated expression on his face; he looked frustrated and relieved at the same time.\n\u201cRieul-ssi.\u201d\nAfter licking his lips a few times, Ki Yoohyun continued.\n\u201cIf you knew \u2026 why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s your personal privacy?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nA look of disdain reached my cheek.\nWhy? you can have the worldview where people won\u2019t recognize that you\u2019re the same person just by changing your hairstyle or wearing glasses.\nSeeing that no one noticed that Ki Yoohyun was Muwon when it was so obvious, I thought that there was an agreement not to talk about that.\n\u201c\u2026.I thought you would hate me for deceiving you.\u201d\n\u201cEh, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nThere are things I didn\u2019t tell him either. It\u2019s weird to reveal your secret to someone you\u2019ve just met.\nBesides, it wasn\u2019t that shocking when I found out.\nThe person who is strong and helps me well, and likes to appear and disappear all of sudden is still the same person. Whatever his identity is, it doesn\u2019t change much.\nWell, I thought I\u2019d tell him someday when the situation arises and until then\u2026.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a social consideration for the poor No. 1 ranker who wants to avoid the world\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\u201cYou treat people like a mola-mola\u2026.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun was confused.\n\u201cBut why did you suddenly decide to reveal it?\u201d\nThe night air was quite cold. The warmth of the can of barley tea has long since cooled. As we walked towards his parked car, Ki Yoohyun handed over his gloves. I accepted it without hesitation, but there was space left because it was big. I added, fiddling with the rest of the glove with my fingertips.\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you trying to hide it for a reason?\u201d \n\u201cTo tell the truth, I went back in time.\u201d\n\u201cEu, cough! Cough, cough!\u201d\nThis time, I was really surprised.\nKi Yoohyun handed me his own barley tea can and handkerchief when I choked in surprise. I drank it without hesitation. I thought I was going to die.\nKi Yoohyun is also a regressor?\nKi Yoohyun opened the car door for me, who was still out of reality. I got on, but my mind was spinning.\n\u201cSo \u2026 Yoohyun-ssi, do you mean that you\u2019re a regressor?\u201d\n\u201cYou believe me. I thought you\u2019d think it was ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\nI\u2019m the one who knows best that regression exists.\nRather than the possibility that Ki Yoohyun suddenly became absorbed in a fantasy novel and took the concept of a possessor, it is more likely that he\u2019s a regressor who remembers the past like me.\n\u201cI originally didn\u2019t mean to tell you this fact, but\u2026.\u201d\nWhen I unexpectedly accepted his true identity as if it was nothing, he made up his mind to tell me that he was a regressor.\nThe following conversation was a story that gave me goosebumps even though the heater.was turned on. \nThree years later, in the Great Dungeon  Abys, the Demon is resurrected. \nKi Yoohyun tried to stop the demon, but he returned to the past the moment he reached the last floor, \u2018The Ultimate Gate\u2018.\n\u201cThat \u2026 when was it? The date \u2026 when was the date?\u201d\nI was surprised to hear the date Ki Yoohyun said.\n\u2018It\u2019s same as me.\u2019\nBefore the regression, it was the same day I died. \nDid Ki Yoohyun go back to the past because I went back? Or did the saintess use her hand on Ki Yoohyun?\nI don\u2019t know\u2026.\nThis made me want to reveal that I am also a regressor.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nHowever, as soon as I thought so, my lips didn\u2019t move. I got it right away. The system holds me back. I resented it, and at the same time, I felt wronged.\nWhy me! Does causality discriminate against Grades? Is it because I\u2019m an F-class?\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you everything about the future because of the restraints of causality\u2026.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun\u2019s words continued.\nBehind the Demon\u2019s resurrection, there was a crazy religious group called the Church of Starry Wisdom. Even now, they are plotting the resurrection of the Demon God.\nIsn\u2019t the worldview suddenly expanding too much?\n\u201cRieul-ssi has already been involved in many incidents. I think the cult is behind it. That\u2019s why I was going to tell you to be careful.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026.\u201d\nThree years later, something big will happen. In addition, Ki Yoohyun also said he was trying to prevent the resurrection of the Demon.\nAlthough it still feels far away, a sense of reluctance remains. I nodded.\n\u201cAnd one more thing.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, you asked me if I have any problems with my sense of taste.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 I\u2019m sorry for asking you that nonsense.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what my cat said. As he hurriedly shook his hand out of embarrassment, Ki Yoohyun added.\n\u201cMy taste buds are definitely fine, but \u2026 when I reached the Demon\u2019s Gate, the Ultimate Gate, I felt that a part of me had flowed through the door.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI have incomplete memories when I sealed the Demon\u2019s Gate. I have become a different person than I was before awakening, and I feel that no matter what I do, I can\u2019t go back to the way I was. It\u2019s kind of a sense of loss.\u201d\nHuh. Listening to Ki Yoohyun\u2019s serious words, I suddenly thought of his satisfaction bar when he drank coffee.\nThe bar that stopped at 98% without reaching 100% no matter what menu he consumes.\nIt may be an absurd idea, but \u2026 I thought that the unfilled 2% might be the missing part he was talking about.\n\nPREVIOUS\nNEXT\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nMola-mola: \uac1c\ubcf5\uce58, or sunfish. It\u2019s a fragile fish that gets stressed out easily. Treating someone like a mola-mola means you treat them like they\u2019re such an extremely fragile person.\nSorry for the late update. I\u2019m on hate relationship with my laptop right now because now it\u2019s also can\u2019t be turned off normally \u2026 I\u2019m mad with Wind*ws.\nand the weather these days is not exactly good. if you live in a country with rainy season, don\u2019t forget to bring umbrella anywhere!

            "c90": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nI found a suitable seat through the gap between the people who played the timing game to catch the best spot. It falls next to the observatory and is not visible to people, but it is a place with a good view because the front is open.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, go over there. I think we can see it well over there.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, I will.\u201d\nClaiming the spot is a race against time. I grabbed Ki Yoohyun\u2019s arm and strode to the right spot. Then, it wasn\u2019t long before the fireworks started.\nFirst, a small yellow flame painted a picture in the sky. The picture drawn by the beautiful fireworks is \u2026 huh\u2026?\n\nSomeone\u2019s face?\nIt was Oh Seoho\u2019s face, who winked with a lively and bright smile. The phrase that appeared at the bottom with the autograph was \u2018Made by Oh Seoho\u2018.\n\u201cHe \u2026 he\u2019s a strong narcissist.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad person \u2026 in some way.\u201d\n\u201cOh, have you met him?\u201d\n\u201cSomehow, yes.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun answered briefly as if it\u2019s not a topic he wanted to talk about.\nAlthough the first one was embarrassing, the following fireworks were colorful and beautiful. The dazzling light constantly changes shape and paints pictures in the sky.\nOh Seoho is truly an illusionist. Although he is now more widely known as a celebrity, his abilities were enormous. When a huge castle appeared in the sky of Seoul and then turned into butterflies and disappeared, it seemed to lead people into a fantasy world, not mere fireworks.\nIt\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0moment\u00a0when I admired the\u00a0fireworks\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0cool\u00a0breeze.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nI suddenly felt uncomfortable.\nWhat is it?\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, one moment.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cSo, umh, ah, I\u2019ll get something to drink from the vending machine.\u201d\n\u201cI will go.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s right over there, okay. Stay where you are.\u201d\nThere was a beverage vending machine not far away. I bought two warm barley teas and pretended to return to my original place, then I glanced over the bushes.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\nHe tried to press his hat on in a hurry, but it was already too late.\nThere\u2019s no way I can\u2019t recognize the silver hair that glitters subtly even in the dark night. \n\u201c..\u2026Kwon Jiwoon, what are you doing there?\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon was crouching behind the bushes, and next to him was a good-looking man, Hunter Han Yiseong.\n\u201cHaha, ha. Rieul-ah, it\u2019s a coincidence to meet you here.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Hello, long time no see.\u201d\n\u201cDont tell me, oppa, you\u2019re not following your younger sister or something like that \u2026 right?\u201d\nRight? No matter what, Kwon Jiwoon isn\u2019t free enough to do such things, right? I stared at him with those words in my eyes.\n\u201cAh, no, no, of course not! That\u2019s impossible. This is a coincidence, a coincidence.\u201d\n\u201cBut why are you two here?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just to watch the fireworks. It\u2019s a long-awaited opportunity.\u201d\nAll this time, who hasn\u2019t been interested in exciting events in their lifetime? I looked at Kwon Jiwoon with suspicious eyes.\n\u201cThis is behind the observatory, so you won\u2019t be able to see it here\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Over there, over there! There\u2019s just a seat over there, let\u2019s go!\u201d\nJust as I was about to investigate further with doubt, Hunter Han Yiseong got up with Kwon Jiwoon.  Seeing them rush toward the front of the observatory to get a good seat in a hurry, they looked quite close.\nA while ago, Ki Yoohyun said that the two were friends, so it was true\u2026.\nHow close would they be to see the fireworks together?\nAfter watching their backs for a while, I went back to where Ki Yoohyun was. While watching the remaining fireworks, I talked about this and that with Ki Yoohyun. Unexpectedly, he was a pretty good talker. I talked about the new menu I made yesterday, and Ki Yoohyun said that the main office of the Dungeon Management Office was busy dealing with the last case.\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s cool.\u201d\nThe final highlight, fireworks with the motif of a winter forest, decorated the grand ending. The fantastic forest, which seemed to have a refreshing smell, turned into snowflakes and disappeared one by one. \nSoon after, even the last snowflake turned into darkness, and the fireworks ended.\nIt\u2019s indeed a nation with \u2018hurry up\u2018 culture. People who filled the observatory began to leave, saying they had to go home quickly before the traffic jams.\nHe said he had something to say, but Ki Yoohyun didn\u2019t talk much until the fireworks were over.\nIs he going to talk about it after the number of people decreases? While drinking still warm canned barley tea, I looked at Ki Yoohyun quietly.\nMore than two months have already passed since I first encountered this man in the front yard of the store. Ki Yoohyun helped me several times, and he was generally kind. Sometimes he says  strange things, but I think he\u2019s a good person.\nHowever, there were times when I felt a strange feeling that was hard to express from him.\nHow should I describe it \u2026 he has a well-shaped face that can\u2019t be covered with long hair or glasses, but he doesn\u2019t have a presence for that.\nHis presence\u00a0suddenly\u00a0appears\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0there,\u00a0but\u00a0it\u00a0also would\u00a0disappear again and\u00a0again all of sudden.\nAs we talked from time to time, he knew a lot of things, but he seemed not to be interested in anything.\nI felt like he\u2019s here and not here at the same time. It seems that some part of the person named Ki Yoohyun is somewhere else, not here.\nThat\u2019s still the case. That\u2019s why I believed Mieum\u2019s words that he barely felt any sense of taste without any doubt. Somehow I thought this person might be like that.\nAfter the fireworks, darkness fell again. The street lamp lights don\u2019t reach here. Those black eyes gleamed as if they contained light even in the dark.\nLooking at his face, I suddenly remembered when he appeared at the shopping mall in Yongsan. He appeared with particles of sparkling light, and it felt as if he would disappear soon.\nI unintentionally stretched out my hand, but I didn\u2019t know where and what to catch, so I took it back.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nIn complete silence, I couldn\u2019t stand the silence and opened my mouth first.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting cold. I guess it\u2019s really winter now.\u201d\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s quite cold.\u201d\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, what do you want to tell me today?\u201d\nHe has a clear expression of hesitation. Ki Yoohyun took a light breath and slowly opened his mouth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t ready to speak, so I kept you waiting, Rieul-ssi. There was a disturbance.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It was fun to watch the fireworks, and as Yoohyun-ssi said, it seems that Kwon Jiwoon and Hunter Han Yiseong are friends.\u201d\nSince they came all the way here together.\nKi Yoohyun smiled bitterly at my words. He must have known that.\n\u201cYou may be surprised, but I\u2026.\u201d\nHowever, the latter words did not continue straight away, and he went silent again. In the distance where the sound of his breathing could be clearly heard, I could feel his tension.\nAh. I can\u2019t stand this tense atmosphere.\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s is it? I won\u2019t be surprised, so tell me.\u201d\nAt the same time, even I became nervous. Unable to bear the atmosphere, I opened my mouth again.\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me some secret? For example \u2026 is it that Yoohyun-ssi is the No.1 ranker, Muwon?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.yes?\u201d\nFlinch.\nKi Yoohyun was visibly surprised. His black eyes trembled greatly.\nHuh, was that really it?\nWhat am I supposed to say\u2026.\n***\nKi Yoohyun decided to reveal his identity to Rieul.\nHe couldn\u2019t lie to her any more.\nHis reason for hiding his identity from before the regression to the present is simple.\nWhen it comes to the first ranker of the current Korean Hunter World, he\u2019s already a kind of strategic resource that has already surpassed individuals. It was natural for his actions to be limited as much as his strong abilities. There was a practical reason to avoid unnecessary friction and move freely.\nIn the end, he did not trust others; Hunter Han Yiseong, who was always by his side, or even the party where they had the final decisive battle together.\nIn addition, Ki Yoohyun soon realized that there was a missing part of his memory.\nIn particular, the past memories before his awakening were unclear. Information such as date of birth, age, and where he was born remained, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s him. He felt like he was looking into other people\u2019s memories, as if he was reading a book.\nEach cell that makes up his body felt unfamiliar. Can he simply call the collection of recorded information himself?\n\u2018It\u2019s finally over.\u2019\u2018Thank you so much, Hunter-nim\u2026!\u2019\nWhen the Awakening Center was destroyed, there were people cheering that the Hunter World could finally be normalized.\nThe person they have been waiting for is Muwon.\nAt that moment, Ki Yoohyun was unfamiliar with himself and could not stand it. He felt terribly reluctant to respond to their jubilation. It seemed as if the shadow had been erased and became a solitary existence.\nThe Power of White Light. It is a skill that manipulates space using the dense web of light created by The Spider Goddess, the being who makes threads in the dark.\nHowever, whenever Ki Yoohyun uses this power, he gets the feeling that he is flowing into \u2018the other side\u2019 through the net of light.\nOne day, the moment this web was completed, he felt a fear that he would disappear beyond the \u201cUltimate Gate\u201d and that this place would be taken over by someone other than himself.\nWho on earth can he share this feeling with?\nThen, he went back to three years in the past; now.\nAt first, he had no intention of revealing his identity to Kwon Rieul.\nMany things have already changed from the original pre-regression past. The person at the center of all the changes is Kwon Rieul, which must not be a coincidence.\nHowever, she\u2019s an ordinary person by all accounts. Far from being related to the cult or the Demons, she also got injured by the tactics aimed at Kim Deokyi\u2019s workshop.\nIt would be best to maintain a loose relationship as it is. He would help when she\u2019s in danger, sometimes go for coffee, never reveal who he is. A loose relationship that only shows a well-made human figure.\nThat\u2019s what he thought.\n\u201cAwakening doesn\u2019t mean you become a different being, right?\u201d\nThose words somehow stuck in his mind.\nIt\u2019s not meant for him. She must have said it out of concern for the twins who were still young. The words may be so plain and trivial that she won\u2019t even remember it. Still, the more he thinks about it, the more it feels like she said that for him.\nWhen he drank the coffee she made, he felt the empty space of his worn-out soul was filling up. Every time he tasted that warmth, he wanted to ask.\nEven now, do you still think awakening does not make you a different being?\nHowever, the day when he was unable to keep his decision to not reveal his identity and maintain a loose relationship came.\nThe city is thrown into chaos as black mucus appeared.\n\u201cOh, you were just here. Guild leader?!\u201d\nAs soon as Rieul pressed the security bell, Ki Yoohyun jumped over the space without hesitation towards her. It took some time to figure out where it was, as the action was faster than the accident.\nThe net of light knocked down the monster.\nShe embraced the child who was made as the incarnation of the Abyss. He saw her standing there, her face filled with determination to save such a child.\n\u201c\u2026.Yoohyun-ssi!\u201d\nThe moment he heard the clear voice.\nKi Yoohyun felt the urge to let her know who he was.\n\nPREVIOUS\nnext\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\n\u201cHurry up\u201d culture ( \ube68\ub9ac\ube68\ub9ac culture): it refers to Korean\u2019s culture where a fast-paced lifestyle is embraced since most Koreans tend to do everything very quickly. \nI think I have a nasty bad luck this month \u2026 this afternoon my laptop suddenly decided to do windows update WITHOUT ASKING FOR MY OPINION and now it can\u2019t be put to sleep or hibernate (when I did that, I was greeted by black screen and I had no choice but to forcibly turn it off). I already tried many suggestions in internet but nothin works wtf this is why you shouldn\u2019t update Windows.\nANYWAY, I hope you enjoy this chapter! see you on monday (I really need to start working on the new series).\nPLEASE DON\u2019T REPOST!!! \nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Even though Ash is something that is not human, even if he\u2019s the (self-proclaimed) Demon King of Twilight, he\u2019s still such a young kid, so it must be scary.\n\nI eventually promised to come back early and set out on the road.\n\u201cNyaaaah (Isn\u2019t that too much)\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyuuuu\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cWaeooogh (Little guy, your acting is terrible).\u201d\nThe audience\u2019s strict criticism was heard behind my back. They\u2019re cold.\n***\nKi Yoohyun looked nervous when there\u2019s only two of us after we left the cafe. \nAs usual, he smiled brightly. However, he led me to a large, expensive-looking car parked in front of the store with a stiff attitude somehow. The car was driven by Ki Yohyun himself.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cAh. I think you are good at driving.\u201d\nIt felt strange to see him at the wheel like this because he always randomly appeared and disappeared as he wanted.\n\u201cI wanted to move quietly today, so I paid some attention.\u201d\nUmh.\nI can see the reason why reverse parking with parking ticket in the driver\u2019s mouth has been talked about for a long time. \nThe side profile of Ki Yoohyun, who is driving the car smoothly while holding the steering wheel, looks cool even at first glance. His slightly long hair was neatly brushed to reveal his straight forehead, and his clothes also matched his tall height.\nWhat is he trying to say that makes him pay this much attention? No matter how hard I thought, I couldn\u2019t think of the reason why he would need to tell me separately.\nWhat did we talk about the last time we met? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s\u2026.\n\u2026..Ah.\nI swallowed a sigh. I remembered the memory of a big hand that covered mine, and a voice that touched my ears.\n\u201cJust, there\u2019s no need for Rieul-ssi to be in pain because of people like this.\u201d\nIt felt like the warmth of his hand was spreading throughout my body. His soft voice, the concern contained in it, touched my heart greatly.\nIt is too destructive to hear such words from such a person. It seems that not enough time has passed for the handsome immunity to develop yet.\n\u2026.that\u2019s why I deliberately tried not to think about it!\nMy heart thumped loudly. At this rate, it will be difficult to face Ki Yoohyun.\nI creaked, desperately trying to think of something else.\nThoughts, other thoughts \u2026 hmm, so\u2026.\nCome to think of it, I have a closet license. I got my license, but I didn\u2019t have time to practice because I used public transportation for work anyway.\nWait, when did I get my license? Obviously that\u2019s\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cNothing \u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m back.\nI got my driver\u2019s license before I returned to the past. In other words, I have to get my license again.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I was thinking that I should get a driver\u2019s license.\u201d\nIt was a bit saddening.\nWhile I was sad that I had to get my driver\u2019s license again, the car ran smoothly down the road. Since it was the Hunter\u2019s Night, the street was congested from early evening. \nHunter\u2019s Night, simply put, was a festival-like event for Hunters held once a year. It was held every year without fail even in situations where rifts suddenly broke out because it has a meaning to inform that Korea is safe.\nThe most popular event is the bargain sale of Hunter Market. People has been waiting in line from the night before to buy a sale item. In addition, a long line was seen outside the car window due to events held by each guild.\nIt\u2019s a very different street scene from when we were panicked because of the black mucus lumps.\nIn order to avoid the crowds, the place where Ki Yoohyun drove the car was a restaurant located on the outskirts. It seemed that he already made a reservation in advance because the staff immediately guided us to our seats.\nThe restaurant has a flashy atmosphere as if it\u2019s a place where people would never visit unless something special happened, so my shoulders became stiff with tension.\nA completely separate room for a quiet conversation.\nThe food came out shortly after we sat down at the designated seats. Everything looked delicious, and I especially liked the fresh seafood dish.\nWell, we\u2019d better talk after we eat. As soon as the cafe was closed, I came straight here, and I\u2019m getting hungry.\nAll the food was delicious. I tasted the dishes that come out one by one in the order of the course, then Ki Yoohyun suddenly spoke.\n\u201cHunter Han Yiseong asked me to thank Rieul-ssi.\u201d\n\u201cYes? Why?\u201d\nI remembered the good-looking Hunter Han Yiseong. However, no matter how much I thought about it, I didn\u2019t remember doing anything that would make him feel grateful to me.\n\u201cHunter Han Yiseong is on good terms with Hunter Kwon Jiwoon.\u201d\nWell, they looked pretty close when I saw them before.\n\u201cI see \u2026 then the two are friends?\u201d\n\u201cRather than a friend\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who was choosing his words for a while, continued.\n\u201cAs a Hunter, if you work in the guild for a long time, you will naturally find out that there aren\u2019t many people you can trust. For Hunter Han Yiseong, Hunter Kwon Jiwoon is a rare opponent.\u201d\nEven so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I should be thanked for.\nI was embarrassed by the unexpected words, but Ki Yoohyun, who moistened his throat with water, opened his mouth again.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, what happened within the barrier that day?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThat annoying meaningful experience \u2026 no, can I say that I met the saintess?\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust Ki Yoohyun, but I was reluctant to say it as I couldn\u2019t understand the exact meaning of what the saintess had said.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. You don\u2019t have to answer.\u201d\n\u201c.\u2026why?\u201d\n\u201cAsking Rieul-ssi about this first feels a bit \u2026 cowardly. Let\u2019s have this conversation again after I say what I have to say.\u201d\n\u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nFor a moment, silence fell.\nAs if to finally bring up the main point, the black eyes filled with light turned straight to me. The extremely serious expression on his face made me nervous as well.\nIt was the moment when Ki Yoohyun licked his lips and was about to say something.\nKnock, knock. The staff opened the door, came in, served the dessert, and went out again.\nPerfect timing as if you were aiming for it! I don\u2019t think it would be possible to intentionally enter at such an exquisite timing.\nThe conversation was cut off naturally. Ki Yoohyun swallowed what he was about to say and pushed the plate in front of him instead.\n\u201cTry this. It\u2019s savory and delicious.\u201d\nI suddenly felt a sense of incompatibility.\nWhat is it? I think I forgot something.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, how about this? What does this taste like?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun tasted the dessert on the plate without any doubt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sour. I think there\u2019s citron in the sauce.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, it may sound strange, but \u2026 have you ever had problems with your taste buds like being unable to taste something?\u201d\nHowever, even without hearing the answer, Ki Yoohyun in front of me seemed to have no problem tasting the taste.\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ve never had a problem like that \u2026 why?\u201d\nAt that moment, the words of a certain cat came to mind.\n\u201cThis man, you hardly notice the taste.\u201d\u201cHis sense of taste seems to have weakened considerably.\u201d\nYes, it\u2019s Mieum who told this story.\nIn\u00a0other\u00a0words,\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0a\u00a0confirmed\u00a0story,\u00a0but it\u2019s just\u00a0Mieum\u2019s\u00a0wild\u00a0talk.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi?\u201d\nI poured out my resentment towards a certain beast that was not here.\nKwon Mieum, we\u2019ll see. You\u2019re dead when I get home!\n***\n\u201cI\u2019m against it. Please reconsider.\u201d\nIt was Han Yiseong who shook his head at Ki Yoohyun\u2019s words.\n\u201cNo. I know Hunter Han Yiseong\u2019s concern, but my thoughts remain the same. I\u2019m going to tell Rieul-ssi today.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what the guild leader\u2019s will \u2026 I understand.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun recalled this conversation and touched his forehead.\nUnderstand be damned. He should have said it more clearly.\nDon\u2019t disturb me.\n***\n\u201cIt would be easier to talk in a place where there are no people.\u201d\nAfter finishing the meal, Ki Yoohyun, who said so, drove the car again.\nHuh? Wasn\u2019t the restaurant quiet and empty just now?\nKi Yoohyun, noticing the question in my eyes, smiled bitterly.\n\u201cIt looks like there\u2019s a mouse.\u201d\nAs soon as he finished his words, the car made a big U-turn.\nHuh? I think our genre has just changed. Is it just me?\nThe car sped down the road into the city. Then, with his exquisite driving skills, he circled the road and went uphill at an unexpected timing.\nThe buildings gradually decreased and soon became a mountain road. The car stopped in front of an observatory after running for a while. It was a place where you could look down at the city from the top of the mountain.\nAn observatory where darkness began to fall. There were quite a few people around the observatory.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I heard there\u2019s a fireworks display today.\u201d\nHunter\u2019s Night Fireworks Festival was today. The fireworks don\u2019t detonate real gunpowder, but they are created with mana by the wizard-class Hunters. This is also a traditional event that has been going on for several years because it also means showing off that there are many high-grade Hunters in Korea.\nThe scene where the colorful fireworks created by ether embroidered the night sky is quite spectacular, so it is understandable that there are so many people. It\u2019s especially true today.\nIf I remember correctly, the person in charge of the fireworks display this time is Hunter Oh Seoho, ranked 17th, who is famous for his handsomeness.\nIt was rare for a ranker to directly take charge of such entertainment, so it became a hot topic. When I looked around, I saw many people holding objects with Oh Seoho\u2019s picture.\nIt wasn\u2019t a good atmosphere to talk quietly, but everyone was excited anyway, so they were not interested in others.\nRather, it might be easier to talk in this atmosphere. Since I\u2019m not immune to that face, it\u2019s very nerve-racking to face Ki Yoohyun in a quiet place.\nMoreover, I had never seen this fireworks properly before the regression. \nAh. I\u2019ve only seen it once. It was late night at the company, it looked small through the gap in the building outside the window.\n\u2018It\u2019s a sad memory\u2026.\u2019\nAs such, I was a little excited.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nCloset license: \uc7a5\ub871 \uba74\ud5c8, it refers to a license that has not been used for a long time. The license is obtained, but not being used for its purpose, so it is like storing a license in a closet.\nReverse parking while biting the parking ticket is kinda popular romantic idea in Korea, here\u2019s the example:\n\n\nPLEASE DON\u2019T REPOST!!!\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c88": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nAlthough the barrier problem was resolved, the situation of the White Silver Guild was still complicated.\nAs a considerable number of hunters have left the guild, it is impossible for the guild to raid the dungeon. The guild\u2019s capability to solo-attack a dungeon is an important criterion for dividing the so-called \u201cGrade\u201d of the guild.\nMoreover, Hunter Park Heeyoung, who was always next to Kwon Jiwoon, hit the back of his head like that\u2026.\nNo wonder Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s mind is complicated.\n\nAh, I should have ripped off all of Park Heeyoung\u2019s hair. I ripped it off that day, but I still can\u2019t get rid of all my anger.\nShe is detained and being investigated by the Dungeon Management Office. There must be several charges at stake, so we won\u2019t meet again.\n\u201cI should recruit new hunters now.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon added. In order to maintain the White Silver Guild, which was founded and raised by my uncle, Kwon Jiwoon said that he had rarely recruited new hunters.\nHowever, Kwon Jiwoon, who said that they could not stay in this state forever, seemed relieved.\nI suddenly remembered Choi Cedric. \nThe hunters who belonged to the White Silver Guild moved to the guild under the C&L Corporation. It would be natural for a person to suspect C&L is behind the incident of the White Silver Guild.\nHowever, there is no clear evidence due to their cunning actions.\nIs Choi Cedric also involved in this? When we met in person, he didn\u2019t feel so insidious, but\u2026.\nHmm, it\u2019s hard to tell right now, so let\u2019s think about it later.\nIn such a bad situation, there is only one reason why he asked me to join the White Silver Guild.\nTo protect me.\nIn the past, he purposely kept his distance to protect me, but this time, he\u2019s just trying to keep me close to his watch. As a cafe owner, I don\u2019t have anything to do in the White Silver Guild right now.\nThat\u2019s why I refused. I\u2019m happy to confirm my relationship with Kwon Jiwoon and the affection of my family, but I didn\u2019t want to be a burden for him.\nWhen I said so, Kwon Jiwoon was bitter. Still, he quickly accepted my decision.\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve never been a burden.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t forget to add this.\nAnd\u2026.\n\n\u201cWaeooong (Human, what is this)!\u201d\nAt Mieum\u2019s cry, I cut off the thoughts that were expanding.\nAs the bag fell sideways, the award certificate that I had put inside came out. It was the moment when Mieum and Lime, who happily ate the cake, were about to touch the award certificate case.\n\u201cWait! Kwon Mieum, Kwon Lime, stop! Stop!\u201d\n\u201cKyagyakyaong?!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuuu!\u201d\nMieum, who was startled, puffed out her tail. In the meantime, I grabbed a wet tissue and approached the two animals.\n\u201cI told you not to touch a piece of paper when you have something on you!\u201d\nWhew, I\u2019m glad. I was able to stop Mieum and Lime, who were almost becoming creamy lumps, from stamping their milk fat footprints on paper. I freed the animals only after thoroughly wiping their bodies, the soles of their feet, and the corners of the mouth.\n\u201cKkyuuuu! Kkyuuu!\u201d\n\u201cNyaaaah (Is this the thing called the award certificate)!\u201d\nThere\u2019s a brief moment for them to look into the letters of the award certificate. Soon, the two began to play, bouncing the award certificate case. They really like unexpected things.\n\u201cPlease be quiet \u2026 eh, well done.\u201d\nI tossed the award certificate case to dry the animals that were bouncing the award certificate case to hit each other\u2019s foreheads and left them alone.\nI wanted to stop at that\u2026.\nInstead, I looked at the award certificate placed alone.\nI was very embarrassed, and the thought of receiving an undeserved award remains the same.\n\u2018Still\u2026.\u2019\nIt feels nice.\n***\nMidnight.\nAsh felt thirsty and opened his eyes. The light sleep had already receded. He put down the red slime cushion he was hugging and stood up.\nHe was going to take water out of the refrigerator and drink it for a while, but an unexpected scene grabbed Ash\u2019s feet.\n\u201cUm\u2026..\u201d\nA hall on the first floor where yellow lights glow softly A woman with a foolish face was lying flat on her stomach at the table.\nWhat is she doing here until this hour?\nAsh\u2019s question was solved before he even approached her. It\u2019s because he heard a sound of steady breathing.\nOn the table, there is a book with \u2018Dungeon Ecology Encyclopedia\u2018 written on its cover. It seems that she fell asleep while trying to read that book.\n\u2018If I leave her alone, she will wake up on her own. \u2018\nAsh ignored her and tried to head toward the refrigerator. However, this time, he heard a voice.\n\u201cAsh\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe waited for a while, but the words didn\u2019t continue. It seemed that it was just a sleep-talking.\nAsh became curious about the latter words of the sleep talks that was swallowed by the drowsy breathing, and he was annoyed at himself who was curious about such things.\nThe woman tossed and turned her body, but there was no sign of waking up.\nThe weather is already in early winter. The first floor, where the heating was turned off, was quite chilly, so if she continued to sleep like this, she would definitely catch a cold.\n\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201d\nShe was a woman who could only be described as really stupid. It would make him feel bad to see her sniffling with a cold. He thought that he had no choice but to hug her and take her to the room on the second floor.\n\u2026\u2026and then, he hesitated.\nHe remembered the time when she hugged him in the space beneath the huge tree.\nHer eyes were swollen and she looked like a mess, yet she patted him on the back, saying she was worried about him. He doesn\u2019t know how she is so insensitive.\nAsh felt his earlobes burning hot.\nHe has been feeling strange since that day. Every time this woman approached him without hesitation or swept his hair, his breath became short and his cheeks became hot.\nThat\u2019s why Ash was trying not to encounter Kwon Rieul as much as possible, even though there was no success today.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.Sh.\u201d\nNo, this is not it. Unlike this woman who hugs people everywhere, he is just trying to move her to her room.\nThat\u2019s really all it is\u2026.\nNevertheless, touching her while she was asleep felt a bit cowardly.\nIn the end, Ash took a step back without embracing Kwon Rieul. Instead, he used his magic to levitate her body.\n[The connection is not smooth. Reconnection requires reconstitution of existence.]\nThe warning window flashed in front of him. Ash frowned slightly and then deleted the warning window.\nAs the Otherworld Gate was closed, in the aftermath, Ash became a \u2018separated link\u2019. In other words, the connection with the main body was completely disconnected and it became an independent entity.\nThe ego of an individual incarnation is meaningless to oneself. Originally, he would not be able to withstand the instability and chose extinction, but\u2026.\nAsh made his way to the second floor with Kwon Rieul\u2019s floating body. She didn\u2019t wake up even when he, without shaking, put her down on the bed.\nAsh thought, looking at her quietly.\nIt\u2019s a weak human body, so it can\u2019t be helped.\n\u2018I should protect you.\u2019\n***\nPage Eight: Holstein, Jersey, and \u2026 Golden Triangular Rhino\n\nIt happened when I talked to Ki Yoohyun on the phone for the commendation.\nBefore\u00a0I\u00a0hung\u00a0up,\u00a0he\u00a0blurted\u00a0out\u00a0some words.\n\u2014 Rieul-ssi, I have something to tell you \u2026 when do you have time?\u201cThen, come to the cafe when it\u2019s convenient for you, Yoohyun-ssi.\u201d\u2014 No, it\u2019s not that \u2026 I\u2019d like to see you outside separately.\nAh. He helped me many times, but I always asked him to come to the cafe.\nEven so, I thought I should express my gratitude properly, this is great.\nThat\u2019s how I made an appointment today. As soon as the cafe was cleaned up, Ki Yoohyun arrived just in time. As the weather was quite chilly, I put on a thick coat and prepared to go out.\n\u201cThen, Ash, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nHowever, Ash ran forward and blocked Ki Yoohyun.\n\u2026\u2026what?\nEven at first glance, the sullen expression looked dissatisfied with something.\n\u201cAsh, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nShashashak, shashak.\nWhen Ki Yoohyun stepped to the left, Ash went to the left, and when he went to the right, he also went to the right.\nLeft, oh, left, left, oh, left, right again. He blocked the view with the perfect timing.\nAll Perfect Combo!\nI didn\u2019t know that our Ash had a talent for rhythm games. With his agile and swift movement, he can show off his brilliant skills without being intimidated by any arcade.\nNo, no, not this.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, why are you matching the rhythm with the kid again?\u201d\nWhen I turned around, Ki Yoohyun turned his head with a shy expression.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, that\u2019s enough\u2026.\u201d\nI approached Ash, who actually had not been able to hide Ki Yoohyun at all because of his short height, and asked.\n\u201cAsh, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cWhen are you coming home today?\u201d\n\u201cWell \u2026 I think it\u2019s going to be a little late.\u201d\nIt is early evening now. Considering the time it takes to eat and move, it might be late at night.\nAnguish crossed Ash\u2019s face. He has something to say, but he looked like he was hurting his pride.\nI sat knee-to-knee on the floor, made eye contact, and waited for Ash\u2019s inner conflict to come to an end.\nIt seems that it was the speaking side that won after a fierce battle. He closed his eyes tightly before opened his lips.\n\u201cNoona\u2026.!\u201d\n\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\nIt was the first time Ash called me noona. No matter how much I asked before, he didn\u2019t listen.\nIn the meantime, the voice saying noona with a face that looks better because he ate and rested well was so cute. Ash\u2019s cheeks flushed red.\n\u201cWaeoong (good job, good job)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nAsh continued, leaving behind the audience who did not clear whether they were teasing or cheering him.\n\u201cNoona, can you come home early today?\u201d\n\u201cUh \u2026 huh?\u201d\nWhy is he suddenly doing something he usually didn\u2019t do?\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nHolstein and Jersey are cow types, in case you didn\u2019t know.\nThis 8th section of the novel will be full of fluff, enjoy the cuteness~\nPLEASE DON\u2019T REPOST!!!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c87": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cIs that so? You look very close with them.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Ah, yes. They\u2019re regulars at my cafe.\u201d\nThe twins stared at each other in surprise before they looked at me again.\n\u201cRe \u2026 am I a reguler?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, are you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a regular, Eonni! I will become a regular.\u201d\n\u201cMe \u2026 me too!\u201d\nThey nodded their heads eagerly. If you look at them in this way, they are really ordinary kids.\n\u201cKids, and this is Kwon Jiwoon, the deputy guild leader of the White Silver Guild. He\u2019s my cousin.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cAre you cousins?\u201d\nThe twins stared at each other again, then they looked at Kwon Jiwoon. Then, a bright smile appeared on their round cheeks.\n\u201cHello!\u201d\n\u201cHello!\u201d\nTheir eyes are sparkling. The signs of being strangely wary suddenly disappeared and the lively expression returned to their faces.\nI also offered lunch to the twins, but they promised to join me next time because they had something to do. \nHowever, before leaving, Joo Shinwoo was wriggling his fingers for a long time. It\u2019s obvious that he has something to say.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cHey \u2026 noona, is he okay?\u201d\n\u201cHe? Ah, you mean Ash?\u201d\nThe last time they met was when we ran away from the black mucus mass in front of the Dungeon Gate. I guess that\u2019s why he was worried about him.\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s fine. Come and see him next time.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! Yes.\u201d\nSwiftly, the twins ran away with a relieved expression. I looked at their backs and thought.\n\u2018He\u2019s fine, but \u2026 he\u2019s kind of weird.\u2019\n***\n\u201cGuys, I\u2019m home.\u201d\nAfter having lunch with Kwon Jiwoon, and packing desserts for Ash and the animals, more time passed than I expected.\n\u201cWaeeoong! You\u2019re here now, human! Why are you so late?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuuuu!\u201d\nAs soon as I opened the door and walked in, I was greeted by Mieum\u2019s meow punch and Lime\u2019s body bump.\nIt hurts quite a bit when they hit me with all their might.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so angry. Look, I bought some snacks.\u201d\nI took out the Earl Grey cake, made by a famous dessert shop, from the box I had in my hand. Since I received an award today, I\u2019m glad I chose the biggest size. Mieum put her paws down when she saw the big cake.\n\u201cMieum, you are a cat, but you really like snacks.\u201d\n\u201cWaeooogh?! Cat discrimination! Is there a law that says cats shouldn\u2019t eat snacks!\u201d\nWell, there isn\u2019t, but\u2026\u2026.\nI suddenly remembered what the saintess had said in my vision.\n\u201cYour cat will guide you.\u201d\nReally? This one?\n\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.woogyaag?! Why are you suddenly looking at me with such suspicious eyes! It wasn\u2019t me, it was this guy who ate it, meoow!\u201d\n\u201cKkyu! Kkyuuu!\u201d\n\u201cMieum, I can see the cream around your mouth.\u201d\n\u201cMrrrrrrrrrrawr.\u201d\nAfter avoiding the heavy meow punch that quickly flew in, I sliced \u200b\u200bthe cake according to the number of people. However, one person is missing.\n\u201cBy the way, where is Ash?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s stuck in there alone, meow!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nAs Mieum said, I found Ash when I went to the next room. He was sitting with his knees up and watching TV.\nThe movie on the screen is The Priests. As the main character ran with the black pig, Ash shed tears.\nHuh \u2026 was that a sad story\u2026?\nAnyway.\nI tapped lightly on the already opened door and started talking.\n\u201cKim Ash! I bought a cake. Come out and let\u2019s eat together.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very delicious cake. Come quickly.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Eung.\u201d\nReluctantly, Ash got up, but he didn\u2019t make eye contact with me. All I could see was Ash\u2019s red neck and earlobes.\n\u201cAsh, do you have a fever?\u201d\nWhen the fever rises, the tear glands become loose. Maybe that\u2019s why he sniffled as the movie was running toward a happy ending.\nI sat with my knees on the floor and made eye contact with Ash. Then, I reached out and tried to measure the heat on his forehead.\n\u201cEuh\u2026.!\u201d\nAs soon as my fingers tried to sweep his bangs lightly, Ash violently removed my hand. Then, with an even hotter face, he rushed out and sat down in front of the table.\nWhen he first came here, he had an unfriendly attitude, but something seems different this time.\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly what it is, but it\u2019s different.\nThe reason \u2026 is it because of that day?\n\nAfter confirming that Kwon Jiwoon was safe, I returned to the store once. The purpose was to get Ash out of the space.\nHow anxious he must be to be alone in that place. It must be boring because there is nothing else but a big coffee tree and sugarcanes. I\u2019ll meet him quickly and tell him everything is okay now.\nMy eyes were swollen from all the crying that I did while hugging Kwon Jiwoon tightly. Mieum and Lime, who were sitting on the floor, were surprised to see my face. I went straight into the space.\nAsh was sitting under the tree trunk, hugging his knees. The dull expression on his face made me realize that it was really over now, so I hugged Ash.\n\u201cAsh, you\u2019ve waited for a long time. It\u2019s okay now.\u201d\nRush. Ash\u2019s small, skinny body came into my arms. He was startled, his shoulders and back stiffened.\nI slowly patted Ash\u2019s back. Little by little, I could see his shoulders relaxed and his earlobes were burning.\nIt was only after he was completely drained that Ash slowly opened his mouth.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asking?\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201cNow you know. I\u2026.\u201d\nThe latter words did not continue for a long time. Then, he added in a barely audible voice, \u201cI\u2019m not human\u201c.\nWhen he thought I didn\u2019t hear it, Ash opened his lips again, and eventually let out only a thin breath.\nYes, as Ash said, I know that Ash\u2019s identity is not an ordinary human being.\nNow that I think about it, I should have noticed it when he was lying down in front of this store. I just thought he was a kid in his sensitive age with a situation.\u2026.\nHowever, it didn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t want to investigate Ash\u2019s identity just because I felt sorry for him. I wasn\u2019t someone with such a nice personality.\nThe system no longer tells me to deal with Ash.\nI don\u2019t know what that means, but keeping Ash doesn\u2019t pose a threat to me.\nThe black eyes tried to look calm, but the anxiety inside them was clearly visible. \nThe guilty conscience that I would feel if I interrogate and drive out Ash, who makes such a sad expression. The uncertain safety that might be gained from doing that. I weighed Ash and the uncertain safety, and I chose the former.\nBesides, he\u2019s a genius part-timer\u2026.\nJust imagining running the cafe by myself without Ash makes my eyes turn dark.\nI continued speaking, hugging Ash tighter.\n\u201cAre you the being called the incarnation of Asmodeus?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHis eyes shook greatly. He looked as if he was saying, \u2018Why are you doing this when you know it?\u2019.\n\u201cCome to think of it, you said it when we first met. I thought you were just babbling.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like being here?\u201d\nFlinch. Ash, who was surprised, slowly shook his head.\n\u201cOkay then. Ash is the part-timer at my house, huh.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\n\nIt was good to bring him out like that, but he has been acting in that way since then.\nI think his behavior lately is a bit of a mess; he seems to be shy, and somehow he seems to be restless\u2026.\nI wonder if it\u2019s because he\u2019s in a difficult age.\nThat\u2019s\u00a0what\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0all\u00a0about.\nI took out the roasted coffee beans. The event that threw the city into chaos is over. The danger of rifts and dungeons is still lurking, but for now it is peaceful.\nHowever, there was still one problem in Cafe Rieul.\n[Fresh Milk: Out of Stock\u203b We are currently preparing for stock. We\u2019ll send you a notification when it\u2019s in stock.]\nIt is true that there is no sign of milk coming in. The Dimensional Shop didn\u2019t sell milk even though they ate a few of my rubies.\nA cafe without milk \u2026 unintentionally, the menu has decreased significantly.\nInstead, I found this menu while looking through the list of recipes I\u2019ve gotten so far in the hopes of making a new menu.\nWell, this is it. There was no milk in the ingredients, and it seemed perfect to drink in this current situation.\nI first picked the fruit of the Purifying Tree, the lemon, from the space. Then, I washed the lemon thoroughly and sliced it finely.\nNext, brew the espresso. It was a simple menu that was completed by adding espresso to a coffee cup with sliced lemon.\nAs I put one more cup down in front of me, a status window appeared.\n[Item: Cafe Romano (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 01:00:00)Effect: Increases enchantment success rate by 200% for 1 time, and prevents item damage in case of enchantment failure.]\nEnchantment is another word for granting magic. It refers to applying magic to an item to increase its efficacy semi-permanently.\nThe problem is that sometimes the item will broke when the enchantment fails. If an expensive item that you\u2019ve worked hard to get is damaged due to the enchantment, you will get an anger disorder.\nI thought it would be good to give this menu to Grandma Kim Deokyi next time.\nThe fresh lemon scent blends well with the flavor of the espresso. After taking a sip of coffee, I spoke to Ash.\n\u201cAsh, do you want some sugar?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It is delicious as it is.\u201d\nEven though he said so, Ash, who took a sip of coffee, had a complicated look. Seeing that the satisfaction bar fills up only after he ate a big piece of cake with a fork, bitter coffee doesn\u2019t seem to suit his taste.\n\u201cAsh is good at drinking bitter coffee.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u2026\u2026I decided to pretend I didn\u2019t know.\n\u201cUnyaaaah (Me too! I\u2019m different too)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu! Kkyuu!\u201d\nAs soon as the cake plate was placed in front of them, Mieum and Lime quickly ate it up and started playing with cream on each other\u2019s bodies.\nHey, how do you guys clean that up\u2026\u2026.\nWell, it doesn\u2019t matter because there is \u2018The Floor is Shiny\u2018.\nLeaving the two creamy lumps alone, I also took a bite of the cake.\nIt\u2019s delicious.\n***\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to join the White Silver Guild?\u201d\nIt was when I had lunch with Kwon Jiwoon. He said in a casual tone, but I knew he asked seriously. I quietly shook my head.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d\nIt was an offer that I had already rejected once. As if it was just a confirmation, Kwon Jiwoon did not ask again and only wet his throat with water.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThe Priests is a real Korean movie. I haven\u2019t watched it though, the genre (supernatural, mystery, thriller) isn\u2019t exactly my cup of taste, so I can\u2019t explain to you why Ash cried while watching that lol\nPLEASE DON\u2019T REPOST!\nThank you UnseenPurpleOrk for the coffee!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c86": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nAward, that was quite out of the blue.\n\u201cHuh, what \u2026 award?\u201d\u201cJust in time, there will be a commendation ceremony for the Hunter\u2019s Night event, so I need to contact the person in charge right away.\u201d\u201cWhat? Oppa, thank you for your consideration, but isn\u2019t a Hunter responded to rift out of its scope?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a \u2018Hunter\u2019s Night Celebration\u2018, so it may sound strange, but it actually is.\n\nThat\u2019s because, until a decade ago, they had made a lot of rewards in the name of awarding a commendation to a brave Hunter. \nAs a Hunter, it is not uncommon to enter the dungeon, so the reason depends on the attachment. There was a wide range of awards that were given out in a rotating manner.\nSince then, rewarding Hunters for simple reasons such as \u2018they responded well to the rift\u2019, \u2018they attacked the dungeon faithfully\u2019 were prohibited. Specific reasons and strict screening have became mandatory.\nThey say that there is a reason for all the rules\u2026..\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You said that you\u2019re an Awakened, but Rieul, you don\u2019t belong to a guild or a public institution. It\u2019s great enough to step up in a situation where you\u2019re not obligated to.\u201d\u201cThat \u2026 I was just worried about the part-timer at my store.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s even more amazing.\u201d\u201cEww.\u201d\nNow that I look at it, Kwon Jiwoon looks like a dull fellow.\nWhy didn\u2019t I realise it before? No, I was just trying not to realise it.\nMy\u00a0mouth\u00a0puffed\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0embarrassment. Then, the door of the drawing room opened after a knock.\n\u201cYes, Hunter Kwon Jiwoon is right.\u201d\u201cHuh \u2026 Jina-ssi? You were here?\u201d\u201cI heard about the circumstances from Hunter Ki Yoohyun earlier, and I think you deserve a commendation. I will pass it on to the person in charge.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay \u2026 Jina-ssi, aren\u2019t you busy with your work?\u201d\u201cAh, not that much. Leave it to me.\u201d\n\u2026\u2026.\n\u2026\u2026.\nThe screening process went on like flowing water.\nIn the end, today has come.\nIt\u2019s nice to receive the award and the prizes (it\u2019s <Dungeon Management Office> cafeteria meal ticket\u00a0and <Hunter Market> fee discount coupon.\u2026), but it\u2019s more embarrassing than I thought.\n\u201cNow that the time has come, how about lunch?\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon asked me.\nWell, before I left, I gave the animals plenty of food, and I also prepared a lunch for them, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s great. Where are we going?\u201d\nI was about to leave the venue with Kwon Jiwoon, but someone passed by from the opposite side and approached me.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, congratulations.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, thank you.\u201d\nAs a matter of course, it is said that Jina\u2019s brother, Jijon, who returned to his original form, was immediately arrested.\nIt\u2019s not because of the attempted murder charges. When it comes to the case where Grandma Kim Deokyi\u2019s workshop burned down, Jijon is out of the list of suspects and is only an important witness.\nHowever, even if the circumstances are taken into account, there are suspicions that he has been involved in various illegal activities. It will be known only when the results of the investigation come out, but it seems difficult to avoid punishment.\n\u201cWell, who can blame that man for his own gain? I\u2019m glad you saved his life. I hope he comes to his senses after being punished.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Jina said\u2026.\nShe looks tired, but her expression is more relaxed. I was relieved to see it.\nThe family of a public official belonging to the main office is an important witness in a large case. Due to this reason, Jina decided to quit the Dungeon Management Office immediately.\nShe had her thoughts, and there must have been some unspoken pressure around her.\nHowever, it was Kang Hyunwoo, the head of Emergency Dungeon Countermeasures Team, her boss, who unexpectedly stepped up.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t miss an excellent assistant like Jina-ssi.\u201d\u201cPlease stay at the main office. Jina-ssi didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\nShe finally decided not to quit thanks to his full support.\nI\u2019m very curious about this part of the story. I want to hear it in detail.\n\u201cJina-ssi, I\u2019m going to have lunch now. Do you want to join?\u201d\n\u201cI would very much like to do that, but what a pity \u2026 it\u2019s the day Rieul-ssi receives the commendation, so I came out for a while. I have to go back soon.\u201d\nOh dear\u2026..\nJina was holding several file folders in one hand and a book in the other hand. The letters on the cover caught my eye.\n\u300e <Dungeon Management Office> FINAL preparation for the non-Awakened person screening promotion test with a complete summary in one book. \u300f\nThat\u2019s it. A slow one-hit shot. If she swings it, I think she can send her opponent away in one shot.\nIt seems that Kang Hyunwoo\u2019s words impressed Jina. With an energetic gait, she left with the deadly weapon, no, the book.\n\u2026 Next time we meet, I\u2019ll make you a strong cup of coffee.\n***\nAfter separating ways with Jina, I was walking side by side with Kwon Jiwoon to go to the restaurant he had reserved.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nI ran into a little boy in a black suit that fitted him perfectly.\nHis hair was neatly combed to expose his forehead, and his face was expressionless. His cold eyes, seemingly indifferent to the adults around him, even showing signs of boredom.\nHe has a cold atmosphere that is hard to approach. I could see a couple of people around him trying to talk to him, but they\u2019re backing away at the cold reaction.\nStrangely, he looks familiar. Is it just my feeling?\n\u201cKwon Rieul, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cAh, nothing. I\u2019m coming.\u201d\nFive steps ahead, Kwon Jiwoon called me. I quickly tried to follow him.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\nThen, I happened to make eye contact with the child who turned his head in my direction.\nHis cold face turned bright red in an instant.\n\u201cOh! Hey, hurry up and come here!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I told you not to call me for something that wasn\u2019t a big deal because it\u2019s annoying.\u201d\n\u201cYou idiot! This is not the time for that!\u201d\nWhoops, he snatched a child with the same face in the same outfit that was a little far away. Then, they both started running this way at the same time.\nDon\u2019t tell me, those kids\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cEonni, hello! What are you doing here? I was surprised!\u201d\n\u201cYou idiot! Didn\u2019t you know that Noona was getting a commendation today? I knew about it!\u201d\n\u201cWho allowed you to call her noona, you idiot!\u201d\n\u201cYou can call me noona\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say, she said I can!\u201d\n\u201cI also wanted to see you receiving the commendation, Eonni! I couldn\u2019t go because I had a really annoying job today. Congratulations. You\u2019re so cool.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d\nThe cheerful voices pouring in before I could even finish a word.\nThey were the twins, Joo Shinwoo and Joo Shinhee. Their atmosphere changed so much when they were wearing a suit, I couldn\u2019t recognize them at once.\nNo, the clothes aren\u2019t the problem \u2026 the cold expression from before was so different.\n\u201cWait! Hunter Joo Shinhee, we have to finish our conversation.\u201d\nAt that time, the person who was persistently talking to Joo Shinhee earlier got angry and tried to grab her shoulder\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026go away.\u201d\nHe caught her gaze and backed away.\nThat\u2019s right, they used to be like this before the regression.\nHmm. I need to work harder on Dungeon Detox\u2026.\nThere was no appearance of Ki Yoohyun or Hunter Han Yiseong next to the twins. This is in front of the main hall of the Dungeon Management Office. Did these kids come here to do business alone?\n\u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have lunch now.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Rieul-ah.\u201d\nWhen I didn\u2019t come, Kwon Jiwoon came back to find me.\n\u201cAh, I\u2019m meeting my acquaintances for a second.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe twins looked very surprised when they saw Kwon Jiwoon.\nTheir eyes alternately looked at Kwon Jiwoon and me, and somehow they looked nervous. Why? Are these kids wary of fellow Hunter?\nThey turned around and whispered to each other in a low voice for a moment. Among the twins who came back to face me, Joo Shinhee was the first to exclaim resolutely.\n\u201cLead \u2026 Hunter Ki Yoohyun-nim also wanted to come today!\u201d\n\u201cTha-that\u2019s right! He was going to come and congratulate you!\u201d\n\u201cEonni, it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t come on purpose.\u201d\nI know. I already got congratulatory messages on the phone.\nI was very embarrassed to receive the commendation by myself, as I did the work of saving the Long-tailed Phoenix and saving Kwon Jiwoon with Ki Yoohyun. Since Ki Yoohyun was a hunter belonging to a guild, he was not eligible for the commendation\nHe didn\u2019t seem to care, but\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cWhy do you think so? It\u2019s a fair reward for what Rieul-ssi has done, please take it easy. It\u2019s a pity I couldn\u2019t attend in person that day.\u201d\u201cAh, are you busy that day?\u201d\u201cYes, I have to deal with a little troublesome work. There are a lot of people in the main office who will feel uncomfortable when they see me.\u201d\u201cWhat on earth did you do\u2026.\u201d\u201cHaha, somehow it just happened \u2026 congratulations in advance.\u201d\nWe had that conversation.\n\u201cYes, I heard. I heard he was busy?\u201d\nAs if he wanted to defend Ki Yoohyun, Joo Shinwoo quickly nodded.\n\u201cYes! The old raccoon could have just opened his mouth quickly \u2026 ouch! Ouch!\u201d\nJoo Shinhee pinched Joo Shinwoo mercilessly and lowered her voice.\n\u201cYou idiot! You can\u2019t talk about that! He said it was a secret.\u201d\n\u201cBut, I hope that old raccoon doesn\u2019t interrupt. In the meantime, Noona said she\u2019s eating with that white hair.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I think lead \u2026 Hunter Ki Yoohyun-nim still has an advantage.\u201d\n\u201cReally?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s lunch, not dinner, so there\u2019s still a chance of winning. Dinner is dangerous!\u201d\nGuys, I can hear you\u2026\u2026.\nI understand roughly what the misunderstanding was, but there is no end to this. I swallowed a bitter smile and first introduced the twins to Kwon Jiwoon.\n\u201cOppa, I think you probably know, but these children are Hunter Joo Shinhee and Hunter Joo Shinwoo of Cheongna Guild.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThey bowed their heads slightly with a wary look.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\ndull fellow: \ud314\ubd88\ucd9c (it usually translated to good-for-nothing, but I think dull is better), mainly used to refer to people who constantly brag about their family members.\nKi Yoohyun, fighting!!!

You just have to live your daily life in this second life.\u3011\n\n\u201cLies.\u201d\n\u3010Yes, it\u2019s a lie.\u3011\nHeat surged inside.\nLet\u2019s not get angry. I am an adult, an adult \u2026 think of this saintess as a superior employee who repeats funny jokes.\nShe\u2019s A and I\u2019m B. The saintess has Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s life in her hands, so I have to endure it, I have to endure it\u2026\u2026.\n\u3010You\u2019re too much. I saved his life without any conditions, but such heartless words.\u3011\nHeh, do you read my mind?\n\u3010Someday, you will reach the Gate. Your cat will guide you.\u3011\n\u201c\u2026\u2026really?\u201d\nAre you sure you\u2019re saying that after looking at Mieum\u2019s daily life? She\u2019s enjoying it after adjusting perfectly to the life of royalties.\n\u3010Ahaha, she woke up after a long time, so she got so excited. Please understand. She will fulfill the role of the seventh agent properly.\u3011\n\u201cWhat is the Gate?\u201d\n\u3010The Ultimate Gate. The pathway to reach the truth of the universe. The garden where the Great Master sleeps.\u3011\nI updated her description in my mind.\nMeaningful\u2026.\nA saintess character who appears at the beginning of a fantasy RPG game and speaks meaningful words to the novice protagonist, but does not explain it in an understandable way.\nThe white light grew stronger and the darkness trembled. This conversation seemed to have come to an end.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u3010You said I\u2019m a saintess. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been called like this. I really like this character.\u3011\n\u201cIs the system you?\u201d\n\u3010Rather than that, a tool for contacting this world without defying causality is what you call a system. Well, I made it, though.\u3011\nShe drifted away. Only the voice can be heard clearly.\n\u3010Let me formally introduce myself to you. I\u2026\u2026\u3011\n\u3010The One-in-All. The All-in-One.\u3011\n\u3010The one who observes all three times.\u3011\n\u3010The manager who guards the Gate, and\u2026\u3011\nAn unpronounceable name tickled my ears.\nThe light was swallowed up by the chaos boiling deep in the darkness.\nNot yet. There was something I had to ask.\nI cried out in a hurry.\n\u201cOne last thing! Why does the future change after I returned? Did such a big deal happen because I came back to the past?\u201d\n\u3010I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t answer that. The law of causality applies strictly to me too. I cannot intervene in the actions of other Gods. However, you don\u2019t have to blame yourself for what happened today because it\u2019s not caused by you.\u3011\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u3010And what does that matter now? For now, first of all, please rejoice in the return of your family.\u3011\n\u2026\u2026.\n\u2026\u2026.\n\nThe first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was the strong waves of ether and \u2026 Kwon Jiwoon, who was lying on the floor.\n\u201cDeputy guild leader!\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi!\u201d\nI heard a voice calling me from far away.\nSlowly, I reached out and grabbed Kwon Jiwoon in front of me.\nAt that moment, the etheric waves that wandered around collapsed, and the translucent membrane was broken.\nPeople outside rushed in and stopped walking.\nIn the suffocating silence, the tightly closed eyelids are slowly lifted.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nAs if he did not immediately understand the situation, Kwon Jiwoon looked at me with a bewildered expression.\nHaha, it was an expression that really didn\u2019t suit his cold-looking face.\n\u201cUh \u2026 the phantasmagoria\u2026.?\u201d\nRush. I hugged the dazed Kwon Jiwoon tightly.\n\u201cUh, Rieul-ah, why are you here\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cOppa, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, heuk\u2026.\u201d\nYes, what the saintess said is true.\nLet\u2019s first be happy that Kwon Jiwoon is alive. Other things are just trivial compared to him.\nThat Kwon Jiwoon doesn\u2019t have to cry because he\u2019s left alone.\nWith that being said, it\u2019s \u2026 I think going back in time has a meaning.\n***\nKorea\u2019s No. 1 Hunter Community \u2013 Hunter Channel.\nFree Forum Board.\n\u2014 Ranking, The Slave Hunters Guild is banned.

My left arm and left leg came forward at the same time.\nClick, click, click! As soon as I climbed onto the podium with a creaking step, the camera flash quickly exploded along with the sound of applause.\nA middle-aged man with a gentle impression said something, but I couldn\u2019t hear it well because I was nervous. That must have been a good word.\nAfter receiving the square award that was pushed out in front of me, I was baptized again with photos.\n\u201cThis concludes the 19th Hunter\u2019s Night Commendation Ceremony.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve worn a suit, and I felt uncomfortable every time I moved. I came down the podium after greeting the audience with an awkward gesture.\nIt\u2019s over\u2026\nIn the front row, Kwon Jiwoon smiled and waved his hand. My eyes naturally turned to him. With a shy expression on my face, I hurriedly took a seat next to Kwon Jiwoon.\nAs to how this happened\u2026.\nAfter Kwon Jiwoon woke up within the barrier that day, I went back to the store once to check Ash\u2019s condition, but soon I headed back to the White Silver Guild.\nAnd I talked a lot with Kwon Jiwoon.\nThere\u2019s a lot of stories, really.\nKwon Jiwoon explained that in order to protect me, he had no choice but to keep a distance.\nWhen I told him that I thought my brother hated me, he was startled and denied it.\n\u201cEvery time, you told me not to show interest in Hunters and just be a normal person.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026  Hunters are ruthless and selfish, and fraudulent methods targeting the family of high-ranking Hunters are rampant.\u201d\u201cI wish you had told me that.\u201d\u201cBut \u2026 yeah, it must have felt that way to you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nI wanted to complain a little more, but when I heard his worrds, all my anger vanished and I had a hard time pretending not to cry.\n\u201cThen, Rieul-ah. I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve awakened, but \u2026 what happened then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026. so \u2026 first of all, my class is a Cafe Owner.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. That\u2019s right.\u201d\nFor\u00a0a\u00a0moment,\u00a0I\u00a0thought\u00a0he\u00a0was\u00a0going\u00a0to\u00a0give me\u00a0an\u00a0unexpectedly normal\u00a0reaction.\n\u201cI heard that your business is going well these days. The coffee you make is delicious, so it will continue to do well in the future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s definitely a good word, but somehow it feels like it\u2019s missing the point. It\u2019s an ambiguous reaction that seems to contain no soul.\nI felt like I\u2019m having a deja vu. Specifically, it made me remember the time when I revealed my Hunter Class to Ki Yoohyun\nKwon Jiwoon seems to have taken my words as a job introduction.\nNo, why would I suddenly bring up my job?\nI wish I could get rid of the stereotypes about Hunter Class. Someone in the world might have a class called Cafe Owner besides me, right? If there is no Cafe Owner, at least there is a Restaurant Owner. Maybe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, my Hunter Class is the owner of cafe. I\u2019m an F-class Cafe Owner.\u201d\u201cOh? Ah, yes \u2026 what?\u201d\nI roughly recounted what had happened so far, except for the fact that I had regressed.\nI couldn\u2019t tell him the regression part because of the limitations of the system, and even though it had already happened, I didn\u2019t want him to be saddened by the fact that I died once.\nSince I omitted the part about the involvement of the saintess and the system, it turned out to be quite a bizarre story.\n\u201cWell, roughly \u2026 that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\nIt\u2019s good to have an open conversation with Kwon Jiwoon.\nIt is difficult to maintain a serious atmosphere with family members for a long time. Should I say that my cheeks are itchy? It feels awkward and embarrassing. I was trying to bring up another topic, but Kwon Jiwoon suddenly opened his mouth.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what happened, you should be rewarded.\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI\u2019M SORRY FOR THE LATE UPDATE.

            "c84": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nAfter Kwon Jiwoon awakened a long time ago, we have been on a poor relationship, but there has been no more bad feelings.\nAlthough his way of expression was bad, Kwon Jiwoon may also have been concerned about me.\nMy parents died when I was a child and I couldn\u2019t even remember them. After that, my grandmother passed away, and my uncle disappeared. Kwon Jiwoon is the only family I have left.\nWhat should I do if he\u2019s in danger because of my regression?\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have come back, I shouldn\u2019t have survived. If it was going to be like this, I should have died the way I was then.\n\nNo \u2026 It\u2019s too early to think like this.\nI looked at the flashing system window once again. Then, I reached for the translucent membrane in front of me.\nI felt like my mind was being sucked into something, and darkness enveloped my vision. Soon everything became distant and I didn\u2019t even know where I was.\nAnd\u2026.\n\u201cBlech, blargh ugh, ugh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t stand the disgust and vomited.\n***\nA black space.\nAfter a while, a whitish light shone, and a different space appeared in front of me.\nThis is \u2026 this is our store? \nNo, the interior is a little different. There are no noisy cat and slime in sight, and there are no unusual signs on the outside.\nAbove all, there\u2019s a voice from a distance.\n\n\u201cRieul-ah, can you give me one more?\u201d\u201cEung. I ate it all.\u201d\n\nAh. When my grandmother was alive, Cafe Rieul was still my grandmother\u2019s cafe.\nInside the counter, my grandmother was knitting, and I, in my school uniform, was sitting crookedly and playing games on my phone. An empty store. There are no other customers.\nJudging from the level of the character on the phone screen, it\u2019s when I was about 16 years old.\nAt this time, I often came to see my grandmother after school. It was before I met Choi Yichan and Shin Mira, and there was no one when I went home anyway.\n\n\u201cRieul-ah, that must be fun.\u201d\u201cEung. It\u2019s just so-so.\u201d\nI answered with a sullen expression and tapped the draw button on the screen. I frowned at the bad result.\n\u201cHow is Jiwoon doing these days?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t even bring up Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s story to me. He\u2019ll do it on his own, you know.\u201d\u201cAre you not on good terms with Jiwoon?\u201d\nI pouted my lips with a complicated expression. I was upset, but it was hard to be honest. The ensuing words were hand-made tell-tale fights.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like \u2026 Kwon Jiwoon has awakened, he told me first\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nBang! Before I even finished speaking, the door opened with a loud noise.\n\u201cAaaah! I was surprised. What\u2019s going on all of a sudden \u2026 huh?\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon, who still looks like a student, was standing in front of the door.\n\u201cKwon Rieul, have you been here?\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019s up to me whether I come to Grandma\u2019s house or not. What does Oppa have to do with it?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201d\n\nYoung Kwon Jiwoon was still clumsy in hiding his expressions, so his emotions were revealed on his face.\nRough anxiety, and the relief that came to him the moment he found me.\nWhy didn\u2019t I notice it back then?\nA few scenes flowed in front of me as if they were fast-forwarding.\nA man who tried to kidnap me for the purpose of intimidation.\nKwon Jiwoon, who\u2019s deliberately trying to distance himself from me.\nHe tried to call me several times on that topic, but in the end he could not make the call and put down the phone.\nDarkness covered my body again, and then there was silence.\nThis time, Kwon Jiwoon was in front of me.\nIt seems to be in the future rather than the present, but I don\u2019t know exactly when. This is because the surrounding landscape was not clearly visible.\nKwon Jiwoon was expressionless. The dry eyes stunningly slanted down and directed toward the floor.\nIs there something on the floor? I couldn\u2019t see the floor because my vision was not free.\n\n\u201cThe Light of Healing\u2026.\u201d\nA white light appeared from his fingertips along with the trembling voice. The light that should have been absorbed by the cast target was not absorbed and floated in the air.\nOnce again.\nAgain, again, and again\u2026\u2026.\nHowever, \u2018Light of Healing\u2018 still doesn\u2019t work properly. Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s hands, which had been repeating his skill for a long time, fell down.\nKwon Jiwoon\u2019s expressionless face cracked. The deep emotion that pours through the gap \u2026 ah. It\u2019s despair.\n\u201cWhy this doesn\u2019t work\u2026\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange. It\u2019s a skill that I\u2019ve used hundreds or thousands of times, so there\u2019s no way it won\u2019t work. Please \u2026 again, I need to try again.\u201d\nThe result is the same.\n\u201cPlease, wake up \u2026 I came here late, are you mad at me for making you wait? Stop being angry and open your eyes, okay?\u201d\n\u201cHunter Kwon Jiwoon, calm \u2026 calm down.\u201d\n\u201cWake up. Wake up, please!\u201d\n\u201cShe was too close to the rift, we didn\u2019t have the time to handle it. By the time we rescued her, she was already \u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nTears welled up. The tears quickly burst into tears. A violent cry that makes even the listener becomes sorrowful.\nWait, no way this is\u2026.\nThat\u2019s absurd. I went back to three years ago, so this shouldn\u2019t have happened.\nMy vision shifted slightly downward.\nAlthough the face was invisible, the droopy limbs and the clothes that person wore were strangely familiar.\nKwon Jiwoon bursts into tears with a distorted face and recites.\n\n\u201cI, your brother is here, so please open your eyes. Wake up. Kwon Rieul\u2026.!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dark again.\nI could feel my mind being dragged back to somewhere.\n\u201cUhgh\u2026.\u201d\nI was nauseous.\nThere is no end to the darkness. Even though I couldn\u2019t even recognize my body, the disgust felt amazingly clear.\nIt\u2019s painful.\nSince I\u2019ve returned, surely this must be a time that doesn\u2019t exist.\nIt can\u2019t be true. There\u2019s no way that there\u2019s a future where I die and Kwon Jiwoon is left alone.\nHe was worried about me, so he purposely kept his distance, and I can even count the number of times we\u2019ve talked properly to each other.\nTo be left alone while I\u2019m being full of joy and happiness here \u2026 that\u2019s too cruel.\n\u201cLies\u2026..\u201d\n\u3010That\u2019s right, that\u2019s a lie.\u3011\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nLight suddenly poured out of the infinite darkness. The blonde saintess was standing there.\nThere was a more pressing question than what happened or why she was here. I shouted at her.\n\u201cReally? It\u2019s all lies?\u201d\n\u3010Sure. This world does not adopt multiverse.\u3011\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u3010When you turn back time, everything is a time that does not exist, and it\u2019s a possibility that won\u2019t come true. It\u2019s just a lie I made up.\u3011\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u3010Rest assured. I\u2019m serious.\u3011\nI was relieved at first.\nThen, I got angry.\nIf it\u2019s a complete lie, why did you surprise me by showing this?\n\u3010I feel like you are regretting your return. By turning back time, you have already saved your family.\u3011\nIt didn\u2019t comfort me at all.\n\u201cSaintess\u2026.\u201d\n\u3010Saintess?\u3011\nIt\u2019s long to say that it\u2019s a saintess character who appeared in the beginning of a fantasy RPG game and said meaningful things to the novice protagonist.\n\u3010You still say funny things.\u3011\n\u201cWhat happened? Is Kwon Jiwoon safe?\u201d\n\u3010Do not worry. When you open your eyes, he will return too. It would be difficult if he died here, so I had to use some rough means since I was in a hurry.\u3011\nI was relieved at first, but\u2026.\nThere was something on my mind about what she said.\nSo far, I\u2019ve met this saintess three times in total.\nOne time, when I tried to save the corrupted Long-tailed Phoenix today. \nNext, it\u2019s right now.\nOne last time\u2026\u2026\nIt was before I came back to the past, it was when I faced death in the last life.\n***\nAfter being killed by a monster, my vision was all covered in darkness.\nSuddenly, a blonde saintess appeared out of nowhere and talked to me.\n\u3010This is a big deal. I would be in trouble if you died here.\u3011\n\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\n\u3010It would be inconvenient to talk about it in this situation. Now, come here.\u3011\nA hazy light poured down and the surroundings changed completely. Blue sky and the gentle wind, the lawn was unrealistic.\nI, who just got hit by a monster, mumbled in bewilderment.\n\u201cNo way, is this heaven?\u201d\nIs this the beautiful afterlife, where I died after working every day? Post-labor beautiful post-life life?\n\u3010Unfortunately, that is not the case. You are not dead yet.\u3011\n\u201cWhat \u2026 really?\u201d\nI could see the phantasmagoria along with the pain, and I was convinced that my life was over.\n\u3010Accurately, at the moment of death, causality was cut off and this time axis was wound up on an independent loop.\u3011\n\u201cUh, huh \u2026 I see!\u201d\nI don\u2019t know what that means, but I nodded for now.\n\u3010Do you understand?\u3011\n\u201cUhm, no, not at all.\u201d\nThe saintess with shiny blonde hair burst into a cheerful laugh and spoke again.\n\u3010I am trying to save you.\u3011\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nI looked at the saintess with suspicious eyes.\nI knew intuitively that she was a transcendent being. Anyone would notice if they died and suddenly a woman in a white dress with shiny blonde hair pops out.\nHowever, there are not only a couple of people who accidentally get caught up in a rift and die an unfortunate death. Why is this saintess trying to save me?\nAn iron rule for single-person households in the city. You need to see something that sounds too good with suspicion.\n\u3010Because I have to.\u3011\nGently, the saintess smiled. She apparently avoided answering.\n\u3010However, due to the limitations of causality, I can only intervene with the Awakeneds. So, I will let you live on the condition that you become an Awakened.\u3011\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s better to live than to die.\nHowever, I still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m dead, and awakening was too unrealistic.\n\u3010I will give you the power you desire. Is there any awakening ability you want?\u3011\nI have a very consistent personality. The memory of this day was erased, but my actions were consistent even then.\n\u201cAbility? I don\u2019t have any\u2026.\u201d\nMoreover, I was in a state of mental exhaustion due to long overtime work.\n\u201cI just want to sleep a lot.\u201d\n\u3010That is not an ability.\u3011\nAt that time, I suddenly remembered the contents of a game I had worked hard on a long time ago. Yeah, there were times when I thought I wanted to live a life like that game.\n\u201cThen \u2026 cafe? I want to open a cafe.\u201d\n\u3010Cafe. You\u2019re an Eligibe person after a long time \u2026. it\u2019s not a common opportunity. You can be a great hero if you want to.\u3011\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not interested in that.\u201d\n\u3010Swordsman, wizard, no, any class can give you the ability to aim for the top of the world.\u3011\n\u201cThe position I want is an innkeeper who sees off the main character in the village for beginners in RPG games.\u201d\n\u3010You are telling a very interesting story \u2026 Yes, if that\u2019s what your wish is.\u3011\n***\n\u2026\u2026.\n\u2026\u2026.\nThe darkness enveloped me again and when I opened my eyes, I came back to three years ago, on my bed.\nI had completely forgotten this memory.\nHow could the memory have been erased so neatly?\nI awakened through a psychological test on TV and opened a cafe as promised, but\u2026.\n\u2018There have been so many unexpected incidents.\u2019\nI looked at the saintess, who was emitting a twinkling light alone in the darkness. She was smiling as lively as that day.\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nwhy you guys got paranoid so easily HAHAHAHAHAHA\nPLEASE DON\u2019T REPOST!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c83": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cWhere did all the guild members go? Does anyone else know what\u2019s going on?\u201d\nThis question was answered by another person.\n\u201cThat \u2026 these all the Hunters belonging to The White Silver Guild.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some Hunters who aren\u2019t present because of the Dungeon duty, but they\u2019re only a few. That \u2026 something happened recently, so our Hunters decreased a lot.\u201d\nHe lowered his gaze as if it was an uncomfortable story. Again, Park Heeyoung recited in a trembling voice.\n\u201cEarlier, that bird must have caused the problem! Otherwise, why the deputy guild leader suddenly \u2026 heuk.\u201d\nA mournful cry broke out. She looked really shocked.\n\u201cHey, calm down. This may be a simple barrier stone malfunction. Let\u2019s try it again.\u201d\nThe wizard closed his eyes and reached forward. However, the translucent membrane only shook a little, and there\u2019s no change.\n\u201cCough, cough!\u201d\nPerhaps due to the rebound of the skill, the wizard stumbled with a rough cough. The wind cut off the skill. When the wizard tried to reach forward again, someone stopped him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d\nAn old man came forward from the back row of the crowd.\nA stumbling gait. Seeing the people around  us taking half a step back with a nervous expression, he seemed to be someone in a high position.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this. Everyone knows how important the protective barrier installed in the guild is. As soon as the sun comes up, we will start working on the creation of a new barrier.\u201d\n\u201cWait \u2026 what do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cDid you not hear it? That\u2019s literally it. The father disappeared and the young hunter took over the barrier, and it seems that he didn\u2019t manage it properly.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nAt this moment, I really hated this arrogant bastard.\n\u201cIf a protective barrier is destroyed in one place, it will adversely affect the barrier of the entire city. If we leave it as it is, it will weaken the chain and increase the possibility that a rift will burst. We can\u2019t leave it as it is. I will close this place right now.\u201d\n\u201cClose \u2026 what about Kwon Jiwoon?\u201d\n\u201cWhen he wakes up, he will break the seal on his own and come out \u2026 if he wakes up.\u201d\n\u201cYou \u2026 what are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m late to introduce myself. My name is Kim Doochun, the Defense Barrier Response Officer of the Dungeon Management Office.\u201d\nTak! I slapped his outstretched hand that shamelessly asked to shake hands.\nMy stomach was boiling.\nHis words just now \u2026 this person intends to leave Kwon Jiwoon, who is now in a coma, inside the barrier as it is.\nI don\u2019t know how good he is in defense response, but how can he say that about Kwon Jiwoon?\nApart from my personal feelings for Kwon Jiwoon, I know his life. A top-class Healer, a deputy guild leader of famous guild, and a young Hunter with good looks to use.\nWhile praising that Kwon Jiwoon was great, I clearly remember how much burden the Dungeon Management Office put on him since he was a kid.\n\u201cIs that what you\u2019re saying now? How could the Management Office do that?\u201d\n\u201cHoo. So you can take responsibility, miss?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTsk, I don\u2019t think you know because you\u2019re an ordinary person.\u201d\nAt this moment, I hated this person so much to the point that I wanted to kill this arrogant idiot.\n\u201cEach guild\u2019s protective barriers form a single great barrier, and that plays a role in suppressing the incidence of high-grade rifts. The power of this barrier also helps when closing the rift. However, if this chain is destroyed and there is even an A-Grade crack in the middle of the city, can you take responsibility for it, miss?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, that\u2019s\u2026.!\u201d\nIt was the moment when I was about to scream in anger.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s strange.\u201d\nA low, calm voice cut through the air. It was Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the cause or the details of the situation yet, but you hurriedly said you will close the barrier.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I know, the crisis response procedure isn\u2019t like that, but \u2026 it seems like you want to deal with the barrier quickly. I wonder if there\u2019s anything about it that would danger you.\u201d\nThe arrogant old man asked Ki Yoohyun with a disapproving look in his face.\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just accompanying Rieul-ssi. You don\u2019t need to know the details.\u201d\nSmile. Ki Yoohyun, who was staring at the arrogant old man for a while, pulled the corners of his mouth.\n\u201cDid you not hear anything from your boss? There seems to be no possibility of promotion.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, wha-what\u2026.!\u201d\nPerhaps promotion was a red button, the  arrogant old man\u2019s face quickly turned red with anger.\n\u201cOne more thing. The protective barrier here has not been destroyed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Is that true?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was destroyed once, exactly, but regenerated shortly thereafter.\u201d\n\u201cWh-wha-what nonsense!\u201d\nIgnoring the arrogant old man\u2019s protest, Ki Yoohyun continued speaking.\n\u201cAs you said, this barrier is under the management of Hunter Kwon Jiwoon. Although the barrier is not a living thing, it does protect itself to some extent. It seems that the moment Hunter Kwon Jiwoon was fatally wounded, a barrier was activated to protect him.\u201d\n\u201cFatally wounded?\u201d\nA bitter light flashed in his dark eyes for a moment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange. He\u2019s from the Healer class, but Hunter Kwon Jiwoon, an A-class hunter, was fatally wounded in his guild building, not anywhere else.\u201d\nNaturally, everyone\u2019s gazes followed Ki Yoohyun\u2019s movement. His feet stopped in front of Hunter Park Heeyoung.\n\u201cHunter Park Heeyoung \u2026 do you have anything to tell? Did you not feel anything unusual?\u201d\nAll of sudden, her shoulders trembled.\n\u201cI \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Outside, I was looking outside\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019re outside. Then, you must have seen the Gate that occurred today disappear.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I saw it. It appeared big in the sky.\u201d\n\u201cAfter that, you discovered and reported the incident, and the response officer came so quickly, I guess you had a connection.\u201d.\u201d\nEyes are intertwined in the air. Park Heeyoung screamed.\n\u201cMe, a-are you doubting me?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s something you\u2019ll find out if you look into it slowly.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun came close to Park Heeyoung. His voice was so low that only Park Heeyoung and I could hear it.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better not expect the one who approached you to save you\u2026.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t hear the last words. I don\u2019t know what he said, but after Ki Yoohyun took a step back, Park Heeyoung\u2019s face turned pale.\nThe emotion that appeared in eyes that trembled like aspen trees \u2026 it was horror.\nThen, she vomited the words in a trembling voice.\n\u201cThat \u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to do it. The deputy guild leader, if only he didn\u2019t doubt me\u2026.\u201d\nWhen Ki Yoohyun and I left this place, the time when the white bird with its golden tail flew across the sky and scattered light.\nKwon Jiwoon, who was left alone, called Park Heeyoung and asked: was it Park Heeyoung who brought the dying Long-tailed Phoenix?\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me who ordered it. I already know.\u201d\u201cDeputy guild leader, I don\u2019t\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf you tell me honestly about why you did this, I\u2019ll take care of it on my own.\u201d\nPanicked by those words, she attacked him \u2026 and Kwon Jiwoon was seriously injured. At that moment, the barrier that was in a state of rest was activated, triggered to protect Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s body.\nAfter that, Park Heeyoung contacted that arrogant troll behind the same background and tried to fix the situation.\n\u201cYou! Shut that mouth!\u201d\nA roar from the arrogant old man sounded far way.\nMy patience ended there.\n\u201cHow\u2026.\u201d\nThe reason I\u2019ve been ignoring Park Heeyoung and did not do anything to deal with her, even though she has been very unkind to me, was simple. She was Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s subordinate, so I thought that she would be helpful to Kwon Jiwoon.\nHowever, it\u2019s not enough to betray him, she also tried to hurt Kwon Jiwoon.\nWhy? What\u2019s the price that made you do something like that?\nUnable to hold back my anger, I strode forward, but Ki Yoohyun grabbed my arm.\n\u201cRieul-ssi.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.I wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d\nA large hand covered my hand. Long, hard fingers dug into my clenched fist. It tickles.\nI had a scratch on my palm because I clenched my fist as hard as I could without realizing it. I was so agitated that I didn\u2019t even feel the pain.\nKi Yoohyun slightly stroked the red blood-stained wound with his finger and dropped a few drops of potion. The wound healed quickly. As if that was the only purpose he had, he let go of his hand and took a step back.\n\u201cJust, there\u2019s no need for Rieul-ssi to be in pain because of people like this.\u201d\nMy tears were about to pour down.\n***\nThe situation was all sorted out.\nLess than 10 minutes later, a new person from the Dungeon Management Office, and Hunter Park Heeyoung was detained.\n\u201cWhy \u2026 ho-how did the Director come all the way here \u2026 aren\u2019t you supposed to be in Jeju right now\u2026.!\u201d\n\u201cTake him.\u201d\nEven the arrogant bastard was dragged somewhere.\nNow, we only need to rescue Kwon Jiwoon, who is trapped inside the barrier. The new wizard tried to open the barrier again, but\u2026.\n\u201cEheuk, heuk!\u201d\nThe barrier doesn\u2019t even budge. Drops of blood fell from the wizard\u2019s mouth, who let out a strong cough due to the skill\u2019s reaction.\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who had been quiet for a while, sighed lighty and stepped forward.\n\u201cIt will be difficult to forcibly open the barrier from outside. The barrier worked to protect the caster, that is, Hunter Kwon Jiwoon. It recognizes an external approach as an attack and pushes it away.\u201d\nThe wizard replied in confusion.\n\u201cBut if we don\u2019t open this, we won\u2019t be able to save the person inside.\u201d\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t force the barrier to open, someone has to go inside the barrier and wake him up.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. It\u2019s just invisible to the naked eye, but the ether flow is tangled in there.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.wait, Rieul-ssi?\u201d\n\u201cI can do it.\u201d\n[Main Quest: Into the Silver StormThe barrier seeks to protect the caster.Come into contact with the barrier and rescue the caster.Contact the barrier: 0/1Rewards: Fragment of Memory, The resurrection of the Target]\nI glanced at the system window in front of me with dry eyes.\nNow, running a quest like this means I can do it. However, I did not say that I would do it because of this system that forced me to do it.\nThis incident didn\u2019t happen before the regression. Back then, the White Silver Guild was solid, and Kwon Jiwoon was also safe.\nThat\u2019s why I subconsciously thought that nothing would happen to Kwon Jiwoon again this time.\nHowever, something that\u2019s different from the pre-regression past happened again. As far as I know, the variable is only me who came back from the future.\nIf the situation is like this\u2026\u2026.\nWhat if it happened because I changed the future?\nJust as saving Ash turned into a big deal, what if something I didn\u2019t notice led to this?\n\u2026\u2026what if it\u2019s because of me?\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThe \u201cold man\u201d used in this chapter is actually a very rude slang lol it\u2019s like \u201cold man (derogatory)\n(I love how the ML plays the part as a safety net in this story \u2026 it\u2019s imporant to have someone who can do everything for you if you dream of a lazy future.\nand save your tears for the next chapter, everyone. don\u2019t cry yet T___T (yes, this is me purposefully leaving you all with cliffhanger)\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c82": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThe site of Yongsan was filled with chaos.\n\u201cHunter-nim, be careful!\u201d\nKim Jina shouted at a Hunter who was distracted. The called Hunter quickly turned around and swung his weapon.\nSplosh! The monster that appeared from behind was hit with the weapon in the head, but there was no damage. The black mucus limped for a moment, and only took a step back.\n\u2018Monster? No, it can\u2019t be \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen a monster like this before.\u2019\n\nAn amorphous black mass that constantly changes shape. With slow action, it only showed little aggression. As if looking for something, it tapped the people around it and wandered around.\nThe strange thing is that attack doesn\u2019t work on it. It\u2019s physically possible to push it slightly, but no attack could defeat that monster. Some people with sensitive constitution were confused when they saw the monster. Just looking at it seemed to shock their mental strength.\nKim Jina has memorized numerous books about dungeons so far, but there was no data on such a thing in any book. She\u2019s not even sure if it\u2019s an actual living thing in the first place.\nAnd there was another surprise.\n\u2018Otherworld Gate\u2026.\u2019\nKim Jina looked up at the sky. There was a huge hole in the sky emitting a strange light. So far, it\u2019s still quiet, but the magical light is getting stronger. The sky seems to be looking at her.\nIt looked similar to a rift, so she tried to measure the mana with a measuring instrument, but the ether-meter only gave an error. It\u2019s different from the usual rifts. No rifts have ever shown this pattern.\n\u2018Then that\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nSuddenly, the data she read recently crossed her mind.\nA confidential document found in the Awakening Center, the now-defunct predecessor of the Dungeon Management Office. It was a record of an \u2018Otherworld Gate\u2018 that occurred only once about 10 years ago. It bears a striking resemblance to that.\n[Gate of The Faceless One\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Time Remaining until it\u2019s fully open 00:58:32]\nThe Faceless One.\nIf Jina\u2019s prediction is correct, what is going to appear through that Otherworld Gate is\u2026.\nShe felt a burning sensation in her stomach. It\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s an incredibly dangerous situation if her predictions are correct. They have to evacuate people quickly.\n\u201cSir, you can\u2019t go that way!\u201d\n\u201cFollow the agent to the shelter. It\u2019s safe in the shelter!\u201d\nShe shouted loudly at themuddled crowd. There was little Jina could do as she was only a civil servant, not an Awakened. She just encourages people so that even one person has less damage.\nHowever, the gate of the sky emitted a stronger light, and the power of the black monsters grew accordingly.\nIn the moment when discouragement rises like a mist, a white bird appeared from somewhere, cutting through the sky.\nA bird with a long golden tail flew from the direction of Namsan Mountain and slowly circled the air. The figure shining yellow in the moonlight looked like lightning.\nJina immediately recognized what that bird was.\nIt was such a mysterious wonder that even those who were in chaos would inadvertently be distracted.\nIt\u2019s so noisy, yet so peaceful at the same time. The traces of light embroidering the dark sky erase the anguish.\nThe next moment, the Long-tailed Phoenix flew into the Otherworld Gate.\n\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\nIt scattered into pieces of light.\nKukukung\u2501\nA heavy thunder rang out, and thunderstorms poured down. The rain began to melt the surrounding black mucus.\nThe monsters, which had been messing around and attacking people until a while ago, quickly lost its strength, melted down, and absorbed into the earth.\nLittle by little, the hole in the sky closed.\nBeyond the evacuation barricade, someone belatedly cheered. After that, a big round of applause and cheers followed.\n\u201cOh, my God!\u201d\n\u201cWe survived! We survived!\u201d\nEveryone was stunned, but it was the real that they survived.\nThere are still some remaining questions about why this happened. The investigation, post-processing, restoration, and-so-on \u2026 thinking about the rest of the work made her eyes turned dark. Still, even after this moment passed, she sympathized with the cheers.\nIt\u2019s over now. After everything, she survived.\nAt that time, she was trying to take care of the remaining civilians and guide those who did not have any injuries home.\nJina, who was passing near the mucus, was startled. It was because a familiar shape emerged from the black mucus that had just melted.\nIt\u2019s her troublemaker older brother. Her older brother who ran away from home a few years ago after changing his name to Jijon, declaring that he would make a name for himself in this world. She made flyers and inquired about his whereabouts, but there was no news.\nThen, all of a sudden he was involved in some kind of injury case. He became an important witness forr the Dungeon Management Office\u2019s investigation team, but he went missing again. Jina was so worried about his brother getting into all sorts of trouble.\nAfter being released from mucus, he looked stunned as if he had not yet grasped the situation. Jina rushed to to him in a fit of emotions.\n\u201cHuh? Why am I here \u2026 Kim Jina?\u201d\n\u201cEugh, this \u2026 this stupid person!\u201d\nBugh! A powerful blow blew through his back. \nAh, the stupid person who rubbed her back was exactly the image of her brother she remembered.\nAs she felt the relief, her tears welled up.\nThe last time she saw her brother was clearly pictured in her memory.\n\u201cKim Jihoon, what is all that baggage? What are you doing this late at night?\u201d\u201cFufufu, little sister, I forsook that name. From now on, call me Jijon.\u201d\u201cYou must be crazy\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen, Adios!

The heavy rain in early winter is chillingly cold.\nHot coffee is the best on a rainy day.\nHe must have been surprised because I suddenly pushed him into the space. First, I\u2019ll go back to the store, pick up Ash, and drink coffee together.\nI\u2019ve already done so many things that don\u2019t suit a Cafe Owner today, so I need a break.\nYeah, it\u2019s already late, but I\u2019ll have to ask Ki Yoohyun, who has always helped me, to come with me.\nFor Kwon Jiwoon \u2026 let\u2019s call him tomorrow.\nAfter deciding so, I looked for Ki Yoohyun and turned my head.\nThen, a red light shone in front of me.\n[Warning!Location: The barrier of the White Silver Guild has been destroyed.]\nWhat \u2026 do you say?\n***\nAfter a short deliberation, I decided to go back to the White Silver Guild.\nThere is probably nothing I can about the destroyed barrier, but there must be a reason why the system deliberately raised a warning notification.\nWell, when Kwon Jiwoon says, \u2018It\u2019s fine, so go home\u2018, I\u2019ll go home and drink some hot coffee.\nWith that thought, I headed to the White Silver Guild with Ki Yoohyun, but the situation was worse than I expected.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cWait, you are not allowed to come in here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the family of Kwon Jiwoon! Please let me pass.\u201d\nA person, who appeared to be a public official and was blocking the way, stepped away with a sad expression.\nWhy? Why are you making that face?\nEven though it was almost 1:00 in the morning, there were quite a few people in front of the basement of the White Silver Guild.\nHowever, the strange thing is that most of them were public officials, and the people of the White Silver Guild were nowhere to be seen.\nIncluding Hunter Park Heeyoung, there were only four of them. Even considering the late hours or the absence due to the Dungeon Raids, the amount is too small.\nWhere did everyone go?\nAnd where is Kwon Jiwoon\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\nAt that moment, I saw the inside of the open barrier room through the crowd.\nRift? No, the barrier?\nIn the middle of the translucent membrane with intricate patterns on it, there was Kwoon Jiwoon.\nThere was no sign of consciousness. Someone called him out loud, but he didn\u2019t budge. He looked like he was hurting somewhere.\nA Hunter, who appears to be a wizard class, forced the barrier to open. However, while muttering for a while, the wizard who used his skill shook his head.\n\u201cKeuh \u2026 I can\u2019t. It does not respond to any external connection attempts. I don\u2019t think it will be possible to forcibly destroy it at this rate.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t understand.\nIt was less than two hours after I left this place with the Long-tailed Phoenix.\nWhat has happened in the meantime that Kwon Jiwoon is trapped in there alone? Wasn\u2019t that just a barrier maintenance device?\nI looked back at Hunter Park Heeyoung.\n\u201cHeeyoung-ssi, what happened? You were next to Kwon Jiwoon the whole time, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 it\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\nHer face was pale and her lips trembled. At other times, she would have said something unpleasant to me, but Park Heeyoung also seemed to be greatly shocked.\n\u201cThe deputy guild leader \u2026 the barrier in the barrier room can only be operated by the current deputy guild leader. Earlier \u2026 he said that he would check it by himself to see if there was anything wrong with the barrier. I\u2019ve been watching the situation outside for a while, and in the meantime\u2026.\u201d\nThe Long-tailed Phoenix has been brought back to life, and the contamination of the barrier room must have been handled. Now that the barrier room is safe, she left Kwon Jiwoon to do what he wanted, and she went outside to check out the chaos caused by the monsters.\nAnd when she returned, the situation was like this, so she reported it to the Dungeon Management Office.\nShe said that the cause or circumstances are unknown.\n\u2026\u2026there was something suspicious about it, but anyway, that was what she said.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI was thinking about how neat the author put the scenes in order while translating this chapter \u2026 someone got his brother back, and the other lost her brother \u2026.\nanyway, I\u2019m sorry for ruining the mood by making a fuss, but even though the translation quality isn\u2019t that great (this blog is actually a personal blog runs by only me, myself, and I, if you didn\u2019t notice it), please do not be such a shameless person and indirectly (or worse, directly) claiming this is your translation when all you did was copy-paste the whole thing \u2026 big sites like this really have the time to delete the translation credit and the occasional chatter in translator notes but still keeping things like this \u2026\n\nWelp, I\u2019m going to take few days break after the next chapter. This kind of thing really feels demotivating lol\n(Additional Note: I\u2019m actually not greatly upset about aggregators because, well, they copy-paste everything from everyone.

He seemed to know for sure that I had just seen something.\nThe moment his eyes got even closer between the light silence,\n\u201cSsaeek, ssaeeekk\u2026..\u201d\n\nThe shrill breath of the bird evoked the surroundings. The bird was still dying on the rock.\nIs it the influence of the fantasy scene I just saw? I can clearly felt the feeling of the Long-tailed Phoenix as if its emotion could be grasped. Pain, sorrow, resentment, murderous intent towards the one who made it this way, and even greater despair.\n\u201cI saw something \u2026 more than that, what is the state of the phoenix?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good. Even if I remove the pollution, it\u2019s only temporary.

It\u2019s called the fruit of Yggdrasil, the World Tree.\u201d\n\u201cAh, that.\u201d\nI know what it is, I have it\u2501I was about to say that.\n\u201cStill, the fruit of Yggdrasil has never actually come into the hands of Hunters. Now the way to get it is \u2026 there\u2019s probably no way.\u201d\n\u2026.Huh?\nI\u2019m using it to make coffee beans? The coffee beans that I give Lime as a handful with rice?\nThat \u2026 it\u2019s a very precious thing\u2026.\nJust this morning, I served Lime a bowl full of that fruits\u2026.\nI quickly opened my inventory.\nAll coffee beans are being stored in this space at the store, not in the inventory. It is unknown whether this bird, whose time is on the verge of death, will be able to endure if we go back to the store to pick up the fruit first.\nHowever, if the sight I saw earlier wasn\u2019t a dream, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s here\u2026.\nThere is. Dark red colored fruit with soft texture.\n\u2018It\u2019s the fruit that the saintess gave me earlier.\u2019\nPark Heeyoung immediately accepted Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s words. Without mercy, she said again that there was no way, so let\u2019s get rid of this phoenix quickly.\nI pushed her away and approached the Long-tailed Phoenix.\n\u201cKwon Rieul? What are you\u2026.\u201d\nAnd pushed the small fruit through the gap in the open beak.\nWhen I pressed its beak tightly to prevent it from spitting out the fruit, I saw the bird\u2019s neck moving.\nRight after swallowing the fruit, the waves of light fluctuated greatly.\nWas it an illusion? Even though it was a room with no windows, a clear wind seemed to have blown from somewhere. The wind blew away the damp stench, making it easier to breathe.\nPaaash\u2501\nFine particles of light melted the darkness on its wings, the Long-tailed Phoenix reconciled with light and disappeared.\nFlutter, a feather fell on the palm of my hand.\nThe particles of light scattered into the air slowly formed, and a new Long-tailed Phoenix appeared.\n\u201cBeautiful\u2026..\u201d\nWithout realizing, I let out an exclamation.\nOn the straight white wings, a long golden tail falling from the sky. The silent eyes, that seemed to be able to erase despair, looked around.\nI was immediately understood why it was called a Holy Beast.\nFlapping its wings, the bird came closer.\nTiling, the alarm sounded just in time. The Long-tailed Phoenix suddenly came to me as if it knew the contents of the notification window.\n[3. Fragment Fused with SacrificeDestroy the Last Fragment 0/1: (Completed)]\n[4.

Now it was time to go out to the ground with a bird that was surprisingly light compared to its size.\n\u201cI have to release it outside. Oppa, let\u2019s go together.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a bird found in their guild, so Kwon Jiwoon must be concerned about the whole story. I recommended it with that in mind.\n\u201cGo first.\u201d\nHowever, Kwon Jiwoon gently pushed my back forward.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got work to do here.\u201d\nThe barrier installed under a guild protects individual guild, but at the same it\u2019s also part of the barrier that protects the entire city. Restoration is urgently needed, and as it is unknown how the Long-tailed Phoenix, which broke through the seal and swallowed the fragment, was abandoned, there must be a lot of work to be done.\nThat\u2019s true, but \u2026 I thought we\u2019d surely go together. I felt a little hurt.\n\u201cOf course, there are a lot of things I want to ask you. Still \u2026 I\u2019ll tell you the details after I get back.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\nWe have been avoiding each other, but now is the time to really talk to Kwon Jiwoon.\n\u201c\u2026.I will back soon.\u201d\n\u201cHunter Ki Yoohyun, please take good care of Rieul.\u201d\nWith those words, Kwon Jiwoon left the door first with Park Heeyoung.\nThe quest, which suddenly began, is now in its final stage. It will be over soon, so was it because of the relief that I could talk to Kwon Jiwoon about what I couldn\u2019t talk about before?\nWhy did Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s cold, hardened face go unnoticed? Why\u2026.\n***\nThe Long-tailed Phoenix was released near Namsan Park, the target location.\n\u201cWoah\u2026.!\u201d\nAfter flapping its wings a few times, the bird soon found its strength. It looked back at me for a moment and then immediately moved its wings vigorously.\nA bird resurrected from death split the air.\n***\nIn front of the base of the target he had been following for a long time, journalist Kim Taewoon\u2019s mind was surprisingly calm.\nThere was no such thing as a tremor. Just a little excitement and the joy of finally being able to tell the world the truth.\nWhy had he forgotten this joy until now?\nThat day, the moment he drank lemonade at the cafe in front of the Dungeon Gate, Kim Taewoon was truly reborn.\nAnd currently.\n\u201cHey, are you crazy?

Don\u2019t pester them, let\u2019s stay quiet.\u201d\u201cDepartment head, please trust me once.\u201c\u201cYou said the same thing when you almost shut down the company because you touched Muwon before.\u201d\u201cAt that time \u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Still, this time it\u2019s different.\u201d\u201cNot to mention, the main article of this issue has been decided. We will announce the MBTI of the Top 50 rankers.\u201d\u201cWho sees stuff like MBTI?\u201d\u201cWhy? MBTI is good. Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s popular nowadays? Everyone who reads our article wants to read Rankers\u2019 gossip. Why are you suddenly making a fuss about selling the Neo-Crown Party? Have you become a righteous journalist these days?\u201d\u201cDepartment head, you said you\u2019re going to make a big hit in Hunter Scope.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all bullshit I said when I was young. Taewoon-ah, my kids will go to college next year\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh, hyung!\u201d\nBang!\n\u201cThat bastard\u2026.\u201d\nAs if he had become the main character in a detective movie, he even threw his resignation card so nicely and finally found this place.\nThe secret hideout of the illegal guild, Neo-Crown Party.\nSuspicion of smuggling and various illegal acts, allegations of illegal funds by large guilds, etc. He was going to figure it all out today.\n[Paparazzi (E) (In use)(Lv.1) You can follow the target without being detected for a certain period of time. (0:38:13)]\nThere is still plenty of time to use the skill.\nKim Taewoon carefully examined the surroundings and entered the hideout decorated with an ordinary store.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHe held his breath and waited for a while, but he couldn\u2019t feel any movement inside.\nAt first glance, it looks like an ordinary stationery store. On a shelf on one wall, stationery items with large slimes were lined up. On the other side, there is a checkout counter and a poster for a discount event.\nHowever, when the button hidden under the checkout counter was operated, the display case moved and the hidden safe was revealed.\n\u2018The number is \u2026 that\u2019s right.\u2019\nThis is information obtained by feeding the secret informant with a lot of alcohol, money, and food.\nFor a moment, he felt nervous about what an opportunity this is.\nClick, the safe opened with a sound. Inside were two fairly thick notebooks.\nKim Taewoon immediately picked up one book. When he opened it, each page was full of numbers. Is it a slush fund book?\nHowever, Kim Taewoon, who looked through the numbers closely, realized that the content was different from what he expected.\n\u2018You disgusting guys\u2026..\u2019\nThis is a record of the Long-tailed Phoenix. These people slowly contaminated its body by continuously injecting dark ether. Then, it was used as a sacrifice to summon \u2018something\u2019.\nRare monster smuggling, illegal experimentation \u2026 even if the illegality is not considered, the horrors of the attached photo have caused physiological discomfort. \nThe other notebook contained the flow of funds to acquire dark ether. A huge amount of money was deposited into the account of the Neo-Crown Party. It\u2019s been through the middle bridge many times, but the source is clear \u2026 this is an important piece of data.\n\u2018For now, I\u2019ll take pictures of everything.\u2019\nClick, click!\nIf he take the original as it is, there was a risk of being caught breaking in. Kim Taewoon was absorbed in photographing every page of the ledger.\nAs a result, he was late to notice the signs of an approaching presence.\nKung, thump, kung\u2501\nKim Taewoon was startled by the sound of heavy footsteps.\nThere should still be plenty of time for the skill to be effective, did someone follow him?\nHe hurriedly turned the display back and stood in the corner of the wall, covering himself with curtains. It was a poor hiding, but now he had no choice but to hope that he would not be found out.\nHowever, it was neither a pawn of the Neo-Crown Party nor a security guard who entered the hideout.\n\u2018Wha-what, what is that \u2026 what is it?\u2019\nAt first, he thought it was a monster covered in black mucus.\nNo, it\u2019s not. Trapped in black mucus \u2026 was human.\nThis amorphous black mass had devoured humans and made them a part of itself. Besides, he had seen that face before.\n\u2018The leader of Neo-Crown Party?\u2019\nHe was a man whom he had been following for a long time, but he disappeared when Kim Taewoon finally caught a clue. At the time, he just thought that he got caught following him\u2026.\nHis thoughts didn\u2019t go any further. His eyes met with the lump of black mucus and, to be exact, the person who was swallowed up in it.\n\u201cUugh\u2026.\u201d\nHis urge to vomit rose sharply. Kim Taewoon covered his mouth with his hand and silenced the sound. He was nauseous.\nIt feels like it constantly scratches and scrapes his mind with a fine needle. He knew as soon as he saw the lump of black mucus through the gap in the curtain.\nThere is no way he can stay sane by looking at such a thing. It\u2019s like seeing the chaos crawling from the bottom of the abyss.\nJust when Kim Taewoon felt his vision blurred and was about to collapse.\nHwaaak\u2501\nA bird with a long golden tail flew into the window.\nA particle of light from the bird\u2019s wings fell on him.\n\u201cHuk, haa, haa\u2026.\u201d\nThe moment he was surrounded by particles of light, his head became clear again.\nThe nausea and fear soon subsided. A mass of black mucus that had frightened him was melting by the particles of light.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI WANT TO KNOW KWON JIWOON\u2019S MBTI T_T\nPLEASE DON\u2019T REPOST!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

There was no energy in the whining chirping.\nThe saintess picked a fruit from the tree behind him and gave it to the bird. It\u2019s a dark red fruit that is slightly larger than the thumb.\nThe bird opened its beak and swallowed the fruit.\nSoon, from the tip of its beak, the bird was reconciled to light and disappeared.

It feels like I am receiving knowledge that does not belong to me directly in my head.\nThe Long-tailed Phoenix, which purified the pollution accumulated in the body, returned to the ether of light, and a new bird\u2019s body was created from the ether.\nThis is the meaning of the name \u2018Phoenix\u2018. The \u2018ether of light\u2019 that exists in the dungeon is the bird itself. As long as the ether system circulates endlessly, there is no death for this bird. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the Phoenix.\nThe saintess called me, who was distracted by the mysterious sight. She picked another fruit and handed it to me.\nThe moment I put the cold, soft fruit on my palm, the space completely collapsed.\nMy field of vision turned dark.\nJust before it was crushed, only her voice remained, tickling my ears.\n\u3010How is it? Your second life?\u3011\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u3010We will meet again.\u3011\n\u3010I hope you can get the life you wanted until then.\u3011\nIt\u2019s a completely meaningful words. I\u2019ve seen this a lot in games.\nA character who appears in front of a novice villager character in an RPG game, who peacefully runs errands at a grocery store or hunts slime, and speaks incomprehensible words with a vague expression.\nA character who only says a lot of meaningful words such as \u2018I waited to see you again\u2019 or \u2018I need your help\u2019 and doesn\u2019t actually give any help.\nWhen a character like that appears, something troublesome happens. I don\u2019t like that kind of thing.\nYou said you\u2019d let me run a cafe. Rest! Don\u2019t you know what it means? I\u2019ll take into account that there are more cafe customers than I thought, but I don\u2019t want to get caught up in big things I don\u2019t know.\nThat saintess, what are you going to raise me for?\n\u201c\u2026..ah.\u201d\nWhile complaining inside, a unfamiliar memory flashed through my head.\nI remembered. Where I met the saintess.\nI\u2019m sure that time\u2026.\nThe thought was there.\nA storm of light covered my vision.\n***\n\u201cHuk, huu\u2026.\u201d\nMy eyes were tingling with sweat. I blinked blankly.\n\u201cRieul-ssi?\u201d\n\u201cKwon Rieul, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nThe room was painted black. This was truly the barrier room I had been before.\nI don\u2019t know how much time has passed. I could feel the gazes of Kwon Jiwoon and Ki Yoohyunn looking at me anxiously from the side. I could also see the figure of Hunter Park Heeyoung, who ws agitated, too.\nWhat was that just now?\nThe scene that had been overly vivid faded away in an instant, so there was no sense of reality yet.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cUh, huh \u2026 I was surprised for a second \u2026 I\u2019m surprised.\u201d\nThe system said that it was a video of A-Class Golden Triangular Rhinoceros, but there were no cows, and it wasn\u2019t even a video in the first place. If there is a Consumer Agency for the system, I would like to file an appeal.\n[Thank you for using it.]\nA message popped up immediately.\nI\u2019m not teasing you.\u2026.\nKi Yoohyun reached out his hand and wiped my forehead with a handkerchief. As the distance between me and Ki Yoohyun got closer, I could see Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s expression hardening over his shoulder.\nKi Yoohyun, who bowed his head obliquely, asked in a low voice.\n\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nHappy 80th chapter!

At this rate, it seemed that the quest could be cleared smoothly.\nFinally, the last coordinates.\nTak!\nWhen I opened my eyes, what I saw was the hallway of a certain building.\n\nIt looked like a basement as there were no windows. The walls and floors were cleanly cleaned, but there was no sign of human\u2019s activity.\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026..\u201d\nThe strange thing is that the surrounding scenery feels familiar for some reason.\nI have no memory of entering a building like this, but the structure and the shape of the walls were not unfamiliar.\nWhere did I see it? Where\u2026.\nAs I was trying to remember, I heard a voice next to me.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, there is one thing I want to ask you.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t we agree not to ask each other questions?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that question.\u201d\nWhat is that question and what is this question\u2026.\n\u201cOkay, you can just ask.\u201d\nHis gaze was not directed at me. The bright light of an incandescent lamp illuminates his profile.\nKi Yoohyun opened his mouth while examining the structure of the hallway.\n\u201cWhy is Rieul-ssi involved herself directly in this case? Is it because your acquaintance is the family of the Hunter who was swallowed by that monster?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the quest\u2026.\u201d\nI blurted out the end of my words when I tried to answer reflexively. It\u2019s because I realized that the words I was going to say wasn\u2019t the right answer, it was just an excuse I made to myself.\nIt\u2019s true that I\u2019m bothered by the identity of the person swallowed by the monster. If it wasn\u2019t Jina\u2019s family, I would have felt sorry for him, but I wouldn\u2019t have taken the risk myself.\n\u2018That\u2019s what the system told me, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nNo one forced me to follow the will of the system.\nThe city was thrown into chaos when monsters appeared from a huge gate in the sky. It is different from the future I knew, the things that happened before my regression, and it is not a situation that I, a non-combat F-class Cafe Owner, can solve by myself.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the information given by the system with the specific quest, then quietly evacuating with Ash would be the correct action. There are so many strong hunters in Korea, and I am not even an official hunter.\nBut\u2026..\nI remembered the expression on Ash\u2019s face, the boy who was holding my hand gently while lowering his eyes.\nHe can\u2019t say what\u2019s inside his mind and hides his true feelings with a sulky expression, but even the faint trembling that he can\u2019t hide transmitted through his hand.\nI\u2019m not a person of great morality, and I hate dangerous things. However, it\u2019s impossible to pretend that I didn\u2019t know anything when I saw Ash behaving like that.\nSo the situation is simply like this. I didn\u2019t get forced by the quest, but the quest told me what I wanted to do.\nCome to think of it, it was like that from the beginning. It was my own wish to make coffee and open a cafe, and I also wanted to help Choi Cedric at that time.\nI was grumbling while following the quest of the system, but I actually wanted to do it in the end.\nSuddenly, I remembered what my cat said.\n\u201cMeong, waeooong (You always say you don\u2019t want to work, but you\u2019re a human being who likes to increase your own work)!\u201d\nWhew, she\u2019s right. I guess I\u2019m the problem\u2026.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, I just want to do it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason. It\u2019s just \u2026 I just can\u2019t ignore it and acted like I didn\u2019t know what happened.\u201d \nKi Yoohyun smiled slightly at my rambling words. He resumed his footsteps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\nOnly after seeing the door at the end of the hallway he was pointing to, I knew where this place was.\nA vivid guild mark engraved on the iron door.\nAnd\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Rieul-ah?! Why are you here?\u201d\nMy one and only cousin appeared.\nWhy is Kwon Jiwoon coming out here?\nNo way. The person closest to me is actually the final villain?\n\u2026\u2026of course it wouldn\u2019t be such a cliche development.\n\u201cKwon Rieul, how can you be here\u2026..?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Oppa.\u201d\nI really want to ask. Why is Kwon Jiwoon here?\nAlthough Korea is small, what is the probability of meeting my older cousin, whose relationship with me became awkward after I moved out of the house, while I tried to kill the enemy according to the coordinate values of the system?\nI couldn\u2019t think of it right away, but now I know for sure.\nThis is the basement of the White Silver Guild. In the past, there was a guild common warehouse here. When my uncle was still here, whenever I came to the guild building, I always looked at the warehouse, so I got used to it. The underground warehouse where various items were stored was a place that stimulated curiosity.\nWell, that story is more than a decade old.\n\u201cThere were some circumstances. I came here with a teleportation scroll.\u201d\n\u201cYou used a teleportation scroll?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! I can\u2019t believe an outsider enter the guild at will. What do you think you are doing?\u201d\nHunter Park Heeyoung, who was standing next to Kwon Jiwoon, burst into anger. Kwon Jiwoon stopped her, but her firm expression does not unfold.\n\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for the deputy guild leader, really.\u2019\nShe has that kind of look.\nIt\u2019s still the same\u2026.\nHunter Park Heeyoung, a B-class tanker of the White Silver Guild. I don\u2019t \u2026 we\u2019re not on good terms Every time I came to the White Silver Guild, she didn\u2019t like my visit.\nStill, her sensitive reaction just now is understandable.\nAll Hunter Guilds in Seoul are equipped with barriers to protect the buildings from rifts and monsters.  Barrier stones for maintaining the barrier are, of course, very valuable, and are stored in the most secure place.\nIf I remember it correctly \u2026 just beyond this iron gate is the barrier room where the barrier stones of the White Silver Guild are stored.\nNot only is the entry of outsiders strictly prohibited, but the door is not opened unless there is a special reason.\nEarlier, Ki Yoohyun said that there was the last fragment beyond this door.\nI glanced aside. Ki Yoohyun, who made eye contact with me, nodded slightly.\nWhy on earth is the last fragment in the deep part of The White Silver Guild?\nGulp. I swallowed my dry saliva without realizing it. It definitely smells of something illegal.\nSo far, I\u2019ve been steadily following the \u2018I was a novice village innkeeper, but now I have to face monsters\u2018 route. When I followed the quest, I refused the development that the villain was actually a close person. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gotten tired of such a twist.\nFurthermore, how will Kwon Jiwoon react if I ask him to open the barrier room where outsiders are not allowed to enter?\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWhile I was hesitating, unable to speak directly, Kwon Jiwoon spoke to Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you before. Aren\u2019t you Hunter Ki Yoohyun?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Long time no see.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your relationship with Rieul?\u201d\n\u201cHaha, I\u2019m close with Rieul-ssi. I\u2019m accompanying her.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon turned his head and looked at me again with a look of disapproval.\nI was in a mess after running and rolling in the mall. As if he had guessed something had happened when he saw me, he approached me and quickly poured out words.\n\u201cKwon Rieul, it\u2019s dangerous out there now.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Uh\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cSince you said you became an Awakened, I won\u2019t ask you how you showed up here. We\u2019re in an emergency because of the occurrence of an unprecedented Otherworld Gate. I\u2019ll send Hunter Park Heeyoung with you, so go home right away.\u201d\n\u201cWait, wait, Kwon Jiwoon!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cBefore I go back \u2026 I have a favor to ask of you.\u201d\n\u201cSay it.\u201d\n\u201cHere, we have to open this door.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! Do you realise where we are and what you\u2019re saying? It\u2019s not a place to open out of curiosity.\u201d\nPark Heeyoung rushed in.\n\u201cSeeing you say that, you must have a reason.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Yes, it\u2019s a long explanation \u2026 there might be something wrong inside.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\nUnexpectedly, Kwon Jiwoon listened to me without asking any more questions.\n\u201cDeputy guild leader! I am against it.\u201d\n\u201cHunter Park Heeyoung, step back.\u201d\nThe moment Kwon Jiwoon unlocked the seal of the barrier room and pushed the heavy iron door to the side, the wrong was immediately apparent.\nThe barrier room was a small room with white stones on the floor and walls. It\u2019s not a specific item, but the entire room was a device that maintained the barrier of the White Silver Guild.\nThe barrier was densely engraved in silver letters on the square rock on the floor. The wall served as a medium to activate the barrier.\nThe room was all black now. It was black all over, as if paint had been poured on the whole room, and the letters, which was originally silver, was in a rusty color.\n\u201cUgh\u2026..!\u201d\nAnd there is a strong smell that you can still feel even when you pinch your nose. It\u2019s not a mere bad smell.\nThis was \u2026 this was the smell of rotting corpse.\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d\nIn a hurry, Kwon Jiwoon was the first to run into the barrier room. He checked the rock on the floor and sighed.\nThere was a large bird on the rock. The feathers, which was originally beautiful colors, was discolored to black. It wings were broken and it couldn\u2019t move properly.\nEvery time it flapped, a sound filled with pain was heard, and the bird\u2019s eyes were wet with tears.\nThe dark red marks scattered around it \u2026 it\u2019s the blood of the bird.\nI knew right away that death was near.\nThe smell was coming from this bird. As if foreshadowing the end that was approaching, the bird drooped. The blackened feathers were fluttering before they fell to the floor.\nWhy is this bird in the sealed barrier room?\n\u201cWho did this?\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon shook his head low.\nThe last time he checked the barrier room was three days ago. At that time, he said, there was nothing wrong. It is a place where no one can easily enter and exit, and there is no sign that the door has been opened by force.\nKwon Jiwoon and Hunter Park Heeyoung, who stood next to him, do not seem to know what is going on.\nIn panic, I hurriedly approached the rock and tried to take a look, but Ki Yoohyun grabbed my shoulder.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, it\u2019s that bird.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.what?\u201d\nHis voice, which had always been calm, trembled slightly.\n\u201cThe fragment \u2026 that bird, it\u2019s inside the Long-tailed Phoenix.\u201d\nTiling!\nAs soon as he finished speaking, a quest notification popped up.\n2.\u00a0Find the Fragments of the imitation of \u2018Shining Trapezohedron\u2018.Destroy the Fragments 4/5: (Unachievable)\nA notification that told me it cannot be achieved, followed by the next quest that appeared immediately.\n\n3.

As I brought my hand closer, I felt a burning sensation. The pain of the dying bird swallowed by the darkness was too vivid.\nIt was sad.\nIn addition, if it\u2019s fused with this bird, how are we going to deal with the fragment?\nAs soon as I thought so, the notification window popped up again.\n[ 1.

He tried to wriggle and pull his arm, but the strenght that was holding his hand only became stronger. A strange warmth was felt through the palm of his hand.\nWhen he sensed an abnormality in the shopping mall at Yongsan Station, the first thing Ash did was checking his mana.\n\n[You are using Mana Saving Mode.][Mana recovery amount: 35%][Due to lack of mana, some spells may be out of control when used.]\nHe had recovered enough mana to kill a monster like that.\nJust as he was about to release his magic, a soft hand stroked his forehead.\n\u201cAsh, I\u2019ll be right back after seeing what\u2019s going on. Wait here.\u201d\nShe gave him a worried look, as if he\u2019s a weak and young human being.\nHe has always thought it was annoying, but somehow it bothered him.\nOnce she finds out who he is, this human won\u2019t pat him on the head or smile to him with that stupid face. She will be wary and afraid of him.\nJust imagining it is very \u2026 he felt bad.\nMaybe it\u2019s because he thought about that.\n[Magic control is unstable.]\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nAt this rate, the person next to him will be caught up in uncontrolled magic. Ash hastily pulled back his magic.\nIt can\u2019t be helped. The only way left is to die. He made up his mind like that, but Ash couldn\u2019t understand.\nWhy does this person make such a sad face?\nAsh\u2019s current body is not his real body.\nAsmodeus, an incarnation formed by gathering magical powers of the primordial chaos, is also a small and fragile imperfect body due to lack of mana.\nThis dim-faced human seems to think of himself as just a \u20188th Grader Syndrome\u2018.\nSince it was a word that was not in the Human World Knowledge (Basic) that was first downloaded, Ash did not know what the 8th Grader Syndrome. It is probably a rare disease that affects children of a certain age.\nBack to the main idea. In fact, even if this body dies, he will return to the original primordial chaos and a new incarnation will be created. It is different from the extinction of real existence.\nThat\u2019s why Ash himself didn\u2019t feel much of a sense of crisis. He just intuited the expected end.\nBut why is this stupid-looking human being so desperate?\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, first \u2026 I need to take Ash to the store. It is safe there.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a way.\u201d\nA man named Ki Yoohyun created a door in the air.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a door that forcibly breaks down the space. However, the area near the Dungeon Gate is inaccessible, so you have to walk from there.\u201d\nAs soon as the space is broken, the attack will come, so he added that he will go with them.\n\u201c\u2026.I see.\u201d\nThe usage is simple.\nWithout hesitation, Rieul grabbed Ash\u2019s hand and opened the door. The surrounding black veil faded like a mirage.\nThe next moment, the stone wall of the Great Dungeon Abyss appeared red in the evening sunset.\nNormally, it would have been a very beautiful sight. However, straight away, black monsters poured  down from the Gate in the sky.\nThe monsters rushed in with a strange cry. Monsters that have crossed over from the Otherworld Gate, brought in by The Faceless One. There is no easy way. They\u2019re wandering endlessly in search of food.\nThat food is himself. It\u2019s an incarnation created out of primordial chaos. They won\u2019t stop until they have swallowed Ash.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nRecognizing the existence of Ash, a black monster suddenly began to run fast.\nThe dark-eyed man quickly used his skill, and a net of light stretched out and caught the monster.\n\u201cRun. I\u2019ll take care of these.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I got it! Ash, hold my hand.\u201d\nThat dark-eyed man probably hated him. \nHe smelled of white light. A person who uses the power of the Spinner in Darkness would have quickly seen through his identity.\nIn fact, this man glanced at his information right away with a cold expression on their first meeting.\nAnd yet why\u2026.\nThe clasped hands did not lose any strength. She still held him tight and pulled him in.\nHe\u2019s sure that she already knew. At least, the fact that he\u2019s not a young and weak person.\nStill, why is she so desperate?\nThud! A monster appeared from the opposite side of the direction they were running.\nThe arrow that flew in stopped him from rushing towards Ash.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026 you!\u201d\nThey were the twins he had met before. One of the twins shouted at Rieul, who turned around.\n\u201cEonni, hurry up and go!\u201d\nRieul, who briefly looked worried, held Ash\u2019s hand again and ran. She opened the door of Cafe Rieul and shouted as she pushed his body in.\n\u201cKwon Mieum, open the door!\u201d\n\u201cWaeooong, waeoog (What are you talking about all of a sudden?! Whoa, what are those monsters)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu!\u201d\nThe strange talking cat was startled. Next to her is a slime that always recites strange things. Even these cat and slime have never been afraid to him, an enemy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk. I granted permission to enter the space to the target, a part-timer at our house, Kim Ash!\u201d\n\u201cNyaaaa!\u201d\nA subtle light wrapped around his body, and soon there was a blue door on the wall leading to the space.\nRieul pushed Ash into the door as it was. However, she doesn\u2019t come inside. Her hand that was holding him tightly fell off, and Ash\u2019s hand scratched the air.\n\u201cAsh, listen.\u201d\nBeyond the door that was dazzled by the light and could not be clearly seen, Rieul grabbed Ash\u2019s shoulder and whispered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe in here. No one will find you.\u201d\nA face stained with sweat and dust, but Rieul\u2019s brown eyes, which are infinitely soft, were deeply captured in his eyes.\n\u201cYou may be bored, but don\u2019t ever come out and hang in there for just one day. I\u2019ll be back soon, so just stay here until I come. Okay?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\nHe ended up not asking anything he wanted to ask, until the door closed and she was completely out of sight.  \n\u2501 Why are you trying to save me?\nBeneath the huge tree trunk, Ash hugged his knees and sat down. His warm hand is cold.\nSomehow, he felt like crying.\nIt\u2019s only then that he realized.\nEven if he was just a piece of Incarnation that came out of chaos, \u201che\u201d wanted to live.\n***\n[ 1.

For now, I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m not curious.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun suddenly appeared, and his abilities\u2026\u2026.\nThe questions that filled my head were put away into a corner. It was more urgent to deal with this situation than to resolve the questions.\nIn such a dramatic way, a \u2018let\u2019s talk about it later\u2019 alliance was born between Ki Yoohyun and me.\nThe only way to solve this situation is to destroy the fragments. There must be something called the fragment at the coordinates given by the system.\nBut how do you move to the coordinates?\nWhile I was busy thinking about it, Ki Yoohyun took out an item that looked like a scroll.\n\u201cIt\u2019s teleportation scroll.\u201d\nIt\u2019s originally illegal to use it in the city, but since it is an emergency now, it\u2019s okay\u2019s fine, he added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to move to a place I\u2019ve never visited just by coordinate values. It could be a dangerous place. If you tell me the coordinates, I\u2019ll use the teleportation magic.\u201d\n\u201cUmh, Yoohyun-ssi.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cDo you mind if I come with you? I don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019m curious about the quest, and I\u2019m also worried about Rieul-ssi.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026thank you.\u201d\nAs soon as I tore the scroll, light wrapped around my body, and I felt as if my spirit was being sucked into something.\nWe arrived at an ordinary playground.\nThere was no need to worry about how to find the fragment in this wide place. This is because Ki Yoohyun quickly found it with his white light net. That skill is very convenient.\nWhat came out was a star-shaped ornament. Is this a fragment of the Tra-something?\n\u00a0[Item: Fragment of the imitation of Shining Trapezohedron (\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)It\u2019s an imitation, but the effect is certain.It strengthens the power of The Faceless One.]\nAs soon as I held the fragment in my hand, a notification window popped up.\nI applied force, but it doesn\u2019t break easily.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, use the ring you\u2019re wearing now.\u201d\n\u201cRing? \u2026. Do you mean this?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun pointed to the Cthugha\u2019s ring in my hand.\nWas this such a great thing? I used it almost exclusively for coffee roasting. I was skeptical and tried it.\nHyuurr.\nAs I concentrated my mind, the rising flame burned the fragment. It became completely white ash and the fragment crumbled.\n\u2026.you were right, this ring is really great.\nImmediately, the new coordinates were updated on the quest window. It\u2019s probably the location of the next fragment.\n\u201cThen, let\u2019s go to the next location!\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThis arc always makes me sad and happy at the same time T___T I was happy to see Ki Yoohyun, but \u2026 you\u2019ll see it later :\u2019D\nThank you Jasper for the coffee!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

The giant fell to the floor.\n\nThe particles of light formed a certain shape, and soon a man appeared in the air.\nSlightly long black hair, a coat wrapped around his tall body, white cheeks, and pair of black eyes that were filled with light.\nI called out his name with happiness.\n\u201c\u2026.Yoohyun-ssi!\u201d\nTak! Ki Yoohyun, who landed on the floor with a light gesture, looked around and asked.\n\u201cThis \u2026 what is this situation?\u201d\nI\u2019d like to know too\u2026\u2026.\nTeleportation? Or a summon? He said it was a crime prevention bell, but I didn\u2019t expect that Ki Yoohyun would suddenly appear.\nAnyway, thanks to him, I was still alive. I was so glad and grateful to the extent that I wanted to shed tears.\nI explained that I came to Yongsan with Ash and was attacked by a monster. After that, I\u2019m trapped in this space all of a sudden.\n\u201cAnd\u2026.\u201d\nAsh was still calm. He still has the expression that seems to be saying \u201conly this body will be dying\u201d right away. However, I can\u2019t let him say that again. I spoke in a low voice.\n\u201cThe monster is targeting Ash.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun\u2019s expression turned serious in an instant.\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s why something different from the past happened.\u201d\nHe murmured those words, it seemed that he has a guess.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to get out of here and go to the evacuation area.\u201d\nI agreed. People in the evacuation area could be in danger, and vice versa \u2026 those people might also put Ash in danger.\n\u201cYes, then\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nAt that moment, the fallen monster screamed and rose.\nIt became even bigger by merging its body with a new monster that rose from the ground. The limbs stretched out in a bizarre direction and were hideous. It tore the net and tried to attack Ash again with incredible blindness.\n\u201c\u2026.I handled it poorly.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who was not at all panicked, immediately beckoned to the monster. The moment the net of light tied the monster stronger and tried to make it stop breathing, something caught my eye.\nIt was hard to see because it was wrapped in black mucus, but a piece of cloth was wrapped around the monster\u2019s body.\nA piece of cloth? No, it\u2019s clothes.\nThe monster was dressed in a mess of torn clothes.\nBut I think I\u2019ve seen that gorgeous design that reminds me of a peacock somewhere\u2026.\nSuch unusual clothes, where did I\u2026.\nI grabbed Ki Yoohyun\u2019s hand in a hurry. The reason of my action was because I found something inside the monster\u2019s translucent body. Something wrapped in mucus that looks like a human being.\nSurprised, Ki Yoohyun stopped using his skills. I barely moved my trembling lips.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, that\u2019s \u2026 have we seen it before.\u2026?\u201d\nI remembered. When I went to the tutorial dungeon, I ran into a Hunter named Jijon.\nObviously, he \u2026 he was wearing that unusual outfit.\nNo, that was a long time ago. Maybe I just saw it wrong. That \u2026 that monster couldn\u2019t have swallowed a person\u2026.\nTiling!\nThen, a system window appeared in front of me.\n[You\u2019ve acquired the person\u2019s information.]\n[Name: Kim Jihoon (Hunter Name: Jijon)Grade: CClass: InspectionDetails: (More)]\nThe flashing system window in front of me pointed exactly to the fallen monster. Looking closely, a body, which was originally human, was entangled in black mucus.\n\u201cThi-this monster ate human \u2026 No, it was merged. How did this happen\u2026.\u201d\nWithout answering, Ki Yoohyun looked at the monster. A silent stare ensues. It seemed like he was reading the information by using a skill or something. After a second, he sighed briefly with a solemn face.\n\u201c\u2026.Ah.\u201d\nI could tell just by that reaction. He obviously saw the same content as me.\nI\u2019ve never heard of a monster that swallows people and makes them part of its body.\nBesides, why is that monster trying to kill Ash, not anyone else?\nWhat\u2019s that black gate in the sky?\n\u201cUgh\u2026..\u201d\nThe extreme tension made it difficult to breathe. While I was exhaling a short breath, there was a hand holding my shoulder. It\u2019s Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, calm down.\u201d\n\u201cHow can I calm down now\u2026.!\u201d\n\u201cLook this way.\u201d\nTak, Ki Yoohyun caught my attention by snapping his fingers.\nFine particles of light moved in the air, creating a square space. The prison of light wrapped around the monster, it gradually decreased and eventually shrunk to a size that fits the body.\nWriggling, the monster tried to escape the prison of light, but the prison was solid.\n\u201cI understand the situation. I know what Rieul-ssi is worried about. Still, you don\u2019t have to decide everything now.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cFirst, I made a simple barrier. The black monsters are looking for the boy\u2019s presence, but they won\u2019t be able to break through the barrier. There is time before the Gate in the sky is fully opened. So for now, calm down.\u201d\nAs I looked up at the sky, a system notification popped up. The time decreased in real time.\n[Gate of The Faceless One \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588Time Remaining until it\u2019s fully open 05:27:10]\nLet\u2019s calm down. He\u2019s right.\nYeah, whatever that monster was originally, I can\u2019t know or solve everything. The work that requires force is the domain of a Hunter who is stronger than me.\nSo let\u2019s just think about what we I do now. What I can do now\u2026.\nThe most important goal is for me and Ash to go back safely. There are several things I don\u2019t understand about this situation. However, rather than understanding the situation, this goal is more imporant.\nI finally calmed down when I narrowed down my goal.\nWhen I cooled my head, I could see the situation more calmly. Thanks to Ki Yoohyun, I avoided a life-threatening crisis right away. I might find a way out of this.\nThen, I noticed the system window blinking in the corner of my view. I checked the contents by selecting (More).\n[Details: Family Relations \u2013 Mother, Younger Sister (Kim Jina).]\nWhat? The person who fused with this monster was Jina\u2019s brother?\nI had heard that Jina had a troublesome Hunter brother before, but I didn\u2019t know it would be this Hunter.\nBut why does the system window show this information to me?\nThis question was resolved as soon as I saw the following notification.\n\n[Warning!Target: If the cursed person dies, it may interfere with the progress of the quest in the future.Please pay special attention.]\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nNotification with clear intention. A warning sign that sounded almost like a threat flashed red.\nWait, what this means is \u2026 that man is still alive.\nAnd the system doesn\u2019t want that man to die. That\u2019s probably why it stimulates my conscience and compassion by informing me of his family relationship.\n\u2018I know that, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nWhat do you want me to do?\nAs if responding to my question, a series of notifications came up.\n[Warning!The power of The Faceless One \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is active.It will be deactivated when the following conditions are met.Would you like to check the quest chain?\nYes / No ]\nOf course, I chose [Yes].\n[Main Quest: Stop The Chaos!It\u2019s a big problem.The power of The Faceless One \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been activated by the imitation of \u2018Shining Trapezohedron\u2018.At this rate, the chaos spreading through the city cannot be stopped.Stop the Gate opening and save the city.Rewards: Gate Extinction.

I\u2019ve been clinging to things that don\u2019t suit me for too long.\nThat was the conclusion that Jijon made.\nThe scene of the incident where the Long-tailed Phoenix disappeared a few nights ago. Choi Cedric just let Jijon go. He must have thought that he wouldn\u2019t be a threat.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see you here today.

Let\u2019s live a normal life after being punished.\nHe\u2019s ashamed to face his mother and younger sister, but \u2026 he\u2019ll have to contact them.\nIt\u2019s about 30 minutes before Rieul and Ash headed to the shopping mall. \nAt first, Jijon was walking the alley to get home and organize himself. Then, there was a quiet movement across the street. Someone\u2019s footsteps are closely followed from behind.\n\u201cAre you Kim Jihoon?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nA man standing in front took out his ID card from his pocket and showed it. The large mark of the Dungeon Management Office caught his eye.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to hear from you for a moment, so let\u2019s go to the main office together.\u201d\nA person standing behind his back gently placed his hand on his shoulder.\n\u201cUh, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you know. You were at the Cheonggyecheon arson site, right? There is a witness who saw Kim Jihoon.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nJijon soon gave up resistance. He knew this moment would come anyway. It\u2019s an arrest ending, isn\u2019t it perfect for a piece of crap like him? Jijon raised his hands and nodded slightly, revealing that he had no intention of resisting.\nAfter that, there was a stench coming from the wind from somewhere.\n\u201cOh, hot!\u201d\nSuddenly, he felt hot inside his body and Jijon searched for his arms wildly. It was as if he was burning himself with hot iron.\nThe Hunters surrounding Jijon were panicked and when they tried to subdue him, a star-shaped ornament came out of his inner pocket.\n\u2018What\u2019s this? Did I buy something like this?\u2019\nThe thought did not last long.\n\u201cBe careful!\u201d\n\u201cUgh, huaa! What is that?\u201d\nThe sky turned black. A stinky wind engulfed his body.\nCrak.\nA huge amorphous mucus that appeared from the sky opened its mouth and swallowed Jijon. The mucus that had already swallowed several humans became a huge lump.\n\u201cKeurere\u2026.\u201d\nAn ominous cry was heard.\nWith the agility unsuitable for a giant, the giant lump monster pushed the surrounding Hunters and ran away.\n\u201cIt ran away!\u201d\n\u201cAsk the main office for backup!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.a monster appeared! It\u2019s currently being tracked. Please ask for support from each guild!\u201d\n***\n\u201cAaargh! Run away!\u201d\n\u201cUgh, the emergency exit is already blocked! Go the other way!\u201d\n\u201cI lowered the disaster prevention shutter and closed the barrier. Come inside!\u201d\nThe shopping mall was chaotic due to the sudden appearance of a monster.\nI don\u2019t know if I can call that a monster.\nThe black and sticky lumps had no fixed form. It flows down, stands up on both feet again, and runs toward this side.\nThe monster control shutter was immediately lowered, and the Hunters in charge of safety management helped the shoppers evacuate, but the situation did not calm down.\nThe monster freely changed its shape and invaded inside. The Hunters attacked the monster, but it took no damage.\nIn addition to that, a huge hole appeared in the sky. Black lumps were constantly pouring out of the hole.\nI was on the way to grab Ash\u2019s hand and head to the evacuation area.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Ash! Be careful!\u201d\nThe monster who ran through the barricade aimed at Ash. I reflexively pushed Ash\u2019s back to avoid the attack, but it was pushed out of the disaster prevention shutter.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Uh!\u201d\nThe space changes.\nThe black lumps liquefied and wrapped around it, and all its forms began to collapse. The pillars, railings, and floors melted down, losing color and becoming an opaque membrane.\nOnly darkness that can be seen in all directions. The exit is not visible.\nA huge hole rattles overhead.\n\u2018Ash, come here.\u2019\n\u2018\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nI made eye contact with Ars and held my breath. Somewhere in the dark space, the sound of the monster\u2019s footsteps thumped. If we made even a little noise, I thought the monster would tear us apart right away.\nI clasped Ash\u2019s hand tightly to hold back the tension. The tremor calmed down a little when I felt the warmth of his small, soft hand.\nStrange. Why did this happen?\nI don\u2019t know all the future events that happened before the regression, but I clearly remember the big events.\nMonsters have never appeared in Yongsan. Even if a rift broke out in the neighborhood right next to it, Yongsan was still intact. There was even a meme called \u2018Yongsan Barrier\u2019. \nThe reason why I chose Yongsan as the place to come to buy clothes for Ash was because I unconsciously thought Yongsan was safe.\nHow come something different from before the regression happened?\nIs it because the future has changed?\nStill, it\u2019s weird. The sole variable that can change the future is me, who have the memory before the regression, but the changes I have made are only few.\nBoth the saving of James and the early rift in the Lee Chorok\u2019s farmhouse had a clear cause. However, no matter how much I looked back on my actions, I didn\u2019t do anything that would make a monster appear in Yongsan.\nIs it like a butterfly effect?\nStill, how can the monster that appeared in Yongsan has any connection with me, who run a cafe in front of the Dungeon Gate?\nTiling! My phone vibrated.\n[Safety Guide Notice <Dungeon Management Office>Around 17:00 today, an Otherworld Gate occurred over downtown Seoul and an unidentified monster appeared.We are currently investigating the cause and responding to it. Please be careful.]\nEven though it was a very weak vibration, the monster in this space noticed us. The black giant suddenly rose from the floor.\n\u201cAsh, get away!\u201d\nEven though I was closer, the monster\u2019s fist aimed exactly at Ash. It was as if the monster was being attracted to Ash.\nI realised it for sure. This monster is trying to kill Ash.\n\u2018\u2026.The Floor is Shiny!\u2019\nThe monster who was hit by the skill lost its balance and rolled sideways.\n\u201cRun!\u201d\nTaking advantage of that opportunity, I got up and took Ash\u2019s hand. I just ran blindly. As I crossed the ruined space in search of an exit, I was taken aback.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nAh, there\u2019s one more. The future I changed.\nIt was Ash who was lying in front of the store.\nIt\u2019s a leap, I was leaping to the conclusion, but\u2026.\nBefore my regression, the store was an empty abandoned house. What if Ash died there the day before my regression, without any help?\nWhat if, since Ash is alive unlike back then, this black monster appeared to kill the surviving Ash?\nI looked at Ash quietly.\nEven in this urgent situation, he has a cynical expression that seems to be indifferent to the situation, but his hand is holding mine tightly. The warmth, tension, and trembling are transmitted through the hand.\nIt\u2019s enough to think about it later. At the moment, one way or other.\u2026..\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\nAsh let go of my hand.\n\u201cShh, Ash, you need to get out of here and go to the evacuation area barrier. You will be safe there.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m nothing more than an incomplete summoned body created with insufficient mana anyway.\u201d\nI had an ominous feeling. It\u2019s not the usual setting story, I have a hunch that Ash would say something ridiculous.\n\u201cAsh \u2026 what are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cSince only this body will be dying, don\u2019t be so surprised by the subject, Human.\u201d\nBefore I knew it, the black giant followed us to a short distance. Instead of running away, Ash turned his back on the monster. I reached out, but I couldn\u2019t reach him.\nNo, I have to save him.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nI used the item in my hand with the feeling of grasping at straws.\nIt was a crime prevention bell from Ki Yoohyun. In a moment\u2019s time, my hand could barely grasp this item.\nClick, the moment I pressed the button that didn\u2019t make a sound.\nA net of light descended.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nYongsan Barrier: the world \u2018barrier\u2019 used here is actually \uacb0\uacc4, a Buddhist term originally referring to the practice of discipline (\u754c), that is, the act of restricting actions by dividing a certain area (\u7d50). Well, in story with similiar genre, it usually refers to barrier that divides the human world and the supernatural world (that\u2019s why, it\u2019s called Yongsan Barrier because it seems like Yongsan has a barrier that blocks outside monsters.)\nThank you bad cats robot and Lavs for the coffee!\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

However, when I saw the huge promotional placard, I hesitated.\n\n\u2018Demon Cult Twilight Official Sponsor\u2019\u2018The Best Fashion that Suits Your Missionary Work\u2019\u2018I Also Like The Black Flame Dragon on The Left Arm.\u2019\nWait, I think I can feel a strange aura in those clothes\u2026\u2026\nNo way. Everything in that clothing store has captured the heart of the 8th Grader boy. I grabbed Ash as if possessed and led him to a casual children\u2019s clothing store on the other side.\n\u201cAsh, if you try this and this on, I\u2019ll make you coffee when we go back.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Really? But I\u2019ve already finished my share today?\u201d\nAs Ash was young, I decided that it would be bad to drink too much caffeine, so I had set it to two cups a day.\nStill, sometimes it\u2019s fine to drink a little more. Good thing I still saved some milk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s try this on you quickly.\u201d\nIt was so hard to buy new clothes for Ash.\n\u201cCustomer-nim, it really looks good on you!\u201d\nThe clerk brought a bunch of things, said that they were the new recommended products. Shirts, cardigans, coats, and more. I told Ash to try the clothes the clerk gave him once, and then paid for it.\nEverything is so cute.\nAsh, who finally wore clothes that fit his body, looked different from before.\n\u2018This is the joy of spending money..\u2026!\u2019\n\u201cThis outfit looks good on you, too. You look like a perfect children\u2019s clothing model!\u201d\nAsh was surprised by the clerk\u2019s silly praise.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026 children\u2019s clothing?\u201d\nOops, he almost found out that this is a children\u2019s clothing store. I quickly finished the bill and went out.\nThe urgent business is over. However, I took the escalator upstairs instead of heading to the subway station.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re outside, let\u2019s watch a movie together.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind, I dont like that kind of thing.\u201d\nI knew he\u2019d say that, so I prepared the answer in advance.\n\u201cI have a two-person popcorn coupon, but if I watch it alone, I can\u2019t eat both popcorns. It would be nice if Ash is with me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then \u2026 it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\nSeriously, he\u2019s such an unfriendly, cute little thing.\n\u201cWhat kind of movie is this?\u201d\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s an occult fantasy movie. It is a story in which the main character investigates the events around him and finds out that it is the devil\u2019s work. It\u2019s a little scary, but in the end, they say that the main character defeats the devil.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAsh? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cWhat such a sad story\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know where the sad content was in my words, but tears well up in his eyes. Still, he didn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t watch it, so we headed upstairs to the movie theater to watch the movie.\nI need to buy popcorn first, but where is the popcorn stand\u2026.\nBang!\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nThere was a sudden roar in the direction of the downstairs where we passed. It followed by screams. People are screaming and running somewhere.\nWhat are you screaming about all of a sudden? Don\u2019t tell me \u2026 did any rifts occur?\nNo, there was never a rift in Yongsan in my memory before the regression.\n\u201cAsh, I\u2019ll be right back after seeing what\u2019s going on. Wait here.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! Wait!\u201d\nAsh tried to grab me in surprise. I told him that it was fine, left him with a large number of shopping bags, and headed in the direction of the sound.\nFortunately, the identity of the roar was not a rift.\nBut what the hell is that?\nThere was a shadow coming this way through the screaming and scattering people.\nHuman? No, a monster?\nWhat \u2026 what is that?\n***\nAt first, Lee Sein was not willing to follow the suggestion of her secretary, Aeon.\nCreate a rift to kill the escaped incarnation. The risk is great. If it founds out that she did it, the punishment will be unavoidable.\nMost of all, it was her conscience that stood in the way.\nIn order to develop the C&L Corporation, several illegal acts have been committed, and she also dealt with the competitors without hesitation. However, as for the general public, Lee Sein was a person with an average morality.\nA rift in the city center would inevitably lead to unrelated people being caught up. She didn\u2019t want to go that far.\nThere\u2019s still time. How long would the incarnation, who just woke up from the seal, have run away? If she calls the Hunters from an affiliated organization and order them to search for it, she\u2019ll find it.\nAll right, let\u2019s do that.\nAfter clearing her mind, Lee Sein threw the golden box into the deepest part of the drawer.\nAnd from that day on, she suffered from terrible nightmares. Her nightmares were a past she tried to forget about, and there were also times when unidentified monsters popped out in her dreams.\nWhen she was alone, an unfamiliar voice pierced her mind.\n\u3010Open the box.\u3011\n\u201cHuk, heuaah!\u201d\n\u201cCEO-nim? Is something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cAh, no \u2026 It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\u3010Open the box.\u3011\nUnable to endure the endless voice ringing in her head, she tried to return the golden box to Aeon.\n\u201cCEO-nim, did you call me? You don\u2019t look well.\u201d\nHowever, this time, a strong fear and rejection swept over her body.\nThe foreboding that something more terrifying would happen if this box was removed from her hand, the fear that came from it, and \u2026 the desire to acquire power!\nYes, power! Didn\u2019t she always want power?\nLee Sein wasn\u2019t good in her ability as a Hunter. She borrowed the effects of several items and barely achieved the Grade C. That\u2019s why, rather than moving directly, she raised the guild by recruiting excellent Hunters.\nBut if only she has the magical power of the incarnation, she\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nLee Sein suddenly came to her senses. What was she trying to do? That\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s ridiculous, but\u2026\u2026.\nIn the end, she couldn\u2019t throw away the box.\nAnd today, a meeting of the Guild Leaders attended by the heads of various guilds in Seoul.\nAs soon as Lee Sein, who arrived a little early, entered the meeting room, the sound of conversations stopped. People who have been chatting for a long time avoid her gaze with awkward smiles.\n\u201cWhat kind of interesting story were you talking about? I\u2019m curious, too.\u201d\n\u201cHaha, a rare item came into our guild. I was just about to show you.\u201d\nThere was a gauntlet on the table. It didn\u2019t seem to be a lie that it was a rare item since it already stood out just by its appearance.\n\u201cReally? Is this it?\u201d\nShe reached out towards the gauntlet, but the man on the other side stopped her.\n\u201cEhem! I\u2019m sorry, but this item only can be applied for a B-class higher, so for CEO Lee Sein-nim, it\u2019s a little\u2026.\u201d\nSilence. Subsequently, a gentle smile appeared. Eyes mixed with superiority cross in the air.\nThere was no one in this place as high-ranking as Lee Sein. Didn\u2019t the man who was condescending in front of her also asked Lee Sein to bridge his way to the political world? Nevertheless, it was funny of him to feel superior with one item like this.\nTaking back her hand, Lee Sein smiled brightly.\n\u201cYou look good. I hope you continue to play on this field in the future.\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s, CEO-nim\u2026.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s face turned white when he understood Lee Sein\u2019s meaning.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be safer for Korea to have someone who can directly operate these rare items?\u201d\nIt happened when she was on her way back from the conference hall.\nShe felt dizzy due to the lack of sleep and stumbled. The person who was walking from the opposite side ran and supported her body.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you all right?\u201d\nThe falling silver hair is familiar.\nIt was Kwon Jiwoon.\nUnlike her, he was a person of distinct talent.\nFrom the moment he awakened, he attracted public attention for being the first A-class Healer. She remembered the boy with silver hair who calmly answered the interview.\n\u2026 she also awakened on the same day, but the situation she was in was very different.\nAnd now, even in a situation where C&L puts pressure on Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s guild, he still has that nonchalant look on his face. After all, on the inside, he must be going to laugh at herself like the guys from before.\nFor that reason, Lee Sein hated Kwon Jiwoon. She just wanted to blow up the Hunters who relied on their talents.\nTak! Lee Sein shook off the hand that supported her and got up.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026it\u2019s all right.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t remember how she came back to her room after that. She heard a voice again, and it seemed that she lost her mind.\nAre you sure you\u2019re satisfied with this?\nNo matter how high she rises, her inferiority complex\u00a0will not go away.\nYou already know it. How to fundamentally get rid of this disgusting sense of inferiority. You just have to get your hands on its power.\n\u3010Open the box.\u3011\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nSuddenly, by the time she came to her senses, everything was already too late.\nLee Sein moved her trembling hand and picked up the golden box on the floor. \n\u201cOh \u2026. no\u2026\u2026\u201d\nIt\u2019s already late. The strange-looking pyramid model inside was broken.\n\u2018Calm down. He said it was an item that caused rifts. If it\u2019s a rift \u2026 I have enough resources to take care of it.\u2019\nShe is the representative of the largest guild in Korea. If she moves the affiliated Hunters, she will be able to reduce the damage.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t a rift that popped out of the box.\nLee Sein rushed to the window.\nIs that, huh \u2026 a Gate?\nThere was a big hole in the sky. An amorphous black monster poured down from a hole covered in dark mist.\nShe thought that there was an unpleasant stench, and a notification window popped up.\n[Congratulations!The power of The Faceless One \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been activated.Target: Remains until the incarnation Asmodeus is annihilated.This operation cannot be canceled.]\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nIt keeps raining in my city lately and the internet connection is just \u2026 bad T___T\nPLEASE DON\u2019T REPOST!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

He didn\u2019t want to tell her a dark story, lest he ever get in the way of his lovely sister\u2019s dreams.\nThe guild\u2019s Hunters are uncomfortable with Choi Cedric. In any case, he had a lot of conversations with the plant otaku, no, the botanist Lee Chorok. However, he couldn\u2019t possibly tell her the secrets of the guild.\nAnd that woman \u2026 Kwon Rieul.\n\nChoi Cedric recalled when he was caught up in the dungeon on a farm. \nHe remembered the taste of the coffee she made in the dungeon, he even remembered her soft voice. Her soft eyes were quite cute, and unlike her first impression of being emotional and vulnerable, she felt cool because she was bold when she appeared in front of the monster.\nSomehow, he even told her stories that he didn\u2019t normally tell others. He promised to visit the cafe she runs, but he hasn\u2019t kept it yet.\nHe vaguely wanted to talk to her.\nHe had her contact information in advance. However, Choi Cedric tried to dial her number on his phone several times, but in the end, he couldn\u2019t make the call.\n\u201cHaa.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t do it. He didn\u2019t know what to say.\nHe was a mess, with vague feelings of anxiety, doubt, and isolation all intertwined. He wanted to talk, but he didn\u2019t know what he should say to her.\nIn front of that person, he was only going to show her the image of him as confident and cool as possible, the appearance that\u2019s worthy of the No. 2 ranker.\nWouldn\u2019t it be surprising to call her out of the blue and talk about depressing things? She would never have noticed that his original personality was timid and gloomy.\nFurthermore, she said that she was a relative of Kwon Jiwoon of the White Silver Guild.\nC&L is constantly pressuring the White Silver Guild. \n\u2018So how can I tell her that I might do something that harms her brother\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nHe can\u2019t possibly tell her that\u2026.\nDid Romeo and Juliet feel like this?\nAround the same time that Choi Cedric was troubled by thinking of a somewhat absurd metaphor, in Cafe Rieul, at No. 16, Dungeon Gate 3 in Jung-gu, Seoul.\nKwon Rieul was faced with one difficulty.\n***\nEh?\nI rubbed my eyes and looked at the system window again. However, the content did not change.\n[Fresh Milk: Out of Stock\u203b We are currently preparing for stock. We\u2019ll send you a notification when it\u2019s in stock.]\nEh?\nIn the meantime, Cafe Rieul has been running smoothly. With the skill level up, recovery became easier, and customers consistently visited the cafe. I enjoyed the self-employed super easy mode, where there were somewhat unusual customers, but most were just ordinary customers.\nI was able to enjoy the dream life of a real cafe tycoon; roasting coffee beans, making sugar, and selling drinks to customers every day.\nAbove all, the existence of Ash, the all-around part-timer, makes all of this possible.\nThanks to this, sales of the store rose quickly, the sales of the store went up quickly, and through achievements, new recipes were obtained and my level was also raised.\nThe shop runs like a sail into the wind.\nThere were times when I felt anxious because it went so smoothly.\n\u2018It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s about time they started to get in my way \u2026 why is the system quiet?\u2019\nIt\u2019s just a baseless feeling, but I thought that the system wouldn\u2019t let this comfortable, trial-free state go unnoticed.\nHowever, I didn\u2019t expect this problem to happen.\nSuddenly, milk and whipped cream were sold out in the Dimensional Shop.\n\u2018Did I buy too much because the business is doing well these days?\u2019\nI paid ruby and tried to refresh the product list, but it was the same.\nOut of stock, out of stock, out of stock\u2026\u2026\nThey only took my rubies and don\u2019t give me the milk I really need.\n\u201cWaeooogh, waeooong (Aren\u2019t you thinking too badly of the great system).\u201d\nMieum spoke, secretly took the side of the system. I didn\u2019t know how this circular pattern of disturbance events keep occuring.\nThis reminded me of a cafe management game in the past.\nWith indomitable labor and selling personal information, I barely managed to get 1st place in the rankings, but only annoying sabotage quests were launched. I should\u2019ve listen when people called it Man-game.\nAnd there was a guild with a strange name, what was it \u2026 \u2018Only You Fold the Bitter Server Termination\u2018, people from that guild kept bothering me.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cOh, wait, we ran out of milk.\u201d\nAnyway, I can\u2019t help it because I can\u2019t find something I don\u2019t have. I thought I, unfortunately, should use ordinary commercial milk, but\u2026\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ash, how do you like it?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nAsh swallowed his words with a mixed expression. The satisfaction bar above his head gradually filled up \u2026 but it stopped in the middle. That\u2019s a more definite answer than the words he didn\u2019t say.\nI also put down the cafe latte I was drinking.\nTo clear up any misunderstandings, even the ordinary milk coffee is not at all tasteless. The harmony created by the bittersweet espresso and the fragrant milk definitely matches the taste of caffe latte I know.\nThe problem is that my taste buds have become accustomed to coffee made with milk from the Dimensional Shop. Furthermore, the Grade that came out when using ordinary milk was only 1 star, and the recovery efficiency was poor.\nThis can\u2019t be done. Anyone who has tried the coffee I made before will surely feel the difference in taste I didn\u2019t want to hear rumors that the taste changed after gaining popularity.\nEventually, I decided to remove drinks that use milk from the menu until milk was available again.\nThe problem is that milk and whipped cream are used the most after coffee beans in the cafe menus.\nWithout milk and whipped cream, the rest of the menu were Americano, iced Americano, and lemonade.\nNaturally, complaints arose.\n\u201cGive me a cafe latte, please. Huh, you can\u2019t do it now?\u201d\u201cPlease \u2026 I can\u2019t cheer up if I don\u2019t drink cappuccino from this cafe!\u201d\u201cI want to drink vanilla latte\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pay twice as much, so please sell it to me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pay three times, no, five times\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI sent back the disappointed customers and looked at the Dimensional Shop sadly, but it was still out of stock.\nWhere can I get the milk?\nAccording to the explanation of the item window, the milk that has been used so far is the milk of the A-class Golden Triangular Rhinoceros. Where is the A-class Golden Triangular Rhinoceros?\nTiling!\n[\u2018Golden Triangular Rhinoceros\u2018 has been added to the Ether-Wiki.]\nThe system notification rang as if it had been waiting, but there was nothing particularly helpful in the Ether-Wiki. The content was just a simple explanation of the ecology of the Golden Triangular Rhinoceros.\n[Do you want to play the clip \u2018Ecology of A-Class Golden Triangular Rhinoceros\u2019?Yes / No ]\nI didn\u2019t know that this wiki also has a video function\u2026..\n[You can\u2019t see it anywhere else! Let\u2019s meet the ecology of the Golden Triangular Rhinoceros, who lives only in Grade A clean land. A video to heal the hearts of modern people who are tired of city life, released for free for 3 days.]\nThere was a long ad phrase.\nAfter thinking for a while, I chose \u2018No\u2018 and got up. It is important to find a way to get milk, but I decided to deal with one of the delayed things first.\nSales have accumulated considerably in the meantime. Since I\u2019ve earned money, now I have to spend it.\n\u201cAsh, come here for a second.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Why?\u201d\n\u201cI have a place to go.\u201d\n***\u2019\nAn hour later.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nHis eyes sting. Ignoring the silent protest, I lightly pushed Ash\u2019s back.\n\u201cThen, I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d\nIn the end, Ash, who gave up his resistance, sighed and trudged. \nWe\u2019re in clothing store in Yongsan\u2019s shopping mall. Of course, I came here to buy Ash\u2019s clothes.\nWhen I first found him collapsed in front of the store, Ash was wearing very old clothes. No, rather than clothes \u2026 it\u2019s a double? The shape was difficult to recognize, and it was not even an ordinary modern doubles.\nThere were all sorts of miscellaneous things in the warehouse, but there were no clothes that a boy the size of Ash could wear.\nIn a hurry, I made him wear my clothes under the name of a part-time job uniform, but it was too big. The sleeves of the shirt and the pants are folded up, but no matter how you look at it, it\u2019s clear that he borrowed someone else\u2019s clothes.\nI thought I should buy some clothes, but I couldn\u2019t find the time to spare. This situation turned out well.\n\u201cWe ran out of milk, so we\u2019ll close the cafe early today.\u201d\nAfter closing the cafe early, I came here to buy Ash\u2019s clothes. Ah, of course, I\u2019m going to pay for his clothes.\nFor reference, Ash is properly paid for his part-time work. However, isn\u2019t Ash a runaway teenager with reasons that he can\u2019t say? It would be nice if he can save his part-time job salary and spend it on other things.\nIt would be best for me if Ash can keep working part-time in the cafe, but \u2026 he could go to school or something like that later.\nIn addition, the store\u2019s sales have also risen a lot. If it continues like this, I can buy a house, no, a building soon.\n\u2026\u2026 Hmmm, let\u2019s dream about the future of a building owner later.\nWhat should you do when you make money?\nYou have to use it right away!\nThe sales are piling up steadily, but I\u2019ve been busy and haven\u2019t had time to spend them.\nAs a member of the modern consumer society, I cannot let this happen.\nYeah, right now is the moment we need Labour Detox!\nSince Ash had only been at the store, I used this opportunity and went out of the Dungeon Gate to shop and eat out after a long time. I brought Ash to Yongsan, which is relatively close and has a lot of clothing stores.\u2026.\n\u201cAh! It looks good over there. Let\u2019s go there.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ugh.\u201d\nAs soon as he saw the crowds in the shopping mall, he had a tired expression on his face.\n\u201cHow about this? Try this on.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t have to wear it.\u201d\n\u201cThis is pretty, too.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026.\u201d\nThis uncooperative attitude. This must be \u2026 it\u2019s like a little kid who doesn\u2019t want to go shopping with his family.\n\u201cAsh, is it a lie that you are 17 years old?\u201d\n\u201cHuh, I got caught. I\u2019m actually over two thousand years old\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nHe\u2019s still keeping up that setting\u2026.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re two thousand or fourteen, I won\u2019t let you go until you choose at least three sets, so give up.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Cih.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything you like? Ash, you can buy whatever you like, okay?\u201d\n\u201cHoo, that\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\u2018Humans are trash\u2019, Ash, who had been following me reluctantly with a grim expression, pointed to a clothing store.\n\u201cReally? Then shall we go there \u2026 Huh?\u201d\nI doubted my eyes.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThe next arc is coming ^^\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c73": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nAsh remembered what Rieul had said.\n\u201cIs it delicious? Do you want one more?\u201d\u201cWow, Ash is really quick with his hands.\u201d\u201cOkay \u2026 It must have been hard \u2026. As long as you\u2019re fine with it, you can stay here.\u201d\nShe often smiled softly when she saw Ash, even when she was devastated by the work in front of her. There were many times when she patted his head or treated him like a child.\n\nShe muttered to herself that it was the 8th Grade syndrome, but he didn\u2019t know what the 8th Grade syndrome was.\nIn particular, when she looked at him with her affectionate expression and stroked his head, his anger rose.\nShe treats him like a weak child!\nHe felt like his heart was filled with unwanted warm and touching things. He knew it instinctively. This warm thing will fall like a drizzle and weaken himself. That\u2019s why he wanted to use his magic to scare her, but on the other hand, he also wanted everything to stay the same.\n\u2018The man with black eyes was unpleasant, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nToday, he also met human children who have quite good senses. They have eyes that could recognize the strong, so they\u2019re pretty good for a human being.\nIt was fun to make dalgona for the first time. As soon as his dalgona swelled up, it was funny that the woman next to him liked it more than himself.\nAnd he hates to admit it, but\u2026\u2026.\nHe really doesn\u2019t want to admit it, but\u2026\u2026.\nWorking part-time was more fun than he thought. Receiving and delivering orders from the endless customers. Every time he cleaned up the pile of work, the woman widened her big eyes and admired him.\n\u201cAsh is definitely a genius!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026this is not a big deal.\u201d\nHe said that, but he didn\u2019t feel bad.\nHe washed the cups and saucers thoroughly and put them back in place. When he looked at the neatly organized counter after finishing all his work, he felt proud.\nAsh is an incarnation made with the magical power of a Demon who was originally sleeping in the Abyss. \nTo him, the memories and experiences of individual are meaningless. If he disappears someday and returns to his main body, it will all be a memory that will disappear.\nThere are busy part-time job, children who can communicate well, and a woman who smiles with a sad expression. These are all memories that will disappear when this body dies, but somehow \u2026 he loathed it.\nThat\u2019s all.\nAsh laid his body on the futon. Next to his pillow was a large, bright red slime-shaped cushion. The woman with a foolish face left it here because she thought he would feel lonely sleeping alone.\n\u201cNow, you wouldn\u2019t be lonely if you have this, right?\u201d\nInvoluntarily, he touched his forehead again. Even though the warmth has already cooled down, the hand that traces the lost warmth is soft. The bright smile of the woman came to his mind.\n\u201c\u2026.shit.\u201d\nLet\u2019s wait a little longer.\nHe hasn\u2019t recovered all of his mana yet. Let\u2019s kill her when he completely recovers his mana.\nYeah, it\u2019s because of his mana recovery.\nThat\u2019s all. Really.\n***\n\u201cYou missed the incarnation?\u201d\nThe top floor of C&L Corporation, in the CEO office.\nAfter hearing Lee Sein\u2019s words, her secretary, Aeon, frowned slightly. It is a change of expression that is hard to notice if you don\u2019t look closely. However, it was a rare expression for him, who always had a calm and refined smile.\n\u201cYes, the box was empty. The area has been searched, but it hasn\u2019t been found yet.\u201d\nLee Sein looked over her subordinate\u2019s report again and spoke.\nThere was something strange about the report. The disappearance of the incarnation. A missing body.\nChoi Cedric, who was at the scene disguised as a bodyguard, said everyone was dead and no one survived except him.\nThere\u2019s no way Choi Cedric would lie to her. However, no matter how many times she counted, one corpse was missing.\n\u2018Was there one less person than planned from the start?\u2019\nLee Sein decided to forget about the number of corpses first. Those guys were so arrogant, they might not have reported the change in personnel. Dealing with the survivor, if there\u2019s any, can be done later.\nThe more important thing is the whereabouts of the incarnation.\n\u201cYou must find it. You know what it is. For our plan, we really need the incarnation of the Daemon Azathoth.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but where did it disappear \u2026 I don\u2019t see a clue.\u201d\nIt was a long-planned plan. First, the Holy Beast, the Long-tailed Phoenix, was captured and used as a vessel to summon the incarnation. Then, the dark ether was poured in little by little until the Holy Beast was completely corrupted.\nIn order to obtain the dark ether without leaving a trace, they had to take a detour route. It has been several months since they used the Neo-Crown Party to collect the dark ethers.\nBy sacrificing the completely blackened Holy Beast, they succeeded in summoning the incarnation. They dealt with all the people involved in this work, kept their mouths shut, and the access route was washed clean as well.\nThe incarnation was not yet complete, but it didn\u2019t matter. Lee Sein\u2019s only purpose was to forcibly seize the incarnation, then extract and use its infinite mana.\n\u2018If only I had that power \u2026 I can make Choi Cedric the No. 1 in the Rankings.\u2019\nIn addition, it is possible to shake off their disgusting competitors and put \u201cC&L Corporation\u201d in the top spot, in name and reality.\nIt was all a plan presented by the competent secretary in front of her.\nAeon was such a perfect secretary. All the secret measures he suggested were novel and achieved perfect results. Thanks to Aeon\u2019s advice, C&L Corporation was able to grow from a powerless small guild to its current position.\nAgain, the plan was perfect and the execution went smoothly.\nHowever, the whereabouts of the incarnation are ambiguous.\n\u2018If I can\u2019t find it\u2026.\u2019\nLee Sein tapped nervously on the desk. If the incarnation was found by someone else, not only would the efforts so far be in vain, but the guild could also be in danger.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the way \u2026 do you have any idea?\u201d\nThe secretary Aeon, who had a beautiful smile like a painting, gave her the answer again this time. His eyes, resembling imitation jewels, shone strangely.\n\u201cOf course there is a way.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nSo far, there has been no problem that has not been resolved just by listening to Aeon. Lee Sein looked at Aeon with trust and expectation.\n\u201cThis is it.\u201d\nAeon took a small golden box out of his arms and handed it to Lee Sein.\nClick.\nWhen she opened it, she found a strange little object that looked like two pyramids joined together.\n\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s modeled after a great artifact. It\u2019s an imitation, but it\u2019s definitely effective.\u201d\nIt\u2019s ominous.\nShe didn\u2019t know what it was. Nevertheless, she felt a very strange force in the object. When she looked at the center of the object, she felt her head throbbing and there\u2019s also a feeling of nausea.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an item that causes rifts.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! What?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so surprised, CEO-nim.\u201d\nHe gave a gentle smile that didn\u2019t match what he just said.\nThe incarnation is the alter ego of a Demon made with mana. If it has escaped, they will only have to create a new body and summon it.\nHowever, there is only one incarnation that can be summoned at the same time.\nIn order to summon a new incarnation, the previous incarnation must be handled, in other words, it must be killed.\nThis item is a rift generator that summons monsters of the Outer World. The summoned monsters will take care of the escaped incarnation after chasing the smell of mana.\n\u201cFufu, it\u2019s simple, isn\u2019t it? There is no need for CEO-nim to get her hands dirty. I will prepare the new incarnation summons. All you have to do is break this, CEO-nim.\u201d\nAeon grabbed Lee Sein\u2019s hand and pulled it up onto the pyramids. With a slight press, this little object already felt like it was about to break.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nSurprised, Lee Sein pushed the box away. Her hands trembled.\n\u201cAh \u2026 no matter what, I can\u2019t do such thing. The damage \u2026 the damage will be great.\u201d\n\u201cThen, I will entrust this box to CEO-nim, so think about it carefully.\u201d\nAeon added with a smile.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll soon realize that I\u2019m right. Don\u2019t forget. All you have to do is break it. You need the magic power of the incarnation, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nClick. Aeon closed the door and went outside.\nLee Sein, who was startled, tried to put the box out of sight right away.\nNo, she can\u2019t. She can\u2019t do such a thing.\nBut \u2026 But maybe\u2026\u2026.\n***\n\u201c\u2026..CEO-nim?\u201d\nChoi Cedric was surprised and stopped walking. Lee Sein, with a blank expression on her face, was walking down the hallway.\nLee Sein did not notice the existence of Choi Cedric standing right in front of her. It\u2019s strange. Choi Cedric came closer and called her louder.\n\u201cCEO-nim, where are you going?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! Ah, Cedric.\u201d\nLee Sein is surprised as if she just woke up from a dream. She tried to smile, she needed to tell him that it\u2019s nothing, but her lips were stiff.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nChoi Cedric asked, pointing to a box protruding obliquely from Lee Sein\u2019s suit pocket.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nTak!\nBefore Choi Cedric could reach it, Lee Sein slapped his hand away. Only the sound of the slap echoed loudly in the empty hallway.\n\u201cAh, I\u2019m just curious because it\u2019s something I haven\u2019t seen before\u2026..\u201d\nLee Sein apologized as she hurriedly wrapped the box in her arms.\n\u201cI was a little oversensitive because it was an important item. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\nThen, silence. An awkward current flows.\nAfter hesitating, Choi Cedric opened his mouth first.\n\u201cI \u2026 CEO-nim, I have a question for you, can you spare a moment?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I need to attend the Guild Leaders meeting soon \u2026 let\u2019s talk next time.\u201d\nWithout waiting for Choi Cedric\u2019s reply, Lee Sein left with a busy pace across the hallway.\nChoi Cedric, who was left alone, sat on the sofa at the end of the hallway. He took his phone out of his pocket and looked into it. He pressed a number, but he eventually put it back down without pressing the call button.\n\u201cHa\u2026..\u201d\nHis chest was tight.\nCEO Lee Sein has been strange these days. It\u2019s already been a few days, and when he asked her what\u2019s going on, she didn\u2019t give him an answer.\nShe didn\u2019t say anything about the black monster that escaped from the box. She\u00a0just asked several times if the number of bodies was correct.\nFeeling uncomfortable, Choi Cedric hid the existence of the survivor. It was just a hunch. Somehow, he felt like he should do that.\nThat survivor, a Hunter with an unusual name, Jijon, said he\u2019d quit his job as a Hunter, so it wouldn\u2019t matter\u2026.\n\u2018What the hell are you doing\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nNo, not just this time.\nAt some point, Lee Sein has more things to hide from him.\nAt first, he took it for granted that the management of the guild was Lee Sein\u2019s responsibility. He didn\u2019t know much about the complicated stories, so he had to be faithful to his role: raiding the dungeons.\nChoi Cedric\u2019s first Grade when his awakening happened was Grade A. Currently, he\u2019s an S-class. It is undeniable that the guild\u2019s full support has greatly helped him to rise to his current position.\nSo, in order to become a necessary Hunter for the guild, he moved according to Lee Sein\u2019s orders.\nHowever, little by little, more and more things inside the guild that he did not know increased.\nIt\u2019s a ridiculous imagination, but\u2026\u2026.\nSometimes, he even thought he was just a scarecrow who drew the attention of the public.\nSince when it started\u2026.\nIn retrospect \u2026 it has been since the secretary appeared.\nChoi Cedric wanted to vomit this sense of discomfort somewhere.\nHowever, who on earth can he talk to?\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nGo, everyone, choose your favorite S-class LOL\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST!!!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c72": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nLastly, I put a gas burner and a pot for my share. Since I was making dalgona, I was going to make a lot and store it.\n\u201cMeong, waeooong (You always say you don\u2019t want to work, but you\u2019re a human being who likes to increase your own work! You say you only want to play, but your behavior is completely the opposite)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nUmh. I\u2019ve recently started to feel the same way.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the problem\u2026\u2026?\nMaybe the DNA of the corporate worker from my past life has been exerted. Even if I think I want to play, I will unintentionally look for work to do.\nUgh, let\u2019s stop imagining scary things.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. The cafe would be idle once the hype died down. I\u2019m only busy right now because it\u2019s on the peak level.\u201d\n\u201cNyaaaah (Heummm, I hope it works out the way you want it to)\u2026.\u201d\nI rubbed Mieum\u2019s belly fat, and then returned to the front of the table.\nAnyway, it\u2019s time to make dalgona.\nFirst, I filled the pot with a little water and put plenty of magic sugar on the ladle, then I turned on the gas.\nJoo Shinwoo, who followed me, turned on the spirit lamp and raised his ladle, asked in a curious voice.\n\u201cShould I do it like this?\u201d\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t stir it.\u201d\nAt the words, the twins and Ash straightened their posture and grabbed the ladle.\nIt was important to dissolve the sugar as it is without stirring it. When it was heated for a while, the sugar melted and became transparent, and bubbles began to rise.\n\u201cNot yet. We have to wait a little longer.\u201d\nThe children were excited by the sweet smell that came out. There were some children whose eyes twinkled and blushed in an easy-to-understand manner, and there was also a part-timer at our store who worked hard to pretend that it didn\u2019t bother him.\nAs the sugar water boiled down, more bubbles came up, and little by little, it turned brown.\n\u201c\u2026You can stir it now.\u201d\nAt my permission, the children added the pre-dipped baking soda and began to stir.\nI also added two tablespoons of baking soda to the pot and turned off the burner. If you stir it while it\u2019s on the fire, the temperature will rise too high and there would be a risk of burning.\nWhen stirred quickly with a whisk, the dalgona turned light brown and swelled up.\nWhen it is sufficiently inflated and the inside of the pot becomes thick, pour it on the pre-laid sheet. You have to move your hands quickly because you have to scrape it all off before it hardens.\n\u201cWow\u2026\u2026..!\u201d\nWatching the golden lumps pouring down, Joo Shinhee exclaimed in admiration. Looking around, the children also poured dalgona on the sheet in front of them. It swelled up without a burn.\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay! It\u2019s soft.\u201d\n\u201cI made it better, eonni.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..Cih.\u201d\nWhen I was young, I used to burn my tongue because I tasted it when it was sticky, before it hardened properly. In the meantime, I burned the ladle to black and ate it\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cWaeoog?!\u201d\nI knew it.\nI hugged Mieum, who was still trying to eat a hot dalgona lump, and put her away. You shouldn\u2019t look at me like that. I saved your life.\nSince this dalgona is intended to be added to drinks,\u00a0I decided to harden it without pressing it flat. After letting it swell for a while, it hardened just right.\nThe dalgona, wrapped in paper, was broken into appropriate sizes using hands and spoons, and then I placed in a container.\nThe remaining process is simple.\nI put ice and milk in a transparent glass cup that shows the inside well. A generous amount of freshly made dalgona slices were placed on top and espresso poured over it. I also didn\u2019t forget to decorate the dalgona pieces made by the children as toppings.\nTiling!\n[Item: Dalgona Coffee (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 01:00:00)Effect: All stats are increased by 100% for 10 minutes.]\nAfter completing the drinks according to the number of people, a ringing system window appeared.\nDalgona coffee has a pretty good effect. I didn\u2019t expect it would be a 100% increase in status. If the strength is 100, it becomes 200, so it is more efficient than any buff potion.\nAnother thing to note is the Grade.\nUnlike before, a 4 stars Grade came out from the beginning. The status retention time is also more effective.\nThis was the level-up effect of \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2018. This is the meaning of \u201cwhen making drinks in the store, the level of perfection is higher\u201c. As all recipes went up to 4 stars, their effects were strengthened.\nIn addition, it was good to be able to drink up to five cups of coffee a day without getting the \u2018caffeine addiction\u2018. As I was dealing with the rush of customers, I quickly became groggy.\n\u2018What a relief.\u2019\nBut why are my eyes getting wet.\u2026.\nNow it\u2019s time to taste it. Each person took a cup of dalgona coffee and sat down.\n\u201cThank you for the drink.\u201d\n\u201cWow, it smells like sugar!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026hmm.\u201d\nFirst, I picked up the dalgona that was used as a topping and took it to my mouth.\nCrunch! The soft dalgona with a lot of air bubbles crumbled in the mouth. The sweet taste of sugar mixed with the slightly bitter burnt taste was a taste that I did not get tired of.\nI also handed out dalgona slices to Mieum and Lime, who were complaining next to me. The two of them were quiet for a while as they melted and ate the dalgona.\n\u201cNyaaaah (I want to eat more)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuuuuu, kkyuu!\u201d\nIt would have been nice to have Choi Yichan here, I felt sorry for him. This sweetness is just what Choi Yichan likes the best.\nI don\u2019t know what he does for training to get stronge \u2026 I wish he could come back soon. I\u2019m going to feed him a ton of dalgona.\nAfter stirring the dalgona powder, which began to melt little by little, to mix well with the drink, I tasted it with a straw immediately. Along with the sweet drink, I chewed a piece of dalgona that came into the mouth.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s delicious\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cYou must be a genius!\u201d\nThe children who drank the dalgona coffee poured out their appreciation. Everyone\u2019s reaction was different, but I could tell that it was delicious without looking at the bar above their heads.\nI glanced at Ki Yoohyun next to me. He, too, was drinking dalgona coffee in front of him with a soft expression.\nCome to think of it, I\u2019ve met him several times, but I still don\u2019t know much about this man. According to Mieum, the guess that his sense of taste is greatly weakened is the part that worries me.\nIt would be very stimulating if you drink a sweet drink after normally not being able to taste well. Wouldn\u2019t it similar to the joy of having a snack after having an upset stomach and eating only unseasoned white porridge for a week?\n\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\nOh no. I suddenly felt pity, so I must have stared at him too much.\n\u201cHave some more of this.\u201d\nI scooped up another spoonful of dalgona pieces and poured them into his cup. Eat at lot of dalgona, my action was out of a pitiful heart.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nSuddenly, it was quiet around me. When I turned my head, the children were staring at me.\nAsh frowned, and the twins\u2019 eyes twinkled. Then, when our eyes met, they turned their heads.\nGuys, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but don\u2019t be so obvious.\nJoo Shinhee suddenly brought up a new topic, apparently trying to cover up the awkward atmosphere.\n\u201cWe went to a B-Grade dungeon yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cI also got the boss. It\u2019s a B-class Venomous Kraken!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who got the last hit!\u201d\n\u201cYou idiot! My curse weakened that octopus, that\u2019s why you were able to hit it.\u201d\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t hit the headshot, we missed it, you idiot!\u201d\nOh my\u2026..\nI was going to do a Dungeon Detox, but the topic went away with the dungeon story.\nSurprisingly, Ash showed interest to this story.\n\u201cHoo, that\u2019s pretty cool. The Kraken is a tenacious guy that even I can\u2019t get rid of at once.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! Are you a Hunter, too?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\nAt the startled question of Joo Shinwoo, Ash shook his head. The twins made eye contact with each other and looked at Ash again.\n\u201cYou look pretty strong, though?\u201d\n\u201cRight, I think you\u2019re strong?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026. Huh, you guys seem pretty strong for humans, too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Joo Shinhee, and he is Joo Shinwoo. I\u2019m an archer and he\u2019s a wizard, but he\u2019s good in using dark curses.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great talent. Call me Ash.\u201d\nThey suddenly became friends?!\nThe twins and Ash chattered about other monsters. The dungeon talk continued actively.\nDungeon Detox, heuk\u2026.\nThe original planned Dungeon Detox was completely out of order, but \u2026 well, enjoy yourself anyway, that\u2019s fine.\nAnd as time passed, it was time for the guests to return.\n\u201cI almost forgot about this.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who rose from the chair, took something out of his pocket and held it out to me. When I received it, it was a small object with a single round button.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cUmh \u2026 should I say it\u2019s like a crime prevention bell? Rieul-ssi seems to be going through a lot of dangerous things.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI was panicked before when I was swallowed by the Monster Hell at the farm, but it ended well.\n\u201cKeep it and press it if something dangerous happens. I will come to help you.\u201d\n\u201cCan I try pressing it once?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nClick!\nI pressed the button, but it didn\u2019t make a loud sound or flash like a normal security bell. However, Ki Yoohyun smiled and said that it worked properly.\nIs there an app notification on his phone?\nFirst of all, I decided to accept it as his way of saying thank you. It\u2019s not a big deal so far,  but the number of customers in the store has increased significantly. I may need Ki Yoohyun\u2019s help when problems arise.\nStill, it\u2019s best not to have anything that makes me use it\u2026.\n***\n\u201cFufu, did you have fun today?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Not really.\u201d\n\u201cShall I ask them to come over next time?\u201d\n\u201cWell, whatever.\u201d\n\u201cAsh, you did a great job today. Good night.\u201d\nThe woman with a foolish face said so, then she closed the door and left. He was offended by the way she smiled every time she saw him.\nStill, he was able to successfully infiltrate this place as a part-timer.\nThe coffee she made was very tasty and his mana quickly recovered. What Ash particularly liked was the cafe mocha. The harmony between the bitter coffee taste and the Chocolate Sauce from Hell was fantastic.\nThanks to his steady drinking of the coffee she made, his mana has restored to some extent.\n[You are using Mana Saving Mode.][Mana recovery amount: 20%][Some spells may be unusable due to lack of mana.]\nNow he can easily kill that one woman as much as he wants to. He could even make her obey his orders through mind control.\nBut why?\nHe felt reluctant.\nAsh inadvertently put his hand on his forehead. It was the spot that Rieul had just stroked. There was still a subtle warmth.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nIf someone tells you college is fun, they\u2019re lying.\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c71": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nHe awakened at the age of 18.\nThe rare awakening of an A-class Healer, his young age, his status as the son of guild leader of the White Silver Guild, and his splendid appearance \u2026 all those factors made his awakening appeared on the headlines.\n\u201cWow, oppa, you\u2019re amazing!\u201d\nThe admiration of his two-year-old cousin, who often quarreled with him, was enough to excite the young Kwon Jiwoon.\n\nAfter awakening, because of the training and the interviews, time went by busily. Especially after he entered a dedicated training facility, he had little contact with the outside world.\nHe thought it didn\u2019t matter. His father trained him to the point where he felt a little impatient, and it was hard to catch up with the progress.\nHis younger sister was 16 at the time.\nKwon Jiwoon finally realized his position when an incident occured.\nSuspicious men attacked the house where they lived at the time, taking advantage of the absence of Kwon Jiwoon and his father, Kwon Seokmin. They were armed with illegal weapons that were not readily available, and they were thoroughly concealed their identities. Further investigations was unable to identify their backgrounds.\nIt wasn\u2019t a stalker or an accidental offense. It was clear that it was deliberately intended to kidnap Kwon Rieul.\nThe purpose, surely, is Kwon Jiwoon himself.\nThat day, Kwon Rieul had gone to their grandmother\u2019s house, probably because she\u2019s bored waiting for her family who rarely returned.\nWhat if Rieul didn\u2019t go to their grandmother\u2019s house and stayed home? Or what if she came home a little earlier?\nHe felt like he was losing his footing. The day before, he remembered talking about being close to his cousin without much thought.\nIt may not be directly related, but at that time, Kwon Jiwoon could not escape the idea that Kwon Rieul was almost in danger because of his words.\nAfter that, it wasn\u2019t long before his father went missing.\nAs he succeeded in his father\u2019s footsteps and took over the guild management, Kwon Jiwoon began to distance himself from Kwon Rieul. He sent his subordinates for security purpose, but just like with any other relatives, there were only a handful of direct contact between them.\n\u201cPlease take good care of Rieul.\u201d\n\u2026. but the idea that they should keep their distance has not changed even now.\nKwon Jiwoon eventually put his phone down from his hand and took a sip of coffee in the cup instead.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026it\u2019s bitter.\u201d\nSince it was left unattended for a long time, lukewarm coffee splashed his mouth.\nThe coffee that his sister gave him back then was delicious.\nKnock knock. The subordinate who came in after knocking handed out some documents.\n\u201cDeputy guild leader, these are documents related to next week\u2019s guild leaders meeting.\u201d\n\u201cI see \u2026 the guild leader of C&L will also come.\u201d\nOnly the boring stuff continues. Kwon Jiwoon sighed.\n***\nBeep, beep, beep\u2026.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not answering the phone\u2026.\u201d\nThe signal went on endlessly. I waited a little longer, but there was still no connection, so I put down my phone.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cHuh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nI shook my head at Ash\u2019s words and went back to the counter.\nThe person I just called is Kwon Jiwoon. The last time we met was when the dungeon broke out at the farm, I was concerned that I couldn\u2019t tell the story properly.\nHowever, as expected, the call I made with a big heart was not answered.\nHmm, he must be busy.\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s always been like this\u2026\u2019\nThere\u2019s nothing to be disappointed about because I didn\u2019t have any expectations.\nAnyway, it\u2019s been a few days since Ash started his part-time job at Cafe Rieul. There were still many customers, but the situation has stabilized a lot. At least every night before going to bed, I don\u2019t have to contemplate the meaning of life and work.\nHe was lying in front of the store when we first met, so I thought he was weak, but Ash did a really good job.\nFrom time to time\u2026.\n\u201cWhy should I, Asmodeus, the Demon King who brings twilight to the world, have to suffer such humiliation?\u201d\u201cKukh, if I regain my strength, I will wipe out all human beings.\u201d\u201cChocolate Sauce from Hell? No wonder it tastes good, it\u2019s an elegant and wonderful name.\u201d\nI\u2019m embarrassed by this eighth grade syndrome.\nWell, at that age, let\u2019s respect his worldview.\nI bent my knees, made eye contact with Ash, and smiled. I gently stroked Ash\u2019s hair while the boy was planning to wipe out humans with meteor using the sleeping power in his left arm.\n\u201cI see. Ash is awesome.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Cih!\u201d\nEven though I said nice things, Ash turned his head away with an angry expression.\n\u201cWaeooongg (You were wrong this time).\u201d\nWhy me?!\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyuuu!\u201d\nI interpreted Lime\u2019s words with the slime language translator that I had stuck in the drawer.\n\u2018Right, she\u2019s right.\u2019\nNo, why me?!\nUntil yesterday, you guys were attacking and bickering with each other, so why are you taking sides at times like this? Suddenly, I felt lonely\u2026.\nWell, let\u2019s get back to business.\n\u201cThe menu you ordered is here.\u201d\u201cHere, next order.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done organizing.\u201d\nThe hand moves without stopping. Although there was no smile and the words he said were short, he finished the work with accurate hand movements and quick actions.\nUgh, it\u2019s so dazzling. I can\u2019t look straight ahead.\nPerhaps Ash is the Light and Salt of the cafe part-timer world, and the savior of the single self-employed person.\n\u201cAsh, you\u2019re like an angel!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..! What do you mean\u2026\u2026! How could you say such an insult to Asmodeus!\u201d\nThat\u2019s his setting\u2026.\n\u201cAh, yes, I understand.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t answer half-heartedly.\u201d\n\u201cI apologize, Ash-nim.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmph!\u201d\nHe turned his head sullenly, but I saw the corners of his lips rising slightly.\nWhat an unfriendly, cute little guy.\n***\nIt was time to close the business after almost running out of the prepared ingredients for today.\n\u201cAsh, I\u2019ll make you a cafe mocha. Let\u2019s rest.\u201d\nNod. Instead of answering, Ash nodded his head and quickly sat down in front of the table. He hummed with his chin up, and when he caught me staring, his face reddened.\n\u201cWhat, wha-what are you listening to!\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Nothing?\u201d\n\u201cThen \u2026 forget it.\u201d\n\u201cHm, hmm, humm, next is heumm, right?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! As expected, you heard it! Go away!\u201d\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t need a cafe mocha?\u201d\n\u201cWhat \u2026 you\u2019ve already taken out the ingredients, so you can\u2019t throw them away.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, yes, yes.\u201d\nI handed him a cup of cafe mocha with plenty of Chocolate Sauce from Hell, which Ash called an elegant and wonderful name. The moment he took a sip, the bar of light filled up.\nHe really likes cafe mocha. He tried to drink it with a bad expression every time, but it was obvious.\nThe cafe door opened when Ash was almost done emptying his cup. The long-awaited guest came.\n\u201cAh, come on in.\u201d\n\u201cEonni, hello.\u201d\n\u201cHello, noo\u2501\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call her noona, you idiot!\u201d\n\u201cWhy only you can call her that, you idiot!\u201d\n\u201cI got permission from Eonni!\u201d\nThey were the twins, Joo Shinwoo and Joo Shinhee, and Ki Yoohyun.\nI heard that the twins recently went to a dungeon with high difficulty. What does someone need to do when they come back from a dungeon?\n\u201cMeong (What)?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Dungeon Detox.\u201d\n\u201cKyakyaoong (No, that\u2019s not it. The dungeon isn\u2019t even poisonous)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu!\u201d\nIt\u2019s poison. It\u2019s not good for your health.\nNot long ago, I got caught up in a dungeon again unintentionally, as someone with dungeon trauma and dungeon allergy, I\u2019m pretty sure about what I\u2019m talking about since I also have a recurrence of dungeon phobia.\n\u201cWaeoong\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKyuu\u2026.\u201d\nI could feel the cold gazes on the back of my head.\nThat\u2019s why, for Dungeon Detox, I closed the cafe a little earlier than usual and invited the twins.\nKi Yoohyun \u2026 well, I guess he just came with them as their guardian. Even if I don\u2019t invite him, he\u2019s a person who shows up very often.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe twins, who were about to enter and sit down, were startled when they found Ash. They looked at Ash with a cautious expression and widened their distance.\nAsh also looked at the twins with his signature cynical eyes.\nIs it because they\u2019re at the same age? They must be shy.\n\u201cThis is Ash, who has been working part-time here since last week. Ash, these are Hunter Joo Shinwoo and Joo Shinhee. Please be friendly to each other\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nNo, it wasn\u2019t that they\u2019re shy. It was actually like wild water beasts being wary of each other and measuring the opponents. The moment the fight seems to begin right away and the \u2197\u2192+[Attack] is about to fly.\nJoo Shinhee ran up to me and hugged my waist.\n\u201cWe\u2019re Eonni\u2019s closest friends!\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\nJo Shinwoo nodded a beat late.\n\u201cWe watched anime together. Did she also allow you to call her Eonni?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Cih.\u201d\nAsh, who turned his head with a sulky expression, added in a small voice. There was also a subtle, but not completely hidden, smirk on his face.\n\u201cI live with her.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cReally?!\u201d\nIt\u2019s true. Ash looked like he had nowhere else to sleep. When I hired him as a part-timer, I gave him a room on the back of the first floor.\nAs soon as I said yes, Ash and the twins started a nerve war over me again. Mieum, lying on her belly on the floor, added the observation review.\n\u201cWaeoooong (You\u2019re so popular with kids)!\u201d\n\u201cHa, haha\u2026..\u201d\nWith the kids circling around me, I felt like I have entered an illusion world of Hahaverse.\n\u2018All The Kids in My Store Like Me\u2019, something like that\u2026..?\n\u201cYou got a part-timer.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun slowly added more words.\n\u201cI also wanted to work part-time here. It\u2019s a pity I don\u2019t have the opportunity.\u201d\nNo, why are you interfering? Besides, how could I use a guild\u2019s Hunter as part-timer\u2026.\n\u201cAdults like you shouldn\u2019t be jealous of children.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Yes.\u201d\nAfter a long time, I was finally able to separate the twins and Ash and seat the guests in the table.\nInstead of coffee, I put a bunch of magic sugar, pots, baking soda, and other ingredients. on the table instead of coffee. There is also a gas burner and a spirit lamp.\nJoo Shinwoo asked with his eyes wide open.\n\u201cWhat are you making with this?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d\nSince the twins came to the cafe for the first time in a while, it would be better to try a new menu than the existing one. Dungeon detox requires special experience.\nAll of sudden, customers began to flock to the cafe, and there were quite a few new recipes. I haven\u2019t finished making it yet because I\u2019m exhausted every day after the cafe is closed.\nHuh, in a game, isn\u2019t there a section where the progress is suddenly fast? A section where the level goes up at once or items come in a lot. It feels like I\u2019m in that section.\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand.\u2019\nI glanced through the recipe list. Among the many new recipes, there happened to be a good one to enjoy together.\nIt\u2019s Dalgona Coffee.\nIn my life before the regression, there was a time when a recipe of the same name was popular. It was a recipe that added sugar and water to instant coffee and stirred it for a very long time.\n\u2018My hands really hurt\u2026\u2026.\u2019\nUnlike the usual coffee-making, the drink I will be making today has a recipe that requires me to break real dalgona into coffee. I was going to make dalgona for this coffee one by one. After all, it\u2019s fun to make dalgona.\nI placed a ladle and the spirit lamp in front of the twins, one at a time. Ki Yoohyun decided to help the twins because it could be dangerous.\nIn the past, when this place was my grandmother\u2019s store, I was scolded for burning a ladle while trying to make dalgona. After hitting me hard on the back, she told me that\u2019s not how to do it. It reminded me of that time.\n\u201cDo you want to try, too, Ash?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.it\u2019s fine.\u201d\nHowever, he replied bluntly as if he was not interested.\n\u201cReally? I have one ladle left, but there is no one to make it \u2026 Ash, can you help me?\u201d\n\u201cThen \u2026 it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\nAsh quickly picked up the ladle.\nReally, he\u2019s really an unfriendly and cute guy.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nLight and Salt (\ube5b\uacfc \uc18c\uae08): It is one of the parables that Jesus gave when teaching the Sermon on the Mount. It is taken from the phrases \u201cyou are the light of the world\u201d and \u201cyou are the salt of the earth.\u201d The meaning of this parable can be seen as living like the light that illuminates the dark world and the salt that purifies the corrupt world.\nDalgona is a Korean candy made with melted sugar and baking soda. It became popular again recently because of Squid Game.\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST!!!\n\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c70": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cIs there a reason why you want to work part-time here? There must be vacancy elsewhere.\u201d\nHowever, Ash shook his head with a firm expression.\n\u201cNo, there is no other place \u2026 nowhere.\u201d\nJust in time, thanks to Ash\u2019s quick touch, I can afford to take a break for a while. I made another cup of cafe mocha that Ash enjoyed yesterday, handed it to him, and spoke carefully.\n\n\u201cAsh, if you said that because you were sorry for me, you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\nAn anxious gaze reached me.\n\u201cYou were worried because I looked busy today. Ash is also kind.\u201d\n\u201cWho-who are you calling kind as you please! How could you say such a bad thing! Are you trying to insult the Demon King, Asmodeus, who summons the twilight of the world!\u201d\nUh, huh\u2026..? You must be embarrassed to be praised\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cI let you sleep here yesterday just because you looked unwell, not to make you work. You can stay here as long as you like, so don\u2019t worry about it, just relax. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, it\u2019s that\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cThat?\u201d\nAsh avoided my gaze with a sullen expression. What a sensitive age.\n\u201cCo.\u201d\n\u201cCo?\u201d\n\u201cCoffee\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAh, was it delicious? I\u2019ll make it again as much as you want.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, I want to do the part-time job.\u201d\n\u201cThe part-time job \u2026 once you have these documents, you can do it.\u201d\nAsh was determined to work part-time. I briefly wrote down the necessary documents on a piece of paper.\n\u201c\u2026.sheesh.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Ash! Where are you going?\u201d\nAsh, who grabbed the list of documents, got up and ran outside.\nDid I hurt his feelings? He\u2019s really in a difficult age\u2026.\n***\nWith a cold expression on his face, Ash was immersed in thought.\nCoffee is the source of mana recovery. In order to continue drinking this coffee, it was necessary to infiltrate the cafe without being doubted.\nThrough the downloaded knowledge of the human world, he came to the conclusion that he could infiltrate the cafe with a \u2018part-time job\u2019. The situation is perfect because this person is also looking for a part-timer. \nHowever, there was one unexpected difficulty.\nIt\u2019s the documents.\n\u201cThe part-time job \u2026 once you have these documents, you can do it.\u201d\nA feast of unfamiliar words.\n\u2018It\u2019s a lot different from a thousand years ago.\u2019\nThousands of years ago, if he just shot a meteor in moderation, humans would take care of him and gave him what he needed.\nHowever, due to the lack of mana, most of his magic was sealed. Ash went out to find another way to make the documents.\nAt that time.\n\u201cAaa, aaaah!\u201d\nOn the street, an old man saw Ash and collapsed while screaming. It\u2019s a man who was wearing a colorful vest over his skinny body.\nA terrified pale face, a trembling body. In addition to that, his eyes filled with joy and admiration.\n\u201cDo you know me?\u201d\n\u201cSe \u2026 se-serve, no way, are you the Demon King, Asmodeus-nim?\u201d\nHe nodded.\nThe old man gasped and prayed in a light motion.\n\u201cOoh, oh \u2026. ooh! Demon King Asmodeus\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cYou have good eyes.\u201d\nAsh, who was satisfied with the old man\u2019s worship, smiled.\n\u201cPlease! please \u2026 there is a place where my colleagues gathered. The Great Demon Lord needs a worshiper. Please accept our worship.\u201d\n\u201cNice.\u201d\nFinally, he met someone who treated him worthy of his power. Ash followed the old man.\nAsh didn\u2019t know, but this old man\u2019s true identity is the head of the cult of the Demon King, Twilight.  He has been waiting for the resurrection of the Demon King for a long time and has even tried the summoning himself.\nHowever, the summoning failed. No matter how much he waited, the Demon King did not resurrect and his colleagues left one by one.\nCurrently, his main activities are\u2026.\n\u2018The Demon King Really Exists\u2019\u2018Worship! The Demon King will be resurrected soon.\u2019\nIt was to put up illegal posters like this all over the streets.\nOnce a week, he waved a picket in front of a downtown subway station, grabbed the passersby. and asked, \u2018Do you believe in the Demon King?\u2019.\nHe already lost his followers to other similar religions, but\u2026.\nThe time of hardship is over. Hodl got the victory. Hodl won the war.\n\u201cI have a job for you.\u201d\n\u201cYo-you absolutely may ask anything.\u201d\nThe old man, who had worshiped the Demon King for a long time, instinctively noticed. He looks like a slender boy in shabby clothes, but this man is the Demon King he has been waiting for.\nThat cynical eyes and the cold voice. The strictness of giving orders out of the blue in front of the worshippers was certainly not from a fake.\nWhat is his first command? Making a living sacrifice? Or a curse on humanity? The blood of the Demon King worshipper? Maybe \u2026 is it the use of stakes of forbidden curse?\nHowever, the old man couldn\u2019t help but be flustered by the words that followed.\n\u201cMake documents for part-time jobs.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I will \u2026 yes?\u201d\n\u201cDid you not hear it? Documents.\u201d\n***\nIt was an hour after Ash ran out of the store when he heard he needed the documents.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, right?!\u201d\nAs soon as he returned, Ash put down the envelope containing the documents. I looked inside and there was everything I needed, including a health card.\nI looked carefully just in case, but it wasn\u2019t a forgery. The guardian\u2019s consent form contained the name of a child protection facility operated by a place called \u2018Religious Foundation Twilight\u2018.\nWhat\u2019s going on? There must be a reason why he wanted to work part-time here.\nName: Kim AshAge: 17\nThe name Ash, it was his real name\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\nIt was a situation where I had to find a part-timer anyway, and I was concerned about Ash\u2019s situation.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHe raised his head in surprise. The joy that he couldn\u2019t hide is revealed on his face.\n\u201cHoho \u2026 you will be swallowed up by the darkness.\u201d\nIt\u2019s good that he\u2019s happy\u2026.? Anyway, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I hope he can cheer up.\n\u201cPlease take good care of me in the future.\u201d\nTiling!\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Main Quest: Finding a Part-Timer\u2019.Please collect the reward.][Experience: 100 EXP have been acquired.][Fame: 10 / Popularity: 10 have been acquired.][<Cafe Rieul>\u2019s current Grade: E][Skill point owned: 1][Please choose a skill to level up.]\nAs soon as the quest completion notification sounded, the skill point came in.\nHmm, what skill should I raise\u2026.\nAfter much deliberation, this is the skill I chose.\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand.\u2019\nAs the business grew rapidly, the frequency of using this skill increased tremendously. Just as there was an amazing fraud effect when I leveled up \u2018The Floor is Shiny\u2018, I was expecting something good would happen if I level up this skill.\nCafe in My Hand (C)Details: (Lv. 2) When making drinks in the store, the level of perfection is higher.\n\u201cHeh?\u201d\nAt first, I didn\u2019t immediately notice what had changed. It just changed from \u2018level of perfection is increased\u2018 to \u2018level of perfection is higher\u2018.\nI\u2019ll experiment it a little later to see what the difference is\u2026..\nThen, the ringing sound rang again.\n[\u203b Cafe in My Hand (C) Level Up Effect: When you drink coffee, you won\u2019t get addicted to caffeine up to five cups.]\nWow, that\u2019s awesome.\n***\nAt the same time when Rieul was about to write an employment contract with a new part-timer.\nHer cousin, Kwon Jiwoon, was banging his head on the desk.\nBang!\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cDeputy guild leader, I just heard a loud noise, is there something wrong?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\nBang!\n\u201cDeputy guild leader?\u201d\n\u201cEhem, uhum, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon stood up awkwardly.\nThe reason why he is so troubled is, of course, his cousin. Kwon Rieul.\n\u201cOppa, I\u2019m awakened.\u201d\nRieul said that she had awakened. His cousin, who still seems pretty young. It was shocking at first, but Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s brain moved quickly.\n\u2018Then you should join the White Silver Guild.\u2019\nIt\u2019s a a matter of course. He\u2019s the deputy guild leader and his father, Kwon Seokmin who is currently missing, would surely agree.\nWhich guild you belong to is another proof of identity for a Hunter. The White Silver Guild is not a large guild, but it has a good location and is one of the important guilds in Korea. If they have Rieul as a member of the White Silver Guild, whatever she does in the future, the guild will be helpful for her.\nIt would be easier to fill out the application form electronically instead of on paper. He was thinking about the procedure in a rush, but Rieul cut his thoughts and drew a line.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never say that I want to join your guild, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nThe words weighed on his mind.\n\u201c\u2026.Haa.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon slid his eyes down. An empty phone text message writing window caught his eye. He wrote a few meaningless letters and erased them again. It\u2019s because he noticed a report on the recent trend of dungeon raids next to it.\nRecently, C&L Corporation\u2019s intervention in the raids conducted by the the White Silver Guild has been intensifying since a few weeks ago.\nEven if he tries to push through the principle, the opponent is the largest guild among The Big Three. There was no way to arbitrarily take away the contribution of the raid by pushing with the quantity.\nThe same thing happened in all three recent dungeon raids. This is obviously intentional.\nIn addition, C&L approached the guild member of the White Silver Guild and offered a transfer. The guild\u2019s main members remain the same, but some other members have already left.\nIf this is the case, it is clear that the power of the White Guild Silver will be weakened.\nC&L was trying to absorb the White Silver Guild.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how the hell I got so out of my mind.\u2019\nIn this situation, would it be the right choice to bring his younger sister to the White Silver Guild? The closer he gets to his younger sister, the more they will pay attention to her.\nFor a moment, Kwon Jiwoon looked into the old memories of the past.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner: \nHodl (\uc874\ubc84): a slang word that means \u2018to hold on to.\u2019 (in game, it also means \u2018to do nothing and just stay still.)\nThank you, Elena Murphy, for the coffee!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

I also made a lot of Lemon Chung. I went to Grandma Kim Deokyi\u2019s workshop and bought many take-out cups.\n\nWith this amount, there will be no problem running the store for a while.\nClothing OK, cleaning OK, machine setting OK. Well, everything is perfect. We\u2019re ready to reopen.\nIn the meantime, there has been one change in the store.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m preparing to open the cafe soon.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026hmm.\u201d\nHe has a sulky voice and a cynical expression. Children of this age are really sensitive.\nI found the boy collapsed at the shop door yesterday.\nLike Jina, why is everyone falling down in front of this store? Is this some kind of falling hot spot?\nAnyway, I brought the boy inside. He had a pale complexion with a very thin, frail body. In addition to his uncertain attitude about what had happened, he was reluctant to report to the police.\nWhy? What happened?\nAfter all the pitiful and sad talk, I decided to look into it a bit more tomorrow before deciding whether to report it or not.\nAnyway, it was already late at night, so I couldn\u2019t let such a vulnerable child out. What if he fall down again? For now, I decided to put the child to sleep in an empty room on the first floor.\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\nAn unexpected answer came back to the careful question.\n\u201cDo you think that a mere human can be qualified to call me by name?\u201d\nUh, huh\u2026?\nIs it something like his setting?\n\u201cIt looks like you don\u2019t want to talk about it. Still I can\u2019t just call you with hey, you \u2026. then I\u2019ll give you a temporary one.\u201d\nThe pale boy looked uneasy.\n\u201cWaeoooooong (I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nMieum and Lime\u2019s protests were ignored.\n\u201cWhat do you think about Bieup?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s face contorted. He poured out his next words in a low, quick tone.\n\u201cThe infinite evil seething from the the primordial chaos, the incarnation that shared the magical powers of the Abyss. What do you think of Asmodeus, the Demon King who brings twilight to the world! It\u2019s a name that humans can\u2019t pronounce recklessly!\u201d\nUh, huh\u2026? Twilight \u2026 what? \nIs this the 8th-grader syndrome that I\u2019ve only heard of? Is it like a black flame dragon on his left arm?\n\u201cYeah, since I can\u2019t pronounce it, you\u2019re Bieup.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nTingling. The boy stared at me and shuddered.\n\u201cMy name is Asmodeus.\u201d\n\u201cAsmo \u2026 what? It\u2019s too long.\u201d\n\u201cHaaa \u2026. cih, call me whatever you like.\u201d\nIn the end, I decided to call him Ash.\nIt wasn\u2019t his real name, no matter how I heard it. Since he\u2019s of a delicate and sensitive age, I have to adapt to his worldview.\n\u201cYes, the bathroom is over there. You have bandage on your left arm, are you hurt?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! Don\u2019t touch it. The bandage on this arm cannot be removed because the magic of the Abyss is asleep.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cThose who doesn\u2019t have the magical eye won\u2019t be able to see it. It is an incarnation imprint that connects me with the being in the Abyss.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI see. He\u2019s the real one. He has such a genuine cheeky expression and tone.\nYes, let\u2019s respect Ash\u2019s setting as an adult.\n\u201cUh \u2026 huh, if it\u2019s that important, I won\u2019t touch it.\u201d\n\u201cHaa \u2026 to be able to recognize the value of this imprint, you\u2019re quite good for a human being. You will be swallowed up by the darkness.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a compliment \u2026 is it?\nSo, after putting this unusual Ash to sleep, the next morning came.\nAfter a simple breakfast, I gave him a sweet cup of coffee and Ash drank it well. Although his expression was sulky as if it were not delicious, I was proud because the satisfaction bar above his head was honestly filling up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to open the cafe soon. You can stay as long as you want, so play comfortably with the kids in the back room.\u201d\n\u201cWaeooong (Do you think we are in charge of babysitting)!\u201d\nMieum protested as she straightened her tail.\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nThere\u2019s also a slime that agrees next to her.\nSeriously, what are you guys doing to a hurt sensitive child? Are you being territorial with a child because you\u2019ve been here for a long time?\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re similar in age, and you\u2019re perfect \u2026. ah, ouch!\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t avoid the meow punch flying from the front because I was concerned about Ash.\nMieum is eating well, I felt like her front feet are getting heavier.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026what are you doing?\u201d\nA cynical voice was heard again. Ash looked at me and the animals alternately with a gaze of looking at something pathetic.\n\u201cEhem, ehem. Then, Mieum-ah, Lime-ah, please take care of him.\u201d\n\u201cHumph.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..Kyaoong!\u201d\nAsh jerked Mieum\u2019s tail. Surprised, Mieum threw a meow punch, but Ash avoided it leisurely.\n\u201cKkyuu! Kkyuu!\u201d\nI don\u2019t know which side it\u2019s rooting for, but Lime is encouraging them from the side.\nSee, they\u2019re in sync.\n***\nAs soon as the cafe opened, which was notified in advance, customers rushed in.\n\u201cOne takeaway cafe latte, please.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have two iced Americanos. That\u2019s right, and please add a cafe mocha.\u201d\u201cOh, is it a new menu? Then, please give me an Einspanner.\u201d\nI was extremely busy taking orders, making drinks, and washing dishes.\nSave me\u2026..\nThe procession of customers never ends\u2026\u2026.\nWhere did my healing life after the regression, the one that was supposed to be a relaxed, lazy, and comfortable life, go?\nWhere the hell did the rumors about my coffee come from? \u00a0It\u2019s not like I was on a broadcast or did viral marketing.\nThe fact that I make the coffee through my skills seems still unknown, so there is nothing dangerous at the moment other than overwork.\n\u201cThis 255, 0, 0 vivid color, this size and the fluffiness! This cushion is so familiar \u2026  It must be the limited edition of Real Red Slime Large Cushion, it\u2019s pretty outdated custom production \u2026 where did you buy this cushion\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I bought it from Karrot.\u201d\nAt that time, Lime bounced and leaned on the soft cushion.\n\u201cKeuhuk! Sli-slime on the cushion I sent away with tears \u2026 the meeting of the Real Red Slime and Real Red Slime Cushion! It\u2019s an honor \u2026 can I take a picture\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nClick, click, click! She takes a lot of pictures of Lime, who\u2019s posing around as a model.\nLike her, there were slightly strange customers, but other than that, most were ordinary customers.\nAfter taking care of a flood of orders, I took a moment to post a part-time job recruitment notice at the door. I hope that I can find a part-timer as soon as possible so that I can get out of this busy situation.\nAlthough there are zero contacts so far\u2026\u2026.\nI don\u2019t know if Choi Yichan is doing well. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but he might as well give me a phone call.\nI didn\u2019t think of him just because I needed a part-timer. It\u2019s just \u2026 he stayed here for a few days and then disappeared, so this place felt a little empty.\nWhen I returned to the counter after posting the recruitment notice, Ash was taking orders from customers who had gathered in a short time.\n\u201cAsh, just rest. You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\nNo matter how busy I am, how can I make that frail child, whom I presumed to be a runaway teenager, work for me? Even when he\u2019s just sitting there, I felt like he was going to faint.\nThe reason I told Ash that it was okay to stay here today was purely from my heart.\nHowever, Ash skillfully received the pouring orders.\n\u201cTwo iced cafe lattes, one Einspanner, two vanilla lattes, and one cookie set. They came in like this.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait, how much is it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c15 rubies.\u201d\nEach time I made a drink, he served it quickly, and even cleaning the table perfectly.\n\u201cUgh!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just blinding me for a moment.\u201d\nWhat is this incredible ability\u2026\u2026.\nWith his cynical expression and a slender figure, it\u2019s unimaginably fast and perfect movement. In an instant, the delayed orders were processed and the store was cleared.\nHe shook off his hand and asked suddenly.\n\u201cAre you looking for a part-timer? What should I do to do that?\u201d\nTiling!\n[A quest has occurred.]\n[Main Quest: Finding a Part-TimerThe customers are rushing in like the tide. You can\u2019t handle this popularity alone!You need help.Hiring part-timer: 0/1Rewards: Experience (100 EXP), Fame (10), Popularity (10), Skill Point 1]\nAs soon as Ash spoke, a new quest appeared.\nI looked at Ash again. With a small and slender body, he has a cynical expression on his face, but the cheeks that gives off a youthful appearance caught my eye.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cPart-time jobs are only available for people over 15 years old.\u201d\nAsh replied indifferently to the words I had said.\n\u201cHow old do you think I am? I\u2019m not that young.\u201d\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t counted properly since I was 2000.\u201d\nAh, that\u2019s his setting\u2026.\n\u201cFail.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201c65 is the retirement age.\u201d\nAt the playful addition, Ash hesitated for a moment and murmured.\n\u201cI\u2019m 17 years old.\u201d\nHe appeared to be under 15 on the outside, but he was older than I thought.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\na black flame dragon on his left arm (\uc67c\ud314\uc758 \ud751\uc5fc\ub8e1) actual meaning: Ch\u016bniby\u014d.

The main characters in the story are experiencing chunibyo, a mocking term for immature behavior of young teenagers in which they act out grand delusions, or pretend that they have magical powers such as those of anime characters. Ch\u016bniby\u014d (sometimes also spelled \u2018chuunibyou\u2019), is literally translated as \u201cmiddle 2 syndrome\u201d (middle [school] second [year] syndrome), which also goes by the short form \u2018chu2\u2019, and is often translated to English as \u201ceight-grader syndrome\u201d. Despite the name, it can manifest in people\u00a0of all ages. \nAnd yes, I copy-paste those explanations from fandom wiki. I actually wanted to just write it as \u2018 chunibyo\u2019 since a lot of you guys must have been already familiar with the term, but I ended up using black dragon in case you read some korean in the future and got confused when a sudden \u2018black dragon\u2019 appeared out of nowhere.\n\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

It was a black, large hand that could not even be considered a human.\nThe hand grabbed the interpreter\u2019s body with strength.\nCrack! The interpreter died with a chilling, unpleasant sound.\n\u201cUgh\u2026..\u201d\n\nA suppressed scream came out.\nThe Long-tailed Phoenix is \u200b\u200bnot an ordinary monster, it is also called a Holy Beast that deals with the light attribute ether.\nHowever, the box contained that large hands with grotesquely grown nails, and even the dark ether leaked out thickly from it.\nAt that moment everyone noticed. There is no way that such an ominous thing could be the Holy Beast, the Long-tailed Phoenix.\nSo \u2026 what the hell is that monster?\n\u201cHuaagh!\u201d\nSwish!\nThe box was completely smashed and the monster jumped out. With agility that did not match its huge body, the monster began to attack the fleeing humans. Long fingernails and teeth tore the humans to pieces.\n\u201cUu-ugh\u2026.\u201d\nJijon\u2019s legs, who were trying to run away, lost their strength. Blood has already poured from the wounds scratched by the monster\u2019s claws. The monster who tore off the man who offered Jijon a cigarette a while ago turned its head towards him.\nIt\u2019s coming up to his position.\nHis head is numb, Jijon thought a question as he felt the blood pouring from his body. Was he going to die like this after all?\nIt\u2019s a death befitting an extra. Had he known that he was going to die here, he would have contacted his mother and sister. He closed his eyes and prepared for death.\nThen, someone jumped forward with a sword.\nIt was Choi Cedric, who was disguised as a bodyguard. Choi Cedric swung his long sword lightly to block the monster\u2019s attack.\nKlang!\nThe monster who lost the power battle took a few steps back.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yes, yes\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell is this \u2026. hang in there.\u201d\nWhy is Choi Cedric here?\nThe appearance of Choi Cedric, who confronted the monster with his sword, was hopelessly cool.\nHe looked so different from himself, who came to this point by repeatedly making bad choices and was about to die while helping illegal things.\nChoi Cedric is strong. Unlike Jijon who could not even set foot in the Hunter\u2019s World, he\u2019s the signature Hunter of C&L, currently ranked second in the Rankings, and an S-class.\nA guy like that wouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about, and a guy like him wouldn\u2019t be able to understand.\nRather than being grateful for being saved, the sense of inferiority that he had swallowed raised its head.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nAt that time, the monster who tried to attack Choi Cedric ran away, as if it decided that it was hard to win over him.\n\u201cStay there!\u201d\nChoi Cedric tried to chase after the monster, but he stopped when he saw that Jijon\u2019s wound was severe.\nThe order he received from CEO Lee Sein was to disguise himself as a bodyguard and steal the box that was going to be traded today.\nIt\u2019s just his own speculation, but she may be thinking of fabricating this event as the work of the White Silver Guild.\n\u201cThen the trader who paid for it wouldn\u2019t sit still, what would you do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about others.\u201d\nIt was a strange way of speaking.\nFor some reason, it felt like she knew they\u2019re going to die by that monster\u2026.\nAccording to Lee Sein, he should leave the wounded alone and chase the monster\u2026\u2026\nThe wounds are severe even by the looks of it. At this rate, he\u2019ll die in no time. The hesitation was brief. Choi Cedric gave up his pursuit and approached Jijon.\n\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019ll at least use a potion.\u201d\nHe searched his inventory and pulled out a high-quality potion at random.\n\u201cThat\u2019s expensive\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIs the price important now?\u201d\nAs he poured the potion into the wound, he suddenly saw the injured man\u2019s face. Those stubborn eyes and sulky expression, somehow he\u2019s familiar with it.\n\u201cEh, have we seen each other before?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026you\u2019ve got the wrong person.\u201d\nJijon bowed his head obliquely and avoided his gaze. However, Choi Cedric\u2019s gaze was persistent.\n\u201cNo, I definitely saw you! This guy, you\u2019re lying because you\u2019re afraid to be a criminal. Obviously before, so \u2026 Ah.\u201d\nChoi Cedric swallowed a sigh. He remembered where he saw Jijon.\nIn the C&L guild headquarters, in front of the elevator dedicated to the guild members. They belong to the same guild, but why is a Hunter from C&L here?\nDidn\u2019t she certainly say that she wouldn\u2019t put the members of their guild in danger?\n\u2018Noona, what on earth \u2026 what are you doing behind my back?\u2019\nChoi Cedric\u2019s face was contorted.\n***\n[Lack of mana due to incomplete summoning.][Charge your mana. In case of mana depletion, the body cannot be maintained.]\nThe black thing protruding from the box ran down the street with its heavy body.\nHowever, the pace was only getting slower.\nIts stomach was hot as if it had swallowed a fire, and the desire for destruction rose. It wanted to pour out all its magic and devour the surroundings.\nThe black energy that enveloped its body gradually weakened. The body, which had run out of mana, was now having a hard time moving.\n[\u203b Caution: Your mana is extremely insufficient.]\nOriginally, it was in a deep sleep. The sleep waiting for the promised day was comfortable and sweet.\nHowever, the humans forced it to wake  up.

It was in front of Cafe Rieul.\nAnd at that time, Rieul, who was roasting coffee beans, heard a thump.\n\u201cHey, are you all right?\u201d\nWhen the boy woke up, there was a woman with a puzzled face in front of him. The woman looked at the boy with a worried expression and said,\n\u201cYou were lying down in front of this place. Are you sick?\u201d\nThe boy blinked slowly.\nHe felt a sense of discomfort in his body. His eyes were low enough to require him to look up at the woman, and his limbs were small and slender.\nDue to the depletion of mana, it was only possible to create such a small and poor body.\n\u201c\u2026.Cih.\u201d\nThe boy moved his eyes and looked around. There was a woman with no sense of crisis in front of him, and the surroundings looked like a cafe.\n\u201cUmh, you don\u2019t have a fever\u2026.\u201d\nThe woman reached out and touched the boy\u2019s forehead.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nIt\u2019s unpleasant.\nTak. The boy immediately struck off the hand and tried to kill the woman with his magic.

The boy who had judged that way, muttered in a weak voice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m sick, I\u2019m just dizzy for a second\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nIt was a faint voice and pitiful eyes that aroused sympathy. The woman jumped to her feet.\n\u201cI should report it to the police.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026No police!\u201d\nIt was bothersome to get involved with more humans.\n\u201cWhy? The policeman will take you home.\u201d\n\u201cHome \u2026 I don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d\nThe woman nodded slowly as she accepted the words.\n\u201cSit here and wait a minute.\u201d\nFor a moment, he could hear a rattling sound, and then a white porcelain cup was pushed in front of him.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nThrough the downloaded human world knowledge, he could see that it was called \u2018coffee\u2018, specifically \u2018cafe mocha\u2018.\nThe liquid in the glass is black. Why are you asking me to drink this? He pushed the cup away, but the woman held it firmly to the boy.\n\u201cYour body will warm up. Hurry up and drink it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Okay.\u201d\nIt would be better to obey her words here. With a reluctant expression on his face, the boy tilted his cup.\nThe sweet taste flowed into his mouth first. Then, the heavy taste of espresso, which supports the sweetness, and the savory taste of milk.\nIt was incredibly delicious.\nNot only that\u2026\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nHis mana has been restored.\nIt\u2019s only a little, but he could feel a little bit of magic power filling in his body. That can\u2019t be true.\nThe boy took another sip of the cafe mocha. It didn\u2019t come close to the powerful mana he originally had, but he definitely gained power.\nThe boy hastily emptied the remaining cafe mocha.\n\u201cUh-huh\u2026.\u201d\nWhen the boy emptied his cup, the woman glanced over the boy\u2019s head and looked proud.\nHe didn\u2019t like it.\nHe didn\u2019t feel any special power from her. Nevertheless, the power of coffee given by this stupid woman was undeniable.\nIf he recovers his mana, he can kill such a woman in no time. If he can get his original body back, he will wipe out all the humans who woke him up.\nTo do that, he has to somehow find a way to drink more of this coffee.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThe boy was lost in thought.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslation\u2019s Corner:\nI accidentaly drank expired milk and it didn\u2019t end well T__T\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

When Mieum is watching a television drama while tapping on her belly, it bounces around on its own, bouncing its small body.\n\nFrom inside of the store to the surroundings of the Yggdrasil and to the corners of the space, it roams freely, and it occasionally makes a kyuu sound as if it was talking to itself.\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyuuuu.\u201d\nI\u2019m curious. What does that kyuus mean?\nIn such a situation, while looking for a way to communicate with slimes, I came across a video by chance. It\u2019s a famous video that has been on the main screen of YouTube for a while.\nOn the screen, a green slime bounces its smooth and soft body.\n\u2501 Kyuuu, pi! Kyuuuu!\nA cheerful cry is heard. The videographer pointed a small machine with a black-and-white liquid crystal at the Green Slime.\nKyuu, kyuuu, pi!\nThe light flashes as the machine recognizes the sound. After a while, a string appeared on the screen.\n\u2018I feel good. I like it.\u2019\n\u2501 Kyuuuuuu!\nAgain, the machine recognized the slime\u2019s cries without missing a beat.\n\u2018I\u2019m a slime. I like clean water.\u2019\nThis is an introduction video of a slime language translator that has become a hot topic.\nThe high-performance interpreter artifact, which can also interprete the slime language, was too expensive to buy even if I sold the whole store, but maybe I can buy this language translator!\nI thought so and searched, but I soon ran into a wall.\n[GIFT] AI Portable Slime Language Translator SlimeTALK\u2605It\u2019s temporarily out of stock.We\u2019ll send you a notification when it\u2019s in stock. [Subscribe for notifications]\nThey didn\u2019t sell this slime language translator anywhere.\nIt turned out that they produced only a small amount for a pre-release and sold it for a limited time, but the company went bankrupt before starting the general sales. With the recent popularity of slime, many people are looking for it, but there are no items left for sale.\nThere was no choice but to hang a keyword notification on the Karrot market, which is a trending platform among Hunters, and wait.\nIt was difficult to obtain because only a few hundred were produced, but blessed are those who wait!\nAs time went by, the Karrot notification alarm finally rang. I made an appointment to meet and make the deal right away.\n\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go buy the slime language translator.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, waeooong.\u201d\nUnexpectedly, Mieum showed a negative reaction. Before, she said it\u2019s better not to know what Lime said. What\u2019s the secret of Lime\u2019s kyuu sound?\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s good not to know, waeoong!\u201d\n\u201cThen Mieum can translate it for me.\u201d\nMieum said that she does not exactly understand Lime\u2019s words. Instead, by reading the wavelength of the slime\u2019s cries, the vague meaning can be grasped. I told her that she can just tell me the meaning, but Mieum firmly did not translate it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go. It\u2019s for your own good, kyaoooo!\u201d\n\u201cI already made an appointment on Karrot. I\u2019ll be back!\u201d\nAnd at the meeting place.\nThe other person appeared with a large bag, as if he had several Karrot appointments.\n\u201cSlime Language Translator SlimeTALK\u2605, is this right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d\nHe rummaged through his bag. There were only slime goods in the bag, such as large slime cushions, slime figures, slime glasses cleaner, and slime humidifiers.\nYou must really like slime\u2026..\n\u201cHere you are. As the bonus, I\u2019ll also give you a slime cushion, a slime can badge, and a slime random figure box.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nThe one I bought was a palm-sized machine, but the bonuses were bigger.\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to give me this much\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We still have 20 more of the same ones, so feel free to take them.\u201d\nHis shoulders droop with a deep sigh.\nAfter listening to his story, I heard that there was no more space in the container because people around him bought dozens of the same goods. The warehouse was already full and things invaded the room. It only leaves a place to lie down, so when he tried to fall asleep, he\u2019s forced to make eye-contact with the large slime figures.\nIf that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s nothing I can do\u2026.\nAnyway, I returned to the store with the language translator and the large slime cushion that I received as a bonus.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this, waeoong!\u201d\n\u201cKyuu!\u201d\nI threw the cushion to Mieum, who liked the soft texture, and immediately turned on the language translator.\n\u201cLime-ah, tell me something.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyuuuuu!\u201d\nThe light on the slime language translator flickered and the screen soon turned on.\nMy heart is pounding \u2026 what did it say?\n\u2501 The incarnation of\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will soon awaken. The dark ether has reached its critical point.\nHuh? It was a difficult text that could not be guessed from that cute appearance and the cute cries. It seemed like a warning that something big would happen in the future.\n\u201cLime-ah, what did you just mean? Can you please say it again?\u201d\n\u201cKkyu \u2026\u2026 kkyuu, kkyuuu, kkyuu!\u201d\n\u2501 3.14159265358979\u2026\u2026.\nHuh? Is it an error? Why does the circumference rate appear?\nI rocked the machine up and down. Then, the letters on the screen disappeared again. Well, there must have been a brief error. Yeah, it\u2019s Lime\u2019s kyuu sound, why would a circumference rate comes up?\n\u201cKkyuuuus! Kkyuuu, kkyu!\u201d\n\u2501 Ac, Th, Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es\u2026\u2026.\nMom, it\u2019s saying weird things\u2026\u2026.\nLime, you\u2019re a science slime.\n\u201cDo you now understand the pain I went through, human! Waeooong!\u201d\nI tried a few more times, but only the scientific knowledge without context was listed, and it didn\u2019t tell me what I was curious about.\nI gave up and decided to put the slime language translator in a safe drawer. As expected, communication with this slime was too difficult for me.\n***\nWhen darkness fell, in an abandoned house near the Dungeon Gate.\nJijon looked around with a nervous expression.\n\u2018Why did this happen?\u2019\n\u2018Where did it go wrong\u2026.\u2019\nHe lamented inside, but it was too late.\nAround Jijon, there was a group of people waiting while smoking cigarettes. They have loud voices and rough attitudes, they were engaged in a job that was not good to look at, even the equipment worn over their bodies. They giggled while bragging about trivial things, but if you look closely, you can feel the tension that cannot be hidden from their faces. They\u2019re just pretending to be calm and bluffing.\nOne of them approached Jijon and held out a pack of cigarettes.\n\u201cHave a smoke too, hyung.\u201d\n\u201cI quit smoking.\u201d\n\u201cGosh, you\u2019re a poison.\u201d\nHuk. He spit cigarette smoke at his face. He patted him on the shoulder and continued his words, ignoring the frown on Jijon\u2019s face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing this once or twice.\u201d\nIt seemed that the man was trying to convince himself rather than encouraging Jijon. The words continued.\n\u201cWe all heard who was behind us. It\u2019s C&L! The C&L! I heard that a high-ranking person in C&L takes care of us directly. Hyung is already a member of our Neo-Crown, so please don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nThrowing burnt cigarette butts on the floor, the man glanced back at him. The moment the large wooden box caught his eye, his fingertips trembled slightly.\nThe cause of this strange tension is that big box. A sealed box containing the long-tailed Phoenix, a rare monster that can only be found in a special environment.\nThe group around Jijon are the guild members of Neo-Crown Party. Their purpose today is to hand over this rare monster to a trading partner at a high price.\nHowever, this box gave off a strange atmosphere.\nEven though it was just a box, he can feel an indescribable sinister and unpleasant aura from the box. Is there really a long-tailed Phoenix in it? It looks like there\u2019s something much scarier in it.\nThe sealing of the box is perfect. The monster must have fallen into a deep sleep.\nNevertheless, he was afraid.\nDamn, he shouldn\u2019t have accepted this either.\nJijon poured out a sigh inside. He should have turned down Lee Sein\u2019s offer at that time. No, even if he was arrested for being framed of murder, he should have reported it then.\n\u201cIf you just take care of this, I will take responsibility for the rest.\u201d\nBelieving the secretary\u2019s words, Jijon came to this place today.\nStill, that must be a lie. If this goes wrong, they\u2019ll put all the blame only on himself somehow.\nIt felt like an invisible rope was squeezing his throat.\n\u201cKek\u2026.\u201d\nIt\u2019s already late.\n\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\nAcross the darkened Dungeon Gate, the trading partner appeared.\nThe partner was a foreigner. Even though it was night, he covered his eyes with sunglasses, and accompanied by an interpreter and a Hunter who appeared to be a bodyguard.\nAlthough his nationality and identity were unknown, he offered a large sum of money. They don\u2019t care about the other person\u2019s identity. The Neo-Crown Party simply wanted to hand over this ominous box quickly.\nThe trading partner muttered something, and the interpreter next to him delivered his words.\n\u201cHe wants to check the item. Please open the box.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThe wandering gazes were crossed. No one wanted to open that box.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there something wrong with the item?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, how can you doubt us like that!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that we don\u2019t trade based on trust alone? We can\u2019t trade until we check the item.\u201d\n\u201cCk, I understand.\u201d\nIt was still an unwilling response. The leader of the Neo-Crown Party spoke, pointing to one person.\n\u201cHey, you go open it.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2026 you mean me?\u201d\n\u201cThen, do you mean I should open it by myself!\u201d\nIn the end, the best runner approached the box. It was the moment whenhe  inserted the key into the lock and tried to turn it around.\nThud!\n\u201cAa-aaahhh!\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you making a fuss?\u201d\nEven such a reproachful voice trembled slightly at the end.\n\u201cHyung, there is a strange sound inside!\u201d\nThump, Thump, Thump!\nThe dull vibration gradually grew stronger.\n\u201cI heard you guys are the notorious Neo-Crown Party, but you all are terrified of this thing.\u201d\nPick, the interpreter who ridiculed them stepped forward and tried to open the unlocked box.\n\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you just stop\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? It must have been sealed\u2026.\u201d\nPuck!\nThe interpreter could not even finish speaking.\nThe box split vertically, and a black hand popped out of it.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nMY HUNCH IN PREVIOUS CHAPTERS IS RIIIGHT. IT\u2019S REALLY NEO-CROWN PARTY!!!\nThey used proper spacing in this chapter, and the world used is \ud30c, means faction; party (or can also be mean as \u2018clan\u2019).

Mieum\u2019s words continued regardless of my reaction.\n\u201cIyaooong (That\u2019s a lot going on \u2026 that must affect his mental faculties as well).\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you \u2026 ah, don\u2019t tell me\u2026.\u201d\nSuddenly, I remembered what Mieum had said before. She said that if you sympathize too much with the Great Old One, you may lose your original self.\n\u201cDoes that mean Yoohyun-ssi signed a contract with a Great Old One?\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong, meooong (Yeah, that\u2019s quite \u2026 no? Oh my oh my goodness \u2026 This is amazing)\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cMieum-ah?\u201d\n\u201cNyaaaah (That\u2019s weird. It is different from the arrangement of \u2588\u2588. How come at this point \u2026 Don\u2019t tell me \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is)\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n[Warning: Abnormal Approach][System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\nMieum-ah, an error window popped up because of you\u2026,\nI turned my head away from Mieum, who was talking to herself, and looked over Ki Yoohyun\u2019s head again. The satisfaction gauge is still about 98% full.\n\u201cHe hardly can taste it, but the coffee is still delicious, right?\u201d\n\u201cKiyaoong (Of course! What do you think your skills are)!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Coffee making skills?\u201d\n\u201cKyaoooog (Coffee made with the skill that reduces the effect of assimilation. In other words)\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cIn other words?\u201d\n\u201cMeooong (He can taste the coffee)!\u201d\nAt that time, I felt my cheeks sting and turned my head. Ki Yoohyun alternately looked at me and Mieum, who suddenly cried. I almost became a weird person who\u2019s talking to a cat.\n\u201cEhem, hmm. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I was just trying to say that every time I drink the coffee made by Rieul-ssi, I feel warm.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nLet\u2019s imagine.\nRegardless of the cause, he\u2019s unable to sense taste.\nNo matter how much he eats delicious food in the world, such as chicken, pizza, and famous hotel buffet that just got delivered, it would only feel like a lump of soft food for him. A situation in which one eats for nutrition, but does not feel the joy of eating at all.\nFor me, it\u2019s a tragedy that can destroy humanity.\nBut when he drinks the coffee here, it tastes good. Just like a paint that was painted on only one place in the achromatic world, he can only felt the bitterness, savory, and sweet sensations in this coffee.\nI\u2019m so sorry to hear that\u2026..\nNo wonder he wants to drink the coffee I made every day. That must have been the reason why he showed his face often these days. Yeah, it wasn\u2019t because he had any other meaning, it was purely because the coffee was delicious.\nRegrettably,\u00a0I told Ki Yoohyun that he could come for coffee anytime.\nThen, my phone vibrated.\nWhen I checked the notification, I jumped up.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThe call I have been waiting for has arrived.\u201d\nThat\u2019s good. I couldn\u2019t open the cafe tomorrow because I didn\u2019t have any coffee beans. I can take care of my other business at this chance.\nI posted a sign on the front of the door saying, \u201cWe are closed today because we\u2019re out of ingredients.\u201d\n***\nThe large conference room was empty.\nIn the dim place where the lights went out, there was one person sitting unnoticed. She was a quiet woman with long hair up to her waist and wearing a pair of glasses.\nHer name is Ju Noeul.\nShe put her hand on her forehead and sighed.\n\u201cHaaaaa\u2026..\u201d\nTiling! Then, her phone rang. Ju Noeul hastily checked her KakaoTalk.\n[ <Cheongna Guild> \u2013 Hunter Han Yiseong]Hunter Ju Noeul. I\u2019m sorry for the late reply!I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to attend today\u2019s Hunter Association meeting.It\u2019s a pity that I have to have a meal together after meeting with a senior Hunter \u3160\u3160I will definitely treat you to a meal next time.\nIn summary, he wrote a long greeting, but he eventually missed the meeting.\nHan Yiseong, who sent her a reply, is a gentleman. That unfortunate CEO of C&L didn\u2019t even read her message at all.\nNoeul closed the KakaoTalk window and murmured.\n\u201cThese people are so mean\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nKorea Hunter Association. An autonomous organization that protects the rights and interests of each private guild in Korea and promotes the development of the Hunter World through exchanges.\n\u2026. that\u2019s what written on the website.\nHowever, not many Hunters are aware of the existence of this Hunter Association.\n\u2018That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t have anything to do\u2026.\u2019\nSince most of the Hunter-related tasks are exclusively handled by the Dungeon Management Office, the role of the Hunter Association has been greatly reduced. The Hunters who knew about the Association also didn\u2019t pay any attention to it was contributed to the reason as well. Most of them are even asking what this is when the Association send a notice reminding them to pay their membership fee.\nHowever, even an Association in name only needs to operate.\nShe has no luck. Ju Noeul took over the position of the President of the Association this quarter because her name was caught in the lottery.\nToday is the monthly regular meeting of the Korea Hunter Association. Still, no one came, either. Goodness, the humanity these days\u2026.\n\u2018Whatever, I don\u2019t know anymore\u2026.\u2019\nLet\u2019s kill time and go.\nJu Noeul leaned against the chair and connected to the Hunter Channel with her phone. Then, as she looked through the new posts, she diligently commented on the slime-related post.\nJu Noeul, 29 years old. An S-class summoner. She is the guild leader of the Royal Guild, one of The Big Three guilds.\nHer Hunter Channel\u2019s nickname is Lime Love Team.\nThe activity of checking out the new posts on the Hunter channel quickly ended. This is because Ju Noeul was a community addict who spent most of her day on the Hunter Channel.\n\u2018I\u2019m thinking about going to that cafe\u2026.\u2019\nJu Noeul recalled what happened a few days ago.\nThat day too, Ju Noeul was browsing the Hunter Channel in the guild room. However, all the text was already gray.\nShe was baited by a viral post written by a Hunter Channel\u2019s Gonick, and went there for fun.\nA unique cafe near the Dungeon Gate of the Great Dungeon Abyss. The coffee was delicious and had a strange effect, but above all\u2026.\nIt was the red slime that caught her eyes.\nIt has pure red color, not cloudy or mixed with other colors. A real red, which is rare in the slime world where grades are divided by subtle color differences. She wanted to touch it just once.\nShe had never seen such a slime in her long slime life.\nThe conference room is still empty.\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll go\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nHowever, Ju Noeul was in despair 30 minutes later.\n\u2501 We are closed today because we\u2019re out of ingredients. \u2501\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much\u2026.\u201d\nShe cleansed her eyes and looked again, but the contents of the paper attached to the door did not change. The cafe, which quickly became popular in a matter of days, had already been closed.\n\u201cI want to see the rare slime\u2026.\u201d\nJust as she fell down on her knees in despair, her phone got a call. It was from a guild member of the Royal Guild.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u2026..\u201d\n\u2501 Guild leader, I put all the items in the guild leader\u2019s office on Karrot, so please know that.\n\u201cWhat! Don\u2019t you know what those things are\u2026.\u201d\n\u2501 What those things are? It\u2019s all junk. Why did you buy multiple slime cushions in the same color? I\u2019m selling all but one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same color, but if you look closely, there is a difference between (255, 0, 0) and (192, 0, 0)\u2026.\u201d\n\u2501 What\u2019s the difference between that one and that one\u2026.\n\u201cAh, no! I\u2019ll clean up the guild leader\u2019s office by myself, so please take a look at it.\u2026.\u201d\n\u2501 You said the same thing last week. No.\n\u201cHow can you do this to your family\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u2501 I don\u2019t have a family like the guild leader!\nThe Royal Guild is widely known as a family guild in the Hunter World.\nHowever, the guild members have different surnames, and the guild are mainly composed of young Hunters of similar ages. Therefore, there have been rumors circulated that the \u201cfamily\u201d means not blood ties, but things like gangsters or mafia.\n\u2018It\u2019s an outrageous rumor\u2026.\u2019\nThe reality is simpler \u2026 it wasn\u2019t much.\n7 years ago, at a pension in Gangneung, Gangwon Province. A official meeting of the Man-game Club \u201cOnly You Fold the Bitter Server Termination\u201d was held. Ju Noeul was the organizer of the meetup.\nHowever, at that time, a rift broke out in the valley near the pension. It ended fine because the meetup participants, who were caught in the rift, awakened as a group and stopped the rift together.\nThe problem was a broadcast interview that came to cover the heroes of Gangneung.\n\u2501 Well, what kind of relationship you guys have?\nThey have different places of residence, different ages, different schools, and different occupations. The curious reporter\u2019s eyes directed at them. Ju Noeul, who had a temperament, felt that it was too much to answer with, \u2018It\u2019s a club meetup of the man-game Only You Fold the Bitter Server Termination\u2018. It\u2019s too much for an answer \u2026 she was embarrassed.\nYes, online family is also a family.\nThe value of cyber kinship is comparable to a real family!\nJu Noeul, who made such a sudden move, proudly declared.\n\u2501 We\u2019re a family\u2026\u2026.\nThe name was changed to Royal Guild in response to the opposition that they would not join even if they died if she named it \u2018Only You Fold the Bitter Server Termination\u2018.\nAs it is, she established a guild with precious cyber blood relatives and worked hard enough to be considered one of the Big Three guilds.\nHowever, seven years was cruel. Seven years is long enough time for a person to quit being a fanatic.\n\u201cGuild leader, I\u2019m done with that man-game.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too much\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m old and tired now, and I don\u2019t have the strength to be a fan.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the pledge of the day to collect the Platinum Royal Gorgeous Teacup Set and reclaim the first place from the server\u2019s No. 1 user \u2018R\u2019\u2026..\u201d\u201cGuild leader, stop playing such Man-game and play this God-game. If you pre-register now, you\u2019ll get an item.\u201d\u201c\u2026.traitor!\u201d\nShe made a cozy otaku guild, but when she came to her senses, she was the only one who was a maniac and the others were already left the field.\nFurthermore, she heard the news of the server termination after that.\nFor several months, she wandered around as a mental vagabond in the sorrow of losing her home. Then, Ju Noeul had a fan accident again.\nIt\u2019s to be a fan of slime!\nFinally, she became an ultimate fangirl. Now, she thought that the only thing left in her fangirl life is to walk on the flower road, but she faced something that was too harsh even for the hardships of life. Selling her precious goods on Karrot is too cruel!\nOf course, she was also too much for filling the guild building with fan merchandise.\nShe bought three of the same goods for actual use, storage, and promotion, and then put them in the guild\u2019s common warehouse. She tried to put up a rainbow-colored giant slime statue at the entrance of the guild, but it was rejected\u2026.\nJu Noeul, who had been stabbed a lot, muttered pitifully.\n\u201cOnce a family, forever a family. An online family is also a family\u2026..\u201d\n\u2501 Ah, I already got a call from Karrot. I\u2019m hanging up.\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t\u2026!\u201d\nThe phone call was cut off before she finished speaking, and Ju Noeul was left in despair again.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nGonick (\uace0\ub2c9): A term used to refer to people who always use the same nickname at internet forum. The one who started the viral post about Rieul\u2019s cafe is HingHangHong and their username is always the same. (If you notice it, some user always change their username, for example the one with \u2018Golem\u2019 in their username).\nKarrots (\ub2f9\uadfc\ub9c8\ucf13) is a popular C2C (customer to customer) platform to buy and sell new or secondhand items. \nMan-game, i\u2019m not sure what the exact translation is but the real word is \ub2f9\uadfc (man-gem): (literally) a messed up game.  It is a combination of the Chinese character \u4ea1 (mang) means dying and the abbreviation for game, \uac9c. Man-game refers to a game that is in the process of being destroyed or has already been ruined, and it often refers to a game in which users turn their backs on the game, but due to the problems they experienced in the game. Since in order to be ruined, you have to be excited about the game first. Meanwhile God-game (\uac13\uac9c) refers to the best game\nOnly You Fold the Bitter Server Termination: I\u2019m actually not sure what this means lol they don\u2019t use any spacing and the words that I can catch are the slang for \u2018server termination\u2019 and \u2018fold\u2019. At least, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s really \u2018fold\u2019 It either refers to the poker term that means \u2018to fold is to discard one\u2019s hand and forfeit interest in the current pot\u2019, or just something like turn back, switching up, or \u2026 idk. I don\u2019t think it will be back again so let\u2019s just forget about this one.\nThere\u2019s a lot of slangs used in this chapter, especially the otaku and fan part, but I\u2019m just \u2026 going \u2026 to skip the explanations. IT\u2019S TOO MUCH T__T\nah, and if you noticed I changed \u201cThe Great Ones\u201d to \u201cThe Great Old Ones\u201d, and also \u201cStellar Wisdom Order\u201d to \u201cChurch of Starry Wisdom\u201d. Some of you already know the reference, but let\u2019s just act clueless (actually, I don\u2019t know anything about this one mythos. The reason I can translate the previous names like Rieul\u2019s ring, flower name, and Yichan\u2019s contractor is just pure luck lol, so I hope you understand the sudden names revision.)\nand please say welcome to our new character~ \nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

There were times when it used a friendly tone and displayed text that seemed to have been scraped from a viral blog.\n\u2018Is there really someone inside the system?\u2019\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make sense though, hmm.\nI wondered what the intention was if this system really responded to me. \u00a0It hasn\u2019t done any harm to me so far, but I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s just helping me.\n\u2018Anyway, it\u2019s clear that it wants to throw me into the dungeon.\u2019\nOf course, I will never go. I immediately turned off that ominous quest window.\nRather than going to the dungeon, I decided to become a coffee slave, so I handled the accumulated orders, but it wasn\u2019t long before I hit my limit.\nThe red light flickered on the system window because I ran out of stamina. In addition, the coffee beans were also bottomed out.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we are closing our business now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Already?\u201d\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ll give you ten times the ruby, so please sell me more!\u201d\n\u201cI ran out of coffee beans. I\u2019m sorry. We will open the business when the ingredients come in.\u201d\n\u201cThen, give me lemonade!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all gone, too.\u201d\n\u201cAaaagh!\u201d\nAfter sending the desperate customers outside, I didn\u2019t even have the strength to move a finger.\nI put green beans in the roaster and lit it with the power of the ring. Then, as I smelled the coffee beans being roasted, I collapsed on the table.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nSince it is a small home roaster, the amount of coffee that can be roasted at once is small. Until now, it\u2019s been fine, but when the customers flocked in earnest, it became inconvenience.\nShould I buy a commercial roaster? Just in time, the last quest reward increased the amount of empty land in the space. I think it would be nice to have it installed there.\n\u201cI wish you could give me a roster instead of useless things as a quest reward\u2026.\u201d\nI muttered deliberately.\nAs I guessed, if there is a will in this system, please listen to my opinion and reflect it.\n\u201cYou know, the roaster that turns automatically. The one that can roast a lot at once. It can be installed in the space.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you muttering to yourself, meow?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu\u2026..\u201d\nNext to me, Mieum and Lime looked at me with strange eyes. Hmmm, I guess you don\u2019t understand my big meaning.\nCome to think of it, I received a cafe table as a reward earlier. How do you use that?\nTiling! The moment when I tried to re-read the system notification, a new message popped up.\n[Comfortable Cafe Table (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606) can be installed. Do you want to install it?Yes / No]\nWhen I selected \u2018Yes\u2018, a hazy light flashed and the cafe table changed.\nThe top plate was made of dark brown thick wood and had a warm atmosphere. It looked a little bit more luxurious than the original table.\n[Item: Comfortable Cafe Table (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)Type: FurnitureA wooden cafe table. When you sit down, you can feel a little comfortable.Note: Satisfaction +1, Comfort +1]\n[Clear more quests to collect various furniture. You can upgrade your cafe.]\n\u201cGive me the roaster\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n[Collect various furniture.][Collect various furniture.]\nI see. This system listens to me, but it only hears what it wants to hear\u2026.\nIt was the part-timer that was more urgent than the roaster.\nIn fact, on the first day when the number of customers began to increase, I already posted job openings. However, even though the conditions were better than the average, there were no applicants because of the location. As soon as they heard that it was in front of Dungeon Gate, they turned it down.\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\nAt that time, when I was in agony, the store door opened again. I barely got up on the table and said,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re out of ingredients today, so we\u2019re closed\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I guess I\u2019m late.\u201d\nThe visitor was Ki Yoohyun. He was alone today, not with the twins.\nWearing a black coat, with his slightly long hair combed nicely, he smiled bitterly as if he had guessed the situation when he saw the empty store and the melancholic me.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, don\u2019t you want to work part-time at a cafe?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026yes?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be an honor to work at your cafe, Rieul-ssi.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know he\u2019d say that he liked it\u2026.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t your guild banned you from doing double jobs?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no rules like that.\u201d\nSuddenly, I remembered my memories of working at a company before the regression.\nAt lunchtime, there were employees who left a nearby cafe and bought coffee from a distant cafe where they had to cross two railroad crossings.\nLater, I found out that the part-timer at that distant was handsome. I was curious too, but I couldn\u2019t go during lunch time because I was busy eating and sleeping.\nI looked up at Ki Yoohyun and did a simulation in my head for a while.\nWhite shining cheeks, balanced features, long arms and legs that match his long coat, and a pair of sparkling eyes that seem to tell a story just by looking at them.\nIf he works part-time here, the number of customers is likely to increase.\n\u201cI\u2019m just joking. I can\u2019t use a guild hunter as a part-timer\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha\u2026\u2026\u201d\nI hope you don\u2019t look at me with such a sad expression. We\u2019re lucky that there are only a cat and a slime who are busy playing here, because it\u2019s a face that could be misunderstood if other people saw it.\nI got up in front of the table.\n\u201cPlease sit here. I\u2019ll give you something to drink.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you already closed?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but \u2026 I have enough for you, Yoohyun-ssi.\u201d\nFortunately, there were enough beans to make two cups of coffee on the bottom of the box where the beans were stored.\nSince I was tired, I want to drink a sweet drink. Still, I want the finish to be clean, is there anything like that?\nAh, this is it. There happened to be a suitable recipe from the new recipes I got today.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make a new menu.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\nNext is the ingredients\u2026\u2026.\nThe Dimensional Shop has the ingredients it needed. I bought a whipped cream made from the milk of A-class Golden Triangular Rhinoceros.\nFirst, add sugar to the whipped cream . For this menu, it was important to make the right viscosity, neither too watery nor too hard.\nWhen I listened to the whipping machine, it felt moderately heavy, and it was perfect when it flowed down.\nNext, I poured espresso into the glass and added ice and water to make a strong iced Americano. After pouring the freshly made whipped cream on top of it, the process was over.\nAll right, Einspanner\u2019s done.\n[Item: Einspanner (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:30:00)Effect: Stamina and Energy are continuously restored for one hour. (10 points per minute)]\nThe thick and bitter iced Americano was covered with sticky whipped cream. The layered appearance in the glass was also pleasing to the eye.\nI decided to drink this finished menu right away.\nThe sweet and soft cream entered my mouth first. The rich taste of milk and sugar were just sweet enough to make me feel good.\nNext, the coffee flavor. The thickly brewed Americano neutralized the creamy taste, leading to a delicate change in taste.\nThis is the taste. It is sweet and soft, but the finish is clean.\nSipping Einspanner while sitting down on the chair gave me strength. It\u2019s due to the effect of Einspanner, which gradually restored my almost-zero stamina and energy.\nHee, I think I\u2019m going to live a little now\u2026.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun also drank with a cup of Einspanner. At that moment, a beam of twinkling light rose above his head.\nI was lost in thought as I watched it for a moment.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not every day, but just like today, Ki Yoohyun often came here and ordered coffee.\nConsidering the distance between the Cheongna Guild and the Dungeon Gate, I have a reasonable suspicion that he seems to come whenever he has a chance.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s doing anything special here. All he does are drinking coffee and chatting about daily life before going back.\nHis daily chatter is\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cThe guild members went to the lower-grade dungeon today. I didn\u2019t go because they said I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\nor sad.\n\u201cI heard you went to the dungeon with Hunter Choi Cedric.\u201d\u201cThe expression is strange. I didn\u2019t go there, I got caught up\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I also want to go with Rieul-ssi.\u201d\u201cNo, I have no intention of going to the dungeon even if I am dead and come back to life.\u201d\nor unusual.\n\u201cHunter Han Yiseong was very disappointed because he missed the new S-class. I heard his whereabouts are unknown now, do you happen to know about it?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, hahaha\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. The new S-class, as well as the plant dungeon. Rieul-ssi is always involved in something different from the past.\u201d\u201cYes? What did you just say\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nIt looked like an interrogation.\nAnyway, at first I felt like he was a regular after seeing him so many times, but it changed a little from some time ago.\nSince when\u2026.\n\u201cHm \u2026 uhm\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi?\u201d\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\nA sudden enlightenment flashed through my mind.\nAh, it\u2019s from then on.\nAt that time, after buying the Purifying Tree from Lee Chorok\u2019s Happy Green Life Farm, I ran into Ki Yoohyun, who was with the twins, on my way back.\nI don\u2019t know exactly how to express it, but the meaningful eyes that were looking at me and the feeling of distance that has diminished a bit\u2026.\n\u201cRieul-ssi.\u201d\nA soft voice was heard. I was surprised at how close it was. He caught my attention so easily just by slightly tilting his head. His bright eyes turned to me, and I felt a cool touch on my hand.\n\u201cThere\u2019s powder on your hand.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Ah.\u201d\nI had coffee powder on my wet hands. Ki Yoohyun picked up the tissue and gently wiped my hand.\nAs if that was all he had in mind, his hand quickly fell, but the distance between us was still close.\nWhat is this? Normally, I would have thought about what else it meant to Ki Yoohyun.\nYesterday, I even asked my friend, Shin Mira, through KakaoTalk.\n[Me: There\u2019s a customer who comes to the store every day][Shin Mira: Fixed income is the best]\nYeah, that\u2019s true.\u2026..\nAll right, I shouldn\u2019t think too much, let\u2019s just ask.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi seems to like coffee very much.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t say I\u2019d openly ask him. Still, if I want to ask why he comes every day \u2026 this is right.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because the coffee made by Rieul-ssi is delicious.\u201d\nThe coffee is actually delicious, though.\n\u201cAnd\u2026.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun hesitated for a moment, blurring the end of his words. He looked like he was choosing the right words.\nAt that moment, Mieum, who was lying on her belly on the floor, suddenly intervened.\n\u201cWaeoong, waeoong (This man, you hardly notice the taste).\u201d\n\u2026. What? What are you talking about?\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nToday\u2019s bonus chapter because a comment made me laugh.\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST !!!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c64": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nWhen I heard the full story, it was like this.\nIt has been a long time since Muwon, the No. 1 in Korea\u2019s Hunter Rankings, disappeared. The overwhelming power was compared to his quiet deeds. He\u2019s occasionally wiping out serious rifts alone.\nSomeone with a past that cannot be revealed no matter how much you dig, a Hunter behind the curtain who doesn\u2019t even bother with attention.\nThe influence Muwon has on the Korea\u2019s Hunter World was enormous.\n\nIt became a problem when the number of Hunters who admire him and imitate his hard work has increased.\nEven if someone becomes an A-class, instead of registering with the Dungeon Management Office, they\u2019ll become a dark hero who\u2019s playing hard in the shadow of Abyss. It caused quite a commotion.\nThere are many Hunters who try to pose as Fake Muwon for the number of views on YouTube, so the so-called Sandbag Prevention Act has been newly established.\nWith this brief explanation, I could guess what kind of situation he has been dealing with.\nThe new S-class, Choi Yichan, who announced his existence on the news after clearing the Suwon dungeon splendidly, disappeared without measuring his ranking or renewing his Hunter Registration.\nAn E-class on paper, but S-class on reality.\nIt\u2019s only natural that Kang Hyunwoo\u2019s powerful radar, who suffered from countless people who hid their power, was triggered. This case was immediately designated as a first-level management target and the team leader, Kang Hyunwoo, moved directly.\nWith the formidable administrative power of the Dungeon Management Office, Choi Yichan\u2019s whereabouts were known, but he did not come right away because it was difficult if he approached Choi Yichan prematurely. I\u2019ll be be hard to find an S-class who is determined to be hidden.\nInstead, in order to convince Choi Yichan smoothly, a compensation plan was perfectly prepared \u00a0for renewing the Hunter Registration to S-class.\nFinally, he came today to catch Choi Yichan \u2026 no, to encourage him to register.\n\u201cWhen did he leave?\u201d\nIn the behalf of Kang Hyunwoo, who is frozen, Jina carefully asked.\n\u201cAbout an hour ago\u2026\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cUnbelievable\u2026.\u201d\nThud!\nIf only they had come a day or a few hours earlier \u2026 the officials were frustrated.\nThe two government officials left their direct contact information and asked me to contact me when he returns.\nAfter seeing them off with regret, I was trying to clean up the empty cups, but Mieum and Lime were playing with some paper.\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\n\u201cNyaaaah (Give me that, slime guy)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyuuu!\u201d\nPakpak! The battle between Mieum, who flung her front paws, and Lime, who was chubby and dodged perfectly, continued. The result is Lime\u2019s victory, who showed a perfect dodging technique.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nI approached the two animals and quickly took the paper.\n\u201cMeoooong (The human dropped it off earlier)!\u201d\n\u201cIf you find something like this, you must return it immediately \u2026 Hmm?\u201d\nThe paper was a flyer looking for a person. There was a picture of a young man with an ordinary impression that he would be easily forgetten even if we run into him on the street. His name is Kim Jihoon.\nI\u2019ve never heard of this name. By the way\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026.Doesn\u2019t he look like I\u2019ve seen him somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu!\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know that! You didn\u2019t even take me! Kyaooo!\u201d\nMieum turned her head to show that she\u2019s sulking. Lime also makes a cry of sympathy next to her.\nThese animals are upset because I went to the farm to save the Blue Celaeno Flower alone. They can\u2019t believe that I did such a fun thing on my own.\nIs that fun? Besides, I almost died there\u2026\u2026?\n\u201cI just wanted to see the flower of starlight, meooong!\u201d\n\u201cMieum, you said you didn\u2019t want to go into the suitcase.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you ask the flower owner to show it to us?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cKyakyaooong!\u201d\nMieum jumped up and threw a punch. She really wants to see the flower. Still, what\u2019s done\u00a0can\u2019t be undone.\n\u2018I got Choi Cedric\u2019s contact number, but let\u2019s keep it a secret\u2026.\u2019\n\u201cI heard it\u2019s a medicine for his sick younger sister. How can I ask him to show me?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nHowever, Mieum didn\u2019t answer.\nI glanced to her because I thought she was sulking again, but the words suddenly continued.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a strange story.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe Blue Celaeno Flower blooms under the starlight of Celaeno. It is not a drug to cure a disease.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Monster Hell that swallowed the flower was revived?\u201d\n\u201cThat is because of the influence of \u2588\u2588\u2588 Celaeno \u2588\u2588! That\u2588\u2588\u2588 regenerates monsters with magical power\u2026..\u201d\n[Warning: Abnormal Approach]\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\nMieum\u2019s voice crackled and began to drifted away, and a red warning window popped up without a fail.\nThis damned system window!\n\u201cWaeoong! Hurry up and level up!\u201d\n\u201cAll of a sudden?!\u201d\nHowever, now that I\u2019m level 11, my status is this much.\nName: Kwon RieulClass: Cafe Owner (F)(Lv. 11)Stamina 110/110, Energy 110/110Strength: 22 (+10), Intelligence: 14, Agility: 13, Luck: 14\nAlthough it was only a little, I\u2019ve became stronger, but it seems that it was still not enough for Mieum\u2019s level.\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak because you\u2019re weak! In order to unleash the power of me, the seventh agent who enforces the system, you, human, must be strong, meong!\u201d\nPakpak!\nAfter avoiding the flying front paws, I looked at Mieum. She has cereal crumbs around her mouth.\nIn the morning, she occupied the front of the television and watched the drama, and until five minutes ago, she played with tearing paper. Bickering with Lime is a bonus.\n\u2018She\u2019s having a lot of fun\u2026.?\u2019\nIt was brazen to see the seventh agent completely forgetting her duty and pretending that she\u2019s not enjoying the life of a cat.\n\u201cNyaoong! Don\u2019t look at me with the eyes that see me like I\u2019m only good at talking and only playing around!\u201d\n\u201cAh, I got caught.\u201d\n\u201cKyakyakkyaoong!\u201d\nAvoiding the interference of the system, Mieum told me that the flower is not harmful.\nCome to think of it, it\u2019s not a cure, but, to be precise, a pain reliever.\n\u2018Whatever it is, I hope she doesn\u2019t get sick\u2026.\u2019\nAnyway, I looked at the flyer again.\n\u201cHu-um.\u201d\nIs it just a feeling? He has a very common impression, so it\u2019s highly likely that I misunderstood about seeing this person somewhere.\nAs I was about to put the flyer in the drawer, the store door suddenly opened.\nJina, who had just returned, was in front of the door. Her face was red from running and she was breathing heavily.\n\u201cJina-ssi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cDid I leave anything here?\u201d\n\u201cIs this it?\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nJina approached quickly and received the flyer.\n\u201cYes, this is right. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cBy the way, who is that?\u201d\n\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d\nJina bit her lip. When I looked at her, it looked like water will pouring out of her eyes at any moment. At that time, Kang Hyunwoo, who was waiting outside the door, called Jina.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet \u2026 I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d\nShe bowed, nodded her head, and turned away.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Jina looked pale.\n***\nChoi Yichan left a note as if he was about to practice martial arts while being hit by a waterfall.\nI finally decided to support him, although it\u2019s a shame that the temporary part-timer and the person in charge of playing with the animals left.\nI\u2019m worried, but after he became an S-class, he experienced a lot of inconveniences . I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s trying to do, but there must be a reason why he suddenly left.\nThat\u2019s what I thought, but\u2026..\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nLife didn\u2019t go my way. For some reason, the number of customers suddenly increased a few days ago.\n[Skill: Cafe in My Hand (C) is used.Recipe: Cafe Latte]\nI put the cafe latte in a takeout cup and served it to the customer. Without a moment to catch my breath, the next order came in.\n\u201cTwo cups of vanilla latte, please.\u201d\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cCan I make a group order?\u201d\nMy eyes were spinning as I thought about calculating the price, making drinks, and washing the dishes.\n\u2018Yichan-ah, please come back\u2026.\u2019\nI felt the desperate need for a part-timer now.\n[You have obtained 1 Golden Draw Ticket.][You have obtained 1 Golden Draw Ticket.][You have obtained 1 Golden Draw Ticket.]\nIn the midst of a sudden business boom, notifications were constantly popping up in the system window.\n[A quest has occurred.]\n[Sub Quest: The Dream of Cafe RevivalThe first step towards an SSS-Grade Cafe.Make money by selling your menu.\nRuby: 100/100Reward: ???]\n[The Dimensional Shop has been upgraded.

(0/110) Status abnormalities may occur when using the skill.]\nAs I used my skills for a long time to make coffee, I ran out of energy. After drinking an iced Americano that eliminated energy consumption, I processed the remaining orders again.\nI want to go home.\nThe problem is \u2026 this is my home.\nIn the meantime, there have been almost no customers, so it\u2019s good that there are more customers now.\n\u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe coffee tastes like this\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cOne more cup of this, please!\u201d\nIt was also true that seeing the customers happy and telling me the coffee was delicious made me feel proud.\nBut why the sudden increase of customers all of a sudden?\n\u201cNyaoong (You don\u2019t like it when there are only few customers, but when there\u2019s a lot of customer, you also don\u2019t like it because it\u2019s too much. You\u2019re really arbitrary).\u201d\n\u201cNoisy.\u201d\nI glared at Mieum while pouring coffee into a takeout cup.\nThat\u2019s the original mentality of a human. They\u2019re sad when the business doesn\u2019t go well, but they hate it when they\u2019re busy.\n\u201cWaeoong (Human)\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something you can say while using my Netflix ID.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no other animal here more perfectly adapted to royalty than you.\nAt that moment, I could hear the words of the customers who had just received their coffee.\n\u201cThis is the coffee shop that has special effects, right?\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve gotten stronger!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really delicious here!\u201d\n\u2026\u2026what?\nHow did this coffee get rumored to have special effects? I want to run away\u2026.\nTiling!\nThen, the system notification rang again.\n[A quest has occurred.]\n[Sub Quest: A Dungeon WalkYou\u2019re tired of your work, go away.Let\u2019s go around the dungeon, take care of your health, and refresh your mood.\nEnter a random dungeon: 0/1Rewards: EXP (500 EXP), 100 rubies, random recipe]\nI can\u2019t say anything.\nI got goosebumps at the quest that popped up as if it had read my mind.\nWhy is this system doing this to me?\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nSandbag is actually not an actual translation. The real used word is \ud798\uc21c\ucc10, it refers to a main character who hides their power / a person who has an atmosphere of hiding power on the outside, but is actually strong on the inside. It actually being used once when Rieul was suspecting Ki Yoohyun\u2019s ability back in the tutorial dungeon. Back then, I just changed the word to something similiar. I didn\u2019t expect the term to haunt me again\u2013 I can\u2019t find a good direct translation, so in this chapter, I used sandbag. It\u2019s a an English slang that means \u201cto downplay one\u2019s ability or act as though one is much less skilled in some task or activity in order to deceive and take advantage of someone/something.\u201d\nWe finally reached the timeline of the prologue. I hope you enjoyed the story!\nThank you Erumwhat and Kaylen for the coffee!\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

It\u2019s natural to have a happy ending!\u201d\n\u201cWho are you calling an idiot, you idiot!\u201d\n\nThe bickering sound of the kids who were watching television brought me back to my senses.\nEy, I had a ridiculous idea. Why would a tycoon be in a place like this?\nAh, speaking of store sales, it\u2019s still the same. How many guests came yesterday\u2026.\nAnyway, there was only one customer.\nHe was a Hunter, but at first glance, it looked like he was doing the Hunter Channel while drinking coffee. I hope he would write a good review.\nThanks to that customer, I was able to accomplish the quest to gather 10 customers.\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Main Quest: The Sorrow of the F-Grade Cafe\u2019.Please collect the reward.]\n[Main Quest: The Sorrow of the F-Grade CafeYou\u2019ve finally got your own cafe.But it\u2019s still Grade F.

As it turns out, in a novel or manga, when the main character says something like \u2018It will always be peaceful now,\u2019 \u00a0a non-peaceful event will happen.\n\u201cWhen I return home, I will marry my fiance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wash my hands when I\u2019m done with this.\u201d\n\u2026. they were selected as top 3 words that should never be said.\nWell \u2026 It\u2019s gonna be okay, right?\nIt\u2019s going to be fine \u2026 right?\n***\nAfter the twins with puffy eyes and Ki Yoohyun went back, I checked my watch.\nThere was no news even though it was almost time for Choi Yichan to come.\nDid something happen? Shall I make a phone call?\nAh, that\u2019s right. Choi Yichan still has his phone deactivated.\n\u201c\u2026.Huh?\u201d\nThen, I found a note on one side of the table. It was in an inconspicuous position because it was pressed with a coffee cup.\nWhat\u2019s this?\nThe note was written by Choi Yichan. The last sentence of the thickly written message, starting with a greeting, caught my eye first.\n[I realized my shortcomings.I will come back stronger.\u2014 Choi Yichan]\n\u2026.. What?\n***\nIs this all right?\nThe pace, which had gradually slowed, came to a complete stop. Choi Yichan looked back several times.\nThe red brick cafe building has now become so small that it looks the size of a fingernail even with an S-class physical ability.\n\u3010Do you regret it?\u3011\nAs he stopped to look at the cafe for a while, a voice penetrated his mind. Choi Yichan answered inwardly, leaving his gaze intact.\n\u2018No.\u2019\n\u3010Your expression says otherwise.\u3011\n\u2018Noisy.\u2019\n\u3010You\u2019re such a picky contractor.\u3011\nIt was after returning from Dungeon in Suwon that this voice began to be heard in his head. A strange voice that asked if he needed power.\nChoi Yichan ignored this voice at first.\n\u3010Contractor.\u3011\u201c\u2026\u2026Kwon Ri, I\u2019m going to run a marathon!\u201d\u201cHuh?! Didn\u2019t you say that you ran 40 km earlier?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to run 40 kilometers more!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\nHe must have heard those sounds because he exercised less. It\u2019s because he felt like a crazy person.\n\u3010Isn\u2019t it time for you to give me an answer?\u3011\nEvery time he heard that sound, he ran and ran again.\nNo matter how much he moved his body, he did not get tired after becoming an S-class. On the contrary, he would break a cup on daily basis because he couldn\u2019t control his strength, so running was a perfect exercise.\n\u3010You gained power through the contract, but you ignored me. In human terms, it called \u2018Eat and Run\u2019.\u3011\u201cI\u2019ll be back after doing squats!\u201d\u201cYichan-ah, again?\u201d\u3010Contractor, you\u2019re eating and running away.\u3011\u201cHuuh, huu\u2026.\u201d\u3010\u2026\u2026.\u3011\nEven after becoming an S-class, the surroundings are complicated, and even the strange voice in his head bothers him.\nHe thought it was because he was full of energy, so he took protein and exercised again.\nThen, the voice began to talk about the future.\n\u3010Next February, there will be a rift in Mt. Jirisan.\u3011\u3010The phoenix is \u200b\u200blost.\u3011\u3010That person is ill.\u3011\nFrom big events to the future of passersby. He stubbornly ignored the words he didn\u2019t want to hear.\n\u3010Aren\u2019t you curious what will happen to your friend?\u3011\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\nBut he could no longer ignore what it said about his friend, Kwon Rieul. Moreover, the content\u2026.\n\u2026\u2026she\u2019s going to die?\nHis heart thumped loudly. The image of Rieul smiling well all the time flashed through his head.\nHow glad he was to see her again.\nIt was a future he didn\u2019t even want to think about.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? If it\u2019s nonsense, I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d\nThe black pendant on his neck heated up. Choi Yichan knows this is how this mysterious voice laughs.\nAfter laughing for a while, he continued his talk.\n\u3010You answered that you needed power. So I gave you power.\u3011\u3010But, Contractor, you can\u2019t save everything.\u3011\u201cStop talking nonsense and tell me what to do.\u201d\u3010There are things you have to give up to save your friend.\u3011\u201cNo, I want to save everything.\u201d\nThere was no wavering in his voice. Again, the pendant heated up.\n\u3010After all, I feel like I\u2019ve been ripped off.\u3011\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u3010All right, Contractor, I\u2019ll give you a mission.\u3011\nTiling!\n[Quest: The Trial of the King in Yellow Begins.]\n\u3010You will be able to obtain the power you want at the end of the Trial.\u3011\nIf so, there is no choice but to do it.\nIn the end, Choi Yichan left a note and left Cafe Rieul. He\u2019s a bad liar. If she looks at his face, he will definitely be caught.\n\u201cWhere should I go?\u201d\n\u3010First \u2026 Let\u2019s go to the Abyss over there.\u3011\nThe voice pointed to the huge dungeon in front of him.\n\u3010I\u2019m the one Who is Not to be Named. Be careful and remember.\u3011\n\u201cYou\u2019re not Voldemort.\u201d\n\u3010\u2026\u2026.\u3011\n\u3010Call me The King in Yellow, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u3011\n\u201cYou should have said that earlier.\u201d\n\u3010\u2026\u2026.\u3011\n***\nWhy did Choi Yichan leave all of a sudden? What is it that he realized he\u2019s lacking?\nI was shocked to see the note left by Choi Yichan. I couldn\u2019t think of any reason for him to leave suddenly.\nIt was nice to have Choi Yichan during that time, now I felt lonely.\n\u201cAre you there?\u201d\nJust then, there was a knock on the door.\n\u201cYes! Come on in.\u201d\n\u201cHello. My name is Kang Hyunwoo, and I\u2019m the head of Emergency Dungeon Countermeasures Team from the Dungeon Management Office.\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi, long time no see!\u201d\nA public official in a formal suit was standing in front of the door. Next to him was Jina.\n\u201cI came here after hearing the news that the new S-class Hunter, Choi Yichan, is here. Can I see him?\u201d\nWell, he used to be here, but\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cHe just left.\u201d\n\u201cThen when can I see him?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026?\u201d\nI handed the note left by Choi Yichan to the man in front of me.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe two officials who checked the note were in despair.\nThere used to be an S-class, but now there was none.\n***\nPage Six: The Part-Timer is a Demon King! (self-proclaimed)\n\n\u201c\u2026Please drink.\u201d\nFirst, I made two cups of Americano for two frustrated government officials.\n\u201cThis\u2026! It\u2019s really delicious. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s the same name as black beans that only tasted bitter.\u201d\n\u201cRight? I told you that Rieul-ssi\u2019s coffee is delicious.\u201d\nJina shrugged her shoulders with a proud expression.\nIt\u2019s such a friendly coffee time for a moment. While drinking the Americano, the public officials\u2019 expressions relaxed, but soon they became depressed again.\nI glanced at the business card I had just received.\nHunter Kang Hyunwoo, the Head of Emergency Dungeon Countermeasures Team.\nHe is famous. He has the best image among Korean civil servant hunters. I remember him briefing with a stiff expression every time he appeared on the news.\n\u2018Another piece of information is\u2026\u2026\u2019\nIt was known that his parents run a famous restaurant. I was curious, but I haven\u2019t been able to go yet because it\u2019s always crowded.\nNo, this isn\u2019t important.\nI had heard that Jina became directly under Hunter Kang Hyunwoo, but I did not expect that he would come this far on his own.\nHe has neatly combed hair, angular attire, modest behavior, and even though I said it was okay, he went to get the receipt and paid the coffee. He\u2019s truly the embodiment of an FM.\nHis dark expression made me straighten my shoulders as well.\n\u201cDo you happen to know the contact information of Hunter Choi Yichan?\u201d\n\u201cI know, but \u2026 you won\u2019t be able to reach him.\u201d\nKang Hyunwoo immediately called the number I gave him. As expected, the sound that came out was \u2018No Connection\u2026.\u2019. \n\u201cWhy did he leave?\u201d\nI have a hunch. I don\u2019t know exactly what this is, but it sounds like a fine for negligence.\nIn Korea, laws related to Awakened Persons are rather strict. In particular, the boundaries for the uncontrolled forces are enormous.\nEvery May, \u201cIt is the month of voluntarily updating the Awakened Rankings.\u201d and \u201cIf you update your ranking, you\u2019ll get tax reduction benefits.\u201d, these kind of promotional materials\u00a0were posted all over the city.\nHowever, after reawakening to S-class, Choi Yichan cut off his phone and worked part-time at this cafe.\n\u2026 There were so many things that bothered me. All that remains is a single note of unknown meaning, \u2018I will come back stronger\u2018.\nIf this is the case, he might have a big problem. I have to make up for it somehow.\nWorried about Choi Yichan, I squeezed out a suitable answer.\n\u201cThat \u2026 thinking about what true strength is \u2026 Ah, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s like a journey to find himself!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t work at all. The officials are looking at me with suspicious eyes.\nKwon Rieul has gone into chaos!\nAt that moment.\nFlutter.\nA piece of paper fell from the file that Kang Hyunwoo was holding.\nDue to the bright colors and the font size of 20pt, the content caught my eye even when I didn\u2019t purposely look at it.\nIs it because of copyright issues? It\u2019s fortunate that there is no Bono X No. It was written in a design that would have made the designer\u2019s backbone quite tingly.\nNow is the time to show off your power.~How to Prevent Suffocation~\nThe following benefits are provided to new Awakened Hunters of Grade A or higher who have registered as Hunters.\n\nHousing stability support (including family members)\nNo worry about power control.

Just coffee. However, the effects of drinking a cup of coffee are varied. From strength and energy recovery, debuff nullification, and critical rate increase. I was able to receive a buff that is difficult to obtain even with advanced potions.I couldn\u2019t believe it at first either.

Goosebumps;;;;\n\n***\nThe incident at the Happy Green Life Dungeon Farm was quickly settled.\nIt was a rare plant-dungeon, but it passed quietly without any news reports.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a consequence, just like before the regression, Lee Chorok\u2019s farm went out of business. It\u2019s not only because a rift broke out, but also because numerous violations were discovered during the investigation and she avoided a lot of fines. Fortunately, she was spared from being locked in the jail because they recognized her contribution of reporting immediately when the dungeon occured.\nSuddenly, a large package was delivered to the cafe, and when I opened it, it was a box of apples sent by Lee Chorok\u2019s sister. I\u2019m sorry to trouble her with this. The apples were delicious.\n\u201cHuu \u2026 Customer-nim, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m still alive anyway.\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs a token of apology, please accept this!\u201d\nLee Chorok, who\u2019s planning to close her farm and work part-time at a fruit store in the future, handed me a seed. Most of the dungeon plants were confiscated, but luckily she was able to recover this one. Since it is a very rare seed, she said she would leave it to me, who revived the Blue Celaeno Flower.\n\u2018Monster Hell appeared from the rare seed that you bought\u2026.\u2019\nI was nervous. I was incredibly anxious.\nI tried to refuse, but the investigation found it harmless, so I eventually accepted it.\nHow did I do the investigation?\n\u201cMiaaaaw (Hoo, this is a pretty precious thing)!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026is that so?\u201d\n\u201cWaaeoong, waeoong (this is nothing dangerous)!\u201d\n\u2026 that\u2019s what Mieum said.\nUmh, well. Let\u2019s just believe it for now. I planted the unidentified seed in the corner of the space and forgot about it.\nAnd, today.\n\u201cHello.\u201d\n\u201cHello.\u201d\nThe twins of Cheongna Guild, whom I met with Ki Yoohyun last time, came to the cafe. The purpose is, of course, to eat snacks and watch touching animations.\nTwo cups of warm vanilla latte. There were a lot of apples left, so I served cookies with apple jam inside. It was a sweet cookie with warm apple jam flowing when you take a bite.\n\u201cWhoaa!\u201d\nJoo Shinwoo, with his eyes wide open, bit a cookie. Next to him,  Joo Shinhee gave him a harsh scolding.\n\u201cYou idiot! Did you forget what I said earlier?\u201d\n\u201cHuk, right.\u201d\nJoo Shinwoo put the cookie down on the plate and bowed his head.\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\nHe\u2019s so cute\u2026..\nHowever, instead of picking up the cookies, Joo Shinhee only wiggled her fingers. She seemed to have something to say.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Does it not suit your taste? Can I give you something else?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No! It\u2019s not that, just\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nShe wiggled her fingers again, pondered for a while, and finally opened her mouth.\n\u201cI, umh \u2026 may I call you Eonni?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\n\u201cEonni \u2026 Thank you for the food.\u201d\nWhat should I do? She\u2019s so cute.\u2026.\nNo matter what happens, I decided to make sure that those children did not change in 3 years as they did before the regression.\nThe twins\u2019 eyes twinkled as they sat next to each other and drank the vanilla latte while holding the cup with both hands.\nWithout looking at the bar of light rising above their heads, I could tell that the drink was delicious.\n[The condition has been met.Combo bonus will be generated.Combo: Children\u2019s Menu (Vanilla Latte, Apple Jam Cookie)Effect: Perfect nutrition for children.]\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Sub Quest: Lady of the Children\u2019s Heart\u2019.]\nThe system notification that sounded with tiling is set aside for now.\nNow, it was the time to watch the touching animal animation that I prepared in advance.\n\u201cHeuk, huhuhu\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWaeoooong, meow, waeooong (No, run away, meow, you can\u2019t go there)!\u201d\nThe one who became most immersed in the story was our house cat.\nSitting side by side with Mieum and Lime, I made two new cups of coffee while watching the twins who were absorbed in the TV. One cup was for Ki Yoohyun, who came as the guardian of the twins today.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026thank you.\u201d\nHe smiled and picked up the cup of coffee in front of him. The long eyelashes casted a shadow on his face, and a faint smile crept onto his white cheeks. It was an appearance that inadvertently made me exclaimed my admiration.\nI\u2019ve met this man several times already, but I can\u2019t get used to it. Especially those dark eyes that seem to have something to say, even though he\u2019s just looking at me\u2026..\n\u201cRieul-ssi.\u201d\nOh, he really did have something to say.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been through hardships.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha \u2026 It was kind of like that.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad you are safe.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nObviously, the case where I got caught up in Monster Hell wasn\u2019t reported in the news. It\u2019s not because the case is trivial. There is a possibility that other incidents may have been involved behind the distribution of the seed of Monster Hell, so the incident was not reported for information control.\nHe\u2019s in the same Hunter industry, so he might have heard the information, but\u2026\u2026.\nI took a sip of coffee and looked at Ki Yoohyun again.\nA striking appearance. A Hunter in the bottom of Cheongna Guild\u2019s hierarchy. For such a thing, he has a relaxed attitude that feels daunting.\nI met him for the first time because he was hiding under the wall of this store, and I have encountered him often since then.\nUmh\u2026..\nIf you look at him, this man is also very suspicious.\nIs he actually a huge tycoon?\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nTHE NETIZEN TALKS IN THIS CHAPTER SOMEHOW FEELS SO HARD I ALMOST GIVE UP T__T\nPlease do not repost!!!

The scratch on my forehead, which I didn\u2019t even know existed, was healed in the light emanating from his fingertip.\n\u201cThank heavens. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any serious injuries.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well \u2026 yes.\u201d\n\u201cThey say you can go home as soon as you file a damage report. You must be very tired even if you don\u2019t have a trauma. Take a good rest when you get back.\u201d\n\nWhat is this weird feeling\u2026..\nI was nervous because I was afraid that he might get angry because I hid my awakening, but Kwon Jiwoon said nothing.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nIs the confession of my lifetime completely ignored? Did he pretend that he didn\u2019t hear it?\nUmh yeah, I guess he didn\u2019t hear it because it was noisy around us. I said it again clearly.\n\u201cKwon Jiwoon, I\u2019m awakened now?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThis time, he looked a little shocked.\nOh, is it because of that?\n\u201cThat\u2019s, umh, I mean, I didn\u2019t mean to hide it, but somehow \u2026 Ah, and I\u2019ll never say that I want to join your guild, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nIt\u2019s strange. I said it with the intention not to make him worry, but Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s expression darkened even more.\n\u201cIt seems that I\u2019m not reliable enough for you.\u201d\nThe following words sounded sad.\nKwon Jiwoon grabbed my hand. All the visible wounds had all disappeared in the white light. The hand that gripped mine was trembling.\n\u201cIf something happened, you should have called me.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t connect my phone inside the dungeon.\u2026.\u201d\nUnbeknownst to me, the words of an excuse came out.\n\u201cI won\u2019t ask you why you came to such a suspicious place, but at least you should have told me. I was suddenly informed that you got caught in a rift, and do you know how much I\u2026.\u201d\nI flinched unconsciously at the deep fear. His reaction felt strange.\nI was in confusion because it was the first time I saw him acting like this, it was the time when I tried to choose an answer\u2026.\n\u201cWhat are you doing there \u2026 Eh.\u201d\nChoi Cedric came out of the escape gate. As he was talking to me, he saw Kwon Jiwoon in front of me and was startled.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be \u2026 Hunter Kwon Jiwoon..\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cHunter Choi Cedric. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon reached out his hand first and asked for a handshake. However, from the side view, the atmosphere was not very friendly.\n\u201cThis is the first time we met since you said that you\u2019d buy my guild with money if I didn\u2019t accept the offer to join the affiliate of your company.\u201d\nChoi Cedric, have you ever done anything like that\u2026.\nIndeed, it is known as a bad guild among The Big Three.\n\u201cThat \u2026 due to the circumstances, at the request of the CEO-nim, I can\u2019t help it\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Cedric, who muttered something in embarrassment, held his breath. He belatedly changed his words as if he had recalled his external concept.\n\u201cHuu, hmm! You will regret not accepting the offer then!\u201d\nClench. The handshake ended in a bloody atmosphere.\nBut\u2026..\nIt was a hell of a bad performance. With anxious gaze, his tone was stiff as if he were reading a book. It\u2019s such a bad acting, but he succeeded in pretending to be an arrogant ranker, is everyone blind?\n\u201cI have work to do, so I\u2019ll go back first. See you next time.\u201d\nThere was no time to stop him. I wasn\u2019t sure if he didn\u2019t want to talk to Choi Cedric anymore or if he\u2019s avoiding me. Kwon Jiwoon turned around as it was.\nBy the way, C&L Corporation was trying to eat Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s guild?\n\u2018It\u2019s strange\u2026.\u2019\nThe White Silver Guild is a small guild centered on the top ranker Healer, Kwon Jiwoon.\nNaturally, no matter how top-ranked he is, a Healer cannot go around the dungeon alone. There\u2019s also the fact that the guild leader disappeared, so the scope of activities of The White Silver Guild was narrow compared to its popularity and recognition.\nThis means that there is no reason for a large guild like C&L to be greedy about it.\nFurthermore, according to my memory before the regression, C&L Corporation took the Healer\u2019s professional guild, Garden of Blessing, as a subsidiary. It\u2019s an extraordinary merger declaration of the Guild, which once had conflicts with Choi Cedric and even declared a boycott.\nMaybe there was too much money to refuse.\nIn short, it\u2019s not that they want to merge because they don\u2019t have enough healers.\n\u2018Hmmm\u2026.\u2019\nSomething must have happened with Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s guild.\nStill, right now, nothing was known. I wanted to ask Choi Cedric for more details, but he made an unexpected sound, showed off his full-fledged acting skills.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that, that\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean Kwon Jiwoon?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! What\u2019s your relationship with that Healer?!\u201d\n\u201cHuh? He\u2019s my cousin.\u201d\nChoi Cedric had a genuinely bewildered expression on his face. He covered his hand over his face and murmured to himself.\n\u201cOf all things, it was Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s family. Then, my image is completely messed up.\u201d\n What\u2019s wrong with him?\nAfter muttering to himself for a while, he raised his head.\n\u201cStill, I won\u2019t give up\u2026.\u201d\nNo, what?\n\u201cBe prepared!\u201d\nFor what?\n***\nA hospital room with cool shade.\nChoi Cedric sent out all the healers who were guarding Rona.\nAlso, the Healers, who were afraid of receiving his anger like the last time, left the hospital room as if they were running away.\nToday, his sister was suffering from nightmares. Her cheeks are hot with tears.\n\u201cRona-ya\u2026.\u201d\nOpening the inventory right away, Choi Cedric stopped.\nHe was afraid.\nThe Blue Celaeno Flower was his only hope to cure Rona\u2019s disease, which had no improvement by all means. How long has he been searching for a way to make the flower blooms after he accidentally obtained the seeds?\nAfter a lot of hard work, the flower finally came to life.\nHowever, what if this also fails? The despair when the single hope you believed in was crushed. Choi Cedric was not confident that he could endure it.\nStill, he didn\u2019t hesitate for long. He opened his inventory and set the potted flower down by the bedside.\nBlue starlight emanated from the petals. A dazzling light drifted through the shady space and filled the entire hospital room.\nThe groan slowly subsided and the breath became comfortable.\nIt was not long before Rona slowly opened her eyes.\n\u201c\u2026..Rona-ya!\u201d\nHer face was pale and her dry hands trembled, but the girl looked straight at him. It\u2019s been years since the last time he saw her awake like this.\n\u201cOppa\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAre you conscious? Uh, that\u2019s right, it\u2019s me. Your brother is here.\u201d\nShe reached out her hand. Choi Cedric took Rona\u2019s hand. He felt sorry for her skinny little hand.\nRona leaned on Choi Cedric\u2019s hand and got up. Her body, which had been lying in bed for a long time, was too heavy for even the smallest movement, and her arms trembled. Still, there is no time. Rona licked her dry lips.\n\u201cRona-ya, lie down first. Here\u2019s the water. Drink some water.\u201d\n\u201cOppa, that man, be careful\u2026.\u201d\nThe latter words were mingled with rough breath and could not be heard properly.\nIt was the limit. Slowly, Rona fell asleep again. He called her name a few more times, but the heavy eyelids didn\u2019t move.\nHowever, the sleep was comfortable. There was no pain as before, and the tight breathing and softly closed eyes seemed to be dreaming of a daydream.\nNow, he\u2019s so happy that this alone brought tears to his eyes.\nChoi Cedric ruffled Rona\u2019s hair slowly. He\u2019ll make sure that his sister will get better. Until then, just have a good dream.\nWhen he was thinking like that, the door of the hospital room burst open. It was Aeon, the secretary of the CEO.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nChoi Cedric inadvertently hid Rona from the secretary\u2019s gaze. Aeon has shown his face in this hospital room several times. But why? That faint smile made him feel uncomfortable.\n\u201cHow about Miss Rona? Has she gotten any better?\u201d\nAeon spoke in a worried tone. At those words, Choi Cedric forgot his vigilance and his heart softened a bit.\nHe must have been mistaken. He\u2019s a little reluctant, but \u2026 this person has dedicated himself to the guild. What is he even thinking?\n\u201cUhuh, thanks to this flower, she feels much better.\u201d\n\u201cCEO Lee Sein-nim said she had something to say to you.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Tell her I\u2019ll be there later.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s urgent.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Okay, I got it.\u201d\nChoi Cedric rose from the bedside with regret.\nRona is sleeping comfortably. In the meantime, he\u2019ll be back for a little bit.\n\u201cRona-ya, Oppa will be right back.\u201d\nAfter stroking his sleeping sister\u2019s hair once, Choi Cedric left the hospital room.\nAfter the sound of footsteps completely disappeared over the door\u2026..\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nSuddenly, there was no smile left on Aeon\u2019s face. In the horrifying silence, he erased all his facial expressions and and his non-human gaze turned to the girl on the bed.\nThen, he reached out towards the starlight flower. Without hesitation, Ion tried to crush the Blue Celaeno Flower with his hand.\nKiing\u2014\nThe intangible barrier deflected Aeon\u2019s hand. Sparks burst, followed by black smoke.\n\u201c\u2026.Cih.\u201d\nHis palm was burnt black even though he only touched the barrierfor a short time. Aeon clicked his tongue and hid the darkly hand.\nWell, that\u2019s enough. It doesn\u2019t make any difference even if you have this flower now. Wouldn\u2019t it be just a comfort for the mind?\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to do anything anyway.\u201d\nLeaving those words behind, Aeon turned his body.\nThe door closed. The girl is asleep.\n***\n\u201cUh \u2026 CEO-nim? What did you just say?\u201d\n\u201cWhy? You can do it.\u201d\nThe top floor of C&L Corporation. Rather than a Hunter Guild, it was a room decorated like a representative office of a large company.\nChoi Cedric looked at the CEO, Lee Sein, who was sitting across from him.\nHair combed to one side, a luxurious suit, and a relaxed smile like a successful person.\nHe has known her for a long time, but maybe because it\u2019s been a while since he has seen her, he felt particularly unfamiliar with this Lee Sein. Besides, what she just said\u2026.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you decide not to touch The White Silver Guild?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d\nSmile. Lee Sein smiled. It was the same smile that he practiced several times in front of the mirror years ago while saying that he couldn\u2019t be underestimated by other Hunters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that the plan has changed.\u201d\n\u201cBut if that\u2019s the case\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Nothing dangerous will happen. You\u2019re just like my little brother, do you think I would let you do something dangerous?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Cedric?\u201d\nThe gentle, soothing tone reminded him of the old days.\nThey are not real siblings. However, from the time the guild was named by adding C for Choi Cedric and L for Lee Sein, they became as close as family. In the old days with Rona, the three of them lived together in a building that was so small that it could not be compared to now. The scent of the distant past stimulated his longing.\n\u201cAll right, Noona.\u201d\nChoi Cedric swallowed the discomfort.\nYes, there is no way Lee Sein would give wrong directions. This uncomfortable feeling must be just an illusion.\nThe goal is the same as then: Making C&L the best guild. For the sake of this goal, he followed all instructions, even if it was incomprehensible. Nothing has changed.\nHowever\u2026..\nDid you know that you didn\u2019t even ask me a word about Rona, Noona?\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nSince being here means that you\u2019ve read korean novels, I would just assume that you already knew the basic words like oppa, noona, etc. If you don\u2019t know about it, feel free to ask~\nOh, which one do you think look better between \u2018Noona\u2019 and \u2018Nuna\u2019?

Taking advantage of the moment, I shouted again.\n\u201cGo! Kongdrick!\u201d\nHowever, the rebellion of Monster Hell, who did not want to lose the flower, the source of its life, was also enormous. As soon as Choi Cedric approached, it stretched out its branches and roots in all directions, creating a circular prison.\nIn result, we were trapped in it.\nHe cut it with his sword and I used cleaning skill, but the branches that were cut quickly grew back. We made a gap and forced our body out, but it was the same. The branches of the tree moved slowly, and they just made a prison again and locked us up.\nWhat is this \u2026 is this a regression? No, a loop?\nThe Infinite Return of Monster Hell?\nThen, a good idea flashed across my mind. If only the Blue Celaeno Flower can be taken from the Monster Hell, then there is no need to continue this sluggish work because it will no longer be able to regenerate.\nI opened the skill window and read the contents.

Let\u2019s take a break.\u201d\nChoi Cedric looked impatient, but he agreed that there was no end and nodded.\nIn the end, we decided to rest for a while while being trapped in Monster Hell. The first thing I did was make coffee.\nTrickle. A sweet smell spread all around. I handed the freshly made cafe mocha to Choi Cedric.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nOnce I gave it to him, he received it, but it seemed that he did not understand the current situation.\n\u201cHurry up and drink.\u201d\nHowever, experience is quicker than verbal explanation.\nThe effect of cafe mocha is a 200% increase in recovery speed.

This bitterness of sweetness, it\u2019s the taste of life!\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThis is definitely like that!\u201d\nShivering, answering humbly, and shuddering again. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve played with Choi Cedric, who has a silly commentary skill installed passively as his main (S) skill.\nChoi Cedric nodded with a serious expression and said.\n\u201cI see, you are\u2026.\u201d\nAll I did was use my skills to make coffee, but it\u2019s nice to hear compliments anyway.\nCalling me a genius barista is a bit exaggerated though, hahaha.\n\u201cCoffee Maniac, no, Coffee Tentaku!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s going on with the lexical system of this No. 2 ranker?\nAfter threatening Choi Cedric so that he would never call me like that again, I drank my share of vanilla latte.\nAll preparations are done.

Please collect the reward.][You have defeated the boss monster \u2018Monster Hell (B)\u2019][Dungeon: Monster Hell has been cleared.][You have reached Level 10.]\nI skimmed through the notification window that popped up.\nI thought it was a breaking-the-balance scam, but after killing the boss, it really worked.\nNow all we have to do is escape. As I headed towards the escape gate created near the body of Monster Hell, the alarm sounded again.\nTiling!\n[The current space cannot be maintained due to the death of Monster Hell.][The space is forcibly destroyed \u2026 30 seconds until it\u2019s gone.]\nTick-tock-tick-tock\u2026.\nThe remaining time in the system window quickly decreased, and the dungeon collapsed from the end of the field of view. The air from the original greenhouse was mixed and ate this space.\nFor a moment, I admired that strange sensation. The soles of my feet began to sink.\nIsn\u2019t 30 seconds too short?!\n\u201cAaaaahhh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cHey, be careful!\u201d\nChoi Cedric caught me as I slide. Then, he threw me towards the escape gate, telling me to get out first.\nThe moment I passed through the blue light of the gate.\n\u2026.Huh?\nThe remnants of Monster Hell were wrapped around my feet, and the wind swept them up into the air. This damn monster wood minions!\nMy body fell to the floor.\nNo, I killed the boss with my breaking-the-balance fraud skills, but my future of dying here is already decided!\nFortunately, the system responded quickly on its own.\n[Crisis situation! \u2018The Bond of a Cup of Coffee\u2018 is activated.][Target: \u2018Choi Yichan\u2019 is selected.][Skill: Defense is The Best Defense (C) is used.][Defense increases by 500% for 5 minutes.]\nI\u2019ve been through this situation before.\nRolling, roll!\nThere is no pain in the body that has landed in the perfect falling posture.\n\u2018The Floor is Shiny!\u2019\nThe monster\u2019s remnants wrapped around my feet were also perfectly slain. Perfect 2 Combo!\nFeeling proud inside, I raised my head, and our eyes met.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWith whom?\nKwon Jiwoon.\nWhy the hell is Kwon Jiwoon here? Did I see it wrong?\nHowever, that unique silver hair, there can be no two faces in the world with such a cold atmosphere.\nThe destroyed greenhouse, tearful Lee Chorok, and dungeon plants with red stickers on them. All of those things didn\u2019t even catch my eye.\nHe probably didn\u2019t see it, right?\nI just used a defensive skill, but it would have just looked like a fall.\nI blew away the remains of the monster, but that\u2019s just a cleaning skill\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nNo, let\u2019s stop running away from reality.\nA shock spread across Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s expressionless face. He approached me and bit his lips as if to pick his words, but no words came out.\nHe saw it all!\n\u201cUh, umh, Oppa, what brings you here\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon frowned slightly.\n\u201cHere, I was informed that there was a rift in this farm.\u201d\nWhen a rift suddenly bursts, the Dungeon Management Office first checks the status. After that, if it is not possible to take care of it only with the Hunters belonging to the Dungeon Management Office, they\u2019ll put a request for support from the guilds.\nThere are many criteria for requesting support, such as the size of the guild and the Hunter\u2019s ability. In the case of rift that are not particularly dangerous, it\u2019s just \u2026 it\u2019s a turn. It\u2019s like class duty.\nPerhaps it happened to be Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s turn today.\n\u201cReally? Hahaha, what a coincidence.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nSilence again.\nLet\u2019s calm down. After all, I was supposed to tell him about my awakening.\nI didn\u2019t expect to bump into him like this, but now is the time to say it.\nI took a few deep breaths and then moved my lips.\n\u201cOppa, I\u2019m awakened.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nHappy September!

Its digestive fluid is stronger than hydrochloric acid, and it can even melt the outer skin of a hard-skinned monster.A very scary creature that catches its prey with its agile vines and slowly melts it.By Ether-Wiki.\nSeeing the Monster Hell that appeared in front of me, I was bewildered for a very short time.\nThis is because there is a swordsman who ranks second here.\nA speed-type dealer who penetrates into the front of the enemy with agile movements. It is a skill that no one can match among swordsmen.\nHis well-known nickname is\u2026.\n\u201cGo! Kongdrick!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Don\u2019t call me that.\u201d\nWhile saying that, Choi Cedric smiled leisurely. He came forward with a sword as tall as his height. Wait a minute, the same Munchkin line was a bonus.\nSreeng. The blade drew a circle. \nIn an instant, it digs into the front of the Monster Mell and cuts it diagonally. He cut off the roots again without leaving any gaps.\nShashashak, Bang!\nThe Monster Hell was neatly split in two. The stem that spouted digestive juice also lost its strength and drooped.\n\u201cDone!\u201d\nNow it\u2019s time for the escape gate to open\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026.Huh?\u201d\nKeuoooo!\nThe Monster Hell, which seemed to be dead, arose again. The wound from the sword healed without a trace.\nThat\u2019s absurd. I\u2019m sure it just died!\nChoi Cedric fixed the sword and held it. He shouted.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s the same if you\u2019re still alive. If I cut it over again, it\u2019s over!\u201d\nWow, that\u2019s so reliable. The comfort of the Munchkin bus is amazing.\nChoi Cedric, who ran with a bang, jumped up. His body flew through the air. A lush branch of the resurrected Monster Hell appeared in front of him, but Choi Cedric\u2019s sword is faster.\nSwiish, kaang!\nThe big swinging sword cut the Monster Hell clean. Then, the bursting lightning skill is thrown down.\nPooooong! A shard of wood struck by lightning. This time, I was convinced that we had succeeded.\nHowever \u2026 a new branch sprouted from the tree stump hit by lightning and quickly resurrected.\nPerhaps even Choi Cedric did not expect this to happen, he frowned and shook his head.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019ve never heard of a B-class minion resurrecting without a cooldown.\u201d\nThen, something came into my sight.\n\u201cHey, look over there! That one!\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t come out and just stay in the shield \u2026 Huh?\u201d\nA starry blue flower was hanging on the top of the branches of Monster Hell.\nI wasn\u2019t mistaken. It was the Blue Celaeno Flower that was revived with a lot of efforts.\nChoi Cedric\u2019s face hardened in an instant.\n\u201cThat \u2026 No, we have to take that to Rona.\u201d\nThe flower seemed to be sucked into the rift with us and it got swallowed by the Monster Hell.\nWait, let\u2019s put our thoughts together.\nThe power of Blue Celaeno Flower is regeneration. Having swallowed the flower, the Monster Hell naturally continues to regenerate. In other words, in order to prevent it from regenerating, we first have to deal with the source of power, the Blue Celaeno Flower.\nYes, the conclusion. You have to pull out the flower first to get out of here.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Cedric also came to the same conclusion as me. However, instead of eliminating the flower, he took a defensive stance.\nChiirk!\nHe only avoided the attack of Monster Hell that began again, and seemed to have no intention of attacking.\n\u201cCedric, what are you doing? At this rate, it will only be resurrected again!\u201d\nHe shook his head with a stiff expression. A low desperate voice was added.\n\u201cI need that flower to save our Rona. We can\u2019t get rid of that.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nStand firm and defend against attacks. At first, Choi Cedric held out well. He cut the stem while avoiding the attack, and when it revived, he cut it again.\n\u201c\u2026Kugh!\u201d\nBut as time went on, his movements started to slow down a little.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nThe skin burned with an acrid smell. Choi Cedric does not move even though the pain must be considerable.\n\u201cStand back.\u201d\nChoi Cedric cut down the vines that attacked me while blocking the attack of Monster Hell. Still, there is no end to this. The cut-off vine quickly grew back, and it seemed that the monster piece of wood will never give up on today\u2019s main dish.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, are you planning to die here?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. But\u2026.\u201d\nHis gaze turned to the flower of the starlight in the distance. He knows. As long as the flower has already fused with the monster, it is difficult to separate it. Here, it is a rational choice to kill the boss, exit the dungeon, and retrieve the flower seed again.\nI\u2019m sure Choi Cedric knows, but\u2026.\nEven if he gets hurt, he doesn\u2019t want to give up medicine to save his sister. He can\u2019t cut the flower that can save his sister with his own hands.\nShush!\nAfter a moment of distraction, vines soared from the floor.\n\u201cHyaaah!\u201d\nAt that moment, Choi Cedric grabbed his sword and jumped up. It was as light a motion as flying.\nHe stepped on the branches of Monster Hell and took another leap. Avoiding the subsequent attack, he approached in an instant and stretched out his hand toward the Blue Celaeno Flower.\n10 meters, 5 meters, 1 meter \u2026 is it working?\n\u201c\u2026.! Keus!\u201d\nJust before he could touch the flower, the Monster Hell shook its body. His hand slipped down, clutching nothing but air.\nIt is difficult to pull out a single flower from the tip of a huge tree that moves violently without injury. Not to mention that it\u2019s a tree that spouts digestive juices too.\nA vine wrapped around Choi Cedric\u2019s body as he tried to make a leap again.\nSwoosh, bang!\nHe cut it straight away, but this time, it shoots digestive juices at the spot where he\u2019s about to land.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.!\u201d\nHis unprotected feet touched the digestive fluid sprayed on the floor. However, instead of attacking the Monster Hell, Choi Cedric took a defensive stance again.\nIf this is the case, there is no end. The only ending is waiting for the rescue and enduring the brunch of this monster and its minions.\nI had to make a move. I nervously carried on with my thoughts.\n\u201c\u2026.All right!\u201d\n\u2018The Bond of a Cup of Coffee.\u2019\n[Target: \u2018Choi Yichan\u2019 has been selected.]\nThe S-class Choi Yi-chan\u2019s skills will be helpful. That\u2019s what I thought.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cUmh\u2026..\u201d\nI turned off the system window without using Choi Yichan\u2019s skill. This is because all the skills that can be used were skills that strengthened original ability by multiples.\nEven if you inflate a dust, it\u2019s still a dust. With my 20 strength and +2 attack power, even if I use it multiple times, it would still be weaker than a single cut of Choi Cedric\u2019s sword.\nIt\u2019s not that Choi Cedric is weak in the first place, he isn\u2019t actually struggling with the Monster Hell.\nThe cooldown of \u2018The Bond of a Cup of Coffee\u2019 is 24 hours. I have to be careful because I can only use it once.\n\u2018Then what should I \u2026 huh?\u2019\n[The Bond of a Cup of Coffee (B)Details: (Lv.1) You can copy the skill of the person who drank the Ultimate Coffee. (00:05:00)Cooldown: 24:00:00\nAvailable for: Choi Yichan, Kim Taewoon.]\nI tried to turn off the unhelpful skill window right away, but an unfamiliar name caught my eye.\nKim Taewoon? Who was that? Was there such a person?\n\u201c\u2026..Ah.\u201d\nThat\u2019s right, it was the name of a journalist from Hunter Scope. Too many things happened in one day that I forgot about it.\nI thought it might be of some help, so I opened up the skill window.\n[Views Explosion! (F)(Lv.1) You can write an article that contains information about the target.There is no guarantee that the article is necessarily true.]\n[Paparazzi (E)(Lv.1) You can follow the target without being detected for a certain period of time.

This is why fake news is all over the world.\nFor a moment, I was busy complaining in my mind.\nWhile Monster Hell was persistently attacking today\u2019s main dish (Choi Cedric), there were the minions who were aiming for the side dish (me).\nSsssshk!\n\u201cHuaaaa!\u201d\nThey\u2019re the bug-type monsters. None of them are actually strong. However, the swarm of insects had its own visual pressure.\n\u201cHuah! Eh, F-killer!\u201d\nBut there is no such thing in the inventory.\nWiiiiing~\n\u201cGo away! Aahh!\u201d\nInstead, I took out the shovel and pounded the floor, but it was not enough to fight off the swift swarm of insects.\nThen\u2026.\nI used my skill towards an approaching swarm of bugs that\u2019s going to eat my flesh.\n\u2018Aaah! The Floor is Shiny!\u2019\nShashashak!\n\u201c\u2026.Huh?\u201d\nThe amorphous ether overturned the floor, and the bugs disappeared from the surroundings in an instant.\nThat was not the end. The skill stretched out to make the floor completely shiny.\nKeuoouooo!\nThe screams of Monster Hell rang out. All the roots that had fallen to the ground were cut off.\nIt tried to spread its roots again straight away, but not a single dust was allowed on the floor.\n[Next]\n\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Do you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d\nOf all things, talking about family here, he brought up the topic I don\u2019t want to think about the most.\nIt was a topic for a change of atmosphere and small talk, but I don\u2019t want to talk about it much. I blurted out my words vaguely.\n\n\u201cUh \u2026 what.\u201d\nHowever, Choi Cedric didn\u2019t seem to have much sense.\nSeriously, the S-classes don\u2019t have to be smart. Rather, the people around them must have been the ones who were busy reading the room.\nChoi Cedric, who didn\u2019t understand my subtlety at all, said proudly.\n\u201cLet\u2019s stay friendly. We only have one family.\u201d\n\u201cGosh, you\u2019re preaching when you\u2019re younger than me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Why am I younger than you\u2026.\u201d\nI raised my hand and pointed to the S-class in front of me and myself alternately. \n\u201cYou are twenty-two. I am twenty-three.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026.?\u201d\nAlthough there is only a year difference, Choi Cedric widened his eyes as if he had not thought of the possibility that I was older. I asked sulkingly at the startled face.\n\u201cI mean, do you think other people\u2019s families are similar?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s a family, it may or may not get along well. Still, isn\u2019t it worse to stay friendly when the relationship is bad?\u201d\nIt would be completely out of the blue to hear what he once boasted about his younger sister. Still, Choi Cedric nodded at my words with a serious expression.\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m sure there must be some people that are better off without their families.\u201d\n\u2026 just like our representative\u2019s family.\nThe murmur of words in his mouth sounded very small.\n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s true that we only have one family. No matter how you come to a conclusion, you should try what you can before that. So that you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWell\u2026\u2026\nI have nothing to say because he said the right thing.\nActually, there is one thing I keep thinking about these days. It\u2019s about Kwon Jiwoon.\nIf I recall how we were before the regression\u2026.\nI just \u2026 I lived a life pretending I didn\u2019t know him. Ever since I went to the guild and had a few fights.\n\u2018That\u2019s right, I don\u2019t want to owe something to my Hunter\u2019s relative.\u2019\nI\u2019ve had such a hard time. After I left the house we lived together, I\u2019ve just been careless. As long as we don\u2019t bump into each other, I won\u2019t get hurt, so I thought that was the best way.\nAnd now, I\u2019m back.\nOriginally, I was going to live as quietly as before, without bumping into each other. However, I couldn\u2019t help but be bothered by the ridiculous misunderstanding and his weird behaviour when I came to visit him recently.\n\u2018I can\u2019t hide my awakening forever\u2026.\u2019\nIt can\u2019t be helped if talking openly doesn\u2019t work. Still, before that, we have to talk to each other without hiding anything at least once.\nThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s true, but \u2026.\nIf I had put the right thing into practice right away, I would have been a person who never missed the summer vacation homework. And on the last day of each vacation, I wrote a month\u2019s worth of diary.\n\u201cAnyway! I\u2019ll think about it after I get out of here!\u201d\nChoi Cedric, as if he agreed with me, rose straight up. After pouring the coffee left in the cup into his mouth, he deactivated the barrier. The moment he tried to get rid of the insect-like monster flying around him with one hand and move again\u2026.\nThump, Thump, Thump.\nThe floor began to move with a heavy sound.\nA vine that rose nearby wrapped around my ankle and pulled it hard. Slowly, the body slides down the ramp.\n\u201cAaargh!\u201d\n\u201cUh, hey, there!\u201d\nSwing!\nChoi Cedric cut off the stem wrapped around my ankle with his sword.\nWhat would happen if you cut off the stem while the body is hanging in the air?\nPuck!\n\u201cUgh, Ouch, Ouch.\u2026.\u201d\nNaturally, it goes straight to the floor. I almost went to the afterlife before I even met the boss.\nBut there was no time to complain.\nThere was a strong smell of grass leaves, and at the same time I felt a sense of pressure.\n[Monster Hell (B) has appeared.][Monster Hell is currently starving.]\nThis is because the boss of the dungeon, Monster Hell, has appeared.\n***\nCrack!\nThe greenhouse glass shattered. Thick roots cut through the floor and long branches extended to the ceiling.\n\u201cAaah, no, my greenhouse!\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s a blue light flickers in the center.\n[Monster Hell is blooming. Dungeon: Monster Hell is activated.][Protective barrier during mealtime in Monster Hell: When eating, do not even touch the monster before it appears. Be careful not to disturb the meal of Monster Hell.]\nWhen Lee Chorok came to her senses, the two people who had just been here had already been sucked into the rift.\n\u201cNonsense \u2026 it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nLee Chorok covered her mouth with a trembling hand. When she got these seeds, she never imagined it would be like this.\nA few days ago, she was at a shopping street in Cheonggyecheon that she frequented. The Cheonggye 3-ga Monster Shopping District is narrowly between legal and illegal. The main items were animal-type monsters, but there were also shops selling dungeon plants from time to time.\n\u2018This is where the real rare items come out.\u2019\nThere are even rumors that a rare long-tailed phoenix was traded here.With the eyes of a hawk, Lee Chorok searched the sale discount stands. Then, there was someone who spoke to her.\n\u201cYou must be looking for dungeon plants.\u201d\u201cYes? How do you know that?\u201d\nLee Chorok looked back to the voice with wary. This is because there\u2019s a high probability that the first person to talk to her here is a scammer.A shop in the corner. There was a person there who somehow didn\u2019t seem alive. The eyes are expressionless, as if they had been pierced with glass eyes.\n\u2018\u2026\u2026!\u2019\nLee Chorok felt reluctant and tried to back down. However, the shopkeeper\u2019s next words stopped her.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember me?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen someone like you \u2026 Ah.\u201d\nAn unfamiliar memory flashed through her mind at that moment. Suddenly, the store owner in front of her felt very familiar.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met \u2026 A, aa, ah! I\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d\u201cLooks like you remembered me.\u201d\nWhy did she forget? It was definitely a regular store that she visited several times.The shopkeeper laughed and took out a box.\n\u201cA very rare item has arrived, how about it?\u201d\nIt was a seed the size of half a fist. When she put her hand on it, she could feel it the thumping from the inside.What this beat means is\u2026.\n\u2018\u2026\u2026!\u2019\nLee Chorok turned pale and pulled away. Dangerous. However, the shopkeeper only smiled.\n\u201cIt is the seed of Monster Hell.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a beat inside \u2026 This, this, no way\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYeah, a rift, it\u2019s integrated with a rift.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not possible. There\u2019s no chance for the rift to awaken because it\u2019s completely sealed.\u201d\n\u2026.Gulp.The seed with rift was emitting a strange light. The light is so beautiful that it\u2019s bewitching.\nEventually, Lee Chorok purchased the seed.\nIt is very rare for dungeon plants and rifts to be completely integrated. Since it\u2019s a rift and dungeon plant, the power of either side can grow, so even a slight loss of balance will cause the rift to burst. As a plant otaku, no, as a botanist, her curiosity could not turn away from the seed. \nFurthermore, the store owner\u2019s words somehow had a power that was hard to refuse. She brought the seed and kept it well.\n\u201cYou said it wouldn\u2019t burst\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe moment the Blue Celaeno Flower bloomed, the seed grew at a frightening speed and a dungeon occurred.\nIt was disconcerting, but the rescue of the people inside came first.\nWhen she reported it to the Dungeon Management Office, a public official hunter was dispatched shortly after.\nA large plant dungeon nestled in the middle of a greenhouse. Still, with Choi Cedric inside, there will be no casualties.\nHowever, as officials began to inspect the farm, Lee Chorok could not be relieved.\n\u201cMa\u2019am, where did you buy these toothed carrots?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 in Cheonggyecheon.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s in Cheonggyecheon? If you do not report after the transaction, you will be fined.\u201d\n\u201cI do not know \u2026  I don\u2019t remember that well, ha, ha, ha\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cToothed carrots must wear a muzzle. Your business will be suspended for not wearing them a muzzle.\u201d\n\u201cHaha, yes\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cYou acquired this dungeon plant through an illegal business.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a dungeon plant, it\u2019s a Flying Spaghetti Tree! A very precious tree that tells a Neapolitan ghost story once a day\u2026.!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u00a0haven\u2019t applied for permission to handle dungeon plants or registered your business. You didn\u2019t even pay your taxes.\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cPut it on.\u201d\nRed labels were attached here and there based on the cold-hearted public official\u2019s judgment. \u2018Foreclosure\u2018 in large letters.\n\u201cAa nooo!\u201d\nLee Chorok screamed.\nForeclosure tickets, penalty, fines, business suspension\u2026.\nEven if the dungeon situation was resolved, Lee Chorok was in a position to become a part-time worker at a fruit shop.\nShe got a Ph.D. in Dungeon Botany, but she\u2019s a part-timer at a fruit store!\nAll of her PhD classmates are frying chicken now, so it was a common career path.\nWhile a doctor changed course to a part-time fruit shop worker, a man hurriedly ran into the broken greenhouse.\nA pale face and a rough breath. It seemed that he had arrived immediately after receiving a call.\nLee Chorok was surprised to find out who the man was.\n\u2018Kwon Jiwoon of The White Silver Guild? Why is such a tycoon here\u2026.?\u2019\n\u201cIs the rescue going on?\u201d\nIt was a cold voice that couldn\u2019t hide the trembling. A pair of eyes filled with anxiety fluttered wildly. Kwon Jiwoon urgently asked the public official who was dispatched.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nDear MC, please give your cousin to me T__T \nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c57": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThere was only one way to escape from this place: Killing the dungeon boss of Monster Hell.\nThe problem was that it was difficult to find the main body of Monster Hell in this wide dungeon.\nI think we\u2019re on the right way, considering the steepness of the climb, but instead of the main body, only the stems and insects that spew digestive juices were visible.\nWhile climbing up the thick roots for a long time, Choi Cedric tapped me.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026.Why?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s rest here for a moment.\u201d\nThat\u2019s good to hear. There happened to be an empty space on one side without bugs or sticky liquids.\nAs Choi Cedric used a certain skill, a translucent barrier wrapped around him. Once I entered the barrier, there was less moisture and less sour smell inside, making it easier to breathe.\nI flopped down on the floor and caught my breath. When I wiped my sticky hands with the wipes I took out of my inventory, I felt like I could live a little. Perhaps because of the unique damp air, walking in the dungeon was more tiring than I thought.\nAs I caught my breath, I had a thought.\n\u2018I want to drink coffee\u2026.\u2019\nIf I can drink just one glass of iced Americano right now, I won\u2019t have any other wishes.\nEven if it wasn\u2019t an Americano made with skill, I might have put a Kanu Coffee in it, so I talked to Choi Cedric \u00a0while looking through inventory.\n\u201cThe outside must be in a chaotic situation by now because a dungeon suddenly appeared.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nBut there is no return answer.\n\u201cStill, since I came in with the No. 2 in the rankings, it\u2019s not such an emergency. Where did that plant otaku got something like this from?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWhy is there no answer?\nNo matter how hard I looked through the inventory, there was no Kanu.\nInstead, I took out the golden ticket that I got from the last quest.\n[Current number of Golden Draw Tickets owned: 1][Please pull the handle.]\nI was going to save it, but should I spin it now? I might get something better if I spin it in the dungeon.\nAfter taking a deep breath and calming my mind, it was the moment when I was about to draw with excitement.\n\u201c\u2026.He-hey.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nBut again, there is no answer.\nChoi Cedric messed up his hair, brushed it again with his hands, sighed, murmured something in his mouth, and finally opened his mouth again.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I grabbed you by the collar.\u201d\nAt a glance, he looked at me and then lowered his head again. Looking at his face, he seemed to be really sorry.\nI smiled and replied.\n\u201cNever mind. You apologized before. You must have been surprised when I suddenly burned the flower.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that flower\u2026.! Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pay you back for saving that flower when we go out here. Just say anything.\u201d\nI had already thought of the price I would ask him, but I asked out of curiosity.\n\u201cWhat can you give me?\u201d\n\u201cAny amount of money\u2026\u2026! No, it\u2019s too insincere to just pay for it with money.\u201d\nMy heart is pounding\u2026.!\n\u201cRight, how about joining our guild?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\nIf it\u2019s Choi Cedric\u2019s guild, it\u2019s C&L Corporation.\nThe largest of the Big Three guilds, the three stars of the Hunter Guild. Although it was systematic, it was famous for its tight atmosphere, such as performance pressure.\nOf course, I don\u2019t have any intention of joining that guild. Do they even accept an F-class?\nI stared at Choi Cedric. He has a slightly flamboyant face, but his eyes were sincere.\nSure, his guild is the best, so he seemed to believe that I would want to join the guild.\n\u201cI\u2019m an F-class?\u201d\nHe\u2019s not prejudiced in a weird way.\n\u201cWhat does the Grade have to do with it? You saved the Blue Celaeno Flower that even the plant otaku couldn\u2019t do. You\u2019re better than the plant otaku \u2026 yes, Plant Tentaku-nim!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI\u2019m not that kind of person\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Be confident. It\u2019s not something that anyone can do. Plant Tentaku-nim!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nOnly after pleading not to use such creepy expressions did Choi Cedric stop calling me that.\n\u201cAnyway, I have no intention of joining the guild.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? If it is my recommendation, you\u2019ll get the free pass for all the document screening, practical test, and interview.\u201d\nIt\u2019s kind of hard to say that I don\u2019t want to join his guild because it\u2019s tough. After a moment of contemplation, I opened my mouth.\n\u201cI am a free spirit\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cI have no intention of staying in one place. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to join the guild.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, then it doesn\u2019t matter. That would be nice.\u201d\nI was only half-joking, but, unexpectedly, Choi Cedric nodded his head obediently.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I envy you.\u201d\nThe words he added in such a way were deeply sincere.\n\u201cThis is what I want. I run a cafe.\u201d\n\u201cAh! You\u2019re going to open a chain store? The head office is a little difficult with my authority, but I can give you a seat in the branch office right away.\u201d\nAre all the rankers like this? I was taken aback by the sudden, ridiculously large-scale offer.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it! I was going to ask you to come as a guest sometimes\u2026..\u201d\nIt was at that moment when I was waving my hand to convey the exact meaning.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nTiling, the notification sounded.\n[You have acquired an item. Check your inventory.]\nHeck, I guess I pressed the draw button without realizing it while I was in the middle of the conversation.\nI tried to do the draw with a lot of excitement. The taste of the moment you spin it! That is the charm of Gacha!\nMy lucky draw!\n[Item: Simple Coffee Making Kit (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)]A portable coffee tool set that allows you to enjoy coffee anytime, anywhere.Now, enjoy coffee to your heart\u2019s content in the dungeon.Note: New user privilege! 1 serving of coffee ingredients included.]\nSoon, the regret was completely forgotten.\nThere was a coffee making kit in the inventory. With portable burners, moka pots and cups, enough coffee beans, and other ingredients to drink for one time.\nI grumbled that I wanted coffee and something like this came out. For some reason, something useful was selected.\n\u201cCedric, would you like some coffee?\u201d\n\u201cEh, now? Here? Not a buff potion, but coffee?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you drink it.\u201d\nI ignored Choi Cedric\u2019s eyes, who was looking at me with an absurd expression. A notification popped up the moment I took the coffee making kit out of my inventory and held it in my hand.\n[The condition has been met.][Skill: Dungeon Exploration After a Cup of Coffee (B) has been acquired.]\n[Dungeon Exploration After a Cup of Coffee (B)Details: (Lv.1) When making drinks in the dungeon, the level of perfection is increased.]\nUsing my new skill, I extracted espresso with mocka pot and made iced Americano. The fresh scent was relieving the fatigue. The effect of preventing energy consumption was applied immediately.\nI also handed an iced Americano to Choi Cedric. However, his eyes as he receives the cup shake anxiously.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You can\u2019t drink bitter coffee?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Who says I can\u2019t drink it?\u201d\nChoi Cedric snatched the cup and took a sip of coffee.\n\u2026 Gulp.\nHe tried to make a casual face, but it didn\u2019t last long. Seeing the astringent expression that could not be hidden, I searched the inventory while holding back my laughter.\n\u201cDo you want some sugar?\u201d\n\u201cHey, you should\u2019ve told me sooner if you have that!\u201d\nI also drank an iced Americano next to Choi Cedric, who added plenty of sugar to his cup.\nInsect-type monsters buzzing around the barrier, stems that shoot secretions, rocking floor \u2026 the scenery cannot be called pleasant even with empty words, but the coffee was delicious anyway.\nDrinking in the dungeon is quite tasteful\u2026.\nPuk!\nWiiing, pooh!\nA flying insect-type monster was hit by secretions. The leaves opened wide, snatching the melting insect and swallowing it. After the unpleasant squeaking sound, only the two wings of the insect-type monster were left.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s with the atmosphere\u2026..\nI lost my appetite for the Monster Hell\u2019s Meal Live Show.\nI can\u2019t wait to get out of here. After emptying all the cups, I called Choi Cedric next to me.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get going. I can\u2019t wait to get out of here \u2026 huh?\u201d\nIn the meantime, Choi Cedric was looking into his phone screen. There\u2019s no connection in the dungeon, but he looks very serious.\nAs an excuse, I didn\u2019t mean to look at it on purpose. The picture on the screen naturally caught my eye.\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! Wh-what are you doing? I was so surprised. Don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d\nIt feels unreasonable that an S-class hunter complains about being surprised by an F-class hunter.\n\u201cSorry. I won\u2019t look at it.\u201d\n\u201cEhem, hmm, if you want to see it, I can show you.\u201d\nSuddenly, the phone was pushed in front of me.\n\u201cIf you look at it a lot, it will wear you out,\u00a0so watch it carefully.\u201d\nAre you telling me to look or not?\nThere was a picture of a girl in the phone screen. Peach-colored cheeks, large eyes, and thick lips; she looks pretty cute. Is she a family? If you look closely, her eyes are similar to Choi Cedric\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cYour younger sister?\u201d\n\u201cYup. But when you say it like that.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she the cutest in the world? Honestly, isn\u2019t she an angel? She\u2019s my sister, but how can she be so pretty? Ah! She should have been a calendar model! Should I make a calendar now? But I can\u2019t let all the idiots see a picture of our Rona.\u201d\nHe poured ut a lot of silly comments without even blinking\u00a0an eye. Is it a joke? It\u2019s too much adoration for a younger sister.\n\u201cYes, I can make it a premium limited edition!\u201d\nNo, this is 100% pure sincerity. Look at his eyes. He\u2019s that man.\nChoi Cedric\u2019s words were not a lie, the girl in the picture was cute. She\u2019s definitely cute, but\u2026.\nChoi Cedric must be 22 years old now, but the girl in the picture looks pretty young. When I looked at it carefully, she seemed to be an elementary school student. Is she a younger sister with a big age difference?\n\u201cYour sister is really young?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that.\u201d\nChoi Cedric\u2019s face, who was pouring out old bulldozer comments with an excited look, quickly casted a shadow.\n\u201cThis \u2026 this is the only picture I took while she was awake.\u201d\nAh.\nWas this girl the sick family of Choi Cedric that Lee Chorok talked about?\n\u201cShe\u2019s 16 years old now.\u201d\nShe has to go to high school next year. Choi Cedric added with a bitter expression. He said that his younger sister, Choi Rona, suddenly fell asleep one day and did not wake up. He mobilized all available means, including potions and healers, but there was no improvement.\nSuddenly, I remembered the image of Choi Cedric before the regression, who had an attitude only for the Healers. Is this the reason he doesn\u2019t like Healer?\nIt\u2019s an unreasonable feeling, but there are moments when it\u2019s hard to endure without blaming someone.\n\u201cBut it will be alright when we go out here because you saved the Blue Celaeno Flower. With that, Rona will be comfortable.\u201d\nChoi Cedric, who forcibly shook off his depression with such words, suddenly changed the topic.\n\u201cHow about you?\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nTentaku: \uc2ed\ud0c0\ucfe0.

            "c56": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of people who say that. They were all scammers. How are you going to do something that even the plant otaku here couldn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cThen what if I succeed?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What nonsense\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, couldn\u2019t it be successful? Whether I succeed or fail, you won\u2019t lose anything, so why you don\u2019t just let me try?\u201d\n\nChoi Cedric looked at me with an expression that couldn\u2019t hide his agitation. Hope, and fear of having hope, a greater discouragement. Still, perhaps, the expectation that this time might be different.\nJust by seeing that complicated expression, I could guess what Choi Cedric had to go through. A similar thing must have happened many times during that time; having expectation, being disappointed, and looking forward again.\nSo far, this is the widely known image of Choi Cedric. An arrogant, impudent, tough-tempered Ranker.\nHowever, when I saw him in person, he felt more like a child.\n\u201cOkay! If you succeed, I\u2019ll do anything for you. Money? Connections? Just say anything.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll tell you what I want when I succeed.\u201d\nI have no choice but to try anyway.\nAfter taking a deep breath, I looked back at Choi Cedric and said,\n\u201cExcuse me \u2026 can you step back a little bit?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Why? Can\u2019t you save the flower when I look at it? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re trying to spy on this flower in secret?!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it \u2026 Well, I\u2019m nervous because I\u2019m close to a celebrity!\u201d\n\u201cSeriously, why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? You deserve to be nervous, ok, I understand! Now, is this enough?\u201d\nI can\u2019t believe this worked.\nI approached the pot after learning that Choi Cedric had taken about five steps apart.\nThe petals, which were originally blue, have dried up yellow, and the stem is likely to break at any moment.\nThe Blue Celaeno Flower is a flower with the power of regeneration.\nHowever, this flower was already dead from the time it was a seed. Thanks to Lee Chorok\u2019s care, it sprouted, but it withered in the end.\nSo what should we do to regenerate the flower?\nRegeneration presupposes death. In other words, you must die completely before you can be reborn. \nI brought Cthugha\u2019s ring close to the flower.\nHyurr.\nThe fire from the ring burned the flower in an instant.\nThe moment white ashes fell into the flowerpot.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Huck!\u201d\nChoi Cedric rushed in and pulled me by the collar. A powerful force lifted my feet from the floor. It\u2019s suffocating.\n\u201cChoi\u2501 Hunter Choi Cedric, calm down and let\u2019s talk first.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t I calm enough now?!\u201d\nHis eyes lost in anger.\nBut \u2026 he\u2019s controlling his strength. If I had been grabbed by the collar with the power of an S-class Hunter, I would have gone to the other world.\n\u201cYou! Why did you burn the flower?! Don\u2019t you know what kind of flower that is?! I\u2019ll let you go, depending on your answer!\u201d\n\u201cUgh \u2026 that \u2026 cough, cough!\u201d\n\u201cAnswer me!\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t open my mouth because I was suffocated by the tremendous power. The best thing I managed to do is pointing to the flowerpot with only the tip of my finger raised.\n\u201cHuk, Hunter Choi Cedric, look at this!\u201d\nLee Chorok made a startled sound.\n\u201cIt is not! The flower!\u201d\n\u201cWhat? \u2026..Ah.\u201d\nChoi Cedric\u2019s eyes widened.\nThud.\nHe let go of the strength in his hand. If it had been a little later, I would have really passed out from lack of oxygen.\nThat\u2019s why I deliberately told you to step away, but it didn\u2019t work.\n\u201cCough, cough! Huk, I thought I was going to die! Coughl!\u201d\nI coughed exaggeratedly on purpose. Every time I coughed, Choi Cedric\u2019s face turned white. In terms of powder pact, I think it will be around number 13.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, before \u2026 I thought you killed the flower \u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, let\u2019s look at the flower quickly.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, yes!\u201d\nA yellow-green bud sprouted over the potted plant spilled with white ashes.\nThe buds grew rapidly in an instant, extended the stem and leaves, and eventually bloomed a blue flower.\nThe blue petals with a soft light looked very mysterious.\n[Item: Blue Celaeno Flower (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605)A legendary flower that is said to contain the starlight of Celaeno. It has the power of regeneration.Note: Fresh.]\nThe contents of the status window have also changed.\n\u201cFinally, with this flower\u2026.!\u201d\nThe moment when Choi Cedric, who was moved, was about to embrace the flowerpot.\nKukukung!\nA heavy vibration was heard, and the soil of the pot began to soar toward the sky.\n\u201cHuh, uh\u2026.?\u201d\nA thick root that stretches out mercilessly far.\nThere was another plant under the Blue Celaeno Flower. The plant, which absorbed the power of the flower, began to grow wildly, destroying the greenhouse, and wrapping it around with roots.\n\u201cAaaah, no, my greenhouse!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Dodge!\u201d\nCrash!\nAnd that blue light flickering in the middle of the plant\u2019s roots\u2026.\nIt\u2019s a rift.\nBoom, boom! The branches cut through the ceiling and the roots dig up the ground.\nAh. I remember.\nThe reason why Lee Chorok\u2019s farm was closed before the regression. That\u2019s because a dungeon occurred on the farm.\nThere was no time to escape. I was just sucked into the dungeon.\nSlurp!\nThe body, sucked into the rift, slid down the stem. I lost my balance and fell flat on the floor.\n\u201cOuch\u2026..\u201d\nThe surroundings were dark and bumpy, just like the roots of a very large tree, and there was a smell of musty grass from somewhere.\nThe sour smell that stung my nose, the damp air, and the wriggling floor.\nThis was a dungeon formed inside a plant.\nVery rarely, it is said that some rifts are hidden in grass or trees. It is usually safe to prevent the parent plant from bursting into a rift.\nBut what happens if the plant is exposed to dark ether? The plan and the rift fuse, and the plant itself becomes a dungeon.\nA rift was hidden in one of the dungeon plants that Lee Chorok grew, and dark ethers were released in the greenhouse to help the plant grow.\nLater, as the ether was absorbed, the plant turned into a dungeon. As a result, Happy Green Life Farm was closed.\nThis is the end of this business that I remember from the pre-regression.\nThat plant otaku is really\u2026.\nHowever, due to the regenerative power of the Blue Celaeno Flower, the rift broke earlier than before the regression, and I was caught up in the situation.\nUsually, normal dungeonized plants are not so dangerous.\nThe question is \u2026 what kind of plant was the basis of this dungeon\u2026..\nTiling!\n[Dungeon: You have entered Monster Hell.][Monster Hell is currently starving.]\nThe name of the dungeon appeared in the notification window.\nUh, monster hell\u2026\u2026?\nWait, let\u2019s get this straight.\nAn insectivorous plant that secretes digestive juices and eats flies is called Flies Hell. \nThen, monster hell is the plant that secretes digestive juices and eats monsters.\nThe possibility that a plant that melts monsters can melt humans is..\u2026?\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nHiss!\n\u201cAaa, aaagh!\u201d\nThe vines of the plants that stretched out forward fired secretions. The secretions spilled on the floor sizzled and melted the surroundings. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be okay if I get hit.\nThen, the alarm rang again.\n[Monster Hell is currently starving.]\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSave me!\u201d\nI tried to save a flower, but I woke up something I shouldn\u2019t have woken up.\nWhen I was horrified as I imagined the future me melting without a trace inside this giant plant, I heard a voice next to me.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cUh, huh, oh?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you look like you saw a ghost? You\u2019re not going to make any difference.\u201d\n\u201cHuh \u2026 Choi Cedric?\u201d\nTak, he grabbed the stem in the air and landed on the floor. Unlike me who fell down, it was a stable landing. His score is about 9.5 out of 10.\n\u201cSheesh, it bothered me that a civilian also came in.\u201d\nThere is no one else. Fortunately, Lee Chorok doesn\u2019t seem to be getting caught up.\n\u201cDo you have any weapons or items that you can use?\u201d\n\u201cHmm \u2026 This?\u201d\nI took out the +2 attack shovel from my inventory and showed it to him.\n\u201cHuh? Really? Is this an item?\u201d\nHe looks like he\u2019s never seen an item like this before. He looks around the seedling shovel and admires it as if it were a strange thing. When he returned it, he said,\n\u201cYou must have been very surprised, but calm down and trust me! Huahaha!\u201d\nI thought you\u2019d laugh at me.\n\u2018As expected\u2026.\u2019\nI added confidence to the discomfort I felt earlier.\nThe No. 2 ranker, Hunter Choi Cedric of C&L Corporation. Numerous personality controversies that followed the name crossed my mind.\nCompared to the personality controversy, I think he\u2019s kind\u2026.\nAt that time.\nCrash, pugh!\n\u201cHuaaaa!\u201d\nChoi Cedric laughed when he saw me jumping back in surprise at the pouring secretion for the second time.\n\u201cWhy are you screaming all of a sudden? Are you scared?\u201d\n\u201cHey, look at all this grass that\u2019s spraying water. If it hits me, I\u2019ll melt and become manure for this dungeon!\u201d\n\u201cOh, that one?\u201d\nSheeng.\nAs he replied indifferently, he drew out his sword and swung it. Two times exactly on both sides and up and down. A sword almost the size of Choi Cedric\u2019s, as light as a fly swatter.\nCrunch!\nThe leaves that spit out secretions were destroyed.\n\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d\nChak, he returned to his previous position and put the sword around his waist. He brushes his slightly messy hair with his hand and smiles brightly. As if now is the time to admire.\nWhat is this weird feeling\u2026.\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s really great. It\u2019s so cool.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Ehem, hmm!\u201d\nEven with words that didn\u2019t contain much soul, an indescribable joy spread across Choi Cedric\u2019s face.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I have Hunter Choi Cedric. I\u2019m relieved.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. You only need to trust me!\u201d\nDidn\u2019t he usually get a lot of compliments \u2026 he shrugged his shoulders and walked away.\nI see. I know what this feels like.\nHe looks a bit like my house cat.\n\u2018Suddenly, the No. 2 Ranker feels familiar.\u2019\nAnyway, entering this strange plant dungeon was at first bewildering, but I soon regained my composure.\nLee Chorok will protect the Blue Celaeno Flower well. All I have to do is get out of here and there\u2019s no reason to be scared because I\u2019m with the second most famous Hunter in Korea after Muwon.\nCrack!\nSlid, kaaang!\nCrush!\nHe proceeded forward, slashing the leaves and stems that spewed out secretions.\n\u201cHuh! Over there! Behind you!\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\nShush, bang!\nIn Monster Hell, there were parasitic insect-type monsters. However, \u00a0However, they died at one stroke of Choi Cedric\u2019s sword and became manure.\nIs this how it feels to ride an express bus?\nIgnoring the road, he cuts off the roots and stems in front of him and proceeds. The Munchkin\u2019s companion experience was amazing. This must be why movies where the main character just smashes everything are popular.\nI also felt the refreshing procession of destruction briefly.\nHowever, this Monster Hell dungeon was bigger than I thought. I walked on the uneven roots for a long time, but I still couldn\u2019t see the end.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nOtaku (\uc624\ud0c0\ucfe0) is a Japanese word for people who have an obsessive interest in a specific object, mainly Japanese manga and anime fans.

His job is writing low-level articles to earn views, in other words, he\u2019s a trash journalist. He said that he came here while investigating the site of the smuggling of illegal monsters.\nAfter talking to himself for a long time, the customer\u2019s face looked very clear when he raised his head.\nA pair of burdensome twinkling eyes.

No way \u2026 did the lemonade purify the journalist\u2019s mind?\nThe journalist ahjussi exclaimed with flawless, clear eyes.\n\u201cThank you! You opened my eyes.

Then, I\u2019ll get going!\u201d\nThe last words were so shaky to the point of being hard to understand. The journalist ahjussi quickly packed his bag and left the store.\nI was wondering if I should keep listening to the pouring TMI, it\u2019s a relief that I\u2019m lucky.\n\u201cDid you know that man?\u201d\n\u201cIn the past, we had bumped into each other because of an information gathering.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cHunter Scope, which he belongs to, is a little famous.

It was a false initials article with no basis.\n\u201cI applied for a restraining order because he was so persistent.\u201d\n\u201cHee \u2026 what kind of information he gathered?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad Rieul-ssi is okay.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a pity that he changed the topic. Hmm, he said he came all the way here because he was worried, so should I skip it?\n\u201cBut it will be fine now.\u201d\nBecause the journalist has been completely purified by the power of lemonade.

Lee Chorok tried to cover one side in a hurry, but I had already seen it.\nThe appearance of the farm was quite different from when I came before. Above all, a large plant at the entrance stood out.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cAh, customer-nim! You have a god eye. This is a Flying Spaghetti Tree!

The inside of the store was filled with a sweet and sour scent.\nI declared in a solemn voice, with a fake lemon in one hand and baking soda in the other.\n\u201cSo, are you all ready?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d\n\u201cNyaaa (Of course)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nA temporary part-timer (characteristic: S-class hunter) and the two others answered energetically.\nI decide to make Lemon Chung with all the picked fake lemons.\nIf I leave it, it\u2019ll only expire.\nI need lemon syrup to make lemonade anyway, so it\u2019s good to make a lot and drink it over and over again.\nSo today, we are going to deal with this mountain of fake lemons together.\nIt is cumbersome because of the large amount, but it is not difficult to make lemon chung. The first thing to do is to clean the fake lemon.\n\u201cSee, this is how you do it.\u201d\nI soaked the fake lemon in water with baking soda and washed it with my hands. After watching me, Choi Yichan also dipped the fake lemon in water.\n\u201cEung, like this\u2026.\u201d\nSquelch.\nThe fake lemon was crushed in Choi Yichan\u2019s palm because he put too much strength.\n\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d\nAs a result, the juice of the fake lemon flew into Choi Yichan\u2019s eyes accurately.\n\u201cHuk, Yichan-ah, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, it stings, heugh.\u201d\n\u201cHurry, wash it with water. Hurry.\u201d\nThanks to his strong S-class body, he got better soon, but\u2026.\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s do it again. Just relax your hands and wash them gently. Gently.\u201d\n\u201cEung, gently\u2026.\u201d\nSquelch.\n\u201cAaaaaah!\u201d\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nThe same thing happened over and over again, and only after both eyes became bright red did Choi Yichan give up washing the lemon.\nIt seems that the strength is not properly controlled yet. Life isn\u2019t easy even for an S-class.\n\u201cHaha \u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nWith a gloomy expression, he hung down his head.\nI quickly pushed his back, fearing that he might become as depressed as yesterday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can help me with something else. Just go over there and rest, okay?\u201d\nAfter leaving Choi Yichan, who retires like that, the remaining labor force is\u2026.\n\u201cWaeoong, Waeoong (It smells good)!\u201d\nA cat is playing while rolling a fake lemon with its front paw.\n\u201cKyuuuu!\u201d\nA slime that spreads its body like a membrane, swallows the fake lemon, and then spits out only the seeds.\nLet\u2019s just do it by myself\u2026\u2026.\nNow it is just one F-class cafe owner with one power and two pets.\nIt\u2019s weird. I decided to live a life of working less and resting more, specifically, working two days a week and taking five days off.\nWhy am I washing a large amount of fake lemons after picking them up in the morning?\nI felt more and more drawn into this system and quests.\n\u2018Maybe I\u2019m the problem\u2026.?\u2019\nAfter washing the fake lemon thoroughly in water mixed with baking soda, I rinsed it once with water, and the cleaning process was finished.\nIf it\u2019s a bought lemon, I\u2019ll need to wash it more, but since this is a freshly picked fruit, this should suffice.\nNext, it was time to cut the fake lemon into slices. After wiping off the water, cut the top of the fake lemon and discard it, then cut it into 0.3 cm thick slices.\nChoi Yichan, who was aiming for an opportunity to intervene, promptly offered to help. But\u2026..\nPuck!\nHe had to give up because the fake lemon was minced instead of sliced.\nWhat, isn\u2019t it okay because that means you can cut monsters that aren\u2019t fake lemons well?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, again\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Can you play with Mieum and Lime for a bit?\u201d\nBGM is heard behind my back as I sliced the fake lemon.\nTadadadak!\n\u201cUnyaaaaa!\u201d\n\u201cKyuuu! Kyuuu!\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, you guys, one at a time.\u201d\nThrough the window in front of me, I can see the huge stone wall of the Great Dungeon Abyss, and there\u2019s a lively cry behind me. There\u2019s also a tak, tak, tak sound as the lemon was cut in cutting board.\nIt\u2019s so peaceful\u2026\u2026.\nAh, just to avoid misunderstanding, I\u2019m not saying that I hate peace.\nA life of eating well, resting well, playing well, and cutting fake lemons into thin slices. It is truly a life suitable for a regressor. This F-class regressor wants to rest.\nRemove the seeds from the sliced \u200b\u200bfake lemon and place it in a large bowl. Then, pour sugar equal to the weight of the fake lemon and mix well. It took quite a while to finish it up to here because of the large amount.\nWhile waiting for the sugar to melt for a while, I got a little hungry.\nWell, let me try one.\nI picked up a slice of fake lemon mixed with sugar and took it to my mouth.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe first thing I tasted was a thrilling sour taste. Then, the sweetness that neutralizes the sourness filled the mouth, and the rich citrus scent cleared my head.\nIt is delicious to eat as it is, but it will taste even better if it is aged.\nAfter boiling it in hot water, wiping the sterilized jar well, and then filling it with sugar-pickled fake lemon, the making of lemon chung completed.\nI looked at the lemon chung jar neatly placed on the shelf. Just looking at the golden shining jar in the midday light gave me peace of mind.\nWell, it\u2019s peaceful. Really.\n***\nI was alone in the store that evening when I promised the regular customer a taste of the new menu.\nIt\u2019s because Choi Yichan, who was here with me until now, has returned.\n\u201cAre you going now? Where are you going?\u201d\u201cHahahaha! No, it\u2019s okay! I have a place to sleep!\u201d\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you still looking for a house? Where are you living now?\u201d\u201cThe earth, the wind is with me! Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cWait, don\u2019t say anything weird. Where do you really spend your time? Yichan-ah?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going, see you tomorrow!\u201d\nBut he left only a cheerful smile behind.\nIs he really okay? He\u2019s  a little strange these days\u2026.\nMy friend\u2019s Hunter Grade went up and he suddenly became weird, what should I do?\nI\u2019ll question him in more detail tomorrow, anyway.\n\u201cWelcome.\u201d\n\u201cThat thing, please give me what we talked about before.\u201d\nThe customer in the fishing vest showed up on time. Without saying anything else, he sat down and asked for the drink.\nDid you expect it that much? Then, I have to live up to your expectations.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nLemon Chung: Chung\u00a0means\u00a0\u2018preserved with sugar in a jar\u2018. Taken from (as usual) Wikipedia,  Chung/Cheong (\uccad; \u6df8) is a name for various sweetened foods in the form of syrups, marmalades, and fruit preserves. In Korean cuisine, cheong is used as a tea base, as a honey-or-sugar-substitute in cooking, as a condiment, and also as an alternative medicine to treat the common cold and other minor illnesses. Originally, the word cheong (\uccad; \u6df8) was used to refer to honey in Korean royal court cuisine.\n\noh, and my WiFi got fixed, but apparently I\u2019m unlucky to get a room where the signal is poor LOL\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c53": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nHowever, there was one thing that bothered me to send them like this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s night time, can we just send the children? It\u2019s close to the store here, so let\u2019s take them with us.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun smiled bitterly.\n\u201cThey are young, but they are hunters. The road at night is nothing for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. They might be hunters, but they\u2019re still children.\u201d\nThe twins I had seen before the regression flashed before my eyes. The soulless eyes that seem to be disillusioned with the world bothered me.\nI can\u2019t let them change like that. I wanted to protect that lively and innocence that still remains. Children have to live a life of watching children\u2019s animations at 5 p.m. after school and wondering about what would they eat for dinner.\nAs long as they become a hunter belonging to a guild, there may be difficulties to do all of that in reality, but children are still children.\n\u201cHunter Ki Yoohyun-nim is right.\u201d\n\u201cWe can go on our own.\u201d\n\u201cReally? That\u2019s too bad. I was going to make you a hot vanilla latte if you stop by.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Vanilla latte?\u201d\nThe twins\u2019 eyes shook wildly. They looked as if they wanted to eat.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a vanilla latte. They said I can\u2019t eat it yet because I\u2019m young.\u201d\u201cEndure it, you idiot! I\u2019ve never tried it either.\u201d\nI could hear all the whispers.\n\u201cAh, there are butter cookies, too.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nA few seconds to wander between desire and patience.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026it\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\u201cRight. We won\u2019t disturb you!\u201d\nGee, patience won.\nThe twins walked away with a same bustling gait as they did when they appeared.\nWell, it\u2019s no big deal. Next time I see them, I\u2019ll have to feed them sweet drinks and snacks.\n***\nI walked on the way back to the store side by side with Ki Yoohyun.\nAround the Dungeon Gate, where buildings and cars are gradually decreasing. Only the dimly lit streetlightslights illuminated the way. The shadow lengthened and shortened as we walked.\nSurprisingly, there is really nothing. It\u2019s such a quiet place in the middle of Jung-gu, Seoul.\nStrictly speaking, the Dungeon Gate of the dungeon \u2018Abyss\u2019 was not a part of Seoul City. That huge dungeon appeared by tearing and distorting the surrounding space.\nTherefore, the shape of the map of Seoul changed before and after the creation of Abyss. An open space between City Hall Station and Hoehyeon Station as if both ends were pulled by hand. The place painted with a black square box is Dungeon Gate 3.\nStill, since it is located in Seoul, development is made for accessibility, but the reason why there is no convenience store is clear.\nThe smell of air changes slightly as you walk toward the center. The color of the soil that is stepped on by the feet is also different. There was an unknown dungeon in this place.\nA huge stone wall that has not been revealed what lies at the end of it. A person with a sensitive temperament feels scared just by looking at it.\n\u2018For that matter, I didn\u2019t have any problems\u2026.\u2019\nI slept well, ate well, played well, hmm.\nAs silence came, I naturally paid attention to the sound of footsteps next to me.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who took my goods at his own will, remained silent for a while.\nCome to think of it, it\u2019s been a while since I met Ki Yoohyun. This is the first time since we separated in front of Grandma Kim Deokyi\u2019s workshop the day after the fire.\nThe moment I was slightly distracted by the shadow on his face.\n\u201cRieul-ssi.\u201d\nA calm call came to my ears.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cYou said something earlier.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cEven if they\u2019re hunters, they\u2019re still children.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\nI turned my head and looked at him. Beyond the glasses that couldn\u2019t hide the gorgeous face at all, the bright eyes stared at me.\n\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\nThe answer to the question came out quickly.\n\u201cI do. Just because your body is strong doesn\u2019t mean your mind is also strong.\u201d\n20 years since the Great Dungeon appeared. Young Awakened was no longer unusual or rare. Awakening is a coincidence or fate that can happen to anyone regardless of age.\nRifts keep popping up, and the world wants a Hunter. My words may sound absurd in this situation where you have to face death if you don\u2019t deal with rifts in time.\nHowever, I think it is harsh for children, who are curious about dinner side dishes or watching children\u2019s animation after school, to face monsters.\nOf course, there are minimal safeguards. Awakened people under the age of 12 cannot belong to a guild and are required to be protected by the Dungeon Management Office. Even so, this is not enough.\nSome children are forced by their parents. Some children mistake it for their own will. Some children enter the dungeon because they want to be praised.\nThe twins Joo Shinwoo and Joo Shinhee are no exception. If I remember it correctly, they\u2019re 14 years old this year. They\u2019re still pretty young.\nWhat the hell happened in the past three years that changed their personality that much? Did Cheongna Guild overwork them? I didn\u2019t think the No. 1 guy would be like that, but is he actually a vicious guild leader?\nKi Yoohyun spoke again while I was busy accusing the No. 1 ranker, whom I\u2019ve never met, in my head.\n\u201cRieul-ssi may be different, but \u2026 Hunters are often said to lack a bit of humanity.\u201d\nHis words were understandable. The human mind is more influenced by the body than we think. The strong power, the dungeon experience, and changes in the surrounding environment are obviously damaging to the mind. \nWait a minute, but what\u2019s the word in the front of his sentence? Did he say that I may be different because I\u2019m an F-class?\nKi Yoohyun\u2019s words continued.\n\u201cThe same goes for those kids. They look like that, but there is a part in their heart that is worn out and dull. Nevertheless, do you still think so?\u201d\nA cautious tone, as if to confirm an important fact. The bright eyes gazed at me.\nI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s asking me this, but I only have one answer anyway.\n\u201cOf course, then you should treat them better. Awakening doesn\u2019t mean you become a different being, right? That\u2019s what adults do.\u201d\nI can\u2019t do this. Next time I see the twins, I\u2019m not going to just feed them snacks, but I\u2019m going to make them watch an animation VOD for children. It should be prepared with exciting content that cannot be stopped once played.\nTiling!\nThen, suddenly, a system notification sounded.\n[A quest has occurred.][Sub Quest: Lady of the Children\u2019s HeartYou value children. Let\u2019s present good memories to the targets1.Feed snacks to the target: 0/1\n1 Joo Shinwoo, Joo ShinheeReward: None.]\nUnusually, it was a quest without a reward.\nThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not because I want to be rewarded, but because I can be nice to them with pure kindness. If it can help the twins\u2019 mental health in three years, that\u2019s enough.\nWhen I meet the twins again, let\u2019s complete it. This system has always been a nuisance, but sometimes it does a good job.\nTurning off the quest window, I noticed that Ki Yoohyun was still looking at me.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Were you touched by what I said?\u201d\nAs an excuse, it was only a joke. I didn\u2019t say anything special, so it\u2019s just a light conversation to be laughed on before we moved on to another topic.\nIt seems that my intention was not conveyed to Ki Yoohyun at all. He was silent for a while, as if he was tracing some memory, and then he opened his mouth.\n\u201cYes, I think so. No, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m touched.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nNo, this guy is really\u2026.\nIt was a perfect atmosphere to tackle right now. What if I suddenly become serious? Don\u2019t you know Tiki-Taka?\nI lost my words and kept my mouth shut.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nWhat are we going to do with this atmosphere?\n***\nFortunately, it was only a short way to the store. On the remaining road where the early winter wind was quite chilly, I walked with Ki Yoohyun while telling him about the recent situation.\nThere\u2019s nothing much to say about my recent situation. I can\u2019t tell the story of Choi Yichan, who claimed to be a temporary part-timer to avoid the annoyance around him, so all that\u2019s left is the story of a new regular customer.\n\u201c\u2026.so I was on my way back after getting the ingredients to make lemonade.\u201d\nAs I reached the front door of the store, I reached out to ask for my goods.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, is there any chance that the guest \u2026 was he a man in his 40s wearing a fishing vest?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, that\u2019s him.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun was looking at the bushes across from the store.\nWe don\u2019t have to talk face to face, but why do you have to look over there? What is there?\n\u201cDoes he have a scar on his face?\u201d\n\u201cUmh \u2026 come to think of it, there was a scar\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you decide to try the new menu?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in 7 days \u2026 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI happen to have time that day, so I\u2019d love to try Rieul-ssi\u2019s new menu too.\u201d\nIt\u2019s weird. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s smiling, but why did I feel so cold?\n***\nThe next day.\nAfter waking up leisurely and eating breakfast, I went into the space to find a place to plant the sapling of the Purifying Tree.\nIt was narrow because of Yggdrasil that occupied most of this space, but if I look carefully, I will find a place to plant a tree.\n\u201cAh, this will do.\u201d\nI looked inside this space and found the right place. Next to the field planted with Dungeon Sugarcanes, there was a perfect empty space for planting a tree.\nI squatted down, dug up the soil with a shovel, and planted the sapling. I asked a question to Mieum, who was rolling around next to me, while gently covering the soil.\n\u201cYou know, when someone becomes a Hunter, do they sometimes lose their humanity?\u201d\nWhat I was going to ask was about what Ki Yoohyun said yesterday.\n\u201cHunters are often said to lack a bit of humanity.\u201d\nIt was a calm and subdued voice, unlike his usual loose appearance. The refined tone strangely lingered on my mind.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing!\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, some people may have different personalities, but it\u2019s more like revealing one\u2019s true nature when the poor get rich, or when the people at the bottom get power.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it depends on someone\u2019s personality?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026.\u201d\nMieum-ah, I get anxious when you blur your words like that.\n\u201cWhen you make a \u2018contract\u2019 with a Great Old One, if you sympathize with the Great Old One too much, you may lose your original self as a result of that influence.\u201d\nUh, what did you just say? Suddenly, two unfamiliar words appeared.\n\u201cWho is the Great Old One?\u201d\n\u201cKiyaoo! Don\u2019t you know that, it\u2019s common sense!\u201d\n\u201cI think you and I have a different range of common sense.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think the Awakeneds can just use the skills? All are empowered by the Great Old Ones! Among them, there are cases where they give more special power to a contractor through a \u2018contract\u2018, waeeong!\u201d\n\u201cHmm \u2026 so, is it an incredibly strong being that gives you power? Something like the one who works behind the scene or The Holy See?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes they call it that, waeeong!\u201d\nIt looks pretty good just from the explanation.\n\u201cCan I do that too?\u201d\nIt was only a question out of mild curiosity. However, Mieum and Lime became quiet at the same time.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u2026.?\u201d\nFor a moment, there was only silence.\n\u201cKkyuu! kkyuuuu!\u201d\nLime began to cry with great force.\n\u201cUh, huh, what?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu! kkyuu! kkyuuu!\u201d\nIt bounces its body and raised the volume of the cries. However, there were no words that I could understand other than \u2018Kyuuu\u2018.\nSorry. Lime, I don\u2019t know what you mean.\n\u201cKyuuuu!\u201d\nI wish I have a slime translator.\u2026.\n***\nAfter gently covering the roots with soil with a seedling shovel and pouring the water from a plastic bottle, the planting of the Purifying Tree was completed.\nThe sun is warm, the wind blows gently, and the soil is moist. It will grow well here.\nThere was some space left next to it, so I moved the tooth carrot and planted it. It\u2019s hard to keep what I received. No, I don\u2019t want to keep it.\n\u201cShush, shoo, shush, shoo, shush, shush, shush.\u201d\nMom, the carrots make strange noises and cries\u2026.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it grows well or not.\nI checked the status window of the Purifying Tree right away.\nHowever, there was one big problem.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThe quest name, Lady of the Children\u2019s Heart is actually not a 100% correct translation (or at least, I\u2019m not sure). It\u2019s \ub3d9\uc2ec\uc5ec\uc120, i\u2019m not sure what\u2019s that supposed to mean but \ub3d9\uc2ec is children\u2019s heart and \uc5ec\uc120 is related to female / women, so I translated it like that to suit the story. ISTG, I spent two hours to think about this one.\nHowever, the \ub3d9\uc2ec\uc5ec\uc120 here definitely refers to the epitaph of Bang Jeonghwan, a pioneer of Korean juvenile literature and a children\u2019s rights activist, who led the establishment of Children\u2019s Day in Korea. That\u2019s the phrase that was written on his tombstone, taken from the Chinese character \u7ae5\u5fc3\u5982\u4ed9, meaning \u2018a child\u2019s heart is like freshness\u2019.\nTiki-Taka (\ud2f0\ud0a4\ud0c0\uce74) derives from a football term. It refers to short quick passes to move the ball down the field. In conversation, it means back and forth.

Choi Cedric burst out in anger.\n\u201cThen are you saying that you guys just sucking your fingers when Rona is in pain?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no! How could we? We\u2019ve been using healing skills.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I have run out of mana, so I can\u2019t use it anymore\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Cedric grabbed the Healer\u2019s neck before he could even finish speaking.\n\u201cWhat? Out of mana? Say it again.\u201d\n\u201cUh \u2026 Ugh.\u201d\nHe knocked the Healer\u2019s body to the floor. He grabbed his head with one hand and threw him to the floor. Although he did not use any special skills, the overwhelming status of an S-class Hunter was enough to put pressure on the Healer by itself.\nBugh! His body fell like a leaf.\nRegardless of the pain, Choi Cedric gave strength to his grip.\n\u201cUh\u2026 Ugh! Ugh!\u201d\nHis neck fits tightly into the palm of Cedric\u2019s hand. The Healer, who belatedly realized that he was holding his leash, trembled like an aspen.\n\u201cYou say, \u2018I can\u2019t use my skills because my mana is low\u2019. Then, is there any reason for you to stay here?\u201d\nSheeng.\nChoi Cedric drew his sword. The moment he saw that silver blade, the Healer turned white. Cut. This man is really thinking of cutting him.\n\u201cAh \u2026 no, no. I can use \u2026 I-I will use\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nWhen he stood up again, the Healer\u2019s face was a mess of blood and tears. He slapped his cheek with his hand, he was so nervous that he almost fainted.\nHe can\u2019t use the skill at this rate. Swish. Choi Cedric threw the healer away. In turn, he spoke while looking at another Healer, who was shaking in the corner.\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Hick!\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cHuk, I-I will use it! I can do it!\u201d\nThe agitated Healer reached out to Choi Rona and cast a skill. The previous skill use had already exhausted her mana to the bottom and she was dizzy, but there was no other way. If she doesn\u2019t use her skill, she\u2019ll end up like the other healer who fell to the floor.\n\u201cUh \u2026 ugh, uhh, heugh!\u201d\nThe white light from her fingertips swam through the air. However, the light of healing disappeared without being absorbed by Choi Rona as if it were blocked by something.\n\u201cUgh \u2026 cough, cough!\u201d\n\u201cContinue.\u201d\nOnce again. One more time\u2026.\nThe Healer, who reached her limit, poured out her skills until she vomited blood, but there was no change. Choi Rona still looked in pain.\nChoi Cedric looked at the figure quietly.\n\u2018Useless things.\u2019\nHe always thought about it when he was injured during battle in dungeon and got treated with healing skills. They\u2019re useless.\nNo matter how badly injured he was, he healed quickly when he received the healing skill. Every time he saw the cuts that were deep enough to show the bones heal and the flesh fills in, Choi Cedric felt disgusted and couldn\u2019t stand it.\nHe wanted to cure his sister\u2019s illness instead of this insignificant injury, but they couldn\u2019t save the only person he wanted to be healed.\n\u2018If only I have that flower\u2026.\u2019\nBlue Celaeno flower. It was the only medicine that worked for his sister\u2019s illness.\nIf only that flower could be saved, at least \u2026 he would be able to take away the pain that tormented Rona.\nWhat are you dreaming about? Would you resent me for not being able to do anything in your dreams?\nHe didn\u2019t cry. Choi Cedric looked at his sister\u2019s thin face with dry eyes.\nAfter a while, Choi Rona\u2019s seizures stopped. he eyelids were still tightly closed,, but the screams and convulsions died down.\nIt was already midnight when he left the hospital room after wiping her wet forehead in cold sweat.\nAs he closed the door to her room carefully so as not to make a sound, someone approached him.\n\u201cI heard you had another fight?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.CEO-nim.\u201d\nIt was Lee Sein, the CEO of C&L Corporation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to scold you to the extent of being angry. It was a bit noisy today.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Cedric drooped his shoulders as if a thorn had fallen out in front of Lee Sein. A bitter smile appeared on Lee Sein\u2019s lips.\n\u201cHow is Rona?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a little bit better now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was going to come back after hearing that she had another seizure, but the meeting is only over now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Still, if you could come and see Rona next time\u2026.\u201d\nAt that time, the secretary next to her called Lee Sein.\u00a0A discreet but clear voice cuts off the conversation. It was a calculated soft invasion.\n\u201cCEO-nim, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Then, I\u2019ve got to go. Cedric, I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s talk again later.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Yes.\u201d\nWithout hesitation, Lee Sein turned around.\nBefore following her, the secretary\u2019s gaze rested on Choi Cedric\u2019s face for a moment. Then, a faint smile stayed on his lips before melted away like a bubble.\nChoi Cedric looked at his back as he moved away.\nHis name is Aeon. The strange face, whose gender and age are not clear, with the eyes adorning that face as if they are embedded with glass eyes, is emotionless.\nA lot has changed with the advice that that secretary gave to Lee Sein.\nOriginally, Choi Cedric was introverted and timid. However, after he became an S-class hunter, he had to act arrogantly in front of others because what people want is an S-class appearance that is worthy of the strongest. A weak appearance is only a good weakness to be bitten. It would have been better to be arrogant and self-righteous.\nThat\u2019s why he decided to hide the existence of the sick Choi Rona from the world. A melodramatic story doesn\u2019t suit the Rankers. No one is curious about sad stories.\nIn the end, Choi Cedric became famous and admired.\nBut\u2026.\nHis younger sister suffers alone in a secret hospital room where no one comes to visit, and he can\u2019t even show his sadness in front of others.\nIs this really correct?\nThe answer to the question he posed alone is unknown. It was a noisy night.\n***\nWhat day is it today?\nSo, today is the day I meet celebrities.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nAfter the commotion at the farm, I left the farm with a sapling and a bundle of miscellaneous gifts. I was walking after getting off the subway at the nearest station to the Dungeon Gate when suddenly someone made a sound of surprise.\nIn front of me was a girl who looked roughly in her mid-teens.\n\u201cWhat are you doing there \u2026 Ah!\u201d\nA boy who looked the same appeared.\nDo they happen to know me? But I have no memory of meeting these kids.\nThe twins, who were looking at me with their eyes wide open, were embarrassed and lowered their heads.\n\u201cUwaa! I\u2019m sorry. I surprised you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine \u2026 have we met somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cOur guild leader \u2026 oh, no, I mistook you for someone I knew.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, hey, Joo Shinwoo! Gu \u2026 no, Hunter-nim, where did he go?\u201d\n\u201cNo way \u2026 did we miss him?!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.That way!\u201d\nHurriedly, the twins ran towards the other side of the crosswalk. They were so fast that I couldn\u2019t even follow their moves.\nOnly the sound of \u2018I told you to watch him carefully, you idiot!\u2019 came in the wind. They are noisy kids.\nAre they sure they\u2019re mistaking me for someone else? I think I\u2019ve heard their voices somewhere.\u2026.\nWell, I don\u2019t know. It was just a moment when I stepped back to go back quickly.\nA long shadow cast under the orange streetlight. I inadvertently lowered my head to the starting point of the shadow and was startled.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026what are you doing there?\u201d\nThe owner of the shadow was Ki Yoohyun.\nUnder the bright orange light, Ki Yoohyun answered with a troubled smile.\n\u201cAhaha \u2026 It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\nA blind spot on the wall that is hard to see from the other side, a pair of glasses to cover that gorgeous face (for reference, they\u2019re not helpful at covering his face at all), and a black coat.\nI\u2019m starting to understand this situation\u2026.\nHasn\u2019t something similar happened before? As I recalled, the twins I met earlier came back.\nKi Yoohyun hid himself in the dark to avoid the lights of the street lamps.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi?\u201d\nBut the twins were faster. Running back and forth, they surrounded Ki Yoohyun back and forth and spoke.\n\u201cGu \u2026 no, Hunter Ki Yoohyun-nim, you are here!\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t miss you anymore! Please calmly return to the guild.\u201d\nCould it be that Ki Yoohyun, this person, was trying to slack off and playing hide and seek with these cute little children?\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi, I feel your eyes sting for some reason, is it just my imagination?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just your imagination.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThen, the twins talked to me.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being rude earlier. Guild \u2026  we were looking for Hunter Ki Yoohyun-nim.\u201d\n\u201cPardon us!\u201d\n Same face, same jumper.\nThe girl with long curly hair looked relatively proud, and the boy with a short hair had a more lively atmosphere. They\u2019re so cute. Then, they introduced themselves.\n\u201cMy name is Joo Shinhee from Cheongna Guild.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Joo Shinwoo!\u201d\n\u201cYou can call me Kwon Rieul. Please \u2026 huh?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s not\u2026.\u201d\nThe twin hunters of the Cheongna Guild?\nI remember. I saw them in a video before my return.\nAs soon as they awakened, they\u2019re a promising prospect who was selected for the main party \u2018Blue Vines\u2019 of Cheongna Guild.\nThe older sister, Joo Shinhee. An archer. Her specialty is an ice pick that targets the opponent\u2019s heart. \nThe younger brother, Joo Shinwoo. A wizard. His specialty is a curse that gnaws at the opponent.\nThe part that left an impression more strongly than their abilities was their facial expressions.\nA pale, doll-like face that has erased all the innocence and vitality one would expect from a child. The coldness in their eyes. The motion of wiping the blood off the cheek looked cruel.\nI blinked slowly and looked at them again. A lively, friendly boy and girl were looking up at me.\nNo wonder I didn\u2019t immediately recognize them. I couldn\u2019t connect them with the hideous appearances in my memory.\nHow do these cute kids change like that? 3 years is longer than I thought\u2026.\n\u201cIt looks heavy.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun suddenly talked to me, who was shocked by the future of the twins.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not heavy.\u201d\nThe sapling of the Purifying Tree was about two spans long, so it was light enough to be held with one hand. Other than that, there is one bag filled with miscellaneous items that Lee Chorok gave me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much to carry alone.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? But it\u2019s not a lot?\u201d\nIf it was heavy in the first place, I would have put it in my inventory to bring it. I don\u2019t want to have a toothed carrot or something in my inventory, so I just walk with it.\nHowever, Ki Yoohyun was firm.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on your way to the store, right? It\u2019s heavy, so I\u2019ll carry it for you.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who didn\u2019t listen to me at all, took the sapling and bag from my hands. This person is really\u2026..\nI don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but the twins were chasing Ki Yoohyun.\nSo now, you\u2019re using me as an excuse to get out of this situation\u2026.?\n\u201cThen, I have to help Rieul-ssi, so I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\n\u201cEek, Gu \u2026 Hunter Ki Yoohyun-nim!\u201d\nJoo Shinhee quickly tried to catch Ki Yoohyun, but Joo Shinwoo pulled her back. Then, they put their heads together and whispered in the corner.\nFor your information, it was loud enough for a whisper, so I could hear half of it.\n\u201cYou idiot! Did you forget what the deputy guild leader said?\u201d\u201cWhat is it, you idiot!\u201d\u201cThe reason Hunter Ki Yoohyun-nim these days\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh, aah\u2026!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\nThe twins glanced at me. The gazes are very passionate.\n\u201cThen, she\u2019s the\u2026!\u201d\u201cYeah, now you understand the situation, you idiot!\u201d\u201cWho are you calling an idiot, you idiot! Then uh, what should I do? Should I call her with \u2018unnie\u2019?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s too early to call her that. So we shouldn\u2019t \u2026 it is imperative that \u2025. do you understand?\u201d\u201cJoo Shinwoo, you\u2019re saying something useful.\u201d\u201cThis is nothing.\u201d\nNod, nod. As if they had reached a dramatic agreement, the twins stood up and greeted me with the utmost respect.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.We\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d\nThey bowed and turned around without hesitation.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nSorry for the delayed update.

            "c51": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Where am I?\u201d\nSnake vines in the front and sticky spatula that large enough to swallow people in the back.\nI\u2019m lost.\nA few dozen minutes of wandering around trying to find a way out\u2026.\n\u201cI failed again\u2026.\u201d\n\nA melancholy murmur was heard from nearby. It was the voice of a young man.\nWhere is that sound coming from? I walked towards the side where the sound was heard.\nThank Goodness. I thought I was stuck in a greenhouse like this, but I can find someone and ask for a way out.\nA voice of lamentation continued to be heard.\n\u201cHaa \u2026. I failed again\u2026.\u201d\nThe crying voice sounded like a gloomy ghost.\n\u201cWhat the hell should I do? In my power \u2026 it is not enough\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nI was able to find the owner of the voice when I turned around in the direction of a large sticky spatula.\n\u201cI \u2026 why is it always like this.\u2026.\u201d\nA man was crouching on the floor, looking into a small pot. The flower in the pot was withered. The leaves are yellow and the stems are bent, and the petals are likely to fall off if touched incorrectly.\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but it looks like he\u2019s difficult to talk to. I tried to back off a little bit.\nRustling.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe man, surprised by the sound of my footsteps, raised his head.\nAs his white cheeks grew redder, he spoke in a voice that couldn\u2019t hide his embarrassment.\n\u201cYo-you, how did you get in here? Haven\u2019t you heard that no one is allowed to come in?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about it?\u201d\nHe looks about the same age as me, but why is he talking informally from the beginning? Naturally, I became short-spoken.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! There, it says don\u2019t come in.\u201d\n\u201cBut there is not?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Do you have a problem with your eyes? It clearly said no entry here! Eh?\u201d\nThere was only a piece of white paper attached to the place the man pointed to. A white paper with nothing written on it.\nThe man took the paper and checked it. On the back, it says \u2018No Entry\u2018.\n\u2026 You put it upside down. So, obviously I can\u2019t see it.\nThe bewildered man spoke again in a sulky voice.\n\u201cEhem! Anyway, I\u2019m busy right now, so go away.\u201d\n\u201cI have a question \u2026 Ah.\u201d\nPretending to be a grown-up, he flipped his hair over to reveal his forehead. However, the cheeks that were still young, the eyes without double eyelids, and the slightly raised eyes were familiar. It looked like a face I had seen somewhere, and I immediately remembered who this man was.\nThe No. 2 in ranking, Hunter Choi Cedric.\nAn S-class swordsman who is the representative Hunter of C&L Corporation, one of the Big Three guilds. It was natural that he looked familiar because he appeared in so many media outlets, contrary to the No. 1 ranker, which is almost underwater.\nThe last thing I remember is\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for the Healer to heal now. While the swordsman catches the monster himself, what if the Hunter who only heals in the back can\u2019t heal properly?\u201d \u201cOh, tell me again. The healing can\u2019t be done? What? I\u2019m out of the healing range? Aren\u2019t healers supposed to chase after me on their own? After all, you all get money thanks to our guild.\u201d\nIt was a personality controversy\u2026.\nIt was noisy for a while because the large bomb was detonated on a live broadcast that could not be edited. The Healer professional guild \u2018Garden of Blessing\u2018 stood up with a promise to boycott Choi Cedric.\nIn the end, it ended with Choi Cedric apologizing publicly, but it became controversial again, saying that the apology was not sincere.\nIn other words, a ranker who is known for his personality controversy as well as his skills and fame.\nTo see such a famous hunter here \u2026 it\u2019s really a small world.\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m stuck in the memories for a while.\n\u201cAh, yes, yes, I see.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nChoi Cedric suddenly ripped open the \u2018No Entry\u2018 paper, scribbled something on the back, and held it out.\n\u201cHere! My autograph! I signed it, so go now.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\nI\u2019m not really a fan, so what\u2019s the use of a Hunter\u2019s autograph to me? It was also signed on the back side with tape marks.\nBut he seemed to interpret my words in a different way.\n\u201cWhat? Do you want to take a picture with me? Well \u2026 yeah, I originally can\u2019t, but I\u2019m in a mood today. Take this and go quickly. I am someone with a private life too.\u201d\nClick.\nWithout giving me a moment to say anything, he snatched my phone, took a selfie, corrected it meticulously, and returned it.\n\u201cNo \u2026 not this, I was going to ask you how to get out of here.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nChoi Cedric\u2019s cheeks slowly flushed.\n\u201cHey! Yo-you should\u2019ve said that in the first place! I, I thought you were a fan who came all the way here again!\u201d\nI tried to tell him. It\u2019s him who made a fuss.\n\u201cBut what\u2019s that flower?\u201d\nI pointed to the withered flower in the pot.\n\u201c\u2026.it\u2019s just flowers. Now go. The exit is over there.\u201d\nFor \u2018just a flower\u2019, you looked at it with a depressed expression earlier\u2026..\n\u201cYou said, my power is not enough, so what should I do?\u201d\nChoi Cedric must be a type of person who turns red quickly.\n\u201cYou, you, you! You secretly listen to people talking to themselves!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear it secretly, since you were talking to yourself in front of the road I was passing through.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, what\u2019s this flower?\u201d\nIn a greenhouse full of flowers that look like a human head, vines with snakes, and sticky spatulas big enough to eat humans, this flower just withers and looks quite ordinary.\nHowever, the delicate soft blue petals somehow bothered me.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be interested! It\u2019s a very precious flower. It\u2019s not something anyone can get.\u201d\nThat very precious flower is dying\u2026.\nIt was a moment when I wanted to ask more about the flower.\n\u201cCustomer-nim! Where are you in now? The sapling is ready. You didn\u2019t come close to the dungeon spatula, did you? Customer-nim! The Dungeon Sticky Spatula is very cute, but you can be eaten if you touch it!\u201d\n\u201cThis way!\u201d\nLee Chorok found me and approached me at a fast pace, but she was surprised to see Choi Cedric.\n\u201cHuuu, haa, Customer-nim, you are here! Here, the sapling of the Purifying Tree you purchased \u2026 Huuk, why is Hunter Choi Cedric here? \u2026 Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve done something to Customer-nim?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat? How do you see me?\u201d\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d kill me like this before.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nPerhaps he noticed the silent contempt in my gaze, Choi Cedric hastily added.\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026! It\u2019s because you say it\u2019s hard to save this flower\u2026\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, you can\u2019t do that. She\u2019s my first customer in months.\u201d\nIs this place okay.\u2026.\nRinging.\nThen, Choi Cedric\u2019s phone vibrated long.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026! I\u2019m going.\u201d\nChoi Cedric, who was going to say something to Lee Chorok, went out of the greenhouse as soon as he checked the name on the phone screen. It seems to be an urgent call.\n\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d\n\u201cNo way, gosh, Customer-nim, what happened? That Hunter is a bit nasty, has a bad temper, and has a very poor attitude, but he\u2019s not a bad person \u2026 at least I don\u2019t think so, and it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t say no \u2026 that\u2019s it.\u201d\nLee Chorok, who said so, looked pale as if she had recalled even a bad memory.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happened \u2026 what is this flower?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you were watching this. It\u2019s a flower called the Blue Celaeno flower.\u201d\nAs soon as I heard the name, a status window appeared in front of me.\n[Item: Blue Celaeno Flower (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605)A legendary flower that is said to contain the starlight of Celaeno.Note: Withered.]\n5 stars\u2026..?\nI was surprised to see that the grade of an ordinary-looking flower was 5 stars.\n\u201cThis flowerpot was entrusted to me by Hunter Choi Cedric.\u201d\nAccording to Lee Chorok, this was the case.\nBlue Celaeno Flowers are not only very rare but they are also very difficult to bloom.\nOne day, Hunter Choi Cedric brought the seeds of this flower and asked her to make the flowers bloom at any cost. Lee Chorok accepted the job on the pride of a botanist. \u2026 Rather than that, it seemed that the money offered by Choi Cedric was too large to refuse.\n\u201cBut \u2026 the ether content of the soil needs to be controlled very delicately. I\u2019ve been trying it for months now, and it\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a rare flower, can it be a high-quality item material?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nLee Chorok clouded the end of the sentence. She seemed hesitant to say this. Then, she carefully added the backstory.\n\u201cHunter Choi Cedric\u2019s younger sister has a rare disease. It\u2019s a disease where the flow of ether in the body gets tangled, so it\u2019s very painful \u2026 there is currently no cure. But only this flower, the Blue Celaeno Flower, is said to the relieve pain.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what happened. I felt a little sorry.\nI searched the name of the flower on the Ether-Wiki to see if there was any information.\n[Checking your eligibilities \u2026 Completed.][The Eligible: Verifying Kwon Rieul\u2026..]\n\u2018Skip.\u2019\n[No results were found for your search.]\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not helpful when I really need it.\nIf that\u2019s the case, I wish I could find a way.\n***\nChoi Cedric, who left the farm, headed straight to the headquarters of C&L Corporation, his guild.\n\u201cHunter-nim, I will help you to verify your identity.\u201d\n\u201cGet lost!\u201d\nChoi Cedric ignored the security guard\u2019s restraint and went straight through the entrance. The beep beep sounds were heard, but he didn\u2019t care.\nThe security guard was perplexed, but didn\u2019t catch him.This is because there was no one here who didn\u2019t know who he was just by looking at his face. However, with an angry expression, he simply dismissed the security warning notification.\nThere is no room for hasty steps. He immediately got on the private elevator and got off on the top floor.\nThe top floor, which was accessible to only a few people, had a bleak atmosphere.\nA secret door appears when you touch a specific location on a white wall with no decorations. After confirming the Hunter license, the door opens, and you must repeat the same process after passing the connecting hallway to enter the hidden area.\nAs soon as he walked through the door, he could smell the medicine. The smell of disinfectant \u2026 and the smell of pain and death.\nChoi Cedric approached at a quick pace and opened the innermost door.\n\u201c\u2026.Rona-ya!\u201d\nBeyond the door was a room decorated like a hospital room. On the bed was a skinny little girl asleep.\nNo, you can call it sleep.\nThe girl\u2019s sleep is full of pain and fear, not rest and comfort. She screams in fever and pain, but her mind is trapped and she cannot wake up.\nShe is the only younger sister of Choi Cedric, who suffered from a rare disease three years ago and was unable to open her eyes.\nAnd now the girl is having a seizure.\n\u201cUh \u2026 ugh, hugh\u2026\u2026. uh, aaaaagh! agh! ugh, hugh!\u201d\nScreams filled the room. Choi Cedric quickly ran to the bedside.\n\u201cRona-ya! Oppa is here. It must be really hard. Rona-ya\u2026.\u201d\nBut no answer is returned. The girl could only continue to let out a moan of pain.\nChoi Cedric turned to the healers who were waiting next to him.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you treat her?\u201d\n\u201cWell \u2026 that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThe healer blurted out the end of their words at the sudden question.\n\u201cAs you know, even if we use healing skills, it\u2019s \u2026. there is no improvement.\u201d\nIt was true.\nThe two healers in the hospital room are the best healers in Korea, with the exception of Kwon Jiwoon of the White Silver Guild. He took the blame for monopolizing the top healers and paid a huge amount to hire them.\nHowever, it was impossible to relieve Choi Rona\u2019s pain no matter how many healing skills they poured. This is because the rare disease rejects all skills and potions.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nNew characters unlocked : D\nCelaeno is a real blue star in the constellation of Taurus. \nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Fortunately, he had received the flyer and handed it to me.\n[Happy Green Life Fruit ShopDirect Delivery/Courier Service available\u203b Free shipping over \u20a930,000010-xxxx-xxxx]\nThe name is a bit unusual, but it looks like an ordinary fruit shop advertisement\u2026.\nIs there such a thing as the Purifying Tree in a place like this? Let\u2019s go and see.\n\nI thought it was a tree growing in the dungeon, of course, because the system wanted to throw me into the dungeon whenever there was a chance, but was it actually possible to buy it at a fruit shop?\nHowever, perhaps because the flyer was made from recycled back paper, a completely different contents were printed on the back.\nI was about to take notes of the phone number and fold the flyer, but when I saw the back, I was startled.\n[Happy Green Life Dungeon FarmDungeon Plant Cultivation/Sales Specialist\u203b Dungeon Management Office Authorized Designated Company\u203b a PhD in Dungeon Botany\u203b Dungeon Plant Experience Farm is operated.010-xxxx-xxxx]\nYes, I should go to this farm.\nThe moment I saw the name of the farm, I suddenly remembered something that happened before the regression.\nIt was a story from a TV show. It\u2019s the story of a botanist who is fascinated by the plant ecosystem of Dungeon. After awakening, she threw everything away and only immersed herself in researching dungeon plants.\nIt may seem somewhat vague to say this, but the actual broadcast treated her like a \u2018Martian\u2018 or a \u2018Venusian\u2018.\nIn short, she was treated like a freak.\nIt wasn\u2019t a very interesting subject, but I was sucked into it with proper trailer fishing and provocative editing and watched it until the end.\nIt was something like this\u2026.\n[\u25b6\u25b6]\nThis is the Hunter Market\u2019s consignment shop area where numerous items are traded.It\u2019s crowded with hunters who want to buy items at low prices, but the Venusian is interested elsewhere.The Venusian who scanned the surroundings quickly stopped at one place.\u201cHow much is this?\u201dWhat the Venusian pointed to is \u2026 a seed?\n\u201cWhat did you just buy?\u201d\u201cDungeon arrowroot, Green Etheric Toothed Carrot Seed.\u201d\u201cIt \u2026 Isn\u2019t that a plant monster?\u201d\u201cNo. They\u2019re often mistaken for monsters, but they\u2019re all ordinary plants.\u201dA Venusian who calls carrots with sharp teeth an ordinary plant.\nThe place where she headed with the seeds of the monster is home to the Venusian.\u201cWhat are you doing with these monster seeds?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to grow it.\u201dYou raise a plant monster?\nThe Venusian takes the frightened PD Kim to the greenhouse.\u201cThis place has the same ether, temperature, and humidity as inside the dungeon. Any dungeon plant can grow perfectly here.\u201dIt\u2019s filled with toothed carrot and orchids with blades like razor.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it creepy to see them like this?\u201d\u201cFufu, aren\u2019t they cute?\u201d\u201cWhat are the benefits of growing this?\u201dDoes it have any special effect? PD Kim, who claimed that he\u2019s not in good health due to continuous overtime work these days, is interested.\u201cYeah? Can\u2019t I just grow them? They\u2019re cute.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d\nA Venusian who pours etheric water into a flowerpot and takes care of them with care.One of them has finally bloomed.\u201cI worked really hard to grow this.\u201dUgh, this is a flower?\u201cIt seems to resemble \u2026. human head.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called a hair flower. Look. Isn\u2019t it pretty? Touch it.\u201dPD Kim carefully stretches out his hand.Kwak!\u201cArgh! Aaaaah! It bit me!\u201dCrack!\u201cArgh! Let go of me! Save me!\u201d\n[\u25b6\u2225]\n\u2026\u2026.\nThe last scene was the PD running away with his hand bitten by a flower that resembles a human head.\nAfter that, they were criticized a lot for promoting the Dungeon Farm, and eventually, the \u201cSecret of the Venusians\u201d program, which introduces unique hunters, ended.\nIt was obvious that this Happy Green Life Dungeon Farm was on the program.\n\u2018It\u2019s a place where human hair flower is grown, so it\u2019s not strange to have a Purifying Tree too.\u2019\nBut I remember that this farm was closed later \u2026 it must have been a big event because it was a hot topic, but what was it?\nWell, I can\u2019t remember the reason for the closing.\nAnyway, it looks like it\u2019s still open, and I got a hint, so let\u2019s go check it out.\n***\nIn front of an ordinary apartment complex. Happy Green Life Fruit Shop was there.\n\u201cHow much is a basket of apples here?\u201d\n\u201cFive thousand won.\u201d\nThe stall was quite crowded with customers looking to buy fruits on their way home from work. I approached the owner, who was holding fruit in a plastic bag with an indifferent look on her face, and spoke to her.\n\u201cExcuse me, where should I go to get to Happy Green Life Dungeon Farm?\u201d\nThis is because there was no farm around the fruit stall. The address written on the flyer is here for sure\u2026.\n\u201cGo that way.\u201d\nThe fruit shop owner pointed to a certain place. It was a bonus to see all kinds of unusual people.\nAs I turned my head, I saw a signboard saying \u2018Farm\u2019 in a position that seemed to be covered by bushes, next to the narrow path leading to the mountain behind.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nThe joy of finally finding it is for a momentarily.\nAs soon as I entered the trail, I could feel the hot air. In addition, toothed carrots and razor-blades orchids were grown on both sides, creating a very eerie atmosphere.\nShush, shoo, shush, shush\u2026..\nThere seems to be a strange noise coming from somewhere\u2026.\nIf I had known it would be like this, I would have come with Choi Yichan. I regretted belatedly that I said I would go alone because I could go in vain.\nI climbed up the creaking stairs and went into the farm. The stifling air was full of unique smells and questionable plants, but I didn\u2019t feel any sign of human\u2019s activities.\n\u201cExcuse me, is there anyone here?\u201d\nThere is no answer.\n\u201cNobody here? I\u2019d like to buy something.\u201d\nIs there no one here? The moment I\u2019m thinking about going back disappointed.\nDudangtang!\nThere was a sound of something collapsing inside, and then a person rushed out.\n\u201cUh, yes, what\u2019s up? I paid the electricity bill last week.. The electricity really shouldn\u2019t be cut off, but if you could wait a few more days \u2026 are you not here to collect the electricity bill?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m looking for some saplings.\u201d\n\u201cHuk, are you a customer? Are you a guest? A visitor other than that filthy hunter \u2026 it\u2019s the first time in a month, no, the first time in two months? Come this way, please come this way!\u201d\nThe owner of the farm was almost the same as what I saw her on the broadcast before regression.\nOnly the lower part of her long hair was dyed green, and she wore a green jacket over a green satin skirt over her light green shirt. She wore green horn-rimmed glasses. It\u2019s a clear concept-specific outfit\u2026.\nObviously the name\u2026.\n\u201cMy name is Lee Chorok, the owner of this place. I\u2019m a botanist. What are you looking for?\u201d\nYeah, it was Chorok. Even the name matches.\n\u201cWe are different from similar companies. You can choose the dungeon plant that is right for you, recommended by a Ph.D. holder through a scientific method. If you trust me, I will do my best to serve you.\u201d\nThe leaflet given by Lee Chorok said, \u201cRecommendation of Dungeon Plants by Blood Type\u201d and \u201cToday\u2019s Fortune UP, Lucky Color Plants by Constellation\u201d.\nIt has nothing to do with science.\u2026.\nBut from what she just said, it seems that there have been no customers for two months, is it really okay here?\nAnyway, after returning the pseudo-science flyer, I took out the leaf of the purifying that had been in the bag with the fruit.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for this tree.\u201d\nAs soon as Lee Chorok saw the leaf, she recognized what it was.\n\u201cAh! It\u2019s a Purifying Tree. There is a lot of fine dust these days. As the name suggests, the Purifying Tree has the effect of purifying the air, so it is recommended as a horticultural plant for home use. Just in time, there is a sapling that\u2019s been airlifted from the C-grade dungeon \u2026 shall I show you?\u201d\nIt was an eye full of anticipation and desperate sales.\nWhen I nodded, Lee Chorok quickly led me to the sapling.\n[Item: Sapling of the Purifying Trees (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)Type: SaplingThe sapling of a young Purifying Tree. When planted, it gives off a delicate floral scent.]\nThe name of the status window is definitely Purifying Tree. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so easy to find. The thought that this quest would be finished easily made me smile.\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt just so happens to be on sale! We are offering it for only 50 rubies at a special sale price.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Eh.\u201d\nIt\u2019s more expensive than I thought.\nI counted the rubies left in my inventory. Excluding the store sales, I spent 70 of them to buy various materials from the 100 I got from the last quest. Of those, 50 are almost all of them.\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\nLet\u2019s go back and think about it slowly. There is no law that says you have to buy it now, and if you do well, you might be able to get it elsewhere.\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it more and come back.\u201d\nHowever, this dungeon botanist, Lee Chorok, seemed hesitant and quickly started adding options. It was formidable agility.\n\u201cCustomer-nim! It\u2019s not an easy tree to get. In some C-grade dungeons, it can only grow when the ether contained in the soil is biased towards the water attribute. It also has excellent air purification ability.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit pricey though\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIf you buy it now, we also provide an ether-fertilizer set for fast growth, a dedicated watering can, and gardening scissors as a bonus!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThe first and second book of Growing Dungeon Plants that even elementary school students can understand is also included!\u201d\nOn the cover with toothed carrots and hair flowers, \u2018Author: Lee Chorok\u2019 was written. It was like a self-published book.\n\u201cI\u2019ll also give you two roots of toothed carrots! Absolutely special price! Great service!\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\nJust the thought of a carrot with teeth gave me nightmares.\n\u201cI opened this farm with a pool of bank loans, and it\u2019s been two months. \u2026 there was no customer but one strange hunter. They are all precious trees that I airlifted from the dungeon and raised.\u201d\nYeah \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t buy dungeon plants unless I had my own reasons.\n\u201cElectricity and water bills have been delayed for several months. If business doesn\u2019t go like this \u2026 my sister, ah, she is the owner of the fruit shop in front of this farm. My sister said she would turn this place into a fruit shop.\u201d\nThe fruit shop seems to be doing well.\n\u201cAh, if this tree sapling doesn\u2019t sell \u2026 I\u2019ll die here alone like dust with the trees\u2026.\u201d\nAn incredibly burdensome look swept over me.\nThe ability to erase the debt of mind was no joke. It was really hard to say \u2018I\u2019ll buy it next time\u2018 in front of those mournful eyes and sad TMI.\nWell, it\u2019s true that I need a Purifying Tree, and I got a lot of extra money, so I\u2019ll just buy it.\n\u201cThen \u2026 I\u2019ll buy it, give me this.\u201d\n\u201cPlease think of saving me, huk! Yes? Re-really? Are you buying this?\u201d\nLee Chorok, who was squeezing tears with a sad expression, was pleased with my words.\n\u201cHuk, wait a minute. Right! While you wait, please take a look at the greenhouse.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cThis way! You can look at it comfortably.\u201d\nLee Chorok pushed me into the greenhouse of the farm and soon disappeared, saying that she will pack the sapling and miscellaneous items.\nI shouted, \u201cPlease take out the carrots\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be heard. Basically, she seemed to have a personality that didn\u2019t listen well to others.\nA greenhouse full of strange-looking plants unfolded before my eyes.\nIt\u2019s a little scary, but \u2026. since it\u2019s been a while, let\u2019s take a look around.\n\u2018If I don\u2019t touch a human head flower, I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\nBut I soon regretted this decision.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\n\ucd08\ub85d (Chorok) means Green \nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t normally drink coffee.\u201d\n\u2026\u2026Ah. A slow enlightenment flashed through my mind.\nHe can\u2019t drink coffee. It was natural that this customer ordered the same menu every day. After all, coffee was the only thing on the menu.\nNo matter how special coffee is made with the \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2019 skill, there is nothing that can be done about taste and constitution.\nSome might say this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because you haven\u2019t drunk a real delicious coffee!\u201d.\nNo, the taste of \u201creal delicious coffee\u201d is just not that person\u2019s cup of tea.\nA cafe must have a menu other than coffee for customers who can\u2019t drink coffee. I was busy making the menu in the quest, so I didn\u2019t think about it.\nAnyway, this customer is ordering without complaints, but the light bar that only filled up to half was annoying to my eyes.\nYeah, I made up my mind.

I didn\u2019t think about the date\u2026.\nIt\u2019ll be fine in a few days. When I pointed out the appropriate date of next week, the customer nodded carefully.\nAs soon as a customer left the store after saying he would come that day, a system notification appeared in front of me.\n[A quest has occurred.]\n[Quest: Complete the non-coffee menu (0/1) begins.]\n***\n\u201cHua \u2026 Huahahahaha\u2026..!\u201d\nAs soon as he left the door of Cafe Rieul, Kim Taewoon couldn\u2019t resist his joy and burst into laughter.\nDone. It was worthwhile to go in and out of the cafe pretending to be an ordinary customer for several days.\nOrder the same menu several times at the same time. Finally, he got a clue to the illegal monster secret trade.\nThere will be a big deal in their hideout in a few days.It\u2019s a smuggling of the rare monster, a long-tailed phoenix.\nIt was the news delivered by Kim Taewoon\u2019s secret information, who had given a considerable amount of money, alcohol, and food by him.\nBut it was just that, and he couldn\u2019t figure out exactly how the deal was done.\nThe only clue was here at Cafe Rieul. There must have been a clue here to participate in the deal.\nNo matter how much he looked at the situation for several days, there was no result, but Kim Taewoon did not give in. A true journalist must have his own sparkle and persistence.\nHe believed in his senses. That\u2019s why he ate butter cookies and iced Americano every day.\nAnd finally, today.\nWhen the S-class Hunter Choi Yichan was away, the cafe owner secretly asked if the menu didn\u2019t suit his taste for the first time.\nKim Taewoon was surprised, but soon regained his composure.\nIt was clear that this question was a test for the trading deal. Otherwise, then why would they suddenly ask what the menu he likes? He doesn\u2019t like coffee,\u00a0but he\u2019s been drinking it all to avoid suspicion.\nHe carefully chose his words and answered calmly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\nThe cafe owner, with a surprised expression on her face, asked him to visit again.\nThe date she specified is \u2026  It was the same as the date of the smuggling trade, as stated by the secret informant.\nDone. He finally found a clue.

Nothing was going to be easy.\nThe problem is that all the recipes I have now are coffee. There is no quest to get a new recipe. I opened the recipe window to see if there was any new information and looked around.\nAt that time.\n[You have acquired information about a new recipe with a high level of curiosity.][You have acquired a new recipe \u2018Lemonade\u2019.]\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t do anything, but I suddenly got a recipe?\nWhat kind of system is this.\u2026.\nIt was a bit uncomfortable because they gave me a recipe all of a sudden.

It was a considerable amount because it was full of apples, pears, and bananas.\n\u201cOn the way? From where?\u201d\nIt\u2019s impossible to find a fruit shop near Dungeon Gate 3, which doesn\u2019t even have a convenience store.\n\u201cThat\u2019s, haha \u2026 it just happened.\u201d\nHopefully he wasn\u2019t forced to buy it\u2026..\nAnyway, there were a lot of fresh fruits, so I decided to put aside the worries about the quest and eat it right away. It was just when I was hungry, and I don\u2019t think the answer will come out just by thinking about it.\n\u201cI will cut it.\u201d\nAfter taking out the plate and fruit knife, Choi Yichan first began to peel the apple. However, the attempt soon ended in failure.\n\u201c\u2026..Ah.\u201d\nThis was because the apple was broken into small pieces in Choi Yichan\u2019s grasp. I took the knife from Choi Yichan.\n\u201cCheer up, I\u2019ll cut it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted apple juice, and that\u2019s good.\u201d\nChoi Yichan was still having trouble controlling his strength. He\u2019s better than before, but he still broke my coffee cup once in five times. Even an S-class hunter has many inconveniences.\nHe said that the progress of finding a new house to live in was very slow, as he has to find a place with strict security.\nIt\u2019s me who lived alone even before the regression, so it\u2019s nice to be able to meet friends like this every day.\nI cut the apple and put it on the plate. When I tried one piece, it was well-riped, so it tasted deliciously sweet and sour. After sharing it with Mieum and Lime, we sat down together for a while and ate apples.\nSitting down like this and eating apples suddenly reminded me of the old days.\nBefore regression, before starting to live alone, I lived with Kwon Jiwoon. Kwon Jiwoon had not yet awakened, and we had a good relationship.\nAt that time, I couldn\u2019t cut the apples, so Kwon Jiwoon used to cut them for me instead. Half of the apple, which he had cut for a while, would belong to Kwon Jiwoon.\n\u2018There was a time like that\u2026.\u2019\nUntil Kwon Jiwoon awakened.\nA lot has changed since his awakening. I couldn\u2019t adapt to the changed environment, and I thought Kwon Jiwoon, who suddenly became the leader of the guild, must had gone through a lot of things too.\nAs Kwon Jiwoon became busy, I naturally spent more time alone at home. When I wast left in an empty house, all kinds of negative emotions flooded in. Am I bothering my brother? Why aren\u2019t my parents and grandmother there? Such unanswered questions rushed in.\nI thought it would be better to live alone, so I decided to live alone after entering college. However, I still could not meet Kwon Jiwoon until the day of the move.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Kwon Jiwoon here? I am moving today.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s busy right now. I\u2019ll deliver it to him.\u201d\u201cBut if I could just talk to him for a second\u2026..\u201d\u201cKwon Rieul-ssi, do you not understand what I\u2019m saying? The deputy guild leader is busy.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nTime passed with only some things deviated like that \u2026 and it ended with an absurd death.\nHowever, this time, the future has changed in many ways because of the regression. Choi Yichan, who should have been dead in the past, is eating an apple in front of me.\nThen, will it be possible to change the relationship with Kwon Jiwoon?\nNo, let\u2019s stop. What\u2019s the point of thinking like this? It\u2019s not uncommon for cousins to be estranged from each other. I just felt dull for no reason\nShall we cut a pear this time and eat it?\n\u201cYichan-ah, would you like to eat a pear too?\u201d\n\u201cOh? That\u2019s nice.\u201d\nI was rummaging through the plastic bag to choose a ripe pear, and the leaves came out from inside.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026? What is this?\u201d\nOn the surface, they are just plain green leaves.\nDid the leaves get mixed in the plastic bag? I shook the leaves with my hands, and suddenly the system window popped up.\n[Skill: The Barista\u2019s Eyes (D) is used.]\n[Item: Leaf of the Purifying Tree (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)Type: LeafThe leaf of the Purifying Tree.

            "c48": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nA red brick building built on a deserted road.\nThere was a man watching the cafe located 3 minutes away from the Dungeon Gate of the Great Dungeon Abyss.\nHis age is early 40\u2019s. The recorder and camera were hidden in a vest with several pockets. There were also a cannon phone and a fake ID in his bag.\nDue to frequent overtime work, the area under his eyes were dark and the beard grew jagged on his chin. There\u2019s also a peculiar scar on his forehead.\n\nHowever, only his eyes were gleaming as he looked around.\n\u2018It must be there.\u2019\nThe man\u2019s name is Kim Taewoon. 42 years old, single. His occupation is a reporter for the weekly magazine Hunter Scope.\nHunter Scope is famous for its Hunter paparazzi, groundless rumors, and gibberish gossip. It is a weekly magazine that cannot be said to be high quality information source.\nKim Taewoon also made money by covering such frivolous rumors. He receives money and writes articles that the client wants. It\u2019s a standard and exemplary giraegi. When it comes to money, the ethics of journalists are not taken into account.\nHowever, not long ago, an ugly rumor came into Kim Taewoon\u2019s ear. Some guilds smuggle special monsters from dungeons.\nAt that moment, his reporter\u2019s hunch shone. This is a big deal. If he digs this properly, he can get rid of the stigma of being a yellow press journalist.\n\u2026. or he can rip off a generous sum of money by keeping his mouth shut.\nThe news he heard while investigating the rumors one by one was the birth of a new S-class Hunter.\nNow that everyone is curious about this sacred S-class, the coverage is a race of speed. Kim Taewoon immediately began investigating Choi Yichan by all means.\nAnd he found out that the Hunter went to and from the cafe in front of that dungeon gate every day. Paparazzi, no, it was the result of a field investigation.\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s worth stepping back.\u2019\nAnyway. The fact that an S-class hunter was suddenly doing a part-time job at a cafe, not doing anything else, gave off a strange smell.\nS-class! There are fewer than ten S-class hunters in Korea. Whatever you do, you will make more money than that.\nAn S-class hunter who wants neither money nor power?\n\u2018There can be no such thing. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do something bad in the back.\u2019\nKim Taewoon himself is an F-class hunter. The darkness of the Hunter industry has been deeply affected him. In addition, due to his long career as a journalist, he has become a cynical person who does not believe in human goodness.\nHis long-forged, sharp sense of a reporter shone.\nCome to think of it, there were reports that the smugglers were using cafes and shops as a hideout. There was also information that a fairly high-ranking Hunter was behind them, so they couldn\u2019t easily dig it up. While following Choi Yichan, he once found a suspicious person. Unfortunately, he missed it.\nEach piece of information seems far apart at the first glance, but when you put them side by side, they pointed to one answer.\nIf it\u2019s big enough for an S-class hunter to move directly, it must be a smuggling of a rare monster, the \u2018Long-tailed Phoenix\u2018.\nYes, that place is definitely the hangout of the smugglers.\nSo, Kim Taewoon was currently in the process of infiltrating Cafe Rieul.\nChoi Yichan just went into the cafe. Clearly, there must be something in that place.\n\u2018Damn it \u2026 I can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on inside.\u2019\nHe hid himself in a close spot, but Choi Yichan can\u2019t be seen because he was covered by an exquisite angle.\nThe secret camera and recorder, which are artifacts for coverage, are always useless at times like this.\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nHe waited for a long time, but there was no news from inside.\nGulp.\nKim Taewoon raised his body. \nYou can\u2019t rely solely on these artifacts to catch the scoop. A journalist is a person who runs on his own feet.\n\u2018That\u2019s a cafe \u2026 in that case.\u2019\nIt would be natural to approach it by pretending to be a customer.\nKim Taewoon approached the cafe, pretending to be an ordinary customer.\nRing. The bell hanging on the door rang to announce the arrival.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nBut the moment he entered, an awkward silence fell. A pair of careful eyes glanced over him.\n\u2018Bingo.\u2019\nAs expected. It looks like an ordinary cafe, but it\u2019s fake. It\u2019s a space with a different purpose, so they\u2019re wary of new customer.\nSometimes a lie is more plausible than the truth. Kim Taewoon could not have guessed the truth that Rieul was only thrilled because he was the first (not an acquaintance) guest who came on the opening day.\nWith a natural step, he opened the door and looked through the menu.\n\u201cAh, welcome!\u201d\nQuickly, the owner of the cafe approached the counter. She was a woman with a soft impression and a normal atmosphere.\nHuh, this kind of person was involved in illegal monster smuggling in the shadows. Kim Taewoon\u2019s eyes became sharp.\n\u201cWould you like to order?\u201d\n\u201cThen, I\u2019ll have this.\u201d\nKim Taewoon pointed to any menu on the menu board.\nWhat\u2019s unusual is that the price is set in ruby. Maybe it\u2019s some kind of password.\nThe S-class hunter, Choi Yichan, was sitting alone in a seat near the counter. Kim Taewoon looked at him carefully. After all, he intended to investigate him by pretending to be an ordinary customer.\nAfter paying 2 rubies without hesitation and sitting down, the menu came out soon. It was an iced Americano and cookies.\nHe didn\u2019t really want to eat it, but he could feel the owner\u2019s gaze from behind.\n\u201c\u2026..!\u201d\nWhen their eyes met, she turned her head and avoided. No matter how you look at it, there is a hint of doubt about this. If he doesn\u2019t eat, he will look suspicious.\n\u201cMmm\u2026.\u201d\nKim Taewoon first took the butter cookie. The sweet smell of sugar and butter made his stomach hungry. Come to think of it, he skipped lunch. As if attracted by the smell, he took a bite of the cookie.\nCrispy.\nThe cookie with plenty of sugar and butter melted softly in his mouth.\nOnce he ate, he couldn\u2019t stop his hands. As the sweetness filled his mouth, he took a sip of the iced Americano. Originally, he didn\u2019t like coffee very much, but it went well with these cookies.\nOne bite of a cookie, another sip of coffee.\nThe empty stomach filled up and the head calmed down. The migraine that had always bothered him has subsided. Feeling sad that the cookie plate was empty, he raised his head.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nBefore he knew it, Choi Yichan had disappeared. He was also meticulous to leave without any noise.\n\u2018Shh, I missed it.\u2019\nKim Taewoon thought as he bit his tongue in frustration.\nThen, he\u2019ll have to come back tomorrow.\nHe couldn\u2019t figure out which one was greater: the regret of the loss or the joy of eating these cookies again.\n***\nOn the first day of Cafe Rieul, I was very happy.\nThat\u2019s because a customer came to the cafe. It\u2019s not someone I know, but a \u201creal customer\u201d.\nIt was a man in his 40s wearing a fishing vest and a field jumper over it. It\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s passing by and he\u2019s like, \u201cHuh? There\u2019s a cafe here. Shall I take a short break?\u201d. He\u2019s that kind of customer!\nAs expected, thanks to the signboard, the cafe seems to have stood out.\nI was excited to finally have a first customer.\n\u201cWaeoooong (When did you say that you didn\u2019t want to work hard)?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing, this is another matter.\u201d\nI don\u2019t intend to work hard, but the fact that there are no customers in my newly opened store \u2026 it made me feel sad.\nChoi Yichan, who saw a customer coming in, sneaked up and sat in a corner. I felt sorry for his unwillingness to be noticed.\nAnyway, this monumental first guest ordered the \u2018Iced Americano and Butter Cookie Set\u2019 with a blunt expression on his face.\nThat\u2019s right, it has a stress-reducing combo effect, so it\u2019s a perfect menu for tired people.\nThe menu was quickly prepared and handed out to the customer. And, anxiously, I watched the customers eat the menu.\n\u201c\u2026..!\u201d\nOh, our eyes met. I quickly averted my gaze with embarrassment. I was curious about his impressions, but it\u2019s rude to stare at the customer too much.\nThe customer also came to the cafe the next day.\nThe next day, and the next day\u2026\u2026.\n[Cumulative Sales: 12 Rubies]\nThanks to this, the sales were gradually gathering.\nI was happy to have a regular customer for a while.\n\u201cHuum\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cKiyaoo, why are you like this!\u201d\n\u201cHuum\u2026..\u201d\nI have a new problem. It\u2019s because of the regular customer in question.\n\u201cThat man, he must have a different purpose. Waeooong.\u201d\n\u201cKyuu!\u201d\nAt Mieum\u2019s outrageous remarks, Lime added a cry of agreement.\n\u201cMeooong, he comes at the same time every day and order the same menu. It\u2019s suspicious!\u201d\n\u201cKyuu, kyuuuu!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just a big fan of butter cookies.\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong!\u201d\nPakpak!\nMieum lifted her front paws and punched me. Haha, but now I can avoid it without looking. Mieum, who missed a shot in the air, said again.\n\u201cWho will come all the way to the Dungeon Gate like this every day just because he likes butter cookies! Meoong, I bet he\u2019s coming because he has a different purpose.\u201d\nThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u2026.\n\u201cDifferent purpose, what can it be?\u201d\n\u201cThat man must be a member of the Dungeon Smuggling Organization, kiyaooo! He chose this place as a place to make a deal, avoiding other people\u2019s eyes. But the other party he was supposed to make a deal with had already betrayed him. He comes here every day, unaware of that fact, meooong\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the evidence?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the feeling of this body!\u201d\n\u2026. I shouldn\u2019t have asked.\nNo wonder she watched \u201cMidnight Mystery Drama, The Whereabouts of the Missing Hunter\u201d until late last night. That\u2019s the story of the drama.\nI opened the oven while thinking that I should refrain this imaginative cat from watching the drama in the future. A sweet and savory smell sprang up. Just when the freshly baked butter cookies are transferred onto the plate, there was the sound of the door opening. \nSpeaking of the devil.\n\u201cOh, welcome!\u201d\n\u201cThis one, please.\u201d\nToday, at the same time, this customer came and ordered the same menu and sat down at the same seat.\nChoi Yichan broke a cup today and went out, saying he would return without  strength. The customer sneaked a look at Choi Yichan\u2019s usual place, but without saying anything, he accepted the iced Americano and butter cookies.\nAs the customer took a bite of the cookie and drank the coffee, a twinkling bar appeared above his head.\nThe bar was filled with light \u2026. and it stopped.\n\u2018It\u2019s the same today\u2026.\u2019\nThis is my concern.\nThe bar of light that represents the satisfaction that rises above this guest\u2019s head. It\u2019s about 60 percent based on eye measurement. It stopped at the same level every day with only slight differences.\nIn other words, this customer is not completely satisfied with the menu.\nMaybe the coffee doesn\u2019t taste good?\nNo, it can\u2019t be.\nI had such doubts for a while, but the chances are low. Iced Americano and butter cookies are in perfect condition today.\nThen what on earth is unsatisfactory about this menu?\nThe customer had an atmosphere that was somehow difficult to approach and had an expression of \u2018don\u2019t talk to me\u2019. But today, I decided to be brave.\n\u201cExcuse me, sir, maybe \u2026 do you not like the menu?\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nGiraegi (\uae30\ub808\uae30)\u00a0is a compound word of \uae30\uc790 (gija: means a journalist, reporter and editor) and \uc4f0\ub808\uae30 (tsuraegi : means a trash).

It was by no means hostile or disrespectful. In the view of the new S-class, they have no choice but to cheer no matter what he says.\nIn addition, from the No. 1 in the rankings, who doesn\u2019t reveal his face, Choi Yichan\u2019s youthful appearance will feel fresh among the S-classes who are known for their feisty personality.\n\u2014 You just brought out the gate stone, did you defeat the dungeon boss?

Umh\u2026.\u2014 The C&L Corporation and the Royal Guild have already announced their intention to recruit you.\nSince he already answered appropriately, he can now refuse the interview, but Choi Yichan continued to answer with bewildered expression.\nHe was not accustomed to receiving attention in the first place, and he seemed to be embarrassed by the great enthusiasm at the interview site.\n\u2014 Ah, breaking news! Hunter Han Yiseong of Cheongna Guild has now announced that you will be recruited regardless of the conditions.\nAt the bottom of the news screen, there is a big caption that reads, \u2018The Big Three is willing to recruit him \u2026 what is the future of the new S-Class?\u2019.\nIt\u2019s a mess. Choi Yichan diligently got involved in the reporter\u2019s interview.\n\u2014 The guild, thank you for the recommendation, but I have something to do before that, so I won\u2019t go into it now.\u2014 Can I ask you what\u2019s going on?\u2014 It\u2019s a bit personal\u2026.\u2014 Ah!

I just made a bunch of butter cookies after putting a flowerpot with a ribbon that Choi Yichan brought while apologizing to me a while ago.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nEven though I said it was okay several times, Choi Yichan apologized again.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to \u2026 they suddenly put the camera in front of me and asked, and I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re really good.\u201d\nChoi Yichan apologized for saying in an interview a few days ago that he belonged to \u2018Cafe Rieul\u2019. It happened because he remembered the promise to help me in the midst of embarrassment.\nChoi Yichan crumpled his large body into the inner seat as if he was ashamed. His long legs poked forward.\nChoi Yichan, who has yet to decide which guild to enter, was, so to speak, a prey to the Hunter World.\nHe didn\u2019t know how the hell did they found out, he told me he turned off his phone because he received so many unknown calls. Not only that, he left the house where he lived in a hurry because people came to his house.\nI said he could stay here for a while if he had nowhere to sleep, but\u2026.\n\u201cIs it because you\u2019re uncomfortable? You can use it separately because the first and second floors are separated.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s, it\u2019s just little \u2026 I can\u2019t do that!\u201d\nChoi Yichan firmly refused.\n\u201cThen where do you live now?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. That wide earth, life flows with the wind!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nAre you okay\u2026..\nInstead, I decided to hire Choi Yichan as a temporary part-timer only during the daytime.\nUsing an S-class hunter as a part-timer \u2026. no wonder it just opened, but it already feels like a great cafe.\nChoi Yichan, who had suffered a lot for several days, had a dark circle under his eyes and a haggard expression on his face.\nHowever, Choi Yichan has the upper hand of power. He doesn\u2019t have to suffer from such a nuisance if he decides to.\nIn the vertical Hunter World, Choi Yichan, a new S-class hunter, can do everything he wants. It\u2019s possible to cheat with power anyway. Even the No. 1 ranker blocked all coverage of himself.\nHowever, Choi Yichan did not seem to have any intention of doing so. He looked like someone who would only use his power for the right cause\u2026.\n\u201cAre you not going to join a guild?\u201d\nIf he joins a guild, the guild can solve it even if Choi Yichan does not directly respond to the interview. It would be better for Choi Yichan, who can\u2019t say anything hateful, to have a guild.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t really want to.\u201d\n\u201cHow about Cheongna Guild?\u201d\nIt was a little surprising that Cheongna Guild also wanted to recruit Choi Yichan. They\u2019re a small elite guilds that rarely hired new hunters.\nHunter Han Yiseong is a good person, and Ki Yoohyun is also \u2026. he\u2019s weird sometimes, but he\u2019s a good person, so wouldn\u2019t they suit Choi Yichan?\nStill, Choi Yichan shook his head firmly to the side.\n\u201cUmh \u2026 No, not now.\u201d\nWell, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t like it.\nRight now, he\u2019s very surprised because of the series of interviews, but Choi Yichan will do well wherever he goes.\n\u201cKiyaoong (One more time! Do it one more time)!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu, kkyuu!\u201d\nChoi Yichan held Mieum and Lime in both hands and played with them, throwing them in the air. His hand technique was amazing, as if he was juggling.\n\u201cMeoong, meooong (Ugh, I\u2019m dizzy)\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cKyuuu\u2026.\u201d\nYou both seemed to be having fun.\nWell, until this heat goes away \u2026 let\u2019s say he\u2019s a temporary part-timer who\u2019s in charge of playing with animals.\nChoi Yichan, who played with Mieum until her eyes turned pink, spoke.\n\u201cBut I was surprised that Rieul was also an Awakened.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha\u2026.\u201d\nI revealed my awakening to Choi Yichan. Rather than trying to reveal it on purpose, it just happened. As I explained the effect of coffee jelly to Choi Yichan, who returned from the dungeon, it happened naturally. There was no reason for me to lie.\n\u201cSomehow, when I ate that coffee jelly \u2026 what\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened inside?\u201d\nAfter awakening, it is very rare that the grade goes up several stages or the class changes. I\u2019m very curious about what happened.\nChoi Yichan tilted his head with an ambiguous expression.\n\u201cUh \u2026 that \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Something talked to me, and then something came up. How do you explain it?\u201d\nWell, I have no idea either\u2026..\nChoi Yichan gave a lengthy explanation as he traced his memory, but it was difficult to interpret the words that did not contain any proper nouns.\nWhat is \u2018that\u2018?\nAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter because he\u2019s back alive.\nIn fact, I was worried and anticipating that the number of customers would suddenly increase since \u2018Cafe Rieul\u2019 was mentioned in the breaking news, especially the breaking news with the highest viewership ratings.\n\u201cIs this the cafe that the new S-class hunter mentioned?\u201d\u201cIs it such an amazing place that even the new S-class hunter talked about it?\u201d\u201cHere, give me the whole menu from start to end!\u201d\u201cMe too! I came first!\u201d\nWhat if this happens? I don\u2019t intend to work that hard\u2026..\nHowever, overshadowing the worries, only Grandma Kim Deokyi and Jina stopped by earlier, and the store that had just opened is quiet.\n[The name of <Cafe Rieul> has been passed on to many people.][Converts the acquired recognition to fame \u2026. Completed.][Name: Cafe RieulGrade: FFame: 5, Popularity: 0]\n\u2026.. I\u2019ve been worried to no avail.\nI\u2019m glad, but what is this sad feeling?\nNaturally, there was no progress in the quest to meet 10 customers. System guy, isn\u2019t the quest difficulty too high?\nDeep in such thought, I didn\u2019t notice that there was someone who was aiming for this place at that time.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nTteoksang (\ub5a1\uc0c1) means skyrocketing / getting popular (Literal meaning: increase like a rice cake).

            "c46": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nI made this for Grandma \u2026 I was going to say that.\n\u201cDrink first.\u201d\nGulp. The cold and sweet taste came into my mouth and I finally calmed down.\n\u201cHave you calmed down?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, thank you \u2026 Ah! I need to watch the news.\u201d\nI went to the front of the television right away and turned it on.\nAll channels were reporting about Suwon\u2019s dungeon. An anchor with a firm expression reported the dungeon in the studio, and soon the screen was connected to the live scene.\n\u2014 We will connect a reporter on Suwon to check the damage situation. Reporter Choi Sera! What\u2019s the situation at the scene?\u2014 Yes, as you can see from my side, the impact of the dungeon is quite large here. Transforming into an A-grade dark attribute dungeon, this whole area was literally devastated.\nBeyond the screen was chaos. Completely collapsed buildings, injured people, hunters rushing to evacuate people, and \u2026 the entrance to the dungeon where the space appears distorted.\n\u2014 The area is now closed and residents are evacuated, but the situation has literally turned into a chaos due to the occurrence of irregular shock waves.\u2014 According to the briefing by the Dungeon Management Office, many civilians, including elementary school students, were caught in the rift. Reporter Sera Choi, what\u2019s the rescue plan?\u2014 Yes, according to the survivors, many elementary school students were caught up when the rift occurred, and a hunter entered straight away to save them. It is not yet known who the hunter is, but it is presumed to be an E-class.\u2014 An emergency rescue party is now organized, and they will start as soon as the shock wave subsides. However, as it is a high-risk dark dungeon, thorough preparation is required.\nFrom there, the screen returned to the news studio. The anchor explained the dangers of dark attribute dungeons, but none of them came to my mind.\nFor a long time, I\u2019m just staring nervously at the news screen until the anchor delivered the news with an urgent expression.\n\u2014 Oh, right now! Breaking news just came in. I\u2019ll connect you to the site right away. Reporter Choi Sera!\u2014 Yes, I just got some surprising news at the site of the dungeon in Suwon \u2026 What? That\u2019s kind of absurd.\u2014 Calm down and tell me. What\u2019s the situation at the scene?\nInstead of answering, the camera lit the entrance to the dungeon emitting blue light.\n\u201c\u2026..!\u201d\nThrough the gap, I could see curly golden hair and familiar blue training suits.\nThank Goodness. Choi Yichan is unharmed.\nAt the moment of relief, the reporter shouted with an excited look from beyond the screen.\n\u2014 S-class! A new S-class hunter has been born\n\u2026. Huh?\n***\nAt the road that he happened to walk by, as soon as the rift broke out in front of his eyes, Choi Yichan jumped inside without hesitation. It was a waste of time to even think about it.\nThe moment he jumped into the gate, it was humid and acrid air that greeted Choi Yichan. Every time he breathed in, the unpleasant smell filled his lungs, and when he exhaled, his head ached.\nHis only weapon, a dagger, was taken out, but no strength went into his hand. It\u2019s because of this unpleasant air. The black and sticky thing mixed into his breath seemed to fill his lungs and made his body heavy.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ha.\u201d\nThe moment he wiped the sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand and fixed the dagger again.\nKkkkieee!\nAn insect-type monster with a black, glossy shell appeared and attacked Choi Yichan.\nSwish!\nChoi Yichan rolled to the side. The grass where he had just been was cut off by the sharp front paws of the monster.\nIf he had been a little late, it would have been his ankle, not the grass, that was cut.\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026\u201d\nSweat dripped down his eyes and made them sting.\nHe has to get his act together. If he doesn\u2019t come to his senses, the children won\u2019t be able to\u2026.\nSwish!\nAgain, the monster jumped at him.\nHe narrowly avoided the subsequent attack and swung his arms wide. The monster\u2019s shell cracked with an unpleasant sensation.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.!\u201d\nHe pressed down the dagger so hard that his arm trembled. After stabbing for a long time, the nucleus was finally destroyed.\n\u201cHaaa, haaa\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nHe defeated the monster at the end of a fierce battle, but his arm was wounded. The blood from the wound turned black as soon as it touched the air, giving off a strange smell.\nThe headache that had been tormenting him since earlier was getting worse, and now it was hard to control his body. If the monster appears again, victory will no longer be guaranteed.\nHe can\u2019t even see where the children are.\nHe needs to find them quickly and escape\u2026..\nLeading the heavy body, Choi Yichan thought.\n\u2018Why am I so weak?\u2019\nChoi Yichan wanted to be a hero.\nWhen he was a child, he was caught up in a rift near his home. At the moment when he thought he was dead, a Hunter who jumped into the rift alone saved him.\nHe wanted to save others like the Hunter who saved him. If there was someone in need around, he helped without hesitation. However, as an ordinary human being, there were few things he could do.\nThat\u2019s why he was happy when he\u2019s awakened.\nHow many times have you dreamed of this moment? The moment when he can save children in the same situation as himself with his own power.\nBut he\u2019s still powerless.\nChoi Yichan inadvertently fiddled with the pendant hanging from his neck. He kept wearing it around his neck as he was told not to take it off his body.\nIf it was a gift she gave him, he would happily keep even a roadside stone\u00a0\nHe knows best that Rieul has no other meaning. Nevertheless, the word \u2018reunion commemorative gift\u2018 lingered in his heart.\nChoi Yichan recalled Rieul\u2019s cafe. It still takes a lot of work, but it\u2019s a cozy space. He promised to help her again in the future.\nSo\u2026..\nRescue the children and return. He wanted to go back and drink the sweet coffee she made for him again.\nHaving made up his mind like that, he became hungry even though it didn\u2019t fit the situation.\n\u2018That\u2019s right, what Rieul gave me\u2026.\u2019\nShe told him to eat it when he enters the dungeon.\nHer repeatedly asking expression bothered him, that\u2019s why he kept it in mind.\nChoi Yichan opened the bag he received from Rieul. Inside, there was a meticulously packaged black jelly and a spoon.\nWhen he ate the jelly with the spoon, he could feel the strong coffee taste and sweetness together. It\u2019s unique but delicious.\n\u201cUgh\u2026..\u201d\nAfter eating all the jelly, the headache got worse and his heart pounded.\nThe moment his trembling knees bent and touched the ground.\n\u2026. a voice was heard.\n\u3010Do you need power?\u3011\n\u2018Where is this voice coming from?\u2019\nIt was a desolate field around, and there were no monsters or other survivors in sight yet.\nStill, the voice pierced his ears clearly. No, it seems to be speaking through a sense other than hearing.\n\u201cWho \u2026 who is it? If you\u2019re hiding, come out!\u201d\nSuddenly, Choi Yichan felt a hot sensation around his neck and reached out. A small black stone was caught in his fingertips. It was the pendant he got from Rieul.\nThe pendant was shining.\nThe black light whispered to him.\n\u3010Do you need power?\u3011\nThe voice is heard again.\nAt first he was surprised, then he was suspicious.\nWhy did he hear such a strange voice? It\u2019s been quite some time since he got caught up in the rift. Maybe he heard something nonsense in a state of extreme tension.\nHowever, the moment he held the pendant in his hand again, his senses realized it before his thoughts.\nIt\u2019s connected to the divine nature of the universe through dark ether contained in the pendant.\n\u3010Answer. So what\u2019s your answer? The power to make your wish come true.\u3011\nAs if led by the voice, Choi Yichan nodded his head.\n***\nI didn\u2019t mishear.\nThe reporter in the news screen clearly looked at Choi Yichan and said that he was an \u2018S-class hunter\u2019.\nDid Choi Yichan become an S-class? What happened to him in the dungeon that he suddenly became an S-class?\nIt is rare for a Hunter who has awakened once to raise the grade. Even if they do, it will only go up one level or not at all.\nAs expected, he would have obtained the S-class skills through the pendant and coffee jelly I gave him. Even so, is he going from E-class to S-class at once?\nThe children came out of the gate behind Choi Yichan. There were a few injuries, but everyone was well.\nChoi Yichan took the gate stone in his hand and put it in the entrance of the dungeon that emits blue light. As the ominous blue light subsided, the entrance, which seemed to pour out monsters at any moment, calmed down.\n\u2014 Woaaaaah!\nAt that moment, tremendous cheers and applause erupted. The scene was in a festive mood, forgetting the tension from before.\nThe broadcast did not continue properly due to the cheers, so the screen returned to the news studio in a hurry, but there was no difference. It was because the announcer in the studio was also in tears and gave a standing ovation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\n\u201cYes, really \u2026 it\u2019s a relief.\u201d\nThe festive atmosphere is understandable. That\u2019s because it was almost impossible for there to be no fatalities in A-grade dungeon.\nMoreover, somehow, Choi Yichan even got the gate stone.\nAlthough they are often used interchangeably, \u201crift\u201d and \u201cgate\u201d are strictly different concepts.\nFirst, dungeons occur with \u2018rifts\u2018 in the real world. This rift is very unstable, sucking in objects around it, and conversely, it spit out monsters.\nIf you defeated the boss in the dungeon, you can get an item called \u2018Gate Stone\u2018. If you put this item into a rift, the rift turns into a gate, and you can freely enter and exit without the risk of monsters popping out.\nSo, in general, when a dungeon occurs, the attack proceeds in four stages.\nRescue the victim who has been sucked into the rift.Organize an attack party and defeat the dungeon boss to obtain the gate stone.After that, Hunter enters the stabilized dungeon and proceeds with item farming and dungeon investigation.When sufficient investigation is completed, the dungeon is closed.\n\u2026.. It was stated in the book I borrowed from Jina.\nHowever, the fact that Choi Yichan came out with a gate stone means that he finished up to the second stage at once. It\u2019s also an A-grade dark dungeon.\nThis was like a miracle.\nThe news continued. The public officials of the Dungeon Management Office ran to Choi Yichan, and what he said in an excited fast tone was just aired on the news.\nAfter the situation calmed down a little, the interview began.\nAll the news, newspapers, and even the guild officials who were at the scene pointed their microphone to Choi Yichan.\nClick, click, click!\n\u2014 Hunter-nim! This way! Please look this way!\u2014 Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019ve been here since a while ago? Don\u2019t cut in line.\u2014 What did you pay here for?\u2014 Move back, Hunter Scope!\nThere was a brief disturbance in the heated interview atmosphere. Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the first words of a new S-class hunter that was born after a long time.\nChoi Yichan, who was in front of dozens of cameras and microphones, looked puzzled. He didn\u2019t seem to understand what had happened yet.\nHaha, he\u2019s popular.\nI\u2019m glad that Choi Yichan is alive, but besides that, to become an S-class hunter\u2026..\nI felt strange, yet thrilled.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\n1/3\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST!!!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c45": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? Woah \u2026 cups?\u201d\nThe bag was full of disposable paper cups and plastic cups. At a rough estimate, it looked like 500 each.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t an ordinary cup. The name \u2018Cafe Rieul\u2019 stamped on the center of the cup caught my eye.\n\u201cYou told me that you\u2019re opening a cafe soon. I made it because I thought you would need a takeout cup.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Grandma!\u201d\nAfter all, not all customers drink in the cafe. I didn\u2019t think of a take-out customer, but it was a must-have item.\n[Item: Custom Takeout Cup (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606) x 1000Type: Disposable CupNote: Preserve the condition of the drink. (2:00:00)]\nNot only that, but it also had a good effect. The retention time of drinks made with skills is only 30 minutes. However, if I put it in this cup, I can keep the drink for a longer period of time.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not enough, tell me anytime. I will make more for you.\u201d\n\u201cAhahaha \u2026 please do it then.\u201d\n500 for hot drinks, 500 for cold drinks. A total of 1000 cups. In addition, this quiet place is in front of the Great Dungeon Abyss..\nThe day come when I use up all these cups\u2026..\nHm \u2026. In about three years?\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful place.\u201d\n\u201cHaha \u2026 Thank you.\u201d\nGrandma, who looked around the cafe, admired it lightly.\nIn fact, it was quite crowded in the store now. On one side, I was roasting coffee in a roaster, and on the other, I was solidifying the sap of dungeon sugarcane.\nMieum and Lime, who just finished eating, even ran around the floor. Seriously, don\u2019t run, I\u2019m surprised.\n\u201cKyuu, kyuuuuu!\u201d\n\u201cMeoooong!\u201d\nTadadak.

I haven\u2019t even served coffee yet. Grandma, what do you like?\u201d\n\u201cWell, then I\u2019ll have a sweet and cool one.\u201d\n\u201cOkay!\u201d\nSweet and cool. I thought about it for a while while looking at the recipe list. There\u2019s ice cream coffee, but it\u2019s better to make a new menu.\nYeah, I\u2019ve decided. I checked and found all the ingredients. I decided to make an iced caramel macchiato.\nCold drinks were also not much different from hot drinks in the way they were made. Add caramel syrup, ice, and cold milk, then froth the milk separately and place it on the glass. Then, pour in the espresso and sprinkle with caramel drizzles.\nI handed the finished drink to Grandma.\n\u201cGrandma, here\u2019s the iced caramel macchiato.\u201d\n\u201cThank you \u2026 ah.\u201d\nWhile taking the glass, Grandma looked out of the window.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s there \u2026 ah.\u201d\nThe sky, which was clear in the morning, suddenly turned gray. Then, one by one, snowflakes fell from the sky and soon began to pour.\nAlready \u2026 the first snow?\nIt\u2019s only the end of October. I thought there would be some more time until the first snow fell.\nI looked up at the sky in bewilderment at the earlier-than-expected snow, and my phone vibrated loudly.\nIt was an ominous notification.\n***\nKi Yoohyun made his way through the narrow alleyway without hesitation.\n\u201cWait, let\u2019s go together, guild leader!\u201d\n\u201cHe told us not to call him a guild leader outside!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point now!\u201d\nThere is no time. The twins Joo Shinwoo and Joo Shinhee quickly chased after Ki Yoohyun, who had already become so far away.\nThe surrounding area was an ordinary villa village. Although it is far from the subway station, the rent is so cheap that it becomes a neighborhood where mainly students and young office workers live.\nOn the road leading to similar villas, Ki Yoohyun moved his legs without hesitation.\nHow long did he walk? Soon, he stopped walking in front of a building.\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nThe twins who followed Ki Yoohyun immediately opened their mouths.\n\u201cIs the suspect here?\u201d\n\u201cThe bad guy who\u2019s trying to kill an old lady!\u201d\n\u201cHowever, a simple attempted murder would be investigated by the Dungeon Management Office. Guild leader \u2026 no, is there a reason why Hunter-nim is looking for it himself?\u201d\n\u201cYou idiot! Guild leader \u2026 no, Hunter-nim is trying to kill that bad guy himself!\u201d\n\u201cAre you stupid? Guild leader \u2026 no, do you think that Hunter-nim is as mindless as you?\u201d\nHis head was throbbing.\n\u201c\u2026.Quiet.\u201d\nAt Ki Yoohyun\u2019s words, the twins shut their mouths. He rolled his eyes and look around.\nAs he walked up the stairs of the deserted villa, Ki Yoohyun was lost in thought.\nThe incident in which Craftsman Kim Deokyi was attacked also happened in the past timeline. However, the timing was different. In the first timeline, it was a few months later, so he let his guard down.\nHow foolish of someone like him, who even returned to the past.\nKi Yoohyun recalled the image of Kwon Rieul, who smiled while saying that she\u2019s okay, even though she had burns on her palm. It wouldn\u2019t have happened if he hadn\u2019t escorted her into the workshop.\n\u2026. So, the wound is his own responsibility.\nWhile looking at the scene in such regret, he found a weapon dropped there.\nIt wasn\u2019t an ordinary knife. Although the grade was low, it was a sword dedicated to hunters that had a good length of use. The sword\u2019s handle was engraved with a name. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s there for someone to find it.\nStill, no matter how stupid the criminal is,\u00a0he will not be thoughtless enough to abandon a weapon with his name on it. It was highly likely that someone left it on purpose.\nFurthermore, the unique ether on the weapon was weighing on his mind.\nDark, black \u2026 unpleasant ether. He had smelled something like this somewhere. Although it was a small amount, his sensitive senses did not miss it.\n\u2018Then \u2026 the owner of this sword may not be safe already.\u2019\nThe destination was the top floor.\nHe knocked on the door and at the same time read the etheric flow through the door, but there is no sign of activity inside. Ki Yoohyun opened the door without delay.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s here.\u201d\n\u201cThis \u2026 it\u2019s like an armor.\u201d\nJoo Shinhee picked up a clothes from the messy floor. It has a colorful design reminiscent of a peacock.\n\u201c\u2026.We are a step late.\u201d\n\u201cDid he run away?\u201d\n\u201cThe wanted will be issued soon, so it appears that he has fled.\u201d\nThe room was a mess due to the daily necessities and clutter. The owner appeared to have left home in a hurry after causing the incident.\nOr made it look like that.\nThere\u2019s only one way. He doesn\u2019t want to use it that much because it\u2019s dealing with causality and everything.\nKi Yoohyun sighed lightly and looked around the small room.\n\u201cStay away.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..!\u201d\nThe twins took a couple of steps back with a nervous expression. After confirming that they were far enough apart, he used the skill.\nHis skill name, The Power of White Light.\nIt is a unique skill that placed Ki Yoohyun at the top of the ranking. However, few people know exactly what skill it is. Only the fact that it deals with space was known.\nIt was the first time for twins who hadn\u2019t been in the guild for a long time to actually see them.\n[The Blessing of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 applies.][Skill: The Power of White Light (S) is activated.[\u203b Caution: Excessive intervention may be resisted by causality.]\nAt the next instant, the mass of the air changes. Although it was definitely the same space, the air was heavy unlike before. The twins felt as if a transparent curtain was blocking them.\nFine particles of light surrounded the entire room, and soon the extended senses began to read information.\nThere is only one thing. The ether buried in the sword found at the scene.\n[Matching information found.]\nKi Yoohyun picked up an object that had been thrown away unnoticed in one corner of the room.\nIt was a small ornamental decoration that usually attached to a sword. The moment he saw the clear star shape carved in the center, Ki Yoohyun\u2019s eyes became fierce.\n\u201c\u2026..Guild leader?\u201d\nNo matter how long time has passed, there is no way he can\u2019t recognize this. This is the symbol of the Church of Starry Wisdom.\nIt\u2019s a clear evidence that the enemy has already begun to move.\nThe moment the corner digs into his skin, who\u2019s grasping the decoration tightly and forgetting about the pain\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026.Oh!\u201d\nJoo Shinwoo looked out of the villa\u2019s window and sounded surprised.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? \u2026 Ah.\u201d\nIt snowed.

            "c44": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cHuh? Lime? Ah, I picked it up right in front.\u201d\nActually, it was a slime that I bumped into in the tutorial dungeon, but I said it with a little adaptation.\n\u201cI see. I asked because I wanted to raise slime, too.\u201d\n\u201cHow about buying one?\u201d\n\nIt was not uncommon among hunters to raise slimes as companion monsters. It\u2019s relatively easy to tame, harmless, and it\u2019s cute. Slime ASMR videos were also popular, and a hunter\u2019s slime gained popularity on YouTube and even released goods.\nIt is also easy to get a rental. All you have to do is pay a Hunter from Tamer class and ask them to sell it.\nHowever, Choi Yichan shook his head with an ambiguous expression.\n\u201cUmh \u2026 I\u2019ve looked into that once.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThere are so many people who want to buy slime from Tamer. It\u2019s okay to have to wait a long time. If you take out the number ticket and wait, your turn will come one day.\nThe problem is that the Tamers are starting to screen people. Only hunters from a large guild, famous hunters, or even the high-ranking hunters could get slimes.\nCurrently, Choi Yichan\u2019s Hunter-grade is E. It was the entrance cut.\nIn sumarry\u2026.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve changed your mind\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHahahaha\u2026..\u201d\nEven though it\u2019s common knowledge, it\u2019s really disgusting that they discriminate even when it comes to buy a slime.\nChoi Yichan murmured, drooping his shoulders.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I need to find another job instead of Hunter.\u201d\n\u201cUh \u2026 why?\u201d\n\u201cEven if I\u2019m an Awakened, I\u2019m just an E-class. I don\u2019t think I can do very well\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Yichan-ah.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha! It\u2019s a joke, I\u2019m kidding it! I just said it!\u201d\nContrary to what he said, there was a sense of discouragement that could not be erased with a laughter.\nI remembered being neglected in the Hunter Market. Did he go through something similar?\n\u201cThen do you want to work part-time at our store?\u201d\nIt was half a joke, but Choi Yichan laughed out loud.\n\u201cOh, great! Please let me do it.\u201d\nHowever, as far as I know, there is no one more suitable for a Hunter than Choi Yichan\u2026.\nI mean\u2026.\nIt was just the time when the coffee jelly hardened. I opened the refrigerator and took out the glass. When I slightly pressed the jelly with a spoon, I felt the elasticity.\nDone, It hardened well.\nIt would be delicious to sprinkle whipped cream or condensed milk on top, but I skipped it this time because it\u2019s not something to eat right now.\nIt would be nice to eat jelly made by reducing the amount of gelatin in a cold drink. Maybe I\u2019ll try it next time. \n[Item: Coffee Jelly (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)Status: Very DarkEffect: When consumed, you develop caffeine addiction in one shot.\u203b Be careful with your intake.]\nAs soon as I entered the recipe name, the item window popped up. Done, the effect of \u2018caffeine addiction at once\u2018 was written on it.\nAmong the skills that Choi Yichan has not acquired, there are two S-ranks. If he has the pendant and this coffee jelly, he can get the \u2018The Light that Illuminates The Darkness (S)\u2019 and \u2018Coffee is My Strength (S)\u2019.\nThe grade determined by the sum of the status and the skill grade are separate matters. However, if he gets two S-class skills, even if Choi Yichan is an E-class, he won\u2019t be ignored like before. No matter how rude and disrespectful tamers are, they\u2019ll sell slime to him then.\nI wrapped the coffee jelly well in a bag and held it out to Choi Yichan.\n\u201cYichan-ah, this is \u2026 later, later.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nHe looked at me with a friendly smile.\n\u201cLater\u2026..\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cLater, when you enter a dungeon.\u201d\n\u201cDungeon? Hey, I\u2019m not even a member of a guild, so what\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cStill! You can go in there. You might suddenly get caught up in a rift. After all, it\u2019s a dangerous world.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Uh.\u201d\n\u201cThen, when you enter a dungeon, be sure to eat this right away. It will be easy to eat because it contains a lot of sugar. If you eat it then \u2026 It\u2019ll help you.\u201d\nI really wish he won\u2019t go. No matter whether there is a dungeon in Suwon on a snowy day, or people are in danger because of it.\nLeave such work to the Dungeon Management Office, the Big Three Guild, or stronger hunters. I hope Choi Yichan stays in a safe place.\nI wanted to tell him that if it wasn\u2019t for the system\u2019s interference, you shouldn\u2019t enter the dungeon even now.\nBut \u2026 even if I tell him what I know about the future, Choi Yichan will make the same choice. Because he has a kind and friendly personality. He wouldn\u2019t be able to turn a blind eye to the children caught up in the dungeon.\nIn the end, I even returned, but all I could do was give him the pendant and this jelly.\n\u201cOkay, I got it. I will eat well.\u201d\nAgain, Choi Yichan accepted the coffee jelly without asking anything.\nHe didn\u2019t forget to add, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely come to help you next time.\u201d.\n***\n[Congratulations!

            "c43": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nLet\u2019s calm down. It\u2019s too early to be disappointed.\nMaybe there\u2019s a hidden effect on the skill. I tried using the skill with hope.\n\u2018The Floor is Shiny.\u2019\nShashashak.\n\nA light gesture swept away the dust on the floor. Within a few minutes, the floor was clean without a  speck of dust. I could see my blank face reflected on the smooth floor.\n\u201c\u2026.Waeoong?!\u201d\nIt was so clean that Mieum, who stepped on the floor, slipped.\nIt\u2019s convenient. It\u2019s useful, but when you think of hunter skills, you would think of something cooler.\n\u201cHa\u2026.\u201d\nAs I looked at the signboard and the skill window, the time has already turned into noon, and Choi Yichan came to the store.\nToday, I called Choi Yichan to the store. I planned to give him the pendant as a gift with a reasonable excuse.\n\u201cKwon Ri, hi!\u201d\nChoi Yichan was wearing light sportswear today as well. As he entered, he was surprised to see the shiny floor.\n\u201cOw, this place is really clean.\u201d\n\u201cThanks \u2026 oh, would you like something to drink?\u201d\n\u201cI would love to. Then, just like before.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nHowever, Choi Yichan, who drank two cups of ice cream coffee in succession, found a signboard left in the corner.\n\u201cOh! Is this your shop sign? Do you want me to put it on for you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d\nIt was a 100% sincere refusal with no lies. However, Choi Yichan accepted this as a politeness.\n\u201cHey, is it because it\u2019s heavy? Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m an Awakened, this is nothing! Trust me.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s really all right\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIf you hang it over there, it will look good. Right?\u201d\n\u201cUh, huh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWait, I\u2019ll put it on for you in a minute.\u201d\nEventually, Choi Yichan found nails and hammers from the warehouse and immediately began to put up the signboard in the suitable place.\nIndeed, Choi Yichan was always like this even before the regression. He likes to help others, and he finished the work he was supposed to do once without any fuss. It felt strange to see Choi Yichan, who was still the same person as he was before the regression.\nBut now that I have the pendant, the same accident won\u2019t be happened twice.\nWhile Choi Yichan was putting up the sign, I also have work to do. It was making a menu that made the drinker addicted to caffeine in one shot.\n\u2018The Bond of a Cup of Coffee.\u2019\nThere was one thing that caught my attention among Choi Yichan\u2019s skill list I checked last time.\n[Coffee is My Strength (S) /Unacquired/(Lv.1) Attack power increases by 800% when in caffeine addiction\u203b This skill has not been acquired yet.How to acquire: Attempt to attack while intoxicated with caffeine.]\nIt works pretty well. It increases the attack power by 800%, so it\u2019ll be helpful if he can get it.\nThe problem is that he has to be addicted to caffeine.\nAccording to my experience so far, someone has to drink four cups of coffee to develop caffeine addiction.\nHowever, it would be difficult to go into the dungeon and drink four cups of coffee in an emergency. What if a monster attacks while drinking the coffee?\nSo, I decided to find a way to become addicted to caffeine in one shot.\n\u201cLike this \u2026 can I do this?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu?\u201d\nAs I adjusted the settings of the espresso machine, Mieum and Lime leaned their heads.\n\u201cTo extract a ristretto.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that!\u201d\nIgnoring the curious animals, I adjusted the grinder settings, and then used the skill.\n\u2018The Barista\u2019s Extraction.\u2019\nSoon, the machine began to extract a thick ristretto.\n\u201c\u2026.There we go.\u201d\nAbout 15ml of thicker and heavier coffee was made. It was more concentrated as it was extracted with half the volume of espresso.\nStill, this alone is not enough.\nI repeated the same process a few more times, adding four shots of ristretto to the glass. And this time, \u2018The Barista\u2019s Extraction.\u2019 was used again for this extracted coffee. It was to concentrate the ristretto once again.\nDripping. The black, sticky liquid fell into the glass.\u00a0Due to the effect of the skill, the capacity was further reduced, and only half of the glass was filled.\nAs soon as all the undiluted liquid was put into the glass, a new status window appeared.\n[Item: Dark Coffee Extract (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)It\u2019s a very concentrated undiluted coffee.Because it\u2019s too strong, you get caffeine addiction at once when you drink it.Be careful with your intake.]\nI succeeded!\nI did succeed, but \u2026 is it possible for Choi Yichan, who only likes sweet coffee, to drink this?\nThe undiluted liquid in the glass smelled very strong and bitter. I dipped the tip of the spoon a little and tasted it, and that alone caused the strong taste blew in my mouth.\n\u201cMieum-ah, Lime-ah, look at this for a second.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, do you need my help!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026..?\u201d\nI held out a glass of undiluted liquid to the animals.\nMieum, who sniffed it slightly, raised her hair up and flew off her front paw wildly.\n\u201cKiyaoooo! What is that, you\u2019re trying to kill me!\u201d\n\u201cKyuuuuuuuuu.\u201d\nLime didn\u2019t even come close at all because it smelled bad.\nThis should not be the case. No matter how much I wanted him to get the skill, I didn\u2019t want to feed him something that didn\u2019t taste good. If it\u2019s Choi Yichan, he\u2019ll spit it out as soon as he put it in his mouth. I need to find a way.\n\u201cI need to use it.\u201d\nI first took out the sugar I had made. Next, there was one more material needed.\n\u2018The Dimensional Shop.\u2019\n[Dimensional Shop]Welcome! This is a shop that connects multi-dimensional gaps.The Eligibles can purchase the items they need.\nItem update time: 12:00:00 left]\nI opened the system window and called up the Dimension Shop.\nThe Dimensional Shop was updated once every 24 hours, at midnight, before that, you have to pay rubies to renew the items.\nI was worried if there was no item I wanted on the list, but fortunately, I was able to find it right away without renewing it.\n\u201cI found it.\u201d\nWhen I paid for the ruby and accepted the item, Mieum opened her eyes wide next to me.\n\u201cWhat are you going to buy that for!\u201d\n\u201cFufu, you\u2019ll see. This is all I need.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks like paper, meow!\u201d\nThe item I bought was gelatin. I decided to make coffee jelly using this gelatin.\nJelly is tastier than the undiluted solution and is easier to eat. The making process was also easy and simple. I put cold water in a bowl first, then put gelatin and let it soak for a while.\nWhile waiting for the gelatin, sugar was mixed into the coffee extract.\n\u201cHmm \u2026 should I add a little more?\u201d\nI splashed in sugar without sparing it. It was because the taste of the undiluted solution was so strong that a small amount of sugar was coated. Sweetness is a measure of taste.\nStir thoroughly with a spoon and dissolve the sugar until it does not rustle.\n\u201cAre you trying to make poison!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026\u2026..?\u201d\nNext to me, Mieum and Lime looked distrustful, but I ignored them.\n\u201cCan you just have a faith in me?\u201d\nJust in time, the gelatin was properly softened by the water. I mixed gelatin in a bowl of coffee extract.\nFinally, the liquid was transferred to an appropriately sized glass cup. Now, all U have to do is put this glass cup in the refrigerator to harden it.\n\u201cKwon Ri, what are you doing?\u201d\nI put the coffee jelly in the refrigerator, and Choi Yichan just returned.\n\u201cI was making a new menu.\u201d\n\u201cReally? I want to try it, too.\u201d\n\u201cYap, we still have to wait until it\u2019s done, but \u2026 I\u2019ll let you eat later.\u201d\nLater, after the dungeon explodes.\n\u201cI put up the signboard. Do you want to see if it\u2019s crooked?\u201d\n\u201cUh, huh\u2026.\u201d\nThere was a big sign on the red brick wall. I don\u2019t know how much Choi Yichan paid attention to it. It was straight. not even a millimeter crooked.\nThe good news was that it wasn\u2019t that bad when we put it on.\nI didn\u2019t feel the simple yet glamorous, familiar yet unique, classic and, modern touch. Unknowingly, I kept looking at the sign, and I felt the urge to enter the store.\nPerhaps this is the effect of a signboard that attracts the customers\u2019 attention.\nYes, when it comes to appearance or performance, it is the nature of K-gamers to choose performance. That\u2019s how I ended my self-justification.\nWell, I need to repay Choi Yichan for this.\n\u201cYichan-ah, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a reward, but \u2026 I have something for you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? No, no! This isn\u2019t hard at all! Feel free to let me know if there\u2019s anything else I can do for you. There\u2019s no need for reward.\u201d\n\u201cTake this.\u201d\nI handed the pendant to Choi Yichan.\nIt was a very awkward situation to hand over the pendant as a gift, not as anything else. In addition, the simple design, a black stone the size of a little fingernail, seemed suspicious at first glance.\nHowever, in order to acquire the skill, it was necessary to wear this pendant for more than 24 hours. I was in the midst of contemplating what to explain if Choi Yichan felt suspicious.\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nWith a careful touch, he accepted the pendant. His cheeks were slightly red. He seemed shy.\nHuh?\nOnly then did I suddenly realize that giving accessories can be seen as meaningful. I didn\u2019t think of that because I was only focused on how to save Choi Yichan.\nFurthermore, simple design is a design that is good for a gift.\nNo, no, no. Choi Yichan, what are you doing! When we were students, we used to look down on each other during self-study!\nChoi Yichan must have felt the same way. I added an explanation in a hurry.\n\u201cHey, there\u2019s nothing strange about it! It happened by chance, but I thought it would suit you well! It\u2019s some sort of reunion gift, something like that?\u201d\nThe more I explain it, the more I feel like I\u2019m screwed\u2026.\n\u201cI know. You don\u2019t mean anything else.\u201d\nChoi Yichan hung the pendant right around his neck.\n\u201cThank you. I like it.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks good on you. I hope you don\u2019t take it off your body and wear it for more than a day.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I will do that.\u201d\nWithout asking the reason, he nodded his head.\nHe\u2019s my friend, but he\u2019s so nice. Anyway, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m forcing him to buy a fake crystal necklace that purifies his qi.\nI worried about it for a moment, but seeing the black stone fluttering around his neck gave me peace of mind.\n***\nWhile waiting for the coffee jelly to harden, Choi Yichan played with the animals inside the store. Mieum and Lime, who were bored, welcomed the new player.\nThe problem was that Choi Yichan\u2019s physical strength was different from mine.\n\u201cCome on, grab this. Here.\u201d\nChoi Yichan grabbed the stalk of the dungeon sugarcane and shook it back and forth.\nThe leaves fluttered in front of her eyes, but Mieum, who was already exhausted, could not even raise her front feet properly.\n\u201cMeong, waeooong (I can\u2019t do it anymore)\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuuuu\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cMeoooong (This human, how can he not get tired)!\u201d\nWith a pathetic cry, Mieum and Lime completely stretched out to the floor. Choi Yichan, who finally let them go, said abruptly.\n\u201cRieul-ah, where did you get this slime from?\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI hope no one gets triggered by friendzone \ud83d\ude00\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST!\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c42": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nYesterday, after handing me the pendant, Grandma went back to the hospital.\nKi Yoohyun also said he need to go because he has something to do.\n\u201cDo you have something to do? Now?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have an urgent business to take care of.\u201d\n\nThe eyes that said that were sharp, without even the slightest smile. \u2018Take care of\u2018 doesn\u2019t seem to be something like going to the post office or bank transfer.\nStill, both of us stayed up all night. Are you not tired? People need to sleep on time.\nI urged him out of pity.\n\u201cWould you like to have some coffee at the store?\u201d\n\u201cI really want to, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll stop by next time.\u201d\nUmh, then there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.\nBy the time I left Ki Yoohyun and returned to the store, it was almost noon.\nI stayed up all night, but I wasn\u2019t tired thanks to the high-quality potion Ki Yoohyun gave me. With the joy of finally getting a dark etheric item, my steps were rather light.\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\nFirst of all, I have to feed Mieum and Lime, then contact Choi Yichan and hand him the pendant.\n\u201cDid you take good care of the house?\u201d\nHowever, I couldn\u2019t hear Mieum and Lime\u2019s answers.\n\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me!\nI checked the floor first. However, the floor is still clean. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t make a mess of the store with the footprint stamp like last time.\nSo \u2026 where and what are they doing?\n\u201cMieum-ah? Lime-ah? What\u2019s wrong, are you still sleeping?\u201d\nOh, there she is.\n\u201c\u2026.meooong.\u201d\nSuddenly, Mieum appeared from the corner.\nBut instead of coming close immediately, she swung her paw strangely from afar.\n\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\n\u201cMeooong\u2026.\u201d\nI can\u2019t hear you.\n\u201cWhat is it? Mieum-ah, why don\u2019t you come here and tell me?\u201d\nThe answer came from someone other than Mieum.\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming quickly.\u201d\n\u201cA-aargh!\u201d\nI was startled by the cold voice that suddenly interrupted me.\nThe person, who was sitting in a chair, got up. The action caused Lime, who was on his lap, cried and bounced to the floor.\nThe owner of the voice was Kwon Jiwoon.\nWhoa, I was surprised. I thought he was a thief. Why the hell is Kwon Jiwoon here at this hour?\n\u201cKiyaoong (Where have you been! That man came all of a sudden this morning)!\u201d\nPerhaps a lot of complaints were piled up, Mieum threw her front paws at me.\nAccording to Mieum, Kwon Jiwoon suddenly came this morning. What\u2019s more, he has been waiting all this time knowing I\u2019m not here. Without a word, staying still.\nIt\u2019s a very worrying situation for Mieum, who wants to run around to her heart\u2019s content.\n\u201cWaeoooooong (It\u2019s irresponsible to leave us alone with that human)!\u201d\n\u201cI had a reason, too.\u201d\nI asked Kwon Jiwoon while patting Mieum\u2019s chin gently.\n\u201cWhat happened all of a sudden? Aren\u2019t you busy?\u201d\nNo matter how much I thought about it, there was nothing for Kwon Jiwoon to suddenly come to see me.\nWhy did you wait for me here for hours when you must be busy with guild work?\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nFlinch. His eyes shook. Kwon Jiwoon did not answer for a moment with a stiff expression.\nI waited patiently for his words. The words that came out after a long time were unexpected.\n\u201cI\u2019m just here to give this back.\u201d\nTak.\nKwon Jiwoon put a stainless steel thermos on the table.\nAh. I put Americano in that thermos last time. I completely forgot about it.\nBut \u2026 it\u2019s not something that needs to be delivered directly. We\u2019re cousins, but we don\u2019t see each other often.\n\u201cYou can ask someone else to do it.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026\u201d\nIs it because of the mood? Lime\u2019s nonsensical cry sounded like it was reprimanding me.\n\u201cOr just leave it there.\u201d\n\u201cWaeooong\u2026.\u201d\nThis time, Mieum glared at me.\nNo, why, what. Why are you looking at me with an expression that I said something senseless? Did I say something weird?\n\u201cMeooong (No, you\u2019re screwed up).\u201d\nI felt weird being treated like this by a cat.\nHe\u2019s come all the way here, so I can\u2019t tell him to leave right away. Above all, as if pushed by the silent pressure from Mieum and Lime, I offered him coffee.\n\u201cUmh, now that you\u2019re here, would you like to have a cup of coffee?\u201d\nI just said it. I asked once out of courtesy.\nOf course, I thought Kwon Jiwoon would refuse. Even when I gave him coffee in that thermos before, he didn\u2019t welcome it.\n\u201cYes, shall we?\u201d\n\u201cHuh \u2026 aren\u2019t you busy with the guild?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not always that busy.\u201d\nWell, then.\nAfter that, I decided to make the quest menu, vanilla latte and caramel macchiato. I took out the vanilla powder and caramel syrup I bought from the Dimensional Shop.\nThe vanilla latte was made in a similar way to the cafe latte. First, put vanilla powder in a glass, then pour espresso to dissolve it well. Next, pour the steamed milk with soft foam into the glass and it\u2019s done.\n[Item: Vanilla Latte (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:30:00)Effect: When using a skill, there is a 100% chance of a critical hit for 1 time.]\nThe caramel macchiato was also not difficult, but the order of putting it into the glass was different. Put the caramel syrup in a glass and pour the steamed milk first. Next, when the espresso is poured, the surface of the drink is marked with brown dots.\nFinally, it was completed by sprinkling caramel drizzle in the shape of a honeycomb.\n[Item: Caramel Macchiato (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:30:00)Removes a random status abnormality.]\nBoth glasses have a pretty good effect.\nI left the vanilla latte for myself, and handed the caramel macchiato to Kwon Jiwoon.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nGulp.\nThe moment the other person takes a sip of my coffee\u2026.\nThis moment is always tense. Especially, it\u2019s Kwon Jiwoon. Maybe it\u2019s because we feel distant even though we\u2019re cousin.\nKwon Jiwoon, who drank the caramel macchiato, was quiet for a while. He just gently stroked the cup with his fingertips. His expression is also cold, his usual expressionless face, so I have no idea what he is thinking.\n\u201c\u2026.Strange.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wh-what?\u201d\nUnknowingly, I was nervous at the low voice.\n\u201cIt seems that every time I drink the coffee you give me, I feel better. My potion addiction is finally gone.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, it must be a coincidence.\u201d\nI laughed without realizing it. I was happy to know that the coffee I made was working properly.\nThe bar of light that appeared above his head slowly fills up. There was no \u2018you made a deep connection with coffee\u2018 notification, but I was happy nonetheless.\n\u201c\u2026.Kwon Rieul.\u201d\n\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI told you to move the cafe to the first floor of our guild before.\u201d\n\u2026 Gulp.\n\u201cLet\u2019s forget about it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to move \u2026 uh? Really?\u201d\n\u201cYou followed our grandmother well, so it may be natural that this happened.\u201d\nWas it an illusion that those small muffled words sounded bitter?\n\u201cGood luck.\u201d\nAfter leaving those words, Kwon Jiwoon went back after drinking all the caramel macchiato.\nAdmit it \u2026 did you get it? Like in a cooking cartoon, you drink a cup of coffee and feel touched, \u201cIf it\u2019s you, you can do well here!\u201c, is this that kind of situation?\nWhile I was bewildered, a system notification popped up.\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Main Quest: The Path of The Barista (2)\u2019.Please collect the reward.]\n[Main Quest: The Path of The Barista (2)You\u2019re a confident barista now.Increase the sales menu by completing the cafe\u2019s five basic menus (caf\u00e9 latte, cappuccino, cafe mocha, vanilla latte, and caramel macchiato).Complete the 5 basic cafe menus: 5/5]\n[Rewards: Experience (200 EXP), Random Recipe, ???]\nAmong the quest completion rewards, \u2018???\u2019 was the only item other than experience and recipes. So please, I hope it\u2019s a good thing.\nWith a pounding heart, I chose to collect the rewards.\n[Experience: 200 EXP have been acquired.][You have reached Level 6.][You have acquired the new recipes: ice menus.]\nThud!\nThen, a heavy sound pounded the floor.\n[The volume of the reward is too large to be received in the inventory.][The reward is automatically generated outside your inventory.]\n\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d\nIn this case, I have no choice but to have expectations.\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that something big is always good, but how big is it that it doesn\u2019t even fit in the inventory?\nIs it furniture?\nWhy not, Cafe Management games always have interior decoration elements. I thought it would be nice to put a piece of furniture in the empty space over there.\nI checked the reward with excitement\u2026.\nHence, this signboard appeared.\n\u201c\u2026..earthworm?\u201d\n\u201cWaeooong (Earthworm)\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu\u2026..\u201d\nThe cries of Mieum and Lime felt sad.\nA squiggly line was drawn on the signboard. To put it bluntly, I would call it an avant-garde design.\nNo way, I don\u2019t want to believe it, but \u2026. the name of the cafe is \u2018Cafe Rieul\u2018, so did the shape of the letter \u2018\u3139\u2018 symbolize it?\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nWell, let\u2019s just put it in the warehouse. There\u2019s no way I have to hang this on the wall.\nI was trying to drag the signboard and move it to the warehouse, but the system notification popped up again.\n[Special effects are applied when signboard is installed.][Item: Signboard of Cafe Rieul (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)]Type: SignThe signboard of <Cafe Rieul>.

Please collect the reward.]\nWhen Grandma Kim Deokyi\u2019s workshop caught fire, this notification popped up.\nThis is the second crisis after the last time, how many times are there? Why do I have to go through a death crisis when I\u2019m just running a cafe?\nAside from this uncomfortable feeling, the reward was \u2018Random Skill Point 1\u2018. In other words, it would mean that it randomly raises a skill level by one. \nI don\u2019t have a good memory with the word random. Before collecting the reward, I checked the skill list. In the meantime, there were also new skills, so there were a total of six skills.\nCafe in My Hand (C)Details: (Lv. 1) When making drinks in the store, the level of perfection is increased.The Floor is Shiny (E)Details: (Lv. 1) You can quickly clean the toilets.Smile (C)Details: (Lv. 1) Smiling makes you feel better.[The Barista\u2019s Extraction\u00a0(D)Details: (Lv.2) Extract only the desired substance from the mixed substances.][The Barista\u2019s Eyes (D)Details: (Lv.1) You can find the ingredients.][The Bond of a Cup of Coffee (B)Details: (Lv.1) You can copy the skill of the person who drank the Ultimate Coffee.\nWell, among these, the level goes up randomly.\nIt\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s not \u2018Smile\u2018 and \u2018The Floor is Shiny\u2018.

            "c41": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cGrandma, are you awake?\u201d\n\u201cUh.\u2026.\u201d\nIt was at dawn when Grandma, Kim Deokyi, opened her eyes.\nIt was fortunate that Ki Yoohyun had a potion and we were able to treat the wound in the abdomen immediately. After that, she was admitted to the hospital where the rest of the wounds were treated.\n\nThe doctor said it would have been dangerous if it was a little late because she was old and the cut was not good.\n\u201cSir, why can\u2019t Grandma wake up? Don\u2019t tell me \u2026 are there any other abnormalities?\u201d\nEven though all the trauma was treated, Grandma was still unconscious.\nThe explanation given by the tired doctor as he rummaged through the charts was not very reassuring.\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s old \u2026 she had a lot of shocks on her body. I think we have to wait a little longer.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d\nBefore moving to the hospital, we immediately reported the incident to the police, but neither the assailant who stabbed Grandma nor the arsonist could be caught.\nI remembered the man I ran into at the entrance to the workshop. I remembered the strangely hurried footsteps of a man who wore his hat tightly. It was clear that he was the culprit.\n\u2018I think I\u2019ve seen that person somewhere\u2026.\u2019\nHis face was covered by the hat, but his body shape and jawline were somehow familiar.\nIt would have been helpful if I looked more closely. I felt sorry for it was regrettable.\nThere was nothing I could do now. Still, didn\u2019t want to go back, leaving Grandma alone, so I decided to stay at the hospital.\nKi Yoohyun also remained in the hospital room.\nOh, come to think of it, I couldn\u2019t even say thank you due to the hecticness.. If he hadn\u2019t come on time, I would have been really in danger.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, you saved my life. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nHe, who was standing next to me, came closer to me.\nWithout realizing it, I took a step back.\nOne more step forward.\nI took another step back, too.\nKi Yoohyun asked as I continued to step back with a gap of two steps.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d\nI know it looks weird, but I couldn\u2019t bear to see his face up close. This is because I have not yet developed immunity to that sparkling face.\nEspecially when he ran into the entrance of the burning workshop, he almost looked like a savior.\nUgh, it\u2019s blinding.\n\u201cSo \u2026 anyway, just go ahead.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..Ha.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun gave up on approaching me and pointed to my hand instead.\n\u201cI hope you get treatment.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\nI looked into my palm. I was injured while trying to escape with Grandma. It\u2019s a little bit hurt, but not severe.\n\u201cThis is okay, I can apply medicine later.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun frowned slightly as if he didn\u2019t like my answer.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYes? What?\u201d\nNo matter how much I thought about it, I couldn\u2019t think of anything for him to apologize to me. However, Ki Yoohyun looked very distressed.\n\u201cI was complacent. I shouldn\u2019t have let Rieul-ssi go alone \u2026 I was careless because I thought there was still time left. The future can change as much as it wants.\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s talking about\u2026.\nHe said he\u2019s sorry for putting me in danger alone \u2026 but how can Ki Yoohyun predict that an arsonist would appear in Grandma Kim Deokyi\u2019s workshop today? Yeah, even as a regressor, I didn\u2019t know that.\nKi Yoohyun, who was looking at me with an apologetic expression, took a bottle from his inventory and sprinkled what was inside on my hand.\n\u201cUwah, it\u2019s cold \u2026. Oh?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised. It\u2019s a potion.\u201d\nAs soon as the transparent liquid was sprayed on the palm, the wound began to heal. The palm of the hand quickly returned to a state without a scratch. Not only that, but somehow I felt energized and relieved from fatigue.\nAt that moment, a notification sounded.\n[The status has been restored to the maximum by the effect of the Advanced Potion (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606).]\nJust by looking at the name, it looked too expensive to be used for scratches on the palm.\n\u201c\u2026.Thank you.\u201d\nAfter thanking him awkwardly, there was silence again.\nThe police came for a while, but they returned after saying that the case would be transferred to to the Dungeon Management Ofice. It\u2019s because the culprit who stabbed Grandma is most likely a Hunter.\nTrying to kill such a good person\u2026.\nThey have to be caught and thrown in jail. I swallowed my anger inwardly.\nKi Yoohyun must have felt the same way as me.\n\u201cThe culprit \u2026 will be caught, right?\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be caught.\u201d\nGiven that he answered the question with a sense of urgency.\nThen, I suddenly remembered Ki Yoohyun\u2019s skill.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for Ki Yoohyun\u2019s skill, it would have been a very dangerous moment. This is because the fire spread too quickly in the barrel where the arsonist sprayed gasoline.\nHowever, the skill was really mysterious. As soon as the delicate particles of light became dense nets and covered the surroundings, the texture of the air changed.\nIs it a magic skill? No, it\u2019s a little more\u2026.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, the skill you used earlier\u2026..\u201d\nThe moment I was about to ask what the skill is\u2026.\nThe nurse called us to inform that Grandma woke up. I forgot what I was going to say and rushed to Grandma.\n\u201cGrandma, how are you?\u201d\nGrandma, who only blinked for a while, opened her lips. A faint trembling voice came out.\n\u201c\u2026.What happened?\u201d\n\u201cI went to the workshop today and you collapsed, so I took you to the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cThe workshop \u2026 Ah!\u201d\nGrandma jumped to her feet.\nIt was such a strong force that it was hard to believe that she\u2019s an injured person. In her eyes, a fiery spark flashed. She seems to have remembered what had happened.\n\u201cLie down more. You still need to rest.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to the workshop?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026. there was a fire, but it is now extinguished \u2026 Grandma?!\u201d\nBefore I could finish speaking, Grandma got up from the bed and left the hospital room.\nThere was no time to stop her because she was so fast.\n\u201cWait, Grandma, let\u2019s go together!\u201d\nKi Yoohyun and I chased after her in a hurry.\n***\nThe eastern sky is bright in the twilight.\nArriving at the entrance of the workshop, Grandma collapsed.\n\u201cAh, unbelievable\u2026.!\u201d\nThe workshop building was a mess. Numerous items were broken or burned. The black soot showed how terrible the fire that hit this place was.\nKi Yoohyun approached the grieving old lady quietly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I put out the fire, but I couldn\u2019t save the workshop.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.No, that\u2019s enough. I wouldn\u2019t have survived without you.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anyone you think is the culprit?\u201d\n\u201cThe culprit \u2026 well, he\u2019s \u2026 oh, no way!\u201d\nGrandma, who jumped up again, headed inside the burned workshop. She opened the soot-blackened door and entered the small room next to it.\nThere was no sign of fire, but the inside was a mess.\nThe shelf collapsed and items were spilling onto the floor. Grandma picked up one of the broken glass bottles and let out a sigh.\n\u201cOh my god\u2026.\u201d\nThe broken glass bottle was empty.\n\u201cGrandma, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThis is a bottle of dark ether that I kept.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe same was true of other glass bottles. I looked at the floor, but nothing was intact.\n\u201cNow there is no dark ether left. To get a new one \u2026 I don\u2019t know how long it will take \u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nIt was a heavy voice.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nOn the day of the first snow, a dungeon that killed Choi Yichan will occur.\nEven if I tried to save the dark ether from now on, there was a high possibility that I would not be able to make it in time.\nThen again, just like in the past\u2026.\nMy eyes darkened.\nAs I stepped on the floor with a sigh, I suddenly remembered the hand mirror I found in the space.\nCome to think of it, I haven\u2019t been able to return it yet. It\u2019s a pity it\u2019s broken, but wouldn\u2019t she feel a bit better if she received this?\nI rummaged through my inventory, pulled out a hand mirror, and held it out to Grandma.\n\u201cI found the mirror that Grandma described. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s broken, but please take this.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026broken?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I touched it and it cracked.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nGrandma took the hand mirror with a surprised expression. She then looked carefully at the broken marks.\n\u201cThis mirror is an artifact modeled after The Mirror of Nitocris. Unless its effectiveness is exhausted, it is something that cannot be broken by human power.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..Huh?\u201d\nIt just broke\u2026..? It cracked the moment I touched it, really lightly.\nMaybe I have a hidden power too? Am I the one who is secretly strong?\nI was drowning in vain thoughts.\n\u201cWait, since it\u2019s broken\u2026.!\u201d\nAt that moment, Grandma, who remembered something, turned the broken piece of the mirror upside down.\nSlurp.\nAn amorphous black lump came out from the back of the mirror.\nWhat on earth is this?\nThe lump was the size of a little fingernail, and the texture was like a sticky liquid or a gas. When she put it in the bottle, it gave off a strange blinking light.\nAs I stared with curious mind, Grandma said.\n\u201cThis is dark ether.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the dark ether.\nIt was my first time seeing it in person, so I couldn\u2019t realize it well.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be glad it was broken. It took a small amount of dark ether to process this mirror. It\u2019s a small amount, but if I reprocess this, I think I can make one item.\u201d\n\u201cYes? However \u2026 this is the mirror Grandma was looking for.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. After all, it\u2019s something that has been used. It would be more meaningful to help Miss Rieul.\u201d\nHaving said that, Grandma got up. She started looking for tools to craft items in the messy workshop. Unlike before, Grandma\u2019s face was full of vitality.\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d\nI told her to go back to the hospital, but she didn\u2019t listen at all. Reluctantly, I left Grandma, who engrossed in her work, and came out into the workshop\u2019s front yard.\nIt\u2019s been about an hour.\n\u201cTake this.\u201d\nGrandma came out of the door and handed me something.\nIt was a pendant made by reprocessing the broken hand mirror. At the end of the thin chain was a small water drop-shaped stone. A strange light seemed to twinkle within the black stone.\nImmediately, the status window of the item appeared.\n[Black Pendant (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)A common design, but used as a token of friendship.Type: AccessoriesNote: Dark etheric attributed.]\nThere was no special effect, but it was clearly written as \u2018dark\u2018.\n\u201c\u2026..Thank you!\u201d\nI finally found it.\nWith this\u2026..\n\u201cYou said you needed it to save a friend.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nGrandma said with a soft smile.\n\u201cI hope I can be of help.\u201d\nHer smile, as if reminiscent of someone who was not here, seemed somewhat affectionate.\n***\nThe day after I got the pendant.\n\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ah, how about putting it on like this?\u201d\n\u201cIs it horizontal? Umh, I think it\u2019s a little crooked \u2026 If I do this, this side is tilted. I will try again.\u201d\nChoi Yichan was looking at the store sign on the wall.\nIt was a weight that was difficult for me to lift with both hands, but Choi Yichan held it lightly with one hand. He looked around and positioned it carefully.\n\u201cIs this okay? \u2026 Uh, what\u2019s with your expression?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Oh, no. Nothing.\u201d\nChoi Yichan looked at me worriedly.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cNo \u2026 Yichan-ah, do you think about the sign? Does it look okay?\u201d\n\u201cEh? Yes! It\u2019s very cool and sophisticated.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.really?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about this, but \u2026. it\u2019s so pretty!\u201d\nThere is no lie on his beaming face. Choi Yichan\u2019s positive response was a bit tempting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a picture of a worm, right? It\u2019s unique.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wrong? Then \u2026 is it a snake?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cMieum, can\u2019t you change this sign?\u201d\nMieum answered my whisper in a conceited tone.\n\u201cKiyaooong (That\u2019s why you should have put my name on it)!\u201d\n\u201cMieum knows all the difficult words.\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong (Ahem)!\u201d\n\u201cHa\u2026..\u201d\nOn this sunny day, the reason I sighed when I saw a signboard that isn\u2019t clear whether it was an earthworm or a snake, goes back to yesterday.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThere will be no update until tomorrow (or the day after tomorrow), I need to start finishing my game event T__T\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c40": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nShe also had torn cuts and bruises on her head.\nMy heart was pounding. It\u2019s not just a fall or an accidental wound. Someone attacked Grandma. The moment I saw the wounds, I intuitively noticed it.\n\u2018Don\u2019t tell me, that guy before\u2026.\u2019\n\nDrip, drip, drip. The blood soaked the floor.\nFirst, I had to take Grandma to the hospital. I didn\u2019t have much time.\n\u201cGrandma, I\u2019m calling an ambulance now\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHurry \u2026 run away\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nGrandma licked her dry lips. I couldn\u2019t hear her well because her voice was so thin and she\u2019s trembling.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t speak more. The wound could open. Hold on to me!\u201d\nAfter raising Grandma up, I was about to go outside, but all of sudden, an acrid smell spread.\n\u201c\u2026.Uh?\u201d\nTap.\nA lit paper flew in from the outside.\nUnbeknownst to me, gasoline was sprinkled on the floor. The embers quickly grew, and the fire burned objects in the workshop, blocking the exit in an instant.\nSomeone set the fire.\nMy heart was pounding even harder. In an instant, The fire blazed high so quickly and smoke began to come inside.\nIf we didn\u2019t get out quickly, we could suffocate like this.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ugh!\u201d\nI tried to get close to put out the fire, but I had no choice but to retreat from the scorching heat.\nThis time, I took water from a bucket and poured it on the fire. It seemed to die down for a moment, but then it started to burn more intensely.\nWhat should I do?\nThere is no time to spare. I thought it would be better for me to take the water on my back and carry Grandma out.\n\u201cGrandma, wait a minute!\u201d\nI took the tap water from the bucket again and poured it over my head. Even the cold sensation is soon wiped out by the heat.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe fire grew stronger.\nIt was the moment when I felt my head dizzy from the heat and the acrid smell\u2026..\nThe texture of the air seemed to have descended heavily.\nI\u2019m definitely standing in the same place, but it feels like a completely different space from before.\nThen, a wide net of light spread over my head.\nI\u2019ve seen this kind of net somewhere. Where was it\u2026.\nRight, it was when I went to the tutorial dungeon with Ki Yoohyun.\nThe scene that followed was incredibly mysterious. It was unbelievable even though I witnessed it with naked eyes. Fine particles of light from the air formed a net and landed on the flames, and the fire disappeared in an instant.\nIt could only be described as completely gone.\nThe red flames, the acrid smoke, and the heat that heated my cheeks. After the net was lifted, they ceased to exist as if they had not been there from the beginning. Only the remaining soot reminded me of the existence of the fire.\n[Achievement: Avoiding the Second Death CrisisCongratulations.You safely escaped the danger of death.Let\u2019s value life.Reward: Random Skill Point 1]\nAlmost at the same time as the annoying system notification pops up.\n\u201cRieul-ssi!\u201d\nIt was Ki Yoohyun who ran into the blackened and collapsed entrance.\nHe slumped down after his black eyes found me, gave off a light of relief.\nI\u2019m alive now.\nThe moment I saw him, I was so happy that I felt like crying.\n\u201cWhat happened? Are you okay?\u201d\nThe fire was extinguished, but Grandma was still unconscious. I held back my tears and spoke.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, Grandma\u2026..\u201d\n***\nHe failed.\nHe failed again.\nJijon forced his trembling legs to move.\nHe could see a workshop engulfed in flames from a distance. His fear grew bigger, and now his whole body began to tremble like an aspen. It seemed as if the flames behind his back were chasing him.\nJijon, who ran to a place where the fire was hidden by the darkness, collapsed. He recited as he touched the ground with his weak hands.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me\u2026.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t do it.\nHe didn\u2019t kill the old lady.\nBut who will believe him? The old lady is already\u2026.\n\u201cRi-right! Report \u2026 report\u2026.\u201d\nJijon tried to take his phone out of his pocket. However, his fingertips trembled and did not move properly.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it\u2026.\u201d\nNo one hears the low murmur.\nIn return for letting him join C&L Corporation, CEO Lee Sein put forward one condition. It was to get a ring with a red stone from a certain Hunter.\nShe said it would be okay to spend any amount of money. Not only that, she even said that illegal means can be used if necessary.\nAt first, Jijon thought it was an easy job. The Hunter World is a world of the law of the jungle. Even if Jijon forcibly takes the ring away from the opponent, the weaker side is at fault.\nHowever, when he found out that the opponent was an old lady, he was greatly perplexed.\nShe was a small, skinny grandmother who would collapse at the stroke of his fist.\nHe was a supreme man who would do anything to succeed as a hunter, but he wasn\u2019t vicious enough to threaten an old lady with force.\n\u201cI know who sent you.\u201d\nThe old lady was not surprised to see Jijon holding a sword. Rather, she served hot barley tea and said in a calm voice.\n\u201cThe ring you\u2019re looking for has already been delivered to the right owner.\u201d\n\u201cUgh \u2026 the right owner is none of my business! Give me the ring!\u201d\n\u201cThat is impossible. Instead, I\u2019ll give you one of the items here, so can you step down?\u201d\n\u201cWho do you think came to get these junk items?\u201d\n\u201cAll of them are made by me, Kim Deokyi.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, hmm! Then show me \u2026 well, if it\u2019s a decent item, I can accept it!\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t scare the old lady, so he tried to step down after getting a suitable item.\nWhoosh!\nThen, suddenly, a mysterious man appeared from behind and swung a knife.\nAn unpleasant sound was heard. The knife stabbed the old lady\u2019s stomach in an instant, and the assailant ran away immediately. Jijon was startled, unable to breathe.\n\u201cGrandma, are you okay? Wa-wait, hold on a second. I \u2026 damn, you bastard!\u201d\nThinking that he had to catch the criminal, Jijon hurriedly ran out the door.\nThe assailant had already disappeared, but as a C-class Hunter, he should be able to catch up. Such a vicious bastard could not be forgiven.\nHowever, as he left the main gate of the workshop and chased after the mysterious assailant, the fire that flew from somewhere lit up.\n\u201cO-oh, no\u2026..\u201d\nThe fire spread quickly and blocked the entrance to the workshop.\nThe moment he saw that sight, he was filled with fear.\nThe assailant had already disappeared, and he was the only one left.\nAt this rate, he will be accused of being the culprit. It can\u2019t happen. This time he succeeded in trying to become a successful hunter. He cannot be framed for murder.\nJijon was driven by fear and fled from the workshop.\nStill, in the end, his conscience caught his feet. Every time he thought of the old lady\u2019s palce face, his steps became heavy, and he eventually collapsed on the ground.\nJijon gasped for his breath and murmured.\nHe\u2019s the supreme. In order to become the supreme leader of the Hunter World, he gave up his common real name and took this name.\nHowever, it is impossible to run away just because he\u2019s afraid of being framed.\nHe could barely hold the phone in his hand. Jijon struggled to suppress his shaking and entered the number on the screen. The sweat drips down like rain, and his fingers slide.\n\u201cUgh, 1, 1, 9\u2026.\u201d\nIt was just then.\nPukh!\n\u201cAaargh!\u201d\nA person on the other side of the alley stepped on Jijon\u2019s hand, who was holding the phone, with his foot. He was so strong, even with the power status of a C-class Hunter, Jijon couldn\u2019t shake his hand.\nKrak!\nThe phone screen shattered on the heel. His face, terrified and in pain, was reflected on the black screen. The bones of his right hand appear to have been broken. Jijon carefully raised his head, wrapping his right hand that had been trampled on the heel of his shoe.\nIn front of him, an unexpected figure was looking down at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026.\u201d\nIt was the secretary who guided him when he met Lee Sein, the CEO of C&L Corporation. A very beautiful secretary, but with an atmosphere of ambiguous age and gender.\nHis name is Aeon.\nWait, did he have a face like this? Was he this creepy?\nJijon met the secretary\u2019s eyes and was frightened. The eyes with a strange light seemed not to be human eyes. It was strange, as if it had been embedded with bluish imitation jewels.\nBefore he knew it, goosebumps appeared on the back of his neck.\nThen, the secretary smiled slightly and moved his lips. The tone was soft, but the cold, subdued voice felt intimidating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\u201cY-Yes\u2026.?\u201d\n\u201cThe CEO will be very disappointed, too. We can\u2019t believe you can\u2019t do such a simple thing right. How would the CEO, who believed in Hunter Jijon, feel about this failure?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2026 no way, you ki-killed the old la-lady.\u201d\nThe hardened tongue did not move straight.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even if Hunter Jijon didn\u2019t do his job properly, I handled it well. I\u2019m glad the weather is sunny. The news said that even a small fire can easily become a big fire because it is dry.\u201d\n\u201cBut the old lady \u2026. such an old lady, how can you?\u201d\n\u201cWe explained everything to you. The current No. 1 ranker will betray humanity, and we need that ring to stop him.\u201d\nThe secretary bent his knees and sat on the ground.\nJijon was startled and tried to step back, but it was quicker for the secretary to step on his hand.\n\u201cArgh! Argh!\u201d\nThe back of his hand, crushed by the heel of his shoe, hurt.\nIrrespective of Jijon\u2019s screams, the secretary slowly took out his phone and held it out.\nJijon didn\u2019t know what it meant, so he blinked blankly, and the secretary smiled. It was a creepy smile.\n\u201cIf Hunter Jijon feels remorse, it\u2019s okay to report it. Yes, because you can\u2019t do anything bad to an old lady.\u201d\n\u2026 Gulp.\n\u201cBut do you know this? The knife that stabbed the old woman at the crime scene would be found.\u201d\n\u201cThat, what\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cNot long ago, the CEO gifted a weapon to Hunter Jijon. Where\u2019s the knife that Hunter Jijon used to use now?\u201d\nJijon, who understood the secretary\u2019s words, turned pale.\nThe knife he originally used was disposed of by the Hunter Market, so he entrusted it to this secretary in front of him. His name was written on it.\nHe clearly saw a strange man who suddenly appeared attacking the old lady. But what if that person was ordered by C&L? What if he used his old weapon as the crime weapon?\nEven if he reports it, it means that he is the one who will be accused of being the culprit.\n\u201cUgh, if I say that I was ordered by C&L, it\u2019ll blow it up.\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any evidence?\u201d\n\u201cEvidence \u2026 there are plenty of them!\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t even sign a contract with us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, what\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nThe secretary continued as if reading a book.\n\u201cHunter Jijon is a person who has nothing to do with our company. However, it is regrettable that we, as a leader in the Hunter industry, did not realize that such a vicious hunter exists. We will do our best to be more careful in recruiting talent for the development of the Hunter industry in the future.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..If we do it, it will be over.\u201d\nThe secretary said abruptly, putting him on the last wedge.\n\u201cThe Hunter Jijon\u2019s family are all ordinary people.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be very worried. Rifts, monsters, and every other things. It\u2019s a dangerous world. We don\u2019t know where or what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Hik.\u201d\nTuk. Eventually, Jijon dropped his phone from his hand.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The CEO still believes in Hunter Jijon. You\u2019ll do well next time.\u201d\nColdly, the secretary laughed.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nOh it\u2019s finally reached 1k reading list on NU \ud83d\ude2e let\u2019s pray that this blog will be safe until we reached the last chapter \ud83d\ude00\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Kyaooooo!\u201d\n\u201cKyuuuu!\u201d\n\u201cHow many times already!\u201d\nNext to me, Mieum and Lime criticized me. But the more they did that, the clearer my memory became.\nLong eyelashes that created shadows in his face, gently curved lips, white cheeks, and a pair of lively clear eyes. Ki Yoohyun\u2019s face from up close was so destructive. I thought I got a little used to that face because I saw it often, but apparently I wasn\u2019t.\nHis fingers tickled against my hair\u2026.\nThe time it took to put the hairpin on must have been brief, but it felt like a long time. In the meantime, I couldn\u2019t move my body because I was nervous.\nAs soon as the finger fell off, a faint smile crossed his lips.\nAnd a voice that gently touched my ear,\n\u201cLucky.\u201d\n\u201cAaaargh!\u201d\n\u201cWaeooong! This human, are you going to surprise me again and again?\u201d\nAs I screamed again, Mieum threw her front paw and punched me.\nBut \u2026 the more I tried to forget, the more the strange word kept floating around in my mind. It seems that the stimulation was too great for me, who did not have the good-looking-immunity. Anyone who hears that kind of voice right in front of their eyes won\u2019t be able to snap out of it.\nBesides, what\u2019s lucky? Don\u2019t omit the subject and object!\nNo, let\u2019s calm down. Perhaps it was a meaningless word. After all, he\u2019s a bit of a weird person.\nI struggled to get rid of my thoughts and concentrated on finding the requested item.\nThe warehouse was very spacious and complex. I cleaned it once last time, but it was impossible to completely organize all these things. It was filled with items from the store that are no longer in use, various miscellaneous items, and my grandmother\u2019s belongings. This was also the place where I found many things I needed, such as the coffee mix and vinyl sheets.\nNewspapers and magazines from 10 years ago were also piled up in boxes.\nHmm, there\u2019s news of a famous hunter\u2019s wedding. I used to play this cafe tycoon game \u2026 it came out at this time.\nHekh, I almost inadvertently read the magazine. For some reason, If I find a book while cleaning, I always ended up reading it. I put down the magazine and focused on searching again, but I couldn\u2019t even see any hand mirror.\n\u201cCough, cough.\u201d\nFurthermore, there was a lot of dust, so I kept coughing.\n\u201cKyaoooo! How long do I have to do this!\u201d\n\u201cKyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!\u201d\nMieum and Lime, who were searching the inside together, protested.\n\u201cUntil you find it.\u201d\n\u201cThis is ridiculous! Waeoong!\u201d\n\u201cKyuu!\u201d\nI ignored their protest and pointed to a box in the corner.\n\u201cThere. Take a look inside that box.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no mirror. Meong\u2026..\u201d\nThen, Mieum tried to sneak out of the warehouse.\n\u201cWhere are you going!\u201d\n\u201cKiyaooo?!\u201d\nI grabbed Mieum\u2019s tail. I couldn\u2019t see Lime because it had already escaped. Lime, even you\u2026.\nI continued to search the warehouse with Mieum, who kept trying to escape, but I couldn\u2019t find a hand mirror.\nMeium, who had turned into a ball of gray fur because of the dust, grumbled.\n\u201cThose who want to get back things that are years old have no conscience. Just say that the statute of limitations has expired!\u201d\n\u201cUmh, but\u2026.\u201d\nKim Deokyi said that she would give up if I couldn\u2019t find my grandmother\u2019s hand mirror, but I was concerned about Grandma\u2019s expression.\nShe had a very sad and lonely expression, like she\u2019s longing for something.\nIt seems to be a very important item, so I really wanted to find and return it.\nBut\u2026.\n\u201cHuk, huu \u2026 cough, cough!\u201d\nNo matter how hard I try to find\u2026.\n\u201cThat slime runs away alone \u2026 waeoong!\u201d\nThe result was zero. I only saw a mountain of junk.\nI wonder if it\u2019s not here. When I was exhausted and about to sink to the floor, Lime, who had run away alone, returned and bounced in front of me.\n\u201cKyuuu!\u201d\n\u201cOh, what?\u201d\n\u201cKyu, kyuuu!\u201d\n\u201cWow, did you find the hand mirror?\u201d\n\u201cKyuuu\u2026..\u201d\nI have no idea what you mean.\nLime headed out of the warehouse, bouncing up and down as if urging me follow it. There\u2019s no clue left anyway. I quickly followed after Lime.\n\u201cOh, is it here?\u201d\n\u201cKyu!\u201d\nThe place where Lime took me was the entrance to the space.\nHey, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s here. My grandmother was not an Awakened. Has my grandmother ever been in here?\nHowever, there was no hand mirror in the warehouse or in the other room. The only place left is this space. I thought I should check it out rather than leave a feeling of frustration.\nI entered the space. The blue sky, the dazzling sunlight, and the large Yggdrasil tree greeted me. There was a well-grown dungeon sugarcanes on one side and a field of dried coffee fruits on the other.\nI looked around, but I couldn\u2019t see anything like a hand mirror. As expected, it\u2019s not her either.\nAs I was about to hide my discouragement and go out, Lime called me again.\n\u201cKkyu, kkyuu, kkyuuu!\u201d\n\u201cUh, why? What?\u201d\nLime bounced its body, pointing to one corner of this space. The place Lime pointed to was the slope where I rolled last time.\nAt that time, as I fell off that slope, I got the skill \u2018A Bond of a Cup of Coffee\u2018.\n\u201cAre you talking about that place?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nIt was unlikely that the hand mirror was hidden in the empty ground beneath the slope. Still, as Lime was bouncing its body with a lot of effort, I decided to check the bottom.\nI took my steps carefully and went down the slope. Immediately, the animals followed me.\n\u201cSlow, human! You\u2019re the reason why I\u2019m walking this slowly!\u201d\n\u201cWoah, Mieum is good at coming down slopes. She\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\u201cAhem!\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019d be good at climbing up the slope, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, meow!\u201d\nThud.\nMieum, who ran up the slope again to the end, came to her senses.\n\u201cKiyaoo! Are you teasing me!\u201d\nAh, I got caught.\nThe bottom of the cliff was empty land, just like the last time when I fell. The ground was covered with grass, and random piles of stones piled up in front of us.\n\u201c\u2026..Huh?\u201d\nThen I noticed something and was startled.\nI didn\u2019t notice it before, but there was a small path in the crevice of the pile of stones. It was a difficult location to find unless you look closely because it was blocked by a stone.\nWhat\u2019s there?\nI quickly approached the crevice in the pile of stones.\nInside, there was a bigger space than I expected. There was also a small cabin in a place covered with bushes and not easily visible.\nA cabin in a place like this?\nIs it a reward from the system? However, even after waiting for a while, the system remained silent.\nFortunately, the door was not locked.\nI noticed as soon as I opened the door of the cabin.\nThis is where my grandmother used to be.\nCompared to the old exterior, the inside of the cabin had a cozy atmosphere. There were thick carpets on the floor, curtains on the windows, and even a small table in front of it.\nIt was all my grandmother\u2019s taste. It was clear that my grandmother had decorated this place.\nStill, how did a cabin like this exist in this space? Could it be that my grandmother was an Awakened?\nBut there was no more time to think about it.\n\u201cHuman, look at this!\u201d\n\u201cHuh? \u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\nBecause on the table in the cabin, there was a small hand mirror. From the round shape to the flower-shaped decoration, it looked exactly the same as the mirror that was described by Kim Deokyi.\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d\nI quickly picked up the hand mirror and tried to lift it up. Now\u2026.\nCrack.\nThe moment I touched it, the hand mirror cracked.\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d\nI hurriedly let go, but it was already too late. The hand mirror was completely shattered then.\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nIt seemed like a very precious thing, but it broke\u2026.\nLime and Mieum approached me, who was in despair.\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\nSomehow the cat comforted me.\n\u201cLooks like this item is modeled after\u00a0The Mirror of Nitocris. It is a tool that reflects the existence of the other world.\u201d\nWhat, and it wasn\u2019t an ordinary hand mirror?\n\u201cIt was broken because it\u2019s out of effect. Even if you left it as is, it would have broken anyway, meoong!\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror, can\u2019t you just put it back together!\u201d\nYes, even if it\u2019s broken, it\u2019d be better to return it. If you put the pieces together well, you might be able to put them back together.\nI gathered up the mirror pieces and came out of the space. I was going to return this hand mirror to Grandma right away.\nI hope she is happy.\n***\nIt took quite a while to search through the warehouse. When I found the hand mirror, it was almost evening.\nSince it was late, I thought about going to the workshop tomorrow for a while, but I changed my mind. It would be better to deliver it as soon as possible.\n\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go. Take care of the house.\u201d\nAfter giving Mieum and Lime plenty of dinner, I headed to Grandma Kim Deokyi\u2019s workshop.\nWhen I came with Ki Yoohyun, it was easy to find, but the road was complicated to find alone.\nI wanted to ask Ki Yoohyun to accompany me, but I gave up on the idea. I\u2019m the only one who has business with Grandma, so I felt bad to ask him to come with me every time.\n\u201cLucky.\u201d\n\u201cAaargh!\u201d\nI stopped to scream a little. It was fortunate that no one was around.\nHis burdensome handsome face and strange atmosphere have not yet left my mind. It seems that it still takes more time for the good-looking-immunity to develop.\nInstead, since I found the hand mirror for Grandma, I just left a KakaoTalk message informing him of my visit.\n\u201cUm, this is probably the right way\u2026.\u201d\nThe \u2018Cheonggye 3-ga Workshop Street\u2019, covered with a red sunset, had a more gloomy atmosphere than during the day.\nEven the noise of work hours does not come into this alley. The faded signboards and tightly closed shutters looked like the beginning of a horror movie.\nUgh, I\u2019m not good at horror movies.\u2026.\nAt this rate, an unwanted development would suddenly appear.\n\u201cAh, there it is.\u201d\nAfter wandering for a while, I finally found the signboard of Grandma\u2019s workshop.\nHowever, the atmosphere was a little different from when I came before. The arrangement of the junk placed in front of the entrance has been changed. It looked like someone had ripped it apart.\nIn addition, the floor was damp.\nDid it rain? But the weather was sunny today.\nThere was a strange smell came from somewhere.\n\u2018Can I go in?\u2019\nAs soon as I pushed the door open, someone jumped out from inside.\n\u2018Are you a guest?\u2019\nBugh!\nHe looked at me and paused for a moment, then shoved me hard on the shoulder.\n\u201cOuch \u2026 Excuse me!\u201d\nI called him angrily, but he had already run away.\nThere are really all sorts of weird people. I sighed inwardly and entered the workshop. \nThen, a sound came from inside.\nI quickly turned towards the sound.\n\u201cGrandma, I\u2019m here. Are you there?\nI shouted loudly, but there was no answer.\nThe lights were brightly lit in the workshop.\nAs if Grandma had just been here, there was a teacup left over from drinking on the table. It\u2019s still warm when I touch it. However, Grandma was still nowhere to be seen.\n\u2018Where are you?\u2019\nAs I headed towards the back room, I heard a low groan.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nThere was an old lady lying on the floor.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Grandma!\u201d\nI ran quickly and got Grandma up.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nIt must be difficult for her to speak. As I hurriedly examined her condition, something damp touched my hand.\n\u2026.. Blood.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThis is why you shouldn\u2019t go to any place alone at night.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c38": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nI was surprised that my grandmother\u2019s name, who died a few years ago, suddenly popped up.\nIs it the same person? Park Heesun isn\u2019t such a unique name.\nHowever, Grandma smiled slightly and confirmed my presumption.\n\u201cShe showed me a picture of her granddaughter only once. You\u2019ve grown up.\u201d\n\nGrandma lightly tapped my shoulder with a delighted look. She then took a picture out of her arms and showed it to me.\nKim Deokyi, who looked a little younger, and my grandmother were in it. The two seemed to be very close.\n\u201cDid you know each other?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been helped by her before.\u201d\nThere was a deep longing in her voice. Her gaze remained on me, but Grandma seemed to be looking at a very far place.\n\u201cShe had already passed away when I asked about her news in order to repay her.\u201d\n\u201cYes, a few years ago, she was sick\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThere must be a hand mirror among Park Heesun\u2019s belongings. It\u2019s something I lent her before. I want to get it back, so I hope you can find it.\u201d\nGrandma briefly explained the shape of the hand mirror.\nHowever, I didn\u2019t find such a hand mirror while cleaning up the junk left in the store. I didn\u2019t throw away my grandmother\u2019s stuff. No one else could have touched it.\nBut it was hard to refuse just because I had never seen such a thing.\nIt wasn\u2019t just because the dark etheric item was absolutely necessary. It was because I felt a deep longing from Grandma.\nFor me, longing is always a strong emotion.\nIt seeps out of the cracks in memory and violently scrapes a person\u2019s heart. There comes a moment when that vague yet enormous emotion is exceptionally unbearable. At such a time, I know how powerful memories are.\nI answered carefully.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a hand mirror left. I\u2019ve never seen my grandmother\u2019s things when she was organizing them, but \u2026 I\u2019ll look for it in the warehouse.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Thank you.\u201d\nGrandma smiled softly.\nIt was a face full of loneliness.\n***\nKwon Rieul was looking around to see if the items in the workshop were interesting. Ki Yoohyun stood from a distance and looked at her figure.\nThere\u2019s a big change in her facial expression. After hearing Kim Deokyi\u2019s explanation, she nodded her head enthusiastically and looked at the next item. Kim Deokyi also continued to explain as if she found her reaction interesting.\nIt\u2019s not that the suspicious part has completely disappeared. However, she did not appear to have a direct relationship with the Church of Starry Wisdom.\nThat\u2019s a relief.\n\u2018Because I don\u2019t have to kill her.\u2019\nThat thought was sincere.\nAt that moment, Kim Deokyi, who came closer, tapped Ki Yoohyun on the shoulder and talked to him.\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much power in your shoulders.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cIt must be so powerful. Why don\u2019t you relax a little bit?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun opened his mouth to Kim Deokyi in a cold voice. His tone was polite, but there\u2019s sharp edges on his words.\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking too much. I know you can\u2019t afford to pass that unique item in vain.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you give her Cthugha\u2019s Ring? Who the hell is that person?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to know either.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nInstead of answering, Ki Yoohyun looked at Kim Deokyi with a frozen expression. It was an expression that there was no time for puns, but the craftsman in hiding was still relaxed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make that face. I just heard a voice one day.\u201d\n\u201cA voice \u2026 you say.\u201d\n\u201cIt said that my role is to complete the Cthugha\u2019s Ring and hand it over to the right owner. I followed that voice. I don\u2019t know anything else.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that she is the right owner to own the Cthugha\u2019s Ring.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun frowned. At the end of the field of his vision, he could see Kwon Rieul, who was still happily sightseeing the workshop.\n\u201cThen who is that person? What power does she have\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear a voice too?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nKi Yoohyun distorted his face. He knew what Kim Deokyi was talking about.\nThe atmosphere changed greatly depending on the man\u2019s well-formed facial expression. When he removes the polite smile that he has barely maintained so far, what remains is the cold-hearted figure of the absolutist. The black eyes were as hot as a fire.\nIf Kwon Rieul had seen him right now, she would have been more suspicious of his identity, but she kept her eyes away from Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve treated the craftsman master with enough courtesy.\u201d\nIt was a warning that if she said the same thing one more time, he wouldn\u2019t put up with it. Even so, Kim Deokyi was standing still.\nKi Yoohyun awakened as a Hunter at the age of 13.\nHowever, unlike any other Hunter\u2019s awakening, it was neither a coincidence nor a miracle, and there was no celebration or cheer.\nHis awakening was artificially prepared.\nThe Awakening Center.\nIt is known to the public as the predecessor of the Dungeon Management Office, which disappeared due to corruption, but the reality is even more terrifying.\nFirst, those who named themselves the \u2018Church of Starry Wisdom\u2018 occupied the upper floors of the Awakening Center. It was a pseudo-religious group that raved about searching for the truth of the universe.\nUnder the direction of the denomination, the \u2018Center\u2019 gathered young children to artificially create Awakeners.\nKi Yoohyun was one of those children. Without even knowing the purpose of the \u2018Center\u2018, he thought that they were good people who took care of him who lost his family.\nAnd that day, the \u2018Center\u2018 opened the \u2018Gate\u2019. It was a gate that could summon demons from another world.\nAll the children who met the demon beyond the gate went crazy and eventually died.\nA lot of time has passed, but Ki Yoohyun still remembers that day vividly.\nThe screams, cries, bloods, pains, \u2026. and the voice.\n[Completing The Demon Summon. Implements a demon at the specified coordinates.][\u2026\u2026Failure. Intervention in reality is limited by Causality.][Great Demon: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 looks at you from beyond The Ultimate Gate.]\n\u3010I\u2019ve been waiting for you, child.  \u2588\u2588.\u3011\nA terrifying murmur that he heard directly in his head. He couldn\u2019t reject the voice even if he covered his ears.\nThe one beyond the door was smiling.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to explain it.\nAn overwhelming fear that transcends human cognitive abilities. The emptiness that just exists. An amorphous chaos that drives humans crazy just by looking at them.\nAt the same time as the creepy sensation, a translucent window appeared in front of him.\n[Great Old One: \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 wants a contract with you.]\n[We\u2019ve confirmed that you\u2019re eligible.][The Eligible: The ability is granted according to Ki Yoohyun\u2019s will.]\n[Class: Awakened as a Righteous Ruler (S).][Skill: The Power of White Light (S) has been acquired.]\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n[Causality has reached its limit. Any further intervention beyond this may cause a reality collapse.][Connection is forcibly terminated \u2026 30 seconds until the connection ends]\n\u3010I am asleep at the edge of the Abyss. Find me.\u3011\n[Connection has been terminated.]\nWhen he woke up, there was a sea of \u200b\u200bblood all around him. All the children who were with him died, and the only survivor was Ki Yoohyun.\nAnd he awakened as the first and best S-class Hunter in Korea.\n\u201cOh, we finally succeeded! It\u2019s an S-class!\u201d\n\u201cO \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Great Demon, you finally gave us an answer!\u201d\nThe Awakening Center cheered that the experiment was finally successful. Like the crazies, they didn\u2019t seem to care about the deaths of other children.\nIt was disgusting.\nKi Yoohyun, who was awakened, immediately decided to destroy the Awakening Center. At that time, the only person with him was Hunter Han Yiseong.\n15 years old, the end of a long fight. He succeeded in destroying the Awakening Center and driving out the Church of Starry Wisdom.\nHowever, the denomination did not give up and moved into the shadows, and they eventually resurrected the Demon.\nWhile climbing the dungeon to prevent the Demon\u2019s resurrection, Ki Yoohyun thought about this.\nHe wants to ask the Demon who sits beyond the Ultimate Gate.Why did that happen? Why only he survived?\u2026. why did the \u2018voice\u2019 call him that day?\nBut regardless of his will, time rewinded to the past.\nTime that repeats again. This time, he is trying to save the world from the Demon.\nThe question of that day remains unanswered.\nSome people say that the voice they hear when they awakened is the voice of God, and some gave it aa wonderful name like \u2018The voice of The Star\u2018. Some even called it \u2018The Holy See\u2019.\nIt is known as a cosmic deity who speaks to very few Awakeneds and grants them special powers.\nHowever, its essence is not only good for humans.\nFrom that day on, Ki Yoohyun felt that a part of him had worn away. No matter how much he tried to recall, he can\u2019t remember what he was like before his awakening. If he let his guard down even a little bit, he felt like the \u2018voice\u2018 in him would devour the rest of him.\nBut Kim Deokyi mentioned a voice.\nKi Yoohyun frowned with displeasure.\n\u201cI heard a voice, too.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nHe was startled.\nDid Kim Deokyi also sign a contract with the Divine God of the universe?\n\u201cIt told me what to do and what my role was.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for that day since the moment I\u2019ve awakened, and it\u2019s only finally come true.\u201d\nKim Deokyi\u2019s face looked very comfortable while saying that. Ki Yoohyun slowly opened his lips.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in fate.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cNo matter who you hand over your unique item to \u2026 If I determine that she is interfering with my goal, I will remove her.\u201d\n\u201cHohoho\u2026.\u201d\nThe retired craftsman, who put everything down, burst into laughter.\n\u201cAs expected, there\u2019s too much power in your shoulders. If you relax a little, you will see something.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what the craftsman said.\nThe enemy is still breathing in the shadows.\nWith a bitter smile, Kim Deokyi left.\n\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\nAt some point, Kwon Rieul approached him. Ki Yoohyun looked back with a soft smile as if he had set his blade aside.\n\u201cGrandma said I could take this. It\u2019s pretty, right?\u201d\nShe had a small flower-shaped hairpin in her hand. A white stone embedded in the center of the flower stood out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHe tried to say that it\u2019s a four-star rare item that reduces mental damage, but he stopped himself. It seems that she knows it as an ordinary hairpin, so it would be more comfortable not to know the truth.\nShe\u2019s an ordinary person.\nAt least, on the surface.\nAlthough she had awakened, let alone the denomination, she was an ordinary person who didn\u2019t know much about hunters or dungeons.\nNevertheless, Ki Yoohyun felt a strange feeling every time he met her. Especially when he drank her coffee.\nNot only her coffee\u2019s ability to recover, but also a warm feeling that is difficult to define in a word seemed to fill him up.\nWhy does he feel this way \u2026 he still doesn\u2019t know the answer right now.\n\u201cGive it to me.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun picked up the hairpin from Kwon Rieul\u2019s hand. Then, he ran through her chestnut brown hair with his fingers, and pinned the hairpin.\nKwon Rieul stood still, motionless, until he let go of his hand. Looking at her wavy chestnut brown hair and red cheeks, Ki Yoohyun muttered lowly. Before he knew it, a faint smile appeared on his lips.\n\u201cLucky.\u201d\nBecause I don\u2019t have to doubt you yet.\nKi Yoohyun thought so from the bottom of his heart.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nDear MC, are you sure your coffee doesn\u2019t contain love potion because what\u2019s with this sudden romantic behavior \u2026\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Or living a leisurely life in the countryside, teaching children or farming, and turn your back on the glamorous past? Or it\u2019s a free-spirited life that is likely to be cast in \u2018I\u2019m a Natural Person\u2018?\nMaybe it\u2019s a life where you live in a well-managed Hanok and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\u201cThen where should we go?\u201d\n\nWhat if I have to go too far? Mieum and Lime need me to feed them. Should I book a train ticket? It\u2019s better to take KTX even if it\u2019s a little expensive, right?\nStill, it wasn\u2019t all.\nThe place where Ki Yoohyun called me was completely unexpected.\n\u201cAh, Rieul-ssi, you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m fighting my own prejudice.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\n***\nThe next day, the place where Ki Yu-hyeon called me was in front of Cheonggyecheon, Cheonggye 3-ga.\nWhen I went there at the appointed time, Ki Yoohyun was already waiting.\nThe black coat covering the long stretched body looked good on him. The large eyes beyond the thick-rimmed glasses found me and he smiled.\nWhenever his slightly long black hair swayed gently in the wind, people passing by glanced at him.\nAs expected, he has a very striking appearance.\n\u2018Why are you wearing those glasses?\u2019\nI don\u2019t think his eyesight is bad. In the first place, Hunter\u2019s physical ability improves upon awakening, so there is no one with poor eyesight.\nIs he using it to cover his face?\nEh, that\u2019s not possible.\nIt\u2019s not a worldview where people can\u2019t recognize your face by putting dots under your eyes or wearing glasses, and the glasses did not even cover his bright face in the slightest.\nBehind Ki Yoohyun, there was a beverage advertisement shot by the 17th ranker, Hunter Oh Seoho, who is famous for his handsome looks, but honestly, he stood out more than the billboard.\nIs he just wearing the glasses because he likes them?\nHmm, yes, let\u2019s respect his taste.\n\u201cIs she here?\u201d\nI glanced around and parted my lips.\nCheonggyecheon Stream \u2026 is too urban for a reclusive master.\nThis street is also close to the store. I only need to take the subway, get off at Euljiro 3-ga Station, and walk a little to arrive.\nThe surrounding area was crowded with shops that were just opening, trucks carrying goods, and office workers who were busy walking.\n\u201cPlease step aside for a moment.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\nThe man who was unloading a large box from the truck called me. I hurriedly moved sideways to avoid it.\nIt\u2019s complex. The shopping district\u2019s unique hustle and bustle was filling the surroundings. It was very different from the image of hiding that I had vaguely imagined. I thought it would be a nicer place with better air and good water\u2026.\nKi Yoohyun talked to me, who was reflecting on my own prejudice for a while.\n\u201cCome here, please.\u201d\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s go!\u201d\nKi Yoohyun made his way through the complex Cheonggyecheon shopping district. He walks fast, perhaps because of his long legs.\nI hurried after him and he waited for me in front of the entrance of a narrow alley. A sign that read \u2018Cheonggye 3-ga Workshop Street\u2018 was seen right next to it.\nIn the Cheonggyecheon area, there were originally small workshops of hunters of the item-making industry. There were also street vendors that handled rare items, so it was quite crowded until a few years ago. There was even a saying, \u2018If it\u2019s not in the Hunter Market, go to Cheonggyecheon\u2019.\nBy the way\u2026.\n\u201cAre many places closed?\u201d\nUnlike the lively surroundings, \u2018Cheonggye 3-ga Workshop Street\u2019 had a lonely atmosphere. Although it was a weekday morning, there were more closed places than open places, and there was hardly any sign of human\u2019s activities.\n\u201cAs the hunters in the crafting industry gradually moved to large workshops, they declined a lot. It must have been a difficult environment for small workshops to survive.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026.\u201d\nAs I went into that old-fashioned alley for a long time, I saw a certain commercial building.\nIt was difficult to find the entrance because miscellaneous etheric ore and crafted items were laid out in front of it.\n\u201cHere it is.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun opened the door that had been hidden in all sorts of things. There was a squeaking noise, noting how long no one had come and gone.\n\u2018Is it okay to come in?\u2019\nI went to get an item and fell into a different world, this scenario is not going to happen, right?\n\u201c\u2026.Gulp.\u201d\nI carefully shoved myself into the door.\nCompared to the narrow entrance, the inside was unexpectedly wide. There was even a courtyard attached to the renovated old Hanok building. If it wasn\u2019t for this courtyard, it would have been a pretty quiet atmosphere.\nAfter a long walk in the long courtyard, we faced a door again. The signboard covered in dust had the words \u2018Kim Deokyi\u2019s Workshop\u2019 written on it.\nScreech. I opened the creaking glass door and went inside. Soon, a harsh voice was heard from inside the dusty grass.\n\u201cI must have locked the door, how did you get in?\u201d\n\u201cIt was open\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI already said that I don\u2019t sell items anymore. Hurry up and go home.\u201d\nIt was a small, skinny old lady who came out from the inside.\n\u201c\u2026.It\u2019s you.\u201d\nHer face was wrinkled, but her posture was straight and her voice was clear.\nThe old lady, who was not easily approachable, frowned when she looked at Ki Yoohyun and tried to kick him out as if she had nothing more to say.\nI immediately remembered where I had seen this old lady. She\u2019s the old lady from the consignment shop in the Hunter Market at that time! Someone who sold me a set of miscellaneous items and a ring for 50 rubies.\n\u201cOh, Grandma! Hello!\nI bowed my head in delight.\nThe Grandma, who was about to kick us out the door right away, was happy to see me.\n\u201cYou are \u2026 we met at the Hunter Market back then.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Ah, please call me Kwon Rieul.\u201d\n\u201cI am Kim Deokyi. Come on in. I know you have come to see me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026. Didn\u2019t you tell me not to cross the threshold here?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun smiled bitterly.\n\u201cEven if I say that, you still come as you please.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun and Grandma knew each other, the world is small.\nWait, so this old lady is the reclusive master?\nCome to think of it, thanks to the ring the Grandma gave me, I was able to roast coffee beans without going into the dungeon. No wonder it was good, it was an item made by a reclusive master. My respect flared up.\nI immediately held out the ring with a red stone and said, \u201cGrandma, I really enjoy using this ring you gave me before. Thank you!\u201d\n\u201cReally? What did it work for?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Didn\u2019t Grandma make it?\u201d\n\u201cI made it, but it was luck that I completed it. All I did was pass it on to the right person.\u201d\nI think you\u2019re being overly humble. What do you mean it was luck? A genius needs 99% skill and 1% luck.\nAnyway, I answered Grandma\u2019s question.\n\u201cThis ring, it produces fire! I\u2019m using it well for roasting coffee.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nSilence.\nThe calm conversation was cut off and a cold silence filled the place.\nThe old lady looked at me with a mysterious expression that was hard to describe. She seemed astonished, and she also seemed to be devastated.\nNext to me, Ki Yoohyun was holding back his laughter. I poked his ribs as a sign of asking why he was laughing, but there was no sign of him stopping laughing.\nDon\u2019t tell me \u2026 is it not supposed to be used to light fire?\nHowever, Grandma soon said with a soft smile.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re using it well.\u201d\nHuh, that means it\u2019s okay, right?\nGrandma took us to the room inside the workshop. There were mountains of items piled up inside the workshop, and they all looked amazing. I asked, pointing to one of the strange-looking bottles.\n\u201cWoah, there\u2019s a lot of interesting things here. What is this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a potion that temporarily erases your presence.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about this?\u201d\n\u201cA neutralizer used to control the effectiveness of an item.\u201d\n\u201cThat stick over there\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an item with only the last deadline left.\u201d\n\u201cThis brush \u2026 woah, grandma. How did you draw on such a small place?\u201d\n\u201cEhem, that\u2019s about\u2026.\u201d\nWhile looking at the items inside, I chatted with Grandma for a while.\nThere were many strange items in the workshop. As I reacted enthusiastically, I could see the corners of Grandma\u2019s mouth slowly loosened. As expected, there is no one who dislikes compliments.\nThe inside of the workshop, which looked like a mess at first glance, was well organized by its own laws. All of the neutralizers and etheric potions were labeled, and the item crafting tools were shiny as if they had just been cleaned.\nWithout attachment, someone wouldn\u2019t have managed it this carefully.\nIt seems that she still like crafting items, so why is she hiding?\nAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation, I asked cautiously.\n\u201cAre you not making items anymore?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cMay I ask why?\u201d\n\u201cNot for any particular reason. I just did my mission.\u201d\n\u201cMission\u2026..\u201d\nGrandma didn\u2019t say much more, she only smiled and changed the subject.\n\u201cSo, why are you here today?\u201d\nE-eh. I almost forgot my point.\nAs I looked around, I realized that a lot of time had passed.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually here to ask you a favor. I\u2019m looking for a dark etheric item. I was wondering if you knew how to get it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\nThe surprised old lady soon said with a stiff expression.\n\u201cWhy are you looking for it? Dark ethers can seriously harm people depending on how they are refined. If that\u2019s the case, I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not like that!\u201d\nI hurriedly waved my hand. Ki Yoohyun and everyone else\u2019s reaction was bad, so I guess it\u2019s a really dangerous thing.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me the reason?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that \u2026 I\u2019m just not sure if you\u2019ll believe me.\u201d\n\u201cLet me listen and judge it for myself.\u201d\n\u201cI need it to save my friend. For my friend \u2026 I need it.\u201d\nIn order to avoid the interference of causality, there is not much that can be said, such as the story that a dark-attribute dungeon will appear soon or that Choi Yichan is going to die there.\nI just said that it was a necessary item to acquire the skill to protect my friend\u2019s body.\nIt must have been an insufficient explanation, but Grandma did not ask any further questions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small amount, but I still have an unrefined dark ether. It will be enough to make one small accessory.\u201d\nAt last.\nIt was as if a halo was shining behind Grandma.\n\u201cThank you! Thank you so much!\u201d\n\u201cBut instead of just giving it you, there is something I want Miss Rieul to do for me.\u201d\n\u201cYes? What is it? Please feel free to ask me anything!\u201d\n\u201cI am looking for something left by someone. Her name is \u2026 Park Heesun.\u201d\nPark Heesun?\nUh, this name is\u2026.\n\u201cIs it my grandmother\u2026..?\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nJust in case you don\u2019t know what Hanok looks like, it\u2019s a traditional Korean house.\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c36": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nNo matter what I feed him, the reaction is exactly the same, is he a machine?\nThe truth is the man in front of me isn\u2019t the Hunter Ki Yoohyun, but a humanoid robot, isn\u2019t it? If he wasn\u2019t a robot, how could he gave the same satisfaction every time?\n\u201c\u2026.What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2026..\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help it. Let\u2019s step down today and try again next time. The reason that the same result came out no matter what drink is given may be due to a different cause.\nAbove all, I wanted to taste the cafe mocha that smells sweet.\nI put my disappointment aside and took my share of cafe mocha. The chocolate sauce, which is said to be made with the fruit of hell, was thick and delicious.\nThen, suddenly, I thought about the dark etheric item.\nKi Yoohyun is also a hunter, so maybe he knows something.\nThe item is still unobtainable. I spoke to Ki Yoohyun, who was drinking cafe mocha, with the feeling of grasping at straws.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, umh, there is something I want to ask you.\u201d\n\u201cYes? Please tell me.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know about dark etheric items? I\u2019m looking for a place to get it.\u201d\nHeck. Ki Yoohyun was surprised.\nClick. He put down the cafe mocha that he hasn\u2019t finished drinking yet.\nWhen he raised his head, he had a cold expression on his face, as if he had become a different person in an instant. It reminded me of his appearance when he detonated the concrete bricks earlier.\nKi Yoohyun spoke with a ferociousness that seemed to be able to break my head, no, the cafe mocha cup.\n\u201cWhy are you looking for it?\u201d\n\u201cI \u2026 I need it for something.\u201d\nI\u2019d like to explain why I need it and ask for help, but I couldn\u2019t do that because my mouth was blocked by the system. I couldn\u2019t talk about things that happened before the regression, just like the dungeon in Suwon.\n\u201cCome to think of it, I haven\u2019t asked about your Hunter Class, Rieul-ssi.\u201d\nThe sharp eyes stared at me. A little bit pressured by the sudden change of atmosphere, I answered the truth.\n\u201cYes? I\u2019m a Cafe Owner.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not that.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a Cafe Owner?\u201d\n\u201cHa \u2026. I didn\u2019t ask about your job, Rieul-ssi.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said I\u2019m a Cafe Owner.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Fine. You don\u2019t seem to want to answer.\u201d\nIt was extremely unfair. I only told the 100% pure truth!\nI looked at Ki Yoohyun with an angry heart.\nI was determined not to tell anyone about my skills as much as possible. This is because the \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2018, a skill that can give special effects to coffee, was a better skill than I thought.\nName: Kwon RieulClass: Cafe Owner (F)\u00a0(Lv. 5)Stamina 100/100, Energy 100/100Strength: 20 (+10), Intelligence: 13, Agility: 11, Luck: 12\u203b Strength increases by 10 with the effect of the achievement \u2018Guardian of the World Tree\u2019.\nI have reached level 5, but my status as an F-class is still at rock bottom.\nIt is said that the sum of strength, intelligence, agility, and luck must be at least 400 to enter the dungeon. The cutline for a slightly usable Hunter is 500.\nBut if I add it all up\u2026.\n\u2018Hm\u2026..\u2019\nIt\u2019s saddening, so let\u2019s not count.\nA hunter with the ability to make buffs and recovery coffee even though she\u2019s an F-class \u2026 it\u2019s a perfect combination to be exploited.\nIn reality, when I watched the news, there have been several cases of the exploitation of hunters in the production world by binding them to messy contracts. It was not difficult to imagine signing the wrong contract and becoming a coffee-making slave. Such a thing is absolutely dreadful.\nHowever, Ki Yoohyun did not appear to be a person to chat around. I want to ask for help if he knows about dark etheric items.\nNo, this is just an excuse. It was unfair to be suspected even though I revealed my Hunter Class. What\u2019s wrong with a Cafe Owner!\n\u201cSo, my Hunter Class is a Cafe Owner!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..What?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun asked with a blank expression. It was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen this man with such a stupid expression on his face.\n\u201cI made that coffee with my skills, too. Making coffee is my skill.\u201d\n\u201cYour skill is making coffee?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun lifted the coffee cup in front of him and examined it. The cafe mocha, which he had only drank a couple of sips, was lightly rippling.\nI extracted the espresso again in front of him and quickly made a cup of Americano. Ki Yoohyun\u2019s staring gaze was burdensome, but fortunately, my hand moved perfectly with the power of the skill.\n\u201cYeah, like this.\u201d\nTak. I put down the coffee and continued to explain.\n\u201cThis coffee has a special effect. If you drink it, it will give you various buffs and recovery effects.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Yoohyun-ssi?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun still had a blank expression on his face. Then, without saying a word, he lifted the cup and emptied the remaining cafe mocha.\nThe status of the cafe mocha I just checked is like this.\n[Cafe Mocha (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Status: Good (Remaining Time: 00:30:00)Effect: Increases recovery speed by 200%.]\nSo, even if you drank the cafe mocha, it would be difficult to immediately realize the effect in a place other than a dungeon.\nHowever, Ki Yoohyun stared briefly into the air and hardened his face. Judging from the direction of his gaze, he seemed to be checking his status window or the coffee\u2019s description.\nThen, he slowly let out a low sigh.\n\u201cNo way \u2026 this is nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s real.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a coffee with a healing effect.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a skill that only me can use.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that such skill exists.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun looked genuinely shocked.\nI\u2019m glad he believes me, but \u2026 that much? I thought it was a good skill, but is it that surprising?\nThe following words were also far beyond my expectations.\n\u201cHow can you judge this kind of coffee so cheaply?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\nFor reference, the price of Cafe Mocha is 3 rubies. I\u2019ve just decided between 2 rubies and 3 rubies. To be honest, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that cheap\u2026.\nKi Yoohyun shook his head.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s groundbreaking to be able to recover without the risk of potion poisoning. The price is not suitable for its worth.\u201d\n\u201cIf you drink too much of this coffee, you\u2019ll get caffeine addiction, too.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Caffeine addiction?\u201d\nHe gave me a look of \u2018what\u2019s wrong with that?\u2019.\n\u201cCaffeine addiction is harder than you think.\u201d\nYou can\u2019t sleep and your head is pounding. It was never an experience I would want to go through twice.\n\u201cBut the same is true. You can double-recover.\u201d\n\u201cHee\u2026.\u201d\nAccording to Ki Yoohyun, this was the case. If it is possible to recover by drinking coffee, it is twice as efficient as using potion with simple calculations. It was a huge effect when you consider how many items were consumed to increase even a little efficiency when attacking the dungeon.\nIn addition, the efficient recovery potions were expensive. Compared to that, this coffee price is not burdensome at all.\nHmm, that\u2019s right.\n\u201cMeoooooooooooooong (Now you understand, human)!\u201d\nI don\u2019t know why this cat looks so proud. It was a better skill than I thought.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nIt was out of the blue.\nCan\u2019t I stay here? This is my house as well as my store.\n\u201cIf you promote coffee with a healing effect in a more prosperous place, not in this remote place, you can make a lot of money.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2026 I don\u2019t intend to work so hard.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun let out a short exclamation. The distance between our way of thinking has widened slightly after the reaction of not understanding my words at all.\n\u201cIf I promote the effect of this coffee and set up a store in a busy downtown area, I have to keep working.\u201d\nI have to use my skills to the make coffee, so even if I hire a part-time worker, the coffee making is still my responsibility.\nAn act that goes directly against the goals of this \u2018working less and resting more\u2018 life. I had no intention of doing such a thing.\nIf a customer who accidentally discovered this cafe is satisfied with the coffee, that\u2019s already enough for me.\nA store that only people who know, know. There\u2019s something like that.\n\u201cWaeoong (Isn\u2019t it a store that no one knows right now)\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the time for cats to cut in.\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong\u2026..\u201d\nWhile touching Mieum\u2019s thick belly for a moment, Ki Yoohyun\u2019s voice was heard.\n\u201cCertainly. It would be better to hide that skill.\u201d\nA voice without even a slight laughter was enough to stimulate my anxiety.\nUmh, I will continue to live quietly from now on. Ki Yoohyun asked me, who made such a resolution anew.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of such a class. How did you awaken?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\nIt was very embarrassing to say that I was consistent in answering that I want to take a break in a psychological test. I glossed over in vague terms.\n\u201cIt just happened.\u201d\n\u201cJust \u2026 happened?\u201d\n\u201cJu-just by accident! The class was decided by the system notification.\u201d\n\u201cWaeooong (You\u2019re so bad at lying)\u2026..\u201d\nMieum\u2019s pitiful gaze was felt from the back of my head.\nWait, why am I answering this man like making an excuse? I immediately switched the positions and asked him a question.\n\u201cThen what is your class, Yoohyun-ssi? How did you awaken?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAre you looking for dark etheric items because you need them to make this coffee?\u201d\nI think he just changed the subject.\nWell, there we go. I\u2019ll let it slide.\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar.\u201d\nI was frustrated because I couldn\u2019t say that I needed it to save my friend, but I want him to believe me.\n\u201cI can\u2019t go into detail, but \u2026 I really need it for something.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.I understand for now.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who had been pondering for a while, sighed and continued talking.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where dark etheric items are. It\u2019s been a long time since the last dark-attribute dungeon occurred. However, there are some people who play tricks in the middle.\u201d\nAh, I know this story.\nRecalling what I had heard from Jina, I quickly responded.\n\u201cAre they the Neo-Crown people?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019ve been involved in smuggling for a while now. They\u2019re stupid bastards who\u2019s up to what they\u2019re doing. They will be dealt with soon.\u201d\nThe twinkling black eyes gleamed coldly.\nBut it was only for a moment. He softened his expression.\n\u201cOther than that, some people who have a lot of knowledge about items seem to know. I think she knows about it.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun mentioned an item maker Hunter.\nShe used to be a hunter who led a famous item crafting workshop, but now she is in hiding. Since she dealt with various items, he said she must have some information.\nI got a feeling. If you look at it as a game, [Let\u2019s gather information about dark ether items 3/3 \u261e Done] seems to have popped up.\nBeing a hidden item maker, she seems to have a lot of information. If you watch a movie, don\u2019t you think that a master, who has always turned their back on the world, always helps the main character? A reclusive master whom one has only heard of.\nI finally found a clue.\n\u201cI can introduce you if you want.\u201d\n\u201cPlease do me a favor.\u201d\nI nodded in hope.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThanks for everyone who shared their opinions in the previous chapter, I\u2019ll use \u2018Neo-Crown\u2019 from now!\nPLEASE DO NOT REPOST.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c35": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nWell, that\u2019s enough.\nI wasn\u2019t that curious either. It\u2019s best not to interfere with stories that have nothing to do with me.\nI recalled the last time I worked for a company in my life; the painful memory of having to go hiking with my boss every Sunday after moderately agreeing that hiking is good for health. This is a lesson that I learned through my body.\n\nI smiled lightly and changed the topic.\n\u201cThen, why don\u2019t you come with Hunter Han Yiseong?\u201d\n\u201cUh? You mean me?\u201d\nHunter Han Yiseong was flustered and waved his hand.\n\u201cI have an urgent matter to deal with from now on.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please have a good time together.\u201d\n\u2026.a good time?\nI just recommended coffee, but the expression was a little strange.\nPerhaps it was true that he had business to do, Hunter Han Yiseong left quickly. I thought it was an opportunity to make a new regular, but it\u2019s a pity.\n***\nAfter Hunter Han Yiseong left, I returned to the store with Ki Yoohyun, who was left alone.\n\u201cKids, I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu!\u201d\n\u201cKyaooooo (Is he that human again)?!\u201d\nMieum, who was welcoming me, or to be exact the cereal, said when she saw Ki Yoohyun, who followed me.\nShe\u2019s a bit shy. Since they\u2019ve met a few times, she\u2019s slowly getting used to to Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cHello, Mieum.\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong!\u201d\nAs soon as Ki Yoohyun approached Mieum and greeted her, Mieum raised her flashy front paw and threw a meow punch.\nPakpak!\nOh, he avoided it.\nKi Yoohyun avoided all of Mieum\u2019s front paws that flew quickly and stroked her chin gently. Mieum\u2019s uncomfortable expression gradually softened at his tickling touch.\n\u201cMeooong\u2026..\u201d\nWhat an easy cat. In the meantime, I poured cereal into Mieum\u2019s bowl.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make a new menu today. Would you like to try it?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s great.\u201d\nAmong the five basic cafe menus, the first menu to be made was cafe latte. It\u2019s popular, and it\u2019s the second most in demand basic menu after Americano.\nI took out a thick porcelain cup for the cafe latte. Then, I brewed a shot of espresso and put it in.\nNext, I had to heat up the milk. I took the milk out of the refrigerator. The \u201cfresh milk\u201d I bought at the Dimensional Shop earlier was cold. It looked very fresh and savory, as its name suggests.\n\u201cYou are using unusual milk.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha, that\u2019s right\u2026.\u201d\nLet\u2019s keep it a secret that this is the milk of a Golden Triangular Rhinoceros.\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand.\u2019\n[Recipe: You selected Caf\u00e9 Latte]\nFollowing the recipe\u2019s instructions, pour milk into the milk pitcher, then dip the steam wand and activated it.\nWhen I lowered the milk pitcher slightly, bubbles began to form. When adequate foam formed, the steam wand was locked and the milk pitcher was taken out.\nDone, a velvety soft milk foam is completed. The temperature and foam of milk were just right.\nAfter tilting the cafe latte cup at a right angle, I held the milk pitcher high in the other hand. I poured the milk in circular motions to mix it well, and when it is about 2/3 full, I placed the pitcher close to the cup.\nAfter pouring until a white circle was formed in the middle of the coffee, I stopped and the cafe latte was finished just right.\n[Item: Caf\u00e9 Latte (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:30:00)Effect: 20% of maximum energy is restored.]\nIt has the effect of restoring energy at a ratio, not an integer. It\u2019s quite an effect to fill up 20 percent of energy.\n\u2018It won\u2019t work for me\u2026.\u2019\nWith my maximum energy of 100, if I drink it, only 20 will recover. However, if a person with high ability drank this coffee, it seemed that the amount of restored energy would be quite large.\n\u2018For example\u2026.\u2018\nI glanced across the seat.\n\u2018This man whom I presumed to be strong.\u2019\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Nothing. Try it.\u201d\nI repeated the same process one more time to make another cup of cafe latte. I decided to make one for Ki Yoohyun and the other for me to taste. It was because I was quite curious about the taste of cafe latte made with milk that I bought on impulse.\nI sat down at the table and immediately took the cup to my mouth.\n\u201c\u2026Mmh.\u201d\nThe exclamation naturally leaked out.\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t false advertising.\u2018\nIt was worth buying this milk using ruby. If I can buy this kind of milk easily, the system seems to be useful.\nThe elastic foam touched my lips first. Then, I felt a subtle sweetness. The rich taste of milk went well with coffee, and brought out the flavor even deeper.\nI can\u2019t believe that cafe latte is this delicious. I think I can drink even a few cups.\n\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. This \u2026 it\u2019s really tasty.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun also took a sip of the cafe latte and spoke briefly. There seemed to be no lie in his smirk.\nAt the same time, a golden bar appeared above his head.\nI watched the golden gauge fill up above Ki Yoohyun\u2019s head with a happy expression. The more he drinks cafe latte, the brighter it gets. The moment the bar kicked it to the end, I\u2019ll get a message that I have made a deep connection with coffee\nWhat?\nHowever, no matter how long I waited, the message did not appear like it did on Choi Yichan\u2019s case.\nWhy?\nI frowned and glared at the gauge.\n\u2018100% \u2026 It\u2019s not.\u2019\nAt first glance, it seems 100%, but it was different. The gauge had stopped at about 98%.\nIn the past, I thought it was 100% by eye measurement, but in fact, there was a slight gap.\nKi Yoohyun closed his eyes and slowly savored the taste of the cafe latte. The expression was comfortable and soft.\nBut\u2026.\nIt\u2019s not a lie to say it\u2019s delicious, but\u2026.\nIt\u2019s not the 100% satisfactory \u2018Ultimate Coffee\u2018.\nSlowly, my fighting spirit began to rise. I want to see a full golden gauge full like when I gave the coffee to Choi Yichan.\nIf you are not 100% satisfied with this delicious cafe latte, what did you not like?!\nI asked Ki Yoohyun, who put down the empty cup. \n\u201cI\u2019m actually working on a new menu. Is there anything lacking in that cafe latte?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it tastes great. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever had such a delicious coffee.\u201d\nStill, the gauge didn\u2019t move a bit at 98%.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, what\u2019s your favorite drink?\u201d\n\u201cYes? Well, I drink everything well.\u201d\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\nThe word \u2018drink everything well\u2018 also meant that he has no special preference. It is the opposite of Choi Yichan, who only likes sweet drinks. Rather, it would be easier to find the \u2018Ultimate Coffee\u2019 for someone with a clear preference like Choi Yichan.\nThe limitation of the skill \u2018The Bond of a Cup of Coffee\u2019 is to copy the skill of \u2018The person who drank the Ultimate Coffee\u2018. In other words, in order to copy their skill, the person has to drink their favorite coffee.\nSo, in front of this man, whom I presumed to be secretly strong, I wondered what Ki Yoohyun\u2019s skill would be. Maybe he has a very strong skill, so I might be able to copy and use it.\nNo, it\u2019s too early to be discouraged. I\u2019ve only made the first of the five basic cafe menus.\nThe next menu will definitely have a different reaction. It was unacceptable that this cafe latte was only 98% satisfactory.\nI decided to make the next menu right away.\nNext was cappuccino. Cappuccino is similar to cafe latte in that the milk is added to the shot of espresso, but the ratio of milk foam was different.\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand.\u2019\n[Recipe: You selected Cappuccino.]\nFirst I took out a smaller porcelain cup and then poured in the espresso. After that, I heated the milk again.\nHowever, this time, the bubbles were enriched by injecting air longer than before. After scooping up the milk foam with a wide spoon, pouring it over the espresso, and pouring the remaining milk into the cup, it was finally done.\nA golden circle of coffee appeared on the rim of the cup. Finally, when I sprinkled cinnamon powder, the status window appeared.\n[Item: Cappuccino (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:30:00)Effect: 20% of maximum stamina is restored.]\nThis time, it was the effect of recovering stamina at a ratio.\nThis effect didn\u2019t help me much either, but the coffee was still delicious. The rich milk foam was light and soft.\n\u201cHow about this one?\u201d\nI looked at Ki Yoohyun with a pounding heart.\nHowever, the gauge over his head stopped at exactly 98% this time as well. No matter how long I waited, the gauge didn\u2019t seem to move.\n\u201cThank you for the drink \u2026 is there anything wrong?\u201d\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\nI forgot to answer Ki Yoohyun\u2019s question and was lost in thought.\nWas it a problem that it wasn\u2019t a sweet drink?\nEveryone likes sweetness. Even if it is bad for the body, the sweet taste is still sold well. \nEven that cat alone likes Chex Choco the most among many cereals.\n\u201cKiyaoong (Why are you looking at me all of a sudden)!\u201d\nAfter removing Mieum, who was trying to attack me with her front paws, from the scene, I took out the ingredients I bought from the Dimensional Shop from the cupboard.\nIt\u2019s chocolate sauce.\n[Item: Chocolate Sauce from Hell (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)A sauce made from the black fruit of the hell dungeonIts bittersweet taste can be used for mocha coffee as well as various desserts.Choose the number one premium brand\u2019s chocolate sauce.]\nAlthough the description was somewhat like a sloppy flyer, the smell of the bottle was very thick and sweet.\nFor the third menu, I decided to make Cafe Mocha. Since the chocolate sauce has a sweet taste, I thought that I would be able to get 100% satisfaction this time.\nFirst, I put chocolate sauce in a cup and poured the espresso. Stir with a teaspoon to dissolve the sauce well, then pour the steam milk, and it was done.\nIt was time for him to taste again.\nThe image of Ki Yoohyun taking a sip of cafe mocha looked like a slow-motion scene from a movie.\nEven though he was just picking up a cup of coffee and bringing it to his mouth, it felt like he was filming a commercial. His sparking eyes were filled with expressions.\nNo, it wasn\u2019t the time to stare at his face and lose my mind.\nThe important thing is \u2026 satisfaction.\nAfter slowly savoring the cafe mocha, Ki Yoohyun put down his coffee cup. He said something, but I couldn\u2019t hear him. I was all focused on his head.\nThe gage above his head gleamed brightly. When I saw the beautiful light, I felt baseless confidence that it would work out this time.\nBut \u2026 the brilliant light stopped exactly at 98%.\n98% again?!\n[Next]\n\n\n Translator\u2019s Corner:\nI changed the \u2018Health\u2018 from the status window to \u2018Stamina\u2018. Stamina seemed to be better-suited because it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll die like a game character when the health point is 0 anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

If the quality of the drink gets better, it means that it has a better effect.\nYes. I bought them all because I needed them.

The chilly morning air felt pleasant.\nI was on my way back from the convenience store where I walked for a long time to buy cereal and gimbap for me to eat.\nI stood looking at the endlessly upward stone wall of the Great Dungeon Abyss while stretching my body. My sore shoulder has eased a little.\nAt that moment, I could feel the presence of people in the vicinity.\n\u2018Who is it?\u2019\nI turned to the side of the sound.\nThe owners of the voices were Ki Yoohyun and Han Yiseong.\nI thought about greeting them, but the two were talking in a serious mood. The wind made me hide. I wanted to avoid them, but I have to pass the road in front of them to get back to the store.\nI didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop. Do I have to make some noise?\nBut here,\n\u2018Uhum, hmm, it\u2019s been a while.\u2018\nWouldn\u2019t it be incredibly awkward if I sneak out while doing it?

Deal with what?\nI couldn\u2019t hear all the words afterwards, but the meaning of the word \u2018take care of it\u2018 was quite eerie. It was never an atmosphere to talk about garbage disposal or automatic bank transfers.\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nIt was already too late to appear naturally. Should I step back for now? I could take a detour.\nGulp, it was the moment when I swallowed dry saliva and took a step back\u2026.\nPop!\n\u201cU-Uagh!\u201d\nThe concrete brick wall where I was hiding burst. The hard bricks were turned to powder in an instant.\nIf I had taken two more steps to the side, it would have been my head, not the brick, that had exploded.\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\nA cold voice was heard overhead.\n\u201c\u2026.Hick.\u201d\nI shut my mouth. I was so startled that I hiccuped. Neither sitting down nor standing, I leaned out of the wall in an awkward position.\nI could feel the frozen gaze looking down at me. Ki Yoohyun said in a slightly dumbfounded voice.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cHiccup, Hic \u2026 Hick.\u201d\nNo words come out because of  the hiccups. I tried to hold my breath, but the hiccups kept tormenting me. I covered my mouth with one hand and pointed in the direction of the store with the other.\n\u201c\u2026.Yes?\u201d\n\u201cUh, hick.\u201d\nIt\u2019s right in front of my store, so what do you mean with what are you doing here! Instead of proper words, it came out as hiccups.\nHowever, the atmosphere has not improved at all. The sharp eyes stared at me.\nLet\u2019s be still, the skill I can use at times like these\u2026.\n\u2018Smile.\u2019\n[Running the \u2018Smile\u2018 Skill.]\nThe corners of my mouth drew a gentle arc and gave a perfect business smile.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nBut still static.

The well-stretched eyes drew a gentle curve, and the morning sunlit eyelashes cast a shadow.\nHis face was so beautiful that it was hard to make eye contact. It was really scary just now.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I surprised you.\u201d\nMaybe you weren\u2019t trying to surprise me, but to blow my head off? I had such doubts, but I accepted his apology for now.\n\u201cUh, uhm. It\u2019s okay. Be careful in the future.\u201d\nAt that time, Han Yiseong, who alternately looked at Ki Yoohyun and me with a cautious expression, bowed his head and said hello.\n\u201cHaha, it\u2019s been a while\u2026.\u201d\nIt was our first meeting since the Cave Black Bear appeared, so it had been quite a while since I met Hunter Han Yiseong.\n\u201cDid you have anything to do here?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun smiled softly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I was just about to stop by the cafe later.\u201d\nI think you just explicitly avoided to answer my question.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nBonus update because I really like this chapter \ud83d\ude00\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Kyuuuuuuu.\u201d\nHardly, Lime moved its body and said something.\nUmh I have no idea \u2026 I should have brought Mieum, who understands Lime\u2019s words well. I don\u2019t know how she can interpret \u201ckkyuu\u201c.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there such a thing as a slime translator?\u201d\u201cThere is, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cSometimes it\u2019s good not to know, waeeong!\u201d\nWhy, what is it? What\u2019s the secret behind that whisper? I\u2019m looking for a slime translator. let\u2019s give it a try\u2026.\n\u201cKkyu, kkyuu.\u201d\nLime called me, who was in a different thought for a moment. Then, while bouncing its body, it pointed to a certain place.\n\u201cThat thing?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nIn the direction Lime pointed out, there was a branch with more fruit than the other branches.\nThe color is deep. The fruit was so ripe that it looked like it was going to fall off at any moment. Do you want to eat that fruit?\n\u201cDo you want to eat that?\u201d\n\u201cKyu \u2026 kyuu!\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll pick it for you.\u201d\nI reached for the branch. However, I couldn\u2019t pick the fruit well because it\u2019s hard to reach.\n\u201cUm, just a little more\u2026.\u201d\nI leaned in the direction of the branch and clung to the tree trunk. As soon as I picked the fruit, my hands slipped.\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nThen, as my foot tripped over the roots that rose above the ground, my body lost its balance.\nUh, wait. Was there a slope like this here?\nA steep slope was hidden in a corner of this space surrounded by a thick foggy forest. It\u2019s really exquisitely hidden away from the outside.\nOf all things, my body rolled towards it.\n\u201cKyuuuuuu!\u201d\nSurprised Lime chased me, but a slime without a hand couldn\u2019t catch me.\nThe moment I chewed my lips tightly in anticipation of the pain that would follow, the surroundings stopped. It felt like time has stopped.\nAnd then, the system window appeared.\nTiling!\n[You made a deep connection with coffee]\n[Skill: The Bond of a Cup of Coffee (B) has been acquired.]\n[Crisis situation! \u2018The Bond of a Cup of Coffee\u2018 is activated.][Skill Lv.1: Activation time 00:05:00 / Cooldown 24:00:00][Target: \u2018Choi Yichan\u2019 is selected.]\nWhat?\nSurprised, the system window appeared again in front of me.\n[Caution! It\u2019s a skill that consumes a lot of energy.][Skill: Defense is The Best Defense (C) is used.][Defense increases by 500% for 5 minutes.]\nThe surroundings, where time seemed to have stopped, moved again.\nI was falling off the slope, and the ground was already close.\nUgh, it\u2019s crashing!\nBut just before hitting the ground, my body curled up and took a perfect fall posture.\nI\u2019ve never learned anything like this, but my body moved naturally, as if I had known it from the beginning.\nBang!\n\u201cEugh, aaa\u2026.\u201d\nI was startled when I got up, rubbing the hard part with my hand.\n\u201c\u2026Uh?\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\nThere was a tremendous sound just now, but I didn\u2019t feel any pain. I thought I would break some bones, but my body was fine. What\u2019s going on here?\n\u201cKyuuuuuu\u2026..\u201d\nFrom the top of the slope, Lime bounced down. Worried about me, it circled around.\nTouching Lime\u2019s soft body for a moment, I finally calmed down and checked the system message that just appeared.\nIt definitely said that I had acquired a new skill.\n\u2018Skill.\u2019\nThere was an unfamiliar skill in the skill window. I opened the detail screen right away.\n[The Bond of a Cup of Coffee (B)Details: (Lv.1) You can copy the skill of the person who drank the Ultimate Coffee. (00:05:00)Cooldown: 24:00:00Available for: Choi Yichan.]\nI can copy the target\u2019s skills?\nI\u2019ve never heard of a skill with such a huge effect.\nCopying, reflecting, and nullifying a skill are fraudulent skills that only the main characters of a fantasy novel can acquire.\nIf you write something like \u201cI can copy other people\u2019s skills\u201d on the Hunter Channel, your post will be deleted immediately after receiving malicious comments asking if you learned about Hunter from a web novel.\nEven taking into account that the limit of the ultimate coffee drinkers is unclear, and the cooldown is 24 hours, it was still unbelievable that it was only a B-grade skill.\nWait a minute, I got a strange notification when I asked Choi Yichan to drink the Ice Cream Coffee.\n[The target loves your coffee.You made a deep connection with coffee.]\nThe message meant that his skill could be copied.\nThen, wouldn\u2019t it be possible to copy more targets if I let multiple hunters drink my coffee?\nHuh, what if I can copy the S-grade skill and use it?\n\u201cAwesome\u2026.\u201d\nThe golden future of \u2018Skill Copying Honey Bee\u2018 seemed to unfold before my eyes.\nWait, it\u2019s not yet the time to be ambitious.\nFirst, let\u2019s check Choi Yichan\u2019s skills. Maybe it will give me a hint to avoid the tragedy that was set for him in the future.\n\u2018The Bond of a Cup of Coffee.\u2019\nI immediately tried the skill again.\n[You can\u2019t use the skill because the cooldown has not passed.Time Remaining until unlocked 23:50:16][Caution! It is a skill that consumes a lot of energy. If the remaining energy is less than 10, a status abnormality will occur.][Target: \u2018Choi Yichan\u2019 can be selected.]\nDue to the cooldown, it was impossible to use it, but I could see the skills that can be copied.\nA feast of letters continued.\n[Double Slasher (F)(Lv.1) With a certain probability (0.05%), the attack occurs twice during a normal attack.]\n[Push (E)(Lv.1) Constant probability (0.1%) to push the enemy when defending.]\nThere are only two ambiguous combat skills with poor probability. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything special\u2026.\nEh. There was a hidden next page on the skill list. When I turned the page, the red letter \u2018Unacquired\u2018 flickered.\n[Defense is The Best Defense (C) /Unacquired/(Lv.1) Defense increases by 500% for 5 minutes.\u203b This skill has not been acquired yet.How to acquire: Successfully defend 100 times with a shield.]\n[A Deadly Blow (A) /Unacquired/The next attack has a 100% chance to inflict a critical hit.\u203b This skill has not been acquired yet.How to acquire: Attack monsters 200 times with a weapon.]\n[Coffee is My Strength (S) /Unacquired/(Lv.1) Attack power increases by 800% when in caffeine addiction\u203b This skill has not been acquired yet.How to acquire: Attempt to attack while intoxicated with caffeine.]\n[The Light that Illuminates The Darkness (S) /Unacquired/(Lv.1) Nullifies dark attribute damage for 1 hour.\u203b This skill has not been acquired yet.How to acquire: Carry a dark etheric item for 24 hours.]\nChoi Yichan has not yet mastered most of the skills. However, once he gets it, it\u2019s unbelievable that he\u2019s an E-class hunter.\nBelow the description of the skill, there were even kind instructions on how to acquire it.\nI paid attention to the last of them, \u2018The Light that Illuminates The Darkness\u2018.\nNullifying dark attribute damage?\nWait, wait\u2026..\nThe dungeon that Choi Yichan jumped into before the regression was a dark attribute dungeon.\nSo, in other words, skill acquisition = nullify dark damage = survival?\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nMy heart thumped loudly.\nWhen there was hope that Choi Yichan could come back alive using this, I couldn\u2019t control my joy.\nHowever, on the other hand, I also had these doubts.\nThe information was given out of the blue. Why is the system giving me the information I need? Maybe it\u2019s up to something.\nNo, but as long as Choi Yichan can survive, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s up to something or not.\nThe skill grade is also an S-grade, and they kindly taught me how to get it. First of all, I need to help Choi Yichan to acquire the skill.\nThe question is, where do you get the dark etheric item?\n\u201cKyuuuu, kyuu\u2026.?\u201d\nLime called me when I didn\u2019t move while looking at the system window. I think it thinks I\u2019m hurt somewhere.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not hurt.\u201d\n\u201cKyuu!\u201d\nFortunately, the way up was quickly found. There was a pedestal to step on the slope.\nI returned to the cafe, fed coffee beans to Lime, and put my body on a chair. I took my phone out of my pocket and accessed the Hunter Channel.\nI entered several related keywords such as \u2018dark ether\u2018, \u2018dark item\u2018, and \u2018dark etheric item\u2018 into the channel search box.\nHowever, there are not many search results. Even so, all of them looked like this.\n[Chatting] Day 15 of Dark Farming Prayer (0)[Chatting] It\u2019s a dark item; (1)[Chatting] Amazing dark ore \u2026 or I thought it was (2)[Issue] Beware of buying dark etheric items!!!

It must be difficult to obtain easily in the Hunter Market.\nI posted on the Hunter Channel as my last resort.\nAfter a while, a comment notification sounded.

            "c32": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nToday, I met Jina for the first time since the incident where the Cave Black Bear appeared.\nIt was reported that the Hunters of the Dungeon Management Office, the people who were late in responding the last case, were all replaced. In addition, Jina was recognized for her quick work, so her affiliation was changed. From Hunter\u2019s Assistant to the Emergency Dungeon Countermeasures Team, directly under Hunter Kang Hyunwoo. Hunter Kang Hyunwoo is so famous that I have even heard of his name. He is a role model for the public officials. Since she is directly under such a popular person, it is practically a promotion.\nStill, now that she works almost exclusively at the main office, she doesn\u2019t come to the Dungeon Gate often. Until now, I only contacted her through KakaoTalk, but I\u2019ve been curious about something, so I invited her today after a long time.\n\nHowever, Jina\u2019s face was dark.\nI thought she would feel better now because she\u2019s done with Hunter\u2019s Assistance\u2026..\nDeep dark circles, bloodshot eyes, and a sigh that flowed out unconsciously. It was about the same as when she first collapsed in front of this store.\n\u201cJina-ssi, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cAh \u2026 no. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t look fine\u2026.\n\u201cAre you busy with work?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, but I\u2019m just a little worried about something\u2026.\u201d\nI quickly sat Jina in the chair. Then, I grabbed Lime, who was stuck in front of the oven, and placed it on her lap.\nI thought that if she touched the chewy body, she would feel a little more comfortable. This slime\u2019s body was addictive, the more you rubbed it, the more you want to rub it.\nAs expected, when she touched Lime, she couldn\u2019t resist and began to fiddle it.\nRub, rub, rub\u2026.\nAfter fiddling with Lime for a while, Jina opened her mouth.\n\u201cThe truth is, my mother\u2019s son is a Hunter.\u201d\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s son?\u201d\n\u201cI mean my brother.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cA few years ago, he strangely changed his name and left home. And then he made an accident!\u201d\nRub, rub, rub\u2026.\nPerhaps she recalled a bad memory, the hand that touched Lime became rough.\n\u201cBut he suddenly called me some time ago and boasted that he was going join a famous guild. After this, he will not be ignored in the future.\u201d\nJina shook her head. It seems that the person she called oppa was quite a troublemaker.\n\u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t get into trouble because it\u2019s a famous guild or something. Hunters are really\u2026.!\u201d\nJina, who let out a heavy sigh with a complaint, suddenly paused.\n\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. Rieul-ssi is a hunter, too.\u201d\n\u201cAhahaha\u2026.\u201d\nI told Jina that I had awakened. To be precise, she learned it naturally. It happened because I inquired about shop repair issues and tax issues.\nJina\u2019s older brother was a hunter, too \u2026 I wondered if I would have a chance to meet him one day.\n\u201cBut Rieul-ssi doesn\u2019t seem like a hunter.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u201cOh! Uh, look, I mean, it\u2019s not a bad thing! In a good way!\u201d\nJina was taken aback and added an afterthought.\n\u201cMeooong, meoong (Isn\u2019t it because you are weak)?\u201d\nI ignored Mieum.\nIt was a compliment that felt incredibly sincere as it passed by.\n\u201cBut this place smells good? Umh\u2026 is it the smell of butter and sugar?\u201d\nDing!\nThe cookies just happened to be all baked in the oven.\n\u201cI was working on a new menu. Would you like to try it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so nice!\u201d\nI opened the oven and checked the cookies. A savory smell sprang up. It is well baked golden-brown cookies. The shape did not spread or crumble, and it was shaped like a round rose.\n[Item: Butter Cookie (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)A golden brown buttered cookie.Your coffee\u2019s best friend.Beware of similar products.]\nIs it because I didn\u2019t use the \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2019 skill? The butter cookies have a status window, but no other effects are attached.\nOf course, even without that effect, the dessert is great on its own.\n\u201cWaeeong yum?!\u201d\n\u201cBe careful because it\u2019s hot \u2026 ah, it\u2019s already too late.\u201d\nMieum, who was aiming for a cookie, straightened her hair. She seems surprised by the heat of the freshly baked cookies.\nI prepared the coffee while I transferred the cookies to a plate and cooled them down. I\u2019ll eat it with freshly baked hot cookies, so a cold coffee would be nice.\nI made two iced Americanos and sat across the table.\nThe afternoon sun shining through the window was warm. It was a perfect time to enjoy a cold coffee.\nI took a bite of the butter cookie first. The soft, not crumbly cookie melted down with a fragrant smell in my mouth.\nThis time, I took a sip of iced Americano.\nTake another bite of the cookie, another sip of coffee\u2026.\nAs expected, I was right.\nIt means that Americano and cookies went very well together. Sweet and bitter. Coffee after a sweet dessert. It was a fantastic harmony.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nEating sweets relieves stress. Jina, who ate the butter cookies and drink her iced Americano, exclaimed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really tasty!\u201d\nThe golden gauge above the head also showed Jina\u2019s satisfaction.\nTiling!\nAt that time, a system notification that I saw for the first time appeared in front of me.\n[The condition has been met.Combo bonus will be generated.Combo: Afternoon Snack (Iced Americano, Butter Cookies)Effect: Reduces stress.]\nAh, it really reduced the stress.\nPerhaps thanks to the combo bonus, Jina looked more comfortable as if she had relieved some worries about her family.\nAfter distributing the cookies to Mieum and Lime, I sat at the table, enjoyed the coffee and cookies, and brought up what I wanted to ask Jina.\n\u201cJina-ssi, do you know about higher-attribute dungeons?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nSparkle. Jina\u2019s eyes lit up.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, you\u2019re interested in dungeon, too!\u201d\nUmh, it\u2019s not really like that\u2026.\nBut Jina opened her mouth with an excited expression.\nDungeons, hunters, and monsters have become common in this world, but not many people are interested in the dungeon itself. They only care about how to get rare items and how to clear the dungeon quickly. How the dungeon works and what the ecology is is out of interest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really stupid.\u201d\n\u2026 Jina let out a sigh,\n\u201cThe dungeon is an unknown land where undiscovered mysteries lie!\u201d\nAs she said that, Jina\u2019s face overflowed with life that was different from just now.\nShe entered the Dungeon Management Office because she liked dungeons. It was true love.\nIt was true that there was little information about the dungeon itself. So, it was even harder to find the information I was looking for.\nI tried to find out about the dungeon where Choi Yichan was involved in the pre-regression past. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. Gathering information about the dungeon may lead to new ways to avoid the future.\nHowever, the only thing I remember is the keyword \u2018higher attribute dungeon\u2019. It was difficult to find information about the dungeon with only this vague memory.\nI also checked the Ether-Wiki, but\u2026.\n[Ether-Wiki]\n[Welcome to the encyclopedia of the dimensions cultivated by The Eligible.]\n\u2018Higher attribute dungeon.\u2019\n[No results were found for your search.Gather more information to make your encyclopedia more meaningful.]\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe system didn\u2019t help either.\nAs soon as I hit the wall, \u00a0I eventually decided to ask the person who was most interested in dungeons I knew; Jina.\n\u201cYou know that there is such a thing as an \u2018attribute dungeon\u2019 among dungeons, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nI\u2019m actually hearing it for the first time now. But that\u2019s not the point, so let\u2019s move on.\nLiterally, it means a dungeon in which certain attribute appears strongly.\n\u201cFire, wind, ice and poison are the most representative. If you don\u2019t have the right armor or potion, you get attribute damage. If a particular ether becomes too strong in this attribute dungeon\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will happen?\u201d\n\u201cIt transforms into a higher attribute dungeon.\u201d\nJina continued her explanation.\n\u201cThere are two high-level attributes: light and darkness. However, high-level dungeons are 100% dark attribute.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n\u201cThe light attribute only occurs when the dark ether is purified in a special way. Purification is impossible by human power. So, theoretically it exists, but has never been observed in practice.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAnd dark dungeons are very dangerous because they inflict dark damage to hunters. They could lose their life.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAccording to Jina\u2019s words, the dungeon in which Choi Yichan was involved before the regression would also be a dark dungeon \u2026 because they said the F-class dungeon has been transformed into a high-attribute dungeon.\nThen, it would be nice to have an item that can block the dark attribute.\n\u201cIs there any way to nullify the dark damage?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nJina\u2019s face turned pale.\n\u201cHuh, are you thinking of going into the dark dungeon? No, it\u2019s not a place for a non-combat hunter!\u201d\nI waved my hand in surprise.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean to go in. I\u2019m just curious.\u201d\nAfter reconfirming that I really had no intention of entering the dark dungeon, Jina continued.\n\u201cWell, the dark dungeon has not occurred in several years, so the related items are rare.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cEven the amount of stocks has disappeared as a result of hoarding in illegal guilds. The main office is cracking down on it, but they\u2019re so secretive that it\u2019s hard to catch.\u201d\n\u201cAn illegal guild?\u201d\nThe word I never heard before came out.\n\u201cIt means a private guild that is not registered in the Dungeon Management Office. No, you can\u2019t even call them guilds!\u201d\nJina raised her voice as if she suddenly got angry.\nAs a result, Mieum, who was putting her front paws on the cookies on the plate, was surprised and took off her front paws. I pretended not to notice the cookie crumbs around her mouth.\n\u201cThey do all kinds of vicious things, including smuggling and tax evasion. In particular, the guild called the Shin-Crown Party is given special caution.\u201d\n\u201cIs it a dangerous guild?\u201d\n\u201cIt was there before the Dungeon Management Office was established.\u201d\n\u201cThat means\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThat means it\u2019s very wicked!\u201d\nJina looked at me for support. I nodded at the force of it.\nThe current Dungeon Management Office was established 10 years ago. Prior to that, an institution called the Awakening Center was in charge of Hunter-related work.\nHowever, there were many problems such as corruption and collusion, so it is said that the hunter world at the time was like a lawless zone. Slavery contracts, item smuggling, exploitation \u2026 all conceivable heinous things happened.\nBack then, an F-class water body like me would have been rolled into a dungeon as a porter or ore slave. Well, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s gone now.\nIt was said that a guild called the Crown Party, which committed all sorts of illegal activities at that time, was active again under the name of the Shin-Crown Party.\nAfter talking up to that point, Jina took out a thick book from her bag. It was a hard cover that was too thick to hold with one hand.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Rieul-ssi was interested in dungeons! Please refer to this Dungeon Ecology Encyclopedia for more detailed information. I will lend you this.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Do you usually carry such a thick book?\u201d\n\u201cEven though there are some ebooks, it\u2019s easier to find what you\u2019re looking for when you flip them by hand.\u201d\nBuk!\nWhen I put the book down on the table, the sound was very heavy.\n\u201c\u2026.It\u2019s also good for self-defense.\u201d\nJina said that it\u2019s okay to read it slowly and return it later, then she left the one-hit instrument \u2026 no, she left the Dungeon Ecology Encyclopedia with me.\nNow that I\u2019ve got it, I\u2019ll give it a try.

While rubbing my shoulders, I noticed that that Lime was missing again.\n\u201cUh, where did Lime go?\u201d\n\u201cMeoong (It went to the space).\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing there\u2026.\u201d\nIs it taking a nap inside?\nI went into the space beyond the wall to bring Lime out.\nYggdrasil, still with thick branches and lush leaves, greeted me. There were so many branches that even though I picked a lot of coffee fruits, it didn\u2019t seem to have shrunk at all.\n\u201cLime-ah, where are you?\u201d\n\u201cKyuu, kyuuuu!\u201d\nLime was crying in the small space behind Yggdrasil.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles (\uc9c0\ud53c\uc9c0\uae30\uba74 \ubc31\uc804\ubc31\uc2b9). it\u2019s a popular quote from Sun Tzu.\nI\u2019m actually not sure what should the cult\u2019s name be translated tbh. It\u2019s \uc2e0\ud06c\ub77c\uc6b4\ud30c\ub77c (sinkeuraunpara / sin keu ra un pa ra). I think the correct way to read it would be \uc2e0 \ud06c\ub77c\uc6b4 \ud30c\ub77c, \uc2e0 is God, \ud06c\ub77c\uc6b4 is Crown, and \ud30c\ub77c is \u2026 idk, is it blue? and their previous name is \ud06c\ub77c\uc6b4\ud30c\ub77c (just delete the Shin).\nbut God-Crown Blue doesn\u2019t make sense as a name \u2026 and I don\u2019t want to call it \u2018God\u2019 because it doesn\u2019t suit the organization, so I keep it as Shin-Crown for now \u2026 and for the para \u2026 I wrote it as \u2018Party\u2019 because it\u2019s close to \u2018para\u2019 and looks like a proper guild name. \nWell, now that I think about it, the Shin-Crown probably should be \u201cNeo-Crown\u201d or \u201cNew Crown\u201d. Because, for example, \uc2e0\uad6d\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc758 (shingugminjuui) is neo-nationalism / new nationalism. And considering they added the \u201cShin\u201d part when re-establishing the guild, it makes sense to name it \u2018New\u2019, but what on earth is \u2018para / \ud30c\ub77c\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t think blue is the correct answer\u2026.\nHuh.

The shards of glass were the size of a fingernail.\nChoi Yichan, who turned white, shook his head in embarrassment.\n\u201cUwaaa, I\u2019m sorry! I was just trying to put it down a little.\u201d\nChoi Yichan panicked and tried to clean the shattered glass with his hands, but the more he touched it, the more the glass pieces shattered. If he did it a few more times, I thought the glass would return to the sand.\n\nFirst, I calmed down Choi Yichan.\n\u201cCalm down. This is fine.\u201d\n\u201cHua, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to do this\u2026.\u201d\nChoi Yichan repeatedly apologized even though I said it was okay. While I was cleaning the glass, he got flustered and opened his mouth carefully.\n\u201cActually, I haven\u2019t been able to control my strength since my awakening, so it\u2019s like this sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cAha. I heard that happens.\u201d\nWhen awakened, status such as strength and agility rises overnight. That\u2019s why it takes time to learn how to control the strength properly.\nFor your information, it had nothing to do with me, whose status was not high at all even as an Awakened person. Should I say I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t break a cup, or should I say it\u2019s a pity\u2026.\n\u201cI exercise every morning to control my strength.\u201d\n\u201cExercise? What do you do?\u201d\nCome to think of it, he was jogging when we met in front of the White Silver Guild.\n\u201cUmh, let\u2019s see \u2026 First, I do 100 squats, 100 planks, and 100 burpees every morning, then I run a full marathon, then I repeat squats, planks, and burpees again, and then\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.What?\u201d\n\u201cBut today, I only did half of my usual routine because I came here, so I guess it happened because I was a little less tired.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026.\u201d\nI moved a little farther away from Choi Yichan.\nIf I add up all the workouts I\u2019ve done since I was born, I think it would be less than his daily workout. When I was a high school student, I used to be the first to get tired and drop out of physical education classes.\nNot only that, but those wide shoulders and hard muscles greatly changed the impression. He used to be like a small puppy, but now he\u2019s like a big dog\u2026.\nChoi Yichan, who was carefully eating the freshly made ice cream coffee, asked abruptly.\n\u201cBy the way, what is the name of this cafe?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2026.\u201d\nI was greatly embarrassed.\n\u201cWhy? You haven\u2019t decided yet?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that \u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d\nAfter a moment of hesitation, I finally answered in a mosquito-like voice.\n\u201cCafe Ri\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cUh, what?\u201d\n\u201cCafe Rieul\u2026.\u201d\nThe name of the cafe is very important.\nI struggled to name it in a very strict, significant, and serious manner.\nHowever, all the names that come to mind were not met the condition.\n \u2018Dungeon Cafe\u2018 doesn\u2019t seem like the right name either. \u2018Cafe Abyss\u2018, umh, it seems like a name for a place that will go bankrupt soon. \u2018Dungeon Gate Cafe\u2018, uh\u2026..\nThis is the level of my creativity. I should have kept up with learning that fosters creativity when I was young.\nAfter much deliberation, I asked the two animals.\n\u201cHey, is there a name that\u2019s colorful and simple, memorable, but not too flashy, and moderately unique and familiar?\u201d\u201cPut my name on it!\u201d\u201cKyuuuuuuu\u2026.?\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t help at all though.\nI thought about it all day, but I couldn\u2019t think of a good name, so I decided to give it my name.\nWhen I thought about putting my name on the signboard, I was embarrassed because it seemed too self-conscious.\n\u201cKiyaoong (Cafe Mieum is more suitable)!\u201d\nLet\u2019s ignore the cat who is interfering with my decision.\n\u201cReally? That\u2019s cool!\u201d\nChoi Yichan did not think it was strange at all. Thank you. It\u2019s a little comforting.\n\u201cThen how are you these days? Since you\u2019ve awakened \u2026 are you going to join a guild?\u201d\nWhile we were having a small talk, I carefully brought up the main topic. He smiled awkwardly and shook his head.\n\u201cHaha, no, I\u2019m an E-class. It must be difficult to find a guild that will accept me.\u201d\nI\u2019m sorry for Choi Yichan, but I felt relieved for a while.\n\u201cStill, I\u2019ve awakened. If there is someone in need, I want to help.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nWith a grin, Choi Yichan tapped me on the shoulder.\n\u201cTell me if you need anything. I\u2019ll come to help. It\u2019s hard enough because I have a lot of power left over.\u201d\n\u201cUh? Really? Then, next time \u2026 I\u2019ll ask you next time. Will you really come?\u201d\nI said with a feeling of grasping at straws.\nThe dungeon, where Choi Yichan was involved before my return, broke out in Suwon, Gyeonggi-do. Seoul, especially Gangbuk, is quite far from there. So, at least this place will be safe for him.\nI was terrified to think that I might not see him again when winter approached and it snowed.\n\u201cAh, of course. I will come right away when you call me, so please call me.\u201d\nChoi Yichan smiled broadly. He gave me that promise and left the cafe.\n***\n[Congratulations! You have completed\u00a0\u2018Sub-Quest: The Ultimate Coffee\u2019.Please collect the reward.][Skill point owned: 1][Please choose a skill to level up.]\nAfter Choi Yichan left, the quest completion notification popped up and the skill points came in. It seems that the quest was accomplished by giving Choi Yichan an ice cream coffee earlier.\nSo what on earth is The Ultimate\u2026.\nThe question remained, but it wasn\u2019t important.\nI leveled up the Barista Skill by using skill point with excitement.\n[The Barista\u2019s Extraction\u00a0(D)Details: (Lv.2) Extract only the desired substance from the mixed substances.]\n\u201cHuhuhu\u2026.\u201d\nAs expected, I was right.\nIf I use this skill, I will be able to make sugar without bothering with trimmed the stems,\u00a0squeezed the sap,\u00a0filtered out the residue,\u00a0boiled, boiled, boiled, and boiled again steps.\nThere is no reason to waste time. I took the stalks of the dungeon sugarcane that I had cut beforehand. I used the skill immediately before the deluded Mieum attacked the fluttering leaves\n\u2018The Barista\u2019s Extraction.\u2019\n[The extraction is complete.]\nWith the glittering light, the stalk of the dungeon sugarcane disappeared and only the sap remained.\nDark brown with a moderately sticky texture, and this sweet smell that comes out of it. When I dipped it a little and tasted it, I could feel the deep sweetness.\nWe have succeeded!\n\u201cMeow, it smells good!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu!\u201d\nSince the sap extraction was successful, the remaining process was simple. I poured the sap into a square bowl and placed it on a well-ventilated window. After feeding the cat and slime, I ate dinner, and when I came back, it hardened just right.\nThe sap that had turned into hard caramel was cut into squares with a knife. When I put the square lump in a blender and grind it, it soon turned into fine granules of sugar.\n[Item: Magic Sugar (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)Natural sugar made by hardening the sap of Dungeon Sugarcane.It\u2019s sweet, but it\u2019s good for your body. No matter how much you eat, don\u2019t worry about blood sugar.Maybe you can get a special effect depending on the recipe?]\nSugar has many uses. But before that, there was something I wanted to make first.\n***\nThe next day, I called the cat and slime in front of me and asked with a solemn expression.\n\u201cIf there is one thing missing about this cafe, what would it be?\u201d\nMieum and Lime had a lukewarm response.\n\u201cKyuu\u2026.?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about all of a sudden, meong.\u201d\n\u201cTell me. What is the shortcoming of this cafe, which is about to officially open now?\u201d\nMieum, who was lying down on her stomach for a while, raised her front paws up.\n\u201cMascot?\u201d\n\u201cKyuuu.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, there should be a cute animal mascot.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.not that.\u201d\n\u201cInterior?\u201d\n\u201cKyuuu.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that, think carefully.\u201d\nI shook my head. Mieum raised her front paws, proudly said that this time is the correct answer.\n\u201cCustomer!\u201d\n\u201cKyuuu, Kyuuuuuuuu!\u201d\nNext to her, Lime violently bounced its body as sign of agreement.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what you guys thought about the shortcoming of this cafe? \u2026 I am a little hurt.\nGiving up on asking these animals for the correct answer, I put the plastic bag in my hand on the table. Then, I took out the stuff inside one by one.\nEggs, butter, and flour. They were all just bought from the supermarket.\nAnd I put the magic sugar that I finished yesterday next to it.\n\u201cWhat this cafe lacks \u2026 It\u2019s a dessert.\u201d\nAs expected, cafes should have dessert menus as well as drinks.\nAmericano is delicious, it\u2019s surprisingly delicious, but \u2026 \u00a0I felt a little disappointed. If there is dessert here, it\u2019ll be perfect.\nSweet dessert and fragrant Americano. The taste of Americano gives a refreshing finish to the soft sweetness. Needless to say, it\u2019s a fantastic combination.\nSo, after finishing the sugar, I decided to make a dessert to eat with the coffee.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nI waited for a while, but the system did not respond. It\u2019s a right time to launch a completely new quest\u2026.\nI was a little puzzled because it was different from the time when the notification rang to the point of raising my annoyance. After the obsession phase, is it neglecting me now? I was skeptical that it was only in the beginning that the rewards were generously poured and then slightly reduced.\nWell, anyway. The menu I\u2019m going to make today is butter cookies.\nThe ingredients are simple and relatively easy, so it is a recipe that I can make. The soft texture that melts softly will go very well with coffee.\nFirst, leave the butter at room temperature, put it in a bowl, and whisk it. Next, add sugar and mix it until there\u2019s no crunching sound. Add eggs and flour to creamy butter in order, then mix it to complete the dough.\n\u201cIt\u2019s done \u2026 wait, Kwon Mieum, stop!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d\nMieum tried to taste the dough by dipping it with her front feet. I can\u2019t let my guard down with this cat.\nShe tried to pretend she didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but the yellow dough on her front feet was an undeniable evidence.\nWhile separating Mieum from the bowl, it was Lime\u2019s turn in aiming for the dough this time. Dungdung, dungdung. The bowl that hit Lime\u2019s elastic body shook unsteadily.\n\u201c\u2026.Huk!\u201d\nThat\u2019s a relief. I caught it by a hair\u2019s breadth. I almost fell on the floor.\n\u201cNo, you have to bake it before you can eat it.\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cNo kkyuu!\u201d\nI quarantined the two animals that were only disturbing. Then, I started to squeeze the dough into a circle on an oven plate.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nIt was difficult at first, but soon I was able to knead the dough into a suitable shape.\nNext, the oven was preheated and the dough was put in. It was a small home oven, but it was big enough to bake a plate of cookies.\nSoon, the cookies were baked golden in the oven, and the fragrant smell spread throughout the store. Unable to wait for the cookies to be fully cooked, Mieum and Lime stuck together and looked into the oven.\nThen, I heard a knock on the door.\nI looked at the clock and it was just on time. I didn\u2019t realize that so much time had already passed because I was so absorbed in baking the butter cookies.\n\u201cCome on in.\u201d\n\u201cHello.\u201d\nThe long-awaited guest, Jina, entered the cafe.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nApparently, the changes I complained about yesterday is a part of WordPress\u2019 update \u2026 it can\u2019t be helped then.

What is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 soon \u2588\u2588 will \u2588\u2588\u2026..\u201d\nWhat?\nI tried to say \u2018Suwon\u2018, but my voice didn\u2019t come out.\n\u201cOn \u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is\u2026.\u201d\nAgain. I tried a few more times, but it was the same.\nWords such as Suwon, Dungeon, and Mutation could not be spoken at all, and it was useless to say it in a roundabout way. Any attempt to tell anything about the future was blocked.\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\n\u201cMeooow (It\u2019s the intervention of causality).\u201d\nSeeing me in confusion, Mieum spoke to me.\n\u201cWhat?

I could see the tight muscles that would never come out without proper exercise.\nIs it possible to be so different just by awakening? I\u2019ve awakened, too, but I didn\u2019t change at all on the outside.\nIt\u2019s been about 2 years since the last time I\u2019ve met Choi Yichan, and in reality, it\u2019s been about 5 years if I include the time before I returned. He was incredibly unfamiliar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little \u2026 You\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Me? Oh! My face is a bit tanned, right?\u201d\nNo, not that\u2026.\nHowever, his simple and bright personality, his tendency to worry about others, and his inability to turn away from those in need, has not changed at all.\nIf this is the case, the same thing will happen again\u2026.\nNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s too early to give up. I have to find a way to change the future, even if I don\u2019t say it directly.\nYes, talking with Choi Yichan might give me a hint. I struggled to swallow my discouragement.\n\u201cKiyaaoong (Is that man your friend)!\u201d\nMieum, who was lying on her belly on the floor, cried when she saw Choi Yichan\u2019s long shadow.\n\u201cMeooong (Unlike you, he looks sincere).\u201d\nInstead of answering, I mumbled, pointing to a black stain on the floor.\n\u201cThere is some ink here.\u201d\n\u201cWaeuung\u2026.\u201d\nMieum, startled, rolled her eyes.\nI didn\u2019t say anything, but she sneaked to the corner and raised her front paws. I guess she\u2019s reflecting on herself. Yeah, you should be a little sorry.\nIt was really hard to clean the store with Mieum\u2019s footprints all over it. Even after brushing and wiping with a mop, there was no end.\nI even thought about using the cleaning skill I had forgotten.\nThe Floor is Shiny (E)Details: (Lv. 1) Cleaning toilets can be done quickly.\nThis \u2018the floor is shiny\u2018 really only applied to the bathroom. I had no choice but to wipe the floor and walls of the store myself.\nWait, then if I level up my skill, can I use it anywhere else besides the bathroom?\nWell, I\u2019ll figure this out next time\u2026.\nAt that time, Choi Yichan came back after looking around the store.\n\u201cWow, you have a cat, too. It\u2019s cute.\u201d\nChoi Yichan gently tickled Mieum\u2019s chin. Mieum looked at him, and slowly lowered her front paws and placed her chin on Choi Yichan\u2019s palm, making a squeaky sound.\nShe let it slide because she felt sorry for him.\nCome to think of it, where\u2019s Lime? Normally, it\u2019d stick next to Mieum.\n\u201cMeooong (it went to the space)\u2026.\u201d\nReally? What\u2019s the matter? Let\u2019s put off showing off Lime next time.\nI spoke as I turned to the espresso machine.\n\u201cSit down. I\u2019ll make you something to drink.\u201d\n\u201cOoooh.\u201d\nChoi Yichan looked at me with expectant eyes.\nI have not yet made the basic five menu of cafes ordered by the system, but I decided to make a different menu today.\nSince I met Choi Yichan for the first time in a long time, I wanted to make a drink that suits his taste rather than to finish the quest.\nTo sum up this guy\u2019s taste in one word, he liked sweetness the best. There have even been times when he poured coffee mix over ice cream and ate it.\nThe menu I\u2019m going to make today is similar to that, but a little different. I decided to make it sweeter than the common affogato.\nI took out two glasses, filled each with ice, and used the skill. The espresso was extracted and poured onto the ice one by one. After the espresso on the ice cooled down, I poured milk into the glass and added vanilla syrup.\nThe last thing to put in is this. I opened the refrigerator next to me and took out the vanilla ice cream I bought from the supermarket yesterday. It was two flavors of vanilla ice cream wrapped in paper. It was a little expensive, but I\u2019m glad I bought it with a big heart.\nI put two yellow-flavored ice creams in Choi Yihan\u2019s share and two blue-flavored ice creams in mine.\nIt\u2019s like adding vanilla ice cream to the vanilla latte, so the sweetness will be very strong. \u00a0It was finished after I sprinkled chocolate powder on top of the ice cream.\nI held out the glass to Choi Yichan.\n\u201cOkay, it\u2019s done. Try it.\u201d\n\u201cWoah, it looks delicious. Thank you for the drink.\u201d\nI also had a glass in my hand.\nI took a bite of ice cream with a spoon, then mixed it with coffee and drank it. The fragrant vanilla scent and deep sweetness were mixed in the mouth in a balanced way.\nAfter slowly savoring the taste, I watched Choi Yichan. He had just tasted the coffee, too.\n\u201cIs it good?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cChoi Yichan?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..\u201d\nThere is no answer.\nInstead, a long bar appeared above Choi Yichan\u2019s head, and the golden gauge began to fill up.\nSoon, the gauge filled up to the end, and the effect of exploding sparks appeared.\nWell, it must be delicious. I took another sip of the drink again.\nThe softness of the milk and the rich taste of espresso wrapped the sweet vanilla ice cream. The sweetness seems to wash away the fatigue left in my body.\nHowever, since I made it without following the recipe of the \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2019 skill, there seems to be no additional effect.\nThe status window doesn\u2019t appear even when I look at the drink\u2026\nTiling! A familiar sound rang out.\n[Congratulations! You developed a new recipe on your own.You can register this drink in your own recipe. Please register the name.Name: ]\nDid the system have this feature?\nAfter thinking for a while, I entered the name \u2018Ice Cream Coffee\u2019.

According to the pattern so far, I thought the system would give me a golden ticket.\nDid they just raise the standards? Did they only compliment me that it was that good now?\nI feel like the reward is getting worse and worse\u2026.\nI remembered a game where the system was pretty generous when I was a beginner, but when I leveled up to a certain extent, the reward was reduced like a ghost and they started charging. You\u2019re going to screw it up if the system is like this!\nI grumbled in my mind that the system was going to go bankrupt while saving user rewards.\n\u201cGulp, gulp, gulp \u2026 huaaa, ah!\u201d\nIn the meantime, Choi Yichan ate all the ice cream in the glass and gulped down the remaining coffee.\nAfter drinking every last drop, he looks at the bottom of the glass as if it were a pity.\nI picked up a tissue and handed it to Choi Yichan. Choi Yichan, who roughly wiped the cream off his mouth, looked at me. Those eyes were filled with joy.\n\u201cThis is so delicious!\u201d\nA voice full of pure joy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Haha, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it tastes like \u2026. paaah, then it becomes soft.\u201d\nWhat does that mean\u2026.\nBut his sincerity was fully conveyed. Even without looking at the gauge above his head, I could feel it just with his expression and eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had anything like this before. It\u2019s so delicious!\u201d\nI was overjoyed with Choi Yichan\u2019s intense reaction.\nAll the coffee I made so far has been well received. Even the first coffee mix tasted special.\nBut this is a menu that I came up with to suit Choi Yichan\u2019s taste. Seeing a close person happy made me feel a different sense of pride.\nI took the ice cream out of the refrigerator again and asked.\n\u201cDo you want me to make you one more?\u201d\n\u201cOh, good!\u201d\nKrak.\nIt was the moment when Choi Yichan put the empty glass down on the table.\nIt wasn\u2019t a rough move, but the thick glass cup was shattered into pieces.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI don\u2019t know what happened, but the wordpress web editor\u2019s appearance changed T__T the font is smaller now, and it looks different too. It looks the same when posted, but not in the editor page T__T when I did the previous chapter a few hours ago, it wasn\u2019t like this \ud83d\ude26 \nBecause of that, I\u2019m sorry if there\u2019s more typo than usual, or something like that. The new appearance makes my eyes uncomfortable \u2026 I wish there\u2019s a way to restore it to the previous appearance.\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c29": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nAfter returned to the past, I was immediately distracted by my own problems, so I couldn\u2019t even think of it. No, maybe I was deliberately trying not to think about it.\nEven before my regression, Choi Yichan had awakened as a Hunter. He was an E-class defensive hunter.\nAll my friends and I congratulated Choi Yichan. It\u2019s generally not a high grade, but Hunter is Hunter. They\u2019re rare, and not everyone can become an Awakened.\n\nThere was no one better suited to be a Hunter than Choi Yichan, who likes to help others. Back then, we giggled and teased him about what if he would soon become famous and we\u2019ll only see him on TV.\nWe really didn\u2019t get to see each other again.\nA rift occurs near an elementary school in Suwon, Gyeonggi-do. Choi Yichan, who was nearby, voluntarily jumped into the dungeon to prevent the children from getting caught up.\nThat was his first and last dungeon trip.\nThe dungeon that was initially identified as an F-class dungeon unexpectedly transformed into a higher-level attribute dungeon, and Choi Yichan died without even using his strength properly due to the powerful attribute attack.\nThe three letters of his name was found at the end of the list of fatalities in the Breaking News.\nThat was it. No bodies were found.\nAfter that day, Choi Yichan\u2019s story was taboo among my friends. Not only that, but we stopped talking about Hunter completely.\nNo matter how great Hunter is, Choi Yichan died in the end. We didn\u2019t know how to accept the death of a close person.\n\u201cKwon Ri, are you sick? You don\u2019t look good.\u201d\nThe remark brought me to my senses. I lifted my head.\nA sun-tanned face was looking anxiously at me.\nHe\u2019s still alive.\nIt\u2019s only a memory before the regression, and the present Choi Yichan is still safe.\nThe tremor finally stopped when I repeated it in my mind.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ll call you later. Let\u2019s eat together sometime.\u201d\n\u201cUh, hey, wait a minute!\u201d\nI called, but Choi Yichan only waved his hand and continued his run. Soon, his back became as small as a fingernail.\nHe\u2019s still alive.\nBut soon\u2026.\nMy heart was beating wildly.\nI have never thought deeply about the meaning of regression. I just thought I was lucky to have come back from death, and I was focused on living a different life from the past.\nHowever, that was not all.\nThis is what it meant to be back in the past. I can meet someone who I will never see again.\nPerhaps \u2026 I might be able to change the future.\nThe wind was cold. I stared at his back as he moved away and turned around.\n***\n\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d\nFlutter.\nWhen I returned to the store and opened the door, a piece of paper fluttered in the wind fell over my head.\nUh, what is this?\nWhen I picked it up, it was a tissue. A tissue with Mieum\u2019s feet stamped in the middle. The tissue  stamped with the footprints must have been blown away.\nI put the tissue in my pocket, and one flew away again.\nFlutter, flutter, flutter\u2026.\nThe endless pouring of tissues were all stamped with footprints.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nI had an ominous feeling. I hurriedly entered the store and looked around.\nA mountain of tissue was piled up on the floor and on the table. Not only that, but they also left footprints on the floor and the walls.\n\u201cMieum-ah, Lime-ah, where are you?\u201d\nI wandered around looking for the animals that caused the accident. Soon, a thin cry was heard from the warehouse inside.\nBang. I slammed the door open and looked inside.\nThe cat, who was obsessed with stamping the floor with its paws for a long time, and the slime who had been encouraging it were startled.\n\u201cMieum?\u201d\n\u201cWaeung\u2026\u2026.\u201d \n\u201cLime?\u201d \n\u201cKkyuu\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThe two animals kept their heads down as if they were ashamed.\n\u201cYou must have had a lot of fun stamping\u2026.\u201d\nI\u2019m glad she got her liveliness back. My head ached at the thought of wiping out all those ink stains.\nRaising animals is really hard\u2026.\n***\nKwon Jiwoon lifted his head as he felt his head throb.\nTime passed, and the evening was near. There was still work to be done, but stiff fatigue weighed on his body.\n\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201d\nThe image of him rubbing his fingertips around his eyes looks very delicate. After his awakening, his hair turned to silver and it created an atmosphere like a cold winter breeze.\nKwon Jiwoon picked up the document he had left on his desk.\nHe already knows the content even without reading it. There will be no difference between the documents he has already received several times and this one.\nThe document was about the guild leader of White Silver Guild. In other words, it was the result of a search for Kwon Rieul\u2019s uncle and Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s father.\nThere are no results.\nHis father entered a dungeon a few years ago and never returned. Normally, you\u2019d think he was killed in the dungeon. Hunter\u2019s death in the dungeon has happened many times since the birth of dungeons, monsters, and Awakeners in the world.\nHowever, Kwon Jiwoon did not think his father was dead.\nIt\u2019s not just because it\u2019s hard to accept reality. It\u2019s because there was something suspicious about the day his father went missing.\nThat\u2019s the reason why he\u2019s still not giving up and continuing the search.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon looked into his status window. Red mark blinks in the notification indicator.\n[Your mana has run out.][Debuff: All stats are reduced by 70%.]\nHe overused his skills today to treat the hunters who were injured in a rift a few days ago. When he\u2019s about to run out of mana, he drank potion, and again, and again\u2026.\nAfter repeating this process several times, his status were lowered to the bottom due to a debuff caused by mana depletion.\nEver since his father disappeared, the White Silver Guild has been Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s responsibility.\nHe never took that responsibility too seriously. However, when his status were in such a mess, a sense of helplessness that could not be swallowed all rose.\nThere are about 30 minutes left until the next schedule. It\u2019s not that new letters would pop out of the paperwork just by staring at it. The throbbing in his head only got worse.\nKwon Jiwoon put the document down on the desk and leaned back on his chair. He thought he should take a break for a while.\nAt that moment, a silver thermos in the corner of the desk caught his eye. His cousin, Kwon Rieul, left this thermos behind.\n\u2018She said she made coffee.\u2019\nKwon Jiwoon hesitated for a moment, then reached out for the thermos.\n\u2018Even though I said I didn\u2019t need it.\u2019\nWhile muttering like that, he did not throw it away and took the large thermos in his hand instead. The headaches were tormenting him endlessly.\nStill, Kwon Jiwoon was against setting up a cafe in front of the Dungeon Gate.\nThe Great Dungeon Abyss.\nOne day, it suddenly appeared in the middle of the city. The monsters, the Awakeners, and the system \u2026 it\u2019s an unknown dungeon that brought it all together.\nKwon Jiwoon felt a sense of urgency when he saw the endlessly stretched up wall. It\u2019s an absurd expression, but at one point he felt like it was alive.\nIt\u2019s a space that has always been quiet for now, but no one knows what will happen in the future. What if something dangerous happens in front of the dungeon gate?\nEven so, he couldn\u2019t stop Kwon Rieul because it was the first thing she wanted to do.\nWith a complicated mind, Kwon Jiwoon thought of his only cousin.\nSince his awakening as a healer, a rare class, Kwon Jiwoon has received a lot of attention.\nKorea\u2019s first A-class healer with strong healing skills. It was natural that the expectations were high.\nHowever, not all the attention was positive. It would have been better if they\u2019re undermining or criticizing his abilities.\nThe attention was also drawn to his family instead. Doubts and accusations about the missing father, and\u2026.\nNot only paparazzi, but there\u2019s also people who approach his only cousin for solicitation purposes.\nIn the end, Kwon Jiwoon thought it would be better to keep a distance to protect his younger sister.\nAlthough it may seem calm on the outside, the current Hunter World is a vicious battlefield. His desire for his younger sister to keep a distance from this ferocious community also played a part.\nBut now, a Hunter is approaching Rieul. Besides, his smile is very suspicious.\n\u201c\u2026.Ha.\u201d\nAs expected, he should persuade her to move the cafe to the 1st floor of the guild. It seemed to be more reassuring to keep her nearby.\nThe headache got worse and worse. He didn\u2019t feel like drinking coffee, but he didn\u2019t want to throw away what she had brought for the first time in a long time. He opened the thermos.\nAs soon as he opened the lid, he could smell the sweet scent of coffee. A scent resembling a fragrant nut seemed to wrap around him warmly.\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nForgetting that he didn\u2019t want to drink coffee, Kwon Jiwoon immediately poured the coffee into a cup.\nThe dark brown water was warm as if it had just brewed. The warmth in his hands melted the tense tension. Even though he only took a sip, the aroma and savory taste of the coffee filled his mouth.\nAs soon as he came to his senses, he emptied the entire cup, and poured another cup out of regret.\nThen, he realized that his head didn\u2019t hurt. The headache that had been plagued him all day as a side effect of mana depletion was completely gone.\n\u2018Status.\u2019\nThe debuff on the status window was also released and returned to normal.\nWhat\u2019s going on? It\u2019s the first time a debuff has been lifted so quickly. For what reason\u2026.\nIs it a coincidence?\nKwon Jiwoon cut off the idea of stretching out branches.\nWhat\u2019s the reason? The coffee his sister made for him was delicious, so he felt at ease.\nHe felt not only fatigue, but also the heavy worry and anxiety that had always been on the side of his head washed away. It was the first time since his awakening that he felt so at peace.\nAs the anxiety that had been weighing him down all the time was relieved, it felt like Rieul\u2019s work was no big deal.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so impatient.\u201d\nHe also put aside his decision to have Rieul move her cafe right away.\nLet\u2019s wait a little longer.\nKwon Jiwoon put down the empty cup. Only the coffee scent remained and lingered around him.\n***\n\u201cIt\u2019s here? This place is very hollow.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a store left by my deceased grandmother.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, uh, elegant, uh \u2026 it\u2019s quiet and the atmosphere is nice!\u201d\nAt my words, Choi Yichan demonstrated a tallulah.\nHe must have squeezed the best possible words after seeing the only old building on a desolate road.\nWhen he heard that I had set up a cafe, Choi Yichan said he wanted to come and play. I said yes right away.\nPerhaps by meeting and talking to him, I could figure out a way to change the future.\nChoi Yichan got caught up in the dungeon on the day when the first snow fell across the country. I don\u2019t remember the exact date, but it\u2019s clear that the breaking news came out while I was watching the weather news.\nIt\u2019s late October now. There is a little time until the snowy season.\nIn the meantime, if I trace my memory, maybe\u2026.\nMaybe I can find a way to change the future.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nTallulah (\ud0c8\ub8f0\ub77c\ub97c) is an internet meme derived from a scene from the movie Cool Runnings. It refers to a situation when somebody speaks ill of something, but then suddenly changes their mind and praises the same thing just moments later to rectify the situation. It\u2019s called talullah because in the movie,  they\u2019re discussing how to name their sleigh, Person A suggests the name \u201ctallulah\u201d. and then Person B immediately says it sounds like a whore\u2019s name. When A tells that it\u2019s his mother\u2019s name, B says it\u2019s a wonderful name.\nHappy the first day of August! Thank you so much for everyone who left likes and comments in the past month.

            "c28": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nPark Heeyoung. She\u2019s a senior hunter in the White Silver Guild and a B-class tanker, she was Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s shield.\nPark Heeyoung devoted herself to protecting healer Kwon Jiwoon, and tried to stop everything that stood on his way, both inside and outside the dungeon.\nFor example \u2026 me, an ordinary relative who can\u2019t be of any help to him.\n\n\u201cKwon Rieul-ssi, do you not understand the current situation? Hunter Kwon Jiwoon is the best healer in Korea. It means he doesn\u2019t have time to pay attention to these little things.\u201d\u201cBut I still have to give this to him\u2026.\u201d\u201cGive it to me. I\u2019ll give it to him.\u201d\u201cPlease tell my brother to contact me.\u201d\u201cStop whining. He\u2019ll call you when he has time.\u201d\nBeing treated like this, naturally, the number of my visits to the guild decreased. Well, Kwon Jiwoon didn\u2019t contact me either, so Park Heeyoung must be right.\nI was glad she wasn\u2019t here in my last visit before, but I was unlucky this time.\nSure enough, Park Heeyoung frowned at me again this time. She also has a knack for showing her hatred just by her face.\n\u201cWhat happened this time?\u201d\nNo, I didn\u2019t want to come either.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that Hunters are busy because a rift appeared a few days ago? The deputy guild leader has a schedule today, so he\u2019s not available.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon called me, so I was angry because I was treated as an uninvited guest. I, too, did not hide my displeasure and spoke straight away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family affair, so what does Hunter Park Heeyoung have to do with it? Whether we meet or not, I will take care of it.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not here right now.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that I came here because he asked me to come? I won\u2019t come voluntarily because I don\u2019t want to see Park Heeyoung-ssi.\u201d\n\u201cKwon Rieul-ssi!\u201d\nPerhaps because of the loud noise, the door of the guild leader\u2019s room opened. Kwon Jiwoon found me and asked with a puzzled expression.\n\u201cKwon Rieul, if you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you come in? What is Hunter Park Heeyoung doing here?\u201d\nPark Heeyoung, who had stiffened, immediately put on a troubled expression. Huh, right. It\u2019s a lie that he\u2019s not here.\n\u201cI \u2026 Miss Rieul visited, so I was going to show her around.\u201d\nShe\u2019s truly a snake. It was amazing to see her speaking in a polite and kind manner unlike before.\n\u201cWhy are you giving tour here? Didn\u2019t you say you have an appointment today?\u201d\n\u201cIt \u2026 it\u2019s changed all of a sudden\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll hear you later. Kwon Rieul, come in.\u201d\nI looked at Park Heeyoung sternly once and followed Kwon Jiwoon into his office room.\n***\nSomething was strange.\nI don\u2019t know exactly what it is, but the atmosphere was totally strange.\nAs I sat down on the sofa in the reception room, the staff brought tea and sweets. Chewing on the crunchy cookies, I waited for Kwon Jiwoon to bring the words up.\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\nBut he didn\u2019t speak at all. As I lifted my head in the unexpected silence, I saw Kwon Jiwoon licking his lips.\nKwon Jiwoon opened his mouth only after I ate two more tasteless cookies on the plate.\n\u201cHow are you these days?\u201d\n\u201cUh, what\u2026.\u201d\nI blurted out the end of the sentence awkwardly. It felt very awkward to hear that unsuitable greeting. In this case, the sweets I just ate seem to be on top.\n\u201cWere you surprised before? Is there no pain? If it hurts anywhere, don\u2019t hold back and tell me right away.\u201d\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nI thought he was going to say, \u2018I heard you\u2019ve awakened\u2018.\nKwon Jiwoon continued beating around the bush for a while longer.\n\u201cRieul-ah, you\u2019re 23 years old this year.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s already been more than three years since we\u2019ve lived separately.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not a relative that I met on some holiday \u2026 if I left it alone, all sorts of personal stories would come out. It would be better to just be criticized first than to keep hearing this.\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\n\u201cYou are the opposite of a Hunter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nI doubted my ears for a moment at the random remark, but Kwon Jiwoon had a serious expression on his face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something for me to say, but they are arrogant, selfish, and live in their own way. I don\u2019t want you to get involved with people like that.\u201d\n\u201cUh \u2026 I don\u2019t really like Hunter either.\u201d\nI just accidentally became an Awakened.\n\u201cYeah, you thought well. Kwon Rieul, you\u2019re an adult now, but \u2026 it\u2019s still too early for that.\u201d\nWhat on earth are you talking about? How can it be too early to be an Awakened? This is a world where many people are awakened when they\u2019re still in elementary school. I was puzzled.\nHowever, Kwon Jiwoon was lost in thought by himself, and he suddenly said something else.\n\u201cAfter all, I was not in favor of opening a cafe in such a place. Why don\u2019t you come to the first floor of our guild now? It would be much better than that place.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.what?\u201d\nAfter all, this was the purpose.\nI hate it.\nAlthough I suddenly awakened, entered the dungeon, and rolled in an unexpected direction, I am still preparing to open my cafe little by little.\nFurthermore, if I placed my cafe on the first floor of this guild, I have to keep meeting people like Park Heeyoung. It seems that Park Heeyoung is being annoying to me for Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s sake.\nI didn\u2019t want to keep confirming that I was a burden to Kwon Jiwoon. I wanted to spend my time leisurely while running a cafe, but I didn\u2019t intend to do it with Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s money.\nThe feeling of being denied of all my efforts in the past made me feel depressed in an instant.\nI was expecting him to talk about something different this time because he called me after a long time and asked me how I was doing. Something more like a family story.\nI can\u2019t do this.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. Did you call me just to say that?\u201d\nI got up abruptly to show him that I didn\u2019t want to listen any more, but Kwon Jiwoon grabbed me. Perhaps he still has something to say, he spoke out urgently and quickly.\n\u201cI met Hunter Han Yiseong and I heard everything.\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cA hunter from his guild is making romantic advances to you.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nAre you talking about Ki Yoohyun?\n\u201cHe said that person comes to your store every day. If you don\u2019t like it, say no. I\u2019ll never let him approach you.\u201d\nOnly then did I realize that Kwon Jiwoon had a ridiculous misunderstanding.\nRomantic advances \u2026 what?\nI thought I heard it wrong at first.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2026 are you talking about Yoohyun-ssi?\u201d\n\u201cCalling him by his first name \u2026 have you already become that close to him?\u201d\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t call people by their first names, then what should I call them\u2026.\u201d\nHey, you there, obviously I can\u2019t call him that way.\nSo, this is it.\nIt wasn\u2019t that he found out about my awakening, but he misunderstood that Ki Yoohyun was approaching me with a different meaning.\nI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t find out about the awakening, but\u2026.\nI shook my head with a disgusted expression.\n\u201cAre you crazy? It\u2019s not like that. Don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun has come to the store for coffee a few times recently.\nBut he\u2019s really coming for the coffee.\nAlthough he was strangely friendly, he smiled broadly as if he was moved every time he drank coffee.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s not true?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know what Hunter Han Yiseong said that led to such an absurd misunderstanding.\n\u201cWell, it was kind of strange.\u201d\n\u201cI know right?\u201d\nFor a moment, I thought I was lucky that the misunderstanding was resolved.\n\u201cBecause that kind of bum doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d\nHuh \u2026 what?\nI was surprised to hear Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s sudden acceleration.\nFrom an objective point of view, isn\u2019t Ki Yoohyun so handsome that it becomes burdensome?\n\u201cWait, then what kind of person would suit me?\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a Hunter, first \u2026 he must be strong.\u201d\n\u201cTo what extent?\u201d\n\u201cTo the point where he won\u2019t lose to anyone.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not good to believe in your own strength and run wild just because you are strong. He has to be someone who does his part quietly.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nWhat? Did you watch a movie about a hero in the dark yesterday?\nMore than that, there is only one person in Korea who meets that condition, isn\u2019t it?\nUmh, let\u2019s respect his taste\u2026.\nFeeling a little drained, I took out the thermos I had brought. I brought it with me just in case I got caught, but it\u2019s hard to take it back.\nSince I brought it all the way here, I wanted to give it to him and leave.\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything weird and drink this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cThis is the coffee I made.\u201d\n\u201cYou said you made coffee? It\u2019s all right, you can take it back.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t need it, you can just throw it away.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.I don\u2019t mean that.\u201d\nWith a complicated expression, Kwon Jiwoon received the thermos. Still, it didn\u2019t seem he will throw it away.\nThere is really nothing to say now. I left the guild leader\u2019s room straight away.\n***\nIt was the time when I came out of the White Silver Guild,\nBugh.\nMy body slumped against the hard object. While walking without looking straight ahead, I bumped into a person coming from the opposite side.\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nI bowed my head and tried to continue my steps, but I was blocked.\n\u201cKwon Ri?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nLet\u2019s raise my head, in a word \u2026 there was an athletic man standing in front of me.\nCurly golden hair, sun-tanned skin, and thick, firm-looking arms. The man seemed to know me, but I couldn\u2019t remember where I had seen such a man.\nA man wearing only a thin sweatshirt even though it\u2019s cold today. I smiled and pretended to know him.\n\u201cCan\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d\nIt was only after hearing that voice that a name came to mind.\n\u201cUh, maybe\u2026 \u2026 Choi Yichan?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right! I didn\u2019t know we\u2019d meet here. It\u2019s been a long time!\u201d\nI was very confused and looked at him blankly.\nChoi Yichan is my high school friend. We used to buy snacks together at the cafeteria.\n\u2018He was very small back then\u2026.\u2019\nBack then, he was often targeted by bullying due to his small stature and docile personality.\nHis eyes are much higher than mine now. Now I need to look up to see his face. His shoulders are broad and his arms look muscular, making his body looks sturdy.\nTherefore, it was not unreasonable not to recognize him immediately.\n\u201cAh! Wait a minute.\u201d\nWhile talking, Choi Yichan rushed to somewhere.\nHe picked up an old lady\u2019s luggage across the crossing. Then, a person pulling a stroller, a person with difficulty walking, a child who almost fell at the crosswalk\u2026.\nIt took a long time for him to finally come back to me.\nIt\u2019s really Choi Yichan. That guy has always been the kind of person who couldn\u2019t let go of someone in difficulty.\nBut if I remember correctly, Choi Yichan would have been serving in the military by now.\nAnd after he was discharged\u2026.\nSuddenly, my heart began to pound loudly. The memory I had buried consciously seemed to reveal itself in my head.\nAfter being discharged from the army, I\u2019m sure\u2026.\n\u201cOh! Haven\u2019t you heard the story yet?\u201d\nChoi Yichan smiled brightly.\n\u201cStory? What story?\u201d\n\u201cI heard Shin Mira told you about it.\u201d\nI took my phone out of my pocket. In the meantime, Shin Mira sent me the answer through KakaoTalk.\n[Shin Mira: Who do you mean who\u3161\u3161][Shin Mira: It\u2019s Choi Yichan.][Shin Mira: Choi Yichan awakened and was discharged immediately. He said he\u2019d like to see you next time.]\n\u201cAwakened\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cHeh, so I was discharged from the army not too long time ago. Haha.\u201d\n\u2026.you\u2019re still alive.\nI swallowed the thought that came to my mind.\nFor an instant, as if the fog had been lifted, I remembered the buried memory.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\n\u201cShe\u2019s truly a snake\u201d actually the term used by Rieul is \ub2a5\uad6c\ub801\uc774 (red spotted snake). It\u2019s a metaphor for  a sneaky person who is sly and plays tricks cautiously without arousing suspicion orbeing noticed easily\n\u201cBum\u201c, the original word is \ucb49\uc815\uc774, it means a useless person who does not fulfill his/her duty properly. I can\u2019t find an english word that matched it perfectly and the dictionary translated it as \u2018Bum\u2019, so let\u2019s just take it.\nI really like Kwon Jiwoon the most in this story because I had a great time translating this chapter :\u2019D\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c27": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cMeooong! What are you talking about?\u201d\nI opened the skill window. The skills I\u2019ve acquired so far have appeared all over the place. All of them are small skills, but there were some that could help now.\n[The Barista\u2019s Extraction\u00a0(D)Details: (Lv.1) Extract espresso from ground coffee beans.]\nSugarcane is not ground coffee, but extracting the sap from the stem is also extraction.\n\nDon\u2019t I have nothing to lose, anyway? Let\u2019s try it. I used the skill while holding the dungeon sugarcane stalk in my hand.\n\u2018The Barista\u2019s Extraction.\u2019\n[Unable to extract due to low skill level][Extraction may fail. Do you still want to extract it? Yes / No ]\nInstead of the skill being used immediately, a warning window appeared. I chose \u2018yes\u2018 without hesitation.\n[The level is too low, three times the energy is used.][Use energy. 85/100]\nThe skill was used with a feeling of a slight loss of strength.\n[The extraction is complete.]\nThe dungeon sugarcane stalk disappeared, but what was left in my hands was not sugar. It was just a black, gooey mass that smelled musty.\nThe cat and slime ran away from me quickly, saying it smelled bad. On top of that, this squishy and sticky feeling was very uncomfortable. Ugh, I think the smell will remain even if I wash my hands.\n[Item: Failed Dungeon Sugarcane Sap (\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)The sap of dungeon sugarcane that failed to extract.It\u2019s useless for anything.Please separate and dispose food waste in food waste bags.]\nIs it just me who feels the subtle sneer in the system message?\nBut it\u2019s too early to be disappointed. When I used the skill, it clearly said, \u2018the skill level is low, so it cannot be extracted\u2018. It does not mean \u2018the item is not subject to skill application\u2019 or \u2018there is no effect\u2019.\nIn other words, it means that I can extract sugar by raising the skill level. But until now, my skill level has not risen even when I complete the quest.\n\u201cMieum-ah, how to raise my skill level?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know that? If you have a skill point, invest it \u2026 kyaaang! Go away!\u201d\nMieum, who ran away quickly because of the bad smell, straightened her hair up.\nSkill point. I think I heard it somewhere recently.\nOh, there it is. This is it. I thought it would be cumbersome before, but now there was something I was looking for in the quest window that had been neglected.\n[Sub Quest: The Ultimate CoffeeMake a deep connection with your true friend with the ultimate coffee.\nDelivering the Ultimate Coffee: 0/1\nReward: Skill Point 1]\nHowever, the explanation of the quest window was quite vague.\nWhat is the ultimate coffee? Can\u2019t I do it with my labor-intensive Americano? What is a deep connection with a true friend?\nPlease write a clear words for the system. If you use this kind of vague expression in the game system, you\u2019ll get a lot of complaints. These complaints were poured out, but the system didn\u2019t even listen.\nTiling!\nOh, there\u2019s a new notification. You\u2019re trying to give me a hint.\u2026.\n[The Ultimate Coffee \u2026 because that\u2019s the \u2018ultimate\u2019.]\n\u2026 Are you kidding me?\n***\nI decided to find a way to finish the quest later, and I returned to the store after packing some dungeon sugarcane for practice.\nWhile looking for a suitable box to store the sugarcane in, Mieum suddenly ran towards it.\nPabk!\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d\nWhile supporting her body by standing on her back foot, she quickly swung her front foot. The leaves of the sugarcane fluttered and shook after being punched.\n\u201cMieum, why are you doing this?\u201d\n\u201cEheum, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nHow suspicious\u2026.\nI grabbed the stem of the sugarcane and gently shook the leaves in front of Mieum.\nMieum, who was pretending to be decent and refused to look at this side, swung her front paws again. She jumps up and down, aiming for leaves that are likely to be caught but still cannot be caught.\nThe cat, who was absorbed in playing for a long time and belatedly came to her senses, made an excuse.\n\u201cThat \u2026 it\u2019s shaking in front of my eyes, so I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\nI felt betrayed. You didn\u2019t even look at the toys I bought you, but this \u2026 did you like this? How great is that\u2026.\nI sympathized with the heart of a cat owner who raised a cat who plays with only a small piece of tissue, leaving behind expensive toys.\nEh, I don\u2019t know. Anyway, as long as it\u2019s fun.\nI gently waved the sugarcane stalk in front of Mieum. Pakpak!\nThen, as soon as the front paws were about to touch it, I quickly removed the stem. After repeating it a few times, Mieum got angry.\n\u201cKyaooo! This great agent wouldn\u2019t catch a thing like that! Do it again!\u201d\n\u201cMy arm is starting to hurt\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cDo it again!\u201d\nPakpak!\n\u201cWhat is an agent in the first place?\u201d\nPakpak!\n\u201cWhat! You don\u2019t know that too? On behalf of the system\u2019s will, the great\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cBut Mieum doesn\u2019t do anything for me.\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong?!\u201d\nMieum looked at me in shock. The leaves of sugarcane ripped off on her claws fluttered to the floor.\nStill, it\u2019s true that all this cat has ever done was eat, sleep, watch television and roll around. Even Lime does a better job by peeling the coffee fruits.\nEven when I almost became a monster\u2019s snack, she went somewhere else by herself.\u00a0 She said she was scolded by the system, so I didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cWaeuuung\u2026.\u201d\nWith a sullen cry, Mieum lowered her head.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I want to help? As an agent who serves the great \u2588\u2588, I am trying to pass on the knowledge of \u2588\u2588.\u201d\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\nAnother error window popped up, probably because of what Mieum just said.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s not much I can tell you yet. Due to the system limitations \u2026 to avoid \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s gaze \u2026 I can\u2019t even peel a single fruit, and I\u2019m useless\u2026.\u201d\nUh, what should I do \u2026 this response was unexpected. I was just trying to tease her a little bit\u2026.\nI feel like I\u2019ve become a vicious human being who asks cats to pay for their meals.\n\u201cMi-Mieum. Come on, this.\u201d\nI waved the sugarcane stalk again, but Mieum just bowed her head and muttered melancholy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do \u2026 I\u2019m just eating\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mieum explained a lot in the beginning. You also taught me how to use skills.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the first time. Now, don\u2019t you already know how to do it well? Waeung\u2026.\u201d\nI vigorously shook the sugarcane in front of her eyes, but Mieum continued shoveling without even realizing it.\nShe was good at shoveling\u2026.\nNext to her, Lime comforted her by rubbed its body. However, the effect was insignificant.\n\u201cRight! Do you want a snack? Are you hungry?\u201d\nWhen you\u2019re depressed, eating sweets is the best. I took out the box of chocolate checks I had saved and waved it in front of her.\nWhat should I do? This doesn\u2019t work either.\nThis time, I scratched Mieum\u2019s chin.\n\u201cMeoong\u2026.\u201d\nDespite the sound of a drowsy cry, Mieum did not regain her liveliness at all.\nAs a last resort, I brought several of the store\u2019s square tissue papers and ink pads for painting. I pressed Mieum\u2019s front foot on the ink pad and stamped it on the tissue.\n\u201cOur Mieum\u2019s footprints are pretty. Oh, should I put your foot stamp on the store tissue? It must be popular because it is cute. Right?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nOh, it worked a little bit. She tried to hide it, but I could see Mieum\u2019s mouth twitching. I stamped her foot on the tissue again.\nThen, the phone in my pocket rang.\nI entrusted Mieum to Lime and checked my phone. It was KakaoTalk from my friend, Mira.\n[Shin Mira: Rieul, do you hear the talk?][Shin Mira: Did you hear that he became a hunter??][Me: Who is he?]\nShe still has a habit of forgetting the most important subject.\nWho the hell is it? When I looked back on my past memories, I couldn\u2019t immediately think of the Awakened people around me. Awakened isn\u2019t that common\u2026.\nAside from the out of the blue content, Shin Mira dit not respond to my KakaoTalk for a long time. It seems that she has been called away while playing a game.\nI was curious, but I put my phone back in my pocket. Time is running out. I really don\u2019t want to go, but \u2026 I have a business today.\n\u201cI\u2019m going out for a while.\u201d\n\u201cKkyu.\u201d\n\u201cWaeong\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nTwo animals saw me off in a weak voice.\n***\nI filled the thermos that I obtained from the golden draw with hot Americano.\n[Item: Americano (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)]Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:30:00)Effect: Nullifies the debuff. (01:00:00)]\nThe time remaining in the status window does not decrease. After confirming that the thermal effect worked properly, I took the thermos and left the store.\nThe destination is the White Silver Guild.\nYes, today was the day I promised to meet Kwon Jiwoon.\nThe reason why I prepared the coffee is simple. If Kwon Jiwoon says he knows that I\u2019ve awakened, I\u2019ll try to show him that my skill is to make this kind of coffee.\nIf I say that I\u2019m not going to be a Hunter \u2026 that I\u2019m just going to run a cafe, at least \u2026 it won\u2019t bother him. I felt my steps were heavy.\nI took the subway and got off in front of Central Guild Station. I only need to walk a little to see the building of the White Silver Guild.\nWhen I came before, I didn\u2019t feel it because it was right after I returned, but the White Silver Guild also has an atmosphere that it was a difficult place to access. There\u2019s not a single speck of dust in the entrance.\nAs the name suggests, I entered the entrance of the white and shiny building with a slightly restless feeling and headed towards the information desk.\n\u201cWe will help you verify your identity \u2026 ah, Kwon Rieul-nim. He is waiting upstairs.\u201d\nIt\u2019s comfortable to pass it right away just with my face, but I can\u2019t get used to this cold atmosphere.\nI got on the elevator and got off the top floor and was about to head to the guild master\u2019s office, but a person came out from the other side.\n\u201c\u2026.Ew.\u201d\nI checked who it was and frowned subconsciously. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting Park Heeyoung and not anyone else.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nMorning release (it\u2019s early morning in my place) because I want to see our dear cousin soon.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c26": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nHe was waiting for the elevator after taking the visitor\u2019s card when people stormed out of the next elevator.\nThe most notable person is Choi Cedric, the 2nd ranker. Judging by the familiar face next to him, the others are also the top rankers in grades A to B.\nJijon sneaked away from their eyes. This is because he was discouraged by their splendid appearances. Even so, they didn\u2019t even glance at him.\nOnce, he too could be among them.\n\nFive years ago, Jijon, who was awakened as a C-class, was scouted by C&L Corporation. Being able to be a part of such a large guild, he  signed the contract without even reading the contract properly, thinking that he could also become a celebrity.\nHowever, a few months later, he was cut off due to a minor problem and transferred to a subcontractor\u2019s guild \u2026 no, he was demoted.\nSince then, Jijon\u2019s life has become very difficult. No matter how risky the dungeon was, the subcontracted guild could hardly make any money. Even if he collected a lot of ether ore, I had to pay most of it to the original office.\nSo, he was just trying to get a little extra income by participating in the tutorial dungeon for beginners.\nHe didn\u2019t know there would be a dungeon mutation!\nJijon, who ran away in front of the giant slime, spat out all the rubies he received from the bus fare and apologized. However, the beginners did not forgive him, and even the guild cut him off, saying that he had disgraced the guild\u2019s reputation with bus scams.\nAnd yesterday, he even got a call from the C&L guild leader.\nWhy him? He had already been cut off from the guild, are they going to sue him?\nJijon shuddered as he recalled the infamous C&L legal team.\nThen, the elevator stopped on the top floor and the door opened.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting. This way, please.\u201d\nThe secretary, who was standing in front of the elevator, greeted Jijon.\n\u2018\u2026.a woman or a man?\u2019\nThe secretary was very beautiful. Long eyelashes cast a shadow over the pale cheeks. The clear features were impressive enough to be unforgettable at a glance.\nHowever, the unique mysterious atmosphere\u00a0made gender and age seem ambiguous. It gives off a realistic, yet unrealistic feeling.\n\u201cThe guild leader will be here soon.\u201d\nThe secretary took Jijon to the reception room inside and gave serve him a cup of tea.\nA few minutes after sitting on a sofa that felt rather uncomfortable because it was so fluffy, the door opened again.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, umh, hello.\u201d\nJijon jumped up and bowed his head. The opponent beckoned him lightly to sit down.\nThe CEO of C&L Corporation, Lee Sein.\nHer ability as a hunter is not very strong. She was only ranked 88th in the top 100. However, she was a talented person who developed C&L Corporation, which started as a small guild, into a Big Three guild. Even now, she\u2019s also a businessman who was still not satisfied and led aggressive investment and business expansion. \nThere is even a myth that the hunter chosen by Lee Sein will rise to the top.\n\u2018Why would such a person\u2026.\u2019\n\u201cHunter Kim Jihoon.\u201d\n\u201cPlease call me Jijon.\u201d\n\u201cHunter Kim Jihoon.\u201d\n\u201cY-Yes.\u201d\nFrightened, Jijon bowed his head.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a guild you belong to right now, do you?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.That\u2019s right.\u201d\nIt was Lee Sein who demoted him to a subcontractor\u2019s guild, and who pressured them to cut him off from the guild, but he couldn\u2019t say that.\n\u201cYour mother is a single-parent, and your younger sister is a civil servant? It\u2019s a good job. They have steady income. If I hadn\u2019t established this guild, I would have taken the civil service exam.\u201d\nCreepy. He got goosebumps.\nIt\u2019s been several years since he left his house to become Jijon in the Hunter world. He did not contact his sister at all. However, Lee Sein already knows his younger sister\u2019s whereabouts.\n\u201cUh \u2026 may I know for what purpose did you call me?\u201d\n\u201cThere is one dealer-damager spot left in our guild\u2019s 2nd attack team. How about it? You know we\u2019re the best in the industry.\u201d\n\u2026Gulp.\nSuddenly, his eyes widened at the big offer.\nEven if it is the second team, it is not a subcontract, but a direct attack team. He, who used to be in the third team, knew well how difficult it was to get positioned there. Sometimes, low-grade dungeons are accompanied by Choi Cedric, the second ranker.\nJijon imagined a dazzling future; the image of himself being part of the group he just met in front of the elevator.\nJijon\u2019s name is placed next to Choi Cedric, who\u2019s ranked 2nd in the country. The supreme sword technique he developed will be widely known. Then, his dark past of running away from the giant slime will soon be forgotten.\nLee Sein offered a contract to Jijon, who could not hide his excitement.\nB: Hunter Jijon (real name: Kim Jihoon)\nEven after he took a second look, his name was clearly there. His heart began to pound.\n\u201cOf course, with the condition that Hunter Jijon cooperates well.\u201d\n\u201cIf you ask me to cooperate, what\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened in the tutorial dungeon?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, I understand.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that the hunter who defeated the dungeon boss was not revealed? Do you know who they are?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is, but \u2026 I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\nJijon remembered the man he met in the tutorial dungeon. He felt a terrifying power from him. If someone had killed the boss, it would have been that man.\nLee Sein smiled broadly. She even poured tea directly into Jijon\u2019s cup in a friendly manner.\n\u201cFirst of all, tell me what happened in the tutorial dungeon. Everything.\u201d\n***\nAfter Ki Yoohyun went back, I headed for the space beyond the wall.\nYggdrasil, who was still growing luxuriantly, greeted me. The coffee fruits that hung on the branches did not shrink even after being picked. On the vinyl sheet, Lime\u2019s peeled green beans were drying well.\n\u2018I don\u2019t think much has changed\u2026.\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s over there!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu!\u201d\nIn one corner of this space, there was a place where the thick fog had been lifted. As I got closer, a notification window popped up.\n[You can open a new area. Would you like to open it?Yes / No ]\nWhoosh.\nWhen \u201cyes\u201d was chosen, the fog was completely cleared and a new empty land appeared.\n\u201cAs you progress through the quest, more and more areas will open and you will be able to obtain various things, kyaooong!\u201d\nMieum explained from the side.\n\u201cThen what do you use this area for?\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 we should find out from now on.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know much\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWaeeong!\u201d\nI looked at the newly opened area after dodging the flying meow punch.\nIt\u2019s just empty land, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything special about it\u2026.\nThe ground was covered with soft soil instead of grass. The fine soil without weeds or gravel looked like a good field to grow crops.\nI checked the empty land in front of me.\n[Place: Abundant FieldHave a weekend farm in your front yard.Feel free to grow crops.]\nI was just going to open a cafe, but now even farming was added to the list?\nAh, yeah. I wished I could plant the dungeon sugarcane here.\nI took out the dungeon sugarcane that I had left in my inventory. After getting it from the tutorial dungeon, there was no place to plant it, so I kept it in my inventory.\nOver the course of a few days, the leaves and stems dried up and all that remained was seeds.\nAfter digging holes in the field at intervals of 20cm with a seedling shovel, the seeds were planted. Then, the seeds were well covered with soil, and water was sprinkled over the field.\nPlanting all the seeds took a lot longer than I thought. It was even boring because it was a simple repetitive task. Ugh, my back hurts \u2026 I wish there was an easier way to do it.\nAnyway, when I finished planting seeds, a notification window popped up.\n[Crop: Seeds of Dungeon Sugarcane (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)After a day of watering, it will grow into Dungeon Sugarcane.Let\u2019s grow them with love.Time Remaining: 1 Day]\nIt didn\u2019t take long until it was fully grown because it was a crop obtained from dungeon. It\u2019s a good solution for a quick-tempered person.\nWell, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to wait that long. OK, let\u2019s check the rest the next day.\n***\nThe next day, as soon as I opened my eyes, I roughly had breakfast and went into the space. It was because I was worried about the condition of the Dungeon Sugarcane.\nBack when I planted the tree of Yggdrasil, it was withered, contrary to the information that it would grow in a day. Hopefully, the same situation won\u2019t be happened twice.\n\u201cMeoong \u2026 aren\u2019t you in too much of a hurry?\u201d\n\u201cCome quickly.\u201d\nFortunately, what greeted me was the densely grown dungeon sugarcane. Its height was about my waist, and the stem resembled bamboo, but was a little thinner.\n[Crop: Dungeon Sugar Cane (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)A grass commonly found in dungeons. The sap of the stem tastes sweet.Note: Ingredients for Magic Sugar.]\nUmh, it grew well.\nAccording to the system\u2019s description, the sap from the stem is the ingredient of sugar\u2026.\nI tried cutting off some stalks of sugarcane. Unlike the hard outer skin, the soft inner flesh was revealed when the skin was peeled off. I pressed the insides of the flesh with my fingertips and gently licked the flowing sap with my tongue.\nAt that moment, I felt a strong sweetness on my tongue.\n\u201c\u2026.Ah.\u201d\nEven though it is surprisingly sweet and rich in flavor, it has a clean finish. I didn\u2019t think my mouth would get dry even if I ate this sap.\nIt tastes very good, but \u2026. how do you make sugar from this?\nI looked at Lime, who was sitting next to me. It ate the coffee fruit, so I was wondering if it could eat this stem as well.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026kkyuu?\u201d\nI held out a stalk of sugarcane to Lime, but\u2026.\n\u201cKkyus \u2026 kkyuuus!\u201d\nIt drew an X while bouncing its body on the ground. I couldn\u2019t understand it words, but I felt it was angry, saying something like \u2018how can you ask me to eat something like that?\u2019. I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\nThis method doesn\u2019t work. Is there any way\u2026.\nTiling.\nThen a familiar alarm rang.\n[Search for the item you are curious about.

            "c25": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nIs that the reason why Kwon Jiwoon, who is a close person to me, suddenly sent such a text message?\nI tried not to think about the case, but there was only one conclusion that came to mind.\nI think the fact that I\u2019ve awakened got caught.\n\nI thought Jiwoon might notice because I registered as an Awakened person in the Dungeon Management Office, went to Hunter Market, and I also joined the tutorial dungeon.\n\u201cDon\u2019t show any interest in Hunters or anything like that, and just stay as a normal person.\u201d\nThe cold words came to mind.\nHe wish I didn\u2019t bother him, how would he react if he found out that I have awakened?\nUgh\u2026.\nIt felt like my heart was being squeezed tight.\n\u201cRieul-ssi?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nFirst, let\u2019s think about it tomorrow, and for now, let\u2019s focus on making coffee.\n\u2018Cafe in my hand.\u2019\nAfter extracting the espresso, I made an Americano using my skill. As soon as the espresso was poured into the hot water, the fragrant smell gently enveloped the surroundings.\nHowever, after making the coffee, there were not many beans left.\nAfter all, the roaster is small, so it decreases quickly. \nI took the green beans out of the box, put them in the roaster, and ignited them with the ring.\nHwuurr, red flames began to heat up the roaster.\n\u201cUh \u2026 what did you just do?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun, who was watching the scene, asked.\n\u201cYes? Ah, what Yoohyun-ssi said was right. This ring is a really good item.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes\u2026.\u201d\nEven though he said it was right, he looked shaken.\n\u201cIf you light a fire with the ability of this ring, it\u2019s great for flavoring the coffee.\u201d\nEven the degree of roasting could be adjusted automatically when lighting the fire. If the beans made from the fruits of Yggdrasil are lightly roasted, they will have a floral scent and strong acidity, and when roasted strongly, the smell of nuts and savory taste became stronger.\nThe exquisite taste change is fantastic and, as long as I didn\u2019t get addicted to caffeine, I thought I could drink several cups of it all day.\nI bought a filial piety item at a low price.\n\u201cYou\u2019re using Cthugha\u2019s ring as a gas burner\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. It\u2019s \u2026 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re using it well.\u201d\nThe answer is bland.\nI handed out the finished cup of hot Americano to Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cAnyway, have a drink.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun received the cup of coffee and took a sip.\nI watched the scene with with a pounding heart. This is because it is the first time to show the taste of Americano to others.\nThis Americano is truly labor-intensive coffee made with my own labor. I was very curious about how other people would feel about the taste.\n\u2026 Gulp.\nAfter drinking the Americano, Ki Yoohyun\u2019s expression softened a little. Then, suddenly, a long bar sign appeared over Ki Yoohyun\u2019s head. The more he drank coffee, the more golden gauge filled up until it\u2019s almost 100% full.\nIt even has a sparkling effect.\nWhat is that?\n\u201cYaooong (It\u2019s a sign of satisfaction, the more satisfied they are with the coffee, the higher it goes).\u201d\n\u201cThere was no such thing when I made coffee mix, right?\u201d\n\u201cMeong (New features are available when you\u2019re leveled up).\u201d\nAh, I was level 5. That\u2019s why I can see that now.\n\u201cWaoooong (the higher the level, the more abilities)\u2026.\u201d\nI pretended I didn\u2019t hear anything.\nShe was trying to sneak me into the dungeon. Who knows what will come back.\nAfter drinking all the coffee, Ki Yoohyun put down the coffee cup.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nThe golden gauge above his head had already given me the answer, but I asked with anticipation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very delicious.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems bitter, but not too bitter, and although it is thick, it is soft on the throat. I\u2019ve tried many coffees, but I\u2019ve never tasted anything like this before. What\u2019s more, drinking this makes my body feel lighter.\u201d\nI also thought the Americano was delicious, but I was excited by the rave reviews that exceeded my expectations.\nIt was not empty words, considering the almost full golden bar.\nKi Yoohyun emptied all the remaining Americano and asked.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the price of this Americano?\u201d\n\u201cUh \u2026 The price?\u201d\n\u201cSince it\u2019s a cafe, aren\u2019t you trying to sell it? If it tastes like this, I want to order it as much as I want.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026.\u201d\nActually, I haven\u2019t decided yet.\nUntil now, I did not receive any money because I had made a lot of coffee mix to fill the number of quests.\nToday, too, I just invited Ki Yoohyun to taste the coffee.\nBut I\u2019ll get paid if I open a cafe later.\nStill, it was harder to decide the price than I thought.\nI think it\u2019s too cheap to follow the normal Americano price. However, it seemed that it would not sell if I set the price blindly.\nBesides, I have only two animals to discuss with.\n\u201cYou have to get 1 million won, kiya!\u201d\u201cKkyuu, kkyuu.\u201d\nNeither was very helpful.\nTiling!\nThen, a familiar alarm rang. I looked at the translucent window that appeared in front of me.\n[The menu is ready to be sold.][Please set the price.][Americano: 0 Ruby]\nThe cursor was blinking over the number 0 and it was possible to designate a number.\nHowever, the unit is ruby.\nHeh, why didn\u2019t I think of this?\nYeah, it\u2019s a cafe that mainly caters to Hunters anyway, so it\u2019d be better to get the money in rubies. Hunters always carry rubies, and the price will be less objectionable.\nIf you say \u20a9100,000,  it feels expensive, but if you say 1 ruby, it doesn\u2019t feel very expensive. That\u2019s why the price of paid items in the game is displayed in \u2018diamond\u2019 or \u2018jewel\u2019 rather than cash.\nIf you draw a card for \u20a9100,000, you\u2019ll fell the reality, but if you draw it with 100 jewels, it seems like a jackpot.\nWhen I selected the number 0, the text \u2018Recommended Price: 1 Ruby\u2018 appeared.

Is this what a farmer feels like when he cooks rice with his own rice?\nWhen I saw the vivid brown color of the \u2018real_end_last_final_beans\u2019, I felt proud.\nI wondered what it would taste like, so I decided to try making coffee right away. Having obtained the beans, the next process was relatively simple. First, I decided to try the skill I got last time.\n\u2018The Barista\u2019s Extraction.\u2019\nAs soon as I used the skill, the method of extracting espresso came to my mind, and my hands moved naturally. \nFirst, I ground the coffee beans with a grinder. Finely ground coffee beans were placed in a portafilter and tamped by pressing firmly with a stamp. When the properly set machine was operated, espresso was soon extracted.\n\u2026 Gulp.\nThe rich smell of coffee made my mouth water.\nAfter putting hot water in a coffee cup, pouring the espresso and mixing it, the Americano was finally completed.\n[Item: Americano (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)]Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:30:00)Effect: Nullifies the debuff.

The soft yet deep taste warmly wrapped the body. My stiff body  and mind gradually relaxed.\nNext, Iced Americano. This time, a fresh taste poured into my mouth.

There\u2019s no reason for me to get a text message.\nNormally, I would have skipped over it because it was just an advertisement text, but why do I feel so anxious?\n\u2026 Gulp.\nEh, it\u2019s probably just my feeling.\nThe heart-pounding is probably because of the caffeine, and the chills on the back of my neck are \u2026 yes, it\u2019s probably because I drank Iced Americano earlier.\nI unlocked my phone and checked the text.

I asked that question while putting the coffee beans in the grinder.\n\u201cHaha, the guild members feel pressured if I go with them.\u201d\nDoes it mean that if an unskilled hunter joins a party, it will be a burden because of the loss of power?\n\u201cAnd the deputy guild leader Han Yiseong also told me to go early.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026is that so?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not that kind of person, I wonder what kind of wind was blowing\u2026.\u201d\nAccording to Ki Yoohyun, Hunter Han Yiseong sent him to go right away when he said he had something to do at this store.\nI heard that each guild is busy because there was a C-class instance dungeon occured recently. From what I\u2019ve heard, it seems like they don\u2019t want to take Ki Yoohyun to the dungeon.\nIn the Hunter world, survival of the fittest was natural, but I still felt sorry for him.\nEven though the main party of Cheongna Guild is famous, they don\u2019t even run dungeons together.\nI thought this guy was pretty strong when I saw him before.\nOh, and by the way.\nWhile making a hot Americano, I suddenly brought up the issue that concerned me these days.\n\u201cWhat does it mean when someone suddenly does something that they have never done before?\u201d\n\u201cDid something happen?\u201d\nKi Yoohyun was watching Lime walking around. When asked where I brought this pet slime, I replied that I picked it up nearby. Well, I\u2019m not lying. I picked it up from the inventory.\n\u201cNo, I just want to know in general sense.\u201d\nIn fact, Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s text kept bothering me while making coffee.\nAt first, I wondered if I had read it wrong or if it was a spam text message with the same name and number as Kwon Jiwoon.\nHowever, the denial of reality had no effect. No matter how much I looked at it, it\u2019s true that the text was from Kwon Jiwoon.\nI decided to visit the guild a few days later, but I couldn\u2019t guess what was going on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Usually\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cUsually?\u201d\nAvoiding Ki Yoohyun\u2019s touch, Lime bounced back.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to die.\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s not it.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon is the best healer in Korea. He was in pretty good health even before my regression. I don\u2019t think he suddenly changed because of illness.\nKi Yoohyun glanced at me with a slightly startled expression and spoke again.\n\u201cDid there ever be an event that could change their mind? For example\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cFor example?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a regression or something like that.\u201d\nI felt like my heart was going to drop.\nKi Yoohyun was still admiring Lime\u2019s translucent body. He turned his head obliquely, so I couldn\u2019t see what expression he was making.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just an example. Twenty years have passed since the system created the Awakened, but no regressors have ever been observed \u2026 so far.\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 that\u2019s true. Ahaha\u2026.\u201d\nSpeaking of regression all of a sudden, I was surprised to think if you knew about my regression.\nWhy are you making your answer so meaningful? You surprised people.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nClose call, MC.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Did you catch a rare red slime?\u201d\nSurprised at the sight of slime, Mieum raised her fur.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t catch it \u2026 but is it rare?\u201d\n\u201cRed slime is the only type of slime that is not poisonous to the body. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t get along with other slimes, and they are also easily attacked by high-ranking monsters, so the number has decreased a lot.\u201d\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\nHearing that, it was a bit cruel to take it back to the dungeon.\nShould I raise it? There were quite a few cases where slime was kept as a pet. It was mainly a slime tamed by Hunters in the tamer class.\nAlthough this red slime is not tamed, it is calm\u2026.\nA system window appeared in front of me while I was thinking.\n[Red Slime can be appointed as an agent. Would you like to appoint it?Yes / No ]\nYou\u2019re saying I can raise this slime, right?\n\u201cWould you like to stay here?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu.\u201d\nThe slime bounced up and down. Yes, I have a cat who eats cereal and loves drama, and I also have a slime now.\n[Please name the agent.Enter a name: ]\nA name\u2026.\nUmh \u2026 Rieul, Mieum, since it\u2019s the second addition the family \u2026 it\u2019s Bieup.\n\u201cHow about Bieup?\u201d\nThe slime suddenly started bouncing its body from side to side violently. Perhaps that alone was not enough, so it drew an X on the floor while bouncing all over the place. It was a clear sign of rejection.\n\u201c\u2026.Do you hate it that much?\u201d\nI\u2019m a little hurt. What\u2019s wrong with Bieup? It means my dongsaeng, this older sister is sad. I thought it was perfect\u2026.\nHowever, the slime continued to grumble and object. I had no choice but to give it another name.\n\u201cUm, then \u2026 since it\u2019s similar to jelly, do you like Jelly?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu!\u201d\nIt refused this name too. It\u2019s a very tricky slime.\n\u201cBecause you resemble a rubber ball, Tangtang?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nI felt a cold gaze. A cool silence fell around so that I could know the answer without looking at slime\u2019s gestures.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it likes the name.\u201d\nDon\u2019t be like this. Mieum, not you too.\nIn addition, as soon as I said the other names I thought of such as Red, Pearl, and Chubby, the slime instantly rejected it.\n\u2018Don\u2019t tell me \u2026 am I the problem?\u2019\nAm I not talented in naming animals?\nIn the end, half-desperate, I came up with a name that came to mind.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a slime, how about Lime?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu.\u201d\nFinally, the slime gave a positive answer. Judging by the light gestures bouncing back and forth, it seems to like the name quite a bit.\nSuddenly, a new member of the family named Lime appeared.\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyuuu.\u201d\nLime spun around me. Its translucent and bouncy body looked soft and pleasant to the touch. I think I can touch the red slime since it\u2019s not poisonous. I want to touch it once.\n\u201cCan I touch you?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu.\u201d\nWhen I gently pressed my index finger on its body,e I felt a soft yet elastic touch. It has a unique texture that, although slightly viscous, did not stick to my hands.\nRub, rub, rub\u2026.\nRub, rub, rub\u2026.\nHaha, I almost lost my mind for a moment. It\u2019s an incredibly addictive touch. At this rate, I thought I could stay like this for hours.\nBut what should I feed it?\nI don\u2019t know if it had a mouth because it was originally in the form of a round jelly. It cried kkyuu, but it was unclear whether the sound was even coming out of its mouth.\n\u201cLime, what do you eat?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu.\u201d\nLime bounced its body and pointed to the coffee fruit on the open branch of Yggdrasil.\n\u201cUh \u2026 are you eating this?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu.\u201d\nI picked a coffee fruit and gave it to Lime. Lime took the coffee fruit with its mushy body and swallowed it, then immediately spat out the seed.\nSeed \u2026 in other word, green coffee beans.\nWait, then, is it possible for Lime to eat only the flesh of the fruit and leave the seeds?\n\u201cLime, can you eat all of that too?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu.\u201d\nLime, who somewhat answered in a proud tone, approached the place where the coffee fruit was abandoned. It spread its body as wide as a membrane, covering the coffee berries on the vinyl sheet like a wave.\nTuk, Tuk.\nThe seeds began to fall on the vinyl sheet. It took less than a few minutes for all the flesh of the coffee fruits to disappear and only the seeds remained. It was much more than a person and a cat has been managed to finish just now.\nLime returned with a slower movement than before because it was full. Behind the slime, I saw a mountain of seeds.\nSo the situation right now is\u2026.\nMe + Mieum < Lime ?\nI felt a little bit of shame, but\u2026.\nAnyway, the work was done in one shot. God, I have a really nice new family member.\n[Green Beans (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)Status: DryThe flesh-removed seed of the coffee fruit.You need to dry it well in the sun to make good coffee.\nTime Remaining: 3 days]\n***\nIt took three days for the green beans to completely dry. \nWhat I did for those three days\u2026.\n\u201cHaaaaa\u2026..\u201d\nI just played.\nFor some reason, the system didn\u2019t bother me, and there was nothing else I could do but wait right now.\nWhat do you do when you have free time like this? Exercise? Self-improvement? No, of course I\u2019m just fooling around as much as I want.\nIt\u2019s been three days since I\u2019ve been immersed in all the mundane things in the world.\nToday, I woke up late again, lay on the bed, and accessed the Hunter Channel on my cell phone.\n[Issue] Let\u2019s make a public discussion about Hunter Jijon.

The two of them have become close, now they used to hang out together and play with each other well.\nAs I got closer, I heard Mieum\u2019s clear voice.\n\u201cWaeeeongh, do you understand!\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuu\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThe bowl is here, the toilet is over there, and the drinks are in the refrigerator.

Kyaoong!\u201d\nThey started arguing over the TV channel.\n\u2018Both of you look happy\u2026.\u2019\nLeaving the two who kept arguing, I went into the space and checked the coffee beans.\n[Green Beans (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)Status: DryThe flesh-removed seed of the coffee fruit.It dries well and is suitable for making coffee after roasting.]\nAfter three days, the well-dried green beans had a shape that looked exactly like the coffee beans I knew. The long journey had finally come to an end.\nI immediately brought my green beans back and prepared to roast them.\nFortunately, there was a roaster in the store. However, it was not a commercial product used in a professional roastery cafe, but a household product that was roasted on a gas fire.\nOriginally, I was planning to buy roasted coffee beans and use them.\n\u2018I was planning to do it, but how did this happen\u2026..\u2019\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the system\u2019s quest rewards and the special effects of coffee, I would have just prepared to open an ordinary cafe.\nI heated the roaster on a gas fire, and then the dried green beans in the wire mesh. This roaster was bought for home roasting as a hobby a long time ago, but it was left unused. \nThank you, the past me.\nWithout this, I would have had to wait another few days to order and receive the roaster.\nOf course, at that time, I would never have imagined that I would be roasting coffee made from the fruits of Yggdrasil.\nAs the temperature rose and the wire mesh went round and round, the beans began to roast. Now it going to smell fragrant and crack\u2026.\nWhat?\nWhy is there no change?\nThe gas fire is definitely on and the roaster is at normal temperature. However, the coffee inside was not roasted at all.\nAnd this pattern\u2026.\nI had an ominous hunch. Somehow I have a hunch that something very troublesome will happen.\n\u2018Ether-Wiki.\u2019\nAfter skipping all the texts that appear in front of me, I opened the roasting information page.\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly strange about it\u2026.\nI quickly scanned the roasting information with my eyes, and at the end, my eyes caught the small letters.\nThe letters written in 3pt were invisible unless you open your eyes wide.\n[*Note: Roasting must be done with etheric fire. Please be careful as it does not roast on a regular gas fire.]\nEtheric fire? It\u2019s a very ominous word.\nMy eyes met Mieum, who was sitting on her stomach in the corner and watching the roaster turn.\n\u201cMeoong\u2026.\u201d\nAs if she had something to say, she cried a little and looked into my eyes.\nIsn\u2019t this pattern too much? \nNo wonder it\u2019s been quiet for the past few days without a bothersome notification, was it for this moment?\nThe feeling of betrayal was immense. It seems that this system is trying to send me to a dangerous place with such a repeated pattern.\nI won\u2019t. I won\u2019t do anything about it. How am I supposed to bring the fire?\nIt was then, \nSuddenly, the red stone in the ring I was wearing began to glow. It\u2019s the same ring I got from the old lady in Hunter Market.\n\u201cUh, why is this\u2026.\u201d\nHwuur.\nAnother dark red flame from the gas fire moved to the lower part of the roaster. The roaster on fire spun round and round.\nOh, it\u2019s working.\nSoon, the roaster began to smell fragrant.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nDongsaeng is younger brother/sister.

I jumped to my feet in case something has happened again, but the sound came from none other than the television.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nMieum, who would normally scratch the floor for food as soon as I woke up, was calm.\n\nIt turned out that she was currently obsessed with the TV. On television, a daily drama rerun was in the air, and the actor entered the door with a bang, making a loud noise.\nAfter returning from the tutorial dungeon yesterday, I immediately watered the branch. And after filling my stomach with the leftover gimbap, I fell asleep quickly.\nNow, I have a throbbing headache and a backache from sleeping that much. There was nothing I had done other than walking around in the dungeon, but I must have been unexpectedly tired.\nRight now, I have to go check if the branch has grown well. This time, it must have taken root properly without withering.\nBut even after I washed up and came out from the bathroom, Mieum remained seated. I\u2019ve never seen this cat so quiet.\n\u201cMieum-ah, let\u2019s go see the branch.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMieum, aren\u2019t you hungry?

It is about to be revealed that the villain swapped the heroine\u2019s child. The abandoned child awakened as the youngest hunter and was adopted by a wealthy family, but he can\u2019t remember his mother due to amnesia. He almost met his mother in the last episode, but his path was crossed by the villain\u2019s scheme\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yeah\u2026.\u201d\nMieum-ah, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy\u2026.\nSomehow, I ended up listening to the entire story from the beginning to the end of the drama.

But as soon as I passed through the blue door of the wall, I hit my head with something.\n\u201cUgh.\u201d\nWhat the hell did I bump into? I rubbed my sore forehead with my palm and lifted my head.\n\u201c\u2026.Ah.\u201d\nIt was a large branch that hit my head.\nNo, a tree. The branch was the size of my body.\nThe tree was the size of my body, and the trunk was so thick that I couldn\u2019t hug it all even with my arms wide open. Each branch bore a reddish-brown fruit.\nA tree big enough to fill this space greeted me.\nAlthough it was written in the status window that it would grow in one day, I didn\u2019t expect it to grow this big overnight.\nIf we can grow trees in this way, I think the global warming problem can be solved quickly.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt\u2019s a little, no, quite absurd, but\u2026.\nAnyway, it\u2019s time to make coffee.\n[Congratulations!

I wanted to draw right away, but I left it as it is for now. This is because drawing must be done with a reverent heart.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of such thing, meoong.\u201d\nMieum, who heard my words, said that it was nonsense.\n\u201cIt was a stormy night\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about all of a sudden?!\u201d\n\u201cI was approaching the number one spot in the game rankings that day.\u201d\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with the storm!\u201d\nPak, the front paws flew to me.\nRanked No. 1 as a F2P player.

To be called \u2018Guardian of the World Tree\u2019 is somehow cool. I felt like I had done a great job.\nWhat\u2019s more, the reward is pretty good because my strength is increased by 10.\nIn the tutorial dungeon, Ki Yoohyun defeated the boss that caused me to reach level 5 at once, but because of the staggering rise, I still have only 10 strength.\nNow I have 20 in the strength status. It\u2019s doubled thanks to the achievement. How strong have I become?\nI rolled up my sleeve, exposed my forearm, and tightened my arm. However, no matter how hard I tried, there was no muscle.\nMieum, who could not bear seeing me like that, murmured from the side.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.is that so?\u201d\n\u2026. I received a cold stare from the cat twice today.\nAfter lowering my sleeves in shame, I approached the tree and picked a piece of fruit from the open branches. It has a round shape that resembles a cherry, a reddish skin, and even this unique smell \u2026 when I took a bite, it tasted sour and sweet.\nIt\u2019s really a coffee fruit.\nIt has a huge name, \u2018World Tree Yggdrasil\u2018, but it\u2019s a coffee tree. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an insignificant thing or not.\nSo now I have to make coffee from this fruit\u2026.\n\u2018Ether-Wiki.\u2019\n[Checking your eligibilities \u2026 Completed.][The Eligible: Kwon Rieul has been verified\u2026..]\n\u2018Skip.\u2019\nI skipped the feast of letters that were listed in a row without any regrets and opened the \u2018How to Make Coffee Beans\u2019 section. \n\u300aHow to Make Coffee Beans\u300bType: Food, Beverage>CoffeeDescription: Describes how to make coffee beans from fresh Yggdrasil fruit.\nHow to: 1) After washing the harvested fruits with water, remove the flesh and leave only the seeds.2) Dry the seeds well in the sun.3) Complete in about three days.\nThat\u2019s easy, right?\nRelated Topics: Roasting\nThe explanation was simpler than I thought.\nIt doesn\u2019t look as easy as it seems, but \u2026 let\u2019s try just a little bit.\nI went back to the store and picked the fruits in a bucket of moderate size. The bucket full of fruits was heavier than I thought, but it was easy to lift thanks to the increased strength status.\nAh, maybe that\u2019s how it works?\nDo I have to do a lot of work from now on?\nEh, no way\u2026.\nHowever, considering the bucket full of fruits and the rest of the process, I think that is correct. Is it the mercy of Yggdrasil, The World Tree, for me to die because of this?\nNext, the fruit was washed in the sink to filter out impurities. Then I returned to this space with the vinyl sheet I found in the warehouse.\n\u201cHuk, huuk\u2026.\u201d\nIn a corner of this space surrounded by a dense forest, where the branches did not reach, a vinyl sheet was laid in places where the sunlight was reflected and the fruits were poured on it.\nThe heavy fruit was twice as heavy because it was wet, and sweats began to form on my forehead.\nNow it\u2019s time to separate the seeds from these fruits.\nBut how?\nI read the Ether-Wiki again, but there was no detailed explanation except for the phrase \u2018remove the flesh\u2018. \nFirst, I decided to try peeling the flesh by hand. When I pressed it with my fingertips and gently peeled it off, only the green seeds inside came out.\nAll right, I can do it this way.\n\u201cWaeooong\u2026.\u201d\nMieum also helped peel the coffee fruit with her claws. Perhaps thanks to its jagged claws, she is quite good at peeling fruit.\nHowever, doing it by hand has a limit. Even after the two of us peeled off the fruits for a long time, it didn\u2019t seem that the remaining fruits would shrink at all.\nI wonder if I can finish this today. As I focused on the small fruit in a bent position, my back and waist also hurt.\nIt\u2019s so hard to drink an Americano\u2026.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t it\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cKiyaooong! What are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d\nSomething felt wrong.\nWhere did it go wrong? This isn\u2019t it.\n\u2026 Why am I working so hard?\nI returned, quit my company, and decided to open a cafe here. It\u2019s a life where I can work less and rest more. In terms of time, I decided to work two days a week and take five days off a week.\nNo, I almost lost my original intention because I was tempted by that wicked system.\nTo seduce an innocent cafe owner with a golden draw ticket\u2026.\n\u2018Scary system guy\u2026.\u2018\nIf it\u2019s a system, shouldn\u2019t there be a way to solve it all at once instead of doing it manually?\nWhen I searched on my phone, I found a machine that automatically peeled off the flesh.\n\u2018Oh, I wish I had a machine like that.\u2019\nHowever, it is difficult to obtain it in Korea, which is not a coffee producing country, and there is no place to put it. Besides, I want to open a cafe, not a coffee farm.\nStill, I did not have the energy to remove the remaining flesh by hand.\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a break for now.\u201d\nI sat moderately on the trunk of the Yggdrasil\u2019s tree. The cool breeze cooled the sweat a little.\nOh, come to think of it, I brought sugarcane from the tutorial dungeon. Is there a place to plant it?\nI opened my inventory and tried to take out the sugarcane from the dungeon.\nBut \u2026 there was a red ball in the inventory that I saw for the first time.\nHuh, did I put this in there?\nAfter awakened and got an inventory, I put this and that because it was convenient. Wet tissue, band-aid, hand cream, leftover coins and receipts, earphones, and so on \u2026 but I don\u2019t remember putting a ball like this.\nI took the red ball out of my inventory. As soon as I took it out, the ball got bigger and landed on the floor.\n\u201cKkyuu.\u201d\nI heard a familiar cry.\n\u201cKkyuu, Kkyuuu.\u201d\nA translucent body resembling red glittering jelly, and this cry. Even the bouncing motion of the body elastically.\nIt was the red slime I met in the tutorial dungeon.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nBack in the earlier chapter, it was already stated that Rieul\u2019s status are on the average. I\u2019d like to point out that it\u2019s the average of ordinary people, since F-class isn\u2019t much different from an ordinary people, not Hunters. Hunter is supposed to be far superior than ordinary people. That\u2019s why Ki Yoohyun would naturally judge that she\u2019s weak\u2501because it\u2019s true. \nOh, and F2P shorts for Free-to-play. As a F2P player, Rieul played the game without spending any money. It must be a familiar term if you play games like the popular Gensh*n Impact.\nAnd here\u2019s our cutie slime. \nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c21": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThe slime caught in the net completely melted and rained down through the blue lights of the exit gate.\n[You have defeated the boss monster \u2018Iridescent Giant Slime\u2019][Tutorial Dungeon\u2014Special Hard has been cleared.][You have reached Level 5.]\nAlmost at the same time as the notification appeared in front of my eyes, a blue light surrounded me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m back\u2026.\u201d\nIt was night inside the dungeon, so I couldn\u2019t know the exact flow of time, but half a day passed and it was evening when I stepped out of the gate. The sunset dyed the stone walls of the Great Dungeon red.\n\u201cWe cleared it somehow.\u201d\nI took off my windshield and was breathing hard, but Ki Yoohyun didn\u2019t look tired at all. We ran together, but why am I like this? As expected, is it lack of exercise?\nIn any case, the purpose has been achieved.\n\u201cThank you for today.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2026 thank you for coming with me.\u201d\n\u201cCome to the store in a few days. I\u2019ll make you a nice cup of coffee.\u201d\nWait, 10 million won.\nAh, no, it just popped out of my head. Wait for me, Americano.\nAnd on the way back to the store after saying goodbye to Ki Yoohyun, I realized that I had forgotten something important.\nAh, I didn\u2019t eat the gimbap.\n***\nDukduk.\nThe room was just as quiet as when Ki Yoohyun came out.\nAfter checking once again to see if there was anyone through the window, Ki Yoohyun carefully put his body in.\nJust when he was about to silence the sound of his footsteps and sat on the chair inside, the door suddenly opened.\n\u201cGuild leader, where have you been!\u201d\n\u201cA-ahem, what\u2019s going on, Hunter Han Yiseong. I\u2019ve been staying still like this.\u201d\n\u201cTake the leaf off your shoulder and speak again.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun hurriedly took his hand to his shoulder and tried to shake off the evidence of going out. However, there was not a single dust on his shoulder, let alone a leaf.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d\n\u2026. He got caught.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses. I knew you were out.\u201d\nKnowing that Han Yiseong had already been convinced, Ki Yoohyun shrugged his shoulders.\n\u201c\u2026.The twins are all on fire.\u201d\nHan Yiseong, the deputy guild leader of Cheongna Guild and the one who\u2019s in charge of external affairs, used to have a headache because of the guild leader who often disappears whenever he takes his eyes off him.\nNo matter how much external affairs Han Yiseong is in charge of, there are cases where approval from the guild leader is required.\nHowever, it was impossible to keep an eye on Ki Yoohyun all day while he was busy with his original job.\nSo, instead, he put the twins Joo Shinwoo and Joo Shinhee as watchmen. The twins, who joined the guild relatively recently as A-class hunters, admire Ki Yoohyun and have no urgent missions right now. They\u2019re the most suitable watchdogs.\n\u201cFollow him like a leech.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\u201cJust trust us.\u201d\nHe believed in the twins who nod with their bright eyes.\nStill, Ki Yoohyun disappeared again, avoiding the eyes of the twins who kept following him. The twins couldn\u2019t say anything harsh to him because he\u2019s the guild leader they admired so much, even though it\u2019s okay to be more strict with the guild leader who keeps slacking off.\nAgain today, the twins ran and confessed that the guild leader had disappeared.\nIn the end, Han Yiseong got involved again. Although he is ten years older than Ki Yoohyun, they had known each other before the establishment of the guild, and he was the closest person to Ki Yoohyun in the guild.\nHowever, by the time Han Yiseong found Ki Yoohyun, he had already entered the tutorial dungeon.\n\u201c\u2026.Do you know how hard it was to control the area around the tutorial dungeon?\u201d\n\u201cI had no choice because no one in our guild would go with me.\u201d\n\u201cYou call that a reason? Do you have a conscience or not?\u201d\nHan Yiseong touched his forehead.\nThe current guild leader and the No. 1 Hunter. That fact alone is difficult enough, but he suddenly asked to go to the tutorial dungeon for beginners. What would the others Hunters think when they heard that?\nIf it\u2019s a company, it\u2019s like the boss suddenly calls out and makes you a cup of coffee\u2026.\n\u201cAre you having a hard time these days?\u201d\u201cStill, Director Kim has a very nice personality. I really like Director Kim.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like saying the same thing.\n\u201cMaybe the guild leader \u2026 is he going to cut me off? I was late in using my skills before, I\u2019m not helping\u2026.\u201d\u201cDoes it mean that my level is only suitable for the tutorial dungeon?\u201d\u201cUhuk, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll listen carefully to the tutorials and come back!\u201d\nIf that\u2019s the guild leader\u2019s will, then I will retire. It was also Han Yiseong\u2019s job to calm the guild members who said they would lock themselves up in a certain mountain for training.\n\u201c\u2026.does it bother you that much?\u201d\nHan Yiseong, who had been complaining for a while, changed his tone. The reprimand for the guild leader, who disappears frequently, was enough. However, he was curious about why he went to a tutorial dungeon for beginners.\nUp until now, Ki Yoohyun had never been interested in anything, and he seemed not to be interested in anyone.\nThen, he suddenly showed interest in something. There is only one reason that he can guess.\n\u201c\u2026.It\u2019s not like that.\u201d\nHowever, Ki Yoohyun shook his head with an ambiguous expression.\n\u201cI heard everything from the twins. You visited the cafe in front of the Dungeon Gate a few days ago.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no secret in this guild.\u201d\n\u201cYou said there was no abnormal reactions.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\nHan Yiseong recalled the owner of the cafe at Dungeon Gate 3rd Street, which Ki Yoohyun is paying attention to. He met her when the monster appeared there, but there was no particular impression.\nIsn\u2019t it enough to remember that she has a soft and innocent impression? She didn\u2019t look suspicious enough for Ki Yoohyun to care.\n\u201cIf you have any doubts, I will attach a person.\u201d\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun immediately blocked Han Yiseong. He spoke repeatedly in a strong tone.\n\u201cNever, don\u2019t approach her until I tell you otherwise.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun was deep in thought.\nCthugha\u2019s Ring. It\u2019s the first masterpiece that the craftsman Kim Deokyi released after 10 years. Just by holding it in your hand, you can summon the God of another world, Cthugha, so it\u2019s worth calling.\nOriginally, no matter how advanced a craftsman was, it was an item that humans could not create, but Kim Deokyi miraculously succeeded in making it.\nThe one and only thing in the world. That ring is unique.\nIn the pre-regression past he remembers, Cthugha\u2019s ring fell into the hands of the enemy. \u00a0This is because the craftsman was deceived by the enemy and handed over the goods.\nKi Yoohyun knew that the craftsman, Kim Deokyi, was secretly visiting Hunter Market that day. So, he went to meet her.\nHe wasn\u2019t trying to get the ring. It was an unnecessary item for him who had already made a contract with another God. He was just trying to warn her to beware of those who seek the ring.\nHowever, when Ki Yoohyun arrived, the craftsman had already left, and the ring had fallen into Kwon Rieul\u2019s hands.\n\u201cYou bought a good item.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThat ridiculous look. She didn\u2019t even seem to know what Cthugha\u2019s ring was.\nIt\u2019s not known why the craftsman hid her identity and opened a consignment shop in Hunter Market, or why she handed over the ring to her. It\u2019s no use to ponder about someone who originally has a mischievous personality.\nBut since Kwon Rieul became the owner of the ring, he needed to know about her. Ki Yoohyun came up with a suitable excuse and entered the tutorial dungeon with Kwon Rieul, and used his skill.\n\u2018Abyssal Gaze.\u2019\nThe Abyssal Gaze was a skill to read a Hunter\u2019s information. He can\u2019t read opponents stronger than him, but at least in Korea, there is no such person.\nDepending on the result, he even decided to get rid of her straight away from the tutorial dungeon.\nBy the way.\nName: Kwon RieulClass: \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 (F)\u00a0(Lv. 2)Stamina 100/100, Energy 100/100Strength: 8, Intelligence: 12, Agility: 9, Luck: 12Achievements: \u00be\u00c6\u00c1\u00d6 \u00b0\u00b7\u00c2\u00c7\u00d1 \u00b1\u00e2\u00b4\u00c9\u00c0\u00bb \u00b0\u00a1\u00c1\u00f8 \u00c7\u00c1 \u00ce\u00b1\u00d7 \u00a1\u00b9\u00d6 \u00be\u2026\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014END\u2014\u2014\u2014\nJudging by her low status, Kwon Rieul\u2019s statement as a non-combatant is probably true. However, the class was block-processed and the letters were broken, so it could not be read properly.\nIt was the first time a result like this appeared.\nJames\u2019 survival, Cthugha\u2019s ring, skill error\u2026.\nIs this all a coincidence?\nNo way. Ki Yoohyun doesn\u2019t believe in coincidence. All the signs, and his senses, were directed at Kwon Rieul. She\u2019s obviously hiding something.\nSo is this a positive or negative variable? He\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\u2018I\u2019ll have to keep an eye on her from now on.\u2019\nIf he becomes sure that it\u2019s a risk factor later, it is not too late to remove it then.\nBut\u2026.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you a nice cup of coffee.\u201d\nThose words were expected in a pure sense.\nMeanwhile, Han Yiseong was thinking of a completely different idea when he watched Ki Yoohyun.\n\u2018Did I just point out the wrong place?\u2019\nHe thought that Ki Yoohyun was concerned about the cafe in front of the dungeon gate only because there was something suspicious about it. But, instead of putting a watch on it, he ordered to \u2018never approach her\u2018.\nFurthermore, he has been thinking to himself just now and even gave a faint smile.\nIt\u2019s like\u2026.\nCome to think of it, the cafe owner and Ki Yoohyun are about the same age. 25-year-old Ki Yoohyun and 23-year-old Kwon Rieul. A young man and woman, only two years apart.\nThe melancholy impression of her chestnut brown hair must be attractive.\nWhen he removed the prejudice that one side was Ki Yoohyun, the No. 1 S-class hunter, there was no better picture than this.\n\u2018I didn\u2019t notice!\u2019\nHan Yiseong, someone who has been married for 5 years and a fan of We Got Married, looked at Ki Yoohyun with affectionate eyes.\nKi Yoohyun was awakened and became a Hunter when he was 13 years old. The first and strongest S-class.\nThe process has never been smooth. The hardships ran through his mind.\nWhen Ki Yoohyun was 15, Han Yiseong founded a guild and entrusted the guild leader position to Ki Yoohyun.\nIt was not that Han Yiseong had great ambitions.\nThe boy at the time seemed to have no interest in anything. He needed no one and didn\u2019t care about anyone. There was only darkness in the silent eyes that stared at him.\nIt was an appropriate image for the strongest S-class hunter, but if left alone, it seemed like the boy would soon die somewhere.\nFor that reason, he created a guild. Because the boy needed a place where he could take a breathe and put his trust.\nGradually, Ki Yoohyun regained his smile and seemed to feel relaxed.\n\u2026. that\u2019s what it looked like.\nEven so, Han Yiseong knew. There was no change from the time he looked at the remains of the expressionless face monster. There is something terrifying inside that people like him can\u2019t even imagine.\nBut now Ki Yoohyun showed the most lively figure of himself that Han Yiseong has ever seen. His black eyes are gleaming with light.\nIndeed, it has already been five years since Ki Yoohyun became an adult.\nThe boy with black sunken eyes is really old enough to look elsewhere now.\n\u201cGuild leader, do you have any intention of revealing your identity?\u201d\nFeeling the weightlessness of the years, Han Yiseong asked. Ki Yoohyun slowly shook his head.\n\u201cNo \u2026 not yet.\u201d\nWell, they haven\u2019t even become close yet. If he reveals his identity this early, the other person will feel burdened.\n\u2018As you said, I will never disturb you, so fighting.\u2019\nHaving made such an absurd misunderstanding, Han Yiseong decided to watch Ki Yoohyun with warm eyes.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI hope you guys don\u2019t get bored because the plot somehow feels slow-paced \u2026 well, I really like this story because it can be included to the healing genre LOL the story is nice and the plot doesn\u2019t give me too much stress. \nOh \u2026 and, which one do you like more between \u2018Ultimate Gate\u2018 and \u2018Ultimate Door\u2018?

It will be over in a minute.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun let out a light sigh and pointed to the back of the tree.\n\u201cWill you be fine by yourself? Even the C-class Hunter\u2019s attack just now didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, then.\u201d\nWithout asking twice, I quickly ran towards the place Ki Yoohyun was pointing. Even if I\u2019m with him, a +2 attack shovel won\u2019t help. This non-combatant will hide quietly.\nKi Yoohyun seemed to be making some gestures while looking at the giant slime. Then a net of light fell from the sky and covered the giant slime. The net began to bind the slime to prevent it from bouncing.\nEven with such skill, Ki Yoohyun doesn\u2019t seem to be struggling at all.\nAs expected, this guy is pretty strong\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d\nAs soon as I touched the ground while watching the scene in front of my eyes, my body fell down.\nThe problem was that it was difficult to see the ground because of the darkness around. There was a steep slope behind the tree.\n\u201c\u2026.Rieul-ssi!\u201d\nI tumbled down the slope.\n\u201cUgh, Ouch\u2026..\u201d\nHow much I tumbled? when I came to my senses, there was no place that didn\u2019t hurt. The surrounding area was covered with bushes, and it was impossible to see where it was originally.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi!\u201d\nI called, but there was no answer.\n[Party: Kwon Rieul, Ki Yoohyun]\nOnly the party window showed that Ki Yoohyun was still in the dungeon. It looks like it doesn\u2019t come with communication or GPS functions, so I can\u2019t find his location.\nShould I rip this bracelet?\nI saw the paper bracelet I received from the entrance. They said that if I tear it up in a crisis, they will come to my aid.\nI haven\u2019t got the ethereal water yet, but\u2026.\n\u201cKkyuuuuu\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThen, as I was about to tear the bracelet, a red slime appeared in front of me.\n\u201cAaargh!\u201d\nI was startled and swung my (attack: 2) shovel wildly.\nBut the slime circled around me without attacking me or running away. Not only that, it kept bouncing its body in one direction.\nThis strange behavior seems to be trying to tell me something.\n\u201cUh \u2026 do you want me to follow you?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu.\u201d\nThe slime replied. It kept bouncing in front of me.\nCan I follow it?\nIf I follow it, it will probably say \u2018Ta-da, you\u2019ve fallen into a trap\u2018 and then maybe slimes will be pouring around me.\nUgh, I think I\u2019ll lose if I fight it.\nI hesitated for a while, but eventually I decided to follow this slime.\nIn any case, I was separated from Ki Yoohyun and I did not know the way. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s any other way around. This slime in front of me is not showing aggression.\nWell, hesitating at times like this doesn\u2019t fit the situation. I\u2019ll follow it and if I think it\u2019s going to be dangerous, I\u2019ll rip the bracelet.\nIt was dark all around, but it wasn\u2019t difficult to follow the slime with a flash of light.\nIt was sunset until a while ago, but suddenly it became dark. It made me realize that this is really a different space. Moreover, the red moon in the sky radiated a magical light.\nBut that bright red moon \u2026 it looks like it\u2019s looking at me.\nEh, it\u2019s probably just my imagination.\nHow can the moon look at me? It doesn\u2019t even have eyes.\nHaha, ha\u2026.\nIt\u2019s just my imagination \u2026 right?\n\u201cKkyuu.\u201d\nAfter walking behind the slime for a while, I heard the sound of running water from somewhere. After about 5 more minutes in the direction of the sound, a small river appeared through the bushes.\nThat\u2019s a relief. I was wondering if I should go back without getting the water.\nI took out the plastic bottle I had put in my inventory and filled it with river water. The water shimmered softly in the plastic bottle.\nTiling!\n[Item: Ethereal Water (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)Water rich in ether. It helps the growth of plants.]\nThe name that appeared in the system window was also clearly ethereal water.\nI filled up one extra water bottle and put it in the inventory. Heavy plastic bottles are safe to carry because I have inventory.\nIt must have been quite heavy to walk with this plastic bottle in hand. It\u2019s good to be awakened like this.\nGreat. The purpose has been achieved. Now, let\u2019s tear the bracelet and call someone.\nThere was no way to find Ki Yoohyun in this wide dungeon, and my legs started to hurt.\n\u201cKkyuu, kkyuu.\u201d\nHowever, the slime kept bouncing around me and squealing.\n\u201c\u2026Eung? What?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuuuu!\u201d\nIt would be nice to have an interpreter artifact that translates slime words. I felt stuffy because all I could hear was \u201cKyuuuu\u201c.\nHowever, the appearance of slime was quite desperate to ignore.\nWhy, isn\u2019t there a story like this?\nThe dog \u200b\u200bsuddenly dug in the ground with its front paw, and when I dug the spot with a shovel, I found a lost item. The dog barked and was noisy in the middle of the night, so I came out and found out that the house was on fire.\nI tend to believe such a story. When an animal tries to tell you something, you should never ignore it.\nI don\u2019t know if this slime can be considered an animal, but\u2026.\nPerhaps feeling frustrated because it couldn\u2019t communicate, the slime turned toward the bushes and circled around one point. There was some kind of long grass growing there.\n\u201cAre you talking about this grass?\u201d\n\u201cKkyuu.\u201d\nThe slime bounced its body. It looks like I got it right.\nOn the surface, it\u2019s just plain grass, and it looks a little bit like rice plant\u2026.\nAs soon as I touched the leaf with my hand, a familiar alarm rang.\n[The condition has been met.][Skill: The Barista\u2019s Eyes (D) has been acquired.]\n[The Barista\u2019s Eyes (D)Details: (Lv.1) You can find the ingredients.]\nSuddenly, I have a new skill.\nWoah, looking at the description, that\u2019s a pretty good skill. As expected, it was good to listen to the animal (?).\nThere is a grass pointed at by the slime right in front of me, so let\u2019s try the skill.\n\u2018The Barista\u2019s Eyes.\u2019\nImmediately, item information appeared in front of me.\n[Item: Dungeon Sugar Cane (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)Type: PlantA grass commonly found in dungeons. The sap of the stem tastes sweet.Note: Ingredients for magic sugar.]\n[\u2018Dungeon Sugarcane\u2018 has been added to the Ether-Wiki.]\nThe word \u2018sugar\u2019 caught my eye at once in the notification window. With \u2018magic\u2019 in front of it, it must not be ordinary sugar. Maybe it will give some effect like the coffee mix\u2026.\n\u2018Can I take it?\u2019\nI think it would be useful if I could make sugar. Once I take it, I\u2019ll figure out how to do it later.\nI gently scooped the dungeon sugarcane with a shovel and put it in my inventory. It\u2019s a crappy weapon with 2 attack power, but it was all useful in this case. Since it\u2019s actually a seedling shovel, it\u2019s perfect for digging soil.\nI was crouching down in the dark and digging up dungeon sugarcane. Because I was so focused on my work, I didn\u2019t even notice that something was approaching.\nTuk.\n\u201cAaah!\u201d\n\u201cRieul-ssi, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cHuk, ah, yes!\u201d\nWhen I turned my head, there was Ki Yoohyun with a worried look.\nAh, I was surprised. I thought something had appeared.\nI was embarrassed to scream for nothing. I shook my knees and got up.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t see you at the drop point, so I went looking for you. Did you get hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I rolled down, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nEven though I said it was okay, Ki Yoohyun looked at me with his deer-like eyes.\nUgh, the guilt was no joke when I received the concerned gaze of the handsome man. I was a little sorry that I made him worry for nothing because I was chasing after a slime.\n\u201cThen shall we go?\u201d\n\u201cYes, wait a minute \u2026 eh.\u201d\nUh, where did that red slime go?\nI wanted to thank it because I got my new skill. Maybe it ran away in surprise when it saw Ki Yoohyun. No matter how much I looked at the bushes, I could not see the shiny round body.\n\u2018I wish we could meet again.\u2019\nI left the bushes behind with a slight regret.\nAfter that, I was able to go around the dungeon without much trouble.\nSlimes appeared a few times, but Ki Yoohyun melted them all, and I only need to eat the experience points. It felt like I was playing a game with auto-battle turned because the slimes have already been melted even before it came into view.\nAfter walking along the road for a while, I saw the exit.\nThe exit was in the form of a disk that leaked blue light, similar to the entrance. You\u2019ll be able to exit the dungeon if you get on that disk.\nI have achieved my goal, and now I hurried to the exit with a desire to go home quickly.\nThen I heard the rumbling sound of the ground behind me.\nNo way, it can\u2019t be\u2026.\nI believe it won\u2019t be such a cliche development that a boss monster appears and the party falls into crisis when it\u2019s just around the corner of the exit. Maybe it\u2019s just that the ground is shaking a little\u2026.?\n[Boss Monster: An Iridescent Giant Slime (???) has appeared.]\nGee, the system notification shattered my hopes.\nAlmost at the same time as the notification window, a slime appeared on the far side of the bushes.\nMaybe because it\u2019s a boss monster, the slime that appeared this time was rainbow-colored and huge. The translucent jelly-shaped body shining in its colorful brilliance was quite intimidating, it looked incredibly strong.\nIt seems that Ki Yoohyun is stronger than I thought, but \u2026 is it possible to kill that slime too? I thought it would be unreasonable to face the boss alone.\nIt\u2019s not even just Hard. It\u2019s a Special. Special. I am not good at English, but I know what special means.\nFortunately, the giant slime was still far away, and the exit was close.\nI looked up at Ki Yoohyun, who was standing next to me. Perhaps Ki Yoohyun was also thinking the same thing as me, as he smiled with a refreshing expression.\nWe spoke almost simultaneously.\n\u201cShall we run?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s run.\u201d\nNo matter who came first, we started running towards the exit. I was out of breath because I usually didn\u2019t exercise.\n\u201cHuuh, Huu\u2026.\u201d\nI think I\u2019ll be there soon\u2026.\nNo, what slime is that fast? Is it a rubber ball?\nA rainbow-colored slime was approaching quickly, bouncing its body. I couldn\u2019t have imagined that such a large body could be bounced like a rubber ball.\nThe slime was getting closer and closer, there was no time for me to admire it. I ran as fast as I could, looking ahead.\nThis is the first time I have run like this since my high school physical education exam. And then\u2026.\n\u2018It was so hard, I drank milk and vomited\u2026.\u2019\nHeugh, I almost saw the phantasmagoria. No, now is not the time to think about that.\nThe moment our feet barely touched the disc, the slime caught up with us.\nAs I shrank in anticipation of the ensuing attack, a net of light unfolded and covered the slime.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nDear MC, you\u2019re making a S-class hunter ran away from a slime\u2026.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

It was a rather unusual party composition.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep dragging your feet, we\u2019ll go first.\u201d\n\nEven though we didn\u2019t answer, the peacock squeezed in. The public official pushed him away, denied his interruption, but he was stubborn.\nEh, let\u2019s just avoid him.\nThe public official seemed in trouble, so I just told him to send the peacock first. The official bowed to me and checked the papers with a tired look.\n\u201cYes, I will check the entry of the Supreme Party.\u201d\nA familiar word came into my ears.\nAn old-fashioned name that might have been used about 10 years ago. I think I\u2019ve heard such stupid words lately. Where was it\u2026.\n\u201cHuahahaha! I don\u2019t need explanations like that. Just trust this supreme leader, we\u2019ll clear the tutorial in no time. Newbies, let\u2019s go quickly.\u201d\nThat\u2019s right, the person nicknamed \u2018Ji-jon\u2018!\nHe is the owner of that bus recruitment post on the Hunter Channel. A vicious hunter who demanded 100 rubies from an F-class.\n\u201cWow, bad luck\u2026.\u201d\nI said while watching Jijon and his party disappearing beyond the dungeon gate.\n\u201cTo be campaigning like that when you\u2019re a C-class, your head would hit the ceiling when you\u2019re an S-class hunter.\u201d\nHowever, Ki Yoohyun shook his head with an ambiguous expression.\n\u201cUm \u2026 I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s a matter of personal character. S-class is not necessarily arrogant\u2026.\u201d\nIt\u2019s weird. There are less than 10 S-class hunters in Korea, so why is this man desperately making excuses?\nAnyway, it\u2019s our turn again.\nThe dungeon entry process was very simple. Ki Yoohyun and I stood on the disc, and the official operated the gate.\nA blue light covered me, and when I opened my eyes, I was in a field.\nTiling!\n[Welcome to the Great Dungeon AbyssA tutorial is currently in progress.I wish all the best for beginners.]\n[Cthugha rejoices over your visit.]\nUh, what was that just now?\nBut before I could properly check it, the notification disappeared.\nI took my eyes off the system notification and looked around slowly. \nThe first thing that caught my eye was the sky dyed red in the sunset. A gentle breeze swayed through the sparsely growing reeds and shrubs. The remnants of a half-collapsed building could be seen in the distance, but it had an unusual style as if it were somewhere in a foreign country.\nRather than inside the dungeon, it seems that we are in a certain historical site.\n\u201cThis is inside the Abyss?\u201d\nThe sky, the wind, and the sunlight felt real. Only the slightly damp air felt a little odd.\nHowever, unlike me, Ki Yoohyun didn\u2019t look surprised at all. It even seemed like he was familiar to the place as he leisurely looked around and measured the direction.\n\u201cThe Abyss is not a real tower, but a place where the space overlaps.\u00a0It\u2019s not just a single building, but rather it can be said that each of these different spaces are connected. On the other floors, there are the sea and snowy fields.\u201d\n\u201cWow \u2026 have you been there?\u201d\n\u201cNo. That \u2026 I heard about it. From someone who has been there.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun was embarrassed and corrected it. He knew it in detail, so I thought he\u2019d been there before.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cEach party would have fallen to a different place. The starting point and the goal point are different for each person, so you won\u2019t have to run into each other. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun began to walk in one direction. I asked, hurriedly following him.\n\u201cUh, do you know the way?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 It\u2019s just a feeling.\u201d\nIndeed, there is no map or anything, so we have no choice but to go somewhere.\nBy the way, it was an unbelievable scenery in the dungeon. The reeds and trees all look real. There was no time to feel bored as I looked around with a curious mind.\nAfter walking in the field for about ten minutes, a green lump that looked like a jelly appeared in front of me. At the same time, the system alarm rang.\n[Green Slime (F) for Beginners has appeared.]\nSlime is different from the cave black bear that attacked the store recently. It had no sharp teeth or claws, and its translucent and smooth body trembled softly.\nIn short, it looks cute.\n\u201cKyuuu\u2026.\u201d\nEven the sound of slime is cute. It was the moment when I subconsciously took a step closer to take a closer look,\nThe slime\u2019s round body spread like a membrane in an instant and tried to attack me.\n\u201cUwah!\u201d\nI stepped back in surprise, and there was a flash of light. When I opened my eyes, the slime had melted away.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nWhat was it just now? He didn\u2019t cast spells for magic skills, and he didn\u2019t even show hand gestures for offensive skills.\n[Party Member: Ki Yoohyun has defeated the Green Slime for Beginners (F).][You have gained 10 EXP.]\nOnly the notification window that appeared in front of me with a ring sound, informed me that Ki Yoohyun had just killed it.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay \u2026 Did Yoohyun-ssi kill it?\u201d\nI asked Ki Yoohyun with a suspicious look.\nI had thought about it a while ago, but after entering the dungeon, my suspicions grew stronger.\nThis person \u2026 is he strong?\nWith a relaxed attitude, he was melting the slime in an instant.\nIt was a suspicious situation, but Ki Yoohyun answered with a shy expression, saying that he was also surprised.\n\u201cHahaha \u2026 because it is for beginners, the difficulty must have been set to easy.\u201d\nDoes he not know that he\u2019s strong yet? A breathless power that I\u2019ve only heard of? Or is this actually a haha bus?\nDid I enter the world of \u201cI am too strong as a rookie hunter\u201d without realizing it? Was he actually a possessed person?\nEither way\u2026.\n\u2018I have to stay close to him.\u2019\nIf Ki Yoohyun becomes famous in the future, I\u2019ll post something like, \u201cI cleared the the tutorial dungeon with Ki Yoohyun\u201c. I will put a sign on the store saying \u201cIt\u2019s the coffee that Ki Yoohyun drank\u201d and sell coffee for hundreds of thousands of won. \n\u2018Hehehe.\u2019\n\u201cRieul-ssi.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun spoke to me, who fell into a snobbish thought for a moment.\n\u201cAh, yes, yes?!\u201d\n\u201cBe careful. Slime is not such a dangerous monster, but \u2026 it\u2019s better not to touch it.\u201d\n\u201cDo they have any poison?\u201d\n\u201cYour skin swells and itches when you touch it.\u201d\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a big deal. I have to be careful.\nColorful slime continued to appear along the way. Ki Yoohyun easily killed various slimes such as green, blue, and yellow slimes. The melted slime was absorbed into the ground and disappeared. \nBecause of that, the system notifications were popping up one after another in front of my eyes.\n[You have gained 10 EXP.]\n[You have gained 10 EXP.]\n[You have gained 10 EXP.]\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nI\u2019m in the state of doing nothing, but still gaining the experience points.\nThis is a bit \u2026 isn\u2019t this such a good benefit?\nAt this rate, I think I can level up without lifting a hand. Is this enough to just enter the dungeon?\nAs I walked while my partner was melting the slime, I came across a fork covered with bushes. Then, I heard the sound of running water nearby.\nHeugh, I was distracted by the free experience and almost forgot my original purpose.\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi, please wait\u2026.\u201d\nThe moment I was going to reveal my original purpose for entering the dungeon\u2026.\n\u201cWuahahaha! The Supreme swordsmanship!\u201d\nThe peacock that appeared from the other side \u2026 no, Jijon swung the sword in his hand.\nBehind him, there were still four beginners with tired faces.\nJijon swept away the slimes around him and shouted in a loud voice.\n\u201cIf you get caught in this supreme swordsmanship, you\u2019ll get one shot! WUAHAHA.\u201d\nOh my gosh, the skill name is also bad\u2026.\nAnd why are you screaming when you use your skill?\nI glanced at Ki Yoohyun.\n\u201cYou said we won\u2019t run into the others.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of luck.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the hunting ground of the supreme leader! The little ones are just getting in the way, so get them out quickly.\u201d\nI had a foreboding that it would be annoying to run into that guy among many hunters. I was about to ignore it and slowly move forward, but \u2026 something happened.\nKuuuung, Kuuuung.\nMy body trembled at the suddent vibrations of the ground. What, did an earthquake happen?\nKi Yoohyun also looked surprised at this unexpected situation.\nSoon, a system notification window appeared in front of me.\n[Warning!Tutorial dungeon is a special dungeon designed to help beginners grow.Please use the dungeon with a difficulty level that suits you.]\n[The difficulty of the tutorial dungeon changes due to the appearance of a strong player.Tutorial Dungeon\u2015Special Hard mode starts.Defeat stronger monsters and get more experience.]\nWhat the hell does this mean?\nAs I read the notification window in disbelief, I heard laughter next to me.\n\u201cO\u2019my my \u2026 wuahahaha!\u201d\nIt was Jijon.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this. I was just trying to help you beginners \u2026 but it looks like I\u2019m too strong to come in here. The difficulty of the dungeon went up because of me, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think so.\nI don\u2019t know exactly what the situation is, but I have a strong feeling that it wasn\u2019t him.\nAt that moment, the sun in the western sky disappeared and darkness descended as if time was fast-forwarding.\nAnd as the red moon in the middle of the sky emitted an ominous light, it was obvious that an unusual change had occurred.\nThump, Thump, Thump-.\nThe moment when the regular pounding of the ground stopped\u2026.\n[Dungeon difficulty increased. A Giant Slime for Experts (???) has appeared.]\nThe giant slime came toward us, bouncing its whole body.\nThe body, which appeared from the bushes, seemed to be over 5 meters tall. The body glowed fluorescent green in the dark. I think it\u2019ll be real bad my your skin if I touch it.\nJijon stepped forward to bite back at the bizarre sight.\n\u201cHuahaha! Don\u2019t worry. Even if it\u2019s a giant, it\u2019s still a slime. This supreme leader will be able to get rid of it.\u201d\nOh, he was pretty cool now.\n\u201cHiyaaah \u2026. Supreme Swordsmanship!\u201d\nJijon swung the sword in his hand.\nHowever, the giant slime bounced the sword lightly. The wind blew the sword out of his hand.\nStill, Jijon did not give in.\n\u201cEugh \u2026 It\u2019s pretty solid. But I still have this skill. Ultimate \u2026 The Supreme Iron Fang!\u201d\nThe moment he shouted \u201cHiyaaah\u201d a tremendous amount of power was condensed into the his fist. Jijon jumped sharply and swung his fist towards the giant slime.\nTung-.\nHowever, Jijon\u2019s fist could not penetrate the smooth body of the giant slime.\nJijon\u2019s body, which bounced off with a bang, rolled on the floor.\n\u201c\u2026.Ugh.\u201d\nJijon, who got up with a moan, glared at the giant slime with a determined expression.\nThen, he ran away.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nIt was so fast. I soon couldn\u2019t see his back.\n\u201cLeader \u2026 wait, let\u2019s go together!\u201d\nWhen Jijon, the leader of the party, ran away, a group of bewildered beginners followed him.\nIn an instant, only Ki Yoohyun, the giant slime, and I were left here.\nThe giant slime bounced off its body with a flash of light.\n\u2026. it seems to say that it\u2019s our turn next.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI think I forgot to mention it before, Jijon (\uc9c0\uc874) means supreme / the best. It is out-dated expression. It comes from Chinese character (\u81f3\u5c0a) and was used as an honorific title for a king in the past. Well, you probably still see it being used in martial arts novel.

            "c18": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThis time, Ki Yoohyun dressed in an inconspicuous outfit, an ordinary coat without a guild mark. Furthermore, he was alone.\nA doubt flashed across my mind when I saw the outfit.\nIs he slacking off again?\n\u201cAre you slacking off again?\u201d\n\nOh, the thought just came out of my mouth.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s sort of like that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better go somewhere else. They told me to leave because the VVIP is coming.\u201d\nOver Ki Yoohyun\u2019s shoulder, I could see the Hunter Market\u2019s staff was looking this way.\nDespite his restless attitude, he did not approach this way easily. It\u2019s a completely different attitude from the overbearing appearance earlier. What\u2019s wrong with him?\nWell, it\u2019s none of my business. I looked away from them.\n\u201c\u2026Take care.\u201d\nI hope you slack off safely.\nI nodded and tried to step aside, but Ki Yoohyun blocked my way.\nI turned to the other side. However, Ki Yoohyun also followed me to the other side.\n\u201cDo you have anything to say to me?\u201d\n\u201cYou bought a good item.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAre you talking about this shovel and miscellaneous item set?\nHowever, what Ki Yoohyun pointed to with his finger was the ring I just received from the old lady.\n\u201cDo you want me to tell you a secret?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.I don\u2019t.\u201d\nI don\u2019t remember having a relationship that close enough to share secrets with this man. Moreover, I had a foreboding that it would be troublesome to hear the word \u2018secret\u2018 all of sudden.\nI\u2019m not going to tell you my secret, and I\u2019m not curious about your secret, so I hope you go on your way.\nHowever, Ki Yoohyun continued to speak at his own will. I guess he\u2019s not good at listening to people.\n\u201cThe VVIP, the one scheduled to visit today, is Hunter Kim Deokyi, an A-class craftsman. It\u2019s the first time in ten years since she went into hiding for skill training. In order to buy the items from the craftsman master that finally will appear on the market for the first time in a long time, there is a fierce battle under each guild\u2019s purchasing department. The master\u2019s items are worth calling.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Hee.\u201d\n\u201cI came here because I heard that the craftsman master is visiting today, but it\u2019s already too late.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun dropped his shoulders slightly as if he was regretting it.\nIt\u2019s already late, I guess he came while I was arguing at the consignment shop.\n\u201cOh, one more. There is a rumor that the item that the master craftsman released this time is the only one. It is a unique item that can\u2019t be found again in the world.\u201d\nIt was an interesting story, but that was it.\nIt was an item that a craftsman who had disappeared for 10 years made for the first time in a long time, so I also wanted to take a look at it at least once.\nStill, if it is that rare, it would be sold at a price that I can\u2019t even dream of with 50 rubies, so somehow it felt like it was a story of a different world. The day will not come when I can look at the craftsman\u2019s items.\nI have finished my business, so I decided to leave Hunter Market and go back to the store.\nBut Ki Yoohyun kept following me. He was walking five steps behind me, but I couldn\u2019t pretend that I didn\u2019t know it.\nI sighed and looked back.\n\u201cWhy do you keep following me?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Ah.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun\u2019s eyes widened.\nDid you think that I wouldn\u2019t know after following me so clearly? It was amazing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any strange intention. So \u2026 I also have business to do at the dungeon gate\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAh, is that so\u2026.\u201d\nWhen I turned around and started walking again, Ki Yoohyun followed me closely and talked to me.\n\u201cBy the way, Rieul-ssi, you\u2019re awakened.\u201d\nOnly registered Awakened person could enter the Hunter Market. I pondered for a moment and answered half-heartedly.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s something like that.\u201d\n\u201cThen are you participating in the tutorial dungeon?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d\nTo be honest, I was only thinking of getting the water, but I nodded my head.\nKi Yoohyun continued to talk, regardless of my dry attitude.\n\u201cI am about to participate in the tutorial dungeon too, can I go with you?\u201d\nBefore I knew it, I came up to the side and looked at Ki Yoohyun who was standing there.\nWith his big eyes, his tall body looks weak.\nThe cold Hunter Channel\u2019s party recruiting posts came to mind. Was this man also rejected several times while trying to find a party?\n\u201cYoohyun-ssi is a member of the Cheongna Guild. Don\u2019t you have anyone in the guild to go with you?\u201d\n\u201cAhahaha \u2026 Everyone said no because they\u2019re busy.\u201d\nThey\u2019re cold-hearted, too.\nUsually, the same guild members organize a party, but no matter how weak Ki Yoohyun seems, it\u2019s too much that they don\u2019t\u00a0even organize a party for him. The Big Three guilds are great, but they are too cold-hearted to its guild members.\nExcept for the fact that I was an Awakened, I didn\u2019t tell this man anything about my class or job. This man seemed desperate enough to even hold onto someone like me.\n\u201cTherefore \u2026 If Rieul-ssi is okay with it, I want to have a party with you.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a non-combatant, so I won\u2019t be much help.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. As long as you come with me.\u201d\n\u201cI might get in the way.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun persuaded me by saying that he\u2019ll do his best to help me.\nListening to his story, apparently he applied for a two-person party, but the hunter who was originally going to go with him broke his promise.\n\u201cYou can cancel it and apply again.\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 Haha, the fees are outrageous\u2026.\u201d\nOh, my\u2026.\nFaced with Ki Yoohyun\u2019s pleading eyes, I unknowingly nodded my head.\nHe\u2019s a little suspicious, but\u2026.\nSince I couldn\u2019t buy the stealth cloak I wanted, I\u2019m in a difficult situation too, so I thought it would be nice to have a party member.\n\u201cWell \u2026 Let\u2019s go together, then.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Thank you!\u201d\nKi Yoohyun smiled brightly. He looked genuinely happy.\n\u201cAnd I have one more request.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to drink the coffee you gave me before one more time. It was really delicious.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all gone.\u201d\nI guess he wasn\u2019t lying about the coffee tasted delicious, Ki Yoohyun was noticeably disappointed.\nStill, now I\u2019m thinking of making an Americano.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make a new coffee instead, so I\u2019ll let you drink it then.\u201d\n***\nThe next day, my eyes opened wide before the alarm went off. I went to bed early yesterday, but I was restless.\nIt felt like a waste of time, so I dug into the blanket again, but once I woke up, my mind was filled with nothing but fuss.\nEventually, I decided to just get up early. I came down to the first floor after taking care of the sound of footsteps so that Mieum, who was sleeping by the bed, did not wake up.\nThe appearance of  Abyss could be seen through the large window on the first floor. The dungeon that soared endlessly toward the sky boasted an overwhelming majesty.\nHow many floors are there?\nEven now, several guilds are conducting raids for item farming or training, but the identity of that dungeon remains unknown.\nThere are many speculations that there are very strong monsters up there, that you can become a God if you finish the last floor, or that it will lead to another world.\nToday, I am going over there. Once again, I felt a little nervous.\nI quickly took a shower and changed my clothes. I still have plenty of time until the time I agreed to meet with Ki Yoohyun, but there was work to be done before departure.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d\nAbout two hours later, Mieum woke up and asked as she came down the stairs.\n\u201cWaeeooong, it smells strange.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a strange smell, it\u2019s the smell of sesame oil.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does it smell like sesame oil!\u201d\nPerhaps because she hated the savory smell, Mieum raised her fur upright and groaned.\nI didn\u2019t pay her any attention because was absorbed in what I was doing. I wrapped the gimbap.\n\u201cUgh, it exploded. What should I do?\u201d\nThe waist of the gimbap burst because too much filling was added. I have no choice but to eat this for breakfast.\nI laid the seaweed again, put the rice on top, and put the filling ingredients inside. This time, I was able to cut gimbap in just the right size. I lined up the line in the lunch box and packed the gimbap.\n\u201cMieum-ah, would you like to eat gimbap too?\u201d\n\u201cWaeoong\u2026.\u201d\nMy eyes stung. Mieum looked at me in amazement.\nHowever, although there are individual differences, the tutorial dungeon takes half a day. Even if I come back as soon as possible, it must already be afternoon.\nThat\u2019s why I need a lunch box, and if it\u2019s a packed box, gimbap is the national rule.\nAfter filling my stomach with the bursting kimbap, it was time to leave. I poured a generous amount of cereal into Mieum\u2019s bowl and packed my bag.\nThere was nothing special about it. The inventory contains a 1-liter water bottle for the ethereal water and a set of low-grade items purchased from Hunter Market.\nI don\u2019t know if it will help, but I also brought the seedling shovel and wore the low-grade windshield for beginner. Even having a defense of 2 would be better than nothing.\nFinally, after packing the gimbap, I felt a little excited because it felt like I will go on a picnic.\n\u201cThen, Mieum-ah, take good care of the house.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Meow.\u201d\nMieum, who was eating her breakfast with her head stuck in a bowl, nodded and greeted me. I locked the door and set out for the dungeon.\nAfter walking for about three minutes, I arrived at the dungeon gate of Abyss.\nIt\u2019s just around the corner, but this is the first time I\u2019m at the Dungeon Gate. It\u2019s not a tourist destination, so there was no reason to come.\nIn front of a large tower-shaped dungeon, there was a disk that sparkled with blue light.\nUnlike usual, the area was crowded with rookie hunters trying to enter the tutorial dungeon.\nWe were supposed to meet here\u2026.\nI wandered around the Dungeon Gate trying to find Ki Yoohyun. If I knew this would happen, I would have asked for his contact information.\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s him!\u201d\nFortunately, I was able to find Ki Yoohyun without difficulty because he\u2019s taller than the others.\nWhen I shouted out loud, Ki Yoohyun also found me immediately and came closer.\n\u201cRieul-ssi, hello.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun was dressed in a simple outfit with a black coat on the outside. It was in contrast to the fact that the hunters around us were equipped with full-fledged equipment.\u00a0Among his neat clothes, only the silver watch, the only accessory, stood out.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any other weapons?\u201d\n\u201cAhaha \u2026 the weapon I usually use is currently in a broken state.\u201d\nI\u2019m nervous\u2026.\nWell, since it\u2019s a tutorial, it\u2019ll be fine.\n[You have a party.Party Member: Kwon Rieul, Ki YoohyunEXP distribution method: Equal distribution.]\nThe moment I received the party scroll that Ki Yoohyun gave me, a system notification popped up in front of my eyes. It was written that if you kill a monster while forming a party, the experience points are distributed to both.\n\u201cThen shall we go?\u201d\nWe had no reason to stay long at the entrance. Ki Yoohyun and I immediately lined up in front of the dungeon gate. Fortunately, the line got shorter and it was our turn.\n\u201cKwon Rieul and Ki Yoohyun, it\u2019s your party, right?\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s your tutorial bracelet.\u201d\nA public official guarding the dungeon gate put a paper bracelet on my arm. It looks like a wristband usually used for entering a concert hall.\n\u201cIf you tear this bracelet in a crisis, the Hunter who was waiting inside the dungeon will come to help you. If you think it\u2019s dangerous, use it right away.\u201d\nThe public official continued his explanation with a tired expression.\nThe tutorial dungeon is a quest dungeon for training rookie hunters, and the difficulty of the monsters inside is adjusted according to the hunter\u2019s abilities. In this way, it is unlikely that anything dangerous will happen, but in case of an emergency, you should always ask for help.\nAs the explanations on how to find a way inside and how to clear the dungeon were almost finished, a loud noise was heard from behind.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up. I\u2019m going to burst and die if I need to wait a little longer. Such explanations are not something that even newbies want to hear.\u201d\nWhen I turned around, a Hunter in a splendid outfit was standing in a crooked posture.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI\u2019m worried for the MC \u2026 what if she meet a good-looking scammer smh T__T\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c17": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nI was thinking of buying a cloak with stealth effect for 50 rubies.\nThis is because, of course, I have no intention to fight the monsters with only a paper-like F-class body. At the most, it was a waste of the ruby \u200b\u200bI earned, but after completing the quest, I can resell the item.\nI couldn\u2019t bring Mieum because I didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s allowed to bring my cat to Hunter Market, and there was also no carrier for transportation.\nThe unfamiliar Hunter Market . I was a little anxious because there was no talking cat next to me.\n\nNo, there is no room for weak thoughts.\nI made up my mind and entered the entrance on the first floor of Hunter Market.\n\u201cWelcome. How may I help you?\u201d\nCompared to the shiny exterior, the inside was more customer-friendly than I expected. However, the lobby was empty, probably because it\u2019s during the time when there were few customers. The staff near the entrance greeted me with a friendly smile and a bright voice.\n\u201cUh,  I\u2019d like to buy some equipment. Where should I go?\u201d\n\u201cIs this your first visit? Then, please fill out this registration card first. Oh, you can sit on that sofa over there and fill it out comfortably. Do you need to borrow your pen?\u201d\nBut the kindness ended as soon as I submitted my registration card.\nThe eyes of the staff stayed on the Hunter\u2019s grade column of the registration card for a long time, and in the next moment, the face of the staff was colder than ice and frostier than winter.\n\u201cEx \u2026 excuse me?\u201d\n\u201cThe VVIP is scheduled to visit today, so all the staff are busy. You have to wait a little bit.\u201d\nThen the staff pointed to the farmost room. Are you telling me to go over there?\n\u201cThere are things that are right for you.\u201d\nThe staff left me behind and went into the staff room behind me. I called, but she doesn\u2019t even look back.\nThat\u2019s right. Among Hunters, they treated grades like a gangster. The winner has a monopoly. In other words, the strongest is the best.\nYes, I am patient person with good humanity who entered the inhuman world of the Hunter world. I will endure it. Since I don\u2019t have anything urgent to do, I decided to pass the time by looking at the items.\nI headed towards the far end of the room pointed to by the staff.\nI was wondering if it was a small room, but the room was quite spacious and decorated with a sophisticated interior. Again, no one else was visible except me, and various equipment and items were displayed in a glass showcase with a security device.\n\u201cUmh, the price\u2026.\u201d\nJudging from the attitude of the staff, it must have been the area where the lowest-grade items were collected, but all of them were exorbitantly priced.\nThe cheapest items such as a shirt that increases defense by 10 and a ring that increases dodge rate by 10% also started with 100 rubies. I was a little worried about whether it would be possible to buy the stealth cloak that I wanted for 50 rubies in here.\n\u201cUmh\u2026.\u201d\nI looked at all the items in the showcase, but the staff showed no sign of returning. No matter what they said about VVIP or something, it\u2019s a bit harsh. How long do I have to wait?\nThen, a commotion was heard from the other side of the hallway.\nWhen I poked my head out of the door and looked around, the Hunter Market\u2019s staff was yelling at someone. Their voice was so loud that it could be heard by everyone on the other side.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\nThe sound was coming from the consignment shop area.\nA consignment shop refers to a shop where hunters in the production field sell items directly after paying a certain fee to the Hunter Market. They mainly sold miscellaneous items that were made to train their crafting skills, but most of them were not good enough to be officially sold at Hunter Market.\nHowever, even if it is a miscellaneous item, it is helpful enough for low-grade hunters. Above all, the price was cheap, so it was a favorite area for poor hunters.\nI also tried to buy a cloak at the consignment shop at first. However, the consignment shop area was empty due to an interior repair.\nNo, now that I see it, there was only one consignment shop in the far corner.\nA loud noise was heard there.\n\u2018Is there a fight?\u2019\nThe staff showed no sign of coming here, and I was curious because of boredom. I approached them with the intention of seeing what happened.\n\u201cI have already told you not to open business here.\u201d\nIt was such a loud voice that it hurt my ears.\nA Hunter Market staff shouted at the consignment shop in the corner. The owner of the shop was a wrinkled old lady. The old lady shrugged her shoulders under the pressure of the staff.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the order to empty the shop because a VVIP is scheduled to visit today? Please clean it up quickly.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2026 here\u2019s the consignment shop permit \u2026 I\u2019m properly authorized.\u201d\nThe old lady unzipped the bag at her waist and took out a crumpled permit. It was definitely an official permit with the seal of Hunter Market.\nHowever, the staff did not blink an eye when he saw the permit.\n\u201cWe will refund the price of the permit. If you don\u2019t clean it up quickly, I\u2019ll call the guards.\u201d\nThe old lady flinched at the staff\u2019s stiff attitude. She was intimidated on her own, the large staff standing in front of the skinny and short old lady.\nIt was a pitiful appearance that awakened the Confucian girl inside me, but the staff was tough.\n\u201cB-but it\u2019s an useful item for the tutorial dungeon \u2026  I have to sell it before the tutorial dungeon, but if you tell me to leave now\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHaha, what did you say?\u201d\nThe staff laughed out loud.\n\u201cVVIP is coming. Who do you think would buy such a sloppy item? Do you think they will give you any attention? Guard!\u201d\nThe staff beckoned the guards of Hunter Marker. It seemed as if the approaching guards would push and drag that weak-looking old lady at any moment.\n\u201cWait, wait a minute!\u201d\nWithout realizing it, I shouted and interrupted.\nBecause the old lady in the consignment shop reminded me of my late grandmother.\nNo, if it were my grandmother\u2026.\n\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Open your eyes and see. Here, can\u2019t you see it has the word  \u2018Business Permit\u2019? I\u2019ve already paid for it, but you want me to leave? It looks ridiculous because it\u2019s old lady\u2019s money. I\u2019ll take care of it whether it\u2019s sold or not, so don\u2019t worry. What\u2019s wrong with me lying down in my shop? Go out!\u201d\n\u2026 she would have said that. She wasn\u2019t the type to lose anywhere.\nAnyway.\n\u201cSir, why are you like this?\u201d\nFirst of all, the way I spoke was polite, but my eyes were full of curse.\n\u2018It was that F-class from earlier. Ha, it\u2019s crazy today. A wanderer will quietly watch and then go home.\u2018\nIt seems like the staff would say that. I continued without giving in.\n\u201cI was going to buy it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cGrandma, how much is the item?\u201d\nI glanced at the bundles of items placed on the shelves of the consignment shop. It caught my eye that the price tag said \u2018all for 50 rubies\u2018.\nThank God. I did my best. I didn\u2019t have to step back because I didn\u2019t have enough money. People have pride.\nI took out 50 rubies from the inventory and placed them on the shelf.\n\u201cHere\u2019s 50 rubies.\u201d\n\u201cOh, student, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I was just in need of that item. Hurry up and take it. You don\u2019t have to stay in a place where they kick people out at their own will.\u201d\nThen I took the set of items handed to me by the old lady and turned around.\nI strode out of the Hunter Market, bumping the shoulders of the staffs and guards. I didn\u2019t look back at all, as if I would never come back to a store that ignores customers like this.\nAfter 20 steps like that, I crouched down on the floor and pulled my hair out.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nI did it.\nI didn\u2019t mean to buy this\u2026.\nI was just going to get some water from the dungeon, so I was just going to buy an inexpensive cloak\u2026.\nI checked the item set that I received without looking properly.\n[Low-Grade Windshield for Beginner (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)Type: ArmorDefense: 2Note: It is good to wear during the changing season.]\n[Low-Grade Shovel for Beginner (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)Type: WeaponAttack: 2Note: Useful for digging. Farmer\u2019s friend.]\n[Low-Grade Item Set for Beginner (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606)Type: ConsumablesIncluding bandages, bands, flares, smoke bombs, herbs.]\n\u2026.\nNo, that\u2019s not it. Let\u2019s not regret it.\nAlthough it is completely different from the item I was going to buy, I used 50 rubies and returned to square one, but the Confucian girl inside me shouted. This is the right way!\nYou don\u2019t do that to a grandma. Ha.\nI was about to go back after finishing my mind, but the old lady called me from behind.\n\u201cStudent, wait a minute.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nThe grandmother I saw up close had a slightly different impression than before.\nI thought she looked fragile earlier, because her face was wrinkled and her hair was white, but somehow I felt an atmosphere that was not easily approachable.\nThere was a kind smile on her lips, but her eyes were sharp and her posture was flawless.\n\u201cI forgot this.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nIt was a ring that the old lady gave out. A red stone was embedded in the monotonous gold ring.\n\u201cTake it. I\u2019m selling this too, but I forgot to give it to you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to give it to me\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThis ring should be in the hands of the right person. It looks like the student suits it.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes\u2026.\u201d\nI received the ring on surprise.\nWhat is this?\nAt first glance, it looked like an ordinary ring. Does it have any special abilities? I checked the detail window of the ring.\n[Cthugha\u2019s RingType: AccessoriesEffect: Unusable.]\nHowever, the description of the item was very concise. The name is listed, but the level and ability are unknown. The effect is also unknown and cannot be used.\nIs it a failure of crafting skills?\nStill, I liked the ring shape because it was pretty. As soon as I got it, I put the ring on my hand. At least I should wear it.\n\u201cAs expected, it looks good on you.\u201d\n\u201cUh, thank you \u2026 Grandma?\u201d\nI was about to say goodbye, but the old lady had already left first.\nWhen I saw her back, I remembered my grandmother again, and my anger soared at the tyranny of Hunter Market.\nYeah, well done.\nThis is not the time to be discouraged by this accident. Now that the situation became like this, I\u2019ll make an Americano and earn 100 rubies.\nI don\u2019t know who the hell the VVIP is, but we\u2019ll see.\nI couldn\u2019t see straight ahead because I was burning up my motivation. As I was about to leave , I bumped into a person who was coming in front of me.\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019m sorry \u2026 huh?\u201d\nTall, deep dark eyes covered with thick rimmed glasses, and a shiny face.\nIt was someone I had met.\nRight, it\u2019s the master of slacking off.\nKi Yoohyun, who made eye contact with me, smiled brightly. He looked even more handsome when he smiled with his handsome face.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here again.\u201d\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nConfucian girl (\uc720\uad50 \uac78 / yu gyeo geol): a conservative (polite, kid) woman.

Are you working overtime?]\n[Shin Mira: That\u2019s right, right, you said that you resigned. Wow, I\u2019m really envious \u3160\u3160]\n\nIt was KakaoTalk from my high school friend, Shin Mira. Come to think of it, I even told her about the news of my resignation, but I wasn\u2019t able to contact her for a while because I\u2019ve awakened and experienced some crazy things lately.\n\u201cHuman, you have friends.\u201d\nWhat does this cat think of me?\nI like to be lazy, but I still have friends. Although I only reported my survival through KakaoTalk.\nIt\u2019s been a long time since we met because the last time was before my regression.\n[Me: Yep. I really recommend resignation, it\u2019s good for your health]\n[Me: See you when you\u2019re less busy]\n[Shin Mira: OKOK~]\nAfter replying to the Kakaotalk, I washed up and lay on the bed.\nTomorrow, the branch will bear fruit. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to wait long.\nI fell asleep with that thought.\n***\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t grow at all?\u201d\nThe next morning, when I went to check the branch, I was surprised.\nFar from bearing any fruit, the Yggdrasil\u2019s branch had withered more than yesterday. The green leaves even turned yellow at the tips.\nFlutter.\nAh, the leaf fell off.\nIt seems that the rest of the leaves will fall off if they withered a little more.\n\u201cYou said it grows quickly in one night.\u201d\nI protested, but the system\u2019s message was silent.\nYesterday, you put up a notification pretending to be pitiful to the point where my eyes hurt, but are you  pretending not to know anything now?\nInstead, Mieum said in a small voice.\n\u201cThe branch lost a lot of strength while left outdoors. So it seems that ordinary water cannot make the tree grows. Waeoong\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThen what water should I use?\u201d\nThe description in the Ether-Wiki was \u2018fresh water\u2019. Can\u2019t I use tap water? Should I buy Evian and pour it over?\n\u201cYou need water with a high ether concentration.\u201d\n\u201cWhere can I find it?\u201d\nMieum didn\u2019t answer right away and stared at me.\nAh. Now I know what happens when this cat makes a face like this. Obviously, she\u2019s trying to make me do something incredibly cumbersome.\nStop, you don\u2019t have to answer. I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear it.\n\u201cIf you scoop up ethereal water from the dungeon and pour it in, it will survive.\u201d\nI covered my ears.\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear anything.

You can get the water from there.\u201d\nI knew it.\nI feel like I keep getting involved. It was clear that Mieum and the system were working hard to get me into the dungeon.\nI should have noticed it from the moment it kept saying that it was easy and that it would give me a reward.\nThis is it. A story in which the main character of an RPG game who was only going to run an errand in a neighboring town, eventually gets caught up in a troublesome task and fights the Demon King.\nYeah, I don\u2019t want it. If the system is an RPG game, my role is like the innkeeper of the starter village who sees off the main character.\nI was just trying to water the branch. I refused to play the story of entering the dungeon after getting caught up in troublesome work.\n\u201cI really can\u2019t hear it. Ahaha, Mieum, I can\u2019t hear you at all.\u201d\n\u201cMeooong!\u201d\nMieum jumped up with her back feet and threw a meow punch. The cat\u2019s forefoot attack is quite painful.\n\u2018I\u2019m going to put her in the bath soon.\u2019\nI vowed revenge in my heart.\n\u201cWaeoong! You look like you\u2019re up to something!\u201d\nLike a ghost, she noticed my thoughts, and Mieum jumped up and rushed to my lap. The movement of jumping, which did not go well with her heavy figure, was quick. As I staggered at the heavy attack, the hand that covered my ear fell off.\nTiling, Tiling.\nThen a clear sound effect pierced my ears. The system, which had been silent until now, opened a notification window.\n[A quest has occurred]\nI don\u2019t fall for this trick anymore.\nThis innkeeper is busy today because she has to go exchange the 5 million won.

I\u2019m not doing it.\n***\nThe intersection in front of Exit 2 of the bustling Apgujeong Hunter Market Station.\nIn Seoul, where land is famous for being expensive, I saw a flashing sign of the Hunter Market Apgujeong branch. The large exterior of the building and the sophisticated interior seemed to be shouting, \u2018go away, foolish rookie\u2019.\nIn the afternoon, I came to this Hunter Market as scheduled.\nHowever, only the destination is the same. The today\u2019s purpose is completely different. It was not to exchange 5 million won, but to purchase items to enter the dungeon.\n\u201cHa\u2026.\u201d\nI really had no intention of doing the quest.\nIt\u2019s true that there wasn\u2019t\u2026.\nThe problem is I\u2019m weak-minded person.\nThe branch withered as if it was going to die at any moment, and I felt like I had to finish the quest once I started it.\nThey even give me tickets for the golden draw.\nIt\u2019s not that I fell for the golden ticket.\nI just felt sorry for the dying branches. It sounds unconvincing, but it\u2019s true.\nOf course, I had no intention of jumping into the dungeon recklessly, and initially made my own plan.\nIt is said that ethereal water can be collected from the river on the first floor of Abyss, where the tutorial dungeon will be held.\nSo, wouldn\u2019t it be okay if I had a party with the Hunter participating in the tutorial and just went in to fetch the water? Or I can pay them money and ask them to bring me some water.\nWith that in mind, I entered the party matching service on the tutorial dungeon application site.\nIt was an intermediary site for hunters who wanted to join a party. Wizards, healers, assistants, and others who had difficulty clearing dungeons by themselves used this to form parties and participate.\nAfter skipping all the long explanations, I entered my personal information in the application box, but an error appeared with a beep.\n\u201cHuh?

            "c15": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s already late afternoon. The thought of visiting the Dungeon Management Office right now and going to the crowded Apgujeong area was a bit annoying.\nI decided to go to the Hunter Market tomorrow and put the 50 rubies in my inventory.\nNext was the new skill.\n\n[The Barista\u2019s Extraction (D)\nDetails: (Lv.1) Extract espresso from ground coffee beans.]\nTo make an Americano, I have to extract espresso from ground coffee beans. Is it the skill for that?\nThe problem was that Americano recipe. Unlike in the case of coffee mix, when I selected the recipe, the details appeared, and the content was\u2026.\n[Recipe: Americano\nIngredients: Dried Fruit of Yggdrasil, hot water.]\nThere was an incomprehensible word written from the first line.\nYeah? Is not a normal coffee bean powder? Perhaps it\u2019s the name of a bean type like Yirgacheffe or Kenya AA? There must be a bean called Yggdrasil.\n\u201cWait a minute \u2026 Yggdrasil?\u201d\nI remember hearing a similar word recently. Where was it? Yggdrasil, Yggdrasil\u2026.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it that tree?\u201d\nThen, Mieum pointed to one side of the table.\nOn the table,\u00a0there was a branch that was recently obtained as an achievement\u2019s reward. I took it out to imitate the natural interior I saw on Instagram. Come to think of it, I think the name was like that.\nI thought it was just for interior decoration, but it turned out to be useful.\nHowever, the Branch of Yggdrasil has only a few green leaves with no fruit at all. How do I get the fruit?\nAt that time, a new notification window appeared in front of me.\n[Congratulations.The Eligible who has completed the tutorial quest, you have obtained the right to access the Ether-Wiki.Ether-Wiki is an encyclopedia completed with user contributions.Gather as much information as possible to fill in the contents of the Ether-Wiki.\nAccess Now \u261c]\nWhat is this?\nI tried to turn off the notification window, but it didn\u2019t turn off. Not only that, but the \u2018Access Now\u2019 part started flashing. It was like asking me to access it now.\nShould I press it or not? While I was hesitating, the contents of the system message changed.\n[Please log in ( \u02c3\u0323\u0323\u0325\u1dc4\u2313\u02c2\u0323\u0323\u0325\u1dc5 )]\n[Are you really not going to log in?

It\u2019s like I\u2019ve become a bad person. I feel like I\u2019ve become a bad person.\nEventually I picked up the white flag and accessed the wiki.\n[Checking your eligibilities \u2026 Completed.][The Eligible: Kwon Rieul has been verified.]\n[Ether-Wiki][Welcome to the encyclopedia of the dimension cultivated by The Eligible.]\n[Information collection rate: 0.05%]\n[Viewable Items: \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2026..]\nEh, what is this.\nBelow the brief description, almost all of them were black blocks and could not be read. It is a feast of black squares.\nI was expecting it to have some great features, but it doesn\u2019t seem very useful. Sheesh, why did you ask me to see this?\nI was trying to turn off the wiki right away, but the system notification popped up again.\n[You can see more information by completing quests and collecting information.]\nNo, it\u2019s fine\u2026.\nI\u2019m not going to see it, so I hope you just leave me alone.\n\u201cMieum, is there any way to turn off system notifications?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course not!\u201d\nIt\u2019s a system that doesn\u2019t have any \u2018no notifications\u2018 feature. So, does that mean that I have no choice but to keep seeing this message?\n[Search for the item you are curious about.]\nIf you say it like that\u2026.\nI reluctantly typed \u2018Fruit of Yggdrasil\u2019 on the wiki screen that appeared in front of me. The page soon opened to see if this item was among 0.05 percent of the information.\n\u300aThe Fruit of Yggdrasil\u300bType: Plant>FruitDescription: A fruit that grows on the branches of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. You can make coffee beans by peeling off the pulp and drying it.\nHow to get:1) Plant the branches of Yggdrasil in the soil flowing with ether.2) Give them fresh water.3) If you check it after one night, the roots will fall and the fruit will open.4) Harvest the fruits.\nIt\u2019s really easy, right?\nRelated Topics: How to Make Coffee Beans\nTo be honest, the first feeling I had after reading the item\u2019s information is\u2026.\n\u2018It\u2019s annoying.\u2019\nIt was too much. I need to plant and water that branch to get the fruits, not the coffee. I had a strong foreboding that it would be extremely troublesome to make coffee again with the fruit.\nIt was annoying enough to make 100 cups of coffee mix.\nI don\u2019t want to work hard. I was curious about the Americano recipe, but the curiousty was not enough to make me harvest the fruits on my own.\nI have already received 5 million won, so do I need to work harder on the quest? I just want to relax. It\u2019s possible to run a cafe with ordinary coffee.\nLast time, I got involved in the system by accident, but my initial plan was just an ordinary cafe.\nTo be precise, run an ordinary cafe, work less, and rest a lot.\nAs if laughing at my resolution, a sound effect rang out right away.\n[A quest has occurred]\n[Quest: Start making Americano (0/1).]\nNo, I won\u2019t. I just want to relax now.\nWell, I might be tempted to do it after a couple more months of idleness, but not now. Go back.\n[Check the quest.]\n[Check the quest.]\n[Are you really not going to check? \u3160~\u3160]\nThis system now seems to have decided to stimulate my conscience with a pitiful concept. A pitifully pleading message kept flashing before my eyes.\nYeah, I got it. Let\u2019s open it. Even though I opened it, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I have to do it.\nI opened the blinking quest window in front of me.\n[Main Quest: The Path of The Barista (1)Congratulations.Now you are ready to start your career as a barista.Whoever conquers Americano, conquers the cafe.\nMaking Americano: 0/1\nRewards: Experience (200 EXP), 100 rubies, Random Recipe]\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I have to do it.\nIt\u2019s not.\nIt\u2019s really not, but\u2026.\nIf I exchange 100 rubies, I can get 10 million won. The moment I did the calculation, many things that could be done with 10 million won flashed through my head. 5 million won is a lot of money, but with 15 million won, wouldn\u2019t my future be more secure?\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\nWas I this easy?\nI felt a little ashamed, but the temptation of 10 million won was more than enough to throw my pride in a trash can.\n\u2018Ah, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll give it a try.\u2019\nI valiantly grabbed the branch on the table. Okay, all I have to do is plant this and wait overnight.\nHowever, a strange word stood out in Ether-Wiki.\nIt is the part where the Branch of Yggdrasil must be planted in the \u201csoil flowing with ether\u201d.\nWhat\u2019s that soil flowing with ether? Does that mean not on a plain land?\n\u201cMieum, where is the soil flowing with ether?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a common sense. Don\u2019t you know that too, kyaooo!\u201d\n\u201cI think you and I have a slightly different range of common sense.\u201d\n\u201cHeung, I\u2019ll give you a special explanation. A soil flowing with ether, an etheric soil, of course means the soil inside a dungeon.\u201d\n\u2026.what?\nWhen I heard the word dungeon, I immediately tried to throw away the branch.\n\u201cWhy are you so surprised? Isn\u2019t there an etheric soil nearby?\u201d\n\u201cWhere is that?\u201d\nSuddenly, Mieum got up and walked inside. The place where Mieum headed was in front of the wall inside the first floor of the store.\nThat is, the door that leads to the space where I first discovered Mieum.\nI was deliberately pretending not to see it!\n\u201cIf you plant the tree in the soil inside and water it, it will take root.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anywhere else?\u201d\n\u201cYou can go to the dungeon, meow.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nStill, this space would be better than a dungeon.\nNow, no strange voice could be heard, and instead of the suspicious red light, it was emitting an ordinary blue light. There is no sign of danger.\nYeah, it\u2019s not a big deal.\nAfter I finally calmed myself down, I followed Mieum and entered the blue gate.\nInside the gate, nothing has changed frrom my last visit. The blue sky with floating round clouds, the warm sunlight, and a broad forest of green lawns. If it\u2019s not due to the fact that it\u2019s a space, it would be a comfortable and peaceful scenery that makes me want to pack a lunch box and have a picnic.\nI guess I was worried for nothing. After seeing the peaceful scenery, I was relieved and found a suitable land for planting the tree branch.\nThere happened to be a place where the sun was shining and the soil was soft. I didn\u2019t have a shovel, so I dug up the soil by hand and inserted the branch. And when I poured the water from the water bottle I brought with me, the process was over.\nThe withered leaves seemed to be slightly alive. It\u2019s just a night away.\nBy the time I finished my work, it was already dinner time.\nI left this space immediately, had a moderate dinner, and came up to the room on the second floor.\nIt was not spacious, but there was enough room to stay with a bed and furniture.\nOutside the window, I can see the endless walls of Abyss.\nIt\u2019s not Riverview or Ocean View. It\u2019s Dungeon View. Still, it\u2019s good that I don\u2019t need to spend money on rent.\nThe only inconvenient things are the convenience store is far away, and I also cannot order delivery food.\nIt was still too early to go to sleep, so I turned on the TV.\n\u2014 Hello, I\u2019m Sera, the reporter of \u2018Hunter TV Live\u2018 who delivers today\u2019s Hunter news the fastest! We received a news that the Tutorial Dungeon, which had been postponed, would be resumed soon. What do you think about it?\n\u2014 Yes, it\u2019s been delayed by a week due to the last week\u2019s monster attack. The Hunter Community has high expectations for this year\u2019s rookie hunters.\n\u2014 Tutorial Dungeons are very helpful for the growth of low-level hunters. The famous Hunter Kang Hyunwoo also cleared the Tutorial Dungeon at 1st place!\n\u2014 They are still accepting additional recruitment. Hunters who awakened this year, thank you for your participation.\n\u2014 Okay, the next news\u2026.\nHunter TV was in the middle of explaining the Tutorial Dungeon.\nIt was a story that had nothing to do with me. I\u2019m a F-class Cafe Owner. If you\u2019re not a combat hunter, you don\u2019t have to participate in the tutorial dungeon.\nOf course, I have no desire to participate at all, not even a little, not this much. What can a Cafe Owner get from the dungeon?\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI want to see the customer soon, so here\u2019s another release for today.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c14": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThe moment he collected the light nets scattered around the cafe building,\n\u201cAaaah, where have you been?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be here.\u201d\nPeople who were chasing Ki Yoohyun found him from afar and ran to him.\n\nThey were a male and female, a pair of twins, who wore identical jumpers. They stood next to each of his sides in case Ki Yoohyun ran away again.\n\u201cDo you know how many times we need to find the guild leader?\u201d\n\u201cThe deputy guild leader ordered us to bring the guild leader!\u201d\n\u201cI must have told you not to call me guild leader outside.\u201d\nThe twins turned pale and bowed their heads in unison. They looked so nervous, preparing to be scolded again.\nTheir names are Joo Shinwoo and Joo Shinhee.\nAlthough it had only been a few months since they\u2019ve awakened, they were talented enough as hunters to join the Cheongna Guild\u2019s first-tier party.\nThey took on the role of accompanying the guild leader today.\nThey said it was an important role, but it was nerve-wracking. Both of them were in trouble because of the guild leader who quickly disappeared. They only found him after wandering around for a long time.\nKorea\u2019s first and strongest S-class. The man who was widely known under the name \u2018Muwon\u2018.\nIn fact, the first time they met him, he was kind and had a gentle smile, but they still felt a sense of intimidation that was difficult to deal with. It\u2019s still the same for now.  He didn\u2019t get angry at all, but they got goosebumps in their spine.\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d\nAmong the twins, Joo Shinhee, a woman, asked while glancing at the cafe behind her.\n\u201cThere was nothing strange. I don\u2019t feel the ether reaction either.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2026 didn\u2019t you go to check it out because there\u2019s something that bothered you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun looked at the red brick building in the distance and thought for a moment.\nHe already looked inside, but he felt nothing strange. To the extent that it seems intentional.\nIf there is something strange, rather than the cafe \u2026 is it that woman?\nKi Yoohyun recalled her dark chestnut hair and surprised eyes.\n\u201cThis outfit.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun injected a small amount of ether into the end of the coat. A blue vine mark appeared and disappeared.\n\u201cIs it possible for a non-Awakened person to see the mark?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not. It\u2019s a mark that only reacts to ether.\u201d\nJoo Shinwoo said so and shook his head.\n\u201cDid you have any problems?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just curious.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a guild uniform. Activating the mark and verifying it are things that only the Awakened can do.\u201d\nBut how did she recognize it? Is she a Hunter?\nIt may be reasonable to think so \u2026 still, doubts remained.\nThere was no ether in the woman. On the surface, she was like an ordinary person.\nCould it be that she hid her power in front of him?\nThat\u2019s absurd.\nThe thought gave him goosebumps.\nFrom the moment he signed a contract with the God of Another World, The Great One, Ki Yoohyun was able to freely sense and manipulate the ether of space.\nIf she can hide her power in front of him\u2026.\nIt will never be at the level of an ordinary hunter. Even the sloppy appearance may be a disguise.\nBesides, this watch.\nKi Yoohyun rolled up his sleeve and looked down at his wrist.\nInside the dial of the silver watch that wrapped around his wrist, there were letters engraved with a special technique.\nKi Yoohyun (S Class)\nRank No.1\nThe Hunter Certificate, specially produced for S-class hunters, has a different design according to the ranking of each hunter.\nIn the case of Ki Yoohyun, this silver watch showed letters indicating his ranking and special mark when ether was injected.\nHowever, few people know that the proof of the No. 1 ranking is in the form of a watch. Even within the guild, there were only a few people who have this knowledge.\nHow did the woman know about his watch?\nKi Yoohyun recalled the memories of the past, or perhaps the future.\nHe returned to the past from the future three years later. However, it was impossible to know how this happened, since he regressed to the past.\nThe future in three years. Ki Yoohyun gathered the top hunters of each guild to form a team.\nThis is because the cult that worships demons has succeeded in resurrecting the demon \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\nThe top floor of the great dungeon Abyss, the worst demon who slept beyond the Ultimate Gate. The abyss that brings an end to the world upon its resurrection.\nKi Yoohyun thought he\u2019s perfectly prepared. He gathered reliable and strong colleagues, and after being equipped with sufficient equipment, they took on the challenge. It was enough to say that the mankind has done all it can.\nBut his party was defeated on the last floor.\nWhen he arrived in front of the Ultimate Gate, where the demon was sleeping, he heard a voice in his head. It sounds like a system message, but much lower \u2026 it was an eerie voice.\n\u3010The key is not ready.\u3011\n\u3010You are not yet qualified to open the gate.\u3011\nThen, the moment he met the demon\u2019s eyes, instead of the pain that he had expected, an eerie sensation covered his body.\nHis memory ends here. He soon lost consciousness and when he opened his eyes, he was back to three years ago.\nOnce again, the opportunity was given.\nWhile he was gathering his strength to prepare for the decisive battle three years later, something different from the past he remembers happened.\nThe death of an American hunter, James Jack Smith.\nIn this second life, just like the first, James was attacked by a monster.\nThis time, however, he survived.\nClearly, the future that should flow in the same way from his memory has changed.\n\u2018Why did the future change?\u2019\nWhen he felt such a question, something different from the first life caught his eye. It was a small cafe located right in front of the desolate dungeon gate.\nObviously it wasn\u2019t there in his first life. If there\u2019s any secret, it must be there.\nToday, when he visited to solve the question, there was only an ordinary cafe owner in the store.\nKi Yoohyun recalled a woman with a soft impression he had just met.\n\u2018Should I take care of her?\u2019\nIf it interferes with the future, he was going to deal with it whatever it was.\nHe couldn\u2019t repeat the failure of the first round.\n\u2018No, let\u2019s wait and see.\u2019\nThere are some doubts, but it is too early for him to judge that the woman is suspicious.\nKi Yoohyun quietly shook his head.\n\u2018Anyway \u2026 I\u2019ll have to keep an eye on her.\u2019\nAs he looked at the small red brick building, he concluded.\n\u201cBut is there any rumors about me?\u201d\n\u201cRumors?\u201d\n\u201cFor example\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true. There were also rumors that he hid his identity because he was ugly, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case\u2026.\u201d\nThat voice rang in his ears.\n\u201cNothing. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d\nHe was quite concerned about what the cafe owner said, but it was not time to reveal his identity yet.\nInstead, Ki Yoohyun recalled the coffee he had drank a while ago.\nHe thought it was a plain coffee mix, but it wasn\u2019t. The sweetness and softness were in perfect balance, and the savory coffee aroma calmed his mind. Moreover, after drinking the coffee, there was a warm energy in his body.\nIf possible\u2026.\n\u2018I want to drink it again.\u2019\n***\nAt last.\nFinally, this moment has come.\n\u201cWhoaaaaaaahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou look like a villain when you laugh like that.\u201d\nIgnoring Mieum\u2019s comment, I looked at the flashing system notification in front of my eyes.\nI wondered if there was a problem because the system suddenly stopped working, but it seems to be fine now.\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Tutorial Quest: Coffee is My Dream\u2019.\nPlease collect the reward.]\nI selected the [Collect Reward] button clearly shown below.\n[Experience: 100 EXP have been acquired.]\n[You have reached Level 2.]\n[50 rubies have been acquired.]\n[Skill: The Barista\u2019s Extraction (D) has been acquired.]\n[You have acquired a new recipe \u2018Americano\u2019.]\nAlong with the sound effect, the the excellent messages from the system appeared in front of my eyes.\nWith excitement, I checked the contents one by one.\nFirst, level. At first, the status was poor, but I might get stronger if I level up.\nName: Kwon Rieul\nClass: Cafe Owner (F) (Lv. 2)\nStamina 100/100, Energy 100/100\nStrength: 8, Intelligence: 12 (+1), Agility: 9, Luck: 12\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nSuch expectations were shattered as soon as I checked the status screen.\nI must have read the number wrong. I rubbed my eyes and read it again, but nothing has changed. The reward for the level-up was an +1 increase in intelligence.\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s really a lot.\u201d\nI spoke sarcastically in a soulless voice. It was amazing. It was clear that this system didn\u2019t want my status to get stronger.\n\u201cCongratulations on leveling up, meoong.\u201d\n\u201cJust laugh at me\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so weak, ahahaha.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really laughing at me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do, meooooong!\u201d\nMieum raised her fur and swung a cat punch.\n\u201cCheer up. You\u2019re a precious person with talent that can\u2019t be judged by a mere status. You can comfort me by saying that.\u201d\nWithout answering, Mieum yawned and sat on the bread-shaped floor. She ignored me.\nWell, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not hurt. After all, the thing I was looking forward to the most is not leveling up, but the precious 5 million won.\nI smiled at the 50 red rubies in the inventory. Of course, it was not a real gem, but a good used in Hunter Market.\nWait, come to think of it, how do I turn this ruby into cash?\nI ran into a problem I hadn\u2019t thought of before.\nIt\u2019s not like I can go to a convenience store and pay with this ruby. What I need is cash, not Hunter\u2019s supplies.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you even know that? Just go to the Hunter Market, register, and exchange the money!\u201d\n\u201cDo I have to go?\u201d\nIt\u2019s annoying. Still, Mieum shook her head.\n\u201cAhem, open your ears and listen, Level 2 Human.\u201d\nWhy do I feel insulted?\nAnyway, according to the explanation given by the proud Mieum, it was like this.\nHunter supplies are usually expensive. A low-grade potion set was about a month\u2019s salary, so a high-grade item is really sold at an extraordinary price that ordinary people can\u2019t even dream of.\nIn order to prevent the money from flowing recklessly into the market and rising the prices, restrictions were placed on Ruby\u2019s currency exchange.\nWhen you exchange more than 100 million won, you have to report it in advance and get permission \u2026 it had nothing to do with me who\u2019s only trying to exchange only 5 million won, but I still have to visit the market and register in person.\n\u201cOur Mieum is also smart.\u201d\n\u201cThis is common sense!\u201d\nWhen I scratched her chin, Mieum, whose nose was raised, made a snoring sound.\nWhat an easy cat.\nThe nearest Hunter Market was a branch in Apgujeong.\nIn addition, in order to use the Hunter Market, it was necessary to register as an Awakened person at the Dungeon Management Office.\nPhew, I can\u2019t help it. I should register myself as an Awakened.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI don\u2019t know why I still need to say this \u2026 but please do not repost, especially on social media and w*ttpad.

            "c13": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cI apologize. I\u2019ll release your hand, but please keep your voice as low as possible \u2026 can you?\u201d\nI nodded. Then, the man slowly lifted his hand from my mouth.\n\u201cPeople \u2026 mmph, hmmp!\u201d\n\u201cHaha \u2026 Actually, I\u2019m being chased right now. If you let me hide for a moment, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d\n\nWow, it couldn\u2019t be more suspicious. Is there any reason to hide on the wall in front of this store in broad daylight and avoid people?\nA spy? Or a criminal?\n\u201cI\u2019m not a criminal.\u201d\nDid you read my mind?\n\u201cI think it\u2019s harder to not know when all your thoughts are revealed on your face like that.\u201d\nIt was a perfect poker face, he was a quick-witted man.\n\u201cAnyway, you know what I mean, right?\u201d\nI nodded, again.\nOf course, I was going to kick him out as soon as he took his hand off\u2026.\n\u2026.until I realised one thing.\nWhile my mouth was closed with his palm, I naturally took a closer look into the man\u2019s face. \nAlthough his face is covered by thick glasses, the face line is quite fine. His eyebrows fell well, and his long eyelashes cast a shadow over his dark, twinkling eyes. His skin, which I had initially thought was pale, up close was a lively milky color.\nIn short, this man is \u2026 handsome. It was enough to say that he\u2019s pretty.\nMy reasoning told me I need to scream right away, but my emotions blocked it.\nDo you know how hard it is to see a handsome man in real life? That\u2019s enough to brag to a friend through KakaoTalk for an hour when I happen to meet a man like this on the street.\nI hate getting involved in troublesome things.\nHe didn\u2019t seem like a criminal, but he was being chased, and for some reason, the man was like a bunch of troublesome things.\nThis is my motto after I returned from death, \u201cLet\u2019s avoid troublesome things\u201c.\nIt\u2019s a motto that I just set up a while ago, nevertheless\u2026.\nI really need to kick him out, but I need to\u2026.\nSlowly, the man removed his hand from my mouth. His eyes met mine.\nIt was an incredible beauty.\n\u201c\u2026.come inside for now.\u201d\nIn the end, it was the emotional side that won.\nYes, a person doesn\u2019t have to live so rationally every time.\n***\n\u201cMieum, a guest has arrived.\u201d\n\u201cMeooong (what are you talking about all of a sudden)?\u201d\n\u201cThere is such a thing.\u201d\nThe man came in and sat down at an empty seat in front of the table. He was an intriguingly flawless man.\nI posed a question to such a man.\n\u201cSo, why was someone from Cheongna Guild hiding there?\u201d\nTo avoid misunderstanding, I didn\u2019t just bring him in because of the man\u2019s rare and shiny appearance.\nThis is because when he blocked my mouth, after his appearance, I also noticed a mark engraved on the collar of the man\u2019s coat. \nHearing my words, the man stopped moving. I could feel him looking at me with careful eyes.\n\u201cWhy are you surprised? On your clothes \u2026 that\u2019s the logo of Cheongna, right?\u201d\nI pointed to the blue embroidery on the coat. The blue vine shape was definitely the logo of Cheongna Guild.\nThe guild you belong to is the most reliable proof of your identity. This is because the guild is responsible for managing and supervising its hunters. Minor disputes were dealt with as soon as they were reported to their guild.\nIn other words, he is a man with a solid identity.\n\u201cYou recognize it. This \u2026 I just put anything on and went out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, is it an impersonation?\u201d\nI sneakily grabbed my cell phone in my pocket. Impersonating a Hunter Guild is a felony. If it was an impersonation, I was planning to report it to the police immediately.\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. Right. It\u2019s not an impersonation.\u201d\nThe bewildered man waved his hand and introduced himself.\n\u201cMy name is Ki Yoohyun. As you said, I\u2019m a Hunter from the Cheongna Guild.\u201d\n\u201cThen why were you hiding there?\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 haha, there are several reasons. Since there are so many people looking for me, let\u2019s say I just tried to avoid them for a moment\u2026.\u201d\nIn a word, he\u2019s currently slacking off.\nI stared at Ki Yoohyun. Compared to his sparkling appearance, he is dressed in a modest way and looks somewhat shabby. I can\u2019t imagine him killing monsters in the dungeon with such a wretched appearance. \nYeah, I get it. He might be a hunter from Cheongna, but he\u2019s a very weak hunter who ranked last. \nMoreover, the low-ranking hunter has its own difficulties. He will have to take on chores and be abused by high-ranking hunters, and he must have a lot of trouble. \nEven though they are Hunters, not all Hunters are the same. \nAs I was once a corporate slave, Ki Yoohyun\u2019s situation was clearly portrayed. \nIn such a situation, you might just want to hide from people\u2019s eyes. When I felt like I was going to die from sleepiness, I used to go to the bathroom and locked myself there.\nWhile I felt sorry for him, Ki Yoohyun looked around the store and talked to me. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a cafe in this place.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nOnly silence continued.\nIf it\u2019s a natural and social flow of conversation, I\u2019d offer a cup of coffee here.\n\u2018That\u2019s right. Can I get you a cup of coffee?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u2018\n\u2018No. I should treat you some coffee.\u2018\n\u2018Thank you. I\u2019ll drink it well.\u2019\nLike this.\nBut I just returned from the hotel to the store this morning. Naturally, the refrigerator is empty as it has just been repaired.\nThe only thing here now was the 100th coffee mix that I was going to drink before.\nShould I give him this?\nBut the 100th coffee was meant to be savored as I celebrated the completion of the quest!\nIt\u2019s not just a waste of coffee mix. I\u2019m not such a petty person. However, it was sad that I could not fully enjoy this historical moment ahead of the completion of the quest.\nIt\u2019s like having the boss mob\u2019s HP cut down to 99%, but losing the last hit.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nKi Yoohyun looked at me with a sparkling face.\nIt was a sad look asking me to give a cup of coffee to poor low-ranking Hunter who had been struggling with chores for a while.\nHe may have just stared at me, but when I saw his finely stretched eyes and deep eyes, my mind made up such a story at will.\nUgh, those eyes are unbearable. Isn\u2019t that beautiful enough to be called a Gyeonggukji? \n\u201cMeooong (But the scale is too small for Gyeonggukji)?\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet, Mieum-ah.\u201d\nI glared at Mieum.\nEven if it\u2019s not a country, it\u2019s enough to tilt this store.\n\u201cUm, Umh, I only have coffee mix right now \u2026 have a drink.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to worry \u2026 thank you for the drink.\u201d\nFor my sociability, the last coffee mix left my hand.\nKi Yoohyun received the paper cup and took a sip.\n\u201cThis \u2026 It\u2019s incredibly delicious.\u201d\nThe grin from his mouth was lifted, and he took another sip with a slightly surprised expression.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really tasty.\u201d\nIt has cooled a bit, but it is still a 4-star coffee mix that has [Status: Good]. I was a little proud to see him enjoying it. Ki Yoohyun quickly emptied the paper cup.\nNow it\u2019s time for the quest completion notification to appear\u2026.\nWhat?\nIt\u2019s strange. Even after waiting for a long time, the notification that the quest was completed did not appear.\nIs it lagging? Is there lagging in the system? Was it connected to the internet?\nFrustrated, I hurriedly opened the quest window.\n\u2018Quest.\u2019\nIt didn\u2019t open.\n\u2018Quest.\u2019\nStill nothing.\n\u2018Open the quest window!\u2019\n\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d\nAs I stared at the air without saying a word, Ki Yoohyun spoke to me.\n\u201cMm, hmmm. It\u2019s nothing. For a moment, I think there\u2019s a bug.\u201d\nLet\u2019s think about it later. The fact that I have awakened is a secret that I have not revealed to anyone yet. I want to avoid being considered as a strange person who looks into the air and mutters to herself.\n\u201cMore than that, I have a question\u2026.\u201d\nI changed the subject by saying anything out of embarrassment.\n\u201cKi Yoohyun-ssi \u2026 ah, right! Have you ever seen the real guild leader of Cheongna?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.yes?\u201d\nOh, my. I said too much.\nThe words came out of my mouth out of bewilderment, but it\u2019s true that I\u2019m curious about that.\nThe guild leader of Cheongna is Muwon, the mysterious No. 1 Hunter. \nThe first and best S-class Hunter. A hunter who never came down after ascending to the top of the tower. There are only rumors floating around about him.\nHe is completely the protagonist of a fantasy novel. It is natural for people to ask questions.\n\u201cHe has been hiding his identity. If you belong to Cheongna, I was wondering if you\u2019ve ever seen him.\u201d\nThe question was not asked in anticipation of an answer. Even if they were members of the same guild, the likelihood that this person at the bottom would have met such an important person would be low.\nHowever, instead of answering, Ki Yoohyun said something out of the blue with a complex expression.\n\u201cYou seem to be very interested in our guild leader.\u201d\n\u201cUmh \u2026 no.\u201d\n\u201cThen why do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that he just keeps hiding his identity. See, if it were me, I would be bragging about being the number one right here and there.\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 is that so?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true. There were also rumors that he hid his identity because he was ugly, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIn an instant, Ki Yoohyun\u2019s eyes, which twinkled like a deer, shook greatly.\nStill, this is a pretty popular rumor.\nHow much media exposure was there for Kwon Jiwoon alone? He said that it would be cumbersome to refuse numerous requests for coverage and appearances on broadcasts one by one.\nFurthermore, the Dungeon Management Office used to promote the top rankers for publicity in the name of reassuring the public.\nChoi Cedric, a member of C&L Corporation, who is currently ranked second, is the same. He has appeared in public service advertisements, magazines, and broadcasting, plus his merchandise\u00a0 products are enormous.\nTherefore, there is a rumor that there is a reason why the No. 1 ranker hides his identity. Well, most of them seem to have been made up out of inferiority complex.\n\u201cIf I were him, I\u2019d pretend to check the time, pull up my sleeves and show them my number one wristwatch.\u201d\n\u201cAhahaha\u2026.\u201d\nKi Yoohyun slightly covered his watch as he pulled on his sleeve. I don\u2019t know why he cares when I talked about the wristwatch, which can be used as a proof of identity for the No. 1 ranker and S-class Hunter.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never met him.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so\u2026.\u201d\nIn fact, Ki Yoohyun looks like a bottom-ranker, so there\u2019s no way he would know such a top secret. I also asked a random person out of curiosity.\nAt that moment, Ki Yoohyun suddenly leaned under the table.\n\u201cUh, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nSoon after, I heard the same sound of words that I heard earlier outside the window.\n\u201cWhere the hell is he hiding?\u201d\n\u201cHurry up and come out!\u201d\n\u201cThat way! Isn\u2019t he hiding there?\u201d\nIt was a great reaction speed. You really have to be this fast to be a slacker.\nIn my mind, I named Ki Yoohyun as the master of slacking off.\nKi Yoohyun crawled under the table and approached the opposite window.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you next time.\u201d\nAs soon as Ki Yoohyun disappeared beyond the window, a system notification window appeared in front of me.\n[Congratulations! You have completed \u2018Tutorial Quest: Coffee is My Dream\u2019.\nPlease receive the reward.]\nLooks like the lag has finally been fixed.\n***\nA small cafe located at Dungeon Gate 3, 16th Street.\nAfter walking without hesitation until the store became smaller, Ki Yoohyun took off his thick-rimmed glasses.\nThe grin has long been erased from his lips.\nAs he brushed away his disheveled hair, the hunter with the clumsy and clueless impression from earlier was no longer there. Rather, the black eyes that were exposed under the long eyelashes contained a cold light.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nGyeonggukji: It\u2019s from \uacbd\uad6d\uc9c0\uc0c9, a four-character idiom that means \u201ca beauty that will tilt the country\u201d. In the past, usually there\u2019s a woman of great beauty that was given the title \u201c\uacbd\uad6d\uc9c0\uc0c9\u201d by the public, since she\u2019s a very beautiful woman for whom the king neglects the nation\u2019s affairs, risking the fate of the country.\nand there are a lot of Korean names, why it\u2019s a Yoohyun again.

Some people might say that playing all-day is boring, but that doesn\u2019t apply to me. The more I play, the more I want to play, so I think I can play forever.\n\nThree days later, today, I received a call from Jina that the shop had been repaired. The leisurely hotel life was inevitably over. I left the hotel and returned to the store.\nBut \u2026 the store was unfamiliar. Is this really my store?\nThere was no dust on the floor and everything from the wallpaper to the furniture inside was changed into new ones. Even the coffee machine and various household appliances were neatly organized.\nI can\u2019t believe they repaired it to this extent \u2026 being attacked by monsters is a worthwhile experience.\nNo, kidding. It\u2019s a joke. I took it back. A word becomes a seed. I don\u2019t want to go through it again no matter how much I\u2019ll gain from it.\nAmong them, the newly set table was so sophisticated that it seemed to be something that will be used by a popular cafe on Instagram.\nI took out the Branch of Yggdrasil from my inventory and placed it on the table. The green leaves added a natural atmosphere to the interior.\n\u2018This branch was really an interior item.\u2019\nWhat should I do? It would be a problem if the number of customers suddenly increases if this place is rumored to be a a cafe with pretty interior.\nWhile I was excited with this vague delusion, the missing Mieum secretly appeared from the inside of the store.\n\u201cMieum, where have you been?!\u201d\n\u201cI was called for a while.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 The system called me.\u201d\nIt\u2019s somewhat suspicious. She said she helped me because she was an agent of the system, but she\u2019s not making excuses after running away alone when a monster appeared.\n\u201cWhat did you say back then?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026..Meow.\u201d\nMieum played a different tune.\n\u201cWhy, you said something about the cursed apostle.\u201d\n\u201cMeooong, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\nI wanted to push more, but I stopped because Mieum looked dull.\nWell, anyway, the monster died and she came back safely, so it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\nNow, I really hope nothing happens. It\u2019s my wish, I hope it\u2019s quiet and peaceful until I open a proper cafe.\n***\nEven so, in the end, my wish didn\u2019t come true.\n\u201c\u2026.Ah.\u201d\nIt was because the moment I was about to drink the last cup of my 100 cups of coffee mix, I made eye contact with a suspicious person.\n***\nPage Two: Americano, please take a step forward\n\nKorea\u2019s No. 1 Hunter Community \u2013 Hunter Channel.\nFree Forum Board.\n\u2014 Ranking, The Slave Hunters Guild is banned.

Even the video was taken without a proper shot at his face\n\u2514 Jeju Guild District 1: I would brag about it to everyone if I\u2019m ranked as the No. 1\n\u2514 Kano-jjang: I guess he\u2019s not an attention seeker like you\n\u2514 MM: Is it because he\u2019s ugly? ;;;;\n\u2514 lI1l1Il:\u00a0but when a Hunter awakened, their appearance will get better, right?\n\u2514 OO: Maybe it\u2019s not enough LOL\n\u2514 MayoMayo: Han Yiseong knows Muwon\u2019s face,, if only he told us whether he was handsome or not\n\n***\nIn a flash, a black shadow disappeared through the window.\n\u201cMi, Mieum, that!\u201d\n\u201cMeow?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t see it wrong, did I? I\u2019m sure I saw someone standing by the window.\nContrary to my fuss, Mieum just lay on her stomach and scratched the floor as if she had not seen anything.\nI got goosebumps.\nIn fact, while resting at the hotel, I was in a state similiar to arkoudaphobia. I was surprised to see a polar bear documentary on TV, my heart pounded when I saw a large teddy bear in a souvenir shop, and my heart raced just by looking at the bear emoticon on KakaoTalk.\nI almost died. That\u2019s how much the aftereffects were in this world.\nMaybe the monster appeared again\u2026.\nNo, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s impossible. Let\u2019s calm down. Who could be that unlucky. Yeah, I must have mistakenly seen the leaves flying in the wind.\n\u201cIt\u2019s especially windy today.\u201d\n\u201cKya? What are you talking about? Isn\u2019t the weather nice?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the wind \u2026 right?\n\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cUugh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cGo to the bathroom if you are in a hurry.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d\nAs expected, I can\u2019t do this. After contemplating, I put down the last cup of coffee mix.\nI can\u2019t just leave a nauseous feeling at this historic moment ahead of the quest completion.\nIt\u2019s probably not a leaf that\u2019s flying in the wind, but it\u2019s definitely nothing!\nI\u2019ll check it quickly, then I can receive 5 million won with a refreshing heart.\nI opened the door and went out to the front yard. Even if it was a yard, it didn\u2019t take long to look around because there was only a small space between the wall and the store.\n\u2018No one\u2019s here, right?\u2019\nI tried to get into the road with peace of mind.\nSquash.\n\u2018Squashy?\u2018\nI felt an unfamiliar touch my her feet. what? The moment my feet slammed on the floor again, a short scream was heard from below.\nWhen I looked over there, there was a man curled up under the wall, hiding. He opened his mouth, pointing to his foot trampled by my left foot.\n\u201cOuch, ouch \u2026 excuse me, could you put your foot away please\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d\nIt\u2019s a person. A person has appeared.\nWait, a person? Whew, I thought it was a monster. Why is anyone in this place and making me confused?\n\u201cSssh, look, if you can keep your voice down for a moment\u2026.\u201d\nHiding on the wall was a man with disheveled hair and thick-rimmed glasses covering his face. His face was pale, but he\u2019s smiling.\nMy grandmother used to say this. Beware of the man who smiles at the first meeting.\nActually, she never said that.\nIn any case, he was suspicious even at a glance.\n\u201cWho \u2026 who are you?!\u201d\n\u201cSo, please lower your voice\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2026 are you a peddler?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true, but\u2026.\u201d\nThen, there was a movement over the wall. There seemed to be several people running this way from over there.\nThe man covered my mouth with his hand and hid himself against the wall.\n\u201cI don\u2019t read newspapers. The water pipes are fine. There\u2019s a lot of toothpaste \u2026 huufp?!\u201d\n\u201cShh, be quiet.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, mmph, mmph, hmmmp (What is this, you crazy bastard)!\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute, like this.\u201d\n\u201cUgh (Let go of me)!\u201d\nI struggled, but the man did not release his hand.\n\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d\n\u201cGo over there!\u201d\n\u201cOnce you get caught, I really won\u2019t let you go!\u201d\nAfter a while, the sound of words faded away. It was not until the people were completely out of sight that the man finally got up.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nHere comes the dictionary.\n\nReal life player kill / \ud604\ud53c\ub294 (Hyeon-pi): It is a slang term that combines \u201c\ud604\uc2e4 (hyeon-sil)\u201d the Korean word for reality, and \u201cplayer kill.\u201d It occurs when an online debate or argument leads to physical fight in real life. Hyeon-pi in the dungeon probably means that the guild was banned because they\u2019re fighting in the dungeon over an internet\u2019s arguments.\nA word becomes a seed (\ub9d0\uc774 \uc528\uac00 \ub420\ub77c): It is a proverb that means \u201cthings can happen as you say, so don\u2019t say something recklessly\u201c. \ub9d0 is what we talk, \uc528 is seed (they sound really similar). When you put seed on the ground and give them some water, it becomes bigger and you can get some fruits from it. This way, your talk can become a seed and you will reap the fruit of it.\nAggro (\uc5b4\uadf8\ub85c):: abbreviation of Aggravation used in korea. It means a meaningless behavior or talk just to take others\u2019 attention. The english slang similiar to this would be trolls.\nDon\u2019t feed the trolls (\ubcd1\uba39\uae08, short for \ubcd1\uc2e0\uc5d0\uac8c \uba39\uc774 \uae08\uc9c0): an internet slang meaning \u201cto ignore mean persons/idiots\u201d. Some people engage in Aggro, a behavior in which they are being disrespectful in order to bring the attention to themselves. You should just \ubcd1\uba39\uae08 these people.\nKongline (\ucf69\ub77c\uc778): a group of people who are always second and have never been the first.\nExplanatory worm (\uc124\uba85\ucda9): a person who boringly explains things that they know well.\nArkoudaphobia\u00a0= the fear of bears.\n\nOh, and HunCha is short for Hunter Channel. ISTG I spent 15 minutes thinking about this one, before I remembered that the forum was named \u2018Hunter Channel\u2019. \nAnd will it be fine if I just write the korean suffix (things like -ssi, -ya, -nim, -ah, etc.) just the way it is? There\u2019s a limit of what can be translated to English, and using \u2018Sir\u2019 and \u2018Miss\u2019 is uncomfortable when this is a modern story with korean name.\nI hope the netizen talks are understandable enough for you. I already tried my best with that amount of internet slangs, but I guess the result is still in poor quality \u2026 in the meantime, there will be no updayes for 2 or 3 days because I need to recover from all these internet slangs.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

He quickly used his healing skill.\nI watched anxiously as the healing light was absorbed into James\u2019 body.\nPlease.\nI muttered to myself several times.\n\n\u201cCough, cough!\u201d\nJames coughed and opened his eyes. The dark complexion gradually returned to normal.\nThank Goodness. He\u2019s alive now.\n\u201cUgh \u2026 This is.\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cAre you awake?\u201d\nHe hadn\u2019t fully woken up yet, but they said he was fine now that he had regained consciousness.\n\u201cWhat did you feed him earlier?\u201d\nAfter James was taken to the hospital, Hunter Han Yiseong asked me. He must be wondering what kind of drink that successfully helped the healing process.\n\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t mean to keep it a secret forever. I\u2019ve awakened, but I\u2019m still hesitant to reveal that my coffee has such an effect.\nEven though I didn\u2019t know much about Hunter, I knew that \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2018 was a pretty good skill because Mieum said that I am the only one who can give an effect to coffee like this.\nStill, my body is an F-class.\nIt is burdensome to get the attention if I informed others about this skill of mine now.\nMy goal is always to be a cafe owner in a quiet place.\nI know how much attention Kwon Jiwoon suffered after awakened as a healer. Reporters came to the school we attended. Such a situation is no use for me.\nI\u2019ll have to tell Kwon Jiwoon about my awakening and skills one day, but\u2026.\nAnyway, that one day is not now. Let\u2019s think about it later.\n\u201cAh, that \u2026 it\u2019s a potion entrusted to me by Hunter James.\u201d\nMy conscience was slightly pricked because I answered with a lie.\nFortunately, Hunter Han Yiseong believed me without any doubt. Rather than the fact that he drank the coffee mix, it\u2019s more likely that James was drinking a potion to dispel the curse.\nAfter being treated for my wound, I finally realized what had happened. It was the first time that a person almost died in front of my eyes. I tried to calm myself, but I couldn\u2019t stop shaking.\n\u201cHa \u2026. Huu\u2026..\u201d\nI took a deep breath to calm my pounding chest.\nI\u2019m still survived.\nNot dead.  James and I, who died in the hand of monsters in the past before my regression. Both of us are still alive now.\nDid I somehow change one future?\nAt that moment of relief, a notification window appeared in front of me.\n[Achievement: \u2018Avoiding the First Death Crisis\u2018 has been achieved. Please collect the reward.]\nWhat?\nWhat is this? I\u2019ve achieved something?\n\u201cKwon Rieul, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon asked when I only stared into the air with a stiff expression after receiving the treatment.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just a little \u2026 I guess it\u2019s because I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to be hospitalized?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just got treated.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon gently stepped down only after I said that I\u2019m okay, there\u2019s no pain, and everything\u2019s fine five more times. In the meantime, I moved to an inconspicuous corner and opened the detail screen.\n[Achievement: Avoiding the First Death CrisisCongratulations.You safely escaped the danger of death.Let\u2019s value life.\nReward: Branch of Yggdrasil x1]\nIt was something uncomfortable. \nFirst of all, the expression \u201cFirst Death Crisis\u201d bothered me.\nFirst? Does that mean there\u2019s a second and third one? I don\u2019t even want to think about going through something like this again. What\u2019s with all these ominous words?\nMoreover, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of the thing that was written as the reward.\nYggdrasil? I searched on my phone to see if it was an expensive item I didn\u2019t know about, but only unrelated game items came up.\nI couldn\u2019t see where Mieum had gone to ask what this was.\nIn any case, I can\u2019t get the reward in this place where other people are present, so let\u2019s find out later.\nI turned off the notification window, got up, and looked around.\nI wanted to thank the Hunter who came to help earlier. However, no matter how much I looked around, the Hunter was nowhere to be seen. I thought I\u2019d be able to find it quickly because I stood in a high place.\nShall I ask Hunter Han Yiseong?\nThen, Jina found me and rushed to me.\n\u201cMiss Rieul, are you okay? I\u2019m sorry, this happened while I was out alone.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I\u2019m glad miss Jina is safe.\u201d\nI was sincere. If Jina had been attacked by the cave black bear, she might have been seriously injured.\n\u201cI was going to come earlier\u2026.\u201d\nJina lowered her gaze with a dark expression on her face.\nAs soon as a C-class flame raccoon appeared, Jina requested support from a hunter of the Dungeon Management Office.\nHowever, the hunters of the Dungeon Management Office were late with various excuses. C-class flame raccoons are not strong monsters from hunter\u2019s point of view. They said that it would not pay much, so they pushed each other to go instead.\nIt was amazing. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t go because they\u2019re dying.\nFortunately, Cheongna Guild supported us in time. It answered my question, but I felt mixed up.\nThis is because it reminded me of my time in the company before the regression, I was stuck between people who always put something off as if it\u2019s not their business. I took it here and they told me to go over there, and when I took it over there, they told me to take it here.\nIn the end, the grown-ups were fighting over who filled the printer with paper.\nCan\u2019t you just take care of the work during that time?\nHunters had that kind of person too.\nAnyway, the inside of the store, which was damaged because of the monster, would be repaired by the Dungeon Management Office and they even compensated me.\nPerhaps because there are so many things like this, the procedure was simple, and all I had to do was sign a simple document and it was over.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the details later and take a good rest today.\u201d\nFurthermore, they even booked me a pretty expensive hotel as a temporary accommodation.\nKwon Jiwoon told me to come to his house if I had nowhere to go, but I chose the hotel. It was because I thought it would be better to be alone to properly check the rewards in the system notification window.\nThere\u2019s no reason to see Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s face at home. Even though Kwon Jiwoon was the one who suggested that, it would not have been sincere.\nIt\u2019s also a secret that I wanted to sleep in a hotel more. They said the hotel offers a breakfast buffet. The luxurious breakfast buffet that I saw every time I blogged in my life before I returned to the past.\nWith excitement, I searched for breakfast buffet postings on my phone.\nWow, the cereal section also has a lot of variety. Mieum will like it.\n\u201cMieum!\u201d\nBut Mieum was nowhere to be found.\nCome to think of it, I haven\u2019t seen her since she said something strange when she saw the monster earlier. Even if I didn\u2019t call her, she was always sitting at my feet and scratching the floor for food.\nWhere did she go?\nShe didn\u2019t run away by herself  just because she was afraid, did she? I believe that Mieum is not such a disrespectful cat.\nI don\u2019t mind being alone because the monsters were already dead, but\u2026.\nMieum, you didn\u2019t go with me. I already called. There\u2019s nothing else to complain later.\n***\n[Tutorial Quest: Coffee is My DreamA thousand miles starts with one step.Let\u2019s learn to use the skill, starting with the simplest coffee.Brew 100 cups of Coffee Mix: 99/100\nRewards: Experience (100 EXP), 50 rubies, Americano recipe, ???]\nI checked the quest screen with a cup of coffee mix in my hand. The clearly marked number \u201999\u2019 caught my eye.\nFinally, it\u2019s the last.\nThe last cup of the long tutorial quest is in my hands. If I drink this one cup, I will finally finish the 100 cups of coffee mix.\nSince this ini the very first tutorial quest given to me, the system must have been ruined quickly if it\u2019s a modern game. These days, gamers leave quickly if they don\u2019t give them a big scoop from the beginning.\nThat\u2019s why I hope the reward item \u2018???\u2019 is a good one.\nAs I was holding this last coffee mix in my hand, I was reminded of the past few days.\nI was just trying to make 100 cups of coffee mix, but too many things happened. In retrospect, the feeling is entirely new.\nFirst of all, the hotel I stayed in while the store was being repaired was an expensive place, so it was comfortable. It\u2019s very comfortable, but \u2026 the problem was that there was no breakfast buffet. A few days ago, rifts occurred nearby and the hotel restaurant was destroyed.\nMy buffet!\nNothing really works on my favor. Instead, the hotel offered other food, but I still wanted to eat the buffet.\nI poured out curses about dungeons and monsters inwardly.\nIf I had been a hunter as strong as Muwon, I would have gone into all kinds of dungeons and wiped them all out. If you\u2019re the S-class hunter who ranks first in the country, you won\u2019t be afraid of dungeons or anything.\nAnd as you walk around wearing clothes with big names on it, you can secretly say this to everyone you meet on the street, \u2018Why? Do I look like the No. 1 hunter in Korea and the guild leader of Cheongna Guild?\u2019.\nI would buy a triangle kimbap at a convenience store and took out my Hunter ID card, pretending it was a mistake. Just thinking about it makes me feel good.\nHow does it feel to be a hunter that the entire nation is curious about?\nSo, it means that I was bored at the hotel to the extent that I thought of such nonsense.\nI took out the \u2018Branch of Yggdrasil\u2018 I got as a reward for the achievement, but I couldn\u2019t figure out its purpose because it was just a wooden stick with leaves. It was quite fresh.\n[Item: Branch of Yggdrasil (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)A branch cut from Yggdrasil, The World Tree.

            "c10": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d \nIt was a tall man who entered the entrance. His long, disheveled hair covered his forehead. Due to the fact that he also wore glasses, his face was not clearly visible. However, the sign in his chest clearly caught my eye, it\u2019s a sign that indicated he\u2019s a Hunter.\nIt\u2019s a Hunter.\nI can live now.\n\nWith a sense of relief, the image of James who was on the verge of losing his consciousness caught my eye.\n\u201cThe injured \u2026 there is an injured person here!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s move him out. There will be other people coming soon.\u201d\nPerhaps it was because he was a strong hunter, he carried the large James on his back and took him outside.\nThere was a chaotic mess outside. Ambulances arrived in a row, news reporters came with their cameras, and there are also several officials who clean up the surroundings.\nAccording to what the officials who were cleaning up the remains of monsters around me said, the situation was like this:\nWhen a rift is not processed in time, the monster pops out of the rift is called a \u201cDungeon Break\u201d. Monsters that endlessly pour out and attack humans are simply a disaster. The dungeon break that occurred 15 years ago destroyed a city.\nBut what if the dungeon break didn\u2019t happen in a single rift, but in the great dungeon Abyss?\nIf monsters pour out of an infinite dungeon that has not yet been completely attacked\u2026.\nIt\u2019s a contingency emergency, of course.\nA few days ago, the hunters who were looking around this area because of an anonymous report were nervous.\n\u2018That must be the report I made\u2026\u2019\nIt is said that the monsters that suddenly poured out became ashes and disappeared. It\u2019s the same as when the cave black bear died.\nNo way, was it done by the strange voice I heard earlier?\nI don\u2019t know for sure yet, but it\u2019s a fortunate thing among the misfortunes.\nEven in the midst of embarrassment, the hunters were busy moving to rectify the situation.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an injured person!\u201d\n\u201cHurry up and lay him down here!\u201d\nThe surroundings quickly became busy as the Hunters, who appeared all of a sudden, examined James\u2019 wounds and checked the broken store.\nIt was then that I noticed something. I got surprised when I recognized the jumpers the Hunters wore. There was a large blue thread written \u2018Cheongna\u2019 on it.\nWhy is Cheongna Guild here?\nCheongna Guild was one of the top three guilds in Korea, the so-called Big Three Guilds.\nHowever, unlike the corporate guild \u201cC&L Corporation\u201d and the family guild \u201cRoyal Guild\u201d that are also the part of the Big Three, the details of this guild were veiled.\nFirst, there was not much external activity. They rarely appeared on TV shows, and their activities were all about silently raiding the dungeons.\nA small guild with little external activity. It is the opposite of C&L, the guild that gained popularity with various businesses.\nHowever, no one doubts that Cheongna Guild is one of the Big Three.\nThis is because it shows the best attack efficiency with the minimum number of people.\nSo far, there are zero deaths have been reported during their attacks.\nThe guild members\u2019 grades are on average B+ or higher. No. 1 in rift treatment efficiency. The 1st place in the attack progress of the great dungeon Abyss.\nAmong them, the seven hunters who belong to the main party called \u201cBlue Vine\u201d were especially famous. This is because each member faithfully performed their role.\nAny hunter who has ever thought of things like \u2018I wish the Tanker had done their job properly\u2018, \u2018Did you doze off when you\u2019re supposed to do the healing?\u2019, \u2018Look at the damage, does the Dealer fall asleep?\u2019 would know about this; how precious are party members who can do their job well, and how difficult it is to meet them.\nIn short, a place where strong people gather and work hard together. Even among hunters, it is almost like a fantasy Munchkin guild.\nAnd the person who leads Cheongna Guild is\u2026.\nThe number one Hunter in Korea, the guild leader is Muwon.\nCurrently, the person who took the first place of the ranking is unknown in name, age, and address. So, instead of his name, he was called Muwon, the title registered on the Hunter\u2019s Register.\nNot to mention high school graduation photos, something like SNS post that was written before becoming a hunter stated \u2018I have to be the best.\u2019, \u2018Kekekeke \u2026 the darkness encroaches on my body.\u2018 is rare in an era when all such writings are easily stolen.\nNot that there were no attempts to uncover his identity, but they all ended in failure.\nThe hunter paparazzi newspaper \u2018Hunter Scope\u2019, which was particularly obsessed with him, even posted an apology on the main page of their site, stating that they would never cover the paparazzi of \u2018Muwon\u2018 again.\nVarious rumors were circulating, things like that he actually had a dirty personality, the real \u2018Muwon\u2019 was dead and that the person who replaces him now is a fake, he is a virtual hunter, or that he is actually the final weapon made by a secret organization \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of nonsense like that but none of them has credibility.\nMaintaining this level of mysticism raises the question of whether he is really strong.\nHowever, after Muwon cleared the A-grade dungeon alone, the noisy sound completely disappeared. It was a dungeon that the first-team party of C&L gave up on. Without Muwon, Korea would have suffered great damage.\nAnd the video showing \u2018Muwon\u2019s skill use\u2019 had hundreds of millions of views despite the poor quality\u2026.\nIn short, he is an incredibly strong hunter, the best of the best in Korea.\nHowever, for some reason, he rarely shows up, the No. 1 ranker stayed in the shadows.\nAt least, the deputy guild leader of Cheongna Guild showed his face on the media.\nI\u2019m sure the name is \u2026 what was his name? I\u2019ve heard of it before. My heart felt sorry for the name that I couldn\u2019t think of.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Miss Kwon Rieul, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nWhen I turned my head, there was a good-looking man in front of me.\n\u201cMy name is Han Yiseong. I am the deputy leader of the Cheongna Guild.\u201d\nThat\u2019s right. Han Yi Seong. I remembered. Yeah, that\u2019s the name.\nI think he\u2019s in his mid-30s? Lastly, he looks a little younger than when I saw him on the news. He wore a suit and tie, which gave him a more office-like atmosphere than a hunter.\nHe\u2019s so famous, given that I\u2019ve even seen him on the news, but how does this person know me? I\u2019ve never even been on the news.\n\u201cDo you know me?\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you the cousin of Kwon Jiwoon from the White Silver Guild?\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nHe knew Kwon Jiwoon. Indeed, it was not strange to say that they were an acquaintance because both of them are hunters.\nHunter Han Yiseong said with a bitter smile on his sociable face.\n\u201cI heard a lot about you. You are very different from Hunter Kwon Jiwoon.\u201d\nI\u2019ve heard that a lot.\nCompared to Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s striking appearance, I have a common impression.\nIf you put us side by side, you\u2019ll get the impression that one is an important person and the other is a Person A. If it\u2019s an RPG game, it\u2019s like a novice village innkeeper who sees off the main character hero\u2019s party.\nThe family of a famous hunter is usually treated like that. Although I have awakened, I am an F-class owner cafe, so I am just like a normal person.\nNaturally, the answer I gave was stiff.\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t look similiar?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not about looks, Hunter Kwon Jiwoon\u2026.\u201d\nHan Yiseong, who was waving his hand in surprise, blurted out the end of his words as he couldn\u2019t choose the right word.\n\u201c\u2026.Rieul.\u201d\nAt that time, Kwon Jiwoon appeared through the people around him.\nPerhaps he was surprised to see me in a mess, drenched in blood, his dark eyes sank deeper. Why is Kwon Jiwoon here?\nOh, it was an emergency, so they must have called him as a healer.\n\u201cDid you get hurt? That\u2019s why I told you to stop working in a place like this\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nA heavy sigh followed.\n\u201cCome here, I will treat you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\u201cKwon Rieul.\u201d\nBut all the blood on me was from James, and all I got was just a scratch. I continued, pointing to James lying on the cot.\n\u201cJames, more than me \u2026 Look at that Hunter first. He got hurt a lot.\u201d\nAs Kwon Jiwoon approached, the medical staff who was monitoring James\u2019 condition made a place for him.\nJames was still unconscious. Although the first aid was already given, the arm that was bitten by the cave black bear was deeply dug, and the blood did not stop flowing, so his clothes were soaked.\nKwon Jiwoon immediately used his skill, and the twinkling light from his fingertips was absorbed into James\u2019 body.\nSlowly, the bleeding stops and the flesh reattaches. It is an amazing skill effect whenever I look at it.\nEven so, James still showed no sign of opening his eyes. No, it seemed to get worse. His face is ashy and his lips are dark. In addition, Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s expression became serious.\n\u201cWhy \u2026 what\u2019s wrong? Is it too much?\u201d\n\u201cThis \u2026 this might be difficult.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon, the 12th-ranked hunter, is the nation\u2019s best healer. His skill \u2018Light of Healing\u2018 is a powerful healer skill that can heal even the worst wounds with just a breath.\nWhen he said skeptical words like that, I was terrified. If James were to die\u2026.\nNo, let\u2019s not think about it. Why die? He needs to survive.\nHunter Han Yiseong, who was watching from the side, spoke to me.\n\u201cMiss Rieul, what kind of monster attacked you?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that \u2026. it was said that it was an A-class Cave Black Bear.\u201d\nAs soon as he heard my words, Hunter Han Yiseong\u2019s face darkened.\n\u201cWhy is that here?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\n\u201cA-Class Cave Black Bear is a monster that only rarely occurs in dungeons that are originally grade B or higher. There are only a handful of them that have been observed in 20 years.\u201d\nBut the monster is already dead, so why does he look like this? Why hasn\u2019t James opened his eyes yet?\n\u201cThe claws of the Cave Black Bear are cursed. It\u2019s the opposite of a healing skill.\u201d\n\u201cThe trauma has healed, but the part that has been engulfed by the curse is reducing the effectiveness of the Healing Light. In order to be completely healed, the curse must first be lifted\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThere is currently no hunter in Korea who can lift the A-class curse.\u201d\nHunter Han Yiseong let out a low sigh, and Kwon Jiwoon lowered his eyes bitterly.\nWhat, why are you two making such faces? Don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s really no other way\u2026.\n\u201cThen, James\u2026.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon put his hand on my shoulder. The deep disappointment he felt has been transmitted to me as well.\n\u201c\u2026Kwon Rieul, where are you going?\u201d\nIs there any way?\nI ran into the store with a feeling of grasping at straws.\nBefore the monster appeared, James drank two cups of coffee mix. The effect is a 100% increase in recovery speed.\nIf I let him drink up to the third cup, the recovery effect may be stronger.\nIt may be a silly idea, but it may work. I had no choice but to hold on to such hope.\nThe inside of the store was a mess with debris and broken tables.\nI quickly found what I needed inside.\nFortunately, the electrical pot was not broken. The coffee mix bags, paper cups and teaspoons were also crushed but still remained usable. I immediately used the skill while boiling water.\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand.\u2019\nI was in a hurry. I quickly poured the coffee mix into a paper cup.\n[High concentration increases the perfection of the drink.][Item: Coffee Mix (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605)][Status: Perfect\u2026.]\nWithout even having time to check the system notification to make sure it was done properly, I grabbed the paper cup and ran to James.\n\u201cKwon Rieul, that?\u201d\n\u201cLet me try it once.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon didn\u2019t stop me.\nRather than expecting it to work, it seemed like he was just concerned about my mind.\nIt\u2019s hard to feed a person who has collapsed with hot coffee mix. I waited for the coffee to cool down moderately, then grabbed his nose and poured it into his mouth.\n\u2026. Gulp.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nYou can google \u201cwhat is munchkin in RPG\u201d if you want to get a detailed explanation of munchkin, but if you don\u2019t want to do that, you can be a simple person like me who simplified the term as \u201cmunchkin = ridiculously OP\u201d.\nI changed the translation of \uccad\ub77c from Cheongra to Cheongna. I used Cheongra in the first chapter because I was thinking about Blue Dragon (\uccad\ub8e1 / Cheongryong), and the guild\u2019s name might be similiar. But when I googled it, Cheongna got used more oftenly than Cheongra as a place\u2019s name even though it has same hangul. Idk you guys can tell which one you like more between Cheongra and Cheongna. I\u2019m still thinking if the name is supposed to be translated to Blue-something. Cheong (\uccad) is Blue (or Green, if that\u2019s what you choose to believe), but I\u2019m not sure about the \ub77c.\nOh, and please give this a vote too. As usual, the \u2018u\u2019 or \u2018eo\u2019 in Korean name is such a pain to decide.\n\n\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

The situation was over in a flash. James smiled leisurely at Jina and even reassured me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can defeat this monster.\u201d\nThank Goodness.\nI was afraid that a large-scale dungeon break would explode, but it must have been just one monster.\nUnlike in the past, the crisis can be avoided. My heart finally calmed down when I saw the raccoon completely double-sliced.\nJina was away for a while to contact the main office, and James asked me.\n\u201cTell me where I can buy this fantastic coffee.\u201d\n\u201cYes? If you come any time, I will serve you coffee.\u201d\n\u201cI will return home in three days. I don\u2019t want to go back home when I think that I can\u2019t taste this perfect taste again. Please let me know.\u201d\nThis is just an instant coffee produced by mainstream brand. The coffee mix that is sold in most supermarkets in Korea.\nI just brewed it using the \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2018 skill.\nStill, I was overwhelmed with James\u2019s enthusiasm and stopped my honest answer.\n\u201cWhen you go to the supermarket, they sell coffee in bags like this. Yeah? Ah, I\u2019ll write down the brand name and the address here, so if you ask the staff\u2026.\u201d\nI wrote down the supermarket address and the instant coffee brand\u2019s name in a neat paper and handed it over to James.\nBut at that very moment\u2026.\nPuk.\nMonster\u2019s claws pierced James\u2019 chest.\nSegek.\nBlood spattered with a creepy sound as if something was being crushed.\nIts large mouth opened wide and sharp teeth bit James\u2019 arm.\nDrip, drip. The blood that flows down mixed with the monster\u2019s saliva.\nUh? What is this?\nMy brain isn\u2019t working properly.\nI\u2019m scared. My body trembled with instinctive fear and I couldn\u2019t even move properly.\nBig mouth and sharp teeth. The monster that appeared now was not like a C-class Flame Raccoon.\nIt\u2019s much bigger\u2026.\n\u201cUgh, Heukh, Euhuk \u2026 Ugh!\u201d\n James groaned and covered the wound with his hand. However, it was not enough to stop the pouring blood. Even at a glance, the wound just now was fatal.\n\u201cRun away. I will stop this monster.\u201d\nJames, who staggered up, used his skill.\n\u201cKeeeeek!\u201d\nThe monster that was cut by the blade wind screamed. Is it working?\nHowever, even after the gust of wind stopped, the monster was still intact.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\n\u2018It\u2019s disgusting\u2026.\u2019\nThe monster I saw right in front of me resembled a bear. However, it was just so big and scary that it could not be compared to an ordinary bear.\nThe fur seemed as hard as steel, and the head reached the ceiling of the store. There were horns on the monster\u2019s head and it seemed like a hole would be drilled in the ceiling.\n[A Cave Black Bear (A) has appeared.]\nIt\u2019s an A-class?\nThe late system notification delivered disappointing information.\n\u201cKeuuung!\u201d\nWhile screaming, the cave black bear swung its front paws.\nCrack! The table, cut in half by sharp claws, fell sideways, and blocking our path.\nI could hide behind the table, but it was only a matter of time before I died. If the monster hits an old wooden table twice, it will become powder.\nJames\u2019 wounds were fatal at first glance.\nI wasn\u2019t confident of running away from that monster\u2019s attack with James. No, it\u2019s the same even if I was alone. No matter how I get out, the monster will come after me and tear me apart.\nUgh, it really hurts to be torn by a monster\u2019s claws. Since I am speaking from experience, you can believe this claim. It\u2019s an experience I never want to go through twice\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nCrunch.\nThe heavy front paws tore the table like a piece of paper. Now it was time for the monster to tear me apart with just two steps.\nAm I going to die again? In vain like this?\nA few days\u2019 events that I experienced after returning from the future ran through my head.\nIt was a second life that was too short.\nThe fate of dying in the monster\u2019s hands doesn\u2019t change, did regression just change the place of death?\nSuch pessimistic thoughts dominated my mind.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.!\u201d\nThe moment I foresee the pain that will follow and close my eyes tightly, a translucent barrier surrounded by light appeared in front of me. It was James\u2019 skill.\nI was relieved for a while, but when the cave black bear pounded the barrier, it began to crack little by little.\nWhen the barrier did not break at once, the monster hit it with its horns this time.\nBang!\nThe barrier shook as if it were about to break.\n\u201cUnbelievable\u2026.\u201d\nJames muttered with a look of despair. The pain seemed considerable. His face was pale, and his biting lips were almost purple.\nHe murmured in a harsh voice, perhaps determined to let only me run away.\n\u201cRun away. I cannot move.\u201d\nEven so, it hurts my conscience to leave the dying hunter alone and there is no way to escape in the first place.\n\u201cMieum, is there any way? Mieum!\u201d\nI called out Mieum with the feeling of grabbing the last straw.\nAgent of the system \u2026  it\u2019s because she said she\u2019s not an ordinary cat.\n\u201cMeooong (Why is that here\u2026.)\u201d\n\u201cMieum?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nBut Mieum didn\u2019t answer.\nShe just groaned at the cave black bear with her fur raised. I was hoping for a secret skill that could solve this situation, but there seems to be no other way.\nYou said you were an agent! You said you weren\u2019t an ordinary cat!\n\u201cWhy is that thing here \u2026 that\u2019s not like a C-class Flame Raccoon! It\u2019s a cursed apostle who now submits to a sealed higher being.\u201d\nMieum?\n\u201cHey, can\u2019t you just tell me in words I know?\u201d\nI have no idea what you mean by being a higher being or an apostle.\nIt\u2019s a completely fantasy world.\nAnd right now, right before being torn by the monster\u2019s claws, it was not an appropriate situation to talk about it.\n\u201cThe cave black bear is not an ordinary monster. A long time ago \u2588\u2588 made \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cMieum?\u201d\nAgain. I couldn\u2019t hear some of Mieum\u2019s words. Furthermore, a red system window blinked in front of my eyes.\n[Warning: Abnormal Approach]\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\nMieum and the system window, the things I gained through awakening, were of no help in this crisis situation.\nI\u2019m glad Jina isn\u2019t here. At least one person could have run away. I hope she wouldn\u2019t be too surprised when she found out later.\nThe moment when I\u2019m ready for my second death.\nThere was a twinkling red light on the inner wall.\nA red light was leaking from the door leading to the space.\nWas it originally that color? It used to be blue.\nNo, it wasn\u2019t the time to think about it. Let\u2019s go into that space first. Monsters won\u2019t be able to get there, so let\u2019s hang in there until another hunter comes to rescue us.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe thought of what to do calmed me down.\nIt\u2019s too early to die. I\u2019ve regressed, but I haven\u2019t even completed the tutorial quest yet!\n\u201cGet up at once.\u201d\n\u201cLeave me and run away.\u201d\n\u201cHurry up. We need to move before the barrier collapses.\u201d\nI put my arm under James\u2019 armpit and got up. My legs trembled at the heavy weight of his body.\nIn the meantime, James\u2019 face was getting worse every minute by minute. I was terrified that he might die like this.\nNo, there is still time. He can survive if he enters the space through the door. I somehow managed to support his large body and move inward.\nIt\u2019s just a little further. Just a little bit\u2026.\nBrak!\nJust a few steps away,\u00a0the barrier that had been close to the ground completely shattered with a bursting sound.\nOoooooh!\nThe cave black bear screamed and ran towards me.\nThere was a red-lighted door right in front of me, but it\u2019s already too late. It would be faster for the cave black bear to tear me apart than for me to jump through the door.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nMieum said something at my feet, but I couldn\u2019t afford to answer. I just pray that this death will be less painful.\n\u201c\u2026.Uh?\u201d\nThe cave black bear that was running at us paused and hardened. Then it faltered back. It still drooled and showed its teeth, but there was no sign that it would be rushing foward.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\nThe cave black bear seemed to be afraid of something. It looked at me, or to be exact, the wall behind us with terrified eyes.\nA gate on the wall that emits red light.\nSuddenly, I felt a tremendous pressure from beyond the wall. My heart is pounding at an unknown sensation.\nThere\u2019s something. It\u2019s something sinister.\nI couldn\u2019t figure it out, but the primal fear that knowing there was something terrifying took over my body. I was sweating profusely without realizing it.\nBut what the hell is in there? When I met Mieum, there was only a cozy lawn under the blue sky. I was embarrassed by the unfamiliar space itself, but there was no sign of danger.\nThen, a voice came into my head.\n[There\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t know the subject and installs it in my \u2588\u2588.]\nSystem message? No, it\u2019s different. It sounds like the system message, but much lower \u2026 it was a deep voice.\nI had goosebumps. It seems like James didn\u2019t hear anything because he gave no respond.\nAm I the only one who heard it?\nMaybe I \u2026 should I go to the hospital?\n[Go back, apostle. This is my \u2588\u2588, there is nowhere for you to set foot.]\nIt seemed like someone laughed.\nAn extremely rough laugh.\nAlmost at the same time as the voice stopped, a flash of light flashed.\nThud!\nThe cave black bear fell down.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe cave black bear turned into ashes and disappeared. The place where there was a huge body now only filled with soot and dust.\nWhat happened?\nIt happened so quickly that I couldn\u2019t understand the situation well. All of sudden, the monster disappeared. Is it really dead?\nMy head was filled with only doubts, then suddenly I heard a man\u2019s soft voice from the entrance.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nThe next chapter will be updated tomorrow because I am curious as well LOL\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Anyway, if a monster suddenly popped out of the gate, it\u2019s very likely that it was afraid of something and ran away.\u201d\n\u201cWhat something?\u201d\n\u201cThat is something I don\u2019t know for sure. It could be a higher-grade monster.\u201d\n\nHearing Mieum\u2019s words, I became more confident.\n\u201cMieum, let\u2019s run away.\u201d\u201cMiaong?\u201d\nBut trying to run away alone hurts my conscience.\nI can go to a sauna for one night to avoid monsters, but what if Jina gets caught up in the accident? I, who have personally died, know very well how powerless ordinary people are in front of monsters.\nHowever, I doubt that other people will believe me if I say, \u2018A monster will appear in three days!\u2018. \u00a0I can\u2019t even answer if they asked how I found out.\nIs there any other way?\n***\n\u201cYou look more suspicious in that outfit.\u201dMieum sighed when she saw me.\u201cBut this is the only way.\u201dI headed out valiantly.\nI wore a baseball cap, sunglasses, a mask, and a jumper that did not reveal my body shape.\nIt\u2019s the perfect bank robbery fashion. It seems like If I go to the bank, I will be taken to the police station before I can pass through the entrance.\nIt looked very suspicious to me, but in order not to reveal my identity, it is only safe to wear a disguise like this.\nDressed as a bank robber, I headed to a nearby public phone booth. My intention was to make an anonymous report.\nIt was hard to see, but after wandering for a long time, I finally found a payphone booth. After checking once more to make sure there was no one around, I dialed the Dungeon Management Office\u2019s emergency call number.\n\u2014 Yes, it\u2019s Dungeon Management Office. How may I help you?\n\u201cI, I would like to make a report.\u201d\n\u2014 Yes, what is your name?\n\u201cMy name is Kwon Ri\u2026.\u201d\nHuk, I almost answered with my real name casually.\nThis is because of my habit of answering automatically when someone asks for my name. Since I was a child, I lived a life of raising my hand and answering when they called my attendance number.\nNo way. In my effort to cover up the fact that I regressed, I am even wearing bank robbery fashion and trying to report it anonymously right now. I hurriedly changed my words.\n\u201cKim \u2026 My name is Kim Kwonri.\u201d\nThe name is a little weird, but it can\u2019t be helped.\n\u2014 Yes, Kim Kwonri, what brings you to call us?\n\u201cThere \u2026 there\u2019s a magnetic field response near the Abyss, Dungeon Gate 3.\u201d\n\u2014 Magnetic field response?\nA magnetic field response refers to a phenomenon in which the magnetic field becomes abnormal near the dungeon. \nWhy the compass does not spin or the magnet doesn\u2019t work properly? There was a theory that when the compass became strange, rifts or monsters would pop out there.\nPredicting the occurrence of dungeons was the aspiration of many people. That\u2019s why this theory of magnetic field anomaly has received quite a lot of support.\nOf course, a few years later, it turns out that it is just a myth and pseudo-science without any basis.\nI felt like a delusional person who said that they will die if they sleep with the fan on, but let\u2019s insist.\n\u201cI hear strange noises \u2026 Ah, anyway, every time I pass by, there is a gloomy vibe.\u201d\nI repeatedly insisted that the area around the Abyss Dungeon Gate is suspicious.\nAfter insisting, the agent said that they would strengthen the patrol around the area.\nIn the past, there were many casualties due to A-grade rifts that occurred when they ignored the report because they thought it was a false report. Since then, dungeon-related reports had to be dealt with unconditionally.\nIn other words, I\u2019m relieved now.\nEven before the regression, it was originally said that it was not a high-risk monster that could harm people, so if the Hunters patrol in time, it would not be such a big damage if a monster appeared.\nI was relieved at last.\nYes, leave the monsters to the hunter and I will stick to the role of a civilian who safely evacuates in advance.\n***\nThe next day, I was drinking my daily coffee mix while looking for a place to sleep on my phone.\nThe scheduled date for the monster to appear is tomorrow. I decided to leave the store overnight and sleep somewhere else safely.\nWhen I left the company, I terminated the contract for the house I lived in before, and I couldn\u2019t go to the sauna with a cat. When looking for a hotel that allows animals, the price is slightly higher.\n\u2018Now\u2026.\u2019\nReserve it? Or not?\nWow, the bed looks fluffy and there is a bathtub with bubbles. The food looks delicious too.\nStill, this price is a bit expensive for one night\u2019s sleep\u2026.\n[ Brew 100 cups of Coffee Mix: 90/100 ]\nI checked the quest screen.\nThere was not much left until the number of quests were all filled. I\u2019m going to have 5 million won soon, so this should be fine.\nEh, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s just pay.\nJust as I was about to press the payment button on the cell phone screen, the door opened with a click.\nUh, who is it? It\u2019s not time for Jina to come yet.\nA foreign man was standing at the entrance of the store. His bright red curly hair and piercings were very colorful. What stood out the most was the large embroidered mark on his chest.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cMeow (You don\u2019t even know that! It\u2019s the American Hunter Association logo).\u201d\nHow am I supposed to know that?\nBut what about America? Why is an American Hunter here?\nWhat should I do? I haven\u2019t even thought about English since I took the TOEIC test a few years ago.\nHello, how are you, may I help you? The advanced English was long gone in my head.\nThe man opened his mouth. Contrary to my concerns, what I heard was Korean.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cOh, this is a very unusual place.\u201d\nEvery time the man spoke, the shape of his mouth and the sound were slightly off. It was as if the voice was coming from somewhere else.\n\u201cWaaeng, Meoong (Author, he\u2019s using an interpreter artifact).\u201d\nMieum whispered beside me.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a little awkward?\u201d\n\u201cMeong (He uses the cheap ones).\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\nI heard that the interpreter artifact with good performance can even communicate easily with monsters. Of course it\u2019s expensive.\nThis man must have used a cheap one, judging from the tone of speech translated.\n\u201cBut who are you\u2026.\u201d\nI don\u2019t remember ever knowing someone like this in the past.\nThen Jina opened the door and appeared.\n\u201cSir Hunter, you have to go that way, not this way!\u201d\nJina looked very tired saying that.\n\u201cOh, Jina, what brings you here?\u201d\n\u201cHello, I was showing Sir Hunter around this area. The tutorial dungeon is tomorrow, but he wants to take a look at it in advance. This is James Jack Smith, a Hunter from America.\u201d\n\u201cI am called Kwon Rieul.\u201d\nWait a minute, so this is the American hunter who died before my regression?\nI was surprised for a moment, but I calmed down as I remembered that tomorrow was the day when the monster popped out. Yeah, I\u2019m sure nothing will happen today.\n\u201cAnd a report came in, so today and tomorrow, the hunters are going to patrol this area.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nI\u2019m relieved that the report went in properly. It was embarrassing to babble about magnetic field response, but it was worth it.\nThen, this American hunter won\u2019t die.\nReassured, I took out a new bag of coffee mix.\n\u201cSince you\u2019re here, take a break. I was about to make coffee.\u201d\n\u201cAh, should I?\u201d\nJina sat across from the table. I quickly poured the coffee mix into a paper cup and poured water into it.\n[Item: Coffee Mix (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)\nStatus: Very Good (Time Remaining: 00:10:00)\nEffect: Recovery speed is increased by 100%.]\nNow it\u2019s possible to brew it without looking at the window anymore.\nI also gave James a cup of coffee, but he did not accept it and frowned.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cTry it. It\u2019s coffee.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not coffee.\u201d\nWhat? This guy?\u201cI don\u2019t drink instant coffee like this.\u201d\nI recommended it again, but James still refused.\nIgnoring coffee mix \u2026 I have seen an American full of such prejudice today.\n\u2018Smile.\u2019\nGradually, his obstinacy made it difficult to maintain a sociable smile. Instead of forcing myself to smile, I just used my skill.\nThe tip of the lips drew a soft arc line, creating a perfect business smile.\n[Activating the \u2018Smile\u2018 skill.]\n[Lv. 1. Effect: Smiling makes you feel better. This improves the mood of the subject.]\n[The cast subject\u2019s favorability increases.]\nWhat? Didn\u2019t it make me feel better?\nThe seemingly useless \u2018Smile\u2018 had an unexpected effect. Perhaps thanks to \u2018Smile\u2018, James\u2019 frowned expression has softened a little.\n\u201cHmm, come to think of it, it smells good\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cRight?\u201d\n\u201cBut this is not a real coffee.\u201d\n\u2018Hold on \u2026. Smile.\u2019\n\u201cTry it at least once.\u201d\n[Skill: Running Smile.]\n\u201cHmm, if you say so, I\u2019ll drink it just once.\u201d\nGulp.\nAfter taking a sip of the coffee mix, James widened his eyes.\n\u201cThis taste\u2026.!\u201d\nAnother sip.\n\u201cThis coffee is really great. Oh, it\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019ve never had this kind of coffee before.\u201d\n\u201cRight?\u201d\nJina said proudly and emptied her coffee mix. James also looked disappointed after drinking all the coffee in the paper cup at once.\nI quickly got fresh water in the electric pot.\n\u201cWould you like another cup?\u201d\n\u201cThank you for your kindness.\u201d\nJames, who quickly emptied the second cup, said.\n\u201cI never expected to meet such an outstanding barista in a place like this.\u201d\n\u201cAhahaha..\u2026\u201d\nI\u2019m not that kind of person.\nAnd why is Jina nodding her head along?\n\u201cI\u2019d like to invite you to America.\u201d\nPardon?\n\u201cIf you come, I\u2019d like to show you the Grand Canyon. No, that\u2019s not enough. Let me show you the dungeons of the United States.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s really okay, really.\u201d\nThe dungeons in Korea are terrible enough, but now you\u2019re asking me to visit the dungeons in the US?\nJames went on about inviting me to America. It\u2019s an unbelievable affinity since we just met.\nHopefully this \u2026 is it the effect of Smile?\nIt seems like I would be stepping on American soil without realizing it if I used it three times. It\u2019s a more dangerous skill than I thought, so I should be careful.\nInstead of going to the Grand Canyon, I decided to do pen pals instead, and that finally calmed down James.\n\u201cI, I, there\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Rieul, what\u2019s wrong? \u2026. Ugh!\u201d\nA monster ran into the store.\nIt resembled a raccoon, but it was much bigger. It red eyes and horns were extremely hideous, it almost seemed like it would run over here and tear me apart at any moment.\n[The Flame Raccoon (C) has appeared.]\n\u201cMeoooong (It\u2019s a C-class animal-type monster. It\u2019s a nasty bastard that shoots fire when you get close)!\u201d\nMieum, who was sitting on my lap, whispered.\nWhy?\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s supposed to be tomorrow for the monster appears!\nIt\u2019s a day early!\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nFinally after the boring introduction chapters \u2026 here comes the cliffhanger.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c7": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u2018I think I\u2019ll find out if I drink it one more time.\u2019\nThe next day, Jina headed to the cafe right away.\nWas it really true that she drank coffee in a cafe in this area? Her memory was blurred because she was dazed back then.\nContrary to Jina\u2019s worries, the cafe from yesterday was still standing there.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t a dream\u2026.\u2019\nThere\u2019s no signage yet.\nHowever, the cleanly cleaned building stood out from afar. The retro-style red brick building has been carefully cared for by the owner.\nAn old but cozy space, with the smell of sweet coffee flew from somewhere. Jina slipped inside, attracted by the smell of coffee.\n\u201cMeooow!\u201d\nA calico cat sitting on the bread-shaped cushion cried when it saw Jina. It was a cat with plump flesh and a soft belly.\n\u2018I want to touch it once.\u2019\nJina inadvertently tried to stroke the cat\u2019s belly.\n\u201cKiyaooong!\u201d\nThe cat screamed and dodged her hand. The creature got up, then it turned around and went inside.\n\u201cMieum, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nThe cafe owner she met yesterday came out with a cereal box in her hand and found Jina.\n\u201cJina, did you go home safely yesterday?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, I did!\u201d\nThe cafe owner poured cereal into the bowl and put it in front of the cat. The cat began to chew and devour the cereal.\n\u2018Do cats eat cereal?\u2019\nStill, that\u2019s not what matters right now. Jina mustered up the courage to speak.\n\u201cUmh, the coffee you gave me yesterday\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cOh, would you like a drink?\u201d\nRieul quickly made a coffee mix and handed it to Jina. The warmth of the paper cup gently wrapped Jina\u2019s hands. Jina couldn\u2019t delay it any longer and took a sip straight away.\n\u2026 Gulp.\nOne more sip.\nThe sweetness, rich taste of milk, and bitter coffee scent formed a golden ratio in her mouth.\nAnd the moment she emptied the cup\u2026.\nAs her head felt refreshed, her body began to overflow with energy. Her shoulders were also light, and she felt better with an unknown sense of happiness.\nAs expected, this coffee. This coffee gave Jina strength.\n\u201cReally \u2026 it really tastes great! How can coffee taste like this? Besides, I just drank a cup of coffee, but my head feels refreshed and my body is full of energy! Oh my gosh, this is the first time I\u2019ve had coffee like this.\u201d\nRieul was listening to Jina with a smile.\nJina, who belatedly came to her senses, felt embarrassed because she was talking too much alone. She coughed a little and continued.\n\u201cPlease, tell me where I can buy it!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a coffee mix.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2026 it\u2019s so delicious and it\u2019s also pretty effective! Do you have any special tricks?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no special tricks, but \u2026 \u00a0If you come, I\u2019ll brew you some, so come often.\u201d\n\u2026 are you an angel?\nLater, Jina recalled the incident like this.\nThat day, she met an angel who protects office workers.\nA few years later, it was included in the interview when Jina took the head position of the Dungeon Management Office.\n***\n\u201cThank you. It\u2019s so delicious today.\u201d\nJina bowed her head as she received a cup of coffee mix. I also looked satisfied at the quest window in front of me.\n[Tutorial Quest: Coffee is My Dream\nA thousand miles starts with one step.\nLet\u2019s learn to use the skill, starting with the simplest coffee.\nBrew 100 cups of Coffee Mix: 79/100 ]\nAs soon as Jina finished her coffee, the number changed to 80.\nFinally, 80.\nThanks to Jina, who comes to drink coffee every day, the number of quests has been filled up a lot.\nAt this rate, we will be able to complete the quest in a few days. When I thought of receiving 5 million won, I naturally smiled.\n\u201c\u2026.Meoooow. (You\u2019re drooling).\u201d\nI wiped my chin in surprise at the whisper of Mieum, but it was clean. I glared at Mieum.\n\u201cBy the way, Mieum, you\u2019re able to do ventriloquism?\u201d\nClearly, her mouth was making a cat cry, but I heard her voice in my head.\n\u201cWaaeong, Waaeooooong (Ventriloquism! Don\u2019t compare it to something like that! This is the ability to communicate directly with a special wavelength)!\u201d\n\u201cBut why are you crying?\u201d\nIt\u2019s like telepathy. Then there\u2019s no need to make a cat sound, right?\n\u201cMeoong (That \u2026 because I\u2019m not used to it yet\u2026.).\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026.\u201c\nAnyway.\nOf course, 5 million won is important, but I also wanted to get an Americano recipe quickly.\nWhen it comes to Caff\u00e8 Americano, it\u2019s the drink menu that Koreans love the most. It is also the most popular menu in cafes, so it will be essential to learn Americano in order to open a cafe in the future.\nAbove all, this coffee mix is delicious, but I wanted to try a different menu.\n\u201cHa, I think I will live.\u201d\nThe newly brewed coffee mix was also emptied at once.\nHer complexion was better than before, but she was still working late. Even now, it is already evening, but after drinking only coffee, she said she will go to the great dungeon \u201cAbyss\u201c.\nIs there something going on in Abyss?\n\u201cAh, that\u2026.\u201d\nJina answered my question with a dark complexion.\n\u201cThere will be a Tutorial Dungeon soon. Since it\u2019s a tutorial, it won\u2019t be dangerous, but a veteran hunter will join in.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\nGathering and educating the newly awakened hunters that year is called a \u2018Tutorial Dungeon\u2018.\nEven if it was an education, it was not a class, but a real dungeon attack in a practical form, and it is usually conducted on the first floor of Abyss.\n\u201cBut everyone hates to do it\u2026.\u201d\nThat\u2019s understandable. There aren\u2019t many senior hunters who want to go to the tutorial rather than dungeons with advanced rewards.\nBecause of that, Jina, an ordinary person, said she was busy with preparations.\n\u201cBesides, this time around, a Hunter from the United States also decided to visit, so I\u2019m in a rush. Still, thanks to the coffee that Miss Rieul gives me, I feel energized.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMiss Rieul?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a small chance that a forgotten memory comes up like a single thread.\nHearing Jina\u2019s words, I suddenly remembered the incident before I returned to the past.\nAt that time, the news was only talking about it all day, so why did I forget about such a big deal?\nDuring the tutorial dungeon before my regression, a monster suddenly popped out of the dungeon.\nThe level was average enough for an experienced hunter to deal with it, but they couldn\u2019t get rid of the monster right away because it appeared in the middle of tutorial dungeon.\nA Dungeon Break occurs.\nA monster that left the gate attacked a nearby private house, and just in time, an American hunter who was visiting Korea died.\nAnd the place where the monster attacked\u2026.\n\u2018Dungeon Gate 3 Street.\u2019\nUh? Right in front of this store?\nCould it be that this cafe is the nearby private house they mentioned?\n\u201cMiss Rieul, are you okay? Are you sick?\u201d\nJina looked at me worriedly.\nLet\u2019s calm down. Huuu, haaa \u2026. Huuu, haaaa\u2026..\nI can\u2019t remember the date of the incident. There might still be a lot of time left.\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing. When is the tutorial?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in three days later.\u201d\nThere\u2019s not much time left!\n***\nAfter Jina left, I put my hand on my forehead and fell into agony. What should I do if a monster appears in front of me in three days?\nIn my last life, I was getting caught in a rift, and now I am destined to face the monster that appears in my front yard in this life? I guess I had to do the exorcism first before preparing to open a cafe.\n\u2018Should I run away?\u2019\nAlthough I have awakened, I am an F-class cafe owner with no combat skills. If I run into a monster, I must get killed in an instant.\nJust because you know what\u2019s going to happen doesn\u2019t mean you know how to fix it.\nYes, it is best to avoid danger.Let\u2019s run away.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\nAs I made a serious expression, Mieum, who was lying on the floor, raised her head and looked at me.\nMieum does not know that I have returned from the future.\nCan I tell her? Wouldn\u2019t she think it\u2019s an absurd story?\nI hesitated for a moment but decided to speak. There are talking cats, though, and returning from the future to the past may not be a big deal.\n\u201cActually, I\u2026.\u201d\nI roughly told Mieum about the past. After living as a company slave and getting caught up in a rift, I returned to three years ago, and, according to my memory,  a monster will come to this area three days later.\nMieum listened to my regression story like it wasn\u2019t a big deal and said something unexpected.\n\u201cWelp. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s unusual for a monster to pop out of that gate.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cThe original system of Abyss is \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t hear Mieum\u2019s voice well as if it were noisy. She raised her fur as if she felt uncomfortable, and spoke again.\n\u201cMeeeong! Oh my, listen correctly. Abyss is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2026.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t understand only the important words as if it was intervened by someone.\nWhat is it?\nFurthermore, a system window suddenly appeared in front of my eyes.\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\n[System Error: \u2014. \u2014.\u2014]\nThe window flickered in red and did not disappear.\nI have opened the system window several times, but this is the first time something like this happened.

            "c6": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nAs a desperate measure, I installed a vending machine in front of the store.\nTo be precise, it is a vending machine that operates manually. The plastic box has a single button on it, but nothing inside.\nOn the front, a large sign was written with \u201cFree coffee\u201d and \u201cEnjoy your meal\u201c. When a customer pressed the button, I was going to quickly make a coffee mix and put it on the table.\nBut so far, not a single person has pressed the button.\n\nNot a single person!\nYesterday, only some Hunter Guild employees passed by this place. I watched nervously as they found the (manual) coffee vending machine.\n\u201cOh, free coffee! Do you want to try it?\n\u201cNever mind. All of those things are given by phone pal as bait.\u201d\n\u201cOh really?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to convince you to buy a 2 million won phone on a 36-month installment plan for a cup of coffee mix.\u201d\n\u201cHul.\u201d\nNo, it\u2019s not an action done by phone pal. My phone is 3 years old, and I feel like it\u2019s 6 years old already because of the regression.\nI don\u2019t sell phones, so can you just have a cup of coffee?\n\u2018If I said that, would it be suspicious?\u2019\n\u201cMeooooong. What kind of words are that!\u201d\nInstead, after they left, I posted a large sign in front of the (manual) coffee vending machine that read \u201cNot a phone pal.\u201d\nHowever, there was no one passing by in front of the store again.\nIt was one day when I was doing the quest sluggishly.\nIn the meantime, the store has become quite plausible. The cleaning was finished, and the coffee machine worked without any problems. The old but cozy interior reminded me of my grandmother\u2019s old days.\nAt least I won\u2019t be misunderstood as a phone pal anymore.\nBut the only recipes I have is Coffee Mix\u2026.\n\u2026 Gulp.\nI drank the last coffee mix of the day. When I poured everything into my mouth, a quest notification popped up.\n[Brew 100 cups of Coffee Mix: 25/100]\nThere is still a long way to go until 100 cups.\nThe coffee mix is very delicious, this fantastic sweet and soft taste is fantastic, but  \u2026. now I want to drink another menu.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in such a hurry.\u201d\nsaid Mieum, who sprawled over a fluffy cushion. Maybe she liked the cushion because I heard a loud groan.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to rest? Sometimes it\u2019s important to relax. Meow.\u201d\nI heard another sermon from the cat.\nSurely I want a life where I work less and rest a lot. That\u2019s the reason why I want to open a cafe here. There is no such thing as a desire to work hard.\nBut\u2026.\n[Brew 100 cups of Coffee Mix: 25/100]\nThe quest window flickered in front of me.\nI can\u2019t even complete the tutorial quest at once. This soul of the impatient K-gamer cried. How dare I fall asleep leaving behind a quest that I haven\u2019t finished yet?!\nNo, of course I don\u2019t. Even if I close my eyes and lie down, it\u2019s normal for me to think, \u2018Oh, I need to level up at a time like this!\u2019.\nI was in the middle of thinking that.\nBang! Dang! Tangtang!\n\u201cMyaaoo. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nSuddenly a loud noise came from outside. Surprised Mieum jumped up from the cushion and raised her fur. What the hell is going on?\nIt was already time when darkness fell all around. There was only one cat next to me that was busy licking cereal crumbs a moment ago.\nI was scared, but I looked outside carefully.\nSomeone was lying in front of the store.\n\u201cUgh \u2026 Heuk, Ugh\u2026.\u201d\nI also heard this mysterious groan. Should I ignore it and report it to the police?\nNo, wait \u2026 is it a person?\nA person who also looks very tired and exhausted.\nAs soon as I saw that tired figure, a certain thought ran through my head.\nIt\u2019s a perfect subject tto test my coffee.\nMoreover, the clothes she was wearing were familiar to my  eyes. It is the uniform of the Dungeon Management Official for general public officials. What is this, a government employee who\u2019s tired of working overtime?\nIt was worth knowing the situation. Before returning to the past, after suffering from overtime work, I saw that outfit the most on my way home on the last train.\n\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cCome inside for a second.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine \u2026 I just fell down because I was exhausted. I\u2019m going to\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cNo, take a break for a minute. Okay?\u201d\nShe refused and I almost half-forced the person who was about to go into the chair.\n\u201cThank you\u2026.\u201d\nAs I expected, she was a general public official of the Dungeon Management. In other words, among civil servants working in dungeon management, she\u2019s an ordinary people, not Hunters.\nDungeon management sounds good, but the reality is that it is a tough position to clean up the mess of civil servant hunters. To put it in another way,  it\u2019s the civil servants\u2019 hell and civil servants\u2019 graves. What was the retirement rate within a year\u2026.\nThe public official, who introduced herself as Kim Jina, widened her eyes at how hard she had suffered. I used to be like that. I felt pity because it reminded me of myself before the regression.\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand.\u2019\nI made a cup of coffee mix. It has the effect of speeding up the recovery, so I hoped this poor official would drink and feel refreshed.\n\u201cHave a drink.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you even gave me coffee. Thank you.\u201d\nJina took the paper cup and gulped it down. The tired expression became a little more relaxed. At that moment, I naturally smiled when I saw the number in the quest windows go up.\n\u201cWould you like another cup?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t be so much trouble.\u2026.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a coffee mix, huh. Here, have some more.\u201d\nAnother cup, one more\u2026.\nWhen I made her drink three cups in a row, Jina\u2019s face seemed to have been relieved of fatigue.\nI bowed my head and looked at the back that was leaving.\n\u201cMeooong, why do you look like that?\u201d\n\u201cThere is such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that only humans can understand.\u201d\n\u201cWaeeong!\u201d\nI  had a thought while avoiding Mieum\u2019s front paws.\n\u2018I wish she would come again.\u2019\nOf course, it\u2019s important to fill in the number of quests. Before that, I was worried when I saw that staggering step\u2026.\nUmh, is this what you call a bonding between a public servant and a (former) corporate slave?\n***\n\u201cAs expected, I knew my daughter could do it.\u201d\nIt was good when she passed the civil service exam after a year.\nHer mother was thrilled as if Jina had become a genius. She had a hard time trying to stop her mother from hanging a placard in the neighborhood. If she didn\u2019t do it, placards saying \u2018Kim Jina passed the civil service exam\u2018 would have been hung all over the neighborhood.\nKim Jina has been interested in dungeon since she was young. An unknown treasure trove, this mysterious space given by the \u2018system\u2018. There was no better place than this to ignite her enthusiasm for learning.\nBecause of this, she applied for the Dungeon Management Office, that everyone else said was difficult. Although the interview pass rate was low, Jina memorized the Dungeon Management Regulations and the ecological survey report of the great dungeon Abyss. She passed right away.\nFinally, she achieved her dream to work at Dungeon Management Office.\nHowever, what unfolded before Jina\u2019s eyes was hell. She realized with her own body why the Dungeon Management Office is called the hell and grave of civil servants. \nIt wasn\u2019t just a matter of having a lot of workload. If she had been busy with dungeon management and research, Jina would have been happy. The joy of doing what she loves must have been greater than the hardship felt by her body.\nBut Jina\u2019s main job is to assist the Hunter belonging to the Dungeon Management Office.\nThe word \u201cassist\u201d sounds good to hear, but what it actually meant was to please and serve.\nAll of the Hunters were overbearing and arbitrary, but the civil servant Hunters were even worse.\nAlthough they received a high salary that could not be compared with Jina, they were often annoyed when they were told what they were supposed to do.\nIt was normal that they couldn\u2019t be contacted during working hours since ignoring ordinary people like her is their daily routine. They even made her do small errands.\nWhen she coordinated those hunters to plan a dungeon attack, it was also common for a fight to happen.\nHow can I work with someone who hasn\u2019t awakened\u2026..!\nThe fantasy of the Dungeon Management Office was thrown into the trash can on the third day of work, and within a week of work, Jina became a Hunter hater.\nShe only wanted to resign, but when she remembered her mother\u2019s happy face when she passed her exam, she couldn\u2019t help it.\n\u201cAs expected, my daughter, your mother knew you\u2019d make it.\u201d\n\u2018Mom, if your daughter stays like this \u2026 I think she\u2019s going to break that Hunter\u2019s head.\u2019\nEven that day, Jina was trudging toward her house late at night.\nThis is because the Hunter in charge handed over the preparation of the tutorial dungeon to Jina. He said simple management tasks are not his business or something like that. Of course, it was nonsense, but Jina had no power.\n\u2018What\u2019s the big deal about a civil servant who can\u2019t get into the Hunter Guild because his grade isn\u2019t good enough? If you were a capable hunter, no, even if you were a D-class, you can go to the Hunter Guild, yet you\u2019re here and asked me to do what you called a simple management task? You\u2019re just trying to eat it raw!\u2019 \nShe wanted to shoot him like this, but she couldn\u2019t even say a word in front of him. She had a timid personality, and even though he was an E-class Hunter, he was strong and scary.\nFinally, she was on the way home after finishing all the work that was delayed until late. Suddenly, her body staggered as she stepped on the stone that was rolling on the road.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nShe really want to quit. She wish she could hit that hunter before resigning.\nShe didn\u2019t have the strength to get up, so she slumped down on the road and a yellow light flashed in front of her.\nAt first, Jina thought she was dreaming. Finally, after being overworked, did she start to hallucinate?\nPerhaps she died from overwork, and this is the entrance to the underworld.\nFirst of all, even though it\u2019s a downtown in Seoul, there can\u2019t be a store with such a warm atmosphere on Dungeon Gate 3rd Street.\nHowever, a calm voice called out to Jina, who had fallen.\n\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d\nA woman with a brooding atmosphere was looking worriedly at Jina. She said she was the owner of the cafe in this corner.\nSomehow, she went inside as the cafe owner led her and received a cup of coffee to drink.\nThe coffee mix, which she doesn\u2019t usually drink, was surprisingly delicious. The sweet taste and soft scent seemed to melt her heart, so she ended up drinking three cups.\nAfter drinking coffee and complaining for a while, the stress was relieved a little.\n\u2018Yeah, it\u2019ll be fine tomorrow. \u00a0No matter what happens, it\u2019s not my fault!\u2019\nThinking so, Jina returned home with a lighter step.\nEven so, in the next morning.\nUh \u2026 ? I woke up?\nNormally, it would take five alarms to wake her up, but she woke up at once. Moreover, what is this power that springs up naturally?\nThe chronic fatigue that had always bothered Jina was completely gone.\nShe had no headache, and her body was as light as flying. It\u2019s been a long time since she has felt this sense.\n\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d\nSuddenly, Jina thought of the coffee mix she drank yesterday.\nIt\u2019s a ridiculous idea, but \u2026 perhaps it\u2019s the power of the coffee.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s note:\nPhone pal (\ud3f0\ud314\uc774) is a term that referes to unscrupulous and illegal cell phone vendors, it\u2019s closely related term to frauds and various controversial atrocities.\neat raw is to produce results without having to struggle or put any efforts.

            "c5": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\n\u201cReally? How?\u201d\n\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\nI looked at Mieum. Shiny tricolor fur, pricked ears with long whiskers, and round feet with pink paw.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cat.\u201d\n\nHowever, it seems that the answer was not what she wanted. A meow punch flew right away.\n\u201cNot an ordinary cat! I am the seventh agent to enforce the system.\u201d\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s great. You\u2019re so cool.\u201d\n\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re really cool. It\u2019s amazing. Woah.\u201d\nIn fact, I didn\u2019t know what she meant, so I praised her without putting any soul in it.\nWhen I scratch her chin gently, her expression becomes drowsy. She is undoubtedly a cat.\n\u201cAhem.\u201d\u201cMieum knows all the difficult words. Great.\u201d\u201cMeoooong! You\u2019re making fun of me!\u201dI got caught.\nI had to give the cat another bowl of cereal to soothe it.Mieum spoke again, with her belly bulging and cereal crumbs attached to her mouth.\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m here to help you. If you complete the quest given by the system, you will receive a good reward.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Quest?\u201d\nWas there something like that?\nWhen I heard those words, there was a quest mark on one side of the status window indeed. I opened the quest window.\n[Tutorial Quest: Coffee is My Dream\nA thousand miles starts with one step.\nLet\u2019s learn to use the skill, starting with the simplest coffee.\nBrew 100 cups of Coffee Mix: 0/100\nRewards: Experience (100 EXP), 50 rubies, Americano recipe, ???]\nUh, brew coffee mix? That mixed coffee? Instant coffee?\nI didn\u2019t want to.\nI can\u2019t believe I have to make another 100 cups of coffee mix that I\u2019ve drank when I was at work.\nI turned my eyes to the reward item with an unwilling expression. Items other than experience points, rubies, and recipes were displayed as \u2018???\u2019 and were not visible.\nI understand the experience, and Ruby is the money used in Hunter Market. However, I was a regular citizen just now, so I don\u2019t know how much 50 rubies are in Hunter Market.\n\u201cHow much is 50 rubies?\u201d\n\u201cIt is 100,000 won per ruby.\u201d\nI tried multiplication in my head. The currency is \u20a9100,000  for 1 ruby, then if it\u2019s 50 rubies \u2026 \u20a95,000,000.\n5 million won?\nSuddenly, my eyes lit up and my enthusiasm surged.\nI have enough money in my bank account to cover my living expenses for the time being, but it was never enough.\nI can\u2019t believe I can earn 5 million won from 100 cups of coffee mix.\nBy simple calculation, it would be \u20a950,000 won. Even if you sell coffee in front of the Big Three guilds, it would be impossible to make such a profit.\nIn a word, it\u2019s a great gain.\nI immediately searched the warehouse and found what I needed. Fortunately, I was able to find an electric pot, a paper cup, and a few leftover coffee mixes at the bottom of the box.\nI was about to make coffee with the intention of fulfilling the quest conditions right away, but Mieum stopped me.\n\u201cWait, don\u2019t brew as it is, use your skill to brew it.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Use my skill?\u201d\nShe must be talking about the skill called \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2018.\nStill, the coffee mix is finished by just pouring hot water. Do I really need to brew while using skill?\n\u201cJust try it, meow.\u201d\nYes, this quest has 5 million won at stake. If it\u2019s for 5 million won, it\u2019s something I need to follow.\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand.\u2019\nI chose coffee mix from the recipe list that appeared in the translucent hologram window. A subtle glow shone in the order of the recipe. The hand moved naturally along the light.\n\u201cOkay, it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cTake a look at the coffee.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? It\u2019s just a coffee mix.\u201d\nFirst, as Mieum said, I stared at the mixed coffee. Then, the status window of the coffee mix appeared in front of my eyes.\n[Recipe: Coffee Mix is complete.]\n[Item: Coffee Mix (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)\nStatus: Good (Time Remaining: 00:03:00)\nEffect: Recovery speed is increased by 100% (01:00:00)]\n\u201cUh, this is\u2026.\u201d\nThere was a peculiar phrase below the description of the 3-stars coffee mix.\n\u201cIf you create it using your skill, you can give the drink a special effect. That is the real power of your skill.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a potion, but I can give an effect to coffee, that\u2019s\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026.I\u2019ve never heard of something like this.\u201d\n\u201cWhy! Of course you\u2019ve never heard of it! You\u2019re the only one who can do it.\u201d\nIn conclusion, that\u2019s a pretty good skill? I thought about that for a while.\n[Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:02:59)]\n[Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:02:58)]\n[Status: Good (Time Remaining: 00:02:57)]\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nThe remaining time in the status window was gradually decreasing.\nIt\u2019s a waste to leave it in bad shape even though I made it at the best. I took a paper cup to my mouth before the coffee got cold.\nOh, was a coffee mix this delicious\u2026?\nThe bitter coffee flavor and the sweetness blended softly in the mouth. Even the last drop made me feel regretful, and the moment I put it all in my mouth, a notification sounded.\n[Brew 100 cups of Coffee Mix: 1/100]\nThe notification reminded me of the cafe management game I used to play.\nThe gameplay was consisted of catching monsters and obtaining ingredients, making money by making menus according to the recipe, and using that money to get new recipes. The players also can decorate the store and hire part-timers, it was quite fun.\nI didn\u2019t get paid for it, but I worked really hard and got to the top of the rankings.\nHowever, I was hacked and eventually gave up the game. I was left in shock when my precious character greets me in an empty shop wearing only underwear.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You look like you\u2019re cursing in your head.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Nothing.\u201d\nFor a moment, I prayed that the hacker got a future full of misfortunes.\nAnyway, what this system does was reminiscent of cafe management games a lot. Hunters say the system is similar to a game, is it like this?\nComplete the quest, get the next quest, and each time you get a ruby, that is, cash.\nI know, I understand.\nI know, I know.I know how it feels.Since it\u2019s already 5 million won from the first quest, the amount will go up further for the next quest. Then\u2026.\nThis, won\u2019t this make me rich soon?\nI felt my heart pounding as I imagined the golden future.\nAll right, brewing 100 cups of coffee mix is nothing. I\u2019ll hurry up and get 5 million won, get the next quest and get rich.\n\u201cHuahahaha\u2026.\u201d\nFirst of all, I decided to use all 10 bags of coffee mix I found in the warehouse.\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand!\u2019\n\u2018Cafe in My Hand!\u2019\nWhen I poured mix coffee into a paper cup, Mieum intervened next to me.\n\u201cIt would be better not to make that much.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? It\u2019s good to finish the quest quickly.\u201d\nWithout listening to Mieum\u2019s warning, I poured hot water at the moment when the golden light flashed.\nHowever, things didn\u2019t go the way I expected.\n***\nMy heart thumped and my head throbbed. I rolled the blanket over to the top of my head, but no sleep came, and my mind was clear.\nI stared at the contents of the notification window in front of me.\n[Status Abnormality: Caffeine Addiction\nYou drank too much caffeine.\nLet\u2019s use coffee wisely.\nTime Remaining until release 02:58:34]\n[Time Remaining until release 02:58:33]\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\n[Time Remaining until release 02:58:21]\nSave me.\n***\nThree days passed after meeting Mieum at my grandmother\u2019s shop and awakened.\nI opened the quest window and checked the contents.\n[Tutorial Quest: Coffee is My Dream\nA thousand miles starts with one step.\nLet\u2019s learn to use the skill, starting with the simplest coffee.\nBrew 100 cups of Coffee Mix: 10/100\nRewards: Experience (100 EXP), 50 rubies, Americano recipe, ???]\nUnlike my ambition to complete the quest immediately and receive 5 million won, the progress on the quest was slow. The cause is terrible caffeine addiction.\n\u201cHa\u2026.\u201d\nThis system counted the number of completion times after drinking the mix coffee, not the moment it was brewed. In other words, I need to drink 100 cups to clear it.\n\u2018It\u2019s a bit much, but I drink it all at once.\u2019\nThinking so, I drank all ten coffee mix on the first day. And I put them in my mouth one by one.\nOne cup, two cups, three cups\u2026.\nNothing happened until the third cup. It just tastes sweet and restores my energy. But it was the very moment I drank the fourth cup\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026.Cough, Cough?!\u201d\nI spit out the coffee in my mouth in a strange feeling.\n[Status Abnormality: Caffeine Addiction has occurred.]\nUgh, what is this? My stomach hurt, my head was pounding, and my hands were shaking. As I sat down on the chair in agony, Mieum gave me a sharp scolding.\n\u201cYou\u2019re addicted to caffeine. That\u2019s why I told you not to make a lot.\u201d\u201cUgh \u2026 You should have told me.\u201d\u201cI did, but you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nI have nothing to say.\nCaffeine addiction was no joke. I couldn\u2019t even move my body due to the throbbing pain, and I couldn\u2019t sleep.\nIn the end, I had no choice but to sleep motionlessly until the abnormality was resolved five hours later.\n\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\nIn other words, drinking more than three cups of coffee a day caused an abnormality. I don\u2019t want to go through such a terrible thing again. It is an absolute specification.\nThe problem was that it will take a long time to complete the quest because I could only drink up to three cups a day. It takes about a month to fill 100 cups, three cups a day with simple calculations.\nDo I have to drink only coffee mix for a month?\nWhen I was playing game, I skipped not only the story but also the skill production and pursued quick play. It is unbearable to drag the tutorial quest for a month. This soul of a K-gamer is boiling.\nI even thought about buying a recovery pill to get rid of my caffeine addiction. But when I asked Kwon Jiwoon\u2026.\n\u201cA cure for status abnormalities? Of course, there is something like that. The price? Hmm \u2026 These days, the price has gone down a little, so a bottle costs about 1 million won.\u201d\nThis is the answer that I received.\n\u201cKwon Rieul, what\u2019s wrong? Do you need it?\u201d\n\u201cN-no, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m just curious. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in any trouble, are you? If anything happens, tell me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha \u2026 it\u2019s really nothing.\u201d\nI\u2019m doing this to get a quest reward of 5 million won, I can\u2019t drink recovery potion worth 1 million won.\nMoreover, the effect of the skill \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2018 is \u2018when making drinks in the store, the level of perfection is increased\u2018. In other words, if I leave this store, the skill is invalid and the retention time is also short. It\u2019s difficult to give the coffee to people far away.\nAll that was left was for someone to come to this store and drink the coffee mix I made.\nDungeon Gate 3 in front of the great dungeon where no one passes by, this cafe is at its 16th street!\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Note:\nI changed my mind.

            "c4": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\nI was perplexed by the awakening notification window that suddenly appeared in front of me, but I soon regained my composure and cheered.\nAwakening, I have awakened!!!\n\nAwakening is a general term for the phenomenon of manifesting the superpowers to become a hunter.\nThe exact conditions of awakening are unknown. Some say that they\u2019re awakened while lying down at home, while others awaken when they have a life-threatening crisis or when they do something.\nAnyway, the important thing is that if you awaken, you can earn a lot of money with that ability.\nOf course, I didn\u2019t intend to enter the dungeon and fight monsters just because I had awakened. I was never going to enter a dungeon on my own feet.\nAll Hunters are awakened, but not all the people that have awakened are Hunters. There are endless ways to earn money just by the fact that you have awakened without having to fight monsters in the dungeon yourself.\nIn particular, if you are an item maker, you could earn a lot of money just by making items in the guild.\nIt\u2019s something that I finally experienced after regression. I can\u2019t believe such a good thing happened!\nA cafe owner who hid her powers. A lone awakener who runs a cafe in front of the dungeon against the stark hunter world.\nIt\u2019s cool just to think about it. I am immersed in pink dreams, imagining a future where I work less and earn more as an awakened person, until Mieum said in a solemn voice.\n\u201cCalm down and check your status. Meow.\u201d\nThe cat nagged me.\nBut what\u2019s wrong with such a trivial thing when I have awakened? I could listen to as many nags as I wanted. I\u2019m an awakened person.\n\u2018Status.\u2019\nI looked up at the status window with excitement. A translucent window appeared just by thinking inwardly while looking at the empty space in front of me.\nBut\u2026.\nName: Rieul\nClass: Cafe Owner (F)\nStamina 100/100, Energy 100/100\nStrength: 8, Intelligence: 11, Agility: 9, Luck: 12\n\u201cWhat is thiiiiiiiis\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nActually there was nothing really surprising about it.\nThe average adult status for the general population was 10. In other words, strength and agility were below average, and intelligence and luck were slightly higher than average, but even so, they were at the level of ordinary people.\nThe problem lies on the other part. Even if it\u2019s a lousy F-class body, what\u2019s with the \u201cClass: Cafe Owner\u201d?\nI said that I wanted to be a cafe owner who hid her strength, but I didn\u2019t mean I just want to be a cafe owner. Great.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that too much?\u201d\nI grabbed my head and screamed, while Mieum patted me with her round front paws next to me.\n\u201cCalm down, I\u2019m hungry. Give me some food.\u201d\n\u201cAre you telling me to calm down now? At the most, the awakened ability is nothing, and I am trapped in such a strange place! I also didn\u2019t come here on my own will. How do i get out \u2026 Wait, Mieum, where are you going?\u201d\nWithout listening to me, Mieum turned her body around and started walking. When I rushed to follow after Mieum, a door appeared in the air where there was nothing until just now. Mieum swung her front foot at me.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not coming, I\u2019ll leave you behind.\u201d\n\u201cComing, let\u2019s go together for a second!\u201d\nAs soon as we passed through the door, a flash of light wrapped around us and returned us to the store. It wasn\u2019t a dream, as there was still a door leaking blue light on the wall.\n\u201cMeooow. I slept for a long time and I am hungry. Do you have anything to eat?\u201d\nMieum, sitting in the shape of a bread under the table as if it were her own house, cried out and asked.\nI was also getting hungry after cleaning all day.\nHowever, although this is a downtown in Seoul, it is in front of the great dungeon Abyss. There are no restaurants or convenience stores nearby, so it will take an hour to get something to eat. Even if I tried to order delivery, Dungeon Gate 3 was a delivery exclusion area.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nWhen I said that there was nothing to eat, Mieum pricked her ears and gave a surprised expression.\n\u201cThis eligible person is going to starve me to death!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on earth is eligible person?\u201d\n\u201cFood! I can\u2019t talk because I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\nMieum said she wouldn\u2019t say anything if I didn\u2019t give her food, and lay her stomach on the floor.\nIt\u2019s pretty cute, I can\u2019t stand it.\nI don\u2019t know if she was trying to make a stern face, but the cat sitting in the shape of a bread and crying for food was cute no matter how I look for it.\nFortunately, I found a box of cereal in the warehouse on the first floor. I was a little worried because the expiration date was erased on the box, but I don\u2019t think it will cause me death. I decided to fill my stomach with this.\nToo bad there\u2019s no milk. I found a suitable bowl and poured the cereal for Mieum.\n\u201cHmm, you want me to eat this crap?\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, give it back.\u201d\nI tried to clear the bowl of cereal. Then, Mi-eum hurriedly clung to my hand with her front feet.\n\u201cNo, this body will give it a special taste.\u201d\n\u201cYou say it\u2019s a crap?\u201d\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s crap, but I\u2019ll put up with this especially this time.\u201d\nContrary to what she said, Mieum buried her head in the bowl and ate all the cereal in an instant.\n\u201cMumumumummu \u2026 do you have any more of this?\u201d\nI wonder how deeply she put her head in the bowl, the cereal crumbs were clinging to Mieum\u2019s face.\n\u201c\u2026Come on.\u201d\nI poured more cereal into the bowl.\nWhile Mieum rustled and ate the cereal, I checked the status window once again.\nMaybe I was flustered earlier and misread the numbers. For example, I read a number with a zero removed. Yeah, how can you get such a terrible stats when you\u2019ve been awakened?\n\u201cWhoa, haaa\u2026.\u201d\nLet\u2019s calm down. I should read the numbers correctly this time.\nI looked at the screen with such hope.\nClass: Cafe Owner (F)\nStamina 100/100, Energy 100/100\nStrength: 8, Intelligence: 11, Agility: 9, Luck: 12\nNothing has changed. I shook my head and muttered.\n\u201cI\u2019ve awakened up to this point, but I didn\u2019t know it would be this lame.\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYou chose it yourself, why.\u201d\nMieum interrupted from the side.\nAfter eating two bowls or cereal, the full cat groaned. It was after she licked up the cereal crumbs on her front paws.\n\u201cWait, I chose it?\u201d\n\u201cYour awakening ability is an ability formed based on the system\u2019s test results.\u201d\n\u201cTest? I\u2019ve never done anything like that \u2026 huh, it the psychological test from before?\n\u201cMrrrrrrrrrraw!\u201d\nMieum cried sharply as her hair stood up. She swung her front paws and threw her fists at me.\n\u201cPsychological test! It is a traditional test to confirm the awakening ability suitable for the eligible person!\u201d\n\u2018Isn\u2019t that a psychological test?\u2018 I thought, but I had to listen to Mieum for more explanations, so I comforted her.\n\u201cMieum, good girl.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m an ordinary cat! \u2026\u2026 Meow.\u201d\nWhen I gently scratched the bottom of her chin with my hand, Mieum looked drowsy. As I fiddled more, a groaning sound leaked out. Then she explained in an arrogant voice.\nThere is a special energy called \u2018ether\u2018 in the world.\nI\u2019ve heard of Ether. Hunter supplies and weapons all contained ether, and the more ether is contained, the more expensive it is.\nAnd the awakened person can store this ether in their body and use the skill. In other words, only those with ether affinity can gain awakening.\nNevertheless, there was an exception.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nThe Awakener chosen by the system is called The Eligible. They are very rare, and they are given special abilities directly by the system.\nMieum said I was the right person.\nIt sounds like a really great explanation, but \u2026 what are the stats I actually got? Mieum added to me who was disappointed.\n\u201cYou got the ability according to the choice of Kwon Rieul.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nSo, the strange question that appeared on TV earlier was the process of choosing my awakening ability.\nIf I had known that was the case, I wouldn\u2019t have answered like that. I would have responded like an enterprising, passionate, experienced rookie just like I did when I wrote my cover letter.\n\u201cNo, do it again! I\u2019ll choose again, so let\u2019s do it again!\u201d\nI grabbed the TV and shook it. However, the screen doesn\u2019t turn on again. As a last resort, I pounded the back of the TV, but only my hand hurt.\nMieum, who looked at me as if I was something pathetic, spoke again.\n\u201cTtsutsutsu, it has already been decided and cannot be changed. Please check your skills.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Skill?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, didn\u2019t the notification that you got the skill popped up earlier? The exclusive skill granted by the system is the real ability of the Awakened.\u201d\nThat\u2019s right, I didn\u2019t see it closely earlier, but three skills appeared. The status looks like this, but the skills can be good.\nThere were many hunters who made a living using them because their status had good skills even at the level of ordinary people. Apparently, there were hunters abroad who were F-class, but famous for their A-class skills.\nI opened the skill window with anticipation. Three skills appeared in a translucent window, there were Cafe in My Hand (C), The Floor is Shiny (E), and Smile (C). I clicked the detailed description one by one.\nCafe in My Hand (C)Details: (Lv. 1) When making drinks in the store, the level of perfection is increased. Reserved Recipes: Mixed Coffee\nThe Floor is Shiny (E)Details: (Lv. 1) Cleaning toilets can be done quickly. \nSmile (C)Details: (Lv. 1) Smiling makes you feel better. \nIs this really the end?\nWhy is it like this \u2026 Unknowingly, I let out a sigh.\nI don\u2019t have any of those common self-healing or supporting skills!\nI\u2019m planning to open a cafe, so the \u2018Cafe in My Hand\u2018 skill is fine. However, even if it\u2019s a beverage making skill, the only recipe available is mixed coffee.\nAdditionally I received skill in cleaning the bathroom. What is the advantage of using skills to quickly clean the bathroom?\nThe last one is the Smile skill, so where can I use this? Maybe it has some hidden power?\n\u2018\u2026Smile.\u2019\nI tried the smile skill.\nSmile.\nThe tip of the lips is pulled naturally and a soft arc line is drawn. It\u2019s the perfect business smile.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAnd that was the end.\nJust smile and it\u2019s over. I didn\u2019t feel any better.\nI have all these useless skills.\nDamn, the price of being too honest with the test was bitter.\nHello, my daily easy life \u2026 that\u2019s what I wanted to do. Awakening doesn\u2019t seem to achieve it that easily.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a way.\u201d\nMieum patted the frustrated me with her front paw and started to speak.\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI actually still don\u2019t know the gender for the cat \u2026 because even the endearment being used is gender-neutral. I\u2019ll assume it as a female for now.\nOh, and I changed \u201cqualified\u201d to \u201celigible\u201d because The Eligible sounds better \ud83d\ude00\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

            "c3": "\nTranslated by cabinfourtranslations.\n\nThe letters passed quickly as if the screen was fast-forwarded.\nI tend to skip the whole story even when I play games. I don\u2019t know what it is, but it didn\u2019t seem like a big deal. It has nothing to do with me.\nSoon the letters were skipped and a new screen appeared, and this time there was an input window.\n\n\n[Name:\nAge:\nBlood type: ]\n\nAre you asking me to enter the answers? I can ignore it, but I was a little curious about what would come out.\n\u2018My name is Kwon Rieul, my age is \u2026 I was 26 years old before I returned to the past, so I am 23 years old. My blood type is O\u2026.\u2019\nI entered the answer by pressing the button on the television screen.\nThis strange television question continued.\n\n[Which of the following is the most important thing for you?]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney\nHonor\nPower\nRest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer, obviously, is number four.\nSure, money is important, but what\u2019s the use making money then dying without spending it? After all, money is also needed for number four.\nI didn\u2019t realize that until I died.\nAt least, I wanted to spend this life leisurely. I\u2019m going to take the route of the work-life balance that I\u2019ve only been hearing about.\n\n[What do you usually do on your day off?]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing self-improvement\nExercising\nSocializing\nResting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose number four again this time.\nWhen I had a day off, I was busy just making up for my lack of sleep.\nSelf-development? Exercising? At the most, the exercise equipment I ordered was tucked away in the closet without even opening the delivery box. Socializing? With only a few friends, I sporadically reported my survival through KakaoTalk.\n[You overslept on your day off, but your friend called you to meet them. What will you do?]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo out to meet the friend.\n\n\nAsk them to meet next time and continue sleeping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is undoubtedly number two. It\u2019s so important to oversleep.\nA few more silly questions followed. I don\u2019t know the intention of this question, but I chose the answer that I want to rest, relax, and play at all costs. It\u2019s like a psychological test.\n[The test is over] [Check the results]\nFinally, the last message appeared on the black screen, and a door suddenly appeared on the wall behind it.\nWhen I was cleaning a while ago, it was definitely a wall with nothing.\n\u2018Are you telling me to go in there?\u2019\n\u2026 Gulp.\nEven a bluish light leaked from the door. The strange aura, which looks different from the store\u2019s fluorescent lights, resembled a dungeon gate.\n\u2018It\u2019s not like a dungeon, is it?\u2019\nIn my previous life, I\u2019ve only entered a dungeon once when I was caught in a rift. And the result was death.\nIf there is a dungeon beyond this door, I never want to enter it. I cannot die again after only a few days have passed since I returned. Moreover, being stabbed in the stomach by a monster was extremely painful. It\u2019s an experience I don\u2019t want to repeat.\nI stepped back slowly in front of the door.\nBut at that moment.\n[We are waiting for a visit from the eligible person. Please open the door and check the result.]\nA beeping sound came from the television along with the message.\nWhat\u2019s more suspicious, the more I stepped backwards, the louder the sound became, and  I still could hear it even when I covered my ears.\nI shouted, shaking my head with my ears closed.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not going! I will not going in!\u201d\nI have dungeon trauma, and I am allergic to dungeon, and I am suffering from dungeon phobia. No, you can call it anything. I didn\u2019t want to go in there regardless.\n[We are waiting for a visit from the eligible person. Please open the door and check the result.]\nThis time, I heard the voice directly in my head. I was horrified by the strange feeling.\nWhat\u2019s beyond that door that keeps telling me to come in?\n\u201cShould I report it to the Dungeon Management Office?\u201d\nThere were several  emergency call numbers to urgently report a dungeon. Yes, it is best to leave the dungeon to the Hunter.\nHowever, as soon as I tried to take my cell phone out of my pocket, the floor vibrated with a woooh sound.\n\u201c\u2026.Whoaaa!\u201d\nI dropped my phone because of that, and it quickly went into a gap out of reach.\nThere was still a door emitting a bluish light in front of me.\nAs if entering the door was the only answer given to me.\nEr, I don\u2019t know anymore. It\u2019s a place where my grandmother used to live, so it\u2019s probably not something dangerous.\nIt was scary, but I honestly wondered what the outcome of this strange test was.\nAll right, once I open the door, and if I think a monster will come out, I\u2019ll run away quickly. I will just take a peek. If I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe, I\u2019ll head out.\nDetermined to do so, I closed my eyes tightly, opened the door, and went inside.\nAs soon as I opened the door, a bluish light wrapped around me and the landscape changed.\n\u201cUh?\u201d\nOnly the cold air touched my hand that was holding the doorknob. The door that had been here a while ago was gone.\nHuh, I\u2019m trapped.\nIt was impossible to head out because there was no door.\nThat strange television must have tricked me! After all, I should have reported it right away without opening the door \u2026 but who would have thought that the door would disappear altogether!\n\u201cAaargh, let me out! Save me!\u201d\n[We have confirmed the visit of the eligible person. Creating an agent.]\nI screamed, but all I could hear was a calm voice.\nWait, where does this sound come from in the first place?\nOnly then did I look around slowly, a little genuinely.\nThe place I entered was a lawn surrounded by forest. It was about twenty steps wide from end to end, and the dense forest was covered with thick fog and could not be seen.\nEven though it was past 7 in the evening., the blue sky and bright sunlight showed me that this place was a space.\nIt was a peaceful atmosphere compared to an usual dungeon full of tension. A gentle breeze blew from somewhere.\nIsn\u2019t this a dungeon?\nIn general, there were many indoor forms of dungeons that occurred in rifts, such as caves and tombs. I\u2019ve heard that sometimes there are structures that are uniquely exposed to the outdoors, but I\u2019ve never heard of a dungeon with the sun floating in the blue sky like this.\nStill, that\u2019s not the point. I had to find a way out wherever I was.\nI looked at the lawn to see if there was a hidden door, and that\u2019s when I noticed that there was a small flower bush here. There was a cat on a flat stone by the bush.\nThe cat with tricolored fur was taking a nap on the stone. The fur was smooth and the body ,with plenty of flesh, looked soft.\nDid the chat come through that door like me? As soon as I approached it carefully not to wake them up, I heard a voice in my head again.\n[I\u2019ve been waiting for your visit. Please name the agent.]\nWhat is an agent? Maybe this cat?\n\u201c\u2026.Name it? Are you asking me?\u201d\nI asked that, but there was no answer. Instead, a guide window appeared in front of me.\n[Enter a name:  ]\nIt was this mysterious message that called me here. Anyway, I guess I\u2019ll have to do what this message tells me to get out of here. With that in mind, I put my hand on my forehead and started contemplating the name.\nIt\u2019s a name for the cat\u2026.\nName for a cat \u2026 name for  cat \u2026 cat, meow\u2026.\n\u201cMeong?\u201d\nAfter all, this is the only right name for a cat. However, the system rejected it with a beep sound.\n[Agent rejects this name.]\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Meong?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a traditional cat\u2019s name.\n[This is an agent for you. Please think about it seriously.]\n[Enter a name: ]\nI was incredibly serious.\nI reluctantly thought of the name again, but couldn\u2019t come up with a good name. In the first place, I was a person with no sense of naming. Butterfly \u2026 no, it\u2019s a little out of place. Dumplings? nope, it\u2019s really bad. It has three types of hair color, three colors, umm \u2026. well\u2026..\nThen a name crossed my mind.\nHow about Mieum?\nMy name, Kwon Rieul, was given to me by my grandmother. \nThe meaning is literally Rieul. Giyeok, Nieun, Digeut, then Rieul. The name was given because I was my grandmother\u2019s fourth grandchildren, but I don\u2019t know why my older cousins aren\u2019t Giyeok, Nieun, and Digeut, yet I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s Rieul.\nOriginally, they were going to register my birth as \u2018Kwon D\u2019, but the civil service official rejected it and my name became \u2018Rieul\u2019.\nI don\u2019t even know your name or face, but thank you. You saved my name. The justice and duty of the civil service was there. I bowed my head in the direction that the community center was likely to be.\nAnyway, I thought the name Mieum would be good because it was a cat I found in this space of the store that my grandmother left me. It literally means Mieum after Giyeok, Nieun, Digeut, and Rieul. The word M.\n\u201c\u2026.Mieum?\u201d\nI was terrified that the tricky notification message would reject me again, but I couldn\u2019t hear anything anymore. Did it pass? Instead, Mieum opened her eyes in front of me.\n\u201c\u2026.Meooong!\u201d\nThe cat continued to stretch. The fur wiggled softly, and the round-tipped tail soared upward. The chin was round and the belly with plenty of flesh looked soft.\nIt\u2019s a cute.\nI forgot that I had been looking for the exit door just a while ago, and casually approached Mieum then reached out my hand. Can I touch your stomach? I was about to pat her plump belly with my fingers.\nTak.\nMieum, who slapped my hand with her front paw, looked at me with squinted eyes and said,\n\u201cUh-huh, don\u2019t touch me carelessly.\u201d\nI got scolded by a cat.\n\u201cEh?\u201d\nI turned my head in doubt at what I had just heard. Who just said that? but there was still only me and Mieum here.\n\u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cat. You can talk?\u201d\n\u201cMeow, do you think I\u2019m an ordinary cat? I was waiting for an eligible person to visit me as an agent running the system. I thought I was going to die waiting for you. Anyway, put your hand up here.\u201d\nMieum held out her round front paws. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but I wanted to touch the pink jelly on her front paw, so I held out my hand as I was told.\nAt that moment, a translucent window appeared in front of me with a tingling sound.\n[Checking the eligibilities \u2026 Completed. The system has been activated.]\n[Ability is granted according to the test result.]\n[Class: Awakened as a Cafe Owner (F).]\n[Skill: Cafe in my Hand (C) has been acquired.]\n[Skill: The Floor is Shiny (E) has been acquired.]\n[Skill: Smile (C) has been acquired.]\n[Achievement: Became a Beginner Cafe Owner.]\n[Quest: Start 100 cups of Mixed Coffee (0/100)]\nHuuh?\nI think \u2026 I am awakened now.\n[Next]\n\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nAbout the name, Rieul is the fourth consonant in Korean alphabets (Hangul) and Mieum is the fifth. The order is giyeok (\uae30\uc5ed), nieun (\ub2c8\uc740), digeut (\ub514\uadff) dieut, rieul (\ub9ac\uc744), then mieum (\ubbf8\uc74c). In English, it would be like naming your children A B C D E.\nMixed coffee is instant coffee.

I felt something strange after grumbling to myself for a long time.\nI\u2019m dead, so why is my consciousness this clear?\nThis cozy and soft feeling wrapped around my body was like the bed blanket in my room.\nPerhaps you will see flashing memories like a phantasmagoria the moment you die. Does a phantasmagoria mean that you can feel the texture so vividly?\nFurthermore, I couldn\u2019t sleep because the cell phone alarm rang loudly next to me. I waited for the phantasmagoria to end quickly and lose consciousness, but my mind became clearer and clearer.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s noisy\u2026.\u201d\nI finally woke up at the sound of the alarm. I could see the bed, the desk, and the messy interior of the room.\nI, I went back to the time before I died.\n***\nIt is said that it is the age of the Hunter.\nHunter, a capable man who exerts transcendent power through \u2018awakening\u2019, first appeared in the world 20 and 3 years ago.\nAnd they defeated monsters pouring out of dungeons from all over the world and restored peace to mankind.\nThe world raved about these saviors.\nChildren envied Hunter more than celebrities and sports stars. The largest Hunter Guild, called the Big 3, has a market capitalization that exceeds any large corporations, and every move of the top ranked hunters is in the news every day.\nIf you become a hunter, you can earn a lot of money and fame.\nMany people dreamed of becoming a hunter instead winning a lottery, and the educational institution established by the state to systematically train hunters recorded a competition rate of thousands to one.\nHowever, it has nothing to do with me.\nI am not awakened, nor am I knowledgeable about hunters or dungeons.\n[The veiled A-grade dungeon attacker \u2013 Big 3 Guild remains silent]\n[The salary  of attacking a dungeon is a billion won?]\n[Preparing for retirement with the legendary item farming!]\nThose articles didn\u2019t interest me at all. I don\u2019t care who attacks the dungeon. I have to go to work!\nThe company that I worked for from morning to night was a place where I can earn  monthly salary.\nOvertime pay? Of course there\u2019s no such thing. No meal. No annual leave. No weekend pay. I repeated this life of working overtime every day and barely getting on the last train to go home.\nI was unlucky that day. On that day, I was working overtime and on my way to catch the last train.\nBy the way.\n\u201cUgh, Aaaargh!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Dungeon! Someone, report it to the Dungeon Management Office!\u201d\n\u201cMiss! Be careful!\u201d\nIn front of the subway station, a rift, or a hole in the space that leads to a dungeon, suddenly appeared.\nWhen dungeons occur, the Dungeon Management Office blocks the general public from entering, and then cooperates with each guild to attack the dungeon. This is because if the dungeon boss is not defeated within the time limit, a dungeon break will occur and monsters will pour out from within.\nIt is common for dungeons to appear like this, so people evacuated in unison and contacted the authority.\nThe problem is that the rift happened at my feet. When I noticed it, my feet was already stepped on the rift. I was sucked into the dungeon.\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what happened in the dungeon. It might have erased from my memory because I was terrified. It was certain that I was chased by monsters and ran away.\nAnyway, I entered the dungeonas a normal person and died at the hands of a monster. I remember vividly the eerie feeling when the monster\u2019s front foot stabbed me.\nDungeon death on the way back home from the company. I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s such an unfair life. I grumbled that I could not close my eyes in peace because of anger. Grumbled is a mild expression, in fact I poured out numerous abusive language.\nBut when I opened my eyes, I was on the bed in my room. I went back to three years ago.\n\u201cEh?\u201d\nAt first I thought I was dreaming, then I was happy, and finally I was skeptical with this situation.\nWhy did I come back to life? I\u2019ve never heard of someone coming back to the past after being killed by a monster in a dungeon. It also goes back to three years ago.\nWhat does this mean? Is there anything I need to do in this second life?\nEh, I don\u2019t know.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s a great gain. Maybe the Dungeon took pity on my miserable life and gave me one more chance.\nAnyway, I decided to live my second life differently.\nBye to a life full of slavery suffocated by overtime work!\nGoodbye. I throw away all the shackles and restraints of this world and go for freedom!\n***\nIt took less than a few days to resign and organize my luggage.\nPerhaps it was regrettable that the slave escaped, the boss tried to prevent me, but I left without even listening his words. I had survived to the fullest, but I couldn\u2019t devote my youth to a black company like this.\nThe next place I headed was The White Silver Guild.\nWhen I opened the door of the guild chief\u2019s room, I saw Kwon Jiwoon looking through the documents.\nIt finally hit me. I\u2019m really back in the past.\nI called him with a warm welcome.\n\u201cOppa, long time no see.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon looked at me with eyes like he has seen a ghost.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on all of a sudden? Did you have an accident?\u201d\nWhat? Did you notice that I have returned? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s the same as usual? Do I have any marks on my face?\n\u201cAh \u2026 No, nothing happened?\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering why you suddenly giving me goosebumps. You never call me that.\u201d\nMy affectionate heart broke in an instant.\nYeah. I never did. That sarcastic tone made me realize that I had returned to the past.\nAfter my parents died when I was young, I lived with my uncle, and I grew up with my cousin Kwon Jiwoon.\nWe live separately now, but we stayed in the same house until we were 20. As there are no other siblings, we\u2019re like each other\u2019s only family.\nIt sounds like we\u2019re pretty close to each other, but in reality, we\u2019re not. Rather, our relationship was close to awkwardness.\nKwon Jiwon is the deputy guild leader of The White Silver Guild and an A-class healer. His alias is Eunrang.\nHe\u2019s a healer who ranked 12th in the country and he often appears on television. Due to his striking appearance, he is also often featured in Hunter magazine. It was all thanks to Kwon Jiwoon\u2019s fame that The White Silver Guild, which is smaller than the Big Three, was widely known. In addition, since my uncle, the guild leader, went missing a few years ago, he has been acting as the guild leader.\nAs such, Kwon Jiwoon was insanely busy. No matter how close I was  to him when when we were young, I had no choice but to feel distant from him as an ordinary person.\n\u201cDon\u2019t show any interest in Hunters or anything like that, and just stay as a normal person.\u201d\nIt was what Kwon Jiwoon often said when we met occasionally. Did he think I\u2019d ask him a favor?\nThat\u2019s why I got a job right away to show that I was doing well, but I didn\u2019t know it would be such a black company.\n\u2018Now that I think about it, it was pointless\u2026.\u2019\nI watched Kwon Jiwoon sitting across from the drawing room.\nKwon Jiwoon looked a little younger than I remember. I\u2019m 23 years old now, so he\u2019s \u2026 he must be 25 years old.\nDue to the influence of the healer skill, the hair that turned silver was very conspicuous. Although he has a colorful appearance, his expression is cold, and his eyes are slightly dark. He looked tired.\n\u201cI heard you quit your job.\u201d\nHe asked me after I looked at his face but didn\u2019t say anything for a while. Maybe someone from the guild has told him the news.\n\u201cLet me know if anything happens.\u201d\nAs if  he were tired, Kwon Jiwoon sighed softly.\nThere is no reason to go around in circles with boring greetings. I got straight to the point.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, but there\u2019s something I want to do after I quit the company.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to open a cafe.\u201d\nEven though I said that, I thought Kwon Jiwoon would naturally oppose it.\nWhat is it like to be self-employment? It\u2019s said that 100 people start and 99 people fail. In particular, jobs such as cafes with low entry barriers were often go bankrupt if they were set up without thorough preparation. If it\u2019s Kwon Jiwoon, there\u2019s more than enough reason to go against it.\nHowever, there was a reason that I wanted to open a cafe and nothing else.\nHow to persuade him? As I was thinking about such things, Kwon Jiwoon made an unexpected statement.\n\u201cSure? There\u2019s an empty spot on the first floor of our guild building. Let\u2019s open a cafe there.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh? No, there\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t like it? I can start emptying it tomorrow.\u201d\nOn the first floor of The Silver White Guild headquarters, it was a downtown area among the bustling streets, it was a place famous for high land prices in Seoul now.\nThis area where \u20a950,000 is an average price for a bowl of soup is a place where no matter how much coffee you sell, you cannot afford the rent. Usually there was a bank for hunters or a store that sold expensive hunter supplies.\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to worry about the rent. I have no intention of taking money from you.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon added as he guessed that it was the money that caused me to panic.\nI waved my hand in a hurry. I\u2019m not advertising that I\u2019m a cousin of the deputy guild leader, and it\u2019s burdensome to open a store in that location. We\u2019re not that close, so I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s suddenly making such a proposal.\nFurthermore, I already had a certain place in my plan.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve already decided the location.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Where is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s on the No. 16 Dungeon Gate 3 Street, Jung-gu, Seoul.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? That place is\u2026.\u201d\nKwon Jiwoon frowned at the address I told him.\n\u201cIt is in front of the great dungeon?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m going to open a cafe in front of the dungeon.\u201d\nI declared with a wide smile.\n***\nNo. 16 Dungeon Gate 3 Street, Jung-gu, Seoul\nIn other words, it was an address that pointed to the entrance of the great Dungeon, Abyss, in Jung-gu, Seoul.\nTwenty years ago, this space appeared in the middle of Seoul and a large dungeon appeared.\nThis tower-shaped dungeon continued endlessly high, unlike the instance dungeon that was created from rifts. If you attack one floor, a gate that leads to the next floor appears.\nAnd in front of this dungeon was also the place where the cafe run by my late grandmother was located. Of course, back then, it wasn\u2019t a questionable address called \u2018Dungeon Gate 3 Street\u2019, but an ordinary shopping street.\nThe surroundings were all demolished, and even though it wasa  downtown Seoul, there was only a lonely silence there.\nThat\u2019s why no one is going to live in front of a dungeon, with uncertainty that something will happen. Unless that person is like my grandmother.\nAfter the appearance of the great dungeon Abyss, the surrounding shops received government compensation and demolished their buildings, but my grandmother remained there. She kept her shop until the day she passed away, despite her children stopped her because it was dangerous.\nIt was the reason why I decided to open my cafe there.\nWhen I was young, whenever I went to my grandmother\u2019s cafe after school, she always made me a cup of hot coffee. The sweet taste and cozy space was definitely a precious memory.\nIn the past life, I left my grandmother\u2019s cafe empty because I was busy working at a company. The fact was weighed on my mind, and I wanted to restore it to the comfortable space it used to be.\nIn fact, there is also a realistic reason that it does not cost much money.\nAlthough it was old, the building of my grandmother\u2019s store remained intact. I\u2019m thinking of living on the second floor of the store, so I don\u2019t need to pay not only the store rent, but also my living rent. It\u2019s the perfect place to open a cafe with a small amount of money.\nThe last reason is that there are no people and it is a quiet place.\nAfter opening a cafe, why am I looking for a place where there are no people?\nThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m returned at best condition, but of course I don\u2019t have any intention to work hard.\nMost of all, I wanted to rest. In a cozy and comfortable cafe, just like when my grandmother was there.\nI don\u2019t need to have many customers. It is enough to sell coffee to hunters who sometimes want to enter the dungeon.\nA life where you work less and rest more. My goal is YOLO life.\n***\nAfter cleaning up my living room, I headed to my grandmother\u2019s cafe.\nThe abandoned building was very old. I couldn\u2019t see where the sign had gone, and there was a creaking sound every time a door was opened.\nThere was a lot of preparation that I need to do before the cafe can be opened.\nThe first step is cleaning.\nIt took a whole day to sweep and wipe the dust inside. It was difficult, but I felt much more comfortable than when I was working at the company.\nAs I got tired, I naturally gravitated towards coffee, but right now there was only instant coffee. I looked around as I drank coffee mix in a paper cup.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nBut there was a square television in a small room inside the store. Was it used by my grandmother?\nOut of curiosity, I looked around. However, there was no company mark on where it was made, and there was no power button.\n\u201c\u2026Whoa!\u201d\nAt that time, the lights turned on and letters appeared on the screen.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n[Checking your eligibilities]\n[We\u2019ve confirmed that you\u2019re eligible]]\n[You have finally come, the child who inherited the blood of the right person. I am the one in charge of the system, have been waiting for you\u2026..]\nI don\u2019t know what you mean. It\u2019s too long. I pressed [SKIP].\n[Next]\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s Corner:\nI hope you enjoy the story. This is a little bit different from the ones that I did before. The gaming slang is giving me a headache.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\n"

Real life player kill in the dungeon. \n\n\n[Information] Highly recommended good restaurants to the leveled hunters (136)\nUpvotes: 10 / Downvotes: 53\n\n\nWriter: HingHangHong\nHunters who were awakened in last month\u2019s B-Grade Instance Dungeon should know this much, so please beware.\n\nBurger King Guild, Jungang-dong BranchWhy a franchise in the first place???As you know, there are no good restaurants in front of the Hunter Guild. You\u2019ll be excited because it\u2019s a town where the buildings are brightly structured, but they\u2019ll charge you 50,000 for a bowl of soup.Now that you\u2019ve awakened, there must be some bugs who say that \u20a950,000 is cheap for a rice soup. Yeye.  It\u2019s \u20a95,000 for a refill of Radish Kimchi hahahahahaha The soup tastes like a pig\u2019s foot are soaked in it.  Don\u2019t waste your time and go to the franchise, yes.There\u2019s a two-story building in front of the back door of the Royal Guild Headquarters, the Whopper is so delicious.\n\n\nHyunwoo\u2019s One Meal3 minutes from the main gate of the Dungeon Management Office in Jongno 3-ga. Yep, I strongly recommend this restraurant to civil servant hunters.They serve a lot of side dishes, but the pork cutlet is delicious. If you don\u2019t go early, they run out and you can\u2019t eat it \u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160 I want to eat some too. Stop eating the pork cutlet.There are a lot of people, but if you say you\u2019re a Hunter, they will treat you well.For reference, this place runs by the head of the Emergency Dungeon Countermeasures team, A-Class Kang Hyunwoo\u2019s mother. If you pretend to  be a hunter in this place, it won\u2019t look good.There\u2019s a time when Kang Hyunwoo himself kicked out a C-Class for trying to sucking up to him here.\n\n\nEtermoreIf you look at the first two, you\u2019ll think I am a cheap person. Yep, sometimes you need to to eat expensive foods too. It\u2019s near the Hunter Market Apgujeong branch. Address 27 Market 2nd Street.It will be easy to find because the signpost smells like money, a place that refuses cheap people.It\u2019s expensive, but it has a good atmosphere and the dessert is served as a full course. It\u2019s nice place to talk because it\u2019s quiet when you get a room LOL Even if it\u2019s expensive, the wine is cheaper than a bottle of low-grade healing potion.Hunters belonging to C&L have a dinner party here.The Big 3 class is awesome \u3137\u3137.\n\n\nExtra.I don\u2019t know the name. There\u2019s a cafe in front of the Abyss Dungeon Gate.It\u2019s a neighborhood with nothing, but there\u2019s a cafe.There was something written on the sign, but I don\u2019t know what it meant.\n(Photo)\nHere.But the coffee is so delicious. I thought I was going to faint after taking one sip. I just ordered an Americano, but the smell is different.Try it. What should I say \u2026 anyway, it\u2019s super delicious.And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my mood,I drank two cups of coffee there and went to the dungeon to deal with the dungeon quest\u2019s mobs. I got hit because I missed my skill, but my stamina didn\u2019t wear out. It was an ice dungeon, but it wasn\u2019t cold; it\u2019s strange.\nOh, there\u2019s a cat in the cafe, it\u2019s so cute.\n\n\u2014 Hamster-jjang: Shut up with the food articles.\u2014 HaHa: If you go to the guild, you can eat hamburgers. Pork and rice soup costs \u20a950,000\n\u2514 Kim Seonghyeon: It costs \u20a980,000 for a Galbitang. \u2514 10th Year Hunter: I am a 10th year hunter and I only eat hamburgers when I go to the guild.\n\u2014 My Name is Hing: The food taste in Etermore has changed TT\u2014 BY THE WAY: Hyunwoo\u2019s pork cutlet is so delicious\n\u2514 OO: Isn\u2019t it famous for Kang Hyunwoo, not for the food?\n\u2514 dda***: What are you talking about, you bastard?\u2514 Buy me a Golem: Did you also get kicked by Kang Hyunwoo?\u2514 MM: God Hyunwoo ^^\u2514 arc: ***God Hyunwoo ^^\n\u2014 Weak-Jin: C&L was having a dinner party in Etermore? frickin envy;\n\u2514 Elixir Dasam: I hope there are no hunters who want to go to C&L after seeing this article. They thrown the B-class hunters into third-tier party and they don\u2019t even take the advanced dungeons. A structure that benefits only the long-term.\u2514 I love you Eunrang: Yeah, it\u2019s right. This story if famous.
