Rumour had it that they even suffered from pathological distrust.\nThe people of the Iberian royal family, therefore, always wore gloves, perhaps because they despised mingling with the common folk.\n\u201cThey must have done it to avoid any contact with the commoners.\u201d\nThere was no reason to spare any insults for the fallen royal family of Iberia. The people of the world seemed to have eagerly awaited their demise.\nThe newly risen royal family of Miltan, who had taken control of the Western Continent, regarded it with delight. After all, Iberia had been their enemy. The more the achievements of the fallen were trampled upon by the people, the better.\nOf course, such tales of the royal family held no significance when they reached the remote corners of the land.\nThe day was significant for a seventeen-year-old Lady Rida Yeoeng-ae, not because of the royal family\u2019s stories but because of the boy she met that day..\n***\n\u201cIt was a mere coincidence,\u201d said Lorna de Rida, a noblewoman of the aristocratic family, as she unexpectedly crossed paths with a carriage carrying slaves.\nThe carriage was passing through Rida\u2019s domain, a remote region of the empire. And within the iron bars of the window, the face of a child appeared forlorn.\nUnchildlike.\nThat was Lorna\u2019s initial thought upon seeing the child.\nThe dusty, lifeless grey hair seemed to have lost its vitality long ago. The child\u2019s eyes, hidden in the depths, were as dark as the abyss.\nPerhaps it was the unconventional appearance of the child that drew her attention. Perhaps it was the haunting memory of her younger sibling who perished at a tender age, intensified by the sight.\n\u201cI shall save that child,\u201d declared Lorna.\nThe gaze of the petite noblewoman, Lorna, fell upon the child.\nThe child\u2019s wrists were bound by shackles, stained with blood. The accumulation of dirt and dust on top of the bloody wounds was evident, suggesting that the child had been confined within the carriage, travelling throughout the empire for a considerable time.\n\u201cAh, finally someone has come forward to take this child. However, this child has some deficiencies. Are you certain you can handle it?\u201d inquired the coachman, recognizing Lorna\u2019s noble status, as he casually glanced at the child.\n\u201cDespite this youngster\u2019s attractive appearance, many noblewomen intended to adopt the child but eventually gave up,\u201d he continued.\nWhy? Lorna\u2019s gaze shifted towards the child.\nThe child\u2019s appearance was obscured by layers of dirt and dust. Lorna\u2019s gaze inadvertently fell upon the child\u2019s wounds once again, and then averted.\nSuddenly, the child was looking back at Lorna.\nSilent.\nThe child has sharp, piercing eyes. Though uncertain if it was an appropriate description for a child, the eyes were full of intensity directed towards her.\nA face brimming with liveliness that seemed to convey an intent to kill, despite the lips being bitten and blood already flowing. The child did not forget to glare at her as if it were about to take her life.\nSilent.\nLorna sensed dignity in that moment. It was self-respect and dignity that cannot be bought. Unconsciously, she whispered to the child.\n\u201cShame passes.\u201d\nThe coachman, engrossed in gossiping about the child\u2019s background, didn\u2019t pause for a breath. Half-listening, Lorna continued speaking.\n\u201cI oppose the institution of slavery.\u201d\nHowever, the child\u2019s face betrayed her lack of trust. She whispered once again.\n\u201cInstead of being trapped here, coming to me would offer more opportunities for escape.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThe child glared at Lorna, the young noblewoman who promised to save her.\nIs this person\u2019s words truly genuine?\nLorna never averted her gaze.\nThe child\u2019s face seemed slightly less hardened than before. Lorna whispered once more.\n\u201cShame is only temporary.\u201d\nThe child seemed to understand the meaning behind those words. Her gaze lowered.\n\u201cNo, what\u2019s the matter with this fellow?\u201d\nThe surprised servant exclaimed in confusion.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the type to surrender like this, has he finally grown tired? No, perhaps he hasn\u2019t eaten\u2026.\u201d\nThe servant, who initially spoke critically, now began spinning a favourable tale upon seeing Lorna\u2019s intent. Lorna interrupted the servant\u2019s words at an appropriate moment.\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\nEven when asked about the price, the child remained silent. The servant, finding it strange, raised a finger.\n\u201cOne gold, madam.\u201d\nAn amount too meager for the value of a person. However, the servant had a face that indicated a transaction had been made. Lorna extended one gold to the servant without hesitation.\n[Clang!]\n\u201cMake sure to prepare the shackles and assemble the knights at your residence! This young lady is not someone to be trifled with. No, it would be wise to summon the knights first.\u201d\nLorna tilted her head in response to the servant\u2019s words. The child stared intently at her, a gaze that still harboured some doubt.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLorna shook her head slightly, declining the servant\u2019s false kindness.\nWorried that she might refuse the noble\u2019s words, the servant hesitated before finally giving Lorna the key to the shackles and leaving the room.\nLydia, a maid who had been quietly standing by, unable to interrupt the conversation between the mistress and the servant, quickly stepped in front of Lorna.\n\u201cMiss, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nLorna fearlessly extended her hand to the child.\n[Clang]\nThe bloodstained shackles that had restrained the child fell to the ground. At that moment, their hands touched.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nStartled, the child quickly pulled her hand away from Lorna.\n\u201cI won\u2019t cause harm.\u201d\nEven with those words, the child merely widened her eyes and continued to gaze at her. But then, as Lorna extended her hand and remained still, the child eventually placed her hand on top of hers.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nAs if reading her thoughts, the child\u2019s gaze met hers, and only then did she let her guard down.\n\u201cFirst, let\u2019s go home and have a meal. Even if you\u2019re leaving soon, it\u2019s alright, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nHer dusty hand found solace in the gentle touch of Lorna\u2019s hand. Suddenly, she caught a glimpse of the child\u2019s hair.\nUpon closer inspection, the dust-laden grey strands revealed a shimmering golden hue.\n\u201cCome to think of it, didn\u2019t the illustrious Hwangga of the Obsessive Order have golden hair?\u201d\nLorna briefly entertained thoughts of a noble golden lineage from a neighbouring country, only to dismiss them from her mind. The recent upheaval in the Empire had mercilessly severed all ties to the Hwangga\u2019s lineage, leaving no reason to associate this child with such matters.\nThe vanished Empire of Miltan held silver hair in the highest regard.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nThe child cautiously followed Lorna\u2019s lead.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Even though she hadn\u2019t been a child, Rida considered her as a problem..\nTo Rida, she was merely a presence that generated useless rumours within the family.\n\u201cIf you lose interest, send her away. She\u2019s nothing more than a dusty nuisance.\u201d\n\u201cI did the same thing as you.\u201d\nThe sorceress\u2019s stepmother had no intention other than to plunder Rida\u2019s wealth.\nAnd she was the person who despised Lorna the most, alongside Rida.\n\u201cCursed.\u201d\nThat was a tale Lorna had heard since she was five. From the moment the priest pressed the cross against her, claiming she was a child forsaken by the gods because divine magic did not respond to her.\nThe eyes of her parents, those self-proclaimed guardians, were fixated on Lona\u2019s back.\n\u201cIt seems like dust is swirling around you, child.\u201d\nHer stepmother, the Countess, sneered at the knight.\n\u201cConfine those dusty things in the room. Let them at least have a chance to gather some body hair in my dust pit.\u201d\nCoughing, the Countess exaggeratedly coughed, turning her gaze towards Lona. Her eyes clearly contained a sense of pity.\n\u201cYes!\u201d\nThe knight\u2019s arm grasped Lona\u2019s arm harshly. There was no trace of respect in the knight\u2019s actions.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nLona\u2019s mouth opened slightly. The arm that was tightly pulled caused a dull pain to shoot through her. But the knight dragged her through the corridor as if she were a criminal.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nAnd so, Lorna let go of the child\u2019s hand. In an instant, she was startled and turned to look at the child.\nAnd there, she discovered a child who glared at the knight with a more fierce gaze than when she was trapped between the iron bars of the carriage.\nThe child\u2019s eyes were fixed on the knight, as if seeing something different in him.\nThat gaze resembled that of a wounded young beast.\n\u201cEnter!\u201d\nThe words were merely a form of deference. The knight threw Lorna into the room as if she were nothing, grabbing the back of the child and tossing her into the room.\n\u201c!\u201d\nStartled, Lorna unconsciously caught the child in her arms.\n[Thud!]\nThe child that flew and the one who caught her rolled on the floor, embracing each other. As the impact reached her back, her whole body tingled.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\n[Clang!]\nThe knight closed the door without hesitation.\n\u201cCursed\u2026\u201d\nEven saying it like that, she heard it clearly.\nAfter they left, Lorna looked at the child.\n\u2018It\u2019s just another usual occurrence. I\u2019m not bothered.\u2019\nBut the child seemed surprised.\n\u201c\u2026You can leave whenever you want.\u201d\n\u201cThe Cursed Manor\u201d\nThis place was how Lorna referred to it. Even if God did not answer her prayers, she believed that He had not abandoned her.\n\u201cIf God had abandoned me, then He would not have allowed me to be born.\u201d\nWithin her, it was a long-gone thought.\n\u201cThe cursed manor.\u201d\nLorna closed her eyes and opened them once again.\n\u201c\u2026Or perhaps, I could stay here.\u201d\nThis place was not a favourable environment for a child. However, it was better than the streets and the iron bars of that carriage.\nIt was a pure act of kindness. Kindness that did not benefit her.\nBut sometimes, she thought it was okay.\nTo her, it was a small act of kindness to give her a corner of a room, but it wouldn\u2019t be the same for the child.\nWhat could this young child have done wrong to become a slave? Perhaps they were the children of slave parents. That was their only choice.\nLorna despised the slave system as she had told the child. She couldn\u2019t help but recall the countless slaves who were beaten by her father in her place. The children her age had their bones broken, their bodies swollen and reddened, covered in blood as they were carried away.\nThe reason behind all these atrocities was one.\nLorna was a cursed person, abandoned by divine magic.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe child stared intently at Lorna. Then nodded.\n\u201cWash this child first.\u201d\nAmong the maids, there was only one who followed Lorna. The mother of that maid, Lin, had been close to Lorna\u2019s own mother.\n\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d\nThe servants who received some wages in the house and the slaves who were treated as less than human were clearly of different status.\nHowever, Lin, the maid, took the child\u2019s hand without hesitation in response to Lorna\u2019s command. She gently led the child to the bathroom with a soft touch.\nThe child did not resist. Instead, the child spoke to Lorna.\n\u201cI will not forget this favour.\u201d\nIt was the first words the child had ever spoken. The child\u2019s eyes were still as deep and dark as before, but they were staring straight at Lorna.\nThe hostility had vanished.\nLorna nodded her head without knowing the meaning of the child\u2019s favour.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\nShe thought it was just a passing remark.\n\u201cMy name is Nabel.\u201d\nHaving said that, the child, who was not like a child, entered the bathroom.\n\u201cThis is a name I am telling only to you.\u201d\nHe whispered in a low voice, tracing the clean floor with his scar-covered feet.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel, now coming out of the bathroom, had ebony-black hair cascading down. And there, glimmering around his neck, was a peculiar necklace. It was certainly something Lorna hadn\u2019t seen before.\nWhat caught Lorna\u2019s attention was that Nabel\u2019s attire was too large for his slender figure. The garment he wore was a new bathrobe that Lorna\u2019s maid, Lin, had prepared for him.\n\u201cNabel\u2026\u201d\nLorna whispered his name in a hushed voice, now that she could truly see him after he had finished bathing.\nWith no traces of dust or blemishes, Nabel looked nothing like a slave but rather resembled a nobleman. The wounds on his wrists and neck were unmistakably recent. The skin beneath them was pristine, unmarked as if he hadn\u2019t endure any hardship.\nThis was certainly not the skin of a commoner.\nNabel seemed to have heard her faint voice. He gazed down at her silently.\n\u201cI am Lorna De Rida.\u201d\nSeventeen years old, the accursed young lady of the Count De Rida. The person waiting in the temple for a divine oracle.\nMore precisely, the person awaiting a verdict.\nShe was registered at the temple as someone who rejected the touch of the gods, as a person defying their divine intervention, according to her stepmother, the Countess.\nAnd someday, the temple would respond. It would reveal the true nature of this peculiar existence\u2014someone who could not wield the empty magic that the divine spells possessed.\n\u201cDe Rida\u2026\u201d\nNabel mumbled, a surname that revealed nobility.\nDespite her young age, she seemed to know about it. Lorna examined Nabel intently. She appeared younger than her.\n\u201c\u2026.It\u2019s just a meaningless surname. You saw it outside earlier.\u201d\nLorna gestured towards the entrance. It was where those people who claimed to be his parents stood. Nabel glanced at the door briefly before returning his gaze to her.\nHis parents never tolerated his tantrums and tears, expecting him to mature early.\nAs she endured in the mansion, awaiting the temple\u2019s verdict, she had to become an adult prematurely.\n\u201cBut how old are you?\u201d\n\u201cI am twelve years old this year.\u201d\nNabel replied.\nDid twelve-year-olds typically speak like that? Lorna tilted her head slightly.\n\u201cI am seventeen.\u201d\nOf course, seventeen didn\u2019t suit him either. The gazes of these two individuals, far beyond their years, met.\n\u201cA five-year age difference. You\u2019re my older sister.\u201d\nUpon hearing Nabel\u2019s words, Lin was startled.\n\u201cOh, no, you can\u2019t say that!\u201d\nShe immediately covered Nabel\u2019s mouth and spoke vehemently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that you\u2019re a compassionate person, but how dare you address a slave by the name of a noble\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Lin,\u201d Lorna intervened, preventing her from speaking further. After all, everyone knew she was Lady Ada, the Countess in name only. Even the unfamiliar faces in high society were aware of it.\n\u201c\u2026,\u201d Nabel looked at her with bewildered eyes.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask anything?\u201d a stern voice rang out. Lorna tilted her head slightly.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cHow I ended up as a slave.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s words made Lorna lower her head.\nShe seemed to know without asking. His parents must have been slaves. He wouldn\u2019t have committed any wrongdoing at such a young age.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to inquire about a painful past.\u201d\nAnd his life hadn\u2019t been a happy one either. Nabel\u2019s words caused her eyes to widen slightly.\n\u201c-Then, do you trust me?\u201d\nHer tone softened a little. It was the moment for Lorna to respond. Nabel spoke up.\n\u201cThe slave\u2019s words are true. I attacked people. Those who tried to kill me.\u201d\nBut still, do you trust me?\nOn what grounds do you believe in me and let me enter your sanctuary?\nNabel\u2019s eyes posed these questions.\nLorna\u2019s small sanctuary. Within the grand estate, her sanctuary consisted of just this shabby room. The door creaked without even being oiled.\nIf danger infiltrated even this place, her sanctuary would vanish.\nAlthough Nabel had only just arrived here, he quickly understood this fact. It wasn\u2019t just because he had a keen intuition.\nWith eyes that belied his youthful appearance, he was already familiar with the enemy.\n\u201c\u2026,\u201d Nabel silently gazed at Lorna.\nShe was the one who showed kindness without hesitation. He didn\u2019t know if it was due to her youth or for some other reason.\nBut she seemed devoid of malice. It was simply pure kindness. That intrigued him and seemed unusual.\nShe was a person of a different kind, one Nabel had never encountered before.\n\u201c\u2026I am a dangerous person, sister.\u201d\n\u201cHe spoke in a low voice, reminiscent of a small creature, emitting a growling sound.\nLorna suddenly recalled the gaze of Nabel, the knight who had faced her before. Just like back then, he resembled a wounded young beast.\nConcealing his wounds, he stood there with his fur bristling.\nLike a young creature on guard, warning not to come any closer.\n\u201cThe truly dangerous ones don\u2019t speak like that.\u201d\nLorna knew this because there was a truly dangerous person inside the mansion.\nThe viscountess, who had approached with a smiling face, turned hostile towards Lorna as soon as she realized that divine magic didn\u2019t respond to her. It was an incident that occurred when Lorna was six years old.\nThat was when it happened.\n\u201cLorna!\u201d\nA shattered voice screamed through the corridor, resonating sharply. Startled, Lorna turned towards the door.\nIt was her stepmother\u2019s call.\u201d\n***\nLorna couldn\u2019t ignore the Countess\u2019s command. If she didn\u2019t go willingly, the knights would have to be mobilized to drag her away.\nLorna seemed to know why the Countess was summoning her. It was something that happened often.\nThe only difference this time was that Nabel followed behind Lorna. Despite the command not to come, Nabel remained unfazed.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nOn the way to the Countess\u2019s chamber, Nabel handed her a handkerchief.\nIt was the handkerchief that had been in her room.\nNo, upon closer inspection, it was more like Nabel\u2019s hand, wrapped in the handkerchief, reaching out to hold Lorna\u2019s hand. That\u2019s when Lorna realized she was trembling.\n\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d\nLorna spoke softly.\nShe had always avoided her, but she was afraid. Her stepmother, capable of anything, had more than enough power to harm her. Fear was only natural.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Whether it was because of Nabel\u2019s supportive hand or the fact that he wasn\u2019t alone with the presence of Nabel behind her, she couldn\u2019t tell.\nDespite knowing that nothing would change.\n\u201cAgain! It\u2019s because of you again!\u201d\nEven before reaching the Countess\u2019s chamber, a hysterical voice poured down on Lorna from above. In the distance, three bracelets jingled on the Countess\u2019s sleeve inside the room.\nThe meaning of a magician dwelling on the third step.\nThe third step among the nine steps leading to the gods. It was a relatively low position, but what was certain was that she was a magician.\nOne who embarked on a journey with the power of the gods, a magician.\nAn absolute devotee of the gods.\n\u201cOminous creature! Every time I talk to you! You can\u2019t reach the gods!\u201d\nIn short, it meant that the magic didn\u2019t work. Her voice echoed through the corridor, causing servants of all kinds to emerge from every nook and cranny of the corridor.\nThe servants murmured.\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting again.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, with that cursed body, without any sense, to my lady\u2026\u201d\nTheir curses were directed at Lorna without exception. Nabel\u2019s gaze swept over them.\n\u201cBut who is that girl?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d\nThe servants chattered, whether Lorna and Nabel heard or not. Lorna\u2019s footsteps hastened as she crossed between them.\n\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d\nIt was then. The countess let out a loud cry, causing Lorna to startle as her gaze reflexively shifted upwards.\nThe countess had conjured a brilliant enchantment. Despite claiming it wouldn\u2019t work, it had evidently been restored.\n[Boom!\nA fiery mass surged towards Lorna in an instant. Startled, Lorna instinctively shielded Nabel\u2019s body.\nNabel, nestled in her embrace, widened his eyes.\n[Crash!]\nThe mass of flames collided with Lorna\u2019s body.\nThe searing hot air that enveloped her was undeniably real. Lorna tightly shut her eyes, enduring the heat.\nIt would only be a moment. This momentary ordeal would soon come to an end.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThe handkerchief that once separated their hands dropped silently to the ground. As their hands made contact, a faint white light shimmered.\nOnly Nabel could perceive it with his eyes. Naturally, it remained invisible to Lorna.\nWith closed eyes, Lorna trembled as she held Nabel.\n\u201cSister.\u201d\nSurprised, Nabel tried to free himself from her embrace. However, Lorna refused to let him go. The surrounding flames gradually receded.\nShhhh!\nFamiliar with such situations, the attendants of Lady Rida, the countess, hurriedly brought buckets of water and poured them around the two.\nIn the chilling water that instantly sharpened their senses, Lorna\u2019s deep pink tresses clung wetly and cascaded down. Trembling in the face of the approaching cold, Lorna finally released Nabel.\nShe knew the maids would bring water.\n\u201cYoung miss!\u201d\nEven though the flames had extinguished, the dousing of water continued without pause.\nAs if trying to wash away something impure.\nLin, who had been dragged away by the knights, rushed over to them.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nLorna asked a question that Nabel wanted to ask. After all, it was you who took the hit from the magic.\nHe watched Lorna. Despite being soaked, she seemed okay.\n\u201cMagic rejects me..\u201d\nLorna laughed. A droplet fell from her chin, into the water.\nNabel blinked. His tears mirrored his non-red cheeks.\n\u201cNow you finally look a bit cleaner.\u201d\nThe countess\u2019s raspy voice echoed through the corridor. It almost sounded like laughter.\n\u201cTsk\u2026 Let\u2019s go. We should eat something sweet in the garden.\u201d\n\u201cYes, madam.\u201d\nThe handmaidens cleared the buckets of water and stood in line behind the countess. Their gazes touched and retreated from Lorna, their eyes brimming with a mixture of emotions.\n\u201cShame is but a fleeting moment,\u201d Nabel recalled the words Lorna had spoken when she had pleaded for his rescue. They were words directed at Nabel himself.\nShame is but a fleeting moment.\nNabel felt as though he would never forget Lorna\u2019s face, drenched in water, forever etched in her memory.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s gaze dropped to Lorna\u2019s deep shadow. In that moment, Nabel\u2019s eyes widened.\nShe saw something swiftly dart into Lorna\u2019s shadow.\nPointed, twitching ears, and a swishing tail. The tail even seemed to appear plush.\n\u201cA fox\u2026?\u201d That\u2019s what Nabel thought at that instant, but just as quickly, Lorna\u2019s shadow faded away.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel alternated between gazing at their hands and Lorna\u2019s face.\n\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s words made Nabel nod. Although they should be concerned about themselves. Nabel\u2019s lips closed tightly in a straight line.\nThey never held hands with anyone else.\nAs Nabel thought about this, they looked at Lorna\u2019s hand again. They didn\u2019t like their own hands.\nJust like all the other deceased family members.\n\u201cWill it be alright?\u201d\nA tender voice echoed in Nabel\u2019s mind. Nabel looked at their hands clasped with Lorna once again. It was the sound that flowed in through that connection. The white light that only they could see sparkled once more.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel thought of many people. The image of those who didn\u2019t know what it meant for their hands to touch.\nIn their minds, there was nothing but falsehood. Hatred and lies.\nAll for their own benefit.\nBut Lorna was different.\n\u201cA peculiar person.\u201d\nLorna was a strange person who didn\u2019t take care of themselves as a matter of course.\nThat\u2019s why it worried Nabel.\n\u201cMagic doesn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d\nThey said so\u2026 In the whispered words in their ear, the scent of dried roses lingered. Just like her murky pink hair.\n\u201cPlease have a seat here, young lady.\u201d\nUpon arriving at Lorna\u2019s room, the maid, Lin, came in carrying a first aid kit. And she looked at Lorna.\n\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d\nEven though magic didn\u2019t work, they would have still felt the heat of the flames. It was when Lorna was about to shake her head.\nNabel, who had been watching Lorna\u2019s hand all along, gently lifted her sleeve.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nLorna tried to hide it without realizing it. The burn mark that had turned red underneath her hand.\nIt was her instinct not to reveal any injuries.\nIf she, who dared to refuse the gods and had magic that didn\u2019t listen, got hurt, the people in the mansion would secretly be pleased.\n\u201cIs this not God\u2019s punishment?\u201d\nHe spoke with conviction. He disliked seeing them laugh, so he concealed it from others.\nBut now there was no need for such concealment. Lorna\u2019s grip loosened on his sleeve as he was about to pull it down.\n\u201c\u2026Nabel.\u201d\nAt the sound of her calling his name, Nabel widened his eyes. Lorna\u2019s voice resonated with a peculiar resonance that reached him.\n\u201cThey said you\u2019re a dangerous person.\u201d\nLin, with a sorrowful expression, silently applied ointment to her arm. Observing this, Lorna spoke.\n\u201cI\u2019m not more dangerous than this place.\u201d\nUpon hearing her words, Nabel unknowingly clenched his hand tightly.\n\u201cHey, you take a look too.\u201d\nLin thoroughly examined Lorna\u2019s body, then turned her gaze to Nabel.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel slightly lowered his head. It was a refusal. However, upon seeing the scorch marks on Nabel\u2019s sleeve, Lin became agitated.\n\u201cThose scars won\u2019t fade easily. Come on.\u201d\nLin tried to raise Nabel\u2019s hand. Just as their hands were about to touch, Nabel instinctively swatted away Lin\u2019s hand.\n[Thump!]\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nStartled by his clear refusal, Lin flinched.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nNabel seemed surprised as well.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t harm you, Nabel.\u201d\nTaking a deep breath as if relieved upon hearing Lorna\u2019s words, Lin regained composure. Nabel, the voice calling him so, once again strangely imprinted itself in his mind.\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s alright, if it hurts, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\nEven so, Nabel still declined Lin\u2019s hand. His words were much more courteous than before. It was as if he was being rough with the person who had shown him kindness, unintentionally.\nPerhaps sensing remorse in his subdued voice, Lin nodded her head. She thought to herself that Nabel must have been greatly startled, like a child.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\nLin responded to Nabel and nodded her head towards Lorna.\n\u201cMiss, I\u2019ll bring new clothes right away.\u201d\n\u201cPlease do.\u201d\nAs Lorna distanced himself, Nabel glanced back. He had his hands tightly clenched, where he had collided with Lin\u2019s hand when he brushed it away earlier.\n\u201cDo you dislike physical contact that much?\u201d Lorna inquired, unable to think otherwise.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel started to nod, then closed his mouth. He looked up at Lorna.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d\n\u2026It could be a secret.\nLorna turned her head to show respect for Nabel.\nBut Nabel wasn\u2019t finished speaking.\n\u201cNevertheless, I\u2019ll tell you, and only you.\u201d\nNabel took a step closer to her. He gently placed his hand on her hand as she sat in the chair.\n\u201cWhen our hands touch like this,\u201d his voice resonated softly.\n\u201cI can hear other people\u2019s thoughts.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lorna exclaimed, wide-eyed.\nLorna had never spoken those words aloud, but Nabel laughed as if he had heard her.\n\u201cThat surprised voice of yours reached my ears just as it is. The deeper our hands touch\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s hand shifted slightly from Lorna\u2019s dorsum to her palm.\n\u201cThe more profound their thoughts become audible.\u201d\nLorna parted her lips slightly, astonished. Nabel smiled at her surprise.\n\u201cI only share this with you, Lorna. If it becomes known, I\u2019ll end up dead.\u201d\nIn that instant, Lorna\u2019s shadow darkened. Neither of them noticed the pointed ears and stiff, raised tail that hinted at vigilance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Lorna, it\u2019s me.\u201d\nHow shall I bring harm to the saviour who rescued me?\nNabel was someone who understood the importance of gratitude, given the multitude of enemies he had.\nThrough Lorna\u2019s hand, he could hear her thoughts clearly, which he knew must be kept secret.\n\u201c\u2026Some people may not be susceptible to divine magic. There may be others with different abilities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Though such a situation was unlikely, she swore never to betray Lorna, who had shown her immense kindness.\n\u201cAh\u2026?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened. Nabel smiled, and once again their hands touched.\nUnbeknownst to Lorna, her hand was the first hand Nabel willingly grasped in her entire life.\n***\n\u201cI am a dangerous man.\u201d\nContrary to his earlier statement, Nabel remained silent, as if his words had evaporated into thin air. However, his voice only found expression in front of Lorna, within the confines of Lady Rida. In the presence of others, particularly the Countess and the Count, he held his tongue.\nInstead, he sent forth hostile glances.\n\u201cWhat a rude creature!\u201d\nLydia did not appreciate Nabel\u2019s piercing gaze.\n\u201cGet rid of that insolence!\u201d\nShe commanded her knights to expel Nabel. However, Lorna did not allow him to be dragged away without putting up a fight.\n\u201cMother has no right to drive this child away.\u201d\nIt was a valid argument, as Lorna had acquired Nabel as her slave. Being his mistress, she had the power to keep him unless she desired otherwise.\nWhile it would have been fitting to banish Lorna, the inhabitants of the mansion were unable to do so.\nThey were awaiting the temple\u2019s response to the \u201caccursed one.\u201d Ever since they had discovered this \u201cabomination,\u201d the temple, traditionally sensitive to heresy, had advised, \u201cIf you encounter something unusual, do not divulge it to the world, but wait.\u201d\nPerhaps due to this warning or for some other reason, Lorna was still allowed to stay in the mansion.\n\u201cWell then, pluck out those insolent eyes!\u201d\nOn a day when magic seemed to fail, the Countess resorted to casting a spell upon Nabel.\nThis time, it was not a fireball, but a lightning spell. A small thundercloud formed in the corridor, and a bolt of lightning struck down upon Nabel.\n[Crack!]\nAlthough the Countess\u2019s magical prowess was far from impressive compared to that of a sorcerer, it was sufficient to harm a young child.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nAs soon as the Countess\u2019s expression grew menacing, Lorna shielded Nabel. Thanks to her, the only damage they incurred was a small scorch mark on Lorna\u2019s clothing.\n\u201cSister.\u201d\nNabel clenched his fist so tightly that his small hand turned pale.\nNeither Lorna nor Nabel sustained any injuries, yet his eyes grew even darker.\nHe had proved to be just as treacherous as Lorna had warned.\nThere was only one servant, named Lin, who was kind to Lorna in this hostile place.\nIn this isolated setting, they only had each other to rely on.\n\u201cThis is the mansion of Lord Tuna, whom we all faithfully serve.\u201d\nTuna, the deity whom they served so faithfully.\nRida, the Count\u2019s captain of the knights, spoke with a raised chin.\nThe disdainful gaze cast upon Lorna carried a sense of contempt. The deference given to Lorna was solely due to her social status, devoid of any genuine respect.\nThat label of being \u201cimpure\u201d attached to her in the temple would vanish soon enough.\n\u201cSo, please refrain from causing a disturbance. Do you understand?\u201d\nBam!\nAfter Lorna was struck by Lady Beckworth\u2019s lightning instead of Nabel, Knight Commander Devent effectively confined the two of them inside the room.\nThough it was unclear whose orders it was, there was no one in the mansion who disliked the situation.\n\u201cWho is the author?\u201d\nNabel observed Lorna\u2019s charred clothing. Then, Nabel surveyed the rest of Lorna\u2019s body.\nThankfully, there were no visible injuries.\nThat was fortunate, but it saddened Nabel. It was the sight of her taking her safety for granted.\nThe reason being that she was uninjured.\nHowever, Nabel understood.\nThat harm was not limited to physical wounds.\n\u201cKnight Commander Devent.\u201d\nLorna looked out the door as she spoke. Lin, the servant, swiftly moved to bring her fresh attire.\n\u201cKnight Commander Devent\u2026\u201d\nWith a tone that hinted at remembering, Nabel\u2019s voice was low and chilling.\n\u201cShe\u2019s the person brought by Mother.\u201d\nHe severed ties with Lorna, who had dared to refuse the touch of the deity, an act of utmost audacity.\nTo \u201csend such a thing\u201d back to the deity\u2019s side for rebirth!\nAs if surprised that such a thing existed, Derant\u2019s voice contained contempt. Was she not rejecting magic by doubting the existence of the deity?\n\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s chilly gaze pierced through the door.\n\u201cMiss.\u201d\nAt that moment, Lin approached. She had gone to fetch the clothes but returned empty-handed. With an apologetic face, she bowed her head.\n\u201cThe clothes you will change into are not completely dry yet. Could you wait for one more hour?\u201d\nLin didn\u2019t know what to do. However, Lorna willingly nodded her head. The reason for lacking clothes was not due to Lin\u2019s negligence in her duties.\nIt was because the other servants only brought in dusty and worn items into this room. It was their fault, not Lin\u2019s. Lin skillfully washed and mended them to make them appear as new clothes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\nLorna nodded briefly, and Lin once again lowered her head.\nShe was someone who knew how to alleviate the atmosphere when it became heavy.\nFor the sake of her young and noble mistress, she spoke with a lively voice.\n\u201cBy the way, I heard from the other servants.\u201d\nStepping aside slightly, Lin prepared a teacup and tilted the water pitcher. She was ensuring that the mistress wouldn\u2019t become bored during the hour.\nNabel\u2019s gaze shifted towards Lin, then back to Lorna.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThey say that the Emperor of the Western Continent has changed.\u201d\nNabel faltered for a moment.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Lin nodded her head in agreement.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. However, that emperor was killed in a rebellion, and his younger brother ascended the throne.\u201d\n\u201cSo, another rebellion has occurred\u2026\u201d\nLorna nodded her head. It wasn\u2019t an entirely cheerful tale to share with the young mistress, but Lin\u2019s exposure to stories within the mansion was limited as well.\nThe other maids had no fondness for Lin, who served Lorna.\n\u201cYes. It seems that division continues to plague Miltan from within.\u201d\nWith the tea leaves neatly arranged, Lin then inclined herself toward Lorna\u2019s hem.\nHer skill in trimming away the blackened portion and refining it was not a novice\u2019s handiwork.\nLorna handed her dress to Line with a regretful expression.\nNabel watched them, lost in thought.\n\u201cStill, if there are no individuals to drive out Miltan, then the ruler of the Western Continent will be determined from among the people of Miltan.\u201d\nLin\u2019s hand movements were swift. She continued to spin tales of trivial matters.\nStories about the legendary forest at the edge of the Western Continent or the undulating sea at the far end of that land.\nNeither Lin nor Lorna had ever laid eyes on those places, as they were both from the inland regions.\n\u201cThere, all dried up and clean.\u201d\nBy the time the story ended, Lorna\u2019s dress had completely dried.\n\u201cYou must not follow.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s expression remained sunken.\nNaturally, he had no intention of following Lorna as she changed her clothes.\nHe made it clear that he would step back.\nAs Lin ushered Lorna into a small room for dressing, she raised an eyebrow.\nShe had lived her whole life as a maid serving nobles. Her mother had as well. She was accustomed to the behaviours expected of the nobility.\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\nIn her eyes, Nabel\u2019s manners and poised movements were anything but those of a slave.\nAt the very least, they belonged to the nobility.\n***\nThat night, the moonlight streamed through the window, casting an unusually bright glow. Nabel stood by the window, quietly gazing at the clouds drifting by.\n\u201cDo you want to go outside?\u201d asked Lorna abruptly. Nabel raised his head, hesitated, and then spoke.\n\u201c\u2026Ah, if you wish to go out.\u201d\nLorna realized there was room for misunderstanding in her words.\n\u201cNot me, but you. You keep looking outside the window, as if you long to walk outside.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s heart had been pounding fiercely until that moment, as if filled with tension. But it quickly subsided upon hearing Lorna\u2019s words.\n\u201cShall we go out, then?\u201d\nIt was nighttime anyway, a time when even the servants of the manor were mostly asleep.\n\u201cAlright. I, too, wanted to breathe the outdoor air.\u201d\nLorna replied.\nUpon hearing their conversation, Lin quickly prepared to leave the room. She fetched a small lantern with a flickering flame and placed a cardigan over Lorna\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cThe outdoor air is still chilly.\u201d\nSpring was transitioning into summer. Lorna nodded in agreement.\nNabel was also given a suitable outer garment. Although it was old, there were clothes prepared in Lorna\u2019s room for Nabel, the young boy who had come to stay. It was a small change that occurred when he arrived.\nThunk.\nIt was the moment Lin opened the door.\nCreak.\nA sound of something being caught in front of the door. Lin flinched, and Lorna\u2019s eyes widened.\nNabel witnessed how Lorna\u2019s shadow grew darker in that instant.\nAs the pointed ears became visible, the shadow, like a lie, vanished again.\nNabel\u2019s gaze turned to Lorna.\nLorna seemed unaware of anything that might be in her shadow, as if it was beyond her wildest dreams.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\nThe lantern\u2019s light illuminated the space beneath the door. In that moment, the faces of the three froze.\n\u201cThorns\u2026\u201d\nThere was a tangle of thorny vines in front of the room. It stretched out all the way to the corridor outside Lorna\u2019s room.\nA cursed thing, thorny vines.\nStartled, Lorna even forgot to speak.\nThe vines that filled the corridor had only one thing to say.\nThe cursed one should not come out of the room.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna, at a loss for words, was approached by Nabel.\nHe willingly took hold of the thorny vines and began to clear them away. It seemed it would take time to clear the corridor completely.\nOuch.\nThe vines were too sturdy and thick for Nabel\u2019s grip. The thorns were sharp and large. However, Nabel paid no heed as he cleared away the vines.\n\u201cNabel, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d\nLorna clasped his hand, which was already drenched in blood. At that moment, their eyes met\u2014Lorna and Nabel\u2019s. As their hands touched, her thoughts resonated with Nabel more profoundly than ever before.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave. It\u2019s alright,\u201d Lorna said.\n\u201cYou just have to give up,\u201d Nabel replied.\nThat had been her way of life in the mansion\u2014giving up on desires. But now, Nabel tightly grasped the tendrils of determination. He no longer wished for Lorna to give up on anything. His resolute eyes shimmered with determination.\n***\nSeveral months had passed since Nabel cleared the thorny vines in front of Lorna\u2019s room.\nThe inhabitants of the mansion had never treated Lorna as a human, even as bruises formed on Nabel\u2019s hands and fresh flesh grew back.\nAs the answer from the temple grew delayed, their actions became more severe, as if they wished Lorna to hang himself.\nDuring that time, there had been subtle changes in Lorna\u2019s room.\nNabel, with bandages wrapped around his wrists, had suddenly grown taller.\nDespite the harsh environment that deprived him of proper nutrition, he thrived and his stature flourished.\nSometimes, Lorna would wake up to find Nabel gone, wondering where he went off to exercise.\nWhile Lorna willingly gave up one side of the only bed, Lin objected, so Nabel slept on a mattress on the floor.\nThus, when Lorna opened her eyes, she could see him, but lately, he had been disappearing in the early hours of dawn.\n\u201cNabel?\u201d\nAt first, Lorna was startled to find Nabel.\nWhenever she had told him he was free to leave whenever he wanted, she never expected him to vanish so suddenly.\nIt felt as if her heart had dropped to the ground.\nEven though she knew she couldn\u2019t keep Nabel here forever.\nThis place was a wretched mansion, and Lorna had no means to protect Nabel.\nIt was better than being dragged around in a shabby carriage, but now that she had left the carriage, the mansion was nothing but an unfortunate place.\nNabel, who willingly endured a brief humiliation and followed her, was now free.\nHe could leave whenever he pleased.\nKnowing this, Lorna jolted herself up to find him.\nAnd at that moment, if Nabel hadn\u2019t come in through the window, she would have truly stepped outside the room.\n\u201c\u2026Unni?\u201d (older sister)\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

In just a few months since they had met, he had grown by a whole hand\u2019s length.\nDespite the five-year age difference, Lorna could no longer easily look down at him.\nWhile Lorna was slightly small in stature, Nabel\u2019s growth was that remarkable.\n\u201c\u2026Are you disappointed?\u201d\nNabel hesitated for a moment before asking. Lorna tilted her head slightly.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cAre you disappointed that I\u2019m growing?\u201d Nabel asked. Lorna chuckled.\n\u201cNot that\u2026\u201d\nThe child, whom I always looked down upon, being taller than me felt peculiar. Eventually, Lorna spoke up.\n\u201cI feel like you will eventually grow taller than me.\u201d\nUltimately, it sounded like a tale of disappointment. Even though the words could be perceived as childish, Nabel did not laugh.\n\u201cIf it is a source of regret for you, I will do my best to grow as much as possible.\u201d\nOf course, it was not within his power to determine his height. Lorna let out a small laugh.\n\u201cIt feels strange for a younger sibling to grow taller than me.\u201d\nLorna said in a light voice.\n\u201cSince you\u2019re growing so quickly, Nabel, you will eventually surpass me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nNabel looked at her. He replied in a low voice.\n\u201cNevertheless, you will always be my older sister.\u201d\nIt was a term that sounded much weightier than \u2018nuna.\u2019\nAlways\u2026\nThose words struck a chord with Lorna.\nAs if she would never leave this place.\nLorna thought, even though she knew it was selfish.\nThat it wasn\u2019t so bad.\nDespite knowing that Nabel being in this cursed mansion was not beneficial for him.\nKnowing full well what would become of Nabel if she were dragged to the shrine.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nStill, Lorna couldn\u2019t easily let him go.\nJust having one more person to talk to in this desolate mansion was like finding solace for her for several months.\nLorna looked at Nabel.\n\u201c\u2014I know that this place is not a happy place for you.\u201d\nIt was a difficult conversation to bring up. Nabel, looking up at her silently, was still slightly smaller than Lorna.\n\u201cYou know how people treat those who follow a curse. If I go to the shrine, then leave at that time.\u201d\nIt had been a few months of bliss for her.\nBut it was something she could never have forever.\nIt would be better to give up early, she thought. Lorna thought so.\nBefore I became too accustomed to happiness.\nLorna made an effort to speak with a firm voice. Nabel had no choice but to obey her words.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel, who always followed her words, remained silent on that day.\nAs if refusing to comply.\nAs if unwilling to comply.\nAnd paradoxically, Lorna found herself liking that about him.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nFrom that night on, Nabel\u2019s excursions became increasingly frequent, leaving me to wonder how he managed to navigate the windows so skillfully. I pondered whether his body was naturally agile until one day, upon catching sight of the thick bandages wrapped tightly around Nabel\u2019s wrist, I realized it was the result of countless rehearsals.\n\u201cDo not overexert yourself,\u201d I cautioned.\nSilence lingered as my words hung in the air, and Nabel\u2019s deep, abyssal eyes grew even darker. When our gazes met, he briefly lowered his head.\nHis gaze was fixed upon my wrist, which bore a recent injury, a scratch disguised as a maid\u2019s carelessness.\n\u201cJust a little more,\u201d he hesitated and spoke.\n\u201cI wish to ensure your safety.\u201d\n***\nSeveral months passed in such a manner.\nDuring that time, Nabel lived literally in silence. He had no clashes with the people in the mansion. However, it didn\u2019t seem like submission and bowing down to him in Lorna\u2019s eyes.\nHis gaze never submitted. His gaze resembled that of a young beast, slinking and seizing opportunities, enduring humiliation for a moment, just like when he accepted the humiliation in the face of the words \u201chumiliation is temporary.\u201d\n\u201cI will not do anything that harms my lady.\u201d\nWhen the knight mocked him and tried to push him away, Nabel calmly spoke those words. Lorna felt it once again on that day.\nThe anger of a wounded young beast.\nAnd then she knew that one day he would leave her.\nThere were many who left Lorna\u2019s side throughout her life.\nEven those who treated her well at first turned their backs on her once they discovered her true identity.\nSo she could understand. In her eyes, she could see the moment when people would leave.\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t because of her, but eventually Nabel would leave this mansion.\nIt was too narrow and miserable for him to be trapped here.\nLorna accepted it with a sad but joyful heart.\nBecause she hoped Nabel would find a happier place. It was meant to be her last gift before she would eventually be drawn to the shrine.\nA little while later, the one who had mocked Nabel and survived.\nBut on the same day, the servant who left a bruise on Lorna\u2019s back of the hand died.\nThey called it an accident.\nA very coincidental accident.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Its panoramic view, overlooking through grand glass windows, earned it praise as one of the most exceptional estates in the region.\nOf course, to Lorna, this was a rare opportunity, seldom granted to her, if ever. However, on the day of the Countess\u2019s birthday soiree, the chance finally came for her as well.\n\u201cNever venture downstairs!\u201d declared Lord Rida, holding the hand of Lady Rida. He expressed his concern that she might draw attention from the esteemed guests who were expected to arrive.\nWithout waiting for Lorna\u2019s response, he turned his back and left her behind, as if to convey his utter reluctance to be in the same space as her.\nConsequently, the fourth floor of the manor, where Lorna resided, became vacant. Apart from the bustling attendants crowding the staircase, the entire fourth floor remained immaculate, devoid of anyone\u2019s presence, except for occasional passing servants.\nIronically, this newfound solitude equated to freedom for Lorna.\nOn that day, she revelled in the unobstructed view unfolding beneath the wide expanse of windows.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the view from this place rivals that of any other estate,\u201d said Lin, adept at sensing the young lady\u2019s mood.\nLorna beamed with a radiant smile. With the sun shining upon her so generously, her face bloomed like a blossoming flower.\nOf course, she chose to present her countenance in a direction opposite to the hall where the guests were to gather. After all, she could not risk incurring the wrath of the Count and Countess by revealing her face.\n\u201cThey say there is an enormous forest on the mainland. A place where leaves stretch like a sea. They say when you gaze down upon it from a lofty tower, it feels as if your heart is expanding,\u201d Lin occasionally shared stories about the mainland, a place Lorna herself had never visited. As he spoke, Nabel glanced at her inquisitively. Lorna\u2019s eyes widened with curiosity.\n\u201cLeaves stretch like the sea\u2026\u201d\nAlthough she, a person who had never even laid eyes upon the ocean, could grasp the concept of a vast expanse where the sea seemed to have no end.\nIn her mind, she endeavoured to string together countless trees below, attempting to construct an endless forest. Of course, it was no easy task.\nThat\u2019s when it happened.\n\u201cHis Lordship specifically commanded you not to come out.\u201d\nThe maid appeared, holding a bucket, her displeasure evident on her face. She, too, detested being next to someone abandoned by the gods. Nevertheless, cleaning was her duty, and she had no choice but to fulfill it.\nWith a resounding thud, she placed the bucket in front of Lorna. Unbeknownst to her, Lorna, who had inadvertently stepped back to avoid the bucket, finally realized that the railing was unusually low.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nIn an instant, her body toppled backward.\nIn the dizzying moment when her foot missed the ground, Lorna was rendered speechless. She descended helplessly.\nThe brilliant sunlight cast her shadow sharply.\n[Snap!]\nAt that moment, from the edge of the dense shadow, a pair of ears and a flickering tail emerged.\n\u2026!\n\u201cNuna!\u201d\n\u201cMiss!\u201d\nNabel\u2019s reaction was quicker than Lin\u2019s. He swiftly reached out and caught hold of Lorna\u2019s arm.\nThen, behind him, Lorna witnessed something abruptly springing forth from her own shadow.\n\u201cNabel!\u201d\nEmerging from the shadows behind Nabel was a creature, a petite animal that nestled against Lorne\u2019s chest, yet its vigor was far from diminutive.\nWhisk!\nNabel clung to the railing, barely hanging on, his eyes immediately drawn to the dark, pointed ears protruding from the creature, followed by a fluffy, white tail swaying gently.\nThe animal stood guard over them, as if protecting Lorne and Nabel from others.\n\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSister, capture it.\u201d\nNabel paid no mind to the newly arrived being. Precariously dangling, Lorne\u2019s shoe slipped from her foot and plummeted toward the ground.\nThud.\nGiven the grandeur of the noble estate, it took a while for the sound of the shoe hitting the ground to reach their ears.\nA startled maid dropped her mop and let out a shriek.\n\u201cOh, my!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\nSwiftly, reactions ensued. The knights who had been guarding the stairs to prevent Lorne from escaping the fourth-floor corridor rushed towards them.\nThe maid, her face filled with astonishment, pointed them in the direction of Lorne.\nHowever, their gazes shifted elsewhere, away from Lorne in imminent danger.\n\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA fox?\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it inside the mansion?\u201d\nErected ears, black and pointed, standing alertly. Its jet-black forelimbs appeared poised to leap forward at any moment, slightly bent. The soft, orange fur seemed to bristle with vigilance. The fluffy white tail mirrored this demeanour.\nThe fox clearly guarded against the knights.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nIn an instant, the fox\u2019s form blurred, almost transparent, then returned. And Lorne felt her body gently float.\n\u201cUh\u2026?\u201d\nWith that strength, Nabel embraced her tightly, though it was a wonder where such power originated in the arms of a young child.\n\u201cSister\u2026\u201d\nAs her feet touched the ground, Nabel finally exhaled the breath she had been holding. Sensing the cold sensation of her bare feet on the corridor, Lorne regained her senses.\n\u201cNabel\u2026\u201d\nWhile residing in the mansion, Lorna had been enchanted by the Countess on several occasions. If it had been a matter of life or death, it might have been a crisis, but whether fortunate or unfortunate, divine magic did not heed Lorna\u2019s pleas.\nThus, it was truly the first time Lorna had come so close to death. She exhaled a shallow breath.\nHer gaze turned towards the newly appeared fox.\n\u201cThat fox\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cIt emerged from the shadows.\u201d\nNabel pointed to Lorna\u2019s shadow. It was when Lorna widened her eyes.\n\u201cThat demon brought a peculiar creature into the mansion!\u201d\nOne of the servants who was observing the fox shouted, and the expressions of the knights turned grim.\n\u201cPrevent it from reaching our master!\u201d\n\u201cKill it!\u201d\nThe knights who believed in the gods could also wield magic. They raised their swords and conjured flames in one hand.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nWhoosh!\nThere was no hesitation in their offensive magic. Without realizing it, Lorna pulled Nabel closer.\n[Crash!]\nAnd for the first time, Lorna did not bear the brunt of the heat throughout her body. It was thanks to the fox standing in front of her, deflecting the flames.\n\u201cI-I\u2026!\u201d\nThe knights were at a loss for words.\n\u201cIndeed, it was this woman who brought the fox!\u201d\nThe servants and knights shouted in unison. At that moment, the fox\u2019s figure became blurry once again.\nWhirr\u2026\nThe fox, curling its body, staggered. Startled, Lorna instinctively reached out her hand towards the fox.\nAnd at that moment, the fox disappeared into her shadow.\nFrom within the dense shadow, pointed ears and a swaying tail briefly revealed themselves before vanishing altogether.\n***\n\u201cI am a forsaken woman in the eyes of God!\u201d\n\u201cThat fox, an enigmatic presence, remains a mystery!\u201d\n\u201cClearly, she emerged from the shadow of that woman!\u201d\nThe hallway was filled with noise.\nLorna was trapped inside her room. Even her servant, Lin was unable to enter. Lin was even reprimanded for not doing anything until Lorna brought the devil into the house. The rumours went so far as to suggest their complicity.\n\u201cLin must be safe.\u201d\nLorna lowered her head as she heard the heated argument in the hallway. The room was dark, without a lantern to shed light on Lin.\nTap.\nNabel imitated what Lin had done. It wasn\u2019t something he was naturally accustomed to, but having seen it numerous times, he was confident he could do it.\nHe brightened the room and handed Lorna a warm cup of tea before sitting beside her.\n\u201cWhat was that fox?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel immediately responded.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a devil.\u201d\nAs if he knew well about it. Lorna\u2019s gaze shifted towards Nabel.\n\u201cDo you know what it was?\u201d\n\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\nNabel reached out his hand without hesitation. He was a person who usually refrained from revealing himself.\nBut over the past few months, at least in front of Lorna, he was different.\nLorna had no reservations about touching him, even though she knew her thoughts could be read if their hands made contact.\nShe was a strange, intriguing, and ticklish person to Nabel.\nSomeone he constantly wanted to touch.\nSomeone he wanted to reach out to, even deeper.\nSuch a person was a first in Nabel\u2019s short life. That was why he could expose everything about himself.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nHis hand touched Lorna\u2019s shadow.\nTap, tap.\nA knocking sound resonated in the room. Wide-eyed, Lorna stared at the shadow.\nCreak\u2026\n\u201cAh?\u201d\nIt was the crying sound she heard earlier. It seemed a bit painful. Then, Lorna\u2019s shadow rustled and moved.\nAnd from there, the fox she had seen before emerged.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nPoof.\nThe fox nestled in Lorne\u2019s embrace, affectionately brushing her cheek against his shoulder as if she had known him for a long time, for an eternity.\nWhen their gazes met again, the diminutive fox crouched in Lorne\u2019s arms.\nLorne remained frozen, unable to move or even lift her arms.\nThere was something familiar about this fox. It exuded a sense of long-standing familiarity, as if they had been acquainted for a very long time.\n\u201cThis fox\u2026,\u201d Lorne began, looking at Nabel. Nabel seemed to know something.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a creature you can find on the mainland,\u201d Nabel replied.\nWhen had he journeyed to the mainland, having been carried in a carriage as a slave?\nCuriosity welled up within her, overriding her previous reluctance to delve into painful memories.\n\u201cAn animal that protects humans\u2026 On the mainland, they call it a divine beast (\uc2e0\uc218).\u201d\nNabel had doubted it several times while observing her shadow. He had believed that there were no people in this region who possessed divine beasts.\nHowever, no matter how she examined it, the fox within the shadow, which would stir whenever Lorne faced a crisis and grow tense whenever she was threatened, was undoubtedly a divine beast.\n\u201cA divine beast, then, a creature of the gods.\u201d\nThe gods had forsaken me. That was why magic did not listen. Lorne gazed at the fox, her words caught in her throat.\nNabel nodded slightly.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a creature of the gods. And perhaps it\u2019s thanks to this fox that your magic did not respond.\u201d\nFoolish mortals.\nNabel clenched his fists.\nDivine beasts, creatures of the gods, were profoundly revered on the mainland. They were rare even there, but Nabel knew of another person who possessed a divine beast.\nThat person, too, was greatly respected.\nHowever\u2026\nIn this place, they failed to recognize the divine beast, and rather than honoring its master, they belittled and scorned them, claiming they had been abandoned by the gods.\n\u201cThe gods did not abandon you.\u201d\nThey simply loved you too much. That\u2019s what they all said. The love of the gods poured onto humans, overflowing their capacity, and the result was that the person transformed into an animal, a divine beast.\n\u201cFoolish mortals.\u201d\nNabel sneered again. This time, his words were not confined to his thoughts but slipped past his lips. Lorne gazed at him in silence.\n\u201cWe must send this woman to the temple immediately!\u201d\n\u201cShe must be purified at the altar of the temple!\u201d\nOutside the window, the voices of knights conversing on the training ground reached their ears. Nabel scoffed.\nHe clenched his fist tightly.\n\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you want to leave this place?\u201d His voice was low, almost sweet. Perhaps it was the darkness that made it so. Lorne couldn\u2019t discern the expression on Nabel\u2019s face clearly, as the moonlight cast him in the backlight.\n\u201c\u2026I want to leave.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s impossible for me to leave. Lorne closed her eyes, trying to swallow back the tears that wanted to escape.\nNabel wordlessly reached out his hand to hers. Through his touch, Lorne\u2019s thoughts flowed in.\nIn such a manner, he refrained from making her say words she found difficult to express. Instead, he sensed a deeper sincerity.\n\u201cIf only I could leave,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBoth you and I, without getting hurt, if we could leave,\u201d he replied.\nAnd so, Nabel made up his mind completely. He spoke up.\n\u201cI vowed to repay the debt.\u201d\nIt was the story he had shared with her on the day they first met. Lorne opened her eyes. Through the blurred moisture in her vision, she saw him.\n\u201cI like you, sister,\u201d he whispered. Though still young, he spoke with heartfelt sincerity.\n\u201cEven after a year, even after ten years, I want to live, seeing only you.\u201d\nIn his short life, the time spent with Lorne held the most significance. He hadn\u2019t been happy in the place he originally came from.\nBut now, things are different. As long as he was by her side, it didn\u2019t matter where they were. Even in this mansion filled with foolishness and deceit.\nAs long as his sister was there.\nHe whispered softly. It was Lorne who had saved him in the beginning. It was a small act of kindness.\nNow, it was Nabel\u2019s turn to save her. He had made up his mind completely.\n\u201cI want to be with you forever.\u201d\nSo, just for a little while, he would leave Lorne\u2019s side.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

It was such a beautiful, tranquil night.\nIf only it weren\u2019t for the journalists below, clamouring to crucify her.\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\nLorna spoke up.\n\u201cHow could they send someone like that to a sacred place?\u201d\n\u201cSummon the inquisitor of the temple immediately!\u201d\nVoices discussing how to \u2018dispose\u2019 of her echoed from outside.\n\u201cQuiet! The master has ordered silence!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna fell silent. The Marquis seemed to be making a move.\nUpon hearing about the fox and the task that awaited her, it was clear why.\nThe Marquis wanted to send Lorna to the temple by any means necessary. And once she had washed away her \u2018taint,\u2019 he intended to sell her off to a merchant family for the sake of their lineage.\nMerchant families were more devoted to wealth than a distant god, making them fitting for the Marquis\u2019 desires.\n\u201cBut\u2026 you and I, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\nLorna bravely spoke, her heart clenched tight. She didn\u2019t even realize her hand was touching the hilt of her saber.\n\u201cMy father will surely try to sell me off to a better place, so I\u2019ll resist.\u201d\nThen there was only one outcome. If those countless knights swarmed in, there would be no way to protect Nabel.\nLorna closed her eyes. Just as she always had, she suppressed her desires.\n\u201cI like you too.\u201d\nIf she were to be sold somewhere according to the Marquis\u2019 plan, there might be a chance for them to meet again. But if the temple truly considered her a heretic, she would face execution.\nThat would be their farewell.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel slowly closed and opened his eyes. A little fox jumped onto his shoulder, as if comforting him.\nNabel glanced at the swaying tail and gently returned the baby fox to Lorna\u2019s embrace.\n\u201cI will repay this favour.\u201d\nIt was what he said earlier. Like a fleeting dream, he said it once more.\n\u201cI will never forget your kindness.\u201d\nThe fox nestled once again in Lorna\u2019s embrace. Nabel dared not reach out to Lorna. It was not a refusal, but a refusal that was not meant for now.\nInstead, while stroking the fox in their embrace, Nabel spoke.\n\u201cThis fox will only follow you. Sometimes it may disappear, but then it will be like this.\u201d\nNabel reached out and gently touched Lorna\u2019s shadow. In response, as if it had been caressed, the fox made a contented sound. Lorna\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cPlease stroke the shadow. Then it will come out.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2026 do you know?\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Lorna wanted to ask. She wondered where he came from.\nNot a slave, surely.\n\u201cWhere I was, occasionally, I could see it.\u201d\nNabel lowered his head briefly.\n\u201cI will become a loyal follower, devoted to following and supporting only the master, willing to risk my life to protect. Never leaving you alone.\u201d\nAt his words, Lorna\u2019s eyes widened. She sensed that the moment she had known, yet wanted to avoid, was approaching.\n\u201cAlone, just for a moment.\u201d\nHumiliation, just for a moment.\nNabel subtly changed the words that Lorna had once said.\nJust as Lorna had calmed down at the calm voice that said humiliation was only temporary, she hoped the same.\nHe had grown taller since he first arrived.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t forget me.\u201d\nI will definitely save you. Come back here.\nThe scars on Nabel\u2019s wrists were fading away. Now only the tender marks of new skin remained. It was the place where the shackles had been.\nEven if rough marks appeared again in this place, it didn\u2019t matter.\nHe had firmly set his wavering goal.\n\u201c\u2026Are you leaving?\u201d\nEven though she knew she would leave someday, Lorna wanted to hold on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone again.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t realize that her thoughts were flowing through their joined hands, suppressing her desires.\n\u201cAlone, just for a moment.\u201d\nNabel tightly held her hand. In a strong voice, he whispered.\n\u201cI will definitely come back.\u201d\nSo please, don\u2019t forget me.\nHe closed his eyes.\n\u201c\u2026Nabel.\u201d\nLorna murmured his name softly and lowered her head.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll name you Belle, after the fox.\u201d\nTaking her name into consideration.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

His slightly dishevelled hair on the ground resembled withered rose petals.\nHer dull pink hair lingered on his fingertips.\n\u201cI will return, without fail.\u201d\nWhere would Nabel go?\nAlthough Lorna was curious, she did not ask.\nEven if she didn\u2019t know where he was going, the moment the answer came from the shrine, he would be erased from this world.\nThen they would never be able to meet again.\nShe closed her eyes.\n[Swoosh]\nBut then, she opened her eyes at the gentle touch on her forehead.\nIt was not permitted, so it wasn\u2019t a kiss on the lips. Nabel\u2019s lips lightly brushed against her forehead and then withdrew.\n[Thunk!]\nAs he bid farewell, capturing Lorna\u2019s figure in his sight, he leapt outside. Lorna closed her eyes.\nYes, it\u2019s better if he leaves.\nLorna pondered while looking at his final appearance.\nThis place is not a happy place.\nAnd so, the moment that had been special in her life came to an end.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u201cHas the slave escaped?\u201d\nThe aristocrats mocked Lorna.\n\u201cNo matter how much of a slave he was, he couldn\u2019t serve the cursed.\u201d\n\u201cUnless he wanted to be damned\u2026.\u201d\nLorna remained unresponsive to their words.\nLeaving was the path to happiness for Nabel.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nAfter Nabel left, Lorna discovered what he did every night outside the window. He understood why the knights regarded him as a thorn in their side.\nUnderneath the window without Nabel, knights and servants gathered, whispering among themselves. It was said to be a mansion with a curse. Some even recited prayers.\nDue to the habit of eavesdropping on whether Nabel was somewhere outside, Lorna inadvertently heard it. He closed his eyes.\n[Bang!]\nLin forcefully closed the window.\n\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d\nThere seemed to be a hint of emotion in her actions. Lorna smiled at her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\nFortunately, Lin returned to Lorna unharmed. To be precise, no one was there to accompany Lorna, so she just returned him.\nHe had to keep him alive until they reached the temple.\nIn the end, that seemed to be the conclusion.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nFox Belle nestled in her arms, guarding the outside.\n\u201cDrag that devilish creature to the temple immediately!\u201d\nLady Countess, who had seen Belle, shouted, but Belle was stronger than expected. She endured until her voice cracked and collapsed.\n[Kyaang!]\nNabel was right. Magic didn\u2019t work on Belle. And there was no way the knights could exercise their skills against the fox that passed through like slicing through empty space.\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nAnd Belle had a special ability. It was as if she could read her mind, knowing exactly what she desired.\nJust like the time when she almost fell from the railing, the fox understood her wishes and rescued her.\nWhen she didn\u2019t want to fall from the railing, she made a wish for it not to happen.\nWith the words asking to protect Lene, it wrapped around Lene, who almost got hit by scalding water.\nShe didn\u2019t know the limits of her abilities.\n\u201cWe must find a way to kill those wicked creatures!\u201d\nBut one thing was certain, no matter how much the knights of Lord Reda tried, they could not harm Belle.\nThanks to that, Lorna felt at ease.\nAt least until the inquisitor arrived at the temple, there were no more people tormenting her.\nThe mansion residents would retreat as soon as they saw Belle. It was only natural, as they knew that if they attacked Lorna, they would be instantly devoured, and even the divine magic wouldn\u2019t work against her.\nWhining\u2026\nAs the presence outside vanished, Belle stretched her body. Lorna stroked Belle\u2019s fur. It felt like she was exchanging greetings with a dear friend.\nShe smiled faintly, lost in her thoughts.\n\u201cEven if you say that, no one will come to the temple anytime soon.\u201d\nLene gently combed her hair. Lorna was grateful and sorry, knowing how much trouble she caused Lene. After all, if Lorna was dragged to the temple, she didn\u2019t know what would happen to Lene.\n\u201cI heard there was a disturbance in the temple.\u201d\n\u201cA disturbance?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cThe heretics attacked the temple.\u201d\nLorna couldn\u2019t determine whether she should be glad or saddened. Her fate was postponed until the temple became quiet.\nIt was, in essence, an indefinite postponement.\n\u201cKeep the demon confined and watch over her.\u201d\nShe was the scorpion of the temple.\nThe temple, which had already heard rumours about the fox, labelled her as a demon. However, they didn\u2019t classify her as a direct threat. That was the decree.\nAnd thus, Lorna found herself in a strange position within the mansion.\nShe was a presence that everyone disliked and wished to disappear.\n***\n[Ten years after]\nDuring that time, a great upheaval took place on the continent.\nThe epicenter of this upheaval was none other than the Western Continent.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The necklace adorning his neck served as a disguise for his newfound hair colour.\nIt had been approximately ten years since the boy had first appeared.\nHis name was Nabel Iber.\n***\n[Clink]\nThe fork pierced the center of the apple.\nThe hand gripping the fork was delicate and slender. As the owner of the fork noticed a brown spot on one side of the apple, they deftly avoided it and took a bite.\nWhile eating the apple, Lorna suddenly glanced at her own hand. Every time she looked at her hand, she couldn\u2019t help but think of a certain hand. A hand that used to tightly hold her own.\nThe fork that was once large now seemed small.\n\u201cNabel,\u201d she whispered softly.\nA name she couldn\u2019t forget even after ten years. The child who was no longer there, slightly older than her.\nBy now, would they have grown much taller than me?\nLorna wondered.\nHow are they doing?\nAlthough he had been sold to her as a slave, he was not a slave to her.\nLorna didn\u2019t treat him as a slave.\nNabel was a free person, and he left.\nPromising to come back.\n[Clink]\nA pale hand, not accustomed to much sunlight, picked up the fork again. That\u2019s when it happened.\n\u201cMiss!\u201d\nThere was only one person who would rush into her room like that. The maid, Lin.\n\u201cLin? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d\nSeeing Lin enter in a fluster and struggle to speak, Lorna knew that her fears from ten years ago had come to fruition.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a message from the temple.\u201d\nLorna dropped the fork with a clatter.\n[Ding!]\nFox Belle hopped onto her lap, as if to reassure her, as if to protect her.\nThrough Belle, Lorna saw Nabel.\nShe briefly recalled the promise from their childhood, the one where he had vowed to come back, before erasing it from her mind.\nThe child who had promised to come back soon was running late.\nTen years had passed since she held onto hope while also telling herself not to expect anything. Lorna closed her eyes.\nThis year, she turned twenty-seven.\n**\n\u201cWhere is the heretic?\u201d\nThe magicians, bearing the sentence of the divine, entered the mansion with great pomp. While Lord and Lady Rida treated them with utmost hospitality, knights stormed into Lorna\u2019s chamber.\n\u201cEven if you resist here, once the wizards arrive, you will be dragged away. Do you have any reason to endure this?\u201d\nThe knights laughed heartily at Lorna. They believed that even if she had the cunning of a fox, she wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the formal arrival of the wizards at the temple.\nIt was the moment they had been waiting for, for ten long years.\n\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d\nThe maid, Lin, didn\u2019t know what to do.\nLorna gazed out of the window.\nHer somber situation belied the sunny and pristine sky outside, as if she knew nothing of it.\nIt would be better to walk out than to be dragged out.\nLorna rose to her feet.\n\u2018Don\u2019t you want to leave?\u2019\nShe could still remember the voice of Nabel, young as ever.\nHe must have become an adult by now.\nShe recalled his voice once more.\n\u2018As an adult, what kind of person have you become?\u2019\nI want to leave too.\nLorna looked out of the window again. At that moment, a thought occurred to her, a thought she had never had in her twenty-seven years of life.\nCan I escape from here?\nThe Rida family was a prominent family that commanded numerous knights and magicians. It was beyond her power to defy them alone.\nUntil now, they hadn\u2019t killed her because they had ordered her to be watched at the temple.\nBut if she rebelled fiercely, the order to kill her had already been given.\n\u2018Purify the demon if she rebels fiercely.\u2019\nLord Rida accepted the command that came down from the temple with a dissatisfied expression on his face. His words, however, were very deceiving.\n\u201cIt will take a long time to raise another daughter\u2026 but since you are young, it should be alright, shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\nLady Rida, now in her late thirties, couldn\u2019t conceal her laughter at those words. From that day on, Lorna completely abandoned any human affection she had for the two of them.\nIt was a bond that was already thinner than a spider\u2019s thread.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nHowever, I couldn\u2019t leave. No, I couldn\u2019t possibly depart.\nEver since that command, they behaved as if they knew how to kill Lorna.\nIf I were to attempt an escape using brute force, they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to engage in cruelty from their end as well.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nYet still, I longed to go outside.\nAfter all, it would be better than enduring demon-like treatment here and eventually making my way to the temple.\n\u201cWill you not go?\u201d\nThe voices of the sneering knights echoed through the room. Lorna sat up.\nThud!\nWhen the fox named Belle leaped out of her embrace, her eyes gleamed upon seeing the knights.\nIt seemed as if she was ready to interrogate them if necessary.\nThe knights flinched. Some of the knights who had been bitten by Belle, their necks still bearing the mark, were unable to draw their swords.\n\u2015Now it wouldn\u2019t be such a distant event for this little fox to burn to ashes.\nThe knights turned away as if they hadn\u2019t even spared a thought for her.\nAnd as they fled, their footsteps were unnaturally swift.\nIt was a gait that couldn\u2019t conceal their fear.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nLorna lifted Belle in her arms. Belle looked back at her. Her newly tranquil face seemed to convey those words.\nI will fight as much as I can.\nHowever, Lorna also knew that Belle could be hurt.\nBelle seemed to be greatly affected by her power.\nShe no longer showed signs of sunburn and only occasionally ate the food brought by the servant girl, Lin, who had rescued her. Her strength was far from overflowing.\nOn the days when Belle faced off against the knights, she would stretch her body and hiss, always ready. On those days, Lorna feared that Belle might die.\nNevertheless, Belle never died, even though she returned to the shadows.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nStill, Lorna held Belle tightly.\nTo witness before her death, the sight of this precious being dying, which was rare in the world now, seemed unbearable.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

No, they believed they had seized her.\nSuperficially ferocious, the knights\u2019 arms, concealed beneath their garments, lacked strength.\nOne of the knights whispered to Lorna.\n\u201cDo not reply, but listen, Lady Lorna.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly polite voice\u2014a voice filled with respect that Lorna had rarely heard in her lifetime.\n\u201cHis Lordship has a message for you.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\nHis Lordship?\nWho, the Earl?\nBut if it were the Earl\u2019s knights, they would not have been so polite to her.\nLorna suddenly recalled the person she had wanted to meet for ten years.\nCould it be, she wondered, that person?\nBefore her, the image of a dusty blond figure appeared, now grown into an adult.\n\u201cNow, you are not alone,\u201d he said.\nNabel.\nLorna\u2019s mouth slightly agape.\n\u201cPlease forgive the intrusion.\u201d\nThe knight on the right also spoke softly. His voice reached only her. Through them, Lorna thought of another person.\nNabel was coming.\n\u201cDrag him to the basement at once!\u201d\nCommanded the knight captain, Devant. The knight holding Lorna\u2019s arms roughly pulled her down, pretending to lead her ferociously. Lorna did not resist.\n[Thud!]\nDevant, the knight captain, forcefully pushed Lorna forward as he slammed the door.\nA cloud of dusty earth disrupted her sanctuary before dissipating.\nThe echoing sound of knights\u2019 boots filled the corridor, preventing anyone from noticing someone approaching the mansion.\nHee-hee!\nA splendid golden carriage adorned with elaborate decorations traversed Lord Ridar\u2019s domain.\nIn front of it, as if unable to contain its slow pace, a white horse carrying its master leapt forward.\nWhen the blue-robed hood was drenched, the revealed locks of hair were as dark as black velvet.\nOriginally, those locks had been resplendent gold.\n***\nTen interrogators arrived as Count Rida\u2019s guests. Among them was a figure that stood on the sixth step of the nine stairs leading to the divine.\nIt was the highest-ranked magician among those who engaged in external activities.\n\u201cHeretic, raise your head!\u201d\nThe magician raised his hand. Lorna\u2019s hands were tied behind her back. The kneeling magicians checked if there were any magical barriers around her.\nThe method was quite simple.\n[Splash!]\nLorna\u2019s deep pink hair became wet and hung down in the water.\nAs the cold water spread, Lorna involuntarily took a deep breath.\nWhether salt was mixed in the water or not, the taste that entered her mouth was bitter.\n\u201cThere is no magic barrier.\u201d\nThe magician with four bracelets on his wrist said. It meant that he was on the fourth step.\nThe magician on the sixth step raised his hand.\n\u201cLet the diagnosis begin then.\u201d\n\u201cYoung lady!\u201d\nLin shouted.\nThe magic circle spread out before the magicians was undoubtedly a lightning-based spell circle. Electric sparks flashed from the turned-white magic circle.\n[Kaang!]\nAt that moment, a Belle suddenly popped out from Lorna\u2019s shadow. The magician yelled in surprise.\n\u201cIs that the summoned creature?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d\nKnight Captain Devant shouted. Holding his sword, he appeared visibly tense.\nHowever, constantly looking back at the magicians, it was clear that he believed they could overcome the fox this time, as powerful magicians had arrived.\n\u201cAttack!\u201d\nJust as the magician who identified the enemy was about to cast the spell circle, a knight beside him suddenly turned his sword towards him.\n\u201c!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026!\u201d\nThat knight was one of the two who had held Lorna\u2019s arms. Due to the knight showing his back to Lorna and swinging the sword, she did not see the magician\u2019s arm being severed.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nStartled, Lorna\u2019s gaze descended to the floor near the magician.\nHer line of sight was abruptly veiled by someone\u2019s sleeve.\nIt was the sleeve of a cerulean robe, adorned with ornate gilded trims.\nA precious jade.\nThe owner of the sleeve draped a large black robe over her, enveloping her completely. Sunlight was obstructed beneath the hood of the robe. As the dampness of the water soaked through, a warmth coursed through Lorna\u2019s chilled body.\nThe cerulean robe sleeve vanished before her eyes, and someone pulled her into a tight embrace.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

And they were not repulsive.\n\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d\nThe soft whisper came from a man\u2019s voice. Through that voice, Lorna glimpsed memories of the past.\n\u201cDo not look upon the harshness.\u201d\nThough he whispered softly, Lorna eventually opened her eyes.\nThe black robe that covered Lorna was large. The hood was equally spacious. As she slightly lifted the hood, the hidden light poured in all at once.\n\u201cMilady.\u201d\nThe man touched her.\nBlonde hair, radiant blonde hair caught her eye first. And the deep abyss within. Lorna recognized the depths that seemed to be looking into the abyss.\nIt felt as if all sounds of the world had been concealed, leaving only one person\u2019s voice to be heard.\nThe man\u2019s breath poured onto Lorna.\nAs if slightly fatigued, as if he had run too fast, the man stifled his breath, which wanted to rush out forcefully. He was the person she had longed to see for ten years.\n\u201c\u2026Nabel.\u201d\nTherefore, she recognized him at a glance.\nNerves loosened, Lorna was embraced by Nabel.\nIt was a reunion she had waited ten years for.\nHer heart throbbed violently. Sensing that, Nabel couldn\u2019t find the words. He pondered what he should say, but seeing Lorna grow pale and thin, there was only one thing to say.\n\u201c\u2015It\u2019s too late, my lady.\u201d\nThe voice, lower and softer than the young voice that called her sister, resonated in Lorna\u2019s ears.\n\u00a0\n***\nNabel spared Lorna from witnessing the gruesome scene.\nThose who followed him had long disposed of the heretical inquisitors, and they covered the bodies with the robes they had worn.\nThe garments they wore were entirely black, concealing their identities.\n\u201cThey are\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cThey shall face divine retribution!\u201d\nAstounded knights spoke their minds. It was only natural after having slain the inquisitors.\nNabel continued to gaze at Lorna.\n\u201cJust a moment, please wait a little longer,\u201d Nabel whispered, turning his body. As he pulled down the blue hood of his robe, his black hair came into view, which had been a vibrant golden just moments ago.\nIt appeared he had changed his hair colour through magic.\nTo her, this was the more familiar form of Nabel. She wondered how he had grown, but he had suddenly grown so much taller.\nAfter ten years of absence, he had become a man much taller than Lorna. His hands, which seemed strong from gripping a sword for so long, had numerous calluses. It seemed to tell the story of ten years of hardship.\n\u201cInquisitors, you say?\u201d\nNabel glanced at the inquisitors.\nThey were individuals who revealed their status as inquisitors of the Two Gods, wearing medals with swords around their necks.\nThe sound of breathing could still be heard, gasping for air.\nThey were on the verge of death.\n\u201cPeople who don\u2019t even recognize the Divine Beasts?\u201d\nNabel scoffed at them without reservation. As he did so, someone recognized him and shouted.\n\u201cThat guy, isn\u2019t he the slave who escaped long ago?\u201d\n\u201cA slave?\u201d\nA murmuring voice spread among the Earl\u2019s people. Nabel laughed.\n\u201cA slave indeed.\u201d\nHis voice was cold. It sounded different from when he spoke to Lorna.\n\u201cEven if I am a slave, I am not your slave.\u201d\nNabel raised Lorna\u2019s hand. The hand, previously cold from being soaked in cold water, gradually warmed in response to Nabel\u2019s heat.\n\u201c\u2026 \u201d\nNabel kissed just above her knuckles. Slaves were not allowed to look directly at their masters, so it was customary to kiss the back of the hand as a sign of reverence.\nIt signified that she was his sole master. Even the inspectors dressed in black robes widened their eyes in astonishment.\n\u201cThe surroundings are so hideous that they cannot be shown to you, my lady\u2026\u201d\nNabel slowly raised his hand and straightened Lorna\u2019s robe. The bright sunlight was obscured between the folds of the black hood.\n\u201cWould you like to rest for a moment, my lady?\u201d\nThere was a sense of calm in his low voice as he gently caressed Lorna\u2019s cold hand, while Nabel wiped away the sadness from her cheeks with a constant tenderness.\n\u201cIf you wish, their fate will be determined later,\u201d he said.\nOutside, the weather was still cold, as if the air itself had turned into icy water. Lorna nodded briefly.\n\u201cI have prepared a place for you to rest,\u201d she said.\nHer soothing voice reassured Lorna, as he gracefully escorted her.\n\u201cCapture them!\u201d\nDevant, the still-dazed commander, was blocked by the black-clad investigators. Their faces concealed behind masks, only their piercing blue eyes were visible.\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to see it, you will soon have the chance. Is there a need to pursue them?\u201d Nabel left behind a chilling remark. Removing the white gloves from his hand, he took hold of Lorna\u2019s hand and gently kissed her knuckles.\nThe figures in black were once again taken aback, letting out gasps of surprise.\nUnfazed, Nabel led her onward.\n\u201cSoon, you will know the identity of the person you have not served,\u201d he declared with utmost politeness, leaving his parting words.\nWithin the shadow of Lorna\u2019s trailing figure, Belle concealed herself completely.\n***\nNabel had taken Lorna to a small mansion near the earl\u2019s estate. It appeared to be someone\u2019s cottage, a place that resembled a retreat. Lorna was unaware, but it was also a mansion that had changed owners just a week ago.\nHaving overturned a basin of saltwater, Lorna could now cleanse herself in that place. People who were ready to receive her were already waiting in the mansion.\n\u201cMiss!\u201d\nAnd shortly thereafter, Lin, whom Nabel had successfully rescued with the sentinels, arrived. Instead of Lorna, who was greatly surprised, the maids prepared by Nabel helped her with her bathing needs.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe sound of water could be heard. Beyond this wall, there was someone.\nHe endured it as if he had endured it for ten years. The image of her, which he couldn\u2019t even look at for a long time and could only recall, was blooming far more beautifully than he had imagined.\nNabel stood there, waiting for her while she was inside the room. It seemed as if he wanted to see her as soon as possible, even by a moment.\n[Thump]\nAnd when the door opened and she entered the room, he let out a breath he had been holding, feeling relieved.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

From a few strands of hair that emerged from the towel, the scent of bathroom oil emanated.\nBut what stimulated Nabel more was the intensified fragrance of roses, even stronger than ten years ago. Nabel had been dreaming of her all the while they were apart.\nLorna was unharmed. Despite his delay, she was unharmed.\nNabel closed his eyes. The walls that had grown even thicker over the past ten years concealed his emotions.\n\u201cThank you for waiting.\u201d\nTruly, thank you.\nHe whispered softly. It was the time for him to repay her kindness from ten years ago with something greater.\nFor that alone, for this moment alone, he had lived for ten years. He concealed his battered body and embraced Lorna.\nThe potent fragrance stimulated him. His heart raced fiercely. With trembling hands, he gently held Lorna.\nThe rough hands that had struck countless people became tender before her. He suppressed his raging desire like a tyrant and kissed Lorna\u2019s forehead.\nAs he did on the day he left.\nNow, the two of them were not alone anymore.\n[Thump, thump.]\nAt that moment, someone knocked on the door.\n\u201cMaster, it\u2019s Nisha.\u201d\nNisha\nNabel\u2019s eyes narrowed at the voice that interrupted their sweet reunion.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nNisha, the loyal knight, possessed remarkable skill, making her the first choice as a companion for the lord\u2019s long journey. She was astute, quick to grasp even the vaguest orders from Nabel, understanding them in an instant.\nNabel had issued two commands when he arrived here:\n\u201cDo not disturb me during my time in the mansion.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you notice anything suspicious about the Inquisitor, report it separately.\u201d\nBut why the Inquisitor?\nNo one dared to question aloud. The knights who followed Nabel etched these orders deep into their minds.\nAlthough Nabel had explicitly ordered not to be disturbed during his stay here, the urgency of the current situation necessitated action. Nisha couldn\u2019t help but knock on his door, even if it meant disobeying his command.\n\u201cMy lord, it\u2019s Nisha.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I told you not to disturb me.\u201d\nHis voice reverberated with coldness.\nNisha felt her tension rise.\nNabel was originally devoid of pity or tears. Just as he had shown his mettle and made a name for himself on the battlefield, he showed no mercy for mistakes.\nAnd the Nabel she knew never resorted to senseless killings, but once he was convinced, he pushed forward without hesitation. He turned traitors into cruel examples, making those with impure hearts tremble.\nIn short, Nisha\u2019s defiance of the order not to disturb him could potentially lead to her own demise, with her life hanging in the balance. She lowered her head, her body tense.\n\u201cI apologize. However\u2014\u201d\n[Thump!] The door swung open. Nabel himself stood there, squinting his eyes. The dimly lit room stared back at Nisha.\n\u201cIs it something of utmost urgency?\u201d\nHe had come to report the unimaginable, that the bodies of the Inquisitors had turned into black powder and dissipated. It was a bizarre occurrence that required immediate attention.\nUsually, those who followed the gods were preserved in their entirety until their funerals, a sign of the gods\u2019 care for the lifelong devotees, especially the sorcerers who followed them.\nBut the bodies of the Inquisitors had vanished without a trace.\nIt was inconceivable.\nUnless they were not true Inquisitors.\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nHowever, Nisha could not bring herself to speak. The master had a visibly troubled countenance. Nisha knew well that he had no mercy in times like these.\nHe was a lord who had spent a long time on the battlefield. There was no doubt about it.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nAt that moment, a small voice came from inside.\nNaturally, it was a voice Nisha had never heard before.\nHas that woman gone mad?\nNisha was astonished by the voice that dared to utter the most revered name on the mainland.\nHe didn\u2019t know it, but the fact that he did not voice that thought was the wisest moment of his life.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s urgent, you can leave for a moment.\u201d\nNisha sensed it.\nShe would see that woman\u2019s face for the first time on the city wall tomorrow morning.\nNo, this is the eastern continent, so there wouldn\u2019t be any occasion on the city wall.\nBut it was certain that she would not see a woman with her head and neck attached.\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t want to leave you alone anymore.\u201d\nHowever, his expectations were shattered beautifully.\nUnbeknownst to herself, Nisha\u2019s mouth opened slightly.\nIt was not the chilling voice that the master was familiar with.\nIt was an incredibly gentle voice directed at the woman.\nIt was even affectionate.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going far. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d\nIn the end, Nabel nodded in response to the soft voice. And upon seeing that sight, Nisha could not believe her eyes.\nWho on earth is this woman?\nNabel was not someone who spoke much to those beneath her. As a result, the interpretations of the knights who tried to decipher Nabel\u2019s words, \u201cPlease treat her with respect,\u201d were all different.\n\u201cShe must be a high-ranking woman from the eastern continent.\u201d\n\u201cShe must be someone who needs to maintain a relationship for the exchange between the eastern continent and the western empire.\u201d\nAll of those thoughts seemed completely wrong. The knights had gathered their heads, thinking that they should at least treat her as an esteemed guest of the royal palace.\nNo, absolutely not.\nNisha realized an important fact.\nNever dare to disturb the innermost feelings of this woman.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

He swiftly returned to her, having issued urgent commands.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\n\u201cLorna.\u201d\nLorna gazed out the window. She could never have imagined being in such a state just a few hours ago.\nWhine\u2026\nBelle seemed to regain some strength but still clung to Lorna\u2019s lap, with her tail still curled. Having observed Belle once, Nabel spoke up.\n\u201c\u2015Do you remember the forest likened to the sea?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened. Lin, the maid who had been combing her hair, shared the same expression. The unfamiliar maid in the mansion beside them bowed deeply and remained motionless.\n\u201cThe place where densely packed leaves stretch endlessly, so when the wind blows, it resembles the undulating sea.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s gaze briefly touched Lin before darting away.\nIt was a story they had shared when they were young.\nFor Lorna, who hailed from inland regions, it was a difficult landscape to conjure.\nA forest spread out like the sea\u2014a sight so grand that it was too overwhelming to imagine connecting a few unseen trees to her room\u2019s window.\n\u201cI know such a place. I wish we could go there together.\u201d\nNabel whispered softly.\nLorna had no reason to refuse.\nShe couldn\u2019t return to the Rida mansion, and she had no place to set foot on the eastern continent either.\nAt least, not where the influence of the sect reached.\nFurthermore, she had even killed the inquisitor\u2026\nLorna\u2019s expression clouded.\n\u201cIs it all right?\u201d\nHaving already been branded a demon, she would be an enemy to the sect no matter where she went. Perhaps she would have to live cautiously, wary of sorcerers for the rest of her life.\nBut what about Nabel?\n\u201cYour worries have grown.\u201d\nNabel, who had drawn near without her noticing, lightly touched her cheek. His white glove came into contact with her skin.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nRealizing something, Nabel slightly pulled back his white glove.\n[Thump] The glove fell to the ground.\nThe maid in the mansion widened her eyes. She knew that the master, regardless of where he went, always took his gloves with him.\n\u2026\nWith his bare hand, Nabel met Lorna\u2019s gaze again, as if trying to soothe the slight crease of worry on her brow.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about the inquisitor\u2019s work, you needn\u2019t worry. Didn\u2019t we make a promise?\u201d\nSince their childhood days.\nHe spoke softly.\n\u201cI will not do anything that will harm you, Lorna. So\u2026\u201d\nHis voice trembled ever so slightly.\n\u201cWill you come with me to see the sea of the forest?\u201d\nIt was as good as saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go where I am.\u201d\nAnd Lorna vividly remembered their childhood conversation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s on the western continent, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nIt was a tale of departing the continent, venturing into a completely new place. A land so unfamiliar, never before seen or imagined to set foot upon.\nIt was a place vastly different from this one. In the first place, there was little interaction between people from the East and the West continent.\nCulture was bound to be divergent as well.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s where I\u2019ve been for the past ten years.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nNabel did not deny it. Revealing one\u2019s identity in the continent was not advisable, but at least it wasn\u2019t in front of Lorna.\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s your hometown.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t deny that either.\nLorna nodded slowly.\n\u201cNot so much knowing, but rather wondering where someone knowledgeable about spirits could have come from.\u201d\nIt was the conclusion he had reached during their time apart.\nPeople from the East continent knew nothing about spirits. Lorna himself had never even heard of spirits.\nBut Nabel seemed to know about spirits quite well.\nA place where even a young child like Nabel could have knowledge about spirits.\nThat led to the conclusion that it was an entirely different region.\n\u201cWhenever I thought about you, I would think to myself, \u2018So you were a person from the West continent\u2026'\u201d\nNabel smiled.\n\u201cI should have come a little sooner.\u201d\nHis regretful gaze fell upon Lorna\u2019s pale face.\nThe people who clung to me were afraid to approach you, so they constantly depicted you in their minds.\nHe swallowed those words.\n\u201c\u2014You look just as I had imagined.\u201d\nNain. I wanted to call you that once again.\nNabel smiled.\nA person with a scent of deep roses. Now, they would not part ways.\nI don\u2019t want to part.\n\u201cDid you think of me as I thought of you, devoting ten years solely to your presence?\u201d\nNabel had never wanted to hold Lorna\u2019s hand as much as he did now.\nIf he held her hand, that thought would undoubtedly be conveyed.\nBut hearing it directly would be an act of respect towards her. He suppressed his desire.\n\u201cHowever, if you go to the West continent like this, you may never return to the East continent again.\u201d\nThe West and East continents were far apart.\nThe area known as \u201cPinele\u2019s Bridge,\u201d a tiny region, opened its earthly path only once a month. Apart from that, one had to embark on a treacherous voyage.\nNow was an opportune moment. It was a time when one could safely cross Pinele\u2019s Bridge.\nAnd considering the difficulty of traversing such a place, one might never return to the mainland.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nHe spoke thus.\nPerhaps you should decide, as it is uncertain whether I will ever return.\nWhether you wish to truly depart this place.\nWhether it is permissible for us to journey to unfamiliar lands together.\n\u201cThe western continent\u2026 It is different from the eastern continent, you see.\u201d\nHe slowly opened his mouth. Reluctant words.\nCome with me.\nStay with me forever.\nAs I wished when I was young.\nI yearn to be together forever.\nThat was what he wanted to say. But it was merely his own selfish desire.\nNabel suppressed himself as much as possible.\nHe had not come to bind Lorna.\nHe had not forgotten Lorna, who had granted him a small but singular place of freedom.\nNor had he forgotten the magnitude of that favour.\nBecause of this, he was able to restrain his desires. He dared not act freely with Lorna.\nHad the people of the western continent, accustomed to the young tyrant of the Western Empire, witnessed this sight, they might have been astounded.\n\u201cThe western continent is incredibly vast.\u201d\nNabel finally spoke, suppressing his desires.\n\u201cIt is so vast that the monsters there are equally colossal and wicked. It is dangerous. And the people of the western continent are not well acquainted with those from the eastern continent. There will be many discomforts. Above all, this rosy-coloured hair, it is a hue that can only be seen in those from the eastern continent.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s fingertips cautiously touched Lorna\u2019s rosy hair.\n\u201cThose from the western continent consider people from the eastern continent as outsiders\u2026 It might be difficult to adapt there.\u201d\nIn the western continent, you will become the most dazzling person. Nabel spoke softly.\n\u201cI do not wish to burden you. If you desire to be in the eastern continent, then in any way possible.\u201d\nObserving Nabel listing the drawbacks of the western continent, Lorna laughed. It was as if he were laying out a tablecloth before entering a terrifying place.\nHowever, contrary to his words, his expression was earnest.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

His gaze turned towards the window, where the distant mansion loomed faintly.\n\u201cRather than such a place\u2026 it must be terrifying.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened slightly in response to his remark.\n\u201cMore than a place filled with insignificant things. But there will be better people than that mansion.\u201d\nUpon hearing her words, Lorna smiled once again.\n\u201cNabel, that is enough for me.\u201d\nLorna took hold of his hand, and Nabel understood her sincerity.\n\u201cAbove all else, I dislike being alone.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I tried to escape. If you hadn\u2019t come, I would have done it.\u201d\nIt would have undoubtedly been dangerous\u2026 Nabel took a deep breath and exhaled.\nA pent-up breath escaped him, as if he had been suppressing something.\n\u201cWell then, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nTo the mainland. To the place I have prepared for you for ten years.\n\u201cIt is permitted by the Lady.\u201d\nA very soft voice echoed.\nIn his mind, the final thread of reason snapped.\n***\nNabel escorted Lorna through the carriage that stood behind the mansion.\nThe carriage, prepared with small things, seemed to be ready to move quickly.\nThere were two carriages.\nThe maid, Lynn, got into the rear carriage with the others. It was an inevitable choice. She understood that it was for Lorna\u2019s more comfortable journey.\n[Creak!]\nThe carriage raced forward.\nLorna was someone who rarely rode in carriages in her life. Perhaps she rode in carriages a lot when she was young, but such occasions decreased when her stepmother arrived.\nTherefore, carriages ridden as an adult felt unfamiliar. Lorna looked at the people in black clothes, riding horses, who were right next to her.\n\u201cThey are all trustworthy individuals,\u201d Nabel said with a low laugh.\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019ve met many good people during your time apart.\u201d\nFortunately, it was the case. She had worried a lot about how difficult it would be to go out alone.\nA warmer smile appeared on Lorna\u2019s face.\nOf course, it must have been difficult. But she was grateful that she came back unharmed.\n\u201cNothing is more meaningful than it was at the beginning,\u201d Nabel laughed.\nThe first good person he met in his life was gazing out the window, bathed in warm sunlight.\nThe carriage journey was long.\nFortunately, there was no need to sail across rough seas. Looking at the vast ocean was a childhood dream, but she decided to postpone it for now.\nAbove all, Lorna\u2019s body had become too weak.\nExtending the journey further would be too much for her.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nAfter travelling for more than ten days, the western continent they arrived at was clearly different from the eastern continent.\nLorna saw towering trees that were so dark that they couldn\u2019t be seen at a glance. The trunks of the trees seemed as if even ten people hugging it wouldn\u2019t be able to wrap around it.\nShielding the sunlight completely, the only tree where the carriage was parked in the shade was a single tree.\n\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\nIt was as Nabel had said. This place was completely different from the eastern continent. If there were such enormous trees, the monsters would likely be as big as Nabel described.\nThat meant there would be great danger.\nIt felt unfamiliar.\n[Creak!]\nAt that moment, the carriage swayed vigorously.\nA man dressed in black, deep in contemplation, appeared, bowing his head. He was the guardian of the carriage\u2019s surroundings.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nLorna subtly inclined her head, a gesture meant to reassure, but the man\u2019s gaze locked onto the eyes of the silent Nabel.\nIt was a gaze that allowed no room for forgiveness for the two previous mistakes.\nWith a tense expression, the man conveyed his message to the coachman. The carriage moved forward with increased caution, yet swiftly.\nLorna gazed into the distance, past a towering tree, where a relentless pursuit was taking place atop a hill. These were animals she had never encountered before.\n[Roar!]\n[Snap!]\nNo, they weren\u2019t animals; they seemed more like monsters. At the end of the chase, a brown monster at the rear clamped its jaws around the fleeing monster\u2019s neck.\nAt that moment, Nabel gently covered her eyes with his hand.\nThe hand that covered her eyes felt warm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a sight worth seeing, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\nLorna acquiesced and turned her gaze inward, within the confines of the carriage. The carriage\u2019s structure was significantly different from what she remembered. She had to admit it.\nThe mainland was undeniably unfamiliar and perilous.\nYet, she remained unfazed.\nShe felt more liberated than when she was at the Rida Manor.\nIt was the first time she truly felt a breath of fresh air.\nShe took a deep breath and exhaled, smiling.\nHer heart raced.\nNabel bestowed another kiss upon her hand.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nHer delicate hand, as fragile as if it would shatter if squeezed too tightly. Nabel closed his eyes. Patience was required.\nHe wanted to ask what had transpired.\nIf anyone had wronged her, he wanted to know if they were unharmed.\nHe didn\u2019t want to leave them in the world, unchanged.\nBut he didn\u2019t want to disturb Lorna\u2019s memories.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to probe into painful pasts.\u201d\nJust like young Lorna had told him once.\nNabel let out a short, quiet exhale.\nHis mind was already filled with numerous plans.\nAmong them, there was the plan to plunge the accursed humans of the Rida Viscountcy into despair.\nHe had already acquired the means to do so.\nRecalling the report Neisha had brought, he once again tightly grasped Lorna\u2019s hand.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Standing before it were knights with a sharp and imposing presence, guarding it vigilantly.\nAnd each of them, without daring to meet the carriage, bowed their heads.\n\u201cYour Majesty..\u201d\nAnd unanimously, they uttered their greetings. It was impossible for Lorna not to hear those words. Nabel, having removed the hood of his blue robe, now revealed a splendid mane of golden hair.\nLorna\u2019s gaze turned to the golden locks. They seemed to shine brighter than the sunlight itself.\nHer gaze descended past the locks, landing on his hand adorned with white gloves.\n\u201cDo you not like this?\u201d\nNabel tilted his head slightly.\nUpon seeing his refusal to even acknowledge the title \u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Lorna realized that her suspicion might be true.\nIt was not so much surprising as it was surreal. What could have happened during his childhood that made him a slave in this continent\u2026\n\u2018Ah.\u2019\nLorna\u2019s mind quickly found the answer.\nThe day she first met Nabel. The day their eyes met on that carriage.\nThat day marked one hundred days since he had become the ruler of this western empire.\nThey said that the golden-haired, compulsive Ivor royal family had been exterminated. But it seemed that Nabel had survived.\n\u201cNabel Iber.\u201d\nAt her words, Nabel smiled.\n\u201cIn this palace, there is only one who can address me by that name, milady.\u201d\nHe whispered softly. In a moment of propriety, Lorna found herself instinctively covering her mouth. Nabel laughed once again.\n\u201cSo, please call me by that name.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened. Nabel leaned towards her.\nConversing like this felt like a dream. With a gentle smile, he spoke softly.\n\u201cI like the name you\u2019re calling me.\u201d\nThe voice of their childhood, filled with fondness, overlapped.\nLorna blushed slightly. Very slightly.\n***\n\u201cYippee!\u201d\nFox Belle seemed to regain some strength. As the carriage rode through the white castle for a while before coming to a stop, Belle playfully showed affection in Lorna\u2019s embrace.\nWith her cheeks puffed out, Belle, who had been caressing her cheeks in Lorna\u2019s arms, appeared surprised as the people outside saluted the carriage in unison.\n\u201cShall we go outside?\u201d\nNot a single pebble lay on the ground. In the innermost part of the imperial palace, called Nae Sung, which was the deepest point even within the conquered empire, there was hardly a flaw in the Emperor\u2019s residence.\nNevertheless, out of concern for their esteemed guests, a soft and plush fabric was spread before the two of them. Nabel extended his hand to her.\n\u201cThere are people outside.\u201d\nToo many. Lorna couldn\u2019t find the right words, seemingly perplexed. Nonetheless, even a fleeting glance was enough to read her mind.\nThere is no need for physical contact.\nNabel looked outside.\n\u201cDo not raise your head.\u201d\nAs his command resounded, the heads of the people all simultaneously lowered. Nabel turned to Lorna once again.\n\u201cHow about this?\u201d\nHis voice, which just moments ago had exuded dignity, now seemed like that of a different person. Lorna, in Nabel\u2019s inquiring tone, caught a glimpse of him from her childhood.\nShe smiled. It seemed that if they didn\u2019t leave quickly, the people waiting outside would become even more uncomfortable.\n\u201cIt seems a little better.\u201d\nLorna held his hand. Fox Bell jumped up and settled on top of her head.\n\u201cThis way\u2026\u201d\nNabel gently led Lorna. They passed through the maids and knights standing on either side, approaching the palace.\nYippee\u2026\nAt that moment, perhaps bothered by the crowded presence of people, Bell slipped back into the shadows. And that sight, without fail, was visible even to the maids and knights who were bowing their heads.\n\u2026\nThe astonished individuals only opened their mouths after the two had passed by.\n\u2026A mythical creature?\n\u201cCould it be\u2026?\u201d\nThey scrutinized Lorna\u2019s shadow with perplexed gazes. Then, as the shadow grew darker and a pointed ear and a shadow resembling a fox tail trembled before disappearing, they began to doubt their own eyes.\nIt truly was a mythical creature.\nSoon, rumours began to spread throughout the castle.\nThe Majesty has brought the owner of a mythical creature.\n***\n\u201cWho is this\u2026?\u201d\nDiana, the chief lady-in-waiting, had held the esteemed position in the palace for thirty years. She had faithfully guarded her post within the palace walls until the return of the Iberian royal family.\nOf course, during the Milltan dynasty, she had been demoted from her position as lady-in-waiting, as she was considered a servant of the Iberian dynasty.\nHowever, her accumulated experience as a lady-in-waiting had not been in vain.\nHer ability to manage the palace had spared her from losing her life.\nShe was a remarkable individual, known for her exceptional competence in handling matters, even in her brief stay at the palace during her younger years, which was memorable enough for the young nobleman Nabel to recall.\nTherefore, as soon as Nabel regained control of the palace, he immediately reinstated Diana as the chief lady-in-waiting and entrusted her with the management of the most beautiful and sturdy palace within the realm.\nThat palace was named Lorna. Lorna Palace.\n\u201cWelcome, my lady.\u201d\nDiana deeply bowed her head to the person Nabel had brought along.\nThe person had lustrous chestnut-coloured hair, a unique shade rarely seen in the eastern continent.\nDespite being from a different land, Diana still bowed her head. It was only natural, given that Nabel had brought this person. And she had heard a little more than just that.\n\u2018Prepare yourself, for the master of the palace is coming.\u2019\nThat was the order Nabel had given before departing.\n\u201cThe master of the palace has finally arrived.\u201d\nNabel glanced at Diana as if to say, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything unnecessary.\u201d But Diana, who knew the young Nabel well, simply received his gaze with a warm smile.\n\u201cThe master of the palace?\u201d\nLorna turned to Nabel. Nabel smiled awkwardly, as if caught red-handed, like revealing a secret diary.\n\u201cMay we ask about your names?\u201d\nDiana\u2019s words caused Lorna to look back at her.\n\u201cLorna\u2026\u201d\nUsing the surname Rida was not to her liking. Lorna finished her sentence.\n\u201c\u2026Lorna, yes.\u201d\nAt that moment, the other ladies-in-waiting around them held their breath.\n\u201cPlease lower your voice.\u201d\nThe ladies-in-waiting seemed astonished by the familiarity. Lorna tilted her head slightly. In their reactions, she glimpsed a certain sense of dread.\nMost of the people she had encountered at the Rida Mansion had been hostile toward her or had shunned her out of fear upon hearing her reputation.\nBecause of that, she had become more perceptive.\nEveryone in the corridor was watching their every move.\nIncluding Nabel\u2019s.\nAs the emperor, the highest rank even in the eastern continent, it was only natural. However, there was some distance between that and the current situation.\nIt felt as if her life was hanging by a thread\u2026\nObserving the pensive expression on Lorna\u2019s face, Diana finally nodded slightly.\n\u201cSo be it.\u201d\nA warm smile once again graced Dia\u2019s face.\n\u201cI have heard a lot about you. First, would you like to take a little rest?\u201d\nHer gaze shifted towards Lorna\u2019s legs. Perhaps due to the fatigue of the long journey, her legs were slightly swollen.\n\u201cI could prepare a massage for you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\nIt was at that moment when Diana extended her hand, as if offering to escort her.\nLorna\u2019s eyes met with the diverse array of people who were protruding their heads from the end of the corridor.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nUnbeknownst to Lorna, among them was also the knight Nisha, who had unintentionally disrupted their time together on the same continent.\nOnce again, Lorna broke out into a cold sweat.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

They were the matters that Nabel urgently needed to attend to.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s cool gaze turned in their direction. Their faces had all turned pale as if by some collective agreement.\n\u201cI will be exploring the castle for a while.\u201d\nLorna finally smiled.\nTo be sought after so fervently.\nAbove all, Nabel was the emperor of a nation. Although it didn\u2019t quite sink in yet, he tried to feel the weight of having so many people searching for and accompanying him.\nThere would undoubtedly be much busyness.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\nNabel nodded, as if there was no other choice. If it were up to his heart alone, he would want to spend the whole day with Lorna.\nThat was what he had endured ten long years for.\nReclaiming the throne that he had once had no interest in, all because he wanted to protect her in a safe place.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nHowever, it was still not entirely safe.\nNabel\u2019s sensitive instincts scanned his surroundings. Remembering the impure gazes directed towards him and Lorna, he shifted his gaze to her.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Instead, please stay in the Lorna Palace.\u201d\nIt was not a command. It was more of a request or an appeal.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHer question stemmed from pure curiosity.\nIs there really so little work left to be done?\nThe expressions of the people at the end of the corridor seemed desperate. The pile of documents they were holding was unmistakably substantial.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Outside of this palace, it is still dangerous.\u201d\nNabel smiled awkwardly, seemingly unsure of what to do.\n\u201cI will tidy up as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.\nIt seemed that the situation inside the palace was still in disarray. Lorna understood that much. Nabel, who had grown significantly, appeared before her once again.\nNo longer was he the innocent, younger brother Nabel.\nNot only had his appearance changed, but he was also needed by many people.\nAnd surely there were those who sought to harm him.\nIf the people of Milton Ga were still around.\n\u201cI won\u2019t go far. I am tired as well.\u201d\nLorna smiled reassuringly, as if to put Nabel at ease. He gently took and released her hand.\n\u201cI will finish quickly and come back. Rest well.\u201d\nA soft voice echoed through the hallway. It was a warmth reserved only for her.\nThe noble individuals were too focused on his other words to hear it.\nHis promise to tidy up as quickly as possible.\nIt was no different from saying that a storm was brewing.\n***\n\u201cI never imagined I would be serving the owner of a spirit beast.\u201d\nDiya, the chief maid, wore an expression of astonishment. By her side, Lin supported Lorna\u2019s frail body.\n\u201cThis is a fragrance I have never encountered on the continent\u2026\u201d\nUpon Lin\u2019s words, most of the inhabitants from the western lands were taken aback. Compared to those from the west, the people from the east had more delicate skin, requiring careful attention.\nFurthermore, Lorna\u2019s state of health was far from satisfactory. It had reached a point where calling a physician was necessary before even considering massage treatments.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\nDomo, the palace\u2019s resident physician, happened to be the son of the royal physician. Observing Lorna\u2019s condition, he spoke with a perplexed expression.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a suitable place for her. We should start with small portions and gradually acclimate her to the cuisine of the western lands\u2026\u201d\nHearing those words, Diya called for another maid.\n\u201cConvey this to the head chef. Prepare a portion of mium for Her Majesty\u2019s guests.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe maid promptly exited through the corridor to deliver the message.\n\u201cThe mium that will be served to the owner of the spirit beast\u2026\u201d\nThe repeated use of the term \u201cspirit beast\u201d unsettled Lorna. Above all, she keenly sensed their atmosphere.\nThey referred to her as a spirit beast upon seeing the bell. They were starkly different from the people in Count Lida\u2019s entourage, who had accused her of being a demon\u2019s summoning tool.\nRather than regarding her as a cursed being, they treated her with utmost reverence, as if beholding a deity.\nLorna gazed down at the bell.\n\u2018The owner of the spirit beast\u2026\u2019\nEven if the bell were truly a spirit beast, there was nothing I, as the bell, could do.\nReceiving such attention was unfamiliar to me.\nThose who occasionally treated me as a noble lady, showering me with lavish care, turned their backs on me, calling me a cursed demon for whom magic did not work.\nThat\u2019s why it was frightening.\n\u201c\u2026Diya.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nDiya respectfully lowered her head.

His summon was a lion, and he used powerful magic to protect the Kingdom of Iber. If he hadn\u2019t encountered a tragedy\u2026\u201d\nDiya couldn\u2019t continue her sentence.\nLorna turned to face her.\nHe seemed to understand why people held mythical creatures in such high regard.\n\u201cCould it be that after his passing, Militan instigated a rebellion?\u201d\nIf that were the case, it made sense. It was around ten years ago, just as Diya had mentioned. She nodded slightly.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct. His lion summon possessed truly formidable magic.\u201d\nDiya didn\u2019t say anything further, but it was clear that she, along with the others, had high hopes for her.\nLike the Grand Sorcerer Pell, they wanted her to protect the Kingdom of Iber with a mythical creature by her side.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s possible, I will do it\u2026 but\u2026\u201d\nIf it was an attainable task, Lorna had no reason to refuse. The problem lay in the fact that Bell seemed to lack strong power.\nLorna smiled awkwardly. Whether she realized she was being talked about or not, Bell suddenly popped out from her shadow.\n\u201cOh my!\u201d\n\u201cIs that person\u2026\u201d\nPeople gasped and bowed their heads in awe as they beheld the divine figure. Though their reverence did not match that of the royal court, it was clear that they were displaying utmost respect.\n\u201cGoodness gracious\u2026!\u201d\nBell let out a yawn, whether or not he garnered attention, resting in Ronae\u2019s embrace. Ronae smiled, her face tinged with embarrassment.\nExpectant gazes were fixed upon them.\nThe Grand Magician, guardian of the Ivor dynasty.\nThose who had high hopes for such power.\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t perform magic.\u201d\nBefore expectations could escalate, it was better to swiftly deny them.\nRonae feared being embraced by anticipation only to be discarded.\nMore precisely, she feared the turning away of those who had approached her with warmth.\nEveryone on the continent was like that.\nShe did not want to experience such rejection even in this place.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter, my dear.\u201d\nHowever, the response from Lady Diya was unexpected.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nRonae turned to look at her again.\n\u201cEarlier, the owner of the divine creature, Mr. Pell, was a grand magician\u2026\u201d\nHad he protected the royal court with that immense magic?\nHowever, her thoughts seemed to be slightly misguided. Diya responded with a gentle smile.\n\u201cWell, Mr. Pell is the owner of the divine creature, after all.\u201d\nLady Diya laughed.\n\u201cMr. Pell couldn\u2019t use magic either. Instead, the divine creature possesses incredible magic. Do you see that tower over there?\u201d\nDiya pointed outside the window. Within the palace grounds, there stood a towering structure with a spiral staircase encircling its circumference.\n\u201cThe 9th floor of that tower is the seat of the divine creature. It\u2019s the ninth step that reaches the deity.\u201d\nWith wide eyes, Diya kindly explained to Ronae.\n\u201cSo, you see, the divine creature is considered the most powerful magician in existence.\u201d\nMerely by that fact, the owner of the divine creature deserves respect. They are the master of such mighty power.\nRonae\u2019s eyes widened at her words.\n***\nNabel was in his study. The time he spent travelling to the Eastern Continent was about a month, including the time taken for thorough preparations and bringing Lorna back.\nThere was a lot of work that had piled up. The stubborn remnants of the Rebellion had not completely disappeared from the court.\n[There are still those supporting the Rebellion within the court. In particular, Lord Roud, who you have been keeping an eye on, is gradually showing signs of movement.]\nHe began reading the reports.\n\u201cI should have brought you here after ensuring greater safety, Your Majesty\u2026.\u201d\nHowever, he couldn\u2019t afford to delay any longer.\nThe temple that had been disrupted by the attack of the Heretics had finally settled the civil war after ten years.\nAnd the first one to be labelled as a \u201cdemon\u201d was Lady Yeongae, also known as Countess Rida, whom they intended to deal with.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel tilted his head slightly. In the first place, it was absurd to accuse her of being a demon.\nEven on the Eastern Continent, the higher authorities of the temple would not have been oblivious to the existence of gods. How could they completely overlook that existence when they worshipped the same deity?\nYet they sent the Inquisitor without any hesitation?\nAs soon as he heard the news, he set off for the Eastern Continent. It was suspicious to anyone. He didn\u2019t disregard Lorna\u2019s danger.\nAnd ultimately, his judgment was correct.\n[Upon further investigation, it has been confirmed that the Inquisitors who were assassinated at that time were not affiliated with the temple. They have been identified as unidentified assassins.]\nIn other words, they were not from the temple. One could only assume that someone had manipulated the situation.\nThe role of an Inquisitor is to bring the Heretics and torture them.\nIf so, the true purpose of those impostors must have been to secretly take Lorna to an unknown place.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel narrowed his eyes and continued reading the reports.\n[As Your Majesty suspected, the temple is oblivious to the Inquisitors.]\nThose who sought power had their eyes on Lorna. That much was clear.\nAnd in the current situation, there was only one place that required powerful magic.\n\u201cNisha.\u201d\nKnight Nisha was waiting outside. He entered the room immediately.\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty. Your command?\u201d\n\u201cFind out the connection between the Eastern Continent and the temple of the gods.\u201d\nIf Miltan\u2019s Family in the temple was conspiring with the power of the gods to overthrow Iberia, it made sense.\nThe problem was that the will of the gods\u2019 masters was likely to be completely indifferent.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel burned the reports. Bringing Lorna to the Iberian palace before it was too late had been an excellent choice.\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u2019\nAnd that was what she wanted. Nabel closed his eyes.\nHe couldn\u2019t let the person who had trusted him fall into danger.\n\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\nNabel gave Nisha a few more orders.\n****\nNews of the arrival of the owner of the divine beast quickly spread throughout the palace.\nAs Archmage Pell was assassinated, the Ivor royal family gradually crumbled.\nWith no one unaware of this, the people of the capital rejoiced.\nAt least, that was the case for those who followed Emperor Nabel Ivor.\nHowever, there were also those who doubted the true identity of the owner of the divine beast.\n\u201cIs it truly him?\u201d\n\u201cCould it be that someone impersonated the owner of the divine beast after seeing Pell?\u201d\n\u201cThe owner of the divine beast cannot be someone who appears so frequently.\u201d\nIn reality, Archmage Pell was indeed the owner of the divine beast, the first to appear in the western continent in 400 years. It had been about ten years since Pell\u2019s death. Even the closest interval was still too short.\n\u201cHe is the one brought by Your Majesty. Be careful with your words if you don\u2019t want your head to roll.\u201d\nThe Chancellor, Diya, strictly enforced such restrictions on those individuals. However, they could not completely prevent such people.\n\u201cYour Majesty, Duke Loudon is requesting an audience.\u201d\nNabel received his fourth guest today. Even though he had returned to his duties after only a month, this was exceptional.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel narrowed his eyes.\nThe Loudon family undoubtedly had connections to the Miltan family.\nAs a prominent family of the founding heroes of the Western Empire, they had not lost their influence even when the Ivor royal family collapsed and the Miltan family rose to power.\nInstead, the Miltan family relied on the Loudon family to survive.\nThat meant Duke Loudon had sold information about Ivor.\nIn fact, Nabel had been chased by Duke Loudon\u2019s knights before setting foot on the Eastern Continent.\nAlthough it happened when he was young, he vividly remembered the emblem of that family.\n\u201cAllow him to enter.\u201d\nHowever, there was still no concrete evidence.\nNabel\u2019s first act upon ascending to the emperor\u2019s throne was to delve into the thoughts of those around him. He differed greatly from the previous Ivor emperors, who detested the ability to read minds at a mere touch.\nIn the recollections of Ivor that he remembered, people despised this power.\nIt was not solely due to the fact that some of the previous Ivor emperors, who had embraced this ability, were betrayed and met their demise.\nThose who could read the thoughts of others were well aware that human thoughts were akin to reeds.\nThe reason they abhorred this ability was the wretched thoughts that were laid bare with each touch.\nThey too yearned to trust and live comfortably among people.\nHowever, there was not a single person in the world whom they could trust.\nEven between a married couple sharing a bed, the situation was no different.\nThe previous Ivor emperors were plagued by intense mistrust of humanity.\nStress was their constant companion.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe fact that Ivor suffered from compulsions was a misconception.\nHe simply no longer desired to read the thoughts of others through physical contact.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nBut Nabel was different. Nabel actively utilized that ability. And the betrayers were swiftly dealt with, their evidence discovered in advance.\nThe method was simple.\nAll one needed to do was shake hands.\nThus, the phrase \u201cdeath\u2019s handshake\u201d came into existence less than a year ago. During that time, dozens of individuals had their thoughts revealed to Nabel through the pretext of a handshake. Over half of them perished.\nNo one dared to dismiss the young emperor, who possessed an uncanny ability to unearth the charges of betrayal.\nDue to the unknown nature of Ivor\u2019s ability, it seemed as if he possessed remarkable information-gathering capabilities.\nHowever, Lord Gould, too, was one of the individuals who managed to evade Nabel\u2019s \u201cdeath\u2019s handshake.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe evidence of Lord Gould\u2019s betrayal was undeniably evident.\nYet capturing the evidence proved to be no easy task.\nLike a crafty survivor, he always managed to cover his tracks and dispose of the evidence before Nabel could gather it.\nEven Nisha, who had traipsed through battlefields with Nabel, was appalled by his cruel methods.\n\u201cYour Majesty, I pay my respects.\u201d\nNabel regarded Lord Gould, who bowed before him.\nHe knew full well that there was no trace of respect in that gesture.\nLord Goun, though seemingly dismissive of the young emperor, possessed the ability to read minds, which often revealed even the most trivial of thoughts.\n\u201cYou recently travelled to the Eastern Continent, I hear. You have no idea how worried we were, as you gave no indication,\u201d said Nabel.\nIndeed, if he had given an indication, assassins would surely have followed, but there was nothing to disclose. Nabel raised the corner of his mouth and chuckled.\n\u201cI cannot fathom the extent of your concern.\u201d\n\u201cWe are relieved to see you unharmed.\u201d\nLord Goun, now sixty years old, bowed his head once again, his greying hair subtly nodding. With a smooth smile, he began to speak.\n\u201cI always believed in your wisdom, and I trusted that you would return safely. However\u2026 rumours have circulated that an unidentified woman has entered the palace recently, which caused me great concern, leading me to seek you out.\u201d\nMore likely annoyance than concern, Nabel narrowed his eyes.\nThe rumour that Lorna was the owner of the Divine Beast had already spread throughout the capital. Those who sought to exploit her abilities would not warmly welcome such news.\n\u201cUnidentified, you say.\u201d\nLord Goun faltered at the low voice, but soon regained his composure, gracefully smiling as he responded.\n\u201cYes. There are rumours of her being the owner of the Divine Beast, but isn\u2019t it something we won\u2019t know until we climb to the top of the tower? I bring this up not to inconvenience you, but out of concern for Your Majesty\u2019s safety, as there still seem to be impure forces lingering. Please do not take offense.\u201d\nIt seemed as if he had coated his tongue with oil. Nabel narrowed his eyes.\nEven without holding hands, Nabel understood Lord Goun\u2019s intentions. The top of the Imperial Tower, the ninth floor, was the place where one could reach the Divine. It was the tallest structure in the entire empire.\nAnd it was there that the owners of the Divine Beasts underwent their trials. Nabel, the only direct descendant of the Iber royal family, was well aware of this.\nThe Archmage Pell had also undergone the trial.\nTo be exact, it was the act of leaping off the tower.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Therefore, if one were the true owner of Shinsu, they would suffer no harm even if they were to leap off that tower\u2026\nSuch was the ignorant yet simple principle.\nThose who had impersonated the owner of Shinsu were all exposed there. No matter how high-ranking a sorcerer they were, no one could properly perform flying magic in the vicinity of the towering nine-story structure where the winds of the heavens blew at will.\nThe impostors all perished.\nThere was no chance for Lorna to meet her demise by leaping off. From her ability to conceal herself within shadows to her vigilant guardianship, Belle was undoubtedly her Shinsu.\nThe problem lied in the fact that one had to enter the pinnacle of that tower, aLorna. It would be risky if there were any external interferences.\nThe duke spoke in a mellifluous voice.\n\u201cFurthermore, I heard she hails from the eastern continent. Even Your Majesty must be aware of the reputation of the eastern continent.\u201d\nWhat followed was as Nabel had anticipated. The trial of the tower seemed to be revealed prematurely, but at the very least, he had expected the reluctance towards someone from the eastern continent.\nWesterners do not trust those from the east.\n\u201c\u2015A place where liars reside, who neither know of the existence of Shinsu nor believe in the gods.\u201d\nYes, for that reason. Nabel chuckled.\n\u201cYou must be aware that I spent my childhood in the eastern continent.\u201d\n\u201cI have heard that it was only for a brief period.\u201d\nIt was indeed a brief time, but it was the happiest moment in his entire life.\nNabel briefly reminisced about the days he had spent with Lorna. Then, he gestured.\n\u201cI understand that there are others who share your thoughts. We shall take measures promptly.\u201d\nHe had not brought her here merely as the owner of Shinsu. Shinsu was merely an incidental matter.\nOf course, if Shinsu could protect the Eberian royal family, nothing could be better. However, above all else, he respected Lorna\u2019s wishes.\nWould Your Grace wish to engage in activities that harm people?\nLorna knew he was not only far removed from cruel deeds, but she had never even touched a fly.\nThere are ways to place you within the palace that do not solely revolve around being the owner of Shinsu.\nOf course, the choice was up to Lorna.\n\u201cGo and see.\u201d\nPonder deeply, if you will. He gestured once again.\n***\nOn that fateful night, Lorna found herself on the third floor of the palace bearing her name. The room prepared for her seemed to have materialized out of thin air, even though it had only been hastily arranged today.\nAs if it had been awaiting its rightful owner for ages.\n\u201cHis Majesty has commanded us to make preparations for the mistress of the palace,\u201d announced the courtier.\nIt appeared to be the correct answer. Lorna thought of Nabel, whose face would flush whenever she heard the name \u201cLorna\u2019s Palace,\u201d and she couldn\u2019t help but smile.\n\u201cWell then, please rest deeply,\u201d said Chancellor Diya, bowing deeply, before withdrawing from the doorway.\nWith no lights on inside the room, once the door closed, Lorna was left aLorna in darkness.\nThen, from behind Diya, there came a sharp knock on the door. Surprised, Diya turned around and lowered her head.\n\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHush.\u201d\nA disturbance was unwelcome. Nabel knew well that Lorna was sensitive even to the slightest indication of her presence at the door.\nThat\u2019s why she had deliberately dismissed the knights assigned to protect her.\n\u201cLady.\u201d\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s face showed signs of fatigue. Although he had come only to handle urgent matters, time had taken its toll. Nevertheless, he smiled.\n\u201cMay I come in?\u201d\nNabel once again recalled their childhood days.\nThe days when it didn\u2019t feel awkward for the two of them to share the same bed.\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\n***\nNabel was clad in a lightweight shirt, a stark contrast to the resplendent gold-adorned uniform he wore in his office. But now, with the intention to reveal his personal time, he settled for a single shirt.\nHaving recently taken a bath, there emanated from him a refreshing fragrance, even more invigorating than usual.\nExquisite.\nHe quietly sat on Lorna\u2019s bedside, not far from where she sat upright.\nThe moon shone brightly, reminiscent of that night ten years ago when he departed.\n\u201cDo you remember when we were young?\u201d Nabel suddenly inquired. Lorna turned to look at him.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cBack then, you used to suggest that we fall asleep together.\u201d\nAt Nabel\u2019s words, Lorna blushed. It seemed he had refused her when they were young.\nWith flushed cheeks, she assured him that it was alright and that she had slept on the floor with a mat.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t it very uncomfortable?\u201d Nabel asked. In retrospect, it must have been incredibly uncomfortable for someone of noble lineage to sleep on the floor. Furthermore, her bedroom floor was merely unrefined wooden planks.\n\u201cBut it was still nice,\u201d Lorna replied. Nabel turned to face her, and their gazes met.\nIn that moment, Lorna observed the grown-up Nabel once again.\nHis bright blue irises, sparkling, were just like when they were young.\nThe only difference was that he was now looking down at her instead of up. He had truly grown up all of a sudden.\nThe once tender shoulders of a child had broadened and strengthened, and his hands had grown much larger than hers.\nBut most notably, there was a change near the back of his hand.\n\u201cThis\u2026,\u201d she said, as even in the moonlight, the slightly rolled-up sleeve revealed his hand. His hand bore numerous scars on the back, as if it had endured countless wounds and healed repeatedly.\nLorna took hold of his hand, feeling the coldness of his palm.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve suffered a lot,\u201d she said.\nShe had known. When he left, Nabel was Lorna. Although he had the ability to read minds, what use would that have been on the battlefield?\nRumours of the Western Continent reached the Eastern Continent. The Miltan royal family had fallen, and the Iber royal family had taken its place once again.\nAnd he, the fair-haired young boy who had rolled through battlefields and led those who followed him alone.\nHe had spent nearly ten years on the battlefield, from his tender age until now.\n\u201cYour Highness, you have truly endured much hardship,\u201d said Nabel, nodding.\n\u201cI lived as if you were by my side,\u201d Lorna answered.\nNabel smiled. It felt as if she had only been in this room. It always felt the same to her.\nWanting something had been a thing of the past, before she had even met Nabel. She had yearned to grow up as a noble lady, to have everything she desired within her grasp, and to be raised while surrounded by dolls and elegant things, conversing with other young noblewomen.\nBut she couldn\u2019t have that. Having lost everything because of a curse, she had learned the art of giving up first and foremost.\nHoping for something and anticipating it only led to disappointment.\nSo, from some point onward, she had developed a habit of considering the worst possible situations.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAnd throughout those ten years, the worst situation she could imagine was being dragged to the temple and killed. But since that hadn\u2019t happened, she had managed quite well. She laughed.\nNabel understood her mindset better than anyone else.\nThat she had always lived by sacrificing something.\n\u201cThis palace is called the Lorna\u2019s Palace,\u201d Nabel said, diverting the topic. Her soft voice filled the room. She gazed at Nabel, who was still basking in the bright moonlight.\nYes, he had changed once more. Now he no longer hid his radiant blond hair. In his youth, he had worn black hair to conceal his status.\n\u2018I like you.\u2019\nPerhaps it was because it was a day similar to that day. Lorna suddenly recalled the young voice from the day he had left.\nHe had promised to return and save her.\nAnd he had kept that promise.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe found herself looking into Nabel\u2019s profound eyes.\nDo you still feel the same way?\nShe wanted to ask. But both she and he had grown too much to suddenly bring up memories of their childhood.\nAbove all, the position of an emperor was not a place where such words could be spoken lightly.\n\u201cI hope the palace pleases Your Highness,\u201d Nabel said, smiling. Lorna gazed outside.\n\u201cThere were many people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

A mere brush of the hand was enough to read thoughts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that there are many such people.\u201d\nLorna was genuinely relieved. She had worried about anyone who coveted her wealth and power, even the Viscount of Rida. How many more would be after the Emperor?\nHaving many trustworthy individuals was a good thing.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel closed his eyes slightly.\nIf it weren\u2019t for that, he might not have been able to bear it.\nI want to hold your hand.\nYou are the one I want to read thoughts from the most.\nBut I was afraid, so I couldn\u2019t read them.\nHe thought it was fortunate that Lorna didn\u2019t have the \u201chand that reads the truth.\u201d Truly.\nIf he could see inside his pitch-black mind, he wouldn\u2019t be able to sit beside me like this.\nFor ten years, while being separated from you, I have never forgotten you for a moment.\nThe ones who had targeted me wouldn\u2019t dare to target you. So, I just kept running forward, looking only ahead.\nIf desire hadn\u2019t entered me during that time, it would have been a lie.\nI wanted to touch your delicate fingertips even once more.\nI wanted to receive permission to touch the lips that I couldn\u2019t covet when I was young.\nI wanted to cry and bury myself inside you, saying that I ran for you, endured hardships for you.\n\u201cNabel?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s cautious voice pulled him out of his desire. Nabel smiled softly.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nLorna gazed at his serene face.\n\u201cI may not know the laws of the Imperial Empire, but\u2026\u201d\nLorna looked out the window.\n\u201cThe guests cannot stay in the castle for long, can they?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel grew momentarily curious, wondering if she could perceive his dark thoughts. Had even a trace of those murky musings ever grazed her fingertips? Was that why she inquired about such matters at this very moment?\n\u201cYou may stay forever,\u201d she uttered.\nAnd thus, her childhood yearning, the desire to remain together for all eternity, sprang forth with undiminished fervour.\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cBut is it truly acceptable? Huangseong\u2014\u201d\nThis was a place where not just anyone could enter, and I was neither a resident of the mainland nor a familiar figure. Such ruminations had occupied my mind throughout the day, as I entertained the notion.\nShe was Emperor Nabel Iber\u2019s guest. However, as a guest she remained. For a guest could never stay indefinitely in this realm.\n\u201cNunim, I am here.\u201d\nHer words faltered, stifled by Nabel\u2019s subdued voice. He offered a faint, unrestrained smile.\n\u201cStay with me. Otherwise, I shall not endure.\u201d\nLorna hesitated, his whispered words resembling an entreaty.\n\u201cThe closer we become, the more difficult it becomes.\u201d\nAs if we were within arm\u2019s reach, so near.\nNabel murmured,\n\u201cI cannot divert my gaze from you.\u201d\nSince the day I met you, until this very moment.\n\u2018I love you.\u2019\nHer gaze held a depth far greater than the confession of their youth. Lorna acknowledged her words.\n\u201c\u2026Thank you for loving me.\u201d\nPerhaps it was the memory of that moment, a phrase spoken long ago, that slipped from his tongue. Lorna spoke, then hesitated unknowingly.\n\u201cHowever\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNunim\u2014\u201d\nIt was still a predicament.\nAbove all else, he was the emperor of the Western Empire. His union was not meant to be solely founded on love.\nWhat a dilemma\u2026\nHis previously narrowed eyes widened.\nNabel reached out his hand. Unable to audaciously caress Lorna\u2019s cheek, his trembling fingers brushed against her hair.\n\u201cNunim, are we still\u2026 forbidden?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s words faltered.\nNabel\u2019s gleaming eyes met her gaze.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel hadn\u2019t forgotten those words, of course.\nHe longed to steal a kiss from those small lips.\nSuch an impulse overcame him, but since he hadn\u2019t received permission, he contented himself by lightly touching her forehead, and like a thief in the night, he disappeared.\n\u201cAre you saying that it\u2019s still impossible between us?\u201d a low voice resounded in the room.\nNabel tilted his head slightly.\n\u201cIs it still impossible?\u201d\nIs it because I\u2019m younger than you? Or am I such an inadequate person compared to you?\nOr is it something else\u2026?\nIt was then that Lorne spoke.\n\u201cThere will be many who oppose.\u201d\nChoosing an empress is not an easy task.\nHer thoughts approached as if they were within his grasp.\nNabel raised his head.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about what others think.\u201d\nBecause I want you.\nIf you also want me.\nThe distance between the two narrowed.\nNabel saw her hand resting on the bed.\nIn that moment of holding that hand, he would find his answer.\nNot about emperors, betrothals, or any of that, but about her pure thoughts.\nWhether she wanted to stay by my side, here, or if she wanted to leave.\n\u201cMay\u2026 I hold your hand?\u201d\nStill, he couldn\u2019t dare read her mind freely.\nHis hand did not grasp Lorna\u2019s hand; it lightly touched her side instead.\nHis body leaned closer to Lorna.\nSeveral times, he moved as if he wanted to take her hand, but he stopped moving and let out a breath.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not possible, if you won\u2019t grant permission, please tell me.\u201d\nWith these words.\nHis hand traced Lorna\u2019s soft lower lip.\nTrembling fingertips gently brushed across her lips.\nIt was a delicate touch, as cautious as touching the thin ice on a shallow puddle that would shatter even with a slight touch.\n\u201cCan\u2019t we still be together?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s response was impulsive. It was that quick.\nNabel chuckled softly. It was a far more positive answer than being rejected altogether.\nAt least, even without holding hands, Lorna could know that they shared the same feelings.\nIt was endearing.\nNabel, with a low chuckle, gently took hold of Lorna\u2019s wrist. His hand traced the inside of her wrist.\nAs if feeling for a pulse, he lifted only two fingers and softly brushed where her pulse beat with his thumb.\nAnd then his hand grasped her slender wrist.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe wanted to embrace her tightly.\nHe wanted to leave his mark all over her.\nA dangerous desire began to consume his mind. But it wasn\u2019t the time yet, not yet.\nAbove all, she was exhausted from the long journey. Dr. Dommello had said that her body was too weak, to the point where she had to start with small meals.\nHe couldn\u2019t torment such a person. Even if it would become a sweet time like honey, he didn\u2019t want her to suffer and be in pain.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel took Lorna\u2019s hand lightly. His lips touched the back of her hand, as if pleading.\nIt wasn\u2019t a hand with meticulously groomed nails like those of other noble ladies. Rather, it was the worn-out nails of someone who had gone through a lot.\nMoreover, the hand was as pale as if it hadn\u2019t seen the sun. It must be that she hadn\u2019t been exposed to the sun much.\nA soft, brief kiss landed on the hand.\nPassing over the slightly protruding finger bones, his soft tongue briefly touched between her fingers before retreating.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nIt was the moment she thought it tickled. Lorna blushed slightly at the tingling sensation that crawled up from her hand.\n\u201cMadam,\u201d Nabel called her in a low voice.\n\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s breath was slightly rough. There was no way she could not know what he wanted.\nThe person she had always regarded as her younger brother had now become a man.\nAnd he was speaking assertively.\n\u201cDo not see me only as your younger brother anymore.\u201d\nIt was a sweet voice.\nAs if one word from you could determine everything.\nLorna looked at him.\n\u201c\u2026Of course, it would be better for you to become a king.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe raised the back of Lorna\u2019s hand and kissed her lips once more.\n\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want you to be disliked by others.\u201d\nI hope you won\u2019t be disliked by others like me.\nHer heart was conveyed through the touch of his fingertips, and Nabel closed his eyes.\n\u201cThere was only you for me a long time ago.\u201d\nOnce again, a soft sound filled the room. This time, his lips touched the tender flesh on the inside of her wrist. When he wet his hand behind her, she could feel a faint, throbbing pulse. Nabel pressed his lips there firmly. A small trace was left behind.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still the same now.\u201d\nNabel spoke while looking at it. His hoarse voice simmered.\n\u201cEven if I am disliked by others, it doesn\u2019t matter to me. Is that still okay?\u201d\nNabel tilted his head slightly.\n\u201cEven so, do you still want me to become a king?\u201d\nA king who will never cease to be loved by everyone?\nLorna looked into his blue eyes at Nabel\u2019s question.\nThe choice was hers.\nIf he became a tyrant, he would have the freedom to do whatever he pleased.\nEven their marriage would not be a problem. The Iver royal family had been a powerful dynasty that had wielded great authority for generations.\nHe too had undoubtedly inherited the blood of Iver, so it would be possible.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel did not urge her for an answer. He kissed Lorna\u2019s wrist once again.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

With his legitimacy as the enemy\u2019s nemesis and his prowess, he could have easily reigned as a tyrant.\nBut he had no desire to do so if Lorna did not wish it.\nNabel\u2019s eyes sparkled dangerously, and Lorna nodded slightly. The long contemplation came to an end.\n\u201c\u2026Yes, become my holy warrior,\u201d she said.\nThe atmosphere of the imperial court was already reminiscent of a tyrant\u2019s reign.\nLorna realized it as she looked into his eyes.\nThe gazes of the people she had seen since morning. The fear hidden within them.\nIt was clearly directed at Nabel.\nHis gentle demeanour existed only here.\nThe appearance of a tyrant must have been necessary to stand aLorna.\nLorna undoubtedly embraced the Lornaliness that must have plagued him.\n\u201cWell then, will you stand by my side?\u201d Nabel asked in a low whisper.\nHis fingertips slid slightly inward from Lorna\u2019s wrist. His smooth hand trailed down her arm.\nThe elbow rested comfortably in one hand. His hand slid further up her arm. This time, his lips touched her round shoulder.\nCompared to his shoulders, which had become robust from wielding a sword for a long time, her shoulders were small and slender.\n\u201c\u2026Yes,\u201d Lorna nodded slightly.\nHer flushed cheek reflected in Nabel\u2019s eyes. She could also sense his slightly accelerated breath.\nThey were very close.\n\u201cTo become my holy warrior\u2026 there must be a reason between us,\u201d she said.\nWhile he, as a tyrant, could do everything as he pleased, it was not the same for him as a holy warrior.\n\u201cWe must make those who dare to demand a reason between us understand,\u201d she said with a tone of disapproval.\nIt didn\u2019t sit well with her.\nLorna turned to face him.\nHe, who seemed slightly grumbling, met Lorna\u2019s gaze from a close distance.\n\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d he asked, nodding his head slightly in response to her words.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Nabel replied.\nThe hand holding Lorna was already warm.\n\u201cFor example, I need something like ambition.\u201d\nIt was when Lorna\u2019s eyes widened.\nNabel looked at her and kissed her forehead.\nIt was a light kiss, like the nights they used to part when they were young.\nIt also felt like a knock.\nAs if I could explore you a little more.\nWide-eyed, Lorna looked at him. She did not reject him.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nWith a low laugh, Nabel kissed the tip of her nose.\nThen, he gently explored her upper lip. Again, like a knock, he lightly brushed her lower lip, causing Lorna to exhale briefly.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nTheir gazes briefly met.\nNabel was no longer young.\nHis hand firmly held her hand and pushed her slightly closer.\n\u201cYes, such ambition,\u201d he said.\nHis lips overlapped with Lorna\u2019s again. This time, it wasn\u2019t a gentle kiss like before. He explored Lorna\u2019s breath with a somewhat rough touch.\n\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s deepening unease was palpable, rendering him lightheaded to the point where his strength waned.\nThe two individuals, standing at a proximity that seemed as if their eyelashes could touch, exchanged glances.\n\u201cRather than warmth from you, it is an insatiable desire for heat that I yearn for.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s breath grew slightly ragged.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, you\u2019re free to push me away.\u201d\nHis voice was resonant, akin to something simmering at the back of his throat. His gaze remained fixed upon Lorna.\n\u201cIn that case, I will step back.\u201d\nHe had not forgotten the promise they made as children.\nTo refrain from doing any harm to her.\nBut if she desired him.\nNabel pressed his lips against the tip of her nose once again. Lorna did not push him away.\nShe couldn\u2019t even flinch. It wasn\u2019t because he forcefully held her wrists. He treated her with utmost care.\nAs if she mustn\u2019t have the slightest blemish. Like the most precious gift in the world.\nHis words, assuring that he wouldn\u2019t cause her harm, were unlikely to be false.\nEven without hands capable of reading the truth in her, she could still discern it.\nThat\u2019s why Lorna did not break free from his grasp.\n\u201c\u2026Look at me.\u201d\nLorna, as if drawn to him, met his gaze.\nHis lips brushed against her slightly parted ones.\nLorna\u2019s body leaned onto the bed.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

It was as if they were suppressing something.\n[Hush]\nAfter gazing into each other\u2019s eyes for a while, he pressed his lips against Lorna\u2019s forehead. A sweet sound echoed strangely in the room. Unconsciously, Lorna closed her eyes. It was a reflexive response.\nMeanwhile, lowering his head, Nabel left his mark on her collarbone.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nLorna took a deep breath. Nabel gently caressed her wrist as if everything was fine.\n\u201cHow much I\u2026,\u201d he muttered in a hoarse voice, his words lingering around Lorna\u2019s throat.\nI wonder if you know how much I longed for you, like a dark abyss.\nWould you know that I thought only of you during those years on the battlefield?\nWhile I desired you so fervently, did you also desire me?\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s body trembled. Nabel\u2019s breath brushed against her collarbone. He lowered the other hand that had been pinning Lorna against the wall and placed it above her chest.\nA soft mound met his touch. It was what he had always desired.\nShe seemed so far away, beyond his reach.\nIn her childhood, she had only wanted his lips. No, she believed that time spent with him would be enough.\n[Hush]\nHis lips met the starting point of the soft mound. His hand slipped her white dress, revealing her shoulder. A tantalizing sound resonated in the room. It was the sound of fabric desperately maintaining its form.\nNabel slightly raised the soft mound. Lorna\u2019s body quivered with the stimulation.\nChildhood.\nFrom the moment he left the mansion, he never looked back.\nHer sanctuary was also his sanctuary. Despite the tormenting mansion, her room was a more comfortable space than any heaven guarded by gods and angels when they were aLorna.\nThat\u2019s why he didn\u2019t look back. Even in his childhood days, he knew himself well. If he were to turn back, he would crumble and fall.\nAs the yearning to seek refuge overwhelmed him, he may have willingly closed his eyes, seeking solace. However, he could not allow himself to do so.\nOn the day he cleared away the thorny vines in front of her room, he made an irrevocable decision.\n\u201cI will rescue you,\u201d he declared with unwavering determination.\nWith resolute steps, he forged ahead without looking back. Your face flickered in his mind. On that day, the day of parting, he yearned for the stolen taste of your lips.\nI wonder if you are well. An anxious turmoil stirred within him. He longed to personally verify every inch of your delicate fingertips, like this.\n\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\nHis tender lips glided through the crevice between Lorna\u2019s bosom. A gentle tug, and eventually, Lorna\u2019s weakened will succumbed, and her buttoned attire parted to receive his lips.\n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s body quivered. Her breath, saturated with the scent of rich roses, enveloped Nabel.\nYou are unharmed. You are by my side.\nAs he left the mansion, he yearned for her more and more. The petty thief who once craved only time and kisses now desired something greater.\nI want to bury myself in your chest.\nI want to be completely embraced within you.\nI wish only to be by your side.\nDesire bubbled up within him. It was still the same even now.\n[Swoosh] The fabric slipped off Lorna\u2019s shoulder. The clothing draped over her inner arm barely concealed her bosom. Nabelbriefly nestled his head above her exposed bosom, then lowered his gaze.\nHis tongue lightly grazed her nipple. Lorna\u2019s body quivered.\n\u201cMmm!\u201d\nShe seemed startled by the intense stimulation. Nabel tightly grasped her wrist.\nHe circled his tongue around the nipple held within his mouth. His tongue flicked up and down, pressing firmly against the peak.\nEcstasy.\nNabel pulled her white back into his embrace.\nHer clothing slipped down, fully exposing her back. Nabel\u2019s knee touched the ground in front of her foot.\nHis lips trailed downward.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna felt as if scorching liquid had been poured onto her chest. At first, her lips were cold, but gradually they warmed up. It was unclear whether it was his touch or her body that was heating up.\nWith every trace he left while teasing her with his tongue, her body trembled. When her legs weakened and she tried to lean against the wall, his strong arm encircled her and pulled her close. As if it were impossible for her to lean on anyone but him.\nThen, when Nabel\u2019s lips slid down to her lower abdomen, Lorna gasped in surprise.\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\nUnconsciously, his name slipped out like a sigh.\nNow Lorna\u2019s white dress was wrapped around her waist. It no longer served its purpose of concealing the owner\u2019s body. Instead, it draped over his arm, exposing her completely.\nThough Nabel\u2019s arm was covered by the fabric, the heat emanating from his arm was transmitted directly to Lorna, as if there were no barrier between them.\nNabel buried his face in the secret depths of her lower abdomen. His lips, freed from the confines of her undergarments, touched the dense thicket of rosy pink.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nLorna quivered, as if his lips would continue to slide down to her most intimate place. Her hand gripped the bed sheets tightly.\n\u201cYou can push me away if you want.\u201d\nNabel whispered softly. As his warm breath touched the most secretive and sensitive part of her, a tingling sensation spread throughout her entire body.\nIt was akin to fear or goosebumps, yet different. It was a type of pleasure Lorna had never experienced before.\n\u201cWith this hand.\u201d\nNabel guided her hand to his head. The hand that had been holding her wrist now rested on top of Nabel\u2019s head. Lorna could feel his soft, blond hair beneath her fingertips.\nIt felt like caressing a child. But he was no longer a child.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything you dislike, my lady.\u201d\nSo do as your heart desires.\nWhispering, he once again kissed her lower abdomen. His body, which had been parting through the dense pink thicket, descended further.\nThe arm that had supported her white dress lowered her undergarments down to her ankles. Lorna blushed as she exposed herself to a stranger in the cool air.\nBut at the same time, she felt a peculiar sensation. A moistness that was gradually spreading below.\nNabel tilted his head inward, exploring her depths.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nAt that moment, Lorna\u2019s waist trembled. It was because of Nabel, who had discreetly kissed the most intimate place, teasing her c**toris with the tip of his tongue.\nThe most direct stimulation spread throughout her body. Instantly, her legs trembled and quivered. Nabel slipped his arm inside her knee, firmly embracing her leg.\nA gasp escaped her lips.\nLorna contorted her body, not out of dislike, but in an attempt to endure the intense stimulation. It felt as if she would crumble and collapse any moment.\nAs her body trembled, Nabel, who had been holding her hand, moved his hand downwards.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

With his index finger erect, he smoothly slid his moist fingertips into the already wet lower part.\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\nHis finger delved inside her. It moved deeper into the innermost depths, as if scraping something from within, beyond the entrance.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nThe sensation was peculiar. Lorna lifted her leg as the finger probed her insides. Nabel\u2019s hand, firmly grasped between her legs, explored her innermost depths more earnestly.\nA moist, squelching sound filled the air around them. Goodness, Lorna\u2019s face blushed intensely.\nBut there was no room for other thoughts.\nAnother finger entered her v*****l canal.\n[Squelch, squelch] The sticky sound echoed once again. Nabel moved his fingers in a crossed pattern, as if expanding that space to its fullest extent. A cacophony resounded throughout the room.\n\u201cHuh, uh\u2026\u201d\nIt was strange. From her lower abdomen, a pleasurable sensation surged upward, causing Lorna\u2019s waist to tremble. She forgot about trying to cover her intimate parts.\nAs they approached climax, her legs gradually lifted higher. The panties, barely clinging to the tips of her toes, dangled limply on one side.\nIn that state, when Nabel penetrated her innermost depths with a sharp thrust, her leg lifted high.\n\u201cAh, yes!\u201d\nHe may not have realized it, but he had touched a delicate place within her, a wall unknown until now. Lorna\u2019s body quivered with a different intensity than before. A brief climax rippled through her.\n\u201cYou cannot fathom how long I have awaited you, nor the thoughts I have harboured,\u201d he murmured softly. His lips, lovely and bathed in light, pressed firmly against her gentle contours, teasing her with his tongue.\n\u201cAhh!\u201d\nA sigh escaped her lips. Nabel grazed the inside of her knee with the tip of his foot, causing her dress to glide down to her ankles. The sleeves of her dress, now resting upon her arms, became tender restraints, binding her hands behind her back.\nIn that vulnerable state, Nabel positioned himself between her parted legs.\n\u201c\u2026Nabel.\u201d\nShe called out his name with a breathless voice, her face flushing deeply. Nabel, keeping her leg draped over his shoulder, leaned forward to explore her depths.\nAs her legs spread open, a soft rustling sound echoed upon the bed. His breath, damp and intimate, caressed the moist warmth between Lorna\u2019s thighs.\nHe slowly beheld the sight beneath Lorna, taking it all in. The sweet essence seeping from her opened legs captivated his gaze.\nOf course, Lorna couldn\u2019t help but feel it too. Her face flushed a crimson hue, unable to hide her embarrassment.\n\u201cYou are exquisite, my lady.\u201d\nNabel inclined his body toward her, pressing his lips against the curve of her knee, gradually trailing down to the innermost recesses of her thigh.\nHe delicately pulled aside the edges of her dress that still clung to her, allowing his mouth to explore the sensation of the fabric grazing her abdomen.\nOnce he fully removed the dress, the pent-up heat dissipated, leaving her thighs pleasantly cool. However, an enigmatic warmth began to emanate from within.\n\u201cI yearn to torment you further.\u201d\nHere.\nNabel extended two fingers and placed them at the starting point of her delicate curls. His fingertips glided along the contours, venturing toward the hidden realm beneath the dense pink foliage.\nAnd as his fingers exerted pressure, the ample flesh concealing her c**toris yielded, and his fingertip found its apex.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s waist jolted upwards with a tingling pleasure. Nabel whispered softly,\n\u201cThis place too.\u201d\nThe gliding fingers found their way more smoothly into the depths this time. Two fingers aLorna couldn\u2019t reach her end, but they provided enough stimulation.\nFor him, for her.\nAs the sensation of scratching and penetrating the sensitive inner depths surged, Lorna\u2019s body trembled once again. However, that was as far as it went.\nToo narrow.\nNabel bit his lip. Even his fingers couldn\u2019t grasp tightly enough to thrust and shake within the tightness. So, Nabel explored her lower region once more.\nA dark mind buried deep in my heart.\nIt wasn\u2019t yet, it wasn\u2019t yet. That\u2019s why he suppressed his desire that stood rigidly enough to ache and buried his face in her secret garden.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nHer legs rose high.\nThe slickness coated his fingers, tempting him. Yet, Nabel restrained himself until the very end.\nInstead, he lay down beside her, turning to his side.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nAs his fingers stroked a different angle inside the delicate entrance, Lorna\u2019s moans leapt higher. It was a breathtakingly sweet sound. Nabel bit his lips until they bled, struggling to restrain himself.\nHis erect member throbbed prominently, proudly displaying its presence without being released from its buckle.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nWhen Nabel\u2019s possession grazed against her hip bone, Lorna flinched.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, my lady,\u201d Nabel whispered in a low voice. I want to enter you right now. I want to thrust my desire into you with a force that would break my waist.\nI want to drive it into you until it mingles and spills with mine, deep inside you.\nThe taste of blood returned to his lips. The finger that was ravishing Lorna\u2019s secret garden tightened with a powerful grip.\n\u201cHnngh!\u201d\nOnce again, a sticky liquid trickled out from the depths of Lorna\u2019s climax and drenched his hand.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

He restrained his desires to a visible extent in Lorna\u2019s eyes, refusing to fully indulge in his temptation.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nHis fingers, one by one, found their place against her lips, never straying from Lorna\u2019s gaze. She was always the one to avert her eyes, her cheeks blushing with intensity.\n\u201cDo you find me repulsive?\u201d\nWith those words, she could not help but turn back to him. As Lorna looked back with a flushed face, Nabel smiled softly and planted a kiss on her cheek.\nAs if leaving a trace of his lips, her cheeks blushed even deeper.\n\u201cYou must be exhausted. Sleep now.\u201d\nHe acted like a caretaker, nurturing her until the early hours of the morning. As Lorna narrowed her eyes, Nabel smiled again.\n\u201cI played a little mischievous trick.\u201d\nIt was more than just mischievous. As her ears burned crimson, Nabel burst into laughter.\nHe nibbled gently on Lorna\u2019s ear.\n\u201cCome, let\u2019s sleep.\u201d\nHe pulled the blanket up to her neck. While he hoped she would fall asleep warmly, there were other desires growing within him.\nAbove all, it seemed he couldn\u2019t resist himself. The dishevelled sight of Lorna under his hand was irresistibly provocative.\nJust a little, he wanted to taste a bit more.\nThere were only the two of them in the bedroom. No one to disturb them.\nHe wished time would stop flowing like this. The bedroom was solely their space, meant for just the two of them.\nThat\u2019s why he didn\u2019t want to let go.\nOnce the sun rose, all sorts of meddlers would undoubtedly interfere.\nNevertheless, he was content with the trembling hands of desire resting upon Lorna\u2019s chest.\n[Tap, tap] If it seemed unbearable, he gently tapped to wish her a good sleep.\n\u201cYou were always sensitive to external noises, my dear\u201d\nLorna turned to him, and he gestured towards the outside.\n\u201cMake sure there are no passersby until tomorrow morning.\u201d\nSo don\u2019t worry and sleep soundly, he whispered.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLorna pulled the blanket a little higher. It was warm.\nHer room in the Rida Mansion was always chilly. But this place was the complete opposite.\nIt was soft and warm. Above all, Nabel, burning with intensity, provided her with a sense of stability.\nThroughout the long night, Lorna reached a mysterious climax several times, yet Nabel always stopped right at that moment.\nBecause he sensed her fatigue.\nAnd Lorna, understanding his consideration, felt grateful and apologetic.\n\u201cDo we still not have each other, my lady?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nShe slipped back under the covers, closing her eyes and reopening them to find the situation unchanged.\nI reunited with Nabel once again.\nAlthough we had been apart for ten years, our hearts remained the same.\nNo, they had progressed further.\nShe no longer had the will to reject Nabel.\n\u201cWell then, I can\u2019t bear it anymore.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t be cruel enough to ignore his pitiful voice, as if in pain. More than that, she desired him.\nIf only I wouldn\u2019t be a hindrance to you.\nThat was the last thought that crossed her mind.\n\u201cIs it okay for me to think this here?\u201d\nLorna asked subtly. Nabel nodded in response.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you desire.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026It might harm your reputation.\u201d\nAn emperor emerging from a woman\u2019s bedroom. It was the perfect gossip.\nNabel chuckled.\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s better for me, wouldn\u2019t you be surprised?\u201d\nAs Lorna widened her eyes, Nabel waited, covering her two eyes with his hand as if signalling her to close them, as if to sleep.\n\u201cYou told me to become someone good for you.\u201d\nHe whispered. His lower voice sent shivers down Lorna\u2019s spine.\nQuivering lips touched her neck and then retreated.\nNabel\u2019s exhaling breath reached her. It was scorching.\n\u201c\u2015Though I\u2019d like to dismiss all the gossip about Lady Nabel in my heart, since you asked me to become a saint\u2026.\u201d\nHe let out a short sigh.\n\u201cI\u2019ll offer an excuse.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026What kind of excuse?\u201d\nLorna inquired. Within his hands, her long eyelashes fluttered slightly.\nFinally, Nabel released his hand from her eyes. Their gazes met.\n\u201cThe current Emperor Iber received the protection of the gods.\u201d\nNabel pressed his lips against her cheek once more.\n\u201cMy father was the same way.\u201d\nIf it was her father, it must have referred to the emperor before the collapse of the Ivor dynasty. Lorna recalled the stories she had heard during the day.\nThen, the owner of the divine beast that protected Nabel\u2019s father would have been the archmage, Fel.\n\u201c\u2026The archmage Fel?\u201d\nNabel nodded in response to Lorna\u2019s words.\n\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve heard the stories.\u201d\nHe said with slightly narrowed eyes.\n\u201cWhen it comes to marrying the owner of a divine beast, no one cares about your background, Your Highness.\u201d\nIf one was the owner of a divine beast, it didn\u2019t matter if they were from the eastern continent, nobility, or commoners. The owner of a divine beast held tremendous power.\nNabel knew that she couldn\u2019t use her powers because of her poor physical condition. He had already heard about her medical examination results from Domo.\nRida Manor\u2026\nThinking of the faces of the Earl and Countess of Rida, he tightened his grip and then relaxed his hand. It was something outside of Lorna\u2019s line of sight.\n\u201cIf I use that excuse, I could become a saintly warrior.\u201d\nNabel bowed his head towards her.\n\u201cBut I prefer something other than that excuse.\u201d\nLorna peeked out from under the blanket.\nAdorable.\nNabel couldn\u2019t resist and kissed her lips once again.\n\u201cCan I tell you what I want?\u201d\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a saying, \u201cBedhead Priestess.\u201d\nIt refers to a wife whispering her desires to her husband in bed. But in their case, it was the opposite.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

He whispered softly to Lorna, as if reciting a secret incantation, and the intimate tone flowed between them.\n\u201cI dislike being called \u2018Dr. Rida.'\u201d\nIt was an objection to the title attached to his name.\nLorna paused at his words, sensing a denial of a part of herself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Your Highness.\u2019 I dislike that you have to use the name of Count Rida,\u201d he said.\nBefore any misunderstandings arose, he already understood her thoughts. Even without physical contact, he could discern such matters.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the name you dislike, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt seemed he recalled the moment when she mentioned his name during the day, in front of the Duchess Dia.\nLorna slightly lowered her head.\nNabel\u2019s hand enveloped her neck.\nThe gentle touch, tilting her chin, was nothing but tender.\n\u201cSo, how about another name?\u201d\nNabel chuckled.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say, \u2018Phon Iber.'\u201d\nIt was his name. Lorna gazed at him, and Nabel inclined his head slightly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a good name in return.\u201d\nNabel playfully nibbled at her ear.\n\u201cGive yourself to me.\u201d\nHe whispered in a low voice.\nIt almost sounded like the voice of a mischievous child. Lorna couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.\n\u201cAlright, then.\u201d\nLorna turned her body towards him, and their breaths mingled in close proximity.\n\u201cAs the mistress of my heart, I shall take your name.\u201d\nHer heart leaned towards him. It was her decision.\n***\nIn the end, Nabel didn\u2019t step out of her room until the break of dawn. The moment he stepped outside, rumours would inevitably spread.\nBut Nabel seemed unconcerned, as if it were of no consequence to him.\nInstead, his preoccupation lay elsewhere.\n\u201cIn the continent of Serdar, the masters of gods were the guardians of the nation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDo you not wish to be recognized as a master of gods?\u201d Lorna looked up at him. By now, the two of them were basking in the sunlight streaming through the curtains. She shielded her eyes with her hand, the glistening blond hair dazzling, partially obscuring his face.\nThen, she clearly observed the negative expression that had been consistently present on Nabel\u2019s face whenever the topic of being a master of gods was discussed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t dislike it. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s treacherous,\u201d Nabel replied, his voice tinged with a slight grimace.\nHe didn\u2019t want Lorna to suffer any longer. That\u2019s why he endured for ten years with that intention. He didn\u2019t want her to go through more hardships.\nAnd so, he wanted to give her a perfect place.\nA place where there was no need for treacherous tasks.\n\u201cIt may lead to war or harm to others.\u201d\nHe spoke, a slight hint of disapproval creasing his features.\n\u201cSo, if you don\u2019t want it, you don\u2019t have to be a master of gods.\u201d\nUltimately, that was what he wanted to convey.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need those who oppose. I can simply love you, my lady.\u201d\nLove you more, fight for you.\nHe seemed to grumble a little, while being embraced by Lorna.\nLorna gazed at Nabel\u2019s face, illuminated by the sunlight.\nIt seemed as if she could see the familiar face of their childhood. He narrowed his eyes slightly, looking up at Lorna.\n\u201cWhy? Because it feels awkward?\u201d Nabel smiled, wondering if he still seemed unfamiliar to her, now that he had grown up.\nEventually, Lorna nodded her head. \u201cA little.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that way,\u201d he replied.\nNot even a bit. Nabel leaned his face against Lorna\u2019s chest once again.\n\u201cFor ten years, I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment. To give everything to you, my lady. Just like how you gave me sanctuary.\u201d\nHe had wished for nothing more than to do nothing, to avoid suffering, and simply enjoy the pleasures of life. But it seemed that his lady did not desire such things.\nShe\u2019s a peculiar person.\nNo one willingly endures hardships to live. Everyone who came into contact with him felt the same.\nBut why are you so peculiar?\n\u201cTo be acknowledged as the master of the divine beast, you must undergo the trials of the tower.\u201d\nEven after warning her about the possible dangers, she did not retreat.\nYou\u2019re strange in that way.\nYou\u2019re strange and strangely charming.\n\u201cJust\u2026 you don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\nBut please don\u2019t get hurt. Nabel spoke desperately, his thoughts consumed by the fear of parting ways again.\n\u201cIn that case, you\u2019ll marry someone without any reason or clear social status.\u201d\nHe may be labelled as a tyrant who fell in love with a woman. Nabel shrugged his shoulders.\n\u201cWell, that wouldn\u2019t be a flaw.\u201d\nDo you think I would simply let those who call my lady a flaw go? His eyes glimmered with danger once again.\n\u201c\u2026Someone more beneficial to your position might come along by your side.\u201d\nSomeone who can empower your royal authority. Lorna had already understood Nabel\u2019s heart.\nYet she couldn\u2019t help but speak words that were grounded in reality.\nThere were the expectations of the entire empire resting upon him. Many burdens weighed on his shoulders. Sometimes, he had to make choices he did not desire.\nIn that case, someday, he might consider taking in a new woman for the sake of a stronger imperial authority.\n\u201c\u2026,\u201d he fell silent.\nLorna had never realized how possessive she could be. The mere thought of such a situation made her uncomfortable.\nShe didn\u2019t want to miss out on happiness.\nLike the sweet candy that was briefly given and then disappeared ten years ago, she hoped that the reunion with Nabel would not end in tragedy.\nPerhaps it was because she had lacked much happiness in her lifetime. Once she grasped something, she didn\u2019t want to let it go.\nSo maybe that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t easily accept his feelings.\n\u201cDo you want someone else by my side?\u201d\nA faintly sinking gaze fixated on her.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Lorna recalled the depths she had once read about in a book.\nIt was said that even though the surface may be calm, one could never predict what might happen in the depths.\nNabel\u2019s eyes reflected that sentiment. His gaze was serene, but only Nabel knew what thoughts were simmering in his mind.\n\u201cTell me you only want me.\u201d\nHe had been drawing me for ten years.\nThinking about how I had grown, I hoped to find you like this, thinking of myself.\nPlease say it like that.\nIntense eyes stared at her.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\nPlease don\u2019t leave. Nabel pleaded earnestly.\n\u201cStill, as the master of the divine creature, I will be by your side.\u201d\nNo matter how dangerous it may be, I couldn\u2019t bear to give in. Lorna said.\n\u201c\u2026It could be dangerous.\u201d\nNabel closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to think about the name of Lord Goun, the unpleasant one, in this bed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to just be by your side without doing anything. You tried to protect my sanctuary too.\u201d\nShe distinctly remembered the time when young Nabel had vomited on her body.\nThe day he cleared the vines in front of her room with his small hands.\n\u201cI will do the same. I want to be your ornament.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d\nNabel buried his face in her embrace.\n\u201cI told you. I want you to hold my secrets, to control me with my leash.\u201d\n\u201cThen, let me be the master of the divine creature.\u201d\nIn the end, Nabel was the person Lorna could not defeat.\n\u201c\u2026I will prepare myself to take the test.\u201d\nAnd when you become the owner of the divine being, when you stand by my side, I will turn this place into the coziest sanctuary.\nPromise me.\nNabel tightly held her hand.\n***\nOn that morning, the imperial palace buzzed with the rumours of Nabel.\n\u201cA woman from the Eastern Continent?\u201d\n\u201cHush now. She is said to be the guest of His Majesty.\u201d\n\u201cBut still, a woman from the Eastern Continent\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Did they spend the night together?\u201d\nWhispered discreetly, the rumours spread little by little, eventually circling back to the palace.\nNaturally, the rumours reached even the Imperial Guard of Nabel.\nThe Imperial Palace of the Serene Empire was divided into the Outer Court and the Inner Court.\nAmong them, Nisha of the Zeroth Knights, responsible for the Inner Court\u2019s security, found herself entangled in a perplexing debate from morning till night.\n\u201cDid she spend the night?\u201d\n\u201cSurely, she must have.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, did she sleep soundly, or\u2026\u201d\n[Thwack!]\nNisha swiftly struck her comrade\u2019s back before he could make a slip of the tongue. The audacious ones who dared to inquire about the nocturnal activities of their lord were none other than the Emperor\u2019s personal guards.\nThey were loyal to the House of Eber, the former ruling family, and had fought alongside Nabel for nearly a decade.\nIt was quite a transformation for those of noble lineage.\nThe Imperial Knights adhered to strict rules as they were closely associated with the imperial family.\nHowever, the Zeroth Knights, to which Nisha belonged, were slightly different. Their tasks were more akin to those of intelligence agents than knights.\nA trusted group upon whom Emperor Nabel Eber could rely.\nThat was the most accurate description for them. As a result, they had to lend their ears even to the rumours within the palace.\n\u201c\u2026In the end.\u201d\nIt seemed that the rumours were becoming clearer as they approached Lone Mansion. Nisha furrowed her brow at the increasingly distinct speculations.\nUndoubtedly, Duke Lound would admonish not to neglect the other fine young ladies of the Serene Empire while an uncertain woman of unknown origin was making such fuss.\nSimultaneously, he would subtly introduce his own daughter, a twenty-year-old duchess-in-waiting.\n\u201cHow did he sedate her?\u201d\nContemplating such matters was part of the Zeroth Knights\u2019 mission. After spending a decade on the battlefield, their noble dignity had eroded considerably, but their esteemed background was still helpful in times like these.\nThere were few who were as well-versed in politics as they were.\n\u201cNisha, my lady!\u201d\nSomeone called out to her from afar. Approaching swiftly was Archmage Lucel, one of those who had fought alongside Nabel on the battlefield and had become a member of the Mastaba due to his prowess in magic.\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\nIn response to Nisha\u2019s question, Lucel rushed over, his face filled with concern.\n\u201cHis Majesty is preparing for the Tower\u2019s trial!\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\nNisha felt as if her mind were aflame, silenced by the wise judgement of her lord that had rendered the Marquis of Lowe speechless.\nThe Marquis of Lowe no longer dared to question the origins of Lady Lorna.\nYet, the Marquis of Lowe remained a man bound by the strictures of tradition.\nHe had merely escaped execution due to the lack of evidence.\nIn light of this, he had no reason to welcome the return of Lord Iver to the House of Huang.\nThus, there was only one answer.\nHe would undoubtedly resort to any means necessary to hinder their progress!\nNisha, her mind entangled with plans to escort Lorna, tore at her own hair in frustration.\n***\n\u201cYour Majesty, the situation remains tumultuous. Particularly concerning are those remnants of the opposition still lingering.\u201d\nNabel sat perched high, his chin resting on his hand, enduring the hours-long discussion.\nHe had never attended the council with such indifference before.\nDespite resolutely ousting the dissenting faction, he retained loyal followers because he was an emperor who pondered the future of the empire.\nThose who had endured the relentless onslaught of opposition in recent years could only welcome his reign. As soon as the dynasty transitioned, internal strife broke out among them.\nThey were not interested in the empire\u2019s future.\nThey pursued only personal gain.\nHad it not been for Nabel, the empire would have fractured into four or five pieces due to the opposition\u2019s dynamite.\n\u201cTherefore, I implore Your Majesty to pay attention to the rumours. We mustn\u2019t give them a chance to disrespect you.\u201d\nHowever, as he continued to listen to such discussions for two hours, Nabel found himself adopting a slightly disengaged posture.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

They yearned to intertwine their blood with the royal family using any excuse.\n\u201cScoundrels.\u201d\nNabel narrowed his eyes. He despised those who would sell their own children for their personal ambitions, trampling on others\u2019 lives to climb the ladder of success.\n\u201c\u2014Of course, Your Majesty, there would be no one who dares to find fault with that. However\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\nNabel raised his hand, silencing the nobles.\n\u201cBy now, it should suffice to understand how well the nobles\u2019 offspring have grown.\u201d\nNabel stood up. He had no intention of indulging in any more boasts about his daughter. The scathing tone of his words hushed the assembly.\n\u201cI am well aware of the turmoil plaguing the nation.\u201d\nEven those who had supported the Miltan dynasty had not yet been fully sorted out.\nThey had not been able to cleanly deal with the aftermath, as if they were clutching a weapon ready to slit their throat but failing to sweep up the mess.\nYes, even those individuals.\nHis gaze drifted and settled upon Lord Goun, who had constantly vied for his daughter\u2019s hand.\n\u201cYour Majesty, the individual residing in Lorna\u2019s Palace is an unverified newcomer from the Eastern Continent. It would be advisable to distance yourself from them, even now\u2026.\u201d\nLord Donat, speaking with a worried tone, was a very close friend of Duke Lourdes.\n\u201cThese lowly individuals dare to mock the royal family. Your Majesty\u201d\n\u201cI, spending the night with a woman whose identity remains unknown?\u201d\nNabel chuckled, not denying it.\n\u201cI suppose rumours about this \u2018unknown\u2019 person have spread.\u201d\n\u201cI have heard rumours that you are the owner of Shinsoo\u2026\u201d\nLord Donat replied in an unwilling voice. The nobles who had just entered the palace for the council looked at each other with astonishment.\n\u201cThe owner of Shinsoo?\u201d\n\u201cAlready?\u201d\n\u201cIt has been only about 10 years since Fel passed away\u2026\u201d\nIt seemed that the rumours had not yet spread beyond the castle walls.\nBut now they will spread through them.\nNabel didn\u2019t want people to pay too much attention to Lorna.\nHe knew that the more people became aware of it, the more those who sought it would increase.\nWhether he was a good or bad person, it didn\u2019t matter.\nFor some irrational reason, envy and jealousy began to arise.\nMoreover, if he were the owner of Shinsoo, the attention would only increase.\nIt was especially obvious how those who followed the secret sect would react\u2026\n\u201cAs the owner of Shinsoo, I will take your name.\u201d\nHowever, it was Lorna\u2019s choice.\nAs the owner of Shinsoo, she would take the name Phon Ivera.\nHer words, in other words, were a proposal to be recognized as the owner of Shinsoo and to marry.\nNabel closed his eyes and opened them again.\n\u201cEven if Shinsoo has revealed herself, it is still uncertain whether she is truly the owner of Shinsoo, Your Majesty.\u201d\nLord Donat spoke up once again.\nIt seemed as though he was presenting his cautious stance, but there was only one thing he desired.\nTo prevent the owner of Shinsoo from firmly establishing her position.\nAnd to create a flaw somehow, to exile her from the Ivera royal family, and, unnoticed by anyone, to kill her or seize the ownership of Shinsoo in secret.\nNabel had no intention of watching over it.\n\u201cThen, let us proceed with the examination of the Tower.\u201d\nWasn\u2019t this what they had desired?\nHe chuckled smoothly.\nWhile they prepared for the examination, they would have their eyes on her.\nA strict escort would be necessary. However, there was no other choice.\n\u201cPrepare immediately for Matop, Ilera. Once the owner of the Divine Beast has recovered, we can proceed with the examination. And as for me\u2026\u201d\nNabel drove the point home.\n\u201cIf she is acknowledged as the owner of the Divine Beast, we intend to proceed with the nuptial ceremony as planned. Does anyone have any objections?\u201d\nNabel tilted her head slightly. The crowd fell silent.\nThe bombshell statement made by the Emperor, who had previously shown no interest in women, echoed in the council meeting.\nThere were no superficial issues.\nAs long as it was certain that she was the owner of the Divine Beast, regardless of her origin, it would not be a problem.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nBut the nuptial ceremony involved multiple vested interests.\nPeople looked at each other with various expressions.\nIn particular, Duke Loud\u2019s face was barely able to maintain its composure.\nNabel let out a smooth smile.\nOnce the Tower\u2019s examination was successfully completed and the nuptial ceremony took place, she would drive them away and make this place a safe haven.\nNext, it would be time to sweep away the mainland\u2019s temples and ridaga.\nThe cursed woman, you say?\nNabel raised the corner of her mouth and laughed.\nThose who dared to disrespect her would be punished.\nFrom ten years ago until now, and in the future, everything had been a step toward providing solace to Lorna.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The task he had postponed for a month to rescue Lorna now overlapped with his preparations for the tower\u2019s examination.\nMagicians who wanted to meet the owner of the Divine Beast were scattered throughout the country.\nMoreover, according to the protocol, one priest from each region had to come to the temples across the continent to authenticate the owner of the Divine Beast.\nOf course, those priests were high-ranking magicians, as they served the gods.\nWith all those individuals appearing as distinguished guests, there was no shortage of matters to attend to.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNevertheless, Nabel did not cease his work.\nHe wanted to fulfill whatever Lorna desired, at the very least. Like in her childhood, he didn\u2019t want her to give up on what she wanted.\nWhile he was busy with his work, Lorna received visits from new individuals.\n\u201cLady Lorna, the magicians from the Tower of the Magicians have arrived.\u201d\nLorna received the visit of new individuals that day.\n\u201c\u2026From the Tower of the Magicians?\u201d\nLorna hesitated.\nShe couldn\u2019t help but have a negative impression of magicians. For a moment, Lady Rida, the Countess, came to mind before she dismissed the thought.\n\u201cYes. They have something to convey regarding the tower\u2019s examination and the owner of the Divine Beast. Shall I let them in?\u201d\nIn reality, the tower\u2019s examination was merely a procedural issue. Since the Divine Beast had already revealed herself in the shadows, there was no doubt that Lorna was the owner.\nMost of those who insisted on the examination were either tiresome individuals who focused on her lineage or had ulterior motives.\nLorna gazed out the window.\nShe was watching Nabel, who was working in the distance.\nFrom the terrace in the rooms on either wing of the U-shaped Lorna\u2019s Palace, they could face each other. Just as she could see Nabel from her room.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel willingly came out to the terrace to work on a sunny day. Each time he turned a page of his papers, he glanced at Lorna.\nHer sparkling golden hair stood out particularly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d\nWith a smile forming on her lips, she rose from her seat.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nAs Lorna moved, Nabel looked at her with a puzzled expression.\nThen, upon hearing the news that a request for an audience had arrived, he stepped inside the room.\n\u201cNisha, find out what\u2019s happening in the guest quarters.\u201d\nMany people in the Western Empire took an interest in her. However, there were few who could be considered trustworthy. Caution was necessary.\n\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\nAt his command, Nisha scrutinized the direction where Lorna was.\nAnd she was astonished.\nWhy had those damn magicians barged into the guest quarters!?\n***\n\u201cI apologize for appearing before you without making proper arrangements.\u201d\nThe sorcerers surreptitiously stole glimpses of Lorna\u2019s shadow.\nTheir scholarly curiosity, which consumed half their lives, was evident.\nAs if sensing their discovery, a Belle suddenly sprang forth from the shadow.\n\u201cOh!\u201d\nStartled, the sorcerers recoiled.\nTheir gazes shifted back and forth with the movement of the Belle.\nBelle, who leisurely circled around Lorna, hopped up and settled in Lorna\u2019s arms.\n\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\nIn response to Lorna\u2019s inquiry, the sorcerers bowed deeply.\n\u201cWe came with the desire to meet the master of the divine beings, even if only once.\u201d\nA seemingly young sorcerer blurted out.\nAt that moment, the elderly sorcerer smacked him on the back.\nEight bracelets jingled in unison on the wrist of the elderly sorcerer.\n\u201cWe heard that you are going to undertake the tower\u2019s trial. It is our duty to inform you of the precautions.\u201d\nLorna nodded slowly.\nNabel had mentioned that the tower\u2019s trial could be dangerous.\nShe adjusted her posture and sat up straight.\n\u201cMay I briefly examine the divine being?\u201d\nIntroduced as Lucel, the elderly sorcerer cautiously received Belle in his arms.\n[Creak]\nBelle glared at him disapprovingly in his embrace. Startled, Lucel gingerly placed Belle on the floor.\n\u201cExcuse me for a moment.\u201d\n[Flash!]\nA strong light erupted from Lucel\u2019s hand.\nIt was then. In that instant, a startled Lorna flinched.\nThe teacup that housekeeper Diya had placed for her moved significantly.\nIt was an instinctive reaction.\nUnaware that tea was spilling, Lorna shielded her eyes with the hand holding the cup. Only belatedly did she realize her hand was scalded.\n\u201c!\u201d\nThe scalding tea water soaked not only her hands but also her legs. Her skin began to smart and sting.\n\u201cLady Lorna!\u201d\nThe one most surprised by the grand reaction was the sorcerer Lucel.\nIt was only after he shouted that Lorna belatedly put down her teacup, understanding the situation.\nIt was the cup she had been gripping so tightly that her hand turned pale.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nIt was the scalding hot water she had just put down in haste.\nLady Diya urgently exclaimed, \u201cBring cold water!\u201d\nThat\u2019s when it happened.\nBelle hopped up and perched on top of her head.\nThen, she radiated light from her entire body.\nA faint, gentle stream of water flowed onto her hands and legs, as if being careful not to harm her skin.\nPassing through the fox\u2019s body as if to say, \u201cDo not be hurt,\u201d the cold water poured down. Her legs were faintly visible through the thin dress.\nSurprised, Lady Diya brought a towel and covered the front of her legs.\n\u201cThank you, Belle.\u201d\nLorna caressed Belle\u2019s head.\n[Swish] Her tail wagged.\nAfter all the water had poured down, Lady Diya covered her legs with a towel.\n\u201c\u2026Were you greatly startled?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Deities who live in shadows naturally do not cast shadows even when exposed to light\u2026\u201d\nThe sorcerer Lucel rambled on.\nIt was because he had seen the appearance of the terrace across from him so clearly. Nisha, who was surprised, was rushing out onto the terrace.\nThat meant he had noticed this situation. Lucel\u2019s face turned pale.\nKnight Nisha, who guards His Majesty, couldn\u2019t possibly keep this matter from him.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nLorna said, looking at her flushed hand. Lucel let out a deep sigh.\n\u201cI will postpone the other checks for a while. I apologize for startling you.\u201d\nHe bowed deeply.\nHe was practically a wounded dignitary in the royal court. His face still bore the pallor of distress. It was the first time in his decades-long life that he had suffered such a heavy heart.\nAs Knight Nisha approached to assess the situation, it felt as if he were being pursued by a divine messenger.\nI wanted to leave this room as quickly as possible.\nBut I had unfinished business. Otherwise, I would become an even greater sinner.\nHe opened his mouth quickly.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026You must regain your health before the next examination. Although you may appear small now, as you cultivate your strength, you will grow much larger and more powerful, capable of using formidable magic. The condition of a deity depends on the state of their master.\u201d\nYou must keep that in mind. Lucel bowed deeply.\n\u201cAnd the trial of the tower is not something difficult. Of course, it may be frightening, but the deity will protect you.\u201d\n[Kyaang!]\nBelle hopped up and settled on Lorna\u2019s shoulder as if responding to her question. Looking at Belle, who puffed out its cheeks as if reassuring her, Lorna asked,\n\u201cIs there a chance of being attacked during the trial?\u201d\nShe recalled Nabel\u2019s story from last night.\nIt might be dangerous.\nBut Lucel shook his head.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like that. You will enter the tower alone. And the content of the trial is to jump from the ninth floor of the tower, where intricate whirlpools are entwined.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\nWhat came to mind at that moment was the day she almost slipped from the railing before parting ways with Nabel, back when they were young.\nJust like that day, Belle would protect her. She felt certain.\nThat was when it happened.\n\u201cLorna, Lady Nisha is here to see you.\u201d\nIt was the voice of Chamberlain, Diya.\nBehind her, Nisha stood with a troubled expression.\nHer hair was dishevelled, as if she had been tormented by anguish.\nAnd Lucel\u2019s face turned pale.\n***\nThe cluttered room was swiftly tidied up, thanks to the skillful guidance of Lady Diya.\nThe maids, who moved noiselessly as befitting their duties in the palace, restored her chamber to its pristine state, just as they did before the tea cups were spilled.\nOf course, they didn\u2019t forget to cover her hands and legs with soft cloth and apply a soothing ointment to her skin.\nIn case she would be bothered by the pungent smell of the medicine, they also lit scented candles by her side to put her mind at ease.\n\u201cI am Knight Nisha,\u201d she introduced herself.\nAfter the arrangements were completed, Nisha deeply bowed to Lady Lorna.\nIt was a gesture of utmost courtesy offered to the owner of the divine beasts.\n\u201cI have heard that you have been informed of the Tower\u2019s examination procedure,\u201d Nisha addressed Lorna.\nHe glanced at the anxious magicians huddled in the corners.\nThe magicians, on the verge of losing their freedom, trembled with fear.\nIt was evident what the outcome would be since they had harmed His Majesty\u2019s honoured guest. Moreover, there were even rumours that this honoured guest had spent the previous night with His Majesty.\nIn the places where Lorna couldn\u2019t see, the magicians, whose future had become uncertain, were tearing their hair out.\n\u201cYes, I have heard,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cPlease lower your voice. I am not someone worthy of being elevated,\u201d Nisha said with a bow.\nNisha, too, bowed deeply.\nHe didn\u2019t want to be in a precarious situation like the magicians, with his neck on the line.\nBeing so close to Nabel, he couldn\u2019t be unaware of his master\u2019s intentions. Furthermore, those who served Nabel had already begun to predict the future based on the fact that he had spent the night in the guest room.\nHe would become the Empress of the Western Empire.\nNabel had never been interested in women before. The fact that someone like him had crossed the continent to bring her back, and even called her \u201cmilady,\u201d was extraordinary.\nSince then, the rumours had been abundant, but spending the night was unexpected. It was even said that she didn\u2019t leave the room until late morning.\nIt was natural that the rumours would spread.\n\u201cI have something to say about your recent injury,\u201d Nisha spoke, his gaze turning to the magicians.\nThe wrath of his lord would be directed at them. Despite receiving a perfect order to serve her without any discomfort, they had committed such a mistake.\n\u201cHis Majesty wanted to speak to you in person about it, but the council meeting is imminent,\u201d Nisha explained.\nNisha bowed his head in embarrassment.\nBy this time, his lord would be tirelessly listening to stories about Lorna in the second council meeting of the day.\nFor a few hours, the nobles who had gathered in the palace had gathered all the rumours swirling around and were tearing her apart.\n\u201cFoolish idiots.\u201d\nAfter completing his thoughts, Nisha opened his mouth.\n\u201cThe procedure of the Tower\u2019s examination itself should not be difficult for you. Since you are the master of the divine beasts, using flight magic should be easy for you. The problem lies in the period before the Tower\u2019s examination takes place.\u201d\nNisha once again directed his gaze towards the magicians.\n\u201cThe Tower\u2019s examination is nothing less than a national event of the Western Empire. So far, only two people from the Pure White Ibers have received the protection of the master of the divine beasts. On that day, not only the commoners of the palace but also the people from the temples across the nation will gather.\u201d\nPeople from the temples\u2026 Lorna paused.\n\u201cOf course, they would never dare to be impolite to the master of the divine beasts.\u201d\nNisha slightly raised his head and spoke with a concerned voice.\n\u201cThe problem is that there will also be those who have their sights set on the master of the divine beasts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The issue lies in the fact that there are those who are targeting the owner of the deity.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026So you\u2019re referring to the people in Miltan street.\u201d\nNisha\u2019s eyes widened slightly before nodding his head. He was one of the few people who knew about Lorna.\nHaving investigated her while accompanying Nabel to rescue her, he had some knowledge about her.\nHe knew, for instance, that she spent most of her time in the mansion.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nYet, it seemed that the news from outside the mansion didn\u2019t darken her mood.\nNisha opened his mouth with a slight hint of relief on his face.\n\u201cMost likely, the deity can prevent the majority of such incidents. However, accidents that occur without malicious intent, or assassinations that go unnoticed by the owner of the deity, cannot be stopped.\u201d\nNisha spoke with a hint of awkwardness.\n\u201cFor instance, if an assassin were to enter while the owner is sleeping, it means that the deity cannot prevent it.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened. Nisha lowered his head.\n\u201cHis Highness has also commanded station guards around you, but since you haven\u2019t officially received the title of the deity\u2019s owner, we cannot assign guards beyond what is provided to esteemed guests. So, you must remain cautious at all times.\u201d\nHe repeatedly emphasized, urging Lorna to be careful.\n\u201cEspecially, if there is someone who comes to meet you under the pretext of another excuse, such as \u2018Duke Lound,\u2019 you may refuse the visit. The maids will find a suitable excuse to decline.\u201d\nIs that understood?\nHis gaze turned towards the head maid Diya.\nBeing a loyal servant of Nabel, Diya nodded briefly.\nNo one beneath Nabel was unaware that Duke Lound was a rebel faction.\n\u201cPlease, I beg of you.\u201d\nNisha scrutinized Lorna once again.\nShe was just a young lady.\nHer rosy hair was a colour no different from a symbol of the eastern continent, but it only made her stand out slightly. She seemed powerless.\n\u2018The owner of the deity\u2026\u2019\nIndeed, Iber had a need for formidable power.\nHowever, the power he was concerned about was slightly different.\nNisha remembered the day Lorna first arrived.\nNabel, who always maintained a cool demeanour in the palace, gave her a gentle smile that melted like the spring sunlight on her, unlike anyone else.\nThat deceitful appearance.\nHe had been in Nabel\u2019s service for almost ten years.\nWhen they first met, Nabel was a wounded child, and he had grown into a ruthless tyrant who knew nothing of bloodshed or tears.\nIt was an unavoidable choice in order to survive.\nBut as expected of the bloodline of Iber, the royal family that no one trusted and everyone was cautious of, Nabel always maintained his guard.\nHaving spent so much time together, Nisha couldn\u2019t help but worry, knowing the words of the emperors of Iber.\nAnd so, secretly, he saw hope in Lorna.\nShe is like the spring sunlight.\nHe hoped that Lorna, like the warmth of the spring sunlight, could melt even a bit of the icy heart of his lord.\n\u00a0\n***\nNabellonged to always be by Lorna\u2019s side. It was only natural.\nAfter all, they had spent ten years together.\nHowever, the palace was vast, and as the yet uncrowned mistress, there were many places in the palace where she couldn\u2019t enter.\nIf he desired to become a tyrant, he could have silenced her effortlessly.\nHe could have entered his office, where secrets from various nations were gathered, with ease.\nIf others dared to oppose him, he could simply slit their throats.\n\u201cGrant me the title of Empress.\u201d\nBut Lorna\u2019s single request became a leash that silently subdued Navel.\nInstead, he contented himself by occasionally catching a glimpse of her figure beyond the terrace.\nIn the sun-drenched, pristine white terrace, her presence was akin to a garden in full bloom. I can sense your fragrance from here.\nOf course, if he felt he couldn\u2019t bear it any longer, he would secretly visit her at night.\n\u201cNavel!\u201d\nWhen Nabelappeared at the third-floor window while Lorna was residing on the fifth floor, she was startled.\nShe had to delicately open the window, fearing he might accidentally fall.\n\u201cWhat if you get hurt trying to enter through the window?\u201d\n\u201cI practiced a lot when I was young, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d\nNavel\u2019s warm smile made him seem somewhat mischievous.\nThus, the two of them spent long hours together every night.\nOf course, Nabelnever took advantage of her when she was unwell. Though she had experienced sweet ecstasy multiple times, he never claimed her as his own.\nOnce he entered her, he felt he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.\nHe feared he would ravage her relentlessly, to the point where she wouldn\u2019t be able to walk the next day.\nIn order for anyone in this town to recognize that she belonged to Nabel Iber, she made sure of it.\nStill, rumours began to spread gradually that he visited her room every night.\n\u201cA tyrant is weak against women\u2026\u201d\nThe servant who carelessly let out those words on behalf of Lord Roud disappeared without a trace.\nSince then, Nabel would secretly visit her room through the window and return to his own before sunrise.\nMy reputation was fine.\nBut I couldn\u2019t tolerate the dirty rumours swirling around Lorna.\n\u201cThey say Belle can\u2019t protect me when I\u2019m asleep.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what Nasha told you?\u201d\nThe only time the two of them could be together without caring about the gaze of others was during dinner time.\nA light dinner at the restaurant after Nabel\u2019s work was done.\nHe willingly vacated the first-floor restaurant for Lorna, which was originally reserved for the royal family.\nAlthough it used to be a place where even esteemed guests could dine together, it had essentially become a restaurant exclusively for Nabel and Lorna since the strict security measures were put in place by his command.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. There are still people in the palace who used to serve the gods.\u201d\nThose who listened to Archmage Pell\u2019s teachings.\nThey knew well how to serve the gods.\nIn front of them, there was tender Tovian meat.\nTovians were common animals throughout the empire, but the taste varied greatly depending on how they were prepared.\nFor example, it was one of the meats that Lorna could eat, as it was one of the few she could digest.\nNabel looked at the finely sliced Tovian meat on Lorna\u2019s plate and then shifted his gaze to the side.\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\nLorna tilted her head slightly at his gaze and picked up her fork.\nWith a gentle lifting motion, she naturally brought the food to her mouth.\nThe Tovian meat, topped with a smooth brown sauce, stimulated the appetite just by looking at it.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nAt that moment, her fork stopped.\nNabel\u2019s hand had suddenly appeared on top of her hand.\nSitting across from her, he had somehow returned behind her without her noticing.\nHis shadow gently brushed against the corner of Lorna\u2019s eye.\n\u201cJust a moment.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\nNabel chuckled softly, leaning forward slightly.\nIn response, Lorna was taken aback as Nabel swiftly took the meat she had speared with her fork and put it in his own mouth.\nLorna\u2019s face turned to Nabel\u2019s face, and she let out a small burst of laughter.\n\u201cNabel,\u201d she said.\nNabel tilted his head slightly and moved her hand lightly.\nLorna\u2019s fork, which he was holding, followed his hand and speared another piece of Tobia steak.\nHe then brushed a transparent-coloured sauce next to it and took another bite.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\nThen, he switched forks with Lorna, which she hadn\u2019t used.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Every person in the kitchen shared the same expression.\n***\n\u201cYour Majesty, these are the findings from the previous investigation order.\u201d\nNabel received a stack of reports in his office. It had only been a short while since Lone Castle had become a safe haven filled with his influence.\nUpon confirming the safe zone, he issued two commands.\nFirst, bring Rida Viscountess here, and this.\n[Rida Viscountess.]\nRida Viscountess was not a meticulous person.\nIf she were meticulous and clever, she wouldn\u2019t have been swayed by his wife.\nNabel handed her the paper.\n[Current Rida Viscountess: Originally named Sonnet, an orphan from the Temple.]\nAs Nabel glanced through the documents, his eyes narrowed.\n[The circumstances of how the previous Rida Viscountess, who is the birth mother of Lone, passed away are unclear. There is a need for further investigation with more resources. However, it seems likely that she is connected to the current Rida Viscountess.]\nHis gaze dropped downward.\n[The current Rida Viscountess approached the Viscount before the previous Rida Viscountess\u2019s death. It has been confirmed that she learned chess first, knowing that the Viscount\u2019s hobby was chess. There are no other connections apart from the Temple.]\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n[It seems clear that she was sent to the Temple for some purpose.]\nNabel narrowed his eyes.\nHe recalled the image of the previous Rida Viscountess he had seen as a child.\nWhen she saw only Lone, she would transform into an aggressive figure, distant from being a priestess of the Temple.\nAs if fueling the public opinion within the mansion, she would shout and berate Lone upon seeing her.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s lips twisted.\nIn truth, it was nothing short of Lady Rida Vanderbilt isolating Lorna in the mansion.\nLady Rida seemed to have tried concealing the rumours about Lorna. There were traces of her attempts to hide the rumours and marry Lorna off to another family for her own gain. In fact, it was confirmed that when Lorna was only eight years old, there were signs of matchmaking between Southern families.\nThe more I recognized them, the more I saw them as beings of value lower than human.\nHowever, it appears that the recent outbursts from Lady Rida Vanderbilt towards Lorna caused rumours to spread beyond the mansion.\nIt must have been a thoroughly calculated affair. First, isolating her in the mansion and making sure no one pursued the cursed one. Then, when the opportune moment arose, kidnapping her on the pretext of heresy and diverting her to a third location, not the temple.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s expression turned chillingly cold.\n[Furthermore, we have found a connection between the mainland temple and the Mil Tan family, as you had instructed us to investigate. It seems to be related to the recent heresy incident at the mainland temple.]\nIn short, it means that the heretics and the Mil Tan family have joined forces. The subsequent information did not improve his expression.\n[And recently, Lady Rida Vanderbilt has released knights to search for Lorna. Although they had promised to keep her in the temple, since she escaped, it seems that she is being held accountable.]\n[\u2026\u2026There are rumors circulating that Lady Rida Vanderbilt\u2019s daughter, Yeongae, ran away with a slave.]\nNabel lifted the corner of his mouth and smiled.\nHe had expected them to act disgracefully.\nHowever, Lady Rida Vanderbilt was even more disgraceful than he had imagined.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nShould I inform Lady about this fact?\nThis was her matter.\n\u2018Do I want to be your decoration?\u2019\nThat was out of the question.\nIt was absurd for her to expect him, who should be her subordinate, not to inform her about her own affairs.\nBut now was not the time.\nShe was still not fully recovered.\nShe had already erased the family from her heart.\nNabel vividly remembered her desire to erase the name of Lady Rida.\nThey would soon see the power of the divine beings they had disregarded and treated so disdainfully. It would be thanks to the cursed maiden, Lorna de Rida.\nNo, thanks to Lorna von Iber.\nNabel chuckled silently.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

In the meantime, Lorna\u2019s health had also greatly improved.\n\u201cBelle\u2026?\u201d\nHas Belle always been this tall?\nLorna beheld Belle, who had grown so much that she would soon be able to ride him.\n\u201cYou are sufficiently healthy.\u201d\nWitnessing this phenomenon, the wizards rejoiced greatly.\nCareful not to startle Lorna, they continued to be vigilant, barely safeguarding their necks from Nabel\u2019s icy gaze.\nBefore the Tower\u2019s examination, it was only natural for the tower wizards to inquire about the owner of the Divine Beast.\nAnd upon receiving the information that had arrived just yesterday, they fell to their knees.\nThe information from the Eastern Continent, her past.\nHad they known about the hardships she had endured under the influence of magic, they would never have recklessly wielded magic in her presence.\nThe wizards\u2019 gaze shifted slightly towards Lorna.\nTowards the owner of the Divine Beast who had endured an unfortunate childhood.\n\u201c\u2026Once the owner of the Divine Beast regains her strength, the Divine Beast herself will grow in proportion to the power she possesses.\u201d\nThe wizards nodded their heads as they beheld Belle, a nine-foot-tall fox, almost as tall as an adult man.\nAfter they left, the court physician, Domelo, conducted a health examination.\nThanks to the exceptional care of the maids and dietary adjustments, her health had noticeably improved.\n\u201cNow, you should be cautious of foods with strong flavors in the Western Continent as well. Unlike the Eastern Continent, there are certain dishes that are excessively potent. Consuming them could lead to digestive system failure.\u201d\nPhysician Domelo delivered these alarming words with a calm expression. Lorna nodded her head, a hint of embarrassment on her face.\n\u201cI will be careful.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I will ensure that the head chef is duly informed as well.\u201d\nUpon hearing the physician\u2019s statement, the palace kitchen chef\u2019s expression contorted as if he were about to faint.\n\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d\nKnowing that his predecessor had ceased to breathe, he couldn\u2019t help but feel tense.\nThus, the Tower\u2019s examination drew near, proceeding smoothly.\n***\n\u201cMost things in the empire seem to be grand,\u201d remarked Lorna, extending her hand to pluck a single leaf.\nIt was a large leaf, stretched towards the sky as if trying to grasp the warm, cascading sunlight in its embrace.\nLorna tapped the leaf several times, marveling at its size, and glanced around. She found herself in the gardens of the Rose Palace.\nFrom the garden, she had a clear view of the Sorcerer\u2019s Tower, where she was soon to ascend.\nThe ninth stair, hidden in mist, revealed itself faintly, almost as if it wanted to signal the location of the trial.\n\u201cThere are indeed many things driven by such ambition,\u201d said Nabel, seated beside her.\nTaking a brief break from his duties, he had come to Lorna dressed in a black robe.\n\u201cBut, won\u2019t just wearing the robe give it away?\u201d Lorna turned to him, her gaze meeting the hood of the black robe. His hair took on a dark hue.\nJust like when they were young.\n\u201cThis hair colour, it\u2019s magic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Her words were tinged with memories. Nabel smiled.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Emperor of Iver had golden hair, so by having this appearance, I won\u2019t be recognized easily.\u201d\nReally? Lorna scrutinized him with a hint of doubt. While the black robe bore no insignia, she wondered if the knights who escorted him would simply leave him alone.\nAs if in answer to her thoughts, Knight Nisha came running from a corner of the garden. Until recently, Nisha had pretended not to see Nabel.\n\u201cYour Highness!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nLorna narrowed her eyes and turned to Nabel. He wore a disappointed expression.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been caught.\u201d\nWithout bothering to disguise himself, he sent a cold gaze towards Nisha.\n\u201cIs it urgent?\u201d\nAs the hood of the robe was lifted, revealing the golden locks that symbolized the Iber Royal Family, Nisha hurriedly bowed before him.\n\u201cIt is indeed urgent. It has been announced that the continental temples will also participate in the trial of the tower.\u201d\nNabel narrowed his eyes momentarily, a fleeting expression of coldness crossing his face.\nThe trial of the tower determined the owner of the divine beings. Most of the continent was unaware of these divine beings, and thus, the continent did not properly worship them. Even if they worshipped the same deity, their methods were different.\nYet, they wish to observe the trial of the tower?\n\u201cHow many have been requested to participate?\u201d\n\u201cIt includes the temples from across the continent. And\u2026\u201d\nNisha glanced at Lorna, gauging her reaction.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nMeeting Nisha\u2019s gaze, Lorna tilted her head slightly.\nNisha spoke quietly, as if resigned to the circumstances.\n\u201c\u2014The current Lady Bankshire will also attend. She will represent the temples of the southern continent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

She is the representative of the Southern Continent Shrine.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\nIn that moment, a rush of memories flooded her mind, memories she had kept hidden deep within the landscapes of the western continent, as if trying to forget.\n[Cursed]\nThe image of the Countess, shouting with a sinister face every time she laid eyes on her, and the relentless spells she cast upon her without hesitation.\nWhat if, by some chance, the magic managed to pierce through this time? What would happen then?\nShe still remembered the faces of the innocent maids who perished beside her, struck by lightning spells and engulfed in flames, without any fault of their own.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe slightly parted her lips, as if turning away, as if she knew. The Countess had declared that she would come all the way to the western continent.\nShe knew she was from the Shrine, but she had never expected to see her before arriving at the mainland.\n\u201cMy lady.\u201d\nNabel shielded her eyes.\nAs if urging her to set aside any other thoughts.\nEmbracing her from behind, Nabel whispered in a hushed voice.\n\u201cDo not worry. She cannot dare harm the owner of the deity.\u201d\nHe tightly held Lorna\u2019s cold hand.\n\u201cThis is the western continent. And see who is by your side.\u201d\nThe most powerful authority in the western continent stood beside her.\n\u201cI will do whatever you ask, my lady.\u201d\nHe slipped a ring onto her finger and held it firmly.\n\u201cEven if you turn me into a tyrant who incites unnecessary wars with the mainland. So, you see.\u201d\nNabel placed the ring-clad hand against her thumping chest and spoke.\n\u201cDo not fear those weaklings who would die at your command.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s head moved ever so slightly, as if nodding.\nIt seemed as if the overwhelming flood of past memories had frozen her.\nNabel looked at her and kissed her cheek.\nA gentle sound echoed through the quiet garden.\nStartled, Lorna turned to face him.\n\u201cYou have such peculiar customs here, Nisha.\u201d\nAs if someone else was watching!\nWith a flushed face, Lorna spoke, and Nabel smiled mischievously.\n\u201cThis is a courtesy of the western continent. It is a greeting to wish someone well.\u201d\nAs Lorna\u2019s tension eased, he kissed her cheek once again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Nisha.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Yes, indeed.\u201d\nNisha spoke in a solemn voice.\nHe had never encountered such a greeting, having never ventured beyond the mainland in his life.\nBut if the Emperor called it a greeting, then it was a greeting.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe began to seriously contemplate whether he should return to the Knight\u2019s Guild and kiss his fellow knights on the cheeks as a greeting.\nThe thought of meeting Nabel\u2019s gaze made cold sweat form on his forehead.\n***\nDuring the preparation for the Tower\u2019s test, new events unfolded in Lorna\u2019s nights. She found herself waiting for Nabel, who would appear at her window and tap on the door at any given moment.\nNo promise was necessary. Merely meeting each other\u2019s gaze once was enough.\nNabel always knocked on her window at midnight, and Lorna would stare at the window, wide awake, until then.\nThey didn\u2019t go unseen during the day either. However, spending time alone together proved to be difficult.\n\u201cYour Highness!\u201d\nWhenever it seemed like the two could spend some time together, they were invariably interrupted by people seeking Nabel.\nAs if he weren\u2019t already busy enough.\nWith the added preparation for the Tower\u2019s test, he couldn\u2019t possibly find any leisure time.\n\u201cLorna, my lady.\u201d\nIn Nabel\u2019s place, Lin and the other maids-in-waiting kept her company.\nFrom the attendants in Lorna\u2019s palace, including Chief Maid Dia, to the maids, they didn\u2019t give Lorna a moment of boredom.\nThey moved as one from the very beginning, as if they had been accompanying Lorna all along. Lin, though originally from a different continent, was valued for her experience in serving people from the same continent as Lorna.\nShe helped Lorna obtain all the things she liked, while avoiding fragrances and foods that were not used on the continent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first time working with someone from a different continent.\u201d\n\u201cI never thought I would be spending time with someone from a different continent in my life.\u201d\nAt first, the maids were unfamiliar with Lin.\nAs for Lorna, it didn\u2019t matter where she came from since she was the owner of the Divine Beast.\nBut Lin was different.\nLady Diyascolded those maids.\n\u201cNo matter where Lin came from, it\u2019s not important. It would be better to prepare for Lady Lorna more comfortably while talking like that.\u201d\nHer words carried a chill.\nIt was a direct order from Nabel to assign Lin as the exclusive maid-in-waiting for Lorna.\nRegardless of Lin\u2019s origin, it was not important as long as there was an imperial command.\nShe was someone cherished by Lady Lorna.\nAnd His Majesty commanded Nabel to take good care of Lady Lorna.\nThose two reasons were enough.\nOne who disobeys might not be able to stay in Lorna\u2019s palace.\nLady Diyawas one of the few people who knew what happened to the head chef, who unknowingly served poisoned food.\n\u201cWhat do you see outside the window?\u201d\nLin knew how to put Lorna at ease.\nLorna, who had been staring out the window with a troubled expression all along, finally smiled.\n\u201cJust people passing by.\u201d\nMore precisely, she was watching the priests. The magicians who served the gods in the temple.\nThey were dressed in elaborate attire, different from ordinary magicians who served gods at home.\nBut all magicians wore a common bracelet.\nThat stood out particularly to Lorna.\n[Ding]\nThe bracelet that Lady Rida, the Countess, used to sway on her wrist came to mind.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nShe held her tongue, knowing that Lady Rida might be among them.\nLorna sealed her lips firmly. It was inevitable that her thoughts became more and more consumed by such things.\nAnd reports about her were always conveyed to Nabel without fail.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of Lorna being subjected to baseless rumours.\n\u201cBy the way, what were you thinking?\u201d\nNabel gestured toward the window.\n\u201cI had no idea you were coming.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nLorna chuckled awkwardly. She didn\u2019t think it would please Nabel to hear what was on her mind.\n\u201cWho were you thinking about?\u201d\nNabel leaned slightly toward her, his shadow cast by the moonlight enveloping Lorna deeply.\nWith a mischievous tone, he tilted his head and asked again.\n\u201cNot me, but someone else?\u201d\nHis narrowed eyes made Lorna burst into laughter.\n\u201cNo, it was you I was thinking about.\u201d\nIn truth, it wasn\u2019t Nabel she had in mind. She couldn\u2019t help but think of Lady Diya, the Countess of Nabel.\nThough she detested the thought, it kept creeping into her mind.\nLady Diya was no less than a tyrant, the wife of the Count of Nabel.\nEven in this imperial territory, she couldn\u2019t help but be concerned.\nJust as Nabel had said, even with the Emperor of the Empire by her side, she couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of her childhood. Lady Diya would attack her multiple times a day when her cruelty reached its peak. Despite knowing that magic was ineffective against her, Lorna was startled every time, as if her heart were about to leap out of her chest.\nIn the rare occurrence that, by some twist of fate, magic befalls us, I never knew what would become of it.\n\u201cOh, dear!\u201d\nLorna witnessed the demise of the maid who stood right beside her, struck by a bolt of lightning magic.\nThe haunting scream still lingered in her mind.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nUnbeknownst to herself, Lorna clenched her fist tightly.\nIt was terrifying.\nThe fear from that moment resurfaced once again.\nKnowing that she couldn\u2019t use magic in the heart of the Empire.\n\u201cWhile I was lost in thought.\u201d\nAt that moment, Nabel unexpectedly entered her field of vision. Stealthily approaching her, he brought his face closer and gently traced Lorna\u2019s lips with his fingertips.\n\u201cIn such a sorrowful countenance, I see.\u201d\nTensely, Nabel observed her trembling hand and reached out to cup her face.\n\u201cPerhaps I am causing you distress?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\nEventually, Lorna nodded, lowering her head.\nNabel enveloped her face with both hands.\n\u201cBecause of Lady Nabel, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nEven without confirming her thoughts, he could discern it to that extent. His piercing words reached Lorna.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s just\u2026 I find it difficult to face her again.\u201d\nOut of fear.\nHer words were barely a whisper. However, they reached Nabel\u2019s ears loud and clear.\nNabel brushed her cheek once.\n\u201cShall I kill her?\u201d\nDue to his usual calm tone, she couldn\u2019t comprehend his intentions.\n\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d\nAfter a moment of silence, Lorna widened her eyes and looked up at him.\n\u201cI hope Lady Nabel will no longer cause you discomfort.\u201d\nWith a furrowed brow.\nNabel\u2019s hand gently brushed across her forehead, wiping away the tears at the corner of her eye. Gradually, his hand descended down her face.\nFeeling her pulse, the thumping of her heart, he whispered.\n\u201cLook, your heart is racing.\u201d\nOut of fear and tension, that must be the cause.\nNabel said with a tinge of sympathy.\n\u201cI wish it were not because of me.\u201d\nNot because other things make you uncomfortable, but because I make your heart flutter.\nNabel bowed his head to her.\nHis face, illuminated by the light from the window, was tinted with the shadows of backlight.\n\u201cYou know, my lady.\u201d\nTheir foreheads touched.\n\u201cI will do anything you ask of me. So, please.\u201d\nTilting his head slightly, he nibbled on Lorna\u2019s lower lip. The meeting of their soft lips produced a moist sound.\n\u201c\u2014Try asking me to kill. Request that I erase her from this world, tell me you dislike Lady Nabel, and see what happens.\u201d\nHe tempted her in a low voice.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "41": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-41/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease ask him to eliminate her. Erase her from this world. Tell him that Lady Rida, the Countess, displeases you.\u201d\nHe tempted in a low voice.\n\u201cThen, I shall do as you ask.\u201d\nLorna knew it was not an empty promise.\nNabel\u2019s voice was light, but never devoid of weight.\nIf she uttered a single word, Lady Rida, the Countess, would somehow be discovered as a lifeless body.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nHowever, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say it.\nEven in the Imperial Empire, there was a temple dedicated to the divine deities.\nAnd there was no benefit in harming the sorceress who served the gods as she pleased.\nLady Rida, as Lorna remembered, regularly made donations to the temple.\nThe money she gave to the temple was surprisingly substantial, far beyond what one would expect from a mere countess.\nThere was no way they would neglect such a person in the temple.\nMoreover, Lorna remembered the day when Nabel\u2019s knights had mercilessly slain the inquisitors.\nEven if Nabel had hidden her eyes and ears from that, Lorna could not remain unaware.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026No, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d\nLorna spoke up. Nabel tilted her head slightly.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIt was the same during the inquisitor incident. Back then, you were in disguise, so there was a chance that your connection to the Imperial Empire wouldn\u2019t be revealed. But this time\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI told you not to worry about that.\u201d\nNabel tilted her head slightly. She was pondering whether she should talk to Lorna about the countess.\nBut that hesitation lasted only a brief moment.\n\u201cCountess Rida used to have frequent interactions with the temple, right?\u201d\nAt Nabel\u2019s abrupt question, Lorna nodded briefly.\n\u201cShe made significant donations and often visited the temple.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s peculiar. Even though she was a priestess of the temple, once she became the mistress of the noble family, she was expected to become a magician.\u201d\nThat was an unwritten rule of the continent.\nWhile the Tuna sect encouraged priests to marry, there was an unwritten rule that if a priest married and became part of the noble family, they would no longer remain in the temple.\nIt was to prevent the influence of noble families from spreading too far into the temple.\nHowever, Lady Rida had casually disregarded that. There might not have been open criticism, but it was unusual.\n\u201cIf I tell you that I have investigated Lady Rida, would you be angry?\u201d\nNabel asked. Lorna looked into Nabel\u2019s eyes.\nAs she seemed to widen her eyes slightly, Nabel smirked mischievously.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve already investigated her.\u201d\nHe briefly pressed his lower lip again, then whispered softly.\n\u201cEven if it displeases you, I\u2019ve already caused an accident. What should we do?\u201d\nAt his small question, Lorna finally laughed.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nThe Countess Lydia\u2019s feelings had long been hidden away. From the start, Lin was the only one she held affection for. And now, Lin would likely be peacefully asleep in the maid\u2019s quarters outside this room.\n\u201cFortunately,\u201d murmured Nathaniel, his smile fading slightly.\n\u201cI heard that Lady Rida\u2019s hobby is chess\u2026 So he regularly attends chess gatherings. Not particularly intriguing information, I suppose,\u201d Nathaniel remarked, scrutinizing Lorna\u2019s expression.\n\u201cAnd the current Lady Rida apparently spent her entire life in the temple. She knew nothing about chess until shortly before meeting Lord Rida. Suddenly, she began learning chess and coincidentally started attending the chess gatherings during Lord Rida\u2019s scheduled times,\u201d Nathaniel explained.\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d Lorna faltered, sensing the implication behind his words.\n\u201c\u2026.Are you suggesting that Lady Rida deliberately came to our household?\u201d Lorna questioned, halting abruptly.\nWhat was she after? Lorna\u2019s words hung in the air, interrupted by a pause. The mention of \u201cour household\u201d felt as abrasive as chewing on sand.\n\u201cYes, given the circumstances, it seems likely. That\u2019s why she acted this way as soon as she arrived,\u201d Nathaniel replied, gently wiping away a tear from Lorna\u2019s eye.\n\u201cShe caused you pain.\u201d\nNathaniel fell silent for a moment before continuing, \u201cThe temple Lady Rida belongs to is the Southern Continental Miltan River. Perhaps Lady Rida, or rather, the Countess, had approached you with intentions related to you and your divine status.\u201d\nIt is likely. Nathaniel squinted his eyes.\n\u201cAfter the incident with the heretics\u2019 intrusion into the temple was resolved, they immediately targeted you. In fact, the inquisitors who were supposed to escort you during the funeral were impostors.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lorna\u2019s eyes widened, and Nathaniel extended his open hand.\n\u201cThe investigation is already over. The fact that nobody remained suspicious from the beginning. You know that necromancers who make bodies disappear before funerals are betrayers of the gods, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nSo, they were not inquisitors but heretics, in other words. Lorna\u2019s mouth gaped slightly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why even if they knew my true identity, the Empire and the temple would never become enemies. So, it\u2019s alright to let the matter of the inquisitors rest.\u201d\nNathaniel laughed.\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s Lady Rida. You just need to do as she wishes. We can find evidence to prove she\u2019s a heretic, so we can catch her somehow.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna slightly parted her lips.\nWithin Navel\u2019s words, Lady Rida Beauchamp was truly an insignificant person.\nShe wasn\u2019t the one who tormented her at Beauchamp Manor.\nJust another heretic.\n\u201cSo tell me. Honestly,\u201d Navel whispered, asking again.\n\u201cI want revenge.\u201d\nTo those who failed to recognize your worth.\nUpon his words, Lorna recalled the past moments.\nShe remembered the woman who instilled fear and confined her to the corners of Beauchamp Manor.\n\u201cIf only that didn\u2019t exist, Lady Rida\u2019s childhood would have been a little happier,\u201d Navel whispered in a low voice. Lorna slowly lifted her head.\nIt was a habitual surrender.\nKilling people only brings harm to the empire.\nEven if she secretly harmed Lady Rida\u2026\nIt was the moment she was about to give up her desires again. Navel grabbed her wrist.\n\u201cLady, don\u2019t make me a bad person.\u201d\nIt was a melancholic whisper.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sacrifice something else because of me.\u201d\nIt was a voice that prevented her desires from being let go.\n\u201cCommand me. Tell me to punish her, the one who failed to recognize you and made you unhappy. If that weighs on your true heart, I can do this too. If killing troubles your delicate heart.\u201d\nHe lightly touched Lorna\u2019s chest and spoke.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

A faint, whispered sound echoed through the bedroom before fading away.\nAnd as their breaths intertwined, a moist sound resonated within the room.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nNabel savoured Lorna\u2019s breath, as if he would not let a single piece escape into the world.\nTheir embrace was a fervent collision of lips, so intense that his arms around her loosened. Nabel held onto her slipping wrist.\nIt was not just her hand; it was her wrist that he kissed. It was the hand he had always desired.\nMore than anything, I want to understand your heart.\nAt this very moment, are you accepting me without the slightest discomfort?\nAs my heart is filled with you, are you also filled with me?\nAre you in such anguish that you cannot bear a single day without me by your side?\nYet, he did not dare to hold her hand.\n\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d\nHe did not wish to invade Lorna\u2019s heart without permission.\nInstead, he sought to explore her even more deeply.\nNabel kissed her deeply, causing Lorna\u2019s mind to blur, burying his face in her chest.\n\u201cMy heart is still racing.\u201d\nHe whispered softly. His warm breath brushed against her flushed face beyond the white Schmuse shoes. Nabel once again listened to her heartbeat.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nAnd then, he kissed her lips once more, without her consent. From her pristine fingertips to the back of her hand, there was no place untouched by his cool touch.\nPerhaps it was the sweat turned cold.\nThe palm of her hand was no exception. Starting from her fingertips, Nabel gradually trailed his lips along every knuckle.\nKissing each individual finger, as if there were no imperfect spots. A sweet sound reverberated throughout the room.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nLorna flinched slightly at the ticklish sensation, and Nabel, with a low chuckle, aligned his lips with her round shoulder.\nThe shoulder was also chilly. With a regretful expression, Nabel pulled up the blanket. Now, both of them were under the covers.\nThe blanket was so thick that not even a hint of moonlight could penetrate through. When they peered inside the blanket, darkness was the only presence. Within that small space, only the two of them existed.\nIt was warm.\nIn the warmth and sweetness, a small smile appeared on Lorna\u2019s face.\nSoftly, Nabel kissed her cheek and lowered his head once more.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nThe sensation of his slightly raised teeth touching her caused Lorna to flinch. Nabel gently brushed away her wrist that he was holding.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be startled, my lady.\u201d\nI have no intention of harming you.\nWhispering these words, Nabel untied the lace of her chemise and slid it to the side.\nThe flexible lace of the chemise descended over Lorna\u2019s shoulder and hung below her elbow. Her round shoulder was exposed, and the curvaceous lingerie line was fully revealed.\nIt was the last barrier against Nabel\u2019s intrusion. Nabel briefly licked the exposed shoulder with his tongue.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nThe sound, the scent, the sweetness, all were indescribable. Nabel left a deep mark between her shoulder and chest. Then, he lowered his hand and encased her back.\nWithin the warmth of his embrace, a soft sound of undergarments being undone made Lorna\u2019s face blush once again. It was when she turned her gaze away out of embarrassment.\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d\nNabel whispered softly. It was an irresistible voice\u2014tender and desperate.\nLorna looked at him again.\n\u201cAre you embarrassed?\u201d\nNabel chuckled softly. Lorna\u2019s face grew even redder. Her ears were no exception. Even in the depths of the darkness, Nabel could discern it.\nNabel\u2019s fingertips grazed the tip of her chin as she tried to slightly lower her head.\n\u201cLike this.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s whispered breath dispersed near Lorna\u2019s neck. Perhaps because they were within the thick blanket, it felt as though their warmth was intensifying each other.\n\u201cJust stay like this.\u201d\nNabel kissed beneath her lips.\n\u201cYou are lovely, my lady.\u201d\nWhat makes you so shy? Nabel\u2019s hand, which had been wrapped around her back, traveled upward and reached her waist. Then, he gently squeezed the chest he had yearned for every day.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nNabel stood upright, with his chest protruding confidently. He flashed a smile, and the corners of his mouth curled upward.\n\u201cHere I stand,\u201d he proclaimed.\nNabel\u2019s fingertips delicately grazed her bosom. As they traversed the hardened terrain, a ripple of sensation coursed through Lorna, causing her body to quiver in response.\n\u201cAh,\u201d she gasped.\nNabel pressed himself closer to her within the confines of the blanket. His knee, which had found its place between Lorna\u2019s legs, made contact with her intimate area.\nA surge of heat engulfed them.\nNabel firmly pressed his knee against Lorna\u2019s intimate region.\n\u201cThis spot,\u201d he murmured into her ear, gently lowering her wrist from his grasp onto the plush bed.\n\u201cIs damp,\u201d he whispered.\nUpon hearing his words, Lorna\u2019s visage blushed uncontrollably, as if it were painted with the hues of a vibrant sunset.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Lorna, unable to meet his gaze, turned her eyes to the side.\nNabel gently took hold of her chin, fixing his gaze on me. It was not a forceful touch but rather a gentle gesture, akin to persuasion.\n\u201cDo not be ashamed. Like this,\u201d he whispered, his hand that had been wandering over her chest gradually descending. Slipping beneath the thin fabric, his hand found its way inside her delicate chemistry.\nHis fingertips brushed against a heated place.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nLorna hastily swallowed her breath. Nabel briefly pressed his lips against hers.\n\u201cSo lovely,\u201d he murmured softly, his hand sliding down. His fingers grazed the tender apex, encountering a moistness that differed from the drier surface above.\nHe sensuously trailed his fingers upwards, gathering the slickness of her arousal. As his hand came into contact with her engorged c**toris, his movements became even more effortless.\n\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d\nIt was evident that Lorna experienced a stronger stimulation. Her waist subtly twisted, causing her slender legs to quiver. The intensity that surged from her lower abdomen sent a tingling sensation that pierced through her head.\nOnce again, the trickling and flowing essence coated Nabel\u2019s hand.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve become quite wet,\u201d he remarked, a hint of concern etched upon his face, illuminated by the moonlight. In the next instant, Lorna recognized a mischievousness intermingled within that expression.\n\u201cI cannot bear to leave you in this state, my lady.\u201d\nHe lowered Lorna\u2019s panties. The shared bedsheet rustled beneath them, and a rush of cold air met her from below, causing her to flinch.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nStartled, Lorna grasped Nabel\u2019s strong arm. Her moistness now pressed against the bedsheet, leaving a distinct sensation on the previously dry fabric.\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cYes, please continue to call me that way,\u201d Nabel replied softly, tilting his head above her body. The lips that had recently explored her bosom now glided downward.\nIt was when Lorna trembled at the touch of the cool air between her legs, combined with the softness and wetness beneath, that Nabel, with his knees planted firmly, pressed down firmly.\n\u201cHmm!\u201d\nThe direct contact between the fabric and her core felt peculiar. From her dampened arousal, it was likely that his pants had also been stained with her essence. However, Nabel seemed unconcerned and continued to rhythmically stimulate her with his knee.\nAs her c**toris became increasingly slick and slippery, he applied a steady pressure.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna\u2019s breath escaped in short gasps. Nabel chuckled softly.\n\u201cFor your attire, we shall have the maids attend to it later.\u201d\nThe delicate fabric had been stripped away, allowing your scent to permeate the air so strongly. Nabel narrowed his eyes briefly before opening them again.\nReason still lingered, reminding him that he must continue to kindle the fire within her body. Even though it seemed her lower regions had already melted and dissolved, he desired to ensure Lorna would thoroughly relish this night.\nWith that in mind, Nabel withdrew from atop her and buried his face between her thighs.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\nThe thick blanket that had been draped over his back now found itself over Lorna\u2019s knees. If anyone were to enter, they would assume she had simply placed the blanket over her legs.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case. Within the folds of the blanket, Nabel lowered his head into her abundant valley.\nA moist, reverberating sound resonated throughout the room. Simultaneously, the velvety tip of his tongue parted the folds, coming into contact with her nectarous bud.\nOverwhelmed by the intense stimulation, Lorna arched her back.\n\u201cMmm!\u201d\nAn involuntary moan escaped her lips, unable to suppress the pleasure that seized her senses. Unbeknownst to her, her aroused body instinctively tried to close her legs. Nabel, however, embraced her thighs and chuckled.\n\u201cI never anticipated you would resist my advances.\u201d\nContrary to his words, Lorna was taken aback and attempted to relax her legs. Yet Nabel did not allow her to do so. This time, his tongue grazed the entrance of her womanhood. As he descended further, he savoured the sweet essence that flowed, akin to indulging in delectable honey.\n\u201cAh, ah!\u201d\nThe lewd sound mingled with Lorna\u2019s moans, resonating in the air. Her legs involuntarily clenched once again. Unknowingly, her hand descended, encompassing the rounded mound above her core. It then grazed Nabel\u2019s forehead lightly.\n\u201cContinue to caress me like that.\u201d\nHer breath, whispered softly, brushed against Nabel\u2019s forehead. He kissed his fingertips once more before leaning in, exploring the depths of her inner sanctum.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nIn response to the irregular and pleasurable sensations surging from below, Lorna\u2019s toes curled. Her knees trembled, and her hand, as if attempting to conceal her intimate space, barely shielded her mound.\nUnconsciously, Nabel held onto that hand.\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\nThe hand that perceives truth reads one\u2019s thoughts. Lorna\u2019s pale thoughts transmitted directly, swift and powerful.\nThe first message conveyed to Nabel was pleasure, followed by a sense of bashfulness.\nNabel gently laid his hand on top of hers, which rested on her most intimate area.\nThen, he interlaced his fingers with hers and skillfully explored her depths. As the dense pink bush retreated, her fingertips made contact with her c**toris.\n\u201cMmm!\u201d\nHer hand trembled with heat, making it seem even more unfamiliar and foreign to her own. Yet, the sticky sensation she felt at her fingertips and the rising warmth from her c**toris were undeniably real.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nAs her moans grew louder, Lorna was taken aback. Nabel pressed her finger once again.\n\u201cHmm!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s waist jerked involuntarily. The glistening trail of her arousal cascaded down her buttocks, shimmering under the moonlight.\n\u201cDid you miss me as much when I was gone?\u201d\nHe inquired while firmly pressing down on Lorna\u2019s hand. Tilting his head slightly, he straddled her with his legs on either side of her shoulders.\nThe sheet that draped over their knees slipped down to their feet, revealing everything beneath. Lorna\u2019s arousal glistened, adorning Nabel\u2019s clothes like scattered jewels.\nNabel didn\u2019t let her averted gaze and flushed cheeks go unnoticed. Leaning forward, he pressed his lips against Lorna\u2019s neck, his body inclining towards hers.\nHis descending hand unfastened his clothing. Soon, his fierce desire made contact with the inner flesh of Lorna\u2019s thigh. It was rigid, searing hot, a stark contrast to the softness of tongue or fingers.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\n\u201cMistress.\u201d\nA low, sultry voice reverberated.\nTheir gazes locked. Nabel was silently asking with his eyes, seeking permission to unleash his desires.\nBut he refrained from asking in explicit terms. Instead, he inquired in a hushed voice.\n\u201cMay I hold your hand?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t seek to fulfill the fleeting sensations she had unintentionally revealed earlier. He wanted to know her thoughts.\nIf I release my desires within you\u2026\nCan you accept the grown-up version of me?\n\u201c\u2026 \u201d\nLorna lowered the hand that was holding onto his arm. If her feelings weren\u2019t complex, it would be a lie.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Yet, Nabel himself repeatedly claimed that he was no longer a child.\nIt was the same last time, the time before, and now again. He always restrained himself, exerting a firm control over his trembling fingertips, while thinking of Lorna.\nEven though Lorna had never engaged in any intimate acts between a man and a woman, she understood what it meant for a man\u2019s member to be rigidly erect.\nAnd now, Nabel was asking if he could finally release what he had been holding back all this time.\nIt felt as if she was crossing a threshold. Once she held that hand, Nabel would not stop until he fully unravelled her thoughts.\nI like you too.\nHer thoughts, impossible to conceal, unwanted to be hidden, would be laid bare for him to read.\n\u201c\u2026 \u201d\nOf course, by refusing to hold hands, there would be no change in Nabel. Even without a hand to read the truth of the Eber royal family, Lorna was certain.\nBecause she knew his ardent heart.\nLorna slid her hand, without taking it, and took his hand.\n\u201cI too, like you.\u201d\nIt was a language more direct and truthful than words. Nabel, who read her thoughts through their touching hands, smiled.\n\u201cI desire you.\u201d\nThey were the only ones who could offer each other redemption. That\u2019s why they desired each other.\nNabel pressed his gloved hand onto the bed. Positioned between Lorna\u2019s legs, he teasingly brought what belonged to him just above her entrance.\nThe hot phallus made contact with the entrance. The cool air that briefly touched it tried to cool down the heated area, but it quickly turned hot again. The kindling was instantaneous.\nNabel wanted to keep her from being surprised. That\u2019s why he lightly brushed just above the entrance instead of directly touching it.\n\u201cHaang!\u201d\nHis thick and firm member grazed Lorna\u2019s c**toris as it passed through her moist thighs, creating a wet sound that reverberated through the room. Nabel withdrew slightly and this time, he entered her interior.\n\u201cHngh\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cHa.\u201d\nDespite his efforts to not surprise her, the presence that filled her insides was unavoidable. Nabel halted his advance, only partially entering.\nHer insides were too hot. And tight.\n\u201cTake it slowly.\u201d\nAs if urging him to relax, Nabel repeatedly kissed near her neck, leaving his mark. Even if her tightened lower region and her wrapped legs seemed to devour him, he managed to control his passion.\nHe didn\u2019t want to hurt such a precious person.\n\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\nLorna, whose waist twisted and bore down, exhaled a breathless sigh. As the pressure that squeezed her eased slightly, Nabel moved again.\n\u201cAhn!\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t go all the way in, but it was enough to give her the feeling of being tightly filled. Lorna lifted her head. Intense pleasure surged from the firm tip that grazed against her inner walls. Her lower abdomen tingled and burned.\nNabel tightly held her hand and bowed his head.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lovely, milady.\u201d\nHe whispered and thrust below.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s waist, fully engulfed by him, tensed tightly. Unknowingly, force surged into his legs wrapped around her waist. They were entangled like mating animals.\nNabel turned his waist sideways in that position.\n\u201cHmm!\u201d\nA moist sound could be heard from the tightly joined regions. It was too tight to move further. Nabel made an effort not to explore the constricted area below, which was causing Lorna discomfort and even pain.\nA taste of blood lingered on their bitten lips. He thrust below once again.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nA high-pitched moan escaped her lips. The gripping sensation below nearly drove Nabel to madness.\n\u201cSister.\u201d\nHis movements gained momentum.\n\u201cAh, ah, yes! Ah!\u201d\nThe bed shook violently as their passionate motions pushed Lorna\u2019s body upward.\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\nHer trembling hand grasped his shoulder. With her trembling gesture, Nabel\u2019s mind regained a momentary restraint.\nBehind her flushed face, obscured by dark pink locks of wet hair, a blush showed on her youthful cheek. Nabel pressed his forehead against that spot.\n\u201cAnytime, if I ever make you uncomfortable, you may push me away.\u201d\nI must not let my desires harm you.\nHe had only one leash around his neck. The name Lorna called him by, \u201cNabel Eber.\u201d A name that no one else could utter.\nLorna lifted her head. Her mind went blank with overwhelming pleasure, repeatedly fading to white. She grabbed Nabel\u2019s hand tightly once again.\n\u201cUnless you want me to leave.\u201d\nIf you won\u2019t push me away. Nabel squeezed the bedsheets instead of her hand, distorting them. He thrust below like that.\n\u201cHaah!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s moan escalated with pleasure. A soft whimper also escaped Nabel\u2019s lips.\n\u201cAh, yes!\u201d\nAs his movements intensified, Lorna\u2019s waist lifted. Nabel kissed her belly and whispered softly.\n\u201cPlease hold my hand tightly.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s hand intertwined with Nabel\u2019s without hesitation. He moved his waist more roughly than before. The room echoed with creaking and thumping sounds.\n\u201cAh, haah, hmm\u2026!\u201d\nThe climax came for Lorna first. She held Nabel tightly. The blanket that had been hanging on the edge fell completely, revealing the two figures.\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cSister.\u201d\nNabel whispered softly as he climaxed inside her.\nShe was a lovely person. Her appearance in the daylight, like a sun-kissed rose, and her provocative gestures reaching out from the bed.\nAt that moment, a scent of damp rose petals emanated from her. Nabel delved deeply into her once again.\nIt was a long and sweet temptation.\nThat night, too, Lorna fell asleep late.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

It was the result of several nights of inadequate rest.\n\u201cI heard the owner of the sanctuary has a fever?\u201d\nThe wizards of the Tower, who were preparing for their examinations, were alerted.\nDoctor Domello, the physician of Lorna\u2019s Castle, was no exception.\nWith a unanimous desire, they gathered in Lorna\u2019s room and examined her.\nIt was a grave crisis that could potentially halt the Tower\u2019s examinations.\n\u2015Achoo!\nFortunately, it seemed that Lorna\u2019s vitality had not completely depleted.\nThe magicians and doctors who had rushed to conduct the examination felt relieved upon seeing Belle, the divine beast, sitting beside Lorna, as if protecting her with its large body.\nThey understood that since Belle\u2019s size remained significant, it was merely a mild cold that would pass by lightly.\n\u201cDo you happen to have any daytime obligations?\u201d\nDomello, who was examining her, inquired. Nevertheless, the cause of this cold had to be found.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\nLorna tilted her head slightly. Domello also tilted his head slightly.\n\u201cThen, perhaps you are skipping meals\u2026?\u201d\nHis gaze turned towards the maids. Lynn nodded.\n\u201cLately, she has adapted well to the cuisine of the western continent and has been eating heartily.\u201d\n\u201cThen, do you engage in vigorous exercise, by any chance?\u201d\nDomello raised an eyebrow. Lorna also raised her head.\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nLorna blushed for a moment, considering the request made by Nabel to refrain from leaving Lorna Castle.\nAs a result, her activities were limited to the castle\u2019s gardens.\nThinking that she had no opportunity for exercise, Lorna\u2019s face flushed.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna gently lowered the sleeves that had been pushed up to her arms, worried that the marks inside might be exposed.\n\u201cDo not sleep late at night. You should reduce vigorous exercise.\u201d\nWith such stern words, Domello left the room. Lorna covered her face with both hands.\nPerhaps Domello and the maids noticed her cheeks turning scarlet.\n\u201cI will bring a warmer blanket for you.\u201d\nDiya said without further comment.\nIt meant that she would ensure Lorna could sleep warmer at night.\nHowever, Lorna\u2019s cheeks reddened even more.\nThe people of Lorna Castle must have already known.\n\u201cWhen the Tower examinations are over, His Majesty commanded preparations for a royal marriage.\u201d\nThis order had already circulated and reached Lorna\u2019s ears. As the majority of Lorna Castle\u2019s residents wereNabel\u2019s people, there was no way they wouldn\u2019t be aware of their relationship.\nEven if Nabel secretly visited her room, the maids and guards who managed the entire castle could not be unaware.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAs Lorna fanned herself with a flushed face, Nabel, who was in the study, received a visit from Domello.\n\u201cIt is a blessing to have such a harmonious relationship with the royal family, but please refrain from keeping the lord of the new mansion awake.\u201d\nDomello spoke in a composed tone befitting a dedicated professional. His words were akin to a gentle admonition, for the advice of a doctor is precious.\nNabel, without uttering a word, expedited his paperwork with slightly increased speed.\n***\nNisha spent a period of great busyness preparing for the Tower\u2019s trial. If Nabel dealt with documents and struggles, he was the one who personally leaped into the field.\nFirst, he expelled all the suspicious figures within and around the Lorna Palace.\nTaking advantage of Lorna\u2019s poor condition, he even captured a maid who intended to taint the medicine that Nisha took.\nThe maid, who did not belong to Lorna Palace, quickly fell into Nisha\u2019s hands.\nAnd the maid who spent time with him in the basement had no choice but to confess everything.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nConfirming the veracity of her confession was enough with Nabel\u2019s touch. Comparing the maid\u2019s confession with the memories Nabel had seen, Nisha easily discerned who was behind her.\nHanea Jajak.\nHe was someone who was trying to revive a declining family by seeking the favor of the Marquis.\n\u201cWhile the circumstantial evidence is clear, the direct evidence has already been burned.\u201d\nIn response to Nisha\u2019s report, Nabel provided a brief answer.\n\u201cBehead that maid.\u201d\nAnd place her head in front of that family.\nIt was a simple and definite warning.\nAfter that day, Hanea Jajak hid himself in a remote area.\nAnd so, the day of the Tower\u2019s trial dawned.\nFortunately, Lorna\u2019s health had recovered. The brief cold she had caught disappeared without a trace. Her complexion had also improved significantly compared to when she first arrived in the capital.\n\u201cPreparations are complete.\u201d\nNisha reported to Nabel.\nSeveral times, Nisha guarded and searched the vicinity of the Mage Tower. It was out of concern for the presence of any suspicious devices.\n\u201cThe Mage Tower has been thoroughly cleared as well.\u201d\nThe last thing he had checked was whether there was anyone in the tower before the trial.\nDuring the Tower\u2019s trial, claiming to be the owner of the Divine Artifact, one could not receive any external assistance and had to enter alone.\n\u201cDid you go into the Matap?\u201d\n\u201cI checked as much as I could, but since the Tower\u2019s trial falls under the jurisdiction of Matap, there were limitations.\u201d\nNisha lowered her head with a helpless expression. It was an unavoidable situation.\nNabel lifted his head, contemplating.\nBefore the Tower\u2019s trial began, there was somewhere he had to go.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel gently held her cold hand against his chest.\nLorna did not reject his touch.\nAs their hands made contact, a few strands of Lorna\u2019s thoughts flowed into Nabel\u2019s mind.\nShe was certainly feeling tense.\n\u201cThere are many magicians, and it seems to be bothering you.\u201d\nNabel, who lightly read her mind, smiled.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. Just show them your presence.\u201d\nIndeed, the procedure was simple.\nIt was only the act of leaping down from above that was frightening.\nKyaang!\nThe divine beast Belle gently pressed its face against her face. As if to reassure her.\nIts fluffy tail swayed back and forth several times in front of her eyes before snuggly curling up into her embrace.\n\u201cIf you feel too anxious, shall I help you a little?\u201d\nLorna, who had been silent, turned to Nabel. Lorna couldn\u2019t hide her worried expression.\nAlthough she kept thinking she shouldn\u2019t be concerned, the sound of the bracelet shaking echoed in her mind.\nSwish.\nWhenever the Countess\u2019s bracelet shook, magic would always come flying towards her.\nThe sound of the bracelet lingered in her memory more vividly than the magic crashing against the wall.\n\u201cCome in.\u201d\n\u201cNabel spoke suddenly, awakening Lorna from her reverie. Peeking through the crack, it was Lynn who revealed her face, holding a garment in her hand.\nShe nodded slightly at Lorna, as if showing her support, then curtsied and left the room once again.\nNabel, who had received the clothes from Lynn, unfolded them before her.\nIt was a crimson cape that caught her eye. The vibrant red complemented Lorna\u2019s dark pink hair beautifully. The hem of the cape was adorned with intricate gold embroidery.\nIt seemed ill-suited for the modest attire Lorna was accustomed to wearing indoors.\n\u201cJust a moment, please.\u201d\nWith that, Nabel went to the dressing room and swiftly returned.\nOne could hardly fathom how someone who had only ever received clothes from the market or been on the battlefield could possess such skill in selecting a dress.\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened as she beheld the pristine white dress.\nIt was not a flowing gown with trailing hemlines. It descended only to the knees, allowing for ample mobility.\n\u201cJust like this, no need to be anxious.\u201d\nNabel handed her the dress with a slight gesture. As she accepted it, he trailed his hand behind her back and lightly kissed her cheek.\n\u201cA greeting for your safety, and a wish for your well-being.\u201d\nHis words elicited a ticklish laugh from Lorna.\nShe seemed to relax a bit.\nHowever, soon a faint blush coloured her cheeks as she felt the buttons on her back being undone.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\n\u201cHush, I\u2019ll assist you.\u201d\nIt was a wistful smile.\nAt that moment, she understood why the maids were dismissed.\nNabel unbuttoned her dress, and his hands moved forward, gently adjusting her slightly loosened shoulders.\n\u201cLike this, you\u2019ll wear it, right?\u201d\nNabel chuckled.\nHis hand grazed her waist.\nThe garment he dressed her in was a far cry from the simple attire Lorna usually wore.\nJewelled embellishments dangled delicately from the pristine white fabric.\n\u201cHow do you know so well how to wear a dress?\u201d\nIt was Lorna\u2019s innocent curiosity. Nabel laughed.\n\u201cI may not be accustomed to dresses, but I have some knowledge.\u201d\nA low voice brushed against Lorna\u2019s ear.\n\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cNabel!\u201d\nThe person spoke calmly, as if the words rushing to their face didn\u2019t bother them at all.\nLeaning in, they rested their face on Lorna\u2019s shoulder and embraced her from behind. Their hands, touching Lorna from the front, moved to dress her.\n\u201cStarting from here, it would be best to tidy up.\u201d\nWhispering softly,Nabel lowered their hand. They pulled the dress down again.\nSnap.\nThe sound of light fabric cascading down resonated throughout the room. Lorna, dressed in a chemise, appeared in the mirror. And behind her, with a hint of a pleased smile, stood Nabel, tilting their golden blond hair to the side.\nNabel\u2019s lips met her round shoulder, while the chemise was gently pulled down. And then, the only thing left exposed was her undergarments.\nNabel tidied up the slightly dishevelled lingerie line and held Lorna\u2019s round breasts in their hands.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nLorna flinched, and Nabel let out a soft laugh. Their mischievous fingertips grazed past her nipples.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nHer legs twitched slightly. As if it were a coincidence,Nabel\u2019s hand, once again brushing against her chest, arranged her undergarments. They then lifted the chemise, which had fallen just above her waist, and kissed her back.\n\u201cLook at that.\u201d\nNabel reached out and pointed at the mirror. The white dress they had chosen had a slightly thicker fabric, making it impossible to see through. However, it was different in the chemise.\n\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\nLorna covered her face with both hands. The marks of the night\u2019s lovemaking were vividly visible all over her body. She had never seen her body directly, as the maids would cover her up. So she hadn\u2019t realized it would be to this extent. But now, in the mirror, the blushing marks were clearly evident.\nFrom her neck to her toes, there was no place untouched by love.\n\u201cIt seems, my lady, that this area was slightly neglected.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s gaze fixated on one spot within the mirror. It was Lorna\u2019s left hip. Unlike the slightly more marked right side, this area had fewer traces.\nNabel knelt down, resting on one knee, and lightly tugged at the hem of the chemise.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel paid no mind and nestled into her embrace.\nThin strands of shimmering hair cascaded, revealing his pelvis. As he gently pulled down the spot where a pristine white panty was, a hint of dense pink foliage peeked through, teasingly uncertain.\nWhisper.\nNabel\u2019s lips met the shallow pool within her pelvis. As the proximity intensified, a shudder ran throughLorna\u2019s body.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nNabel left his mark there, yet thirst still lingered. Thus, he ventured deeper into her innermost being.\nThe panties descended to the knees, and Nabel\u2019s lips touched the tender flesh beneath the raised fabric, exposing her abdomen.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s kiss landed upon the vivid pink bush. His descending lips gently embraced the most delicate part of her.\n\u201cMmm!\u201d\nThe stimulation was so intense thatLorna\u2019s knees nearly buckled. Nabel supported her with his bent knee and lower back. Once more, his lips met the pinnacle of her desire.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nAs Nabel tantalized her c**toris with the tip of his tongue,Lorna\u2019s waist curved. Nabel caught her as she almost slumped down, lifting her by straightening his knee.\nHer wet thighs rested in his hands, cupped securely. Warm fluids trickled down his hand, caressed his thighs, and gradually trickled away.\n\u201cWas it too playful?\u201d\nNabel chuckled softly, tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear. Then, he wiped his hand against her wetness and cleansed his hand with a tissue, which he dropped casually onto the floor.\nFinally, Nabel gently placed his forehead against Lorna\u2019s flushed cheek, making makeup unnecessary.\nA warm heat spread throughout his body. Surprisingly, there was no longer any chill or tremor. Every inch of him was infused with a fervent energy. Lorna\u2019s face reddened.\n\u201cWell then, just a moment.\u201d\nHe took a few steps back from her, washed his hands, and returned. His slightly chilled hands tidied her attire.\nHer perky bosom was concealed beneath the garments, and the shimmery dress and chemise were properly worn, hiding all the delightful traces on her body.\nA crimson cape, brought by Lin earlier, draped over it all.\n\u201cFinished.\u201d\nNabel grinned mischievously.\nThe well-fitting shoes must have already been prepared by the maids outside the door.\nNabel stood behind Lorna in front of the mirror.\nThe height difference seemed as though it amounted to no more than an extra face. Lorna discovered herself instinctively snuggling into his embrace.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nThere was a slight chill in her body that warmed, not just due to his touch.\nIt was a sense of security.\n\u201cYou can lean on me like this, it\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d said Nabel, as he embraced her body and gently leaned her towards me.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nRone inhaled and exhaled several times, nestled in the warmth of his embrace. Her head, which had been filled with tension, seemed to relax a little.\nNabel, who tightly held Lorna, whispered to her.\n\u201cJust a moment\u2026\u201d\nHe disappeared for a while, wondering where he had gone. Then he reappeared, holding a cosmetic product he might have brought at an unknown time. Nabel, who held a brush stained with a hint of red, smiled.\n\u201cCan you close your eyes for a moment?\u201d\nHe had become mischievous.\nWhen did he learn these things?\nRone willingly closed her eyes.\nThe touch of the brush against her cheek was gentle and pleasant. The brush tapped her cheek a few times and then withdrew.\n\u201cSince I cannot indulge in longing for you in front of the priests, just a little\u2026\u201d\nThe spot where the brush was withdrawn was met with something soft and warm, touching her cheek again.\nPucker.\nNabel, who was stealing a stolen kiss, smiled awkwardly when Lorna opened her eyes.\n\u201cYou caught me.\u201d\nIn the end, Lorna smiled too. Only a pleasant sense of anticipation remained, like a magical spell.\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget. Remember how precious you are in that place.\u201d\nNabel whispered softly.\nIs there a magician more valuable than the owner of a divine being?\nOf course, she was also a precious person in a different sense.\n\u201cBut still, when you feel nervous, think about the power you will possess soon.\u201d\nNabel, finally, held her tightly.\n\u201cLady Rida, a mere magician of the third step. What can she possibly do?\u201d\nYou are the greatest magician, the owner of a divine being, loved by the gods.\nAnd behind her, the emperor of the empire stood steadfast.\nThus, the trial of the tower began.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nIn the expansive square of the grand palace, a multitude of temple-goers had gathered in front of Lorna.\n\u201cLorna is here to bestow her presence upon us!\u201d\nShe was not yet the ruler of the gods, merely Lorna herself.\nHowever, the sorcerers\u2019 attention was already drawn to the crimson fox walking beside her.\n\u201cThat would be\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, the shadow is not absent.\u201d\nEven under the bright sunlight, there was no shadow cast by the fox named Belle. This signified that Belle was a divine creature created purely through magical prowess.\nThe sorcerers erupted in cheers.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna appeared more vibrant than ever before.\nOn her shoulder, the diminutive Belle hopped up and settled comfortably, her body curled up. Lorna raised her head, lifting her thick, pink tresses that cascaded down listlessly. The small gemstone embellishments on her clothing and the golden decorations on her cape sparkled brilliantly in the sunlight.\nAnd her gaze, directed forward, though slightly trembling, exuded confidence.\nSwoosh.\nAs the cheering sorcerers fell silent, the sound of a bracelet jingling reached Lorna\u2019s ears.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna took a moment to inhale and exhale deeply.\nIn this very moment, what came to her mind was the warmth of Nabel.\nHer gaze became even more resolute.\nAnd in the third row from behind, her eyes met with Lady Rida, the Countess.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The administrator promptly relayed this information to the \u201cCollaborator\u201d of the Western Continent. The mission at hand was to retrieve the owner of the divine beast.\nLady Rida\u2019s gaze drifted towards Lorna, far away. She had no idea how he had managed to make his way to the Western Continent and catch the Emperor\u2019s attention.\n\u201cTo escape like a rat\u2026\u201d\nIf Lady Rida had been a little smarter and more cunning, she would have known that the name of the slave she heard in Lorna\u2019s room when she was young was NaBelle. But she had no interest in the names of slaves or anything of the sort.\nAs a result, it wasn\u2019t until she arrived in the Imperial Empire that she discovered NaBelle\u2019s true identity.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nAt first, she thought she must have seen it wrong.\nThe radiant golden hair and the pristine white gloves\u2014resembling nothing short of the insignia of the impeccable Iver royal family.\nThe young Emperor, basking in the bright sunlight, appeared dazzling. That alone should have sufficed, yet his face kept looking strangely familiar to her.\n\u2026!\nAnd the moment she realized his true identity, Lady Rida forgot all about her dignity and let her mouth gape open.\n\u201cI, I\u2026!\u201d\nWhy was the slave here?\nThose words didn\u2019t even leave her lips. It was because her eyes met with those of the black-haired knight standing beside the Emperor, guarding his side.\nThe knight, seemingly aware of Lady Rida\u2019s intentions, observed her intently.\n\u201cIt is said that the divine beast always prioritizes the commands of its owner,\u201d Lady Rida attempted to calm her racing heart, recalling the words of the temple administrator.\nThe Collaborator from the Western Continent had provided Lady Rida with all the information she needed about the divine beast and its owner. Though she didn\u2019t know the true identity, he was well-informed about the divine beast.\n\u201cIf the owner of the divine beast does not know how to harm humans, the divine beast itself cannot harm them.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the divine beast had never killed anyone at the Count\u2019s Manor. Lady Rida scoffed at the Collaborator\u2019s words. The Collaborator wanted to kidnap the owner of the divine beast.\n\u201cSince he has yet to pass the Tower\u2019s trial, his guard must be weak.\u201d\nLady Rida had arrived with confidence, believing that to be the case. However, things had inexplicably taken a turn for the worse.\nHe said the guard would be weak, yet her surroundings were already cloaked in utmost vigilance. Despite having watched for several days, she hadn\u2019t found an opportunity.\nShe couldn\u2019t use poison, and using an item to nullify magical powers was even more difficult.\nAnd so, the day of the Tower\u2019s trial arrived amidst the confusion.\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\nLady Rida desired to deny reality.\nEmperor Iber and Nabel, who met her gaze, clearly sneered at her.\n\u201cHow could it be?\u201d\nHow is that slave still there?\nDid he know the owner of the new recruit from the beginning and approached him?\nDid Iber already know about the existence of the new recruit?\nThe \u2018accomplice\u2019 said that Iber hadn\u2019t realized the existence of the new recruit yet, right?\nHer mind became perplexed.\n\u201c\u2014Well then, let\u2019s begin the test at the tower.\u201d\nAt that moment, the confident voice of Lorna resounded.\nThe Countess\u2019s gaze inadvertently turned towards her on the podium.\nLorna did not avoid her gaze.\nFor some reason, it felt as if the Countess\u2019s piercing gaze had turned colder.\n***\n[Thud]\nThe door to the tower creaked open.\n\u201cThere will be no one in the tower, not even around it. You just need to go up,\u201d Nabel said.\nLorna pondered Nabel\u2019s words.\n\u201cThe very last floor will be the most terrifying, but\u2026\u201d\nThe tower\u2019s test was to leap from the 9th floor.\nFrom the top of the tower, where the summit was barely visible from the ground.\n\u201c-I\u2019ll be watching from below.\u201d\nNabel declared that he would not leave the front of the tower. That gave Lorna strength.\nInside the tower, which was kept neatly arranged despite the constant flow of people outside, there was one thing that was regrettable: all the lights were completely extinguished.\nBut that changed as soon as she took a step.\n[Pop!]\nLight flooded the 1st floor of the tower as if to welcome the owner of the bracelet.\nLorna was slightly startled but then slowly exhaled.\n\u201c\u2026Do I have to walk up?\u201d\nAfter reminiscing, Lorna soon faced a practical problem.\nLeaping from the 9th floor aside, the tower was simply too tall.\n[Zzziing!]\nAt that moment, Belle suddenly approached her. With its tail wagging, the Belle grew larger and larger.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nSoon, the Belle had grown to a size that could be ridden on her back. Belle even stooped as if to beckon her to get on.\n\u201cThen, I\u2019ll entrust you with getting me to the 9th floor.\u201d\nBelle nodded.\nBelle was always a friend who knew what she wanted.\nSince the day they first met ten years ago.\nLorna smiled warmly.\n[Whoosh!]\n\u201c!\u201d\nAs soon as Belle confirmed that she had mounted, it began to move.\nPerhaps due to Belle\u2019s large size, the speed was fast.\nThis way, they would reach the 9th floor.\nBelle didn\u2019t run, but the ascending speed was more than sufficient.\nAlready, they were on the fourth floor. Lorna looked outside. Due to the tower of the sorcerer being taller than the other buildings, she could clearly see the view below.\nEven the distant forest was visible.\n\u201cIt was said to be a sea-like forest\u2026\u201d\nShe had only seen the sea in pictures. They said it was a place with vast blue waters that stretched endlessly. They said the surface gently swayed and reached all the way to the shore.\nSuch a forest unfolded right beneath her.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nAs if Belle knew that she was admiring the scenery, she slowed her pace. Thanks to that, Lorna could notice something peculiar at the edge of the forest.\nIt was as if someone had cut and pasted paper, making the boundary between the forest and the meadow distinct.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nNaturally, it couldn\u2019t have turned out like this. Even though she had spent most of her time inside the mansion, she could discern to that extent.\nIt was as if someone had divided the meadow.\nLorna tilted her head slightly and looked at Belle again.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nThere would be an opportunity to examine the forest in more detail. Or rather, she didn\u2019t particularly want to examine it all now.\n\u201cI want to learn about the sea-like forest.\u201d\nIt was because of what Nabel had said.\nShe wanted to see the forest where those leaves were undulating like seawater.\nHum!\nBelle moved again. Her steps grew faster.\nIt was when they passed the brightly lit fifth floor.\nThud.\nA sound of machinery moving echoed from somewhere.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nLorna turned her head to the side.\nBelle, who was an invisible being without a shadow, still had a translucent form even though she was carrying Lorna.\nAnd where Belle\u2019s front paw grazed, there was something emitting a strange light.\n\u201cThat is\u2014\u201d\nBefore she could react in any way.\nIn an instant, an ominous light swallowed her up.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

They eagerly anticipated the sight of the tower being illuminated up to the 9th floor.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s gaze shifted toward the newly brightened second floor.\nWhether it was the speed of ascension or the fact that the third floor was soon to be illuminated as well, it was visible.\nOnce the master reaches the 9th floor, that mist-like thing will dissipate.\nBut I doubt his expression will be visible.\nUndoubtedly, he will be terrified.\nThat\u2019s why he intended to remain here until Lorna came down. He knew that even from that pitch-black height, his crimson cloak would be clearly visible.\nIt was shortly after the lights on the fifth floor were turned on.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nNabel heard a strange sound from the direction of the tower.\nA foreboding sensation, borne from long experience on the battlefield, stirred within him.\n\u201cNisha.\u201d\nWithout turning his gaze away from the tower, he called out to her.\nNisha, who had been vigilant of her surroundings, was also staring blankly at the tower.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, Your Majesty.\u201d\n\u201cIn the tower.\u201d\nHe intended to ask if she had heard any sound from the tower.\nHowever, in the next moment, Nabel was rendered speechless.\n[Whooosh!]\nA massive flame erupted from the fifth floor of the tower.\nAlong with fiery sparks that resembled an explosion.\n***\nA resounding boom echoed in the distance, as if something had exploded.\nLorna tightly shut her eyes and shielded her face with her arms. Despite that, the world before her turned blindingly white before returning to its normal state.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nHer scream was drowned out by the sound of the explosion.\nLorna clenched her eyes shut and grabbed hold of Bell\u2019s body. In an instant, their bodies tilted sharply to one side. It was a mere hair\u2019s breadth that saved Bell from the explosion, allowing him to move out of harm\u2019s way.\n\u201cGood heavens.\u201d\nLorna uttered the words absentmindedly, her mouth agape. The staircase where she and Bell had been standing crumbled and collapsed.\nIt was a sight Lorna had witnessed before, in the annex of theRida Mansion, constructed entirely of wood.\n\u201cKa-wang!\u201d\nWhen Lady Rida hurled a fireball, causing a section of the annex corridor to be blown away.\nLorna closed her eyes.\nSizzle!\nThe subsequent blaze ignited. The path of escape had long been blocked.\n\u201cYou only need to ascend up to the 9th floor.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what the sorcerers had said. Lorna looked upward. They had only reached the 5th floor so far.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s unlikely to happen, if you exit midway, you will fail the test.\u201d\nThose who had impersonated the owner of the sacred vessel said that some of them lacked the courage to jump from the 9th floor and ended up returning.\nThat\u2019s why giving up halfway was considered a failure.\n\u201c\u2026I was assured nothing would go wrong.\u201d\nLorna clenched her fist tightly. Something was amiss.\n\u201cI will be watching over you.\u201d\nOf all times, Nabel was nowhere to be seen. If there had been any mention of explosions in the Tower\u2019s test, Nabel would have undoubtedly informed her.\nThe sorcerers were no different. They all said to simply ascend to the 9th floor, pierce through the maelstrom, and jump to safety.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s terrifying, but\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nLorna pondered Nabel\u2019s countenance, her thoughts drifting into the depths of darkness.\nTo leap from such a perilously lofty place was not only fearsome but also terrifying.\nHowever, she knew he would wait for her.\nAnd above all else, Belle would protect her.\nLorna was well aware.\nEver since those days of her youth when she was oblivious to Belle\u2019s existence, he had watched over her.\nIn her childhood, during moments spent gazing outward with Nabel and Lin, when her foot slipped on the railing, it was the same.\nBelle\u2019s gentle gust had embraced her, lifting her up and setting her safely back onto the corridor.\nAnd now, he would do the same.\n\u201cLet us ascend, for now.\u201d\nLorna made up her mind.\n[Creak]\nA foreboding sound emanated from the heart of the tower.\nThe path downward was already blocked. They had to climb upward as swiftly as possible. The fire was spreading from above.\nTime was of the essence.\n***\n\u201cExtinguish the flames!\u201d\nNisha shouted with urgency.\nWhether they were sorcerers from the East or sorcerers from the West, chaos ensued on both continents.\n\u201c\u2026Your Grace,\u201d\nNabel clenched his teeth, feeling a sudden blinding whiteness in his mind.\nSomehow, he had to find a way to rescue His Grace, no matter what.\nUnbeknownst to him, he found himself moving toward the tower.\n\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d\nNisha and the other knights grabbed hold of him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for you to get any closer!\u201d\nThe debris from the building that had already exploded scattered at his feet.\nThe charred fragments were unrecognizable, a mystery of their original form.\nLorna was in the very place where the explosion had occurred.\n\u201cYour Grace!\u201d\nNabel unconsciously kept moving toward the tower.\nHis steps quickened, and he began to sprint forward.\nThe knights struggled to hold him back.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t get any closer!\u201d\nAlthough they held his noble body, they couldn\u2019t deny that they were defying His Grace\u2019s will. Even if his life were to be taken, they had no words to offer.\nBut that was their duty as knights. The tower appeared perilous to anyone\u2019s eyes.\nThe raging fire could be seen filling the windows.\n\u201cHurry up and unleash the magic!\u201d\nNisha shouted. The water-based magic was already prepared as soon as the explosion occurred. The problem lay elsewhere.\n\u201cWe cannot unleash magic from here. The tower is already tilting, and if we\u2019re not careful, the impact of the magic might bring the tower crashing down.\u201d\nThen, what about His Grace on the upper floor?\nNabel clenched his teeth.\nHe had always thought that being the master of a deity was unnecessary.\nIt didn\u2019t matter in what capacity or appearance she stood by his side.\nHe only wished for her to be by his side.\nTo be by his side, bringing him happiness.\nAnd for that, he had relentlessly endured for ten years. Yet\u2026\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nI had to rescue her. If evolving by shooting water from the outside was impossible, there was only one way.\nIt was time for him to give the order.\n\u201cThe 6th floor is lit, Your Highness!\u201d\nNisha screamed in a voice resembling a scream.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nNabel quickly turned to look at the tower.\nNisha\u2019s words were true.\nAn additional floor was illuminated, adding to the already lit tower up to the 5th floor.\n\u201c\u2026Impossible.\u201d\nWould she really go up there and jump off?\nThat\u2019s when it happened.\n\u201cThe 7th floor is also lit!\u201d\nNabel clenched his fist. It meant she was rapidly ascending.\nHe couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the tower.\nThere was no need for you to risk yourself, why?\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

That\u2019s why they must have committed such a daring crime.\nIt was clear they did it because they didn\u2019t know the abilities of the Iberian royal family.\nNabel\u2019s lips twisted. Even if they hid the evidence, he was someone who could identify the culprit.\n[Tak!]\nBefore long, the flames reached the 8th floor.\nThe fire had spread rapidly and reached the 7th floor. It was as if Lorna was being chased by the fire.\nThick smoke billowed, covering the 8th floor in pitch blackness. The light was barely visible.\n\u201c\u2026Lady.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t have to be the owner of a divine beast.\nYou don\u2019t need such a title.\nNabel\u2019s gaze remained fixed on the rooftop of the tower.\nJust come down safely.\nAt that moment, a bright fire burst forth on the 9th floor of the tower.\n***\n\u201cCough.\u201d\nThe smoke irritated my eyes, causing them to sting. Even when I buried my face in the folds of my veil, it made no difference. I could feel my head growing dizzy.\nIn my attire, black soot, carried by the wind, had left its mark.\n[9th Floor]\nLorna\u2019s gaze lifted to the wooden planks above.\nWe had reached the very top floor.\nCreak.\nAs Belle took a few more steps, the ceiling, enchanted to respond to her magical presence, swung open wide.\nAscending the connected staircase, we arrived directly on the rooftop.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNaturally, the higher we ascended, the cooler the air should have become.\nYet what brushed against Lorna\u2019s body was the residual heat of the flames, which pursued us all the way from the floor below.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna tightly gripped Belle\u2019s fur. It was inevitable for her hands to tremble with anxiety.\nShe despised being chased.\nShe let out a short breath, only to have her face enveloped by the acrid smoke.\n[\u201cKwaang!\u201d]\nThe charred remains of Lady Rida\u2019s childhood residence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you!\u201d\nThough Lady Rida had wielded the magic, everything was blamed on Lorna. It seemed like she had escaped from the furious spells of Lady Rida many times in her childhood.\n[\u201cKyak!\u201d]\nIf it hadn\u2019t been only the maids who perished in the wicked magic, Lorna would have kept on running.\nIn the spot where she barely evaded the lightning strike, there was a maid who had recently joined the mansion.\nShe was still a commoner maid who hadn\u2019t heard the proper rumours about her.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nBeing embraced by magic seemed more desirable than being pursued.\nHence, she had given up even running away when she saw the Countess.\nMemories from that time kept boiling up incessantly.\nLike thickening black smoke obscuring her vision, the memories dominated her mind.\n\u201cYaaang!\u201d\nAt that moment, the sound of a bell echoed through the rooftop.\nAnd a clean breeze spread out from Lorna\u2019s center.\nWith a swift motion, heat and pungent smoke disappeared in an instant.\nLorna believed that the wind came down from the sky. The bell, faintly shining, wagged its tail as if reassuring her. Lorna hugged the bell.\n[Thunk]\nAs if having read her mind, the bell stood at the edge of the rooftop. Perhaps it was easier to jump from there, as there were no railings on the rooftop.\nThe lower levels were still ablaze. The rapidly spreading flames seemed to reach the ninth floor soon.\nThe heat was being blocked by the blue barrier created by the bell, but there was no time.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u2014Hooong.\nThe wind blew once again, clearing away the smoke in front of her eyes.\nAnd among the bustling crowd below, people caught Lorna\u2019s attention.\nAmong them, the one at the forefront wore a crimson cloak.\nWith his radiant blonde hair, he gazed intently in Lorna\u2019s direction, as if seeing through her.\nHis expression was not visible from afar. However, knights dressed in black beside him were visibly exerting great effort to keep him at bay.\n\u201c\u2026Navel.\u201d\nHe was keeping his promise. He would watch over her until the end. He would watch over her until she came down.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna looked down below.\nBeyond the flames that were visible up close, the ground was pitch black far beneath. No one could survive jumping from here with their bare bodies.\n[Kkiing]\nThen, the bell bumped its face against Lorna\u2019s cheek.\nShe trusted the bell. And she trusted Navel.\n\u201c\u2026There\u2019s no other way.\u201d\nHer heart trembled even though she knew.\nStanding at the edge of the rooftop, the gusts of wind on the ninth floor swirled her hair wildly. No magician could penetrate this wind on the ninth floor and use flight magic.\nExcept for divine beings.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe trembled.\nIt was evident that someone had her in their sights. Had there been any exploding devices, the nobles or sorcerers would have surely spoken about them.\nEven if she were to jump from here, whether she survived or not, that someone would continue to target her.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be tense,\u201d she reassured herself.\nShe imagined the faint whisper of Nabel\u2019s voice.\nAnd the gentle touch that brushed against her clothes.\nThe ticking time had escalated her apprehension in a different way, but the fear of the exam was sufficiently alleviated.\nIf she descended from this place, she would be able to see Nabel.\nTogether, they would overcome the dangers and defeat all those who set their sights on us, allowing us to be happier than in our younger days.\n\u201cBelle,\u201d Lorna beckoned. Belle lowered herself, offering her a ride.\n\u2026\nAs Lorna looked down below, she recalled a desire she had long forgotten since childhood.\nAfraid that the sweetness that wasn\u2019t granted every day would disappear quickly and she would never have it again, the girl who used to wrap herself in fear was no longer there.\nShe cherished the time she spent with Nabel.\nAnd she didn\u2019t want to part with him again.\nThis was a step toward that. She tightly held onto Belle.\nBelle lifted her foot into the empty air.\nLorna\u2019s gaze shifted sharply downward.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

She possessed an air of power, as if she were the embodiment of Shinsoo.\nThe black smoke that enveloped her suddenly dissipated, revealing her figure.\nThe white dress and crimson cape that Nabel had dressed her in remained unchanged. Nabel released a breath she hadn\u2019t realized she was holding upon seeing her in that state.\nShe was unharmed. For now, she was unharmed.\nAt that moment, Lorna climbed back onto the Shinsoo Belle.\n\u201cIt seems like she\u2019s about to jump!\u201d\nNesha didn\u2019t need to shout it like that; Nabel instinctively rushed forward.\n\u201cYour Highness!\u201d\nAnd Lorna soared through the sky.\nHer presence atop the Belle seemed unreal. The Belle descended as though there were stairs in the empty air, making its way downward.\nThus, Lorna approached in an instant.\n\u201cLady!\u201d\nNabel took a few more steps forward. Lorna\u2019s face came into view, even in Nabel\u2019s eyes. There were traces of dirt on it, but she was unharmed.\nAnd she, too, was looking only at Nabel. As if she could read her master\u2019s thoughts, Belle gently placed Lorna before Nabel.\n[Thunk]\nWalking on thin air was easy.\nBut walking on thin air amidst a storm was challenging. And on the 9th floor, where even seasoned sorcerers who had visited the Sorcerer\u2019s Tower knew of the powerful magical winds, it was exceptionally difficult.\nThe sorcerers\u2019 gazes fixed upon the owner of the untroubled Shinsoo, who had descended there with ease.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nLorna tightly embraced Nabel. Her hands, which had grown cold with tension, clung to Nabel\u2019s collar.\nNabel yearned to hold her tight, to find solace in her arms. Relief filled his mind.\nDesire was concealed within clenched fists.\nAnd so, he gently embraced the startled Lorna.\n\u201cNow, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\nHis heart raced too fast. Nabel reassured the pale-faced Lorna repeatedly.\nThat\u2019s when it happened.\n[Creeeak]\nThe fire in the tower had not yet been extinguished.\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d\n\u201cGoodness gracious!\u201d\nBefore the sorcerers could even celebrate the birth of the Shinsoo\u2019s owner, screams filled the air. Flames had reached the tower\u2019s pillars, even on the 9th floor.\nThe tower leaned, emitting an ominous sound. The direction in which it leaned bore the marks of a significant explosion, as if something had been devoured.\n\u201cThere\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s collapsing toward the palace!\u201d\nStartled sorcerers unleashed their magic, even though their powers hadn\u2019t fully recovered. Of course, such magic alone couldn\u2019t bear the weight of a tower like that.\nBeneath the collapsing tower, numerous white magic circles appeared and shattered. The magic could not withstand the tower\u2019s weight.\n\u201c\u2026Goodness gracious.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s face turned pale as she looked up at the tower. The sight of the building just below her eyes came into view.\nAlthough it was a place she had never visited before, it was well-known that the palace was always bustling with people.\nUnimaginable human casualties were inevitable.\n\u201c\u2026Sir Knight.\u201d\nNabel whispered, embracing her. He spoke in a low voice, turning to look at her.\n\u201cEvacuate all the knights of the Order, regardless of their ranks! Ignore the palace\u2019s defense network!\u201d\nUntil the order was given, the knights had been prepared to stand their ground until the tower collapsed, sacrificing their lives.\nUpon hearing Nabel\u2019s urgent voice, Nisha belatedly turned to look at the building, her face paling.\nThe desire to kiss his cheek seemed to diminish.\n\u201cHehehe!\u201d\nHe immediately seized any words within reach, climbing up alongside her.\nWith great speed, he raced towards the interior.\n***\nWithin the imperial fortress of Seoje, there were two orders of knights stationed in the Knightly Quarter.\nOne was the Zeroth Order, directly serving and advising Emperor NabelIber, while the other was the First Order, responsible for the overall protection of the fortress.\nThese two orders did not usually interact. The knights of the First Order, accustomed to the battlefield\u2019s atmosphere, disdained the Zeroth Order, which was known for its undignified behaviour.\n[Whiirrr]\nHowever, today, both orders stood united, gazing up at the tower.\nUnbelievably, the tower seemed to be leaning toward the Knightly Quarter.\n\u201cIt truly appears to be toppling in our direction!\u201d whispered the white-faced Commander Thead of the First Order.\nThe tilting tower posed a threat to the buildings of the Knightly Quarter and the fortress itself. The Lorna\u2019s Palace might escape unscathed, but the other prominent structures would not.\n\u201cHold your ground! No orders have been issued yet!\u201d Thead declared.\nNearby, the attendants and courtiers of the surrounding palace had already taken cover, but the knights could not move. After all, it was their duty to hold their positions in times of emergency.\n\u201cYes!\u201d The knights of the First Order replied, their faces mirroring Thead\u2019s distress, rooted in place.\nThey would adhere to discipline even in a crisis.\nThat was the principle of the First Order.\nAnd it was precisely what the Zeroth Order detested.\n\u201cAs the tower crumbles, what good is holding our positions?\u201d\n\u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d\nThe knights of the Zeroth Order sought to pull the First Order away.\nNevertheless, the First Order remained steadfast.\n\u201cHis Majesty\u2019s command has not yet\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMake way!\u201d\nAt that moment, Nisha came running from afar, the insignia of the Zeroth Order dangling from his shoulder.\n\u201cHis Majesty has given his command! Make way! Abandon the Knightly Quarter if you don\u2019t want to perish beneath its ruins!\u201d\nFortunately, he had arrived in time. Nisha quickly gestured toward the escape route. Over their heads, several white magical runes flashed and shattered.\nIt was the desperate attempt of the wizards to prevent the tower from collapsing.\n\u201cWe must evacuate the fortress!\u201d\nOnly then did the knights begin to leave their positions. Bit by bit, the tower leaned over their heads.\nAs Nisha observed the tilting tower, he clenched his teeth.\nSomething didn\u2019t feel right.\nEven though the Wizard\u2019s Tower was relatively free to access in the outer fortress, it was undeniably a structure within the imperial palace of Seoje.\nAnd they had installed exploding magic inside that structure?\nIt was nothing short of a declaration of war against the empire, apart from defying the Lord of the Divine Beings.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nJudging by the expressions of the departing knights, it seemed they shared the same thought as Nisha.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

It seems they are holding their ground until further orders are given.\u201d\nIn Nisha\u2019s absence, it was another member of the 0th Knight Division who stood guard. With a pale face, Lorne tightly grasped Nabel\u2019s hand.\nNever had he imagined the flames would rage so fiercely.\nCrackle\u2026\nA more ominous sound echoed loudly. The tower would not withstand it for much longer.\n\u201cDo everything you can to prevent the tower from collapsing!\u201d\nNabel gestured, and the magicians of the palace sprang into action.\nLed by the most powerful palace magician, Lucel, their white magic circles radiated light once again.\n[Rumble!]\nSeveral colossal magic circles bore the weight of the crumbling tower. However, it seemed insufficient.\n[Thud!]\nThe magic circles, unable to withstand the tower\u2019s weight, shattered once more. The one that held out the longest was Lucel\u2019s magic circle. But even his magic circle lasted no more than 30 seconds before crumbling.\n\u201cThere are still knights who haven\u2019t evacuated!\u201d\nUpon receiving the report, Lorne tightly gripped Nabel\u2019s hand once again.\n\u201cThe tower\u2026\u201d\nEven she could see it tilting more and more. Nabel reassured her.\n\u201cThe knights who remained behind are not reckless individuals, so the loss of life should not be significant.\u201d\nThe fact that it wouldn\u2019t be significant implied that there would still be casualties. Lorne sealed her lips firmly.\n\u201cI hope the tower doesn\u2019t collapse. I hope no one gets hurt.\u201d\nThat was the moment she had such thoughts.\nThump.\nBelle stood before her. With its tail that had been swaying gently now raised high, Belle stared directly at the tower.\n[Rumble]\nA strange vibration spread around Belle. Not only the magicians who were preparing spells, but also the knights who were emerging from their defensive positions, all turned their gaze toward Belle.\nBelle was emitting a radiant glow.\n\u201cThe divine creature\u2026!\u201d\nAll eyes were fixed on Bellee.\nDivine beings.\nLiving entities composed entirely of magic power, they were the closest beings to gods.\nThey possessed magic power incomparable to humans.\nRumble!\nA massive magic circle unfolded beneath the tower. Merely looking at it was enough to make one\u2019s eyes ache from its tremendous power.\nCrash!\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nThe sudden loud noise emanating from the top made the wizards sigh. It was their belief that the tower would crumble before the deity could properly wield her magic.\n\u201cSuch a calamity\u2026\u201d\nIn one corner, a tearful wizard could be seen. It was only natural that the research materials he had devoted his life to would be consumed by the flames within the wizard\u2019s tower.\nThe tower was also a symbol of the Western Empire\u2019s wizards. As the tallest structure that could reach the heavens, its collapse left the wizards in disarray.\nThud!\nThe white magic circle created by Belle grew even brighter. And the people bore witness to a miracle.\n\u201cThe fire\u2026\u201d\nThe flames were gradually diminishing. The crackling sound that had once filled the air was now replaced by the sound of the tower\u2019s pillars settling back into place.\nThe tower touched by Belle\u2019s magic was gradually returning to its original state.\nRoar!\nThe debris of the destroyed building exploded outward, floating around the people. As if drawn by a magnet, the fragments flew back to their original positions in the tower.\nAnd the blackened marks and flames that once consumed the tower slowly faded away, leaving no trace behind.\nAs if nothing had ever happened.\nNaturally, the tower remained unaffected by the blaze and remained standing unscathed. It stood there as if there had never been a fire in the first place.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel, who had forgotten to speak, turned to Lorna. Belle\u2019s power was derived from Lorna, the owner of the deity.\nLorna, too, was astonished as she gazed upon the tower. She had merely wished for it to remain standing.\nI hope the tower doesn\u2019t collapse.\nI hope no one is hurt.\nThat was her wish. With Lorna, the owner who had regained her strength, the powerful deity was able to restore even the crumbling tower.\n\u201cTo the owner of the deity\u2026!\u201d\nThe wizards were at a loss for words, taken aback.\nThe wizards of the Eastern Continent\u2019s temple were equally bewildered. Unlike the Western Continent, where the owner of the deity had appeared multiple times, there had never been a single sighting of the deity\u2019s owner on the Eastern Continent.\nNo, it may have been a case of them unknowingly passing by.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d\nMixed emotions filled the faces of the wizards who had come from the Eastern Continent\u2019s temple. It was a blend of joy from witnessing the divine miracle and sorrow from having missed out on it on the Eastern Continent.\nThe current owner of the deity hailed from the Eastern Continent, so to them, missing out on the owner of the miracle was nothing short of a loss.\nOf course, the expressions of those from the Southern Continent\u2019s temple, who had known about the existence of the deity from early on, were far from pleasant.\nEspecially Lady Lida, the Countess, was biting her lip so hard that blood could have been drawn.\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t that powerful, was she?\u201d\nAround that time, Belle, who had been radiating brilliance, gradually returned to her original form. Both the wizards and the knights from Lorna\u2019s domain were looking at her.\nLorna was undoubtedly the owner of the deity, the most powerful sorceress beloved by the deity.\nNo further proof was needed.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nIt was then.\nBelle, who had withdrawn her magic circle, staggered. Her once gigantic body had shrunk and transformed into that of an infant. Just like when she first met Lorna.\nAnd Lorna felt dizzy. It seemed as if the world was tilting to one side for a moment.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nBefore Nabelcould exclaim in surprise, \u201cMy lady!\u201d she heard, Lorna slumped to the ground, unconscious.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Two orders of knights, who were originally tasked with safeguarding the Citadel, accompanied Lorna and Nabel.\n\u201cNo injuries have been found,\u201d stated the court physician.\nEven the imperial mage, Lucel, was summoned due to the need for magical counsel. Eight bracelets trembled in his hands.\n\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve exerted a substantial amount of magical power all at once,\u201d said Lucel.\nAfter an extensive and detailed examination by Lucel and the physician, a conclusion was reached. There was nothing wrong withLorna.\nNabel, who had been watching overLorna\u2019s condition the whole time, finally felt his mind settle.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nHer collapse seemed to unfold before his eyes in slow motion.\nHer face, drained of colour, devoid of strength.\nA sight he never wished to see again.\n\u201cIf she rests well, she will recover,\u201d said the court physician, Hass, concluding the examination. His apprentice, Dommello, could no longer examineLorna.\nOnce it was proven that she was the mistress of the divine creature and Nabel had publicly declared his intention to marry her, her status was no different from being a member of the imperial family.\nNabel closed his eyes and then looked around the tower. The tall tower, visible from anywhere in the Citadel, remained intact.\nTo his surprise, there were also magicians leaning out from the stairs, peering outside.\n\u2015\u2026!\nHe could even hear voices shouting in excitement.\nThe magicians of the tower were all entering the tower. There was no sign of any damage where the miracle had occurred.\nThe lifelong research and symbols of the magicians remained intact, as if nothing had happened.\nThey were bowing repeatedly toward the mistress of the divine creature.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nOf course, they had reason to be grateful.\nNabel\u2019s smooth lips twisted.\n\u201cGather all those who entered the tower from the day preparations for the tower\u2019s trial began.\u201d\nIt was time to put a stop to revelling in miracles.\nEnsuringLorna\u2019s safety was not the only reason. Before she could rise, Nabel intended to swiftly find the culprit and eliminate them.\n\u201cShould we kill them?\u201d\nHis sister, taken aback by his words, still unfamiliar with cruelty, was hesitant.\nBut forLorna\u2019s sake, Nabel was capable of becoming as ruthless as necessary.\n\u201c\u2026.Hurry. Take their lives before my sister awakens.\u201d\nHe gestured.\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\nNesha made a brief bow and left the room.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThis unforeseen turn of events was not meant to be.\nOnce he had proven himself as the rightful owner of Shinsoo, the Imperial Kingdom was destined to face a profound upheaval. For Emperor Nabel Iber, marrying the owner of Shinsu was a momentous occasion, surpassing any other grand events.\nOnce again, the owner of Shinsu would be entrusted to safeguard the House of Iber.\nHowever\u2026\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nBefore the upheaval could even take hold, a storm of bloodshed loomed on the horizon.\nThe face of the sorcerer Lucel turned pale. It was only natural for him and his subordinates, as sorcerers who had visited the Sorcerer\u2019s Tower, to be included in the equation.\nSoon, a merciless atmosphere would engulf the tower.\n***\nThe atmosphere within the Tower of the Magician was surprisingly free, considering the harsh orders that had been issued.\n\u201cSummon all those who entered the Tower of the Magician during the trial period.\u201d\nThat was Navel\u2019s command.\nThanks to it, all the magicians whose magical patterns had been registered within the Tower eagerly flocked to its doors, just as Emperor Navel Iber had decreed. The magicians expected something cruel to unfold, befitting the stern nature of the newly established Imperial regime. Most of them arrived at the Tower with pale faces, anticipating the worst.\nHowever, nothing happened within the Tower.\n\u201cPlease wait here.\u201d\nUndoubtedly, there had been a summons order.\nThe Imperial First and Second Knight Orders, directly under the command of the Emperor, allowed the magicians to enter the Tower but prevented them from leaving.\nNevertheless, they did not treat the magicians recklessly.\n\u201cCould it be that the temple magicians have come?\u201d\nUpon hearing this, the magicians of Matop breathed a sigh of relief.\n\u201cThere was an incident, but wasn\u2019t it for the sacred Tower\u2019s trial? Your Majesty also showed some leniency, so perhaps you\u2019re giving it some time.\u201d\nSome of them held such thoughts.\n\u201cThen why did they summon us so early?\u201d\nOf course, there were valid doubts. However, the members of the Imperial First Knight Order guarding their sides did not provide them with any answers.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nTwo individuals wearing magician robes slipped in through the vigilant gap maintained by the knights on the first floor of Matop. After briefly flipping their hoods, they revealed their faces.\nThe knights who saw their faces bowed their heads in greeting, then naturally made way for them.\nWithin the man\u2019s robe, blackish hair glimmered under the light.\n\u201cHurry.\u201d\nThe man, Navel, spoke briefly. Neshar, who followed him, silently kept pace.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\nNavel made a slight gesture to the Imperial First Knight Order guarding the exterior. It was an order for the others not to follow.\nThe commander of the Imperial First Knight Order, Teyard, offered a brief salute.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I was hit by that fragment!\u201d\n\u201cYou were hit, but why isn\u2019t there any injury?\u201d\n\u201cEven the injury healed?\u201d\nAs Navel passed through the third-floor corridor, he noticed two startled magicians being apprehended.\nNaturally, his lips curved into a smile.\nMost of the magicians seemed to have relaxed by now. The more they relaxed and let their guard down, the better it was for him. His ungloved hand lightly brushed against the hands of the magicians. With so many magicians densely packed in the corridor, there was no one suspicious enough to notice.\n\u201c\u2026Are they really not conducting any investigation?\u201d\nWith each brush of his hand, his thoughts were discernible.\n\u201cOnly twenty years have passed since the tragic loss of Lord Pell, and yet a new miracle has already unfolded!\u201d exclaimed one with an air of excitement, for even the sorcerers were stirred by the appearance of the newfound heir. Nabel had always detested the touch of others, especially those with lesser magical prowess than his own.\n\u201cWhy is that wretch, Ten, ranked higher than me despite his inferior magical abilities?\u201d Nabel pondered aloud.\n\u201cDid not Lord Ten demonstrate exceptional promise from an early age?\u201d replied a sorcerer, his thoughts and words forming a stream from his head and mouth. Nabel sneered, harbouring a distaste for such individuals who easily approached others with their repugnant thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel had witnessed far too many of these despicable beings, with their vile intentions hidden behind jovial smiles as they intruded upon others.\nHowever, today was an exception. Today, he could freely engage with people without concern. Though every repugnant thought made him queasy, he could endure it.\n\u201cAh,\u201d he muttered, recalling the sight of the fallen Lorna.\nIt must be ensured that such a calamity never happens again.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel ascended to the fourth floor.\nHe couldn\u2019t possibly make contact with every sorcerer.\nThe easiest way would be to approach the scene.\nThe Zero Knight Order had already investigated the inner workings of the tower and reported back to him.\n\u201cWe detected magical activity on the fifth floor. Upon inspection, we found an unidentified magic circle, but its form was unclear. However, it doesn\u2019t appear to have been erased by the explosion\u2019s aftermath.\u201d\nNaturally. The miracle caused by the newfound heir was no ordinary occurrence.\nThe tower had reverted to its state before the explosion and fire.\nIn other words, it had returned as the enemy had left it, without removing their machinations.\n\u201cFortunately, this investigation was uneventful.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen magic that rewinds time before.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever it may be, it is a testament to the deeds of the rightful heir\u2026\u201d\nThe sorcerers, too, praised the outcome.\n\u201cI had just finished writing the report on that research yesterday! Imagine it flying away entirely! I would have been thrown off from the ninth floor!\u201d exclaimed a fervent sorcerer, spewing enthusiasm and saliva. Nabel\u2019s indifferent gaze brushed past him.\n\u201cBut what I wrote yesterday remained intact! Clearly, the heir reversed time to the day before the tower\u2019s trial!\u201d\n\u201cHail to the rightful heir!\u201d\nA passing sorcerer exclaimed, praising Ronae.\n\u201cIf only we could reveal their true faces\u2026 They appeared so young\u2026\u201d\nHowever, at the same time, Nabel could read even the vilest thoughts, and with narrowed eyes, he clasped his hands together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s right near the scene,\u201d whispered Nisha, who followed behind him. Nabel nodded briefly, his expression slightly hardened.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThe Tower incident was nothing short of a declaration of war against the Empire.\nOther neighbouring countries that had noticed this were already sending their condolences. Outwardly, it was a celebration of the birth of a new ruler, the Lord of the Tower, while simultaneously offering solace for the accidents that occurred during the Tower\u2019s test. Of course, they also mentioned the astonishing abilities of the Lord of the Tower, who had prevented a catastrophe.\n[Whether or not it would bring comfort to your astonished heart\u2026]\nSimilarly, the neighbouring countries, having found the right words, all sent trivial gifts to the Empire. In essence, they were saying that they had no connection to the incident during the Tower\u2019s test.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel had no interest in gifts that would gather dust at his feet.\nAfter all, he knew it wouldn\u2019t amount to much of an incident caused by the small countries surrounding them.\nThey had already been on the defensive during the early days of his reign.\nThose who dared to invade the Empire had to taste its military power. Despite the complexities of internal affairs due to the erosion caused by Miltan, they were not relegated to being overwhelmed by small nations.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s eyes narrowed. Yes, the military power was eroded by Miltan.\nThere was only one force that would make such a declaration of war\u2014Miltan.\nThe rebels who had already instigated a rebellion within the Miltan Empire had all been executed. However, Nabel knew that was not the end.\nOtherwise, why would Duke Laude and Miltan\u2019s puppets have had different thoughts?\nIt meant that there were still some remaining in Miltan who could ascend to the thLorna instead of the bloodline of the Miltan Empire.\nAbove all, Nabel himself knew. The Miltan Empire had been completely eradicated, just like Miltan. Everyone, except him.\nHis escape was thanks to the last loyalists of the royal family. They became the Zero Knights.\nWhere could there be a law that said he couldn\u2019t escape twice?\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\n[Fifth floor.]\nNabel\u2019s gaze turned towards the place where the mages were gathered. This was undoubtedly where the explosion had occurred. The mages were feeling along the walls, fascinated.\n\u201cDo you see the complete magic circle?\u201d Nabel asked.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. I have no idea what this triangle represents\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA triangle? Where on earth would there be a triangle?\u201d\nThe mages were burning with curiosity. It was understandable, as the magic circle drawn on the wall appeared differently to each person\u2019s eyes.\nBut Nabel could see it.\n\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\nNabel uttered a few brief words and then closed his mouth.\nAs someone who was not a magician, he did not know many magical inscriptions. However, there were a few things he knew that were certainly known to those of the royal family.\nFor instance, there was a defensive inscription left behind by the great sorcerer, Fel, the previous owner of the Divine Beast, before he died. This inscription was specifically designed to protect the Iberian Royal Family.\nThe inscription would cause an explosion if an unauthorized individual entered its boundaries.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAnd that inscription was exclusively granted to the Imperial Family of the Western Empire. Nabel could clearly discern the form of the inscription with his own eyes.\nMiltan, who had once been a member of the Imperial Family, would have also seen it.\nIn other words, only members of the Miltan and Iberian families possessed the ability to draw that inscription.\n\u201cSo it has been confirmed.\u201d\nNabel spoke briefly.\nMiltan is undoubtedly alive.\nAnd he had his sights set on Lorna, the owner of the Divine Beast.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "55": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-55/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tower of the Sorcerer held great symbolic significance.\nIf it had collapsed as they intended, various rumours would have spread in an instant.\n\u201cThe owner of the divine beast has abandoned the Holy Empire.\u201d\n\u201cThe relationship between the owner of the divine beast and the House of Iber has soured.\u201d\nSuch rumours were easily created and swiftly propagated. And that was precisely what Miltran desired.\nThey would do whatever it took to prevent Iber from reclaiming ownership of the divine beast.\nOver twenty years ago, the House of Iber, under the protection of the divine beast\u2019s owner, was an impregnable fortress.\nUntil the owner of the divine beast perished.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel knew how the former divine beast\u2019s owner, the Archmage Pell, had met his demise. He vividly remembered the gruesome sight.\n\u201cI humbly greet your presence.\u201d\nRecently, the council convened frequently, yet Nabel called for an emergency meeting. He no longer had time to delay.\nBefore Her Majesty awakened, he wanted to resolve all the hardships.\nThat was his earnest wish.\nHe did not want her to witness any more hardships.\nHad she not already witnessed enough at the Rida Estate?\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nAs the members of the council observed Nabel\u2019s impassive face, their expressions stiffened slightly. They had expected the punishment to befall the mages first, given the abrupt assembly of the council.\n\u201cHer Majesty has commanded me to become her champion.\u201d\nAbruptly, he spoke up, and silence filled the council chamber.\nHe gestured to Nisha. The doors of the chamber swung open roughly, and a man dressed in mage robes was dragged in.\nHis mouth was gagged.\nUnbeknownst to him, he was one of the individuals who had come into contact with him in the Tower of the Sorcerer.\n\u201cWithout them, erasing this would be impossible\u2026\u201d\nThe image of who \u201cthey\u201d were vividly formed in Nabel\u2019s mind.\nA young mage with silver hair, the emblem of the House of Miltran, secretly carving runes into the tower late at night.\nIt was the power of the \u201cHand of Truth,\u201d the ability to read the truth. Even fleeting thoughts were sufficient evidence, leaving a lingering conviction.\n\u201cI must report back as soon as possible.\u201d\nAs the mage thought so and turned around, Nisha seized him immediately. That was how he had been brought here.\nAnd along with the thought of \u201cI must report,\u201d Nabel knew well the face of the person the mage had recalled.\nOne was Duke Roath, and the other was Lady Rida, the Countess of Rida.\nThough the composition of the group was unexpected, if Miltran\u2019s silver-haired individual was entangled with them, there was no reason they wouldn\u2019t gather.\n\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\nAt that moment, a knight from the Zero Order approached and whispered softly to Nabel.\n\u201cI have searched for the meeting place of the three individuals, but it has already been consumed by fire.\u201d\nNabel smiled. Gesturing, he rose from the spot where he had cornered the knight of the Zero Order.\n\u201cMy lady, you advised me not to become a tyrant.\u201d\nThough it was a statement made earlier, this time it held a different tone.\n\u201cI do not wish to suspect my comrades, as you instructed. However, regrettably\u2026\u201d\nAs Nabel continued his words, his gaze brushed past Lord Road.\n\u201cUnfortunately, some evidence remains atop the tower.\u201d\n\u201cEvidence, you say\u2026?\u201d\nIt was the First Order Commander, Thead, who asked. Nabel chuckled.\n\u201cIt is within the mage\u2019s tower. If you\u2019re curious, you may ask the mages. Anyone who has entered the tower has witnessed it at least once.\u201d\nNabel tilted his head slightly.\n\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t know what the magical inscription looks like. Only those with the eyes of the royal family can see it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201d\nThead, the First Order Commander, was about to ask who drew the magical inscription when his face turned pale.\nThere was only one answer.\n\u201c\u2026But Your Majesty, haven\u2019t those wicked souls of the secret society already met their demise on the guillotine?\u201d\nLord Road\u2019s words were audacious. Nabel couldn\u2019t help but laugh silently.\n\u201cI am puzzled by that as well. The problem lies in the fact that there is still Milten blood remaining. Those individuals may find it unpleasant, but they were seated in this very room.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s gaze landed and drifted away from his own seat.\n\u201cBecause they know the protective magical seal of the royal family.\u201d\nResting his sword beside his chair, Nabel raised it high. Looking down at the blade embedded in its sheath, he spoke.\n\u201cI personally slit their throats, so I don\u2019t understand how they are still alive\u2026\u201d\nNabel directed the tip of the sword toward the floor. The sound of the sheath scraping against the ground echoed ominously in the council chamber.\n\u201cIf, by any chance, his remains are here, let it be known. I am grateful for the opportunity to ring his neck twice.\u201d\nSwish.\nThe sound of the sword being drawn caused the contemplative face of the restrained mage to turn pensive.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel stared into the eyes of the one who would soon perish.\nWhen I first had to kill someone, I averted my gaze.\nBut when I stood alone, I became an invulnerable man.\nAnd so, I focused on those eyes.\nIf I kept looking at those eyes and constantly recalled them, I believed they would become familiar and insignificant.\nOf course, that was an absurd notion.\n\u201cMake sure to convey this message. To him in the secret chamber.\u201d\nHaving finished speaking, Nabel thrust the sharp blade of his sword into the sorcerer\u2019s neck.\n\u201cAnd it would be great if you could report this in detail.\u201d\nHe raised the corners of his mouth and smiled, looking straight into the terror-stricken eyes. Each time he glanced, it felt like something was breaking within him.\nWhen he was young, the family members who had their heads severed must have had the same expression.\nOf course, thinking about it now wouldn\u2019t lead to anything good. His sword slowly pierced the sorcerer\u2019s neck.\nIt would have been nice if Lady Rida, the Countess, were present in this place.\nShe is the one being targeted.\nHe didn\u2019t want to keep her alive. He wanted to erase her from this world, even if it meant assassinating her.\nBut it wasn\u2019t the time yet.\nHe had no intention of depriving Rona of her vengeance.\nAfter all, as long as Rona remained the owner of the deity, if she even spoke a little about the Countess, the Countess would be regarded as a heretic by all the sorcerers.\nIt meant being isolated from the world.\nWho would doubt the most beloved child of the gods?\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nThe sorcerer vigorously shook his head. It meant it wasn\u2019t him. He probably thought there was no evidence.\nNabel chuckled.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that there are no sorcerers in the secret chamber. So who supplied the magic power to that magic circle?\u201d\nThe answer was in the sorcerer\u2019s mind, which Nabel discerned. The colour drained from the sorcerer\u2019s face.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not you, then tell me.\u201d\nTell me about the people you conspired with. Nabel smiled.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t feel wronged.\u201d\nThose who spoke from the sorcerer\u2019s mouth would all die.\nNabel\u2019s sword delved a little deeper into the sorcerer\u2019s neck.\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\nBlood spurted out.\nOne of the noble onlookers averted their gaze. Watching a person slowly die while wearing a mask was not a pleasant sight.\n\u201cDo not avert your gaze.\u201d\nHe commanded the aristocrats in the conference room.\nIt was a warning.\nThud! The sound of the wizard falling echoed through the conference room.\nClang! Nabel, the one who killed the wizard, threw his sword to the ground. His white gloves and uniform were already drenched in the wizard\u2019s blood. The ends of his bright blond hair were also heavy with the dark liquid, hanging down.\n\u201cI will track him down with full force. You are free to gather any evidence. I will capture him and, without a doubt, kill him right here.\u201d\nNabel strode across the center of the conference room.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe lifeless gaze of the deceased wizard seemed to be directed at him. Nabel deliberately avoided looking back at it. He forcefully swung open the doors of the conference room.\nBang! The large doors hit the wall and then closed back in place.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nAnd with that bang, Nabel\u2019s voice was drowned out.\nHe stood before the conference room, eyes wide open.\n\u201c\u2026.Nabel?\u201d\nRight in front of the conference room, Lorna stood.\nHer figure was captured in his eyes, her white uniform soaked in blood.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The guest room she had been in was originally adorned with delicate silver and fine navy-blue fabrics. Being the place where the most esteemed guests were received after the royal family, it was resplendent.\nHowever, they did not use the royal colours of gold and crimson here. But still\u2026\nThis place was entirely adorned in red and golden hues.\n\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d\nThe sorcerer Lucel exclaimed, lowering his head in astonishment. Eight bracelets jingled on his wrist.\n\u201cMiss!\u201d\nLin grabbed Lorna\u2019s hand firmly.\n\u201cLin.\u201d\nHer voice seemed a bit subdued. Lin must have noticed her state and promptly poured water into a teapot, handing it to her.\n\u201cDeliver the news to Her Majesty!\u201d\nLin stepped aside, and the court ladies, Diya and the maidens of Lorna\u2019s palace, hurriedly moved.\n\u201cIs there any place where you find it difficult to move?\u201d\nThe busy sorcerer Lucel inquired. Despite the fact that all the other sorcerers had been summoned to the mage tower, the reason he could still be here was that a sorcerer was needed to oversee Lorna.\nOf course, it was also Lorna\u2019s fate to be interrogated once she woke up. There was no exception for Nabel.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nLorna moved her hand to test it. Lucel let out a sigh of relief.\n\u201cThe tower\u2026\u201d\nLorna\u2019s gaze turned toward the tower. The tower was unharmed. And faintly, it seemed she could see the sorcerers peering out of the windows.\n\u201cThe tower is safe, and no one is injured, young lady.\u201d\nLin held her hand.\n\u201cInstead of worrying about others, you should worry about yourself first. Are you sure there is no place that hurts?\u201d\nLin\u2019s concerned gaze was fixed on Lorna. Lorna smiled.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nIt was something that always happened.\nIt felt like she had returned to a time long gone.\nWhen she was in Count Rida\u2019s estate, after being struck by the Countess\u2019s magic, Lin took care of her with utmost dedication.\nJust like now.\n\u201cEveryone is safe, Lady Lorna. However\u2026\u201d\nLucel lowered his head with a troubled voice.\n\u201cPlease, lower your voice when speaking to the master of the divine beings.\u201d\nNow that she was truly acknowledged as the master of the divine beings, there was no sorcerer who could be above her. It was incredibly humbling just to listen to the honorifics.\n\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d\nThere was no choice. Lorna still found the sorcerers difficult to handle. Especially when she saw the bracelets jingling on his wrist, her heart couldn\u2019t help but become entangled in complicated emotions.\nBut now, she has to gradually adapt to this problem.\n\u201cWhat about Nabel?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d\nWhen the most distinguished name in the Empire suddenly emerged, Lucel was taken aback. However, she swiftly regained her composure.\n\u201cThe council meeting will soon be over. The maid servants have gone to deliver the news to Lord Lorna, so he will be arriving shortly.\u201d\nThank goodness. When Lorna collapsed, Lucel distinctly saw the expression on his face distorted by worry and anger. He must have been greatly surprised.\nNevertheless, it seems that he, as the Emperor, is managing the situation smoothly.\nFinally, Lorna mustered a small smile on his face.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\n\u201cI miss you.\u201d\nThat was the moment she thought of him. Suddenly, a fox with pointed ears emerged from her shadow.\nOf course, it was Belle.\n\u201cBelle?\u201d\nShe was taken aback, unable to speak before Belle, who had heard her small wish, gently embraced her with a faint glow.\n\u2015Woong!\nIn that instant, the scenery before Lucel\u2019s eyes distorted greatly. Startled, she tightly closed her eyes.\nBang!\nAnd in that moment, she opened her eyes at the sound that reverberated before her. It was the sound of a massive door closing.\nThe door was a deep brown colour, adorned with ornate golden decorations. It was remarkably large, resembling a door through which esteemed individuals would pass.\nHowever, Lucel could no longer dIbert her gaze towards that door.\n\u201c\u2026Nabel\u2026?\u201d\nHe stood in front of the door. Clad in a white uniform and gloves, drenched in crimson blood.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "57": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-57/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you been hurt?\u201d\nThe thought crossed Lorna\u2019s mind in an instant.\nIt was when Lorna reached out her hand to him in surprise. Nabel\u2019s movements were slightly quicker than hers.\nHe tried to cover Lorna\u2019s eyes with his hand, but upon seeing his blood-soaked glove, he checked his front pocket and pulled out a handkerchief.\nPerhaps because it was inside his pocket, it remained clean, free from bloodstains.\nWith it, Nabel covered the corner of Lorna\u2019s eye.\n\u201c\u2015Do not lay eyes on such a sight.\u201d\n\u201cHave you been hurt?\u201d\nIn response to Lorna\u2019s urgent question, Nabel shook his head.\n\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\nHis voice was low, and Lorna\u2019s heart sank with a different meaning. Belatedly, the strong scent of blood unsettled her nostrils.\n\u201c\u2026Nabel.\u201d\nLorna spoke softly. She pleaded for him not to become a tyrant.\nShe didn\u2019t want him to become a tyrant who harmed others without reason.\nIf there were many people who despised him, who saw him as an enemy, she couldn\u2019t live happily. Just like in the mansion.\nBut on the other hand, she understood.\nNabel was the emperor of the empire, but even the palace was not safe from the lingering influence of the conspirators.\nSo, he must have become cruel.\nYes. He was a tyrant.\nIf necessary, he had to spill blood and instill fear to maintain control over his surroundings.\n\u201c\u2026Lady.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s low voice resonated once again. The quiet corridor held only the two of them.\n\u201cYou dislike harming others, Lady.\u201d\nEven by just looking at the mausoleum, she knew. She had restored the tower, even at the cost of her collapse. Thanks to that, no one was hurt.\n\u201cThe casualties will be minimized.\u201d\nWith those few words, it was so. Such is the aversion to causing harm to others.\n\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201d\nA somber voice simmered. It was Nabel who spoke.\n\u201cIt was a sight I never wanted to reveal to you, Miss.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why I intended to handle it while you were asleep.\nThe dark thoughts behind me remained unspoken.\n\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\nLorna replied softly. The emotion she felt wasn\u2019t disappointment.\nHer heart was torn, and it was due to the pitiful sentiment she held towards Nabel.\n\u201cHave I always been this way?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nTheir gazes were shielded by a white handkerchief. However, they were looking at each other at that moment.\n\u201cFor ten years.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s quiet words reverberated.\n\u201cYou, too, have spent ten years in misery.\u201d\nLorna paused for a moment before speaking.\nI knew, but it was far more distressing and unhappy than I had thought, for you.\nTo seek to dominate others with fear means not trusting them to that extent.\nIn other words, it meant loneliness.\nLike me.\n\u201c\u2026That man was a sorcerer who harmed you.\u201d\nNabel opened his mouth. He still carried the scent of blood. It was the final trace of the one he had killed.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel was reminded of his own appearance. He took a step back from Lorna and handed her a handkerchief.\nHe felt too filthy to be by her side.\n\u201cShall I wash up and come find you?\u201d\nIn response to his words, Lorna nodded silently.\n***\nLin offered calming tea and sweet cookies to Lorna, appearing as if he were surprised. However, Lorna could not forget Nabel\u2019s stern demeanour. It was not merely due to the contrast between his white uniform and the deep crimson colour.\nFor Nabel, it must have been a necessary task.\nLorna understood that.\n\u201cI won\u2019t do anything that harms you,\u201d Nabel said.\nThe young child who spoke those words came to mind.\nEven back then, Nabel was not an obedient child. His eyes gleamed with anger, as if he would seek revenge against the knights and the people of Rida.\nYet, he endured violence. And for ten years, he lived aLorna outside the mansion.\n\u201cNabel,\u201d Lorna whispered his name softly.\nAs far as Lorna knew, everyone from the Iberian royal family had perished.\nNabel was the only one left.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nAnd Lorna came to know Nabel\u2019s secret. The reason why he couldn\u2019t trust people.\nHe claimed that he could read thoughts just by touching them.\nLorna had witnessed numerous despicable individuals. If even their outward appearance was so abhorrent, what would lie within?\nNabel wasn\u2019t a person driven by murder. He didn\u2019t derive pleasure from cruelty. Above all, his expression moments ago wasn\u2019t one of enjoyment.\nIt was a look of utter despair.\nAs the cruelty surrounding him gradually dissipated, Lorna caught a glimpse of Nabel\u2019s vulnerable core.\nKilling someone must have wounded you too.\nYou had to endure ten years aLorna, even if it meant doing so.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n[Thump]\nAt that moment, the door opened. Lin had stayed by Lorna\u2019s side until the end, but upon seeing the two of them seemingly engaged in conversation, Lorna gestured to leave.\nShall I go? Lorna\u2019s gaze seemed to ask, and he smiled apologetically.\nThere was no need for apologies. Lin promptly left the room.\nThump.\nOnce again, only the two of them remained in the room.\nNabel had applied a strong cologne that permeated his body. Yet, the scent of blood still lingered.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nTheir gazes exchanged a profound silence.\nNabel recalled the first time he held a sword to take someone\u2019s life. It was far earlier than what Lorna imagined, and he was confident of that.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "58": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-58/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was when he was still in the residence of Count Rida.\nThere was a servant who disregarded the young slave. Nabel listened to the servant\u2019s words, but he could not tolerate the insults directed at Lorna.\nAnd on the day when the servant intentionally dropped a pot on Lorna\u2019s head, Nabel could no longer contain his anger.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe had witnessed many deaths, even in his childhood.\nHowever, it was difficult to kill someone and face the dying person\u2019s gaze.\nAbove all, it was the futile gaze sent by the deceased that was hard to bear.\nEvery time he saw it, Nabel thought of Lorna.\n\u201cI long to see Lady.\u201d\nCertainly, the Rida Mansion was a thorny place, but being by Lorna\u2019s side was comforting. He wanted to return there again.\nWhen he had to sever lives and think only of himself, Nabel kept thinking of Lorna.\nThe more he thought, the more he longed for Lorna, as the blood stained his sword.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt was the same today as well. Slowly severing a person\u2019s throat, he was thinking about someone he should not dare to think about.\nI miss you too much.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nBut he didn\u2019t really want her to appear. Earlier, when he encountered her in front of that meeting room, he was too surprised.\nNabel still felt as if the scent of blood was emanating from himself.\n\u201cLady.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s face looked a bit weary. Normally, he always removes his white gloves in front of Lorna. But today was different.\nHis thin, white gloves adorned with gold thread caught Lorna\u2019s eyes. They felt like a barrier to her.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nShe saw a cleansed version of Nabel, unlike before. Except for the gloves, he looked the same as usual.\nThump.\nWhen he sat on the bed, Lorna\u2019s body trembled slightly. Nabel did not approach her. He sat a little farther away than usual and gazed at Lorna.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe had been watching her like that for a long time. It seemed to revive something within me that had been dormant, and I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away.\nWhen I saw her, it felt as if the eyes of the sorcerer I had slain in the council chamber and the gazes of those I had killed on the battlefield were fading away, if only for a moment.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to become a tyrant. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\nNabel paused for a moment before speaking.\n\u201cI was angry, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nLorna looked back at him, and Nabel laughed bitterly.\n\u201cI wanted to eliminate those who made you suffer. I wanted to do it more cruelly, to cut their throats and hang them on the ramparts. That way\u2026 they would no longer target you.\u201d\nNabel buried his face in the nape of Lorna\u2019s neck. The sound of his breath whispered into her ear. With his gloved hand held behind him, Nabel closed his eyes.\n\u201cFor you, my lady, I could go even further, lose myself completely.\u201d\nLooking up at her face was terrifying. The longer the silence, the more I feared your countenance contorting.\nPerhaps you were disappointed in me to the extent that you wouldn\u2019t even entertain my words.\nHe buried himself deeper in the nape of Lorna\u2019s neck.\nHer scent was a soothing fragrance to him.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nLorna softly called his name. Nabel slowly raised his gaze to meet her eyes. Lorna opened and closed her eyes slowly.\n\u201cI understand the ten years you spent there.\u201d\nI understand that the path to me was filled with thorns.\nI understand how you managed to escape from there.\n\u201cOn the days I left home to meet you, I thought of you often. Your thoughts consumed me.\u201d\nLorna paused for a moment before continuing.\n\u201cFor the first time, I wanted to leave there. Even though I knew I would be caught and killed, I still thought it would be better than staying still. I wanted to grasp at least a glimmer of possibility.\u201d\nIf you hadn\u2019t come, I probably would have been captured and died while attempting to escape.\nLorna wiped Nabel\u2019s forehead. Her gentle fingertips brushed away his soft fringe.\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up on what you desire,\u201d she said.\nShe slowly swept Nabel\u2019s fringe aside, then gently touched the corner of his eye. The slightly reddened corner seemed infinitely pitiful in her eyes.\nThe reason she had given up on desire as a young girl was that the farther she looked and longed for something, the more empty she felt when she couldn\u2019t obtain it.\nThe Countess had taught her the concept of failure first and foremost.\nAs her desires grew, her ability to possess them diminished, and despair only grew stronger. That\u2019s how she gradually lost what she wanted.\nUntil she met Nabel.\nNabel was the one who once again planted desire within her.\n\u201cI want to be with you. I want to be together in a safe place, not threatened by anyone, like in the mansion, like here.\u201d\nLorna wiped his cheek with her palm as she spoke.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather die than be hated by you. That\u2019s how much I despise death.\u201d\nLorna whispered softly,\n\u201cI told you to become a conqueror.\u201d\nSilence followed, as Nabel nodded subtly. Lorna tilted her head slightly.\n\u201cBeing a conqueror and living, rather than becoming a holy warrior and dying, would be better, Nabel.\u201d\nThe adversaries were even more ruthless and brutal than Lorna had imagined. In the face of those who aimed for their lives, they couldn\u2019t afford to remain idle.\nThat was an obvious truth, one that required no contemplation. Lorna embraced Nabel.\n\u201cI told you not to give up on your desires. Indeed.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s something you desire, Nabel, something you can achieve\u2026\n\u201cRather, become a tyrant and survive.\u201d\nLorna whispered softly,\n\u201cI will assist you.\u201d\nEveryone longed for the master of divine beasts. After all, the Iber royal family had always thrived when protected by the master of divine beasts.\n\u201cI will make you the most powerful emperor who safeguards the divine beasts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Swear to never leave my side again.\u201d\nYou may indulge in greed.\nYou may possess desires and ambitions. You may yearn for something.\nNevertheless, promise me that you will never disappear from my side.\nThat was what Nabel desired more than anything, even more than Lorna.\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\nNabel closed his eyes.\nHis lips briefly brushed against Lorna\u2019s forehead before retreating.\nUnable to extend his blood-stained hand, he leaned forward and planted another kiss on the corner of Lorna\u2019s eye. Tears scattered upon his lips.\nGently, Nabel poured himself out onto the wall against which she leaned.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nHe dared not to touch Lorna.\nDelicately wiping away the tears that streamed down Lorna\u2019s face, he tilted his head against her neck.\nHis fading mark left a profound impression on her once more.\n[Thump]\nLorna\u2019s hand grasped the bed anxiously. Nabel, with a faint smile, inclined his head against her hand.\nMy gloved hand remained trapped within my possession.\nLorna observed the hand that longed to hold mine, over and over again.\nThat was why she reached out her hand toward me.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nNabel flinched in surprise for a moment. However, he could not refuse her.\nOur hands entwined.\nThrough the white gloves, I could feel the warmth of his touch, and Lorna smiled.\n\u201cHold my hand, Nabel.\u201d\nThe only scent surrounding the two of them was that of Nabel. It must have been due to the heavy fragrance he generously sprayed.\n\u201cI smell blood, milady.\u201d\nFrom me.\nNabel smiled, seemingly saddened.\nLorna lowered her head.\nOnly now did she understand why he had heavily scented himself to the point where his nose would twitch.\n\u201cStill, hold my hand.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. Lorna whispered softly.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t take pleasure in the blood.\u201d\nYou looked pained too, in front of that door. In front of the conference room.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel raised his head, slowly removing his gloves. After a brief hesitation, his hand reached out towards Lorna.\nLorna took his hand and placed it on her cheek, then closed her eyes.\nAs their hands touched, her thoughts flowed into Nabel\u2019s mind, as if washing away the clutter in his head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better this way.\u201d\nHow could a person be so clear, so pure?\nIn that moment of contact, Nabel felt as though his mind was being cleansed, free from the vile thoughts and the constant desire to belittle and trample others that consumed the wretched souls around him.\nHe gently kissed the tip of Lorna\u2019s hand, holding it in his own hand. Lorna smiled.\nShe was like a wall between the two of them, embodied by her white gloves.\nThis moment was far better.\nNabel embraced her and slowly guided her onto the bed.\nAmidst the lingering fragrance of his heavy cologne, Lorna could faintly detect his natural scent, a comforting aroma that was barely perceptible.\nShe couldn\u2019t sense the smell of blood he had mentioned, but the fragrance beyond his cologne seemed so distant, as if he could depart in an instant.\nDespite knowing this, she buried her face in Nabel\u2019s arms, hoping for a stronger scent.\n\u201cMy lady.\u201d\nBeloved.\nThe only light he had been waiting for. Nabel leaned towards the brightest figure in his life, gently sitting beside Lorna after a brief kiss.\nOn the bed, he knelt beside her, subtly leaning her body against his. It felt as though he was reclining on a low-sloped sunbed.\nTheir gazes met, as if sealing a promise, and a smile bloomed on both of their lips.\n\u201cThe scent is so overpowering.\u201d\nNabel spoke with a sense of embarrassment, not referring to the smell of blood he had mentioned earlier, but to the dizzying intensity of his cologne.\nThe strong musk engulfed the surroundings, leaving a lingering presence wherever his arm moved, tickling Lorna\u2019s nose.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s fine.\u201d\nLorna closed her eyes, and Nabel caressed the face of his beloved. Then, he slipped his hand beneath her shoulder, pulling her closer in an embrace.\nAs her body rose towards him, Lorna opened her eyes. Nabel rewarded her with a tender kiss, her eyes slightly widened.\n\u201cI wish only my scent would linger in your senses.\u201d\nContrary to her gentle smile, her voice carried a deep desire. Lorna held Nabel\u2019s hand in silence.\n\u201cYour fragrance is too faint.\u201d\nHer earlier thoughts were conveyed exactly as they were. Nabel leaned closer.\n\u201cIf that displeases you\u2026\u201d\nHe buried his face in her neckline.\nThe scent would soon vanish into thin air. But he would not disappear.\nLorna felt the same way. Nabel inhaled the rich aroma of her deep roses near her neck, then buried his face in her neckline.\nHis breath travelled through the thin fabric of her garment. Lorna\u2019s face flushed. Nabel\u2019s strong arms supported her body.\n\u201c\u2026Will you help me?\u201d he whispered.\nA low voice, seductive and enticing. Lorna turned her head slightly to look at him.\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cLike this.\u201d\nHe gently took Lorna\u2019s wrist and placed it on his chest. Her hand rested on top of his white shirt.\n\u201cThe scent is too strong on the shirt.\u201d\nLorna blushed at his words. She understood what he wanted.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nHowever, she couldn\u2019t resist the temptation. Above all, she also wanted to bury herself in his embrace.\n[Click] The sound of a button being undone echoed in the room. Nabel gazed at her fingertips, as they slowly revealed themselves along with the sound of his breath.\n[Click, click] Several buttons gradually came undone. Lorna knelt down and noticed that what was once hidden was now revealing its presence.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The scent emanated not only from his wrist and neckline but also from his shirt.\nThe garment that concealed his natural scent.\nLorna clumsily wet his shirt behind his shoulders with her trembling hand. In doing so, she forgot her words when she saw his exposed body.\nPerhaps she hadn\u2019t seen it in the darkness before. But now, it was visible.\nIt was a mark of his past ten years. A long diagonal scar that ran from his shoulder to below his ribcage. The smaller scars next to it appeared insignificant compared to the large wound.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\nUnconsciously, Lorna placed her hand on the scar. She could feel the roughness of the scars beneath her fingertips.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna could not bring herself to speak. Even Lorna, who knew little about wounds, could tell that this was a wound that could have threatened her life.\nThe fact that the wound had been repeatedly reopened meant that she had overcome it and went back into battle. It would have been a series of bloody battles for a runaway aristocrat with no foundation to reclaim their position. Though she had suspected it, seeing the evidence first hand choked her.\nLorna traced her fingertips over the scar and looked at Nabel. Nabel smiled.\n\u201cThese are scars of the past.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t it wonderful that these scars brought us back together? Nabel bowed his head and kissed her.\nEven if he had to face the threat of his life again without a single scar on his body, he was someone who would not hesitate if it meant being able to meet Lorna.\nSo the scars of the past didn\u2019t matter.\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d\nIt seemed tears had flowed. Nabel lightly kissed her cheek, causing the tears that were streaming down to pause as they touched his lips.\nWith long sleeves rolled up to her elbows, Nabel was restrained from behind, forcing him to move his body in order to kiss her.\nHis trembling lips moved away. Nabel knelt down again and whispered.\n\u201cShall we leave it at this?\u201d\nIn that moment, she thought, \u201cThat would be fine.\u201d Lorna lowered her head and embraced him.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\n\u201cDo not hurt anymore.\u201d\nHer thoughts were understood through his brushing hand. Not only did a gloomy feeling linger, but there was also a sense of purification as the hand that had always read only repulsive emotions when it brushed against people now felt cleansed. Nabel closed his eyes.\nIt was a moment when his tired heart received solace.\n\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201d\nA soft whisper echoed. Lorna removed Nabel\u2019s shirt from his arm. His scent felt slightly stronger.\nWith her hands now free, Nabel embraced her. As their bodies overlapped, Nabel\u2019s presence brushed against Lorna\u2019s leg.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nFeeling it, Lorna blushed. Nabel grinned mischievously.\n\u201cHelp me finish.\u201d\nIt was the same request as before. However, there was a hint of playfulness mixed in this time.\n\u201c\u2026More?\u201d\nLorna widened her eyes. Nabel laughed.\nYou truly have no idea how dark my thoughts can be.\nI want to taint even a small part of you, who remains so innocent. Even if you catch me in the act, I hope you won\u2019t push me away.\n\u201cYes. Like this.\u201d\nNabel guided Lorna\u2019s hand that held onto me. Lorna\u2019s hand followed Nabel\u2019s lead and arrived at its destination, atop his manhood.\nThe formidable presence rising ominously didn\u2019t fully fit within her grasp. As her hand made contact with the heat, Lorna recoiled in surprise.\nHowever, Nabel gently pressed down on her wrist. Lorna felt trapped between his hand and his manhood, unsure of what to do.\n\u201cMilady,\u201d Nabel uttered with a touch of compassion.\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d whispered words more devilish than any other.\n\u201cPlease, help me.\u201d\nEven without an impassioned expression, Lorna couldn\u2019t refuse such a plea. Her blushing ear looked adorable, while a dark demon pondered within.\n\u201cQuickly.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s hand moved clumsily.\nHad this hand ever undressed a man\u2019s buckle?\nNabel immediately knew the answer.\nClumsily exploring here and there, her hand struggled to liberate his manhood. The amateurish stimulation was enough to draw sighs from Nabel.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s short exhalation grew slightly rough.\nNevertheless, it was still clothing, fundamentally. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t know how to undo it. Lorna ultimately succeeded in freeing what was his.\nAs the fabric cascaded down, his possession emerged. Lorna blushed.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nI am the one you rescued.\nNow and always, right? Nabel leaned toward her. Lorna\u2019s back touched the bed.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nIt was a soft sensation. A low pillow lay beneath her buttocks. As she shifted slightly, her femininity was boldly exposed in front of Nabel. While gazing at her lower region, Nabel whispered.\n\u201cYou\u2019re always beautiful.\u201d\nAnywhere. Nabel\u2019s lips met her fingertips, aligning his own with her moist entrance.\nThe penetration was not forceful.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nHowever, the substantial size posed a challenge for Lorna to accommodate all at once. Nabel lowered his head, capturing Lorna\u2019s lips.\nThe intense kiss was enough to open the entrance. Taking advantage of the loosened tension in Lorna\u2019s body, he inserted himself fully in one stroke.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nA high-pitched moan escaped her lips.\n\u201cSsh.\u201d\nThe tightness tinged Nabel\u2019s mind with a whiteness before subsiding. Whenever Lorna\u2019s depths quivered around him, it seemed as if her vision momentarily flashed. The sensitive spot within her walls was stimulated.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nIt happened when Lorna\u2019s hips quivered. The pleasure that overwhelmed reason added vigor to Nabel\u2019s thrusts.\n\u201cAh, yes!\u201d\nHer hips lifted high, allowing Nabel to thrust inward consecutively. The sounds of wetness and moans intertwined between the two closely entwined bodies.\n\u201cHmm, oh\u2026!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s fields of pleasure erupted one after another. It felt as if her entire body trembled. It wasn\u2019t a dizzying or unpleasant tremor. It seemed like the world was moving a little slower. Nabel unconsciously licked away the tears that streamed down her face. In that state, he forcefully plunged deep inside her once again.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s hips rose to new heights. Nabel staked his claim within her. In the sensation of hot desire being unleashed within, Lorna\u2019s breath momentarily ceased.\nBeloved person.\nNabel delved deep into her breath. A long, sweet night was beginning.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "61": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-61/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, Nabel emerged from Lorna\u2019s room as a matter of course. Having already announced his intention to marry as the master of Shinsoo, there were no audacious remarks to be made by anyone.\nIronically, it was Lorna who appeared perplexed. It was only natural, considering she was enveloped in his scent.\n\u201cShall I prepare a warm bath for you?\u201d\nLin immediately noticed the state of her master. Lorna nodded, her cheeks slightly flushed. Nabel had promised her that he would return after finishing the morning\u2019s schedule.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\nLorna smiled in a bemused manner. Even the courtiers, Dia and the maids, were well aware of what had transpired last night, but no mention was made of it.\nSplash.\nAs the water rippled when her hand moved, she could fully enjoy a moment of relaxation in the spacious bathtub. After bathing, Lin applied the rose-scented oil that Lorna adored.\n\u201cWhen the schedule is over, let\u2019s pay a visit to the Knights\u2019 Hall today.\u201d\nNabel had rescheduled the lunch plans for her sake.\nTo Nabel, it wasn\u2019t particularly important that the Zeroth Order Knights had to frantically run around due to his rescheduling. What mattered more was Lorna\u2019s safety. He intended to personally select her bodyguards.\n\u201cYou should handle them with care.\u201d\nLast night, while kissing the tips of Lorna\u2019s fingers, Nabel had spoken. Her fingertips had become much smoother since she started receiving treatments in the Empire, but they still had a slight roughness.\n\u201cPlease refrain from using your delicate hands.\u201d\nHe said so and kissed each of Lorna\u2019s fingertips. Lorna blushed as she recalled last night.\n\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\nNabel had come to see Lorna before lunchtime. Behind him stood the knight who always followed him, Nisha. When their eyes met, Nisha greeted Lorna deeply.\n\u201cAre you busy?\u201d\nEven the sight of her gently knocking on the already open door exuded a touch of desperation. Lorna smiled.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cWell then, shall we head to the Knights\u2019 Hall?\u201d\nNabel extended his hand to her. Lorna gladly accepted his escort and rose from her seat. A light shawl was draped over Lorna\u2019s shoulders.\n***\nThe sunlight was particularly radiant today. Since Lorna had arrived at the Imperial Palace, leaving the palace grounds was a rare occurrence, second only to the Tower\u2019s trial.\nAs a grand gathering was scheduled, where the true owner of the Divine Beast would be acknowledged, outsiders remained within the castle walls. Consequently, the castle\u2019s borders were strictly guarded.\n\u201cGreetings, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cI greet the owner of the Divine Beast.\u201d\nThe knights, diligently maintaining their composure, bowed deeply upon seeing the two individuals. Among them, there was someone who offered a peculiar greeting.\n\u201cI greet the true owner of the ninth stairwell.\u201d\nLorna observed the knight\u2019s shoulder. It bore a pattern slightly different from Nisha\u2019s. Unlike Nisha\u2019s armour adorned solely with a shield emblem, there was a depiction of a sword.\n\u201cHe is a knight of the First Division.\u201d\nNabel whispered softly. Lorna turned to Nisha.\n\u201cNisha belongs to the Zero Division, those who serve the royal family at the closest proximity.\u201d\nAnd you, my lady, will also be served by them as a top priority.\nNabel whispered in a hushed tone, his eyes narrowing slightly.\n\u201c\u2015Though they may not appear knightly.\u201d\nLorna widened her eyes at his words. Nisha, who stood behind the two, desperately maintained her expression.\nIt was indeed true.\nWhile the First Division lived a restrained lifestyle befitting knights, the Zero Division consisted of numerous individuals who were no different from mercenaries, who survived solely by the sword once they shed their uniforms.\nEven though they were of noble birth, it was because they had all spent more than ten years on the battlefield. In the midst of war, matters of noble prestige held no significance.\nTheir sole objective was survival.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\nUnaware of this, Lornatilted her head slightly.\n\u201cShall I go to the Knights\u2019 Quarters first and prepare?\u201d\nNisha cautiously asked. It was a thinly veiled order to assume a human form and present herself. Nabel readily nodded.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Go quickly and make the necessary preparations. So that you may present yourself in a favourable light before my lady.\u201d\nNisha deeply bowed and rushed forward. Two knights from the First Division instinctively took up their positions as her escorts.\n\u201cI hope it won\u2019t be too burdensome for you.\u201d\nLorna chuckled, appearing somewhat embarrassed. She, too, understood the significance of a superior visiting the quarters of subordinates.\nUndoubtedly, it would be burdensome.\nBut Nabel knew. Although the First Division may not care about such matters, the same could not be said for the Zero Division. They needed some preparation.\n\u201cHey, let me borrow your horse for a moment.\u201d\nEngrossed in her thoughts, Lorna failed to hear Nisha\u2019s statement as she intercepted the stable master. Clearly, it was not something a knight would say.\n\u201cYes? Oh, yes.\u201d\nThe stable master quickly dismounted, his face lost in contemplation. The horse had originally been used for transporting luggage.\n\u2015Heeheehee!\n\u00a0\nThe only ones who could ride horses within the castle were the Zero Division and the First Division, directly managed by the Emperor. As Nisha sped away, the stable masters lining the path were taken aback and cleared the way.\nAs Nisha distanced herself from their sight, Lornafocused on remembering the emblems of the two divisions that she would soon see in the Knights\u2019 Quarters.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "62": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-62/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was about forty minutes after Nabel and Lorna entered the knight\u2019s quarters. Nabel had been introducing Lorna to various places, as she hadn\u2019t had a chance to properly explore the palace grounds.\n\u201cYou should have used a carriage or something,\u201d Nabel said, looking somewhat embarrassed. Lorna tilted her head slightly in response.\n\u201cNo, I think I need to improve my stamina,\u201d she replied.\nLorna had spent her entire life confined within the mansion, so she didn\u2019t have the physical fitness one would expect.\nAs Lorna\u2019s steps slowed down, Nabel suddenly stood in front of her.\n\u201cMay I have a moment with you?\u201d he asked.\nLorna blinked, and before she knew it, Nabel had slipped his hand behind her knees and swiftly lifted her up.\n\u201cNabel!\u201d Lorna exclaimed, taken aback, and she lightly hit Nabel. He paused his steps as if he intended to carry her into the knight\u2019s quarters.\n\u201cThe knights would be troubled,\u201d Lorna laughed, her expression filled with embarrassment.\nNabel narrowed his eyes. The knights, taken aback by his gaze, hurriedly looked away and focused their attention on the ground.\n\u201c\u2015There\u2019s nothing more troubling than seeing you in distress, my lady,\u201d Nabel said, planting a quick kiss on Lorna\u2019s neck. He then opened and closed his eyes, enveloped by the intense scent of roses. It was a peculiar feeling.\nHer fragrance had always been pleasant. However, it felt strange that she brought a different scent with her, instead of just her own fragrance that filled the air in the morning.\nHe couldn\u2019t help but teasingly seek out Lorna\u2019s lips even more. The knights\u2019 gazes dropped even lower.\n\u201cWe pay our respects to Your Majesty.\u201d\nAs the two approached, the doors to the knight\u2019s quarters opened automatically. The attire of the knights from the Zeroth Order who were waiting nearby to open the doors had an indescribable elegance.\nThud.\nLorna finally realized it as she stepped onto the floor of the knight\u2019s quarters. The knights were lined up in the impeccably clean quarters, as if they had just finished polishing.\nAnd the knights from the other order, though wearing similar uniforms, had a much more worn-out appearance. However, traces of meticulous maintenance befitting the royal knights were still visible.\n\u201cWe pay our respects to the two honoured guests.\u201d\nThe knights all lowered their heads in unison.\n***\n\u201cTheir words were somewhat perplexing at first glance,\u201d Nabel thought.\n\u201cI welcome both of you,\u201d said the two knightly orders in unison, their greetings exuding an undeniable elegance. Whether it was the meticulously aligned First Order or the Zeroth Order, both groups displayed pristine formations.\nHowever, upon closer inspection, something seemed amiss.\nThe members of the First Order, adorned with sword motifs on their shoulders, stood resolute without a hint of wavering.\nBut those bearing shield emblems like Nishar as their insignia appeared different.\nThey subtly cast fleeting glances at one another, and in front of the restless Zeroth Order, there was no leader in sight.\nThe First Order Commander, Thead, caught onto the issue and subtly gestured.\n\u201c\u2026,\u201d\nHis expression seemed to imply that just anyone could assume leadership. Initially, the Zeroth Order lacked a commander since they were akin to a group of informants directly under the Emperor\u2019s control.\nA spark ignited amidst the belated realization among the Zeroth Order knights.\nWho would wear the commander\u2019s insignia?\nEveryone on the battlefield was aware of it. There was no task as bothersome as donning the commander\u2019s insignia. It was not only challenging to survive in such a perilous place, but also assuming responsibility for others who struggled to do so was equally foolish.\nAs the atmosphere became tense, Lorna tilted her head slightly, and finally, Nishar mustered the courage to step forward and assume the position of the commander, amid tears and determination. Only then did the commotion within the Zeroth Order subside.\nOf course, that did not make the peculiarities disappear. Lorna carefully observed the attire of the Zeroth Order.\nIt was evident that the knight at the forefront hadn\u2019t fastened his sleeves properly. The positioning of their sheathed swords also varied.\nIt was a contrasting sight compared to the First Order, who aligned their swords neatly on their left waists. Furthermore, some knights of the Zeroth Order carried more than one sword.\nIt was akin to finding an incorrect piece in a puzzle.\nAh. They, too, realized the issue and hastily adjusted their sleeves. Some even discreetly changed the positions of their swords.\nThe expression of Thead, the First Order Commander, contorted with evident frustration. He turned his back to Lorna and Nabel, concealing his gaze, as he subtly gestured to the Zeroth Order.\n\u201cWhat undignified behaviour,\u201d his unspoken words seemed to convey.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

When their intense gaze shifted towards the Zero Order, they each cast a piercing look at Lorna.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nIn that moment, as she locked eyes with Nabel, she lowered her gaze. Lorna offered a faint smile.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Well\u2026\u201d\nSuddenly, someone from the Zero Order spoke up. The intended speaker was silenced by the fervent elbow jabs from those around them. There were also those who blocked their mouths from speaking. Lorna turned her attention in that direction.\n\u201cPardon, but I didn\u2019t catch that.\u201d\nLorna pondered whether her words sounded a bit cold. It was the moment when the Zero Order had collectively halted their movements.\nThe knights of the Viscount\u2019s Order, who had always been disdainful, were comparatively easy to handle. Since they treated her inhumanely, she also made an effort not to see them as human. It helped to lessen the chilly disdain.\nBut somehow, she wanted to soften her demeanour towards them a bit more. It was only natural for her to feel this way towards those who showed her kindness.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Well.\u201d\nWhen their gaze met, a knight from the Zero Order finally found the courage to speak.\n\u201cGrant me the honour of serving the mistress of the Divine Beasts!\u201d\nThe knight\u2019s declaration reverberated through the knight\u2019s quarters. Lorna was taken aback, almost covering her ears.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThe astonished gaze of the First Order turned towards the Zero Order.\nHow could they engage in such undignified behaviour!\nHowever, after blinking her eyes a few times, Lorna burst into laughter. The icy gaze from Nabel softened slightly.\nShe was not one who laughed easily. She needed people who could bring a little light into her constantly worrisome existence.\nLorna couldn\u2019t refuse the sparkling gazes of those who looked at her in various ways.\nChoose a few of them.\nAfter contemplating for a while, Lorna spoke up.\n\u201cFor a week, I will observe and make a decision.\u201d\nNabel nodded approvingly. It was true that bodyguards always needed to be by her side, so she was concerned about that.\n\u201d Nisha, Th\u00e9ard, make the necessary arrangements and report back.\u201d\nFor a week, the knights would take turns guarding her. It might be a bit chaotic, but those who were suitable would be able to stand by her side.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure the shift times don\u2019t overlap by two hours.\u201d\nNisha nodded briefly. After all, both the Zero Order and the First Order did not have such a large number of personnel that they could be infiltrated by outsiders. There was no need to worry about outsiders sneaking in.\n\u201cWe accept the assignment.\u201d\nTh\u00e9ard also briefly nodded. Lorna looked at the knights.\nUntil then, she had no idea how much the knights revered the mistress of the Divine Beasts.\n***\nSince that day, a silent battle of wits began between the Zeroth Knight Order and the First Knight Order. Three knights from each order were assigned to protect Lorna\u2019s back.\nHowever, Lorna felt no discomfort. The bodyguards were individuals who had to pretend not to exist. They kept a watchful eye from a distance when Lorna was engaged in personal matters.\nYet, they never forgot to engage in their silent battle of wits.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nSparks flew in the wordless exchange of glances.\nThey were those who had never truly seen the mythical creatures, as they were only young when Fel, the owner of the Legendary Beast, was a Great Sorcerer. Thus, rumours about the beasts abounded, but they had never witnessed them firsthand.\n\u201cYou said you came from the Eastern Continent.\u201d\n\u201cI merely stated that I arrived.\u201d\nThere were divisions within the Zeroth Knight Order. Anyone who dared to say a word about Lorna\u2019s origins received disapproving glances.\nSuch was the significance of the mythical creatures\u2019 owner to the people of the Western Continent. Her origins were no longer an issue.\nThe one who received the love of the gods.\nThat alone was enough to inspire admiration. Of course, it did not mean they had no other thoughts.\n\u201cSister.\u201d\nThe way Nabel addressed her caught their attention, the faces of their lord and lady stood out in their eyes.\nThey had clearly seen Lorna seeking solace, trying to regain the gentleness she had lost on the battlefield.\nLorna was the only person who could provide comfort to their ever vigilant lord.\nThey also knew how their lord, Iber, plagued by paranoia, suspected everyone around him and how he had crumbled. That is why they supported Lorna.\nIt was not just because she was the owner of the mythical creature.\nThey hoped that their lord, who always stood aloof while guarding those around him, could feel at ease by Lorna\u2019s side.\n\u201c\u2026.The knights over there.\u201d\nThat night, Lin quietly observed the bodyguards standing in a corner of the room. After Lorna gave a slight smile to the bodyguards, she spoke.\n\u201cThey are the knights of the Inner Sanctum.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026 They must be the bodyguards since you became the owner of a mythical creature.\u201d\nLin, being from the Eastern Continent, did not fully grasp the significance of being a mythical creature\u2019s owner in the Western Continent. However, she had heard that Lorna was treated almost on par with the members of the royal family.\nEspecially since Lorna was practically promised to become the mistress of the palace.\nNabel\u2019s declaration to proceed with marriage once she was recognized as the owner of a mythical creature still had a long way to go, even after going around the palace five times.\n\u201cI hope you won\u2019t be involved in any more dangerous situations.\u201d\nAs Lin massaged her arms, she spoke with sincerity. Upon hearing her heartfelt words, Lorna smiled warmly.\nIt felt like a dream.\nTo be surrounded by people who were favourable to her and to be able to let her guard down a little.\nShe had always lived with her heart wrapped tightly around her. She remained huddled, unsure when she might suddenly fall apart.\nJust like hunching over in a cold place.\nBut now, she could relax a bit, release some tension. Lorna smiled.\nHowever, she suddenly closed her lips tightly.\nNo, she couldn\u2019t completely let her guard down yet.\nClang!-\nAt that moment, Bellel, nestled in Lorna\u2019s embrace, suddenly jumped up.\nAll eyes turned toward where the mythical creature revealed itself.\nSome knights were so startled that they covered their mouths. Of course, they were all members of the Zeroth Knight Order.\nEmbodiment of magical power.\nThe owner of the Ninth Staircase.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Lorna stood up, still holding Belle.\n\u201cNabel must still be working, right?\u201d\nIn response to her question, Diya deeply nodded.\n\u201cYes. I believe he is still in his study.\u201d\n\u201cWell then, may I step outside for a moment?\u201d\nAlthough Lorna had been told to stay within the palace\u2026 she had somewhere to go.\nThe bodyguards looked at each other.\n\u201cIf you have somewhere to go, we will reinforce the guard on that side. Which direction shall we take?\u201d\n\u201cThe Mage\u2019s Tower.\u201d\nLorna replied promptly. Bell let out a soft cry in her arms.\nThe knights, who were slightly surprised, immediately bowed their heads.\n\u201cWe shall make the necessary preparations.\u201d\n***\nThe Tower of the Sorcerer never forgot the calamity of ten years past.\nOn the day the Great Sorcerer Pell breathed his last, those who had cried out that the empire\u2019s star had fallen still remained within the Tower of the Sorcerer, welcoming the miraculous return of their esteemed master with joyful leaps and bounds.\n\u201cEnsure that no harm befalls the esteemed one.\u201d\nLucel particularly emphasized this caution to the young sorcerers. They were merely individuals who had only heard tales of the Great Sorcerer Pell.\nPell, however, had grown up in the western continent and knew well the treatment bestowed upon masters of the divine in that realm. Yet, the current master of the divine, hailing from the eastern continent, would not be treated the same.\nIt was possible that excessive elation could burden their revered guest.\nThus, experienced sorcerers took it upon themselves to caution the young practitioners.\nAnd then, it happened.\n[Boom!]\n\u201cLord Lucel!\u201d\nThe one who burst open the door was a high-ranking sorcerer who had ascended the seventh step this year.\nWith his beard flowing in the wind, the sorcerer swung open the door and, unable to contain his excitement, spoke.\n\u201cHe, He is coming!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nLucel glanced at the clock.\nSurely not, could His Majesty be arriving at this hour?\nIt was already eight o\u2019clock in the evening.\nHad there been an engagement at the Tower this afternoon?\nIf so, the First Order would have sent word in advance to make suitable arrangements.\nBut that was not the case either.\nThen who could it be?\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\nAs Lucel pondered, footsteps approached closer and closer towards the door of the room where he stood. Lucel rose from his seat with a concerned expression.\nAnd when he saw Lorna\u2019s figure revealed at the entrance, he quickly bowed his head.\n\u201c\u2014I am here to meet the master of the divine.\u201d\nThe young sorcerers, who had been warned to be cautious around the master of the divine, were also startled and bowed their heads. Lucel\u2019s sharp gaze fixed upon the sorcerer who had opened the door.\nYou should have properly introduced who it was!\nThat way, we could have prepared ourselves mentally. He had been the one standing directly beside the Great Sorcerer Pell, yet meeting the master of the divine still made him nervous.\nThat immense magical power was not something that other sorcerers could easily covet. It was a formidable strength that had safeguarded the House of Iber.\nOne who received the love of the gods.\nTo caution the young sorcerers about the master of the divine and then display such an unseemly appearance. Lucel let out a quiet cough.\n\u201cLucel.\u201d\nLorna turned her gaze towards the only face she recognized among the people gathered in the room. The sorcerer who had examined her when she was ill.\nAs Lucel\u2019s name was called, it felt as if his heart dropped.\n\u201c\u2026Yes, I shall comply.\u201d\nHe raised a profound greeting once again as he looked at Lorna. Lorna noticed the eight bracelets dangling from his wrist.\nThe most powerful sorcerer among humans, not the master of the divine.\nThe one who had ascended to the eighth step out of the nine.\n\u201cThere is a favour I would ask of you.\u201d\nShe was a precious guest who had come all the way to the Tower of the Sorcerer. If she had a request, they could have summoned someone to fetch them. The sorcerers listened to her words, not daring to meet her gaze, their heads bowed.\n\u201cI want to learn magic.\u201d\nIn response to her words, I found myself involuntarily raising my head.\nThe master of the divine was the most powerful sorcerer.\nCould there be anyone capable of teaching her?\n\u201cOf course, I understand that Belle is the most powerful sorcerer.\u201d\nLorna spoke while cradling Belle in her arms, gently stroking her.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what I can do with magic.\u201d\nAfter pausing for a moment, she continued with a resolute voice.\n\u201cI want to know how to use magic. So that I can become the most powerful sorcerer.\u201d\nBecause of the promise I made to Nabel.\n\u201cSo that I can become the master of the divine who safeguards Iber.\u201d\nHer determined voice reverberated throughout the room.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

After exchanging greetings with Lorna, they scattered to resume their original tasks.\nOne of those tasks was strengthening the borders of the stronghold.\n\u201cIt is imperative that we verify whether any impure elements have infiltrated the stronghold. I shall personally ensure this.\u201d\nThere could be no objections, could there?\nThe command emanated from the cool gaze of Nabel. They concealed themselves in every nook and cranny of the fortress, hunting down suspicious individuals.\nAs a result, the stronghold was enveloped in an austere atmosphere for a while.\nThe suspicious ones were led away without a trace.\nThose with no suspicions were quickly released, but those found guilty were never seen again the following day.\nJudging them was a task easily accomplished by Nabel\u2019s \u201ctruth-reading hands.\u201d\n\u201cShall we examine this magic circle first?\u201d\nThe same applied within the Maraltop, where Lorna was being accompanied.\nAlthough it was located outside the stronghold, it was in close proximity to it, prompting the Zeroth Order Knights to investigate the Maraltop.\nGiven that it was easy to infiltrate by wearing robes and flipping them inside out, they remained especially vigilant of their surroundings.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a magic circle that creates a barrier to prevent access.\u201d\nBeside Lucel, several bundles of magic circles were already piled up. Meanwhile, three wizards on the seventh step were selecting the circles.\nTo ensure their master didn\u2019t tire, they carefully chose and placed only the necessary ones beside them. Their expressions were cautious.\n\u201cIf you prioritize the stronghold\u2019s defense, this magic circle alone is not enough. Of course, I understand that maintaining the magic requires significant magical power.\u201d\nLucel glanced discreetly at Belle.\n\u201cI heard the former master of the divine beast was able to sustain it effortlessly.\u201d\nLorna scrutinized the magic circles as Lucel explained. Of course, she didn\u2019t possess knowledge of the magic system, so she couldn\u2019t discern the details.\n\u201cIn what way does it prevent access?\u201d\nAs Lorna glimpsed the trembling bracelet, she inquired. Lucel momentarily held his breath and bowed his head in awe.\nOnly then did Lorna correct herself.\n\u201c\u2026In what way does it prevent access?\u201d\nFinally, Lucel, with an apologetic expression, began his explanation.\n\u201cIf someone who created the magic circle doesn\u2019t recognize the face, they cannot enter the palace. Upon entering, they are repelled as if they had collided with a solid wall.\u201d\nPerhaps fearing that Lorna might find the explanation difficult, he spoke while examining her face.\n\u201c\u2026Without the need for directly confirming the person\u2019s face, the magic barrier automatically recognizes and repels those attempting to enter, even those who hide their faces during infiltration.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna slowly nodded. If it could deter unknown individuals, then by familiarizing herself with the faces of the people in Lorna\u2019s palace, she could certainly prevent external infiltration.\nIn Lorna\u2019s palace, where Nabel resided, there couldn\u2019t be a better magic circle than this.\n\u201cI heard you visited the Knight\u2019s Hall earlier today. You verified the faces of the knights, and since only authorized individuals can enter Lorna\u2019s palace, there couldn\u2019t be a better magic circle than this.\u201d\nLucel wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and said.\n\u201cIn addition, if there are individuals who displease the master of the divine beast, even those who know their faces will not be allowed entry.\u201d\nHe coughed a few times and pointed to himself.\n\u201cEven someone with as much magical power as me is the same. Only those who have a similar magical power level to the one who struck the barrier can break through it.\u201d\nIt was impossible for someone who ascended to the eighth step to catch up with the owner of the ninth step. The disparity in mage rankings widened significantly as one climbed higher on the steps.\n\u201cThen let\u2019s install this one first.\u201d\nLorna picked up the paper with the magic circle upon Lucel\u2019s words.\nLucel deeply bowed his head. They were all individuals who willingly revered Lorna. As she tried to divert her attention from the bracelets that trembled on their wrists, Lorna found a touch of condescension starting to become familiar.\n***\nAfter the explosion at the Wizard\u2019s Tower, the Zeroth Order Knights were busy.\nTheir gathering in the Knight\u2019s Hall was brief.

They concealed themselves in every nook and cranny of the fortress, hunting down suspicious individuals.\nAs a result, the stronghold was enveloped in an austere atmosphere for a while.\nThe suspicious ones were led away without a trace.\nThose with no suspicions were quickly released, but those found guilty were never seen again the following day.\nJudging them was a task easily accomplished by Nabel\u2019s \u201ctruth-reading hands.\u201d\n\u201cShall we examine this magic circle first?\u201d\nThe same applied within the Maraltop, where Lorna was being accompanied.\nAlthough it was located outside the stronghold, it was in close proximity to it, prompting the Zeroth Order Knights to investigate the Maraltop.\nGiven that it was easy to infiltrate by wearing robes and flipping them inside out, they remained especially vigilant of their surroundings.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a magic circle that creates a barrier to prevent access.\u201d\nBeside Lucel, several bundles of magic circles were already piled up. Meanwhile, three wizards on the seventh step were selecting the circles.\nTo ensure their master didn\u2019t tire, they carefully chose and placed only the necessary ones beside them. Their expressions were cautious.\n\u201cIf you prioritize the stronghold\u2019s defense, this magic circle alone is not enough. Of course, I understand that maintaining the magic requires significant magical power.\u201d\nLucel glanced discreetly at Belle.\n\u201cI heard the former master of the divine beast was able to sustain it effortlessly.\u201d\nLorna scrutinized the magic circles as Lucel explained. Of course, she didn\u2019t possess knowledge of the magic system, so she couldn\u2019t discern the details.\n\u201cIn what way does it prevent access?\u201d\nAs Lorna glimpsed the trembling bracelet, she inquired. Lucel momentarily held his breath and bowed his head in awe.\nOnly then did Lorna correct herself.\n\u201c\u2026In what way does it prevent access?\u201d\nFinally, Lucel, with an apologetic expression, began his explanation.\n\u201cIf someone who created the magic circle doesn\u2019t recognize the face, they cannot enter the palace. Upon entering, they are repelled as if they had collided with a solid wall.\u201d\nPerhaps fearing that Lorna might find the explanation difficult, he spoke while examining her face.\n\u201c\u2026Without the need for directly confirming the person\u2019s face, the magic barrier automatically recognizes and repels those attempting to enter, even those who hide their faces during infiltration.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna slowly nodded. If it could deter unknown individuals, then by familiarizing herself with the faces of the people in Lorna\u2019s palace, she could certainly prevent external infiltration.\nIn Lorna\u2019s palace, where Nabel resided, there couldn\u2019t be a better magic circle than this.\n\u201cI heard you visited the Knight\u2019s Hall earlier today. You verified the faces of the knights, and since only authorized individuals can enter Lorna\u2019s palace, there couldn\u2019t be a better magic circle than this.\u201d\nLucel wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and said.\n\u201cIn addition, if there are individuals who displease the master of the divine beast, even those who know their faces will not be allowed entry.\u201d\nHe coughed a few times and pointed to himself.\n\u201cEven someone with as much magical power as me is the same. Only those who have a similar magical power level to the one who struck the barrier can break through it.\u201d\nIt was impossible for someone who ascended to the eighth step to catch up with the owner of the ninth step. The disparity in mage rankings widened significantly as one climbed higher on the steps.\n\u201cThen let\u2019s install this one first.\u201d\nLorna picked up the paper with the magic circle upon Lucel\u2019s words.\nLucel deeply bowed his head. They were all individuals who willingly revered Lorna. As she tried to divert her attention from the bracelets that trembled on their wrists, Lorna found a touch of condescension starting to become familiar.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Only in the late night did Nabel, exhausted from the day\u2019s events, quietly fall asleep by her side.\nPerhaps due to her own enchantment, Lorna also grew weary and drifted off to sleep early. No matter how much Nabel longed to see her, she dared not disturb her deep slumber.\nUpon opening her eyes, Lorna cautiously observed Nabel, who had fallen into a profound sleep, keeping a slight distance in case she were to awaken unexpectedly.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nHer long eyelashes caught her attention first. The cold gaze she always directed towards those beneath her seemed to be concealed within.\nLorna reached out her hand towards her, but seeing Nabel soundly asleep for a change, she withdrew it.\nCarefully rising from the bed to avoid any disturbance, Lorna left the bedroom, suppressing any indication of her presence.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nSilently closing the door, Lorna briefly greeted the maids in the room.\n\u201cHave you awoken?\u201d\nDiya deeply bowed her head in response.\n\u201cNisha-gyeong is waiting outside\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\nAs the door cracked open, Nisha respectfully lowered his head. What he brought with him were the documents Nabel needed to see. Since he knew she was staying here in the morning, it was only natural for him to bring them here.\n\u201cNabel has not yet woken up\u2026.\u201d\nUpon hearing Lorna\u2019s words, Nisha deeply bowed his head.\n\u201cIn that case, I will wait here.\u201d\nAs he said that, he glanced at his pocket watch.\nHis lord was a person who rose early, never allowing his guard to falter.\nIt was a habit he developed on the battlefield.\nAnd his mistrustful and cold-hearted nature contributed to his shallow sleep.\nTo think that his lord would still be asleep at this hour.\nNisha had never witnessed Nabel sleeping so deeply while in his service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you come in and wait.\u201d\nLorna felt a strange sensation.\nComparing Nisha\u2019s cautious entry into the room, with the knights of the Lord RidaViscount who wouldn\u2019t even fart in her presence and deeply bowed their heads, Lorna couldn\u2019t help but make the comparison.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201d\nNisha stood in a corner, trying his best not to attract Lorna\u2019s attention. Lorna caught a glimpse of him and took a seat at the table.\n[Thump, thump]\nAt that moment, the sound of a knock was heard. As Lorna turned towards the door, a maid opened it.\n\u201cA light brunch prepared for you.\u201d\nIt was meant for her. Although it was prepared lightly, there were three trolleys arranged behind the maid who stood at the forefront.\n\u201c\u2026Just soup.\u201d\nLorna smiled awkwardly. The maids bowed their heads deeply.\n\u201cIf the meal still feels burdensome to you.\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly\u2026 I have something I want to inquire about.\u201d\nSince returning from Matap last night, she had made up her mind. Lorna received the mushroom soup and spoon, then sat at the table.\n\u201cIs there anything I could prepare for you?\u201d\nSeeing her contemplating, Diya and the other maids brought writing utensils and notepads. Lorna tilted her head slightly as she received the notepad.\n\u201cRather than that, do you know anyone who is knowledgeable about the owner of the Old Inn?\u201d\nThe maids looked at each other in response to her question. Lorna\u2019s personal guards were the same.\nAltaire of the Zero Knight Order discreetly raised his hand at that moment.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s about that, the people in the Wizard\u2019s Tower would naturally know well. They deeply followed Archmage Pell.\u201d\nHowever, it was certain that they must have fallen asleep by now, exhausted from paying attention to Lorna until late at night. It was a bit regrettable to disturb them until the morning.\nLorna tilted her head slightly with a perplexed expression.\n\u201cIs there anything specific you\u2019re curious about regarding Pell?\u201d\nDiya inquired while tidying up around her. Linn, afraid that Lorna might feel cold, draped a light cardigan over her shoulders.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should ask, but\u2026\u201d Lorna pondered with a slightly embarrassed expression on her face.\n\u201cThe master of the Divine Beast knows everything,\u201d Lin confidently stated.\nIf it were a secret of the royal family, then perhaps not.\nFurthermore, in reality, Lorna was practically considered one of Hwangga\u2019s people, recognized by Nabel as a member of the royal family.\nEspecially since their marriage was soon to be arranged.\nUpon hearing Diya\u2019s words, Lorna resolved her dilemma.\n\u201cI wish to know how the former master of the Divine Beast died,\u201d she said.\nThat was what had been bothering her since her return from Matop.\nEven Lucel, the most powerful magician among humans, acknowledged that he couldn\u2019t match the magical power of the Divine Beast\u2019s master, the one who resided on the eighth step. His reverence was evident in his expression, as if he couldn\u2019t even touch the tip of the master\u2019s magical prowess.\nIt didn\u2019t seem like he was trying to flatter her with those words. His expression of astonishment at her magic, which enveloped the entire Lorna Palace, was genuine.\nThe Great Sorcerer Fel, the master of the Divine Beast, possessed such immense magical power. His mere existence was enough to put the minds of those who followed the Iber royal family at ease.\nYet, he was dead.\nAfter his death, the Miltan Gang attacked the Iber royal family.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nIf that was the case, then what Lorna needed to know was how Fel died.\nAt the very least, he shouldn\u2019t have died in the same manner.\n\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\nIn response to her question, the expressions of those in the room, except for Lin, changed in an instant.\nFel\u2019s signs and appearance after his death were not well known.\nHowever, those knights who had spent a long time in the palace, such as Diya and Nabel, who had a deep understanding of the Iber royal family\u2019s affairs, couldn\u2019t possibly be unaware of it.\nSensing their awkwardness, Lorna spoke up.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s difficult to talk about, we can discuss it later.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026 It\u2019s just that I\u2019m concerned you might be startled,\u201d Diya replied, slightly tilting her head.\nThe new master of the Divine Beast.\nShe was someone unfamiliar with bloodshed and violence. They all knew that.\nShe had been surprised even by the sight of a magic circle flashing before her eyes. Perhaps because she had seen many magic circles since coming here, she wasn\u2019t greatly startled, but she still found magic unfamiliar.\nThe bloodshed and violence caused by magic were no different.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nKnights from both the First and Zero Divisions faced each other, as did Diya, the captain of the First Division. They all tried to choose their words carefully but failed.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nThe silence stretched on.\nThey couldn\u2019t bring themselves to speak.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026The Archmage Fel drank poison and passed away,\u201d Nisha finally broke the silence, her words breaking the tension in the room.\nShe could lightly mention it up to that point.\nBut she couldn\u2019t speak so indelicately to someone as esteemed and delicate as Lorna.\nBeside her, the Divine Beast was found with its heart ripped out.\nIn the brutally mutilated corpse, the heart was nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

However, she couldn\u2019t ignore Lorna\u2019s questioning words.\n\u201cIt seems that the person who targeted Fel was likely aiming for Shinsoo\u2019s heart,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHis heart?\u201d Lorna hesitated, and Dia bowed her head.\n\u201cYes. Even knights with extensive experience on the battlefield couldn\u2019t bear to look at the gruesome sight for long.\u201d\nThere was one thing that could be gleaned from their words.\nShinsoo\u2019s heart was missing. And it was a gruesome sight.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIn an instant, a shiver ran down Lorna\u2019s spine as she tightly embraced Belle. Then she suddenly realized something strange.\nOnly those she allowed were permitted to touch Belle. For instance, Nabel or the mages from the other towers were able to touch Belle.\nHowever, people she disliked, such as the knights of Rida Mansion, were unable to touch Belle.\nAs evidence, the knights of Rida Mansion hadn\u2019t harmed a single strand of Belle\u2019s fur with their swords.\n\u201cBut\u2026 Shinsoo couldn\u2019t be touched by just anyone,\u201d Lorna expressed her doubt, and Nisha nodded.\n\u201cThere were clashes of opinions among the mahtab mages even at that time. It is said that a completely new method of harming Shinsoo emerged, or\u2026\u201d\nHe carefully chose his words.\n\u201cIt was someone trusted by Shinsoo\u2019s owner who took his heart.\u201d\nLorna hesitated. It was a horrific event.\nIt wasn\u2019t simply a matter of imagining the gruesome sight.\nIf the person who harmed the Grand Magus Fel was someone Fel trusted, what could be more tragic and gruesome than that?\nLorna held Belle tightly.\n[Kyaaang!]\nBelle seemed to be uncomfortable with Nisha, who made Lorna uneasy. Belle averted her gaze from Lorna and stared at Nisha.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNisha had no choice but to wriggle in distress.\nHow could she appease the Grand Magus?\nAs a member of the 0th Knight Order, accustomed to bribery and lobbying, various delicious foods floated through his mind.\n***\n\u201cPray, do you wonder how the master of the ancient shrine departed from this world?\u201d\nIn the end, there was no choice but to inquire within the sorcerer\u2019s tower.\nHowever, Lorna, mindful not to disturb or tire the sorcerers of the tower, contacted them in the morning and made her way to the tower in the late afternoon.\nThe sorcerers of the tower greeted her with a neat and orderly appearance, quite different from the day of her initial arrival.\n\u201cThe departure of the master was truly nothing short of a calamity.\u201d\nThe aged sorcerer, Adnell, let out a deep sigh.\n\u201cWhile opinions are divided among us regarding the master\u2019s ultimate fate.\u201d\nHe gestured to the other sorcerers, who seemed to have much to say, to silence their voices.\n\u201cIt was said that Lucel of the eighth staircase was undoubtedly aiming for the power of the heart.\u201d\nLucel happened to be absent at that moment. Thus, it was the sorcerer Adnell of the seventh staircase who received Lorna.\n\u201cBut I, for one, am uncertain. Does not the master of the shrine know as well? Who would desire to bear the curse of the gods, stealing the heart of the most beloved child of the divine? Such a wretch will inherit a life filled with eternal suffering.\u201d\nAdnell shook his head, as if horrified.\n\u201cThere are those who believe that the sole purpose was to prevent me from wielding magic by taking my heart. Surely, that aLorna is enough to curse and plague a person.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not as simple as that!\u201d\nSuddenly, another sorcerer interjected from the side, only to quickly lower his head when his eyes met Lorna\u2019s. Specifically, it was because of the six knights standing behind her, their gazes fixed upon him.\nWhat impudence to raise one\u2019s voice in the presence of the master of the shrine!\n\u201c\u2026Forgive me. I merely wished to express an alternative view.\u201d\nHe spoke while watching Lorna\u2019s reaction.\n\u201cThere were rumours that Lord Fel had taken on an apprentice in his final years.\u201d\n\u201cRigo!\u201d\nAdnell attempted to caution the intervening sorcerer. However, Rigo remained resolute.\n\u201cPray, what need is there to conceal information from the master of the shrine?\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless\u2026\u201d\nRigo ultimately silenced Adnell, preventing him from speaking further.\n\u201cThough he could never become a sorcerer, he possessed an insatiable thirst for knowledge of magic. No one could match his grasp of magical lore.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Who could that be?\u201d\nLorna was compelled to hear the name of an unexpected individual from Rigo\u2019s lips.\n\u201cGenas Miltan, the youngest of the Miltan duchy at the time.

In truth, no one was present besideFel when he died.\nIt was simply reported thatFel was discovered lifeless. The magic barrier enveloping the Imperial Palace suddenly vanished, alerting the wizards who had been searching in all directions. Eventually, they stumbled upon Fel\u2019s lonely form in one corner of the palace.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nLorna believed she could somewhat grasp Nabel\u2019s state of mind.\nAs fellow deities, she could sense it. If one were to harm a deity, they would undoubtedly be intimately connected to that deity\u2019s owner, Fel.\nFurthermore, he was a miller.\nHe had set his sights on Archmage Fel, and when Fel perished, he immediately sought the imperial authority.\nHowever, the wizards did not seem to share such thoughts.\n\u201cOf course, we initially suspected that bastard, Genus. However, he was discovered dead a short while later. Moreover, he had no faction aiming for imperial authority, much like the eldest and second sons of Miller Ga.\u201d\n\u201cWhat could he gain by recklessly targeting the deity\u2019s owner, with nothing to gain but danger?\u201d\nThat was a valid point as well. Lorna briefly pressed her hand against her forehead to clear her muddled mind.\n\u201cIs there anything troubling you?\u201d\nThe maid who accompanied her approached promptly and inquired. Lorna nodded her head.\n\u201cI did not wish to expose you before others.\u201d\nNabel had said that.\nHe, too, would have witnessed Fel\u2019s final moments. At the time ofFel\u2019s death, he still remained within this palace as a member of the Iberian royal family.\nLorna clenched her fist.\nIf she were not frightened, it would be a lie.\nThose with power would inevitably become targets.\nHowever, remaining in fear would change nothing.\nJust as there was no change when she cowered endlessly within this mansion.\n\u201cI have a favour to ask.\u201d\nLorna turned to the individuals following her.\n\u201cPlease, give me your orders.\u201d\nThe maid and knights who followed behind her simultaneously lowered their heads.\n\u201cIf possible, I would like to know more about Lady Rida.\u201d\nLin\u2019s eyes widened in surprise at her words. Even the knights seemed startled, though in a different sense.\n\u201cI shall retrieve the information immediately.\u201d\nHowever, they promptly replied. Lorna naturally expected it to take some time.\n\u201cIf you have other tasks, feel free to bring them to me at your own pace.\u201d\nYet, one knight from the Zero Order Knights immediately bowed his head and turned away.\n\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s already night.\u201d\nLorna shifted her gaze outside the window. She was aware that investigating a person took considerable time.\nAnd yet, they were already taking action. Did they prepare in advance?\nLorna soon discovered the reason for the knight\u2019s swift movement.\nIt was when she was resting in her room.\n[Thump, thump]\n\u201cLady Lorna, Knight Pavel of the Zero Order Knights.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\nAs the door opened, he held a prepared document in his hands.\n\u201cHere are the materials regarding Lady Rida, as requested by Lord Countess,\u201d he said.\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cSo soon,\u201d she murmured.\nNo, it couldn\u2019t be.\nLorna realized an important fact; no matter how capable she was, she couldn\u2019t have completed the investigation in less than an hour.\nThese documents were prepared in advance.\nAnd there was only one person Lorna could think of who would be interested in Lady Rida.\n\u201cNabel,\u201d she whispered.\nThose things he had mentioned about the Countess. The contents of these documents must be related to that.\nLorna looked down at the name written on the pile of papers: \u2018Kanna de Rida.\u2019\nSince the Countess hadn\u2019t given her permission to use her name, Lorna found the unfamiliar name of \u2018my birth mother\u2019 rather strange.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna turned the pages with slightly chilled hands.\n\u201cThe real name is Sonnet\u2026\u201d\nA temple-born orphan? Lorna was reading the exact documents Nabel had seen.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna continued to read through the documents.\nThen her gaze stopped at one place. It was a section that mentioned the relationship between Miltan and the South Continental Temple.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\nLorna narrowed her eyes.\nBelow that, it even mentioned the recent Matop incident.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nAn involuntary shiver ran down her spine.\nShe had thought it was terrifying to meet her birth mother.\nEven if Lady Rida was just a weak magician on the third tier, the fear that had tamed Lorna since childhood wouldn\u2019t easily disappear.\nBut she truly didn\u2019t expect that Lady Rida would personally target her.\nLorna clenched her fist. The documents were revealing a lot.\nAmong them, two things stood out the most.\nThe clear connection to Miltan.\nThe Lady Countess affiliated with the South Continental Temple.\nWhen all the pieces were put together, there was only one possible conclusion.\n\u201c\u2026Is Miltan acquainted with Lady Rida?\u201d\nKnight Narret of the Zero Order seemed slightly surprised as he widened his eyes. He quickly lowered his head.\n\u201cYour Majesty is firmly convinced of that.\u201d\nLorna slowly nodded in agreement.\nWith his words, Lorna\u2019s determination solidified completely.\nMiltan was Nabel\u2019s enemy.\nAnd Lady Rida was her enemy.\nBut if these two enemies had a relationship, there was only one answer.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The hand holding the door was bare, without gloves.\n\u201cMay I come in?\u201d\nSeeing Nabel hanging onto the door like that, it reminded Lorna of a young child, and she let out a soft laugh.\n\u201cCome in, please.\u201d\nShe was already dressed in a lightweight dress that she wore to bed. In the soft light, her skin seemed to glow faintly.\nRealizing this belatedly, she quickly lifted the blanket to cover herself.\n\u201cHow did you know I wasn\u2019t sleeping?\u201d\n\u201cIn the palace, even the walls have eyes,\u201d Nabel replied in a calm voice. Lorna tilted her head slightly.\nHis words implied that someone was always watching over her, by her side.\nIt didn\u2019t seem to refer to mere bodyguards or maidservants.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve heard rumors that someone has been secretly assigned to watch over me, Nabel.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it seems I\u2019ve been caught,\u201d Nabel chuckled awkwardly. Despite admitting that he had been caught, he didn\u2019t seem to be trying to hide anything.\nHe gestured into the empty space.\n\u201cReveal yourself.\u201d\n[Thud]\nSuddenly, a person dropped down from the ceiling.\nLorna startled, her shoulders twitching. She had pulled the blanket up to her shoulders, of course.\nThe figure opened their mouth, dressed entirely in black.\n\u201cI greet the two of you.\u201d\nThe soft voice that came out undoubtedly belonged to a woman.\n\u201cWhile the owner of the shrine can assign as many bodyguards as they wish, it is still a cause for concern,\u201d Nabel said softly.\nHe glanced briefly at Lorna.\nYet, whether he thought he had done something wrong or not, the way he looked at her with wide eyes was reminiscent of a startled puppy.\n\u201cThe ones who target you won\u2019t always come through the door\u2026 Is that acceptable?\u201d\nHis fingertips lightly touched Lorna\u2019s cheek, and a faint warmth tingled on her skin.\nThen, he turned his gaze back to the woman.\n\u201cIf I may tell you in advance, I couldn\u2019t mention it because I thought it would make you uncomfortable.\u201d\nNabel glanced at the blanket Lorna was holding tightly and whispered softly.\n\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d\nIt could not be helped. As Lorna nodded slightly, Nabel took her hand. It was a hand gripping a plush blanket tightly.\n\u201cIf it makes you uncomfortable, I would pluck out those eyes.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened at the composed voice. Nabel whispered in a gentle voice.\n\u201cAnd if even the sound of my voice bothers you, I would cut off those ears.\u201d\nLorna quickly lowered her head. She was only slightly surprised.\n\u201cI was just a little surprised because there was someone I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\nNabel gestured to her.\n\u201cBe careful not to bother her.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d\nThe woman concealed herself again.\n\u201cThey are like aquatic creatures, so you don\u2019t have to worry about their eyes and ears.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s heart was pounding all this time.\nIt was natural.\nThere had been someone watching her in the room when she thought she was alone.\nLiving in the palace, of course, this would always happen. Especially Nabel, it would happen even more. He was accustomed to being targeted by unknown people wherever and whenever.\n\u201cWere you very surprised?\u201d\nNabel\u2019s hand touched her chest.\nThump, thump, a rapid heartbeat resonated as he awkwardly smiled.\n\u201cI wished it would beat this fast because of me alone.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t want to make you worried, but it seems like it made you even more surprised, my lady.\nNabel whispered softly.\n\u201c\u2026From now on, there will be no more hiding.\u201d\nHe embraced Lorna. Then he added.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t investigate Lady Rida just to hide it.\u201d\nIt was an honest confession.\nIt was obvious, especially when Lorna started talking about Lady Rida on the night she received the documents.\nLorna looked at Nabel.\n\u201cSo you knew what I saw.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Because the reports come up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Lorna nodded slowly.\nIt was an incident that occurred within the palace.\nMoreover, if he had ordered the investigation first, there was no way the report would not mention the person who wanted to see the information.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to bother you, especially about Lady Rida\u2019s origin or purpose.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t want to reveal that Lady Rida was related to my mother\u2019s death.\nNabel remembered his mother\u2019s face. His mother died before he went to the continent. It was only natural since everyone in Iberga was executed by firing squad.\nEven so, his mother\u2019s face remained vividly in his memory. Perhaps it was because a person\u2019s face under the guillotine was a truly unforgettable sight.\n\u201c\u2026I was worried that you might be sad.\u201d\nOr maybe you would be angry. Nabel wiped her cheeks with the back of his hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay since your memories of your mother are faint.\u201d\nIf she got angry, he didn\u2019t know what would happen.\nBut anyway, it was an unattainable future.\nEven if his mother was alive, the unchangeable fact was that he couldn\u2019t have a happier childhood.\nShe could only consider the possibility that her childhood might have been happier if her mother had been alive.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not surprised.\u201d\nNabel lightly tapped the blanket that covered Lorna\u2019s neck.\nLorna finally remembered that she was dressed in a white and thin dress.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHer cheeks slightly flushed, Lorna hid herself further in the blanket. Nabel chuckled softly.\n\u201cI want to see more of your true self.\u201d\nBut if you\u2019re still embarrassed.\n[Thud]\nHe reached out and turned off the bedside lamp.\nIn the darkness, the two of them remained.

However, there was a slight loosening of the grip on the blanket.\nNabel, with a faint smile, nestled beside her.\nFrom within the warmth of the blanket, he gently caressed Lorna\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cAre you planning to kill the Countess?\u201d\nThe words contrasted with his sweet gestures and casual tone. Lorna faltered.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve seen the documents, you must know that if we kill those who target her, the shadows on the ceiling won\u2019t hide her anymore, and we won\u2019t have to protect her.\u201d\nNabel lightly pinched Lorna\u2019s collarbone.\nFeeling her heart pounding strongly, Nabel briefly covered her collarbone and embraced her.\n\u201cBeing pursued, having someone target me, it\u2019s a frightening thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDon\u2019t you agree? Nabel whispered.\n\u201cTo be honest, I was afraid of being pursued, my lady.\u201d\nIt was terrifying to be targeted by assassins every night.\nHe whispered, burying his face in Lorna\u2019s collarbone.\n\u201cSo, I eliminated all those who pursued me.\u201d\nTo overcome fear, there was no choice but to harm the opponent.\nNabel whispered softly to Lorna.\n\u201cAre you the same, my lady?\u201d\nIf you were to kill even the Countess, who clearly targets you first.\nThen, would this heart that leaps in surprise calm down a bit?\nNabel placed his hand on her chest and, as if playing the piano, moved his fingers slowly.\n\u201cWell, command me willingly. Just by commanding that shadow, it will be enough. After all, the Countess is still under the imperial decree, and moreover, she\u2019s in this palace\u2014\u201d\nCutting her throat would be instantaneous, and if excuses were needed, they could be created.\nNabel\u2019s low whisper tempted Lorna.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nHe reached out and turned off the bedside lamp.\nIn the darkness, the two of them remained.

Regardless of their affiliation to the Western or Eastern Continent, wizards presented vibrant bouquets of flowers of various colours before the Lord of the Spirits.\n\u201c\u2026I present myself before the Lord of the Spirits.\u201d\nAmong them was, of course, Lady Rida, the Countess.\nSince entering the mansion, it was the first time Lorna had seen Lady Rida from such close proximity.\n\u201cDo not fear her.\u201d\n\u201cIt is she who should fear you.\u201d\nLast night, Nabel provided great solace to Lorna, allowing her to finally drift into sleep in the late hours of the night.\nThough physically weary, her mind found solace. It was comforting.\n\u201cLook her directly in the eye.\u201d\n\u201cIt is she who will be the first to avert her gaze.\u201d\nLorna did not respond to the Countess\u2019s greeting.\nInstead, her gaze remained fixed upon Lady Rida.\nIt was an unwavering gaze. There was no fear to cause her to lower her eyes in anticipation of impending magic.\n\u2026\nLady Rida averted her gaze in frustration, as Nabel had predicted.\n\u201cIt has been an honour to meet you.\u201d\nShe uttered the words, as if squeezing them out. And still, Lorna did not look away from her.\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d\nIn that moment, it seemed as though a red flame flickered inside Lady Rida\u2019s mind. This was dangerous.\n\u201cMake the Lord of the Spirits feel fear.\u201d\nThose were the first words of advice given by the Eastern Continent\u2019s ally.\n\u201cUnless we wish to become mere prey for the Lord of the Spirits, we must crush her completely, preventing her from even making a wish.\u201d\n\u201cOtherwise, we will be devoured by the Lord of the Spirits.\u201d\nThe Divine Beast, adored by the gods. She not only erected a tower that crumbled with a mere wish, but she also reversed time as if nothing had happened at all.\nLady Rida, standing on the third step, possessed an unimaginable power.\n\u2026\nShe believed she had succeeded. Lorna de Rida, who was well acquainted with fear, was a person who dared not even raise her head in front of Lady Rida.\nHowever, Lorna was changing.\nLady Rida stepped back from Lorna, her lips gnawing in consternation. This was an emergency.\n\u201cI must quickly contact the ally.\u201d\nAs she hastened her steps, two figures followed closely behind her. Of course, Lady Rida remained completely unaware of their presence.\n***\n\u201cHurry!\u201d\nLady Rida, with an anxious heart, reprimanded her subordinates for no reason.\nStartled by her sharp tone, the servants of Count Rida quickly moved their hands.\nThough it was forbidden to bring members of her family to the ceremony at the shrine, no one would dare object to her discreet manipulations.\n\u201cIf one acquires power, one should make good use of it.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t that so?\nLady Rida had always held this belief as she schemed to usurp the position of Countess Rida.\nShe had no intention of living uncomfortably, as she did in the shrine.\n\u201cQuickly, we must arrive as soon as possible! Hurry!\u201d\nShe urged once again.\n\u201cUh, where should I escort you, my lady?\u201d\nThe bewildered steward asked, bowing his head. Lady Rida grew irritated.\n\u201cTo the Southern Continent Shrine!\u201d\n\u201cI will bring you there immediately.\u201d\nThe astonished steward bowed his head. Lady Rida turned her head away from him in frustration. Nothing pleased her. She found no satisfaction in anything.\nInside her agitated mind, there was only Ronne.\nThat cold, penetrating gaze.\nAs if she had become someone else entirely.\nShe bit her lip.\nShe chewed on her lip until it bled, unable to remain still.\n\u201cClearly, we should have taken her with us this time\u2026.\u201d\nThe accomplice had said that this would be the last opportunity. Kidnapping someone who had gained recognition as the owner of a divine beast was no easy task.\nBut the plan had utterly failed.\n\u201cFor now\u2026.\u201d\nFor now, let\u2019s wait for another opportunity. The chance will come someday.\nShe pondered while tapping her leg with a fan, her unease evident. First, she needed to contact the accomplice through the shrine.\nShe didn\u2019t know exactly who the accomplice was. The Southern Continent Shrine to which she belonged was no different.\nThe Southern Continent Shrine had promised the accomplice substantial funds and power in the continent. This promise was even greater for Lady Rida.\nMaster of the Divine Beast.\nThe accomplice proclaimed that he had no intention of employing the master of the divine beast for an extended period. It was too perilous to possess such formidable power for a prolonged duration.\n\u201cDo you not desire immense magical prowess?\u201d\nThe accomplice had made a separate agreement with Lady Rida.\nIn exchange for taking on the most dangerous tasks, the master of the divine beast would be bestowed with their vast magical abilities.\nHe knew not in what manner this gift would be bestowed, but the promise was one he had no choice but to believe in.\n[Snap!]\nThose who had sought to tear the accomplice\u2019s paper, claiming it to be a fraud, were all incinerated before Lady Rida, consumed by the flames.\nShe did not know where they had been observing from.\nHowever, one thing was certain.\nA sorcerer who wielded such powerful pyromancy from beyond their line of sight would possess a skill comparable to the eighth stairwell sorcerer at the very least.\nLady Rida herself was a sorceress, and she was well aware of this fact.\nShe pressed her lips together once more.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIn the western continent, the accomplice was rumoured to be a person of considerable strength.\nThough it was unknown who he was, he was certainly not comparable to the Emperor of the Western Empire.\n\u201cTsk\u2026\u201d\nLady Rida clenched her fan tightly, almost crumpling it. Why did fate dictate that her opponent would be that slave, no, an unidentifiable person who may or may not be the Emperor?\nHer mind felt turned upside down. A jumble of thoughts floated aimlessly.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The startled coachman swiftly cracked his whip in response.\nHee-hee-hee, with the sound, the horses accelerated even faster.\n[Creak!]\nLady Rida shot an exasperated gaze at the coachman.\nIgnorant fools who had no idea about their master\u2019s feelings.\nIf she were to become a Countess, she would drive them out of the family.\nLost in these thoughts, she suddenly caught sight of the coachman\u2019s face.\nHad such a person been present in the Countess\u2019s estate?\n\u201cHmph.\u201d\nOf course, that pondering was short-lived. What use was there in recalling the face of a lowly coachman?\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nOutside the carriage, the sound of horses neighing and hooves striking the ground echoed, but the coachman\u2019s ears were more acute than one would expect.\nThe coachman heard every sound, even the Countess\u2019s stifled fart.\nTheir gaze met, the one sitting on the coachman\u2019s seat and the knight clad in Lady Rida\u2019s armour.\nThe knight spoke up.\n\u201cThis demeanour is truly despicable.\u201d\nOf course, their hushed voices only reached each other\u2019s ears.\n\u201cIs this not worthy of an extra allowance?\u201d\nTo any passersby, they appeared no different than mercenaries on the streets.\nHowever, near their hearts, the distinct shape of a shield emblem was engraved.\nThey were none other than the knights of the Zero Order sent by Navel, always surveilling Lady Rida.\nAnd at any moment, they were prepared to seize her neck.\nThat was their mission.\n**\nThe reception welcoming the new owner of the magnificent mansion lasted for several days.\nLater, Lorna\u2019s energy dwindled to the point where she could only put on a facade and enter with her face alone.\nNabel had scaled down the reception for her sake.\n\u201cI would advise against extending the reception until late at night, considering the state of your resilience.\u201d\nExcuses were welcome, and of course, they weren\u2019t entirely lies.\nDuring this time, Lorna had been focused on examining the magical defenses within the mansion.\nLucel was seeking a way to apply the magical barrier that had been tested within Lorna\u2019s residence to the entire mansion.\n\u201cExpanding the range shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, as it\u2019s simply a matter of widening it. The problem lies in\u2026\u201d\nLucel spoke with a slightly troubled expression.\n\u201cThere are three issues. Firstly, it is impossible for you, Lady Lorna, to know everyone entering the mansion. Secondly, despite pouring immense magical power, we cannot filter out those who have already entered the palace. And lastly, the range of application is so extensive that it may impose a burden on your body\u2026\u201d\nCertainly, the magic used by Fel, the previous owner of the mansion, posed no problem.\nHaving spent over twenty years in the palace, he was familiar with the faces of those entering the mansion.\nThanks to that, he faced no issues. However, Lorna was different.\nMoreover, due to her long imprisonment in the Readah Mansion, her health was not yet fully restored. Even after coming to the Imperial Empire and gaining better physical condition, she was still slightly weaker than an average person.\n\u201cI will find a way to remedy this as soon as possible.\u201d\nMagician Lucel did not receive the honorary title of the late Grand Magician Fel without reason.\nAmong the magicians of the Imperial Empire, he possessed an exceptional understanding of magical diagrams.\n\u201cThen I shall rely on you.\u201d\nAlthough it was true, he did not dare to lift his head in the presence of the owner of the mansion.\nHe could keenly sense the powerful magical aura emanating from the owner and flowing through the body of the divine beast.\n***\nWhile they were preoccupied with the security of the fortress, preparations were underway on the other side of the stronghold. It was one of the reasons Nabel had been busy these past few days.\nIf it were any other matter, he could have delegated the tasks to the subordinates. But this was something Nabel wanted to handle entirely on his own.\nOf course, there were discussions to be had with Lorna as well.\n\u201cYour Highness, the preparations for the wedding ceremony are progressing smoothly.\u201d\nThe report had been received two days prior. However, Nabel\u2019s face was devoid of a smile.\n\u201c\u2026Smoothly?\u201d\nIt had undoubtedly been smooth until yesterday.\nThe preparation of Avant Palace, the exclusive venue for the royal family, had already been completed.\nNot to mention, the capital\u2019s dressmaking workshop had cleared its reservations for an entire week, solely for the most noble bride in the entire empire. The losses incurred during that period had been adequately compensated by the imperial court.\nSuch was the level of dedication and meticulousness put into the bride\u2019s dress.\nEverything else was in order, except for one thing.\n\u201c\u2026Nisha.\u201d\nHis chilling voice called out to Nisha.\n\u201cYour Majesty, please speak.\u201d\n\u201cWhere has the \u2018Bride\u2019s Crown\u2019 that should be here gone?\u201d\nNabel and Nisha were in the underground chambers of Avant Palace.\nThe \u2018Bride\u2019s Crown,\u2019 which had never disappeared from any of the previous Iberian royal weddings, held a profound significance\u2014it recognized anyone not of Iberian royal blood as an Iberian. It was an essential item for the wedding ceremony.\nFurthermore, those unrecognized by the crown were unable to access the secret passage reserved exclusively for the royal family.\nIt meant that they couldn\u2019t avail themselves of all the magical wonders permitted to the royal family, such as the enchantments installed in the tower, which Lorna couldn\u2019t see at present.\nBecause he was not acknowledged by the Bride\u2019s Crown.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNisha\u2019s face turned pale as she looked at the empty spot where the Bride\u2019s Crown should have been.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Lorna raised her gaze to the unfamiliar man who appeared through the window, just as Nabel had occasionally done, but he was not Nabel.\n\u201c\u2026Who is he?\u201d she inquired.\nEmerging abruptly from Lorna\u2019s shadow, Belle sprang forward and regarded the unfamiliar figure. The man dampened the hood of his silver robe.\n\u201c\u2026Silver hair?\u201d\nIt was a colour that had vanished from the Empire ever since the Iberrian royal family regained control.\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\nInitially, she had assumed that the individual entering through the window must be Nabel.\nA shadow that shielded the light streaming in through the window.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nThat shadow was undoubtedly not Nabel. This person was much smaller in stature than Nabel.\nNabel, having wielded a sword for a long time, was a sturdy figure capable of embracing Lorna firmly. However, the man standing by the window was different.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe appeared to be a distinguished scholar. Glasses glistened near the man\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d Lorna questioned, wary of him. At that moment, Belle\u2019s ear perked up from Lorna\u2019s shadow.\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nA small exclamation escaped the man\u2019s lips upon seeing Belle\u2019s emergence from the shadow. Belle interposed between Lorna and the man.\n\u201cIt seems you may have taken the wrong path.\u201d\nThe man raised his hand slightly, indicating his intention to leave through the window.\nIt appeared that he was about to depart in the same manner. However, Lorna had already caught sight of the silver hair concealed beneath the hood.\nSilver hair, a colour that had vanished from the Empire.\nA symbol of the Milltan family.\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nLorna called out to him and halted his departure.\nOf course, silver hair was not exclusive to Milltan on the continent. However, there were more than a couple of peculiarities.\nSetting aside the rest, this place was an area where Lorna did not allow unknown individuals to enter.\nUnless they possessed magical power similar to that of a deity\u2019s master.\n\u201cUnauthorized individuals cannot enter this place.\u201d\nAs if comprehending Lorna\u2019s intent, a white and translucent magical barrier formed on the window. It was Belle\u2019s creation.\n\u201cHa.\u201d\nThe man turned around slowly, seemingly resigned to the situation, and surveyed Lorna.\nIn doing so, he reversed his dampened robe hood.\nThat was when it happened.\n[Boom!]\nDirectly above the man, someone fell from within the shadow. Lorna was momentarily surprised but quickly recognized them.\nIt was the person Nabel had introduced to her, not with words but with a gesture.\nThe woman\u2019s sword descended straight onto the man\u2019s chin. The distance was so close that it would have been difficult to raise a hand in defense.\n[Clang!]\nThe man glanced upward for a moment, then swiftly snatched the woman\u2019s wrist.\nHe chuckled.\n\u201cWho might this be, the hound of Iberr?\u201d\nHis voice contained a hint of mockery. The woman\u2019s trembling hand, caught in the man\u2019s slender arm, revealed where his strength resided.\nRone widened her eyes upon witnessing a flash of blue light emanating from the man\u2019s arm.\nAnd in the next instant, he swung the hand gripping the woman\u2019s wrist, as if he were about to throw her away.\n\u201cBellee!\u201d\nAt that moment, there was only one thing Rone desired.\n\u201cI hope that person isn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n[Grunting!]\nA white veil immediately enveloped the woman\u2019s body, and she collided with the ceiling of the room.\nThud!\nThe black mask that had covered the woman\u2019s mouth fell to the ground. The man licked his lips.\nAs he raised his hand, an ominous red light flickered.\n[Gruuuung!]\nThe air in the room grew heavy in an instant.\nInitially, Rone thought it was a figment of her imagination. It felt as if she were inhaling breath filled with heat and humidity.\nAs though she had entered scalding water.\n[Kyaaang!]\nBellee raised her tail upright. The white aura surrounding the woman and Rone intensified.\n\u201cTake cover here!\u201d\nAs soon as the woman found an opening, she shouted. It was the moment she attempted to swing her sword.\n[Sccccch\u2026]\nAs Bellee ventured beyond the protectIber white barrier, the tip of the sword disintegrated, releasing a white smoke. Rone\u2019s eyes widened.\nIt wasn\u2019t just the sword disintegrating.\nEverything within the room was melting away. The bed and thin fabrics began to char black at the edges. They screamed out in agony as they swiftly turned black and crumpled.\n\u201cI thought you would be weakened by the tower.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s eyes widened slightly. His dark green eyes behind the spectacles gleamed.\n\u201c\u2026Bellee!\u201d\nHis gaze appeared menacing, causing Rone to clench her fists.\nShe called out to Bellee without knowing what she truly desired.\nResponding to her innermost wish, Bellee emitted a radiant light.\n***\n[Kurrung]\nThe underground of Avalt Palace was a solidly constructed place. It was only natural that the security was thorough, considering it stored valuable possessions of the royal family.\n\u201cA tremor?\u201d\nShaking in such a place was not an easily possible occurrence. Nabel hurriedly left the underground of the palace.\nIn case of any unforeseen circumstances, Nisha took the lead.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nUntil they escaped from the underground of Avalt Palace, there was nothing out of the ordinary in the surroundings.\n\u201cNisha.\u201d\nNevertheless, Nabel noticed one possibility. The possibility of something magical happening.\nIn the palace, nothing happened without reason.\nNo matter how trivial, nothing could be ignored.\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\n\u201cSend someone to the mausoleum right now\u2014\u201d\nHis words were cut short.\n[Quaaaang!]\nA tremendous noise shook the ground. If one was not accustomed to handling a sword, they would have lost their balance and fallen. Nabel\u2019s eyes widened.\nThe sound of the explosion came from the direction of Lorna\u2019s Palace.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

And yet, there was no way her figure in such a clear place would go unnoticed by Nabel.\nKukung!\nNabel forgot to speak.\nHe saw a few bright white magical circles flash in front of Lorne. Of course, they were all Belle\u2019s creations, resting on her shoulders.\nAnd those magical circles were attacking a man floating in mid-air. Judging by the flames of magic that were being created from the direction of the magician\u2019s tower, they were aimed at the man.\n\u2026!\nWatching the man wave his hand to dismiss the mausoleum\u2019s magic as if he were chasing away flies, Nabel didn\u2019t remain idle.

Without looking back, Nabel didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he leaned his arm back as far as possible and steadied himself on the horse.\n[Hooong!]\nIn an instant, Nisha\u2019s spear flew towards the scene.\nAs the astonished man reached out his hand downward, the spear borrowed by Nisha disappeared without leaving a trace, melting away.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t completely ineffective.

Genas was thrown back more than a hundred metres and turned to face Lorna.\nAs he reached out his hand, a crimson magic circle flashed.\nRoar!\nThe people near Lorna\u2019s palace, who were prepared for the impact, looked up at the sky. Genas\u2019 magic was not immediately manifested.\nJust one beat after the black clouds gathered above Lorna\u2019s palace, lightning struck.\n[Crash!]\nThe surroundings were bathed in a white light, then returned to normal. Nabel, startled, glanced at Lorna.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLorna, of course, remained unscathed, and even the palace stood intact.\nApart from the scorched ground in an empty area near the palace where a fragment of lightning had struck, there was hardly any difference before and after the lightning fell.\nSizzle! The floor burned black and smoke rose.\n\u201cYour Majesty, he\u2019s gone!\u201d\nWhat?\nNabel\u2019s relief was short-lived.\nLooking back at the sky, he noticed that the crimson magic circle was fading.\nGenas, who had been there, had disappeared without a trace.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel narrowed his eyes.\nIt seemed he had concluded that the situation was unfavourable to him.\n\u201cShould we search for him?\u201d\nNisha\u2019s words made Nabel shake his head.\nHe knew because he had seen the great sorcerer Fel in his childhood.\nSomeone with tremendous magical power capable of moving clouds.\nCompared to Fel, who had the ability to make rain fall across the entire empire, it was only natural that Genas was inferior.\nBut one thing was certain: if he had fled, he would have already escaped from the palace.\n\u201cNo, first assess the damage.\u201d\nNabel did not avert his gaze from Lorna.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLorna looked in Nabel\u2019s direction.\nShe was surrounded by the white light of Belle, standing on the precarious edge of a broken building as if it could collapse at any moment.\nHer body floated in mid-air.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThe people below who had been looking up at her were startled and turned their gazes away. Lorna seemed to have realized that fact a little too late, as she covered her face.\nNabel\u2019s chilling gaze swept the surroundings. Even those who had been marvelling at the magic were taken aback and lowered their eyes to the ground.\n\u201cMy lady.\u201d\nHe took a short breath. Nabel finally exhaled when Lorna approached close enough to feel his breath.\nLorna was unharmed, without a single injury.\nDespite the powerful magic that had been unleashed, Belle\u2019s magic had completely protected her.\nNabel looked at the ruined Lorna Palace.\nMeanwhile, Lorna opened her mouth, seemingly embarrassed. She hadn\u2019t expected it to come to this.\nIt seemed she had only thought that she had to defeat that sorcerer somehow, and that the person who had protected her did not want to see anyone die.\n\u00a0\nThe resounding echo still lingered in the ears, as if it were a haunting melody.\nIn the blink of an eye, the howling wind and the crumbling debris flew into the room, carried by the force of destruction.\nThe once heavy air, enchanted by the sorcerer\u2019s magic, vanished completely.\nThe master of the divine beings, the most powerful sorcerer.\nUntil recently, Lorna could hardly believe those words.\nShe had always been filled with fear in the presence of sorcerers.\nEven though she was called the owner of the divine beings, she had always felt powerless before them.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nHowever, she had a vague inkling now.\nBelle possessed truly formidable magic.\nAnd the one she, the owner of the divine beings, was most intent on following and protecting was Belle.\n\u201cWorry not about the palace,\u201d said Nabel, embracing her tightly.\nIt was fortunate. Truly fortunate.\nCountless times, he had held Lorna tightly.\nThe last time he had seen her was on the day the palace crumbled, the day the Archmage Fel died.\nSince then, the palace has not returned to its former beauty.\nIt felt like it was about to start all over again.\nNabel clenched his fist where Lorna couldn\u2019t see.\nSuch a thing must never happen.\n\u00a0\n***\nNabel and Lorna had relocated to the magnificent Abalt Palace for a while.\nIt was a place where treasures of the royal family, different from those in the \u201cBride\u2019s Crown,\u201d were stored. Alongside the Wizard\u2019s Tower, it stood as another symbol of the Imperial Palace of the Western Empire.\nThis place, the Abalt Palace, had never crumbled even once.\nThe previous emperors did not make much use of this place.\nThey believed that the deceased emperors watched over this place alone.\nOf course, Nabel did not believe in such superstitions that the deceased emperors kept a watchful eye.\nThe reason Nabel moved to this place with Lorna was that it was the most heavily guarded location after the Lorna Palace.\nLorna Palace, partially ruined and corroded, was being investigated by the wizards. It was a miracle that there were hardly any casualties in Lorna Palace.\nThere was one wizard who, unknowingly, stepped on the charred floor near the destroyed Lorna Palace and burned the tip of his foot.\n\u201cTonight, we shall rest in this place,\u201d Nabel said, holding Lorna\u2019s hand as they made their way to the study.\nAs the Abalt Palace was the residence of the emperor in name, the study was well-equipped within the inner courtyard of the palace.\nUnlike other lavish palaces, the study and the bedroom were adjacent to each other.\n\u201cAlthough it may be a bit cramped\u2026\u201d\nThe place Nabel referred to as cramped was a room of such magnitude that it could host a small banquet. It was almost apologetic to call it a room.\n\u201c\u2015Nisha must have already ensured the safety of the surrounding area,\u201d Nabel said, turning to Lorna with a hint of apology.\nHe didn\u2019t bring her to this place to cause her trouble.\nHe wanted to pave a silk road for her after she had walked through a thorny path.\n\u201cYou must have been greatly surprised, Nabel,\u201d Lorna finally spoke after his guidance came to an end.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "76": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-76/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer heart was still pounding.\nWalking amidst countless wizards, being alone with Nabel made her feel somewhat at ease.\nThe other party was an incredibly powerful wizard.\nHer mind was in such a frenzy that she didn\u2019t even know how magic was exchanged.\nWhen the lightning struck the palace, I found myself involuntarily closing my eyes.\nYou must have been as surprised as I was.\nLorna tightly grasped Nabel\u2019s hand. Nabel smiled and lightly kissed her cheek.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been as surprised as you, my lady.\u201d\nAbove all, that bastard.\nNabel narrowed his eyes slightly.\nHe had no idea that Genas Milltan would invade the palace.\n\u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s Nisha.\u201d\nAt that moment, a knock on the door accompanied Nisha\u2019s voice. Nabel let out a short sigh.\n\u201cI have only selected urgent matters for you\u2026\u201d\nNisha had once again become oblivious. Seeing Nabel and Lorna alone, he deeply bowed his head.\n\u201cPlease handle it yourself.\u201d\nWith Nabel\u2019s brief words, Nisha placed the documents on the desk in the study and disappeared without a trace.\nIn the shadow of Lorna, Belle perked up her ears and tail.\nNisha, who discovered it, ran away even faster.\nPerhaps due to what Fell said about how he returned last time, it seemed like she had made a serious mistake in front of the Divine Beast.\nWith a conviction nearing certainty, she pondered.\n\u201cIt seems like quite a lot, does it not hinder you?\u201d\nLorna examined the documents with a worried gaze. At first glance, the documents did not appear to be of remarkable thickness, measuring just over an inch.\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. But, rather\u2026\u201d\nNabel gently took Lorna\u2019s hand. He led her toward the bedroom connected to the office.\n\u201cYou must have been tired from using magic.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted Lorna to rest first.\u201d He whispered as he sat Lorna on the bed.\nShe couldn\u2019t refuse when he soaked the blanket and looked at her as if urging her to enter.\nOne person worked while the other lay down.\nLorna smiled awkwardly.\n\u201cI apologize for this.\u201d\nAs the owner of the Divine Beast, there were tasks she had to perform. She pointed in the direction of the room where Lorna\u2019s palace used to be.\n\u201cLet\u2019s at least set up a defensive magic circle first\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShh.\u201d\nNabel gently placed his index finger on Lorna\u2019s lips.\n\u201cJust a little, take a break.\u201d\nAfter all, Bell, the Divine Beast, was perfectly fine. Moreover, Genas Miltan was certainly not the Divine Beast\u2019s owner.\nUnlike the Divine Beast\u2019s owner with formidable magical power, there were clearly limitations. There must have been a reason why he fled even with such strong magical power.\nEven though this was undoubtedly a prime opportunity.\n[Coo-rung\u2026]\nNabel vividly remembered the time when the tower was crumbling. The powerful magic that turned back time as if the tower hadn\u2019t collapsed.\nThanks to that, Lorna was exhausted. Nabel must have taken advantage of that opportunity.\nThe problem was that the Divine Beast\u2019s owner had much stronger magical power than he had anticipated.\n\u201cJust rest as much as I work.\u201d\nNabel persuaded Lorna. She looked apologetically toward the direction of the office. When she tried to say something, Nabel slightly shook his head.\n\u201cJust a few hours will do.\u201d\nLorna couldn\u2019t refuse his persuading whispers in a soft voice. Eventually, she lay down on the bed.\nNabel shifted his steps with a faint smile. Then he left the bedroom, leaving the bedroom door slightly ajar.\nCoincidentally, the bed was positioned in a way that it was directly visible from the office desk.\n\u201cIs it okay to leave the bedroom door slightly open like this?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\nLorna tilted her head slightly. It was not a problem to leave it open. The light from the office wouldn\u2019t disturb her sleep.\nAfter all, she had slept well even in a more unfavourable environment at the mansion.\nNabel took a few steps away from the office desk, smiling.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re too tired from working, then I\u2019ll see you at that time.\u201d\nIt was a gentle voice. Lorna let out a small laughter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to concentrate like this.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s like a reward.\u201d\nNabel smiled mischievously.\nWhile concentrating, I want to see your unharmed face as a reward, little by little.\n\u201cInstead, you have to work hard.\u201d\nIn response to his whisper, Lorna raised both hands, conveying her apology.\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\nNabel returned to his desk, leaving the door slightly open.\nLying on the bed, Lorna glanced toward the office desk.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he was watching through the crack of the door. But somehow, it felt embarrassing.\nTick.\nThe sound of the pen moving echoed in the quiet room. Then, at some point, it stopped, and when Nabel turned around, he was looking at Lorna.\nHe looked as if lost in thought, resting his chin on his hand, but when their eyes met, he quickly averted his gaze from the desk, like a mischievous child caught in the act.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter several times of locking eyes like that, Lorna eventually got up from the bed.\nNabel, who had been focused on the documents, immediately looked at her as she moved toward the bedroom. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t been able to concentrate on anything here either.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nDo people know that an emperor who reigns over a continent can sometimes be like such a young child? In front of her, he was as adorable as a younger sibling.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t concentrate, Your Majesty.\u201d\nLorna closed the bedroom door with a slight gesture. It happened before there was any sound.\n[Thunk]\nSuddenly, Nabel\u2019s hand appeared in the gap of the door. It was a gesture that suggested he had gotten up from the desk and made his way here without her knowing when.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nStartled, Lorna let go of the door she was about to close.\nThe door opened again. The light from the office illuminated the darkened bedroom once more.\nNabel, revealing himself again, smiled.\n\u201cSo, if you do that, you\u2019ll get thirsty, Lady.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

It was my own fault for not finishing more work last night.\nThen, could I not have comforted my distressed sister more deeply today?\n\u201c\u2026\u2026Napoleon.\u201d\nFinally.\nLorraine looked at Napoleon sitting next to her.\nA faint light flickered in the bedroom. Napoleon seemed to be bothered by the light shining on her, so he subtly created a shadow with his arm to block the light from reaching her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not you who\u2019s disturbing me. I\u2019m the one interrupting your rest.\u201d\nNapoleon said, looking embarrassed.\nBut truly, being by her side felt good. It was the only place where I could work in peace.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLorraine\u2019s gaze met Napoleon\u2019s.\nNapoleon pursed his lips.\nIn the past, it was I who had left abruptly.\nWhy do you seem like nothing but a ghost to me?\nI was afraid that something like today would happen again.\nThe loud vibration, the sight of one side of Lorraine\u2019s palace exploding.\nShe was the mistress of the continent, with nothing to worry about. But Napoleon wished for Lorraine to be even safer than she is now.\nYet she allowed an external intrusion.\nHe felt a cruel sensation. Genas Miltan, who originally could not contain magical power in his body, had no choice but to possess magical power comparable to the mistress.\nAs evidence, he had breached the magical barrier that could only be penetrated by those with magical power on par with the mistress.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThe tremor felt in the underground of the palace, in front of the vacant seat of the bride, was the sound of the magical barrier being breached.\nNo matter how much training one had, it was suicidal to stand against someone who could rival the mistress with the power of a mere human.\nKnowing this, he was angry.\nI want to pluck out the eyes of those who failed to properly protect you.\nI want to twist my own neck, which I left in an insecure place.\nHe suppressed his ruthless thoughts.\nI can\u2019t entertain such dangerous thoughts when I\u2019m looking at you. It was when he released his grip.\n\u201c\u2015Napoleon.\u201d\nAs their gazes continued to meet, Lorraine raised her body, which was lying down, and sat up against the bed.\nNapoleon\u2019s gaze followed her upward.\n\u201cThat person.\u201d\nAs Lorraine began her story, Napoleon set down his pen.\n\u201cEarlier, that magician\u2026 it was Eunbal.\u201d\nMany people must have seen him. Did you see him too? Lorraine cautiously asked.\n\u201cHe looked like Miltan.\u201d\nNapoleon didn\u2019t hear Eunbal\u2019s voice exclaiming \u201cGenas Miltan.\u201d Her surroundings were filled with the noise of explosions and thunder, after all.\nBut she clearly recognized that silver hair.\n\u201cHe was born without the innate ability to accumulate magical power.\u201d\nThe tower\u2019s magicians certainly said so. Of course, opinions were divided.\n\u201cMiltan, that\u2019s right.\u201d\nNapoleon soothed her doubts with a quiet voice.\nIn the end, he even placed the paper he was holding on the nearby drawer.\n\u201cLucel said he couldn\u2019t use magic. At the tower.\u201d\nLorraine\u2019s words couldn\u2019t continue. Napoleon knew what she was going to say. He knew far more about the danger than Lorraine did.\nBecause he knew exactly what she had done.\nNabel\u2019s hand gently touched Lorna\u2019s cheek, causing her eyes to widen slightly.\n\u201cYou seem greatly concerned.\u201d\nBoth of Nabel\u2019s hands rested on Lorna\u2019s cheeks. Unnoticed, he shielded her from the glow of the standing lamp with his back.\nA large shadow loomed over Lorna.\n\u201cThere is no sorcerer stronger than the owner of the Holy Water.\u201d\nYet, you worry. Nabel tenderly brushed her neck.\n\u201cIf you continue to worry like this, I cannot concentrate.\u201d\nBecause you tremble.\nBecause I cannot let my guard down.\nTheir foreheads touched, and Nabel\u2019s warmth spread across Lorna\u2019s slightly cool forehead.\n\u201cI did this to make you more comfortable.\u201d\nWithout averting his gaze from her, Nabel picked up a piece of paper with his pincer-like fingers and dropped it.\n\u201cYou worked diligently, enduring for such a long time.\u201d\nYou worry so intensely, even to the point of catching your breath.\nNabel\u2019s hand glided silently across her body.\n\u201cDo you wish for me to alleviate some of your worries?\u201d\nA low, muffled voice drifted.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s hand that had caressed her cheek trailed downward. With distinct palpability on her clothes, it erased any other thoughts from Lorna\u2019s mind.\nHis palm grazed the curve of her round chest, resting just below it.\nA shallow mound near her lower abdomen.\nHer cheeks reddened at the overtly suggestive gesture.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\n\u201cI am capable of handling the work.\u201d\nBecause it is nighttime. Is it not?\nNabel whispered softly as he leaned towards her.\nAs the paper he had dropped shook the bed, falling to the floor, Nabel briefly kissed Lorna\u2019s forehead and embraced her.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Developed pectoral muscles from long hours on the battlefield could be felt distinctly through his shirt. Lorna blushed.\n\u201cWhen I am with you, I do not entertain other thoughts, do I?\u201d\nNabel swept aside the thick pink hair that had covered her neck while he had shielded it. The neatly gathered hair fell over her shoulder. The exposed nape of her neck was slender enough for Nabel\u2019s hand to grasp.\nAs he clasped the back of her neck, warmth flooded the nape. The hot hand traced down her spine, coming to a pause on the inside of her thigh.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nHis fingertips approached the sensitive valley, teasingly close. Nabel lowered himself, lightly nibbling on Lorna\u2019s lower lip.\n\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\nAllowing Lorna only a moment to catch her breath, he fervently explored her breath. The dense sound of breathing mingled with a moist sound.\nAfter lightly nipping her lower lip and tracing it with the tip of his tongue, Nabel lapped at her upper lip. Then, as if thirsty, he engulfed her upper lip and roughly licked it.\n\u201cHaah.\u201d\nThrough a narrow gap, Lorna exhaled. Nabel felt a surge of warmth in the breath that brushed against his neck.\nWith a slightly forceful gesture, he leaned closer, his hand grasping Lorna\u2019s wavering arm on the bed.\nHe was undeniably adept.\nOnly a few hours ago, several immense spells had ravaged the heavens above the palace, threatening to unleash war.\nOne of the two sorcerers who had fought that day was Lorna.\nThe flashes of fire, the heavy air pressing against their bodies, and the anxiety and tension that dripped with sweat had all occurred just a few hours ago.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nYet now, not a single thought from that time crossed his mind. With each movement he made, the frightening images in his head gradually faded away.\nIt was as Nabel had said. At this moment, he couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nEach time he drew near, it felt as if his thoughts evaporated into thin air.\nLorna\u2019s arm once again brushed against the edge of the bed. Then, in an instant, his hand grazed empty space.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nIt happened when Lorna closed her eyes, overcome by a dizzying sensation of falling. Before her back could even touch the bed, firm arms caught her.\nWith one leg hanging outside the bed, Nabel\u2019s knee slipped between her sensitive area, sending a tingling jolt of pain.\nAnticipation, perhaps.\nA sensation reminiscent of a prickly needle surged from the comforting touch he had always provided. As Lorna leaned into him, she attempted to reach for the inside of the bed with her free hand.\nHowever, Nabel gently guided her hand onto his shoulder.\n\u201cDon\u2019t lean on other places, just me.\u201d\nHis voice trembled like boiling water. In the next moment, he leaned towards Lorna, the hand that had led hers slipping beneath the hem of her skirt.\nHis hand paused atop her undergarments. It was unable to venture inside, held back by the heat emanating from Nabel\u2019s hand. His fingers halted just above her entrance.\n\u201cNabel, what on earth\u2026\u201d\nHe was so skilled. Whenever his hand slid smoothly over her, Lorna held her breath.\nThat\u2019s why her question was meek.\n\u201cWhere did you learn this\u2026?\u201d\nHis adept touch\u2026 It seemed as though he knew women well.\nNabel narrowed his eyes slightly.\n\u201cDid I, perhaps, do this with someone else? Does it bother you?\u201d\nHis words showered Lorna like rain, mingling with her breath.\nUndoubtedly, he appeared well-acquainted with women. But Lorna tried to shake her head.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nA dark shadow cast itself over Lorna. It was the warm shadow that had always comforted her. His hand, which had teased the inner part of her thigh, firmly pressed down on her nipple.\nIt flicked, slipped, and rose again. His seemingly careless touch, brushing against her nipple before slipping away, caught Lorna off guard with its stimulation.\n\u201cMmm!\u201d\nHer body twitched slightly.\nIn the meantime, Nabel positioned himself between Lorna\u2019s legs, his hand firmly grasping her face.\nHis hand was large enough to completely encompass her face.\n\u201cWhat a sweet doubt you have.\u201d\nHe whispered, a gentle smile adorning his lips.\n\u201cListen closely, my lady. For your sake, I would spare no effort, even in the art of lovemaking.\u201d\nAt the words spoken by the mouth of the most prestigious lineage on the continent, Lorna\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Even though she hadn\u2019t yet emerged from within, it recklessly swirled beneath her.\nWithout revealing her usual demeanour, standing firmly with her trapped within her garments was enough to give her an eerie sensation.\n\u201cSigh, ah, mmm\u2026!\u201d\nThe anticipation filled her as the excretion of excitement trickled down, causing Lorna\u2019s face to flush.\nNabel, who had positioned his genitalia at her entrance, couldn\u2019t possibly miss that. From the trembling depths below, he swept aside the fabric coveLing Lorna\u2019s vulva. His gaze remained locked with hers.\nLike pondeLing its whereabouts, his phallus traversed the dense, pink foliage.\nFrom above, the moistened member, having navigated through her labia and explored her vulva, pressed firmly against her c**toris.\n\u201cAh, oh!\u201d\nLorna arched her back. His penetrating object, slicked with the juices that had dripped all the way to her entrance, grazed and entered her directly.\nThe walls of her v****a, stimulated intensely, contracted, enveloping him seamlessly.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nNabel let out a brief moan.\n\u201cI wonder how I can offer solace to you, my lady?\u201d\nHe exhaled fervent breaths as he inquired. With every motion of his body, Lorna\u2019s waist quivered. Unable to wriggle free due to Nabel\u2019s body snugly pressed against hers, her body twisted. And with each twist, his phallus stimulated various spots within her v*****l walls.\n\u201cMmm, yes\u2026!\u201d\nUpon heaLing her moans, Nabel softly chuckled, consideLing it as an affirmative response. He whispered into his beloved lady\u2019s ear.\n\u201cEvery night, I\u2019ve yearned for this.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nIn an instant, Lorna\u2019s movements froze. Perhaps she was taken aback to the point where even her breath ceased. Nabel exhaled a heated breath. The jest had to be brief.\n\u201cYou, my lady.\u201d\nNot just any other woman, but her.\n\u201cHow can I make you feel this way?\u201d\nNabel lifted her waist.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\n\u201cWill you accept me gladly?\u201d\nHis hand enveloped Lorna\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cWill you gaze upon me with such an enchanting face?\u201d\nHer waist quivered. Lorna\u2019s vision blurred slightly. Unbeknownst to me, a tear trickled down, and Nabel gently licked it away.\n\u201cHow can I ensure that you embrace me without pain?\u201d\n\u201cMmm!\u201d\nNabel\u2019s member thrust forcefully into her inner walls numerous times. He whispered in a low voice as he shook her waist.\n\u201cHow can I make you think of nothing but me? That\u2019s what I pondered.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, ah!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s toes rose high. As Nabel covered her eyes with one hand, he thrust vigorously.\n\u201cAh! Yes! Mmm!\u201d\nSuccessive penetrations that had reached her entrance now delved deep inside her, rubbing against her inner depths. Lorna abandoned all thoughts and surrendered herself completely to him.\nHer entire body trembled with pleasure.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nNabel, swaying his hips, had suddenly placed his hand upon her c**toris. The irregular, exhilarating sensations made Lorna\u2019s body tremble uncontrollably. Her toes rose into the air. There was no need for her to grasp the bed as he had suggested. Deep within Lorna, encircled tightly around him, Nabel delved deeply.\n\u201cDo you still have doubts?\u201d he inquired, after bestowing a brief, gentle kiss.\nIn the dampness below, flowing persistently, Lorna could not discern what it was. It was beyond her capacity to see.\nIt was not his alone. The mixture of Nabel\u2019s semen flowing down there did not bring any discomfort. Nabel directed his gaze toward that area.\n\u201cI have no need to look at other women.\u201d\nNabel brushed aside Lorna\u2019s rosy locks. In his life, there was only one salvation. There was no room for anything else.\nHis attention was captivated once again by the intermingling of white and seminal fluid cascading down below. Lorna\u2019s body quivered. Peculiar sensations mingled with embarrassment. Nabel traced the liquid trickling down from her buttock cleft.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nHis finger, dampened with the trickling fluid, entered her entrance and lingered.\nA moist, muffled sound resounded distinctly in Lorna\u2019s ears. Nabel inserted it and then withdrew his finger as if intending to scrape her inner walls. His finger scraped against the walls and emerged unchanged.\n\u201cHmm!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

She was now sitting astride him, and at times, she had been bigger than him. However, the difference in their current builds was stark.\nHow could such a large and daunting thing fit inside her was a wonder.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nHer scream rang out loudly. If anyone were in the office, they would surely hear it. Unconsciously, Lorna covered her own mouth. Nabel briefly pressed his lips against it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one in the office, my lady.\u201d\nEven without their hands touching, he knew what worried her. He shifted his hips.\n\u201cHmm!\u201d\nLorna was deeply penetrated due to her position astride Nabel.\n\u201cAh, ah, hmm\u2026!\u201d\nHer head involuntarily fell backward. Nabel buried his face in the exposed nape of her neck.\n\u201cBut if you are still concerned, I shall reassure you.\u201d\nLorna was practically clinging to Nabel. With her legs wrapped around his waist, he lifted her body.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nStartled, Lorna embraced him tightly. With that, his member delved even deeper into her.\n\u201cHuff!\u201d\nHer waist trembled. Nabel gradually approached the door.\n\u201cNabel!\u201d\nThe door swung open.\nNabel helped her, whom he had embraced, to touch the ground. He grasped her delicate shoulders and turned her gaze toward the office.\nIndeed, there was no one there.\nThe office was spacious enough that even the faintest sounds would not reach beyond the door.\nLorna\u2019s face, bathed in bright light, was flushed with a rosy hue.\n\u201cNo one is here, right?\u201d\nHe whispered softly in her ear, barely brushing against it. Lorna believed him, but the relief she felt when confirming it with her own eyes was beyond measure.\nHis hand infiltrated beneath her. The sensation of semen and v*****l fluid cascading down her thighs as he wiped it away was poignant.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nSurprised, Lorna closed her legs. Nabel\u2019s hand roamed between her thighs and, slightly upwards, found the plumpness within her thighs.\n\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201d\nThis was not a suitable place to receive pleasure. When Nabel\u2019s thumb pressed firmly against her c**toris, Lorna\u2019s legs weakened, and she wavered.\n\u201cTake it slowly.\u201d\nNabel supported her legs. In that state, she leaned entirely on Nabel, bearing her full weight on him.\n\u201cHaang, aang! Umm!\u201d\nThe anxieties and worries that had filled her mind evaporated into thin air. Lorna climaxed several times.\n***\nLorna had completely fallen into a deep sleep by the time the sun was about to rise.\n\u201cYour mind must be filled with complexities.\u201d\nLast night, Nabel whispered as he stole her breath away.\n\u201cThere were frightening things too. So.\u201d\nToday, please forgive me just this once.\nWhispering those words, he delved into her breath, searching its depths. Her mind became so dizzying.\nWith no knowledge of when Lorna had fallen asleep, his touch gradually transformed from provocative to tender, caressing her gently.\nThe last thing she saw was the faint light filtering through the curtains.\nStill, thanks to Nabel, she felt at peace.\n\u201cI thought you might give me nightmares.\u201d\nUndoubtedly, the heavy air that weighed upon the room was filled with dread.\nIt made her throat burn as if she were breathing in hot water.\n\u201cAre you awake?\u201d\nThe terrifying image that she was trying to recall vanished abruptly.\nLin approached Lorna, holding a towel in her hands, and smiled playfully.\n\u201cI heard you haven\u2019t been asleep for long. You can rest a little longer.\u201d\nLorna blushed at her words. As she averted her gaze, Nabel appeared through the partially open door.\nJust like before Lorna fell asleep, Nabel was idly toying with a pen on the bright desk in the office.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nBut when Lorna\u2019s eyes met his, he grinned.\nMany of the stacks of documents that had been piled beside him had disappeared, indicating that he had hardly slept.\nYet, he seemed to be in good spirits.\nLorna sat up.\n\u201cSince it\u2019s past noon, the people in the Martop must be awake, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Shall I ask them to come?\u201d\nLin\u2019s question was met with a brief nod from Lorna.\nAs she had told Nabel before falling asleep, she wanted to install a magic circle here as well.\nAlthough it wouldn\u2019t be able to stop the magician.\nNevertheless, there shouldn\u2019t be a recurrence of the events from before. Like finding poison in the food.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThinking of the silver-haired magician, whose identity was undoubtedly concealed, Lorna shook her head slightly. At some point, Nabel, who had silently approached, tilted his head toward her.\n\u201cYou should rest a little more.\u201d\nLorna shook her head. At this rate, night and day would completely reverse.\nAs she was about to fully rise from the bed, Nabel took her hand and escorted her.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nSince it was daytime, the office appeared brighter. Lorna slightly opened her eyes at the cheerful sunlight streaming in through the wide windows.\nNabel, who was smiling softly, guided her to the desk.\n\u201cYou can sit here.\u201d\nIt was the chair where I had been sitting. And I leaned against the desk, looking at the documents.\n\u201cYou should sit and work.\u201d\nLorna chuckled slightly at his confusion.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nAs if trying to stop Lorna from getting up, he gently kissed her forehead.\n\u201cStay like this. I know what happened to you last night.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna\u2019s face blushed quietly. Nabel burst into laughter.\n\u201cBut Lady, have you decided on the Knights who will serve as your guard?\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nHis words widened Lorna\u2019s eyes.

Nisha was tasked with assessing the atmosphere at the scene of the Lorna Palace, where safety had not yet been fully secured.\nOf course, one of his duties was also to collect the reports from Lorna Palace and deliver them to Nabel.\n\u201cAh, Lady Nisha!\u201d\nAs he approached the Lorna Palace, the wizards displayed a range of expressions. The stack of papers piled beside them swayed precariously with each movement, indicating the abundance of information to be reported.\n\u201c\u2026Are those all reports?\u201d\nDo the wizards not know how to write reports? Nisha glimpsed at the seemingly disorganized reports and inquired.\nThe wizards shook their heads.\n\u201cWe will provide you with a summarized version. However, it may take some time, so for now, we would like to give you a brief report, Nisha.\u201d\nThe wizard on the sixth step of the staircase spoke.\nNisha nodded briefly. He took out his ever-present notebook and pen, preparing to listen to the report.\nIn front of him, the disorderly conversation among the wizards unfolded.\n\u201cThere is hardly anything left in terms of physical form.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless, the flow of magic power\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Due to the effects of a large-scale magic that affected the magical barrier of Lorna Palace\u2026\u201d\nAs Nisha listened, his expression grew increasingly serious. Observing his demeanour, the wizards became more enthusiastic about the report.\n\u201cSo we need to draw magic circles\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAdding these functions to the new magical barrier\u2026\u201d\nNisha possessed the ability to quickly grasp the desired information even in complex battlefields. He also had the concentration to not miss the stories of passersby, which were of his interest.\nHowever, it was only effective if he was familiar with the subject matter.\nWith a progressively serious expression, Nisha opened his mouth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand a single word you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nBelatedly, the wizards recalled that Nisha was a member of the Zero Knights. The wizard on the seventh step approached and provided a brief summary.\n\u201cWe will submit a separate report. The important point is that the magical power that affected this place has been confirmed to be at least as strong as Lord Lucel\u2019s or even stronger. It has also affected the entire Lorna Palace, causing the ground itself to become unstable. It would be best to stabilize the palace as soon as possible.\u201d\nIt was a neat summary. Nisha nodded.\n\u201cI will report it accordingly. Can I come and receive a detailed report tomorrow?\u201d\nNisha turned around.\nHe was already a person with a lot on his plate. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to have the Lord wandering around when the safety of the palace had not been properly ensured.\nIt was his role to receive and compile the major reports from each palace.\n\u201cIt seems we can have a detailed report tomorrow at Lorna Palace.\u201d\nNisha looked up at the sky. It ended earlier than expected. After roughly estimating the time, he headed towards another palace near Lorna Palace. It was the last place he had to visit.\n\u201cDo you have a sound mind or not?\u201d\nAs he walked, Nisha spotted a quarrelling couple. The soldier without weapons was reprimanding the superior standing in front of him, tears streaming down his face.\n\u201cDoes it make sense to lose your weapons? Don\u2019t you know how precisely the weapons in the imperial stock are counted? What would happen if valuable items fell into the hands of an evil person?\u201d\nOnly now did Nisha recognize the face of the soldier, who had been somewhat familiar. He was the owner of the spear he had borrowed (?) briefly when Jena Milta appeared.\nNisha quickly changed his direction and headed towards the weapons storage. He randomly picked up a spear and approached them.\n\u201cRest assured, it won\u2019t fall into the hands of an evil person. This is a gift.\u201d\nNot to mention the evil person, the spear would have been shattered in the magical explosion.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nSuddenly, the soldier turned at the sound of a voice, and there, on Nisha\u2019s shoulder, he spotted the emblem of the Zeroth Order Knights.\n\u201cHmph.\u201d\nOne of the soldiers let out a scoff. He seemed surprised by the insignia of the Zeroth Order Knights, which represented a stubborn and unruly bunch who were best left alone.\nThe two soldiers discreetly stepped back.\nDespite Nisha\u2019s involvement in important affairs and her favourable impression, it was apparent how the other knights of the Zeroth Order would be treated in the palace.\nOf course, Nisha and the Zeroth Order Knights had no interest in such judgmental gazes.\n\u201cGreetings, gentlemen.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nDismissing the soldiers\u2019 greetings, Nisha finally arrived at her destination. It was essentially a palace that served as a haven for the medical staff of the Inner Citadel, where most of them congregated.\n\u201cAre you Nisha?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to meet Lady Tanya.\u201d\nNisha had taken the time to seek out the shadow of the Zeroth Order Knights, the person who had recently guarded the owner of the Divine Beast within their shadows.\nAt the mention of Lady Tanya\u2019s name, one of the doctors hesitated.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s her\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHas she\u2026disappeared?\u201d\nThe doctor\u2019s widened eyes seemed to question how Nisha knew. Nisha gestured with her hand.\n\u201cCould you guide me to the room where she was last seen?\u201d\nWhy would she want that?\nBut the doctor didn\u2019t inquire further. Dealing with individuals like the Zeroth Order Knights would only lead to unnecessary trouble.\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d\nThe doctor led Nisha to a solitary room on the third floor of the Inner Citadel. As the doctor had stated, the room was completely empty.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Then, abruptly, the small gap above her widened.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nTanya, who had lost her mask, was there.\nShe had wrapped her entire hand in bandages.\nShe was originally supposed to be the patient lying in this room.\n\u201cLady Tanya, I have come to report on the events at the Lorna Palace.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nHer voice, low and restrained, spoke. She was the most peculiar person among the Zeroth Order Knights, Tanya.\n\u201cBut before that, do you happen to know what foxes like?\u201d\n\u201c?\u201d\nAnd she was the only person who genuinely liked animals.\nIn the midst of everything, Nisha didn\u2019t forget to ask about the bribe she would offer to Belle, the Divine Beast.\nIn such an unusual posture, Nisha began her report.\n***\nThe figure outside the open door consisted of two knights from the Zeroth Brigade and the First Brigade, along with a single magician. Rowena\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of the magician.\nEntering the room with a slightly pale face was none other than the magician, Lucel. The eight bracelets jingled and swayed loudly on his wrist.\n\u201cI have the honour of meeting you,\u201d Lucel said.\nThe knights knelt side by side, a gesture of utmost reverence towards the royal figure. Then, even Lucel knelt down.\n\u201cI have no recollection of contacting the Mausoleum,\u201d said Nabel, squinting his eyes. His gaze was fixed on Lucel, who deeply bowed his head.\n\u201cI deeply apologize for meeting you without giving prior notice. However, I thought it better to inform you early, as it pertains to the matter of Genas Miltan\u2026\u201d Lucel\u2019s words trailed off.\nNabel cut him off. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\nThere was no way that the matter concerning Genas Miltan was unrelated to the recent intrusion. Lucel bowed his head once again, this time towards Rowena.\n\u201cI made a mistake in the message I sent to the Lord of Divinities.\u201d\nNabel turned to Rowena. He was aware that she had received a report. The only time Lucel and Rowena had met separately was when she went to the Mausoleum at night.\nShe had declared herself as the Lord of Divinities and the protector of Iber. The report from last night passed through his mind fleetingly.\n\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d Nabel asked.\nRowena had already guessed. The people from the Mausoleum had suspected Genas Miltan as soon as Grand Sorcerer Fel was found dead, with the corpse of a deity beside him. However, Genas Miltan had been found dead as well.\nBut now, Genas Miltan appeared before them, alive and well.\n\u201c\u2026The one who appeared yesterday, it was undoubtedly Genas Miltan. He was undoubtedly someone who couldn\u2019t originally learn magic,\u201d Lucel\u2019s face grew even paler.\n\u201cHowever, the magical power he displayed yesterday far surpassed anything I have ever witnessed.\u201d\nEight bracelets dangled from Lucel\u2019s wrist, signifying the eighth level of sorcerer. The words came from the highest-ranked sorcerer, the guardian of the ninth staircase.\nNabel\u2019s eyes narrowed. The only possible interpretation ways that Genas Miltan possessed power comparable to the owner of a guardian deity.\n\u201c\u2026He obtained a guardian deity\u2026\u201d\nLorna ceased her speech, frozen in motion. Suddenly, she recalled what Nisha had mentioned about Fel\u2019s guardian deity being discovered with its heart exposed.\n\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d\nUnconsciously, Lorna looked down at her own shadow. Perhaps sensing her master\u2019s unease, her pointed ears perked up, and then Belle emerged.\n[Ring]\nResting her face against Lorna\u2019s chest, Belle seemed to be offering comfort.\n\u201cYes. Until you arrived at Mantap, I could not believe it to be true. How could someone abandoned by the gods and imprisoned in the depths of hell acquire a guardian deity\u2019s heart without thinking they would be trapped beneath the floor of hell?\u201d\nLucel bowed deeply.\n\u201cTherefore, I told you it couldn\u2019t be true\u2026 but the situation indicates that Genas Miltan indeed acquired Fel\u2019s guardian deity and took its heart. I do not know how it happened, but I am certain.\u201d\nA human taking a guardian deity\u2019s heart?\n\u201cDoes that mean he possesses such magical power?\u201d\nNabel squinted her eyes. If that were true, it would be a disaster of unparalleled proportions. Throughout the history of the continent, there had never been two guardian deity owners existing simultaneously. It signified an absence of clashes between such powerful magical forces on the continent.\nIf the owner of a guardian deity and another guardian deity owner were to truly clash, not just one palace would be destroyed.\nOf course, the palace could disappear without consequence. The problem was that if he had indeed absorbed a guardian deity\u2019s heart and became a sorcerer rivaling the ninth staircase, there would be no one capable of stopping him other than Lorna.\nHe was more determined than anyone else not to expose Lorna to danger.\n\u201cYes\u2026 but it is not perfect.\u201d\nLucel retrieved something from within his robe. It was charred black.\n\u201cThis was found at the scene. It does not belong to anything that was present at the scene. When subjected to magical power, it crumbled like this.\u201d\nLucel unfolded defensive magic toward Nabel and Lorna, cautiously applying magic to the item he held. In response, the object disintegrated like black ash floating in the air.\n\u201cThis is a trace of magical power, to be precise, a trace left behind by a body unable to withstand the magical power and melting away.\u201d\nLorna stared wide-eyed at the remnants of magical power, which screamed silently like burning scraps of paper.\n\u201cHe did not fully absorb the guardian deity\u2019s heart. If it continues like this, Genas Miltan will not be able to overcome my magical power and will die.\u201d\nLucel looked at the ashes flying toward the sky and spoke. If that were the only news, it would have been a glimmer of hope. There would have been no need for such an urgent journey. However, Lucel\u2019s gaze conveyed that it was not the end.\nIn a heavy voice, he delivered his conclusion.\n\u201cTherefore, he may once again target a guardian deity, possibly aiming to fully absorb its heart.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "83": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-83/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLucel\u2019s report on Genas Miltan was treated as highly confidential.\nThe flow of magic begins in the heart. This was common knowledge even among non-mages.\nHowever, it was evident that if the fact that those who were unable to naturally contain magical power could become mages by taking someone else\u2019s heart became known, it would create significant repercussions.\n\u201cBut\u2026,\u201d Lorna had been listening to the report, and spoke up. All eyes in the room, including the four knights who had been silently listening to the report, turned to her.\nAfter a brief moment of hesitation, Lorna continued.\n\u201cMagic is supposed to be evidence of one\u2019s belief in the gods. How can someone not branded as a heretic not have magical power within them?\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t help but wonder. She had been treated as a heretic or a demon because she didn\u2019t have magical power, even before she had the chance to confirm if magic could be contained within her body.\n\u201cThat too was deemed as divine benevolence,\u201d Lucel replied, bowing his head deeply. Lorna\u2019s eyes widened. Nabel gently held Lorna\u2019s hand.\n\u201cIt is mainly people who are born with weak hearts that are unable to wield magic power effectively.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch individuals would be risking their lives if they were to use magic power.\u201d\nNabel firmly sealed his lips. However, Genas had accomplished that very task\u2014by taking the heart of a deity.\n\u201cFor now, I will ensure that this matter remains undisclosed.\u201d\nLucel said, his head still lowered. A knight from the Zero Order Knights standing nearby raised his hand slightly. Lorna\u2019s eyes widened, turning in that direction. Despite the timidity of the gesture, it was clear that what the Zero Order Knights were about to do was not something one would do in the presence of the lord during a report.\nBut Nabel paid it no mind. The Zero Order Knights were always such individuals.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cAh, well, the rumours have already spread outside.\u201d\nThe knight named Nen\u2019s words lacked a proper structure as well. The knights of the First Order Knights seemed to pale slightly and adjusted their posture. They were principled individuals who knew the wrath of their lord. The actions of the Zero Order Knights were unimaginable in terms of the behaviour expected from the First Order Knights.\n\u201cThere are rumours circulating about a confrontation between the master of the deities and a mage, and that it was the Silver-Haired One.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t good at all. The fact that Genas Miltan couldn\u2019t contain magical power in his body had already become known enough to spread such rumours.\n\u201cAt the very least, make sure the heart aspect doesn\u2019t appear in the rumours. And especially, enforce the restriction on the spreading of the story that he possessed magic power exceeding eight steps.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\nAs soon as the order was given, Nen tried to leave the room. That\u2019s when a knight from the First Order Knights grabbed hold of him.\n\u201cWhy? Where are you going?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t the appropriate way to address someone in the presence of the lord and other esteemed individuals. Lorna, who was slightly bewildered, looked at him. Nen finally regained his composure.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nThe lord, Nabel, was accustomed to such behaviour from the Zero Order Knights. However, the owner of the deities, who was so esteemed in the presence of the lord, was unlikely to be such a person. It was only natural that he would be reprimanded for showing an unbecoming appearance in front of such a Nabel individual.\nSure enough, Nabel\u2019s gaze turned cold.\nNen bowed deeply, unable to suppress the thumping of his heart. The Lord was a relentless pursuer of perfection. Although he showed some flexibility when dealing with the Zero Knights who had been together on the battlefield, it was only to a limited extent, usually when they were aLorna with the Lord.\nThere was no mercy for mistakes made in important positions, just as it had been a year ago when the envoy from the Kingdom of Radia had arrived.\nAt that time, the knight who made a mistake in front of the envoy was no longer in the palace. Moreover, they were permanently banned from setting foot in the palace.\nAbove Nen\u2019s lowered head, Nabel\u2019s voice descended.\n\u201cNisha.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t directed at Nen. Nen\u2019s body froze. He felt a cold sweat trickling down his back.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nIt seemed Nisha had been waiting outside the room. After knocking, Nisha poked her head through the door crack.\n\u201cYou are responsible for managing the rumours. And it would be wise to remind the knights in charge of your protection about their attitudes.\u201d\nHow dare those who protect the Lady leave their posts so easily. Nabel narrowed his eyes.\n\u201cI will do so, Your Grace.\u201d\nNisha bowed deeply. It was as if she had already heard the conversation inside.\n\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s gaze turned back to Nen.\nThat was when warmth enveloped his wrist. This time it was Lorna who took hold of his wrist, as if to say it was alright.\n\u201c\u2026 \u201d\nOnly then did Nabel avert his gaze from Nen. The vigilant knights, sensitive to signs and movements, could not have missed that sight.\nIt was an unbelievable act of mercy. Once again, the knights\u2019 attention turned to the master of the rumours.\nNisha, who had been forced to become the Knight Commander, had specifically mentioned that they should be extremely attentive to the owner of the rumours. If they belonged to the Zero Knights, they had all heard his story.\nBut they didn\u2019t know the reason, and now they seemed to understand.\nThe only person who could melt the perpetually cold Lord.\nPerhaps a precious person who could bring warmth to this palace.\nThe thoughts of the knights in the room were unanimous.

    "84": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-84/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA knight\u2019s mistake was their own fault, and they deserved to be punished accordingly. Showing mercy in such matters was the Lord\u2019s prerogative, and the lower beings dared not question it.\nHowever, whenever such cold words were delivered to the lower beings, reaffirming that there was nothing trustworthy in the world, no one could help but feel sorry for the young Lord, whose heart was once again frozen, as they froze their own hearts.\nA person who could melt the Lord\u2019s frost had appeared.\nNabel. They had no choice but to be Nabel. They were someone who must be protected.\nNen felt more alert than ever.\n\u201cLady.\u201d\nOnce again, from above his head, Nabel\u2019s voice, this time gentle and calm, not a freezing voice but a composed and soft one, dropped down. It astonished the knights.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cIf there are those who are unworthy to serve you, cast them aside without hesitation. There shall be no dissenting voices.\u201d\nThe voice itself was sweet and melodious.\n\u201cThe Zero Knights shall be your hands and feet, and the First Knights shall be your armour. Rumours, objects, or anything else you desire, they shall procure for you.\u201d\nNabel gently brushed the inside of Lorna\u2019s arm.\n\u201cIf there is anything you desire, simply command them. They shall obey and bring forth what you desire.\u201d\nAnd so, she commanded. Nabel whispered.\n\u201cAnything will do. The owner of the divine artifact, the greatest sorcerer, capable of manifesting nearly anything imaginable.\u201d\nLorna nodded slightly. From her shadow, the fox Belle emerged and settled between the two. Nabel spoke softly.\n\u201cConsider them another form of magic. Speak and indulge in whatever you desire.\u201d\nFor that purpose, she had obtained the Throne. Nabel pressed his lips against her forehead.\n\u201cFor example, even regarding those impure souls who failed to recognize you.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened. Nabel chuckled. His fingertips gently brushed over her wide-eyed gaze. The unruly strands of dark pink hair settled calmly beneath his touch.\n\u201cGive the command. We are waiting.\u201d\nSpeak of what we discussed. Tell us what you decided on that fateful night we sent you. Lorna looked at him and the other Zero Knight beside him, Jamil. The two knights of the First Division stood with utmost grace, awaiting her command.\n\u201c\u2026Lady of a Nabel house.\u201d\nShe did not reveal which Nabel house she belonged to, but everyone understood. Lorna couldn\u2019t continue her sentence. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to giving orders.\nIt was easy to issue short commands when she was born and raised as a Nabel. However, she couldn\u2019t fathom what kind of order she should give to those waiting sincerely to obey her.\nMore precisely, she didn\u2019t know what she truly wanted. She couldn\u2019t condense it into a single sentence. She had always learned to let go of her desires first. Erasing one\u2019s desires was the only way to survive in the mansion.\n\u201cLady of the Nabel house, what do you wish to become?\u201d\nNabel led her once again with his soft voice. It felt like emerging slowly into the light.\n\u201cDo you desire to suffer?\u201d\nLorna hesitated. She felt unfamiliar with the inclination to nod. Nabel\u2019s touch near her wrist seemed to ask if he could hold it, if he could read her heart, knocking on it. Lorna turned to look at him.\nAnd without a word, she took his hand.\n\u201cI hope she becomes unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cHow tortuous it is to be left Lorna, does the Countess know?\u201d\nAs her hand gently enclosed the innermost part of his hand, the palm, her deep thoughts, unknown to her, were conveyed directly to Nabel.\nThough Nabel had read it all, he dared not speak it aloud. Instead, he simply led her once again.\n\u201cShall I make you experience the same pain as the lady?\u201d\nLorna turned to him. A fleeting thought passed, wondering if it would be acceptable.\nIt had been the shackles that held her captive her whole life. They bound her hands, tied her ankles, and even constrained her thoughts, keeping her from uttering a single word.\nIt felt like desiring something you shouldn\u2019t desire. A strange sensation of wanting something that couldn\u2019t be fulfilled.\n\u201cName your price.\u201d\nNabel drew her closer, as if pulling her towards the light. Lorna nodded in response.\n\u201cFine.\u201d\nThose few words were enough for now. She would gradually release the shackles that had held her tightly. It was futile to expect anyone else to do it for her.\nAs she had said, her life belonged to her, and she was not an ornament to Nabel.\nNabel was patient enough to wait for her transformation. He pressed his lips against the back of Lorna\u2019s hand.\nThen, he turned to Nisha.\n\u201cSend someone to the mainland. Secretly convey the message to the temple. Let them know that the young lady of the Rida Count\u2019s lineage was, in fact, the owner of Shinsoo.\u201d\nThe Countess had openly persecuted Lorna, branding her as someone rejected by the gods. But now, with rumours spreading throughout the mainland and crossing over to the continent, that past, which had taunted her so, would become her very shackles.\nNabel raised the corners of his mouth and kissed Lorna\u2019s cheek once more.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "85": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-85/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat day, the covert deployment of personnel from the Zero Knights took place. Originally, the Zero Knights were a group that had more external missions than their role as knights.\nAmong them, the majority held various positions in addition to being Zero Knights. The reason why the First Knights tolerated their actions to some extent was precisely because of that.\nThough not everyone openly admitted it, the Zero Knights were essentially closer to spies and operatives than knights.\nAnd among the Zero Knights, there were individuals specialized in creating rumours. The ones deployed this time were also such individuals.\nThey turned their name tags attached to the quarters of the Zero Knight Corps upside down and departed from the continent that day. Since the bridge connecting the continent and the subcontinent of Phinellae was severed, they had to endure a treacherous voyage. Their ability to secure a magician who would assist them in the \u201cZero Knight Corps way\u201d was also part of their expertise.\nThat night, a commotion erupted and subsided at the Martop as they sought the missing magician Leffe, the seventh stair. Of course, it was Nisha who brought up and hushed the commotion.\n\u201cClearly, I thought this kind of trivial matter would be taken care of on their own.\u201d\nEveryone had their reasons to avoid Nisha. Ever since she obtained the position of commander, which she did not originally possess, her additional responsibilities seemed to multiply, leaving her with a furrowed brow. Nevertheless, she made sure that other knights did not suffer. She quelled the rumours and appeased the public, making it appear that the invaded Martop, rather than being attacked, was a place where magicians went berserk while secretly ensuring that no harm befell the knights.\nUnbeknownst to her, every member of the Zero Knights considered it natural for Nisha to become their commander and handle all these matters.\n\u201cThey must be somewhere around here\u2026\u201d\nAnd there he was, someone who came out again to perform duties befitting the commander of the Zero Knights. This time, he was at Avalt Palace for a patronage. It was to meet the deity who occasionally came to enjoy the patronage.\nThe deity usually remained by the side or in the shadow of their owner, but when their owner\u2019s heart was at ease, they occasionally wandered around other places nearby. This information was known to Nisha, a member of the Zero Knights responsible for gathering intelligence.\nOf course, there was no need to worry about the safety of the deity\u2019s owner. As long as the owner had their shadow, the deity, who could rush to protect them in an instant, would be there no matter where they were.\n\u201cAh..there they are.\u201d\nAfter circling around the patronage a couple of times, Nisha finally found what she was looking for. Since it was the deity, there was no trace of a shadow or any other signs, so it took some time to find them with just her eyes.\nHmm?\nAs the fox, Belle, locked eyes with Nisha, he paused, momentarily taken aback. The stiffening of his tail and the slight swipe of his paw across his face unmistakably conveyed his lack of fondness for Nisha.\nIndeed, it seemed he was not fond of her.\nNisha scratched her head, considering that perhaps, for the sake of the owner\u2019s mental well-being, she should have refrained from mentioning how the previous fox had died.\nBut she had explicitly expressed her curiosity, so how could she avoid it?\nThe answer to her curiosity came forth.\n[Creak!]\nIt was undoubtedly a warning. Belle seemed to be saying, \u201cStay away,\u201d as he scraped his paw against the ground. Nisha discreetly pulled out a piece of meat from her pocket.\nIt was the meat of a nozel, a horned, quadrupedal creature that thrived only in the mainland. This wild animal was known to be quite ferocious, with bones that were difficult to pick clean even for seasoned knights, let alone those at the level of the Zeroth Order.\nAnd Nisha had caught and prepared the meat herself.\n\u201cTanya must have said that foxes love this meat.\u201d\nPlease acknowledge my efforts. She held the meat in her hand, placing it a few steps away from Belle. Then, taking a few steps backward herself, she retreated.\n[Sniff, sniff]\nSuspicious gazes briefly flickered over Belle before turning their attention to the meat. Then, with a quick bite, they tasted it.\nRight, correct.\nNisha smiled at the venerable fox.\nI am harmless, indeed.\nInterpreting his smile, Belle met his gaze and finished the meat. Then, without a word, he swiftly turned his head and disappeared into the thicket.\nDid he like it? No, he didn\u2019t? Nisha scratched her head.\nThe last expression Belle had worn was reminiscent of something she had seen before.\n\u201cWhere have I seen it before?\u201d\nAfter much contemplation, she found the answer. It resembled the expression her neighbour\u2019s dog had made when it had eaten subpar food. Nisha was impressed.\nIt seemed she had to find a new bribe.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "86": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-86/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Nisha\u2019s brief stint as a side job enthusiast, Lorna found herself at the Matap. The Matap, a place that frequently welcomed esteemed guests, lavished her with extravagant treatment every time she visited, to the point of making her feel uncomfortably cherished.\n\u201cMay I ascend to the ninth floor of the tower?\u201d\nHer question was self-evident, requiring no answer. The owner of the shingles, after all, was the owner of the ninth staircase. The entire tower belonged to her, and naturally, the ninth floor was her own exclusive domain.\n\u201cOf course, you may.\u201d\nFive individuals followed closely behind her. The magician who offered to guide them tagged along, somewhat eagerly.\n\u201cThe view outside is truly splendid.\u201d\nLin walked beside her, just a stone\u2019s throw away. It seemed as though they were walking side by side, in a surprisingly intimate proximity. Four knights trailed silently behind them, their steps so soundless that one might not even notice them unless they turned around.\n\u201cOut here, you mentioned there was a forest.\u201d\n\u201cA forest?\u201d\nLin\u2019s eyes widened, and Lorna nodded in confirmation.\n\u201cI saw it during the Tower\u2019s trial. A forest spreading like the sea.\u201d\nIt was genuinely vast. The striking sight of emerald leaves swaying in one direction whenever the wind blew made a lasting impression.\nHowever, Lin tilted her head.\n\u201cI heard it was located in the eastern part of the continent, not here.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\nLorna turned to look at her. Lin furrowed her brow again.\n\u201cI must have been mistaken.\u201d\nAt that moment, the zeroth knight standing behind them suddenly spoke up.\n\u201cUm.\u201d\nHis voice was uncharacteristically timid for a zeroth knight. Lorna and Lin turned to face him. With his hand partially raised, Jamil cautiously asked.\n\u201c\u2026May I offer an explanation?\u201d\nHe seemed more like a travel guide than a knight. Witnessing his demeanour, the first knight, Lenok, and Milisha exchanged exasperated sighs.\nLorna, who had briefly widened her eyes, nodded slightly.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. That forest is created artificially\u201d\nWhat did he just say? Lorna\u2019s eyes widened significantly. Such a massive forest? Why? The only thing that sprouted in her mind were questions. In response, Jamil proudly declared.\n\u201cYou were instructed to show it to the owner of the shingles. It was a command from our Lord.\u201d\nLorna blinked. Nabel ordered that? To create such a forest?\n\u201cYes. Someone desires to see a forest akin to the sea,\u201d Nabel continued.\nAs he spoke those words, his cold gaze sank, resembling a falsehood. Unless one possessed the ability to read the truth like the snow-white Iber with his discerning hands, one wouldn\u2019t know what he was thinking when he issued the command. Lorna assumed it was merely a misconception, an incorrect interpretation of his momentary gaze, while following his orders.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case. In the presence of our Lord, he truly melts like no other person does. He bowed deeply.\nI unknowingly made a slip of the tongue.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna turned to face Lin, who responded with an embarrassed smile. She leaned in, bringing her index finger to her lips, and whispered.\n\u201cI think I accidentally opened a surprise gift.\u201d\n\u201cI know of a sea-like forest.\u201d\nNabel said that before we set off for the mainland. Lorna burst into laughter. It seemed as though Nabel had created something small and sweet, like a slice of cake.\nDid you long for me to bring you here this much?\nAs much as you wanted to see me.\nHer clear laughter resounded throughout the top of the tower. Unbeknownst to Lorna, it was a laughter sweeter and lighter than any she had ever emitted since arriving on the mainland.\n***\nLorna had no particular reason to visit the ninth floor of the tower. It was simply because she felt it would be inconvenient to Nabel properly explore the domain of the owner of the Divine Beast.\nHowever, it held a different significance for the sorcerers of Matop.\nThe true master of Matop had returned.\nAnd it brought to mind the tradition that had been quickly forgotten by people after the death of the Archmage Fel.\n\u201cThe Festival Hall?\u201d\nSo Lorna heard about the tradition that night. As she finished her work and Nabel spoke those words, Lorna\u2019s eyes widened.\nNabel lightly kissed her forehead. Lorna\u2019s body, sitting on the bed, swayed slightly under his weight. Nabel chuckled softly and sat beside her.\nI heard you\u2019ve been wandering around the palace all day. I had no intention of bothering you when you were tired. That\u2019s why I only kissed the tip of your finger. His strong hand supported her wrist. A soft, sweet sound echoed through the bedroom.\n\u201cYes. If you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to, Your Highness.\u201d\nWho would dare resist the owner of the Divine Beast? He whispered those words.\n\u201cAlthough Dongdae-ryuk was unaware of the existence of the Divine Beast\u2019s owner, the tradition has been carried on in the western continent\u2019s temples. When a new owner of the Divine Beast appears, it is customary to distribute magical stones imbued with the Divine Beast\u2019s magic to all the temples in the western continent. It is a symbol of harmony, in a way.\u201d\n\u201cMagical stones?\u201d\nNabel nodded briefly.\n\u201cYes. Belle should know how to make them.\u201d\nArchmage Fel didn\u2019t know magic, but he was able to create magical stones. As if responding to his unspoken answer, Lorna\u2019s shadow deepened and then returned.\n\u201cThe problem is that the event takes place at Matap\u2026 Many would be eager to witness the miracles performed by the owner of the Divine Beast.\u201d\nNabel narrowed his eyes. It was a situation that he did not find favourable. But there was no better event to solidify the position of the Divine Beast\u2019s owner.\nSo the choice was up to Lorna.\n\u201cI will minimize the risks, but\u2026\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. He wanted to assure her that it was safe, that there was no danger, but he had a history.\n\u201c-I should have come here after thoroughly cleaning up and gone to you, Your Highness.\u201d\nRegret that haunted her several times a day. Lorna slightly lowered her head.\nHe came at the perfect time. If he had been even a little later, she would have been captured by those who claimed to be inquisitors.\n\u201cShould I postpone the Festival Hall until the palace is cleaned up?\u201d\nConsidering the incident where Matop almost collapsed, even the temple sorcerers had no grounds to object. However, Lorna shook her head.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nIt would be safer to hold the grand event now. If what Lukel said was true, Genas Milthan hadn\u2019t fully absorbed the power of the Divine Beast, and the traces of his displayed magic indicated that his physical condition was poor.\nIt would be better to hold the event while his power was weakened. Lorna wiped his cheek.\n\u201cNow is good.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Then, I shall prepare immediately, Your Highness.\u201d\nNabel kissed the inside of Lorna\u2019s hand, which was covering his cheek.

    "87": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-87/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon, madam.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened at the low voice. The hand resting on top of her head felt warm.\nNabel slid his fingertips through the dense pink strands of her hair. As he reached the end, his movement came to a halt.\n\u201cI had something to give you once this place became stable, but it has disappeared.\u201d\nThe bride\u2019s tiara.\nHe spoke in a hushed tone.Lorna tilted her head slightly.\nGiven that Nabel was personally planning to present it to her and the word \u201cbride\u201d was attached to its name, it was undoubtedly a precious item.\nIt was likely a possession of the royal family, in all probability.\n\u201cIt vanished?\u201d\n\u201cYes. We thoroughly searched the palace, but it did not turn up. It is a magical object, so we are even conducting searches in the towers\u2026 But because of that, it seems it will be postponed for a while.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nNabel brought his face so close toLorna\u2019s that it almost touched the tip of her nose. He whispered, seemingly embarrassed.\n\u201cOur wedding.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nWith his low voice, a warm breath scorchedLorna\u2019s neck. She tried to lean her slightly flushed face away.\nBut Nabel\u2019s hand prevented her. His powerful hand was wrapped around the nape of her neck.\nAs if telling her not to move away from him. As if asking her to listen to his story like this.\nIt was a hand that could be pushed away if she wanted to. However,Lorna didn\u2019t insist on escaping from his grasp.\n\u201cA royal betrothal requires the bride\u2019s tiara. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the bride to utilize the facilities within the palace.\u201d\nHis eyes narrowed. There seemed to be tension in the hand that held the end of her hair. If what was caught at his fingertips wasn\u2019t a strand of hair but a fragile object, it could have been damaged. However, it only reached the tips of his fingers. His touch that swept awayLorna\u2019s hair was gentle.\n\u201cWhen did it disappear?\u201d Lorna asked in a hushed voice, sensing something amiss.\nOne who was worthy of stealing from the Hwangga, someone with an adversarial relationship with the Ivor Hwangga and enough power to do so.\nIt had only been a short while since Genas Miltan infiltrated the palace.\n\u201cOn the day Genesis Miltan came,\u201d he replied.\nSure enough, it was him. Lorna\u2019s lips pressed together firmly.\n\u201cTruly, we should have made this palace more secure to protect you,\u201d she said with a voice tinged with regret, the words dispersing between the two of them. Nabel closed his eyes.\n\u201cWas the official in Lorna\u2019s palace?\u201d\nAt her question, Nabel slightly nodded, gesturing with his hand towards the ground.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s in Abalt Palace.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened. So now they were both in the place that had been breached by the enemy. Nabel gently kissed the ends of her hair.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Unless the opponent is a wizard, this is the safest place.\u201d\nAnd that scoundrel is currently powerless and on the verge of collapse.\nIt was clear that they had dispatched forces to track us openly, yet there was no significant reaction. Moreover, they didn\u2019t even leave a trace of my dying body in Lorna\u2019s palace.\n\u201cNevertheless, we will be moving soon. I ordered them to clean the main palace completely.\u201d\nThe word \u201cclean\u201d that came out of Nabel\u2019s mouth sounded mundane. However, its meaning was far from light. Lorna lowered her gaze slightly.\n\u201cMistress.\u201d\nAs she did, Nabel followed her gaze. The edge of his chin was cradled by gentle fingertips. With his right hand supporting the bed, he cautiously reached out with his left hand.\nAlthough his gesture was gentle, his hand was filled with anguish.\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\nCompared to his right hand, his left hand had an unusually high number of wounds. When she pulled up his sleeve, it became even more apparent in the bright light.\nAs if someone had targeted his left arm with concentrated attacks, it seemed painful just to look at the wounds layered upon wounds.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\nWithout realizing it, Lorna grabbed Nabel\u2019s left arm. And in that moment, Nabel flinched as if he was about to push her away.\nOf course, he didn\u2019t actually push her away, and it was just a momentary reaction, but Lorna could clearly sense it.\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not the pain\u2026\u201d\nNabel chuckled softly. He carefully let go of Lorna\u2019s hand, as if dropping it from a dirty place, and wiped it with the edge of his clothing.\n\u201cThey\u2019re healed wounds. Don\u2019t worry about them. More importantly\u2026\u201d\nEach time I cause you to worry like this\u2026 Nabel covered her cheeks with both hands.\n\u201cMistress, please don\u2019t worry. The relocated main palace will be safe.\u201d\nEven a tyrant needed a minimum of justification. And that justification was overflowing due to the incident where Matap nearly collapsed and the infiltration of Genesis Miltan.\nThanks to that, I was able to expel all the spies in the main palace that I couldn\u2019t handle before due to the lack of justification.\n\u201cI will create a magical barrier there again.\u201d\nLorna held his hand that was resting on her cheek. Nabel raised his head.\n\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself. There are many other magical devices in the main palace, so it might be a bit difficult.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless, I will do it.\u201d\nAn undeniable, strong statement was uttered.\n\u201cAs the master of the divine being who protects the IberHwangga and you, I must.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Unable to withstand the weakened ground, the palace itself collapsed. It was during the day when Lorna received the news.\n\u201cCompletely collapsed?\u201d she inquired.\n\u201cYes. It is said that even among the buildings in the palace, this particular one was constructed to be exceptionally sturdy,\u201d replied Nen, the Zero Knight who accompanied her. Lin, who had conveyed the news, turned her perplexed face towards the window overlooking Lorna\u2019s palace.\n\u201cThey\u2019re checking if anyone got injured. It seems that some of the sorcerers who were conducting research were inside.\u201d\n\u201cGoodness\u2026\u201d\nLorna turned to look out the window, following her. Then, a sudden thought crossed her mind, causing her eyes to widen.\nThose inside were not only sorcerers. Nabel had mentioned that he had eyes and ears throughout the palace. It referred not only to spies but also to Nabel\u2019s loyal servants.\nFor example, someone introduced her to Nabel before.\nLorna distinctly remembered the person who had fallen from the shadows. Amidst the clash of powerful magic that distorted the surroundings, that person had shouted at her to escape from this place, wielding only a sword.\n\u201cIs that person alright?\u201d Lorna glanced at the knights and Lin.\n\u201cThe person who defended against Genas\u2019 invasion. That\u2026\u201d\nHow should she describe them?\nIn Lorna\u2019s eyes, that person didn\u2019t appear to be a knight. The knights she knew were individuals who protected their masters\u2019 lives and honour under the bright sun.\nBut that person was in the shadows.\n\u201cDo you mean Tanya, my lady?\u201d Jamil of the Zeroth Knight cautiously responded. Lorna tilted her head slightly. She didn\u2019t recall being introduced to that name.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the person who guarded the vicinity of the Divine Beast\u2019s owner within Lorna Palace, then you\u2019re probably correct.\u201d\nBeside him, Knight Nen interjected.\n\u201cHidden, you mean.\u201d\nAdding a brief remark, it was truly befitting of the Zero Knight. The knights of the First Knight Division beside them rolled their eyes in discomfort.\nOf course, Lorna paid them little mind. She was more concerned about this knight named Tanya.\nA knight\u2026 The name Tanya echoed in Lorna\u2019s mind, causing her to rise to her feet.\n\u201cAt that time, it seemed like they were seriously injured. Can I possibly go and see them?\u201d\nThere was nothing Lorna couldn\u2019t do. After all, the distance between Lorna Palace and Avante Palace, where Tanya supposedly was, wasn\u2019t that far.\nThe problem was that even the members of the Zeroth Knight Division didn\u2019t know if Tanya was confined to a sickroom.\n\u201cOf course. But\u2026\u201d\nNen hesitated, pondering how to convey the fact. Then, he lowered his head.\n\u201cI shall inform the owner of the Divine Beast that you\u2019re going.\u201d\nNen and Jamil exchanged glances. Their gaze conveyed the question of whether they knew where Tanya had gone. However, both of them failed to find the answer and instead sent a fervent telepathic message to Tanya.\nNevertheless, since you\u2019re an unwavering leader, you\u2019ll be in the sickroom, won\u2019t you? Right?\n***\nJira Palace welcomed the distinguished guest.\n\u201cThe owner of the divine beast coming to such a place. There are many areas where our preparations are lacking.\u201d\nNadi, the manager and physician of Jira Palace, was overwhelmed with awe when the owner of the divine beast arrived. The healers in Jira Palace were akin to magical physicians who used the power of the gods to mend wounds, and Nadi was no exception.\nWherever you went, there were always those who felt ashamed to showcase their inadequate magic skills before the owner of the divine beast, who was nothing short of the master of the ninth stairway.\n\u201cIf only it wouldn\u2019t disrupt the treatment..\u201d\nLorna pondered with a perplexed expression as she observed Jira Palace.\nThe interior of Jira Palace was permeated with a potent herbal scent. The hot air, as if simmering something, seemed to caress her face.\nAnd she was receiving more attention from people than she had anticipated.\nWell, it was only natural.\nHaving only heard rumours about the owner of the divine beast while receiving treatment in Jira Palace, people who hadn\u2019t actually seen her were now sending curious glances her way. Even the first knights behind Lorna were gradually sinking under the piercing stares, signalling with their eyes.\n\u201cDisruption? I hardly think so. Everyone is delighted to have the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the divine beast\u2019s owner from afar.\u201d\nIt seemed like an empty statement, but Lorna managed a wry smile nonetheless.\nShe always acted as if she didn\u2019t exist, receiving no recognition or acknowledgment whatsoever. She had even been treated as if she were absent. People would casually gossip about her as if she weren\u2019t there.\nBut not now. This was a moment of everyone\u2019s attention.\nIt was burdensome, yet a peculiar feeling.\n\u201cI present to you, the owner of the divine beast, the noble child of the gods.\u201d\nThere were people praying along the way, surely directing their prayers toward the divine being.\nAs Lorna was guided to Tanya\u2019s room, she cast her gaze toward the people who were praying. They were likely praying for that divine presence.\nThere were people with broken legs leaning on crutches, others with large wounds on their arms, and those with blindfolds over their eyes. The lower floors of Jira Palace were primarily occupied by individuals with limited mobility.\nThey were also the ones who required longer treatment.\n\u201cAre these people here because they were injured during their duties in the palace?\u201d\nNadi guides Lorna to Tanya\u2019s ward, nodding slightly.\n\u201cYes, primarily knights and soldiers responsible for palace security. Especially those who were injured during the recent intrusion by Genas Miltan. There are quite a few of them.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna clamped her lips shut. She had anticipated that there would be many casualties, given the magnitude of the powerful magic that had collided with the building, almost causing its demolition.\nHowever, she had not expected it to be this severe. Even Lorna, who was visiting Jira Palace for the first time, it appeared that there were more patients than usual. The sight of people scattered throughout the expansive palace corridors made it seem intricate and complex.\n\u201cLorna?\u201d\nHer steps came to a halt, and the footsteps of the four knights and Lin, who had been following behind her, naturally ceased as well. Nadi turned to Lorna with a perplexed expression on her face.\n\u201cIs there anything troubling you, my lady?\u201d\nLorna briefly nodded her head.\nIf there is anything troubling, it is not with me, but with them.\nLorna bowed her head. Just as she was about to reach down and touch the filthy floor with her own hands, Lin called out to her.\nWith her body fully bowed, Lorna caressed her own shadow.\n\u201cBelle.\u201d\nIt felt like the first time she had called her of her own accord, Lorna thought.\nMore precisely, it was truly the first time she had willingly called Belle using the power of the Shinsu owner. Belle had always appeared on her own, reading her mind, but not today.\nThis is what she wanted. She was unsure if it was acceptable to take matters into her own hands like this. A fleeting hesitation lingered briefly, but she still wanted to do it.\nIt was an impulse.\n\u201cBelle, please treat the people in this building.\u201d\nOf course, she needed to exercise restraint and avoid using powerful magic that could potentially cause another collapse, as she had done when restoring the tower. So, she needed to moderate it.\nAs if reading her thoughts, Belle, who had met her gaze, stepped forward with four feet touching the ground.\n[Ching!]\nThe formation of the magic circle happened in an instant. A deep pink light, reminiscent of Lorna\u2019s hair, flashed and ascended towards the ceiling.\nAlthough the people within Jira Palace were unaware, a massive pink magic circle appeared directly above the sky of Jira Palace.\n[Thud!]\nA mighty surge of magic enveloped Jira Palace.\nSimultaneously, a pink flash appeared at the injured parts of the people within Jira Palace.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "89": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-89/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTanya, a knight belonging to the Zero Brigade.\n\u201cKnight\u2026\u201d\nShe whispered in a voice so soft that it would never reach anyone else\u2019s ears.\nBeing accustomed to silently treading the small space above the bright walls rather than the floor, she was once again up on the ceiling today.\nIndeed, she had long familiarized herself with the layout of the palace. The walls of this building were all illuminated by the magical power emanating from a single magic stone, connecting them all.\nThanks to that, there were small paths on the ceiling. While ordinary people would struggle to move properly in a place like this and their footsteps would echo, Tanya was different.\nShe had spent more time traversing the ceiling and walls than stepping on the floor, and she had spent more time hiding in the shadows than being out in the open.\nNot very knight-like behaviour.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nTanya\u2019s gaze shifted to the new master.\n\u201cStarting today, you will be excluded from my escort duties.\u201d\nNabel Iber was Tanya\u2019s second master. If he truly served, he could also be considered her first master. That was why Tanya thought she had been removed from escort duty due to her own inadequacy.\n\u201cI serve Lady Lorna, the mistress of the Lorna\u2019s Palace, more devotedly than anyone, even you.\u201d\nShe was certain of those words.\nI was an unworthy person to serve Blanc Iber in the first place.\nThough it saddened her, she accepted it with gladness. Even though she could no longer serve her lord, at least her life was spared.\nIt was an uncommon mercy bestowed by a lord who showed no mercy for mistakes.\nSo, Tanya constantly reflected on her actions, replaying them in her mind, trying to figure out what she had done wrong.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHowever, the lord\u2019s command was the opposite of what she had thought. She only realized it when she personally observed the owner of the rumoured deity.\nMore precisely, she felt it by seeing how the lord treated that person. It seemed like the lord cherished that person more than himself.\n\u201cLeave this place!\u201d\nShe shouted like that, and it was sincere.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nTanya tightly sealed her lips.\nOne should not indulge in personal opinions when dwelling in the shadows. There was nothing more foolish than getting lost in contemplation and failing to notice the danger to one\u2019s master.\nBut an odd feeling kept creeping up on her.\nShe didn\u2019t know what it was.\nAt least it wasn\u2019t the feeling she had when she received instructions from her first master and father, the Duke of Elgia.\nThe things the Duke of Elgia gave Tanya were orders that became increasingly impossible to fulfill as time went on, along with humiliation and abuse.\nIt was a strange and muddled feeling.\nShe knew that one should not indulge in contemplation when dwelling in the shadows, yet that feeling inexplicably stirred her mind, making her restless.\nAnd perhaps because of that, she made an uncharacteristic mistake.\n\u201c\u2015Belle, treat the people in this building.\u201d\nUpon hearing those words, I inadvertently stomped on the ceiling, causing it to emit a loud noise. Fortunately, the ceiling didn\u2019t break, but the knight escorts who guarded the deity\u2019s owner must have heard it.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nIt was a grave mistake.\nMy body reacted without my knowledge.\nIf it had been a few years ago, she would have been confined to a room, devoid of light and without a single meal for over ten days.\nAfter all, the Duke of Elgia had tried to bury her in the shadows every time she made a mistake.\nIt was a torment she didn\u2019t even want to recall.\nTanya fled to the infirmary, as if running away.\n***\n\u201cAre you awake?\u201d\nIt was about ten minutes after Lorna arrived at Tanya\u2019s hospital room. The patients inside the building had all returned to their respective rooms.\nBelle granted her wish immediately.\nThe bright pink enchantment on the magical circle spread across Jira Palace and quickly affected everyone inside. However, unlike the flickering light, it didn\u2019t instantly heal all their wounds.\nNo one was disappointed by that fact. At least the pain had noticeably vanished, and they no longer needed painkillers.\n\u201cEven Archmage Fel himself suffered for several days after using such powerful magic\u2026\u201d\nFortunately, there were those in Jira Palace who remembered Archmage Fel and the spirits.\nEven if the owner of a spirit didn\u2019t use magic directly, using the spirit\u2019s power was still a drain on the owner\u2019s strength.\nSuch immense magic inevitably came with limitations. Just like when the previous owner of the great spirit raised the tower.\n\u201cThey said you fainted on the spot back then\u2026\u201d\nThose who knew that rumour were actually more concerned about Lorna. The owner of a spirit wasn\u2019t the most beloved child of the gods or an all-powerful deity.\nIt was already not long since the last time she used such large-scale magic, so the fact that she had used it again was a miracle in itself.\n\u201cLorna!\u201d\nOf course, this miracle was evident in other palaces as well.\nDuring a council meeting, when Nabel received a report on the massive magical circle incident in Jira Palace, he immediately sent Nisha.\nAlong with the message that she would soon visit Jira Palace.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\nSurprised, Nisha\u2019s face turned pale.\nHe was the one who took more than ten minutes for Lorna to visit Tanya\u2019s room on the third floor.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Nothing happened.\u201d\nStill, as Nisha couldn\u2019t calm down, Lorna smiled.\n\u201cI only treated the people. I didn\u2019t exert as much power as last time.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTell Nabel to meet me tonight.\u201d\nLorna spoke softly.\nOf course, Nisha, being a skilled knight, couldn\u2019t fail to hear that.\nWith a relieved expression, he glanced at her bodyguards. His gaze fell particularly intensely on Nen and Jamil, who belonged to the Zero Knight Division.\nIt was a look that asked why they hadn\u2019t stopped the spirit\u2019s owner from doing something dangerous.\nNen and Jamil both looked away, feigning ignorance. It meant they knew nothing. It was a typical response from members of the Zero Knight Division.\nDamn those guys!\nNisha clenched her fists tightly and lowered her head.\n\u201cI humbly accept.\u201d\nOnce Nisha left, Lorna could finally knock on Tanya\u2019s room door.\n\u201cTanya?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

There was no trace of acknowledgement from her.\n\u201c\u2026 Have you stepped out?\u201d\nNen and Jamil faced each other.\nTanya was an introverted individual who neither spoke nor interacted with others. However, she was faithfully obedient when it came to following orders. That\u2019s why she had been able to stay with the Zero Knights.\n\u201cThe master of the shrine said they would come to see you in advance. You couldn\u2019t possibly be absent from your own room.\u201d\nThat was what they believed at the time. Thud, the door opened.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nIt was Tanya who had opened the door herself. She awkwardly greeted Lorna with a noticeable tension on her face as she loosened the bandage on her right hand.\n\u201c\u2026 I am honoured to meet you.\u201d\nAfter a long silence, her voice sounded somewhat hoarse.\nTanya extended a greeting and stepped back into the room. Lorna, wearing a remorseful expression, entered the room after observing the bandage wrapped around her arm.\nFortunately, the wounds visible inside the partially unravelled bandage did not appear to be too severe.\nIt seemed that Belle\u2019s magic had also reached Tanya.\n\u201cYou can lie down if you wish.\u201d\nLorna said with a remorseful face. He had not come to help her get up. He simply believed it was natural to pay a visit to someone who had been injured while protecting him.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nTanya\u2019s words were cut short. Her voice remained restrained.\nLorna tilted his head slightly, puzzled. As Tanya seemed curious, she lowered her head even further.\n\u201cPlease, punish me.\u201d\nHer sudden statement still carried the same restrained tone. Rather than abruptly interrupting the conversation, it seemed more like she struggled to articulate her words.\nNen cautiously intervened.\n\u201cIt seems like she is confessing her sin of not properly escorting you in Lorna Palace.\u201d\nThat was partly expected.\nIn the Zero Knights, Nisha was the only one who could properly interpret Tanya\u2019s words(?).\nFortunately, it seemed to be the right answer. Tanya deeply bowed her head, motionless, waiting for Lorna\u2019s response.\n\u201cAt that time, Tanya did her job more than enough.\u201d\nIt was only natural since she had faced off against a mage who could melt everything in the room with a single gesture, while wielding a single sword. In fact, if Tanya had not appeared, Lorna might have panicked and called Bell even later.\nTanya replied long after the conversation had ended.\n\u201c\u2026There are more competent knights.\u201d\nHer gaze was directed towards Nen and Jamil. It seemed like there were many missing details in her words.\nLorna tilted his head slightly.\nTanya was innocent, but nevertheless, she believed that she had failed to properly protect Lorna Palace. She had not fulfilled her role as a shadow protecting the target.\nIf her statement was addressed to the knights who stood before her, it would mean that she was saying they were more competent and capable of providing protection.\nLorna smiled softly.\n\u201cI know. Nabel thought the same. Both the First and Zero Knights are individuals we can trust.\u201d\nThe five knights in the room deeply bowed their heads. Hearing their master\u2019s evaluation through someone else\u2019s words was exceptionally special.\n\u201cI will continue to rely on you, Tanya.\u201d\nHer words were nothing less than a request for her to continue protecting him. Nabel had selected two knights each from the First and Zero Knights to act as his escorts, but he had never mentioned removing Tanya from her post.\nSo, this decision was entirely hers. Tanya widened her eyes.\n\u201cI\u2026 \u201d\nHer voice grew dull once again. Lorna gently pressed his hand against Tanya\u2019s shoulder as she tried to move her injured arm.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nTanya\u2019s body stiffened.\nShe seemed like a person who had fallen into an ambush. However, despite being rigid, she did not dare push Lorna away. Instead, she simply lowered her head, unable to sort out her tangled thoughts.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna did not realize that this was the second act of mercy in Tanya\u2019s life.\n***\nFatigued, Lorna pondered while facing the soft rays of daylight. Though she had exerted her control over magic, even summoning a sFel large enough to envelop an entire building, it was only natural for exhaustion to follow.\n\u201cShall we take a shortcut?\u201d Jamil cautiously suggested to her. A faint smile appeared on Lorna\u2019s face.\n\u201cIs there a shortcut?\u201d\n\u201cYes, indeed. We wouldn\u2019t want esteemed individuals like yourself to be walking under the scorching sun,\u201d Jamil replied.\nThere were secret passages within the palace. Of course, they were inaccessible to ordinary people. Only a select few, restricted by the royal family, could enter those passages.\nHowever, if one were the owner of a magical creature, there would be no issue.\nWith that thought in mind, Jamil guided Lorna toward a passageway that led to the Avault Palace. It was one of the secret routes established by Fel, the former master of the mystical creatures.\nEven Fel had freely utilized that passage during his lifetime, and it was a route that Nabel had used a few times as well.\n\u201cHere we are.\u201d\nJamil gestured toward the passageway.\nThe place he led her to was not far from Zira Palace, nestled within a lush grove. As they approached the vicinity of the peculiarly arched foliage, their surroundings shimmered, revealing a cave-like passage.\nIt had been concealed by magic.\nIn awe, Lorna widened her eyes and took a step forward.\n[Crackle!]\nIt was at that moment that sparks ignited, shooting up into the air.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Jamil, almost simultaneously, stood in her way.\nIt didn\u2019t hurt.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\nLorna reached out her hand again. Jamil, realizing his mistake, lowered his head with a wince.\n\u201cIt seems that you still haven\u2019t been granted passage, Lady Lorna.\u201d\nNaturally, as the owner of a divine beast, Lorna expected to be treated similarly to the figures of the royal family and granted access to the passage within the palace. Jamil\u2019s face turned pale.\nIt was clearly his mistake. He had almost put the esteemed individual in danger.\n\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\nLorna finally nodded slowly. So, what Nabel had mentioned was something like this.\nShe had to marry with the crown and wear the bridal crown in order to use the palace passage.\nAlthough it was a passage created by Fel, who was also a divine beast owner, Lorna still couldn\u2019t use it. More precisely, Fel had designed it to allow only figures from the royal family to pass through, without considering other divine beast owners. Unless it was Fel himself, no one could know that fact.\n\u201c\u2026I apologize, Lady Lorna.\u201d\nJamil knelt down on one knee, his once vibrant face lowered beneath her knees. Lorna raised her head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\nLorna raised her head. It was a thought that had barely grazed her mind. While gesturing to Jamil to stand up, she fell into deep contemplation.\nA strange bitterness filled her mouth, followed by a familiar sensation that engulfed her mind.\nIt\u2019s my fault for not remembering even though Nabel had already told me.\n\u201cPlease, punish me.\u201d\nJamil pleaded for punishment once again, not showing the composure of a member of the Zero Knights, but Lorna shook her head.\nIt\u2019s my fault.\nThat\u2019s what she instinctively thought.\n\u201cYou can go back\u2026 It\u2019s a good day anyway.\u201d\nLorna looked up at the sky. The unusually clear sky had not a single cloud.\nEven on a beautiful day, her mood sank. Lorna gazed at the sky, and only then did she recognize the familiar feeling.\nThe feeling of not being welcome was familiar.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe longed to see Nabel.\n***\nLorna stood on the balcony that night. The moon, veiled by thick clouds, contrasted with the clear weather of the day. Despite Lin\u2019s insistence on bringing a lantern, Lorna stood aLorna on the balcony.\n\u201cThe weather is cold, my lady.\u201d\nAt this point, it was more appropriate to address Lorna with a far more esteemed title. There was a title used to address the highest-ranking individual in the temple, the owner of the deity. However, that was a title reserved for deep within the temple.\nThus, Lorna was often called by her name. Whether in the past or the present, the only person who referred to her as \u201cmy lady\u201d was Lin.\nLorna smiled faintly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s not that cold.\u201d\nNevertheless, Lin draped a blanket over her shoulders.\n\u201cIf your excellency were to catch a cold, His Majesty would also be saddened.\u201d\nLin had been by Lorna\u2019s side for a long time. It meant someone who knew how to gently manipulate her. Lorna smiled, seemingly conceding defeat. She wrapped the blanket around her shoulders.\n\u201cIs it because of the events of the day?\u201d\nLin cautiously asked. Lorna didn\u2019t explicitly deny it. It was the right time.\n\u201cWhat happened during the day?\u201d\nA voice suddenly emanated from one side of the balcony. It came from the neighbouring balcony. When Lorna turned around, she saw Navel a short distance away.\nBeside him, Nisha held a lantern, greeting Lorna with a slightly embarrassed expression. Navel leaned against the railing, grinning.\n\u201cIt was nothing. Just\u2026\u201d\nNavel tilted his head slightly.\nLorna suddenly felt embarrassed about bringing up the earlier conversation. Navel had already informed her that he wouldn\u2019t be able to use the main passage. He had also promised to quickly bring the bride\u2019s crown. It wouldn\u2019t do any good to bring up the events of the day now. It would only rekindle the unsettling feeling within her.\nBesides, there was no point in talking about it.\n\u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d\nLorna finally mustered her courage to speak her mind. What she uttered was, in fact, the truth.\nNavel narrowed his eyes for a moment, then smiled lightly.\n\u201cYou were lonely.\u201d\nNavel\u2019s words pricked Lorna\u2019s heart.\nYes, she was lonely. That\u2019s why she wanted to see him so desperately.\nI longed for you, who had no reason to reject me here. I yearned for you with an intensity that was unbearable.\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\nA gentle voice resonated through the night. Lin, who had tidied up the blanket around Lorna\u2019s shoulders, whispered softly to her.\n\u201cJust a moment, I\u2019ll bring you something to drink.\u201d\nThen she glanced at Nisha once and went inside the room. It was her way of discreetly excusing herself. Navel briefly looked back at Nisha.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNisha, the solemn one, also left her seat. Now, only two remained on the balcony.\n\u201cPlease, tell me, sister. Whatever trivial matter it may be.\u201d\nTap, tap, the sound of the balcony railing echoed through the serene night, curiously caressing Lorna\u2019s heart.\n\u201cDuring my absence, reveal to me what transpired in your life, the matters unbeknownst to me.\u201d\nEven the smallest fragment, if it is something you have inquired about, I desire it.\nNabel\u2019s soft voice resonated between them.\nEventually, Lorna opened her mouth.\n\u201cDuring the day\u2026\u201d\nThere was nothing extraordinary that occurred. She merely tended to the people in the palace, met with Tanya, and returned. The lingering feeling in her heart was the inability to use the royal passage on her way back.\nAlthough Nabel had already heard this information through the Zero Knights, he listened attentively to her story as if hearing it for the first time. What mattered to him was not the reports of others but the emotions Lorna had felt.\n\u201c\u2014That\u2019s all.\u201d\nOnce spoken, it truly amounted to nothing. It felt unusually melancholic. Nabel tapped the balcony railing a few more times before suddenly climbing on top of it.\n\u201cNabel?\u201d\nHe leaped down and stood inside the balcony where Lorna was.\n\u201cI understand your melancholy.\u201d\nNabel did not belittle Lorna\u2019s trivial matter. Instead, he embraced her and whispered softly.\n\u201cSister, from now on, feel free to act and be yourself in such places.\u201d\nDo what you desire. His hand tapped Lorna\u2019s back.\n\u201cIf you wish to use the passage, then simply pass through it. Even if it is enchanted by the Archmage Pell, there is no magic that you cannot break unless you are absent from this world.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nSuch a method existed. Lorna paused. Nabel smiled.\n\u201cHope. Embrace it wholeheartedly. If you want more comfort, how about this instead?\u201d\nNabel thought of Pell, the owner of the legendary beast he had seen when he was young.\nThe person who handled the mythical creatures more freely. The one who taught him that there were more things possible with magic than he had imagined, while being a friend of his lion-shaped mythical beast.\nThe one who broadened the horizons of all sorcerers.\nThat was why he knew what a mythical beast\u2019s owner could do. Bending down, he lightly tapped Lorna\u2019s shadow.\nWhat does Bell want to see? Responding to Lorna\u2019s curious mind, Bell emerged from the shadow.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Those knights at the secluded Rida Manor, whom Lorna barely trusted, would have never experienced such tenderness. Even if they attempted to touch it, their hands would only brush through empty air.\nWhile gazing at the bell, Nabel spoke.\n\u201cI wish to return to the room.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cNot just by taking a shortcut, but directly coming back here.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment.\nShe knew such magic existed. However, it was an advanced form of sorcery that only a small number of magicians possessed. Furthermore, she herself had only recently started using magic proficiently.\n\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Fel mentioned that teleportation is one of his less powerful magical abilities. Therefore, it should be fine for you as well.\u201d\nMagicians, individuals capable of achieving the seemingly impossible. The power of a magician varied depending on the magnitude of their ambitions.\nNabel narrowed his eyes outside Lorna\u2019s field of vision. That was probably why Lady Ridahad treated her so cruelly.\nTo ensure she didn\u2019t dare to have any hopes.\nHe intended to break that slowly.\nHe could wait.\nUntil his beloved Lorna shattered the invisible prison she unknowingly created and took steps forward on her own.\n\u201cWhatever you desire, I can make it happen, my lady.\u201d\nHis voice was dreamlike, reminiscent of that night when Nabel departed. Lorna looked down at him, but now he wouldn\u2019t leave.\nThis certainty gave Lorna an immense sense of reassurance.\n\u201cThe same goes for Tanya. If you\u2019re concerned about her well-being, simply wish for it.\u201d\n\u201cJust wish for her to get better.\u201d Nabel took her hand.\n\u201cThen it shall be fulfilled.\u201d\nIt was the privilege of a favored deity\u2019s servant. It wasn\u2019t a grand task, merely something for one person. It wouldn\u2019t strain Lorna even if he healed her.\n\u201cOh, Lady Tanya\u2026\u201d\nSuddenly, a thought came to Lorna\u2019s mind, and she voiced it. It had been bothering her.\n\u201cMay I continue to employ Lady Tanya as my escort?\u201d\nShe spoke out of desire, but lacked certainty. It was a question she asked, thinking that Nabel probably wouldn\u2019t object.\nBe cautious.\nBe infinitely cautious.\nYet there was no need to be.\nNabel concealed a tinge of regret in his expression. It seemed that she was still afraid of hoping. It was up to him to guide her towards the light.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nNabel nodded lightly.\n\u201cEvery blade of grass in the palace, every ray of sunshine, every trivial thing belongs to you, my lady. They are all things I have acquired to offer you. So, do not hesitate and indulge yourself.\u201d\nAnything. He kissed the back of Lorna\u2019s hand.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Only when Nisha called out to him did he lift his head from his office desk.\n\u201cCome in.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nNisha pushed open the door and took a breath as she looked at the pile of work on his desk.\n\u201cIt would be advisable for you to take a little rest while working.\u201d\nNabel heard her words with one ear and let them slip away with the other.\nIt was good to have the powerful imperial authority, akin to that of a pure ivory tower, in his hands. It meant he could push anything aside without restraint.\nBut it also meant he had many tasks to handle. Of course, Nabel had resolved this even before ascending the throne.\nHe had to hold many things in his hands. That way, more could be placed in the hands of the Lady who ruled over him.\nHe wanted to giveLorna a kind and expansive world.\nSo he could endure.\n\u201cA routine report, perhaps?\u201d\nNabel asked, lightly dismissing Nisha\u2019s words.\nNisha scratched her cheek and nodded.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe Lord before her eyes looked no different from the young child she had first seen about ten years ago on the battlefield.\nThe image of him constantly pushing himself.\nAt that time, she had wondered why a boy who hadn\u2019t properly honed his sword was able to survive on the battlefield with such tenacity.\nThe pure Iberian lineage had always been blessed with talented swordsmen through generations. But facing those who had properly trained with their swords in the midst of a battlefield and emerging victorious was not a task that could be accomplished by talent alone.\n\u2018\u2026!\u2019\nThat\u2019s why the first impression Nisha had of Nabel was of him being injured.\nBack then, she hadn\u2019t even considered him a precious pure Iberian, just a boy soldier burdened by household affairs.\nThere were many who longed for the pure Iberians as the Miltan Gang disrupted the Empire.\nIf their Lord had revealed only the face of that pure Iberian, there would have been no need for him to rise from the bottom.\nBut their Lord had chosen the most certain and arduous path.\nAs if he had the certainty to obtain what he desired.\nHis lacking sword skills were compensated for by my left arm. I offered my left arm and took the opponent\u2019s heart. By the time that arm became mangled, the tip of the sword had become sharp, just like a talented pure Iberian\u2019s sword.\n\u201cNisha?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nNIsha thoughts interrupted, lowering the documents she had been holding in front of Nabel.\n\u201cThis is a report related to Genas Miltan. Shall I summarize it briefly and present it to you?\u201d\nSince I would have to examine the contents anyway, and with so much work to do, there was no other choice. Nabel nodded briefly.\n\u201cUltimately, we haven\u2019t found anything yet.\u201d\nAs Nabel listened to Nisha\u2019s report, he passed a paper to her.\n\u201cAs the opponent is a sorcerer beyond the eighth level, teleportation seems to be quite difficult to locate.\u201d\n\u201cStill, being a sorcerer, they must have a lair.\u201d\nSorcerers were a race that generally disliked moving. This was because their magical power recovered well in familiar places. They usually preferred to create separate places called lairs and live alone.\nNo matter how Genas Miltan wasn\u2019t a sorcerer, he would still have to create a lair.\n\u201cYes. So we are primarily exploring areas where magical power flows well on the ground.\u201d\nThat would be the usual method of investigation. However, the opponent was a sorcerer comparable to the owner of a divine beast, and above all, not an ordinary sorcerer.\n\u201cWe need to change our approach.\u201d\nNabel pushed the document he had examined aside and spoke.\n\u201cFirst, find out if there are any strange rumours. The chances of Genas mastering magic perfectly are extremely low.\u201d\nSince I occasionally couldn\u2019t control my magical power even with the great sorcerer Feldo, who had spent a lifetime with me. He narrowed his eyes.\n\u201cIf there are any changes in the weather or things that can be dismissed as baseless rumours, check them first. The answer might be among them.\u201d\nA person who couldn\u2019t handle magic properly having such enormous magical power was inconceivable. Nisha slightly widened her eyes and bowed her head deeply.\n\u201cIf you find something, report it first before conducting a search.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s command was dry.\nHe was always like that. There was no need to be surprised. However, as Nisha looked at the Lord who was starting work again, she suddenly recalled the appearance of the Lord who had been with the owner of the divine beast.\nAt that time, he looked more vibrant, almost unrecognizable as the same person.\nLike last night on the balcony.\n\u201cI accept your command.\u201d\nThe Lord at that time seemed so at ease.\nNisha pondered about the owner of the divine beast and withdrew from his office.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "94": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-94/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI could never have imagined that I would be entrusted with such a glorious task,\u201d Lucel confessed, his face filled with embarrassment. He lowered his head again in front of Lorna, demonstrating his humility.\n\u201cThe art of using magic and the art of teaching magic are two distinct domains. I still doubt whether I am worthy enough to teach magic to the master of the divine beings,\u201d Lucel humbly expressed, his head bowed in deference.\n\u201cI desire to experience the multitude of possibilities that can be achieved through magic, not merely acquire magical knowledge,\u201d Lorna remarked, expressing her yearning.\nEngaging in conversation with the aged sorcerer was still somewhat awkward for her. Nonetheless, her words flowed without trembling, and the eight bracelets on her wrists were becoming somewhat familiar.\n\u201cThe master of the divine beings possesses the power to manifest their thoughts into reality. If that is the reason,\u201d Lucel\u2019s countenance displayed astonishment as he deeply bowed his head.\n\u201cI would be honoured to assist if I can,\u201d he declared.\nIndeed, his assistance would prove invaluable. Lorna had contemplated various ways to request other sorcerers to teach her magic, yet all of them recommended Lucel. It was not merely because they dared not teach the owner of the ninth staircase.\nLucel was a sorcerer well-versed in everyday magic, as well as combat spells, barriers, and protective enchantments. If one desired to comprehend the extent of what magic could accomplish, turning to Lucel was the right choice.\n\u201cI am in your debt,\u201d Lorna said with a soft smile. She gazed at Lucel, a sorcerer possessing an extraordinary power far beyond her own.\nAs if reading his thoughts, a shadow suddenly emerged from Lorna and Bell, perched on her arm, flew out in alarm, giving Lucel a somewhat wary look.\n\u201c\u2026Well then, I shall begin by teaching you the principles of magic. Understanding how to harness the power of the divine within oneself will prove to be of great assistance,\u201d Lucel cautiously commenced his explanation.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, magical power accumulates around the heart. The more sincerely one worships the divine, the denser the magical power becomes near the heart. However, those who are unable to manipulate magical power internally can wield it externally through their bodies,\u201d he pointed to his own heart as he spoke.\n\u201cFor instance, humans possess the ability to wield power through magical means that would otherwise be impossible for them.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Lorna nodded in understanding. Then, a question suddenly arose in her mind.\n\u201cThen, those who cannot accumulate magical power within their bodies\u2026\u201d\nLucel\u2019s body momentarily stiffened at Lorna\u2019s question. Lorna clearly observed the change in his demeanour.\n\u201cThey can never accumulate it throughout their lives. Under normal circumstances, that would be the case\u2026\u201d\nLucel\u2019s head tilted slightly downward.\n\u201cThe heart serves as the vessel that contains magical power. Thus, the heart of a divine being is akin to a manifestation of divine love. If one were to possess my heart, brimming with magical power\u2026\u201d\n[Kyaa!]\nBell\u2019s sudden reaction, perhaps triggered by the mention of divine beings, startled Lucel, who deeply bowed his head. It appeared rather unsettling to Lorna.\nCome to think of it, Lucel had never truly believed that Genas Miltan was the murderer. Perhaps this conviction was rooted in the fact that he had seen Genas Miltan up close.\nAlthough not explicitly stated, it was evident. Lucel had inadvertently considered Genas Miltan while explaining.\n\u201cWhat kind of person was Genas Miltan?\u201d\nShe inquired, leaving a brief pause before Lucel spoke.\n\u201cI was indeed the most faithful servant of Sir Tuna. I was also an apprentice to the great sorcerer Sir Fel.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cIf you were Sir Fel\u2019s apprentice\u2026?\u201d\nTo think that he could use magic as a sorcerer\u2019s apprentice! That realization suddenly dawned on Lorna, revealing an important fact.\nSir Fel was called a sorcerer, but he himself did not know how to use magic. It was his familiar who wielded magic.\n\u201c\u2026What did Genas learn from Sir Fel?\u201d\n\u201cHe learned everything except magic.\u201d\nLucel spoke up, his voice slightly subdued. The tale that emerged from his lips was as follows.\nLorna, being from a different continent, had no knowledge of the Milta before the rebellion. However, it was a prominent noble family even before becoming involved in the revolt.\nAside from possessing magical power as the owner of a familiar, Fel was knowledgeable in many fields. He was not only the saviour of Iber with his magic, but also a skilled strategist during the war, and even proposed bills for the welfare of the imperial citizens in peacetime.\nGiven his influence at the time, it was impossible for him not to have a connection with the renowned scholar of the Milta, Genas. Amidst this, Genas Miltan, with his insatiable thirst for knowledge, caught Fel\u2019s attention.\n\u201cHe certainly did not know how to use magic. Moreover, as someone who observed him closely as Sir Fel\u2019s apprentice, I can assure you.\u201d\nHe spoke with a resigned expression.Lorna\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cIf Genas Miltan was a disciple of general knowledge, then I, as the apprentice who inherited the magic, naturally assumed that his and Sir Fel\u2019s deaths were unrelated.\u201d\nAfter a moment of silence, he spoke again.\n\u201c\u2026Unaware that there was a wicked person nearby\u2026 I have no face to show to the pure Iber.\u201d\nLucel cast his gaze downward. Then he clenched his fist.\n\u201cI saw the corpse with my own eyes, and yet I cannot fathom how he is still alive. But fear not, your majesty\u201d\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened at the title she heard for the first time. Lucel spoke firmly.\n\u201cI will not allow him to harm the owner of the familiar, the guardian of Iber, ever again.\u201d\nFor the sake of the pure Iber, for the sake of its guardian, is there anything I cannot do?\nThe aged sorcerer\u2019s determination clenched his fist tightly.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The ceiling of the palace split apart, resonating with a thunderous roar. Instead of a building, it seemed as though a portion of the earth had collapsed, causing the structure to lose its form and sink into the abyss.\nNabel found himself amidst this chaos. Escaping from here would be akin to escaping the depths of hell itself. The flames ignited by Genas Miltan had devoured the palace gardens, transforming the once regal residence into a fiery sea.\n\u201cNevertheless, I must find a way out of this place,\u201d he contemplated.\nEscape was not an option for him. It had been his unwavering determination, guiding him through a decade of hardship. It was akin to an inertia, a force that proFeled his body to jolt upright amidst the acrid smoke and violent vibrations.\n\u201cI must emerge, survive, and find my lady,\u201d he declared.\nLost in these thoughts, he suddenly realized.\nWhere could his lady be?\nSurely not trapped within this collapsing edifice?\nIt dawned on him belatedly. The place where he stood was none other than Avalt Palace, where he had fallen into a slumber.\nIn that moment of realization, Nabel opened his eyes.\n***\n\u201c\u2026.A dream.\u201d\nIt seemed as though cold sweat trickled down. An unpleasant, chilling sensation flowed through the countryside.\nFor the past decade, Nabel had always dreamt.\nMostly, they were nightmares. Foolish as he was in his dreams, he always believed them to be reality, and he would cry out in agony. Upon awakening, he would find himself in a pitiful state, just moments before the wretched nightmare.\nIn his dreams, he was either dragged away by the knights of Genas Miltan and executed, or stabbed through the heart and killed. Sometimes, he would be tortured by an unknown figure from Genas Miltan, who seemed to have a sadistic obsession with those who knew nothing of his face.\nThe torment was so vivid, the pain so intense, that upon awakening, he would find himself inside a tent on a battlefield.\nIt was a night when his left arm, which had blocked the sword, throbbed with extraordinary pain.\nAt times, he also dreamt of Lorna.\nTheir reunion was always fleeting. The majority of those dreams consisted of her being captured by the incoming sorcerers, who would then take her away.\nThus, his dreams always ended in nightmares.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThose nightmares had driven him for the past ten years, desperately fleeing from them. He squinted his eyes.\n\u201cGenas Miltan\u2026.\u201d\nTruly, he had believed he was dead. He couldn\u2019t have possibly not known the young prince of Genas Miltan, who was about the same age as him. No, in fact, they were well acquainted.\nBeing of similar age, and with the Duke of Miltan often visiting the Iver palace, they knew each other quite well.\n\u201cLike Lord Fel, you\u2019ll become a grand sorcerer! I don\u2019t know if the gods will visit me too\u2026.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Jenath Miltan, apprentice of the grand sorcerer Fel, and friend of Nabel Iver, used to say.\nOf course, their innocent childhood came to an end when the rebellion in Genas Miltanoccurred.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nOnce again, he gazed up at the ceiling. Today was the last day in the Avalt Palace. Now that the main palace had been sorted out, he had to move to the main palace with his sister.\nThe main palace, where the Emperor resided, was the place where the most remnants of the magic of the grand sorcerer Fel remained. Even if they were to seize the heart of a divine being, comparing its owner and power to that of a divine being would be impossible. Therefore, if one were to choose the safest place within the palace, it would be there.\nAs the center of the palace, it took quite some time to tidy up the place due to Miltan\u2019s mischief. Nabel closed his eyes and then opened them.\nHe longed to see his sister.\nHe wanted to bury his face in her sweet, luscious pink hair. Finally, he rose from his bed.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nBriefly, Nabel\u2019s plan to secretly gaze at the sleeping Lorna and leave had been derailed from the start. Though he opened the door noiselessly, he couldn\u2019t conceal his presence.\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of his blonde hair.\n\u201cNabel?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026You\u2019re not sleeping.\u201d\nSurprise lasted but a moment. Nabel\u2019s audacious desire stirred within his mind.\nHe had intended to be content with merely glimpsing the slumbering lady. However, with her waking at this moment, he yearned for her voice, her scent, her touch.\nShe must rest early for she must wield magic within the royal palace tomorrow.\n\u201cI can\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d\nLorna sat up.\nIt was as if the midday sun had suddenly illuminated the scene before him.\nIt was evident that drowsiness had not touched her as she had been quietly fixated on one side all along.\nAs the door entered his line of sight, fleeting memories of his childhood resurfaced and shook his mind. Even after Nabel had left, thorny vines had been placed in front of her door numerous times.\nA protective talisman.\nHe vaguely recalled the image of a maidservant who had prattled on about preventing the emergence of the demon within the room. When his lips tightly sealed in response to the unpleasant memories, the door opened.\nIn that instant, he expected thorny vines or something akin to a nightmare to burst forth. However, the person who entered was a face he found delightfully welcome, enough to dispel the nightmarish memories in an instant.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in quietly?\u201d\nLorna finally rose from the bed. Nabel gently guided her head, signaling her to stay put, and laid her back down.\nIt felt much more comfortable than before, even though he had lain in the same spot. Lorna softly closed her eyes.\n\u201cI simply woke up.\u201d\nNabel replied as he sat by her side. There was no need to speak of the nightmare\u2026 That was what he thought until suddenly, his mind was consumed by thoughts of the daytime report.\n\u201cNow that I think about it, you seemed curious about Genesis Miltan.\u201d\nAs he spoke, he narrowed his eyes. Fate would have it that even in his interrupted sleep, Genesis Miltan had made an appearance in his nightmare. Perhaps the daytime report had influenced him.\nThe master of the deity would surely be curious about Genesis Miltan.\nAlthough it had occurred atop the Mato Tower, there was no way that a report wouldn\u2019t reach him. Above all, Lorna, whom he had allowed Tanya to guard, was constantly watching her from a place she couldn\u2019t see.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nLorna smiled. Nabel found that meaningless smile to be infinitely sweet.\nA smile meant only for me. I wish that smile were directed solely at me. I hope those eyes are solely fixed on me, and no one else.\nI would love for those sweet lips to utter words that are meant only for me.\nI want you now, more than ever.\nI don\u2019t wish to share you with anyone else.\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t remain ignorant about our enemies.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s thoughts halted at her subsequent words.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nThe simmering anticipation in Jena\u2019s heart suddenly subsided, almost like a lie. It was inconceivable that Lorna wouldn\u2019t know that Jena\u2019s interest in Genesis was more than just a passing curiosity. And yet, if she were still curious about Genesis, there could only be one reason.\nKnowing that fact, however\u2026\nNabel\u2019s fingertips lowered slightly.\nHis hand, which had wrapped around her soft blanket instead of her, slid down his arm, but it was only for a moment. Just long enough that Lorna wouldn\u2019t notice.\nI want to monopolize you.\nI wish you would think only of me a little more.\nSo that there would be no need to divert your gaze elsewhere, I wanted to fill your surroundings entirely with myself.\nSo that you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about enemies or allies, I wanted to eliminate the enemies and connect everything to me, calling them all allies.\nI hope we could both be happy in that safe world, where nothing would break.\nIt wasn\u2019t a fear of losing each other.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nHe tightened the blanket in his grasp once again.\nThere was still a long way to go. He had brought someone precious to a place unprepared, so it was only natural that he had to move faster.\nHe felt as though he had traveled back ten years.\nYes, there was no time to sleep.\n\u201cNabel?\u201d\nLorna turned her gaze towards him.\nHad he been lost in thought too deeply? Even during the continuous battle over the past few days, he had always been sensitive to ambushes. But the only face that could make him defenseless approached so close that their noses almost touched.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

It\u2019s embarrassing to feel like you can read my thoughts even though you don\u2019t have one.\n\u201c\u2015Nunim.\u201d\nHe called Lorna in a low voice. Huh? His face, tilting towards her, was adorable. A few strands of light pink hair, illuminated by the faint moonlight, flowed down.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid there might be someone else beside you, Nunim.\u201d\nI\u2019m afraid of thinking about someone else.\nI don\u2019t want to think about anyone else.\nHis low voice carried a faint warmth.\n\u201c\u2015I doubt if I have properly served you to the extent that you have to divert your gaze like this.\u201d\nI doubt if I\u2019m lacking to the extent that you have to divert your gaze like this.\nNabel tightly closed his mouth. Lorna smiled. It was a snow-white smile that contrasted sharply with his jet-black mind.\n\u201cWhen that happens, hold my hand, Nabel.\u201d\nIt was a gentle permission. A light permission that seemed to imply that there was no need to worry.\nNabel looked down at her hand. Lorna reached out her hand and held his, while his other hand held the blanket.\n\u201cI will grant you permission, only to you.\u201d\nYou can hold it as much as you want. Whenever you want. Lorna, who had been speaking, smiled.\n\u201cThere is nothing in this Empire that is not allowed for you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Nunim.\u201d\nNabel shook his head. He lowered his body and kissed Lorna\u2019s hand.\n\u201cOnly you can allow this hand.\u201d\nHe cautiously lifted the hand that would bring an end to his nightmare.\n\u201cI have received something precious, so I must move faster as well.\u201d\nHe kissed Lorna\u2019s forehead, arranging her position so she could rest more comfortably.\nWhat he was giving her now was a light kiss, but in the future, he would place a bride\u2019s crown on her head.\nHe smiled at Lorna, who opened her eyes wide.\nHe felt a strange certainty.\nTonight, there would be no more nightmares.\n***\n\u201cIndeed, Shinsoo.\u201d\nIt was not a common occurrence for news from the palace to flow into the noble class. It was customary for them to act as if they hadn\u2019t even heard it.\n\u201cI had no idea. The young lady of Lord Rida, truly\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRumours of her being cursed had been spreading.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not entirely accurate.\u201d\nThe central high society of the Eastern Empire was now facing a new issue.\nThe young lady of Lord Rida, Yungae Lona de Rida.\nHer name was not originally one that would emerge from the noble circles. Until just a year ago, whenever talk of Lona arose, the high society would place their hands on their hearts and beg for forgiveness from Tuna, as if her mere mention was a sin.\nIt was because she dared to speak of the curse.\nBut the public opinion has completely reversed now.\n\u201cBut they say it\u2019s true. Look.\u201d\nOne young lady pointed at a portrait. It was the portrait of Lorna de Rida, which until recently had been a symbol of the curse.\nBoth the Western and Eastern Empires worshipped Tuna. Of course, there were separate small temples dedicated to different deities, but they were few and insignificant.\nThat\u2019s why news about the owner of the divine beast appearing in the Western Empire spread quickly.\nIt had never happened during the time of Archmage Fel. He was known in the Western Empire solely for being a renowned mage.\nHowever, for some reason, the stories about the divine beast were buried while crossing the bridge that connected the Western and Eastern continents, the Phinelle Bridge.\nBut this time was different.\nSomehow, even the portrait of the owner of the divine beast had spread. The rumour had spread uncontrollably due to her being a famous figure that everyone secretly knew.\nLorna de Rida, the cursed noble lady.\nThe first person to recognize this was a newcomer to the central high society, the peculiar young lady Armodan. She had come from the western region of the Eastern Empire, which was relatively close to the Western Empire, so she seemed to be more aware of the affairs of the Western Empire.\n\u201cWe failed to honour an esteemed individual.\u201d\nThe trend of offering significant offerings to the temple was already spreading among the noble class. After treating Tuna\u2019s beloved child in such a manner, it was only natural to seek forgiveness, even if belatedly.\n\u201cI, too, plan to offer prayers at the Tuna Temple for two days.\u201d\nArmodan\u2019s words were met with nods from the people. Inside the bustling hall where the nobles gathered, almost everyone was engaged in similar conversations.\nAmong them, there was one person who couldn\u2019t quite fit in.\nNext to Lady Rida, who was absent from this gathering, stood the person who garnered the most attention and yet remained disconnected from the discussions.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe fan that covered her face remained untouched.\nAnd inside the concealed space of the fan, the one softly murmuring with her lips was none other than Lady Rida, the wife of Lord Rida.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "97": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-97/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThose who had never shown an interest in the affairs of the continent suddenly found themselves at a loss for words! Lady Lydia, the Countess, unknowingly bit her lip. How could news of the owner of the divine beast spread so quickly in high society? It truly puzzled her.\nNot only had word reached the Eastern Continent about the owner\u2019s formidable magical powers, but also of the miraculous feats achieved. Rumours, exaggerated or diminished when crossing the Pheinel Strait, were delivered almost intact.\nThe curse of the gods that Lady Lydia, the cursed daughter of the Count, was said to have received turned out to be a gift of the gods\u2019 greatest love\u2014a divine beast.\n\u201cWho on earth spread such rumours!\u201d\nNaturally, chaos erupted in the Southern Temple, where Lady Lydia, the Countess, was stationed. While the common priests of the temple were oblivious, the upper echelons were all people who sympathized with Lady Lydia, sharing her intentions.\nDespite mobilizing all the resources of the temple, they couldn\u2019t find the origin of the rumours no matter how hard they tried.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nLady Lydia managed her expression as she averted her gaze from the nobles in high society. She had come to find out who among them had spread the rumours, but her mind grew dizzy.\nEveryone was engaged in the same conversation, making it impossible to determine who actively spread the news.\n\u201cA delayed contact.\u201d\nNaturally, the \u2018collaborator\u2019 in the Western Continent was also contacted. Receiving the transfer of the owner of the divine beast was a condition for obtaining powerful magical abilities, so contact with the collaborator was necessary.\nHowever, the collaborator, who used to respond immediately upon contact, was strangely silent this time.\n\u201cOh my, Lady Countess, you\u2019re also present.\u201d\nLady Lydia tried to suppress her anger. At that moment, the noblewomen, who had belatedly noticed her, gathered around her one by one.\n\u201cI arrived just a little while ago.\u201d\nEven when she smiled and engaged in conversation, her grip on the fan tightened involuntarily. The corner of her mouth, hidden behind the fan, trembled slightly.\nShe must contact the collaborator again.\nOnly when the attention was focused on the owner of the divine beast could she present a solution to the collaborator as well.\nEspecially if the person possessed such powerful magical abilities, it would undoubtedly be feasible.\n\u201cMay I invite you this way? The wild strawberries that arrived from the Ferna region today are exceptionally fresh.\u201d\n\u201cHave you tried the wild strawberry cream cake?\u201d\n\u201cAt the Imir Patisserie.\u201d\nThe noblewomen chattered away, surrounding her. It was an unwelcome attention.\nThey pretended to be friendly, but Lady Lydia knew exactly what they wanted.\nThey needed something to chew on during tea time, something to bring them joy. Lady Lydia tightly gripped her fan once again.\n\u201cIs it really that delicious? I\u2019d love to try it sometime.\u201d\nLady Lydia followed the noblewomen, changing her position.\nIt was a cheerful atmosphere, but for her, the laughter was not genuine.\n***\nThe aristocratic soirees always concluded in the evening. Until then, the lower-ranking individuals who had accompanied their wives and sweethearts were left to wait restlessly outside the carriages.\nIt was the same for any family. Depending on how gracefully they awaited their masters in front of the carriages, their family\u2019s image could be assessed. Hence, the coachman and footman who waited for ill-tempered masters maintained an impeccable demeanour.\nEspecially the servants of Lord Rida\u2019s household. Well, at least that\u2019s how they appeared to others.\n\u201cIt seems to be nearing its end. Look at the people coming out onto the balcony.\u201d\nThey gazed up at the balcony without a hint of disturbance in their postures. To onlookers, it seemed they were solely waiting for their masters.\nHowever, they conversed in hushed tones. Among themselves, they had become accustomed to whispering with the faintest voices that barely lingered.\n\u201cGo and see inside the reception hall before returning.\u201d\nFel, a knight from the Zero Order, who sat on the coachman\u2019s seat of Lord Rida\u2019s carriage, spoke. He naturally had no loyalty toward Lady Rida.\n\u201cDid you see her expression just now? It was absolutely wretched. She\u2019ll undoubtedly vent her anger during our journey today.\u201d\nThe discontented expression lasted only briefly. Hearing Mel\u2019s words, the knight Nia quickened her pace. She was also affiliated with the Zero Order, albeit clad in finely engraved armour.\n[Clank!]\nPeeking briefly inside the carriage, Nisha pulled out a bundle of cloth. It was a prop of no particular significance, just a bundle of fabric needed for theatrical purposes.\nAs if she had something to convey to her master, she hurriedly dashed towards the mansion with an anxious expression. The other servants from different households briefly glanced at her before turning away.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "98": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-98/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat could be happening? There was no need to pay attention since such incidents were not uncommon.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nUpon entering the building, Nisha tucked the bundle of cloth into a pocket inside her armour. She then skillfully concealed several dismantled parts of her armour, which hindered her movements, in a deep corner of a storage room in the corridor.\nWith much greater freedom of movement, she surveyed her surroundings and spotted a staircase. It was the central staircase of the building.\n\u201cSuch passages are reserved for the use of the masters.\u201d\nIn the mansions where aristocratic soirees were held, separate corridors were designated for servants and nobles. It was due to the foolish notion that the esteemed individuals and common folk couldn\u2019t possibly use the same passage.\nThanks to this, infiltrating became easier for individuals like Nisha with a specific purpose. She soon discovered a small staircase typically used by the servants.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nShe ascended silently and discovered a rear path. It was the passage right behind the banquet hall where the church gathering was taking place. Naturally, it was a passage for the servants.\nAnd of course, it was situated very close to the banquet hall, so that the servants who had to move swiftly would not have to wait for the esteemed masters.\nNaturally, with her keen ears, Nia could hear even the sounds from inside the banquet hall.\n\u201c\u2026In the temple, they say\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo it seems. Now\u2026\u201d\nAs expected, the talk about the temple was getting heated.\nNisha smiled silently and glanced discreetly inside the banquet hall from one side of the passage.\nThere she was.\nLady Rida, with her face concealed beneath a crumpled fan, appeared.\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\nWas she going to the restroom? Nia saw Lady Rida ask for permission and exit. Her steps quickened. Nia turned back, left the rear path, and silently began to trail Lady Rida.\nThe direction Lady Rida was heading was the exact opposite of the restroom. It was more like a secret chamber, a place used for clandestine discussions even within noble circles.\n[Thud]\nLady Rida looked around and entered the secret chamber. Nia sensed movement from inside. It didn\u2019t seem like anyone was there.\nWhom did she arrange to meet there?\nThen the other party would enter the secret chamber through this door. It was the moment for Nia to quickly move away from the front of the door.\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\nIt was Lady Rida\u2019s voice.\nNia held her breath.\nThere were two sets of movements coming from inside the room.\nCertainly, there had been no one inside until just a moment ago.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt was the perfect moment for Nia to eavesdrop on the conversation taking place inside.\nA shadow appeared in the corridor. Nia tensed up, but upon seeing the revealed figure, she relaxed and swiftly signalled.\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone inside.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nIn response to the signal, Armodan, the young lady known for her elegant manners, appeared. She had been strolling around the banquet hall just a moment ago, but now she had silently arrived at the entrance of the secret chamber.\nIt was not a movement that an untrained person could make.\nArmodan extended her hand as if greeting Nia and handed her a folded piece of paper. Then, she transformed back into the elegant young lady, lifted her dress on both sides, and disappeared.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNia unfolded the piece of paper and shrugged her shoulders.\n[Transmission of information regarding the master of the divine beast is complete.]\nBelow that, it detailed the leaked portrait and the actions of Lady Rida at the banquet hall. Nisha quickly glanced at the contents and deep into her pouch the note went.\nThen, she once again focused her ears on the conversation inside the room.\n***\nLady Rida, Countess of Baek, received the awaited contact during the midst of a bustling social gathering. In her mind, she heard a resonating voice.\n\u201cInto the chamber.\u201d\nLady Rida, with her commanding magical prowess, could not possibly overlook that low voice. A voice so profound, yet belonging to a young man, could only leave a remarkable impression.\n[Thump]\nThe aristocratic chamber was inherently soundproof. Unless one possessed the heightened sensitivity of a beast, it was impossible to eavesdrop on conversations within. The chamber was the perfect place for confidential discussions.\n\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\nAs Lady Rida entered the chamber, she spoke up.\nNo one was inside the chamber.\nHowever, she spoke as if there were someone right in front of her.\nThe Continental Helper, possessing formidable magical powers, had never once properly revealed himself before her. Yet every time, he attempted conversations in unimaginable ways.\nSuddenly, words would appear on a paper in front of her, or she would hear magic reverberating through the air.\nThat was what Lady Rida had anticipated. But today was different.\n\u201cI had some matters to attend to.\u201d\nThe sound she heard was a voice. The same voice that had resonated in Lady Rida\u2019s mind. Even the gentle tone remained unchanged.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nLady Rida looked around, trying to locate the source of the voice.\nThere sat a figure donning a mask. The large robe, with the hood flipped up, made it difficult to discern their face or physique.\n\u201cI have heard about the discussions at the banquet hall. Sennet must have gone through a lot.\u201d\nSuperficially, the tone seemed affectionate. However, the voice was devoid of warmth. Lady Rida, who had never disclosed her true name to the Helper, shuddered.\nNot only did he refer to her by her current name, Kanna deRida, which was not widely used even among the people within the temple, but he also called her Sennet, a name rarely spoken of.\nIt meant that he knew more about her than she had anticipated.\n\u201c\u2026While I am here, I will ensure there are no other disturbances, as you requested.\u201d\n\u201cBut there has been a slight change in plans.\u201d\nThe voice, resembling a melodic song, resonated through the room once again. He chuckled softly.\n\u201cHowever, by breaking the promise on this side, the Helper must have felt uneasy.\u201d\nThe man rose to his feet. Lady Rida tried to see his face beneath the mask. However, just like the hazy mist that seemed to obscure his face, she could not properly identify him.\nPerhaps it was magic.\n\u201cI have mentioned this before, but once the owner of the Divine Beast begins to realize my true power, there is no way out. Time is running short.\u201d\nThe person with the strongest magical abilities.\nIf that person could harm others and wish for their own benefit and happiness, becoming a selfish individual, the first one to suffer would undoubtedly be Lady Rida herself.\nShe knew this all too well. That was why, as soon as she entered the mansion, despair had taken root within her.\n\u201cI am aware. However, do you know who was by her side? This is different from our agreement. I was certain there would be no one properly guarding that woman\u2026!\u201d\nLady Rida, caught up in her excitement, spoke without realizing it.

The Countess\u2019s excited voice abruptly ceased.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe Countess fell silent.\nIn that moment, she recalled the first time she had encountered this man, not face to face but in a metaphorical sense. A person who possessed the power to completely incinerate others from a distance.\nNisha had made an unilateral request for cooperation at the Southern Temple, only to have the magicians there dismiss it as nonsense. In response, Ija had slaughtered them on the spot.\nThe only thing that remained in that place was her. The dread she had felt at that time now resurfaced and consumed the Countess.\n\u201cWell, that was unexpected. Of all things, the owner of the deity decides to go alongside the Emperor of the Western Empire.\u201d\nIn a chilling tone, he uttered those words. The trembling voice of the Countess responded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hopeless. There\u2019s nothing I can do because of that slave! The knights are everywhere, surveillance is thorough\u2026\u201d\nAttempting to kidnap or assassinate the owner of the deity was utterly impossible.\nThat slave, no, the Emperor of the Western Empire, was a person who would not hesitate even when it came to cutting off what was his. Anyone suspected of disloyalty had their throat slit.\n\u201cI understand. I am an \u2018accomplice,\u2019 so I must provide you with means to achieve your goal.\u201d\nThe man nodded in understanding of her words. Then he extended his hand.\nOn top of his black glove lay a resplendent, iridescent gem. Sonnet, who had worked at the temple for a long time, knew what that object was.\n\u201cA magic stone?\u201d\nThe man nodded his head.\n\u201cIt contains my magical power. With this, you should be able to penetrate the barrier surrounding the imperial palace. Unless they establish a completely new barrier, that is, one beyond the scope of my palace.\u201d\nA laughter mixed with ridicule escaped him.\n\u201cAfter completing this task, Sonnet, although it won\u2019t even amount to a speck of the magical power you will possess, enjoy it. Manipulate the humans with no resistance to magic as much as you desire. You know, magical power is the divine mercy that grants wishes.\u201d\nWith great magical power, one could do anything they wished. They could even eliminate the sun in the sky. It would be an unimaginably potent and overwhelming magical power.\nTrembling, the Countess reached out and grasped the magic stone with her hand. As a sorceress herself, she could feel it. The object in her hand was the crystallization of an immensely powerful magical force.\n[Thunk]\nA man\u2019s gloved hand touched the hand of the woman holding the magic stone.\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Lady Rida, the Countess, exclaimed, startled. The man neither confirmed nor denied.\n\u201cSince you seem uneasy about my assistance, make me a promise. Then, have a little more trust in me and focus on the task at hand, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nInstead of mocking her with coarse ridicule, why not speak? Hm?\nIt seemed like a delusion that a taunt hung in the air at the end of his low voice.\nThe colour drained from Lady Rida\u2019s face.\nCrack!\nA dark pattern began to emerge on the back of her hand. It felt as if her flesh was being seared, causing the Countess to swallow her breath.\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\nA faint whimper was stifled.\nThe sensation of a black tattoo being etched into her hand was vivid, as if branding something with a red-hot iron.\n\u201cDarkness.\u201d\nUnable to overcome the pain, the Countess started to collapse. The man caught her body and spoke.\n\u201cIt is also engraved on my wrist. Look.\u201d\nHe gently removed his glove, revealing the same pattern being etched on his skin, visible even to Lady Rida.\nDespite surely experiencing the same pain, the man didn\u2019t utter a single groan.\n\u201cThis tattoo is proof of our contract. Promise, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cAs long as this body\u2019s power reaches you, I will assist you so that you do not die, madam.\u201d\nThe words that followed echoed with several voices, as if resonating with the contents of the contract.\nLady Rida\u2019s body convulsed. She tightly grasped the magic stone in her hand. Something felt off. Her vision shook entirely, and her hearing amplified several times, causing her head to spin.\nAmidst all this, what intruded upon her sense of smell was an unfamiliar scent. It was a smell she had never encountered in the clean temples or noble estates\u2026\n\u2026the smell of decay?\n\u201cWith that, disturb my senses.\u201d\nThe man spoke with a clear voice. Lady Rida\u2019s mind, as she tried to gather her thoughts, turned white once again.\nIn that state, the man\u2019s voice pierced through her.\n\u201cAnd bring the owner of the divine beast to me.\u201d\n***\nNabel heard the report that night. It was a report that had crossed the bridge of Penele, a distant place according to the accounts. He received the report through one of the communication devices left behind by the Archmage Pell, as relayed by another person.\nAt first glance, it appeared to be a simple wooden plank. However, letters appeared above it accompanied by a white light.\n\u201cInformation about the owner of the divine beast was leaked to the elite social circles of the Eastern Empire. As expected, the nobility\u2019s attention was drawn to it. Particularly, the public opinion regarding Lady Rida, the Countess, is quite concerning,\u201d the report continued.\n\u201cThat\u2019s to be expected,\u201d Nabel nodded slightly, studying the report further.\n\u201cInvitations from the social circles that used to come constantly to Lady Rida have begun to cease, and there are even talks in the noble circles about offering prayers of apology to the gods. They claim it\u2019s because they failed to recognize the child of the gods,\u201d the report informed.\n\u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t they seek forgiveness from that esteemed person first, rather than praying to the gods?,\u201d Nabel\u2019s lips curled with a hint of amusement.\n\u201cAccording to the gathered information, even the nobles who frequently attend the temples are planning to join in the prayers. Unless there are unforeseen circumstances, apart from the Sonnet and the Southern Temple, they will come to know about the owner of the divine beast. Especially considering that many individuals at the temple experienced miracles during the Tower\u2019s Trials, there will be those who doubt the rumours,\u201d the report speculated.\n\u201cIn that case, Lady Rida, as the person who rejected and mistreated the most beloved child of the gods, will be left isolated. Who would step forward to lift the hand of the one who cast aside and tormented the gods\u2019 most cherished creation, unless they are intent on throwing away their prospects,\u201d Nabel remarked, unless one wants to cast away their future.\n\u201cIn that case, the situation would reverse. Lady Rida will experience the same pain of isolation as she inflicted upon the divine one in her mansion. Of course, she might still have the support of her followers and the people from the Southern Temple. However, it won\u2019t be long before they come to a decision,\u201d Nabel continued.\n\u201cBased on the information we have so far, those individuals in prominent positions in the Southern Temple were also the ones moving alongside Lady Rida. But such a feeble alliance is destined to crumble in the face of despair. Who would want to remain on a sinking ship? If the Southern Temple wants to survive, they will have to abandon the label of Lady Rida and form a new relationship with the \u2018Collaborator\u2019 to aim for the owner of the divine beast. By that time, even Lady Rida will have become useless to the Collaborator,\u201d Nabel stated.\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have intended to use Lady Rida\u2019s feeble magical abilities, at best she would have wanted to exploit her relationship with the noble lady or her influence in the social circles. Without those, Lady Rida is useless,\u201d Nabel concluded.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEspecially since the Collaborator chose Lady Rida, she is no different than a target of Lady\u2019s terror,\u201d Nabel knew this every time he saw the magician\u2019s bracelet on Roan\u2019s wrist, it gave him pause.\nThe trauma that binds her mind will prevent Lady from exerting her true power. The Collaborator, Genesis Milletan, is after that as well.\nNow that they both know the opponent and the method, all that is left is to defeat them. Nabel returned his gaze to the wooden plank.\n\u201cIt was thought that the Collaborator and Lady Rida had reached some kind of agreement, but from the middle, no internal information could be heard, possibly even employing magic,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

What kind of exchange took place?\nNabel\u2019s eyebrow twitched as he read the next line.\n\u201c\u2026A moan was heard.\u201d\nEven though he had been reporting diligently, Nisha seemed to have gotten distracted. Nabel contemplated throwing away the wooden plank upon reading that line but resisted the urge.\n\u201cReally? I thought I misheard, but it seems I really heard something,\u201d she insisted.\nWhatever she heard, Nabel had no interest in knowing about the secret affairs of Genas Milltan.\n***\n\u201c[Ooong!]\u201d\nThe imperial palace of the Western Empire had never once crumbled, standing tall and sturdy. Of course, it had witnessed its fair share of bloodshed within its walls. Whether it was when Nabel expelled Miltaan from the palace or when Miltan had driven Iber, the embodiment of purity, out before that, the walls of the palace had witnessed the presence of red.\nHowever, even during those times and amidst numerous clashes of powerful magic, the palace had never crumbled. It was constructed to be that resilient.\nOnce again, a magical barrier was erected over the sturdy structure. It was naturally Lorne who conjured the sparkling magical barrier.\nAs Belle\u2019s front paw touched the ground, a pinkish light spread out, enveloping the outer walls of the palace. Lucel, who had inscribed the magical runes for the barrier, wiped away a bead of sweat as if he had finally let go of a burden.\n\u201c\u2026It has been activated properly.\u201d\nThe magical runes were his own creation, something that didn\u2019t exist during the era of Archmage Fel. While he wasn\u2019t as skilled as his master, he possessed exceptional talent when it came to manipulating magical runes.\n\u201cIt seems different from the barrier I used on the interior. Are there any issues?\u201d\nNabel looked at Lucel, who lowered his head deeply.\n\u201cThe magical barrier within the interior of the palace had certain limitations due to its relatively wide coverage. For instance\u2026 individuals with great magical power could penetrate it, which was a disadvantage.\u201d\nNabel narrowed her eyes. It was a chilling gaze, but she didn\u2019t reprimand Lucel.\nAt that time, Nabel had no idea that Genas Miltan had taken the heart of a deity. Hence, the barrier was the best option at the time.\n\u201cThis new magical barrier addresses those shortcomings. Now, no one unwanted by Lady Lorne can enter the palace. It applies even if another deity takes control, just like Genas Miltan. Unless they directly confront Lady Lorne and deplete the magical barrier until she exhausts all her power, entry is impossible.\u201d\nUnlike Lorne, Genas Miltan was a dying being unable to fully absorb the deity\u2019s heart. Essentially, it meant that the barrier couldn\u2019t be breached.\n\u201cHowever, to maintain this barrier, Lady Lorne\u2019s vitality will continuously diminish. It means that when the deity uses her magical power and that power drains through Lady Lorne, the barrier may be released if any issues arise with the deity.\u201d\nLucel seemed to be sweating coldly on the back of his neck. As a mage, it was natural to prepare for the worst possible outcome. He had merely spoken out of concern, although it seemed rather unwelcome to his lord.\nLucel turned his embarrassed face.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it has been installed only in the palace. The other areas with magical barriers, similar to the previous ones, have been set up throughout the palace. Surrounding the entire palace would pose a challenge due to the strain on vitality\u2026\u201d\nIt was truly an unavoidable situation. Lucel explained for quite a while.\n\u201cWell then, if any dangerous situation arises, please come to the palace. It is the safest place within the palace, after all.\u201d\nThe lengthy explanation came to an end.\nLucel offered his greetings to both individuals and quietly stepped back. Rone embraced Belle.\nStill, the pink barrier continued to flicker on the outer walls of the palace. Gradually, the light would fade, permeating through the outer walls.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nNabel inquired, observing her. Rone nodded slightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nAs Lucel had assured, there was still no discernible feeling, everything seemed normal. Nabel kissed the back of her hand.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, you must tell me. I will do whatever it takes, even squeeze out my inadequacies, to assist you.\u201d\nNabel glanced at the sorcerers fleetingly, whispering in a gentle voice. Lorne knew it was a joke wrapped in sincerity.\n\u201cEspecially energy can diminish when you\u2019re feeling down or tired\u2026 If you\u2019re not feeling well, please let me know.\u201d\nThen I shall accompany you. Nabel\u2019s fingertips gently grazed the skin on Lorne\u2019s hand. The ticklish comfort swept delicately across her arm.\n\u201cThe upcoming gathering at the Tournament Hall has me a little concerned. The temple\u2019s people are sure to flock there.\u201d\nOf all places, it had to be in my hometown. Nabel squinted his eyes.\n\u201cThe Tournament Hall?\u201d\nLorne faltered.\nThe temple\u2019s people\u2026 in other words, the sorcerers are coming.\nIt wasn\u2019t particularly a pleasant prospect.\nDespite growing accustomed to many sorcerers, she still found the unfamiliarity of those from other temples intimidating.\nEach and every gesture of theirs was unnerving and preoccupying, as if etched into her mind.\n\u201cIndeed. It\u2019s an event that takes place when a new owner of the Divine Beast is chosen.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything specific to prepare?\u201d\nIt meant that the owner of the Divine Beast would become the centerpiece of the event. Lorne hesitated once again, and Nabel lowered his head.\n\u201cYou have no reason to be anxious. It\u2019s merely a symbolic gesture of unity, dividing magical stones.\u201d\nMagical stones? Lorne\u2019s eyes widened.\nNabel seemed to understand her thoughts even without holding her hand.\n\u201cEven the magical stones are something you don\u2019t need to worry about. The Divine Beast will create them for you.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s anything that bothers you, please let me know.\nA low voice resonated.\nThe Tournament Hall also carried the significance of the owner of the Divine Beast becoming the absolute center of the temple. It was a ceremony where the High Priest of the Central Temple, who acted as a proxy for the Guardian of the Ninth Staircase, passed on their responsibilities to the owner of the Divine Beast.\nA single word from her would then set all the sorcerers in motion. She would become the owner of all the sorcerers on the continent.\nAnd even the most bothersome matters could be buried with a simple gesture.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nIn truth, it was something that didn\u2019t require the presence of sorcerers. What could the owner of the Divine Beast not accomplish?\nEliminating a person or two, with just one command to the Divine Beast, with just one wish, it could be done.\nBut her lord was still someone who saw the small world.\nSomeone who didn\u2019t know how great and powerful they truly were.\nNabel kissed her forehead.\nThe Tournament Hall marked the beginning.\nYou will become the most self-serving person in the world.\nThe current you will be unimaginably selfish and happy.\nYou will become someone who pays no heed to others\u2019 gaze, fearless.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The reinforcement of the palace guards played a part, but it was primarily due to the events that had transpired before their arrival at the palace.\nThe treacherous ones had all been decapitated, their heads separated from their bodies.\nThe astute Iber had remarkably identified the spies. Until now, their lives had been spared merely due to strategic calculations, as if waiting for the command to tidy up the palace. As soon as the order was issued, the Zeroth Knights promptly took action.\nWithin a day, an air of severity pervaded the palace. The tension was so taut that even footsteps had to be cautious. Among those who wandered with ease, there were only those who served the pure Iber. Anyone who had even the slightest doubts in their hearts trembled in fear and concealed themselves.\nParticularly those who had infiltrated as clandestine agents resisted, for they knew that execution awaited them. They were dragged out only after their blood had stained the walls of the palace.\nOf course, their necks and bodies were severed.\n\u201cIs everything in order here?\u201d\n[Thud]\nThe Grand Chamberlain Diya surveyed the walls of the palace\u2019s lobby. In her long tenure in the imperial court, splatters of blood were a common occurrence. She had witnessed numerous changes in emperors, so she had grown accustomed to such sights.\nHowever, she doubted that would be the case for the master of the gods, who had come from that distant continent.\n\u201cYes, Lady Diya. I have repainted the patterns on the walls and verified them at least five times.\u201d\nThe handmaiden, who had set down the brush she used to paint the walls, bowed her head.\nThe bloodstains were thoroughly concealed as the wall was repainted. Any drops of blood that had spattered were removed. These were things that had been left as they were until the arrival of the gods\u2019 master.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nDiya remembered the day her lord returned to the palace.\nNabel Iber, who had become the leader of the Zero Knights, personally brought forth the rebels from the Milltan Valley to this palace.\nNabel Eber led the rebels all the way outside the palace. Behind his horse, there was Miltan, whose body was bound by ropes, dragging along the dirt floor. The silver mane, symbolizing Milltan, was covered in earth and dust, stained with blood, making it appear dishevelled.\nIn front of the palace, a hand wearing white gloves raised a sword and severed Milltan\u2019s neck. Nabel slowly ended Milltan\u2019s life.\n\u201cIt feels suffocating.\u201d\nNabel had spent ten years on the battlefield. As the successor of the pure Eber lineage, known for their exceptional talent with the sword, he could sever a human\u2019s neck with a single stroke.\nHowever, he intentionally severed the neck in multiple strikes. The uneven cut fell to the ground. The severed neck remained in front of the palace for several months. Only when the remnants clinging to the tip of the spear fell to the ground, carried away by the gusty wind, were they cleared.\nDuring that time, the palace remained unchanged. The blood that stained the palace on the day of Eber\u2019s return remained as it was.\n\u201cI will tidy up the palace as quickly as possible, Your Majesty.\u201d\nDia spoke as soon as he returned. However, Nabel Iber had returned as someone far more ruthless than she remembered.\n\u201cIs there really a need to tidy up?\u201d\nThe white fabric had hardened, imbued with the colour of dried blood. Nabel\u2019s fingertips grazed it, as if appreciating a beautiful embroidery. The pure gloves seemed slightly tinged with red.\n\u201cIf we leave this as it is, it should suffice as a testament without having to sever another neck.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThe long-abandoned traces were finally being cleared away, as if nothing had ever happened within the palace walls.\n\u201cBefore Lady has a glimpse of the gruesome, let\u2019s tidy things up.\u201d\nAs Nabel spoke these words, his expression seemed different from when he touched the blood-stained cloth.\n\u201cWhat on earth happened on the battlefield?\u201d\nDiya recalled the question she had asked Nisha, a few months ago, about the Zero Knights. She had said it while watching Nabel pass by like the palace\u2019s bloodstains were invisible.\nNisha shrugged her shoulders.\n\u201cIf you roll around on the battlefield for about ten years, people tend to change. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI think we need to erase the palace\u2019s bloodstains. It\u2019s a matter of hygiene\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then let it be.\u201d\nNisha\u2019s expression became impassive as she waved her hand.\n\u201cIf we have it, there\u2019s no need to cut more throats,\u201d she said.\nHer words sounded as if Nabel Iber detested slaughter. Diya couldn\u2019t comprehend that statement.\nBut now, Diya could barely grasp its meaning.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt was rumoured that the owner of the Divine Beast had witnessed the day the sorcerer\u2019s head was severed in the conference room.\nSeveral people claimed to have seen the shocked face of Lord Lorna. He is someone who doesn\u2019t care for blood.\nAnd on that day, the Lord, who seemed unusually shattered, did not appear to enjoy the sight of blood, just as Nisha had said.\nLeaving the tainted palace behind was a warning to those below, a reminder not to forget the cruel day.\nThere was no need to place severed heads before the castle gates; the spies who entered the palace would leave evidence of their bodies being cremated.\n\u201cHe said to create a more comfortable atmosphere.\u201d\nDiya gestured after finishing her recollection.\nThe interior of the palace seemed like an entirely different structure compared to a few months ago.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u201cWho would have known that we would have the opportunity to witness the Tournament Hall led by the Master of Magic once again in our lifetime?\u201d said Lucel. Unable to contain his joy, Lucel regained his composure.\nIn response to the question of what exactly the Tournament Hall was, Lucel spoke. His words were filled with anticipation.\n\u201cWhen the Master of Magic is absent, one of the magicians on the eighth step enters the central sanctuary and becomes the representative of the ninth step.\u201d\nOf course, this was a story that existed only in the western continent. In the eastern continent, it was customary for the magician on the highest step to lead the order and pass on the position when a higher-ranking magician appeared.\n\u201cThe Tournament Hall takes place once a year. During that time, the guardian of the ninth step is entrusted with creating a magic stone. It is a task that requires the condensation of pure magical power and is difficult to accomplish without being a magician of the higher steps.\u201d\nLucel looked at Lorna and her shadow with eyes filled with admiration.\n\u201cOf course, the Master of Magic could simply place a paw on the magic circle, and that alone would be sufficient,\u201d Lucel said.\nAs if understanding Lucel\u2019s narrative, Belle suddenly popped out and nestled into Lorna\u2019s arms. Lucel bowed deeply to Belle.\n\u201cMeow!\u201d\nFeeling unusually cheerful today, Belle lifted her head as high as she could and reciprocated Lucel\u2019s greeting.\n\u201cIs it an important event?\u201d Lorna asked.\nLucel deeply nodded in response to Lorna\u2019s question.\n\u201cYes, indeed. Although they are bound by the name of the deity, magicians, by nature, tend to be strongly individualistic. Calling upon such individuals in the name of the deity once a year, can it be taken lightly?\u201d\nLucel\u2019s serious words seemed devoid of falsehood.\nLorna smiled in an embarrassed manner. Nabel, as if dismissing such an event, casually remarked that it was nothing. It was as if he was implying that he didn\u2019t have to participate if he didn\u2019t want to.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

He was the Emperor of the Western Empire, capable of fulfilling any desire he had.\n\u201cEspecially when the Master of Magic personally hosts the Tournament Hall, the significance becomes profound.\u201d\nLucel\u2019s words were not yet finished. Lorna\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cThe magical stones created by the deities contain the purest magical power, which is used to construct the protective enchantments of each temple.\u201d\nLucel, who had tidied his beard a few times, concluded his explanation.\n\u201cAs consumables, if the deity\u2019s master does not appear for a long time, the temple\u2019s mages have to maintain the magical barriers to the extent that\u2026\u201d\nLucel chose his words carefully. Ever since the deity\u2019s master entered the palace, there had been increased interaction between the Zeroth Order Knights and the Tower of Mages.\nOriginally, they had been like chickens and ducks, not paying much attention to each other, but now that the owner of the Divine Beast had entered the palace, they had no choice but to interact.\nThanks to that, Lucel felt like he had picked up some strange habits. If it were Nessa, she would have said something like this.\n\u201cBecause the mages are going out.\u201d\nYes, just like that\u2026 Lucel was taken aback by his own thoughtlessness. Lorna, too, widened her eyes and looked to the side.\nApproaching, Nessa bowed deeply.\n\u201cI apologize for interrupting your conversation. It seems that Lucel is having difficulty continuing his speech.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\nLorna smiled softly.\n\u201cBut what brings you here?\u201d\nLorna and Lucel were conversing on the upper part of the ninth staircase of the Tower of Mages. Unless Lorna had business with her, there was no reason for her to come here.\n\u201cHis Majesty has commanded me to deliver the list of participants for the upcoming tournament to you, Lorna. He said you can make any changes if there are any inconvenient names.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna accepted the list.\nLorna looked at Nabele\u2019s handwriting, which she had seen many times on his desk. It was a rather flashy handwriting, with the pen\u2019s tip slightly sticking out, rather than being neat.\nNevertheless, it was not difficult to read.\nAs if Nabele had read Lorna\u2019s mind, she had separated the mages from the Eastern Continent and the Western Continent. She must have known that Lorna disliked the arrival of people from the Eastern Continent.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nSo, if it bothers you, you can skip it.\nTake whatever you want.\nYou would have said that if you were here. Lorna felt as if she could hear his voice in her ear.\nThe choice was hers. She pushed aside the list of mages from the Eastern Continent. Her hand and eyes eventually found the unwanted names.\nThere was no joy in coming. It was a suffocating nightmare just to think about it.\nBut she would not be able to do anything. It wasn\u2019t as terrifying as the last time. As Nabel had predicted, the first person she locked eyes with was Lady Rida, the Countess.\nIt was true. The one holding the leash was herself.\n\u201cIs there any other meaning to giving the magic stone at the Contest Hall?\u201d Lorna asked, turning to Lucel. Lucel\u2019s eyes widened, and he bowed his head.\n\u201cIt is essentially a symbol of reconciliation. It is no different from an invitation to enter the embrace of the gods. Giving the magic stone means sharing the touch of the divine.\u201d\nIn that case, excluding specific temples was not a particularly admirable sight. Above all, it was the first Contest Hall since Lorna became the mistress of the gods.\nIt was only natural that it would affect her public image. Even Lorna, who had spent almost her entire life in the mansion, could understand that much.\nLorna handed the list over to Nisha.\nHer mind was made up.\n\u201cSummon them all.\u201d\nNisha\u2019s eyes widened.\nIt was somewhat surprising to see her composed appearance. Like a vigilant knight, he remembered Lorna\u2019s moments of hesitation whenever Lady Rida\u2019s story was mentioned.\n\u201c\u2026I will obey the orders.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\nLorna\u2019s words were not finished. She turned to the silent escort knights and Nisha behind her.\n\u201cIn order to prevent any suspicious acts at the Contest Hall, can we monitor a few individuals?\u201d\nHer gaze, in particular, was fixed on the Zero Order Knights. Strangely, her heart pounded with tension. She could almost hear the sound of her heartbeat in her ears.\nNabel had clearly told her to handle the Zero Order Knights as if they were subordinates, but she was accustomed to being refused.\nThose who had to obey her gaze showed their discontent. And that was what scared Lorna the most.\nMore precisely, it was the gaze she least desired in this palace, which she wanted to be her new sanctuary. Her gaze pierced through Nisha.\n\u201cOf course. I will select and monitor those who are most likely to be covert and elusive. Whom would you like me to keep an eye on?\u201d\nHowever, Nisha accepted the order naturally. There was not a hint of dissatisfaction or negative emotion in his eyes.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHer racing heart found solace. Lorna blinked and smiled.\nShe reached out her hand to Nisha, who effortlessly handed over the list of individuals from the Eastern Continent Temple.\n\u201cHere are the people from this place, the Southern Temple. And if possible, could you investigate the individuals from the Southern Temple as well as those who have recently been in contact with them?\u201d\n\u201cIs it too much?\u201d She scrutinized Nisha once again.\nHer command was no different from instructing her to compile a list of the Southern Temple and the recent Temple contacts until the Eastern District.\nBut Nisha accepted it as a matter of course.\n\u201cI will take on the task.\u201d\nWhile it may have seemed like a rushed schedule to Lorna, it was not so for Nisha. They were individuals who had rolled under the neck of a master whose life hung by a thread, unless they turned the impossible into possible. This timeframe was not even remotely tight.\nOf course, that didn\u2019t mean they had time to spare.\n\u201cI will prepare immediately.\u201d\nHe bowed to Lorna and quickly stepped back. Lorna watched his retreating figure and smiled.\nIt was a somewhat relieved expression.\nThe event was approaching.\nUntil then, Lorna could afford to be somewhat at ease.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

She had mentioned that unless one possessed the ability to wield magic, they could not impede the person holding the magic stone.\nWhile the knights possessed basic magical skills, their proficiency was inevitably different from those who bore the title of a sorcerer.\nNo, in the first place, they could not be considered sorcerers as they merely utilized their magical power for momentary bursts of strength.\n\u201cThe owner of the divine creature\u2026\u201d\nTherefore, most of the knights present could be ignored, and one should be cautious of the owner of the divine creature and the sorcerers beyond the seventh step.\n\u201cI already said that. During this tournament\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure about this? You have never participated in a tournament on the continent before.\u201d\n\u201cChoose your words carefully. Even if the owner of the divine creature is from the continent\u2026\u201d\nThe bickering handmaidens near the Duchess failed to notice Lady Rida\u2019s approach. It was due to the transparent invisibility spell she had cast.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. You might not know how to create magic stones. Imagine how troublesome that would be.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026 I won\u2019t be like that again. Always worrying. When the divine creature is present\u2026\u201d\nAs the handmaidens whispered among themselves, they passed by Lady Rida\u2019s side. It was possible because it was not the corridors of the palace but the maids\u2019 corridors. Lady Rida clicked her tongue as she witnessed their behaviour.\nEven if they were palace maids, they weren\u2019t anything special.\nIt was inevitable that laughter escaped. It was said that those who entered the palace could at least protect their own bodies to some extent.\n\u201cSo, avoid getting too close. Especially the knights, as they may not recognize magic, but they can hear.\u201d\nThe assistant was timid despite possessing such vast magical power.\nThey could act more boldly.\nWhat else could be on their mind?\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe gazed down at the magic stone the assistant had given her.\nIt emitted a faint light and shimmered in her hands. At first glance, it seemed like an ordinary object, but it had teleported Lady Rida, the Countess, more than eight times and even pierced through the barrier of the palace to cast the invisibility spell upon her.\nThis was the true power of a sorcerer.\nIt was a genuine power different from those who had become pseudo-sorcerers by obtaining some nonsensical divine creature.\n\u201cFor now\u2026\u201d\nWhere and to what extent could she freely use magic?\nLady Rida turned her gaze back. She gestured to one of the handmaidens who was busy praising the owner of the divine creature.\n[Whisper]\nA barely audible sound echoed through the corridor, only reaching her. Then, a faint mist-like substance extended from her fingertips, enveloping the handmaiden. It was a subtle change that someone with poor eyesight would not even notice.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nHowever, the response was swift. The handmaiden suddenly stood upright, causing the other handmaiden engaged in conversation to look at her.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe young maid, who was called Azaline, momentarily lost focus in her eyes before regaining it.\n\u201cAzaline?\u201d\nThe maid who called out to her thought Azaline\u2019s eyes briefly shimmered with a silvery light.\nWas it a trick of the mind?\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nAzaline shook her head a few times. She regained her composure and smiled.\n\u201cI\u2019m just a bit tired.\u201d\n\u201cYou frightened me. Still, it\u2019s fortunate that it happened here. If it had occurred while attending the esteemed guests, it would have caused quite a problem.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\nAzaline laughed and walked away with the maid. Lady Rida, the Countess, discreetly gestured to the empty air. Her fingertips glistened with a silvery light, emerging from the magic stone.\n\u201cGo to the dining hall right away.\u201d\nShe commanded the empty air. The command was immediately conveyed to Azaline. After a brief pause, Azaline spoke to the maid beside her.\n\u201cI will stop by the dining hall for a moment.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Why? There was no such command.\u201d\nAzaline smiled.\n\u201cI am in charge of serving refreshments to the distinguished guests.\u201d\nIt was a natural excuse. The maid next to her was surprised and lightly tapped her on the back.\n\u201cThen, you should hurry and tell them! Go quickly!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d\nAzaline crossed the corridor with quick steps. Her eyes shimmered once again with a silvery light.\nIt\u2019s too easy, isn\u2019t it?\nLady Rida, who had been observing the two, chuckled silently.\nUnaware that the magic stone embedded in her possession was quietly fading away.\n\u00a0\n***\nThe dawn of the competition day broke.\nLorna greeted the morning with a brighter face than usual. The fragrance released by the handmaidens, specially chosen to calm her nerves before the grand event, proved to be of great assistance.\nOf course, there was someone else who brought her even greater solace.\nA joyous countenance greeted her as soon as she opened her eyes.\nLorna gazed intently at Nabel\u2019s face, which sparkled under the radiant sunlight.\nWith closed eyes, his serene and peaceful slumber reminded her of the young boy he used to be. As his usual frigid gaze, exhibited to others, was concealed, his true self emerged before Lorna\u2014the young boy she knew.\nUnconsciously, Lorna reached out her hand toward his forehead.\nSoft golden locks flowed through her fingers.\nAnd the moment she withdrew her hand, clear eyes looked up at her.\n\u201cOh, are you awake?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nNabel responded in a hushed voice, audible only to her. Lorna removed her hand with an apologetic expression.\n\u201cI woke you up.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d\nHe caught the hand that was receding.\nThe warmth encircling her wrist was fervent. He briefly pressed his lips against the inside of her wrist, now pleasantly warmed by the sun.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been awake for quite some time.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s reply made Lorna blink.\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you get up?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Nabel gently pressed his hand against her shoulder.\n\u201cIf there is something to be received, shall I take it on your behalf?\u201d he offered.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s my request, so I should handle it personally,\u201d Lorna replied.\nRising to her feet, Lorna found Lin standing silently by the corner of the room, presenting her with a glass of water.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she expressed her gratitude.\nWith a warm smile, Lorna accepted the glass, her shoulder adorned with a long cardigan.\nAcknowledging Lin\u2019s gesture, Lorna motioned for her to open the door. Standing outside, Nisha held a few reports in her hands.\n\u201cGreetings to the master\u2026 the lord,\u201d Nisha said.\nUnder Nabel\u2019s gaze, Nisha\u2019s tongue nearly twisted in her mouth.\nNo, she definitely slept in His Majesty\u2019s bedroom until early morning yesterday! When did this happen?\n\u201cHave you completed the tasks I entrusted to you?\u201d Lorna asked, feeling that it was improper to remain seated on the bed. She attempted to rise.\nNisha startled, kneeling at the entrance of the room. If he didn\u2019t enter the room, there was no need for Lorna to leave the bed. It was a natural consideration for someone of higher status.\nMeanwhile, the reports Nisha brought were contained within the silver tray offered by Lin. Nisha had been reporting all this time.\n\u201cYes, I have replaced all the personnel related to the individuals you mentioned, including Lady Rida, focusing on the priests from the Eastern Continent,\u201d she stated.\nNabel had also heard this report before.\nHe couldn\u2019t remain ignorant of the movements of his knights.\nThe names she requested to be marked in the list.\nThey were all individuals associated with Lady Rida.\nFor instance, the priests affiliated with the Southern Continental Temple.\n\u201cNow you can receive reports on their movements whenever you desire,\u201d Nisha informed.\n\u201cWell done,\u201d Lorna acknowledged.\nClosing her eyes slowly and opening them again, Lorna reflected. Considering the incident at the last Matop, the knights were on high alert due to the news of outsiders arriving.\nThey would perform their escort duties exceptionally well.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNisha responded with a silent nod, her manners a sign of respect. As the briefing came to an end, Nabel finally spoke.\n\u201cThe First Brigade will block the ground route, while the Zero Brigade will block other areas. We must prepare for an aerial assault as well, considering that all those who are coming are wizards.\u201d\nHe turned to Lorna, and upon locking eyes, gave a brief smile before sending a chilling gaze back to Nisha.\n\u201cDo not forget that our adversary is a wizard beyond the eighth step.\u201d\nThe higher the level of a wizard, the more they used magic that defied common sense. And such individuals posed a formidable challenge for knights.\n\u201cWere there no specific advice from the Tower of Wizards?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Lucel of the eighth step promised to keep an eye on the magic flow near my residence, but\u2026\u201d\nIf the opponent was a wizard rivaling the master of divine beasts, Lucel wouldn\u2019t be able to detect everything.\nNabel narrowed his eyes. He had wanted to delay matters if possible, but Lorna was right\u2014it was an opportunity.\nNow, Zenas Miltan hadn\u2019t fully recovered his strength.\n\u201cAre you worried?\u201d\nLorna subtly nudged her hand forward, interrupting Nabel\u2019s train of thought. A cool gaze was blocked by her touch, and within her hand, he found a sweetness unmatched.\n\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t deny it.\u201d\nNabel felt it was an odd morning. When he opened his eyes, there was a pleasant person beside him, and the gentle morning sun poured down, creating a tranquil morning.\nHowever, a strange tension enveloped him.\nAs if he were in the midst of a battlefield.\nWhenever he felt that way, something unpleasant always happened.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t voice that foreboding feeling. Instead, he briefly kissed the tip of Lorna\u2019s nose.\n\u201cBe careful. And if you don\u2019t want to do it, you can back out now.\u201d\nAs I always say, I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re the master of divine beasts or not. The soft whisper tickled Lorna\u2019s ear.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a warm soup.\u201d\nLin subtly vacated the space between the two, briefly glancing at Nisha. It was evident that the two felt a peculiar sense of unity, being in each other\u2019s closest company.\nAs they were the closest attendants to each individual, it was only natural.\n\u201c\u2014I will instruct the knights once again to prioritize their safety.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nLorna replied softly, allowing Nisha to finish her report and withdraw. Nisha, along with Lin, left for the corridor.\n\u201cYou seem happy, and I\u2019m glad.\u201d\nOnce the door closed, only the two remained in the corridor, apart from the knights stationed there.\nNisha nodded in response to Lin\u2019s words.\nIt was at that moment, when he was about to reply.\nHe caught a strange scent.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nHaving spent a long time on the battlefield, he recognized that unpleasant odour. The smell of a long-abandoned battlefield.\nThe stench of decaying flesh.\nHe felt his vision blur slightly. A faint mist appeared.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

She was locked in her assigned room, with her eyes closed and deep in concentration since early morning. Wrapped in her blanket, she tightly gripped the magical stone provided by her accomplice. Due to the weak light, no radiance escaped from beneath the covers.\nbe careful\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere is\u2026 something here\u2026\u201d\nHer consciousness swiftly roamed the corridors of the palace. It moved with the freedom of mist, as if she herself had become the fog. It could pass through narrow gaps, whether it was a crack in a door or any other small opening. This was an exhilarating experience for Lady Lydia, the Countess.\nThe knights guarding the corridors day and night were rendered useless. The faint mist, carrying her consciousness, freely swirled through the palace in the early morning.\nUntil she found what she desired.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate to see you happy.\u201d\nFinally, she found what she had been searching for. More precisely, she found the one she sought.\nMaid Lin.\nThat was the only thing she remembered distinctly. Everyone had left the side of the accursed being, but Lin remained with it until the end. It was impure and ominous.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\nA target was chosen. The Countess closed her eyes and focused even more intensely. Unbeknownst to her, the magical stone within the blanket shimmered brighter.\nAlthough it was a considerable distance from the main palace, magic easily traversed the space. It was somewhat difficult to infiltrate when entering the main palace, as there might have been magical barriers on the walls, but that was all.\nThe most challenging part was back then, and everything that followed was a breeze. Even now, her movements were freer than ever before.\n\u201c!\u201d\nThe Countess, Lydia, tightly gripped the magical stone once again. It would be more convenient to obtain Lin, who was the closest to her, in order to eliminate the cursed one.\nAnd it would be the most amusing option.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nWith closed eyes, Lydia, the Countess, smiled silently. There was nothing a mere deity\u2019s owner could do, not a single thing. She observed Lin closely. Although the presence of the knight accompanying her was bothersome, he was not a wizard after all. Even if that knight were to figure it out, would he dare draw his sword in front of the Emperor?\nThat would already signify her victory.\nIt would be intriguing to witness Lorna\u2019s expression as she was attacked by the person she trusted the most. Lydia clenched her fist. Her mist-like vision rushed towards Lin.\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\nAt that moment, Lydia detected a peculiar smell once again.\nIt was a scent of decay.\n***\n\u201cWhat is this odour that lingers in the air?\u201d\nNisha surveyed her surroundings with a furrowed brow. It wasn\u2019t the smell of death that one would expect to encounter even in the most secure palace, let alone the royal palace, where safety should be paramount.\nIf someone had left a body to decay to the point where such a stench permeated the air, it was likely that their own life had not been spared.\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\nNisha\u2019s eyes narrowed as she scanned the area. Curiously, the surroundings seemed hazy.\nHazy? No, it felt as if a veil of mist had been cast over everything, obscuring the scene.\nAnd amidst that haze, she sensed an odd gaze, as if someone were watching from a distance.\nAlmost instinctively, she reached for the hilt of her sword. A metallic click resounded as it was released from its scabbard, resting against her hip.\n\u201cNisha, my lady?\u201d\nStartled, Lin turned to face Nisha.\nNisha extended her hand toward her, gesturing for her to remain still.\n\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\nIn that moment, Nisha distinctly saw a swirling mass of white smoke rushing toward her. It was a dense haze that an ordinary person would not even be able to perceive.\n[Whoosh!]\nThe crimson magic infused within Nisha\u2019s hair-like strands extended from her sword, reaching out.\n[Clang!]\nUpon collision with the smoke-like substance, the sword emitted a harsh, metallic sound, as if it had struck against metal.\n\u201cHa!\u201d\nNisha\u2019s sword pierced through the smoke, as if effortlessly cutting through an obstruction.\n[Sizzle]\nIn that instant, the air around them blackened. Along with it, a putrid stench that Nisha had been perceiving grew stronger.\nFurrowing her brow, Nisha took a step back.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nAlthough she did not know what sort of prank was being played, it was evident that anyone foolish enough to overlook the defensive capabilities of a knight within the palace walls was truly a fool.\nUndoubtedly, such a fool would be among the esteemed guests attending the tournament.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNisha squinted her eyes. She would need to closely monitor those individuals marked on the list provided by Lady Lorna.\nShe turned her gaze toward Lin.\n\u201cThere is nothing to worry about now.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nLin\u2019s eyes widened for a moment, her surprise evident.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nLin let out a short breath and smiled.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad nothing happened.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well.\u201d\nNisha scratched the back of her head.\nShe gestured to a knight standing further down the corridor.\nIt was better to convey instructions through hand signals at this distance. They couldn\u2019t risk disturbing the sweet moments of the two individuals in the room behind them.\n\u201cMaintain high vigilance in the vicinity and summon the wizards.\u201d\nThe knight across the hall nodded and promptly disappeared. Nisha surveyed her surroundings. The suspicious figures were no longer visible.\nStill, there was something strange. Nisha had made an impression.\n\u201cIt feels\u2026 unsettling in some way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Naturally, there were many people wandering around her. Lorna would take a quick breath and exhale whenever the wizards approached her.\nAlthough it was a small change, those who served her closely could not help but notice her tension.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, would you like to rest a bit?\u201d asked Lin cautiously. There were no wizards who would object to the owner of the divine beast resting. However, Lorna shook her head.\n\u201cThen it would be more exhausting,\u201d she replied. It was better to run until the end rather than run a little, rest, and then run again. Lorna knew that from her experience of running until her breath was caught in her throat.\nIt felt like she was chased by magic while in the mansion. Lorna caught a glimpse of the bracelet shimmering on the wizard\u2019s wrist. There were five of them.\n\u201cThey say a platter is prepared at the Wizard\u2019s Tower,\u201d reported Nell, her knight, as she approached. Lorna turned her gaze towards the direction where the people from the Wizard\u2019s Tower were.\nLorna could see the platter that Nell mentioned. It was an unfamiliar item, but its elaborate decorations made it easily recognizable.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna recalled the schedule of the tournament that she had looked up before she arrived.\nThe schedule was simple.\nDepending on the preferences of the person leading the tournament, a few additional items might be added, but Lorna had no intention of prolonging the tournament.\nWhen the bell created a magic stone on the platter, it would be distributed to the approaching people one by one. After everyone received their share and left, Lorna would say a few words of blessing, and that would be the end.\nThe problem was that the words of blessing had a significant political element mixed in. It was said that it revealed the direction in which the owner of the divine beast would lead the temple in the future.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna couldn\u2019t help but feel burdened. If she were someone who was born and raised on the mainland and knew what people needed, the burden might have been slightly lighter.\nBut she was a person from the eastern continent and knew very little about the mainland. Above all, it was most burdensome to think that numerous people would be moved by just a few words.\n\u201cMay I assist you?\u201d Nabel asked.\nHe knew her well. She smiled.\nIn the early morning, when they woke up together, Nabel lightly touched her greetings for the tournament.\nHe had always been someone who stood in front of many people.\n\u201cWhen Fel was here, the direction of research for that year was determined by what the owner of the divine beast wanted,\u201d he said.\nPerhaps it wouldn\u2019t be any different this time, as the owner of the divine beast was hosting the tournament. Nabel spoke in a calm voice.\n\u201cWhat kind of magic would you like to be researched?\u201d\nLorna didn\u2019t hesitate to answer.\n\u201cDefensive magic.\u201d\n\u201cThen, let\u2019s include that\u2026\u201d\nNabel exchanged greetings skillfully, which made Lorna smile as she pondered him. Then, she reached into her pocket and took out the note she had secretly tucked away.\nNo, she attempted to retrieve it.\n\u201cUh\u2026?\u201d\nHer inner pocket was empty, and she widened her eyes in surprise.\n\u201cMiss?\u201d\nLin immediately asked her.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nLorna turned to Lin with a bewildered expression.\n\u201cI had a note that Nabel gave me during the day, but I must have left it behind.\u201d\nThe general content of the congratulatory message that Nabel had touched remained in her mind. However, the problem was whether she could articulate it smoothly in front of others.\n\u201cAh\u2026 I will quickly go and fetch it.\u201d\n\u201cBut the event is about to start\u2026\u201d\nLorna scanned her surroundings with an embarrassed face.\nEven if all the temples in the competition area participated, only one representative from each temple would come forward to receive the magic stone. It was clear that it wouldn\u2019t take as long as she initially thought.\nIt was right after that realization that the greetings took place. Lorna found herself in a dilemma.\n[Clank]\nA person gracefully descended from the high ceiling, causing those around Lorna to step back in surprise.\n\u201cOh!\u201d\nSome of the sluggish wizards fell clumsily, living up to their reputation.\nThe one who descended from the ceiling was none other than Tanya.\nFeeling somewhat apprehensive about her graceful descent, Lorna wore a slightly perplexed expression.\n\u201c\u2026Tanya?\u201d\nShe had always been hidden in the shadows.\nNo, she had been so inconspicuous that it was confusing to determine if she was even present. It wasn\u2019t a common occurrence for her to reveal herself like this.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nGracefully nodding, Tanya suddenly extended something to Lorna. It was none other than the note that Lorna had left behind.\n\u201c\u2026Ah, you took care of it.\u201d\nLorna smiled broadly.\nTanya appeared more aloof than anyone else.\nIt seemed like she didn\u2019t care about anything else and would only focus on the task assigned to her.\nShe was that kind of person, but she seemed a little different.\nAfter Tanya handed her the note and briefly greeted her, she quietly gazed at Lorna\u2019s face for a moment. Then, she turned her gaze aside and disappeared.\nIt was unclear where she had vanished once again.\nAs the gazes of the Zero Knights briefly shifted to the ceiling and then back down, it was presumed that she had ascended to the ceiling.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nA faint smile appeared on Lorna\u2019s face. It was an expression of gratitude that might have reached Tanya\u2019s ears. Lorna tightly held the note.\nAt that moment, Belle\u2019s front paw accidentally landed on the magical tray that had been delivered to her. Belle, who had appeared without warning, perched on Lorna\u2019s shoulder.\n[Ting!]\nReacting to the magical tray, Belle\u2019s magic began to form a sharp crystalline structure.\nIt was a magic stone.\n\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\nThe sorcerers\u2019 expressions mixed with awe filled the air.\nIt marked the beginning of the competition arena.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

It was because he couldn\u2019t feel any weight at all.\nHowever, Shinsoo was the embodiment of magic. When the purest magical power in the world touched it, the magical platter reacted instantly.\n\u201cVoila!\u201d\nThe jewel-encrusted silver platter gleamed brightly. The light was so intense that people couldn\u2019t even look directly at it. In the midst of it, a crystalline form began to take shape.\nAt first, it shimmered in pure white, but gradually the radiance diminished, and it shone brilliantly with iridescent colours.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna exclaimed, unaware of her own amazement.\nThe round, perfectly crafted magical stone had no blemishes, as if it had been meticulously sculpted by a master.\nThe gazes of the magicians turned toward her.\nThis event was entirely led by the masters who owned Shinsoo. As it was customary for knights to step back, the members of the Zeroth Order stood a few steps behind her.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIn her place, Nabel stood. It was possible that someone might think the Emperor of the Western Empire, known as the Inspector, had no relevance to this event.\nHowever, the one leading this tournament was the owner of Shinsoo. Even if we disregard the personal relationship between the owner of Shinsoo and Emperor Nabel Iber, the pure-hearted Iber had been with the previous owner of Shinsoo.\nTherefore, no one found it awkward for Nabel to be by her side.\n\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d\nNabel placed his hand on Lorna\u2019s shoulder. It was a feeling of relief as the tension in her heavily burdened shoulders eased a little. There were too many people.\nStanding in front of so many people still didn\u2019t feel familiar. I felt as if someone among them would bear ill will towards me.\nNo, it was likely that they would bear ill will.\nLorna\u2019s gaze fell on the people of the Eastern Continent Temple, especially Lady Lida.\nEven among the unfamiliar atmosphere of the tournament, she stood out particularly among the people of the Eastern Continent Temple.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nLady Lydia flinched. As expected, she was the first to avert her gaze.\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s fine,\u201d she finally replied to Lorna. It felt as if a warm hand resting on her shoulder was supporting her from behind.\n\u201cWell then, please have one representative from each temple step forward,\u201d Lorna\u2019s voice echoed with a touch of enchantment, resonating slightly louder. There seemed to be no confusion as to whether there were already designated individuals from each temple.\nThe people standing in line before Lorna sparkled with childlike excitement in their eyes. People from different temples exchanged smiles and whispered to each other.\n\u201cFor many years to come, you needn\u2019t worry,\u201d a very soft voice reached Nabel\u2019s ears, but the mage\u2019s words were distinctly clear. Lorna could tell from his expression aLorna that the mage felt visibly relieved. It must have been because of this magical stone.\nLorna looked down at the magic stone she held cautiously, fearing that it might leave a mark. During the preparations for the competition, the Tower\u2019s people had shared various information. One of them was that in temples located in regions abundant with monsters, this stone was used to preserve the boundaries around the temples.\n\u201cMay the blessings of Tuna be with you!\u201d\nThe first person who received the magic stone from her was a priest from a temple in the northern part of the continent. Six bracelets jingled on his wrist. He lowered his head before Lorna, with a look of awe as if he had just met the emperor.\n\u201cThank you so much!\u201d\nThe others who followed suit were the same. Each received a magic stone from her, expressing their gratitude while invoking the blessings of Tuna.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAlthough she had heard plenty of talk about heretics, cursed demons, and the like, she had rarely experienced receiving blessings. It felt somewhat unfamiliar.\n\u201c\u2026May the blessings of the gods be with you.\u201d\nThe last person to approach was a priest from a temple in the southern part of the continent. It was not Lady Lydia, but someone closely associated with her.\nLorna had clearly witnessed Lady Lydia and this priest exchanging a few words earlier. Naturally, the priest\u2019s presence could not help but seem suspicious.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nPerhaps that was the reason, but the priest gave off a different impression compared to the other priests. Lorna hesitated for a moment when their hands touched. A strange smell reached her nose.\nIt was different from a foul odour.\n\u201cA scent that seems to cling if you smell it for a long time\u2026\u201d\nBefore she could ponder further, the priest took a step back and withdrew from her. At that moment, Nisha turned to face Lorna.\nHe was on guard, scanning the surroundings. Lorna didn\u2019t know, but the scent was the same as the one Nisha had encountered in the corridors of the palace earlier.\nAlong with the mist.\nNisha\u2019s eyes narrowed.\n***\n\u201cBestowing such divine blessings upon us, particularly the priests of the Eastern Temple will be delighted. Ever since your return to the side of Lord Tuna after your departure from Mr. Fel, the turmoil has never ceased\u2026\u201d\nThe priest of the Central Temple in the West bowed his head several times.\nOn the other hand, the priests of the Eastern Temple wore an uneasy expression.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nEven if it was called a gathering, it was the first time they received magic stones. The owner of the former Divine Beast, Fel, never shared magic stones with the priests of the Eastern Temple.\nNo, in the first place, the existence of magic stones was unknown in the Eastern Continent.\nThe Western Continent invited the Eastern Continent\u2019s priests to the gathering hall, but the same applied. In the first place, the gathering hall was merely a symbolic event indicating a change in ownership of the Central Temple, with no distribution involved. It was purely a ceremonial event.\nTherefore, only one high-ranking priest from the Eastern Continent would occasionally cross Pinnacle Bridge and stay in the Western Continent. Even then, since the people of the Western Continent did not welcome the people from the Eastern Continent, it ended as a ceremonial event.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\nThe priest from the Eastern Continent received the message with a sense of unease. Beside her stood a fox that shimmered without a shadow.\n\u201cDivine Beast\u2026\u201d\nThe sorcerer murmured softly.\nThere were many who wanted to see the owner of the Divine Beast who had brought about miracles in the Eastern Continent. It was different this time.\nEven though they didn\u2019t know what the owner of the Divine Beast was like, rumours spread all the way to the Eastern Continent as if the collapsed tower had been restored, as if turning back time.\n\u201cHow did the rumour spread so quickly?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "108": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-108/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe priest from the Eastern Continent found it strange. But just like him, the Eastern Continent priests didn\u2019t care how the rumours spread.\nThose rumours even made the frail sorcerers choose a treacherous voyage instead of Pinnacle Bridge, which had already been closed, to come to the Western Continent.\nAs a result, there was an overflow of people who wanted to see the Ninth Stair\u2019s Archmage.\nOf course, they were also sorcerers, so the favourable tailwind raised by magic made the journey relatively smooth, but the sea between the Eastern and Western Continents was still vast and rough.\n\u201cThank you for coming such a long way.\u201d\nLorna did not wear nine bracelets on her wrist. Above all, it made her uncomfortable.\nInstead, the shadowless Divine Beast, Belle, accompanied her.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter a few formal exchanges, Lorna stood on the dais again. As before, Nabel stood behind her.\nShe unfolded a note and looked at Nabel.\nNabel smiled lightly.\nPeople who witnessed the melting smile of the Emperor of the Western Empire unknowingly widened their eyes.\nOf course, those gazes reached Lorna as well. Nabel once again looked ahead with a cold, sunken gaze.\n\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d\nLorna, with a poised demeanour, began to speak. Although reading from a note, he desired to convey his words as naturally as possible.\n\u201cTo all of you who have come this far, I express my deepest gratitude. As the owner of Shinsoo, I am delighted to be able to successfully open the inaugural tournament.\u201d\nLorna smiled warmly, recalling the words he had written and shared with her that morning.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to make mistakes. If you ever feel overwhelmed, like you can\u2019t go on, like this.\u201d\nLorna tightly grasped her hand.\nIn that moment, the warmth of their touch seemed to linger. Perhaps the message conveyed through their hands back then had been comforting.\nHowever, she had more to say than what Nabel had written for her. Above all else, she knew that the tournament grounds were not insignificant, contrary to Nabel\u2019s casual remark.\nEspecially the first tournament ground, which would reveal the inclinations of the leader of this new temple.\nLorna recalled the greeting given by Fell, the former owner of the divine beast, as mentioned by Lucel. She clenched her fist and then released it.\nWords flowed more naturally now.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that both the Western and Eastern continents have many regions suffering from the torment inflicted by monsters. Above all, it seems urgent this year to advance barrier-type magic in order to protect people from these monsters. Especially with the use of this magic stone.\u201d\nShe held the magic stone in her hand, its radiant light shimmering.\n\u201cPlease dedicate yourselves to research, aiming to create a sturdy magical barrier while minimizing the consumption of magical power.\u201d\nThe topic of the magic stone was not mentioned in the note Nabel had written. Although her voice trembled slightly, she spoke with a natural elegance. Nabel\u2019s eyes widened a bit, but he did not interrupt her, as if it were only natural.\n\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\nLorna glanced at the note and spoke in a hushed voice,\n\u201cI heard there were issues regarding heretics at the Continental Shrine. Of course, I trust that they were handled well at the Central Shrine, but there might be problems in the Western Continent as well. Please keep your minds firm, especially in light of this.\u201d\nThe people of the continent bowed their heads. It was the ninth step sorcerer who spoke, not just anyone. The highest-ranking sorcerer outside of the Eastern and Western Continents, the one closest to the gods\u2014his words couldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t blame the people of the continent. They held up well despite the turmoil.\u201d\nLorna smiled slyly. It was something not mentioned in Nabel\u2019s note.\n\u201cBut from now on, I publicly declare that we will thoroughly eradicate the heretics.\u201d\nHer voice, amplified by magic, trembled ever so slightly. It was a minute change that only Nabel would notice.\nNabel wrapped his arm around her waist.\nThere was no concern about being seen by the sorcerers in front, obscured by the high dais.\nLorna smiled slyly at his gentle touch. Her smile appeared serene to the sorcerers.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\nThe contents of the note were now concluded. All that remained was to ask them to enjoy the gathering.\nHowever, Lorna broached a different subject.\n\u201cOne last thing.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s eyes widened. It was because he couldn\u2019t anticipate what she was about to say this time.\n\u201cThe situation of the royal family in the Western Continent has been chaotic for the past decade.\u201d\nNabel turned to look at her. The gazes of the sorcerers also fell upon the pristine Iber on her side. The white gloves and bright blond hair gleamed under the chandelier\u2019s light.\n\u201cThe continent\u2019s people have suffered greatly. But now, we will ensure that such things never happen again.\u201d\nLorna spoke in a composed voice. It was a much steadier voice than before.\nShe wanted to say these words in front of others, more than anything.\nFor a long time.\n\u201cI, Lorna, the owner of divine power\u2014\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t bother to add her surname. She hadn\u2019t become \u201cFon Iber\u201d yet, but she didn\u2019t want to use the name \u201cDe Rida\nEven without that name, she could stand in this position.\nShe didn\u2019t have to be De Rida. She stood here as the owner of divine power, thanks to her abilities.\n\u201cI will protect and safeguard the pristine Iber as the owner of divine power.\u201d\nThose words carried a different weight when spoken privately to Nabel and when spoken in an official setting.\nNabel\u2019s eyes widened.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "109": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-109/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI, as the owner of the deity, will protect and preserve the pure Ib\u00e9r.\u201d\nAs the chairman\u2019s quiet voice reverberated, Nabel\u2019s eyes widened.\nHer words were far from casual.\nShe was the owner of the ninth staircase, the one closest to the gods, surpassing all the sorcerers on the continent.\nNo sorcerer who did not serve as the owner of the deity, lending their power from the gods, existed anywhere.\nTherefore, her words were nothing less than a declaration that the temples and all the sorcerers must maintain a close relationship with the Ib\u00e9r royal family of the Western Empire.\nOf course, the Grand Sorcerer Fel had already done so, so there were no political issues. However, there was another problem: all the sorcerers were assigned a task, as if it were a given.\n\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d\nA hushed whisper spread among the people. As they turned to look at each other and moved their bodies, the rustling of their long robe hems filled the chamber, mingling with the sound of bracelets jingling on their wrists, creating a louder noise than expected.\n\u201cAre you not commanding us to capture the rebels of the Miltan family?\u201d\nThat was what the sorcerers were thinking.\nThe rumour that the emperor of the Western Empire had already beheaded the sorcerer who had destroyed the Matap was known to those in the know.\nThe owner of the deity protects the Ib\u00e9r royal family.\nTherefore, they must reject the Miltan family and make an effort to capture anyone associated with them, wherever they may be, within the reach of the temple\u2019s energy.\nThe meaning of those words silently spread among the people. The gaze of several sorcerers nodded toward the owner of the deity.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThere was no falsehood in their confident gazes. The gaze of others turned toward the sorcerers of the Matap.\n\u201cDid you already know?\u201d\nPriests from elsewhere also asked Lucel. Lucel lightly nodded his head. Of course, it was obvious.\nThere had been a history of conflict between the emperor and the owner of the temple, but now it was different. The Matap was the place where exceptionally skilled sorcerers in the Western Empire gathered. It was only natural that their response would be taken for granted, so the murmurs of the people gradually subsided.\nThey naturally fortified their hearts. They would follow the child of the gods.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHowever, the sorcerers from the Eastern Continent were slightly different.\n\u201cNo matter if she is the owner of the ninth staircase\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt is said that the atmosphere in the Western Continent is somewhat different from ours.\u201d\nMany believed that it was right for the relationship between the temple and the nobility to be separate on the Eastern Continent. As a result, the glances exchanged between them were complex.\nEspecially among the people from the southern region of the Eastern Continent.\nLady Rida, the Countess, had a furrowed brow. Lorna clearly witnessed that expression.\nIt was the expression one had when angry.\nBut it wasn\u2019t frightening.\nLorna tightly clenched her clothes. Nabel\u2019s warm hand covered hers.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nLorna called out to him in a small voice. Although her heart raced with tension as the sorcerers lined up before her, when she looked at him, it felt as if she had entered a different space, a feeling of reassurance.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna observed him silently. She wondered if he would feel uncomfortable after making such a strong statement in a formal setting.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nInstead of saying anything lengthy, Nabel gently enclosed Lorna\u2019s hand in both of his own.\nShe wanted to ask why he did it, but her delicate sister still had many things to worry about. Therefore, she swallowed her words.\nThe owner of the Sacred Beast protects the Iberian royal family.\nPolitically, it was a very favourable development.\nThe era of Archmage Fel and the former emperors was being revived.\nThere were many who remembered that glorious time before they were attacked by Miltan.\nThe anticipation of another stable era would further intensify the atmosphere of the Empire.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nBut Nabel didn\u2019t desire that.\nThere will always be someone who dislikes a famous person.\nIf one attracts attention from many people, no matter what they do, someone will inevitably dislike them. Whether it be due to their actions, words, or jealousy of their honour, it could be anything.\nThat\u2019s why Nabel wanted to hide Lorna as much as possible.\nHe wanted to confine her to a small, secluded world where only he could see her.\nAt least Nabel himself wouldn\u2019t pose a threat to her.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nBut Lorna had her own life, and it was her choice.\nI didn\u2019t want you to have enemies.\nSince the owner of the Sacred Beast declared to protect the Iberian royal family, she had essentially gained enemies. Those who opposed the Iberian royal family would target the owner of the Sacred Beast first.\nJust like when Iberian royal family fell when Archmage Fel died, they were seeking another opportunity.\n\u201cIt was a momentous decision, you know,\u201d Nabel whispered in a low voice.\nLorna slowly closed and opened her eyes. The radiant light of the chandelier touched her long eyelashes.\nNabel\u2019s hand moved towards her eye.\nTo the one who had grown weary from speaking in front of many people, especially those wizards who still evoked fear in her heart, he wanted to convey more warmth.\nAnd he wanted to reassure her.\nI am here.\nEven if you collapse, crumble, and come under attack, I will be by your side.\nYou won\u2019t have to bear sadness alone.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nIf I am inadequate and end up causing your demise, I will, at the very least, die after you.\nThe person you cherish the most will never leave your side, even if it means that.\n***\nIt was a moonlit night. Lorne gazed up at the round, full moon.\nThe trembling moments quickly passed. She replayed my words in her mind countless times, wondering if there was a mistake.\nEvery word, every expression, was a cause for concern.\n\u201cI, Lorne, as the owner of Shinsoo, shall protect and safeguard the purity of Eber.\u201d\nPerhaps I appeared too arrogant.\nDid people secretly mock me? How dare I claim to protect the purity of Eber.\nNabel was a man who had risen to power through his own strength. He surely hadn\u2019t relied solely on the protection of others. The countless scars on his body testified to that fact.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nDid I misspeak after all?\nSleep eluded her. Lorne turned her body away from the balcony.\n\u201cAre you retiring for the night?\u201d\nLin, who stood behind her, asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nLorne lowered her head. There was a place she wanted to go.\n\u201cWould you like to accompany me?\u201d\nCould she go there now?\nShe couldn\u2019t help but have cautious thoughts. Though it seemed deserted.\nLin\u2019s eyes widened as she followed Lorne\u2019s gaze.\n\u201cThe greenhouse?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe wanted to see it.\nThere was no greenhouse in the Rita Mansion, so it would be an unseen spectacle even on the continent. But in her restless and dizzy state of mind, the verdant plants seemed ideal.\n\u201cPrepare yourself,\u201d Lorne commanded.\nLin turned towards the outside. When she knocked on the door, the zeroth knight, Nen, bowed his head.\n\u201cI will prepare immediately.\u201d\nHis voice was low as he replied. It seemed that even the slightest movement became cumbersome for many. Watching that, Lorne unknowingly felt herself shrink.\n\u201cMiss?\u201d\nLin approached her, suddenly close. Lorne flinched and took a step back.\n\u201cLin?\u201d\n\u201cAre you tangled in complicated thoughts again?\u201d\nLin laughed refreshingly.

As she straightened her dress, Lorne smiled.\n\u201cEveryone is pleased to have you here. Don\u2019t you know that I never lie?\u201d\nHer clear laughter was beautiful. Lorne smiled. It was the first time tonight that a smile bloomed on her face.\n\u201cThank you, Lin.\u201d\nNabel and Lin. The people she loved.\nAnd precious individuals who understood her better than anyone else.\nLorne stepped out of the room.\nTwo knights, who were responsible for guarding her through the early morning hours, followed closely behind her.\n***\n\u201cThe Greenhouse\u2026\u201d\nIt was an impressive place with its transparent walls. From the balcony of the room, I hadn\u2019t realized the abundance of plants beyond the clear walls until I approached them closely.\nTrue to its royal management, there was no sound when the door opened. Beyond the door, quietly opened by the hands of Knight Neun, a path stretched out.\n[Squeak]\nIn that instant, the light flickered on. As the door opened, the magical lamps inside the greenhouse responded, bathing the room in light. It wasn\u2019t an intense brightness, perhaps to consider the well-being of the plants.\nBut at night, it was sufficiently radiant.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nNow I could see that even from a distant building, one would know that there were people inside the greenhouse. The thought of turning back crossed my mind at that moment.\n\u201cShall I brighten the lights a bit more?\u201d\nNeun asked. The lights being turned on didn\u2019t seem to bother her at all. I let out a short breath.\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s fine.\u201d\nCuriously, my heart began to beat. It felt as if I were doing something forbidden.\nI felt timid, just like the day I first arrived at the palace.\nNo, perhaps I hadn\u2019t changed at all since that day.\nI took a step forward. As I entered the greenhouse, the wide leaves of the plants welcomed me.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nThe neatly arranged plants on both sides of the path seemed disorderly at first glance. However, the refreshing air seemed to lighten my mood. I took a deep breath.\nIt feels like my mind is clearing up a bit.\nShe took another step inward. As she did, she noticed a space filled with water, emitting a moist smell.\nThere was even the sound of water gently moving. It seemed to be a contraption to prevent the water from stagnating. Floating above it were wide leaf-like structures.\n\u201cWow.\u201d\nShe stood still, her mouth agape. Could she step on that and cross the water? She momentarily entertained a childlike thought and laughed.\nLeaning against the low railing, she reached out her hand toward the plants. She wondered how sturdy those round, dish-like leaves were.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nElusive yet tantalizingly close, it remained just out of reach. It happened when Lorna reached out a little further, extending her hand into the depths.\n\u201cAnd then I fell into the water,\u201d she said.\nHer hand was covered by a white glove.\nWithout even looking, she knew who it was. The familiar scent signalled his presence, and the sight of the pure white gloves that defined him brought her joy.\nLorna smiled.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nWhen she turned around, there was no one around anymore.\nFrom behind a tree a short distance away, Lin peeked out, revealing his head. Seeing Lorna widen her eyes, Lin quickly withdrew, taking hurried steps further away. Lorna chuckled softly.\n\u201cI wanted to be alone with you. Was that too much to ask for?\u201d\nNabel tilted his head toward her. Lorna lowered her head.\n\u201cNo. But what brings you here at this hour?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you, milady?\u201d\nNabel leaned against the railing, his gloved hand reaching out into the distance. Unlike Lorna, his hand touched the leaves.\nHe pulled a leaf towards him until it reached the vicinity of the railing, close enough for Lorna to touch. Nabel turned to her, smiling as if inviting her to touch it.\n\u201cI came here because the lights were on.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nIt must have been bothering her. Lorna\u2019s hand, reaching out towards the leaves, hesitated. Above it, Nabel\u2019s gentle voice resonated.\n\u201cI thought you wanted someone to come to dispel your loneliness.\u201d\nLorna looked at him again. Nabel slightly tilted his head.\n\u201cWas that not the case?\u201d\nSmiling, Nabel placed his hand on the back of her hand. Running a finger along her hand, he evoked a strange and mysterious sensation.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about that.\u201d\nPerhaps she had been lonely.\nNabel removed the white glove from her hand. His hand rested on Lorna\u2019s arm once again.\nAs if asking if he could read her thoughts, his hand slowly traced her arm and gently held her hand. Lorna naturally didn\u2019t avoid his touch.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep because my mind was troubled.\u201d\nNabel closed his eyes briefly, then opened them again.\n\u201cWe all have those days.\u201d\nHe gestured towards the water. The drifting leaf had drifted a bit further away from the two of them.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m away from you, that\u2019s how it feels to me.\u201d\nNapping had its survival value, but a life without respite was agonizing. Nabel knew that pain.\nOn such days, warmth was longed for. Once again, he wanted to return to the past and hold her in their small sanctuary.\nThere were days when he grew weaker and hoped that someone would assure him that he wasn\u2019t alone, that someday he could find happiness.\nPerhaps you felt the same way.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case for you too, then I believe I can help you, at least a little.\u201d\nHe embraced her from behind. A peculiar sensation spread through her ear.\nThrough her hand, his thoughts reached her.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Warmth enveloped her round shoulder. The whispered words in her ear were thick and fervent.\n\u201cWhen melancholy thoughts arise, I often divert my attention to other matters,\u201d Nabel said, his voice perpetually soothing whenever they delved into the decade-long separation.\nNabel embraced her, and Lorna placed her hand upon his palm, which rested on my chest.\nTheir warmth intertwined.\n\u201cHow are you, my lady?\u201d Lorna\u2019s voice was filled with a subdued tone.\n\u201cAre there not times when you simply wish to think of nothing amidst the complexity of the heart?\u201d she asked.\nHer words resonated truthfully. Lorna nodded slowly.\nHer mind was a labyrinth of complexities. Thoughts from the day kept recurring. At the time, everything seemed fine, but upon reflection, it felt as though the sorcerers wore displeased expressions.\nOr perhaps it was her own futile attempts to attribute meaning to meaningless gestures. She had turned her body to engage in conversation with others, yet inexplicably, she worried if her words had prompted negative thoughts and reactions.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nEven though she knew well the enmity that would arise from such an official stance, she couldn\u2019t help but want to be with him.\nLorna grasped his hand firmly, her thoughts transmitted clearly to Nabel. The depth of her emotions reached him more powerfully than any ten spoken words could have.\n\u201cI wish to rest for a while,\u201d she conveyed.\nShe longed for a moment devoid of complex thoughts, where her mind would be free from any contemplation.\nHer wearied mind cried out in agony.\nNabel nibbled gently on her earlobe.\n\u201cThen lean on me,\u201d he whispered.\nTheir lips met, the soft sound reverberating loudly within Lorna\u2019s mind. Nabel\u2019s hand grazed her cape lightly.\nHis warm hand slipped inside the cape. Having worn only a light dress for their brief outing, the heat of his body was directly transmitted to her delicate dress.\nThe trapped warmth within the cape turned into a blaze, scorching her cheek.\n[Click]\nA button securing the cape came undone. His hand, resting upon her chest, gently glided over the round mounds.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Lorna gasped. The fleeting touch of his fingers brushing against her nipple through the thin fabric caused her to startle. His touch was firm yet tender.\n\u201cYou may lean on me even more,\u201d he said softly.\nHis body firmly supported Lorna from behind, while his knee parted her legs.\nSimultaneously, his hand pressed firmly against her nipple.\n\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201d\nWhen pressure was applied to the firm object, a thrilling sensation caused her spine to quiver. Nabel kissed her neck with his lips.\n\u201cAh,\u201d the sound echoed in her ear once again. It was not as light as before. He lightly licked her neck, leaving behind a deep, crimson mark.\nHis hand slipped down over the fabric of her trembling clothes. With his other hand, he removed her cape and pulled Lorna closer, embracing her deeply.\n[Whack!] The sound of the cape hitting the floor seemed to resound. In the next moment, Nabel\u2019s hand, which had descended below her knees, brushed aside the hem of her dress and entered.\nAs his wrist came into contact with the hem, her thigh was exposed to the outside world.\nThe hand that had been enveloping her knee slowly rose. It seemed to brush the front of her thigh, and in between, the other hand touched the surface of her undergarments.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nAs he made contact with the heated area, Lorna flinched. Without hesitation, Nabel\u2019s hand climbed up to her waist, parting her panties and delving below.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nUnbeknownst to her, Lorna\u2019s gaze involuntarily shifted downwards. The lower hem was slightly raised due to Nabel\u2019s wrist, revealing a glimpse.\nWithin the dense shadow spread on the floor, a subtle movement was felt.\nHis hand, which had penetrated inside her panties, explored within.\nJust like navigating through an unseen path, two fingers glided in a circular motion, making their way through the gap between her moist folds.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\nHis hand slid over her still moist c**toris. Soon, his hand cupped her mound, while one finger stimulated the entrance.\n\u201cHmm, ah\u2026!\u201d\nMoisture seeped in an instant. She could feel a faint flow of liquid cascading over Nabel\u2019s finger, drenching her panties.\n\u201cSeems like you\u2019ve become a bit complicated in your thoughts.\u201d\nIn a low voice, he slid his finger deeper inside Lorna. Along the slippery path, his finger plunged in.\n\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201d\nUnbeknownst to herself, Lorna raised her leg. As her strength waned, she leaned against his body.\nHer body swayed, collapsing onto the knees that had entered between her legs.\nNabel firmly held her, and his finger pressed firmly against her inner walls.\nThe tight opening enclosed his finger, then gradually opened with a moist sound. The wet finger slid inside, widening her passage.\nAnother finger intruded into that place.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nAlthough it was still dry, it quickly became moist.\nThe two wet fingers spread her insides. In response to the stimulation on her inner walls, Lorna\u2019s head tilted upwards.\nLorna struggled to muster strength into her legs, which seemed to be growing weaker with each passing moment. Every time she made the effort, her inner self clenched like two tightly pressed fingers.\nSoftly, Nabel, who had just kissed her cheek, withdrew his fingers from within her.\nAs the sticky fluid dribbled down her extended dress, her fingers slid out. The clammy and sticky sensation of the fluid remained on her thighs.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nIt was when Lorna\u2019s cheeks blushed. Nabel\u2019s outer garment fell to the floor, spreading wide. Above the spread garment, Nabel seated her.\nNabel positioned himself behind Lorna, who was now seated on her knees. The floor-length dress, which seemed undecided whether to cover her knees or not, rose slightly to the edge of her thighs.\nLorna blushed and instinctively tried to bring her legs down. However, Nabel was slightly faster than her. His two hands that had entered behind her knees firmly supported her legs.\n\u201cYou may rest comfortably.\u201d\nHis whispering voice was sweet. It was when Lorna tried to turn to face him.\n\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want any other thoughts.\u201d\nThe thoughts she had just read were her deep sincerity.\nShe didn\u2019t want complicated thoughts. She wanted to rest without any thoughts, even if only for a moment.\nLeaning forward, Nabel kissed her knees that were exposed above the dress. Then, he pulled the dress down.\nThe dress, which had slid down to her waist, no longer concealed her wetness underneath. The chilly air that touched her wet panties could be felt directly, making Lorna flinch.\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nThe hot hand that had been supporting her behind her knees flowed down to her lower region.\n\u201cDo you want me to cover this place?\u201d\nHis hand teasingly grazed just above her entrance. Lorna flinched.\nEven if there were no people in the greenhouse, even in the deep midnight, this place was outdoors. It was natural for someone to patrol regularly at any time if it was a place within the palace. Especially if the lights were on in a greenhouse where there was no reason for anyone to enter during the dawn.\nNabel must have known that fact, yet his touch was malicious.\nHis hand that had flowed down to her lower region lifted her body.\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nIn that state, he removed her panties upwards from beneath her.\nAs he spread her legs, the panties that were draped over her thighs slightly parted to the sides. Even in Lorna\u2019s eyes, the shimmering fluid that trickled from her wetness was clearly visible on top of her panties.\nUnbelievable.\nLorna covered her face with both hands.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so embarrassed to be seen like this.\u201d\nNabel, who was laughing, returned to her front. He knelt between her legs and took her panties into his mouth.\nHis mouth touched the spot that was always moist and soaked.\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\nHarper Lee\u2019s Translation:\nHer lane\u2019s legs trembled in surprise. Smirking mischievously, Clark Kent completely removed her panties.\nWith a light thud, what she was wearing fell right next to her hand. The space between her legs felt empty.\nNabel\u2019s hand gently touched her closed knee. His heated hand caressed her knee like a gentle knock, sliding up to the upper thigh.\nThe moist sensation transmitted through the closed thighs, staining her face a deeper shade of crimson. Nabel\u2019s and her gazes met.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel chuckled softly and leaned in. His lips touched her knee. It felt tender, soft, and warm.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

It was his tongue.\nWhile exploring her knee, Nabel never took his gaze off her.\nAs if asking her to open up.\nTheir kiss grew more fervent. With the tip of his tongue, he lightly tapped and then gently caressed the sensitive area inside her knee. A tingling and yet mysterious sensation made her body shiver in response.\n[Thud] She grasped the surface of Nabel\u2019s outstretched arm. The soft lining welcomed her hand.\n\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201d\nUnintentionally, he delved through the open space between her legs.\nTo prevent any hesitation, he pressed his lips against the inner thigh.\nThere remained a dark mark in the place permitted only to him. Nabel widened her legs a bit more.\nThe space below, which was exposed in his sight, had nothing covering it. The dress that had climbed up to her waist no longer served as clothing.\nThe glistening trace of fluid was visible on the dark pink bush.\nNabel reached out with his hand. It was the fingertip that had explored her insides earlier. The slightly dry fingertip once again targeted her secret spot.\nPerhaps due to her legs spreading wide, his fingertip easily touched her c**toris without delving into the thick flesh.\nHis hand pressed firmly on that spot. It was wet unlike before.\nHis hand slipped over the moist nub.\n\u201cMmm\u2026!\u201d\nHer waist jerked. Blushing, she glanced at him from the corner of her eye.\nHer averted gaze caught sight of the greenhouse\u2019s glass wall. Beyond the water with floating leaves, she could see something.\nThe interior was lit, so if someone looked from the outside, they might be able to see this side.\nOh, the world.\nShe shielded her face with one hand. Half-obscured vision simply closed her eyes. She was anxious that someone might pass by directly in front of her, fearing that someone might see the sight of her legs wide open, accepting him.\nNabel grabbed her exposed thigh. His wet fingertips seemed to be drawing a picture, then he tilted his head.\nHis face delved inside her dress. As he did, the view that had been obscured by his body became even clearer.\nHer own reflection on the metal railing and the view outside the yellow castle. As the glass wall was transparent, they were seen even more clearly.\n[Sigh]\nThe damp sound resonated from below, marking the moment.\nHe pressed his tongue against her c**toris, delving deeper into her with a yearning that compelled him to bring his lips lower, as if to quench his thirst by teasing her most sensitive spot.\nGently and smoothly, his tongue slid down over the sensitive area, teasing the entrance. Lorna\u2019s hips jolted in surprise.\n\u201cMmm!\u201d\nStartled by the unintended loud sound, Lorna covered my mouth. Nabel chuckled.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one else in the greenhouse but us.\u201d\nAs he lifted his head slightly and spoke, a breath of air moistened the inside of her thighs. Nabel slid his hand, which had been spread apart, into her entrance.\nHe propped up his fingertips, which were gliding slowly, against the inner walls. Lorna\u2019s throat clenched in response to the pressure inside.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nA delightful whimper escaped Lorna, igniting Nabel\u2019s desire. With a mischievous touch, he slid his fingers deeper into her entrance.\nAs if scraping the insides, his hooked fingertips brushed against her inner walls with each gliding motion.\nThere was no pain within her already moistened interior.\nInstead, a sensation akin to a burst of light in her mind approached. One of Lorna\u2019s legs quivered, and the low-heeled shoes on her feet trembled.\n\u201cHmm, mmm\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cYes, like that.\u201d\nDon\u2019t hold back. Feel free to cry out as much as you like.\nNabel, who chuckled softly, plunged his fingers deeper. At the same time, he pinched her c**toris with his thumb.\nThe fervent fingers stimulated her peak. Each time they pressed firmly on the hardened spot and slid to the side, the strong bone of his fingers provided intense pleasure.\n\u201cHmm!\u201d\nThen, as his fingers delved deep inside, stimulating her c**toris, Lorna\u2019s passion intensified. She once again sealed her lips shut.\nFrom beneath the wetness, a soft sound resonated.\nIt was much louder than before. The only sounds that echoed in the quiet greenhouse were Lorna\u2019s moans and Nabel\u2019s rough breaths.\nIt felt as though someone else could hear them.\nHer gaze fell upon the railing once again. In her tear-drenched vision, my flushed face loomed, tinged with crimson.\nAnd her spread legs.\nAnd his actions explore inside.\n\u201cWhat is it that bothers you so much?\u201d\nNabel\u2019s hand withdrew from the entrance, only to dive back in deeply. His slightly erect fingertips scratched the inner walls.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nNabel turned around to glance back, chuckling. With a knowing smile, he turned back to face Lorna and pulled her closer.\n\u201cSo, you needed a mirror.\u201d\nWith his wet hand, he grasped the back of her knee and spread it open. Nabel positioned himself behind her.\nThe sensation of a hot pillar pressed against her posterior, even through their clothes, felt vivid.\nHis d*ck, still unreleased, grazed against Lorna\u2019s back.\n\u201cMight I ask the maid to bring a mirror?\u201d\nHis sultry voice poured into her ear.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "113": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-113/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo the handmaiden, would you bring me the looking glass?\u201d\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\nThe tiny voice was endearing. Even the voice itself, like a whispered secret, seemed to flow only into his ears.\nThe voice that wanted to reach only me was deeply satisfying. Nabel chuckled softly.\nLovely person.\n\u201cIf not, then I must assist you in seeing more clearly.\u201d\nHis hand slid inward again. As his arm firmly supported her hip and leg, they lifted slightly.\nThe crumbling center found support in Nabel\u2019s embrace.\nThe hand, which had been exploring her inner thigh, spread apart to reveal the hidden recesses. The fleshy folds that normally enveloped the c**toris parted, exposing the inner depths.\n\u201cDo you wish to behold this place?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s cheeks blazed crimson. His index finger brushed against the cleft between his thumb and middle finger.\nWith a gentle flick, his body flinched. The visual stimulus intertwined with a tingling sensation that gradually spread through the lower abdomen.\nOnce again, Nabel\u2019s index finger flicked, grazing her innermost depths.\nThis time, it delved deeper than before.\n\u201cMmm\u2026!\u201d\nNabel chuckled softly, teasing her depths further. The touch of the moist area against his fingers was accompanied by a cool rush of air.\nThe fingers that stroked her also felt hot. She could feel the moisture trickling down below. The sensation of the slick fluid flowing between her buttocks due to their position was vivid.\nEven the inside of her dress grew damp.\nHis index finger persisted, teasing her summit with a relentless determination. It lightly brushed against the hardened peak. Lorna\u2019s leg twitches.\n\u201cHnng, ah\u2026!\u201d\nShe felt her legs quiver and her toes curl. It was the moment when a gentle climax threatened to take hold.\nNabel, ceasing his movements, nibbled on her ear. Then he slid his index finger into her v*****l passage.\nThe already moist interior eagerly welcomed his digit, as if it were accepting his member. His finger probed deep, stimulating the rounded walls, before withdrawing.\nA thick thread of arousal connected his finger, coated in the essence of her depths, as it snapped apart.\nAs Nabel grazed his finger, the fluid that had been gradually building up between her walls seemed to break, as if forming a delicate barrier.\n\u201cIt feels warm, my lady.\u201d\nHe had intended to comfort her, but he himself received the solace. Even after the competition had ended, he had been occupied with work and couldn\u2019t fall asleep until dawn.\nEvery time he turned his head, it felt as though his fatigued mind was swaying.\nThe greenhouse had appeared at that time.\nHe knew for certain that it overlooked this place from Lorna\u2019s balcony. It was not difficult to surmise that Lady, who had surely been unable to sleep due to today\u2019s events, had come here.\nWhen she nestled into his arms, it felt as though the fatigue of the early morning vanished.\n\u201cNow, do you have any other thoughts?\u201d\nWhen Nabel asked, Lorna\u2019s eyes widened slightly.\nIt was as he had said.\nDuring the moments when she melted under his touch, no complex thoughts entered her mind. If stray thoughts tried to intrude into her consciousness, his fingertips shot up, whitening her mind.\nA tingling sensation rising from her lower abdomen expelled all thoughts.\nAs Lorna nodded briefly, Nabel smiled with delight.\nPressing his lips against her ear, he moved even closer to her. Lifting her body, he gently settled it on his thigh. Lorna, perched on one of his thighs, blushed.\nAs she was turned to the side, his face became even more visible.\nAnd the intense heat emanating from one side of his core felt even more intense. Without realizing it, Lorna glanced down at his pants.\nInside the pants, an ominous presence that remained unreleased was revealed.\n\u201cDoes this bother you?\u201d he asked in a slightly husky voice. Nabel\u2019s hand guided her hand. He gently held her wrist and placed her hand on his member.\nThe heat was palpable even through their clothes.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t seem that way.\nLorna knew that with each thrust he restrained, she let out a rough moan. Despite his words, Nabel pressed her hand firmly against his member.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\nA stifled moan escaped her lips.\nThe sound of his belt buckle caught on her fingertips.\nHe firmly pressed her hand down on his member, allowing her to feel its fullness.\nThough she hadn\u2019t touched it, something moist trickled down from under Lorna. Due to the dampness from sitting on his thigh earlier, her dress may have gotten wet, and his pants might have become damp as well.\nStartled by the vivid sensation of liquid flowing, Lorna tried to adjust her posture. However, Nabel did not release her hand.\nA tight presence loomed large, completely occupying her hand.\nIt was too large to grasp with her palm.\n\u201c\u2026.Hmm.\u201d\nIt was a boiling mixture of endurance.\nYet Nabel never asked him to release his hold on her.\nIt was not the time to fulfill his desires. He wished to lull Lorna into a deep slumber. Instead of Lorna pleading for his release, he inclined his head over her lap.\nA soft, whispered sigh escaped when their lips met.\nLorna\u2019s hand untangled his buckle.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nIn the sudden sense of liberation, Nabel exhaled a breath. Even with a slight descent, he glimpsed his erect manhood, concealed behind a thin fabric.\nIt was the same one Lorna\u2019s hand had just touched.\nShe was unaware of the audacity he had mustered. Her intention was to provide her with more comfort. Her hand moistened his undergarments, fully releasing his possession.\nA droplet of patience glistened at the fiery tip of his member. Lorna\u2019s knuckles grazed against it, as she passed by.\n\u201cHeh.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s breath grew rougher. He closed his eyes and once again buried his face in her lap. It seemed he wouldn\u2019t withstand a stronger stimulation.\n\u201c\u2026Looorna.\u201d\nA low murmur resonated.\nIn his uncertainty, Lorna reached for him once again with her own hand. She wiped away the remnants that clung to the tip.\n\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201d\nA heated breath escaped.\nDo you know what you are doing right now?\nNabel erupted with a seething voice.\n\u201cStop.\u201d\nLorna understood that it wasn\u2019t merely a plea born of pain.\nNo, it might have been a plea born of pain.\nHe had always been considerate, ensuring she could reach the climax first. Even when it felt like he would thrust forcefully inward, he never ceased his caresses until she melted within.\nHis desire remained unfulfilled until that point.\nToday was no different. Her hand connected with his once again. The cooper droplets smeared on her knuckles drew meaningless patterns.\n\u201cHeh\u2026 please.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s voice sounded like a growl. He tightly grasped Lorna\u2019s hand that was near his possession.\nI want to push you down to the floor.\nI want to thrust myself into your trembling depths, shaking my hips.\nThen, even Lorna\u2019s moans would seem inaudible. That\u2019s why he suppressed himself.\nTo prevent Lorna from further stimulating him, he guided her hand to his lips.\nA tender kiss brushed against her delicate fingertips.\n\u201cDo not stimulate me, Looorna.\u201d\nHis deep voice continued,\n\u201cDo you realize how dangerous it is for you to spend time alone with a risky individual?\u201d\nI wanted to slam my wrist onto the floor and press it down, squeezing her tightly until desire consumed us both.\nSuch dark thoughts welled up inside me, causing me to close my eyes.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re always considerate,\u201d Lorna said, smiling.\nHer flushed cheeks looked even more enchanting today, and Nabel tilted his head.\nHe delicately took Lorna\u2019s fingertips to his lips and then withdrew them.\nHis finger, having explored the depths of her inner lips, brushed against her hand, feeling the warmth of Nabel\u2019s breath.\n\u201cTake better care of yourself, a little bit more.\u201d\nBecome someone only you know, madam.\nBecome such a self-centered person.\nThere is someone here who is willing to give everything beneath your feet.\nIt was futile to indulge yourself to your heart\u2019s content.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

His warm fingertips traced upward, traversing the moist path.\nAs his warm fingertips crossed the wet path, the essence flowed down, drawing a line on the slippery road.\nWhat was on the verge of entering the entrance continued to move upward. It pressed firmly against the spot just below the c**toris and passed by.\n\u201cMmm\u2026!\u201d\nLorna, taken by surprise, lowered her waist, while still sitting on Nabel\u2019s thigh. His hand supported her back.\nThe sliding hand then spread inside her other knee. The other leg was supported by his firm chin, rendering it powerless. Feeling the sensation of the p***s against her thigh, Lorna tensed her leg.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nNabel moaned as he experienced a strong stimulus, slowly closing and opening his eyes. Then he explored her secret place.\nHis index finger, situated just above the c**toris, stroked it roughly. The stimulation was less intense than directly on the c**toris, but the rough movement gradually brought pleasure.\nSqueak.\nAt that moment, Lorna flinched at the sound of something moving.\nOh, dear.\nNabel whispered softly. As someone skilled in swordsmanship, his sensitivity to movements was genuine. But the tension within him was inevitable, tightening the walls of his heart.\nNabel\u2019s words were true. This moment desired secrecy even more than Lorna did. Hence, his ears were attuned to any slight disturbance.\nIt was merely the sound of the wind. An annoying coincidence that the wind tried to slip through the crack in the greenhouse door and made that sound.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the sound of the wind.\u201d\nHe whispered softly, teasing his fingers. His eyes captured the exposed c**toris, nestled between his thumb and index finger. He longed to moisten his lips in the swollen place.\nBut today, as the lady intended to please me.\nShouldn\u2019t I return the favour?\nNabel\u2019s finger once again brushed over the c**toris. The slickness of the arousal quickly stimulated the slippery area, only to unexpectedly graze against the c**toris.\n\u201cOh!\u201d\nHer parted legs shifted. Nabel tightened his grip on her leg, spreading it wider.\n\u201cYou seemed eager to see this place.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s voice resonated lowly. Lorna blushed, tilting her head.\n\u201cOr perhaps you wished for a reflection, like that of a mirror.\u201d\nNabel looked regretful as he glanced at the railing. The profiles of the two figures were cast upon the slender metal column.\n\u201cOr\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s finger pressed firmly against her peak once more.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLorna\u2019s waist trembled, nearing climax. At that moment, Nabel\u2019s hand halted.\n\u201cDid you desire this place?\u201d\nThe hand that had paused just before climax moved again. As if toying with her, each time she approached the pinnacle, the hand withdrew.\nMoisture had already permeated her undergarments. The sensation of wetness heightened as Lorna squirmed.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nA soft voice echoed. Around that time, Nabel began to caress her c**toris once more.\nThis time, the feeling of two fingers swirling in opposite directions made Lorna move her waist forcefully.\nYet the stimulation was brief. It was a tantalizing stimulation. Her eager core clenched tightly at the emptiness.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHis indifferent voice was mocking. Although his voice grew hotter and more sultry, Lorna remained unaware of the fervour.\nHis index finger touched the c**toris again. This time, it came in contact with the peak multiple times.\n\u201cUh! Ah!\u201d\nBut it was not yet climax. Nabel merely grasped her waist, restraining her desire, and once again, his hand stopped.\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\nShe tightly gripped his neck. Her body, which had slipped down from her thighs, nestled between his legs.\nHer womanhood and his phallus touched and teased each other.\n\u201cAh, hah.\u201d\nA high-pitched cry resounded. It was the result of her sensitive place coming into contact with something scorching.\nLorna\u2019s legs trembled uncontrollably.\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough. Without realizing it, Lorna pulled Nabel closer.\n\u201cHah.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d\nSimultaneously, a heated breath burst forth without warning. Nabel embraced her tightly.\nIn that position, he lifted her legs and pushed her down.\nHis outer garment grazed against Lorna\u2019s back.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The roughness of the surface never reached her back, thanks to the clothes that had fallen on top of her.\nInstead, something hot pressed against her thighs.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nUnintentionally, a cry escaped Lorna\u2019s lips. In an attempt to stifle her moans, she bit down on her trembling lower lip, only to have Nabel\u2019s hand graze against it.\nHer slightly parted lips were unable to bite his hand as it gently trailed along the inside.\nSimultaneously, he withdrew his own organ. Then, once again, he forcefully thrust it deep inside her entrance.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nHer hips arched upward. The dress, completely discarded, clung to her waist, enveloping her pristine white legs. Nabel repeatedly penetrated her innermost being.\n\u201cAh! Ugh! Ah!\u201d\nUnexpectedly, vigour surged through her. Her cries escaped the confines of her parted lips, trapped by Nabel\u2019s hand.\nThe rhythm between their bodies and the world seemed to sway differently. The pleasure that saturated her lower abdomen spread throughout her entire being.\nUnaware of her heightened waist, she clenched her toes tightly.\n[Thump! Thump!]\nWet, squelching sounds resonated within the slippery depths multiple times.\nThe slick walls eagerly embraced his member, tightening around it as if it had been long awaited. It became almost arduous to move. Removing it felt as if her walls were to follow suit, clutching onto it tightly.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nNabel exhaled a coarse breath. As he lowered one of Lorna\u2019s arms, his hips resumed their motion.\nThe thrusts, initially firm, then retreated before surging forward again.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s body convulsed. The rough waves imprinted themselves on the clothes spread across the ground.\n[Thump! Thump!]\nA mixture of bodily fluids and other substances splattered against their thighs. Amidst the indistinguishable moans, a tearful whimper intertwined.\n\u201cGuh\u2026\u201d\nThe intruder that had breached her innermost sanctum now stabbed at its deepest point. In her peak, Lorna tightly clutched Nabel\u2019s waist, her arms constricting around his neck.\n\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\nNabel, having released himself within her, exhaled a hot breath. The sensation of warmth spreading through her was palpable.\nTheir eyes met, while their walls and members intimately embraced each other.\n\u201cAhhhh-h.\u201d\nNabel finally regained some semblance of reason. Tears glistening in the corner of Lorna\u2019s eyes caught the subdued light of the greenhouse.\n\u201cAhh-hh.\u201d\nNabel realized belatedly what he had done, and a faint gasp escaped his slightly parted lips. She embraced him, drawing him close.\nTheir faces were so close that their lips met instantly. Her warm lips gently enveloped Nabel\u2019s upper lip, just as he had always comforted her. She, too, wanted to provide solace for him.\nThe clumsy kiss, compared to Nabel\u2019s, comforted him. her tongue, uncertain of where to go after lightly caressing his upper lip, flicked against it once more.\nAs Nabel parted his lips slightly, her lips descended as if she had finally found what she was searching for. However, Nabel was a bit quicker.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nNabel engulfed her, swallowing her breath whole. The fervent and rough kiss overwhelmed her to the point of breathlessness.\nHe sucked her lower lip into his mouth, creating a moist sound as he delved inside her lips.\nTheir tongues intertwined without hesitation, producing wet sounds as they made contact.\nMeanwhile, Nabel turned his waist slightly. The rekindled presence from within her began to stimulate her inner walls.\n\u201cAaahhh-hh!\u201d\nStartled, she opened her eyes wide. Nabel, smiling softly, kissed her cheek. It was at the moment when she barely managed to catch her breath.\n[Thud!]\nWhat had been thrust outside her body was now driven back in.\n\u201cHuh!\u201d\nA high-pitched moan escaped her lips.\nThis time, there was nothing caught in her mouth, so the ecstasy echoed unadulterated.\nTheir tightly connected organs stimulated various parts inside her passage. As Nabel firmly pressed against a certain spot on her inner wall, she squeezed his neck tightly once again.\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s organ focused intensively on that spot. Their fluids intermingled, causing her thighs to tremble multiple times.\n\u201cAh, huh, huh\u2026!\u201d\nAnd just as she approached climax, his throbbing member, tightly held within her passage, slid upwards toward the entrance.\nThe slippery fluids glided across her entrance, pressing against her c**toris firmly.\n\u201cAh, ah!\u201d\nHer waist arched sharply.\nThe firm and thick sensation that grazed her c**toris provided an intense pleasure that was incomparable to the touch of fingers.\nHer blurred vision shook. She didn\u2019t know if it was because he was rocking his waist or because I was shaking my head sideways.\n\u201cHuh! Ah\u2026!\u201d\nThe sensation stroked the swollen area persistently.\nHer spread legs reached skyward. The shoe that had precariously clung to the tip of her toes fell to the ground with a thud and rolled away.\nAt that moment, Nabel\u2019s body pressed against her as if penetrating her deepest depths. The thick shaft crossed her vulva, sweeping through the lush hills.\nIt soaked the waistband of her pink undergarments and slipped inside.\n\u201cHaaaa-ah!\u201d\nHer alabaster complexion flushed crimson, reaching down to her delicate jawline. It was not just her neck that was ensconced by the fabric of her dress, but the flames of desire burned even upon her rosy cheeks.\nNabel\u2019s hand gently caressed her cheek.\n\u201cIt was me,\u201d he said.\nWith a touch that held a hint of force, his hand cradled the back of her head.\n\u201cI implored you not to provoke me.\u201d\nAs if seeking to decipher the meaning behind her tears, to ascertain whether she felt any pain, Nabel peered into her eyes.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nRather than uttering a word, Lorna tightly grasped his hand. Through that touch, truth would convey her feelings more sincerely than any other means.\nShe was delighted.\nIn that moment of embracing him, with no other thoughts, she was genuinely delighted.\nNabel, perceiving her thoughts, let out a heated breath. Rough breaths oscillated between the two. Lorna\u2019s trembling hand lightly brushed against his cheek.\nIn response to her subtle movement, his own body reacted immediately. The swelling member, as if tantalizing her c**toris, rekindled its firm presence.\nHowever, he did not dare to thrust it inside her.\nEven in the presence of her quivering and delicate hand, he could not satisfy his desire.\nThe time had come for him to rise.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

The fervour trapped between them could not escape.\n\u201cMore,\u201d Lorna whispered.\n\u201c\u2026More, please.\u201d\nThe time spent with you is enjoyable to me.\nAs you mentioned, a time where I can see nothing but you, without a single thought.\nJust like hastening the sweet time we can indulge in, overcoming all dangers, I can be truly happy when I am in your arms, without a single thought.\nShe did not want this intoxicating time to end.\n\u201cLady,\u201d Nabel exhaled. His hot breath enveloped her neck.\nNabel\u2019s palm wiped away her tears.\nHad she endured much hardship?\nHe pulled Lorna closer, her face nestled against his broad chest. Nabel\u2019s member pressed firmly against her mound.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nIn contrast to earlier, his movements now were more gentle as he ventured between her thighs. The scorching pillar pressed against one of her trembling thighs, repeatedly withdrawing and entering.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nAs Lorna stood upright, her erect phallus made firm contact with the entrance of the orifice, eliciting a sharp, piercing sound.\nLorna let out a short breath. Nabel, after lingering near the entrance several times, traversed her nether regions with his organ, stained with their secretions.\nA gentle thrust brushed against her c**toris.\n\u201cOhhh\u2026!\u201d\nLorna\u2019s body trembled with the return of climax. Nabel held her tightly.\nHe continually grazed her p***c mound with his own. A muffled sound resonated amidst the thighs, dampened with an unknown liquid.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nThe thrusts grew stronger. However, as he caressed the surface of her nether regions instead of penetrating her interior, the impact on Lorna\u2019s body was diminished.\n\u201cAh\u2026 ohh\u2026!\u201d\nYet, the intense stimulation seemed to surge towards her head.\nLorna clutched his body tightly. After consecutive wet sounds, something white sprang onto her body.\n\u201c\u2026.Huh.\u201d\nLorna embraced him, and Nabel\u2019s body merged with her dishevelled dress, soaked in the fluid.\n\u201cI tremble, my lady.\u201d\nNabel kissed her trembling fingertips, enveloping her cheeks with his warm hands. His lips, which had grazed the tip of her nose, now explored her lips more deeply.\n\u201cHaah.\u201d\nAfter mingling breaths, accompanied by indecipherable whispers, their moist gazes finally met. Nabel kissed her cheek briefly, then rose to his feet.\n\u201cI will escort you to the bedroom.\u201d\nHe lowered her dress and tidied it up.\nThe dishevelled interior of the dress, stained with semen, was concealed. Even the inner thighs, coated with semen and secretions, were hidden.\nExcept for the reddened cheeks and eyes, which were meticulously wiped clean, he would appear as if he had just emerged from a greenhouse, gazing over its length.\nNabel kissed her cheek once more, then helped her to her feet.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nHis shoeless toes lightly brushed against the bare floor before returning. Leaning down, he kissed her toes, then personally placed the shoes on her feet.\n\u201cThat one.\u201d\nLorna blushed, unable to continue her sentence. It was not due to heat, but rather embarrassment. Nabel removed her undergarments over his outerwear.\nConcealing her exposed parts from view, he stood up. A mischievous smile, reminiscent of a miscreant, was directed at her.\n\u201cI will escort you.\u201d\nThe words he had spoken earlier.\nHowever, Lorna couldn\u2019t move hastily. The interior of her dress, descending all the way to her knees, was still damp.\nThe unmistakable sensation of a liquid, undoubtedly a mixture of secretions, trickled down between her legs.\n\u201cOh, dear.\u201d\nNabel once again lowered his body between her legs. His head briefly disappeared beneath the dress.\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\nIn the next instant, startled Lorna twitched her body. It was due to the gentle and teasing touch that swept from the inside of her knee to the inside of her thigh.\nHaving wiped away the traces of intimacy, he rose again.\nThe hem of the dress that covered his head rose up along with him, revealing her thighs vividly, only to flutter down.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nSurprised, Lorna quickly adjusted her dress. Nabel chuckled softly.\n\u201cYou may proceed.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nLorna couldn\u2019t take a step forward hastily.\nIt was because she could feel the liquid that had previously flowed out in humiliation dripping down the slippery path he had cleaned. She didn\u2019t know when it would become visible beneath her dress.\nBefore that, she felt the cool air touching the wet spots, causing her legs to tremble involuntarily. She felt the slippery space between her legs, making her cheeks even redder.\n\u201cIf walking is difficult for you\u2026\u201d\nNabel lowered his body. When his hand came behind her knee, Lorna raised her head.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the case.\u201d\nEven without a hand that saw the truth, his mind already knew. If she was lifted up in his arms, wearing a short dress with no underwear underneath, she didn\u2019t know what would happen.\nWith her cheeks flushed, she took a small step forward. Swish, the outside air rushed in beneath the moving hem of her dress.\nLorna\u2019s hand gently rested on the hand he extended.\nIt was a tender escort.\n\u201cShall we go?\u201d\nHe spoke with a low chuckle, wearing his usual relaxed expression. No, there was a deeper mischief hidden beneath it.\nKnowing it was a clandestine game, Lorna had no choice but to hold his hand.\n[Thud]\nThe door opened.\nThe cold air outside the greenhouse struck her and her wetness.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Lorna\u2019s stride faltered, imbued with a peculiar and eerie sensation.\n\u201cMadam?\u201d\nNabel, her escort, couldn\u2019t possibly be oblivious to it. An anxious gaze turned towards her. Half expecting to be overwhelmed by some crime half-remembered, Lorna\u2019s nerves were understandably on edge.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nLorna shook her head. Even though no question had been asked, it seemed her response had preemptively sprung forth, revealing her underlying tension.\nShe worried whether any explicit traces of indiscretion lay exposed below, casting an uneasy shadow upon her.\nWhile Lorna was preoccupied with adjusting her attire, Nabel\u2019s glance momentarily darted behind. It was a look that commanded distance.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nThose who promptly understood the master\u2019s silent order muffled their footsteps and slowed their pace. Following suit, Lin also lagged behind.\nThe emptiness below evoked a peculiar and unfamiliar uncanniness. Lorna\u2019s pounding ears refused to subside. Nabel gently guided her through such turmoil.\n[Dong]\nNow it was the stairs. Instinctively placing her foot upon the stair, Lorna flinched. A sound so faint that others would not hear, or perhaps no sound at all.\nYet she unmistakably felt it.\nThe moistened depths parting, emitting a moist sound.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nNabel turned his gaze back to her. He briefly pressed his lips against the back of her hand.\nAnd as his chilly gaze turned behind her, the knights gave her even more space.\n\u201cThey have been held back, my lady.\u201d\nA low whisper enveloped her hand. Unknowingly, Lorna glanced over her shoulder.\nLin and the knights, who had distanced themselves twice, were maintaining a sufficient gap. Yet Lorna\u2019s heart raced relentlessly.\nFearful of her escaping breath being discovered, she blushed.\nUnder the gentle pull of his guidance, Lorna resumed her steps. Once again, the faint, moist sound reached her ears.\nIn this world, oh, in this world.\nShe couldn\u2019t fathom how she had ascended the stairs, almost unaware of her own movements. It happened as she turned her body to proceed to the next set of steps.\n\u201c\u2026.!\u201d\nThe hem of her dress lifted slightly, following a movement in the air. Startled, Lorna reached out her hand to press down the lower part.\nBut Nabel\u2019s hand was quicker.\nHe gently placed his hand on the outer side of her thigh, tidying her attire, and planted a kiss on Lorna\u2019s forehead.\n[Snap]\nWhile Lorna\u2019s attention was momentarily seized by the sound, Nabel embraced her body. His outer garment draped over her knees, supported by his arms.\n\u201c[Eek!]\u201d\nTaken aback for a moment, Lorna clasped his neck. Nabel\u2019s low laughter filled her ears.\nLorna was confused by the unsettling sensation below.\nDue to the manner in which he held her without supporting the hem of her dress, not only was the unmistakable evidence of indiscretion exposed, but her posterior as well.\n\u201cNabel\u2026!\u201d\nIn this world, oh, in this world!\nAs Lorna attempted to cover her face, Nabel let out a soft chuckle.\n\u201cNo one is here, madam.\u201d\n\u201cDo you still not know me so well?\u201d she asked, her voice tinged with disappointment.\nHe gently nibbled on her cheek, and when she opened her eyes, all she saw were empty corridors and stairs. It had been a long time since the knights and maids, who had received his piercing gaze, had vacated their positions.\n\u201cI wanted to serve you quickly, as I sensed your discomfort,\u201d he said, his eyes wrinkling slightly as he smiled. The bright light from the palace\u2019s chandeliers scattered beautifully on his long, golden eyelashes.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked.\nWith a soft touch, their lips met again. Even though she knew no one was around, her cheeks flushed uncontrollably. He seemed particularly mischievous today.\nHis thoughts were truly, wickedly cunning.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nWhile Lorna buried her face in his neck, Nabel crossed the seemingly deserted corridor without a trace of human presence, making his way to her room.\nLeaning forward, he gently pushed open the door with his own hand.\n\u201cI have arrived, my lady.\u201d\nOnly when he spoke in a low voice did Lorna raise her head slightly. Thud. Nabel, who had closed the door somewhat loudly while embracing her, led her straight into the room.\nAs he passed by the desk she occasionally used for tea time or paperwork, he carelessly kicked his foot. At the same time, he once again adjusted her body, holding her closer.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nIn response, Lorna, with her nipples brushing against his chest, let out a soft breath. Her sigh, far removed from pain and suffering, halted Nabel\u2019s footsteps.\n\u201cMy lady?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nStill trying to cool down her flushed cheeks, Lorna met Nabel\u2019s gaze.\nAfter a brief silence, Nabel tilted his head and placed his lips on the tip of Lorna\u2019s nose.\nGently, he flicked his tongue against her upper lip.\nThen, his tongue smoothly infiltrated her slightly parted lips.\nLorna clung to his arm, her deep kiss so intense that it weakened her grip. The strange sensation spread throughout her body, making her lower abdomen tingle.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\nWith nothing to conceal their lower halves, she could distinctly feel her wetness flowing down from her core.\nNabel sat her down on the table as her breathing grew rough.\n\u201cThe fragrance has become stronger.\u201d\nWhat fragrance?\nJust as she was about to speak, Nabel lifted Lorna\u2019s dress.\nThe dampness beneath it was vividly exposed to his sight. His fingers brushed over the slippery path that had reappeared over the traces of dried passion.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\nOf course, he had no intention of making things harder for her.\n\u201cAllow me to tidy up.\u201d\nHe leaned inward, toward Lorna\u2019s inner self.\nDue to the narrow round table, his hand had nowhere to rest and fumbled aimlessly. Nabel assisted by placing his hand on top of his head.\nThe tip of his tongue grazed her moist entrance.\n\u201cAh, hm.\u201d\nThe slurping and sucking sound resonated vividly in the room.\nYet, even more captivating were the sensations travelling up from below, causing Lorna\u2019s legs to tremble uncontrollably. Her spread legs twitched once more.\nHer body, which had reached its climax several times before, now released its tension with ease.\n\u201cHnngh\u2026\u201d\nAs Nabel\u2019s tongue reached the innermost part, Lorna\u2019s waist quivered. Unconsciously, she firmly pressed down on the hand resting on Nabel\u2019s head.\nThis allowed his movements to be transmitted more vividly. Pushed by her lips, he delved deeper into Lorna.\n\u201cAhn!\u201d\nHer toes curled tightly.\nNabel firmly supported her swaying body. Moving along the wet path, he once again brought his lips to the inner side of her thigh.\nThe traces of moisture reappeared inside his lips.\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\nAfter tidying her lower region, Nabel lifted his head again. The sensation of his tongue finally touching her caused Lorna\u2019s empty interior to contract tightly.\n\u201cAh, huh\u2026\u201d\nCompletely relaxed, Lorna embraced him tightly. Nabel wiped away her tears and embraced her once more.\n\u201cRest now, milady.\u201d\nRest deeply. He whispered softly and smiled.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to sleep soundly. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\nIndeed, it was true.\nNo other thoughts came to mind.\nOnly traces of love covered her entire being. Her lower region still felt warm, as if it were throbbing. Perhaps because she hadn\u2019t reached the pinnacle completely.\nEven though she had reached climax several times.\nLorna blushed. Her pent-up breath escaped continuously from within his embrace.\n[Ecstasy.]\nNabel gently placed her on the bed and tidied her hair before lying down beside her. His hands, which had tidied her locks, grazed near her neck.\n\u201c[Sigh]\u201d\nOnce again, Lorna let out a breath, releasing warm exhalations. Unintentionally, she tightly grasped Nabel\u2019s hand.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAnd with a rushing thought, Nabel\u2019s eyes widened.\nUnable to articulate those secret emotions, Nabel quietly burst into laughter.\n\u201c[Sob]\u201d\nShe twisted her body.\nShe, too, was aware of her own peculiarity.\nHer body seemed to melt on the bed as if it would collapse at any moment. Nevertheless, amidst her exhaustion, she yearned for him.\nShe wanted to fall asleep with him. She wanted to embrace him more deeply and fall asleep.\nShe wished to awaken with such warmth tomorrow morning.\n\u201cYou take care of even my desires so meticulously\u2026\u201d\nNabel\u2019s low voice resonated above her chest. His hand, dampened by her dress, brushed against her chest before moving downward.\nAlready, the lower regions were once again damp. The effort he had put into tidying it up seemed futile. His hand slipped back inside her.\nLorna\u2019s knees rested against Nabel\u2019s shoulders. Nestled between her spread legs, Nabel once again found his place.\n\u201cSigh\u2026 Huh\u2026\u201d\nThis penetration was gentle, yet equally provocative.\nAs if the promise of putting her to sleep were someone else\u2019s words, his firmly erect member penetrated her depths.\nIt scratched against her walls, delving into the deepest recesses.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nA sensation as if her insides were being pushed upward.\nNabel, who had pressed firmly into her depths, pulled back. Then, in an instant, he thrust the tip of his p***s back in.\n\u201cHuh!\u201d\nA high-pitched moan echoed through the bedroom. The bed sheets followed suit, undulating violently as his rapid movements shook her from beneath.\n\u201cSigh, ah, mm, huh\u2026\u201d\nHer inner walls tightened around him as if they had never known fatigue. Nabel\u2019s breath simmered, stirred by a more intense stimulation than before.\n\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\nExhaling a warm breath, he climaxed inside her once again.\nIn that moment, Lorna, dishevelled, lost consciousness.\nIt felt as though she had sensed the touch of a hand sweeping her hair into place.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Being well-versed in handling extensive information, even without receiving additional reports, he could know where Nabel had gone.\n\u201cHe seems to be in Lady Lorna\u2019s bedroom.\u201d\nEven without looking, she pretended to know. It would be wise not to disturb the two\u2019s time as much as possible, but today was inevitable.\nThe investigation results finally came out while the master was absent.\nNisha looked down at the fluttering piece of paper.\n[Report on the Internal Mist of the Royal Palace]\nThe document bearing the seal of Matap was written by Lucel himself.\nIt was about what had happened in the corridor where both the master and the owner of the greenhouse were present. The investigation results came out like lightning, even without urging Matap.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nHe raised his brow with a frown. It was time for him to be a knight without any sense.\nHe was truly sorry, but it was better for his neck to be cut off than not to inform the master of the danger.\nWith thoughts that were both like him and not like him, Nisha quickly made her way.\n\u201c?\u201d\nOn the way to Lorna\u2019s bedroom, he saw Lin. She was heading downstairs. Nisha narrowed her eyes.\nIt was rare for the exclusive maid of the owner to leave her post.\nBut the report was more urgent.\nHe glanced at Lin, who was quickly moving away, and then headed for Lorna\u2019s bedroom.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

However, he could do so if only two conditions were met.\nLorna would be within reach, and there would be no presence that posed a threat to her anywhere nearby. In other words, there would be no one making a sound.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nToday was a day when the second condition was not fulfilled.\nNabel narrowed his eyes at the sound of footsteps coming from the end of the hallway.\nHe knew whose footsteps they were. It was Nisha\u2019s gait, someone who knew that the master\u2019s ears were overly sensitive.\nIt was clear why someone capable of walking silently would make the sound of footsteps. It was a sign that it was almost time for him to wake up.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nHis gaze turned to the clock. 5:44. Considering the time he fell asleep, waking up so early was excessive. However, as the ruler of the kingdom, it was right for him to wake up at this moment in order to attend to his duties.\n[Sigh]\nHe placed a kiss on Lorna\u2019s forehead, filled with regret. The person who desired nothing but to fall into a deep sleep seemed to have had their wish granted.\nOr perhaps they were having a somewhat sweet dream. He tidied Lorna\u2019s disheveled hair.\nThe face that was smiling slightly was adorable. His fingertips came close to Lorna\u2019s lips and then pulled away. He did not want to wake her up accidentally.\nHe rose from the bed without making a sound and put on his robe. The traces of last night were concealed beneath the pristine white robe. Nabel glanced at the mirror briefly before approaching the door. Having spent a difficult childhood, he needed very little in terms of personal belongings.\n[Thunk]\nUpon opening the door, Nisha was already waiting in front. Nabel\u2019s attire might be considered too lightweight to be the attire between a knight and a ruler, but Nisha\u2019s gaze did not waver.\n\u201cIt\u2019s urgent.\u201d\nNabel\u2019s words fell briefly. The rest would be more comfortably discussed in front of the desk.\nNisha lowered her head deeply. She pulled out a few pages from the stack of documents she was holding and handed them to Nabel.\n\u201cThe investigation results regarding the fog in the corridor, which you ordered to be investigated at Martop, have arrived.\u201d\nNabel narrowed his eyes. There was no way he hadn\u2019t heard that report. It was an incident that occurred right in the middle of the palace, and moreover, right in front of the king.\n\u201cIs it confirmed to be a poison?\u201d\nNabel asked in a low voice.\nAs expected, he would ask whether the incident was the mischief of the Southern Continent Temple, especially Lady Rida\u2019s misdeeds.\nAnticipating that the conversation would be prolonged, he closed the door silently. In the corridor, all the eyes of the subordinates were cast down, unable to face the emperor dressed so lightly while reading the documents.\nNabel paid them no mind and continued reading through the documents.\n\u201cIt is certain that it was not a drug or a device. It was inflicted by a blade.\u201d\nThe most obvious thing to consider would be smoke containing poison. However, if that were the case, Nisha would not have been able to move so freely or cut through it with her sword.\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore, Martop immediately began tracking the magician\u2026\u201d\nNesha bowed her head in embarrassment.\n\u201cThe trail was lost at the Gwibing Palace. Lucel personally investigated, but he couldn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\n\u201cLucel?\u201d\nNabel\u2019s movement came to a halt.\nCurrently, excluding the owner of the Divine Beast in the Suh Empire\u2019s royal palace, Lucel was the highest-ranking mage in the Matap. If there was a mage that he couldn\u2019t track down, it meant they had stayed on the eighth step or higher, indicating a mage of at least that level.\nNabel knew only one person who fit that description, no, two people.\nOne was someone sleeping peacefully inside the door he guarded, and the other was someone he absolutely had to kill.\n\u201cGenas Miltan.\u201d\nThe low, hoarse voice carried a clear threat.\nNesha bowed her head.\n\u201cAmong the people who entered with immunity, there was certainly no Genas Miltan. Lucel is investigating whether he used a disguise spell or employed another method.\u201d\nIt wouldn\u2019t yield good results even if they investigated like that. It was common knowledge that the higher the step, the more significant the gap between each stage. Even if there was only a finger\u2019s difference between the first and second steps, there was an immense chasm between the eighth and ninth steps, something unimaginable.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHow on earth did that bastard come here?\nNabel squinted his eyes.\nNo matter how high the mage\u2019s level was, he was still a living being. If it was a living organism, it would get tired, and there had to be a limit to its power.\nMoreover, Genas couldn\u2019t even properly handle his own magical power. The traces of that overwhelming magic he had shown Lucel last time were evidence of that.\nSomething was strange.\n\u201cWhen we fought last time, he had already exhausted his magical power.\u201d\nIt was certain if he went to the extent of leaving behind traces.\nBut to enter the tournament?\nAnd even to the Defense Magic stronghold where Nesha had torn through the mist, which was the most heavily fortified palace.\nThere was something he didn\u2019t know on this side.\nNabel\u2019s eyes narrowed. It would have been suicidal to bring his body all the way to the magical barrier, so he must have employed a different method.\n\u201c\u2026I have a bad feeling about this.\u201d\nNabel uttered his words, as if chewing on them.\nThe intuition he had honed on the battlefield was calling out to him. He looked out of the window.\n\u201cFor now\u2026\u201d\nNabel began.\nEven if there were a master of gods on this side, they could not match the magical knowledge possessed by Genas.\nHowever, Lucel, who possessed magical knowledge, was unable to stop Zenas due to his weak magical power.\nThe situation was unfavourable.\n\u201cRaise the security level to the highest. And especially forbid anyone other than the 0th and 1st Knight Orders from entering the main palace.\u201d\nIt was best not to allow any suspicious individuals to pass through.\nIt would inevitably disrupt their work, but there was no other choice when there were outsiders present.\nNo matter how powerful a mage might be, unless they were Zenas himself, they couldn\u2019t simply blast through the powerful magical barriers surrounding the palace.\n\u201cI accept the mission.\u201d\nNesha bowed deeply.\nNabel turned his gaze away from him, looking out through the window. The outside appeared dimly lit, with the sky covered in dense clouds.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nIt seemed that rain would come soon.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "120": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-120/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe knight of the Zeroth Brigade, Sir Lee, contemplated the imminent danger of his neck being snapped and plummeting downward.\nHe glanced downward without even tapping the pulled neck.\nOnly after he thought that if he were to be ambushed from the side, his neck would be broken and he might die, did he gesture to the knight beside him.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNo words were exchanged between them. Along with them, Knight Rody, who had been gazing downward, made a gesture.\nFinally, Lee loosened his body by turning his neck back and forth. The space where the two of them were wedged was none other than the area above the ceiling.\nThe reason they were wedged in this place, even among the eccentric members of the Zero Brigade, rumoured to be a bit strange, was simple. Below them was the bedroom of Lady Rida.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLady Rida, while inside the blanket, had been making suspicious noises earlier. Lee opened his mouth with a very small voice that only circled inside his own mouth.\n\u201cIs she indulging in a hobby inside the blanket?\u201d\n\u201cThat seems to be the case.\u201d\nThey were not in a very good mood. Of course, they had no objections to guarding Lady Rida, as ordered by their lord.\nHowever, they never expected to witness Lady Rida\u2019s disorderly nocturnal activities.\nLee couldn\u2019t hide his perplexed expression as he thought about the several guests who sneaked into the bedroom last night.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t she from a temple?\u201d\nNaturally, it was a remark referring to Lady Rida.\nPeople from the temple usually emphasized their lifelong purity as a symbol of dedicating their bodies to the gods first.\nNo matter how Lady Rida had entered the noble family and become a sorceress, it was so absurd that it was beyond extraordinary.\nWhen Lee carefully observed their nocturnal activities, he realized that they were even the palace astrologers.\nWhether they were affected by magic or were individuals with strange gleaming eyes.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLee\u2019s expression, which had to report even information about their nocturnal activities, was extremely embarrassing.\nAs an informant, according to my judgement, there should be no information to report. Whether it was a word that came out in the middle of their nocturnal activities or in the middle of their official duties, everything had to be recorded and delivered.\nOf course, I had to report in detail about those who inserted their belongings between Lady Rida\u2019s legs.\n\u201cYou said you would sleep early.\u201d\nLee, who had finished his neck exercise, looked down again. His neck condition had improved since earlier.\nUntil he finished his exercise, the Countess remained hidden in the blanket. He listened attentively.\n\u201cThe sound of breathing is not the sound of a sleeping person.\u201d\n\u201cThe sound of a person trying to fall asleep was barely audible,\u201d said Knight Rody. The person attempting to fall asleep gradually took longer breaths, transitioning into a more tranquil state.\nHowever, isn\u2019t it more rugged than someone who is awake?\nBoth of them held their breaths entirely. It was as if they had suppressed even the sound emanating from themselves. Lady Rida was clearly not only incapable of falling asleep but also lacked any inclination to do so.\n\u201cWhat on earth is buried in the blanket\u2026?\u201d she questioned in a hushed voice. The sight of being buried within the blanket seemed even more suspicious.\nThey had been given strict orders to observe without interfering, so they couldn\u2019t lift the blanket to investigate. However, it was also impossible for them to see through the blanket.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThey were instructed to disregard anything suspicious.\nHe recalled the command relayed to him by Nisha. Magicians, especially those hailing from the Southern Continent\u2019s temple, were instructed to unconditionally disregard any suspicious actions.\nHe placed his hand on the hilt of his sword. Nevertheless, there was room for hesitation. Losing just his own life would be acceptable. However, rumours of a knight pointing his sword at a guest of the palace would not bode well diplomatically. It could even become a burden to their lord.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe faint light of the morning seeped into the room. It wasn\u2019t the bright sunlight of yellow hues, but rather a dense and humid atmosphere that filled the room.\nOn days like this, something usually unfortunate would occur\u2026\nWith such thoughts in her mind, Lee suddenly widened her eyes.\nThere was swirling mist.\n\u201c!\u201d\nAt first, she thought it might be dust rising. However, there was no one moving in the vicinity, and dust suddenly appearing in a place devoid of human presence was out of the question. And above all, Nisha\u2019s warning.\nBeware of moving mist.\n\u201c!\u201d\nGripping her sword, leaped from the ceiling space. The debris from the ceiling, pushed away by her, fell to the ground a moment later.\n[Clang!]\nWithout even a moment to look ahead, Lee thrust her sword forward. The debris falling to the ground after her collided with the mist and shattered into pieces.\n\u201c!\u201d\nWhat on earth is this!\nThe swirling mist had undoubtedly been cut. However, a thicker mist obscured her vision.\n[Flash!]\nThe sound of Rody\u2019s sword colliding with something came from beside her. It was the sound of Rody\u2019s sword blocking something. Despite it likely being nearby, his figure was completely invisible.\nLee swung her sword again.\n[Whoosh!]\nAmidst the momentarily receding mist, Lady Lee\u2019s bed came into view. Without hesitation, she swung her sword vigorously in that direction.\n\u201c!\u201d\nThe billowing gusts scattered the blankets, unveiling a lady of unblinking eyes, unscathed by the tumult. In her hand gleamed a jet-black magic stone, pulsating with mysterious power.\n\u201cBehold\u2026!\u201d\nLee\u2019s voice broke the silence. A mist surged towards him.\n\u201cUgh!\u201d\nThe infiltrating mist writhed within his mouth, stirring his very being.\nBefore losing consciousness, he distinctly witnessed it.\nA dark pattern, emanating from Lady Rida\u2019s palm.\n***\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d Lin\u2019s mood felt peculiar today.\nIt was already the umpteenth time. She was gazing out the window, holding a laundry basket.\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d\nThe outside had unusually gloomy weather.\nA rainy day.\nIt hadn\u2019t been like this until last night.\nI should quickly close the window.\nHastily, she changed her steps upon realizing she was on the basement level. Startled by this revelation, she wondered, \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt was when she tilted her head in confusion that she heard it.\n\u201cKill that woman.\u201d\nA strong voice echoed in her mind, causing Lin to widen her eyes.\n\u201cBring an end to that woman\u2019s life,\u201d the command was uttered.\nLin\u2019s eyes widened, as if her mind had been struck by something.\nYet, nothing lingered in her thoughts.\n\u201c\u2026Are you very weary?\u201d Lin shifted her steps. She was already on the second floor. She couldn\u2019t fathom when her pace had quickened so abruptly.\nRaindrops fell relentlessly. She reached the third floor.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "121": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-121/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, there were many visitors in Lorna\u2019s room. It was only natural during the Tournament period, where the owner of the Shinsoo took center stage.\nLorna seemed to have grown more accustomed to the sorcerers, especially after the incident with the Light Magic, which almost cost her life at Matap. Thanks to the caution shown by the sorcerers, who were afraid of her due to the misused magic, Lorna no longer felt easily startled in their presence.\n\u201cThen I shall inform them in the banquet hall. They said you will be coming down soon.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, if you are not feeling well, you don\u2019t have to come down!\u201d\nThe sorcerers of Matap, who wished for Lucel, repeated their greetings to her several times before finally leaving. What they left behind was a draft of a magical research plan, obtained after a heated argument among the sorcerers, which lasted until late at night.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\nLorna chuckled softly as she looked at the research plan, showing traces of her contemplation. Lucel had taken the time to explain it in detail to her, even adding additional explanations to the plan.\nHowever, it was not easy enough to understand at a glance.\nAt that moment, there was a small commotion outside the door.\nWondering what it could be this time, Lorna looked and saw it was different sorcerers. This time, they were not from Matap but from the Central Temple of the Continent.\n\u201cCome in.\u201d\nLorna let out a small laugh. Behind her, Lin unintentionally glared at the sorcerers with a sharp gaze.\nIt was an uncharacteristic gaze. The sorcerers who received that gaze looked at her with half confusion and half surprise.\nWhy do people keep coming?\nLin felt that her thoughts were racing inside her head.\nShe kept getting angry.\nThere might be guests coming to see the young lady because they have something to tell her. Especially during the Tournament period, where the owner of the Shinsoo took center stage, it was only natural that there would be many people looking for the young lady.\nYet, she couldn\u2019t understand why she was getting so angry.\nIt would be better to let the young lady be alone for a while.\nIt was a strange feeling. She felt tension in her hands, and for some reason, she only saw the necks of the sorcerers. The sorcerers, who had no armour to protect themselves, only wore robes over their plain clothes.\nThey were people who had no defense equipment. If their necks or hearts were pierced, they would quickly die and collapse.\nLost in her thoughts, Lin\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cLin?\u201d\nThe one who called her with a soft voice was Lorna\u2019s knight, Nen.\nLin snapped back to her senses.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Are you feeling unwell?\u201d\nShe tilted her head slightly. It was only natural, as she could sense the energy from the servant who knew nothing about offensive skills.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nLin shook her head.\nHer mood was strange, but that was all.\nWith a single demeanour, it was unfitting for me to inconvenience those around me, especially the young lady.\n\u201cEven Mr. Fel, the previous owner of the estate, had visited our central temple along with Lord Shinsoo.\u201d\nThe priest who had come from the central temple seemed to have much to say. Lina listened attentively to his tale, her countenance solemn.\nLin clenched her fist once again.\nCuriously, she despised the sorcerer.\nAn icy shiver ran down her spine, as if she had witnessed something abhorrent.\nShe clenched her fist once more, particularly disturbed by the vase in the room, the dessert plate placed on the round table, and the cup beside it.\nThey were all objects that, if shattered, could harm a person.\n***\nThe end of Lorna\u2019s schedule was barely visible as night fell. Nabel, along with her, occupied a seat in the convention hall.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nI had no idea you\u2019d come.\nTraditionally, the convention hall\u2019s events had little involvement from the royal family. Of course, that custom had become increasingly blurred since Archmage Fell\u2019s time.\nNabel naturally took his place beside her.\n\u201cI wanted to be with you.\u201d\nIt struck an odd nerve. There was no doubt that the well-organized reports had no holes. The knights, Lee and Rody, who had been watching Countess Rida, as well as all those who monitored the mages in the Southern Continental Temple, reported that everything was in order.\nBut something felt uneasy.\nNabel\u2019s gaze swept through the hall.\nEspecially his gaze aimed at Countess Rida. Her cheeks were flushed, and she appeared strangely pleased today.\nNabel reached under the table. He wanted to hold Lorna\u2019s hand.\nIf you\u2019re by my side, I can feel the warmth you convey, and then I can be at ease.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nLorna let out a soft laughter. As soon as their hands touched, her joyful emotions flowed directly into Nabel.\n\u201cThere are many people around.\u201d\nHis Majesty should exude majesty. Lorna laughed.\nTo her, Nabel\u2019s current expression seemed somewhat crumbling.\nIt wasn\u2019t a chilly gaze.\nThough it may be directed at others, at least when looking at Lorna, it was a warm gaze that melted away. And above all, Lorna knew that his hands were trembling.\nWhy is this happening?\nLorna gently tapped his shoulder.\nNabel briefly closed and opened his eyes in response to the comforting touch.\nYou are by my side.\nIt felt like my breath was caught, even if just a little.\nNabel tightly held her hand.\n\u201cSo, they say if you use this magic circle here, the magic power will go haywire!\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve tried it!\u201d\nThe gathering of the sorcerers (?) was gaining more and more heat. Nabel observed them while stroking his chin.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nAs their eyes met, the face of one of the warring sorcerers fell into disarray. Nabel turned to look at Lorna.\nIt was not Emperor Nabel Iber, ruler of the Western Empire, who should be mindful of their presence here. It was Lorna, the mistress of magic.\n\u201cPlease continue,\u201d Lorna said with a smile.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

Just the act of meeting the gaze of the mistress of magic diminished the voices of the sorcerers significantly.\nHowever, the fervent debate continued. Under the table that sustained their heated discussions, a document titled \u201cDifferences in the Thickness of Defensive Magic Circles based on the Amount of Depleted Magic Power\u201d fell to the ground.\nThey were conducting the research desired by the mistress of magic. Those involved in the research may have had differing opinions, but their goals were the same.\nThey were working for the mistress of magic.\nAbove all others, even those wielding the authority of the emperor, they were the ones who would serve the mistress of magic under the name of the gods.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThat would suffice.\nNabel tightly grasped her hand once again.\nThe sorcerers would prioritize the safety of the mistress of magic, no matter the circumstances.\nAs the emperor, he shouldn\u2019t have found it agreeable.\nBut as Nabel, it pleased him immensely.\nHe hoped that Lorna would gain more and more without losing anything.\n***\nIt was a night when rain was falling steadily.Lorna sat on the edge of the bed, gazing out at the balcony.\nThe rain was pouring down so heavily that it seemed impossible to go out.\n\u201cTomorrow, the weather will probably clear up,\u201dLorna said with a perplexed smile.\nSome of the weak wizards were already complaining of sore knees and backaches, lamenting their pain. It felt as if the entire palace was enveloped in a chorus of suffering. Given that the magicians, who had practically occupied the entire palace due to the tournament, were each emitting sounds of agony one by one, it was not surprising to feel that way.\n\u201cIt would be best for you to get some rest early tonight,\u201d Lin said as she broughtLorna a warm cup of tea. It was said to help with sleep.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nDespite the unpleasant weather, it was good if there was no need to go outside. A small smile crept up on the corners ofLorna\u2019s mouth. Soon, it turned into a bitter smile.\nWhen she was young, she was often kicked out of the mansion on rainy days. Especially on days when the rain poured down even harder.\nLorna shook her head, chasing away the unpleasant memories.\nAnd then, she picked up the cup.\nNo, she tried to pick it up.\n[Crash!]\nAt the loud noise,Lorna instinctively flinched. The moment she tried to pick up the cup, the tray that Lin was holding slipped and fell.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cMy word, miss!\u201d\nLin massaged her leg. Fortunately, the hot tea didn\u2019t spill over.\n\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nShe was just startled. While Lin bowed down,Lorna reached out with her hand towards the bedside lamp.\n\u201cBe careful. I\u2019ll turn it on.\u201d\nLin stood up. Why is this happening today? It was when she shook her head a few times and reached out her hand towards the lamp.\n\u201cKill her.\u201d\nThe voice echoed once again, causing Lin to freeze.\n[Click]\nHer hand turned on the lamp. The only ones visible in the room were the two of them. Since they couldn\u2019t keep watch until she fell asleep, the other knights were undoubtedly guarding outside the room with great solemnity.\nOf course, it was said that there were many eyes and ears within the palace, so they were not the only ones responsible for protecting the owner of the sacred beast.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nLin lowered her head, her eyes catching sight of a large shard of a teacup. As she reached out her hand, the sharp fragment appeared as if it would draw blood upon contact.\nLin\u2019s hand clasped around it.\n\u201cEnd their life,\u201d a voice commanded.\nHer surroundings seemed to blur into a haze, an acrid smoke filling her mind, forbidding any other thoughts from intruding.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nDeath came easily to humans. A mere puncture of the throat or heart, and they would swiftly spew blood and crumple to the floor.\nA merciless notion took hold. Unbeknownst to herself, Lin clenched the shard tightly in her hand, pain piercing through the fog in her mind.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\n\u201cLin!\u201d\nStartled, Lorna grasped her hand. That was the moment.\n\u201cLorna, are you alright?\u201d\nThe voices of knights echoed in her field of view.\nIn Lin\u2019s sight, Lorna\u2019s face, turning towards the door, imprinted itself. At that moment, her mind once again became shrouded in mist.\n\u201cCould you fetch the first-aid kit?\u201d\nLorna\u2019s voice was barely audible. Once again, the voice grew closer.\n\u201cLin, just wait a moment. Let go of that for now\u2026\u201d\nShe felt a hand reaching out. Unconsciously, Lin struck Lorna.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nSurprised Lorna gazed at her.\n\u201cLin?\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLin staggered backward fromLorna. It was an odd sensation. She couldn\u2019t release the shard from her hand. Even though she knew she was bleeding, strength continued to surge into her.\nWith enough force to pierce the person before her.\n\u201cLin?\u201d\nLorna took another step closer to her. With a worried expression of the familiar shadow, Belle sprang forth and brushed against Lin\u2019s leg.\nThe soft touch of Belle\u2019s fur was vivid.\nHowever, Lin couldn\u2019t control her own body.\n[Whimper]\nBelle attempted to encircle Lin\u2019s leg with its body, but Lin only continued to take steps back.\nPlease, don\u2019t.\nShe wanted to say those words, but she couldn\u2019t. Sensing something amiss, Lorna reached out to her.\n\u201cEnd their life!\u201d\nIn that instant, a strong command shook Lin\u2019s mind.\nHer vision blurred. Lin\u2019s hand swung forcefully.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "123": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-123/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scene before Lorna turned pitch-black.\n[Zap!]\n\u201cLin\u2026!\u201d\nBefore she could comprehend what was happening, a metallic clash erupted between Lorna and Lin. More precisely, it was the sound that emanated from the space between Tanya and Lin as she leaped in front of Lorna.\nTanya stood in defense, partially unsheathing her dagger. Clearly, Lin\u2019s irises were tinged with a silvery hue, evident to Tanya as she met her gaze.\n\u201cTanya?\u201d\nLorna could only see Tanya in her field of vision. Lorna tried to move aside to catch a glimpse of Lin\u2019s face.\n\u201cStay right there.\u201d\nTanya restrained Lorna with the hand gripping her arm. As her hand moved, the dagger she had concealed in reverse grip was fully revealed, not a single sound escaping when the blade was drawn.\n[Ping!]\nOnce again, the clash of metal resounded. However, this time it was different. Tanya deflected the sharp shard Lin held by tilting her dagger.\nSharp fragments fell from Lin\u2019s hand. Nevertheless, the sizable piece she clasped remained intact.\n\u201cLin!\u201d\nAs Lin moved, Lorna caught a glimpse of her in her sight. Observing Lin\u2019s irises drenched in silvery radiance, Lorna widened her eyes.\nLin, who originally possessed beautiful brown irises, now resembled a being devoid of reason, with unfocused, silvery irises.\nLin swung her arm again.\n[Thud!]\nTanya grasped her hand. Tanya had an advantage since she was a knight, dealing with an unarmed handmaid who had never undergone combat training.\n\u201cWell,\u201d\nUnintentionally, Tanya faltered in her speech. Even though she was aware of the need to maintain composure at all times in her position, she could not prevent her thoughts from proliferating.\nShe vaguely realized that asking if she should kill Lin would inflict wounds upon her mistress. It was the first time Tanya, since gripping the blade, experienced such complex emotions.\nHowever, there was no time to linger on them. Lin swung her arm once more.\n\u201c!\u201d\nIt was an attack disregarding her own physical well-being. Lin\u2019s arm twisted at a grotesque angle, slipping out of Tanya\u2019s grasp.\nLin\u2019s hand, smeared with blood, again drew a diagonal path, clutching a shard. Tanya deflected the assault, aiming for her left shoulder, with the broad side of her blade.\n[Thud!]\nUnexpected attacks continued, but Tanya managed to fend them off. However, if such unorthodox attacks persisted, it would become perilous.\n\u201cLorna, my lady?\u201d\nLorna watched the scene with wide-open eyes. Above all, she couldn\u2019t tear her gaze away from Lin\u2019s irises.\nA peculiar sensation emanated from those irises. It felt as if she was locking eyes with someone else.\n\u201cLorna, my lady!\u201d\nWith a sense of urgency, Tanya called out to Lorna, jolting her back to reality.\n\u201cPlease, subdue her.\u201d\nThe words slipped into her throat like a whisper, careful not to cause any pain. I believed my request to Tanya was selfish, or so I thought.\nShe wished for neither of them to get hurt. Bell, who heard her wish, emerged from her shadow.\n[Nyoo!]\nA burst of blue light radiated from Bell\u2019s floating body. A translucent blue barrier enveloped the forms of Lin and Tanya.\n\u201c!\u201d\nTanya was momentarily surprised, but that was all. Upon hearing Lorna\u2019s command, she placed her hand behind the hilt of her blade, pushing away Lin\u2019s attack.\nThe bluish shield shifted and swayed in response to their movements. Tanya\u2019s strikes easily breached Lin\u2019s defense, yet Lin\u2019s attacks were thwarted by the silvery flashes, repelled by the barrier each time.\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nLin\u2019s silver irises furrowed, realizing why her attacks were ineffective. That blue barrier followed the heart of its master. Only those she trusted could pierce through it.\nAnd the one whose eyes shone silver could never penetrate it.\nAt that moment, Tanya closed in on Lin once again. As Lin\u2019s arm buckled under the force, her body was exposed to Tanya\u2019s dark blade.\nSubdue her without killing.\nThat\u2019s how Tanya interpreted Lorna\u2019s command. Swinging the sword she held, she struck horizontally.\n[Thud!]\n\u201cUgh!\u201d\nAn unsettling sound resonated from Lin. Losing her balance, she crumbled to the side. Her hand, still gripping a shard, maintained its tight grip.\nTanya extended her blade forward, intending to completely subdue Lin. Even if she didn\u2019t sever her hand, at least she planned to make her release the shard.\nEver since taking her first steps, Tanya\u2019s eyes, gripping the sword, saw the clear path for Lin\u2019s potential attacks. Identifying blind spots was a fleeting task.\n\u201c!\u201d\nThen, Lin\u2019s hand swung unexpectedly. It was a direction completely different from what Tanya had anticipated.\n[Whoosh!]\nA burst of crimson spurted forth.\n\u00a0\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "124": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-124/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLin felt trapped in the midst of clouds.\nWhen she was young, she had imagined that being inside these clouds in the sky would be warm and soft, just like how she imagined it.\nBut if this place was indeed inside the clouds, it seemed unlike what her younger self would have described. The fog that surrounded her caused a stinging pain with every touch.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nHer voice felt trapped within her throat, unable to escape. And the fog, it seemed to be closing in on her, as if imprisoning her. Lin hunched her body, becoming smaller and smaller. The fog filled the entire black space, pressing against her and suffocating her.\nIt was terrifying.\nTerrifying, yet she desperately searched her surroundings.\nShe was certain that before being trapped within this place, she had desperately wanted something. As she thought about it, she looked down at her hands, which were met with a sharp pain.\nHer hands were drenched in blood. Clenched within her hand was a sharp, bloodstained shard.\nThe moment she realized it, the fog in front of her dissipated. Lin thought she could detect an unusual, putrid smell emanating from the fog.\nIt was in that moment of contemplation.\nWith a sharp sound, a metallic resonance echoed between her hand and Tanya\u2019s sword. Despite trying to retreat from the distant pain, her body refused to obey.\n\u201cShall I subdue her?\u201d\nTanya\u2019s words sounded as if they were coming from a distance. It was clear that Tanya was speaking right in front of her, but her body did not listen as if it wasn\u2019t her own.\nLin wanted to step back. Behind Tanya\u2019s shoulder, she caught a glimpse of Lorna\u2019s startled face.\n\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d\nShe wanted to calm the startled woman. However, her body moved in the opposite direction. Once again, something sharp swung towards Tanya as Lin exerted force with her hand.\nAt that moment, a blue membrane enveloped her body. Her mind filled with uncomfortable emotions. Lin knew that it wasn\u2019t her own thoughts, but the thoughts of the one controlling her.\n[Crack!]\nUnlike before, Tanya forcefully struck her hand, causing Lin\u2019s hand to hit the ground. A moment later, pain surged through her body as she made contact with the floor. She didn\u2019t even have time to cry out in pain.\n\u201cKill!\u201d\nA strong voice resounded in her mind once again. Lin wanted to cover her ears. No, even if she covered her ears, that bright voice would continue to echo within her head.\nVarious paths to throw the sharp shard at Lorna, causing harm, appeared in her mind. Thoughts and knowledge she had never known before attempted to control her.\nTanya approached. She wouldn\u2019t kill her. Lin was sure of that because she had seen Tanya several times before.\nBut the thoughts resonating in her mind were different.\n\u201cIf you let yourself be subdued, it\u2019s over!\u201d\nWith that thought, Lin\u2019s gaze shifted toward Lorna. More precisely, it was the deity standing beside Lorna.\nThe heart of the fox stood out conspicuously. Lin felt as if she knew exactly how that heart looked, how it shone with a vibrant red hue. As if she had held it in her hand. As if she had squeezed it.\nIn that instant, a sharp command echoed in Lin\u2019s mind.\n\u201cDie!\u201d\nLin couldn\u2019t perceive how the command had changed. Her thoughts, slower than usual, couldn\u2019t hinder her body from moving as it pleased.\nHer hand twisted at an eerie angle, tearing at her own neck.\nBlood splattered.\n***\n\u201cLin!\u201d\nLorna exclaimed, startled, as he approached Lin. Tanya had already completely subdued Lin\u2019s hand, but her expression couldn\u2019t conceal her defeat.\nThe shimmering in her eyes was undoubtedly a result of someone manipulating her mind. They were trying to make her lose consciousness altogether.\nAt best, they thought they could make her attack me or Lorna, one or the other. That\u2019s all they needed to prevent.\nHowever, it seemed that the sorcerer controlling her body had something else in mind.\nThere was a long shard of glass lodged in Lin\u2019s throat.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nTanya was rendered speechless. She was already a woman of few words, but now she had even less to say.\nThe shard of glass had pierced her artery precisely. Tanya\u2019s clothes were dark, so the bloodstains wouldn\u2019t show, but it wasn\u2019t the same for Lorna\u2019s clothes.\n\u201cLin!\u201d\nLin\u2019s eyes returned to their original colour from the shimmering silver.\nLorna grabbed hold of Lin\u2019s hand. Tanya\u2019s subdued hand trembled uncontrollably. It was the aftermath of the excessive contortions caused by the one who had manipulated her body.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nHowever, Lin couldn\u2019t feel any pain. Everything before her eyes had already become blurry. It felt more vivid than when she was trapped in the clouds, but still, her consciousness was rapidly fading away.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nLin tightly grasped Lorna\u2019s hand. The hand stained with thick blood clasped the hand of its owner. Lin had never before held Lorna\u2019s hand with such a contaminated hand.\n\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d\nLin\u2019s head still felt as though it were ringing. A certain corner of her mind didn\u2019t feel refreshed, as if there were some foreign substance present.\nBefore her eyes, a divine figure, Belle, suddenly appeared.\n\u201cLin.\u201d\nLorna lowered her head as if to say not to speak. She hoped the injured area would heal. Belle\u2019s body responded to her thoughts, shimmering with a bluish light.\n[Uuung!]\nThe healing light was drawn into Lin\u2019s body. In that moment, as the silver light burst forth again, Belle paused.\nMhm?\nBelle\u2019s magic didn\u2019t respond within Lin\u2019s body. More precisely, the wounds were healing ever so slightly, but it was too slow to save her life.\n\u201cYou\u2019re interfering.\u201d\nTanya exclaimed, with a surprised expression, as she tried to heal Lin\u2019s wounds. Her touch was also rejected by the silvery barrier.\nThat barrier wasn\u2019t meant to save Lin. It was created by the one who had controlled her to kill her.\n\u201cWe need to remove that barrier first!\u201d\nLorna widened her eyes. As Tanya spoke, Belle\u2019s foreleg touched the silvery barrier. Crackling sounds, sparks flew.\nThe healing wounds reopened, and the blood flowed even faster.\n\u201cMiss..\u201d\nShe grasped Lorna\u2019s hand, the moment he realized what was lurking in his mind.\nIt was the puppeteer of her being.\nVaguely, she glimpsed the marionettist controlling her amidst the clouds. The putrid-scented figure stood far beyond her reach, in a place she couldn\u2019t immediately thwart.\nHer light of life was rapidly dwindling. Despite the clamour of the knights who threw away their medical kits and called for the doctor, their voices reverberating through the surroundings, her gaze fixated only on Lorna.\nShe spoke.\n\u201cMademoiselle.\u201d\nA hushed voice reached Lorna, causing her eyes to widen.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

In the moment Lin\u2019s hand flinched, she clearly saw Belle\u2019s body become translucent.\nAs a deity, Belle couldn\u2019t be touched by Lorna if she didn\u2019t trust her, but Lin had always been able to touch Belle. But not now. Lin\u2019s hand simply passed through Belle\u2019s front paw. Lorna was speechless at the sight.\nShe detested herself for suspecting Lin, or more precisely, for being repulsed by her own fear that Lin would swing her hand like before.\nShe distinctly saw Lin\u2019s hand tremble in its final moments. Lin must have not wanted to hurt her. In truth, Lorna already knew.\nLin was someone who would rather die than harm Lorna.\n\u201cLin.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t, be too startled\u2026\u201d\nA small voice echoed. The commotion caused by Tanya and the other knights ceased. Except for the knights who had gone to find a doctor, the others changed their destination.\nIt was because they caught a strong scent of death in her voice.\n\u201cLin!\u201d\nLorna tightly grasped her hand. For the first time in her life, Lin didn\u2019t obey her master\u2019s words.\n\u201cMiss.\u201d\nWith a voice that seemed to say, \u201cListen to me,\u201d a very faint voice trembled.\nLorna\u2019s words stopped.\nBelle was desperately trying to heal Lin, but the silver magic thoroughly interfered with her. She couldn\u2019t completely push away the deity\u2019s magic, but it seemed enough to buy time to prevent Lin\u2019s death.\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold back your tears.\u201d\nLin wanted to reach out and wipe her owner\u2019s tears.\nHowever, Tanya still hadn\u2019t released her hand. It was for Lorna\u2019s safety.\nLin was actually grateful for that. She didn\u2019t know when she would transform again. She didn\u2019t know when the lurking enemy in the depths of her mind would target Miss.\n\u201cLin, don\u2019t speak,\u201d\nLorna couldn\u2019t continue her words. In her eyes, Lin\u2019s complexion was rapidly growing pale. She could see the purple-tinted lips drying up.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s too difficult, rest.\u201d\nLin didn\u2019t listen to her owner\u2019s words. Her trembling hand tightly held Lorna\u2019s hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry, but, Miss..\u201d\nDue to the injury on her neck, her voice trembled greatly.\nHowever, Lorna\u2019s complete attention was focused on Lin, so she didn\u2019t reach the point where she couldn\u2019t understand. She somewhat mysteriously understood that small voice, which seemed to be partly buried in her throat and partly wandering inside her mouth.\n\u201cDo not, give up on everything.\u201d\nAchieve everything you desire.\nLin had so much to say. If she were still a sorceress, she might have found a way to leave her words behind. But her voice no longer came out.\nInstead, she continuously spoke, hoping to be transmitted. That voice eventually couldn\u2019t even escape her throat.\n\u201cIt was nice to see you living here peacefully.\u201d\nIt was Belle\u2019s magic to convey her words. Despite the interference of shimmering magic, it was not difficult to convey Lin\u2019s thoughts from such a close distance.\nLorna\u2019s eyes widened at the sound of Lin\u2019s voice echoing in her mind.\n\u201cFeel free to cry if it\u2019s hard, but don\u2019t collapse.\u201d she said.\nLin seemed unaware if her words were being heard. Instead, she moistened her dry lips several times.\n\u201cMake all your wishes come true.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry if your desires seem unjust.\u201d\n\u201cA magician is someone who fulfills all their desires.\u201d\nSeveral thoughts simultaneously invaded Lorna\u2019s mind. She clenched her lips together tightly. Or perhaps she felt like crying.\nShe didn\u2019t want her vision to blur. That\u2019s why she tightly shut her eyes and opened them. In her slightly teary field of view, she slowly witnessed Lin\u2019s life slipping away.\n\u201cSo dream of more things.\u201d\n\u201cAs you dream, I hope you have everything.\u201d\nLorna lowered her head.\n\u201cI wish you didn\u2019t die.\u201d\nThat was her wish. However, the shimmering magic blocking Lin\u2019s body was relentless. There was only one person with enough magical power to withstand pouring out the powerful magic of a deity.\nGenas Miltan.\nUnbeknownst to herself, Lorna tightly grasped Lin\u2019s hand.\nThe eyes of the knights who had been watching them met with a poignant understanding. They realized that Lin\u2019s life had already crossed the Lin that should not be crossed.\nNo matter how formidable one\u2019s magical power was, it was impossible to save someone who had already suffered severe injuries and was on the threshold of death.\nIf the master of the deities could reverse everything, it would not be the one most cherished by the gods, but the deity itself.\nLin\u2019s hand grew cold rapidly. Lorna had no choice but to watch her breath cease.\n***\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "126": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-126/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe master of the spirit beast was called the child of the divine, for the spirit beast granted the master\u2019s desires with its formidable magical powers.\nLike a benevolent deity who did not overlook even a small tantrum of a child.\nHowever, the master of the spirit beast was not divine. The spirit beast was merely an extension of the divine\u2019s touch, not the divine itself. And so, the master of the spirit beast also experienced loss.\nThe news of Lin\u2019s death quietly spread throughout the castle. It was too urgent to hide from the knights who sought a physician. The rumours spread like wildfire.\n\u201cDream for more.\u201d\nLorna was inside the room. Lin\u2019s blood still stained her hands, untouched. Her clothes were soaked in blood as well. The maid who should have tidied her clothes had entered the cold grave.\nThere were many maids in the castle. There were also many noble maids who served the master of the spirit beast. However, Lorna dismissed them all. She couldn\u2019t bear to have someone else take Lin\u2019s place.\nThey said a magician was a dreamer. They said the master of the spirit beast, at the pinnacle, was capable of fulfilling all dreams.\nBut she couldn\u2019t save a single life of the one she desired.\nLorna looked out the window. If it were her wish, the pouring rain outside could cease.\nPerhaps she should have made another wish at that time.\nInstead of a vague wish to save Lin, couldn\u2019t she have wished to somehow stop the flow of Lin\u2019s blood?\nAlthough she knew it was an absurdity, although she knew that the silvery magic hindered everything, she couldn\u2019t help but regret.\nIt seemed to be because of her.\nIf I had more knowledge of magic, like Genas Miltan, who, despite being surpassed in magical power by the master of the spirit beast, could have thwarted her wishes, maybe I could have saved Lin somehow, the thought floated through her mind.\nThe image of Tanya gently closing Lin\u2019s eyes remained vivid. As her hand brushed down the face, Lin\u2019s brown irises concealed themselves. It was hard to believe that she would never open her eyes again.\n\u201cGenas Miltan\u2026\u201d\nLorna murmured the name quietly. The silvery magic, resembling the silvery hair of Genas Miltan, was akin to that colour.\nWhy didn\u2019t I know?\nWouldn\u2019t it have been better if I had asked Bell for a different wish?\nTo kill Genas Miltan\u2026\n\u201cPlease, kill him.\u201d\nIf I had harmed him, Lin would not have died. However, at that moment, I couldn\u2019t entertain such thoughts. I didn\u2019t have any other thoughts while watching Lin\u2019s life slip away before my eyes.\nMy gaze turned towards Lin, who spoke until the moment of his death, urging me to dream more. I couldn\u2019t do anything.\nLin and Nabel felt the same way. Dream more, desire more. Take everything you desire. You have the ability to do so.\n\u201cKyu\u2026\u201d\nBell nestled in her arms. I could feel the soft bundle of fur moving. Lorna closed her eyes as she stroked Bell\u2019s head.\nThere would be no more moments where Lin would stroke Belle.\nWhile others may not know, only Lin and Nabel could touch Belle even when Lorna was asleep. Lorna knew what that meant. It meant that she deeply trusted Lin and Nabel, even in her unconscious state.\nBut now, only Nabel could touch and dote on Bell.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt was strange. I had never thought that I possessed much to hold onto. I must have thought that I should cherish Nabel, Lin, and the others.\nWhen you have nothing, you seem to develop even stronger attachments. So let\u2019s not lose them.\nAnd in the process, I subtly let my guard down. The owner of the mythical beast that everyone looked up to, the possessor of a powerful magic that could even restore a crumbling tower. Perhaps I was intoxicated by those words. Maybe that was why I let my guard down.\nIt was strange. I felt like I would open that door soon, and Lin would come in.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna looked down at her own hands.\nLin\u2019s trembling hand. It should have touched Belle, but it missed. Lin\u2019s hand passed right through Belle\u2019s translucent body\u2026\nPerhaps I was afraid that Lin would attack me.\nLorna bowed her head. A nauseating feeling crept up inside her.\nUntil the moment of his death, Lin sent me such thoughts, and yet, I rejected even the touch of Belle.\nIt must have hurt Lin.\nBeing able to touch Bell and the mythical beast was a symbol of trust even stronger than words.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna clenched her bloodstained hand tightly. At that moment, she suddenly realized something.\nSomeone who had lost something precious like herself. The former owner of a mythical beast who had been betrayed by the person who could touch the mythical beast.\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\nShe had to let Lin go. She didn\u2019t want to entertain any other thoughts.\nYet, she also realized an unpleasant truth.\nOnly those trusted by the owner of a mythical beast can touch it. And when the owner of a mythical beast dies, the mythical beast also disappears. It was only natural since the mythical beast was the embodiment of the magic power closely connected to its owner.\nSo, Fel, the former owner of the mythical beast, who harmed him and took the heart of the mythical beast, must have been someone who Fel deeply trusted. Lorna couldn\u2019t imagine how Fel felt when he died.\nHe must have been overwhelmed by unbearable despair, loss, and betrayal.\nIt was as if Lorna was angry at herself. Angry at herself for not saving Lin.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nLorna knew the culprit. The one who violated the code of honour, seizing their heart with his arcane powers, had only one target left to harm\u2014Lin.\nGenas Miltan.\nLorna clenched his fist, his palm stained with the colour of tears that had fallen to the ground.\nDark thoughts engulfed his mind. Unconsciously, he had restrained his limbs, suppressing the freedom to express his deepest desires, but now those feeble restraints shattered and fell.\nAn evil sentiment arose within him. He welcomed its presence.\nHe yearned to kill Genas Miltan.\nHe longed to inflict upon him the same depths of despair.\nUnbeknownst to her, a tiny prison within her own heart had begun to crumble.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "127": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-127/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sound of raindrops tapping on the window reverberated sharply. Nisha, while piling up new tasks beside her busy master, furrowed her brow ever so slightly.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNabel, seeing the stack of documents, seemed to share Nisha\u2019s thoughts. He narrowed his eyes but remained silent. As the ruler of the Western Empire, which dominated over two-thirds of the continent, there was never a shortage of tasks for the master of the land. Moreover, it was the period when the sorcerers showcased their greatest movements during the annual tournament. There was more than just one or two things to be concerned about.\nYet, on this particular day, Nabel received an unusually large amount of paperwork. Perhaps it was due to the rain, as everyone seemed to have the same idea of finishing quickly and taking a break.\n\u201cIt would be wise to take a short rest.\u201d\nNisha observed Nabel\u2019s complexion. His face seemed somewhat pale. However, his hands and eyes moved at the same speed. Nisha immediately grasped the true state of her master.\nIt was purely his mental strength that allowed him to maintain such a rapid pace of work.\n\u2018For some reason, I have a bad feeling today.\u2019\nHaving expressed his thoughts, the master immediately refocused on his tasks. Glancing briefly outside at the pouring rain was just a momentary distraction. He seemed determined to finish the work swiftly and join Lady Lorna\u2019s side.\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\nNisha also agreed with those words. Strangely, on a day like this when everything seemed to sink in the rainwater, something bad had occurred.\nIt was the same on the battlefield. In this peaceful palace, or rather, what should have been peaceful, one could only hope that nothing was wrong.\n[Thud, thud!]\nAt that moment, the office door shook roughly. Nisha and Nabel almost simultaneously turned their gaze toward the door. Nisha silently prayed that the person standing beyond the door had brought an unnecessary report.\nYes, it must be nothing important.\nNisha\u2019s gaze turned to the clock. It was also the time when the reports from the knights assigned to Lady Lorna and the Southern Shrine people would arrive. There must be reports stating that everything was in order.\n[Thud]\nAs the door swung open, a knight with an anxious expression appeared. It was the face of the Zero Knight, whom Nisha was familiar with.\n\u201cThere are no abnormalities in the other surveillance teams, but we have lost contact with the team monitoring Lady Lorna.\u201d\nThe awaited contact had arrived, but it was not the content they had expected. Well, sometimes, very rarely, those people were prone to neglecting communication. Nisha wanted to believe that.\nThen, from afar in the corridor, the sound of footsteps approaching rapidly could be heard. Nisha leaned her head out beyond the hallway.\nThis time, it was truly urgent news. The knight, who still carried the scent of blood on his clothes, was Arten, the 1st Knight who guarded the vicinity of Lord Shinsoo.\n\u201cLord Shinsoo has been attacked!\u201d\nNabel also heard those words. He jolted up from his seat. The papers he had been looking at soared into the air and fluttered down. Before the papers hit the floor, Nabel had already identified individuals who could potentially be culprits.\nThe sorcerers from the Southern Shrine and the most suspicious individuals monitoring Lady Lorna were at the top of his list. Especially, the fact that there was no report from those who were monitoring Lady Lorna meant that the culprits were almost certainly involved. That was the thought that crossed his mind in an instant.\n\u201cWho is the culprit?\u201d\n\u201cShe is dead.\u201d\nDead? Nabel and Nisha were both taken aback. Arten, who was reporting, uttered a name they could never have imagined.\n\u201cThe culprit is her ladyship\u2019s maid.\u201d\n***\nNabel arrived at the scene somewhat belatedly. Naturally, upon hearing the news, he rushed towards Lorna.\nHowever, it was uncertain who else might have fallen victim to that ethereal magic. As a result, all the journalists present at the scene were quarantined, causing a slight delay in Nabel\u2019s meeting with Lorna.\nSafety was the reason, of course. The time lost was but a fleeting moment. Those courageous individuals who dared to stand in the face of the tyrant from the Sovereign Empire, who cared little for human lives, could only amount to the Zero and First Knight Divisions at best.\n\u201cYour Majesty, only until safety is assured\u2026!\u201d\nThey had to cling to their precious lives and engage in fierce struggle. Thus, Nabel managed to break through the obstructions, undeterred, and entered the premises when night had fallen.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?

    "128": "https://hadese.io/series/eaten-by-the-tyrant-i-raised/chapter-128/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scene was bathed in blood. That blood belonged solely to Lin. Not only Lorna, but Tanya, who was escorting her, and the other knights were unscathed.\nBut Nabel knew. As much as that blood stained the room, Lorna must have been injured as well. She was someone who had never experienced the loss of anything precious.\nLady Rida was someone who would snatch away everything before she even had a chance to grasp it. Thus, Lorna lived in emptiness, even before she could feel the sense of loss.\nSo, it must have been her first time for Your Highness. Losing someone.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nNabel remembered the first time he lost a knight on the battlefield.\nThere were many knights who longed for that splendid era dominated by the purity of Iber. The knights who served the purity of Iber were already lining up in rows outside the palace, waiting to be driven out onto the battlefield. They were crowded at the forefront of the battlefield and died with each battle.\nNabel was the first to harvest such individuals.\nUntil then, he had been haunted by nightmares every time he took a life. He blamed himself, thinking that if it weren\u2019t for him, someone\u2019s child or parent might still be alive. Each time he swung his sword, he realized how many people he was plunging into despair, to the point where his heart almost burst.\nBut still, he couldn\u2019t stop. He had to stay alive. During that time, when he looked only at himself and moved forward, he also lost someone.\nHe thought he had lost everything during the rebellion in Miltan. His mother and father were beheaded, and those who followed the purity of Iber either could no longer enter the palace or had their throats cut and hung on the walls.\nHe thought he had lost everything at that time, so he believed he had nothing left to lose.\nBut that was a mistake.\nHe could never forget the eyes of the knight who died in his place. Knowing how deeply the knights yearned for the day when the purity of Iber would rise again, it added to his burden. That knight would have wanted to see the resplendent Iber dynasty once more.\nAnd he would have wanted something. But he died before he could see it. He realized the feeling of sand slipping away like wind, even though he thought he had something in his grasp. Even when he opened his hand again and clenched it in the air, what had slipped away could not be held on to.\nAt that time, he truly wished to die, forsaking everything. If the only thing he had wished for was the purity of Iber, he might have wavered. How much more would he lose, filled with fear?\nBut he endured because he was looking at Lorna. He had something he must obtain. He had to rise again, trampling countless lives if necessary. There was someone he had to rescue, no matter what.\n\u201cMilady!\u201d\n[Clang!] The door opened. The person he had to rescue was inside the room. In the darkness of the room, where not a single light was lit, covered in blood and with unwashed hands.\n\u201cNabel.\u201d\nLorna turned to face him, her voice a hushed echo within the room. The scene lay just outside, where Lin\u2019s life had been taken.\nAs Nabel entered the room, Belle\u2019s protective azure magical barrier, which had shielded the area from the public\u2019s prying eyes, dissipated.\nFinally, the distant sounds from outside reached Lorna\u2019s ears. They were soft voices, of course. There were no reckless individuals devoid of caution who would raise their voices in the presence of the grief-stricken lord.\nThe two locked gazes. Upon glimpsing Lorna\u2019s eyes, Nabel instantly understood. He could discern it without their hands touching.\nLosing something meant more than merely losing a person for Lorna. The scarcer the precious things, the deeper the attachment. The knight of the battlefield held significance for Nabel as well, but he had not lost the pillar that upheld his life.\nHowever, Lin held a different meaning for Lorna. If Nabel existed as her lover, then Lin had been the friend who had stood by her side from her tender childhood to the present.\n\u201cMy lady.\u201d\nNabel approached her slowly. The scent of blood permeated her room, as if Lorna had been injured. It felt as if he stood amidst a battlefield. Nabel pondered.\nHe was accustomed to the scent of blood, but this particular odor was almost unbearable. It intensified because Lorna knew what it meant.\nTears and blood mingled, staining the pristine white carpet. The darkness of profound loss shimmered within Lorna\u2019s eyes.\nNabel reached out with his gloved hand, extending it towards Lorna\u2019s tear-stained eyes. He removed the rosy locks of hair that concealed her face, then gently placed his hand upon her eyes. Lorna did not resist his touch.\nWarmth enveloped her vision. Unconsciously, she let out suppressed sobs, the sound of stifled weeping resonating in the air.\n\u201cLin told you not to crumble,\u201d Lorna whispered softly, her words barely grazing her lips, reminiscent of what Lin had said before closing her eyes. But Nabel could comprehend her meaning.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cSo, allow yourself to weep for now.\u201d\nShe pleaded for her not to collapse. She implored her to embrace everything she desired. Lorna couldn\u2019t erase the image of Lin, who had only ever thought of her, from her mind.\nIn the presence, she had been unaware. She hadn\u2019t considered that everything around her might crumble, that someone might depart. She had been fearful and anxious, yet she hadn\u2019t entertained the thought that Lin could vanish.\nLin had always felt like someone who would remain by her side, just as she had been since their youth. It seemed only natural. But it hadn\u2019t been so.\nNow, Lin was no more. The absence felt as though half the world had been emptied.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNabel embraced her without a word. As he opened his eyes, his gaze shifted to the lowly creatures who had threatened her, unable to prevent their actions. Outside the door, they bowed their heads, clueless about what to do.\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nYet, it wasn\u2019t their fault. Their hands and feet were mere instruments; their heads were responsible.\nNabel had believed he had been sufficiently vigilant of his surroundings. He had assumed he was prepared for anything. Arrogantly, he had thought that if he blocked the Genas Miltan, his sovereign would never be saddened. He had been akin to a dozing lion, oblivious to what transpired within his dominion.\nBut even that had not been the case. He was but a foolish, small creature. He had done little more than stand on end, with his fur and tail bristling, surveying his surroundings.\nHis opponent was someone well-versed in devouring such a creature.\n\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\nNisha stood in front of the room. Despite receiving icy stares, he did not step aside from the door.\n\u201cThe traces of magic have almost vanished, making it difficult to identify the culprit.\u201d\nThe investigation of the culprit was already underway, following the testimonies of Lorna\u2019s knights. The reason for the tumultuous commotion outside was precisely that.\nThere was no other explanation for Lin\u2019s remarkable agility, considering she had never learned swordsmanship. Especially her silver eyes were evidence of being under someone else\u2019s control.\nThe problem was, who was the culprit? It was too sloppy and amateurish for someone with such immense magical power like Genas Miltan.\nIf Genas Miltan had intended to kill Lorna directly, the easiest way would have been to target the knight beside her. Alternatively, it would have been sufficient to target both the knight and Lin. No matter how strong their mental defenses were, they couldn\u2019t overcome his magical power near the ninth step.\nBut if only Lin had been manipulated, there was only one answer. It must have been someone else who received Genas Miltan\u2019s astrological reading and borrowed his magical power to commit the act.\nAnd the identity of that person was revealed too quickly.\n\u201cHowever, it seems highly likely that Lady Rida Beckshaw controlled Lin. The consciousness of the knights who fell victim to her has returned.\u201d\nLorna halted her movements in Nabel\u2019s embrace. She naturally assumed that Genas Miltan was the culprit. It was an instinctive feeling, and his silvery magical power was an unequivocal proof.\nBut it wasn\u2019t Genas, it was Lady Rida Beckshaw.\nLorna\u2019\u2019s lips tightened.\nHow?\nLady Rida Beckshaw wouldn\u2019t have been able to penetrate the magic barrier of the main palace. Only Genas Miltan, who could resist her will and forcefully break through the barrier, could do it.\nThere could only be some sort of pact between the two.\nNisha lowered his head deeply.\n\u201cLady Beckshaw isn\u2019t present in her residence. It would be difficult to track her down if she teleports out of the castle.\u201d\nThey couldn\u2019t simply let her escape. They would chase her to the ends of not only the Western Empire but the entire continent if necessary, and sever her neck. Nisha couldn\u2019t lift his head. They had no choice but to capture her before she left the castle.\nOtherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the wrath of the Empire\u2019s ruler.\nNisha wasn\u2019t afraid of facing that wrath. But he also knew very little about how unstable his lord could be.\nIn the end, his lord would turn the arrow towards himself. If he failed to capture Lady Rida Beckshaw, his lord\u2019s wrath would be directed at him. Just as his lord had cast him aside after he had shaved himself to reclaim the Empire, his lord would once again discard him.\n\u201cBelle.\u201d\nThen Lorna\u2019s small voice echoed in the room. Nabel looked down at her, but it wasn\u2019t Nabel whom she called.\nHer shadow moved.\n\u201cPrevent anyone from leaving the castle.\u201d\nLorna\u2019s voice was locked. And it trembled softly. Her hand touched Nabel\u2019s hand, which covered her eyes.\nNabel widened his eyes at the surging red emotions that came through. He held Lorna\u2019s hand countless times, but he had never seen this emotion before.\nIt was anger. It was a burning anger that was now a smouldering ember but would soon engulf everything before their eyes in a fiery red rage.\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to read more and get exclusive chapters & early access to new releases?
