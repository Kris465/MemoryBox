The shocking scene couldn’t be seen with the naked eye, so no one knew what exactly happened.\nIt just looked like Gu Ning inexplicably fainted and then woke up naturally.\n\n\n\nGu Ning was a little bewildered as she sat up from the bed, she couldn’t even remember how she had fainted. Those green dots of light that were invisible to the naked eye, entered her body and converged into an ocean, yet it seemed like there weren’t any visible changes made on her.\nRight now she only feels the hunger that’s burning in her belly now, she swears she could eat a whole cow.\n“Gu Ning is awake!” Cheng Ming, who happened to glance into the dormitory room, called out in surprise.\nThe five people in the corridor all crowded into the dormitory room at all once and surrounded Gu Ning, asking:\n“Gu Ning, do you feel sick?”\n“Are you in any pain or discomfort anywhere?”\n“Why did you faint?”\nAlthough it was a bit noisy, those few pairs of concerned eyes made Gu Ning, who had just woken up and was still a bit confused, feel a long-lost warmth soothing her heart.\n“Eh?! Gu Ning’s eyes aren’t green anymore!” Zhang Yang exclaimed in surprise as he stared at Gu Ning’s eyes.\nThe few of them gathered their heads in unison and after staring for a while, they all spoke together at once: “Hey, really!” “It doesn’t seem to be green anymore.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn the contrary, Gu Ning had no idea what they were saying: “What are you guys talking about?”\nWith the demeanour of an adult person, Jia DaoZhang muffled their voices before explaining to Gu Ning: “You suddenly fainted. Gao Yue examined you and found nothing wrong with you physically. But then, as soon as we lifted your eyelids, we saw something like a shiny emerald ring on your eyes. But now it’s gone.”\nGu Ning rightly associated it with the green bead that she had swallowed, and her heart just tightened as she asked: “Is there a mirror?”\nZhang Yang took the small round mirror off the bed frame and handed it to Gu Ning.\nGu Ning took the mirror then first peeled down her lower eyelid a little, no bulging blood vessels were seen, which proved that she had no signs of zombification, which made half of her worries be put aside before she started to thoroughly observe her eyes.\nIf she hadn’t examined her pupils as closely as she’s doing right now, it would have been difficult to see the extremely pale green ring around the edges of her pale pupils. Gu Ning did not feel too alarmed by this, since she already knew that the green colour on both of her eyes was directly connected to the green bead she swallowed. However, less than a week had passed since she was bitten by the zombie, and within this week, she had enough mutations occurring in her body.\nGu Ning now has a bit of a problem *that when one is covered in lice, they don’t feel the itch and when one has too much debt, they stop worrying.\n(T/N: 蝨多了不咬，債多了不愁 shī duō le bù yǎo zài duō le bù chóu. Literally, translate means when you’re covered with lice, you don’t itch and when you’re up to your ears in debt, you stop worrying. This means that when you have too many problems and it became a norm that you will stop worrying about it. )\nSince she couldn’t do anything about it and didn’t know exactly what the changes in her body were, there was also no clear answer no matter how much she pondered about it. Thus, she simply put it aside and considered the immediate reality of the more pressing matters to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShe calmly handed the mirror back to Zhang Yang then asked: “How is my father?”\nCheng Ming spoke: “The operation was a success, Uncle Gu is asleep right now.”\n“Luckily, he was asleep and we didn’t wake him up, otherwise he would’ve had a bad scare if he knew you suddenly passed out.” Jia DaoZhang said, abruptly turning his words around and said: “But there’s another problem, Gu Ning. It’s fine for us to eat biscuits, ham, and sausages every day, but the two patients can’t always follow us in eating like this, can they?”\nHe raised a very practical question.\nIn the current situation, the food supplies they have could last them for a while as they relied on the two big bags of food which Gu Ning brought from the supermarket. Also, Gu Ning was eating almost every day in the other world which saved up a lot of supplies as well. However, Jia DaoZhang was right, they could all deal with it just fine, but Father Gu and Mother Gu were not in good health after all these three months of living in constant fear, chronic sleep deprivation, and malnutrition. Previously Gu Ning was with them daily and didn’t feel anything in particular about it, but the contrast with their other selves in the peaceful world and this world was enough to make Gu Ning’s heartache.\nShe really couldn’t let her parents follow them anymore and only had bread and ham as their daily meals.\nGu Ning suddenly asked: “Zhang Yang, what does Brother San eat for every meal?”\nZhang Yang replied: “Brother San’s just like us, he eats what we eat. He also often takes care of the little children in the colony who have nothing to eat.” He rolled his eyes when he realized why Gu Ning asked this suddenly and spoke again: “Our food was bad. But Bai Lang and Mr. Wang’s food were quite good. Mr. Wang has a big fenced-in yard over the family building where he lives and he has dozens of chickens in it! There are also various vegetables growing in the back of the mountain. More than ten people are assigned to guard it day and night. They are afraid that someone might rob them.” He said halfway and looked at the door, making sure that no one was there before lowering his voice and continuing in a sneaky voice: “Our Brother San already said that we should find a good opportunity to get the chickens and add it to our meal.”\nAs soon as Gu Ning heard the title Mr. Wang, a look of coldness sank beneath her eyes.\nShe killed his nephew as well as some of the underlings which he had sent over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis was the same as Gu Ning slapping Mr. Wang hard in front of the whole colony, and slapping both sides of his face with loud smacks!\nThis was a deadly feud that could not be resolved.\nUnless one of the two dies, or if one of them escapes.\nIn her current situation, Gu Ning couldn’t escape, Father Gu and Mother Gu weren’t in any suitable state to be on the road. Also with Brother San looking after her here and with the fence keeping the zombies away, she wasn’t prepared to leave even if she had to unless this place fell.\nSince she couldn’t leave, Wang JiZhong was even less likely to go.\nIf she didn’t want to die, then Wang JiZhong has to die.\nThinking of this, Gu Ning’s eyes flashed with a hint of murderous intent.\nGu Ning did not hide her killing intent, and those few people standing around her inexplicably felt the temperature in the dorm drop sharply, with chills going all over their bodies.\nThe murderous intent in Gu Ning’s eyes only lingered for a very brief moment before returning to normal.\nShe suddenly remembered something and jerked up her watch to look at it then got startled to see that the time on it read just after four o’clock. She jumped out of the bed and said as she headed out: “I’m going to use the toilet.”\nShe hurriedly headed out, causing the dormitory full of people to freeze for a moment.\n“She didn’t just fall asleep, did she? That is not the state of someone who had just recovered from a fainting spell.” Xie YuHong whispered from the corner.\nEveryone silently but wholeheartedly agreed.\nGu Ning was in such a hurry because she had actually passed out for three hours, and it was already 7:30 pm on the other side!\nHer family would have dinner at six o’clock on point every day without fail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf Mother Gu called her for dinner and she didn’t get any responses even though she kept knocking, she might panic and slam open the door. Only to find out that Gu Ning, who was supposed to be in her bedroom revising had disappeared into thin air. Again. Gu Ning doesn’t dare to imagine that.\nRunning to the women’s toilets on this floor, it turned out that the toilets were all without doors and just partitioned concrete.\nShe could only run straight out of the dormitory building, and by this time, it was already getting very late. Gu Ning thought of the small woods in the backfield and without thinking too much, hurriedly ran in that direction.\nKnowing that she was now “infamous” in the colony, Gu Ning pulled her hoody up to cover her trademark blonde hair to avoid attention, and instead of her usual long knife, she only carried two short knives at her waist.\nSince Brother San already made himself clear that he’ll protect Gu Ning, Wang JiZhong would never dare to touch her, at least, on the surface anyway.\nGu Ning headed up the slope.\nOnly to come face to face with a person walking down the slope from the backfield.\nThe person brushed past her, glanced at the few strands of blonde hair peeking out of the side of the hoody, then suddenly stopped in their tracks and asked in a voice vaguely tinged with contempt: “Are you that Gu Ning?”\nGu Ning’s footsteps gave a slight pause and calmly turned her head to look. Then a trace of surprise emerged in her eyes, she did not expect to meet this person here, she couldn’t help but blurt out: “Yin Sang?”\nThe owner of that contemptuous voice was none other than Yin Sang, who had given Gu Ning a great shock and inspiration after seeing her on the television. It was so memorable that Gu Ning was able to remember her name at this moment.\nDressed in a white practice outfit, her long black hair still tied up in a high ponytail, she looked more flamboyant in person than on television.\nGu Ning looked at her and couldn’t help but think of another person, Zhuang Chen, who was also this gorgeous looking. If they were compared side by side, Zhuang Chen’s appearance was more exceptional than Yin Sang, but it could just be Gu Ning subconsciously favoring Yin Sang more than Zhuang Chen.\nHearing Gu Ning called out her name, Yin Sang raised her eyebrows slightly in surprise: “You recognize me?”\n“I’ve seen the video of your participation in the National Martial Arts Competition.” Gu Ning said from the bottom of her heart: “You are very impressive.”\nYin Sang snorted, although she was a little upset with Gu Ning for some reason, it was always bad to make things difficult when people give their heartfelt praises.\nGu Ning suddenly asked sincerely: “Can I ask you a question?”\nYin Sang raised her eyebrows and replied: “What?”\nGu Ning eagerly asked: “Where did you learn all those fighting skills?”\n“……” The look on Gu Ning’s face was so sincere that Yin Sang couldn’t even put on a sneering expression, so she could only say this with a straight face: “I have been training martial arts since I was a child, and have defeated those who have taught me them since the past ten years. If you think that by killing a few people you can be as good as I am, then you are too far out of your mind.”\nAfter saying those, she gave Gu Ning a cold stare and went straight down the slope in the direction of the teacher’s building.\nGu Ning looked at Yin Sang’s back and was puzzled by those words.\nHowever, since she hadn’t received any useful information, it seemed that the only solution was to find a way to get into the army. Thinking of this, Gu Ning continued up towards the backfield.\nIn the past, during this time of the day the backfield was a popular place for students, but now it was deserted. The large open space was empty and only Gu Ning stood there alone.\nGu Ning stood in the backfield, looking up at the west side of the sky.\nUnsure if it was because of the apocalypse, but the sun seems to be setting down earlier as the days go by. It’s only four o’clock right now and at this hour the sun was already showing signs of setting in the west.\nIn her heart, Gu Ning had a vague sense of trepidation.\nThe feeling that maybe one day, the sun will not rise again after setting down.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: A cool down chapter… hehehe oh well XD. Thank you so much for reading and commenting!\nSpoiler Alert: Next chapter will be more about the new changes in Gu Ning… So stay tuned! )\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",

In theory, a large expanse of water should be called a lake, but the body of water in front of Gu Ning’s eyes was boundless. While she was standing on this side, she couldn’t see the end of the green water. This was a sea, a green sea.\n\n\n\nAs if because of her arrival, the green ocean raged and created waves that made a roaring sound as if it were laughing.\nIn the distance, there was a large area of lush forest. Further down were mountains, overlapping verdant hills, the highest of which plunged into the clouds and were hidden from view. Moreover, from the clouds, there was a waterfall rushing straight down, it almost looked like the Milky Way falling from the sky, and even from such a great distance, Gu Ning could still hear the faint sound from the waterfall.\nBeneath her feet was the soil, the soft green grass, and she stood at the edge of the green sea, where the breeze, lifted by the waves were greeting her with an incomparably fresh and pleasant scent.\nThis was probably the most beautiful sight Gu Ning had ever seen, but she didn’t have time to appreciate it at all, she only felt a coldness burrowing into herself from the ground beneath her feet and then rising all the way up into the top of her head.\nIf that space was gone, how would she ever get back to the real world?\nShe felt chills all over her body.\nThe location that would have been reached through that door suddenly went from all that white space to this unknown place.\nThe sea, the mountains in the distance, and the clouds floating overhead were all unusual and looked fantastical. She couldn’t possibly have been transported to another world by that door, could she?!\nGu Ning pursed her lips tightly, forced herself to calm down, and pulled away from that deep sense of fear emerging from her heart.\nShe began to analyse her current situation. If she had come through that door, then this place too would surely have that door in it. A black door, conspicuous enough for Gu Ning to begin and search for it.  After searching for a whole hour or so, Gu Ning couldn’t find the black door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning’s hands and feet were cold, and she even wanted to cry.\nHer lips were tightly pursed, and the look on her face, despite her best efforts to remain calm, still revealed her anxiety…… Suddenly, a thought popped up in her mind.\nIf she was in another world now, then maybe with just a thought, she could return to that dimension?\nGu Ning took a deep breath, then slowly closed her eyes as the sight of that space and that black door appeared in her mind, then she opened her eyes and froze.\nA door was now standing on the place that was vacant a moment ago.\nYet this door was not the black door.\nRather, it was a door with lush green colour.\nThat familiar Tai Chi compass was still embedded on it, the golden pointer still resting in the middle like in the beginning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning stared at the door, which seemed to have changed its colour, in awe and uncertainty, a little unsure if this door was the one she had passed through earlier. And if it’s not, what kind of world would be behind this door?\nRegardless of what, it’s important to check first ……\n“Gulp——“ Gu Ning swallowed hard as she reached out her hand, flicked the golden pointer to the side, and then pressed her hand on the door handle.\nA golden light flashed past.\nGu Ning slowly opened her eyes and glanced at the familiar surroundings, her tense nerves relaxed all at once, then her whole body went limp on the bed and she exhaled a heavy breath.\nHowever, at the same time, she appeared in the other world, the golden pointer in that space spun around once and then stopped at the same position Gu Ning had toggled as if it had never moved.\nGu Ning patted her chest while her heart was pounding violently and glanced at the wall clock, it was already past eight in the evening. She gently gripped the bedroom door handle and when she twisted it, the anti-locking clasp popped out at once. When she heard that sound, Gu Ning was relieved, this proved that neither Father Gu nor Mother Gu had noticed her disappearance or went into her room.\nShe opened the door and strolled out.\nThat sound also startled Mother Gu who was watching TV.\n“Where’s dad?” Gu Ning asked, at this time of the day, Father Gu should be stationed in front of the TV, watching the news broadcast without fail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Your dad called to cancel his leave from school. He’s going back to school tomorrow. He’s in his study room preparing for the classes tomorrow.” Mother Gu said and got up, headed to the kitchen, and brought out all the food that had been warmed up. “You were so focused on your revision that even I called you once and you didn’t reply.” Mother Gu continued.\nGu Ning was secretly glad that Mother Gu had only called her once and then gave up.\nAfter that, she was so engrossed with the thoughts about the changes in that space that she muddled through the whole meal.\nAfter finishing her meal, she went back to her bedroom and locked the door behind her.\nGu Ning was a little nervous, and after taking in a deep breath, her mind thought about the space and she returned to it.\nHowever, the place she arrived at was still the same as before, with the sea and the mountains, she didn’t manage to return to the space consisting of only white walls.\nGu Ning already had a vague idea in her mind at this point that the changes in the space might be related to the green bead which made her faint after swallowing it.\nMoreover, she simply couldn’t decide whether the changes were good or bad so she just simply ignored it, just like she had done with the previous event where sudden changes happened in her own body.\nShifting the golden pointer to the other side, Gu Ning opened the door. The air carried the unique stench of decay only found in a post-apocalyptic world, and Gu Ning finally put her mind at ease as she looked at the dark grove she was in.\nJust as she was about to walk out, there was a sudden sound of rustling on the other side, and faint sounds of talking, followed by two light footsteps threading through the grass heading in her direction.\nThe darkness in the woods did not hinder Gu Ning’s vision, so she could see a ragged fourteen or fifteen-year-old boy pulling a little girl around seven or eight years old towards this direction. The boy was walking while hiding the biscuits in his shirt which looked like he had just dug out of the soil. It was obvious that he didn’t see the other person standing here but the little girl saw Gu Ning and the smile on her face froze for a moment.\nGu Ning felt that the little girl saw her, and not just the vague sense of knowing that someone was there, but clearly saw her with those eyes.\nThe little girl’s footsteps halted and her big, keen eyes looked at her warily as she pulled back the unaware teenager and whispered: “*GeGe, there’s someone.”\n(T/N: GeGe means elder brother.)\nWhen the teenager heard the voice, he froze for just a moment, and in the next second, drew the small knife pinned to his waist while pulling the little girl behind him, vigilantly aiming the knife at the blurred figure of Gu Ning in the dark.\nEven Gu Ning couldn’t help but marvel at the teenager’s display of reflexes at this moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe silent confrontation between the two sides ended when Gu Ning turned away.\nThe teenager wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and asked: “Is he gone?”\nThe little girl looked at Gu Ning’s back as she walked out of the grove and replied softly: “She’s gone.”\nThe teenager heartily touched the small bag of biscuits he had hidden in his inner pocket before saying: “Let’s get going too.”\nThe little girl took the hand offered by the teenager with no problem even in the darkness and replied: “Mmm.”\nIt was just after five o’clock, and the sun had sunk completely into the west, the moon was already hanging quietly on the sky, giving off a hazy glow.\nTwo thin figures, one tall and one short strolled in the darkness.\nThe world reflected in the little girl’s dark eyes was the same as in the daytime.\nIf you looked closely enough, on the outer rim of her obsidian black eyes, an extremely inconspicuous ring of white which was more transparent and brighter than the white of her eyes could be seen.\nWhen everyone noticed that Gu Ning went to the toilet for over an hour, they got anxious and went outside to look for her a few times.\nGu Ning could only explain that she had met an acquaintance.\nBoth Father Gu and Mother Gu woke up, although they were both physically injured, the family was finally reunited and they all felt great relief within their hearts.\nAt the same time, Gu Ning solemnly thanked Li HongJuan.\n“Don’t thank me either.” Li HongJuan, in turn, was a little embarrassed and said: “I’m not afraid of anything in my life, but I’m most afraid of owing someone a favour. You’ve saved my life not only once or twice, and if it wasn’t for you I would have died more than three months ago, so a day of being alive is a day earned.”\nLi HongJuan’s face was in stark contrast to the faces of the “elders” on the bus who usually greeted her with a smile. Before the apocalypse started, she had subconsciously never liked Li HongJuan, but much to her surprise after the apocalypse, among those she had saved, only Li HongJuan, who had always been disliked by everyone, had a pure basic sense of gratitude.\nAfter distributing food to everyone, Zhang Yang was quite surprised to also receive two pieces of bread, and he didn’t dare to finish all of it, he meticulously tore only half of the bread, and the remaining piece and a half were prudently tucked back into his pocket. Then he chewed on the half piece of bread and asked: “Gu Ning, where did you get all these supplies? We’ve gone through almost all of the supermarkets around here, and the supplies are getting harder and harder to find these days so where did you manage to find so many of them? And those medicines, our search, and rescue teams have been having a hard time finding them these past few days.”\nHe casually asked but everyone in the dormitory was also looking curiously at Gu Ning now.\nGu Ning got startled abruptly, she had not been aware of this problem. Due to the greed for convenience, she thought that it would be just fine to take out the supplies from her backpack. But she hadn’t thought about the severe scarcity of the supplies. After all, a supermarket with a small zombie population would have long been looted by hungry people.\nShe swallowed her saliva for a moment, before replying, acting as if it was just a trivial matter: “I got lucky and found a grocery shop along with a private clinic. Probably due to its remote location, there were some things left behind.”\nThis was a reasonable argument. So the crowd only lamented about Gu Ning’s luck and didn’t think anything more of it.\nJia DaoZhang suddenly spoke which immediately shifted the subject: “Gu Ning, have you noticed that the sun is setting earlier and earlier nowadays? It’s also unheard of for the moon to come out at just over five o’clock in this time of the year.”\nThe crowd nodded repeatedly, indicating that they all had the same concern.\n“It would be fine if it remained just like that, but at this pace, I’m afraid that……” Jia DaoZhang said with a slight pause, sweeping a glance at the people in the dormitory before continuing in a deep voice: “There will come a day when the sun will set and never rise again……”\nAt these words, the whole dormitory fell into complete silence. A feeling of indescribable fear rose in everyone’s heart.\nIs the sun never rising again?\nThe whole world falling in total darkness?\nThat’s probably the worst disaster even if it got compared to the zombie outbreak.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Thank you for reading.)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "31": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-31/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs the night fell, all the hustle and bustle fell silent, as if fearing to disturb the zombies who wouldn’t stop pursuing their prey even as night fell.\nIt was still nine o’clock in the evening, but in the post-apocalyptic world, there was no electricity, no lights, no mobile phones, no computers, no entertainment machines, and only in sleep could people get a little respite after a day full of fear.\n\n\n\nGu Ning lay on the iron-framed bed, looking at the bed board above her, she didn’t have the slightest desire to sleep at all. Ever since she had been bitten by a zombie, the feeling of wanting to sleep rarely appeared. Her ears could easily pick up the sounds of someone from the next dormitory tossing in their iron-framed bed along with the deep snoring sounds coming from other people.\nWhen the apocalypse happened, if she needs to sleep, she usually will just curl up in the car seat and take a nap, and even while sleeping, she doesn’t dare to relax completely and she would be awakened by the slightest movement of the wind. It was the first time she slept in a bed since the apocalypse started in this world.\nBeside her bed, was a rifle. More than three months ago Gu Ning was still a little girl who had just graduated from school and was job hunting everywhere under the scorching sun. Never could she have imagined that three months later she would be lying here, sleeping with a gun beside her.\nHer parents were sleeping in the dormitory next door, and her father’s injury, which she had been worried about had done the operation and the black door which contained her hopes with the ability to transfer between two worlds. However, she still didn’t let her guard down.\nSurviving in such a dangerous world, even alone, was never an easy task, let alone with elderly and frail parents.\nThat’s the reason why she exists in this world.\nThe sun now also sets early in the west.\nThe unknown changes took place in that space.\nThere was also the little girl she met today in the backfield…… That keen pair of eyes kept popping up in her mind, the feeling was very subtle, the feeling of when two pairs of eyes meet each other in complete darkness, the knowing look they show once they see each other……\nNot only that but there was also Fang Fa and Zhuang Chen waiting for her in Times City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFang Fa was the only person she trusts in the post-apocalyptic world, apart from her parents. She and Zhuang Chen met at first sight, and it was a rare occasion that even though they had only spent less than a day together Zhuang Chen already left a good impression on Gu Ning.\nHowever, it was obvious that her parents were not in the right condition to be on the road, and after this farewell, she doesn’t know if she’ll ever meet them again, but she hopes that Fang Fa will be as lucky as her to find his parents without any problems.\nIn all seriousness, all the people in this dormitory.\nJia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming, Huang MengYao, and Xie YuHong.\nExcept for Cheng Ming who she already had a vague impression of. As for the other three people, they had only been on two memorable occasions, the time the zombie dog blocked in that courtyard, and when the camps were divided, they indicated that they were on Gu Ning’s side. Frankly, she was not prepared at all to stay with them on a long-term basis. Apart from Cheng Ming who had performed well, and Huang MengYao who could help her take care of her parents’ injuries, the other two did not seem to fit her grouping requirements quite well.\nAlso for those people whom she had only seen in precarious situations twice, it was difficult for Gu Ning to feel comfortable handing her back to them.\nShe trusted Brother San a little more instead.\nThen there was the most headache-inducing problem of all, money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShe thought about the dozens of gold necklaces she still had hidden in her backpack, but the main problem was how to exchange them for money without getting suspected.\nShe had the idea of going to the bank and taking the money directly.\nHowever, the money would be numbered, so if she spent lots of it all at once, it would get her into trouble instead.\nThis world was full of gold and *RMB but Gu Ning felt she won’t be able to get her hands on anything.\n(T/N: RMB is China currency.)\nSorrowful, how sorrowful.\nAlong with Gu Ning, nobody in the dormitory was asleep either.\nEveryone was a little worried by Jia DaoZhang’s words that the sun would never rise again after it sets. However, the one who started the disturbance was snoring lightly. Apparently, he had already fallen asleep completely unburdened.\nCheng Ming was lying on his side facing Gu Ning’s bed, looking at the blurred figure of Gu Ning lying on the bed in the dark, his mood was a little subtle. He still remembered the first time when he saw Gu Ning who came to pick up the new students at the railway station, she had a light sincere smile on her face, not very pretty but the whole person looked very fresh and clean. He had been following her ever since and had created many “unexpected encounters”, mostly consisting of Gu Ning walking hurriedly with a book in her arms, or else with several people walking together, and Gu Ning was not in any club so he had no chance to approach and talk to her.\nThus, until Gu Ning graduated, he did not succeed in leaving a clear impression in front of Gu Ning. Her image of him maybe just a mentee who ate once or twice at some party and chatted a couple of words or something……\nHe never expected to live in the same room with Gu Ning…… This was probably the only thing that he felt grateful for in the post-apocalyptic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHe had also thought that if he met Gu Ning during the apocalypse, he would protect her from any harm, but now it seems Gu Ning was the one who took on the protector role along the way.\nIt was also because the Gu Ning now was showing a completely different image from the Gu Ning he had originally conceived.\nCheng Ming was inexplicably a little melancholic in his subtle happiness.\nSuddenly, some loud noises were heard from the corridor near the entrance of the staircase. It seemed that a group of people was climbing up the stairs. It was very quiet at this time of the night, and this group of people did not even restrain their volume, so everyone could hear a group of relatively young men and women stomping their way up to the third floor while complaining. They were very rowdy as they walked through the corridor.\nThe nerves of the people after the post-apocalypse became so tense that even the slightest movements could easily wake people up, plus the newcomers weren’t even holding themselves back at all, the sound of them chatting was still considered noisy even in the daytime.\nA very unpleasant curse came out from one of the dormitory rooms.\nSomeone within the group cursed before being stopped by a low voice.\nThe group was much quieter all of a sudden.\nIt should have all been newcomers who had just entered the colony at night, it wasn’t clear if these people surrendered enough supplies or if they took the back door in.\nNot long after the group passed by then, the sound of footsteps was heard returning. Immediately afterward, there was a knock on the door of Gu Ning’s dormitory.\nThe people in the dormitory hadn’t been asleep.\nWhen the door knocked, they all sat up from their beds.\nYet, Jia DaoZhang rolled over and didn’t respond at all.\nInstantly afterward, a beam of white shone in through the window and someone shouted from outside: “Hey open the door!”\n“Gu Ning? Do we open it?” Cheng Ming asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning replied: “Open it and see what’s up”\nCheng Ming then got out of bed and went to open the door.\nAs soon as the door opened, they saw the dormitory manager who was in charge of this building and was standing outside with the four or five people: “The other dormitory rooms were full. These guys have been allocated to your side.”\nCheng Ming glanced back at Gu Ning, who gave a slight nod.\nCheng Ming then gave way to letting them in.\n“Well, you guys are staying here, I’m going off. Be quiet and don’t disturb others.” The dormitory manager who had led them walked away with the torchlight.\nGu Ning looked at this young group of three men and two women, all of whom carried the putrid smell of zombies to a certain extent, but their clothes were unexpectedly very clean and tidy.\n“No way, there’s only the upper bunk left!” A girl said discontentedly after looking over the beds inside the dormitory using the little bit of moonlight that shone in from the outside.\n“Excuse us, for disturbing your rest.” A man who looked to be twenty-four or twenty-five years old said with a hint of apology in his tone among several people and then to the girl: “Alright, stop talking and get to bed. Don’t disturb other people’s rest.”\nIt made a few others who had been subjected to so much noise in the middle of the night feel a little better.\nThe girl listened to the man’s words, skimmed her lips, and kept quiet. She didn’t even bother taking off her shoes and stepped on Huang MengYao’s sleeping end of the bed. Huang MengYao wanted to get angry, but after thinking about the current situation, she held back herself but her expression darkened.\n“Hey! There’s so much food up here!” Suddenly there was a surprising sound of cheer from the girl above along with the rustling of plastic bags.\n“Excuse me, that’s our supplies, please hand it over.” Cheng Ming said as soon as he rushed over in a single step.\nThe girl was frozen and didn’t move.\nThere was a moment of silence in the dormitory before the male voice that had spoken earlier once again called out with a hint of warning: “Yan Yu.”\nThe girl once again scowled and pursed her lips and threw the two bags of supplies straight down, dropping them on the floor with a loud thud.\nA silence fell over the dormitory once again.\n“What’s wrong? What’s going on? What’s happening?!” Jia DaoZhang, who had been sleeping, was awakened by the sound and immediately sat up straight from the bed. When he saw the new people in the room using the moonlight that shone in, he was a bit stunned: “Where did these people come from?”\n“Who knows?” Xie YuHong, who had been quiet, said emotionlessly before lying down and turning over to go back to sleep.\nThe rest of the group were also slightly embarrassed by the girl’s actions and all climbed up to the top bunk without a word.\nThe last man, the one who had been restraining the girl called Yan Yu, also slept on Gu Ning’s top bunk and asked courteously as he climbed onto the bed: “Sorry, I’ll be borrowing your bed to step on.” The moment he looked down at Gu Ning, Gu Ning instantly felt the same feeling she had with the little girl she met back in the backfield. The feeling of two gazes meeting each other for a moment.  At the same time, the man who was staring at her seemed to have sensed something and looked at Gu Ning with some slight changes in his gaze.\nGu Ning, feeling the man’s tentative gaze, acted naturally and intuitively lowered her eyes, avoiding looking directly at his eyes.\nPei Jing unconsciously let out a sigh of relief after Gu Ning turned her gaze away, then silently shook his head and thought to himself that he was being too sensitive and might have created a misunderstanding. It was extremely rare for people like him in this world to have such an encounter, so how could he meet others with such chances?\nGu Ning faced the wall, her eyes glowing in the darkness……\nShe had just seen the same translucent ring of gold around the man’s black pupils, exactly just like hers……\nWhat the hell is going on here?!\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sorry again for the late update.

    "32": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-32/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt was cloudy the next day, with overcast clouds stretching across the sky, behind which heavy rain seemed to be brewing before it fell.\nAfter inquiring from Zhang Yang about Brother San’s residence, Gu Ning left the dormitory with a gun on her back.\n\n\n\nWhen Brother San escaped from the army, he brought with him more than thirty soldiers, but now, only twenty-three of them were left including himself.\nThey occupied the ground floor of the teachers’ building.\nEven at this hour, there were two soldiers with guns standing guard at the entrance of the building.\nBefore Gu Ning could introduce herself, a young soldier in his twenties with particularly fair skin standing guard had his eyes lit up and stared at Gu Ning and asked: “Are you Gu Ning? Here to visit our Third Company?”\n“Zhang XiaoBai, how many times do I have to tell you to refer to him as Brother San! Brother San!” Another soldier who looked to be slightly older said with a helpless look on his face, before turning to Gu Ning again with shining eyes and asked: “You’re Gu Ning?” Looking at Gu Ning’s outfit, a tracksuit, topped with blonde hair, a very fair face, and carrying a gun on her back. These were a few points that Brother San had reminded him about, so it should be correct.\n“You’ve come at the right time, if you were a little later, we would have left!” The soldier named Zhang XiaoBai replied.\n“Leaving?” Gu Ning asked.\nZhang XiaoBai replied: “Yup. We have a small group that goes out daily to search for other survivors out there.” He stopped halfway, and looked at Gu Ning gratefully before continuing: “We all heard from Zhang Yang that if it wasn’t for you yesterday, not only Zhao Jie and the others, but even Brother San and the rest might not be able to return.”\nThe slightly older soldier also cast a grateful glance at Gu Ning.\nGu Ning was kind of speechless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAlthough they had left the army, they continued to search for survivors and brought them back safely into the colony. On their side, there was no benefit to be gained from this matter, but they were still holding onto their vocation as a soldier before the apocalypse happened, which is to protect the people.\nGu Ning stared at the soldier standing in front of her, who looked younger and talked about going out into the danger, searching for more survivors without any complaints, feeling that it was just a matter of course.\nSuddenly, Gu Ning felt dignified respect for them.\n“Let me bring you in.” Zhang XiaoBai said enthusiastically, before leading Gu Ning into the corridor: “Zhang Yang said that you just learned how to shoot, but your shooting accuracy is even better than Luo Long’s! When Zhang Yang said so, I wasn’t convinced by it as he likes to exaggerate things when he speaks, but then I believed it when Luo Long also said the same thing. How did you manage to do that?”\nWhat surprised Gu Ning a little was that the soldiers only lived in two rooms on this floor, the other rooms were occupied by children. The floor was covered with messy quilts or clothes, and the children slept on these. Each room contained almost twenty to thirty children, most of them were still sleeping at this hour but some of them woke up early and were unusually well behaved. None of them cried and they were just looking at Gu Ning curiously, a stranger, with their pairs of dark and bright eyes. “They are all orphans who lost their parents.” Zhang XiaoBai took the initiative to introduce them: “Brother San said that children are the future of the world, and saving one means giving the world one more chance of hope in the future. I think Brother San is quite right. Anyway, we have extra rooms here, so we gather all the children here, they’re all very well behaved and never gave us any trouble. Also, kids don’t eat much too.” At this moment, he paused a bit and his brow furrowed slightly as he continued: “It’s just that the weather is getting colder and when winter finally arrives, these children have no clothes to wear, and I don’t know if they’ll make it through the winter.”\nGu Ning glanced at those pairs of curious yet dark eyes and listened to Zhang XiaoBai’s slightly heavy words, she felt speechless.\nAfter getting used to people’s indifference ensuing the apocalypse, the numb and cold faces they have even when dealing with women and children, it was the first time Gu Ning met people who still held passion for the world. This kind of enthusiasm made Gu Ning feel an inexplicable shame of herself.\nHowever, at the same time, she also felt very confused. Naturally, she hadn’t forgotten what happened yesterday morning, of the man who got shot in the head because he caused a delay in line. Although she didn’t know if the shooter was one of Brother San’s underlings or not, to be able to shoot so decisively at that time should be cold-hearted in Gu Ning’s level of understanding, and definitely not someone who takes care of orphans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning was unable to grasp Brother San’s character.\nGu Ning was being led by Zhang XiaoBai to meet Brother San who was currently checking the guns and ammo.\nHe was slightly surprised at Gu Ning’s arrival, but he didn’t stop and continued his work while asking her: “Gu Ning? Is there any problem?”\nGu Ning first scanned the area, it was no different from the room where the children were, but the clothes and quilts spread on the floor were thinner than the children’s room.\nThe ten or so soldiers were crammed into a room, and everything that could be moved in the room was shifted away to the aisle to make more walking space. Most of the soldiers were young men in their twenties and had heard of Gu Ning’s “heroic deeds”, so they were all glancing at her curiously.\nGu Ning gave them a slight nod as a form of greeting before answering Brother San’s question: “Well, there are a few very important questions that I would like to ask Uncle San.”\nGu Ning’s expression was so serious which also made Brother San solemn. Thus, he put down his gun, stood up, and replied to Gu Ning: “Let’s chat outside then.”\nThe two of them walked to the other end of the corridor and stood at the small balcony. Brother San pulled out a small metal box from his inner pocket, in which there were about ten cigarettes left. He took out a half-smoked cigarette, lit it with a lighter, took a long puff, and then put the cigar out before returning it in the small metal box. He let the smoke stay in his mouth for some time before letting it out of his nose. He squinted his eyes, an expression of enjoyment spread on his face before he cursed: “D*mn, cigarettes are harder to get than drugs these days.” After cursing, he then asked: “What is it? Speak then.”\nGu Ning had thought of the wording on the way here and asked: “I have a question.  If, at this moment, the apocalypse didn’t happen, and Brother San, you’re still in the army. And I wanted to join the army purely to learn combat skills, what should I do?” Gu Ning emphasized the word if.\nBrother San paused for a moment at Gu Ning’s very bizarre question then replied: “Is this the very important question you’re talking about? What kind of question is this? Are you messing with me?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNo one could blame Brother San for such a reaction, as Gu Ning’s question was just too strange and uninteresting no matter how you look at it.\nGu Ning couldn’t explain anything to Brother San, so she could only emphasize: “Brother San, I’m not joking, this issue is very important to me.”\nSeeing that Gu Ning’s expression was serious, Brother San believed that Gu Ning was gravely asking him this boresome and strange question, so he replied: “Difficult.” After saying this, there was a slight pause before he continued: “Seriously though if I was still in the army and knew you had such potential, I would’ve helped in introducing you to the Five Stars Brigade. Tsk, it’s such a shame that if it wasn’t for the apocalypse, in another week or two’s time would have been when the Five Stars Brigade came to the army and picked people.” He said with a raised eyebrow: “Then I’ll show those sons of b*tches who blew up my company last year what it really means to be a sharpshooter. Hehe!” He stopped laughing and glanced at Gu Ning and said: “Tsk, it’s a d*mn shame! Couldn’t watch the Five Stars Brigade get whacked.”\nGu Ning was silent for a moment before asking: “What is the Five Stars Brigade?”\nOriginally these were kept secret, but now it’s the post-apocalyptic world, Brother San was interested in declassifying them to Gu Ning: “The Five Stars Brigade is the code name for a special forces unit in our country. Every year this group will recruit the top talents into it from every army in the country. Their recruitment is not limited to troops. Men, women, the young, and the old, but they have one condition for recruitment, and that is to defeat them. Marksmanship, close-quarters combat, you only need one thing that catches the eye of those guys and you can be one of the Five Stars Brigade agents. As much as I don’t like their overbearing and smug attitude, I can’t help but acknowledge that the ones that can get in, are the cream of the crop. We are just scum compared to them. I believe that even in this day and age, they are the ones who will survive to the end.”\nFrom Brother San’s words, one could hear his mixed emotions of love and hate for that Five Stars Brigade.\nBrother San gave Gu Ning one last glance before saying: “If it were in the olden days of peace. With you having this kind of talent, and with my systematic training, you might have the chance to be chosen and get into the Five Stars Brigade.” He sighed again: “What a shame.”\nHowever, Gu Ning’s heart was racing with longingness because of those words, and what moved her the most was undoubtedly his words that even today, they would be the ones who will survive to the end.\nThis was Gu Ning’s ultimate goal in this world.\nAfter Gu Ning obtained the information she wanted from Brother San, she bid him goodbye and then walked out of the teacher’s building.\nRight after she walked out, Gu Ning was stopped by someone.\nGu Ning looked at the person who had stopped in front of her in surprise.\nThe little girl who she had met once in the backfield, was spreading her arms open and stopped in front of Gu Ning. Not sure if it was because of the lack of oxygen caused by running too much, but her face was pale, which made her dark eyes look like deep pools. She tilted her head up to look at Gu Ning, and although her ink-like eyes managed to remain calm, her voice couldn’t contain her trembling sobs as she spoke: “Please help my brother! He’s about to be beaten to death!”\nPerhaps it was because of the unusually well-behaved and quiet children who Gu Ning just saw in the teachers’ building or because of this little girl’s “specialness”, that she hesitated for a moment before following this little girl towards the backfield.\nThe brother who’s the little girl was talking about being beaten to death soon was falling helplessly on the ground, his thin body curled up in pain, but no one was beating him at this moment because the group was ganging up on ……a black man?!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning stared at the tall black man in out-of-shape shorts and bodysuit while groaning nonstop. Gu Ning was lost in a trance for a moment.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ahh… Five Stars Brigade, special forces. =) Good luck to Gu Ning.)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "33": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-33/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe black man was screaming and waving his arms randomly to hit the attackers. However, four or five people were surrounding him, he was still being punched and kicked every now and then, and yet he took the time to scream at Gu Ning: “Run! Run!” It was spoken in very accurate Mandarin.\nMeantime, he was also shouting at those men who had surrounded him: “You barbarians! It’s against the law to beat people! If you have the guts, go out and kill the zombies!”\n\n\n\nGu Ning had no intention of running away, she just silently took her gun off, then unlocked the safety and pointed it at those men.\nThe sound of safety being opened was extremely clear, which made the few attackers, including the one being hit, all stop and look over.\nThe black man reflexively raised his hands above his head and stared at Gu Ning in terror: “Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! I surrender! I surrender!” He no longer has that energetic aura when he was cursing those attackers.\nThose attackers recognized Gu Ning at once, at this moment they were being pointed at by Gu Ning’s gun, and then they recalled her ruthlessness in killing people, they all got so scared that their legs went weak. Someone in the group managed to gather the courage and shouted: “It was all because of the kid who stole our biscuits, we were too angry and ended up beating him!”\nGu Ning was not a murderous maniac either, so she put down her gun and gave a slight nod to the men, indicating that they could leave now.\nIt took those few men to pull themselves together and woefully dashed down the slope and past Gu Ning.\nOnly then did the black man realized that Gu Ning and he were “on the same side” and immediately smiled with his white teeth showing while greeting Gu Ning warmly:  “Hey! So you’re here to help them too! I thought you were with those guys! Oh! By the way, I haven’t introduced myself. Hello miss, my name is Jack Sparrow, that’s right, I have the same name as Captain Jack. But you can just call me Jack, I was born a bit earlier than he was, errr, I’m talking about the birth of the movie character——“\nGu Ning stared at the black man who spoke fluently in Mandarin and was a little too friendly and since she doesn’t want to attend to him, Gu Ning just nodded coldly at him and walked over towards the teenager and the little girl.\nJack scratched his head, thinking that ‘this girl won’t be racist, would she?’ However, he followed Gu Ning over to check if there was anything he could help with.\n“Can you stand up?” Gu Ning said to the teenager with bruises all over his face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Yes……” The teenager stood up from the ground with some difficulty and with the help of the little girl, he pursed his lips before saying to Gu Ning: “Thank you.”\nThe little girl cast a grateful look at Gu Ning.\nThe little girl looked around seven or eight years old, her hair was like a doll’s head with bangs, the original neat bangs were now trimmed like it had been chewed by a dog, her face was dirty but the pair of eyes were extraordinarily bright and black.\nGu Ning couldn’t help but say: “I know of a place that is safe where there are many orphans just like you……”\nBefore she could finish her sentences, she was interrupted by the teenager: “We are not orphans!” He pursed his lips and looked at her stubbornly, repeating: “We are not orphans. We don’t need anyone’s pity.”\nGu Ning met the teenager’s stubborn eyes and her voice turned cold: “Oh. Then you should have been beaten to death by now.”\nThe teenager just pursed his lips and became speechless.\n“All pride should be based on one’s strength.” Gu Ning looked at him with an icy gaze and continued: “You should be more realistic before you have enough capital to be proud of. Otherwise not only will you die, but you also make others die along with you too.” The others here, naturally refer to his sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe teenager’s face reddened and he subconsciously tried to rebut it, but when he opened his mouth, he didn’t know what to say as he simply couldn’t argue with the facts.\nJack Sparrow, who had been a non-existent spectator, looked at the scene unfolding in front of him. He understood every word Gu Ning had spoken, but it took him some time to rephrase and understand it fully.\n“You’re not leaving yet?” Gu Ning frowned and suddenly turned her head and asked him.\n“? ? ?” Jack Sparrow didn’t understand why she was chasing him away.\nGu Ning answered: “I have something to talk about with them alone.”\n“Oh! That’s all right, then I’ll go on ahead. If you need any help, you can come to me, maybe I’ll have food for you.” Jack Sparrow said to the teenager and the little girl.\nThen he said to Gu Ning: “Then, I’ll see you again next time, Miss. Goodbye.”\nAfter sending the black man away.\nGu Ning began to look at the little girl squarely.\nGu Ning did not beat around the bush and asked straight to the point: “I’ve saved your brother. So it’s time for you to tell me what’s going on with your eyes.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs soon as she asked this question, it was obvious that both the teenager and the little girl tensed up at the same time.\nThe teenager even shielded the little girl behind him and glared at Gu Ning with hostility and replied: “We don’t understand what you’re asking about.”\n“GeGe. It’s okay.” The little girl, on the contrary, tugged at the corner of the teenager’s coat, then looked at Gu Ning with those dark eyes and replied: “Sister, my name is Xiang Xu, and this is my brother Xiang Yi.”\n“What are you doing, telling her our names?” The teenager named Xiang Yi stared at Gu Ning warily and was very unhappy with Xiang Xu for telling his name to Gu Ning so easily.\nXiang Xu ignored his comment and just looked at Gu Ning and asked: “Can I take a look at your eyes?”\nGu Ning’s gaze flickered slightly before she squatted down.\nThe little girl came closer and stared into Gu Ning’s eyes for a moment, then visibly relieved and spoke: “Yours is green and mine is white. Look.” She peeled her eyes wider to show Gu Ning as if she was afraid that Gu Ning won’t be able to see them.\nGu Ning took a closer look and saw that there was a very faint circle of white on the rim of her black pupils.\nUp to now, including her, there had been three people who had undergone this kind of mutation. All of them were most likely still in this colony: “Did you also become like this after eating a bead?” The little girl asked curiously.\nGu Ning nodded.\nSeeing Gu Ning nod, the little girl’s eyes lit up slightly before her tone turned serious: “When I ate that bead, I fell asleep and when I woke up, I found that my eyes could see in the dark. Also, I could see a white lake inside my body. Are these things the same for you?”\nGu Ning’s gaze faintly flickered, thinking of the green ocean in her own space, and asked: “Anything else besides the lake? Are there some other things? For example…… a door?”\nXiang Xu shook her head in confusion: “No. There’s just a lake.”\nXiang Yi, who had not spoken all this while, caught the main point of the question which Gu Ning had asked and then asked her with a burning gaze: “You have that?”\nGu Ning stared at him for a moment before replying: “I’m the one asking the questions now, you don’t have the authority to ask them back.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nXiang Yi was dumbfounded by Gu Ning’s words, and his beautiful monolid eyes flew upwards in anger: “Who asked you to save me?!”\nGu Ning didn’t even glance at him and replied: “Your sister. I’m asking your sister. If you have any dissatisfaction, I don’t mind if you excuse yourself first.”\n“You!” The teenager was so angry that even his eyes seemed to be spitting out fire.\n“GeGe!” Xiang Xu tugged at the teenager’s coat again, with disapproval shown in her eyes. This young man, who looked like a cock getting ready for a fight in front of Gu Ning was shouted at by Xiang Xu. Although it was difficult for him to swallow his anger, he managed to hold it back in the end. He shifted his glance away and refused to look at Gu Ning, with a defiant expression written all over his face.\n“So other than being able to see in the dark, do you have other changes?” Gu Ning asked.\n“I can see across great distances.” Xiang Xu replied.\nWith these changes, Gu Ning didn’t feel surprised, after all her eyesight was also enhanced.\nXiang Xu continued: “I can see the school entrance right now.”\nGu Ning subconsciously turned her head to take a look and then she froze. This was less than four hundred meters away from the school entrance, with her eyesight, she could also clearly see it but the main problem was, there was a teacher’s building cutting across in the middle and blocking her path of vision. There was no way to see around the building and see the school entrance as far as her eyes could view.\n“My eyes can pierce through this building and see where I want to view.” Xiang Xu said and continued shyly: “But for now, I can only see till the school entrance at most, not any further.”\nGu Ning was a bit indifferent and stared at Xiang Xu then asked: “Who lives on the third floor, room 308 of the girls’ dormitory that is less than four hundred meters away from here?”\nGu Ning noticed that after she asked this, the white circle at the edge of Xiang Xu’s black eyes dilated slightly, and instantly, she heard Xiang Xu replying: “308, three people were living there, one with red hair, one with glasses and one with gauze wrapped around his head.” She looked up at Gu Ning and said with a smile: “Am I right, sister?”\nGu Ning felt her throat go slightly dry as she replied: “Correct.”\n“And what about you? Any physical changes?” Xiang Xu asked curiously.\nThe teenager who had looked away couldn’t help but strain his ears to listen as well.\n“Nothing.” Gu Ning shook her head, her situation seemed to be different from Xiang Xu’s, she couldn’t help but feel a little envious. This Xiang Xu was like a mobile radar, within a few hundred meters they could monitor if any zombies were approaching them, and they could escape in advance before the zombies reached them.\nShe, however, did not feel any physical changes in her body.\nShe couldn’t help but recall the man in the dormitory, his was golden, so what kind of special abilities does he have?\nThat group gathered with people from other dormitories early in the morning and left the colony to god knows where.\nThe teenager made an abrupt “snort” after hearing Gu Ning’s words, obviously thinking that Gu Ning deliberately concealed it.\nGu Ning didn’t want to explain any future and only stated: “If you have to act next time, please do it satisfactorily as well.”\nAfter saying that, she turned around and walked away.\nAfter Gu Ning had completely walked away, only then did Xiang Yi realize what she had said and ask Xiang Xu: “What did she mean? Did she see through it? It couldn’t be right? Am I such a bad actor?”\nXiang Xu sighed like a small adult and replied helplessly: “It was very bad.”\nXiang Yi pursed his lips again, then said to Xiang Xu: “Look, she doesn’t even have the slightest intention of asking us to follow her. Maybe she even looks down on your skills. I’ve been beaten up for nothing.”\nXiang Xu gave him a somewhat disgruntled look, then frowned as she said: “It’s you who are too rude, GeGe.”\nXiang Yi rebutted: “She is also the same, putting on such a dreadful face while hiding her skills. She asked all sorts of questions about us but kept quiet about her own. She says that she doesn’t have any special powers, do you believe her?”\n“I do believe.” Xiang Xu said with a serious expression: “I looked into her eyes…… she wasn’t lying.”\n“You have *X-ray vision, not a lie detector. This woman has a deep mind, it’s easy to lie to you.” Xiang Yi replied.\n(T/N: 透视眼tòu shì yǎn means X-ray vision. Not sure if X-ray vision or TouShiYan sound better.)\nXiang Xu sighed and glanced at Xiang Yi and said: “We didn’t tell her everything about ourselves either.”\n“Anyway, I still have the same opinion as before. I don’t agree with following her, I don’t want to look at her dead, icy face every day!” Xiang Yi said with a scowl.\nXiang Xu sighed like an adult, then she turned to look in the direction in which Gu Ning had left. The white lake in her body gently rippled, and there was a silent surge of mental power, chasing after Gu Ning.\nJust as the piece of mental power was about to envelop Gu Ning.\nAs if sensing something, she jerked her head back and stared at that portion of mid-air that was simply empty.\nIn Xiang Xu’s view, she had met with Gu Ning’s pale and slightly greenish eyes. The pair of eyes clearly indicated it had seen her. Xiang Xu’s pupils suddenly tightened and she panicked so much that she forcibly severed her connection with the mental power. It wasn’t clear whether it was because of the mental power being cut off or because she was too frightened, Xiang Xu’s small face turned as white as a sheet.\nSeeing that Xiang Xu’s face turned pale, Xiang Yi asked in a panic: “Are you alright?”\n“She saw me.” Xiang Xu said in a trance, then suddenly her expression changed and she looked at Xiang Yi and said: “GeGe, maybe she is more powerful than we thought.”\nXiang Yi looked at Xiang Xu’s solemn face and was left speechless.\nGu Ning felt that the feeling of being spied on had disappeared and guessed that it should be the little girl who made this move.\nAt the same time, the corners of her mouth lifted into a smile, feeling a little amused that these two half-grown children had set up such a trap to lure her there. She didn’t think too much at first, but that teenager, who had been beaten and almost to the point of unable to get up from the floor, was instantly energetic and no longer showed any discomfort from having those bruises.\nShe didn’t see the point of Xiang Xu’s ability. At first, when she heard about Xiang Xu’s power, she was a bit impressed but after she calmed down and thought about it, there were already three mutated people in one small colony, so there must be some people out there who had mutated as well. She could pick someone more powerful to be her companion. That little girl was just too young, only seven or eight years old, Gu Ning couldn’t think of anything else that the little girl could do other than act as a radar. Moreover, as for that brother of hers, he was even more of a nuisance.\nAlthough she shouldn’t be saying this, her parents were already two burdens, and she didn’t want to bring along two more baggage.\nNevertheless, the supernatural powers that Xiang Xu had shown, made Gu Ning a little excited, this might be a new evolution in this world.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sorry again for the late chapter update. (T-T) okay so… although Xiang Yi was slightly annoying but he is really protective of his sister and those skills naming… which sounded better? X-ray vision / TouShiYan?

    "34": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-34/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nChapter 34 – A Master hand’s first small display\nGu Ning thought for a while and decided to return to the dormitory to empty her backpack of supplies. To the puzzled looks of several of them, she could only explain that she had to go out and search for winter clothes, and politely refused the wish of some to go with her. She left with an empty backpack that only contained a few dozen gold necklaces.\n\n\n\n“I really can’t understand this Gu Ning, she’s so secretive all day long. Why does she have so many guts? She even dares to run around out there all by herself.” Jia DaoZhang sighed as he stood on the balcony watching Gu Ning’s back as she walked farther away.\n“She probably thinks that even if you guys followed her there, you might be holding her back.”  Huang MengYao walked past and dropped this sentence before entering Father and Mother Gu’s dormitory.\nJia DaoZhang stared at Huang MengYao’s back in exasperation and asked: “Hey! This little Huang ah, her words are too harsh. How are we holding Gu Ning back? What do the two of you think, do we really drag Gu Ning back?”\nCheng Ming: “……”\nXie YuHong: “……”\nWhen Gu Ning returned to the space, she didn’t immediately cross over to the other side.\nInstead, she first walked to the shores of that green ocean.\nThat little girl said that there was a white lake inside her body, so was this sea produced from that bead?\nShe knelt and removed the gauze from her hand. She noticed this morning that the wound on her hand had completely healed, even the threads had been wrapped by the newly grown flesh and were completely invisible. She reached out and cupped a handful of water, which was unusually cool, some slipping through her fingers and some wavering in her palm. It looked crystal clear like a piece of fine jade, the green seawater was a shade lighter than the green from the bead.\nShe stood up and glanced into the far distance in the other direction, where the verdant mountains reside and waterfalls falling from the sky. Gu Ning was eager to go over there to take a better look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe moment this thought floated in her mind, the space in front of Gu Ning distorted for a moment, and the next thing she knew, she had disappeared into thin air!\nAll of a sudden, Gu Ning could only hear the sound of wind gusting by her ears, and in a short moment, the wind stopped howling around her ears and the sound of water rang out. There were droplets of water sprinkling on her face, Gu Ning stood on a huge wet rock and stared at the huge pool in front of her. A look of disbelief and wonder came to her face, and her ears were filled with the roaring sound of a waterfall falling from an extreme height and smashing into the pool.\nFrom that event, Gu Ning discovered the fact that she could move around in this space at will.\nGu Ning took a deep breath and raised her eyes to look at the distant mountain tops. With a thought, the space distorted once again and the roaring sound of water dispersed in her ears. Gu Ning opened her eyes once again and she was standing on the branch of the tallest tree at the top of the mountain, almost 30 to 40 meters above the ground. She had a slight fear of heights and immediately hugged the trunk of the tree next to her in a panic to stabilize herself. It took her a long time to slowly calm down, the wind brushed through the treetops making the leaves rustle with the wind, and tousled her short blonde hair.  Gu Ning stood on the branch high above the ground, looking out into the distance in full view. The green ocean was like a huge jade stone nestled among the verdant mountains, the waves sparkled and shone with radiant beauty.\nIt was the most beautiful sight Gu Ning had ever seen in her life. The wind was whispering in her ears, urging her to ride with the wind, her mood which had been in a state of extreme tension, seemed to have loosened and brightened up.\nGu Ning’s figure weaved through the mountains, her silhouette sometimes disappearing in this mountain forest, and in the next moment, reappearing in another part of the mountain forest. Gu Ning felt the wind whistling past her ears in the mountains, she had never felt so carefree and relaxed. It felt so good that this world only belonged to her, her own world.\nHowever, after all the excitement, Gu Ning finally remembered that she had a very urgent task ahead of her.\nBack in the other world, the time was 8:30 am, Father Gu had already gone to school to teach his classes. After breakfast, Gu Ning first took out Fang Fa’s phone number and called him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the police station, Fang Fa was tapping his desk in boredom, glancing occasionally at the phone in his hand and vaguely seeming to be waiting for something.\nLao Li walked by with a glass of warm water, looked at him, and asked: “Whose call are you waiting for?”\nFang Fa immediately replied: “What do you mean, waiting for a call? I’m not waiting for any calls.”\nLao Li continued: “Got a girlfriend?”\n“What nonsense.”\nAlmost at the same time, these words came out from Fang Fa’s mouth, his mobile phone on the table buzzed and vibrated.\nWithout the slightest delay, Fang Fa grabbed the phone, not even glancing at the number, and quickly called out: “Gu Ning?”\nGu Ning heard Fang Fa call out her name before she even spoke on the other side of the phone and was faintly startled before replying: “How did you know if it was me?”\nGu Ning’s distinctive voice with a hint of coldness reached his ears through the phone, and Fang Fa stammered for a rare moment: “Uh…… because the number was unknown, so I guessed that it was you.”\n“Oh.” Gu Ning paused, before asking: “Are you busy now?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFang Fa glanced at Lao Li, who was staring at him with a smirk on his face, and coughed dryly before replying: “Ahem, it’s okay. What can I help you with?”\n“Yes. I have a little problem that I’d like to ask you about, and I also need to pay you back.”\nFang Fa glanced at Lao Li again, then asked: “Well…… what is the problem?”\n“It’s a bit inconvenient to explain on the phone.” Gu Ning replied: “Is it fine for me to go over to the police station and look for you now?”\nFang Fa glanced at Lao Li again, then said: “It’s fine, come over then.”\n“Okay, see you later then.” Gu Ning hung up the phone after saying that.\nFang Fa placed his phone down and asked Lao Li while clicking his tongue: “Lao Li, why are you being so nosy?”\n“Gu Ning, isn’t she the one whom we brought back from the street last time? What, Did you get attached yesterday when you home visited her?” Lao Li teased.\nFang Fa rebutted: “What nonsense. She is coming over to return my money.”\nGu Ning, who had hung up the phone, likewise spotted Mother Gu’s eyes that were shining brightly.\n“Talking to Xiao Fang on the phone, huh?” Mother Gu asked as she came closer.\nGu Ning calmly replied: “Well, I need to find him for help.”\n“By the way, I’m going to the job interview today, so I won’t be back for lunch. Don’t wait for me.”\n“You’re going out looking like that?” Mother Gu remarked as she stared at Gu Ning’s black tracksuit: “Go and wear that white dress from last year.”\n“No need. It’s not like we’re going out on a date.” Gu Ning replied as she went back to the bedroom, carried her large backpack, and prepared to head out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“What are you doing with that big backpack of yours?!” Mother Gu chased her after her as she was going out of the house.\nShe could only watch as Gu Ning walked down the stairs, and said with a sigh: “Why are you so unconcerned about your looks now?”\nIt wasn’t long before Gu Ning, wearing a black tracksuit and sneaker and carrying a large backpack, appeared at the entrance of the police station.\n“What are you doing? Getting ready for hiking?” Fang Fa expressed his surprise as he saw Gu Ning’s outfit.\nGu Ning nodded to the others in the police station before asking Fang Fa: “Can we talk outside?”.\n“Okay.” Fang Fa followed Gu Ning and headed outside.\n“I’ve come mainly to ask you for a favour.” Gu Ning said as she took out a black plastic bag from her backpack.\nFang Fa reached out to pick it up and instantly his hand sank down from the weight: “What is it?” He lifted the bag and opened it, then he saw dozens of gold necklaces rolled together into a gold ball-like object, and he looked at Gu Ning in alarm: “What is this?”\n“Gold.” Gu Ning replied: “I don’t have any cash in my hand right now. Also, I wanted to know if you have any channels for me to sell these for cash.” Without waiting for Fang Fa to question her, Gu Ning said very calmly: “I guarantee that it was legitimately obtained, definitely not stolen or robbed by me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have asked you, a policeman, to sell the stolen goods, right?”\nGu Ning made such a valid point that Fang Fa was naturally speechless.\nGu Ning continued: “And only when these are sold, then can I return the money I’ve owed.”\nNo matter what, Fang Fa felt as if he was being blackmailed.\n“So, I’m counting on you.” Gu Ning said sincerely.\nFang Fa asked: “So, you came all the way here to find me for this matter?”\nGu Ning thought for a moment, and replied: “Or, do you know anything about the Five Stars Brigade?”\nThen the expression on Fang Fa’s face had already made the answer.\n“How do you know about the Five Stars Brigade?” Fang Fa asked in surprise as he stared at Gu Ning.\n“I have an, er, uncle in the army. He told me about it.” Gu Ning replied.\n“…… That’s first-class classified information.”\n“…… Forget that I said it.”\n“But what do you mean by suddenly asking me that question?” Fang Fa asked.\n“I’m going to give it a go.” Gu Ning said calmly.\n“? ? ?”\n“I’ve told my parents that I was interviewing for a tutor. But I’m afraid that they’ll be worried about my safety so I’ll tell them that you’ve introduced me to this position and it’s a friend of yours. So I thought if they ever asked you about this, can you help me to round up the lies?”\n“…… Wait, wait. Did you just say that you wanted to give it a go? Try what?” Fang Fa’s mind was a little baffled.\n“Try to see if I can get into the Five Stars Brigade.” Gu Ning repeated, she wasn’t surprised by Fang Fa’s reaction, after all, she looked like an ordinary girl right now, and he didn’t know about all the things that had happened in the other world.\nFang Fa took a deep breath: “Are you kidding me?”\nGu Ning stopped trying to explain the Five Stars Brigade and instead she said: “We’ll know if I’m joking or not when the time comes. Anyway, I hope you can still help me with answering my parents.”\nFang Fa gave her a penetrating stare, then replied after being feeling discouraged: “I don’t know why, but I kind of believe you when you say things that sounded like what some crazy people would say……”\nGu Ning smiled, then said: “Then I’ll count on you.”\nFang Fa watched Gu Ning casually take a taxi and leave.\nLooking at the black plastic bag he held in his hand, he sighed helplessly.\nHe had only known Gu Ning for less than a week and they had only met up three times. She already gave him the impression that she was very familiar with him, very familiar that she knew without a  doubt that he could not possibly refuse to help her.\nMoreover, she said that she was preparing to join the Five Stars Brigade herself?!\nIs she kidding? He was even abused by the Five Stars Brigade when he was in the army. Did she have some kind of hidden special skills?\nIt was two hours later when she reached the address that Brother San had given her.\nAfter paying a hefty taxi fare, Gu Ning had very little money left on her. Yet this was all an unavoidable expense.\nThat world was changing every day, she had to make herself stronger as soon as possible.\nRegarding the money dilemma, Gu Ning believed it was all temporary. When those dozens of gold necklaces get sold, tens of thousands of dollars would be in her hands thus solving the money problem.\nThinking about this, Gu Ning slightly calmed down her heart aching for the money spent.\nThe soldiers standing guard at the entrance noticed the first moment when Gu Ning got off the taxi.\nAfter all, this place was in the middle of nowhere and few people usually came here, not to mention a girl.\n“Hello, I’m here to find the commander of the Third Company. I’ve just spoken to him on the phone and he told me to wait for him here.” Gu Ning smiled and said to the soldier who was about to speak up.\nShe had borrowed the driver’s phone in the car to call Brother San.\nAt this moment, Brother San should be on his way here.\nSure enough, it wasn’t long before Brother San, dressed in a military uniform, came rushing from the inside of the gate.\nBefore they interact, Brother San’s sharp gaze had already sized up Gu Ning’s entire body without moving, and he was much more energetic than Gu Ning had ever seen him in the post-apocalyptic world.\nHe asked with a questioning tone: “You are Gu Ning?” Apparently, Gu Ning did not match the image of what he had imagined. Gu Ning was standing there in a tracksuit while carrying a large backpack and looked like every other ordinary girl. Also at the sight of Gu Ning’s blonde hair, Brother San frowned a little imperceptibly.\nGu Ning faintly smiled: “Yes. I am Gu Ning.”\n“Hold out your hand for me to see.” Brother San requested.\nGu Ning then honestly held out her hand with palm facing upwards.\nComparing Gu Ning’s tender left hand, her right hand is much rougher, the end of her fingers are thickly calloused from long hours of holding a knife. Instead, Brother San looked mainly at the first joint of her index finger near the purlicue where he didn’t see any gun callus, and he frowned and asked nonchalantly: “Are you sure you’ve touched a gun before that fired bullet and not a stabbing gun?”\nGu Ning, however, did not explain but simply said: “Since I have already arrived here, and you are already standing here, San…, Third Company Commander, why waste any more time?”\n“Come with me.” Without delaying any longer with Gu Ning, Brother San greeted the soldiers at the entrance and led Gu Ning through the gate.\n“Where did you hear about the Five Stars Brigade?” Brother San asked.\n“Naturally, it was the one who told me your information.” Gu Ning replied.\n“I hope you won’t waste my time.” Brother San’s current attitude was like the first time when Gu Ning met him in that small courtyard, and if she was meeting him for the first time, she would most likely be slightly apprehensive. However, she knew in her heart that after she had demonstrated her strength, Brother San would be more “friendly” to her.\n“I hope so.” Gu Ning replied modestly. After all, some part of her confidence mainly came from Brother San.\nGu Ning followed behind Brother San and walked for about ten minutes before they reached the large drilling ground, where many soldiers who were practicing couldn’t help but cast curious glances over.\nBrother San waved at the squad leader: “Zhao Shuo! Come here!”\nThe squad leader jogged over and saluted Brother San before glancing at Gu Ning and asked: “Company Commander, what is it?”\nBrother San replied: “Get Zhang XiaoBai, Zhao Jie, Zhong Xu, Zou Ming to come over to me.”\nThe squad leader was slightly stunned but still saluted and answered: “Yes Sir!”\nThen he trotted over to the group and shouted: “Zhang XiaoBai! Zhao Jie! Zhong Xu! Zou Ming! Come forward!”\nThen he came running back with those four soldiers.\nZhang XiaoBai, Gu Ning had met him before but the current Zhang XiaoBai was obviously even fairer than he had been in the post-apocalypse. Along with baby fat and bright eyes, he didn’t look like a soldier but more like a school student.\nThe name Zhao Jie also rang a bell for Gu Ning, the man who had died on that military truck.\nZhong Xu and Zou Ming, on the other hand, were names she hadn’t heard of and wondered if they were among the twenty or so survivors.\nA large portion of those soldiers who were curiously glancing over, half of them had died during the apocalypse.\nGu Ning collected her mind and waved away the feeling of sadness that had inexplicably risen in her heart.\nThese four people all began to size up Gu Ning.\nZhang XiaoBai was very blatant, his bright eyes curiously stared and sizing up Gu Ning.\n“These are a few of the best marksmen in our Third Company. If you can shoot better than them, then only will you be qualified to enter the Five Stars Brigade.” Brother San stated.\nThe four soldiers opposite them were all stunned. What did that mean? This girl was here to kick the bucket?\n“Let’s go. To the firing range.”\nOn the way, the other three people had no intention of talking to Gu Ning except Zhang XiaoBai who wanted to chat with her, but Gu Ning’s expressionless face was so apathetic that he didn’t dare to go forward and talk with her.\nBrother San was fast on his feet, but Gu Ning seemed to be at ease and was actually on pace with them.\nIn a far distance away, she heard the sound of gunshots ringing out one after another.\nZhang XiaoBai walked up and said: “Third Commander, it seems that the men from the Second Company are practicing their shooting.”\nBrother San sneered, then replied: “Just in time. They’ve got a new recruit this year who is incredibly talented. It’s a good time for us to have a sparring session.”\nZhang XiaoBai and the three of them looked at each other, all feeling the pressure on them.\nGu Ning, however, knew nothing about the situation and could only follow Brother San to the front.\nThe firing range was in an open field and the sound of gunfire rang out from time to time. When they got closer, the firing was over and the soldier in charge of counting the targets jogged over and reported excitedly to another soldier with the sleeves all rolled up: “Report, Company Commander! Ten rounds on target, ten rings for all ten rounds, a total of one hundred rings!”\nThe commander of the Second Company turned his stony face to a smiley one as he patted the soldier who stood up with his gun in his arms: “Good, not bad! Zhai Jun, you’re getting more and more stable now, keep this up for a few more days. When the Five Stars Brigade comes, you’ll definitely have a much higher chance than the group from Third Company!”\n“Company Commander, the Third Company is standing there.” A soldier warned in a whisper.\nIt was only then the Second Company Commander noticed that Brother San was standing there with the four soldiers under him who had the best marksmanship. In the middle, stood a girl with blonde hair. With a smile on his face, he didn’t feel embarrassed at all for talking about others behind their backs, and greeted Brother San: “Lao Xie! What are you standing over there for? Come over here!”\nThere were dozens of people from the Second Company, all of them were curiously looking at Gu Ning, speculating in their minds about her identity.\nGu Ning turned a blind eye to it and followed Brother San up to the front.\nBrother San pulled Gu Ning to the front and said to the commander of the Second Company: “Come, Lao Zhang, I’d like to introduce you to my niece.” Turning to Gu Ning again and spoke: “Gu Ning, say hello to the Second Company.”\nGu Ning couldn’t help but recall the situation where Brother San had introduced herself to Wang JiZhong and had a few moments of amusement in her heart, but her face remain solemn and greeted the Second Company Commander: “Nice to meet you, Second Company Commander.”\nZhang YueGuo said: “Lao Xie, have you forgotten the discipline of our troops. How can you just bring someone in and especially a girl? If the higher-ups find out about this, you’ll be punished.”\nBrother San replied: “I can’t help it after being pestered by her, no choice since I have such a niece. It’s just as well that I have nothing to do, so I brought her along for target practice.”\nZhang YueGuo glanced at Gu Ning a few times and said: “That’s not bad. A young girl who can shoot? Have you ever touched a gun before?”\nGu Ning glanced at Brother San, then replied with a smile: “I have touched it before but I just don’t know if I can shoot accurately.”\nZhang YueGuo said: “Then, since you’re Lao Xie’s niece, your marksmanship must not be too bad. Zhai Jun, give your gun to this little girl and let her try it out.”\n“Yes!” Zhai Jun handed the gun in his hand to Gu Ning.\nZhang YueGuo suddenly said again: “Hey! You should have unlocked the safety for someone before passing it to them!”\nThe soldiers of the Second Company burst into laughter.\nGu Ning took the gun and skilfully opened the safety, then smiled faintly at Zhai Jun and replied: “There’s no need. Thanks.”\nThen she walked over to the shooting position and plopped down in the same position as those soldiers did previously.\nZhang YueGuo looked at Gu Ning’s posture on the ground and couldn’t help but grin: “Hey? Lao Xie, at least you could teach your niece the shooting position.”\nGu Ning had no time to be distracted.\nShe concentrated on aiming at the target at 100 meters away.\nAs far as one’s eyesight goes, a target that was 100 meters away was slightly blurry. However, in Gu Ning’s eyes, she could see every line of the circle on the target incomparably clear.\nAmidst the din of the Second Company watching and jeering, there were a few moments of breathlessness from the Third Company.\nGu Ning stared at the very center of the target a hundred meters away as if she saw the head of the zombie, and then she pulled the trigger.\nBang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! ——\nShot after shot exploded in the open air.\nTen shots in a row.\nLess than a second apart.\nAs the gun went off, those soldiers from the second company stopped talking.\n“I’ll go and see, I’ll go and see!” Zhang XiaoBai shouted as he ran towards the target. After tilting his head and taking a few serious looks, he didn’t dare to believe his eyes.\nThen he came running back.\nHe had a few odd expressions on his face as he ran over and looked at Gu Ning for a few moments before shouting out to report.\nThe soldiers of the Second Company all gathered around, with relaxed expressions on their faces, and some even looked amused. There were even some soldiers that jeered: “Little girl, it’s normal to have an empty target! Don’t cry, we’re all old men here, there’s no one to hand you a tissue!”\nThis malicious remark prompted a burst of laughter from the Second Company.\nApparently, such jeering is very common here.\nThose few men from Third Company just looked intently at Zhang XiaoBai waiting for him to announce the result.\nWith the strange and incomprehensible expression on Zhang XiaoBai’s face, it’s difficult to judge whether it was caused by excitement or extreme disappointment.\nHowever, from the viewpoint of the Second Company, it was naturally the latter.\nGu Ning stood up from the ground, handed the gun back to Zhai Jun, politely thanked him, and then gave a nod to Brother San. Brother San’s tensed face relaxed slightly.\n“Report to the two company commanders!” Zhang XiaoBai’s face couldn’t hide his excitement: “Ten rounds on the target! Ten rounds, ten rings!”\nThe soldiers of the Second Company, who had been getting ready for more taunting, froze, as did Zhang YueGuo, the commander of the Second Company, as well as the three soldiers of the Third Company.\nA silence fell over the empty firing range.\nThen, out of nowhere, a wild burst of laughter erupted!\nGu Ning, who was standing beside Brother San, was also startled.\nBrother San vigorously patted Zhang YueGuo’s shoulder and said with a big smile: “Aiya! Lao Zhang ah, I forgot to tell you, Gu Ning is not only my niece but also the person whom I’m going to recommend to the Five Stars Brigade this time! Haha!”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sorry once again for the late update.

    "35": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-35/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nChapter 35\nWith Brother San laughing as he strolled away.\n\n\n\nThe expression from soldiers of the Second Company was very entertaining.\nSuddenly, one of the soldiers shouted: “I don’t believe she’s that good! Maybe they’ve cheated!” Then he ran to the target and checked it repeatedly before returning with his head hanging down and kept quiet.\nThe Second Company commander Zhang YueGuo’s face was gloomy, and the others didn’t dare to speak up. After a long while, he patted Zhai Jun’s shoulder and said: “Zhai Jun, as you can see, Xie AiGuo found such a formidable girl from somewhere. From the girl’s short interval between shots and with such high accuracy, she must be a veteran! In three days, the Five Stars Brigade will be coming over to pick their men. So, from today onwards, you will skip all those training from the company and concentrate on practicing your marksmanship instead.”\nZhai Jun nodded solemnly: “Yes! Company Commander.”\nSomeone asked: “But Company Commander, isn’t that girl the niece of the Third Company Commander?”\nZhang YueGuo frowned and replied: “Like hell, that’s his niece. If he had such a remarkable niece, and with his temperament of wanting to let the whole world know that he had something so great as if he would’ve hidden it until now?! You guys should go around and ask those little brats in the Third Company and check out where Xie AiGuo found this girl. If not, you’ll be overtaken and buried by the rest of the Third Company in the future! What are you waiting for? Keep practicing!”\nWhen the soldiers saw that Zhang YueGuo was so angry, they hurriedly went back to their target practice.\nZhai Jun even took up a spot and lay there without getting up again.\nOn the other side, the men from the Third Company were in a joyous sight.\nIt was nearly eleven o’clock by now, and Brother San simply ended the training and dragged everyone from the Third Company to a small restaurant outside the unit. The soldiers would occasionally come here to change their food choices and have a little drink when they were tired of eating the same big pot of dishes in the army canteen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNearly a hundred men from the Third Company, even the cooking squad, were pulled in, filling the small restaurant to its full capacity.\nZhang XiaoBai was standing up while fiercely describing Gu Ning’s heroic shooting back there and the changes in expressions of the group from the Second Company. Even Gu Ning, the person in question, did not know that there were so many interesting scenes that she had missed at that time.\n“You guys didn’t see it! In the beginning, the men of the Second Company were all very proud, and the Second Company Commander didn’t even look people in the eye. But to be honest, at that time we weren’t particularly confident in Gu Ning. At first, our Company Commander said that Gu Ning was his niece and had come over to practice shooting. The Second Company guys were even laughing and jeering at Gu Ning, but in the end, Gu Ning shot ten rounds! Ten rounds are all on target! Ten rounds, ten rings!” Zhang XiaoBai slapped his thigh and continued with exaggerated gestures: “Dang! You guys didn’t get to see that, especially when I reported the count! The faces of the Second Company’s men froze! Then it cracked! Their jaws fell to the ground! They couldn’t even pick them back up! The face of Zhai Jun, who was treated like a treasure by the Second Company Commander, stiffened like cement. What’s even funnier was the Second Company Commander’s expression! Oh my God! It was as black as the bottom of the pot in our canteen!”\nThere was a burst of laughter in the small restaurant.\nZhang XiaoBai continued in a vivid tone: “Later, our Company Commander patted the Second Company Commander’s shoulder and said, Lao Zhang, I’ve forgotten to tell you, Gu Ning besides being my niece, is also the person that I’m going to recommend to the Five Stars Brigade! You guys really missed it, that scene was so enjoyable to watch!”\n“Gu Ning! Did you used to be a soldier in some army?! How come you’re so good at shooting guns?!” One of the soldiers asked.\nBeing stared at by a hundred pairs of eager eyes, Gu Ning was slightly overwhelmed: “Er…… no, I’ve never been in the army, but I’ve learned to fire a gun at the shooting range before.”\nThat soldier was about to ask more questions but the restaurant owner came over and served the food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe menu was simple but still very abundant. Most of them were also meat dishes.\nZhang XiaoBai said jokingly: “Our Company Commander has made a big investment today! In the two years I’ve been here, I’ve never seen a company commander pay for a guest out of his pocket! This is the first time ever!”\nBrother San replied angrily: “Little brat! Wasn’t that New Year’s Eve meal on me?!”\nOne of the soldiers shouted while laughing: “Hey! Company Commander! I’ve heard that it’s the fund allocated by the regiment! How did it become your treat?!”\n“You brats, you can’t even beat them with guns! Even got destroyed by others in the field training! You have to be like Gu Ning and make me look good in front of Zhang YueGuo! I’d be happy even if I have to treat you guys every day! Today, thanks to this little girl, we have destroyed the prestige of the Second Company. We can celebrate but we can’t get too carried away! Got to pick up where we left off. Xiao Bai, Zhao Jie, Zou Ming, Zhong Xu!” Brother San suddenly named four people.\n“Yes! Company Commander!” The four men stood up in unison.\nBrother San said: “From today onwards, you four! Don’t have to attend the daily training, go to the firing range with Gu Ning and shoot! Keep practicing until the Five Stars Brigade comes!”\n“Yes! Company Commander!” The four men shouted in unison.\nThe rest of the soldiers all applauded.\nFinally, Brother San lifted the glass of liquor in front of him and said to the soldiers: “I’m so d*mn happy today, I’ll make an exception and drink this one. In three days, if we get past the Five Stars Brigade, I’ll invite all of you again to eat here! I’ll let you all have enough to drink by then!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Yes!” The soldiers shouted in response, all standing up in unison with their glasses in their hands.\nThe restaurant owners were all smiling till their eyes became a line as they listened.\nThis was the first time since the apocalypse that Gu Ning had seen such a lively situation, and for a moment she felt a great deal of emotion in her heart.\nBrother San raised the glass in his hand and turned to Gu Ning who was sitting opposite of him: “To Gu Ning!”\nThe soldiers all followed Brother San and raised their glasses to Gu Ning, then cheered loudly: “To Gu Ning!”\nGu Ning had a feeling of being overly flattered, and for some reason, she felt her blood boil as she lifted the glass of liquor in front of her, smiling as she looked around, before joining everyone else and gulped down the whole shot.\nAfter that, the soldiers all joked and returned to their seats and began to chat and eat at the same time.\nSlowly, one by one, the soldiers put down their rice bowls. A few of them ate too much and needed to spread themselves out on their chairs to catch their breath, and slowly, all eyes fell on Gu Ning.\nGu Ning was still eating.\nIn consideration of the soldiers’ appetite, the rice bowls in this small restaurant were relatively large ones, and the normal amount of food for a girl not on a diet was usually just a bowl. However, Gu Ning had already carried hers back and forth five times to refill her rice.\nAll the leftover slices of meat and such around her were all piled into her bowl.\nShe was eating with relish and concentration, as if there was nothing more important than food, stuffing her mouth full till her cheeks puffed out before she started chewing it. Although the dishes in the small restaurants were good, it wasn’t that great, and Gu Ning’s eating style made several soldiers who were already full feel hungry for another bowl.\nGu Ning finished the last bite of her meal and finally put down her bowl.\nHer belly was slightly bulging, but she didn’t feel too burdened. Gu Ning felt a sense of satisfaction as this was the first time she had eaten until she was full after her “mutation” and it felt so blissful.\n“Gu Ning, are you bloated? Do you want to go to the medical room and get some digestive tablets?” Zhang XiaoBai asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“No. I’m fine.” Gu Ning stood up easily: “Let’s go.”\n“Awesome! So impressive!” Zhang XiaoBai said in amazement as he looked at Gu Ning who stood up without any burden.\nHaving eaten to their fill, the soldiers all waited outside of the small restaurant.\nBrother San pawned his pistol to the owner’s wife, Gu Ning saw very clearly that Brother San’s hand shook a little but in preference of not wanting Gu Ning to notice it, his expression pretended as if nothing went wrong.\nThen the group of men marched back into the army gates.\nOn the way, Gu Ning was flanked like a celebrity in the center of the room, and the soldiers were asking Gu Ning for her secrets. Brother San was pushed to the outermost part of the group and he felt a sense of desolation…\nThere was a middle-aged soldier with thick eyebrows and a few young soldiers coming from the opposite of the road. He smiled at Brother San and greeted him: “Hey! Lao Xie, what are you guys doing here? So lively!”\n“Hello, First Company!”\nThe soldiers greeted each other in a variety of ways.\nBased on their enthusiasm and the smiles on their faces, Gu Ning determined that they should be in friendly-term with the First Company and their company commander.\nBrother San also smiled and replied: “Hey Lao Zhou! I’ve just taken them out for dinner and we’ve just come back.”\nFirst Company Commander Zhou ZiLai laughed and said: “Yo! You’re so stingy like an iron rooster and now you’re willing to pluck your feathers, huh?”\nThe soldiers burst into good-natured laughter and Gu Ning couldn’t help but smile slightly.\nThen Zhou ZiLai noticed Gu Ning, who after all, with her blonde hair, stood out in the middle of a pile of green uniforms.\n“Yo, you have a guest in your company. Come on, Lao Xie, introduce us.”\nBrother San laughed, then replied: “My niece.” He paused before adding it proudly: “She is also the person that I’m going to recommend to the Five Stars Brigade along with XiaoBai and the rest.”\nZhou ZiLai was slightly taken aback and stared at Gu Ning for a few moments before coming to a realization and said: “No wonder the men from the Second Company were practicing like crazy at the firing range today, it turns out that they were provoked by this little girl! Even you, an iron rooster, were willing to pluck their feathers, it seems like you’ve really dug up a treasure!”\nAnd he continued “How is it, how sure are you this time?”\nBrother San replied: “To be honest. I don’t know how sure it is yet, it all depends on who is coming over from the Five Stars Brigade. If it’s the same ones from last year, then there’s no problem. But I don’t think it will be the same group of people.”\nZhou ZiLai was surprised for a while: “That group wiped out three of our companies last year. It seems like you have lots of faith in this little girl.”\n“Alright, good luck. Give your Uncle San a boost. If you do get selected, it’ll be an act of pride even for our company.” Zhou ZiLai said to Gu Ning. It seemed that the Five Stars Brigade had indeed offended a lot of people.\nOn the other hand, Brother San said: “Lao Zhou, as if I don’t know you. I’m sure you have a few secret weapons that you won’t reveal until the very last moment. Anyway, we’ll see the real battle on the field when the time comes.”\n“Yes, yes! I’ll see you on the field then! No matter who wins, it’s a clean slate.” Zhou ZiLai replied with a smile.\nThen both groups parted from each other.\n“Company Commander, is the talk about the First Company having a secret weapon true?” Zhang XiaoBai asked as he came closer.\n“Lao Zhou, that old fox, there’s a possibility of it being true. But as for who it is, we won’t know until the Five Stars Brigade comes, which is in three days.” Brother San turned and said to them: “These are not things you should be concerned about. Now the four of you, bring Gu Ning and go to the firing range to practice.”\nGu Ning was in no hurry to leave now, and she had absolutely no confidence or certainty that her marksmanship could win over the Five Stars Brigade that had the entire army be on the edge of their seats. The most she could do now was to try to get as far as she could.\nThus, she followed Zhang XiaoBai and the rest to the firing range.\nZhai Jun and a few other soldiers from the Second Company were still practicing on the target, it seems like they hadn’t even eaten their lunch yet.\nAs Zhang XiaoBai came over with a full stomach, he rubbed his bulging stomach and strolled over while shouting: “Hey, you guys haven’t eaten yet? Your company commander is too inhumane, he doesn’t even provide food for you.”\nThe Second Company men, however, paid no attention to Zhang XiaoBai’s provocations, their eyes all gathered on Gu Ning instead.\nZhai Jun just glanced at Gu Ning for a few moments before continuing to aim at the distant target.\nThe soldier in charge of the range passed the gun to Gu Ning, who took it, then got down, aimed at the distant target through the scope, and began to concentrate on it.\nWhen Zhang XiaoBai saw how seriously Gu Ning acted, he lost the mood to joke around, so he found a position and started to practice his marksmanship seriously.\nThe recoil of the gun was quite strong and the loud gunshot sound was a great irritation to the eardrums and they usually had to stop for a break after about 30 to 40 shots.\nHowever, Gu Ning never got up again after lying down.\nZhang XiaoBai and the rest were stunned.\nThe soldiers of the Second Company kept glancing over at Gu Ning, and Zhai Jun just stared at her, who hadn’t even moved at all, with an indescribably complex expression. He only loosened his shoulders a little before continuing to lie down and shoot.\nIt was around 4 pm that Gu Ning finally ended her continuous afternoon of marksmanship practice and stood up to move her somewhat stiff body. The whole duration, she only adjusted her somewhat stiff posture occasionally and never stood up after lying down.\nZhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and the rest looked at Gu Ning with an expression that could only be described as one of horror.\nZhang XiaoBai didn’t even know what words to use to describe Gu Ning, and only after a while did he manage to mumble out a description: “What a pervert——“\nWhen Gu Ning borrowed money from Brother San, Brother San originally refused, but when he thought that Gu Ning was their hope and had a clean slate, coupled with the promise that she would pay it back. Along with the fact that she didn’t look like a swindler, he pulled out several hundred dollar bills from his wallet and handed them to Gu Ning with great solemnity before saying: “Gu Ning, this is all the pocket money I have for this month, you should cherish it.”\nGu Ning was really amused by the fact that this was a completely different personality of Brother San from the one she had imagined and replied: “Don’t worry Brother San. I’ll have the money to pay you back soon.” This was the money for her next taxi ride as she was just too broke right now.\nBrother San waved off at her: “Alright, alright. Go on now. Come back early tomorrow.”\nGu Ning then got into the military truck.\nIt felt Déjà vu that the military truck she had gotten into was the same one she had been in during the post-apocalypse world.\nThe person who gave her a lift was Luo Long.\nGu Ning kept her eyes closed, and there were no words exchanged along the way.\nA block away from her home, Gu Ning called out to a stop: “Just drop me off here. Thank you.”\nThen farewell.\nGu Ning strolled home.\nWhen she returned home, Father Gu had already returned from a day of classes.\nPutting the book down, he asked with concern: “Have you eaten yet? How did the interview go?”\nGu Ning had long prepared a speech for these and replied: “I ate out.  The one I’ve interviewed for didn’t work out, but Fang Fa introduced me to another one with pretty good conditions. Full day tutoring, and included lunch, for three hundred a day.”\nMother Gu was originally washing dishes in the kitchen but once she heard Gu Ning’s speech, she ran out without even drying her hands: “Such high treatment?! How long can you work there?”\nGu Ning said vaguely: “Three months shouldn’t be a problem.”\nFather Gu asked calmly: “You won’t be scammed right? Scammers these days are surprisingly clever.”\nMother Gu slapped Father Gu’s shoulder with her wet hand: “Aiyo! What are you talking about? Didn’t you hear NingNing say it was Xiao Fang who introduced it? He’s a cop! As if he will introduce NingNing to a crook?” She smiled happily and twiddled her fingers: “That’s three hundred a day, there are thirty days in a month so it will be nine thousand! That’s nearly thirty thousand dollars in three months!”\nFather Gu asked: “No holiday?”\nGu Ning replied calmly: “No vacation.”\nMother Gu said: “Oh my, this Xiao Fang is really so kind! How can he be so resourceful? He found such a reliable job for NingNing in such a short while, why don’t you ask him to come over for dinner tomorrow? So we can thank him too.”\nGu Ning already prepared for this and lied casually: “Fang Fa is a police officer and he is very busy. And I’ll be busy too, also I’ve already treated him to a meal today to thank him.”\nMother Gu was a little disappointed: “Alright then.”\nGu Ning went to the bathroom and washed up properly, took another shower before changing into her pajamas, and got out.\n“I’m exhausted from going around all day, I’m going to bed now.” With that, she went back to her bedroom. Once she’s back in her bedroom, her feigned tiredness was swept away and she became refreshed with her eyes lit up. Wearing back the dirty tracksuit on, then with a thought, she passed through the space and crossed over the door before returning to the post-apocalyptic world.\nIt was still the same abandoned small restaurant.\nAlthough she had already projected the time in this world in her mind, Gu Ning still subconsciously raised her hand to look at the watch on her wrist.\nAccording to Gu Ning’s calculations, the time over here now should be between one and two o’clock in the afternoon.\nHowever, the time on her watch shows eleven in the morning instead.\nIf this was not the next day, it means that the time between the two sides has gone from 1:2 to 1:3.\nBefore Gu Ning had time to react to the changes, the sudden sound of several intense gunshots shook her up! The gunshots originated from the direction of the colony’s gate! At the same time, a faint stench of decay lingered in front of Gu Ning’s nose. Her heart immediately rang with alarm, and with countless experiences of escaping from death, Gu Ning dodged towards the side door without the slightest hesitation! At the same time as she moved! A thing with green eyes that had been lurking in the shadows waiting for an opportunity, shifted too!\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Yikes it’s getting intense again for the next chapter!

    "36": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-36/\n(T/N: This chapter is dedicated to Paj for the generous support. Thank you so much. Also I’m trying this chapter with an audio for the short fight, hopefully it will be suitable and create a better intensive feeling when reading it. Please do remember to adjust your volume before playing the soundtrack. Thanks )\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAfter Gu Ning took a good look at the thing that was lunging towards her, her heart thumped and all the hairs on her body instantly stood up!\nIt was a black zombie dog, unlike the previous one which was huge, this was the size of a normal house dog. There was a large hole in its belly which its intestines flowed out of hanging on its belly and half of which was getting dragged on the ground collecting a huge grey knot of dirt and dust. As if it was oblivious to it, the moment it swooped out of the darkness it moved like a black bolt of lightning. If it wasn’t for Gu Ning’s keen sense and quick reactions, she would have been bitten by it!\nGu Ning had no time to be distracted by what was happening at the school gate and concentrated fully on the zombie dog, which didn’t give her the chance to remove the gun from her back. Fortunately, Gu Ning kept her knife on hand.\nBefore she could even raise her knife, the zombie dog lunged towards her! The dog was extremely fast and its small size in this narrow space gave it an advantage. In addition, unless the dog’s head was cut off or chopped into pieces, attacks on other parts of its body were basically ineffective. Gu Ning was forced to dodge repeatedly to defend herself and had no other way to launch a counterattack.\nFortunately, there was still some furniture left in the restaurant, and the dog was completely devoid of any intelligence and only pounced on its prey by instinct. Gu Ning relied on these obstacles for a while but neither side could take down the other.\nIf the zombie dog retained its intelligence, it would’ve been annoyed by Gu Ning’s slippery dodging.\nHowever, Gu Ning didn’t have much patience, she was still worried about the increasing intensity of gunfire and screaming at the school gate.\nHer parents were still on the campus, and if the gate was broken…Gu Ning dared not think further.\nGathering back her thoughts, she watched as the zombie dog made a move to leap over the table and lunge at her. Gu Ning did not dodge, but the moment the zombie dog leaped up! She kicked the table so hard and it crashed onto the dog’s belly while it was in mid-leap! Gu Ning’s face did not show any joyful expression when she managed to land the hit, she just raised her foot again, the zombie dog hissed and was knocked away by the strong force coming from the table!\nGu Ning used her full force in this kick, and the edge of the table caught the zombie dog’s abdomen and crashed into the drab wall. The zombie dog was still struggling to escape, however, Gu Ning naturally wouldn’t give it any chances. She leaped onto the table, used her strength to press down the table while making sure the zombie dog was stuck, and immobilized it in between the edge of the table and the wall. The knife in her hand came down viciously without any hesitation on the neck of the zombie dog. She clearly remembered that Brother San had told her that the zombie dog in the courtyard was still alive after being shot in the head, so Gu Ning didn’t dare to take it lightly. She made sure that the head of the zombie dog was chopped off, separating from its body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe zombie dog’s decapitated body slid off from the edge of the table and stopped moving.\nThe zombie dog’s head, however, rolled onto the table.\nGu Ning’s heart leaped up for a moment, she sliced the dog’s head into two, then used the tip of the knife to look around one half of the dog’s head. When it wasn’t in the left half, she started digging on the other one. Finally, the tip of her knife touched a small hard object, Gu Ning couldn’t help feeling happy. Once the tip of her knife picked the small object from the rotten and smelly brain. It was a pure white bead. Gu Ning didn’t even care about the filth, she just took out the bead which still reeked of rottenness, cupped it in her hands, and wiped the brain pulp off using the table rag, revealing its pristine, unblemished bead form. Unfortunately, she didn’t have time to admire it at this moment, so Gu Ning just pocketed it and ran out with her gun.\nJust as she appeared, a female zombie lunged towards her. There were limited bullets in the magazine so Gu Ning didn’t want to waste them, so she smashed the butt of her gun directly at it viciously! The zombie staggered backward from the impact, Gu Ning quickly drew the knife at her belt and thrust it towards the face of the female zombie which pounced back at her! The knife drawing action which Gu Ning practiced whenever she was free, got executed flawlessly as she was now incredibly skilled at it. Her current strength was monstrous, and if right now, she was a normal girl, she would’ve needed to hold the knife with both hands to plunge it into the zombie’s skull while also sprinting from a distance to gain a speed boost.\nAll thanks to Gu Ning’s extraordinary strength and precision she had honed through countless battles involving life and death. She only needed to make three moves, draw her knife, raise her hand, and slash it down, then the zombie would fall to the ground motionlessly.\nIt was only at this time that Gu Ning had spare time to observe the current situation at the school gate. When she first saw what was happening, her immediate reaction was to hide in the house, closing the door behind her but leaving a small enough gap from the door to peek out.\nCurrently, the school entrance was full of zombies. The zombies in the front row were sticking their hands into the gaps of the metal gate and clawing their way in. They were hissing with excitement and hunger, desperately trying to squeeze in, and there were at least two to three hundred of them!\nNot only at the front gate, in front of the school entrance was a horizontal road, and on this road, lots of zombies were swarming in. There were was a constant stream of zombies stumbling past three or four meters in front of Gu Ning, but none of them noticed that a living person was hiding inside. It could be because the smell from the zombie dog within the house overpowered Gu Ning’s scent, even when she had the door slightly ajar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe gunfire continued to ring out as rows of zombies fell to the ground with their heads blown off, and yet more zombies came, stepping over the corpses and filling in their positions.\nIf these zombies weren’t enough to instil horror, then within the crowd of zombies, there were dozens of zombies moving around with great agility and trying to climb up the metal gate, which would make anyone’s courage crumble.\nThe metal gate creaked as it was applied more and more pressure by the growing number of zombies.\nThe large lock hanging on the metal gate swung around and knocked on the bar as if it could be broken at any moment.\nMost of the guns were aimed at the zombies that were trying to climb over the gate.\nHowever, most of the people who held guns didn’t have enough opportunities to practice their marksmanship before the apocalypse happened so their aims were not that superb. More often than not, several of their shots fired would either miss or hit non-vital parts of the zombie. Basically, the ones who were able to hit those quick-moving zombies within three shots were the soldiers left behind by the Third Company for guarding.\nNaturally, Gu Ning saw the agile zombies trying to climb the metal gate. Having flexible bodies that were totally different from the usual zombies, were enough to make anyone feel a chill of despair just by looking at them.\nAll Gu Ning could hear was the constant sound of gunshots, yet it took several shots to bring down one of those zombies climbing the metal gate, and one of them even managed to climb to the top before it was shot down! Gu Ning was terrified, if a zombie broke through the gate, the defenceless people in the colony, including her parents, would be in danger.\nThe only saving grace was that the school wall was built high enough and although there were zombies who tried to climb over the wall, their efforts were in vain.\nThis small restaurant had three floors in total, the ground floor was the small restaurant and the next levels were the residential building. Without further ado, Gu Ning carried her gun in front of her before going to the back door and dashed up the stairs she found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThose quick-moving zombies continuously climbed upwards, almost covering up the entire metal gate. A large amount of densely gathered zombies on the metal gate was very terrifying and some of them even climbed higher before it got knocked down.\nThere were also some zombies banging on the small side door next to the gate. The side door was not strong enough to withstand several ramming attempts. Bai Lang called a dozen men to barricade that door using their bodies, and then grimly looked at the culprit who had drawn all these hordes of zombies back.\nThe culprit was the group of ten or so people who had traded a large number of supplies last night and stayed in the hostel.\nHalf an hour ago, they hurriedly ran back into the colony, and less than ten minutes later, those zombies blocked the entire school entrance.\nBy this time, they were surrounded by Bai Lang’s men.\nYin Sang stood with the man in a white shirt wearing glasses, countless daggers emanating from those beautiful eyes. If those merciless glances could be materialized, those people would probably be shredded to pieces long ago.\n“If only Gu Ning and Brother San were here.” Cheng Ming said with a frown as he watched the countless zombies that gathered at the entrance and doesn’t seem to be reducing no matter what.\nCheng Ming and Jia DaoZhang came out to check out the situation, while Xie YuHong and Huang MengYao stayed back in the hostel to look after Gu Ning’s parents.\nMost people remained in the building at this point, listening to the gunfire and waiting trepidatiously. Either waiting for victory or for the zombies to break in.\nWhile a small number of people came out of the building to check out the situation.\nGu Ning quickly ran to the top floor, the distance diagonally from the gate was about three hundred meters away. She found a good angle and proceeded to aim her gun at the zombies who were climbing the iron metal, after aiming, she pulled the trigger——\nBang!\nThe bullet went through the back of the zombie’s head with perfect accuracy.\nThe gunshot from Gu Ning’s side was kind of loud, but the gunshots in the colony were even more intense, so no one paid any attention to her gunfire. Even the zombies with the keen sense of hearing were not attracted by it and they still kept surging towards the metal gate.\nGu Ning continued to aim at the next one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn average, she fired a shot every five seconds.\nOut of ten shots, at least eight of them hit the target.\nThe gunmen firing in the colony were a little puzzled, wondering how all of a sudden, their accuracy was so much higher. Zombies kept falling from the metal gate, landing into the group of zombies below them, smashing down pile after pile. However, the zombies seemed to be endless, and after killing a group of them, another group rushed in to fill up the open spot.\nStill, the fact that the metal gates were crawling with zombies a moment ago and now they were cleared all at once, managed to catch the attention of some people.\nThe white-shirted man noticed that one zombie had fallen backward, but there were no bullet holes in the entire face, so it had to be shot from the back.\nThe eyes behind the glasses quickly locked onto the roof of the third floor diagonally across the street and said in a deep voice: “There’s someone on the roof across the street.”\nYin Sang, who was standing beside him, raised her head at once to follow his gaze and indeed saw a person with a gun raised right there, and she raised her eyebrows in surprise: “It’s her?!”\nGu Ning’s blonde hair was so conspicuous that it wasn’t hard to recognize her.\nGu Ning was completely unaware that she had been discovered, and naturally, she didn’t care at all. She just focused on her aim and fired, the bullet casing ejected, bullet shot out and passed through the skull of a zombie.\nMore and more people spotted her.\n“Jia DaoZhang! Look! Gu Ning is over there!” Cheng Ming pointed excitedly at the top floor of the building diagonally opposite the colony.\nWhen Jia DaoZhang squinted his eyes, he saw a handful of golden hair and instantly recognized that it was Gu Ning.\nIn this colony, the name Gu Ning was not well known, but her iconic blonde hair was of no small renown.\nIt caused a gasp of surprise from the surrounding.\nBai Lang glanced at the roof of the opposite building, then shot down a zombie before turning to Pei Jing, the leader of the troublemakers, and said: “I’ll send you all to heaven the second this door is slammed open.”\nYan Yu, who had been standing next to Pei Jing, could no longer suppress her anger that she had been holding back and roared: “Then you should die first!” As she roared out this sentence, she opened her palm and pushed it forward in the direction of Bai Lang!\nPei Jing, who was next to her, couldn’t stop her in time and his expression suddenly changed! “Yan Yu!”\nJust as she pushed out her palm! A football-sized ball of fire appeared out of the thin air in front of her palm! Whirling with flames, the moment this ball of fire appeared, even the air around it was a few degrees warmer! Yan Yu’s shrill cry had already attracted a lot of attention, but now seeing a fireball appear out of the thin air from her hands garnered even more attention! As Yan Yu pushed her hands forward, that fireball flew out with a whirring sound and flew straight towards Bai Lang’s face!\nAll the onlookers were caught by surprise, and they became even more shocked at the sight of a fireball flying rapidly towards Bai Lang under Yan Yu’s control and a cry of astonishment rang out at once!\nGu Ning was standing on the roof of the third floor in the opposite building, and she could see what was happening inside the colony right under her nose. When she saw with unparalleled clarity the fireball just appeared out of thin air and flew out under Yan Yu’s control, and in shock, she even forgot to continue shooting!\nThat fireball was extremely fast, and it came close in the blink of an eye!\n“Bai Lang! Watch out!” Yin Sang and the man in the white shirt shouted at the same time.\nEven Gu Ning couldn’t help but get nervous.\nBai Lang stared at the in-coming fireball straight at him, his face was stoic and solemn, his gaze was icy cold, but there wasn’t a hint of panic on his face. He didn’t even bother to dodge or evade, he just raised his gun and aimed at the fireball, bang bang bang! A few shots rang out. The ghastly-looking ball of fire, under the continuous impact of bullets, fell apart while in mid-air.\nBai Lang stepped on the remnants of the fireball, his gun aimed at Yan Yu, smiling slightly, but this smile was eerily cold: “Sorry, it’s you who will die first.”\nCountless guns turned around and aimed at Yan Yu and the ten or so others in her group. Those onlookers who had been watching the drama unfold tensed up at this moment. Meanwhile, the remaining soldiers of the Third Company continued shooting at the zombies off the metal gate.\nThe situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse!\nYan Yu shuddered uncontrollably as a lot of guns pointed at her, she hadn’t expected at all that the fireball she sent out would be shattered with a gun! And with so many guns aimed at her, she simply didn’t dare to send out a second fireball.\n“Wait! Don’t shoot yet!” At that moment Pei Jing suddenly spoke, while raising his hands in a gesture of surrender to avoid being shot outright.\nStaring at Bai Lang, he continued: “As long as you don’t kill her, I can tell you the secret about the fireball!”\n“Hmmm. Good offer.” Bai Lang nodded, but his hand holding the gun didn’t lower: “But let’s wait until the person in the way is dead.” He replied and was about to pull the trigger.\n“Bai Lang.” The white-shirted man pressed Bai Lang’s hand that was holding the gun, then he pushed the glasses up and glanced at Yan Yu before saying: “Keep her to deal with those zombies.”\nBai Lang gave a glance at the densely packed zombies outside the metal gate, and his long slanted eyes narrowed slightly.\nPei Jing immediately spoke: “We can help you to get rid of all the zombies out there.”\nBai Lang’s long slanted eyes rose slightly upwards, and his expression changed into a sneer as he said: “Help me?”\nWhen Pei Jing thought of the fact that they had indeed lured all these zombies to the colony, he had to change his tone and said: “Anyway, we will take care of these zombies, and besides, I will tell you what you want to know.”\nBai Lang finally showed a satisfied smile, then said to the soldiers who were still loading their bullets: “Do you hear them? Leave the zombies to them and save the bullets for your Brother San.”\nThe few soldiers hesitated but in the end, they stopped their shooting.\nAlthough Gu Ning had sharp ears, she was still too far away to hear the conversation, so she could only notice that the sound of gunfire had faded out and as she was wondering what was going on, she saw Yan Yu, the one who had released the fireball earlier, reluctantly walk up to the metal gate and opened her palm. In the next instant, two fireballs appeared out of thin air on top of her palm, hovering upwards with flames swirling.\nAs she raised her hands, two fireballs traced a curved line in the air, flying across the metal gate, and slammed down!\nIt smashed into the crowd of zombies with a loud bang, instantly igniting the clothes on the zombies’ bodies!\nYan Yu threw about twenty fireballs one after another, hitting the zombies in different directions, her face was pale as if she had lost her strength and couldn’t send out any more fireballs.\nHowever, those twenty fireballs were enough.\nIn just under three minutes, the fire spread, accompanied by the burning smell of rottenness as the zombies were decaying. The flames shot up into the sky, beyond the metal gate, the flames and the hissing of the zombies were in unison.\nGu Ning put down the gun in her hand and watched the zombies screaming and hissing in the fire as the thick smoke raised to the sky. For a moment, she didn’t know what to feel.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Alright so… I wanted to add more audio but the chapter had too many interval which broke off Gu Ning’s fight so that’s all for now. For future longer battle scene, hopefully I will be able to add in more background music. Hehehe, hope you guys enjoyed reading!  =) )\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "37": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-37/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe last few remaining zombies were all wiped out.\nGu Ning stayed on the roof of the building until the smoke faded away before she went down with her gun on her back.\n\n\n\nThe ground was covered with burnt corpses and some were left with just bones and ashes. When Gu Ning was about to reach the gate, she suddenly stepped on something round and slippery under her feet. She was slightly stunned before moving her feet away and saw a transparent bead on the ground. Gu Ning was a little surprised and hurriedly squatted down to pick it up. Moreover, just as she picked up the bead, she found a second bead, then a third, a fourth and a fifth…..\nIn the end, Gu Ning bent over and picked up at least thirty-five beads near the metal gate.\nAll of them were transparent, crystal clear and lustrous.\nThese beads seemed to be only available to those zombies that had higher agility.\nGu Ning unzipped her backpack to keep those beads before she entered the colony.\nShe was stopped by a group of people.\nIn the front of the group was Yan Yu, who led those ten or so people to block Gu Ning’s path.\nPei Jing had already been taken away by Bai Lang at this time.\n“Hand over the stuff.”\nGu Ning glanced at her but continued to drop the beads into her backpack as if she didn’t hear them, then slung it over her back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCheng Ming and Jia DaoZhang both hurriedly walked over and stood next to Gu Ning, watching the group warily.\nThe few soldiers who had stayed behind for guarding also noticed the occurrence and they were not in a hurry to leave but glanced over from afar to observe the situation.\nYan Yu was a little impatient: “Didn’t you hear me? Hand over my things!”\n“Your things?” Gu Ning raised her eyebrows slightly.\n“Of course!” Yan Yu said without hesitation: “Didn’t you see that huge fire just now?”\nGu Ning looked at her coldly: “If I’m not wrong, only those zombies who climbed up the metal gate and moved swiftly had such beads. I stood on the roof of the opposite building and fired my gun, and shot an estimate of more than forty shots. All of them were aimed at the zombies on the metal gates. During which you were just watching. By the time that fire of yours burned the zombies, there were only regular ones left.”\nYan Yu sneered: “Hmph, you said you fired over forty shots from such a distance? As if you managed to hit the zombies with every shot.”\nGu Ning stopped arguing with her, took down her gun, turned around and aimed at an antenna erected diagonally across from where she previously was before she pulled the trigger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Bang!” The sound of a gunshot rang.\nImmediately afterwards, the antennae snapped off at the waist.\nThen, Gu Ning turned her gun around and aimed the muzzle at Yan Yu, saying coldly: “Do you think, the second before you could send out those fireballs, your head will explode with a bang?”\nYan Yu’s expression instantly changed, she was kind of unlucky today. Bai Lang was a fearless person, and here she met Gu Ning who was unmoved by force or persuasion. Twice in a day, she has had guns pointed at her head when she already had special abilities. One can imagine how she felt now.\nAt the same time as Gu Ning turned her gun towards Yan Yu, the soldiers who had been observing the situation also raised their guns and pointed them at Yan Yu’s group. It was believed that as soon as they moved, the soldiers would not hesitate to shoot. After all, there was no need to pay a life for a life in this post-apocalyptic world.\nFinally, under such pressure, a man pulled Yan Yu and spoke: “Yan Yu. Pei Jing said not to cause any trouble.”\nYan Yu’s expression changed several times before finally glaring at Gu Ning with indignation before saying: “Fine. Lucky you! I hope you won’t regret it later! Let’s go!”\nAfter saying those, she led the group away.\n“Gu Ning, that Yan Yu is so powerful. Since you offended her, I’m afraid she will find trouble with you.” Cheng Ming said worriedly.\nGu Ning thought to herself, of course, she didn’t want to offend them either, but there was no way she could hand over those beads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf Bai Lang could easily shatter the fireball with just a few shots, then these abilities were not all that unsurmountable.\nBut as long as she became strong, she would fear no one.\nShe smiled at the few soldiers in the distance with a nod of thanks. Then she told Jia DaoZhang and Cheng Ming: “Let’s go back now.”\nWhen they returned to the dormitory, Father Gu and Mother Gu were relieved to see that Gu Ning had returned safely.\nGu Ning comforted them for a while and assured them that the zombies at the school entrance had been cleared away.\nAfterwards, they walked to the next dormitory room and started to discuss what just happened at the school gate.\nHuang MengYao and Xie YuHong listened to Cheng Ming’s description of how Yan Yu had created a fireball and both were a bit incredulous.\n“Does she know magic? Or maybe some kind of supernatural powers?” Huang MengYao asked.\n“It’s because of this.” Gu Ning silently took out a transparent bead from her backpack and placed it on her palm.\nJia DaoZhang was the first to come closer: “What is this thing?”\nThe other three also came closer to inspect the bead, all waiting for Gu Ning to answer their confusion.\n“It was dug out from the brains of the zombies.” Gu Ning replied.\nJia DaoZhang, who had come the closest, jerked back at once: “What?!”\nGu Ning continued: “If I’m correct, Yan yu developed her psychic abilities because she had swallowed this bead. There was also a little girl who I met who also had other psychic abilities, all because she had swallowed the bead too.”\nJia DaoZhang raised his concern: “This is dug out from the brains of zombies…… what if …… what if after eating it, there is no psychic power and we turned into zombies instead?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Jia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming, you guys should have seen that the zombies are evolving. They no longer have stiff limbs, they can climb and run. If we don’t become stronger, we will become food for them.”\nGu Ning spread her palm, with four beads in her hand, then stated: “The choice is yours.”\nThe four looked at each other wordlessly, with struggle and hesitation in each other’s eyes.\nHuang MengYao was the first to take it. Then it was Cheng Ming, Xie YuHong and then Jia DaoZhang.\nThe four of them were silent as they washed the bead carefully with water.\nJia DaoZhang muttered: “Should we use boiling water to cleanse it?”\nJust as the four of them stood up and were ready to swallow.\nA childish voice rang out abruptly at the entrance of the dormitory: “it’s useless.”\nAt once, all eyes were drawn to it.\nGu Ning looked at the people who appeared at the entrance of the dormitory and frowned slightly.\nThe two people who suddenly appeared at the dormitory’s door, a tall one and a short one, a boy and a girl, were none other than the two siblings Xiang Yi and Xiang Xu.\nXiang Yi said: “If you want to develop psychic abilities, these transparent beads have no effect, you need the coloured beads to stimulate the psychic abilities. Also, these transparent beads are for replenishment when the abilities are severely depleted and the odds are not hundred percent.” He said with a shrug: “Just like me, the unlucky one. I’ve already eaten two beads without developing any psychic powers.”\nThe four of them in the room were stunned by this amount of information and subconsciously glanced at Gu Ning.\nGu Ning silently finished digesting the information then looked at the little girl Xiang Xu: “What about you? What colour beads did you eat to develop your powers?”\nXiang Xu replied: “Pure white.” Her voice was clear and childish but her gaze was calm, and the expression she was showing shouldn’t be one appearing at this age.”\nHer dark eyes stared at Gu Ning as she pleaded: “If it’s possible, I’d like to speak to you alone.”\nGu Ning’s eyes narrowed slightly as she stared at her for a long time before giving a nod to Jia DaoZhang and the rest.\nAlthough Jia DaoZhang and the rest were all very curious about Xiang Xu, they could only stand up and walk out.\nThen Xiang Xu walked in while Xiang Yi closed the door from the outside.\nGu Ning and Xiang Xu were the only ones left in the room.\nGu Ning looked at Xiang Xu and asked: “Go ahead, what do you want to talk to me about?” The scene at this point was somewhat ridiculous, a girl in her twenties and a little girl of seven or eight years old, both of them with very serious and calm expressions. If Gu Ning’s expression was perfectly normal, then seeing a seven or eight-year-old little girl showing such a look was a bit precocious and bizarre.\nXiang Xu’s dark eyes were like a deep pool, as she gazed fixed on Gu Ning and spoke with shocking information: “I can see the future.”\nAs the words spilt out of the girl’s mouth, the calmness in Gu Ning’s eyes finally changed a little.\n“After swallowing the white bead, I had a dream in which I saw a lot of things. I knew that these beads would later be referred to as crystal cores, the zombies would become more powerful and even the animals would start to mutate, and also there is you.” Xiang Xu looked deeply at Gu Ning, those eyes were as if like a deep pool, and countless images seemed to be flashing past in those deep pools: “I saw you standing on a very huge tree, I saw your dazzling golden hair, I saw you running on a behemoth, I saw a green ocean …… I always thought it was just a dream. But after seeing you that day, I knew that it wasn’t a dream, but is the future which I saw.”\nGu Ning listened to her last sentence, her expression remained calm but her heart was already thumping and pounding like a huge wave.\nCrystal cores, zombie evolution, animal mutations, giant trees, a behemoth, a green ocean……\nAll these things felt like they were bombarding Gu Ning’s mind, causing a great shock in her mind.\nGu Ning couldn’t speak for a long time, because she didn’t know what to say, or ask if all these were true. Gu Ning didn’t think Xiang Xu could make up so many things out of thin air, not to mention the huge trees and green oceans existed, and Xiang Xu had no motive to make up these lies.\n“That’s the reason why I must follow you.” Xiang Xu looked deeply at Gu Ning and said with a bit of a mysterious tone in her voice: “This is what the future has revealed to me.”\nGu Ning looked at Xiang Xu’s tender face and peered through her dark eyes into the deepest part of the pool, catching a hint of tension that was hard to detect. As well as her unconscious pursed lips that gave away the fact that she was not as calm as she appeared to be.\nOn the contrary, if one didn’t look closely, this face despite its youthfulness, had an unmistakable look of seriousness and composure.\nGu Ning couldn’t help but think that this Xiang Xu, who was only seven or eight years old, was actually more of a competent charlatan than Jia DaoZhang——\n===============================================================\n(T/N: I seriously don’t like Yan Yu character… XD well tbh whoever that goes against Gu Ning, is not that favourable haha. Now, aren’t you all curious about Gu Ning’s abilities? =) Thank you for reading!)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "38": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-38/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning didn’t dwell on why Xiang Xu had gained such an ability, but instead, she milked her for all the information that might be useful.\nThis includes the coloured cores to enable one to develop psychic powers, while the transparent cores could only be used as replenishment for the consumption of psychic energy.\n\n\n\nWith this question in mind, Gu Ning asked: “Do the powers deplete?”\n“Yes.” Xiang Su nodded seriously: “Just like today at the front gate, the maximum number of fireballs that the woman could send out was probably around twenty. Usually conjuring each fireball would consume a certain amount of the psychic energy in her body.”\n“What about you?” Gu Ning asked.\n“I can cover this whole campus with my spiritual power. That means any place that I want to see can be seen.” Xiang Xu said confidently.\nThe sighting that Xiang Xu speaks of was not the same as viewing with the naked eye. Spiritual power cannot be described as eyes, but it was more of a feeling, like countless tentacles touching things. It was through the touching and feeling of tentacles like a blind man’s hand touching something and then transmitting the information through the conduction of spirituality.\nIt was as if Xiang Xu’s spiritual power could sense the people coming from which direction immediately, and if it was more detailed, she could also tell whether it was a man or a woman based on the shape of their clothing. Moreover, if more information was required, then she would need to use more spiritual energy to analyse the detailed work.\nIt wasn’t like how the naked eye could see at a glance the gender, sizes and height of the several people walking past.\nGu Ning nodded, then asked: “So you don’t have any other abilities besides being the radar?”\n…… Xiang Xu was stunned for a moment at Gu Ning’s description, then after thinking carefully, she replied in a deflated voice: “At least for now, yes.” But she added quickly: “But I’m working on other uses for the spiritual power right now. You know, I have only eaten the bead a few days ago. If I had more time, I would become much more powerful. Also, just the effect of a radar alone could help you to avoid a lot of danger.”\nGu Ning, however, didn’t continue to dwell on the utility of the radar, but asked with interest: “How old are you?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nXiang Cu was firstly stunned by the sudden change of topic, then she realized what Gu Ning meant by asking this question, so she said with an almost imperceptible pride: “I’m eight years old. I’m in grade three of junior high school.”\nGu Ning didn’t ask her what grade she went to school in, but she took the initiative to say it, and this was a tactic she used to score extra points in front of Gu Ning. Proving that she was smart and far cleverer than what Gu Ning thought she was.\nYet Gu Ning’s reaction was a big disappointment to Xiang Xu, as she merely nodded coldly, and wasn’t impressed by it.\nThis was a little frustrating for Xiang Xu. She was born differently, from the first moment she opened her eyes, she could already remember things. She spoke at half a year old, and by the time she was one, she could already carry on a fluent conversation. As for her studies, which were a headache for most people, she had an easy time of it, and at the age of just eight, she had already skipped a grade to junior school. She even made a lot of headlines from it and was offered several TV shows and interviews, but she turned down all of them.\nXiang Xu could not hold a conversation with people of her age at all, and even some adults were inexplicably in awe of her.\nShe was a good observer of others’ behaviour and easily caught others’ weaknesses.\nHowever, with this Gu Ning, she had been carefully testing out the waters. Yet apart from the time when she revealed her biggest secret, that she could see the future, Gu Ning only showed a normal surprised expression. After that, all the rest of the conversations, she was so calm that it was a little intimidating.\nAlso, it had been a long time since Xiang Xu felt what it meant to be afraid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAt this moment, Gu Ning did not have time to focus on Xiang Xu’s feelings, but she carefully pondered over what Xiang Xu had said, and after thinking about it, she had come to a conclusion. The development of one’s psychic power after eating the crystal core depends on one’s potential.\n“You said that the chance of a crystal core allowing someone to develop wasn’t certain.” Gu Ning said.\nXiang Xu quickly pulled herself out of that frustration and answered Gu Ning’s question: “Yes. A lot of people developed special abilities, but the rest remained as ordinary people. So it may be zero percent, or even lower than that.”\nGu Ning was not in a good mood recently, even felt slightly depressed: “So, now I belong to the group of ordinary people.”\nIt was a declarative sentence. After she had eaten the bead, she hadn’t noticed anything different about herself at all, and she would probably be even more depressed now if the space hadn’t changed much. Aside from the changes in the space which quite frankly was dispensable and the only thing it did was to help her relax. Gu Ning was more eager for her strength to increase instead. After all, she had already tried, and that space could only be entered by her alone.\n“It’s strange.” At this point Xiang Xu’s light-coloured eyebrows couldn’t help but frown like an adult: “I can clearly sense a very strong wave of psychic energy in your body and your eyes also show the changes that would only occur if you had developed psychic powers. But you can’t emit any psychic power, and I don’t know what’s going on.”\nGu Ning secretly speculated in her heart, could it be because the psychic power that was supposed to be in her body had been robbed by the space and then evolved the space. Although she had developed the special ability, she had no psychic power to use, this was really…… Gu Ning sighed in her heart, feeling depressed.\nGu Ning and Xiang Xu’s conversation went on for a long time.\nIn conclusion, Gu Ning’s final words were: “You are very clever, but clever people often have too many ideas of their own. I can promise that you will never starve or freeze as long as you follow me, but I need a promise from you too.” Gu Ning continued with a cold and solemn face: “I will not treat you like a child, and it is entirely possible to squeeze dry your psychic power. Also, you must obey me completely, show your intelligence appropriately and discipline that brother of yours. If you can do these things, then you may move into this dormitory of ours.”\nInstead of being intimidated by Gu Ning’s words, Xiang Xu gave a relaxed smile, a light dimple appearing on the right side of her face, adding a bit of cuteness to her as she replied: “Before that, my brother and I had been worried about how are we going to survive through the winter. Both of us had made a vow when we buried our parents that we will live well. However, the two of us are still too young, and this world is so treacherous that we might be killed before we can become strong.” She looked at Gu Ning, her eyes filled with genuine gratitude: “I am indeed very smart, so I understand very well that if I lose this opportunity, there will never be a second one. And we will prove to you that you have made the unbelievably right decision today.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt was only after Xiang Xu walked out of the dormitory door that she felt a pang of fear.\nNo matter how thrilling or touching her words were, Gu Ning always gazed at her coldly with those light-coloured pupils. It was as if this conversation was a life-or-death decision for her, while for Gu Ning, it was just an optional decision. The attitude which Gu Ning displayed, forced her to play without reservation and revealed her trump card that she had not planned to reveal all at once, and even made a promise that she would otherwise never agree to.\nHowever, for some reason, she should have gained the initiative advantages in her plan, yet things went far beyond her expectations. Also, the outcome was very different from what she had envisioned, but she felt happy, unexpectedly happy……\nFacing Xiang Yi’s slightly worried look, Xiang Xu gave him a nod before spreading one of the brightest smiles she had since the apocalypse happened.\nTherefore, the outcome was that the two siblings, Xiang Yi and Xiang Xu, moved into the dormitory.\nCheng Ming, Jia DaoZhang, and the rest who were completely unaware of Xiang Xu’s psychic powers showed their surprises openly.\nAfter all, Gu Ning really didn’t seem like the kind of person with such a sympathetic heart.\nGu Ning allowed Xiang Xu to give a short introduction to her psychic powers and everyone’s face, except Xiang Yi, showed a very astonished expression. Obviously, Xiang Xu’s psychic ability had shocked them.\nJia DaoZhang lamented: “High-tech radar, huh.”\nAnother brief self-introduction was made to each other.\nThen Gu Ning got down to business.\n“I am going to send the news of the crystal core to Brother San, then go out with them and the others to kill zombies and collect the cores. We must take advantage of the fact that not many people know about this news yet, and take the initiative. The time we buy during this period will be the time we overtake the others.”\nJia DaoZhang nodded his head and replied: “Gu Ning has a point. Once this news spreads, it will drive people crazy.”\nEveryone agreed.\nMoreover, they were vaguely excited. Both Jia DaoZhang and Cheng Ming had seen Yan Yu use her ability with their own eyes. Whereas Huang MengYao and Xie YuHong, had only heard about it through their discussion, and they were all very keen on obtaining the kind of special ability that was similar to conjuring fireballs from their empty hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning’s gaze swept around the faces of the crowd and said: “So, which one of you is willing to go with me.”\nAll of them looked at each other and then gave a solemn nod.\nIt was clear that no one wanted to miss out on this opportunity.\n“Very well.” Gu Ning said: “Xiang Xu, you are in charge of monitoring the gates of the colony, if any military trucks came back, then they are Brother San’s men, do inform me immediately.”\nXiang Xu nodded, her pupils slightly shrinking, while the invisible spiritual power had already dispersed out, heading straight to the entrance’s gate.\nWhile monitoring the main gate, she was still focusing on Gu Ning, waiting for Gu Ning’s next arrangement.\nHuang MengYao asked: “If we all leave, then who will take care of Uncle and Auntie?”\nGu Ning replied: “I will send them over to Brother San’s place.”\nEven if Yan Yu’s and Wang JiZhong’s groups of people wanted to find trouble while she was away, they would have to go through the guns at the hands of the soldiers of the Third Company if they would agree.\nGu Ning continued: “When we develop our abilities, we can try to head over to the downtown area where the zombies are denser. Seeing as winter is approaching, we need a lot of supplies and warm clothing along with quilts.” It wasn’t just them, but also the soldiers of the Third Company and the children too. Gu Ning could never forget those curious and well-behaved eyes. H-Province was as hot as a furnace in summer and notoriously cold in winter, and there was also a very serious snowstorm previously.\nIt was the first winter of the post-apocalyptic era, and most people had left their homes in a hurry without any warm clothing and adequate supplies. It was in fear that half of those nearly hundred or so children would not survive through this winter. As Brother San said, these children may be weak now, but one day, when their generation was slowly growing old, they would also grow up and become stronger.\nThey were the hope for the future of the world.\nTherefore, as much as she could, she hoped to help them through the first cold winter of the post-apocalyptic era while they were still weak.\nThe downtown area was concentrated with zombies, a hard-affected area. After the apocalypse happened, many people who had escaped from there did not dare to venture back in. They only dared to seek new hiding places in some other remote areas.\nOn the contrary, it also meant that there were a lot of large supermarkets, shopping malls, and various department stores that had not been looted. Thus, there were ample supplies in there which they desperately needed.\nThinking in this direction, that space that had evolved would be able to hold more stuff than the not-so-spacious little room. It should be enough for her to sweep through all the major shopping malls and supermarkets in the entire province without worry.\nThinking through this, Gu Ning’s depressing feeling that she had developed her space but had no psychic power to use was kind of going away.\nOf course, Gu Ning hadn’t forgotten about her plan to go to the jewellery shop and pick up the loot.\nCurrently, she was poor, absolutely poor, so she thought about it that although it was slightly dangerous in this side of the post-apocalyptic world, it was still very rewarding. At least it would be able to help to pay off the debts her family now owes.\nIn short, the most important thing right now was to evolve her powers first. Including her parents, if both Father Gu and Mother Gu had developed their powers, she wouldn’t need them to go out and kill zombies. As long as they could defend themselves, then it would be much easier for her.\nIf with a little luck, Jia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming, Huang MengYao and Xie YuHong managed to develop abilities as well, the weight on her shoulder would also become a lot lighter.\nAnd on the unfortunate event, none of them develops any abilities, she would have to rethink carefully about whether she still needed such a companion.\nAlthough it was a bit cruel, they were not related to her at all, and they had only known each other for two days. To put it more bluntly, they were only interested in the strength that Gu Ning had shown. Thus, it makes perfect sense for Gu Ning to kick them out because they haven’t proven themselves that they won’t be dragging her down. This was a case of each taking what they wanted from the other.\nOf course, Gu Ning didn’t want such a thing to happen. After all, the several crises that happened previously, they were the first ones to stand by her side, and they rarely showed disagreement with her decisions. These four people could be considered trustworthy, and in this post-apocalyptic world, such people were hard to come by.\nGu Ning was considering lots of things.\nJia DaoZhang and the others were still in a state of excitement that they were about to obtain “special ability.”\nThey didn’t have a clear idea about the special abilities yet.\nWithout Gu Ning’s permission, Xiang Xu didn’t dare to say much nor took the initiative to teach them the basic knowledge about the crystal cores and their special abilities.\nWhereas, Gu Ning already had a clear idea of it from her conversation with Xiang Xu.\nSpecial abilities consisted of seven elements.\nGold, wood, water, fire, and earth, with the slightly more common speed and strength element as it seems.\nThe fireball which Yan Yu sent out was under the fire element.\n“I can sense that the fluctuations of her psychic power are very weak. The amount of psychic energy stored in her body was also limited, which was why it was consumed so quickly.” This was how Xiang Xu described it at that time.\nPsychic powers like Xiang Xu’s belong to the category of mutated special abilities.\nHumans manipulating powerful special abilities to fight was a picture that the present general populace couldn’t imagine at all.\nIn Xiang Xu’s description, it was as if Gu Ning was seeing a grand sweeping picture slowly revealing its mysterious veil in front of her.\nAlthough she could not see the whole picture clearly, Gu Ning’s blood was already boiling from it.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Alright now… time to arrange some terms:\n\n\nSpecial Abilities – General name for the different psychic powers.\n\n\nPsychic powers – Term for one’s supernatural power.\n\n\nPsychic energy – Term for one’s mana pool which fuelled the psychic power.\n\n\nCrystal core – Term for the coloured bead that was found in those evolved zombies, use to develop special abilities when consumed but chances are low.\n\n\nTransparent core – Term for the bead that was found in slightly evolved zombies, helps to replenish the psychic energy when depleted.\n\n\nElements – Classification of different types of psychic powers.\n\n\nWoots!

    "39": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-39/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter hearing the news brought by Gu Ning, Brother San was stunned for a long time.\nSuddenly, Brother San gave a painful cry. It turned out that half of the cigarette which he was holding on had burnt to the end and burned his finger.\n\n\n\nAfter throwing the cigarette away. Brother San stared at Gu Ning and asked: “Tell me again, what is the crystal core that grows out of the head of that zombie, which can give people supernatural powers after consuming it?”\n“Aka psychic powers.” Jia DaoZhang chipped in.\nBrother San subconsciously licked his dry lips: “Why does this sound so surreal?”\nGu Ning, however, didn’t give Brother San much time to react and said: “Brother San, by now everyone in the world who knows what the crystal cores are, should be on the move now. From now on, every minute we delay, chances are we’ll be a minute behind the rest……”\nAs soon as Brother San heard this, he stood up from the ground and spoke to the group of soldiers who had been dumbfounded: “Then what else is there to say? All of you, get your spirits up! Bring enough guns and ammo and we’ll leave in ten minutes!”\nBrother San continued: “Lin Kai, Wang Yang, Yang Bo, Zhang Feng, you four are responsible for staying behind. Protect Gu Ning’s parents.”\nThe excitement on Lin Kai and the three others’ faces was instantly washed off by a bucket of cold water, but they didn’t dare to disobey Brother San’s orders, so they only responded with a breathless voice: “Yes, Brother San.”\n“Don’t worry, we won’t forget about your share.” Zhang XiaoBai said comfortingly as he loaded bullets into his magazine. Zhang Yang was overjoyed, as he didn’t expect that Brother San would let him follow them instead of staying behind.\nGu Ning watched them busily preparing their guns and ammo and reminded: “Unless it’s necessary, we’d better not shoot so we won’t attract a larger horde of zombies. These guns are for emergencies only.”\nBrother San replied: “Don’t worry. We go out daily, we understand. These guns are for emergency uses, in case we encounter an opponent like that zombie dog which we were unable to handle, or when facing a horde of zombies then we would shoot. After all, firing once is one shot less, and we usually can’t afford to use them.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning nodded in relief as Brother San and the others’ experiences in killing zombies were no less than she had, so she was just overly worried.\nTen minutes later, the soldiers had all finished their reloading.\nTwo lines were formed.\nThe soldiers’ expressions were in a rare sight as they didn’t look as grave as they usually did when they went out to search for survivors, instead, the excitement and thrill on their faces couldn’t be concealed, their eyes even sparkled.\n“Brother San, can I say a few words?” Gu Ning suddenly asked.\nBrother San was stunned for a moment before replying: “Go on.”\nThen he gave up his spot for Gu Ning.\nThe soldiers all stared at her suspiciously, not being impatient, but with good-natured suspicion. After all, they all understood how important the news Gu Ning had brought to them was, and the fact that she had shared such important news with them for free was undoubtedly a very big favour. Thus, even those soldiers who had not dealt with Gu Ning before were looking at her with kindness in their eyes at this moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning’s gaze swept over the soldiers’ faces for a while before she spoke in a serious tone: “The whole world is evolving now, not only humans have gained this opportunity, but also zombies too, and those zombie animals are even more threatening than the usual zombies. I expect everyone not to be overwhelmed by the crystal core news, remain calm at all times, and to act in a way that will ensure the safety of your lives in all actions.”\nAfter this speech, the excitement on the soldiers’ faces faded a little. Indeed, what was on their minds now was to hunt for zombies with crystal cores as soon as possible. Moreover, if they kept this up, they would probably lose their usual vigilance. Gu Ning’s words were undoubtedly a bolt from the blue, bringing them back to their senses.\nBrother San also nodded at her words, his sharp gaze sweeping over the soldiers’ faces one by one before saying it solemnly: “Gu Ning is right, the crystal cores are important, but your little lives are even more important! I want the same number of men when we leave, and the same number of men when we return!” He paused and stared at the soldiers, as his tone tinged with a hint of sadness: “All of you here, are all that’s left of the Third Company. You all can’t let me, the commander of the Third Company, to just have the title but with an empty company.”\nThinking of those comrades who died on the road, or those who didn’t even break out of the unit, the excitement and anxiousness on the soldiers’ faces receded and turned into determination: “Yes! Company Commander!”\nBrother San did not correct their address and then gave a nod to Gu Ning, signalling that it was time to depart.\nBy this time, the children had already woken up, and when they saw that the soldiers were going out again, they all crowded around the window or the door and watched them with an anxious look.\nThe soldiers were very kind and patient in bidding their goodbye to them and coaxed them that they would bring back some good food as they returned.\nSuddenly, Gu Ning felt a small hand timidly shake hers and then quickly let it go. She was a little surprised as she looked down and saw a little girl who was even younger than Xiang Xu, probably only six or seven years old, looking up at her with a pair of deer-like glistering eyes. There was some curiosity in her eyes, mixed with admiration and a slight touch of timidity as if she was afraid Gu Ning would blame her. Gu Ning immediately felt her heart wrenched, and she couldn’t help but smile at her. The little girl froze for a moment, then flashed a big smile at Gu Ning.\nUntil she sat down in the truck, Gu Ning’s mind was still filled with the image of the sincere smile from that little face.\nThe twenty-three people, including Brother San plus Gu Ning, Jia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming, Xie YuHong, Huang MengYao, Xiang Xu, and Xiang Yu, were exactly thirty in total.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San was surprised at first that Gu Ning wanted to bring Xiang Xu with her, and he was even more amazed when he heard about Xiang Xu’s special ability.\nThirty people were divided into two teams.\nIn Gu Ning’s truck, there were Jia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming, Huang MengYao, Xie YuHong, Xiang Xu, Xiang Yi, Zhang Yang, Zhang XiaoBai, and four other soldiers. One of them was the soldier who stood guard with Zhang XiaoBai that day, called Shi Lei, which others referred to him as Stone. The other three soldiers were called Cai Yong, Tian Fei, and Hu GuangMing. In the other world, Gu Ning had met all of the Third Company, but right now, she could only pretend not to know them.\nThe other truck was led by Brother San, who drove ahead to open the path.\nEach of the two vehicles was issued with a walkie-talkie to maintain communication at all times, with an effective range of up to a kilometer.\nBrother San was at first surprised by the extra little girl beside Gu Ning, and even more so after learning of Xiang Xu’s psychic powers.\nMeanwhile, Xiang Xu, at the same time as the truck made its way out of the gates of the colony, her spiritual power had already spread out silently. It covered a 500-meter area, centred on this military truck, monitoring it at all times.\nAfter introducing themselves briefly to each other, the soldiers began to take out the food they had brought with them.\nPerhaps because they were trying to save a mouthful of food for the children, their lunch was pitifully small, just a small piece of bread. They also took the initiative to ask Gu Ning and the others if they had eaten, and only after receiving an affirmative answer, then did they start eating. Apart from Zhang Yang, who was a bit short and had a thin figure, and Zhang XiaoBai who was also slim, the others were all on the buffer size, so one could imagine that this small piece of bread will not be enough to fill them up at all.\nGu Ning silently took out a small bag of supplies from her backpack, which contained some chocolate, sausages, and bread. Gu Ning handed the bag to Zhang Yang, then said: “Go share it. We can’t go to war on a hungry stomach.”\nThe soldiers refused while swallowing their drool, but in the end, they were each given enough supplies to fill the meal under Gu Ning’s insistence.\nYet none of them allowed themselves to be fed fully, and after a very restrained and half-full meal, they put away the rest of their supplies.\nAt this time, both Jia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming, Xie YuHong, Huang MengYao, and the newly joined Xiang Xu and Xiang Yi, watched this scene and were a little emotional. They had also gone through this period and were even worse off than them when they couldn’t find any food. Therefore, they were all even more thankful that they were with Gu Ning now. Gu Ning always had a way to get some supplies as long as she got out of the gate of the colony. Although the amount wasn’t a lot, it was enough to drive the people crazy in this post-apocalyptic world.\nAt this moment, they knew in their hearts beyond doubt that if this time, they failed in developing their powers, they would end up parting their ways with Gu Ning. Thinking that they might go back to the old days when they had to fight for their life just for a mouthful of food, Jia DaoZhang made up his mind that he would show his valor no matter what, even if couldn’t develop his powers.\nFor a while, everyone in the carriage carried different thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn the contrary, Xiang Xu, who had been fully acknowledged by Gu Ning, as well as the freebie Xiang Yi were in a relatively more relaxed mood at this time.\nXiang Xu, who had been sitting quietly beside Gu Ning, suddenly spoke: “Five cars are coming out of the colony. They’re trailing behind us in this direction.”\nGu Ning immediately guessed that it should be Bai Lang’s group who had received news from Pei Jing. Perhaps there was also Pei Jing and Yan Yu’s group.\nGu Ning had a few worries, if both parties were taking the same route and both had the same purpose, it was only inevitable that there would be a clash once they met. Bai Lang had a lot more men on their side, and there was an unknown number of special abilities users. Although they were all better marksmen, Gu Ning did not want a gunfight to break out as a last resort, and there was also Yin Sang who Gu Ning was worried about. Thus, if a conflict broke out, their side would suffer instead.\n“Do you know how many special abilities users are among them?” Gu Ning asked.\n“Nope.” Xiang Xu replied honestly: “My current ability can only monitor the fluctuations of their psychic powers when they use them…… they are speeding up.” Xiang Xu suddenly said.\nGu Ning picked up the walkie-talkie, this was the first time she had ever used it, and asked Zhang Yang, who was sitting opposite her, for advice before she began to speak to Brother San through the walkie-talkie. She informed Brother San that Bai Lang had also left the colony and were on the same route appropriately as she voiced out her concerns.\nOn the contrary, Brother San’s response was very calm: “We will each do our own thing and will not get in each other’s way. You don’t have to worry too much.”\nGu Ning obviously wasn’t any less wary because of Brother San’s calmness. After all, that man Bai Lang, after just meeting him once, Gu Ning knew that he was a difficult man to deal with. Even if they were willing to take a step back, there was no way they could retreat again and again.\nYet Bai Lang, on the other hand, was the kind of person who had gained an advantage and would still ask for more.\nThey acted much more anxious than Gu Ning, and in less than five minutes, five cars came roaring from behind the military truck, then quickly overtook them and drove on.\nThere were no words exchanged in the carriage. Everyone except Gu Ning and Xiang Xu had a little anxiety shown on their faces, the difference between arriving early and late was huge.\nGu Ning had calmed down this time. What she feared was that Bai Lang would hang behind them and wait to reap the benefits, but now that they were rushing forward so impatiently had calmed her down. After all, they had Xiang Xu, a human radar, which still gave them an advantage.\nAs the two military trucks continued to drive on at an unhurried pace, driving beyond the clearing area of the colony, they gradually began to encounter some collisions as the truck rose and fell. The four wheels coursing over the corpses on the ground, with intestines and blood bursting out all over the place.\nHalf an hour later, the two trucks were parked in a secure area that had passed Xiang Xu’s radar.\nThe location was near the edge of the downtown area, and three or four blocks beyond was the Eleven Square and the pedestrian street adjacent to it. That was also where Gu Ning had planned to go after their evolution, but currently, for them, it was the most dangerous place in the world.\nUnsure if that was an illusion or not, but Gu Ning could even feel the dangerous aura coming from over there.\nAfter getting out of the truck, the people from both trucks gathered.\nIt was currently 1:30 pm and at the rate, the sun was setting now, it would be dark by five o’clock, so they didn’t have much time left.\nTo complete this mission as quickly as possible, they had to be divided into two teams.\nBrother San wore a very old-fashioned metal watch, and after the two teams matched their watches, they set a time that whatever happened, they had to be here at half-past four. Also to always report the situation through the walkie-talkie.\nBrother San spoke: “If we don’t make it back in time, you guys just take one truck and go, don’t ever wait for us.”\nGu Ning nodded, then replied: “Same.”\nThen the two teams hurriedly bid their goodbye and headed in two separate directions.\nWhat would happen ahead, what dangers awaited for them, they knew nothing from this point onwards, and all they could do was to move forward.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Next few chapters will be intense and interesting =) So do stay tuned!

Her right hand gripped on her long knife tightly, her eyes, nose, ears and even her pores were all opened wide, sensing all the possible changes around them and the danger that came along with the changes.\nThe others were being vigilant without being influenced by Gu Ning’s tense mood.\n\n\n\nIn a group of thirteen, everyone was quiet. There wasn’t a single soul standing on the road, and within a few steps, you would see a decomposing, sun-dried corpse, men, women, and children of all shapes and sizes, lying in a heap on the road. The silence was a little frightening, with only the occasional breeze blowing by and the trees on both sides of the road rustling, accompanied by the sound of footsteps on the ground, inexplicably making people feel a little palpitated. The whole city seemed like an empty city, yet it was as if countless eyes were standing on the higher ground and watching them indifferently.\n“Here it comes.” Xiang Xu, who had been quiet, spat out those three words.\nThen the group of thirteen people instantly tensed up and clutched hard on the knives in their hands at the same time.\nThen they heard Gu Ning’s calm voice asking: “Which direction?”\nXiang Xu replied: “There are more than ten zombies from the west, heading to us very slowly, it will take at least five minutes to get here. Two blocks from the east, three zombies are coming this way —— and very fast!”\nGu Ning shouted: “Xiang Yi, Cheng Ming, you two protect Xiang Xu! Everyone else gets ready!”\nThe moment the sentences ended, three zombies came barrelling out from the direction leading east, these three zombies were so fast that they were almost faster than an ordinary person running furiously! They burst out of an alleyway entrance from the east and gave little time for others to react before it came straight in this direction.\nApart from Gu Ning, it was the first time that everyone else had seen a running zombie, plus that running speed was so fast, that the rest, all were horrified for a moment. Gu Ning was also afraid, she was the one who feared death the most, but the more afraid she was, the more she understood how weak she was now. Since she was weak, she had to become stronger, and since she wanted to become stronger, she had to first cast her fear aside.\nTherefore, she gripped the knife in her hand tightly and was the first to rush towards the zombie running at the front of the pack.\nShe hadn’t learned any fighting techniques, and she had no moves, just survival instincts after countless life and death experiences beneath the open, bloody mouth of the zombie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFacing head-on, she crouched, dodging the zombie’s grasping hand, then swung her knife towards the back of the zombie’s head!\nThe moment Gu Ning rushed past, the rest who had gone into a brief physical stiffness out of shock, finally reacted. Everyone else rushed forward apart from the two of them, Xiang Yi and Cheng Ming, who had been asked by Gu Ning to guard Xiang Xu’s safety.\n“Let me handle it!” Suddenly all that could be heard was a shout.\nEveryone else was taken aback, just to see that Jia DaoZhang in his Daoist robes rushing all the way to the front and charging towards the zombie.\nSeveral soldiers praised him in their hearts for his bravery.\nCheng Ming, who had been with Jia DaoZhang for the longest time, was surprised. In the past, if Jia DaoZhang saw a zombie, his first reaction was to run away, even if he couldn’t escape, he would hide behind a group of people and never had he taken the lead like this. Cheng Ming was a little puzzled by the sudden bravery of Jia DaoZhang.\nHowever, after running for a few steps, Jia DaoZhang stumbled on a corpse on the ground with its arms stretched out, and then he stumbled and fell to his knees, with his hands on the ground, looking like a mess.\n(T/N: Omg… hahahaha)\nThe rest who followed behind him were all stunned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEven though this was a tense moment, Cheng Ming stifled his laughter and picked up Jia DaoZhang with one hand, and dragged him towards Xiang Xu.\nJia DaoZhang spoke repeatedly: “Accident, this is an accident!”\nAlthough the zombie was very fast, it wasn’t intelligent. Gu Ning took care of one of them without much effort, and with a glance at the crowd that was beating up the remaining two zombies. Gu Ning started to crack open the zombie’s skull with confidence, and what she dug out was a transparent core.\nGu Ning was slightly disappointed and she wiped the mucus on the core with the clothes on that zombie before throwing it to Xiang Xu.\nThe other two zombies were also taken care of by their mobbing, but to their surprise, one of them was a blue crystal core.\nBefore they arrived here, Gu Ning and Brother San had already reached an agreement that the crystal core would belong to whoever killed the zombie.\nHowever, that particular zombie was killed by everyone’s slashes, and they didn’t know how to split this crystal core, so they gave it to Gu Ning in the end, for her to distribute it when they returned.\nGu Ning turned it over to Xiang Xu and told her to keep it safe.\nThe next step was to move on, avoiding a small group of over a hundred zombies coming from the other side and facing off with the twenty zombies head-on instead. Fortunately or unfortunately, they were all ordinary zombies with a stiff gait and were slightly easier to tackle down.\nGu Ning pulled the female zombie’s hair and yanked it hard! The zombie was dragged to the ground, and the small dagger in her left hand stabbed into its eye socket. Gu Ning rolled on the ground, bent her knee, and swung her long knife, cutting off the zombie’s legs at the knee. As the zombie fell to the ground with a howl of pain, Gu Ning slashed off its head, then stood up and charged towards a smaller zombie!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe skinny zombie was also dashing towards Gu Ning.\nGu Ning didn’t use any fancy moves, she just aimed her knife at the zombie’s head and slashed! The zombie reached forward with both hands and grabbed the knife, and Gu Ning couldn’t retrieve it back with a jerk! She was slightly shocked, seeing that it was sluggish, she thought it was an ordinary zombie and didn’t expect it to be so strong. However, Gu Ning’s strength was not weak either, and with a stronger jerk, she managed to pull the knife out of the zombie’s palm. The zombie’s greenish-grey palm was cut and flesh rolled out, but it continued to lunge towards Gu Ning by instinct!\nGu Ning didn’t panic, her face was as calm as the surface of the water without a single ripple. She just clutched the knife in her hand and slashed towards the zombie again as if it was a piece of firewood! This time she used her full strength and didn’t give the zombie another chance to block. The knife slid down between the zombie’s palms and cut directly onto the top of its head. Gu Ning felt that this head was a little harder to cut through than the rest of the ordinary zombies which she had sliced before. However, it was just a little tougher. The knife had cut through too many zombies and was no longer that sharp and even had some curled edges. But under Gu Ning’s strange monstrous strength, the curled edge of the knife sliced down from the top of the zombie’s head without any hindrance and with a puff —— the head split into two.\nThe blue-tinted bead rolled straight out as the zombie fell to the ground.\nGu Ning picked it up and kept it in her pocket.\nThen she walked towards the other zombie.\nXiang Yi drew out the knife which he had plunged into the zombie’s eye socket but didn’t miss the performance that Gu Ning had just made, and couldn’t help being speechless.\nThe most difficult strength-type zombie had been dealt with by Gu Ning, so the other ordinary zombies were easily settled. Also, Zhang XiaoBai’s performance was actually very bright, he looks fair and clean, even with a knife in his hand he looked very civilised. Yet, he was the one who killed the zombies the fastest besides Gu Ning, not to mention Gu Ning also knew that his marksmanship was also the best among the Third Company.\nIn contrast, Huang MengYao was struggling. Although she had killed zombies previously, when faced with these terrifying-looking zombies again, she couldn’t help but feel frightened. Her hand gripping the knife was white from the pressure, and her face was as white as paper. She had thought that she had conquered her fear that day by killing a zombie, but how could a true fear be conquered so easily? She thought of this and couldn’t help but glance in Gu Ning’s direction. Gu Ning was kicking a zombie to the ground, then without hesitation, she added a stab to the zombie’s face, then drew back her knife and stood up to look for another target.\nPerhaps she had noticed Huang MengYao’s gaze and turned her head towards her.  Huang MengYao’s eyes trembled slightly, as if she was a little afraid of Gu Ning’s gaze, as she expected to see disappointment or harshness in Gu Ning’s eyes. However, those pale eyes just glanced at her faintly, without any extra emotion, no disappointment, nor harshness, not even anything. Just a glance, and then she turned away, never looking back again.\nWith just this one glance, Huang MengYao had come to her senses. No matter how much she tried to take care of Gu Ning’s parents, she couldn’t get a bit of goodwill from her. She knew with unmistakable clarity at this moment that if she couldn’t meet Gu Ning’s expectations today, then probably when she returned, she would have to move out of the dormitory……\nAt the thought of this possibility, Huang MengYao only felt an instant chill all over her body, then she dragged her feet with difficulty towards the nearest zombie……\nTwo battles in a row, both of which ended without a hitch. Two coloured crystal cores were obtained and so far so good. If they kept up this pace, they didn’t have to wait till 4.30 pm and could return earlier. At this thought, everyone’s tense nerves couldn’t help but relax a little.\nGu Ning, however, didn’t relax at all.\nAfter a short rest, the group continued to move forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn the silence of the advance, the walkie-talkie rang abruptly, and an urgent voice came out of it. The owner of the voice seemed to be running and sounded very urgent and tensed: “Gu Ning! We’ve crashed into a zombie nest!”\nWith just such a short sentence, the intercom fell silent once again.\nZhang XiaoBai’s face went pale: “It’s Luo Long……”\nIt was self-evident what Luo Long’s words represented.\nImmediately afterward, Gu Ning vaguely heard the sound of gunshots in the distance ——\nThe expressions of all thirteen people suddenly changed.\nUnless it was an emergency, or they wouldn’t use their guns. This was what Brother San had explained. Thus, they could imagine what kind of critical situation was going on over there.\nZhang XiaoBai yelled into the intercom: “Luo Long! Where are you guys now? Do you need support?”\nHowever, the intercom fell completely silent, no more messages came through.\nThe faces of several soldiers went pale.\nZhang XiaoBai held on to the walkie-talkie for a long time, only to feel that his whole body was enveloped in great fear. He couldn’t help but glance at Gu Ning, several soldiers were also looking at Gu Ning. They wanted to go over to provide support, although they didn’t know the exact details, they still understood that it must be very frightening. Yet they didn’t know how to ask Gu Ning to go with them…… before they could muster up the courage, they heard Gu Ning say: “Let’s go.”\nSeveral soldiers as well as Cheng Ming and the rest were stunned and stared at Gu Ning, not knowing which direction she meant.\n“It’s not even four-thirty yet. Let’s go and meet up with them.” With those words, Gu Ning took the lead in walking in the direction of the other side, and as she did so, she started sprinting.\nCheng Ming and the rest were a little stunned, then reacted, all followed Gu Ning and ran. Several soldiers’ expressions were a little startled. They didn’t expect that under such circumstances, Gu Ning was still willing to go back…… and thus, their hearts were all filled with gratitude.\nThe team of thirteen people quickly ran in the direction of the gunfire.\n“Xiang Xu! I need to know where Brother San and the others are as soon as possible.” Gu Ning shouted to Xiang Xu in a cold voice as she ran.\n“Okay!” Xiang Xu concentrated on her spiritual energy, which was scattered in a web-like pattern in a spot, before spreading it out like tentacles in a hurry towards the direction where the sound of gunshots had rung out.\nHowever, their rescue did not go smoothly.\nHalfway there, they encountered a small wave of zombies.\nGu Ning was worried about the safety of Brother San, so she no longer hold back and pulled out the small dagger from her waist and shot it directly at the first zombie that came running! Gu Ning’s technique was extremely accurate, and with her strong strength, the knife was nailed directly into the brow of the zombie! Before the zombie fell to the ground, Gu Ning had already rushed to its front, directly pulled out her knife, and then slashed the long knife in her right hand towards the left side of a zombie between the waist and stomach. She blocked the zombie and then stepped on its body and leaped up to throw a kick to its chest! The kick sent the zombie flying, knocking away several zombies that were right behind it! Zhang XiaoBai was so shocked by Gu Ning’s kick that he was speechless, but he didn’t stay stunned for too long and quickly reacted to it. He finished off several zombies that tried to approach Gu Ning while she was making double stabs to make sure all zombies were dead.\nJia DaoZhang finally found a method of combat that suited him, his weapon was an axe, and while Xiang Yi was attracting the zombies head-on, he went around to the back of the zombie and chopped open the zombie head with a stroke.\nXiang Yi, however, said discontentedly: “Godd*mmit! Why are you snatching it from me? Is this yours or mine?”\nIn response to such a disrespectful address from Xiang Yi, Jia DaoZhang wasn’t angry at all. He pulled the axe out of the back of the zombie’s head and laughed: “Fifty-fifty! Let’s split it in half! Don’t you see that the both of us worked well together?!”\nXiang Yi grunted but did not retort.\nThey were centred on Xiang Xu, and their main function was defence. From time to time, Gu Ning would purposely release a few zombies over for them to help out with, which helped to reduce a lot of the pressure off the front line.\nWhen the last zombie had its head cut off by Gu Ning, falling to the ground with a thud, the place was quiet again and they realised that the gunfire that was coming vaguely from the other side had stopped at some point……\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Omg Brother San!

    "41": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-41/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn the dimly lit room, the soldiers, who had finally shaken off the zombies, for the time being, let out violent gasps as they leaned against the wall to catch their breath. They were exhausted and their physical endurance had reached the limit, but even though their bodies were close to a state of exhaustion, they did not dare to completely let their guard down. The guns in their hands were still in guarding position and were kept on standby for another round of combat.\nAfter Zhong Xu counted the number of people, his sweaty face turned a little pale: “Wu Qiang, Chen Yao, and Zhang ZhiLin didn’t follow up.”\n\n\n\nThere was a collective silence among the soldiers, who all knew what would happen to them if they didn’t follow up in that situation just now.\nBrother San wiped a handful of hot sweat from his head and suppressed the grief in his eyes before saying: “Pass me the walkie-talkie and I’ll have a word with Gu Ning.”\nThe soldiers rummage through their pockets and finally only Luo Long handed it over.\nBrother San took it, turned on the switch, and was just about to speak into the intercom when the red light above the intercom flashed twice before it went out.\n“What the hell?!”\nLuo Long replied with a pale face: “It’s out of power.”\nOnce again there was silence in the room.\nBrother San looked like he wanted to curse, his mouth opened and closed, but in the end, he didn’t curse it out and asked instead: “How many ammo are left?”\n“Too many were consumed earlier, there aren’t many left, around 30 to 40 bullets left for each man.” Zhong Xu replied.\nThinking about the vicious battle that had just taken place, the soldiers in the room were a little shaken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhong Xu continued: “If we were to break out now, I’m afraid we would only be able to get past halfway before we would be flooded by the zombies.”\nThey were chased by the zombies to Eleven Square, which was downtown, and it took a lot of effort to kill their way out and hide in the basement of Eleven Square. It’s not a basement but was actually a public toilet, which was so shabby that an old man used to live down here in the old days.\nDown the stairs from the ground floor was a long “living room” with a table and a few stools. A cramped room was the bedroom and next was the crude public toilet, which cost fifty cents for a visit, plus another fifty cents for a tissue. The old man who was supposed to guard the public toilet was nowhere to be found. However, other people were occupying the place before Brother San and the others came in.\nThe banging on the door slowly stopped and the soldiers couldn’t help but sigh in relief, relaxing their tense muscles a little and immediately a wave of soreness and numbness spread throughout their bodies.\nThe room was very dimly lit, with only a half-burned candle lit on the table as the only light source in the room. This made the faces of the people in the room look slightly gloomy.\n“Is there anything to eat?” A man who still looked very handsome despite his wretched clothes, suddenly asked, with a slightly bitter smile on his face: “We’ve been stuck here for a day and haven’t eaten anything at all.”\nThere were six of them in total, three men and three women, and perhaps they had been starving for a long time, none of them seem to be in good spirits. At this moment, when they heard the man’s words, all five pairs of eyes immediately forgot about their past and stared at the soldiers with hopeful gazes.\nThe soldiers recalled that in the moment of crisis, these people had opened the door for them, otherwise they might be trapped outside. Reluctantly, they clutched on the supplies they had kept in their pocket, and then they parted out a small portion and placed them on the table. Luo Long took another bottle of mineral water out of his backpack and placed it next to the supplies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe man distributed the little supplies to the rest and then said gratefully: “Thank you.”\nHe ate a few biscuits to ease his stomach, which was throbbing with hunger, a sip of water and handed it to the pretty girl next to him, then stared at Brother San and asked tentatively: “I think I heard you guys mention a name earlier. Do you guys know Gu Ning?”\nBrother San froze for a moment, shot a glance at the man, then asked with some surprise: “What? You know her too?”\nIf Gu Ning was here, she would have been able to recognize the young man who was speaking, was actually Lu JiaZi. In the other two men and three women, one was her uncle Jiang YueZhou and among the three women were Jiang Yu and that aunt of hers.\nLu JiaZi’s gaze flickered slightly, not knowing what kind of thoughts flashed through him in that instant before a small smile appeared on his face and he replied: “We know her. This is her uncle’s family.”\n“Oh?” Brother San was stunned and took a better look at Jiang YueZhou with the candlelight, and Jiang YueZhou did look slightly alike with Gu Ning.\nHearing that they were Gu Ning’s relatives, the soldiers, who were still a bit tensed, all relaxed slightly and Luo Long even smiled and said: “That’s a coincidence. If we managed to get out alive, you can follow us back to the colony. Gu Ning is there with her parents.”\nAt these words, Jiang YueZhou, who had not spoken, became excited: “Sister and brother-in-law are still alive?!”\nLuo Long smiled: “Don’t worry, they are all quite well.”\nSuddenly Lin MeiFeng interjected grimly: “They’re getting better, but we’re getting screwed over by that d*mn girl Gu Ning.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Mum!” Jiang Yu gave her a disapproving tug.\nThe atmosphere in the room, which had been friendly, changed dramatically and the soldiers all had strange expressions.\nLuo Long and Zhong Xu looked at each other and both felt that something was off, so they put away their smiling faces and stopped talking.\nBrother San glanced down at his watch, the time read 3:30 pm, only an hour left before their appointment with Gu Ning. He was looking forward to Gu Ning’s support but at the same time hoping that Gu Ning would not come for them.\nHe was looking forward to her arrival, naturally, because it would be difficult for the few of them with little ammo to break out of here. At the same time, he hoped that she won’t come because he was worried about the safety of Gu Ning’s party.\nMost of the soldiers in the room also had the same thought as Brother San.\nSubconsciously, they all thought that Gu Ning and the others would not come for them. After all, they didn’t have such a deep bond with them yet.\nThinking about this, all the soldiers’ moods lowered.\nThe soldier who had finished checking the situation above came down from the stairs and shook his head at Brother San: “There are too many zombies in the square, at least several hundred. We don’t have enough ammo to make it through there.”\n“Get all your stuff out.” Brother San suddenly said.\nThen all the soldiers took out all the crystal cores they had hunted. The encounter with the zombie swarm had taken a terrible toll, but it was still rewarding.\nJust about everyone collected several of them.\nHowever, there were only four with colour.\nThey were red, yellow, gold, and blue.\nAfter washing it with water, all the brain pulp on the crystal core was washed away and it looked crystal clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San picked up a yellow crystal core and sighed: “It’s amazing that such a pretty thing can grow out of a zombie’s brain.” With those words, he popped the crystal core into his mouth as the soldiers looked on nervously. It melted almost instantly in his mouth and flowed down his throat like a cold stream of water. Brother San’s expression was a little strange before he continued: “Gu Ning said that after eating it, I would faint, so you guys should hold still and see how it goes. If I wake up, you guys can eat it. If I turn into a zombie, you guys shouldn’t hesitate and just end me.” Almost immediately as his words hit the ground, Brother San collapsed to the floor in a crooked manner without any warning.\nHe was caught by the swift Zhong Xu.\nAlthough the soldiers were prepared, such an unpredictable fainting spell still caused some panic among the soldiers as they hurriedly carried Brother San into the small bedroom.\nThey were all discussing in a huddle just now, and their voices were lowered so that Lu JiaZi and the others won’t be able to hear them.\nLu JiaZi and the others were also shocked when Brother San collapsed out of the blue.\n“Is he okay?” Lu JiaZi asked with concern.\nLuo Long replied curtly: “Yes.”\nThen there was silence.\nLu JiaZi knew very well that their sudden indifferent attitude was due to that one sentence, so he gave Lin MeiFeng a disgruntled glance.\nInstead of being aggressive in front of Lu JiaZi, Lin MeiFeng was rarely polite but her expression was a little sarcastic.\nHalf an hour had passed.\nZou Ming shone a small torch on Brother San’s face in the darkness and said with some uneasiness: “Brother San won’t turn into a zombie, will he?”\n“If he does, then you’ll be the one to do it.” Zhong Xu replied.\nZou Ming rebut: “If you couldn’t bear to end him, then as if I could?”\nFiercely! Brother San, who had been lying on the bed, suddenly sat upright and straight.\nThe two men were not prepared in the slightest and were instantly taken aback. Zou Ming’s originally tense nerves were instantly shattered and he subconsciously stabbed with his knife!\nYet, before the knife could stab on Brother San’s chest, it hit something very sturdy.\nBrother San cursed: “I haven’t even turned into a zombie, and you’ve come to stab me!”\n“Brother San, are you alright?” Zou Ming was scared out of his wits. When he shone his small torch, he saw that Brother San was holding a brick in his hand, which he had just stabbed on it. He was surprised and asked: “Where did you get that brick, Brother San?”\nBefore he finished his sentence, his voice stopped abruptly.\nZou Ming, Zhong Xu, and the soldiers who had all rushed in at the sound of the commotion were all frozen in their tracks.\nLooking at the palm-length earth spike suspended in the air in front of Brother San, Zhong Xu didn’t know whether he was excited or nervous, and couldn’t help but tremble slightly: “Brother San, you, you’ve succeeded!”\nBrother San nodded with a smile.\nThe soldiers were instantly speechless with excitement.\nZou Ming looked at the earth spikes suspended in the mid-air with amazement: “It’s like a magic trick!”\n“What magic trick, this is psychic power! Psychic power alright?”\nZhong Xu gave a gesture to the excited Brother San, indicating that he should not be overly excited and should keep a low profile. Then he carefully took the earth spike that was suspended in mid-air. Holding it in his hand, he felt its weight and coarse appearance before he believed it to be real and was in a very indescribable mood.\n“It’s kind of sharp.” A soldier curiously poked his finger at the tip of the spike before concluding.\n“Not only is it sharp, but it can also stab others to death.”\nThe smugness implied in Brother San’s remark made everyone smile.\nOutside of the small room, Lu JiaZi and the others saw the soldiers crowded into that bedroom. Not knowing what kind of secret activities they were engaging in, they could only hear occasional small sounds coming from the room, but none of them could hear it clearly.\nThis group of people seems to have an unusual relationship with Gu Ning, otherwise, they wouldn’t have immediately changed their attitude coldly because of that specific sentence from Lin MeiFeng.\nFrowning slightly, he stared at Lin MeiFeng for a few moments.\nAs if sensing his displeasure, Jiang Yu tugged at his clothes and pouted: “Come on, JiaZi, my mom didn’t mean it either.”\nLu JiaZi glanced at Jiang Yu’s pretty face and, for some reason, he felt a little impatient.\nThe soldiers spoke excitedly for a while, then their attention was focused on the next three crystal cores.\n“Let’s give it to Zhong Xu, Zou Ming, and Luo Long.” A soldier took the initiative and suggested: “They’ve killed the most zombies.”\nThe other soldiers agreed.\nZhong Xu, Zou Ming, and Luo Long were embarrassed instead, stating that they could defend themselves and would rather give it to others.\nAs Brother San watched the soldiers pushing it around, he felt a bit relieved. Although the world was now full of zombies and corrupted human hearts, at least the soldiers under his command were not corrupted. Yet of course, what he thought in his heart was a thing and what he shows was another, so Brother San said impatiently: “*Kong Rong shares the pears?! What’s the problem? There are so many zombies out there, the ground is full of crystal cores, Zou Ming, Zhong Xu, and Luo Long, the three of you just eat these. When trying to break out of here, the three of you should give all your best and bring the rest out without losing a single one of them!”\n(T/N: 孔融让梨kǒng róng ràng lí is an idiom that means to be polite and respect others/ thoughtfulness.)\n“Yes, Company Commander!”\nWith that said, Zhong Xu, Zou Ming, and Luo Long took a crystal core each after responding, glanced at each other before swallowing it amidst the remaining soldiers’ hopeful gazes.\nOn the other hand, Gu Ning’s group had not given up looking for traces of Brother San’s group.\nThere were dozens of zombies’ corpses lying on the ground and bullet casings everywhere, so everyone could imagine that a vicious battle had taken place here. Also, there was no sign of fire passing through the place, so it should be Brother San and the others.\nSome of the corpses’ heads had been cracked open, so someone had obviously dug out the crystal cores. However, because of the rush, there were still many zombie heads intact. Apart from Xiang Xu, everyone else turned “ferocious” and dug through one zombie at a time with their pocket knives, almost like scrounging for a bargain.\n“It’s Wu Qiang!” Zhang XiaoBai suddenly let out an alarming cry. Then he quickly ran in one direction and flipped Wu Qiang, who was lying there, onto his back.\nBefore Zhang XiaoBai could check if Wu Qiang was still alive, he saw Wu Qiang’s tightly closed eyes snap open, with red veins swimming in them —— and then Wu Qiang grabbed Zhang XiaoBai’s head with his mouth wide open and went for his face!\nZhang XiaoBai was so shocked that he couldn’t dodge for that moment!\nWhen he saw that the big mouth was about to bite him, all that was heard was a “Ptff——“, the sound of a knife entering the flesh, and then Zhang XiaoBai saw a small knife stuck in Wu Qiang’s forehead. Wu Qiang’s eyes were wide open and he was dead. Gu Ning walked over and pulled the knife out, and there was a stream of grey-blackish pulp running down the forehead —— “Next time, you won’t be so lucky.”\nWhen Zhang XiaoBai heard Gu Ning’s words, he only felt a shiver run through his body. If it wasn’t for Gu Ning’s stab, he would probably be infected even if it was just a small scratch. Chills ran down his body at the thought, and he hurriedly pushed the body out of the way and scrambled to his feet.\nChecked all the remaining zombie heads.\nGu Ning glanced at Xiang Xu, who gave her a slight shake of her head, indicating that she didn’t find any trace of Brother San yet.\nAll of the sudden! Xiang Xu’s expression changed and she turned violently in the direction of the east, shouting in horror: “Run!”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hurray!

But please don’t follow the first sentence of this chapter hahaha XD )\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Run!”\nWith Xiang Xu’s horrified cry, Gu Ning reacted almost instantly as her sentence ended. She picked up Xiang Xu and pinned her into the crook of her arm before running crazily.\n\n\n\nThe others hadn’t reacted to the warning, but their subconscious thought was to follow Gu Ning closely, so once they saw Gu Ning running, the others immediately followed suit.\nZhang XiaoBai glanced back as he ran.\nHe saw a dozen or so people suddenly rushing out from the corner of the road behind them, frantically running towards their direction. He saw that the one running at the front was none other than Bai Lang! Following this, an uncountable number of zombies burst out from the corner behind them, surging like a wave and looking like it was about to drown all of them.\n“Quick! Run! The zombie swarm is coming!!!!” Zhang XiaoBai shouted, then sprang forward and gritted his teeth as he finally began to run crazily with desperation.\nAlthough Gu Ning was carrying Xiang Xu, she was still the fastest runner among them. Xiang Xu weighed at least several dozen pounds, but to Gu Ning, it wasn’t much of a burden. Xiang Xu was pinned in the crook of Gu Ning’s arm, tugging at Gu Ning’s clothes with a deadly grip, and her face paled when her spiritual energy sensed that those people were still following closely behind them.\nAs they ran, Jia DaoZhang cursed: “Those sons of the b*tch! Why can’t we get rid of them like some d*mn plaster?!”\nBai Lang, Pei Jing, and their party, who were a hundred metres away, were running towards them. They followed wherever Gu Ning turned, and even the zombies that were tagging behind were still chasing after them. It seems that they were determined to follow Gu Ning and the others till the end.\nGu Ning knew that this was not the solution, even if her stamina was strong enough to run all the way back to the colony, the others would not last much longer. After running for less than a kilometre, Jia DaoZhang was already turning pale as these weren’t brisk walking and jogging but were a flight for his dear life. Cheng Ming, Xie YuHong, and Huang MengYao were also gritting their teeth as they held on. The soldiers who usually did cross-country training and weight running practices were still able to hold on for a while. However, once it dragged and they reached their limit, they could only lie on the ground and let the zombies feed on them.\nAt this time, Gu Ning inevitably thought that if she was alone, she could just find a place to hide and enter her space. Then returned after the zombie swarm had dispersed so that she would be able to safely survive this crisis. Yet right now, she couldn’t do anything nor leave them alone and ran away for her life. Even though she wanted to do so, she just couldn’t bear it.\nGu Ning could only run while thinking of a better solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOut of the blue, Gu Ning suddenly heard a sound, and then she saw several ropes falling from the sky.\n“Quick, grab those ropes!”\nIt was from a building and the voices came from the second floor, where the ropes were hanging out from the second floor window sill. Several young men and women were standing by the window, shouting at them. It was them that had thrown those ropes down.\nGu Ning rushed closer and hesitated for only a split second before handing it to Xiang Xu and ordered: “Climb up!”\nXiang Xu hurriedly grabbed the thick rope and started climbing up with her arms and legs. The rope was tied with a lot of knots in between which helped one to climb easier. In addition to being in a life-and-death situation, Xiang Xu climbed very fast with her slender arms and legs.\nGu Ning glanced at Bai Lang and his group that was two hundred meters away, and the wave of zombies that were closely following them. Without hesitation, she grabbed the rope next to her then climbed upwards.\nFollowing closely behind were several soldiers and all of them scrambled up the ropes. They were well trained in this area and they had overtaken Xiang Xu who had climbed first. They climbed into the ledge in ten seconds or so and then reached out to pull Xiang Xu and Gu Ning in.\nGu Ning flipped in through the window sill, Xiang Yi tumbled in next, and then Cheng Ming, Xie YuHong, and even Huang MengYao managed to climb up while clenching their teeth. Only Jia DaoZhang was left. Gu Ning stretched out of the window sill to check out, only to see Jia DaoZhang struggling to climb up the rope. He had run for nearly 2km yet with his old age and lack of exercise, he had long stretched his physical endurance beyond the limits. His hands were shaking and his legs went weak, plus he was so exhausted that he couldn’t exert any more strength after climbing to the middle of the rope. Seeing that Bai Lang and the rest were about to reach him, Jia DaoZhang was in a burst of fear. He thought about those plots written in novels that stimulated ones’ great potential amidst the crisis, were all lies. All he felt right now was weakness in his hands and legs, his heart was beating so fast like it was about to explode. Also, he was so nervous as if he was about to develop asthma, yet none of his potentials was pushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Cheng Ming saw that Jia DaoZhang was stopped climbing, he shouted in anxiety: “Jia DaoZhang! Hurry up! The zombie swarm is coming!”\nXiang Yi also shouted to the bottom: “Get up here, god*mmit! It’s useless for you to stop there and chant Amitabha!”\nYet no matter how they shouted, Jia DaoZhang just remained there without moving.\nIf I could climb, wouldn’t I already climb?! Jia DaoZhang thought with sadness and anger in his heart, moreover, Amitabha Buddha was recited by a monk not him! However, he couldn’t utter a single word as his chest hurt so badly, and he had no time to argue with them. All the strength he had left for now was to hold onto the rope and prevent himself from falling.\nBai Lang and the others, who were still a hundred metres away, burst out their potentials as they had seen the hope of life. They rushed over in the blink of an eye, grabbing the other ropes and climbing upwards. As he watched each one of them climb up past him, Jia DaoZhang glanced back and saw that the zombies were about to reach him. Yet whenever he tried to exert some strength, his arms went numb and he couldn’t move a single bit. If it wasn’t for the fact that Jia DaoZhang wanted to leave a good impression in front of Gu Ning and the others, he was so afraid of death right now that he would have burst into tears.\nAs he listened to the urgent shouts from above, Jia DaoZhang thought sadly, was he going to die here today? If he had known that he was going to be torn apart by the zombies, he might as well have taken some medicine and passed away peacefully during the start of the apocalypse. At least he could still preserve his body as a whole.\nShould he let them know that if he falls down, they should give him a few shots to end his suffering from being bitten alive? Just when Jia DaoZhang was rambling on with his thoughts, a sudden calm voice came from overhead: “Hold on tight to the rope.”\nJia DaoZhang muttered in his heart that he had grabbed the rope as tight as possible, but his subconscious mind squeezed out the last bit of strength he had to grab hold the rope again.\nAfterward, he felt that he was rising ——\nJia DaoZhang couldn’t help but open his eyes in awe and glanced upwards, only to see Gu Ning tugging the rope upwards with both hands!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere was a sudden burst of joy in his heart!\nThe gush of joy didn’t even last for two seconds! Suddenly his whole body plunged downwards!\nThere was a shout of surprise from overhead!\nHe was so startled that the rope in his hand nearly slipped off, and he was so shocked that he couldn’t help but glance downward. It was a frightening sight, which almost scared the hell out of Jia DaoZhang. He saw that the end of the rope was being pulled by one of the zombies, and it was being jerked downward with such a great force. Next to him, some zombies were already trying to reach out and grab his feet.\nJia DaoZhang was so frightened that he hastily retracted his feet upwards and glanced up to see that Gu Ning who had just been holding onto the rope was being dragged down by the strong force unexpectedly. Her whole body was almost dragged out! Half of her body was jerked out of the window sill. Xiang Yi and Cheng Ming hurriedly came over and held onto Gu Ning by her waist to prevent her from being dragged out.\nGu Ning was tugging at this end and the zombie was tugging at the other end. Both of them refused to let go. What was even more horrifying was that the strength of that zombie seemed to be even greater than the strength-type zombie which Gu Ning had encountered previously, and this was even vaguely overpowering her. As she watched the rope slowly slip out of her hands, a little sweat seeped out of Gu Ning’s forehead, and Jia DaoZhang’s expression became more and more frightened. He was saving his strength to grab onto the rope tightly or else he would have been screaming. Gu Ning suddenly shouted at Jia DaoZhang: “Use all your strength to cling on the rope!”\nJia DaoZhang didn’t know what Gu Ning was trying to do but he subconsciously obeyed Gu Ning’s order and held on to the rope for his dear life. Fortunately, there were knots on the rope and his hand was gripping on top of the knots so that he wouldn’t fall off. Just as he had gotten a firm grip, he suddenly felt himself plunging downwards! Jia DaoZhang shrieked violently in fright, and when he looked up, it was Gu Ning who had loosened the rope. With this, he instantly fell back to where he had originally crawled to, only a few dozen centimetres away from those zombies’ outstretched hands! If he had fallen any lower, his legs would have been caught by the zombies! He felt the urge to pee and almost wet his trousers, which would have ruined his reputation.\nGu Ning turned around and sat on top of the window sill, then shouted to the two sturdiest soldiers: “Shi Lei! Cai Yong! Hold on to my calves!”\nShi Lei and Cai Yong didn’t know what Gu Ning was intending to do, but they obediently came forward and hugged Gu Ning’s calves.\n“Hold on tight! Don’t ever let go!” After Gu Ning solemnly instructed again, she took a deep breath before her entire body tumbled backward and out of the window sill! In one swift fall, her whole body was hanging upside down against the wall, outside of the window sill except her calves.\nEveryone else was so shocked by Gu Ning’s dangerous move that they were speechless and hurriedly leaned over to the window sill to check.\nCheng Ming, however, helped Shi Lei and Cai Yong to hold onto Gu Ning’s legs, afraid that they might not hold firm enough, and caused Gu Ning to fall, as his face turned pale with that thought.\nAfter Gu Ning hung out upside down, she reached out her hands and shouted at Jia DaoZhang: “Quick! Grab onto me!”\nJia DaoZhang was looking nervously at the zombie below in fear that they would jump up and grab his legs. When he heard the shout, he glanced up and saw Gu Ning hanging upside down on the window sill, stretching out her hands towards him. He was so shocked that he didn’t know what to do. Yet when staring into those eager eyes, Jia DaoZhang couldn’t tell what he felt in his heart, then he tried to reach out a hand to grab her hand, and the distance was just right! Gu Ning’s hand instantly grabbed Jia DaoZhang’s wrist, and his hand also clasped onto Gu Ning’s wrist. Feeling the strength of Gu Ning’s hand, Jia DaoZhang’s heart calmed a little before he tried to reach his other hand to Gu Ning as well.\nBoth hands clasped together smoothly, and Jia DaoZhang’s heart burst with joy as Gu Ning exerted force in her abdomen and actually managed to yank Jia DaoZhang upward!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHowever, in his happiness, he had forgotten that there were still dozens of zombies reaching out for his legs underneath him. The moment he was yanked up by Gu Ning, he subconsciously relaxed his originally coiled legs down…… When his foot stood on a hard object, Jia DaoZhang even froze for a moment and subconsciously looked down and saw that the hard object under his foot was the top of a zombie’s head! He shrieked in terror and then quickly retracted his leg. However, he couldn’t move halfway, as a pair of hands were grabbing firmly on his calves!\nGu Ning’s body, which had already started to lift from the wall, was suddenly yanked by a force coming from her hands! She was caught off guard, as her back slammed back hard into the wall, and the moment her arched spine hit the hard wall, a muffled grunt of pain escaped Gu Ning’s lips.\nThe muffled grunt travelled into the window sill.\nThis startled everyone and shocked them.\nCheng Ming’s heart even trembled.\n“Gu Ning, are you alright?” Zhang XiaoBai asked anxiously. The others had worried expressions written on their faces.\nAlthough Gu Ning’s spine was in severe pain, she didn’t loosen her grip on Jia DaoZhang’s hand, nor did she respond to Zhang XiaoBai’s anxious questioning. She only increased her strength and fought against the zombies below who were dragging Jia DaoZhang’s legs.\nJia DaoZhang couldn’t help but tremble, not from fear, but some other kind of emotion.\nHe looked up at Gu Ning with guiltiness, emotions, and pleadings as his voice trembled slightly: “Gu Ning, let go of my hand.”\nGu Ning did not answer him, nor did she have any intention of letting go of her hand at this point. If she was going to let go of his hands, then she wouldn’t have tried to hang out of the window sill.\nSince she had already grabbed Jia DaoZhang’s hand, she would never let go of them unless those zombies yanked him out of her.\nThe zombies hissed with excitement and hunger, if only they could yank Jia DaoZhang off, they could eat fresh blood and flesh. The warm blood would nourish their parched throats, the fresh flesh would strengthen their bodies——\nNo one on the window ledge said anything as they looked at the hissing zombies below and felt a chill run down their spines. Shi Lei and Cai Yong pursed their lips and hugged Gu Ning’s little calves even tighter.\nGu Ning’s sweat ran down her forehead, dampening her golden hair, her body swaying as Jia DaoZhang was pulled from side to side while her back rubbed against the wall with burning friction. Her hands remained firmly clasped to Jia DaoZhang’s wrist as if it was embedded.\nSuddenly, the sound of a gun handle being pulled rang out.\nThis was followed by a gunshot——\nA bullet hole appeared in the head of the zombie that was tugging at Jia DaoZhang, and then it just fell back silently while being swamped by the zombies crowding behind it.\nGu Ning looked at the window sill in surprise, Bai Lang was poking out and it was him who had fired the shot.\nSensing Gu Ning’s gaze, a malicious smile crossed Bai Lang’s eyes before the gun shifted slightly and was aimed at Gu Ning. Gu Ning’s heart tightened, and then she noticed the malicious smile that crossed Bai Lang’s slanting eyes. Thus, she calmed down slightly and just stared at him quietly without feeling any annoyance.\nSeemingly a little bored by Gu Ning’s staring gaze, Bai Lang skimmed his lips and shifted his gun.\nSeveral gunshots followed.\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nOne by one, those zombies who had grabbed Jia DaoZhang’s legs fell. Without thinking about anything else, Jia DaoZhang tried his best and kicked away the zombie who had grabbed his ankle despite being dead. Immediately, he curled his legs up quickly which caused the zombies who were crowding behind him could only angrily stretch out their hands in mid-air waving.\nGu Ning felt the tugging force loosen, and let out a low bellow before exerting force on her abdomen once again. She sat up like doing a normal sit-up, except she was still pulling a hundred-plus pound person in her hand. The moment Gu Ning sat up, the rest of them poked out of the window sill from both sides. They grabbed onto Jia DaoZhang’s arms with force while helping Gu Ning to pull Jia DaoZhang upward.\nJia DaoZhang tumbled off the window ledge as if he was like a fish being thrown on the land and fell to the ground panting heavily.\nGu Ning was also helped by Zhang XiaoBai and Zhang Yang to rest against the wall on the ground. Previously, she didn’t feel the thrill, but right now when she was out of danger, her heart was beating strongly.\nWhile she was resting, she couldn’t help but glance at Bai Lang, nodding slightly in gratitude to the shots made by him. Thanking him for those shots, otherwise, she would still be dangling out there.\nHe was surrounded by Yin Sang and the man in the white shirt, as well as Pei Jing and the special abilities user Yan Yu, were also with them. There were only twelve or thirteen of them left in their group and Gu Ning didn’t even need to ask to understand that the others had been swamped by the zombies.\nOn the contrary, the few soldiers were a bit ashamed, as they were in a state of shock and panic and had not thought of a way to help Gu Ning. At this moment, they had mixed emotions towards Bai Lang.\nThe paralyzed Jia DaoZhang suddenly jumped up from the ground and stomped down towards the stairs.\nIt took everyone by surprise.\nIt was a while later before he came back up slowly, holding onto the railing, and said with a shameful look on his face: “Need to answer to the call of nature, the call of nature……” His legs were still trembling as he walked, but the previous energetic movement as he had gotten up from the ground had disappeared in a flash.\nGu Ning also stood up after she had rested enough.\nThey listened to the constant banging on the door of the zombies below and frowned slightly.\n“Don’t worry, we’ve blocked the door below, they’ll never be able to break in. They’ll go away once we climb higher as they can’t smell us.” One of the girls who had thrown down the ropes smiled, and when she smiled, two shallow dimples showed on her cheek and made her look much more approachable.\n“Well, all of you are safe for now, let’s go up.” One of the men replied, silently glancing at the guns they were holding. The other three looked at them with smiles, all looking very friendly and welcoming.\nGu Ning and Bai Lang glanced at each other before following those five people up the stairs.\n“Thank you guys for earlier.” The soldier said to the man in the lead.\n“You’re welcome. It’s the post-apocalyptic world, so of course, humans should help each other.” The man replied.\n“It’s been a long time since we’ve had newcomers.” The girl with dimples said and suddenly took Gu Ning by her arm and said: “You were awesome just now!”\nGu Ning smelled a sour odour, most likely it came from these people that had been trapped in here for too long and unable to wash up. Although Gu Ning didn’t like to be clung to by the arm, they were saved by them previously. Thus, Gu Ning didn’t want to be rude and just smiled while answering her question.\nIn between, they took small breaks as they walked.\nIt took more than ten minutes to get to where the hideout was.\nThe top seventh floor.\nTo their surprise, the group had quite a few companions.\nAt a cursory glance, there were 50 to 60 people in this large house, men, women, the elderly, and children.\nThe floor was littered with things to keep warm, and in some places, there were only a few thin quilts.\nSome were standing or sitting while the rest were still lying on the floor. Yet all eyes were directed at the twenty or so people in Gu Ning’s group. It was impossible to tell if they were alarmed by seeing a group of strangers or for some other reason, but all of them were so quiet that it gave chills to Gu Ning’s group.\nGu Ning glanced around the room, looking at those people, without any reason she felt that something was off somewhere. However, she couldn’t pinpoint what was wrong, yet there was a strange hunch she had in her heart and an inexplicable chill……\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sorry once again for the late update as works caught up hehehe.

    "43": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-43/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt was clear that the others didn’t find anything strange, and those things that seemed strange in the olden days, looked normal now after the apocalypse happened.\nThe dimpled girl seemed to see Gu Ning’s suspicions and said with a hint of embarrassment: “It’s been too long since we’ve had any newcomers here.”\n\n\n\n“You guys have been living here since the apocalypse started?” Gu Ning and her group were taken to a clean spot to sit down and rest, so she said it as a casual remark.\n“Hmm. At first, there were only a few people, then more and more joined, some stayed whereas some left. Now it’s just us here, and we’re all too tentative to venture out, so you’re very welcome to stay.” The dimpled girl said with a smile.\nZhang XiaoBai interjected curiously and asked: “There are so many of you, what do you guys eat?”\nThe dimples at the corners of the little girl’s mouth flattened slightly before deepening a little: “We do go out occasionally to find something to eat.”\nZhang XiaoBai continued: “There are so many zombies in this area, it’s pretty hard for you guys to find food right?”\nThe dimpled girl smiled before replying: “I see you’re all tired, so I’ll leave you guys to get some rest.”\n“Thank you.” Gu Ning thanked her once again.\n“You’re welcome. We’re actually the lucky ones to have you all here.” An extraordinarily genuine smile bloomed on the little girl’s face. Then she nodded to the others before turning around and walked away.\n“Why do I get the feeling that she seemed a bit angry just now? Did I say something wrong?” Zhang XiaoBai said sensitively.\nGu Ning’s gaze faintly focused upon his words, watching the little girl’s back in thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEveryone else was so tired that they found a little corner to rest or just lie down. Gu Ning’s group and Bai Lang’s side were naturally separated into two camps. Having just escaped from death, there was less hostility between them and each of them was just taking a break.\nThe others didn’t mind the subtle sweeping gazes too much and found it perfectly normal.\nOn the contrary, Gu Ning had that strange feeling that wouldn’t disappear.\nGu Ning was very tired and leaned against the wall to rest. Her muscles, which had been tense, relaxed a little, while her half-closed eyes were cautiously observing the situation in the room.\nPerhaps because those people had not been in the sun for too long, their skin was very pale, and they moved so slowly as if they were afraid of wasting their strength when they were walking or doing something. Also, they had a kind of sickly or dead-like look on them. What caught Gu Ning’s attention was the pile in the corner covered with a tarp, not revealing what was underneath it, the bulge looked kind of strange in shape.\nThe indescribable, seemingly sour odour always lingered in front of Gu Ning’s nose, mixed with an imperceptible hint of blood……\n“It’s a corpse……” Xiang Xu deliberately lowered her voice and whispered to Gu Ning as she looked down at her fingers, with her voice trembling slightly: “The thing covered in the corner, it’s a corpse……”\nGu Ning’s pupils shrank slightly as the man sitting in the corner suddenly glanced over and met Gu Ning’s gaze with a clear sense of caution and suspicion. Gu Ning’s expression was not the least bit flustered, she just faintly glanced at him then averted her gaze as if nothing had happened. Followed by looking at Xiang Xu with a smile on her face as she said a few words, and Xiang Xu also put on a smile in a very cooperative manner, as if Gu Ning had told her a joke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe man stared at Gu Ning for a moment and saw her joking with the little girl next to her. Making sure she hadn’t noticed anything before he turned his gaze away while he pressed the tarp which had buckled up a little at the edges uneasily.\nSuddenly Zhang XiaoBai asked curiously as he had overheard what Xiang Xu said: “A corpse? What corpse?”\nHe did not lower the volume of his voice, nor was it too loud, but at that moment, the room fell completely silent as soon as he had asked this—— Countless pairs of eyes glanced over and the few men sitting by the tarp looked at each other while their expressions slightly changed. The young men and women who were standing at the entrance whispering stopped and also glanced over in silence because of Zhang XiaoBai’s words.\nGu Ning sensitively felt the change in atmosphere and her heart thumped, but her expression remained the same as if she didn’t notice that Zhang XiaoBai had attracted so much hidden attention, so she glared at him before saying: “What are you yelling about? We’re talking about when you found Wu Qiang’s body, and I don’t know how Brother San had taught you when you just blindly rushed over. If it wasn’t for me who had reacted quickly, you would have turned into a zombie too by now.”Gu Ning seemed to be afraid of disturbing others, and her voice wasn’t too loud, yet it was clear enough to reach those people’s ears. However, Gu Ning could also clearly feel that those wary gazes didn’t disappear with just that statement.\nZhang XiaoBai was reprimanded by Gu Ning, but he was very ashamed and scratched his head and replied: “I was in a hurry…… and I’ll promise to be more careful next time.”\nWith his reply.\nGu Ning immediately felt those eyes staring at them disappear, and was relieved but her expressions still carried a hint of anger.\nXiang Xu had just been called out by Zhang XiaoBai and was almost so scared to the point of having a heart attack. Yet when she saw Gu Ning’s calm demeanour, and the way she had dispersed the crisis into nothing with just a few words suddenly made Xiang Xu feel so reassured.\nZhang XiaoBai, however, was reprimanded by Gu Ning and wilted away to find a corner to reflect.\nUnable to sense any more prying gazes, Gu Ning finally put her mind at ease and switched to wipe her knife with the corner of her coat, while her mind pondered another question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhose body did that belong to?  Why was it left in the corner instead of disposing of it away?\nMeanwhile, it was clear that the soldiers were worried about something else.\nZhang Yang stood up and looked out of the window into the distance and said worriedly: “I wonder how the Company Commander and the others are doing.”\nZhang XiaoBai replied: “They should be fine, Zhong Xu, Zou Ming, and the others who have good marksmanship are there, besides the Company Commander is not there for decoration either.”\nEven Zhang XiaoBai, who was always so optimistic, only dared to say that they should be fine instead of saying that they for sure, would be fine, as right now this was a comforting statement he gave to himself.\n“Are you guys talking about Brother San?” Bai Lang who had been leaning against the wall resting, suddenly interjected while his half-opened eyes glanced at Gu Ning before closing them again, stretched his long legs for a moment before lazily saying: “They were being chased by zombies when I saw him, they were heading in the direction of Eleven Square.”\nThe soldier’s expression changed, Eleven Square? That’s where the downtown zombie stronghold was at…… If they did break in there and were lucky enough to survive, how were they even going to get out of there?\nGu Ning’s expression was also slightly gloomy, but staring at Bai Lang’s face, she wondered how credible his words were.\nShe stood up and went to the window sill to look out into the distance. Diagonally opposite this building was the Eleven square, but there were too many tall buildings in between, so there was no way for them to see what was going on there. She glanced down and saw that the dense mass of zombies still huddled below the building, refusing to disperse.\nWhen she lifted her wrist to check her watch, it was already ten minutes past four o’clock. The sky was already dark and cloudy, and Gu Ning saw large black clouds looming over the city, covering up the whole sky as if some terrible beast were hiding behind those black clouds that would swoop out of it at any moment while bringing a larger disaster to the world.\nEven the air tingled with gloominess.\nGu Ning suddenly stretched out her hand and a drop of water plopped down on her palm.\n“It’s raining.” Gu Ning said as she stared at the black clouds. Immediately afterward, the sound of clattering rain rang out, countless raindrops condensed within the black clouds before cascading down like a majestic waterfall poured down.\nIt was the first rain after the apocalypse happened, and it meant a lot.\nThen she was pushed aside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThose sluggish and sickly people seemed to come alive at this moment, rushing to the window with all sorts of utensils and reaching out to collect the rain.\nGu Ning’s group all backed away.\nWatching those excited and thrilled people, they were somewhat bewildered.\n“The rain has come at a really good time. If we don’t get this rain, we’re going to run out of water. Today seems to be a good day.” The dimpled girl walked up to Gu Ning’s side again at some point and watched those people who were catching the rain and explained.\nGu Ning always felt that her last sentence seemed to have a double meaning, but she didn’t ask and only smiled faintly and gripped the knife in her hand tighter.\n“I like you a lot.” The dimpled girl suddenly stared at Gu Ning sideways and asked: “Can you stay here with me?”\nOnly then did Gu Ning realise that the dimple girls’ eyes were very dark to the point of frightening, even the two dimples on her face looked a bit odd. A chill rose from Gu Ning’s back, but she still had a smile on her face but was slightly cold: “There are still people waiting for me back home.”\n“That’s a shame.” The dimpled girl seemed to really feel a bit sad for herself, that even the dimples on her face were gone. Yet soon the dimples appeared again and she said in a light tone: “It doesn’t matter, the zombies are still down there anyway, and it’s raining heavily. You guys just stay here for the night and leave tomorrow then.”\nAlthough Gu Ning’s heart was a little uneasy because of the corpse under the tarp and the strange hunch in her heart, there was nothing else she could do at this moment so she reluctantly agreed.\n“With water. We can cook meat for dinner today.” The dimpled girl looked out at the rain and suddenly said in a cheerful voice.\n“You still have meat to eat?” Jia DaoZhang suddenly interjected and asked surprisingly.\n“Yeah. We found some meat out there, cooked it, and then dried it to preserve it for a longer time. It tastes so good. Do you want to try two pieces of jerky first?” The dimpled girl replied and pulled out two finger-long pieces of dried meat from her pocket and handed them to Jia DaoZhang.\nThe dried meat was finger-long and thick, but the colour was not brownish like sun-dried meat, as it remained bright red.\nJia DaoZhang took it with delight and said: “How kind of you.”\nAs he said this, he was about to stuff it into his mouth, as it had been so long since he had eaten meat and was craving for them.\nGu Ning’s gaze swept past the little girl’s dimple and saw it deepened, and a meaningful expression flashed past the little girl’s eyes. Gu Ning instantly had a bad intuition, without any hesitation, she forcefully plucked out the whole jerky by its end that was hanging outside of Jia DaoZhang’s mouth. Then frowning at him when the dimpled girl’s gaze snapped to her before she continued sternly: “Are you that hungry now? Save it for later when you’re very hungry.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Does anyone want some jerky~?

    "44": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-44/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter filling all their utensils with water, they began to build a fire in the middle of the room.\nThey shifted the gas tank and stove to the middle of the room, then set up a large pot with the freshly collected rainwater poured into it. Then the group of them stood up and gathered around the pot, surrounding it tightly, and after a while, a very strong aroma of the meat filled the whole room.\n\n\n\nThose who hadn’t eaten meat in a long time couldn’t help but breathe in a few intoxicating smells of it and then their craving was completely aroused.\nJia DaoZhang gulped, then lowered his voice and said: “Do you think they will give us a bite of the meat? Even if there is no meat, the broth will do too.”\nA few soldiers gulped in unison and couldn’t help but chime in: “It smells so good!”\nThe gazes of the others couldn’t help but drift to that direction as well.\nXiang Xu couldn’t help but glance over a few times and say: “It really smells so good.” She finally looked like a little child when she craved food.\nWhen Gu Ning smelled the rich aromatic smell of the meat, she didn’t know why, instead of having the desire to eat, she felt a little sick in her stomach.\nThe group of people was all given a bowl of broth with a few pieces of meat floating in them. All of them sat on the ground with their bowls, enjoying themselves so much that they didn’t even glance over.\nIt didn’t seem like they were going to invite Gu Ning and the others over to share with them.\nIt had been several hours since Gu Ning and Bai Lang’s group had taken their meal. With the serious physical exertion they did, it was about time they needed to have to intake food. Upon hearing the sounds of soup and meat being chewed at this moment, this was undoubtedly a huge temptation and torture for them. Moreover, coupled with the expressions of great enjoyment of those savouring the steaming broth, it caused their stomachs to growl in great hunger.\nAlthough Jia DaoZhang and the rest were already salivating, they could only hold back their hunger as Gu Ning remained indifferent and rested with her eyes shut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, some people in Bai Lang’s group were unable to resist the temptation.\nGu Ning and Bai Lang simultaneously opened their eyes in a slight crack and watched as Yan Yu stood up and walked over to the other group.\nEveryone watched her as she strolled over.\nYan Yu walked over gracefully and said something to the man-in-charge of the soup, then came back with a bowl of hot broth with a smile, her eyes glanced over at Gu Ning’s group with undisguised smugness.\nSeeing that Yan Yu managed to get a bowl of broth so smoothly.\nThe others couldn’t hold back any longer.\nWatching Bai Lang and Pei jing’s group of people stood up one by one and went over to ask for the soup, Jia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming, Huang MengYao, Xie YuHong, Xiang Yi and the soldiers all looked blearily at Gu Ning. Even Xiang Xu’s eyes were tinged with longing, clearly seeking Gu Ning’s opinion, yet Gu Ning kept quiet and shook her head imperceptibly, directly severing their thoughts of having some soup.\nBai Lang silently watched Gu Ning shaking her head, a flash of understanding flicked in his long slanted eyes, then he inclined his head and muttered to the man wearing a white shirt. The man in the white shirt glanced over thoughtfully and then whispered to the person beside him, after which none of their group stood up to ask for a taste of the broth. For some reason, Pei Jing didn’t ask for it either, and politely declined Yan Yu’s invitation to have a sip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“It tastes so delicious.” A man who couldn’t resist took a sip of the broth before he could walk back to his seat and exclaimed with wide eyes.\n“It’s really so tasty, I’ve never had such a good broth before and it smells so good.” Another man chimed in.\n“It’s been so long since I’ve eaten anything hot.” Another person exclaimed.\nAnother person chewed the meat in their mouth and said vaguely: “But this meat would taste even better if it had been stewed for a longer time, it was too hard to chew.”\nThe rest who didn’t get the soup because of the decision both Gu Ning and Bai Lang made were all depressed. These people should just drink the soup, why did they have to describe it so much?\nThe dimpled girl walked over with a bowl of broth and asked Gu Ning with a smile: “They’ve all gone for the broth, why don’t you try it? There’s still a lot left in the pot, enough for all of you to have it. Here, I’ve brought over a bowl especially for you.” With that, she handed the bowl in her hand to Gu Ning, and in the bowl, there were quite a few pieces of meat settled under the wobbling broth.\nGu Ning, however, didn’t take it and just smiled: “Thank you for your kindness. But we had lost too many of our companions on the way here, so none of us have the appetite to eat now.” Her smile was slightly tired and apologetic which seemed to be very genuine.\nJia DaoZhang shouted and growled in his mind, Gu Ning, you don’t have an appetite but I do!!!\nIn fact, when Gu Ning referred to “us”, it included all of them. Even though the broth was valuable, Gu Ning was even more precious, so Jia DaoZhang would not do something as stupid as tearing down Gu Ning over a bowl of broth.\nThe look of grief on his face for not getting the chance to eat the broth really seemed like he was grieving over the death of his companion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“That’s a shame.” The dimpled girl looked at the bowl of soup she was holding and said regretfully: “A soup that tasted so good may never be available again.”\nWhen Xiang Xu watched the dimpled girl’s back as she left with the broth, thinking about the look on her face as she spoke just now. An unexplainable feeling of creepiness scared her. Although she didn’t know why Gu Ning wouldn’t let them have the broth, Gu Ning always had a reason for her decision.\nThe little dimpled girl didn’t come over to Gu Ning’s side again after she had refused her broth. She just sat in the corner talking and laughing with the young men and women in her group.\nAfter an hour or so.\nThe pounding rain didn’t even show the signs of stopping.\nThe sky was as dark as ink from the inkstone. As far as the eye could see, the whole city was enveloped in complete darkness.\nThe room was pitch black because there was no light source.\nHowever, Gu Ning’s vision was not affected in the slightest.\nMost people were lying on the floor with their eyes open and whispering during this hour.\nAfterward, Gu Ning saw the dimpled girl and several other young men and women walking out of the room together in the dark. Their footsteps were so light that if it wasn’t for people like Gu Ning who had a keen sense of hearing plus the darkness of the room, no one would have noticed them walking out.\n“Keep up with them.” Gu Ning lowered her voice and whispered to Xiang Xu.\nXiang Xu naturally saw those people walking out and knew what Gu Ning meant by following them. She nodded solemnly and then closed her eyes, the water in her white lake rippled slightly before her spiritual power surged out silently and went after those people.\nThe speed of her spiritual power was unimaginably fast and soon it enveloped those people, and Xiang Xu manipulated it to analyse their behaviour.\n“They went upstairs……” Xiang Xu lowered her voice, which wasn’t too obvious in the environment where many others were whispering, so she whispered to Gu Ning describing the scene her spiritual power had perceived: “There was a flat roof above and they went into a small room….. They seem to be discussing something……” Xiang Xu paused for about ten minutes and then continued: “They’re coming down.”\n“Hold on to your knife, something bad might happen tonight.” Gu Ning said coldly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nXiang Xu shifted her gaze to Gu Ning immediately. Looking at her cold side profile, Xiang Xu felt a chill run through her heart while the thought of the corpse under the tarp made her feel slightly afraid of the possibility of something bad might happen which Gu Ning mentioned to her. Gu Ning turned over to Zhang XiaoBai and then whispered: “Zhang XiaoBai, inform the others to stay alert and awake for tonight and keep their guns in their hand.”\nZhang XiaoBai froze for a moment and immediately thought about Gu Ning’s unusual behaviour this afternoon. She might have discovered something but he didn’t question her and just obeyed her order to inform everyone in a whisper.\nJia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming, and the rest, who had been drowsy, immediately lost all tiredness when they heard Zhang XiaoBai relaying Gu Ning’s order.\nThe atmosphere inevitably became tense.\nSoon the dimpled girl’s group re-entered the room silently, they even glanced over but there wasn’t even the slightest light source in the night so they couldn’t see a thing.\nGu Ning’s vision clearly saw the expression on each of those people’s faces in the darkness before she settled her gaze on the dimpled girl’s face. As if they were reassured by the absolute darkness, the little girl recklessly removed the usual harmless mask that she showed during the day and revealed her true hidden agenda. That expression was absolutely cold and numb, while her eyes were filled with what Gu Ning had seen countless times before in the eyes of those zombies who had lost their sense of self and left with only their instincts of greed, excitement, and hunger. The combination of indifference, numbness, excitement, and hunger made her expression look particularly ghastly in the darkness.\nXiang Xu couldn’t help but cover her mouth to prevent herself from screaming out.\nEven Gu Ning felt a bone-chilling cold rise up her spine.\nThey were just like zombies and treated humans as if it was food.\nThen those…… The meat they just ate tonight was human flesh!\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Escape from a danger and now into another… Thank you all for reading =))\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",

Since he used to be the Mafia Leader, he should have this kind of vigilance.\nIt was getting later into the night.\n\n\n\nThe rain outside of the window was like a lullaby in the dead of night.\nAfter a long time, those people didn’t make any movements.\nGu Ning glanced at the time, it was already eleven o’clock.\nJia DaoZhang couldn’t bear it any longer and fell asleep in a daze against the wall, even making a slight snoring sound.\nXiang Xu was about to wake him up but Gu Ning grabbed her hand in the darkness and shook her head.\nGu Ning leaned against the wall, her eyes closed, she heard the breathing of those lying on the floor. They were lying on the floor with their eyes closed as if they had fallen into a deep sleep, yet it was quiet, too quiet.\nA sleeping person is not a dead person, even if they fall into a deep sleep, they will move somewhat, and when they move, they will naturally make some noise.\nYet there wasn’t.\nThere was no sound of people turning their bodies over or friction from the clothes.\nOnly the disordered breathing from intense excitement and agitation, shallow but unmistakably clear, reached Gu Ning’s ears. She could almost imagine the taut, ready-to-burst muscles beneath the clothes of those people pretending to be in a deep sleep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe only people in this room who were really asleep apart from Jia DaoZhang were those in Pei Jing’s group who had the broth during the day.\nOther than that, everyone was awake.\nEveryone was waiting.\nWaiting for a signal.\nFinally, an extremely subtle, clothing friction sounded.\nSomeone carefully stood up among those who were still pretending to be asleep.\nThen, one by one, those people carefully got up from the ground silently….. Such careful moments were countless practices after they had started eating human flesh. In order not to wake the sleeping “food. It was only after countless hours of training and “practice” that they were able to stand up like this without making a single sound. After that, they slaughtered those men in their sleep.\nThis was a very risky and difficult decision. Both guns and the stern aura emanating from Gu Ning and her men proved that they were a tough bunch to be messed with. If it hadn’t been a month since anyone had broken in, if winter wasn’t just around the corner, and they were finishing up their dried meat reserves, they probably wouldn’t have taken such a big risky move.\nOn the contrary, they could only risk it now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nImagine cutting their flesh into chunks or strips to cook and then drying it to become their reserve food while the bones were able to make a delicious soup base. There were more than twenty of the gang, and they were not as thin as those that were slaughtered previously, so much more meat to help them through the long winter that was arriving.\nAt the thought of this, the worries in their hearts calmed down a little.\nThere was no smile on the dimpled girl’s face at the moment, a sharp knife in her hand, and some regret as she liked the blonde-haired woman. Only if she didn’t refuse her “good intentions” otherwise she would not want to kill her.\nIf anyone could see in the darkness, it was a very terrifying image right now, with so many people rising silently in the darkness. It looked as though evil spirits crawling out of hell, their human masks ripped away from their faces, unabashedly revealing their vicious and gruesome faces.\nAt this moment, Xiang Xu even felt that these people were even more terrifying than the zombie out there.\nIn such a horrible, silent atmosphere.\n“Bang!” A loud sound rang through the darkness!\nThose “evil spirits” that were slowly advancing their way all stopped in their tracks, overwhelmed by a great sense of fear. It took a moment for one of the men walking at the front to feel the sharp pain coming from his chest, he looked down in bewilderment, yet he couldn’t see anything. He reached out and touched his sore spot, and felt the sticky and warm liquid along with a hole——\nHe let out a painful and harsh cry of disbelief before collapsing abruptly to the ground.\nEven those who were asleep were all awakened by the unmistakable and dismal screams as well as the gunfire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nA light shone abruptly in the darkness which lighted up the faces of those people that didn’t have the time to hide their expression of excitement and hunger. Their hideous expression was like those evil spirits and was exposed under the beam of light——\nEveryone except Gu Ning and Xiang Xu drew in a breath of cold air.\nHuang MengYao couldn’t help but shriek in shock.\nNo one bothered to blame her.\nIt was because the scene right now was so frightening and horrifying that some others didn’t shriek simply because they were too frozen in fear that they had forgotten to even scream.\nGu Ning was not stunned, she held onto her knife and her gaze pierced through the darkness to Bai Lang who was holding his gun.\nBai Lang also glanced at her, obviously, he could also see her in the darkness.\nThe silent stalemate between both sides only lasted for about ten seconds.\nThen there was chaos.\nGu Ning quickly gathered her men around herself and formed a circle surrounding Xiang Xu in the center and told them to attack as Xiang Xu commanded. Afterward, she rushed straight into the crowd, the darkness didn’t affect her as she ducked to avoid two knives swinging at her randomly. The knife in her hand twirled nimbly before two flashes of light went out in the darkness and stabbed directly into two others’ chests around her. The moment she drew back her knife, she leaped by stepping on the man’s shoulder and kicking the other man that was charging towards her. The dagger in her left hand shot out and straight into the man’s throat! With a flick of the knife in her right hand, she slit the throat of another woman.\nThe crowd was cramped, but Gu Ning was like a nimble fish, swimming quickly through the crowd, knives flashing as people continued to cry out in pain before falling in the darkness.\nMoreover, Gu Ning was not alone in this fight.\nEven in the darkness, Yin Sang didn’t have Gu Ning’s night vision skills, but she still showed her great strength. At this point, there was a clear distinction between Yin Sang who had fighting skills versus Gu Ning who would kill based on instinct. Although Gu Ning had killed many people, she felt the strain. Whereas, Yin Sang, on the other hand, was much more at ease, carrying a large knife easily and striking her opponent’s most vulnerable spot with every stroke and unerring accuracy, not even wasting an ounce of excess energy.\nGu Ning was now like killing a group of blind people with her night vision.\nWhile Yin Sang was now a blind man herself, killing no lesser than Gu Ning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe difference was very distinctive.\nGu Ning’s lips pursed even tighter as she watched Yin Sang intuitively bend to dodge an attack, before swinging her knife again with precision and slicing another man’s throat.\nYan Yu, who had been hiding behind Pei Jing and couldn’t see anything, sent out two fireballs with a pale face and threw them into the crowd before anyone could react or have time to stop her.  The people who had been hiding in here didn’t know what special abilities were, so they were stunned by the fireballs that appeared out of nowhere. The fear made them instinctively choose to run away, and instead of hitting the people, the two fireballs hit the ground and ignited everything that could burn that was laid on the floor!\nThe fire spread at once and the darkroom was instantly illuminated by flames! Everyone was shocked for a moment before they were stunned by the instantaneous spread of the fire.\n“Get out of here quickly!” Gu Ning was the first to react, exiting from the crowd and away from the fire before shouting to Cheng Ming, Jia DaoZhang, and the rest while casually hacking two people who were blocking the way and were still in a daze. She took the lead and rushed towards the door!\nAfterward, everyone reacted and all scrambled towards the door!\nThe whole room was almost covered with combustible materials such as clothes or newspapers, and the fire spread out very quickly, igniting half of the room at once and spreading rapidly towards the door. Some were a few steps behind and were instantly turned into a flamed man as the tongues of fire licked them. They subconsciously screamed and rushed towards the crowd that was cramming at the door. More and more of them were set alight and they fell to the ground trying to put out the fire on them. Yet most of the floor was also covered with fire, how could they possibly put them out? People covered in fire rushed through the room, screams grew louder and louder, the flames grew fiercer and in a matter of minutes, the room was an inferno on earth!\nThose unbearably harsh screams of pain rang out through the silent night of the city.\nZhang XiaoBai was pushed over and was forced to the very outer rim of the crowd. Suddenly, an extra hand grabbed his ankle. As he glanced down, he saw a woman whose lower half of her body was on fire, tugging at his ankles and shouting at him in pain: “Help me! Help me!”\nZhang XiaoBai didn’t know what to do at that moment.\nAt that moment, a foot came down from the top and stepped vigorously on that hand, crushing it with force. Zhang XiaoBai jerked up in horror and saw a pretty but icy face, it was the young woman who often followed Bai Lang around. Without even glancing at Zhang XiaoBai, Yin Sang stepped directly over that hand and then drew her knife and stabbed towards the back of the man who was pushing forward in front of her, killing and opening up a bloody path with every stab!\nZhang XiaoBai was so horrified that he no longer bothered to look at the woman rolling and screaming on the ground while he hurriedly followed Yin Sang and forced his way out.\nJia DaoZhang rushed out of the door with a long tail of fire trailing behind him, screaming and rolling on the ground at the same time. It turned out that the back of his long robe caught fire and was burning. Cheng Ming and the others helped to put out the fire and in the end, Jia DaoZhang stared at his robe which had turned into a blouse and wept.\nThe brightness from the flames was seeping through the door gaps, while the expression from the remaining people was distraught.\n“My son was burned to death inside! You all! Give back my son’s life!” A woman in her fifties shouted as she viciously lunged towards them with her knife raised.\nGu Ning directly shoved Jia DaoZhang aside, then dodged the cleaving knife and stabbed the woman’s chest instead.\nThe woman stared at Gu Ning incredulously, her eyes full of malice as she covered her chest and fell to the ground while the blood from her chest wound flowed down the steps.\nThe fire in the room was so strong that it soon burnt the door, with flames crackling out through the gaps.\nGu Ning’s glance swept through the crowd and saw that all the familiar faces were present. Her heart calmed down before she led the way by stepping over the pools of blood on the ground and running down the stairs.\nCheng Ming, Jia DaoZhang, and the rest all reacted hurriedly and followed Gu Ning down the stairs.\nAll of them ran downward.\nJust as they ran to the next level, all they heard was a loud bang from above! The closed-door was swept open directly by the wave of hot pressured air, smashed against the wall with a thud before the huge wave of heat came crashing down—— those who were slower runners tagging behind them were all hit head-on by the wave, flying straight into mid-air and then crashed to the ground in a hail of woe.\nGu Ning kept running until she reached the fourth floor before she stopped.\nSoon, everyone ran down.\nHowever, Gu Ning soon discovered that apart from them and Bai Lang, Pei Jing groups, the dimple girls, and her companions had all taken advantage of the chaos to run away to god knows where.\nZhang XiaoBai switched on his torch and swept through the crowd quickly and exclaimed: “Those people disappeared?”\nOnly then did the others realize that all those people suddenly disappeared to nowhere.\nAfter all, they had lived here for a long time, long enough to get a clear picture of the building’s geography.\n“Gu Ning, what the hell do those people want? It’s not like we’ve offended them.” Jia DaoZhang asked.\n“They’re cannibals.”  Gu Ning paused and suddenly said with some malice: “Tonight’s broth was made from human flesh.”\n……\n……\nThere was silence in the room for a moment, then someone began to gag out the food.\nJia DaoZhang said with a shaky voice: “Can… Cannibals..?”\nGu Ning’s voice echoed out in the darkness: “What they had in that corner covered by a tarp was a corpse. A skeleton to be exact with all the flesh scraped clean. If my guess is correct, they cut the flesh off the human after killing them. Then they cooked and dried it…”\n“Then that jerky I took a bite of—— ouh——“ Before Jia DaoZhang could finish his sentence, he recoiled with a pang, bowed over, and began to vomit.\nThose few who had managed to calm down began to dry gagging again as soon as they heard the sound of Jia DaoZhang vomiting.\nYan Yu was gagging so much that even tears came out of her eyes, and when she heard Gu Ning’s statement, she became so furious and shouted angrily with her reddened eyes: “You knew all along! Why didn’t you tell us! How could you be so vicious?!”\nGu Ning stared at her coldly: “I just believe that there is no free meal in the world, and even if there is, it is poisonous. Don’t blame others for your stupidity.” Gu Ning was still angry about the fire Yan Yu had started and at this moment, she still dared to confront her. Thus, Gu Ning didn’t give her any *face and directly smashed her pride fiercely.\n(T/N: *面子 miàn zi means honour, reputation, pride, and self-respect)\n“You!” Yan Yu conjured another fireball in anger.\nThen she saw several guns aimed at her amidst the firelight.\n“So what if you have a special ability?” Gu Ning looked at her with a sneer: “Trying to see if your fireball is faster or my bullet is?”\n“I’ll kill you! I swear I’ll kill you!” Under the firelight, Yan Yu growled as she viciously glared at Gu Ning filled with spite. Staring at Yan Yu’s spiteful eyes, Gu Ning understood that she would try to kill her if she was defenceless now.\nGu Ning’s eyes narrowed slightly, a murderous aura flashed in her eyes, as she gripped the knife in her hand tightly.\n“Yan Yu!” At this very moment, Pei Jing, who had been quiet, chided out then intentionally pulled Yan Yu behind himself and said to Gu Ning: “I’m sorry, I’ll apologize on her behalf.”\n“If apologies work, what’s the point of having a knife?” An abrupt voice rang out, and it was from Bai Lang who was leaning against the wall with a smile that wished for the whole world to be in chaos.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Dang… really this Yan Yu is so annoying. gesssh… Thank you all for reading!)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "46": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-46/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“If apologies worked, what’s the point of having a knife?” Bai Lang smiled as he said this.\nThe atmosphere in the entire room tensed up once again.\n\n\n\nYan Yu seemed to be very scared of Bai Lang, even with so many guns pointed at her just now, she still dared to speak harshly to Gu Ning. Yet, right now she turned pale from fear when Bai Lang said such a simple sentence.\nProbably because she thought Gu Ning was just intimidating her whereas Bai Lang would actually do it.\nGu Ning sighed in her heart, thinking that no matter what, it was always the truly wicked people who had the advantage, and she wasn’t evil enough or hadn’t shown much of her wickedness yet.\nShe glanced at Pei Jing, who was apologetic but at the same time carried a resoluteness that would not allow him to back down. This meant that he would stand up for Yan Yu if Gu Ning were to make a move against her, and Gu Ning knew clearly that she couldn’t take the risk as his special ability had not yet been revealed.\nWith a slight lift of her hand, the soldiers’ guns lowered, and she stared coldly at Pei Jing: “One day you will die because of her.” Her voice was flat, so flat that it didn’t sound like a threat but more of a prophecy.\nPei Jing’s expression changed slightly, yet he kept quiet.\nGu Ning chose a dry area as a resting place.\nThen she said: “I will keep watch during the first half of the night, while Zhang XiaoBai and Zhang Yang will keep watch during the second half of the night. Tomorrow, we will set out at first light to find Brother San.”\n“Let me take over the first half of the night.” Cheng Ming asked.\nGu Ning firmly rejected his suggestion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe other knew that Gu Ning’s decision would not be easily changed, so each of them found a comfortable position and prepared to sleep. They had experienced a near-death situation just now, and they struggled to stay awake at the start of nightfall and till now. The extreme physical fatigue overcame the residual fear in their hearts and with Gu Ning keeping watch, their mental fears slowly calmed down and they soon fell asleep.\nJia DaoZhang didn’t sleep, he was disgusted at the thought of putting dried human flesh in his mouth and chewed on it a few times. If Gu Ning hadn’t yanked it out so hard, the flesh jerky would have gone into his stomach by now.\nOn the other side, there were occasional sounds of dry vomiting. It was clear that eating human flesh was completely unacceptable to ordinary people and would only scar them for life. However, all that broth and human flesh had probably been half-digested by now, so even if they tried vomiting again, nothing would be coming out.\nGu Ning walked gently to the window and stared at the rain outside. Her mood was a little sullen as they hadn’t been able to go back tonight. Her parents who had stayed at the colony must be worried and scared. Yet they still had to continue their search for Brother San tomorrow, and she didn’t know if they were safe at this point. Gu Ning frowned as this was not a good sign.\nThe only reason she exists in this world was to keep her parents safe, but now she is becoming more and more concerned about the well-being of others.\nBai Lang walked up to Gu Ning’s side at some point, gazing out the window at the dark and dreary rain.\nGu Ning frowned slightly, but she didn’t make any sound or move away as if Bai Lang didn’t exist.\nBai Lang kept quiet too, treating each other as if they did not exist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe two of them just stood quietly by the window and looked out. The dark and gloomy world was as clear as day in their eyes.\nIt was slightly before seven o’clock when everyone woke up.\nThe rain outside had stopped.\nThose who had guns began to check them.\nYesterday was treacherous, but they all insisted on not using their guns, so they still had plenty of ammo left.\nAfter a night of rest, they were not in better shape but rather, a number of them caught a cold because of the sudden drop in temperature due to the heavy rain last night.\nMeanwhile, Jia DaoZhang was fine because of his thick robes, the rest of the team showed signs of catching a cold.\nEven the air was cool and the exposed skin was stirred with goosebumps.\nGu Ning zipped the tracksuit she wore up to the top, which was thick enough to withstand the chill.\nPlacing her gun behind her back, Gu Ning walked to the window and glanced down. The zombies that had gathered last night had disappeared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning took out the food from her backpack and shared a little bit with each person. After eating, she and her group went straight out without bidding any greeting to the other team.\nThe man in the white shirt glanced at Bai Lang, and when he saw that he had kept quiet, he too kept silent.\nWalking back to the second floor, the ropes were still hanging out, so it seemed that those people had indeed escaped.\nGu Ning and the others climbed down the rope.\nIt had rained heavily all night and a layer of water had accumulated on the wet ground.\nThey all followed Gu Ning’s lead and proceeded forward.\nAs they proceeded forward for a while, Zhang XiaoBai halted his steps and looked at Gu Ning’s back before gathering the courage and asked: “Aren’t we going to look for Brother San?” They were now heading in the direction that they had parked their trucks.\nGu Ning stopped but didn’t glance back as she replied: “Where are we supposed to find him?”\nZhang XiaoBai was speechless.\nGu Ning continued: “If Brother San is still alive, he will come back and find us. I’ll wait until half-past four, if he hasn’t returned…… by half-past four today, we’ll head back to the colony.”\nShe had thought about it all night, and this was her final decision. She didn’t have the confidence that she could break into the pedestrian street and still get out alive in one piece. Not to mention that she couldn’t be sure of Brother San’s location, and even if what Bai Lang said was true, Eleven Square was so big, who knew which corner were they hiding in? Also, there was a high chance that they would desperately try to break in, then end up unable to find Brother San and the others while they would get into trouble themselves.\nTherefore, she would wait in the truck until 4:30 pm and when Brother San and the others didn’t show up, then she would assume that they were all dead.\nThere was no way around the fact that a lot of people die every day in this world.\nGu Ning thought about this in her heart, then continued to walk in the direction where the truck was parked.\n“Let’s go.” Zhang Yang said to Zhang XiaoBai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai’s shoulders slumped, even if Gu Ning didn’t say anything, he knew that even if they had Xiang Xu as their radar, it would still be a difficult task to find Brother San and the others. A few other soldiers patted his shoulder as if to comfort each other. Then they all dragged their heavy steps and followed Gu Ning to proceed forward.\nAlthough Gu Ning had convinced herself, her heart still felt heavy.\nNo one spoke along the way.\nThey took care of a small wave of zombies in silence and managed to obtain two coloured crystal cores. That didn’t cheer them up.\nContinuing, they soon saw the two military trucks still parked quietly at the same spot.\nXiang Xu suddenly stopped in her tracks, tugged Gu Ning’s shirt and stared at the military truck in front of her, and said: “There’s someone inside.”\nThe group tensed up all of a sudden.\nEveryone subconsciously looked at Gu Ning.\n“How many people are in there?” Gu Ning asked.\nXiang Xu paused for a while before replying: “More than ten.”\nGu Ning and the soldiers exchanged a glance and a quick nod before they quickly changed their positions and approached with their guns. They found the best place to shoot and then gestured to Gu Ning that they were ready.\nGu Ning glanced at Jia DaoZhang, who was stunned for a moment and cleared his throat as he was about to shout.\nThe door of the truck’s carriage, which had been closed tightly, suddenly creaked with the turning of the door handle—— and then was thrown open in one swift push.\nA series of pulls on the gun handle sounded and all the soldiers were the first to raise their guns and aimed at the door, firing as soon as they noticed the slightest hint of something different.\nHowever, when the door opened, the soldiers froze, and so did the people in the carriage.\nZhang XiaoBai rubbed his eyes incredulously, then exclaimed in surprise: “Company Commander?!”\nEveryone, including Gu Ning, felt astonished at this moment that the person who had pushed the carriage door open and stood in it was none other than Brother San whom they had been looking for!\nBrother San obviously didn’t expect to see Gu Ning and the rest as soon as he pushed open the door. After freezing for a moment, he said loudly: “Gu Ning! Where have you guys been all night?!”Then he shouted in the carriage: “Get up, all of you, Gu Ning, and the others are still alive! They’re back!”\n“Ah?!” The soldiers who were still asleep all woke up with a jolt and got up from the floor and ran to the door to take a look. What they saw was Gu Ning and the rest were staring at them with shocked expressions.\nAll of them jumped out of the truck one by one and ran over excitedly while exclaiming: “Where have you all been! You scared the hell out of us! We thought you had been dragged back to the nest by the swarm of zombies to be used as food reserves!”\nIt was only at this moment that Gu Ning slowly regained her senses and stared at the cheerful soldiers in dismay, unable to understand what was going on now.\nZhang XiaoBai said with his reddened eyes: “I was going to ask where you guys had run off to! Luo Long, you just shouted a sentence then you didn’t say another word. We heard the gunshots and we went searching for you guys, but we only found Wu Qiang’s body. After searching around for half a day, we still couldn’t find you lots. We almost got screwed last night, nearly ate human flesh, and almost became someone else’s emergency ration!”\n“Alright, alright, stop arguing for now. Gu Ning, let me show you my psychic power!” Brother San interrupted Zhang XiaoBai impatiently and said excitedly, eager to show off his special ability to Gu Ning.\nAfterward, three earth spikes appeared out of nowhere in front of him, suspended in a line in front of his chest.\nGu Ning couldn’t help but lit up her eyes and replied in surprise: “Brother San, you’ve succeeded?!” Zhang XiaoBai and the others flocked over, checking out the three earth spikes with envy and amazement.\nBrother San laughed in triumph before he was roughly shoved aside.\n“Me too! Me too!” Zhong Xu, who was always very mature and calm, couldn’t hide the excitement on his face after shoving Brother San aside and exclaimed excitedly to Gu Ning: “Gu Ning, let me show you my psychic power!” Then he flipped his palm and a football-sized ball of water appeared in his hand: “I’m a water ability user! I’ve tasted this water, it’s drinkable! From now on, we’ll never lack water again!”\n“Okay, okay! My turn, it’s my turn!” Luo Long reached out and pushed Zhong Xu aside and stretched his hand out to Gu Ning and asked: “Gu Ning, try cutting my hand with your knife!”\nGu Ning froze for a moment, and the next second she heard Zhong Xu interject: “Let me do it!” Then he raised the knife in his hand and slashed down towards Luo Long’s arm!\nEveryone in the group that was led by Gu Ning was stunned, Huang MengYao even let out a cry of shock. Gu Ning however just watched quietly, only to see that the knife landed heavily on Luo Long’s arm. There was no bloody scene as they had imagined the arm being chopped off. Instead, a clang sounded, the knife slashed on the arm made a sound as if it was slashed on metal plating.\nZhang XiaoBai exclaimed excitedly: “*Jin Zhong Zhao!”\n(T/N: 金钟罩 jīn zhōng zhào means golden shield, the ability to sustain the thrusts of sharp weapons on one’s bare skin. Originated from Seventy-two techniques of Shaolin.)\nLuo Long was instantly speechless ?.\n“It’s the Gold element’s special ability.” Gu Ning smiled and explained: “Brother San is Earth, and Zhong Xu is water. I didn’t expect you guys to succeed with three abilities users.” According to the odds Xiang Xu had said previously, their chances of success rate was considered to be very high.\n“Okay, you guys had enough of showing off, so shut up for now.” Brother San said.\nHe immediately made Zhang Xu and the others burst into a fit of sarcasm, the person who was showing off the most was obviously him.\n“What about you guys, Gu Ning? How many of you have succeeded?” Brother San asked.\nZhong Xu, Luo Long, and the rest immediately glanced over, looking at Gu Ning nervously and anxiously.\nGu Ning shrugged her shoulders and replied: “We haven’t started yet. We’ve intended to return to the colony before we try it out.”\nA new situation could arise at any time last night, and if they fainted for hours like what she did previously, it would be the end if anything happened. Thus, to be on the safe side, she decided to return to the colony before allowing the rest to swallow the crystal cores.\nBrother San and the others were disappointed for a moment before calling out again: “Go, go, go. Go back to the truck first! Let’s hurry back to the colony!” After saying this, they greeted each other before heading back.\nGu Ning was surrounded in the middle like a star while they strolled back to the truck, joking and laughing with the soldiers along the way. Suddenly, her gaze inadvertently swept over the carriage, then the smile on her face froze abruptly and her footsteps stopped.\n“Gu Ning, what’s wrong?” They were all a little surprised to see when Gu Ning suddenly stopped in her tracks.\nBrother San glanced back, then followed Gu Ning’s gaze towards the carriage and explained: “Those people were the ones we met yesterday at Eleven Square, they said they knew you, so we brought them all along by the way…..” Brother San didn’t finish his sentence because he noticed Gu Ning’s change in her expression.\nThe smile froze on Gu Ning’s face slowly faded away, her gaze was cold as she stared at the people inside the carriage, her expression was icy cold.\nShe pulled up a sneer, not only did they know each other……\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Opps drama coming up!

At this moment, she didn’t know what kind of expression she should show on her face.\nShould she groan at the playfulness of fate or their haunting of her?\n\n\n\nHer resentment towards them had not been erased by her success in finding her parents, and it was the deepest thorn buried in her heart. She hadn’t thought about it for a long time and the thorn had been painless, but now she glanced at those people in the carriage and the thorn began to dig into her flesh, causing wave after wave of sharp pain.\nGu Ning laughed in anger, she glanced at Lu JiaZi, then glanced at Jiang Yu, before snapping at Lin MeiFeng, and Jiang Yuezhou.\nOther than Gu Ning, no one else laughed.\nLooking at the laughter on Gu Ning’s face, Brother San suddenly felt that perhaps he had done something wrong.\nLu JiaZi stared at Gu Ning, he also didn’t expect that the meeting would take place in such a situation and he could see the cold and a hint of pain in Gu Ning’s eyes. The hint of joy that had involuntarily arisen in his heart vanished without a trace instantly, and he opened his mouth but found it difficult to even call out Gu Ning’s name.\nJiang YueZhou, however, had a pang in his heart, and he could help but cry out: “NingNing……”\nThe smile on Gu Ning’s face plummeted as she glanced over to Brother San and said: “Brother San, I don’t know any of these people.”\nGu Ning continued: “Yet I don’t know why I feel so uncomfortable when I see them. Thus, Brother San, I have to trouble you to get them off.”\nGu Ning spoke this statement in such a righteous manner, that no one would believe her that she didn’t know any of them.\nNaturally, Brother San was not a fool and sensed Gu Ning’s hostility. Although he didn’t know what had happened to make Gu Ning harbour such strong hostility towards them, since they were now allies, Gu Ning’s enemies were naturally his enemies as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTherefore, he didn’t hesitate or even feel embarrassed, and very rightfully said to the few people in the carriage: “Excuse us, we’re a bit inconvenienced at the moment, so please get out of the truck.”\nWhat inconvenience? Gu Ning’s displeasure was their inconvenience.\nLin MeiFeng, who had been keeping a “low profile” finally exploded when she heard these words. She stood up violently and rushed to the door, pointing at Gu Ning and cursed: “Gu Ning, you god*mned b*tch! If it wasn’t you who smashed up our bus! Would we even be in this mess as we are today? You’ll be d*mned if you don’t even acknowledge your uncle! Your parents taught you to be such a heartless b*tch!”\n“Bang!” A loud sound rang!\nAlong with Lin MeiFeng’s miserable scream like a dying pig, a bullet had grazed her ear, and a few more centimetres, that bullet would have hit Lin MeiFeng in her head. Lin MeiFeng screamed and covered her ear, blood flowing out from her fingers in a horrifying way.\nGu Ning raised her gun coldly and said: “If you speak one more word, I’ll kill you.”\nThe shot was unpredictable, and even those who had been watching at the side were all taken aback. After observing the icy coldness that filled Gu Ning’s expression, they had guessed a few possible reasons in their heart.\nLin MeiFeng wanted to continue cursing, but the sharp pain from her ear and Gu Ning’s cold expression made her hold back her curses. Although she couldn’t believe it, she was really afraid that Gu Ning would launch into a frenzy and kill her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJiang Yu rushed over to protect Lin MeiFeng, her pretty eyes widened and her expression was so incredulous: “Gu Ning, are you crazy!”\nJiang YueZhou held onto Lin MeiFeng, trembling all over, not knowing whether he was angry or afraid, but he dared not meet Gu Ning’s eyes.\n“Hold your fire! Don’t shoot! We’re getting out of the truck!” The two young men and women who didn’t even know Gu Ning was frightened and jumped out of the truck in a hurry.\n“Let’s get out of the truck.” Lu JiaZi said indifferently, then jumped out of the truck first.\nHe looked at Gu Ning, his eyes seemed to have deep pain in them: “Gu Ning, I regret it, in fact, I regretted the moment the bus was driven away.”\nGu Ning knew what he was talking about, but she didn’t care anymore. She didn’t even want to know if what he was saying was true or false, she didn’t even look at that face that she had liked so much previously and now she just replied indifferently: “It’s none of my business.”\nGu Ning knew clearly in her heart that the Gu Ning who had loved Lu JiaZi for ten years or more, the Gu Ning who had trusted him unconditionally, was already dead.\nShe brushed past Lu JiaZi with an uncaring expression and walked straight to the truck. The soldiers all regained their senses and gave an odd look before following her and getting into the truck. On the other hand, Cheng Ming’s gaze was much more deliberate as he had seen this man before. When Gu Ning graduated from school, he was the one who drove his car to pick up Gu Ning from school. Lu JiaZi kept staring into the carriage, while Gu Ning who was in the carriage didn’t even give him a single glance.\nIt wasn’t until the truck door was shut that he was cut off from staring.\nThe tires spun sharply, splashing up a puddle of mud. The two trucks sped away and soon disappeared from their sight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLin MeiFeng covered her ears with blood on her hands and still had the strength to curse under her breath.\nJiang Yu, however, staring at Lu JiaZi with a slightly pale face, she had heard what Lu JiaZi said but she didn’t dare to question what he meant. She was no longer in a position to be arrogant in front of Lu JiaZi……\nThe atmosphere in the carriage was very dull.\nGu Ning sat in the corner with her eyes closed, looking a little tired.\nBrother San was a bit embarrassed, he originally started with good intentions to give Gu Ning a surprise, but who knew it was more of a scare than a surprise.\nThe others conversed wordlessly and intensely by exchanging eye contact. The conversation was naturally about Gu Ning’s relationship with those few people. Although they were very curious, Gu Ning had no desire to confide in them, so of course, they would not *touch the tender spot.\n(T/N: *哪壶不开提哪壶 Nǎ hú bù kāi tí nǎ hú which translated as lifting the pot which was not open. This proverb means to talk about something that should not be mentioned.)\nCompared to the group of people who appeared to be very restrained because the person in question was in the carriage with them, the truck in front of them was completely carefree. Their eyes glowed as they gossiped about Gu Ning’s reaction.\n“At first they said they were Gu Ning’s real aunt and uncle, and that Jiang Yu was Gu Ning’s cousin. What about that Lu JiaZi? The cousin’s husband?” One of the soldiers asked. They had exchanged names on the truck and had a rough idea of their relationship with Gu Ning.\n“It looks a bit strange to me. You guys saw Gu Ning’s attitude towards that Lu JiaZi is not how one is supposed to treat a cousin’s husband. Lu JiaZi even said something to Gu Ning about regrets or not, he had the look of a guy who relies on a girl’s money and like A heartless man too. Could it be that Jiang Yu stole Gu Ning’s boyfriend shamelessly? That’s why Gu Ning is so……” Replied the soldier who became outraged at the end.\nOne of the soldiers replied: “That doesn’t make sense. Gu Ning doesn’t look like someone who had their boyfriend robbed. I reckon it was not that simple.”\nZhong Xu suddenly asked slowly: “The only thing I find strange is that someone dares to steal a boyfriend from Gu Ning?”\nLuo Long, the only one who had seen what Gu Ning was capable of, nodded with empathy.\nWho could have imagined that Gu Ning, who was now so “murderous”, was just a girl who didn’t even dare watch chicken being slaughtered just three months ago?\nThe journey back to the colony was very smooth.\nBack at the third company’s base camp, the few soldiers who had stayed behind were thrilled to see them, but when they noticed a few of their comrades were missing, they just kept silent and mourned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFather Gu and Mother Gu, who had been worried, also put their hearts at ease when they saw Gu Ning was unharmed.\nThe children all cheered and jumped in joy.\nGu Ning didn’t mention the small occurrence when she returned, although everyone else had some question in mind, they all tacitly agreed not to mention it either.\nAfter a bit of lively banter, it was time to close the door and share the spoils.\nBefore sharing the spoils of the battle, Brother San, Zhong Xu, and Luo Long inevitably show off their special abilities again, causing a few of the soldiers that were left behind to gasp in surprise.\nFather Gu pushed his glasses and held the earth spike that Brother San had conjured up in his hand, feeling so shocked: “This…… is not in line with scientific principles. How did this conjure?”\nNaturally, Brother San and the others couldn’t come out with any reason: “It just conjured like this.”\nMother Gu used her finger to test the sharpness of the spike: “It’s quite sharp. You should be careful not to stab anyone accidentally.”\nNext, it was time to share the spoils.\nXiang Xu took out all the crystal cores that Gu Ning had given her for safekeeping and placed them in the small basin with water which became cloudy simultaneously.\nAfter washing it twice, the crystal cores burst into their original glory.\nThere were eight coloured crystal cores in total.\nSinking beneath the water, it blossomed with a dazzling brilliance as the water rippled.\n“Is this the crystal core?” Wang Yang, who remained behind, asked after swallowing a mouthful of saliva.\nFather Gu picked one and put it in front of his glasses to look at it carefully: “You will obtain a special ability like them after eating this?”\nGu Ning added: “The odds are not a hundred percent. Like Brother San and the others, they got three special abilities users out of the dozen that tried, the odds are very high.”\nThen it was a question of how to distribute it.\nEveryone’s silently focused on Gu Ning. In fact, these crystal cores Gu Ning only accounted for three but there was no doubt that Gu Ning had killed the most zombies. Not to mention that if it wasn’t for Gu Ning’s vigilance last night, all of them might have been cut into pieces, cooked, and dried to become emergency ration.\nThus, they tacitly agreed to pass these crystal cores to Gu Ning to distribute them.\nGu Ning’s expression remained calm as usual and said: “We had a deal before we left, whoever killed the zombies, the crystal cores would go to them.”\nAfter saying that, she fished out her three crystal cores from the basin and then made a gesture of invitation with her right hand.\nXiang Yu was the first that solemnly fished out two crystal cores from it.\nOne for Zhang XiaoBai.\nOne for Huang MengYao.\nOne for Shi Tou.\nThe rest were empty-handed.\nEven though they were mentally prepared, those who didn’t have the crystal cores could hide their disappointment.\nIt’s not that they didn’t kill the zombies, but killing the zombies also requires a certain amount of luck. Coloured crystal cores, after all, were very rare and they might not even get a coloured crystal core after killing ten evolved zombies.\nFor example, Huang MengYao had only killed a zombie, but it happened that this zombie had a coloured crystal core in its head.\nAlso when the number of zombies killed reached a certain amount, the chances of getting coloured crystal cores increased as well.\nJust like Gu Ning who got the most crystal cores, it wasn’t because she was lucky, rather she was kind of unlucky. If there wasn’t any crystal core by killing ten zombies, she would kill twenty or thirty of them. By killing and increasing the number of zombies, she then gained the three coloured crystal cores.\nAlthough Huang MengYao was a little ashamed, she held the crystal core tightly in her hand, knowing full well that this was the only chance to change her fate and she had to grasp on it firmly.\nGu Ning took three crystal cores and without the slightest hesitation gave two of them directly to her parents.\nShe still had a crystal core in her backpack that she had dug out of the zombie dog’s brain in the supermarket, so she had an extra.\nGu Ning hesitated for a moment, glanced over to Cheng Ming, and called out: “Cheng Ming.”\nCheng Ming was in a disappointed mood when he suddenly heard Gu Ning call out for him and reflexively answered.\nThen a fair-looking palm was casually stretched out amidst the astonished and fiery eyes of many, a golden crystal core lay silently on top of the palm.\nGu Ning didn’t have any extra expression, just glanced at him faintly and said: “Wish you all the best.”\nIt was as if it was just a trivial little thing.\nOn the contrary, Cheng Ming knew that it was certainly not an insignificant little thing. Cheng Ming stared at Gu Ning and opened his mouth, yet he didn’t know what to say. He had seen how dangerous it was when Gu Ning tried to kill these zombies, the crystal core wasn’t that easily gained. Although he had killed half a dozen of evolved zombies, he was unable to get even one, and most of the people here didn’t have it either. Whereas, Gu Ning had passed this crystal core to him so casually……\nGu Ning usually didn’t show any intimacy to him, and even words were rarely exchanged. Even if he killed lots of zombies, Gu Ning didn’t spare a glance at him, and he thought……. Yet all that thought doesn’t matter now, what matters the most was that Gu Ning gave the crystal core to no one but him. The meaning it represented made Cheng Ming’s heart pound a bit faster, and it was only after a long time that he reached out to take the crystal core. He looked at Gu Ning with incomparable solemnity, he didn’t speak any words, but he had made a promise deep in his heart.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ahhhhh… so how many of them will obtain the special abilities and what elements~ Thank you all for reading!)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "48": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-48/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs Xiang Yi watched Gu Ning casually give the crystal core to Cheng Ming, he pursed his lips and tightened his grip on the two crystal cores in his hand. With extreme reluctance, he elbowed Jia DaoZhang twice and handed over a crystal core to him.\nJia DaoZhang’s slender eyes widened as he stared at the crystal core and pointed at himself: “For me?”\n\n\n\nXiang Yi skimmed his lips: “Well, seeing as you’ve helped a lot too.”\n“Hey, hey, you shouldn’t have done this.” Jia DaoZhang acted with humbleness but his hands quickly reached out and grabbed the crystal core. He silently thought in his mind that since Xiang Yi gave him this crystal core, he would no longer throw a fit whenever Xiang Yi called him a swindler in the future.\nThose who had crystal cores in their hands found a place to lie down before swallowing it with great solemnity.\nFather Gu and Mother Gu were a little nervous, Mother Gu even asked worriedly: “Can we swallow such a big thing? Should we swallow it with some water?”\nAfter Gu Ning had assured them for a while, did they apprehensively place the crystal core into their mouths.\nIt didn’t take too long for them to pass out one by one.\nXiang Yi had already done this in many instances, this time he swallowed the crystal core and didn’t fall asleep immediately. He just leaned against the wall and let Xiang Xu feel the fluctuation of his psychic energy.\nThose who didn’t get the opportunity were a little disappointed and ate their breakfast in silence.\nSeeing this, Brother San spoke: “Don’t look so gloomy, from tomorrow onwards, let’s go out every day to kill zombies and get more crystal cores.”\n“That’s right. We should try to obtain as many crystal cores as we could before other people noticed it. Otherwise, it will only get harder in the future.” Gu Ning continued. It was conceivable that once the news of the crystal cores was released, it would trigger a craze for hunting zombies, which was a good thing. But the prerequisite was that she had to ensure that her group developed special abilities as a priority, which in turn would keep their combat power strong in the coming battles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning had a vague feeling in her heart that as humans became more powerful, zombies won’t be their only enemies. Further, into the future, the intensity of the war among humans would only increase as supplies became scarcer. It might even be more brutal than the war between zombies, and right now, it was still the beginning.\nTaking advantage of this time to build up their strength would be of great use in future wars among humans and zombies.\nAfter hearing Brother San’s and Gu Ning’s speech, the rest slightly cheered up.\nGu Ning glanced at her watch and quickly calculated the time in the other world in her mind. There was still plenty of time for her to remain here, so even if she fell asleep for a few hours like that day, it shouldn’t delay or affect the things in the other world.\nShe pulled out the pure white crystal core in her backpack and was a bit nervous, after all, Xiang Xu said that the green circle of light in her pupils was a sign that the special ability had been developed. Yet for some reason, she couldn’t feel the psychic energy fluctuation, so she was afraid that eating this crystal core might give the same result…… Gu Ning didn’t dare think any further and put the crystal core directly into her mouth, then closed her eyes. The first time she swallowed the crystal core, she was so possessed that she ate it like *Zhu BaJie gobbling down the ginseng fruit, without tasting anything at all, and she got horrified by her action afterward. This time she decided to feel it carefully, the crystal core instantly melted on her tongue, turning into a cool stream of water. And as if something was guiding it, it flowed down her throat even without her swallowing it. Gu Ning could accurately feel the cool stream flowing inside her body, tracing out a clear path.\n(T/N: 猪八戒 Zhu BaJie was the pig character from the novel Journey to the West.)\nXiang Xu was originally paying close attention to Xiang Yi’s psychic energy fluctuations after he ate the crystal core, but suddenly snapped her attention to Gu Ning in shock: “Wow such strong psychic energy fluctuations.”\nGu Ning passed out.\nIf she had been in her space, she would have seen that the green sea which had been calm and uneventful, suddenly boiled up. Huge waves rolled up and lapped on the shore, and the tender grass on the shore, which had just been finger-length, was soaked with the seawater and immediately grew at a speed visible to the naked eye as if it had been given a stimulant. In the spurt of its growth, they rose over a metre tall. The wind howled through the hills and the leaves from the tree rattled, stretching out their curled-up new leaves against the wind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“How strange. Such strong fluctuations of psychic energy, and then it disappeared all of a sudden.” Xiang Xu said in wonder. It was logical that if the crystal core stimulated the psychic energy in a person, it would maintain the fluctuation of the psychic energy for a long period before it slowly calms down.\nBut instead of that, Gu Ning’s psychic energy fluctuations came and went in a blink of an eye, as if it was just an illusion on her part.\n“How strong is it?” Xiang Yi couldn’t help but ask.\n“If Yan Yu’s psychic energy is a stream and mine is a lake, then Sister Gu Ning’s is…… a sea?” Xiang Xu explained in a bit of disbelief and added: “Even if it’s not a sea, it’s still a lot stronger than mine.”\nXiang Yi was silent for a moment, then asked: “Quickly help me check my current situation.”\nXiang Xu shook her head: “It’s still not enough.”\nXiang Yi couldn’t hide his disappointment, an emotion that was hard to find on his face, a testament to how depressed he was right now: “So how much more will be enough then?”\nThe people who had just fallen into a coma slowly woke up.\nThe first person to wake up was Shi Tou.\nHis first sentences when he woke up were: “I feel like I have a lot of power within my body.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThen he walked over to the wall and punched it.\nThere was a loud thud!\nAll the people in the room widened their eyes in alarm.\nShi Tou’s fist sunk into the white wall cracks spread out on the white wall with his fist as the centre and the bricks underneath it crumbled.\n“It’s a strength-based psychic.” Xiang Xu stated.\nThe soldiers were happy for Shi Tou for a while, after all, Gu Ning had said that the chances of developing special ability were very low but their overall odds as a group were already very high\nThey currently didn’t know the advantages Gu Ning’s news about the crystal cores brought for them. In fact, the first group of people who swallowed the crystal cores were the ones who seized the best opportunities because the later they consumed it, the stimulation it gave on their psychic power decreased, thus lessening the chances of developing special abilities. Also, the “psychic energy storage space” that was initially expanded in the body would reduce and get smaller.\nIt could be said that the earliest group of people who swallowed the crystal cores would gain the best resources and receive the most benefits.\nDuring the wars in the future, the current benefits gained now would become even more obvious.\nAt present, humans were still in a state of complete novelty and exploration of psychic power, thus they didn’t know the depths of these things yet. Even Xiang Xu had only been able to gain some fragmentary insights from those pieces of memories, but she was unable to see the whole picture.\nAfter Shi Tou woke up with a Strength element ability, the soldiers began to speculate excitedly about what kind of special abilities the next person who woke up would gain and how long would it take for each of them to wake up.\nAmidst all that gossiping, Brother San asked with a smile: “Little girl, come and guess, who will wake up next?”\nBrother San successfully drew everyone’s attention to Xiang Xu and they all knew her special ability and were curious if she could guess correctly.\nXiang Xu’s spiritual energy had covered the entire room, so the intensity of everyone’s psychic energy fluctuations was all in her head. She flashed a cute smile at Brother San, and her clear childish voice rang out: “The second one to wake up should be her.” Her small finger pointed to Huang MengYao.\nThe soldiers were curious to see if Xiang Xu’s guesses were correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later, Huang MengYao slowly opened her eyes. All the soldiers exclaimed in wonder.\nIt took no more than twenty minutes for Shi Tou to wake up from his coma.\nHuang MengYao, on the other hand, took nearly an hour to wake up.\nShe felt the psychic energy slowly flowing through her body like a river, then opened her palms as she stared above them without blinking and felt her heart pounding hard. She pursed her dry lips and concentrated slightly, and all of a sudden, a flame appeared above her palm. The moment this flame appeared, her eyes lit up abruptly and an extremely bright smile bloomed on her face.\n“Fire element ability.” Xiang Xu said with a smile, feeling the fluctuation of that flame’s psychic energy before adding with satisfaction: “It’s stronger than that Yan Yu’s.”\nHuang MengYao’s eyes lit up even more.\nSubconsciously, she glanced in Gu Ning’s direction, feeling impatient to show Gu Ning when she woke up.\nA soldier jeered: “Xiang Xu, did you just anyhow guess it? Why don’t you guess again who will wake up next?”\nXiang Xu’s finger directly pointed at Cheng Ming and Jia DaoZhang before replying: “These two, I just don’t know who will wake up first and who will be later.” Their psychic energy fluctuations were not too far apart, so Xiang Xu didn’t know which of these two would wake up first.\nThis time they waited for another half an hour.\nCheng Ming and Jia DaoZhang woke up almost at the same time.\nBrother San couldn’t resist and urged: “Hurry up, hurry! Show us what kind of special abilities you gained!”\nCheng Ming and Jia DaoZhang glanced at each other and both revealed a smile.\nThen at the same time, they took a deep breath.\nSuddenly, there was a wind rising, a harsh gust of wind darted through the crowd, then several wind blades swirled around Cheng Ming with a faint sound of air breaking.\n“Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth…… What kind of special ability is this?!” Brother San asked in surprise.\nXiang Xu also shook her head to indicate that she didn’t know it too.\nCheng Ming scratched his head and said after a slight chuckle: “It should be Wind element?”\n“That should also be a type of mutated element.” Xiang Xu replied then looked at Jia DaoZhang: “What about you, Jia DaoZhang?”\nEveryone shifted their gaze to Jia DaoZhang.\nJia DaoZhang’s slender eyes narrowed into slits with glee at this moment and asked with a smirk: “Don’t you guys feel a little cold in this room all of a sudden?”\nIt was only after he said this, did the crowd notice the drop in temperature within the room all of a sudden.\n“Ice?!” Xiang Yi exclaimed in surprise as he stared at the basin of water where they washed the crystal cores, which had a thin layer of ice formed on the surface.\n“The floor is frozen too!” A soldier shouted in shock.\nEveryone glanced down, and sure enough, a layer of white frost had appeared on the floor at some point, and it was starting to freeze at a rate visible to the naked eye——\n“Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth…… This is another mutated element?!” Brother San said with his eyes widened.\nJia DaoZhang chuckled a few times: “Since it hasn’t been named yet, I’ll call this as Ice element from now on.”\nThen the only ones left were Zhang XiaoBai and Gu Ning.\nThis time, they waited for an hour.\nZhang XiaoBai slowly opened his eyes, looking at everyone’s expectant eyes, he felt somewhat stressed out.\nHe took in several deep breaths before his rapidly beating heart calmed down a little. After taking another breath, he extended his hand, and with a single thought, something appeared in his hand.\nIt was a flickering thunderbolt that swam back and forth in his palm, faintly emitting a bursting sound that was a little bit terrifying even just looking at it.\n“Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth…… another mutated element again?!” Brother San’s voice changed its tone.\n“This just looks so awesome……” said a shocked Luo Long.\n“Why do I feel that the more we wait, the more awesome the special ability becomes?!” Zhong Xu half-heartedly stifled a sentence.\nThen all eyes in the room instantly gathered on Gu Ning who was still unconscious.\nBrother San gulped and said in a daze: “Wouldn’t that make Gu Ning a bully?!”\nThey felt tingly and shocked beyond words just from imagining it.\nLittle did they know that what happened in this humble room today would be remembered in the future as a dazzling legend in post-apocalyptic world history.\nMoreover, today was the start of a legend.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sorry for the late update.

Therefore, when they first forced open the psychic magnetic field inside their body it resulted in such a shocking effect.\n\n\n\nOn the first time, because Gu Ning was alone when she stimulated her powers, the magnetic field shut down after the space had gained enough energy, and those attracted energies that were not absorbed by others vanished in the end.\nThis time, it was also the wrong play and wrong move.\nGu Ning’s black hole magnetic field opened again, attracting an extremely large amount of energy, and after the space had absorbed enough energy, Gu Ning’s magnetic field closed again. Although the energy was not absorbed by Gu Ning, it was absorbed by Cheng Ming and the rest who were opening their own magnetic fields. This caused them to absorb enough psychic energy to expand their capacity of psychic energy storage in their bodies as they stimulated it for the first time.\nWith so many people stimulating their psychic energy at the same time, the magnetic field activated by each crystal core attracted different amounts and types of energies, thus it caused so many special abilities to mutate into new elements.\nThey gained great advantages even though they had made the mistake of relying on Gu Ning’s magnetic black hole.\nOf course, these were things that even Xiang Xu’s spiritual energy could not detect. The only thing that could be ascertained was that stimulating the magnetic field of psychic energy with Gu Ning had brought them great benefits.\nAfter Xiang Xu confirmed the news, Brother San, Luo Long, and Zhong Xu were very regretful. They glanced over to Jia DaoZhang, Cheng Ming and the rest who were curiously exploring their special abilities and all they could do was to hold back their pitiful tears of envy.\nThey wished that they could spit out their crystal cores and try again.\nZhang XiaoBai asked seriously: “Then, in that case, wouldn’t Gu Ning absorb several times more energy than we do?”\n“Well, the psychic energy fluctuations which I had detected from the start within her body were already very strong.” Xiang Xu replied with a slight pause and a slightly confused expression: “Yet Sister Gu Ning’s body seems to be a bit strange, normally the fluctuation of the psychic energy would last until she wakes up, but she seems to have absorbed it all at once while still asleep.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHuang MengYao suddenly asked with some uneasiness: “Last time, she fainted after eating the crystal core too, right? But she didn’t develop powers after she woke up……”\nZhang XiaoBai subconsciously asked: “Then what if Gu Ning didn’t develop her powers this time again?”\n“What about that? Is she not our Gu Ning anymore if she’s without any powers?” Brother San glared at him, then swept his gaze around the soldiers’ faces and said gravely: “I hope you all understand that the majority of the credit, that you guys could develop special abilities today was all because of Gu Ning. I have acknowledged Gu Ning as my niece, thus making her a member of the Third Company. I don’t care about the other people, but I hope that as long as you all consider yourselves to be members of the Third Company, you will treat Gu Ning as one of your own, regardless of whether she has developed special abilities or not.”\nAlthough this speech from Brother San was directed at the soldiers of the Third Company, he was also harbouring the intention of *knocking the mountain to shake the tiger. His meaning was clear, so that Cheng Ming, Jia DaoZhang, and the others would not get too carried away and forget that they had gained so many benefits all thanks to Gu Ning. There was also a vague fear that if Gu Ning didn’t develop her powers, they would just leave her.\n(T/N: 敲山震虎 qiāo shān zhèn hǔ translated as knocking the mountain to shake the tiger means a deliberate show of strength as a warning.)\nWith the rise of special abilities users, ordinary people who had not yet developed their special abilities became vulnerable. Even if Gu Ning was powerful, she was still no match in front of an even more powerful special abilities user. In fact, if Gu Ning really didn’t develop her special ability, then even if she didn’t need to be taken care of, her parents on the other hand who also didn’t have any power, were an unbearably heavy burden. Also, it would be human nature for them to leave them according to the post-apocalyptic situation. Yet Brother San stood in Gu Ning’s shoes and naturally did not want them to leave, which was why he had taken the opportunity to remind the soldiers.\nLuo Long replied righteously: “Brother San, do you even need to say that? I owe my life to Gu Ning, and from now on Gu Ning’s parents will be my parents too!”\nZhong Xu twisted his words and replied with a smile: “Luo Long, when is it your turn huh?  There are so many of us here waiting to be Uncle and Auntie Gu’s son, so get in the line and wait!”\nThe other soldiers all burst into laughter. The atmosphere, which had become tense due to Brother San’s stern words, relaxed once again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSitting beside Father Gu and Mother Gu, Huang MengYao said solemnly to Father Gu and Mother Gu who were also amidst the laughter: “My life was also saved by Gu Ning, even if Gu Ning didn’t have a special ability, I wouldn’t leave.” She made her stand very clear.\nMother Gu kept quiet and just patted on Huang MengYao’s hand, while her eyes were slightly teary. Father Gu also smiled gratefully, he was sincerely happy for Gu Ning. Gu Ning had changed a lot since the apocalypse happened, she was getting more and more silent as days went by, and her strength and bravery were surprising even to them. They had been very worried that being ruthlessly abandoned by Lu JiaZi and the others would cast a big shadow on Gu Ning’s heart and cause her personality to be twisted. They didn’t want Gu Ning to become a cold-hearted person, all they ever wanted was Gu Ning to live a happy life. Yet just as they feared, after their reunion, they could sense that Gu Ning seemed to be more indifferent and cold. There was always a wary look in her eyes.\nHowever, today they suddenly felt a lot more at ease. With such a group of people by Gu Ning’s side, she should be getting better.\nAll the way past lunch, Gu Ning showed no sign of waking up.\nMother Gu and Father Gu were both a little worried, but Jia DaoZhang comforted them and said: “Don’t worry, last time Gu Ning also slept for this long.”\nOnly then did both Father and Mother Gu put their minds at ease for a bit.\nBy three o’clock in the afternoon, Gu Ning woke up.\nSeeing that Gu Ning was awake, those who had been chatting and sleeping all gathered around her at once, asking: “Gu Ning, how is it? Do you feel anything?”\n“Gu Ning, did you develop your special ability?”\n“Do you feel like there was a very wonderful force flowing through your body?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning was surrounded by a group of concerned faces, her heart was touched yet felt helplessness. In the end, she smiled and then shook her head.\nAs Gu Ning shook her head, even the air seemed to be frozen.\nThe crowd suppressed their disappointment that welled up in their hearts and all tried their best to squeeze out smiles and said: “Gu Ning, your marksmanship was so good, and it’s not a big deal if you don’t have special ability. Look at that Yan Yu, her face turned so pale when the gun pointed at her.”\nThe slightly tanned Shi Tou chimed in: “That’s right, that’s right. Even if you don’t have any special ability, you still have us. Our Brother San already said that you are a part of our Third Company, so we will kill the zombies for you, and just taking care of our parents will do!”\n“How did it become your parents again?” Zhang XiaoBai interjected.\nShi Tou replied: “Didn’t we say that Gu Ning’s parents are everyone’s parents? Then aren’t they our parents?”\nJia DaoZhang squeezed to the front and comforted her: “Gu Ning, don’t worry. Just look at Xiang Yi, if once doesn’t work, try it again, if twice also doesn’t work, then try it for the third time, if not, then four times or even five times. The *sincerity splits open gold, and will always succeed in the end. Don’t you agree too, Xiang Yi?”\n(T/N: 精诚所至, 金石为开jīng chéng suǒ zhì ， jīn shí wéi kāi translated as sincerity splits open gold which means with a will, one can achieve anything.)\nXiang Yi’s expression instantly changed a few times, before he squeezed out a sentence in between his gritting: “Spit out my crystal core.”\nAt once, Jia DaoZhang dryly coughed for a little bit and then awkwardly smiled.\n“What are you all gathering here for? The fresh air is all being s*cked by all of you!” Brother San yelled at them, then squeezed himself to the front of Gu Ning and said: “Gu Ning, don’t worry. Since you have called me Uncle San, then I will recognize you as my niece. From now on, you, elder brother, and sister-in-law will all be our main protecting target from Third Company. Even if you don’t have any special ability in the future, as long as I’m alive, I can assure you that no one will bully you.”\nGu Ning didn’t hesitate to trust the promise made by Brother San. Of course, she knew that making such a promise would mean that he wouldn’t hesitate to carry three burdens which would be her and her parents. She glanced at the concerned faces that were vaguely tense and knew that all their various words of comfort were in fear that she would be disappointed and upset because she had not developed her powers. For some reason, the disappointment in Gu Ning’s heart was suddenly swept away, and she suddenly felt very touched and even wanted to cry a bit.\nIn order not to lose her cool too much, Gu Ning smiled and replied: “Won’t you guys show your results to me?”\nAfterward, she learned that everyone but her and her parents didn’t develop any special abilities. Even Cheng Ming, Jia DaoZhang, and Zhang XiaoBai, the three of them had mutated special abilities that seemed so unbelievably powerful.\nGu Ning remarked helplessly: “It seems that I don’t have any psychic energy because of my family’s genetic heritage.”\nWhen Father and Mother Gu knew that Gu Ning was fine, their hearts, which had been worried, finally relaxed and they just smiled helplessly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe crowd laughed very sensibly.\nGu Ning smiled and suggested: “Brother San, today is a great day. Why don’t we celebrate by having something nice to eat tonight?!”\nEveryone’s eyes lit up.\nOf course, they had this intention, but they were concerned about Gu Ning, so they had planned to leave it at that. At this point, seeing that Gu Ning didn’t seem to be faking her happiness, they all relaxed and bickered again about what they wanted to eat this evening.\nHuang MengYao smiled and chimed in: “I can take care of starting the fire.”\nZhong Xu continued: “Then I’ll take care of the water.”\nBrother San helplessly interrupted their giddy division of labour and said: “First of all, we have to get something we can cook to eat, right?”\nGu Ning’s eyes brightened and she smiled: “Brother San, have you forgotten about those chickens that Wang JiZhong keeps in his backyard?”\nBrother San froze for a moment, and when he met Gu Ning’s bright eyes, he instantly understood that Gu Ning was preparing to settle the scores with Wang JiZhong.\nMother Gu suddenly remembered something and asked after looking around: “Ugh. Gu Ning, where’s your Auntie HongJuan?”\nGu Ning stunned: “Isn’t she with you guys?”\nMother Gu replied: “Nope she isn’t. This morning when she saw both of us were worried, she said that she would go to the gate and check if you guys were back. Your father and I were old and forgetful. We were so happy to see that you guys were back then and we assumed that she had followed you all back in and didn’t pay much attention to her. What if something happened to her?!”\nGu Ning instantly had some bad premonition, but still reassured Mother Gu and replied: “It’s probably nothing, what could go wrong. I’ll go out and look for her right away.” Then she passed a wink to Father Gu.\nFather Gu understood and interjected: “I just saw her playing with the kids in the hallway. You didn’t see her. Why not NingNing, you go out and look for her.”\n“Alright.” Gu Ning stood up as she replied.\n“Oh no, oh no!” Suddenly, several young boys rushed in sweating profusely, panting, and reported to the room full of people: “We just saw the red-headed granny at the back playground and she is being taken there! They said she stole something and were going to shoot her!”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sorry for the late update as I was held up in an event yesterday.

We aren’t able to find any reason to destroy him, but he has come to us instead. Gu Ning, let’s go. Let’s go kill them and eat the chicken!”\nHuang MengYao, Xie YuHong and the four soldiers who had stayed behind for guarding.\n\n\n\nEveryone else carried their guns and headed to the backfield.\nWhen they went down to the lobby on the ground floor, they happened to meet Bai Lang and their group who had just returned from the outside.\nIt seemed that they did not return to the colony when they parted previously but had chosen to continue hunting for crystal cores.\nJudging from the smiles on their faces, they should have reaped a good harvest.\nThe moment they brushed past them, Gu Ning saw Yan Yu’s resentful eyes staring straight at her, and Gu Ning’s eyes flickered slightly as her murderous intent grew in her heart.\nXiang Xu whispered: “A few of them are showing fluctuations in their psychic energy, they should have developed it recently.”\nJia DaoZhang asked slyly: “Are there any mutated elements?”\nXiang Xu shook her head and replied: “I’m unable to know that.”\nThe group went straight out of the teachers’ building and into the backfield.\nThe backfield was very crowded at this time, with a number of onlookers gathered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFrom a distance, they saw Wang JiZhong standing on a high platform in the backfield, speaking impassionedly about something. The man next to him had a sharp eye and saw Brother San’s group of people and quickly alerted Wang JiZhong, signalling him to look this way. Wang JiZhong stared at Brother San as they strolled over.\nThe onlookers who had gathered around made way to let Brother San’s group pass.\nA man on the stage was grabbing the hair of the woman and pinned her to the ground on her knees. The woman’s red hair was messy, her mouth and nose were bleeding, her face was covered in blood yet she was still cursing foul languages. When she saw Gu Ning and the others, she immediately stopped cursing and subconsciously took a step forward, before being kicked over.\nLi HongJuan cursed at the man who kicked her after she screamed in agony: “I’ll f*ck your mother!”\nBrother San shouted coldly: “Wang JiZhong, what is the meaning of this? We had agreed, if you lay a move against Gu Ning’s men, then don’t blame me for tearing up the pact!”\nWang JiZhong sneered: “What do I mean? This b*tch came to my place and stole a chicken! I said before, I’ll kill anyone who dares touch my chickens! What b*llshit agreement!”\nLi HongJuan got up from the ground and shouted to Gu Ning: “Gu Ning, don’t listen to this old b*stard! I didn’t steal his chicken! The chickens were running around all over the place, so I didn’t know who kept them! They just caught me like that on purpose to get you into trouble!” Surprisingly, she directly unveiled Wang JiZhong’s little trick.\nLi HongJuan was in a mess, but she was not afraid of Wang JiZhong, and was still sending regards to his ancestors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning didn’t say anything unnecessary and just aimed the gun in her hand directly at Wang JiZhong.\nHowever, at the same time that Gu Ning’s gun was aimed at Wang JiZhong, Li HongJuan had a knife mounted on her neck.\nWang JiZhong opened his arms and taunted Gu Ning; “Come on, shoot, aim properly. Let’s see if I die first or this old woman dies first!”\nLi HongJuan cursed: “F*ck you, you son of a b*tch! You’re the f*cking old woman! You’re even older than me and still calling me an old woman, I sh*t you! Gu Ning! If I die here today, you must kill this son of a b*tch to bury him with me!” Even with the knife at her neck, Li HongJuan was not afraid at all and cursed as much as she could.\nZhang XiaoBai’s mouth opened wide in extreme shock, he asked in awe: “Gu Ning, this neighbour of yours is so feisty! Almost like an idol for me!”\nJia DaoZhang nodded approvingly and marvelled: “Courageous and imposing aura!”\nBrother San was also shocked and speechless.\nFor some reason in the past, Gu Ning was very uncomfortable with Li HongJuan’s foul language at every turn, yet right now she had to admit that she admired her.\nIt’s pretty obvious that Li HongJuan didn’t just start cursing now. The expression of the onlookers was very strange as they watched Wang JiZhong as if he was the clown. They were forced to forget how powerful he was and were trying to stifle their laughter in front of him.\nWang JiZhong’s face turned bluish and purplish before he was unable to bear Li HongJuan’s harsh curses and yelled: “Gag this damn b*tch for me!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Your mother is then the damn b*tch! Your grandmother is a damn b*tch! Your ancestors are all damn b*tches!” You——uh——“\nLi HongJuan’s mouth was gagged with a cloth ball that no one knew where it came from and she was still cursing bitterly in a reproachful manner.\n“Wang JiZhong, are you trying to break our pact?” Brother San asked.\nWang JiZhong gritted his teeth and replied: “When she killed my nephew, why didn’t you say that you broke off the pact first?!”\nBrother San narrowed his eyes and said coldly and solemnly: “Your nephew has been wreaking havoc in the colony under your power, and has even tainted several girls, killing a few innocent people too. Even if Gu Ning didn’t kill him, I would still find an opportunity to eliminate him.\n“Then I’m going to kill her!” Wang JiZhong scornfully pulled out a pistol and aimed it at Gu Ning’s head, going to pull the trigger!\nEverything was happening too fast! Xiang Xu’s pupils suddenly tightened, and then her spiritual energy was originally covered in a net-like shape, instantly condensed into a thin needle-like shape and stabbed fiercely towards Wang JiZhong’s eyebrow!\nJust as Wang JiZhong’s finger touched the trigger, before he could exert strength on it, there was a sudden sharp pain in his head! It was as if a needle had been stuck directly into his brain. Wang JiZhong let out a miserable scream, took a few steps backwards and fell to the ground! The pistol in his hand also fell to the ground.\nThe moment Wang JiZhong fell to the ground, Xiang Xu’s face turned instantly pale and weakly closed her eyes as her tiny body swayed for a moment before falling backwards.\nXiang Yi immediately caught Xiang Xu before she fell to the ground: “XuXu, what’s wrong with you?”\nXiang Xu weakly opened her eyes and shook her head slightly before glancing over to Gu Ning.\nThe moment Gu Ning met Xiang Xu’s gaze she knew it was Xiang Xu who had done it. She gave Xiang Xu a nod before aiming her gun directly at Wang JiZhong’s men on stage who hadn’t reacted yet.\n“Let me do it!” Brother San shouted, then stretched out his hands, five earth spikes appeared out of the thin air instantly, suspended in front of his chest. Then with a push of his hands, those five earth spikes flew out at the same time and shot straight towards the men on that high platform!\nThose men were startled at such a strange scene, although they didn’t know what it was, they had a bad premonition and subconsciously dodged it! The two men who reacted quickly managed to dodge it, but the other three did not and were nailed directly in the stomach by those spikes. The spikes were so strong that half the length of the spikes sank into the flesh, and those men who were hit fell to the ground screaming in agony.\nThe remaining ten or so men knew that things were going south and had their guns drawn out, just then! Suddenly, the wind picked up! A few gusts of wind suddenly swept across the stage with great speed! Several screams were heard, and the sound of guns dropping on the ground at the same time. The men covered their wrists which had been cut by some sharp object and looked as pale as if they had seen a ghost, with warm blood pouring down from their fingers like a stream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Well done!” Jia DaoZhang praised Cheng Ming.\nGu Ning was also a little surprised at the strength of the Wind psychic power.\nCheng Ming’s face was also covered with excitement, he didn’t expect that he could achieve such an effect with his first use of Wind psychic powers, he couldn’t help but glance over at Gu Ning. Seeing Gu Ning was also looking at him with a hint of surprise and appreciative expression, his face suddenly blossomed into a bright smile. This was his most relaxed and heartfelt smile in the post-apocalyptic world. His skin was fair and with a baby-face, the smile curved his eyes, making him look like a smiling Samoyed.\nJia DaoZhang looked at Gu Ning and then at Cheng Ming before silently sighing in his heart.\nThe onlookers were stunned by the sudden end of the fight. While Brother San’s group was unscathed, Wang JiZhong’s men were all injured. Their gazes on Brother San were as if they had seen a ghost and lost the will to fight back.\nGu Ning signalled Brother San with a wink.\nIt was time to clean up the scene.\nBrother San went over to check Wang JiZhong’s condition and found that he no longer had any heartbeat nor breathing, and was already dead.\nGu Ning glanced at Xiang Xu who was quietly crouched on Xiang Yi’s back looking like she was deflated, her gaze was somewhat appalled.\nAlthough it seemed like using this move was extremely costly to Xiang Xu’s special ability, to be able to kill someone so silently had to be considered an extremely terrifying thing. It was so terrifying because they won’t even know how they died, and with just a look, they were dead.\n“Are you alright?” Gu Ning asked worriedly as she looked at Xiang Xu, whose face was very pale.\nXiang Xu’s eyes opened a slit and replied weakly: “It’s just that the psychic energy seems to have been drained all of a sudden.”\nGu Ning took out a transparent crystal core from her pocket: “Eat it.”\nXiang Xu was a little surprised then rejected: “Don’t waste it, I should be fine after a little sleep.”\n“You look very unwell.” Gu Ning said as she directly shoved the transparent crystal core into Xiang Xu’s small mouth.\nThe transparent crystal core immediately melted into a stream of water and entered Xiang Xu’s body, and she instantly felt that the depleted psychic energy in her body was being replenished rapidly.\nHer face also looked much better.\nGu Ning turned to Xiang Yi and ordered: “Take her back to rest first. Leave this place to us.”\nXiang Yi pursed his lips, seemingly having some difficulty in speaking, but still grunted like a mosquito: “Thank you.” The transparent crystal core could have been saved, but she insisted on giving it to Xiang Xu without hesitation just because Xiang Xu looks unwell. And for this generosity, she deserved thanks.\nGu Ning just smiled and reached out to pat Xiang Xu’s head, her voice unexpectedly becoming a little gentle: “Go on.”\nWith that, Xiang Yi carried Xiang Xu down the slope.\nXiang Xu’s hand wrapped around Xiang Yi’s neck, although she still felt a little weak, her voice was happy: “Brother, look, my choice was correct, right? She’s really a good person.”\nXiang Yi skimmed his mouth out of habit but surprisingly did not retort.\nXiang Xu continued with a whisper: “We promised Mum and Dad that we couldn’t go and see them too early, and it’s only now that I feel confident that we can do it.”\nXiang Yi was silent for a moment, then replied: “Hmm.”\nBrother San didn’t kill them all, after confirming Wang JiZhong was dead, he just threatened those people that if he saw any of them doing something bad in the future, there wouldn’t be a second chance. After seeing what Brother San and his men could do, those underlings were scared out of their wits and agreed to run away with their hands covered, for if they didn’t stop the bleeding quickly, they would eventually bleed to death even if Brother San didn’t kill them right now.\n“Auntie HongJuan, are you alright?” Gu Ning squatted down and checked the wounds on Li HongJuan’s face, the corners of her mouth and nose had been beaten and were still bleeding, her body was also bruised and battered. She had obviously suffered a lot.\nHowever, she just smiled and combed her messy hair saying: “As long as I’m not dead, that’s fine”\nZhang XiaoBai squatted on the ground and looked at Li HongJuan admiring: “Auntie HongJuan, you are really my idol.”\nLi HongJuan was not embarrassed at all and boasted: “Cough cough, back when your auntie was still in the 13th street of Jinyong, this son of a b*tch was still hanging around somewhere else. If I hadn’t *washed my hands in the golden basin back then and hadn’t fought for years, I wouldn’t be in such a mess today and let you kids see this joke.”\n(T/N: 金盆洗手jīn pén xǐ shǒu translated as to wash one’s hands in a golden basin means to abandon the life of an outlaw.)\nShe looked like she was in her early forties, usually looking very well maintained, her face didn’t have a lot of wrinkles. Before the apocalypse, she would pay a lot of attention to dressing up, and had been called a vixen by several long-winded women behind her back. At this moment she was sitting quite crudely on the floor, looking like such a mess, and yet the smile on her face carried an unspeakable grace.\nIt was just like how she previously had a knife mounted on her neck but she still dared to break into a tirade. Gu Ning was even somewhat convinced at this point that Li HongJuan had really been a remarkable person when she was younger.\nBrother San, who had been standing by the side without speaking, snapped over when he heard about Jinyong 13th Street, and after staring at Li HongJuan for a long while before he asked: “You wouldn’t…… be Hong Jie, would you?”\nLi HongJuan froze when she heard the title that no one had called her for more than ten years then stared at Brother San for a while and answered: “You recognise me?”\n“You’re really Hong Jie?” Brother San instantly pushed Zhang XiaoBai away and squatted in front of Li HongJuan, asking her in surprise: “You don’t recognize me?! It’s me! Me! Xie AiGuo! Xie AiGuo from the 13th Street in Jinyong back then!”\nLi HongJuan was taken aback by Brother San, after hearing the name she felt it sounded familiar. After thinking about it for a while, she recalled Brother San, and was also surprised and delighted: “Xie AiGuo? How the f*ck did you grow up like that?!”\nEveryone, including Gu Ning, was stunned by these two people who had suddenly come to a scene of meeting with old friends.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hong Jie curses are great hahahaha.

    "51": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-51/\n(This chapter too was dedicated to Paj, I apologize for the delay but thank you for your kind support previously, hope you will enjoy this chapter too. =) )\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Back in the 13th street of Jinyong, Hong Jie led us with machetes and fought all the way from the start of the street until the end of it, the whole street was covered with blood and no one dared to come after us anymore!”\nAt the evening celebration dinner, in an overly excited narrative by Brother San, after he had a few drinks. The crowd learned the story of Hong Jie.\n\n\n\nJinyong 13th street, Gu Ning had also heard about it, that neighbourhood was notoriously chaotic and all parents at home would definitely warn the children not to go to that area. It was named after the thirteen streets that intersect each other, twisting and turning like a maze, so that anyone who did not live in it, or who entered it, would surely get lost. Due to its unique geographical location and low rent, more and more gangsters, prostitutes and drug dealers were established in the thirteen streets of Jinyong. Eventually, Jinyong 13th street had become an immovable stain on the city. Li HongJuan was once a famous female gangster, born and raised on the 13th street of Jinyong. She didn’t become a prostitute or a drug dealer but succeeded in becoming a female gang leader and the most powerful kind of gangster. She had a very common and somewhat rustic name, Li HongJuan, but had another particularly overbearing nickname, Hong Jie.\nAlso, Gu Ning finally knew how her parents plus Hong Jie, the middle-aged trio, made it all the way to the colony safely.\nHong Jie gulped down a mouthful of liquor and sneered after clicking her tongue: “The best gangsters are still gangsters, what was the point?”\nA look of reminiscence appeared on Brother San’s face as he sighed: “Back then, Hong Jie, you said the same sentence and asked me to go to the army.”\nHong Jie glanced at him and replied: “If you hadn’t been told to go to the army back then, you would have rotted in some stinking ditch, and how would you still be here drinking and boasting while having so many underlings?”\n“What underlings, Hong Jie, these are my soldiers, not some gangsters.” Brother San said with some resentment: “Do you think I didn’t know back then that you casually sent me off to be a soldier because you wanted to run off with that man?”\nWhen Brother San spoke of that man, the smile on Hong Jie’s face faintly froze for a moment before she suddenly slapped the back of Brother San’s head and yelled: “You, Xie AiGuo, now you have so many underlings under your hand, you don’t respect me, your old boss, in your sights anymore?”\nRubbing the back of his head, Brother San seemed to realize that he had spoken the wrong topic, so he picked up his glass of alcohol and said to Hong Jie: “Hong Jie, I was wrong! I’ll finish this glass, don’t be angry!” After saying that, he drank that shot of liquor in one gulp and said while gritting his teeth: “This Wang JiZhong, he actually hid so much liquor, too bad he didn’t have the chance to enjoy it, it really is a good bargain for us.”\nHong Jie snatched the glass of liquor from Brother San’s hand and placed it on the table with a clang: “That’s not how you drink alcohol. Don’t you have to go out tomorrow to continue killing zombies? How can you go out if you’re drunk? Stop drinking, eat more meat.” She placed a piece of chicken leg meat in Brother San’s bowl.\nNot sure if Brother San drank too much but he started getting emotional and actually shed tears at the piece of chicken leg meat in his bowl: “Hong Jie, I’ve been looking for you since then. I’ve asked a lot of people to help me locate you, but I couldn’t find you. I didn’t want to do anything, but I just wanted to check on how you are doing over the years and if that man treated you well……”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere at the dining table was a little strange.\nNot to mention Gu Ning, even the soldiers who had been with Brother San for several years had never seen Brother San like this before. They glanced at Brother San and then at Hong Jie with strange expressions on their faces.\nHong Jie didn’t respond to this sudden “confession” from Brother San, she didn’t even raise her eyebrows and after taking a sip of liquor, she glared at the soldiers and ordered: “What are you all looking at? Your boss is drunk, why don’t you all go send him to rest?”\nSeveral soldiers hurriedly went to help Brother San.\nBrother San was really drunk, his face didn’t turn reddish from being drunk, and was just like a normal person. But when the soldiers grabbed him, he made a scene: “I’m not drunk! What are you doing? Are you guys going to rebel?!”\nZhang XiaoBai glanced at Hong Jie helplessly and asked: “Hong Jie, look at this……”\nHong Jie raised her eyebrows and looked quite fierce: “Xie AiGuo, why can’t you go and rest huh? What’s with the drinking? If you pretend to be crazy by drinking again, do you believe I won’t beat you to death?!”\nBrother San didn’t dare make any more noise and let himself be dragged quietly to the room by some soldiers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEveryone, including Gu Ning, sighed in amazement at Hong Jie’s impressive power over Brother San.\nHong Jie stuffed down a piece of chicken and said in a slurred voice: “You think you’re so great after being a b*llshit company commander.” The wound on her face was treated by Huang MengYao leaving a yellow mark from iodine, her red hair was neatly combed and pinned behind her ear. She really didn’t look like the Li HongJuan that had been her parent’s neighbour for the past several years and of course, they didn’t know the “hidden identity” of Hong Jie either. Also, the usually so “mighty” looking Brother San when faced with Hong Jie, he became such a “good boy” which made everyone inexplicable sigh in awe.\nMother Gu couldn’t help but ask: “HongJuan, you really used to be a triad, huh?”\nHong Jie laughed and replied: “What triad. It’s just to mingle and survive on 13th Street. I have no choice, even if you don’t bully others, others will still bully you. Then I just simply choose a side and at least I won’t be bullied by others.” Then she continued: “Sister Jiang, don’t let me scare you. I stopped doing this a long time ago, I’m no different from you now.”\n“I’m afraid of nothing.” Mother Gu smiled, however, she pointed at Gu Ning: “My daughter is as good as you were back then, isn’t she?”\nHong Jie glanced at Gu Ning and replied with a smile: “Much better than me.”\nMother Gu said: “Hmmm, you do have a good temper. In the past, when you quarrelled with those neighbours, I never saw you resorting to violence.”\nHong Jie laughed and replied: “Did you ever see me lose a fight in quarrelling? It’s too much of a bully to fight when you know you’ll win. If I lose an argument, you’ll then see me make my move.”\nMother Gu was stunned for a while before laughing at the response.\nAll the people who had been listening were also amused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn the end, when Hong Jie wanted to clean up the leftovers, the soldiers firmly refused, since even Brother San had to refer to her as Hong Jie, they didn’t dare to let her clean up.\nHong Jie was also happy to be left alone.\nWhen Wang JiZhong died, the building he had occupied naturally went to Brother San.\nThe children had their first full meal since the apocalypse started and they went to bed early after eating with great joy. Wang JiZhong had stocked up on some warm clothes and now the children were covered in them, so they should have a good night’s sleep.\nTaking into consideration that they had to go out hunting tomorrow.\nThe soldiers were all very happy, but at the same time, restrained themselves and didn’t drink too much.\nGu Ning had also drunk a bit this evening, and at this time, lying on top of the blanket spread on the floor, listening to the rustling whispers in the room. With the soft breathing of her parents who were already asleep next to her, she felt very peaceful.\nIn the darkness, she raised her hand to check on the watch. It was only 6 pm, and it was already dark outside. Neither those who had gone out last night nor those who had stayed behind had much rest yesterday, thus it was the right time to go to bed after having a good meal and alcohol.\nShe lightly got up, slowly crossed those bodies in the darkness, and then walked out of the room.\nIn the living room, Hong Jie was still sitting there taking small sips of liquor, not expecting Gu Ning to come out suddenly, she froze for a moment before saying in slight embarrassment: “It’s been a long time since I had a drink to relieve my addiction.”\n“Auntie HongJuan……”\nHong Jie interrupted her: “Just call me Hong Jie just like they do.”\nGu Ning smiled: “Hong Jie, I’m going out for a bit, so I’ll leave my parents in your care. If they ask, please help me explain Hong Jie.”\nHong Jie didn’t ask her what she was going out for, and just replied: “Got it, go ahead and be safe.”\nGu Ning relaxed and smiled a little before saying: “Alright.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAlthough she had been her neighbour for several years, Gu Ning had never spent more than three minutes with Hong Jie, nor did she speak more than ten words at a time. Otherwise, she probably would have been able to spot something unprecedented about her sooner. But perhaps, at that time she didn’t care if Hong Jie was extraordinary in any way. Gu Ning smiled, then walked into the storage room in the backyard, and after locking the door, she entered her space with a thought.\nAfter swallowing that crystal core, she didn’t develop her powers. Having experience from last time, Gu Ning probably guessed the changes would happen in the space instead, but even so, she was still surprised by the grass that grew over a meter high near the shore.\nWith difficulty, she plucked away those grasses that rose as high as her shoulders and when she reached the beach, she tested out the water temperature with her hands. Then she took off her clothes and shoes before stepping into the water.\nWith a leap, she dived into the water like a fish, opening her eyes underwater without any discomfort. After holding her breath for a while, she was amazed to find that she could actually breathe in the water. What a wonderful feeling, it felt as if she had really become a fish, her legs were like its tail, she could swim long distances with just a casual swing. The water was pristine, and it was so deep that it was literally impossible to see the bottom. There were no fishes, corals, plants, sands, or even stones, it was all water and only water.\nXiang Xu had said before that the psychic energy in her body was like a lake, so Gu Ning had a bold guess, was it possible that this green ocean was her psychic energy? Yet after swimming for half a day, she did not find any difference between this water and ordinary water, she couldn’t see anything that made it special.\nGu Ning walked out of the water after swimming for a while, the water droplets on her body slid down her skin and straight to the ground, not a single drop remained on her.\nAfter dressing, she didn’t linger any longer. She adjusted the golden pointer before opening the door and leaving the space. Back in her room, she glanced at the wall clock. It was seven in the morning.\nShe changed into a clean set of clothing before going out.\nFather Gu was reading the newspaper and eating breakfast at the same time, when he heard the door open, he looked up and said: “Come and have your breakfast after washing up.”\nMother Gu chimed in: “Hurry up, it’s better to go early than later. Don’t be late on your first day, or they won’t be happy.” She was obviously very nervous about Gu Ning’s new job.\nGu Ning had come from the post-apocalyptic world and had a particularly strong feeling of peaceful happiness as if the nerves that had been tense in the post-apocalyptic world instantly loosened themselves and she couldn’t help but reveal a smile and reply in an energetic voice: “Yes! I will give it all my best!”\nFather Gu and Mother Gu looked at Gu Ning in surprise, then glanced at each other before laughing.\n“Have you brought everything?! Make sure you make a good impression on your first day there. Teach the children well ah.” Mother Gu sent Gu Ning to the door, and couldn’t help but shout at Gu Ning who was descending the stairs.\n“Don’t worry Mom. Don’t wait for me for dinner tonight.” Gu Ning waved at Mother Gu before disappearing around the corner of the house.\nThe door to the house next to them opened and a middle-aged woman asked in surprise: “Gu Ning found a job so soon?”\nMother Gu smiled and replied: “Yes, it is. A home tutor, and a pretty good deal too.”\n“Aiyo, that’s really good then.” The middle-aged woman smiled and then asked tentatively: “I’ve noticed that there was a man who drove a car to pick up your Gu Ning yesterday, is he Gu Ning’s boyfriend or someone else? I haven’t seen him before.”\nMother Gu was stunned for a while before replying with a smile: “You mean Fang Fa? Oh, that’s our Gu Ning’s friend, not a boyfriend, don’t get them wrong.”\nThe middle-aged woman’s eyes rolled for a moment and she said half-jokingly: “Not a boyfriend, huh? Then if Gu Ning doesn’t like him, can I introduce him to my FanFan then?”\nMother Gu froze for a moment, not knowing how to reply.\nJust as she wanted to excuse herself, she heard a voice interrupting: “Yang DongYan, isn’t your FanFan seeing a guy? Why are you *looking at the pot while eating from the bowl, you want her to *have a foot in two boats? Be careful that she doesn’t split her legs.”\n(T/N: 吃着碗里的还看着锅里chī zhuó wǎn lǐ kàn zhe guō li translated as eating the bowl of food while watching the pot means having something in own hand but also thinking about getting more.\n脚踏两只船Jiǎo tà liǎng zhī chuán translated as having one’s feet in two boats means to cheat on somebody.)\nThe middle-aged woman snapped at the woman leaning against the door while munching on some seeds with a sarcastic expression: “Li HongJuan where did you hear that gossip again? You can eat things randomly but you can’t spurt nonsense. Don’t tarnish our FanFan’s reputation!”\nLi HongJuan emptied all the seed shells into the bin by the door and replied: “Oh, so the woman I saw kissing a man last night when I went down to take out the trash wasn’t your FanFan?”\n“I’m too lazy to talk to you!” Yang DongYan glared at Li HongJuan in annoyance before turning around and slamming the door closed.\n“Mom! You’re meddling again!” A young woman’s impatient voice came from Li HongJuan’s house.\nLi HongJuan gave a smile to Mother Gu before she was ready to enter back to her house.\nMother Gu called out to her: “Alas, HongJuan! Neither Gu Ning nor Old Gu will be back for lunch today, so if you and your daughter don’t mind. I’ll stir-fry two small dishes for us to eat warmly.”\nLi HongJuan froze for a moment, obviously not expecting Mother Gu to invite her for a meal all of a sudden, but seeing the somewhat expectant smile on Mother Gu’s face. As well as Mr. Gu, who usually took the initiative to greet her pleasantly every time he saw her, Li HongJuan unexpectedly was unable to reject her and just nodded in an awkward manner: “Then, thank you for all the trouble.”\n“Wah! Great! Then don’t cook for lunch, wait until I come over to get you guys!” Mother Gu chimed happily.\nLi HongJuan was a bit overwhelmed by Mother Gu’s sudden enthusiasm, so she responded with a few words and went back home, head full of doubts.\n“Why did you suddenly want to invite her over for a meal? Don’t you dislike her?” A somewhat puzzled Gu SiYuan asked when he overheard the conversation that took place outside when Mother Gu returned home.\nMother Gu sighed: “Alas, *one can at most know men’s faces but not their heart. I was wrong to blame her previously, yesterday I heard her arguing with the people in the building next door, over our NingNing.” Mother Gu recalled about what those people gossiped about Gu Ning and got slightly teary before continuing: “In the future, we need to hang out with Li HongJuan and her daughter more, it’s quite sad to be a widow and also having to take care of a daughter.”\n(T/N: 知人知面不知心 zhī rén zhī miàn bù zhī xīn means it is impossible to judge a man’s heart from his looks. )\nGu SiYuan first froze for a while, then shook his head and replied: “You ah, I’ve already said that a woman who hasn’t remarried for an unrelated child for so many years can’t be a bad person. You just listened to other people’s gossip and believed that she was not of good character. How shallow!”\nMother Gu nagged instead: “Ok, ok, ok, I’m wrong, I’m shallow. Gu SiYuan, you have a connotation, you have discerning eyes that could tell one’s greatness, mediocrity, and able to see through others thoughts at a glance. Stop dilly-dallying and put down that newspaper, you’re late for class and you’re still taking your time. Luckily NingNing doesn’t follow you, otherwise, anxiety would kill me.”\nGu SiYuan shook his head helplessly, the topic was once again pulled onto the far end of the sky by Mother Gu.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: 2 bonus chapters for Paj =) Thank you once again for the previous support!

It’s me.” Gu Ning paused, then asked: “That, I wanted to ask about the favour I asked for your help about yesterday……”\nWithout waiting for Gu Ning to finish, Fang Fa interrupted her: “It’s already done, come and collect the money.”\nAfter saying that, he hung up the phone.\nGu Ning stared at the phone in her hand, it felt as if Fang Fa was……angry?\n“What’s wrong with you? What’s with the stinky face this early in the morning? Who offended you?” Lao Li asked slowly as he sat down opposite Fang Fa after fetching some water.\n“Urgh……” Fang Fa sighed, but uncharacteristically didn’t argue with Lao Li, and  instead lay on the table and frowning sadly: “I feel like a fool.”\nLao Li was happy to hear this and jeered with a smile: “Hey! Looks like something big has appeared!”\n“Ugh——“ Fang Fa sighed again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Fang Fa received the call to go out, he had already made up his mind to make it clear to Gu Ning that he would not do such things for her in the future. He felt like an errand boy. If she still asked for help this time, he must firmly refuse her, to let her know that he was not someone who could just come and go, he was also very busy, okay?\nFang Fa was replaying his speech in his mind before he walked towards Gu Ning who was standing in the courtyard.\nBefore he had the time to hand over the plastic bag, Gu Ning snatched a step ahead and handed him a very delicately wrapped paper box.\n“What is it?” Fang Fa stared at the paper box that Gu Ning handed over and subconsciously took it before asking: “It’s for me?”\nGu Ning nodded: “Mm. I bought it when I was passing by the cake shop, I don’t know if you will like it.”\nFaced with Gu Ning’s vaguely expectant gaze, Fang Fa had forgotten that his least favourite food was this creamy and sweet dessert, and he subconsciously replied: “Like the food……”\nGu Ning revealed with a light-hearted smile: “That’s good then.”\nFang Fa paused and handed over the black plastic bag in his hand: “Because you wanted the money urgently, the other party had lowered the price a little, so I guess it will be a little less than the market price. Here is 17,000 yuan. As for the remaining 20,000 yuan, give me your account number so he can transfer it to you.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning took it, holding a thick pile of banknotes, and couldn’t help but sigh with relief. She revealed a smile before pulling out ten of the seventeen thousand dollars and returning them to Fang Fa: “This is the money to pay you back.”\nFang Fa took the money and put it directly into his pocket, then glanced at the black plastic bag that was clutched in Gu Ning’s hand half-jokingly and said: “You’re not going to count it? I’m not responsible for anything that’s missing when it’s out of my sight.”\nGu Ning smiled, then looked at Fang Fa and answered: “Fang Fa, I don’t have many friends, and I’m glad to have a friend like you.”\nFang Fa froze for a moment, struck by the sincerity in Gu Ning’s eyes, he sighed in his heart and replied: “I’m quite happy too.”\nGu Ning smiled and continued: “I’ll be busy lately. When I have time, I’ll treat you to dinner.”\nFang Fa said: “You should buy yourself a mobile phone first…… It’s not even convenient to contact you.”\n“Hmm. Okay. I’ll call you when I get a phone. I’ll go first then.”Gu Ning replied and waved at him, holding onto the plastic bag, and strolled away.\nFang Fa watched Gu Ning walk out the gate, then lifted the paper box and stared at it. Scratching his head, in the end, he didn’t get to say the speech which he had rehearsed in his mind.\n“Hey? Goldie’s cake! I just saw that the little girl is Gu Ning, right? Looks like you’re getting along with her well, and she actually went all the way here to bring you a cake.” Lao Li started gossiping.\nAnother policeman chimed in: “Li, are you talking about the little girl with blonde hair who came yesterday? The one who’s been missing for three months? Fang Fa is dating her? That’s quick ah Fang Fa, well done!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFang Fa replied: “What’s all this nonsense! I just helped her with a favour and she just bought me a piece of cake to thank me okay?”\nAnother policeman interjected while smiling: “Hey Fang Fa, I remember that you don’t like sweet stuff. I was in a hurry and haven’t had breakfast yet, so you can give me the cake.”\n“Get lost, shoo shoo shoo!”\n“Haha, you see, you can’t bear to give it to him huh. Last time another little girl gave you a cake yet you shared it with us, so it all depends on who gave it to you, right Lao Li?”\n“That’s right.”\nGu Ning didn’t delay any longer, hailed a taxi, and headed straight for the army.\nPutting the plastic bag into her backpack, Gu Ning felt her heart slightly relax. If she had the chance in the future, she would get more things over from the post-apocalyptic world and sell them here to get rid of her family’s poverty.\nIt was already slightly past nine o’clock when she arrived at the army.\nBrother San stood at the front door glancing around, his eyes lit up when he saw Gu Ning getting out of the taxi, then whined: “Gu Ning, why are you so slow?”\n“My home is a distance away from here, it takes two hours to travel and I already left home at seven.” Gu Ning explained as she handed over the money she owed Brother San: “This is the money I borrowed.”\nBrother San took the money while rushing her: “Don’t drag any longer, we will be starting a new training program today.”\nGu Ning asked curiously: “What’s the new program?”\nBrother San replied mysteriously: “You’ll know when we get to the firing range.”\nWhen they arrived at the firing range, Zhang XiaoBai and the others all enthusiastically came over to greet Gu Ning and, once again, complained that Gu Ning came way too late.\n“We’ve all shot around, it’s too hard to beat.” Zhang XiaoBai reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning’s curiosity was getting stronger.\nBrother San took the binoculars from Zhang XiaoBai and handed them to Gu Ning and explained: “Wait a minute it’s Zhai Jun’s turn, pay attention and estimate the gap between the two of you.”\nGu Ning took the binoculars and nodded, then looked at Zhai Jun who was standing at attention with his gun.\nGu Ning’s silent arrival added a lot of pressure to the Second Company.\nA soldier gestured to Zhai Jun to look in that direction.\nZhai Jun glanced over and his face turned slightly gloomy.\nThe Second Company Commander Zhang YueGuo’s face was also seemingly grim.\nThe soldiers of the First Company had never seen Gu Ning before, but apparently, they had all been introduced by Zhou ZiLai and were all curious and checking her out for the first time.\nA short while later, one by one, colourful hydrogen balloons rose from a hundred metres away and all eyes gathered.\nGu Ning looked at the hydrogen balloons in amazement, at first she thought they were using a gun to shoot the hydrogen balloons but when she looked at it closely, she could see the fist-sized round cardboard dangling below the hydrogen balloons. The round cardboard was like a target board with a circle drawn on it, it was nearly impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye and only Gu Ning’s mutated eyesight could make out the red dot on it.\nBrother San explained: “That’s what the group of Five Stars Brigade guys was testing last year and made us hit it. Twenty bullets, three of our companies, and the best we hit were six out of ten targets, with only one hit on the bull’s eye.”\nZou Ming said in shame: “Last year I hit four. Now the best score is six.”\nZhong Xu reported too: “Last year I shot five, this year the best I got was eight and the worst I got was one or two of them.”\nZhang XiaoBai smiled cheekily: “I wasn’t here last year. My best score so far was eight and just two shots hit the bullseye but it was also just luck. I couldn’t even see where the bullseye was, the balloon flew too fast.”\nWhen a few of them reported that, Gu Ning immediately felt an invisible pressure.\nAs they were chatting, Zhai Jun had already fired several shots.\nThe process was to hit the piece of cardboard first and then shoot the balloon down. If the cardboard was hit but the balloon flies away, the score won’t be counted in.\nTwenty bullets, ten for the balloon and ten for the cardboard.\nIt’s a must to hit the cardboard first, otherwise, even if the balloon was shot down and missed the cardboard, it won’t be counted in too.\nAll that could be heard were several shots in quick succession, with a pause of about three to five seconds between each shot. The balloons were rising, in about ten seconds they would reach a height of over ten metres. Any higher and further away and they won’t be able to see the cardboard at all. They could only judge and estimate by feeling while looking at the balloons, yet the bullets were limited. One hit was one less, so a balance had to be found between the two. Looking through the binoculars, Gu Ning saw the cardboard dangling in the air and occasionally spinning, making it very difficult to aim indeed.\nIt didn’t take long for Zhai Jun’s twenty bullets to finish, and the balloons that had been burst wobbled and crashed down from the air, with only one balloon wobbling and floating further away. A soldier picked up all the balloons that had been shot down by Zhai Jun and sent them over.\nThe soldiers of the three companies who were eligible for this Five Stars Brigade selection all gathered around and began to examine the marks on the cardboard.\nNine cardboards in total, eight shots hit the cardboard, one empty, one narrowly grazed by a bullet and two shots hit the bullseye.\nThis was considered a very good result but obviously didn’t meet the expectations of the Second Company. This was evident by looking at the expressions of Zhang YueGuo and Zhai Jun.\nBrother San asked: “Gu Ning, what about it? Shall we try it now or watch two more rounds?”\nGu Ning replied: “I probably know what’s going on, let’s practice first.”\nZhang XiaoBai then excitedly handed over a gun and explained: “I don’t think you’ve ever tried this before. Don’t be nervous, relax, it’s not an official test yet.”\nGu Ning took his gun and answered with a smile: “Um, okay.”\nThen she stood at the yellow line.\nShe tried to aim first, adjusting to the feel of it before nodding to the soldier who was holding a small flag.\nThe soldier then raised the flag and swung it down.\nA hundred metres away a red hydrogen balloon flew straight up and everyone waited with breathless anticipation for Gu Ning’s first shot.\nThe yellow piece of cardboard was reflected incomparably clear in Gu Ning’s pupils, and she aimed at the red dot in the very centre before pulling the trigger without the slightest hesitation.\n“Bang!” Gu Ning’s first shot rang out.\nBrother San held up his binoculars and clearly saw the piece of yellow cardboard being blown by the strong wind brought up by the bullet, which brushed against the cardboard and missed the mark.\nBrother San couldn’t help but exclaim with regret: “It was so close!”\nWhen Zhang YueGuo, the Second Company Commander, saw Gu Ning’s first shot fall short, his expression eased a little and he sneered: “Not even a close one Lao Xie.”\nGu Ning had already isolated herself from the outside world, she was fully concentrated on shooting. From the moment the shot fell short, a lot more information came into her mind, she adjusted her state according to the information and aimed at the piece of yellow cardboard again. This time, the second balloon had already flown up.\nZhang XiaoBai couldn’t help but shout: “Leave the first one alone! The second one has risen!”\nAlthough everyone was dissatisfied with Zhang XiaoBai for shouting and interrupting, everyone, including Brother San, thought that this was the time to give up on the first balloon, which had floated too high.\nOn the contrary, Gu Ning wasn’t affected by Zhang XiaoBai’s shout and just focused on her aim. The gun moved slowly with the rising balloon and then pulled the trigger——\nBang! Bang! Two gunshots rang out in quick succession, no more than a second apart.\nAfterward, the burst balloon came crashing down from the sky with its cardboard.\nNo one bothered to look at the burst balloon, all eyes were locked at the second balloon. By this time, the third had also taken flight and the soldier was already preparing to release the fourth.\nOne in front of the other was just a metre apart.\nThe crowd held their breath.\nGu Ning focused.\n“Bang!” “Bang!” “Bang!” ——\nSuccessive shots rang out, accompanied by the bursting and falling of a balloon one after another. Apart from the first balloon, none of the remaining balloons soared more than ten metres high and the time between each shot didn’t exceed two seconds.\nThis speed was considered fast even for a normal target shooting, let alone shooting such difficult moving targets. Until the last balloon crashed to the ground, the soldiers were still overwhelmed by the events that just transpired.\nThe soldier in charge of picking up the balloons picked up all ten of them and ran from a distance under the stressful gaze of more than twenty people who were glaring at him.\nThen one by one, they began to check them.\nEvery time they counted, everyone was getting quieter each minute. One after another, some had half of the cardboard shot away, while others only had the part where the string was attached to. Although not every bullet hit the bullseye as compared to the soldiers who had been trained regularly, this was Gu Ning’s first time to participate in such a program! And she had already achieved such a result!\nThe soldiers were already too shocked to speak, to be precise, they didn’t know what to say to express their shock and disbelief at this moment.\nIt was only after a few moments that Zhang XiaoBai shifted his gaze from the pile of burst balloons to stare at Gu Ning and said in shock: “Gu Ning, you are simply a god!”\nZhong Xu added: “How divine.”\nZou Ming said bitterly to Brother San: “Company Commander, why don’t I return to my training tomorrow, I feel like I have don’t anything to do here anymore.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Wooots chapter for this week.

In the end, he took Gu Ning to the canteen for lunch instead of having it in the restaurant.\nThe army canteen at noon could be described as bustling with activity, with over 300 people gathered in a canteen.\n\n\n\nAt Gu Ning’s table, they had lost count on the number of people that had been deliberately passing by just to check out the legendary marksman. Some of them were too embarrassed to stare at her for too long, so they purposely circle a few more times. They were all shocked when they saw that Gu Ning was as young as the “legend” had claimed and she was a very feminine-looking beauty.\nThe soldiers of the Third Company felt so proud while expressing their sincere admiration for Gu Ning’s ability to remain calm while eating her meal without looking away under such intense scrutiny.\nBrother San suddenly broke the silence: “Gu Ning, I’ve noticed that it’s too much of a waste of time for you to travel here and there in the morning and evening for more than four hours. We have a building for families here, why don’t you let your parents know and then stay here for the next few days? If you’re afraid, I’ll have Zhang XiaoBai and the others to stand guard for you at night.”\nGu Ning considered this proposal from Brother San very carefully. The four-hour round trip drive was indeed a waste of time, and staying over here would be much more convenient. However, on her parents’ side, she would have to lie and muddle through—— Gu Ning couldn’t help but hesitate a little.\n“That’s right Gu Ning, you need to put all your heart and soul into the training now. It’s fine if we get abused by you, the Five Stars Brigade is more ruthless than the others, so you can’t take it lightly.” Zhang XiaoBai finished with a sincere face and chuckled dryly before asking: “If you have time, you can also teach me too. If we both join the Five Stars Brigade, at least we can take care of each other, right?”\nThere was a chorus of agreement from the soldiers of the Third Company, all were eager to make Gu Ning stay.\nGu Ning hesitated for a moment, then replied: “Actually, I told my parents that I’m working as a tutor, and I didn’t tell them what I was doing in the army.”\nBrother San was stunned for a moment and said: “That’s okay, pass me your parents’ number and I’ll talk to them.” As he said that, he pulled his mobile phone out of his pocket and continued: “Gu Ning, please don’t be offended, but I’ve already gathered all the information about your family. All your family background, I went through them all. Believe me, I can handle your parents.”\nIt seemed that she had been investigated to the fullest, Gu Ning didn’t feel uncomfortable at all as she fully understood that this was a normal procedure. Yet after careful consideration, she still replied: “Give me some time to consider it, I will give you an answer tomorrow.”\nBrother San also understood Gu Ning’s concerns and put his phone away while the conversation switched to the topic of training: “I’ve received news last night that the Five Stars Brigade already arrived in Jinyong a long time ago, and now they are nestled in a hotel. According to reliable sources, the group of people who are coming this time is not the same as those who came last time. Also, the people who are coming this time seem to have an important person from the Five Stars Brigade.” He paused and glanced at Gu Ning with some solemnity: “This also means that this year will probably be even harsher than the previous years.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn the heavy silence, Zhang XiaoBai suddenly came over and chimed in: “Company Commander, where on earth did you get that reliable information? It’s not a deliberate attempt to scare us, is it?”\nBrother San pressed Zhang XiaoBai’s face back to his seat, then continued to explain to Gu Ning: “Although I have faith in you, those people from the Five Stars Brigade…… I can only say that they are really powerful, beyond what you can imagine. Not to mention, the ones who are here this time are the big shots in the Five Stars Brigade.”\nZhong Xu said with a solemn expression: “The group of them that weren’t even important last year were already beating us up.”\n“And last year the group didn’t look straight in other people’s eyes. They had their eyes up in the sky and were so arrogant and proud. This year there are important people, so they might be snobs as well.” Luo Long said.\nBrother San continued indifferently: “Last year, there was a soldier in the First Company who was particularly good at close combat, he used to be a top student in the military school. However, when he fought with those Five Stars Brigade group last year, he broke his hand and spent half a year in the hospital. He went back to the military academy for postgraduate studies afterward.”\nZhang XiaoBai listened with a bit of fear: “You guys, please don’t bully me and Gu Ning for not knowing anything, they can’t be that ruthless, right?”\nZhong Xu glanced at him and replied: “You’ll know when that time comes.”\nBrother San interjected: “So the next few days will be intense training, which is why I want you to stay in the family building.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning nodded solemnly then replied: “Well, I will seriously consider it.”\nBrother San left and didn’t accompany them for the afternoon training.\nZhang XiaoBai mysteriously whispered to Gu Ning: “Gu Ning, do you know? Our company, including you, as long as one of us is selected to be in the Five Stars Brigade, then there will be a bonus of 100,000 for the Company Commander. The company will also receive another bonus, so if we both get selected, our Company Commander will be rich! Let’s make a deal first, later on, we’ll join forces to knock a big deal out of the Company Commander and make him treat us all to have a seafood meal at a big restaurant in the city okay?”\nGu Ning was a little stunned, while in her heart, she had vaguely felt something was off with the Five Stars Brigade, what kind of organization was it? However, when she asked Brother San about it, Brother San only vaguely replied that she would naturally know after she had entered the Five Stars Brigade and that if she didn’t enter it then she wouldn’t need to know. In other words, she could only find out what kind of organization it was only when she entered the Five Stars Brigade.\nGu Ning felt a little helpless, not even knowing exactly what the Five Stars Brigade was and she just barged ahead. Yet in the post-apocalyptic world, everything evolved so quickly and she hasn’t developed her powers. If she was unlucky, there would be a good chance that she would never develop them, so close combat skill was what she needed to survive and the Five Stars Brigade was where she must go.\nThe afternoon’s intense training had Zhang XiaoBai and the rest screaming in agony, but Gu Ning was still fine. Luo Long was responsible for dropping her off after bidding goodbye to Brother San, she alighted the truck a block away from the neighbourhood.\nIt was already half-past six, and while it’s hard to see at this time of the year in the post-apocalyptic world, the sky was still very bright here and the streetlights were just coming on.\nGu Ning stopped in her tracks as she passed a shop selling mobile phones, remembering the instructions from Fang Fa, she walked in.\nWhen she came out she was holding an old Nokia with a special price of 199, a phone she had used in high school and had a sense of familiarity with. After buying another card she sent a message to Fang Fa and Brother San. Then kept her phone in her pocket and headed home.\nThe neighbourhood where Gu Ning’s house was located was a bit old, and in front of the newly built high-rise buildings, her neighbourhood suddenly looks very old and worn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBelow her house, there was an old laurel tree that was even older than Gu Ning, and during this time of the year, the fragrance of the flowers was strong. A man was standing quietly waiting under the tree, wearing a light blue shirt, his suit jacket resting on his arm, standing in a straight posture, and he seemed to have been waiting for a long time. There was a vaguely annoyed expression shown between his brows.\nWhen Gu Ning saw Lu JiaZi standing there, she wavered for a moment, remembering that when she used to go to school, Lu JiaZi would occasionally wait for her under this laurel tree. That time she was just so happy to see him that she didn’t notice the impatience hidden between his eyebrows.\nGu Ning just stood there quietly looking at this man she used to like so much, her mood was a little bit complicated. She kept staring until Lu JiaZi felt her gaze and with an unconscious turn of his head, he was a little bit surprised to see Gu Ning standing there quietly: “Gu Ning?” Another smile: “Peeking at me?” Then the smile on his face was frozen by the coldness of Gu Ning’s expression: “Did something happen?”\nGu Ning shook her head and asked: “Are you looking for me?”\nLu JiaZi walked towards Gu Ning and replied: “It’s been a while since we’ve gone for dinner, today I’ve managed to call off a dinner party and I wanted to have dinner with you but I didn’t know you weren’t home yet. I’ve been waiting here for half an hour, let’s go and eat then. I’ve booked a new restaurant, I heard it was good…… Gu Ning?” He took a few steps before realizing that Gu Ning wasn’t following him and he stopped in his tracks in surprise.\nGu Ning replied: “I’ve eaten.”\nLu JiaZi first froze, then strolled up to Gu Ning, sighed deeply, and then said in a helpless tone: “Are you angry with me? NingNing, I’ve been really busy lately, the company has a new project handed over to me and I’m really too occupied. It’s difficult to find time and I’ve wanted to have dinner with you, so just for the sake of me waiting for you for half an hour, will you go with me?”\nHaving known Gu Ning for over ten years, Lu JiaZi thought he knew Gu Ning very well. Although she seems stubborn and determined, almost everyone who knows Gu Ning knows that she was an extremely principled person and hated whoever was late. However, he was special, he held a different meaning to Gu Ning since he was a child and Lu JiaZi was well aware of this and confident of it at the same time. Yet this time, Lu JiaZi felt that something was wrong. Instead of frowning and pretending to be unhappy, or complaining a bit before she would happily come over and take his hand. Gu Ning just stood there quietly, as if she was meeting him for the first time, and staring at him very seriously and quietly.\nThis kind of sizing up of a stranger suddenly gave Lu JiaZi a tug in his heart.\nJust as he was about to frown and show his displeasure, he heard some words from Gu Ning.\nThere was just a gust of wind blowing by when he heard it, causing him to feel surreal, perhaps he had misheard it? Otherwise, how could Gu Ning say such a thing?\nShe said: “I don’t like you anymore.”\nFor many years in the past, Gu Ning had never concealed her love for Lu JiaZi, and she even made her first confession to him when she was just sixteen. Even though her confession was politely rejected by Lu JiaZi at the time with the reason being that children shouldn’t fall in love so early.\nAfter that, Gu Ning never said she liked him again, but Lu JiaZi always knew that she still held feelings for him. She also said that she didn’t like him anymore after he had his first girlfriend after entering university. They were walking in school holding hands when Gu Ning bumped into them when she was looking for him at school. After which, Gu Ning called and cried while telling him that she didn’t like him anymore either. Yet he knew that she still liked him, such a declaration of dislike was made by her twice in total, both times after she knew he had a girlfriend.\nOn the contrary, it seems to be different this time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHe didn’t have a girlfriend now, but Gu Ning said she didn’t like him anymore.\nSuch a calm, cold, sensible Gu Ning, he had never seen her like this before…… Lu JiaZi suddenly felt that this face that had been constantly barging into his line of sight for the past ten years or so had suddenly become somewhat unfamiliar.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: This Lu JiaZi really took Gu Ning for granted…. geeeshh… Alright, thank you all for reading! Love ya!)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "54": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-54/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning looked at Lu JiaZi and continued: “If it’s possible, I think it’s best if we stop seeing each other again in the future.”\nShe spoke so calmly without the slightest hint of anger or reproach.\n\n\n\nWhen he saw Gu Ning with such calmness, Lu JiaZi felt a sense of powerlessness that he couldn’t do anything about it. He rubbed his brows, a little inexplicably annoyed but still patiently said to Gu Ning: “NingNing, I don’t know what happened in the past three months when you went missing….. I shouldn’t have come today and should have let you rest longer……”\nGu Ning suddenly seemed to remember something and asked: “How far have you progressed with Jiang Yu?”\nLu JiaZi froze for a moment, but his furrowed brow suddenly relaxed, and his tensed nerves slowly loosened as he smiled helplessly and replied: “Is that why you’re angry with me?” It had to be said that Lu JiaZi was very good-looking, and when he smiled like this, it was easy to give off the illusion that he was pampering the other party like a lover with infinite tolerance.\nWhen he saw that Gu Ning was still silent, he made a gesture of raising his hands in surrender and then explained: “I haven’t made any progress with her, the last time we met was during your birthday last year at your house and you were the one who asked me to send her back. Afterward, she asked for my number. We had a few calls occasionally but it was mainly for some advice on her work……”\n“She asked me out to talk about your disappearance after you went missing, but after that, I haven’t seen her again until now. She did show a desire to take things further with me, but Gu Ning, you know that I’m very busy and I don’t have any time for relationships. Also, she’s not my type, so there’s absolutely no need for you to worry over someone unrelated to our relationship. If you’re still unhappy, I will never pick up her calls again…..” Lu JiaZi subconsciously paused after saying this, his brows knitted suddenly, stunned that he actually made such a promise just because of Gu Ning’s little temper……\nGu Ning replied seriously: “I’m not unhappy. If you two can be together, I am genuinely happy for both of you. I’m not joking or angry, Lu JiaZi, I really don’t like you anymore.”\nShe had been curious about it, as the only time Lu JiaZi and Jiang Yu ever crossed paths was when they happened to meet once on her birthday last year, and how they developed into such a relationship, later on, was strange.\nAnd finally, now, it has been resolved. It turns out that Jiang Yu already had her eye on Lu JiaZi since that one time they met and wanted to take things further with him even when she fully knew well that Gu Ning had liked him for so many years.\nRecalling those little details, on the times Jiang Yu asked Gu Ning stories about her crush, Lu JiaZi, out of curiosity, she was probably deliberately trying to get more information about Lu JiaZi out of her.\nIn fact, if she had been a bit more sensitive at that time, Gu Ning would have been on her guard. However, she didn’t know if Jiang Yu’s tactics were too superior or if she believed too much in her sisterly love with Jiang Yu…… It would not have dawned on her if the apocalypse didn’t arrive or until the day she saw the two of them were holding hands in front of her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHowever, at this moment, listening to Lu JiaZi’s words, it seems that he had indeed not yet progressed to that stage with Jiang Yu. When Gu Ning was reborn, she didn’t even have the slightest thought of breaking them up for revenge. For her, Lu JiaZi and Jiang Yu were really compatible. She was too busy strengthening herself to survive properly in the post-apocalyptic world and really couldn’t spare any time and brainpower to devise revenge. As long as they stay far away from her and don’t pop up now and then, all would be good.\nGu Ning had even thought about it, that once she was wealthy, she would move her house and stay far away from these people. Preferably to cut off all ties with them.\nLu JiaZi was silent for a long time, he gazed fixed on Gu Ning who was under the laurel tree, staring at her familiar yet somewhat unfamiliar face, and suddenly asked: “Is it because of the man who accompanied you to the hospital that day?”\nGu Ning froze for a moment before she realized that he was referring to Fang Fa, she knew that Lu JiaZi must have misunderstood. Gu Ning hesitated for a moment before answering: “No.” She didn’t want to bring unnecessary trouble to Fang Fa.\nOn the contrary, Gu Ning’s slight hesitation made Lu JiaZi suspicious, he frowned slightly but didn’t dwell on it and said: “I know you’re tired, I heard from Auntie that you’re now working as a home tutor that pays well. But it’s not something you can do in the long run, what I’ve offered last time at the hospital still stands……” He didn’t give Gu Ning a chance to refuse but continued: “You don’t need to reject me in a hurry, I hope you can think it over, even for the sake of your parents, you need a more stable job. If you’ve thought about it, give me a call.” He paused before continuing: “My Dad knows that you’re back and has asked me a few times to bring you back for a visit. You know he hasn’t been well in recent years and it’s not easy for him to get around, so when you do have time, do come over and visit him…..Well then, you should go back now.”\nGu Ning then opened the gate and went back, not even bothering to bid goodbye.\nThis was the first time Gu Ning had turned away first in front of Lu JiaZi.\nAfter Gu Ning had left, Lu JiaZi stood under the laurel tree for a little while longer before driving off in his car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“You’re back.” Gu Ning received a warm welcome from Mother Gu as soon as she entered: “Have you met JiaZi downstairs?”\nGu Ning gave a muffled acknowledgement, then collapsed on the sofa.\nMother Gu continued: “I heard from him that their company has a position available for you to apply for, did he tell you about it?”\n“I’ve told him that I’m not going.” Gu Ning sat up from the sofa, then looked seriously at Mother Gu and Father Gu before explaining to them: “Dad, Mom, I don’t like Lu JiaZi anymore. To avoid any unnecessary trouble, I’m not going to contact him again in the future. I’m satisfied with my job for now, and it’s quite stable in the meantime. I will keep a lookout for a better job if available.”\nMother Gu was stunned for a moment, not expecting to hear this from Gu Ning, then she replied with a sigh: “If you don’t like him, then forget about him. You’ve liked him for so many years anyway, and he never even said he liked you. If he really liked you, you would have become his girlfriend a long time ago. Although JiaZi is good, my daughter is not bad either. I think Xiao Fang is quite good, and he is very active in introducing you to jobs too. If you two can make it work, it will be fate.”\nFather Gu pushed up his glasses and chimed in: “You should lessen your visits to the Lu family. Although his parents like you, since you don’t like him anymore you should keep some distance from his family too. Better to draw a line now than later.”\nGu Ning wasn’t expecting Father Gu and Mother Gu to have such a reaction and she couldn’t help but ask: “I always thought that you all wanted me to be with Lu JiaZi.”\nMother Gu explained: “Yes, we hoped. He’s not only good-looking but also highly educated and now has a successful career. And, his parents like you so much so you won’t have to worry about the relationship between you and your mother-in-law in the future. However, no matter how good he is, there is always a problem. Your dad always felt that JiaZi is too scheming and was unable to gauge his underline. You like him more than he likes you, and we were afraid that you would be at a disadvantage. In the past, we didn’t mention any of that because you were so fond of JiaZi and wouldn’t listen to anything we said, but now that you say that you don’t like him anymore, we’re very relieved.”\nShe changed the subject and went back to Fang Fa: “But Xiao Fang seems to be a very honest person, nice and sweet, especially with that sunny smile! It makes people happy. Seriously, you should consider him.”\nGu Ning stood up helplessly and rebutted as she walked back to her room: “What, consider him, it’s not as if he likes me. Mum, you are overthinking.” After saying that, she went into her room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMother Gu was still a bit unconvinced: “What doesn’t like you? If he doesn’t like you, why did he come to our house on purpose? I think Xiao Fang is very nice. If he were to become my son-in-law, I would bring him out everywhere.”\nFather Gu shook his head and shrugged while continuing to watch his TV.\nThe door shut out the voice of Mother Gu nagging, and the bedroom was Gu Ning’s personal space. She went to her desk and launched her computer, which she hadn’t touched for over three months. She searched for “Five Stars Brigade” quickly.\nGu Ning searched around the internet for at least ten pages, and all that came up from the search was a mess of locations, some taobao shops, or guilds, or five star villages, and so on. All were random things with no useful information that she required.\nShe didn’t hold too much hope, yet she just wanted to try and search to see if she could find any information. Gu Ning wasn’t too disappointed when she didn’t find any either.\nIt was still night time in the post-apocalyptic world right now. She still had long hours to spend over here, and Gu Ning unexpectedly found herself with nothing to do at this point. This made Gu Ning, who had been in a state of urgency since her rebirth, feel a little at loss. She had been detached from being an ordinary person for so long that it was uncomfortable to be idle all of a sudden.\nShe leaned back in her chair and sat quietly for a moment, then braced herself and began to search the vast online world for some cold weapons.\nShe typed and searched for cold weapons.\nThe first suggestion was an advertisement for a cold weapon shop promotion.\nThe second suggestion was a cold weapon thread.\nGu Ning clicked on the cold weapons posting page.\nAfter a quick browse, Gu Ning didn’t find the information she was looking for. Before closing the webpage, she spotted a post with the title “Private collection, please enter if you can appreciate it.”\nThe mouse arrow moved away from the x in the top right corner and then clicked into the thread.\nThe ground post started with the owner sprawling out a lot of great information about the swords in his collection.\nThen the second post started to upload lots of pictures.\nA series of photos chained down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMostly were swords, and a few oddly shaped weapons.\nFinally, the owner started to say that he recently had some financial issues and decided to sell the weapons at a low price and that anyone interested should contact him. He left an email address at the end.\nThe messages that follow were all from the owner.\nFor example, “No one? Does no one really want it?”, “Just this once, you won’t regret it!” or something along that line.\nHowever, no one seemed to be interested and only a few people replied to the post stating that the knives and swords looked nice or pretty and so on.\nAfterward, the owner never appeared again.\nGu Ning noticed the posting time was half a month ago.\nShe shifted her mouse again to swipe over those pictures above, she had her eyes set on the oddly shaped knives on the third picture. Two knives with hilts combined that could be used in combination or separately. The owner’s comment on the knives was that they were very sharp to the point of severing hairs in just a casual swing and extremely deadly.\nShe checked the email address then logged on to her email and sent a message regarding that knife.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Alright a short chapter!

    "55": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-55/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter sending the email, Gu Ning started to fret again.\nShe was unsure of what she should do now.\n\n\n\nAt this very moment, the message ringtone on her phone rang, it was a reply from Brother San: `Roger. Have you discussed that matter with your parents yet?`\nOnly then did Gu Ning remember that she hadn’t told her parents about moving out yet.\nShe thought for a moment, then found Fang Fa’s number and dialed it.\nFang Fa happened to be back from work, after he came out of the shower, he received a message from Gu Ning. He took the phone and thought for a long time, hesitating whether to return a cool message or just call her but he didn’t know what to chat about if he called…… Just as he was still hesitating, his phone rang and Gu Ning’s name was flashing on the screen.\nHe deliberately waited after three rings before picking it up: “Hello?” In his mind, he wondered if they were once *telepathic lovers whose hearts were closely linked?\n(T/N: 心有灵犀一点通 xīn yǒu líng xī yī diǎn tōng means like thinking are alike, telepathic etc. yet in this context, it was more of like a lover’s who had dated for a long time, knew what each other were thinking about.)\nGu Ning got straight to the point: “It’s like this……”\nBefore Fang Fa could get too depressed over the fact that Gu Ning phoned him because she had something to ask from him, he sat up violently from the bed and asked in astonishment: “Wait, you mean you’ve passed the preliminary test for the army now?”\nGu Ning replied calmly: “Yes. Because my house is too far away and it would be a waste of time going back and forth. Also, the follow-up training is very important so, for my parent’s side, I would like you to help me to cover it up.”\nFang Fa swallowed dryly before agreeing: “That’s no issue, tell me first, how did you pass the preliminary test?”\nGu Ning on the other end of the phone paused before replying: “Actually, my marksmanship is quite good.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHow good of marksmanship did one have to have to be selected by the Five Stars Brigade? Fang Fa didn’t understand the concept but he only knew that when he was still in the military school, the top shooting champion at the school was abused by the Five Stars Brigade when they came to the school for selection.\nHe was a bit speechless for a while, as far as he understood Gu Ning’s family background, her father was a teacher and her mother was just a housewife. Gu Ning grew up and went through college and then graduated. There was no shooting hobby and the only questionable thing was her three-month long disappearance in the past. Yet within just three months, it couldn’t turn a girl who had never touched a gun before into a marksman, right?\nHe still remembered the first time when he saw Gu Ning on the roadside covered in wretchedness and looking dazed…… Fang Fa could not bear to pry into what had happened to Gu Ning during those three months. Thus, he didn’t ask anything else and just said: “If you do get into the Five Stars Brigade, I only have one request.”\nGu Ning asked: “What?”\nFang Fa replied: “Treat me to a big meal.”\nGu Ning was stunned for a moment then smiled before agreeing: “Deal.”\nFang Fa continued: “Well, then if there are any problems with uncle and auntie, let them know that they can call me anytime.”\n“Alright. Thanks. Bye.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Goodbye.” Fang Fa replied, and then hung up the phone. He collapsed on his bed with the phone in his hand and stared at the ceiling, still feeling a little unbelievable.\nAfter hanging up the phone with Fang Fa, Gu Ning walked out of her room and talked to her parents: “I want to discuss something with the both of you. It takes me almost an hour and a half to get to the class, and that’s three hours’ worth of round trip. I was late this morning, and the students’ parents have talked about this problem. So I’m planning to rent a house near there so it will be more convenient.”\nMother Gu reacted fiercely: “How can you do that? It’s so unsafe for you to live alone! No, no, I don’t agree.” Thinking back the past three months when Gu Ning had suddenly disappeared, it was understandable for Mother Gu to be so worried.\nGu Ning had guessed Mother Gu’s reaction and replied: “I have considered this and asked Fang Fa, he said that he found a house for rent near his and it was a shared room with two other girls that are university students. Three rooms and one living room, monthly cost around a thousand five hundred, Fang Fa had accompanied me to check the surroundings and it was quite nice. The two girls are very nice to talk to and Fang Fa was also in that same neighbourhood. Thus, we can look out for each other too.”\nOnce Mother Gu heard that it was in the same neighbourhood as Fang Fa, her attitude immediately loosened up: “So it’s quite good then…… and how far is it from the family where you’re teaching?”\nGu Ning answered: “It’s a ten-minute walk from the neighbourhood, so it’s particularly convenient. Also, because it was so convenient and safe that’s why I’m so tempted to move there in the meantime.”\nMother Gu glanced over at Father Gu, ready to listen to his opinion.\nFather Gu spoke: “I don’t have any problem with that, Gu Ning is already old enough to know how to handle it herself.”\nMother Gu hesitated for a moment and asked: “So when do you plan to move?”\nGu Ning knew that this meant Mother Gu had agreed, and after letting out a sigh of relief, she answered: “I’ll move over tomorrow, I’ve already spoken to them, everything’s been prepared. It’s very convenient, all I’ll need is to bring a quilt and a change of clothes. “\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMother Gu continued: “Since I’ve nothing to do tomorrow at home, I’ll help you with the moving.”\n“No need.” Gu Ning hurriedly interjected: “I’ve already asked Fang Fa to pick me up.”\nMother Gu immediately perked up upon hearing this: “Loot at you, look at you… You still say that Xiao Fang doesn’t like you, if he doesn’t like you, why will he be so helpful? Both of you have only known each other for a few days.”\nGu Ning replied while strolling back into her room: “Fang Fa is just a police officer, it’s just his professional instinct. So mum, just don’t misunderstand that all the men in the world like your daughter, okay?”\nMother Gu surrendered: “Then we must agree that you must come back home at least once a week.”\nGu Ning replied: “I’ll fight for it.” Then she entered her bedroom.\nShe sent a message to Brother San to get the room ready for her before she sat down in front of the computer and saw a new email.\nThe email address was from the owner of the weapon post, Gu Ning didn’t expect him to reply to the email so quickly and immediately came back to her senses and clicked opened the email.\n“You all used to ignore me! Today I’ll let you all feel the same! I’m not going to sell my knife! ! ! Muahahahahaha!”\nLooking at this line of a deliberately enlarged and bolded font. Gu Ning froze for a moment and burst into laughter, what kind of person was the other party that would write such a childish reply?\nShe thought for a little while and replied to the email back with a single word.\nOh.\nThen Gu Ning left him alone, she hadn’t held out much hope on this either.\nGu Ning sorted out her luggage, which was actually really simple. Two sets of sportswear and a few thick jackets and that’s all she would be bringing. The time was only seven o’clock, very early. Gu Ning decided to head out for a stroll and some shopping.\nAfter leaving the room, she gave her phone number to her parents and informed them that she would go out for a stroll and call her if they needed anything. She then went down the stairs with her purse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs resources were scarce in the post-apocalyptic world, Gu Ning went out and turned left then right to a nearby night market.\nThe night market was just starting, with the sound of music and promoting sales coming out of the speakers and the street shops hanging up big posters of huge clearance sales.\nThe first thing that Gu Ning shopped was the place that sold winter jackets. There was a pile of long black men’s jackets on the floor, which was the style of many companies’ winter security uniforms, all at a special price of eighty yuan apiece. Gu Ning touched them and felt that they were quite thick and took twenty of them for fifty yuan apiece after bargaining with the shop owner. The boss found two large bags for her to carry all these clothes. Gu Ning carried the two large bags of clothes into an isolated alley and transferred them into the space after making sure no one was around, then walked out empty-handed to continue shopping. She purchased some acceptable quality quilts and other miscellaneous stuff at a very cheap price before Gu Ning loaded them all into the space.\nThinking of the children who had caught a cold a few days ago, Gu Ning made another trip to the pharmacy and bought a bunch of cold and fever medicines. Just this one night, Gu Ning spent more than five thousand dollars. The gold necklace had been sold for a total of over 30,000 yuan, and the money they owed her relatives would probably need to be paid up soon. Gu Ning couldn’t wait to go back to the post-apocalyptic world and “ransack” another jewellery shop.\nHowever, getting Fang Fa to help and “sell” the loot wasn’t going to be a long-term solution, so she had to find another way.\nIf only the money from the post-apocalyptic world could be used here, otherwise she would never have to worry about money again if she robbed a bank.\nGu Ning lay in her bed, feeling depressed.\nUnable to fall asleep, she made a trip back to the space.\nThe area near the door was neatly arranged with the items she had purchased in bulk, piling up into a small mountain and Gu Ning felt a sense of accomplishment.\nThe grass along the shore was still so tall, Gu Ning stepped out onto a path to allow herself to walk through, then she headed straight to the sea. She glanced at the large green sea, thinking about the relationship between the sea and the psychic energy.\nShe had a vague sense of her connection to the sea, and suddenly she had a very bold idea that she would like to try and see if she could control it. Just as this thought surfaced in her mind, the seawater in front of her feet instantly stirred up, then a finger-sized whirlpool appeared. It slowly turned into a whirlpool as big as her palm, the centre of the whirlpool was spinning rapidly as if the water was rolled up with a tornado. Gu Ning’s heart thumped as she carefully controlled this whirlpool of water and led it towards the door.\nA stream of water from the whirlpool diverted out and slowly headed towards the door under Gu Ning’s control before it picked up speed and slammed towards the door!\nWith that, it passes through the door silently and just disappeared ——\nGu Ning was stunned as she stared at the water that seemed to be absorbed by the door. The water flowed out as if it had evaporated and she couldn’t understand what was going on for a long while.\nShe tried a few more times and it was all the same, the stream of water went through the door steadily and then vanished.\nReturning to her bedroom, she didn’t find anything unusual either.\nHowever, she was unable to see that her room was filled with floating dots of green light energy that were flicking gently in a very strange and mysterious way. It floated through the doors and passed layers of walls before falling into the soil of the plants.\nThe cactus on the balcony, which had been soaked in water for too long and the roots were rotten, suddenly took on a new life and began to grow in the night breeze.\nGu Ning got up early the next day.\nPerhaps because Gu Ning was moving away, Mother Gu was in a bad mood and went to the balcony to check out the cactus after serving Gu Ning breakfast.\nAfter a while, Mother Gu went back to her room and said to Father Gu: “Aiya, Old Gu, it’s really strange, didn’t I say a while ago that you had soaked my cactus to death by pouring tea into the pot where it was kept? I just went to check and somehow it came back to life? That’s so strange.”\nFather Gu took a sip of the soy milk and replied slowly: “I think you are the one being strange. Cactus plants are very tough plants, so how can they be so easily soaked to death? You’ve nagged at me for a while. Now look, it’s still alive isn’t it?”\nMother Gu nagged: “Nope! Go take a look, not only does it come back to life, it has even grown taller. I’ve been planting it for almost a year and it hasn’t grown that much. How did it grow so tall in just a single night?”\nFather Gu responded casually: “You’re overthinking it.”\nGu Ning drank the last mouthful of soy milk, then went back to her room, took the packed quilt and her backpack before informing them: “I’ll go off first then!” After saying that, fearing that Mother Gu would come after her, she flew out the door, with a duffel bag of quilt and pillow that were slightly heavy and left as fast as she could.\nMother Gu lost sight of Gu Ning in a blink of an eye and immediately complained: “This child, why does she run away so fast?!”\nThen she continued to mobilize Father Gu: “Come with me and take a look, you will see if it’s my problem or not.” She then dragged Father Gu over.\nWhen Father Gu took a look at the cactus on the balcony, he too was so shocked and pushed up his glasses while exanimating: “Hey? It seems to be true. How did this grow so tall in just one night?” The cactus had indeed grown taller and not just by a little bit, but at least more than ten centimetres which could be easily differentiated by just a glance.\n“Aiya! Old Gu, come and take a look at this garlic head! I planted it here yesterday when I was peeling it, how come it sprouted another head so fast?!” Mother Gu exclaimed in amazement as she held the garlic head in her hand.\nFather Gu stared at the cactus that had come back from the dead and then at the garlic head that had sprouted out and was very confused: “This is just so strange.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Awwww… Fang Fa just too cute haha and now we roughly know how Gu Ning’s psychic power works.

She took her luggage and headed straight to the army by taxi. In the car, she sent her bank account number to Fang Fa.\nWhen she arrived at the army at nine o’clock sharp, the person who picked her up at the gate turned out to be Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu.\n\n\n\nThe two of them ran to the side of the taxi and helped Gu Ning unload her luggage from the back compartment. Zhang XiaoBai grabbed the large backpack which she was carrying and hung it over his shoulder, then updated Gu Ning as they headed in: “The Battalion Commander is here today and is having a meeting with the three Company Commanders. Our Company Commander informed us to bring you to the family building.”\nThe family building was still a long way away from the main entrance, but the area was very well maintained and full of greenery while the white concrete path led the way. Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu were laughing and joking as they led Gu Ning forward, and when they passed the training ground of the Second Company, Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu both straightened their backs inadvertently. Finally, they followed a nice path lined with trees on both sides, where the family building was located at the end of the pathway.\nSeveral small white buildings were quietly bathed in the morning sun, surrounded by greenery in a very peaceful and comfortable environment.\nThe second building from the left was the family building for the Third Company.\nZhang XiaoBai smiled and explained: “It’s not yet the time of the year where the army opened up for family visits, so this whole building is now under your care.”\nThen they took Gu Ning to room 202 on the second floor.\nPushing open the door, a room of perhaps thirty square feet, with a light-coloured tiled floor, white walls, a double bed, a wardrobe, a desk with a reclining chair, a few single wooden stools against the wall, and a small balcony came along with it.\nZhong Xu placed Gu Ning’s luggage on the floor and informed her: “You can have hot water in the washroom, just turn it on an hour in advance. We’ve got all those toiletries and stuff for you, they’re all on the sink. If you don’t like them you can buy them from the convenience store near here. We don’t know what else you girls need, but if you need anything, just let us know.”\nGu Ning was touched and replied: “Thank you.”\nZhang XiaoBai chuckled: “Hey, come on Gu Ning, we’re all on the same team, so don’t be so polite. If you can make it into the Five Stars Brigade, then our Third Company will also be honoured.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhong Xu asked: “So, do you want to take a rest first or would you want to come down with us for training now? The Company Commander said that we will be training in the field today, so it might be rather tough.”\n“Let’s go then.” Gu Ning replied.\nJust as the three of them were about to leave when Zhao Jie and Zou Ming came running in a blaze of glory, holding a brand new set of camouflage uniforms in their hands.\nZhao Jie asked; “Gu Ning, this is the smallest size of clothes we’ve found, go try it on and see if it fit you.”\nGu Ning then took the clothes to the washroom and changed. Although it was the smallest size, it was still a bit too big for her and Gu Ning had to fold the sleeves and trouser legs for it to become more wearable.\n“It’s still too big.” Zhong Xu glanced at Gu Ning who had walked out of the washroom after changing the uniforms and stated: “But there’s nothing we can do about it now, let’s just bear with it for now.”\nZhang XiaoBai laughed and chimed in: “Haha, Gu Ning, you look quite good in this uniform, just like a child in adult clothes.” It was unclear whether he was complimenting or belittling her.\nAfterward, the five of them went down together and Zhong Xu passed the room key to Gu Ning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai smilingly asked Gu Ning if she would be afraid at night and if she wanted them to keep a watch for her.\nThe few of them joked and chatted while headed to the training field.\nBy this time, Brother San had already finished his meeting, and when Gu Ning and the others arrived, Brother San and the others were already waiting. In addition to the three Company Commanders, there were several soldiers that Gu Ning had not seen before standing next to them. Also, several soldiers from the first and second companies who specialized in marksmanship were gathered too.\nA few sharp gazes fell on Gu Ning, and after checking her out, one of the middle-aged soldiers around forty years old, with amiable gaze asked Gu Ning: “You are Gu Ning, right?”\nGu Ning first subconsciously glanced at Brother San, who hurriedly introduced them: “Gu Ning, this is our Battalion Commander.”\nGu Ning greeted back: “Nice to meet you Battalion Commander, Yes I am Gu Ning.”\nThe Battalion Commander replied with a smile: “Nice to meet you too, I heard a lot from Xiao Xie, you are very skilful for your age, where are you from?”\nGu Ning replied: “I’m a local of Jinyong.”\nThe Battalion Commander smiled and asked: “Not bad, not bad, what made you think of joining the Five Stars Brigade?”\nGu Ning thought for a moment, but still answered honestly: “To learn close-quarters combat.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEveryone was stunned, not expecting Gu Ning to give such an answer, even Brother San looked at Gu Ning with some surprises.\nGu Ning continued: “The Third Company Commander has already investigated my background and should know that I have been missing for the past three months. Something had happened to me in those three months and after a difficult return, I felt that the world was actually very dangerous, so I wanted to train myself to become stronger.” This was the truth, so Gu Ning said frankly. She had prepared this speech for a long time, thinking that Brother San would ask about them, yet she never expected that Brother San didn’t ask her.\nIt was a simple and good reason.\nHowever, everyone else had a strange look on their face.\nZhang XiaoBai even stared at Gu Ning with a shocked expression.\nIt was obvious that Gu Ning’s simple answer had shocked them.\nEven the Battalion Commander was speechless before the atmosphere became too awkward, Brother San coughed lightly and then interjected: “Well, Battalion Commander, you’ve seen our men, we have to continue our training, so I won’t be sending you off ah.”\nAfter sending the Battalion Commander and the followers away, the other still stared at Gu Ning with this strange expression, while Gu Ning was completely oblivious that she had said something wrong.\nSeeing that Gu Ning was in this state, Brother San coughed before asking Zhong Xu: “Zhong Xu, tell Gu Ning why do you want to get into the Five Stars Brigade?”\nZhong Xu gave Gu Ning a complicated look before replying solemnly: “That’s because being in the Five Stars Brigade represents the honor of a soldier and it is the greatest recognition for me!”\nBrother Sand nudged Zhang XiaoBai with his chin: “What about you, Zhang XiaoBai?”\nZhang XiaoBai replied: “That’s because being in the Five Stars Brigade means I’m a very, very, very awesome soldier. Today, I’m proud of Third Company, tomorrow the Third Company will be proud of me!” His voice was loud and his aura was compelling.\nAfterward, everyone shifted their gazes back at Gu Ning.\nGu Ning was speechless.\nThen the fifteen of them, including Gu Ning, were taken to the bottom of the mountain by the three Company Commanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“All of you will enter the mountain terrain from here, and when you see the nets that will be the edge, you shall not climb over it. There are no friends, only enemies! The Five Stars Brigade has only given us four slots this time, so today, on this mountain, the fifteen of you will fight for the spots!” These words from First Company Commander Zhou ZiLai, immediately made the fifteen people tense up.\nJiang Jun of the first company asked in surprise: “Company Commander, weren’t there twenty slots last year? How come this year it’s just four all of a sudden?”\nGu Ning glanced at the frowning Brother San and knew that they were playing for real this time, and if she wasn’t careful, she would most likely be brushed off from the first stage.\nZhou ZiLai pursed his lips then continued: “The Battalion Commander came here just now specifically to talk about this matter. The people at the Five Stars Brigade have said that based on the performance of our three companies last year, it is only worthy of four slots.”\nThe soldiers immediately kept quiet, they had been through it last year and they knew how badly they were being abused.\nSecond Company Commander Zhang YueGuo said after glancing at Gu Ning: “Don’t think that just because you know how to shoot targets and that’s all you need! Today we are having a real combat drill! That’s the real battlefield! There’s only a single chance on the battlefield, and I hope all of you can seize this opportunity!”\n“Yes Sir!” All the soldiers responded in unison.\nZhang YueGuo glanced at Brother San, indicating him to give a small speech too.\nBrother San cleared his throat, then swept his gaze across Gu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, Zou Ming, Zhao Jie’s faces and said with a smile: “I have nothing to say, I just hope those four slots will all be from our Third Company.”\nAll five of them, including Gu Ning, smiled before saluting at Brother San and shouted in unison: “Determined to complete the mission!”\nThis led to strong discontent from the other companies.\nZhang YueGuo said half-jokingly: “Old Xie, you’re forcing our First and Second Companies to join forces to finish off your Third Company first.”\nBrother San replied confidently and proudly: “Then you all can give it a try, if they get killed so easily, then how can they expect to enter the Five Stars Brigade?”\nZhang YueGuo just choked upon hearing it, and his expression was grim.\nWhen changing equipment, Zhao Jie said while checking his special gun: “I know it myself, that I’m the weakest among the five of us. Let’s kill the others first, then I’ll kill myself. The sad heroic route suits me better.” He said this with a smile on his face, and there were no traces of sadness when he said that. Everyone else was also in a relaxed mood.\nGu Ning, however, couldn’t help but recall Zhao Jie, who had died a tragic death in the post-apocalyptic world and felt some mixed emotions.\nSeeing Gu Ning’s gloomy expression, Zhang XiaoBai and the rest thought that she was just too nervous. After all, although Gu Ning was a good marksman, yet just like the Second Company’s Commander had stated, being good at target shooting, didn’t mean she would be good at actual combat drills. Especially for someone like Gu Ning who hadn’t done any actual combat exercises.\nZhang XiaoBai reassured: “Gu Ning, don’t be afraid, although you haven’t tried out actual combat exercise, your marksmanship is still the best among the five of us. So we will cover you, and you just have to show off your marksmanship, a shot for one will do.”\nGu Ning’s retracted her thoughts and was amused at Zhang XiaoBai’s reassurance, actual combat drills? Zhang XiaoBai and the others might not have even seen actual blood spill yet, whereas she was the one who walked out from a horde of zombies. Of course, it was impossible to say that she wasn’t nervous at all, because she had done all preparation and if she was to be brushed off right now, Gu Ning would be very disappointed. Therefore, she had to treat this as if it was in the post-apocalyptic world, and out of those four slots, she surely had to take up a spot!\nThen the five of them looked at each other, saw the solemnity and determination in each other’s eyes, and the group of fifteen men set off into the mountain.\nThe time limit was three hours.\nThe battle began ten minutes after entering the mountain.\nAs soon as they’ve entered the mountain, the three companies quickly and tacitly separated into three groups and began to run wildly through the mountain.\nGu Ning didn’t know why but reflexively followed Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and the rest, dashing forward while carrying a special gun that was quite heavy. It was clear that running in such conditions did not affect the soldiers particularly much, but then they suddenly realized that Gu Ning wasn’t trained in such area normally and might have been left behind by them. They quickly sprung around to check and saw that Gu Ning was carrying her gun with unparalleled ease and following closely behind them.\nIt took around ten minutes of running at a certain pace through the mountain before their group slowly came to a halt.\nZhang XiaoBai and the others gasped slightly and subconsciously glanced at Gu Ning, but when they saw that Gu Ning was standing straight with her gun and her chest was not even heaving much while surveying the surroundings vigilantly, they looked at each other and was puzzled and shocked at the same time. Perhaps seeing their shock, Gu Ning flatly stated: “I used to be a marathon champion, I’ve always had good stamina.” This was naturally a lie, running three thousand metres at school would have killed her. Gu Ning had now completely mastered the skill of lying and was calm enough to tell lies without being flushed.\nZhang XiaoBai leaned his body against the tree and stared at Gu Ning and said sincerely: “Gu Ning, you’re such a pervert.”\nGu Ning shrugged her shoulders and then glanced at Zhong Xu and asked: “What do we do next?”\nZhong Xu stood up and glanced at the surrounding before replying: “This place is quite well concealed, they won’t be able to find us for a while.”\nGu Ning noticed that where they were right now was a small concave, behind them was a small slope like an upside-down pot-like shape, shielding them well, while their front was a high slope with rocks and trees below it. The only path leading to this side was two paths that could only be crossed by a single file. The terrain was not only concealing but also could be used for surveying as well as attacking. Even if they were attacked from both sides, they would still have an absolute advantage.\nHowever, Gu Ning still was unsatisfied with the answer: “So?”\nZhang XiaoBai sat down on the floor and pulled down the zip of his jacket to cool himself down and replied: “So we’ll wait here, and when they’re almost done sniping at each other like the clam and the crane, we will be the fishermen and wipe them all out.”\nThe others didn’t make a sound and obviously, such a plan had been decided before they entered here.\nThe plan was reasonable but Gu Ning still had doubts.\n“What if they want to be the fishermen too?”\nShe asked again: “And haven’t you guys thought about another possibility of them joining forces together and taking us out first?”\nZhang XiaoBai paused in his fanning motions and subconsciously looked at Zhong Xu, who had always been the one to lead them.\nThe others were also caught off guard by Gu Ning’s question and all subconsciously stared at Zhong Xu.\nZhong Xu exploded: “Why are you all looking at me? This idea was scrapped together by all of you, so why are you all staring at me now?”\nThen he calmed down instantly and looked over at Gu Ning: “So what should we do now?”\nEveryone followed Zhong Xu’s gaze and stared at Gu Ning.\nGu Ning was stunned at first, then sighed helplessly in her heart and thought carefully before squatting down and analysing the situation with them after beckoning them together: “As you should have seen when we entered the mountain, we all ran in different directions, so the two teams are not together for now. Even if they had the thoughts of joining forces, they should still be at the stage of mutual suspicion between them, and will not join forces for now.”\nZhang XiaoBai chimed in: “That’s right, the men of the second company are too arrogant and the team from the first company have never liked them.”\nGu Ning continued: “However if we keep hiding here, once the two teams meet each other, it is difficult to tell if they will fight among themselves or join forces. I don’t know if any of you noticed, but before we started this combat drill, the second company commander said something along the line that why weren’t we afraid that they would join forces to finish us off first? I guess that he was probably signalling to the second company soldiers at that time. Of course, the odds are 50/50, but we can’t afford to take such chances now. One must always prepare for the worst. We’re not afraid to fight them alone, but if they’re really determined to team up and squeeze us out first, then we’re in danger.”\nThe soldiers nodded their heads like chickens pecking at the rice as they listened to Gu Ning’s well-organized analysis.\nGu Ning continued: “So my suggestion is that we should now find one of them as soon as possible, no matter if it’s the first or second company, and root them out first!”\nGu Ning’s last sentence carried a chill, but inexplicably made the four young soldiers’ blood boil in excitement all of a sudden.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: I apologized for the delay as I had some problem with these two chapters. I like the story but seriously, the author can’t count… originally it stated seventeen men in the fight, yet when I counted it on part 2, it’s just thirteen men or lesser … so in the end, I’ve adjusted it to fifteen men evenly. Sorry that I’m not translating accordingly to the author and edited the story number. Please kindly understand, this is to make the story flow slightly more logically.

Go, let’s go out and hunt.” Then he stood up with his guns on his shoulder and led the way out.\nThe others also looked excited, in reality, hiding away was a strategic necessity, but at the back of their minds, they still wanted to go out and take on someone head-on.\n\n\n\nWhen they got out of the slope, Zhong Xu climbed to the highest peak of the slope then stretched his neck to survey around, then jumped down from the slope and said: “The two teams are going in different directions.” He pointed in two directions: “First Company is heading there, Second Company is over there.” Then he looked at Gu Ning subconsciously for her suggestion.\nGu Ning pondered for a moment then replied: “Let’s take out the Second Company first.”\nThere were three reasons.\nFirst of all, the Second Company had Zhai Jun and Gu Ning felt a little threatened by him so it would be best to take him out first. Secondly, the Second Company had a greater intention to join forces than the First Company, so they had to be eliminated first. Thirdly, it was purely because Gu Ning did not like the Second Company after several competitions training.\nThus, when choosing between the First Company and Second Company, Gu Ning of course chose to take out the Second Company.\nZhang XiaoBai was the first to embrace Gu Ning’s idea: “Hey, that’s what I thought so too.”\nThe others didn’t speak up but it was clear that their thoughts were the same as Gu Ning.\nWithout any objection, their group of five began to rush toward the direction the Second Company was located.\nThe mountain was not high, plus the area was enclosed by the net which was probably around five kilometres in circumference. Also, they had to keep in mind their speed while being concealed. Gu Ning imitated their arching movements while running quickly, always keeping her speed in their mid-section, while her whole body senses had expanded to the surroundings to detect any movement around them instantly.\nAccording to Zhong Xu’s arrangement, Zhong Xu took the lead, followed closely by Zou Ming, and behind Gu Ning was Zhang XiaoBai and Zhao Jie at the end. No matter what, Gu Ning was in the middle position which was the safest position in the team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai and Zhao Jie watched Gu Ning in front of them arching very professionally while dashing, closely following Zou Ming, with light and steady footsteps, without the slightest strained feeling. The front foot landed while the back foot was already lifted, so agile and light that Gu Ning didn’t even break the dead branch when she stepped on it.\nZhang XiaoBai couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva, always feeling that Gu Ning wasn’t as simple as the background check by the Company Commander’s investigation.\n“There are people!” Suddenly Gu Ning called out softly, and although Gu Ning’s voice was very small, the soldiers who were highly concentrated immediately reacted and stopped to find cover.\nThey quickly found a thick pile of thorn bushes and bent down to hide.\nAfter such a long run, the physical exertion was enormous, and their chests rose and fell slightly, slowing down their breathing as much as possible.\nAfter waiting for some time, there was no movement.\n“No……”Zhang XiaoBai’s voice ended abruptly after he spat out the first word when Gu Ning reached out and covered his mouth, making a silent gesture with her other hand, then gesturing for him to look to his right.\nIt wasn’t long before the grass to the right shifted and then several green figures burst out of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt was the men of the Second Company.\nHowever, before the soldiers of the Third Company could rejoice, the smile froze on their faces, only to see that the men of the Second Company came out from the left and then the men of the First Company burst out from the right. Apparently, they hadn’t fought against each other and had already joined forces to finish off the Third Company first. The soldiers of the Third Company looked at each other, their faces were all a little solemn.\nZhang Wu of First Company rested his gun on the ground for a moment before saying: “I wonder where the gang from the Third Company has gone in hiding, these people must be rabbits.”\nZhao Liang of the Second Company snorted: “Those few from the Third Company must have played the game of letting us snipe at each other and then they’ll come out and clean up the mess when we’re almost done. Now they must have found a hole somewhere to hide.”\nThe Third Company hiding in the thorny bushes on the side of the road were all snappy when they heard their chatting.\nZhai Jun stood up high and glanced around before squatting down and said: “Even if they’re hiding in a hole, we’ll have to dig them out and root them off. Let’s go and keep looking.”\nThen they all got up again and went in the direction from which the Third Company had come from.\nFive minutes later, after making sure that they were far away from the soldiers, did they dare to breathe freely while keeping their voices low: “Gu Ning, what next?”\nGu Ning frowned, she didn’t expect them to move so fast, she planned to break them up one by one, yet now they would have to fight head-on with all of them. Gu Ning glanced at the four soldiers and said: “Our Third Company Commander was right, if we can’t even deal with them, then we shouldn’t be in the Five Stars Brigade.” Gu Ning stood up after saying it, she glanced down at the few of them from above with a cold smile: “Let’s go.”\nThe rest of them looked at each other, then together they stood up and followed Gu Ning in the direction of the First and Second Companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs they had to search along the way, the First and Second Companies were slightly slow, they didn’t let go of any possible hiding place, giving them a feeling of searching for ghosts in the middle of the mountains. They slowed down their speed due to searching whereas Gu Ning’s group was running at full throttle. Within ten minutes, Gu Ning’s and the rest had already spotted them.\nThey quickly concealed themselves.\nThe soldiers subconsciously turned their gazes to Gu Ning, waiting for her next instruction, having completely forgotten their worries about Gu Ning’s lack of actual combat practices before entering the mountain.\nGu Ning peered over the grass at the soldiers of the First and Second Companies who were impatiently searching for their trail in front of them. Her mind turned rapidly, suddenly, her gaze fell on Zhao Jie, who instantly felt a flinch as Gu Ning gestured for them to gather closer, lowering her voice to an extremely low level while rambling for a while. Several of their expressions changed slightly.\nZhao Jie took the initiative and said: “I’ll go, as I said before entering the mountain, there are five of us in total, so one of us has to sacrifice, might as well let me sacrifice in a meaningful way.” After saying this, he looked at Gu Ning and continued: “Gu Ning, I’m counting on you for the three of them.”\nGu Ning solemnly nodded: “We will win.”\nBefore the other three could comment, Zhao Jie slipped away from the back of the grass field as Gu Ning had planned.\nThe search continued for the First and Second Companies, and a soldier from the Second Company casually waved a pile of grass open with the gun in his hand and said irritably: “The guys from the Third Company couldn’t have dug a rabbit hole to hide in, could they? We’ve almost turned the whole place around and still haven’t seen a single shadow of them.”\nGong MengLong, the leader of the First Company, raised his hand to check his wristwatch then replied: “It’s already been an hour. The time limit is three hours, so maybe the men from the Third Company are just trying to force us to fight off each other and then wait till the last minute before showing up to clean up the mess.”\nZhai Jun’s expression was also very grave, he was temporarily transferred from the military academy to here because he was squeezed out of the military academy’s quota. He had to use his connections to be urgently transferred to the army to fight for this one slot. Originally he thought that he could stand a chance, but he didn’t expect that the Five Stars Brigade would make such a limitation. Moreover, out of nowhere came a Gu Ning, if he didn’t even meet the threshold of the Five Stars Brigade test, he would be so disappointed.\nIf the Third Company never came out, then there was a good chance that something like what Gong MengLong had stated would really happen. They had long guessed that the Third Company would have such a plan, but they didn’t expect them to hide so well, and they had never seen any of them since they had gone their separate ways into the mountains.\nJust as Zhai Jun was in a very gloomy mood, suddenly, his eye caught a glimpse of the tufts of grass at his back, which moved slightly. The movement was so small that it could have been a gust of wind blowing by, but right now there was no wind —— Zhai Jun’s gaze met Gong MengLong’s and it was clear that the other party also caught the movement as well. The two looked at each other and exchanged a silent message with their eyes before reaching a consensus that there was someone there! Anyone sneaking around at this time of the day would be no one other than the men of the Third Company.\nThe two of them shifted their eyes away but their peripheral gazes were already locked at the spot. Sure enough, it seemed to confirm that it was safe and the man hiding in the grass started to move in very small movements. Zhai Jun and Gong MengLong looked at each other, both were very sure that the other man was thinking the same as themselves, that they could not alert the hidden man. They were very sure that this man should be the one the Third Company had sent over to scout their movements, then he would surely go back to join the remaining four men now. Thinking that they had already wasted an hour, if they didn’t seize this opportunity, with the fleeing skills of the gang from the Third Company, they reckoned that they might not be able to find them even after another two hours of searching.\nGong MengLong didn’t hesitate, passed his gun back to his confused teammate, then hugged a nearby tree and started to climb up. His movements were very agile, it seems like he had been specially trained and climbed four or five meters at one go, then he hugged the trunk tightly and locked his gaze on the figure that was moving very carefully and stealthily through the grass.\nOnly when the figure disappeared behind an uneven slope a few dozen metres away then did he giggle and slide down from the tree, saying to the remaining soldiers, who were confused and had no idea what Gong MengLong was doing; “We’ve found their rabbit hole. Let’s go! Let’s root them out of their rabbit hole!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe soldiers who had been in a state of irritation, immediately felt their spirits lift.\nGong MengLong led the way, moving with great care, their heads covered with rings of grass woven on the road, even their black special guns were tied with grass, so that if one didn’t look closely, it would be difficult to even see these green moving objects passing through the dense grass.\nThey were very confident of their concealment skills and Zhai Jun felt vaguely excited. Imagining the faces of the men from the Third Company, surrounded by them, especially that Gu Ning, who always looked so confident and so sure of herself made him feel a great sense of anticipation.\nAlthough they were very careful not to alert the “rabbits” by making too much noise, they were still very fast because of their training. When they saw the arching slope not far away, Gong MengLong signalled them to a halt and prepared to make a gesture to spread out and surround them.\nHowever, just when he had raised his hand, he heard a biu sound, and almost instantly the tensed nerves in Gong MengLong’s head snapped —— before he could make a move to dodge, a choking puff of smoke rose, while the little red light on the front of his chest flickering.\nThose soldiers following Gong MengLong were dumbfounded as they watched the smoke rise from the special clothes on Gong MengLong’s body.\nZhai Jun reacted almost instantly and shouted: “There’s an ambush! Take cover!” At the same time, he found the nearest tree, and with a leap, he pounced behind it.\nThe soldiers reacted and sought cover, however, this instant reaction was not as quick as Gu Ning’s, she barely needed to aim and in just a few seconds, smoke kept rising from the running soldiers, and the smoke rising meant the man had been eliminated from the game.\nWhen Gong MengLong saw that four of his teammate, including himself, had died at once, but he couldn’t even see where his opponent was, he couldn’t help and cursed: “F*ck! We’ve been f*cking tricked!”\nZhai Jun’s back was pressed tightly against the tree, feeling the cold chill on his back, his back was full of cold sweat, and his heart was thumping rapidly. When the smoke came out of the soldier next to him just now, he almost thought it was coming out from himself and he almost died of fright. He had guessed that the shot had been aimed at him, but he didn’t expect the soldier to rush out at once and block his back, so he luckily escaped.\nHe looked at the clearing where Gong MengLong and three soldiers from the First Company and three soldiers from the Second Company were standing with smoke emitting from their clothes. Apparently, they were eliminated from this competition.\nNow there were just two of them left from the Second Company and one from the First Company.\nThe soldier of the First Company was a relatively short and thin soldier named Chen Gen, who was silent and didn’t speak on the way. He was hiding behind a tree with his gun, perfectly concealing his figure.\nZhai Jun gave him a look, he had seen his training results during the training exercise and could only describe them as very mediocre. He had always wondered how the First Company Commander had selected him but now he had proven himself by being the only “survivor” of his company.\nZhai Jun exchanged glances with the other man of the Second Company, who was obviously also terrified because it had all happened too quickly and they were still absorbed in the fact that they were going to surround the Third Company yet they were slapped by reality. Moreover, they were directly ambushed by the Third Company, scrapping half of their numbers in one go. It seemed that the man was simply a bait placed by the Third Company. When did those simple-minded men of the Third Company become so cunning?\nThe scene went into a stalemate.\nAfter putting down a few men, the Third Company who had lost sight of their targets fell silent.\nThe men who were already in a state of death all sat together in a huddle, allowing the smoke to rise from their bodies with an inexplicable sense of sadness and desolation. The smoke caused by several people gathered together was very large and soon filled up in a small area on the side, the area soon began to blur. Zhai Jun’s heart moved and suddenly thought of a plan, turning back to the two others including the survivor of the first company, Chen Gen, and gesturing a few hand signals. At the same time, he exchanged glances with the soldier from the Second Company who had been eliminated, and as soon as the smoke was cleared, the soldier dashed out in a very fast motion towards another direction.\nZhang XiaoBai was hiding behind a mountain rock and asked Gu Ning in a low voice what to do now if they hid and refused to come out.\nSuddenly, he heard Gu Ning let out a low bellow: “Coming.”\nZhang XiaoBai emerged with his head halfway out to take a peek, but there was smoke everywhere in front of him, so he couldn’t see where the people were.\nJust then Gu Ning had relied on her extremely keen hearing to fire two shots into the smoke.\n“Crap!” Only Zou Ming’s voice could be heard shouting over there, and then a puff of smoke could be seen floating up.\n“I’m dead too!” Following closely behind was Zhao Jie’s helpless voice.\nTwo people were instantly eliminated from the Third Company at once, Gu Ning couldn’t help but feel her heart tighten, while she vaguely felt something was off in her mind.\nHer ears suddenly caught the sound of an extremely subtle footstep approaching Zhang XiaoBai’s side. She had the ominous feeling and was about to expose her figure to rescue Zhang XiaoBai, but Zhong Xu was even quicker than her and rushed over to block Zhang XiaoBai at once. He smiled at Gu Ning and the next second, the smoke rose from his clothes.\nGu Ning was a bit overwhelmed at the time, hiding behind a rock and looking at Zhong Xu and Zhang XiaoBai in a daze.\nHer side was actually eliminated from Zou Ming, Zhao Jie, and Zhong Xu, three in a row within such a short period.\nThe man in the smoke coughed dryly and came out of the smoke, Gong MengLong coughed a few times, then nodded and said: “Okay, you all could come out now, there are exactly four of you still alive, so there won’t be the need to fight anymore.”\nZhang XiaoBai glanced at Gu Ning, who gave him a nod then they both strolled out together.\nZhai Jun and Chen Gen also strolled out.\nThere were exactly four people left, and although the dozen or so who were eliminated were feeling a little bit depressed, they were still able to accept the result.\nGong MengLong spoke up: “Congratulations to the four of you.”\nBoth Zhai Jun and Chen Gen had been congratulated by their own company, while Gu Ning and Zhang XiaoBai had also been congratulated by them. Now that the rivalry between them had been lifted, they naturally didn’t begrudge their friendliness.\nZhai Jun stared at Gu Ning seriously before saying: “Gu Ning, you’re really something. I hope we can work together amicably when we face the Five Stars Brigade.” This was like showing Gu Ning a peace treaty.  Gu Ning’s performance for today had proved that she was more than just a good target shooter. However, in response to Zhai Jun’s act of goodwill, Gu Ning only nodded absentmindedly, reacting very coldly.\nThis was supposed to be the end of the matter, and then it was time for them to go down the mountain together.\nHowever, Gu Ning suddenly frowned: “Something’s not right.”\nHer gaze was a little cold and Zhang XiaoBai froze and asked: “What’s wrong? It’s exactly four slots.”\nGu Ning’s cold gaze swept over the faces of every man in the First and Second Companies then coldly questioned: “The ones I shot just now were two out of the three of you, why are there still two of you left alive?”\nShe was distracted just now because she had been feeling something was off due to the projection of the number of people who had died, and now the results were shown.\nThis cold and aggressive questioning caused Zhai Jun, who had already relaxed, to instantly stiffen imperceptibly and Chen Gen took a step back and subconsciously glanced at Zhai Jun expressionlessly.\nA short, breathless silence followed the soldiers’ overwhelming astonishment.\nEven those who were slow to think quickly caught on to the meaning of Gu Ning’s question.\nThe already relaxed atmosphere on the field was instantly tensed by Gu Ning’s direct questioning.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: my god… I had to adjust all the numbers in this chapters to make it more sensible hahaha.

The First Company only had one man left and the Second Company had two men.” Gu Ning pointed out Zhai Jun, Chen Gen, and the other man from the Second Company. She then continued: “Just now, in the second round of shooting, I shot two people, so there should only be one person still ‘alive’ at the end.” Gu Ning glanced at Chen Gen and Zhai Jun before asking coldly: “Which one of you two is the ghost?”\n\n\n\nGu Ning was wearing an ill-fitting camouflage uniform holding the special gun in her hand. Her already small face was half-covered by a hat, making her look more child-like yet the cold and harsh questioning that came out of her forced everyone to look at her solemnly. Moreover, in such a chaotic situation just now, Gu Ning was still able to see clearly in the situation, which was already a very frightening ability.\nThe atmosphere in the field dropped to an icy point.\nZhai Jun no longer knew what kind of expression was showing on his face, or rather he was too stiffened up and didn’t know what to express.\nChen Gen was originally expressionless, and nothing changed at this moment.\nGong MengLong glanced at Chen Gen and then Zhai Jun with a strange expression before focusing on Gu Ning and asked: “You mean that someone cheated?”\nThe expression of one of the soldiers from the Second Company changed slightly.\n“How can you prove it?” A soldier from the First Company questioned: “There was so much smoke around that you couldn’t even see the people clearly, so who knows if you managed to hit it or not? Although you are good at shooting, are you so sure that you have hit someone?”\n“Do you want to try again?” Gu Ning’s gaze burned into the questioning soldier.\n“Why do you have to be so aggressive?” Suddenly, one of the soldiers from the Second Company sneered: “It’s all four slots anyway.”\nGu Ning’s gaze shot past like an arrow and replied coldly: “Then one of these four slots should be Zhong Xu’s.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhong Xu stared at Gu Ning with amazement and touched, he didn’t expect Gu Ning to be so aggressive because she was helping to fight for the spot for him.\nThat Second Company soldier’s heart chilled at Gu Ning’s stern gaze, but the sneer on his face was even stronger: “If you are saying that, didn’t you still steal a spot from us too?!”\nAt his remark, the soldiers of the First and Second Companies, except for a few from the Third Company, all had a subtle expression on their faces. It was clear that, although they had never questioned it, they still held quite some displeased feeling against her.\nBefore Gu Ning could retaliate, Zhang XiaoBai spoke up and looked very annoyed at the Second Company soldier and replied: “If you say it this way, didn’t Zhai Jun of your Second Company get transferred from the military academy urgently?! You think we don’t know that Zhai Jun was urgently transferred from the military academy after pulling in some connection because the quota there was already full. He’s only been in the Second Company for a few days? You say that Gu Ning stole the spot, why didn’t you say that to Zhai Jun too?”\nThe entire army knew that Zhai Jun was transferred over urgently, but the news that he was transferred over because the quota for the military school was full was the first time the soldiers had heard of it.\nZhang XiaoBai’s words instantly slapped that Second Company soldier in the face and dragged Zhai Jun down with him. Zhang XiaoBai didn’t care if Zhai Jun was innocent or not, what he wanted was, if you attack our company men, then don’t blame me for firing at your Second Company. He had subconsciously taken Gu Ning as one of his own brothers.\nAfter Zhang XiaoBai’s words, the teammates from the Third Company, all tacitly stood beside Gu Ning, silently forming a confrontation with the Second Company.\nHonestly speaking, they were all in the same training ground, the three companies would more or less have some friction, but usually, there was a boss above them and pressured them to make peace with each other. And right now, this kind of incident caused the Second and Third Company which usually clashed so much, to instantly meet with confrontation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe scene was getting ugly and the tension between the two companies increased greatly.\nWorried that something might have happened to cause the whole scene to become unmanageable, Gong MengLong hurriedly interjected and said: “All right, enough, let’s not chat about it now, we can’t do anything here. Let’s all go down the mountain and talk things over and let our Company Commanders decide.”\nGong MengLong had a point, so they left the mountain together.\nThe men from the Third Company walked at the front while the First and Second Companies soldiers were lurking at the back, unsure if it was intentional or not.\nA soldier nudged Zhai Jun and asked in a whisper: “Zhai Jun, what should we do now? If it gets too big, it won’t end well.”\nZhai Jun’s expression changed slightly, then stared at the soldier and replied calmly: “What do we do? We have done nothing so why should we be worried about it?”\nAlong the way down the mountain, all the soldiers were silent, each of them was in their thoughts.\nAll three Company Commanders fell into a brief silence after listening to Gu Ning’s calm but clear and precise description.\nThen Zhang YueGuo, the commander of the Second Company, asked the same question: “Hey girl, we all know you’re a good shooter, but how do you justify firing all two shots and hitting them accurately in such a situation like that? Are you so confident in your marksmanship?”\nGu Ning nodded: “Yes.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang YueGuo spoke: “…….hey? Lao Xie, let me tell you, your people have already taken up two spots, there’s no need to be so aggressive right?”\nBrother San glanced at Gu Ning and seeing the determination in Gu Ning’s eyes, Brother San shifted his gaze back to Zhang YueGuo and replied with a frown: “What do you mean by being aggressive? If what Gu Ning said is true, then someone is deliberately playing some tricks and making false claims……” His sharp gaze raked over the soldiers’ faces like a knife: “A man like that, I don’t think he’s qualified for that spot.”\nZhang YueGuo interjected: “Lao Xie, what Gu Ning said was just her side of the story. We can’t believe whatever she says just because she says so, can we? Frankly speaking, you may not know the character of some people either……”\nZhang YueGuo’s words came to an abrupt halt as someone cut him off.\nChen Gen, who had been standing on the side in silence, abruptly interrupted Zhang YueGuo and said with an expressionless face: “I saw it.”\nEveryone’s gazes were fixed on him.\nEven the commander of First Company looked at Chen Gen with surprise: “Chen Gen, what did you say?”\nZhai Jun stared at Chen Gen unbelievably.\nChen Gen didn’t look at anyone, but directly named the soldier who had moved at that moment, and continued expressionlessly: “If I’m right, this man suddenly stood up and ran in another direction in his “dead” state. So if I had guessed correctly, he should have deliberately disturbed Gu Ning’s attention and drawn her bullets over to cover up for Zhai Jun.”\nEveryone followed Chen Gen’s pointed direction and stared at the man whom he had named out, a soldier from the Second Company called Wei Yong. Just by looking at the man’s instantly pale face, those present knew that what Chen Gen had said was true.\nZhang YueGuo’s face instantly turned gloomy all of a sudden.\nZhai Jun’s expression changed slightly, then immediately returned to its natural state, he glanced at Wei Yong with the same shocked and ashamed look as the rest of the soldiers from the Second Company around him.\nWei Yong subconsciously glanced at Zhai Jun, however, when he saw the gaze on Zhai Jun’s face, his expression was slightly bitter. Thinking about the promise Zhai Jun had made to him, his heart was solemn, so he admitted: “Yes, I had cheated, but it was an act of my own will, there is nothing to do with Zhai Jun.”\nZhang YueGuo gave Wei Yong a resentful glance before saying: “Since Wei Yong has already admitted that he did it, then he will be informed internally and be given one major demerit.” Then he turned to Gu Ning and slightly unnaturally said: “I’ll apologize on his behalf to you guys. It’s also my fault for not disciplining him properly, I’m sorry.”\n“It’s okay.” Gu Ning showed great generosity, and then she continued: “So how are you going to handle this matter?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang YueGuo froze for a moment: “What, how to deal with it?” Hadn’t it already been dealt with?\nBrother San guessed what Gu Ning had in mind, and he stared into the sky a second before Zhang YueGuo shifted his gazes at him.\nGu Ning stared at Zhang YueGuo and continued: “If this soldier from the Second Company hadn’t rushed out at that time, then my bullet would have fired at Zhai Jun, then Zhong Xu wouldn’t have died unjustly, so wouldn’t the quota need to be reallocated?”\nZhang YueGuo’s face, which had just eased up, turned grimly again: “Girl, aren’t you going a bit too far?”\nGu Ning refused to budge: “I think it would be more outrageous if I let Zhong Xu die unjustly.”\nA soldier from the Second Company interjected: “At that time Zhai Jun and Chen Gen were both there, no matter who you shot, that was at least 50/50 chances. Why do you keep biting that it would be Zhai Jun that took your bullet?” His words were very harsh: “You don’t have to be so obvious if you have a problem with our Second Company, do you?”\nGu Ning just replied calmly: “Zhai jun shot Zhao Jie, Zou Ming, and Zhong Xu in succession at that time. If it wasn’t because someone delayed me, I would have at least saved Zhong Xu. Or do you think I would have chosen not to save my teammates but to shoot at Chen Gen who had been hiding behind a tree and had not shown himself?”\nThat soldier was rendered speechless.\nZhang YueGuo’s expression became increasingly gloomy while Zhai Jun’s face had finally changed at this point.\nBrother San and First Company Commander continued to stare into the sky.\nZhang XiaoBai, who had been holding back from speaking, finally found the opportunity to speak up: “You guys should stop making excuses. If you want to talk about cheating, it’s also your Second Company’s fault. If it wasn’t for the cheating, Zhai Jun would have been eliminated by now. So it’s only right that this spot should belong to Zhong Xu. Company Commander, what do you say?!”\nBrother San nodded vaguely, then continued to stare at the sky.\nZhang YueGuo’s face changed a few times before he said to Brother San: “Lao Xie, your Third Company had already taken up two spots, there are only four slots in total and three of them are from your Third Company, this isn’t too fair, is it?”\nBrother San couldn’t avoid it any longer, so he glanced at Zhong Xu who was looking nervously and anticipated. He sighed inwardly, then stared at Zhang YueGuo and replied: “Lao Zhang, you can’t say things like that. Although Zhong Xu is a member of the Third Company, he is also an individual. And I am his company commander, of course, I have the responsibility to protect the reasonable rights and interests of my soldiers. Lao Zhang, I hope you can understand.” After a short pause, he continued with a painful expression: “Why not, if they manage to get into the Five Stars Brigade, I will share half, no no, a third of the prize money with you. That should be enough, right?”\nZhang YueGuo asked again: “There’s no more room for negotiation?”\nBrother San replied with a straight face: “No.”\n“Alright.” Zhang YueGuo sighed: “Don’t forget what you had just said.”\nBrother San immediately replied: “Absolutely! Lao Zhou can testify to it.”\n“Don’t stand here anymore. There’s nothing more for us to do here. Let’s go.” Zhang YueGuo said to the soldiers of the Second Company, then patted on Zhai Jun’s shoulder as if comforting him and sighed: “Zhai Jun, let’s go, we have to admit when we lose.” Then he led the men of the Second Company away.\nZhai Jun coldly glanced at Gu Ning and Chen Gen, and then followed the group.\nZhang XiaoBai turned around and said to Chen Gen: “Chen Gen, thank you so much just now!”\n“I’m just not comfortable with him being a teammate to face off the Five Stars Brigade together.” Chen Gen continued with an expressionless face before turning to Gu Ning and saying: “Happy working with you, two days later.”\nGu Ning smiled; “Happy to work with you too.”\nOn the way back to the family building, Zhong Xu solemnly expressed his gratitude to Gu Ning. Although it was just a slot, it didn’t mean that he could enter the Five Stars Brigade. Yet at least, he had the qualification to go head-on with them.\nThere wasn’t any training in the afternoon. Thus, they were all given half-day off.\nGu Ning then simply locked the door and went back to the space.\nShe spent the whole afternoon roaming around in the space and exploring it.\nDuring dinner, Brother San informed them that tomorrow they would be back to normal training, and the following day, they just had to wait calmly for the Five Stars Brigade arrival. After eating dinner, she chatted with the soldiers for a while before bidding goodbye. Gu Ning went back to the dormitory and phoned her parents to report about her safety. The time was already nine o’clock at night, and as soon as she locked the door, she returned to the post-apocalyptic world. It was seven o’clock in the morning in the post-apocalyptic world yet the sky was still dark.\nGu Ning pushed open the door from the utility room and met Brother San who happened to come back from using the toilet. Looking at the unkempt Brother San with messy hair and beard, Gu Ning was lost in a trance of thoughts for a moment. However, Brother San stared at Gu Ning with surprise and asked: “You didn’t sleep in here last night, did you?”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ahhh soon they will face off the Five Stars Brigade. It was just funny to see that Brother San and First Company Commander trying to avoid the confrontation by just looking at the sky. XD Although, they had frictions among their companies, they were all in good-relationship too. Alright, thanks for reading the chapter and now Gu Ning is back to the post-apocalyptic world again =) )\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "59": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-59/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Gu Ning came over to the post-apocalyptic world, she had switched her clothes back into the same one which she wore every time, and even ruffled her hair before replying: “No, I just went in to see if there was anything I could use.”\nBrother San didn’t take it too seriously and said as he walked back: “Go and have your breakfast before those little brats finish all of it.”\n\n\n\nGu Ning thought back about the neatly groomed Brother San from the other side of the world and then this unkempt Brother San. She was having some slight trouble in combining those two images into a single person.\nShe really didn’t know if, in the longer run, her mind would even remain mentally sane.\nGu Ning thought silently, then went back to her room.\nNow how should they use their special abilities in fighting?\nThis was the question Gu Ning had raised during the breakfast.\nSeveral people who were still in the excitement of having just developed their powers immediately calmed down because of this question from Gu Ning.\nNow the only ones who had experience in special abilities combat, apart from the too ethereal spiritual power like Xiang Xu, the remaining were Brother San and Cheng Ming.\nSo at the request of everyone, the two men went over the details of the attack they had made by unleashing their special abilities.\n“It’s actually whatever you want to do with your psychic power —— It will do it.” Cheng Ming explained and at the same time as his words fell, a corner of the curtain fabric was sliced off by a wind blade.\nImmediately afterward, a ball of water appeared in front of Zhong Xu, which then split and changed into several water arrows under his careful manipulation, which he then excitedly controlled and shot out outdoors!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe crowd rushed out and witnessed the water arrows fly out and hit a date palm tree that had not yet matured get severed off by it.\nWhat followed was a mini-lesson from Xiang Xu regarding special abilities.\nXiang Xu had already sorted out all the pieces of information in her mind while combining them with her own experiences and explained: “The psychic energy stored in the human body is limited. If you use it continuously without resting, it will be depleted if it is consumed too quickly and does not have enough time for it to regenerate. If your psychic energy enters a depleted state, it will recover very slowly and the body will become weaker. It will take at least two hours or more to recover. However, if you take some of the transparent crystal cores, it would help greatly increase the speed of the regeneration of your psychic energy.”\n“So all of you must be clear about the storage limitation of your psychic energy, and then take care and try not let it run dry. Also, it’s good to use more of your psychic energy daily which will help to improve in your manipulation that will be very useful for the future battles.”\nZhang XiaoBai stared at Xiang Xu who articulated clearly and said with an overwhelming emotion: “Xiang Xu, I feel like you are our intelligence officer! Gu Ning, where did you find Xiang Xu from?”\nXiang Xu glanced at Gu Ning with a slight smirk, as if to say, look, I didn’t disappoint you, right?\nAfter figuring out the aspect of things, it was time to get ready to head out for the actual battle.\nThose three soldiers who died made Brother San feel so guilty, too many people had died since the apocalypse started, everyone around them was dying every day, those they knew and/or didn’t, friends, relatives, comrades, families…… were going away so fast that they didn’t have the time to grieve for these people and new news of deaths piled up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThey were already used to avoiding discussions about those who had died.\nHowever, Brother San still tried, as much as possible, to keep those who were still alive safe.\nTherefore, Brother San decided to let those who had not developed their powers, including Gu Ning and Xiang Yi, stay at the colony and wait for the rest to return with the crystal cores.\nGu Ning refused the idea: “I disagree with this distribution.” Gu Ning looked solemnly at Brother San and continued: “If we are all destined not to have any special abilities, then now is the best opportunity to train. Ordinary people have to find a way to survive too, instead of cowering under the protection of the special abilities users. At least that’s what I believe.”\nXiang Yi shrugged self-deprecatingly: “I’ve tried many times, and although I’m not giving up, it’s just possible that I will always remain as an ordinary person. I agree with her, we ordinary people have to find a way to survive too.”\nThe four soldiers who had been assigned to stay behind yesterday reacted even more strongly and requested Brother San for them to join in the hunting too.\nBrother San was triggered by what Gu Ning had said, and then he got a headache from the soldiers who were protesting, so he simply dumped the task to Gu Ning: “Then what do you think, how to arrange it?”\n“My parents will stay behind to guard, Huang MengYao, Shi Tou, and Luo Long are staying too.” Gu Ning looked at Hong Jie and asked: “What about you, Hong Jie?”\nHong Jie pointed at Brother San with her chin and replied: “He’s already so old and yet he can still head out, so I certainly won’t be a burden for you guys too.”\n“What about me……” Not sure when but the tightly closed partitioned sliding door where the children were sleeping was pushed ajar. A twelve or thirteen-year-old teenager stood there in a timid manner, seeing everyone’s gazes were fixed on him, he timidly lowered his head slightly. Yet this young teenager gathered his courage to look at Gu Ning and asked: “Can I go out with you all to kill the monsters?” He tried to make himself look as brave as possible by puffing his skinny chest out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf it were usual, these adults might have laughed out loud, but right now, no one was laughing.\nJia DaoZhang walked over and ruffled the child’s hair very roughly into a mess before asking: “What’s your name?”\nHis eyelids were one single and one double layer, his skin tone was slightly darker, but he looked very young and delicate. He smoothly combed his hair which had been ruffled by Jia DaoZhang and replied without getting angry: “Wu Sen.”\n“How old are you?”\n“I’m already thirteen!”\nJia DaoZhang shook his head: “Too young!”\n“What about her? She is even younger than me.” Wu Sen pointed at Xiang Xu with his slightly dirty finger.\n“Hey kid, she is even stronger than me!” Zhang XiaoBai smiled while explaining.\nXiang Xu glared at Wu Sen before giving a light hum.\nWu Sen was half convinced.\nBrother San chimed: “Kid, wait until you can hold a gun steadily before you can go out with us. Gu Ning, it’s getting late, let’s head out already.”\nGu Ning nodded, placing her gun behind her back, took another long knife which she had found previously and held it in her hand then followed the main group out.\nAs compared to previous excitement for hunting, they were feeling a bit more uneasy now. Those who had their powers developed seemed confident and determined to score well this time.\nGu Ning went into the truck with Brother San.\n“We’re not in a hurry to collect the crystal cores this time, plus the walkie-talkies are all scrapped, let’s just maintain as a team this time. Gu Ning, what do you think?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning nodded and replied: “Mn. If we encounter small waves of zombies, let those who haven’t developed their powers kill the zombies then. You guys are mainly responsible for protecting and supporting the attack. If there are larger waves of zombies, then it will be up to you guys to rush to the front.”\nBrother San agreed: “I thought so too.”\nWhile the trucks were moving out, those people who had already developed their powers didn’t remain idle but they were busy training and exercising their proficiency in using their special abilities.\nAs the two military trucks that were carrying Gu Ning and the others gradually moved away.\nA giant red SUV pulled up in front of the colony gate.\nSuch a conspicuous car immediately attracted a lot of attention as soon as it was parked in front of the entrance.\nThe front door of the car was opened.\nA long, slender leg stepped out of the car before a voluptuous beauty with red hair got out of the car while casually tossing her red hair aside. She stood still and looked at the colony gate in front of her before sighing in relief. Then she went to the back and opened the car door as a pale young man leaned back in his reclining chair and opened his eyes weakly, glanced at the view faintly before asking: “Found the place to stop?”\nIf Gu Ning was here, she would have been very shocked to find that these two people were none other than Zhuang Chen and Fang Fa, who should be on their way to the capital.\nZhuang Chen took a glance at the bandaged wound on Fang Fa’s thigh, and then his pale face. Her beautiful eyebrows furrowed then replied: “Wait for a moment, I’ll ask them to open up the gate.” Then with her long slender legs, she walked towards the gate. Fang Fa nodded and then closed his eyes again weakly.\nZhuang Chen walked to the gate and asked the guards: “Please open the gate, our car is going in.”\nThe guards glanced at each other and then replied to Zhuang Chen: “We need to check.”\nZhuang Chen raised her eyebrow and glanced back at the car.\nThe two guards went out and walked to the car and pushed open the door to see Fang Fa lying in the car. When they saw the wound on Fang Fa’s thigh that had been bandaged haphazardly and after a glance at each other they rejected Zhuang Chen: “Sorry, our rule here is that people who are injured are not allowed to enter the colony.” Ever since Gu Ning had killed Wang JiZhong’s nephew at the gate, the quality and politeness of the guards’ attitude had all greatly improved. They feared that they would end up in the same situation if they pissed off someone they couldn’t afford to piss off.\nThey were so courteous that Zhuang Chen was unable to get angry but just frowned and explained: “The wound on his leg is not a zombie bite, it is from a knife cut, but he still cannot enter?”\n“Sorry, this is our colony’s rule, we have no choice either ——“\n“Zhuang Chen?” Suddenly, a voice of surprise rang out.\nZhuang Chen was slightly startled and glanced over towards the direction of the voice, her eyebrows raised on one side, and was also very surprised: “Yin Qi?” Her facial expression changed when her eyes landed to the side of the white-shirted man: “Yin Sang, you’re here too.”\nThe two people who inadvertently passed by the gate were none other than the man in a white shirt and Yin Sang. They were also a little surprised to see Zhuang Chen as they thought that Zhuang Chen and the others should have gone back to the capital a long time ago.\nA guard looked at Yin Qi respectfully and asked: “Master Seven, her friend is injured. Should we let them in?”\nBefore Yin Qi could reply, Yin Sang replied coldly: “No entry.”\nYin Qi frowned and glanced at Yin Sang: “Yin Sang?!\nZhuang Chen, however, did not even look at Yin Sang and just stared at Yin Qin and said: “Yin Qi, since both of you, are here, then Bai Lang should be here too. So since you refused to open the gate, then call him out and I will speak to him personally.”\n“You——“ Yin Sang only managed to utter a word before it came to an abrupt halt as a strand of her hair got cut from her bangs and brushed past her brow as it slowly fell to the ground.\nZhang Chen glared at her with a sharp gaze and said in a cold voice: “If you don’t shut up, I’ll make you shut up forever.”\nYin Qi stared at Zhuang Chen in shock: “Wind special ability——“\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ahhh… Fang Fa is injured and hurray to Zhuang Chen for gaining wind special ability! Next chapter will be slowly prepping up for the hunt again~ Thank you all for reading and stay tune for next week! =))\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "60": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-60/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYin Sang looked gloomily at the strand of her hair on the ground, then stared at Zhuang Chen who was standing outside the main gate: “Zhuang Chen, you want to die?!” With a raised hand, the psychic energy gushed out frantically and abruptly! Countless vines broke out from the ground in front of her! They were growing at a terrifying speed, like countless tentacles from the earth flying straight up into the sky, and then abruptly changed direction in the air and flew directly over the gate towards Zhuang Chen!\nZhuang Chen’s expression was frozen, but she had no fear, her gaze was stern and a fierce wind rose! Hearing the sound of gusting wind, countless wind blades spun around Zhuang Chen. Then, with a single wave of her hand, the blades spun around her sped out from her side and towards the vines that had tangled and twisted together like a huge ordeal that was crushing down towards her! The sound of air slashes could be heard continuously! Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! The sound of things being cut and sliced by sharp weapons kept ringing out, and in an instant, the wind blades had severed those vines all over the sky, and then one by one, those severed vines dropped from the air.\n\n\n\nSeveral wind blades broke through the vines and raced forward, slashing directly towards Yin Sang’s face!\nYin Sang was horrified.\nSeveral swishes! Those wind blades were struck on the earth wall that appeared out of thin air. Yin Qi frowned at Zhuang Chen: “Zhuang Chen, are you trying to kill her?”\nZhuang Chen replied with an icy tone: “She was the one who wanted to kill me first.”\nThe moment those words were spoken, Yin Sang suddenly cried out in pain and covered her face. A thin fine cut by the wind blade instantly oozed blood out and stained her palm, she stared at Zhuang Chen in disbelief and her face turned pale.\nInstead, Zhuang Chen didn’t even look at her but directed at Yin Qi: “Since you refuse to educate this sister of yours, I’ll do it for you. If she is still so rude to her elders next time, I won’t be just slicing that face of hers.” After saying that, she glanced at Yin Sang who was glaring at her with resentful eyes, Zhuang Chen continued faintly: “If you ever look at me with such a disgusting look again, I’ll gouge your eyes out.”\nYin Qi said to Yin Sang: “Go and find Dr. Gao first.”\nYin Sang covered her face in disbelief: “Ge?!”\nYin Qi wrinkled his brows and continued: “Do you really want to die?”\nYin Sang’s pupils shrank and her expression changed immediately. She knew that Zhuang Chen’s words were not just an empty threat. In the past, Zhuang Chen was already bold and reckless, but right now she was even bolder without the restraint of the law. Thus, Yin Sang had to put up with the humiliation and cover her face as she turned around and walked towards the infirmary. Until the end, she didn’t even dare to look at Zhuang Chen again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhuang Chen glanced at Yin Qi and asked: “So, are you going to open the gate to let me in now or are you going to help me to call Bai Lang over?”\nYi Qi glanced at Zhuang Chen then ordered coldly to the guards who had been completely stunned by the battle just now which had exceeded their understanding: “Open the gate.”\nIt took those guards a moment to react and rush over to open the gate.\nZhuang Chen got into the car and said to Fang Fa: “It’s done.” Then she drove into the colony.\n“Zhuang Chen, why are you here? Shouldn’t you already be in the capital by now?” Bai Lang was slightly surprised by Zhuang Chen’s sudden appearance before returning to his normal state.\nZhuang Chen’s expression was unspeakably grim at the mention of this: “Don’t mention it again, it was difficult to contact the capital and when they agreed to send a plane to pick me up, the plane was hijacked and I almost died. If it wasn’t for that little police, you wouldn’t be able to see me now.”\n“No wonder, it’s unlike your style to travel with a wounded man during this situation.” Bai Lang asked: “But who would be so daring to hijack your plane? If I had the chance, I’d really like to meet them.”\nChuang Chen snorted coldly: “You know those people. *Lie Ying.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n(T/N: 猎鹰 Liè Yīng means Falcon.)\nBai Lang was stunned for a moment, then replied: “Tch, these guys are that bold? How dare they make a move on you?”\nZhuang Chen replied lightly: “They probably thought I wouldn’t survive. Who knew that not only was I alive, but thanks to their blessing, I had developed a special ability. When we meet again, I will let them feel what it means to die by a thousand slashes.”\nBai lang exaggeratedly winced then said: “I definitely wouldn’t dare to offend you anyway. But what about Ji JiuZe and Yi ShaoQing? Didn’t they come together with you to Jinyong?” Bai Lang continued with malicious intent: “They wouldn’t have been eaten, would they?”\nZhuang Chen rolled her eyes at him: “Do you think Ji JiuZe looks like someone who would be eaten by zombies? We ran into a zombie swarm and got scattered. Seeing that you’ve got it pretty good here, you’re not going to use this place as your base, are you?”\n“I’d like to.” Bai Lang suddenly withdrew his usual cynical look on his face and replied solemnly: “As you should have noticed, it’s not just humans, the whole world is changing now. The zombies are getting stronger and there are even zombie beasts. We can’t protect this place for too long. I’m going to leave Jinyong after all the people under my command have developed their powers and go to the downtown area to collect enough supplies.”\nZhuang Chen asked: “Getting ready to head back to the capital?”\nBai Lang replied: “Where else could we go? After all, the military is the strongest there, and no matter what, the zombies can’t break through the capital right?” He paused and said half-jokingly to Zhuang Chen: “Besides, I’ve been away from home for too long, so it’s good to have a chance to go home for a visit.”\nZhuang Chen, however, suddenly thought of something else and asked; “I see that you have gathered a lot of survivors here, so, have you ever seen such a person?”\n“A female, in her twenties, wearing black sportswear, with short blonde hair……”\nThe more Bai Lang listened, the stranger the expression on his face became and he couldn’t help but interrupt Zhuang Chen: “Wait, the name of this person you’re looking for wouldn’t be Gu Ning right?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhuang Chen was flabbergasted: “How do you know?” Then came the realization: “You’ve seen her?!”\nBai Lang was also stunned for a moment, not expecting for it to match, and replied: “Not only have I met her, but she is also now in the colony.”\nThen involuntarily he asked: “Do you have a grudge against her too?”\nZhuang Chen replied: “Of course not, where did I get that many enemies! That little girl is a friend of mine. She’s very strong!”\nBai Lang snorted: “What’s so great about her, you don’t even acknowledge Yin Sang, while she can’t even beat her. It seems like you really hate Yin Sang.”\n“First of all, let me get this straight, It’s not that I hate Yin Sang, It’s just that she’s so annoying. Furthermore ——“ Zhuang Chen said with a straight face: “Yin Sang has been studying martial arts for over ten years, and Gu Ning was just an ordinary girl three months ago. Maybe now Gu Ning still can’t beat Yin Sang, but I believe she will be able to do so soon.”\n“It’s the first time I’ve seen you speak so highly of a woman.” Bai Lang was slightly taken aback.\n“That’s because she’s worth it.” Zhuang Chen smiled faintly and continued: “You should spend some time with her if you have the chance, and I’m sure you’ll agree with me too.”\nBai Lang raised his eyebrows and replied indifferently: “Really?”\nDoctor Gao came out of the room, interrupting the pleasant conversation between the two of them.\n“The wound is a bit deep and shows signs of infection, so stitches will have to be performed. But I’ve run out of the haemostatic anesthetic and also the sutures left by Gu Ning the last time I was here.\nBai Lang instantly reacted: “Don’t look at me, the medicine I’ve gathered has long been used up.”\nZhuang Chen immediately frowned and glanced at Bai Lang and asked: ” Where is Gu Ning? Where is she now?”\nAfter learning that Gu Ning had gone out, Zhuang Chen also prepared to head out, mainly to find medicine for Fang Fa. It just so happened that Bai Lang and the others were also heading out, so Zhuang Chen left Fang Fa in the infirmary and got into Bai Lang’s car while Yin Sang was forced to stay guard at the colony by Yin Qi.\nOn the other hand, Gu Ning was completely unaware that Zhuang Chen and Fang Fa had already arrived at the colony and right now, were discussing if they should head deeper into the downtown area or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San and the others were all confident, stating that although there were many zombies, they had all managed to escape from there the other day. Right now, with so many special abilities users, it would be even safer.\nGu Ning said cautiously: “There are too many zombies there, and the zombies evolved earlier than the humans, so it’s hard to guarantee that more powerful evolved zombies won’t appear in a place with such a high density.”\nBrother San explained: “The last time we accidentally broke in, we found that all the supermarket shops and stuff were basically untouched, and in terms of the situation now, it’s the same as a mountain of gold and silver piled in there. Jinyong city is so big, in places we don’t know, there might even be some special abilities users that were hiding while eyeing on those supplies as well…… And if it’s true that while we’re getting stronger, the zombies are also evolving, then won’t it be the same if we don’t enter it now or in the future.”\nGu Ning was silent.\n“I know you’re worried about our safety.” Brother said as he squeezed Gu Ning’s shoulder: “But like you said at the colony, we can only get stronger when we fight in actual combat.”\nGu Ning knew that Brother San was right, and the supplies were becoming increasingly scarce. As Brother San had said, there was no way to tell how many people were now eyeing the supplies in that part of the downtown area, so if they didn’t take advantage of the situation now, they might not even have crumbs. She glanced at the others, who all seemed to be waiting for her to make the final call. Not sure since when she had become in the same position as Brother San in the group for decision making.\nOn the contrary, because of this, Gu Ning felt that the responsibility on her shoulders was getting too heavy. She glanced at Brother San, knowing that such a situation might be caused by his intention. She should thank him for looking up to her, but this responsibility was too heavy for her to bear and Gu Ning struggled slightly in her heart before finally saying: “You should decide, Brother San.”\nBrother San seemed to sense the meaning of Gu Ning’s glance and was slightly disappointed but then he lifted his spirits and said with a grin: “Let’s go then! Let’s do a big job this time!”\n\n(T/N: Woots! Next chapters would be battling scene again =) The battle crossover into two chapters, so I would upload them together.

The puddles were then shattered by pairs of feet stepping on it, those footsteps moved further into the area that was once bustling before the apocalypse started. But now, it was filled with dead silence.\n\n\n\nIf anyone could stand in the sky and glance down, they would see the entire pedestrian street was crowded with decapitated heads, and upon closer inspection, they would see the horrifying mutilated faces etched on those heads. The whole length of the street is full of such scenes, and countless other streets also had similar circumstances everywhere.\nIt was a normal day when the apocalypse happened. A fine Sunday, the sun was shining and the weather was just nice. It was a good day for taking a stroll or doing some shopping. Golden Gate Street was crowded with young people making good use of the holiday to enjoy their time or go shopping.\nThen the sun abruptly disappeared and reappeared later.\nPeople lost their consciousness for no reason, collapsed, and woke up again. The bestie whom they linked arm in arm with for shopping a while ago, pounced and bit their neck off in the next minute. The people who suddenly collapsed were immediately sent to hospital, where they woke up and bit the nurses —— one spread to another, since they were in the densely populated areas, the cases multiplied exponentially. Many people turned into zombies without even knowing what happened.\nThe government sent countless search and rescue teams in, but to no avail, not a single team returned. Later, they sent in helicopters to hover over Golden Gate Street. The shocking and gruesome images were so horrifying that even the video footage taken was too bloody and tragic to be circulated out.\nHowever, even so, a very large number of survivors who escaped from Golden Gate Street took lots of videos during the chaotic period and uploaded them online. The bloody and realistic scenes of being pounced on and gnawed on by zombies surpassed the gore in any horror film.\nIt had been more than three months since the apocalypse happened. What kind of tragic scenes would be on Golden Gate Street, Gu Ning didn’t know, but her nerves were already tensed to the max at this moment. She felt a strong sense of ominous premonition, and the closer she got to Golden Gate Street, the stronger this premonition became.\nIt seemed that the aura of dead silence was getting stronger, and those who had been laughing and joking at the beginning began to quieten in unison, walking forward with serious and tense expressions. The only sound in the street was the sound of their feet stepping and splashing through the puddles.\nXiang Xu walked beside Gu Ning with a tense and serious look. Such a look that appeared on the face of a small girl was not funny but was even more alarming. She didn’t need any reminder and had very consciously launched her spiritual powers and worked as an automatic radar, spreading out to cover the surroundings—— At the same time, trying to probe further into the area. When Gu Ning absorbed the psychic energy previously, she had also gained a little benefit from her and her psychic energy had obviously increased.\nIn an alleyway just a block away, almost five hundred meters away from them, there was a huge ball of flesh that looked like it was curled up into an indistinct shape. It looked like a living creature and it seemed to be breathing. Xiang Xu’s spiritual energy roamed over the huge ball of flesh, but it didn’t sense anything, as if it was just passing through the air, and then continued to spread forward unnoticed——\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe ball of flesh as if sensing something, the head that was originally buried inside the flesh slowly raised, and then the huge body slowly squirmed——\nGu Ning suddenly stopped in her tracks, gazed in a direction, feeling vaguely uneasy, and couldn’t help but ask: “Xiang Xu, did you find anything?”\nXiang Xu’s spiritual energy returned the message that no abnormalities were found so she replied: “No.”\nHowever, Gu Ning’s brows knitted: “Not even a single zombie?”\nXiang Xu realised what Gu Ning was referring to and her little face turned slightly paler: “No.”\nBrother San, who was walking at the front, saw Gu Ning and Xiang Xu suddenly stop and immediately sensed that something was off. He stopped the group then came over and checked: “Gu Ning, what’s wrong?”\nGu Ning explained with a frown: “After we’ve entered this street, Xiang Xu didn’t even find a single trace of zombies.”\nNo matter what, this place was close to Golden Gate Street, which was supposed to be a roaming area for the zombies. But when they entered this area, not even mentioning the hordes of zombies missing, they still hadn’t encountered a single roaming zombie …… If this wasn’t because of their luck, then there was something out there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf something was abnormal, there were bound to be some problems.\nBrother San was no fool either, so as soon as he heard this, he immediately knew what Gu Ning meant. He glanced around, it was eerily quiet, not even the wind was blowing, everything seemed to be silently still. Brother San frowned: “Something doesn’t seem right.”\nShasha ——\nJust as Brother San’s words ended, the sound of something dragging and scraping against the ground rustled—— The sound was so sudden that it made everyone tense up at once. What made them even more nervous was that Xiang Xu did not detect it, yet the rustling sound continued and it was getting closer and closer —— Everyone’s expressions were seriously getting tense and nervous.\nGu Ning jerked her head in the direction of the sound that was coming from, and although she couldn’t see anything yet, the hairs on the back of her neck had stood up! An ominous feeling rose to the highest level and her instincts told her that she should get out of here! Without much thought, she shouted: “Pull back!”\nEveryone who had been so startled by the sudden rustling sound that they didn’t know what to do was instantly jolted out of that creepy situation and then followed Gu Ning as they desperately retreated. Not knowing what made the rustling sound, but for some reason, they had a very bad feeling about it.\nDespite their fear, they had already experienced many life-and-death situations, and instead of panicking, they maintained their formation with special abilities users on the outer rim while those without the abilities remained inwards. They retreated quickly in the direction they came from!\nThose rustling sounds were getting louder and closer as if it knew that they were running away and had picked up its speed to chase them! Gu Ning could feel it getting faster and faster!\nBrother San shouted: “Run!”\nOnce again the group gritted their teeth and picked up their speed and ran!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAlthough Xiang Xu was mature, she was just an eight years old child. No matter how hard she gritted her teeth, she still couldn’t run fast enough. Suddenly, she was lifted and was thrown onto Gu Ning’s back, then Gu Ning piggybacked her and continued running.\nWithout having to look at the road, Xiang Xu glanced backward, and instantly her little face went white with fear, unable to describe what she was seeing.\nYet at the very moment she glanced back, that thing had aimed at her as well and suddenly, out of nowhere, what looked like a ball of flesh extended an arm-think tentacle! The tentacle flung itself up and stretched out towards Xiang Xu! The tentacle came with great speed! Xiang Xu didn’t have time to react, only to feel an object slapped on her back, then like a suction cup sucked on her back, she was lifted and pulled out from Gu Ning’s back with great force! The tentacle sucked Xiang Xu and immediately retracted back, and Xiang Xu could only have the time to scream in surprise before she was lifted into the sky by the tentacle!\nGu Ning was carrying Xiang Xu and dashing forward, but suddenly she felt a lightness on her back, accompanied by Xiang Xu’s shriek. Gu Ning knew it was bad, but she inertially dashed forward a few steps before jerking to a halt and looking back. She saw Xiang Xu being sucked backward by a fleshy tentacle! Too stunned to see what the tentacle was, she flew the knife in her hand directly at the retracting tentacle!\nGu Ning’s strength was so strong, that the knife flew out with great precision and aimed at the middle section of the tentacle!\nAt the same time as the knife flew out, Gu Ning also rushed over instantly! She ran at an astonishing speed in a single burst! The knife went pfft—— a precise hit at the tentacle! The tentacle was so tough that it was only injured with a bloody slash by the flying knife! Yet as if it knew pain, the suction cups tightened up and lost their suction power, and Xiang Xu fell straight down from the sky!\n“Xiang Xu!” Xiang Yi shrieked and rushed over too.\nGu Ning had already reached and held out both her arms, Xiang Xu screamed in shock as she fell from the sky and right into Gu Ning’s arms. The tremendous swooping force crushed Gu Ning’s hands downwards with a vigorous sink. Gu Ning held on Xiang Xu tightly and rolled on the ground, breaking away the force on her hands while avoiding the unidentified grey and blackish liquid that had spilled out from the wound of the slashed tentacle.\nGu Ning rolled to the side with Xiang Xu still in her arms and yelled at those who hadn’t reacted yet: “Special abilities users attack! The rest retreat!” Meanwhile, she handed Xiang Xu, who was so scared that she couldn’t even speak to Xiang Yi who was frightened till the point that his soul almost left him. She hurriedly picked up the knife on the ground and moved backward.\nWith the yell from Gu Ning, instantly all the psychic powers appeared out of nowhere, and all aimed and attacked the monster!\nThe fastest was Cheng Ming’s wind blades and Zhang XiaoBai’s lightning strikes. The invisible and shapeless wind blades and the lightning strikes that flashed with electricity were in front of the monster in the blink of an eye!\nIt only then did they have a good look at the “monster” that had caused them so much fear. It’s very difficult to describe what it was. It was like a huge building ball of flesh, yet the flesh on the side of the ball was flopping and “flowing” on the ground, and what was even more frightening was that the head of this ball was a normal human head, a normal human head on top of an immense ball of flesh. It looked as abrupt, incongruous, and disgusting as it could be. Not to mention the fact that this ball of flesh was growing out many tentacles as thick as arms, it was hard to imagine how a normal human being could become like this.\nProbably this could be another form of zombie mutation. After getting a very good look at the mutated zombie, the visual impact on everyone was overpowering and created a feeling of extreme discomfort. Not to mention the stench emanating from the grey-blackish sticky liquid that oozed out after being attacked by psychic energies.\nAlthough the countless psychic power attacks seemed to be devastating and made a lot of wounds on the mutated zombie, none of it caused any major damages. Seemingly sensing that these psychic powers attacks couldn’t cause devastating damage to itself for the meantime, the mutated zombie suddenly opened its mouth and hissed. Four or five tentacles stretched out from its body and swung towards them! It had officially launched an attack!\nWhile Gu Ning was backing up, she clearly saw that the tips of those tentacles were in the shape of flared openings. Recalling that Xiang Xu had just been sucked into the air by the tentacles, she immediately warned out loudly: “Be careful of the suction cups on the tentacles!”\nBrother San and the others also saw the scene where Xiang Xu was sucked into the air by those tentacles and knew how strong it was. Seeing that four or five tentacles that flung towards them as fast as it could go, they were as if on the verge of facing their worst nemesis!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Quick quick, press the next chapter button!

    "62": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-62/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBy this time, no one remembered Xiang Xu’s words about the consequences of depleting their psychic energy, and everyone went all out using it madly without any care!\nThe wind blades around Cheng Ming’s body continued to manifest, then under his control, they spun at high speed and flew towards the tentacles! At the same time, he could also feel the energy in his body depleting at a terrifying rate!\n\n\n\nMutated wind powers were so deadly that each wind blade cut a bloody gash on the tentacle.\nZhang XiaoBai opened his arms widely, countless streaks of lightning roamed in between his arms, illuminating his young face as those thunderbolts sizzled and burst out, shooting towards those tentacles! As soon as the lightning hit the tentacles, a burnt, mushy smell emanated and greatly reduced the sensitivity of those tentacles!\nHowever, those tentacles, which could reach at least six or seven metres in length, were extremely responsive! Dodging left and right, tumbling up and down, it actually managed to dodge most of the attacks of the psychic powers which they had sent out. What’s even more frightening was that apart from Cheng Ming and Zhang XiaoBai’s special psychic powers that were difficult to defend against, those like the earth spikes, water arrow, and ice prisms sent out by Brother San, Zhong Xu, and Jia DaoZhang, and the others could hardly even do any damage. It was slapped away by the tentacles before it could even get close to the main head——\nGu Ning commanded Hong Jie and the others who didn’t have any special abilities to stay away from the fight, then watched as the attacks of the psychic powers they had sent out were all knocked away. She was so anxious that she called out to Jia DaoZhang: “Jia DaoZhang! Try and see if you can freeze it up!”\nJia DaoZhang was stunned at first, then the psychic energy in his body surged wildly while his expression was cold and solemn. His robe, which had been burnt to half its size, was swept up by the wind from Cheng Ming’s wind blade and it made him look like a worldly expert as he thrust his hands vigorously at the creature! A wave of cold air swept towards the mutated zombie —— Ka ka ka —— and the ground began to freeze three metres away from the creature and then quickly spread towards it ——\nThe only sound that could be heard was the sound of the ice freezing and Jia DaoZhang was overjoyed: “It’s frozen!” The smile on Jia DaoZhang’s face froze as he heard a cracking sound —— The thin layer of ice that had covered some part of the creature cracked a few times before it shattered to the ground. The smile on Jia DaoZhang’s face also shattered.\nJust when he was lost in thoughts, plak! With a loud slap, his chest was stuck by a disgusting suction cup, and even some unidentified slime splashed onto his face. Before Jia DaoZhang could react, a huge suction force came from his chest, and then his whole body flew up in the air towards the mutated zombie!\nJia DaoZhang flung his hands and feet in the air and struggled desperately: “Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! Help! ! ! !” He tried to snap off the suction cup with his hands, however, the suction was planted firmly on his chest, and no matter how hard he struggled, he just couldn’t break away from it.\nBrother San and the others tried to rescue him, but the zombie stretched out a few more tentacles from nowhere, leaving them too busy and distracted for the rescue!\nGu Ning saw that the mutated zombies’ ball-like body had somehow opened up a big flesh-coloured hole the size of a basin and the tentacle was tugging Jia DaoZhang towards the hole fast! If Jia DaoZhang gets stuffed into that hole, he would lose his life. Although the speed was slowed down because Jia DaoZhang had frozen that tentacle, it was only a matter of time before he was dragged into that hole! Meanwhile, a tentacle swung towards Gu Ning!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Cheng Ming caught a glimpse of it, he was startled: “Gu Ning, watch out!” Yet he saw Gu Ning standing there motionlessly as if she didn’t even see the tentacle that was rapidly coming towards her! He was about to send a few wind blades over, but he saw Gu Ning slightly adjust her posture and shouted coldly: “Don’t mind me!”\nDuring the moment that Cheng Ming was stunned, plak! The sound rang out again! A suction cup stuck onto Gu Ning’s abdomen! Although Gu Ning was prepared for it, the suction from the huge slimy suction cups felt like countless insects were moving around that could be felt even through the clothing, which made Gu Ning very uncomfortable. However, she didn’t have to feel this disgusting feeling for long, as the next moment her feet were dangling in the air. The tentacle had first sucked her, thrown her body into the mid-air, which caused her to feel a sense of dizziness and weightlessness immediately, and then she was dragged by the tentacles which retracted rapidly!\nWhen Jia DaoZhang saw that even Gu Ning had been sucked in by the suction cups, he had a feeling in his heart that was as good as being dead.\nSeeing that she was getting closer to the mutated zombie, Gu Ning estimated that she was nearly four or five meters off the ground and immediately raised her voice and shouted to Brother San: “Brother San! Ready the earth wall!”\nBrother San first froze then shouted to Cheng Ming: “Cheng Ming! Help me hold up first!”\nCheng Ming was stunned, then once again began to mobilize the already little psychic energy left in his body, and then summoned doubled the number of wind blades, drawing the attention of two tentacles away from Brother San.\nBrother San was able to focus now and watched Gu Ning closely, waiting for her next move.\nWhen Gu Ning saw that Brother San was ready, she gripped the knife in her hand tightly and used all her strength to slash directly at the tentacle that was sucking on her! Even Cheng Ming’s wind blade could only cut a bloody slit on the tentacle, yet Gu Ning managed to slice it off with a single slash! The mutated zombie howled in pain and retracted the remaining tentacles. The suction cups that were sucking on Gu Ning’s abdomen instantly lost their suction and fell off Gu Ning’s stomach and onto the ground with a bang, while Gu Ning also fell from the mid-air!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJia DaoZhang also took the opportunity to summon a prism of ice and stabbed it hard at the tentacle that was sucking him in! Then he fell, he was less than three metres off the ground, the violent fall caused him to twist his ankle. Although he was in a mess, he didn’t suffer any major injuries.\nOn the other hand, Gu Ning was falling from a height of five metres above the ground, and at that precise moment! Brother San aimed at the spot where Gu Ning was landing and pushed with both hands, and a wall of earth rose from the ground! It instantly rose to a height of two metres, Gu Ning managed to land on the top of the earth wall, and after bracing herself on the ground with one hand, cushioning most of the force, she stomped her feet and leaped up into the air in front of her!  At the moment she leaped up! Brother San earth psychic power surged out again, and another earth wall rose from the ground!\nGu Ning landed precisely above it and then leaped into the air again. This time without the earth wall as her landing point was on the mutated zombie!\nThe whole process was like a flowing stream of water, unspeakably clean and smooth, and even in such a thrilling moment, it gave off the feeling of a beautiful motion.\nThe mutated zombie’s cloudy eyes suddenly lifted to look at Gu Ning, and those tentacles that were originally engaged with Cheng Ming, Zhong Xu, and the others, suddenly gave up on them and swung back hard towards Gu Ning!\nThe thickest of the tentacles was also the fastest to react! The tentacle was about to strike Gu Ning, but she seemed to be oblivious to it and refused to dodge at all.  She directly slashed her long knife down fiercely towards the head of the mutated zombie! The knife ruthlessly pierced into the head!\nThe mutated zombie was unlike the painless ordinary zombies, and its throat, which looked unusually slender compared to its huge body, let out an unbearable hiss of pain!\nThe next moment Gu Ning’s entire body was heavily smacked away by that tentacle! Gu Ning felt a sharp pain between her waist and abdomen, then the world spun around and her whole body flew!\n“Gu Ning!” Everyone was shocked by the flying Gu Ning, and all of them ran in that direction, trying to catch her before she hit the ground.\nHowever, the mutated zombie seemed to be completely enraged by Gu Ning and wasn’t going to just let her off the hook. As Gu Ning started to fall from the sky, the mutated zombie’s tentacles arrived again! With a slap, it sucked her back and ignored Gu Ning’s struggle, and swung her straight up into the air around seven or eight metres high! Then immediately slammed her heavily toward the ground!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWith this smash, if lucky, it would only cause serious injuries, if not, it might even cause death!\nBrother San, Cheng Ming, Jia DaoZhang, and the others were heartbroken and distressed at the sight of the scene! At this moment, they felt so helpless as all their powers were useless for such a situation!\nAt that very moment! Xiang Xu, who was being protected by the nervous Xiang Yi, resolutely took a step forward. Her clear childish face was filled with determination. She closed her eyes and for the first time, her spiritual power gushed out with any reservation! The spiritual power dashed madly towards that direction! The wind blade, the lightning strike, the mutated zombie’s tentacles were fast, yet they were no match with Xiang Xu’s spiritual power!\nAll that could be heard was the mutated zombie let out another incomparable hiss! The tentacles that had been sucking onto Gu Ning, lost their suction power, yet Gu Ning was still crushed by the initial force and slammed down hard towards the ground! When Gu Ning was halfway down from the smash, her body was suddenly supported by a force. Although it was only for a very brief moment or even less than a second, it cushioned most of the force for her before she was slammed into the ground with a loud thud.\nBrother San and the rest didn’t know that Xiang Xu had used her spiritual power to protect Gu Ning for that instant. When they saw Gu Ning fall to the ground, they were so scared that their legs went weak, Cheng Ming almost felt that his heart had stopped beating for that moment. Immediately, they had all rushed over to Gu Ning, yet when they were halfway there, they saw Gu Ning, who was lying motionlessly, start to move a little and struggle to get up from the ground.\nAs Xiang Xu watched Gu Ning rise from the ground, her originally tense nerves relaxed and this relaxation caused her to blackout right away.\n“Gu Ning! Are you alright?” Cheng Ming was the first one to reach her and hurriedly caught hold of Gu Ning’s swaying body. Brother San, Jia DaoZhang, Zhang XiaoBai, and the rest also arrived one after another. All of them were staring and checking out Gu Ning with nervousness and concern, fearing that Gu Ning had suffered serious injuries from the fall. Just now, they only felt scared and their minds were completely baffled. However, at this moment, when they saw that Gu Ning managed to stand up, they all had a burst of fear afterward in their heart, unable to imagine how they would feel if something happened to her.\nGu Ning felt pain all over her body, but she still shook her head and the first thing she did when she got up from the ground was to check out the mutated zombie. The tentacles seemed to have lost all of their strength and fell to the ground, rolling and coiling like snakes which seems extremely disgusting.\nThe large flesh-coloured hole in the body of the mutated zombie was now split wide open and was leaking out some foul-smelling fluid.\nThe mutated zombie, in turn, let out a wail of pain —— one after another ——\nWhen Gu Ning saw this scene, without any reason, instead of relaxing, an ominous feeling rose. The cry seemed to be not only a howl of pain but also as if it was calling out for its companion——\nGu Ning suddenly turned pale and shouted at them: “Kill it! It’s calling for help!”\nSeveral psychic powers attacked the ball of flesh all at once, and the mutated zombie which was already badly injured was now completely motionless.\nHowever, it was already too late.\nShasha ——\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShasha ——\nShasha ——\nWhen this nightmare-like sound rang out again, it was even louder than the first mutated zombie. The expression on everyone’s face turned extremely pale.\nGu Ning shouted to Hong Jie and the rest who were in the far distance: “Run! Quickly run!”\nThose rustling and dragging sounds were coming from that direction!\nThe safest zone just now had become the most dangerous area all of a sudden!\nHong Jie and the soldiers, all ran at full speed with all their might towards Gu Ning.\nGu Ning didn’t have the time to check on the injuries she had incurred, but she quickly instructed others: “Hurry up and replenish your psychic energy!” Her expression was as tense as never before: “Zhong Xu! Later I need you to make a downpour and give those monsters a bath. Zhang XiaoBai——“ Gu Ning took a look at Zhang XiaoBai’s pale face, obviously his powers were seriously depleted and Cheng Ming’s condition was not much better either. The two of them had the most psychic energy compared to the rest, and their attacks were also the strongest. Yet right now, Gu Ning could only order Jia DaoZhang instead: “Jia DaoZhang, prepare your ice psychic powers, and when the rain falls, freeze them all. The rest of you don’t attack and seize the time to recover your psychic energy! Retreat in the direction of the Eleventh Square later.”\nThe way for them to retreat had already been blocked by the mutated zombies and now they had no choice but to barge deeper into the downtown now.\nBrother San and the rest hurriedly took out the transparent crystal cores and stuffed them into their mouths, clearly feeling that the little psychic energy they had left was slowly replenishing. Xiang Yi had long fed Xiang Xu the transparent crystal core that Gu Ning had specially prepared for her to eat. However, Xiang Xu’s psychic powers were perhaps overdrawn and even after taking in the transparent crystal core, she still showed no signs of awakening.\nAfter Hong Jie and the soldiers had gathered with them, those rustling sounds were already approaching and then two mutated zombies with similar sizes showed up from the alleyway.\nIt was just a few dozen metres away.\nBrother San and the others all felt a suffocating wave of despair crowding over them. They had just faced only one mutated zombie in their prime condition and were already struggling so much. Yet, right now they were severely depleted of their psychic energy and had to face off with two mutated zombies, so one could imagine how desperate they felt.\nGu Ning stood at the front, no one could see her expression at this moment but her voice remained calm: “Brother San! Prepare the earth wall and surround them first! We’re going to freeze them into an icicle!”\nHearing Gu Ning’s calm and steady voice, everyone couldn’t help but feel their spirits lift.\nBrother San felt his psychic energy slowly replenish and he answered in a deep voice: “No problem!” Then he nervously stared at the two mutated zombies approaching them at a very fast pace—— So now he was waiting for them to enter the range of his psychic powers and he would launch his attack immediately!\nZhong Xu and Jia DaoZhang, who had been named by Gu Ning, felt even more pressured and seized every second to absorb the psychic energy brought by the transparent crystal cores.\nGu Ning continued in a deep voice: “Hong Jie! If we can’t stop them, prepare to shoot!”\nHong Jie and the soldiers didn’t have any doubt, their guns’ safeties had long been unlocked, just waiting for the order to fire. At that moment, they all raised their guns and aimed at the two mutated zombies in the distance.\nGu Ning didn’t want to use the guns unless they were left with no choice, they couldn’t afford to alert the whole downtown area since it was filled with zombies. However, right now it was getting close to that last resort and that would be their last line of defence ——\nSeeing that the two mutated zombies had already reached around twenty meters away from them, Gu Ning yelled: “Brother San!”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Woooots!

At the same time, several earth walls rose from the ground almost simultaneously twenty meters away!\nFour wide earth walls fit tightly together and enclosed like a cage!\n\n\n\nThe two mutated zombies were trapped in this cage and slammed headlong into the wall! However, these four walls were forged by Brother San with almost all his powers so they were strong and it would be difficult for the mutated zombies to break through them for a while! Without waiting for Gu Ning to give the order, Zhong Xu silently took a step forward and raised his hands. A huge stream of water appeared out of thin air and rained down into the cage! A constant stream of water poured in and filled it!\nThe water was rushing down on them with such a huge force that both mutated zombies became very angry and banged into the wall even harder! At the same time, the tentacles flew out as if to break the current, yet even a boulder could not block the way, and how could just a few tentacles stop the current? The flesh-coloured tentacles waved haphazardly over the cage and that made the whole scene look so terrifying and shocking——\nAs the cage was about to be filled, Zhong Xu shouted: “Jia DaoZhang!”\nJia DaoZhang took a step forward, crouched down, and braced his hands on the ground, releasing all his psychic energy as the ice psychic powers spread rapidly from his hands towards the cage!\nTransparent crystals emerged from the ground and quickly covered the cage. The water inside the cage quickly became cold and then began to freeze. However, because the two mutated zombies kept struggling around, it was not that easy to form the ice. With the grit of his teeth, Jia DaoZhang once again mobilized the pitiful amount of psychic energy remaining in his body, the depletion caused his face to turn pale in an instant, and finally —— The water inside the cage began to freeze —— The two mutated zombies’ meatball-like bodies were frozen with the water and then the cold air spread rapidly, trailing along the tentacles that were still flailing and reeling. Almost everyone breathed a sigh of relief when the strangely posed tentacles were finally frozen in ice.\nJia DaoZhang was paralyzed on the ground and couldn’t even get up.\nBrother San, Zhong Xu, and Jia DaoZhang immediately replenished their psychic energy with the transparent crystal core.\nGu Ning had given out two transparent crystal cores to each of them beforehand so that they could replenish their powers and she still had more than ten of them left in her hands.\nHowever, just when Gu Ning was halfway relieving her breath, she was choked. An extremely subtle cracking sound reached her ears, and Gu Ning snapped her eyes towards the two frozen mutated zombies.\nGu Ning exclaimed: “The ice won’t freeze them for too long, run!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShe was about to turn around after saying those words when a sharp pain shot through her knees and she almost fell to her knees. Fortunately, she was held by Cheng Ming who asked anxiously: “Gu Ning, are you alright?”\nGu Ning wanted to reply that she was fine, but the sharp pain coming from her knee rendered her speechless.\nSeeing that Gu Ning’s face paled, Brother San knew that Gu Ning must have taken a bad fall just now, so he quickly instructed: “Luo Long! Go carry Gu Ning on your back!”\nCheng Ming wanted to carry her but he did not have enough strength to do so. His psychic energy was severely depleted and he didn’t have much energy to run with someone on his back now.\nLuo Long has a gold element psychic power and during the fight just now, he didn’t contribute much. After listening to Brother San’s instruction, he crouched down and carried Gu Ning on his back without saying a word, then the group hurriedly ran towards the downtown area while the two mutated zombies were still thawing.\nAs they passed by the dead mutated zombie, Gu Ning remembered: “Brother San, go and check if there’s any crystal core.”\nSurprisingly, he really dug out a bright green crystal core.\nGu Ning was crouched on Luo Long’s back, her knees ached as he ran fast and she could only grit her teeth and bear with it, while her forehead was drenched in a cold sweat. Not to mention the fact that Xiang Xu, who acts as a radar was still unconscious, so Gu Ning dared not relax and kept vigilant to check for any unusual situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFortunately, these mutated zombies occupied these few streets for some reason which caused the remaining zombies to dare not enter here, so they ran without encountering any other zombies.\nBrother San ran beside Gu Ning and said: “There’s a basement over at Eleventh Square, let’s go there and hide for a while.”\nGu Ning nodded weakly.\nThey were large in numbers and although they made a great mess facing the mutated zombie, they could still handle those ordinary zombies. Moreover, their powers were slowly replenished, and they took turns to fight and managed to struggle their way into the Eleventh Square.\nAfter hurriedly descending the stairs, Brother San blocked the doorway with several earth walls to block away from the impact of the zombies that were chasing after them. They breathed out a sigh of relief, then the group all went down the basement. Brother San and some of them had been here before so they were familiar with the surroundings.\nZhang XiaoBai raised his hand, with lightning wrapped around it, it was actually very bright and could be used perfectly like a torch.\nInside the room had a small bed, Xiang Yi placed Xiang Xu carefully on the bed while Luo Long placed Gu Ning on a stool and the others gathered around.\nBrother San ran his hand over Gu Ning’s knee and carefully pressed it a few times, his face was grave: “It seems to be a fracture.”\nEveryone knows what a broken bone means in the current situation.\nGu Ning’s face was so pale, that the crowd was a little distraught.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai spoke comfortingly: “Don’t worry Gu Ning, we will carry you back no matter what.”\nAll the people consoled Gu Ning saying that they would definitely protect her safety.\nOn the contrary, they didn’t know that Gu Ning was worried about something else. The Five Stars Brigade selection was just three days away, how could she drag a wounded leg to defeat such a powerful Five Stars Brigade?\nDid it mean that all those efforts these few weeks were gone in vain?\nGu Ning’s expression was a little gloomy.\nBrother San said guiltily: “Gu Ning, it’s all my fault. I was the one who didn’t listen to you and insisted on coming here. If it wasn’t for you that stayed calm just now, it is difficult to say how many of us would be able to survive it. Now nothing has happened to us, but instead, you’ve been injured.” They all knew how important it meant for Gu Ning, who had no special ability, to be able to move freely.\nGu Ning forced a smile: “It’s just a fracture, it’s not like it’s completely broken. Just wait until we get back to the colony and have Dr. Gao fix it for me.”\nAnyone could see that Gu Ning’s smile was so reluctant and her sweat-soaked blonde hair plastered to her head and her pale face, it made the rest feel so bad about it.\nAt this time Hong Jie interrupted: “Let’s get the bones straightened first so that the bones don’t get misaligned and worsen the injury.”\nBrother San looked at Hong Jie in surprise and asked: “Hong Jie, since when do you know how to connect the bones?”\n“There’s a lot more that you don’t know.” Hong Jie replied as she directed them to cut the stool and then tore the gauze and got ready. Hong Jie squatted in front of Gu Ning and said: “Gu Ning, just shout it out if it hurts.” Gu Ning nodded, so Hong Jie carefully lifted her leg slowly and said after a few touches and presses: “Luckily it was only a fracture if not——“ She suddenly applied a strong force on Gu Ning’s knee while speaking halfway through her sentence. They heard a teeth-gritting grating sound of bones rubbing together, Gu Ning let out a muffled grunt and grabbed Cheng Ming’s hand hard next to her.\n“It’s connected. I’ll secure it for you now.” Hong Jie continued as she skilfully tied the two stool legs to the fracture area while asking: “It’s been many years since I’ve last practised it, so I’m a bit rusty. It hurts a lot, doesn’t it?”\nGu Ning’s head was covered in sweat and she barely managed to pull out a smile: “It’s alright.”\nYet anyone could see that she wasn’t doing very well right now.\nFor a while, the atmosphere in the room became a little depressing.\nThe basement was already small, and with twenty or so people crammed into it, it became even more cramped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San used his psychic power to make an extra earth bed, then spread a blanket and placed Gu Ning on it.\nAfterward, those who had special abilities were all hurriedly seizing the time to recover, while those who didn’t have special abilities were wiping their guns and knives. Hong Jie rummaged through the drawer and found a small half candle. After lighting it up, Zhang XiaoBai stopped acting as a human lightbulb anymore.\nGu Ning closed her eyes tiredly, she wasn’t able to accept the fact that she couldn’t participate in the Five Stars Brigade selection and looked a little dejected. The others exchanged glances with each other, trying to think of something they could say to comfort Gu Ning, but none of them knew what to say at this point to make her feel better.\nJia DaoZhang was sitting on the ground, leaning against the wall with his eyes closed to recover his powers. As if he sensed something, Jia DaoZhang opened his eyes and glanced casually towards the earth bed, then closed his eyes again. Then, feeling as if something was odd, he snapped his eyes open and looked over. Out of extreme surprise, his voice changed tone: “Where is she?!”\nJia DaoZhang’s surprised voice rang out in the basement and startled everyone at once.\nThey all glanced towards the earth bed in unison and then all of them stood up in shock. Staring at the empty earth bed in shock and dumbfoundedness.\nGu Ning, who had just been lying on the bed, had disappeared into the thin air!\nBang —— A sound rang out, and there was a huge splash on the otherwise calm sea, and something heavy fell from the sky into this green sea.\nGu Ning’s whole body plunged into the water and then kept sinking.\nA second ago, Gu Ning was lying on the earth bed being depressed, and the next second she fell into the water.\nFrightened, Gu Ning struggled subconsciously, paddling her hands until her head surfaced from the sea and wiped away the dripping water off her face. Looking at the familiar landscape on the shore, Gu Ning’s mind was still a bit puzzled.\nWhy had she suddenly come back to the space?\nThis was the first time this passive return to the space happened. The last time was when she lost consciousness after being bitten by a zombie and was sent to this space.\nA little confused about the current situation, Gu Ning decided to go ashore first, so she paddled her hands and feet and swam towards the shore.\nGu Ning stood on the shore looking inexplicably at the green sea in front of her, thinking that since she had just disappeared into the thin air, then the people in the post-apocalyptic world must be going crazy looking for her?!\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Wooots… They are now in hiding. Alright, this week chapters are trying to prep up for another fighting scene next week. A thrilling ride for this December =) Hahahaha so exciting! Thank you for reading and hopefully I could rush out all those chapters on time hehe. <3 )\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "64": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-64/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning stood on the shore for a while before she remembered what was wrong, her originally fractured leg didn’t seem to hurt anymore? Gu Ning tentatively moved her leg and it seemed fine. She removed the two-leg stools attached to keep it in place and then tried doing some kicks. Her leg didn’t feel any pain or rawness at all. Did this mean that she’s completely healed?\nGu Ning was a little confused.\n\n\n\nIn the post-apocalyptic world, the people inside the room were all staring wide-eyed at the empty earth bed, each conjuring up a myriad of strange reasons in their mind.\nHong Jie even made a point of checking the toilet as well as the bedroom yet she couldn’t find Gu Ning.\nZhang XiaoBai also used his hand to feel around on the earth bed for a while before he asked in a daze: “How come a person could just disappear without a trace?”\nZhong Xu replied: “…… She really just evaporated into thin air.”\n“Cheng Ming……” Jia DaoZhang suddenly called out to Cheng Ming, his expression looking strange: “Do you remember the last time something similar to this happened to Gu Ning too?”\nCheng Ming’s head was spinning and when he heard Jia DaoZhang questioning, it took him a while to recall the incident: “You mean that time in the car park?”\n“What car park? What happened?” Zhang XiaoBai asked eagerly.\nUnder the dancing candlelight, Jia DaoZhang’s expression looked inexplicably eerie: “That was the first time I’ve met Gu Ning, Cheng was there too. We spent the night resting in an enclosed car park. She slept against the wall, and when we got up in the morning, she was gone. The situation was too chaotic for us to think too much about it and Gu Ning’s explanation afterward made sense. Yet now when we recalled back, could it be that Gu Ning just vanished into the thin air then, just like what happened to her now.”\nCheng Ming was shaken.\nThe others were inexplicably a little creeped out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNo one saw how Gu Ning disappeared. The room was just this small that if anyone made any movement could easily alert others, but Gu Ning’s disappearance was so quiet as if she had just evaporated without making a single sound.\nLuo Long suddenly shivered and rubbed his arms: “Come on, don’t say it anymore, I’m getting goosebumps.”\nOnly Hong Jie caught on to the point and asked: “So how did Gu Ning return last time?”\nJia DaoZhang replied: “The next day when we were outside and being chased by a horde of zombies. Gu Ning suddenly appeared out of nowhere again.”\nLuo Long suddenly commented: “And don’t you guys think Gu Ning sometimes also comes and goes like a shadow?”\nJia DaoZhang nodded remembering Gu Ning’s numerous solitary actions.\nHong Jie on the other hand, remembered yesterday night when Gu Ning went out alone and only showed up again the next morning.\nLuo Long’s words seemed to sort out everyone’s memories of Gu Ning at once and then realized that the image of Gu Ning they knew seemed to be permeated with such mystery. Even though Gu Ning seems to be close to them recently, she seldom chats and communicates with them other than the necessary conversation. Although they treated Gu Ning as their comrade in arms, her attitude towards them was kind of aloofness, always with a sense of detachment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San had never been able to see through Gu Ning’s character, but it seems that it was because of this impenetrable mystery that he had an inexplicable self-belief in Gu Ning, feeling that she always had some means of assurance.\nHowever, this time Brother San was genuinely shocked. It was beyond human comprehension to say that a living person had just vanished.\nThe room of people discussed for a long while but none could figure out where Gu Ning had gone.\nAll of them stared at each other with wide eyes and were speechless.\nZhang XiaoBai asked: “Brother San, what should we do next?”\nBrother San replied: “What should we do? What else can we do? We can only wait. Didn’t Lao Jia say that Gu Ning disappeared and reappeared on her own last time? Let’s also wait and see when she appears.”\nJia DaoZhang felt awkward and slightly unhappy with Brother San addressing him as Lao Jia but now was not the time to dwell on it.\nOn the contrary, they were not worried about Gu Ning’s safety and even had more confidence in her than they did in themselves.\nThus, all that was left to do was wait.\nThey discussed the battle they had fought earlier, reflecting on their shortcomings in that battle and their lack of control over their powers. The practical battle experience was the best way to increase their combat power and every battle increases their chances of surviving in the future. What’s more, they had just developed their powers to fight mutated zombies that exceeded their strength by several levels, and the experiences they gained from it were enormous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter there was nothing more to say, it was a dull wait.\nThey waited till noon, and even Xiang Xu already woke up and was silent after learning that Gu Ning had disappeared. She didn’t know what was the reason for the disappearance as the fragments about the future didn’t show her this information. Yet she strongly believed that Gu Ning would reappear once again.\nAlthough Xiang Xu was young, she had shown maturity far beyond her age, and Gu Ning trusted her, coupled with the great strength she had shown previously, her words had a calming effect upon others.\nIn the beginning, they were vaguely anticipating and curious, waiting to see in what way Gu Ning would appear, but as they waited for so long, they became a little bit uneasy.\nZhang XiaoBai was the first to ask: “It’s already afternoon. Why hasn’t Gu Ning shown up yet?”\n“Do we have to wait for her?” Hong Jie asked too: “It’s almost one o’clock and we have three hours left before it gets dark. There won’t be much time left for today if we don’t go searching for supplies now.”\nLuo Long replied: “Then what should we do? Gu Ning hasn’t returned yet, and we can’t just leave her behind right? What if she suddenly appears?”\nHong Jie pondered for a moment then replied: “I’ll stay behind, your psychic power won’t be much help either so you will stay with me too. Also, give me five more men to wait here for Gu Ning. Xiao Xie, you take the rest and search for supplies, and don’t forget to help us barricade the door above after your way out. We’ll go back on our own when you’re still not back by two o’clock tomorrow afternoon.” Hong Jie was planning for the worst-case scenario.\nHowever, there was no doubt that this was the best plan right now.\nNo one had any objections.\nLuo Long had a problem with Hong Jie stating that his psychic power wasn’t much help but he didn’t dare rebut.\nAll the special abilities users had replenished their psychic energy to their peak state and after the morning’s battle, they all had a good idea of their powers and gained some combat experience. In the afternoon, as long as they didn’t encounter that few mutated zombies that were too strong for them, they should be able to handle most of the situation easily in general.\nZhang XiaoBai said: “Our luck can’t be this bad, right? To encounter those mutated zombies once again in the afternoon.”\nBrother San slapped Zhang XiaoBai on his mouth: “Can you say something more auspicious with this stupid mouth?”\nZhang XiaoBai hurriedly changed his tone: “Then let’s wish us all to return fully loaded this afternoon.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San said with satisfaction: “Now that’s better.”\nAfter leaving Hong Jie and the others with plenty of ammunition and supplies to last until tomorrow night, Brother San left with his team.\nThe house, which had been cramped, became empty all of a sudden.\nThe few soldiers who remained behind were a bit at a loss on what to do.\nHong Jie left a direct message for them to wake her up when Gu Ning returned and then went to sleep in the next bedroom.\nTo this elder sister, who Brother San had to even speak respectfully to, Luo Long didn’t dare displease her. From time to time, he would glance over at the earth bed, continuously having the feeling that Gu Ning would appear again, quietly lying on the bed.\nMeanwhile, Gu Ning was standing on the waves, the green waves tumbling beneath her feet and she stood firmly on it. Her body followed the flow of the tumbling waves, rising and sinking while travelling forward at a fast pace. She spread her hands and raised them upwards, and two swirling waterspouts broke from the sea with a loud splash and rushed towards the sky.\nEleventh Square was less than 500 metres from Golden Gate Street which was all about shopping and selling all kinds of branded clothes and cosmetics, while Eleventh Square was surrounded by huge shopping malls and had a multitude of shops. Previously, Brother San and the others were in a hurry to escape from there so they didn’t have the chance to scavenge for supplies and today they came specifically for it.\nThere were a lot of dried corpses lying on the ground from all ages and genders. Although Brother San and the rest had seen too much of the post-apocalyptic tragedy, they couldn’t help but feel immense sadness when they saw these.\nAfter killing the mutated zombie, those recently evolved zombies were no longer able to deal any serious damage to the team of six special abilities users. Brother San hadn’t forgotten Gu Ning’s instruction and followed the plan from the beginning. When the small wave of zombies came, the ordinary people would be in charge of the main attack and stay on the outer edge while the special abilities users would be in charge of the supporting attack. Yet, when they encounter a larger wave of zombies, they immediately change their formation and protect the ordinary people in the centre.\nXiang Xu was still in charge of detection. The reason why Xiang Xu did not detect the mutated zombie was that it was too strong and automatically blocked the detection of her spiritual power. Yet, those recently evolved zombies could be fully monitored by Xiang Xu.\nIn such battles, they all had adapted to their psychic powers while also forming bonds with their teammates while working together. They were all surprised to find that working together produced very good results.\nZhong Xu’s water ability combined with Zhang XiaoBai’s thunder ability was often able to inflict a large area of damage.\nMoreover, Jia DaoZhang’s ice ability built on top of Zhong Xu’s water ability also created many ice sculptures but it required too much effort to dig out the crystal core so Jia DaoZhang improvised it by only freezing the zombies below the neck to make it easier to dig it out.\nAlso, in regards to single combat, it was Cheng Ming who attracted the most attention.\nApart from Zhang XiaoBai and Jia DaoZhang, his psychic energy was the strongest. Those zombies weren’t able to get within a meter near Cheng Ming as there was always wind gusting around him. From time to time, a wind blade would take shape and slash off half of the zombie’s face without a sound. Moreover, this level of psychic energy consumption was not too draining for him which allowed him to basically balance it out with the regeneration speed. He was also very conscious of the power he had to manipulate and his wind blades were mostly aimed at the farthest zombies.\nAs compared to Zhang XiaoBai, Cheng Ming, and Jia DaoZhang, who had mutated psychic powers, Brother San and Zhong Xu’s psychic energy was very average. If converted to creating earth walls, 20 earth walls in a row may be the maximum for Brother San. If converted to earth spikes, that would only be a few hundred of it. Zhong Xu was even busier, going around supporting them with rain so that Zhang XiaoBai could release his thunder ability and Jia DaoZhang would release his ice ability. Therefore, compared to the three of them who could easily abuse the zombies, Brother San and Zhong Xu had to suffer more and control their psychic energy very carefully.\nIn their heart, they hated themselves for missing the good opportunity, if only they could have developed their psychic powers together with Gu Ning.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Alright~ Now it’s all prep up so let’s see how it goes~ Also, thank you Pang V. for your kind support! We will schedule dedicated chapters for you soon. So stay tuned everyone. =) )\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "65": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-65/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThey used the rotation tactic, while some attacked, the others grabbed the time to recover their powers and tried to maintain their peak condition. The psychological shadow of the mutated zombie still lingered upon them and they had to be prepared to deal with any mutated zombies that might pop out of nowhere. Not to mention the fact that the two mutated zombies had not been killed so they could emerge from some obscure alleyway at any time.\nThe nightmarish rustling sound was something they feared and would never want to hear again in their lifetime.\n\n\n\nAs Zhang XiaoBai released the lightning strike, he took the time to comment: “I always feel a little unsettled without Gu Ning.”\nJia DaoZhang nodded his head to show that he felt the same way too. Ever since he had guessed that Gu Ning was the one who answered to his divination, he had developed a great sense of trust in Gu Ning. No matter how dangerous the situation was, as soon as he turned his head and saw Gu Ning there, he would have a boost in confidence in his heart. Now that Gu Ning was suddenly gone, although they seem quite strong, they felt insecure in their minds.\nThe others also felt more or less the same way, they didn’t feel it when Gu Ning was around but now that she’s no longer here with them, they always feel a little uncertain of themselves. Also, they all knew very well that the fact that there were no casualties in such a thrilling battle in the morning was greatly due to Gu Ning’s several decisive commands. Including later on when she took the risk to deal a heavy blow to the mutated zombie, which directly turned the whole situation around.\nIf previously they had only regarded Gu Ning as a companion, a friend, then now they had developed a feeling of admiration and worship for her, while vaguely treating her as their spiritual leader.\nWithout any incident, the team rushed to the nearest chain of supermarkets in the Eleventh Square. All the zombies around the area had been cleared out relatively well, and with Xiang Xu as their mobile radar, they managed to get into the supermarket at ease.\nThe door of the supermarket was wide open and there were signs of a raid inside, the cash register drawer had been forced open and only some change and coins were left. These should be the work of those who thought the disaster would pass quickly at the start of the apocalypse. The items on the shelves were all messed up but there were still a lot of supplies left behind, mostly food and drink. Zhang XiaoBai was the first to rush to the fridge and opened the door to grab a bottle of Coke. He opened it and took a few big gulps and then let out a sigh of satisfaction. The familiar scent rushed to his nostrils and Zhang XiaoBai was practically moved to tears as he hugged the bottle of Coke.\nBrother San glanced over and commented: “Don’t take any of the water items, we now have Zhong Xu which was equivalent to the drinkable water supply. Try to bring as much food as possible, that is what can save your life.” Then calmly swept all the cigarettes on the cigarette rack behind the cashier into the backpack before being accused by Zhang XiaoBai: “So, why are you wasting the space in your backpack with so many cigarettes, Brother San?!”\nWith a glare, Brother San replied with a straight face: “Don’t you know I’ll die without my cigarette?!”\nZhang XiaoBai was speechless.\nZhong Xu asked anxiously as he swept all the food from the shelves into his large bag: “Brother San, this won’t work, there’s so much stuff here, how much can we fit in such a few bags! We came here with so much difficulty and only brought back such a small amount of stuff after all the effort, it’s not worth it right?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhong Xu’s words drew acknowledgement from everyone.\nBrother San lit his cigarette at some point and then questioned: “What could we do? We didn’t drive our truck over.”\nAt this time, Jia DaoZhang interjected: “XiaoBai, why don’t you come out with me to find a car.”\nZhang XiaoBai was stunned: “Huh?”\nJia DaoZhang coughed dryly and replied: “When I was young, I learned this skill, let’s go, let’s go together. What if I run into a horde of zombies by myself?”\nWith that, he dragged Zhang XiaoBai out with him.\nBrother San eyed Jia DaoZhang suspiciously then said to the crowd in the supermarket: “What are you all looking at, hurry up and go finish the raid and we will go to the next one.”\nWhen they walked out of the supermarket, Jia DaoZhang had also gotten the car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThey were all stunned when they saw the large cargo truck parked in front of the supermarket.\nZhong Xu exclaimed: “DaoZhang, you’re so awesome!”\nBrother San also chimed in with the praises: “I can’t believe it, Lao Jia, you really have some skills!”\n“Heh heh! Just a shoddy skill.” While Jia DaoZhang said this, his expression was smug, obviously very pleased with the crowds’ impressed look.\nBrother San laughed heartily and then they all loaded all their bags into the rear compartment. This was a very large cargo truck and had a big capacity that could fit several more mini-markets like this one. Zhang XiaoBai was the happiest one, loading all the coke onto the truck and very thoughtfully loading all the yoghurt for Xiang Xu.\nAfter getting into the passenger seat, Brother San said to Jia DaoZhang: “Lao Jia, about two hundred metres further down, there’s a Haining department store with a huge supermarket on the ground floor! It’s got everything, so let’s go there and bring it back all at once, then head back.”\nWhile starting the truck, Jia DaoZhang said discontentedly: “Lao San, didn’t we agree not to call me Lao Jia anymore? You’re making everyone follow you with this name-calling.”\nBrother San replied after taking in a fierce puff of his cigarette: “Come on, we don’t even know if you are a real Daoist master or not. Let’s go then!”\nJia DaoZhang couldn’t do anything about this Brother San. If it were anyone else, he would have frozen that person into an ice sculpture by now.\nThe truck drove for a short distance and sure enough, just as Brother San had said, there was a big Haining department store up ahead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter clearing the surrounding zombies.\nBrother San left Zhong Xu and Zhang XiaoBai in charge of keeping watch while the others rushed in like hungry wolves while dragging the large bags.\nThe ground floor was a supermarket. Xiang Xu first used her spiritual power to check it out, and after locating all the places with zombies were cleared out, they began a frantic sweeping raid.\nWhile constantly sweeping various kinds of biscuits and bread from the shelves into the large bag, Jia DaoZhang shouted excitedly: “Crap crap crap! We’re gonna get rich!”\nThe others had smiles on their faces like farmers after having a good harvest.\nCheng Ming’s smile was widening till it almost reached his ears: “This time we’ll have enough supplies to feed us for a year!”\nZhang Yang smiled nervously as he quickly put all kinds of biscuits into his bag: “I used to dream about what we’re doing now! I never thought it would come true today!”\nAll the soldiers let out happy laughter.\nA soldier took the time to shout out: “Hey? Where’s Brother San?”\nJia DaoZhang replied: “Where could he be? Must be looking for cigarettes again.”\nJust as Jia DaoZhang said, Brother San had just reached the counter that sold cigarettes.\nHe was frantically sweeping and shouting like a madman: “I have enough cigarettes to smoke for a year! I don’t have to smoke a cigarette for three days anymore! F*ck! I’ve never even smoked this cigarette before, it’s f*cking expensive! Hahahahahahaha now it’s all mine!” A few soldiers who were around his area glanced at the manic Brother San and shook their heads before silently walking away.\nThe meats in the freezer were all completely spoiled and the area was emitting the slinkiness from the rotten meat. However, it was completely normal for them now, and Jia DaoZhang who stared at the rotten meat in the freezer and said with great regret: “It’s a pity, such a pity.”\nBrother San hauled his big bag of cigarettes, gathered everyone, and said: “Let’s move all this stuff out first, and then we’ll go to the upper floors later to look at the clothes and quilts items.”\nThus, the group of them dragged all their bulging bags and prepared to send these things out first and then return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nA few people were still a few steps away from the door when a humanoid object flew in through the gate —— It fell to the ground with a loud thud and slid on the smooth tiles for a while before hitting Cheng Ming’s foot directly.\nThe man covered his chest and doubled over in pain.\nCheng Ming’s shocked voice rang out: “Zhong Xu?!”\nThe one who flew in through the doorway and fell to the ground was Zhong Xu who was keeping watch outside!\n“What’s going on?” Cheng Ming and the others asked in shock after helping Zhong Xu up from the ground.\nBefore Zhong Xu could answer, another man flew in through the door and slammed on the other side, it was Zhang XiaoBai who had also been staying guard outside! There was a bloody hole in his stomach and was bleeding! Zhang XiaoBai was a mutated thunder ability and had a huge pool of psychic energy, how could he be injured like this?\nZhang XiaoBai seems slightly better than Zhong Xu, although he was seriously injured, he still managed to get up from the ground on his own. His face was very pale as he covered the bloody hole in his abdomen while staring at the gate and answered: “It’s special abilities users——“\nZhang XiaoBai was a mutated thunder ability user and had a huge pool of psychic energy. What kind of special ability user could injure him like this?!\nBefore Zhang XiaoBai could finish his sentence, a team of seven people walked in through the door.\nA tall man in the front of the group said with a smile after sweeping his gaze over them: “Excuse me, but this place and that truck outside, is ours now.”\nThe skinny man next to him reminded him “Also the crystal cores.”\nThe man drifted off for a moment, then continued with a smile: “Right, and all the crystal cores you have on you too, hand them over by the way.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ahhhh XiaoBai, Zhong Xu!!! Hehehe first major special abilities users battle coming up! Also Merry Christmas Eve Everyone!! <3 )\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "66": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-66/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe smile of joy that Brother San was wearing just now after a good harvest had disappeared without a trace.\nA few soldiers who had no special abilities helped Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu to rest at the inner counter.\n\n\n\nFrom the tone of the other party, it wasn’t just the supplies and the big truck of items that they wanted, but also the crystal cores that they were carrying.\nA young woman walked up to the tall man and whispered something in his ear.\nThe tall man glanced at them with some surprises and said: “There are actually so many special abilities users? But all are just low levelled. Now, decide for yourselves whether you will hand over the crystal cores yourselves or have us search for it after we’ve killed you.”\nThe young woman suddenly pointed at Xiang Xu and commented: “And this little girl, we’ll take her too. It’s the first time I’ve come across such a young spiritual ability user.”\nXiang Xu’s gaze fixed at the young woman with some displeasure, and Xiang Yi even tightened his eyebrows.\nThe expression on Brother San and the others was getting grimmer, and Xiang Xu reported to Brother San: “Seven of them are all special abilities users, and their psychic energy fluctuations are all very powerful……”\nBrother San froze, then his expression darken, seven special abilities users? No wonder Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu had been messed up so badly.\nBrother San weighed his options and then replied: “The stuff here and the truck outside, we can give it to you as well as the crystal cores we have on us. But not the people.” Otherwise, when Gu Ning returned, how would he explain to her?\nThe young woman shook her head and insisted: “No. We must have this girl.”\n“Then there’s nothing we can do.” Brother San sighed, then violently mobilized his psychic power, and more than ten earth spikes instantly shot towards the group of people! At the same time, he also sent the signal to the others to activate their psychic powers to attack!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAlthough Brother San was the first to launch the attack, Cheng Ming’s wind blade was known for its speed and reached the battlefield faster than Brother San’s earth spike!\nThe seven men on the other group were perhaps very confident in their strength, not expecting that Brother San and the others would dare to take the lead. When the earth wall rose, it only blocked off Brother San’s earth spikes, while Cheng Ming’s wind blade had already traversed behind the wall! A concentrated attack directly towards the man-in-charge of the group! The man didn’t retreat a single step and the moment the wind blade reached him, a barrier made from a curtain of water appeared in front of him that completely shields his body behind it. However, the sharpness of the wind blade was obviously a little unexpected and the man’s expression changed slightly before conjuring the second curtain of water again. The wind blade was no longer as strong as before after slicing through the first water curtain and stopped halfway through the second water curtain.\nThe water curtain was sliced open and then restored, and none of the ten or so wind blades managed to break through the second water curtain!\nJust as the man’s guard was lowered, a wind blade silently slashed through——\n“Watch out!” The young woman shouted, while the mental barrier instantly opened up!\nThe wind blade stopped an inch in front of the man’s throat before it could no longer advance any further, then silently dissipated into the air.\nThe earth wall collapsed at that moment.\nCheng Ming’s heart sank slightly when he saw that the dozen or so wind blades he had sent out had not caused the slightest damage to his opponent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe man’s face changed slightly as he stared at Cheng Ming and asked: “Mutated wind ability and outstanding manipulation power. If you are willing, I will allow you to join us——“\nHe was answered by dozens of wind blades that swept towards him! The sound of breaking air was loud and clear!\nThe man’s face remained unchanged as the huge water curtain reappeared!\nThe moment the water curtain appeared, Cheng Ming’s eyes lit up and he shouted coldly: “DaoZhang!”\nIn response, Jia DaoZhang pushed his hands forward against the huge water curtain and instantly a tremendous wave of cold air swept along his palms! Jia DaoZhang had been planning for a long time, and naturally, he wasn’t stingy with his psychic powers. As soon as the cold air touched the water curtain, it condensed at a visible speed! Before the man could react, he was shocked to find that the water curtain was out of his control! The curtain of water that had been floating in mid-air turned into a huge block of ice and “Bang!” A loud clash! It smashed into the ground and there was a splash of ice!\n“Mutated ice ability! How can there be so many mutated abilities users?!” The man jolted back a few steps and exclaimed as he stared at the wall of ice that the water curtain had turned into.\n“Found the back door!” Xiang Xu’s eyes snapped open as she had been using her spiritual power to find another exit and in just a few exchanges, she had located the back door.\n“Good!” Brother San shouted then pushed his hands forward! At once a wall of earth rose from the ground! There was a bang! The earth wall crashed into the ice, which was already slippery and when it was hit by the wall, it moved toward the front!\nThe group of seven behind that wall of ice were startled and retreated in a hurry!\nThis retreat led them directly outside the main door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSeeing the chance, Brother San conjured the earth wall like it didn’t cost any of his psychic energy and directly blocked the entrance! After stuffing a transparent crystal core into his mouth, Brother San yelled as he ran: “Go! Let’s get out the back door!”\n“Brother San! I’m still here——“ Zhang XiaoBai’s weak voice came from one of the counters.\nOnly then did they remember that there were still two wounded, and they hurriedly picked up Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu before dashing toward the exit with Xiang Xu pointing the way.\nBrother San and the rest were eager to escape.\nThe seven men team was blocked outside the door and their expressions were very gloomy. This was the first time since their team had experienced such a defeat, and they had even seriously injured two of the other team’s special abilities users. It was something that hadn’t happened since their team had been formed.\nIt also made them feel that they had received a great insult.\nThe man glanced at the ground of broken ice, his gaze was cold and he said in a cold voice: “We must get rid of every single one of these people. The feud has been made, and those few mutated abilities users will cause problems in the future if we don’t get rid of them now.” He looked at the young woman and continued: “Jiang Xue, use your mental power to find them.”\nJiang Xue nodded, then her mental power surged out frantically and penetrated the earth wall and chased after them ——\nXiang Yi ran with Xiang Xu on his back, her spiritual power detected that mental power was tracking them down and she shouted anxiously: “We’re locked on!”\nBrother San yelled as he ran: “Is there any way to get rid of it?”\nXiang Xu replied: “I’ll try.”\nShe pursed her lips and her spiritual power surged out quickly, her spiritual energy was very much overdrawn in the morning and it was much slower to recover as compared to other psychic abilities. Thus, even now, her spiritual power was not at its peak but only recovered around sixty percent. Yet, she still didn’t hold back. Her psychic energy fluctuated strongly in her lake, and her spiritual power condensed into a huge invisible net and spread towards the mental power that was tracking them. At the same time, her face instantly paled a few more shades. She closed her eyes and weakly leaned on Xiang Yi’s shoulder, while Xiang Yi pursed his lips and ran even faster.\nThe net that Xiang Xu had formed with her spiritual energy was spread in a kind of blocking posture that the tracking mental power had rushed straight into it. The mental power was trapped in the net and prevented it from crossing. It kept rushing in and banging on the great net formed by Xiang Xu’s spiritual energy but it could never break through the net.\nJiang Xue, who was running in that direction was a little shocked: “Such great spiritual power at such a young age?!” If she knew that this was only sixty percent of Xiang Xu’s actual spiritual power, she would be shocked till speechless.\nThe skinny man asked: “So is it still possible to catch up?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJiang Xue frowned and feared that if she let them escape now, it would be tough the next time they met. Thus, she stopped holding back and once again surged out her mental power frantically towards the chasing direction.\nAfter all, Xiang Xu was not at her peak so even though the net was powerful, it could not withstand the full force of Jiang Xue’s blow.\nInstantly as the large net formed by spiritual energy was broken through a large hole, Xiang Xu, who was lying on Xiang Yi, sensed everything and opened her eyes. She shook her head and sadly reported to Brother San who was beside her: “I can’t stop her.” She knew that if they were caught up at this point, there would be a high chance that they would be killed. Even if she didn’t die, the rest might. Although they had only lived together for two days, this was the first time she had felt the warmth of family other than Xiang Yi after the apocalypse happened. Yet, was this warmth going to disappear so soon?\nBrother San looked at Xiang Xu, who had always been strong and mature like a young adult. It was the first time he saw her with such a sad expression and his heart was unusually hard to bear.\nHe slowly stopped in his tracks.\nThen Cheng Ming followed.\nJia DaoZhang hesitated for a moment, and then also gritted his teeth and stopped.\nThe others ran about ten metres away before they noticed that the three of them had stopped. All of them looked back at them in bewilderment, wondering why they had suddenly stopped.\nThey were puzzled for only a very brief moment before it suddenly dawned on them the reason and their expression suddenly changed.\nZhang XiaoBai stared at Brother San, Cheng Ming, and Jia DaoZhang with disbelief: “What are you all trying to do?!”\nXiang Yi pursed his lips as he watched them, a sad look uncontrollably appeared on his face. Xiang Xu slumped on Xiang Yi’s back, tears welling up in her eyes, her voice tinged with sobs: “I’ll go with them.”\nJia DaoZhang stopped her: “Don’t be silly… You think that by handing you over to them. Will they be stupid enough to let us go?”\nCheng Ming continued: “You guys, stop wasting the time. Quickly go before they reach us.”\nBrother San swept a glance over his soldiers and said: “Even if I die today, I hope you won’t forget that you all were once a soldier of the Third Company. Even if you are the last one standing, don’t ever dirty the flag of the Third Company!”\nBrother San suddenly called out: “Zhang Yang!”\nZhang Yang subconsciously saluted at attention: “Yes Sir!”\nBrother San stared at Zhang Yang and commanded: “I order you! Take them and evacuate now! Make sure to reach the basement safely to meet up with Hong Jie!”\nZhang Yang looked at Brother San with widened eyes but pursed his lips tightly and didn’t reply.\nBrother San bellowed: “Zhang Yang! What is the vocation of a soldier?!”\nZhang Yang’s eyes were red and his voice trembled slightly but still firmly said “Report! Resolutely obey orders!”\nBrother San smiled gratefully: “Good, go!”\nCheng Ming suddenly took a few steps forward and said to Zhang XiaoBai: “Zhang XiaoBai, if Gu Ning comes back, do tell her that I didn’t waste the crystal core which she gave me.” Having said that, he revealed a smile as Zhang XiaoBai watched with red eyes. Then resolutely turning around, he followed Brother San and Jia DaoZhang in front of him.\nThe soldiers eyed the three figures. Apart from Brother San, neither Cheng Ming nor Jia DaoZhang was considered tall, but at that moment, in their teary gaze, their back view was as high as three big mountains.\nZhang Yang gritted his teeth and shouted: “Let’s go!”\nThen he was the first to turn and ran in the direction of the Eleventh Square.\nBrother San took out a cigarette case from his pocket and placed one in his mouth while handing one to Jia DaoZhang then to Cheng Ming, who waved his hand: “I don’t smoke.”\nJia DaoZhang subconsciously tried to lift his robe as he squatted down and only after he had done so, did he remember that his robe had been burned. Thus, he just squatted down and took a deep puff on his cigarette, and said in retrospect: “I haven’t smoked since I gave up smoking over twenty years ago.”\nBrother San took a deep puff then smiled and said: “Lao Jia, you’ve got some guts.”\nJia DaoZhang replied honestly: “Just that my face isn’t thick enough, or I would have run after them.” And quite a bit of regret.\nCheng Ming opened his mouth to speak but his gaze suddenly saw into the distance with a gloomy expression: “Here they come.”\nBrother San and Jia DaoZhang took one last deep puff, moved very neatly to throw their cigarettes into a puddle on the ground, and then stood up.\nCheng Ming gaze fixed at the group of special abilities users that were heading toward their direction and asked: “Brother San, do you think we’ll die today?”\nBrother San asked Jia DaoZhang instead: “Lao Jia, what do you think?”\nJia DaoZhang stared at the seven special abilities users that were aggressively rushing towards them. Somehow he thought that he would be scared, but he was now inexplicably very calm and even managed to smile: “I don’t think so.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ahhhhh the three of them!!!

    "67": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-67/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe group of seven rushed over, and when they realised that there were actually only Brother San and the two others remained, they were somewhat startled.  When they noticed that they didn’t seem to be escaping, they all slowed down.\nJiang Xue’s mental power continued chasing all the way past them, then reported to the tall man: “Wang Bo, those people have escaped.”\n\n\n\nWang Bo replied: “You take Liang Long, Sun Guang, and go after them. Don’t leave anyone else except the ones you want.”\nAs soon as Jiang Xue nodded, she led the two men in the group to prepare to chase after Xiang Xu and the rest.\nSuddenly, Brother San stepped forward, and a metre away from his feet. A row of half-metre high earth spikes broke out abruptly! All the way toward Jiang Xue!\nJiang Xue and the three of them retreated sharply about three or four metres before they stood up in a wretched manner.\nBrother San laughed: “Are you guys blind? Can’t you see that we are here?”\nJiang Xue replied: “Do you think the three of you can stop us?”\n“It’s good to even delay you for a while.” Jia DaoZhang interjected: “You probably don’t know this, but we have a very powerful captain and we were all sent out by her to find supplies. She’ll be coming this way later, and you guys look like you’re pretty powerful. Yet, you’re not even enough to be an appetizer for her.”\nThe skinny man sneered: “You think saying these words will make us let you guys off the hook? We are the first ones to discover that crystal cores could help us evolve. Also, even if that captain of yours is powerful, there is no way she could beat the seven of us by herself.” His gaze was grim: “And when we killed everyone, how will she know who did it?”\nWang Bo interjected: “There is no need to chat nonsense to them as they are just trying to stall for time. Li Qi, you go first and stop them. We’ll meet up with you once we’ve finished here.”\nAn inconspicuous man nodded and replied: “Okay.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThen with a swift, his body rushed toward Brother San and the others like an arrow!\nCheng Ming’s pupils shrank slightly: “A speed ability user!” His shock was only momentary, as his wind blades instantly manifested and shot toward the figure that flew through them! However, his wind blades were all stopped by Jiang Xue’s mental power who had been on guard for a long time.\nAt this time, Jia DaoZhang made his move. He just stomped his foot and a layer of ice shot out along the ground and it spread extremely fast! The speed ability user didn’t even notice the sudden ice under his feet, and the moment his feet hit the ice, he slipped and fell to the ground after losing his balance. He slipped for a good distance along the ice and before he could get up, a thick ice prick condensed out of the ice where he lay and went straight through his chest. The crystal-clear ice prick poked through his back and emerged out of his chest with drops of blood flowing to the tip of the ice. It slowly trickled down in a different kind of bloody aesthetic.\nBrother San pointed out: “See, we’ve told you that the three of us are still here and you wouldn’t be able to get through us.”\nThe expression of the remaining six changed slightly, none of them expected them to kill Li Qi so cleanly. Wang Bo’s gaze focused, no longer holding back his power. He spread open his hands and countless water arrows instantly condensed in front of his body while he stared at the three people opposite of him and stated: “Since you all have chosen to stay and die, then go to hell.” As the sentence ended, the dozens of water arrows in front of him abruptly scattered and then shot towards the trio who were ten metres away like a rainstorm!\nIn battle after battle, they had slowly begun to develop a tacit understanding in fights. Not only of their powers but also of their teammates’ fighting patterns.\nAs the dozens of water arrows came shooting over, Cheng Ming and Jia DaoZhang retreated at the same time, giving way to Brother San who waved his hands and a wall of earth broke out one after another!\nThe arrow shattered the first wall, the second wall, the third wall and finally stopped when it reached the last wall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San, Cheng Ming, and Jia DaoZhang hadn’t even had the time to catch their breath whereas countless green vines had already wrapped around the earth wall quickly. With a crush, the wall crumbled in the ever-tightening vines —— The countless vines directly snaked towards the trio!\nBrother San and Jia DaoZhang retreated in a hurry! Then the wind started to blow! Countless wind blades instantly manifested themselves and slashed towards the vines! Swoosh swoosh swoosh! All the vines were sliced off by the wind blades and fell from the air like snakes and insects with their bodies cut off. It writhed on the ground for a few moments before it stopped moving completely.\nNumerous balls of fire fell from the sky like meteors.\nJia DaoZhang swallowed a replenishing transparent crystal core with a soft gulp before quickly conjuring up a thick ice shield! Bang! Bang! Bang! Numerous fireballs fell and smashed the ice shield! One after another, all smashed on the ice shield and Jia DaoZhang once again unleashed his psychic energy. The layer upon the ice shield increased and resisted the fireballs attacks with great strength.\nBrother San launched several earth walls towards them before ducking underneath the ice shield and took the spare time to take in the transparent crystal core into his mouth. His reserves of psychic energy were the smallest and at this moment, Brother San was fighting with a death wish. He was thinking that it was better to consume the cores than to leave them for those people, so he ate it without any heartache at all.\nThey didn’t even want to fight those people head-on, there were only three of them and although they had taken out one of them, there were still six more. Not to mention the fact that a mental ability user was watching them all this while, yet they weren’t sure if that mental psychic power could attack like Xiang Xu’s spiritual power so they couldn’t take the risk. Fortunately, Xiang Xu had said before that it was not that easy for the spiritual power to penetrate the earth wall or ice shield that was formed by psychic powers.  Therefore, they were now using the earth wall to hold them off for the time being and then hiding in the ice shield to block away from the fireballs and mental attacks. Their main purpose now was not to fight them to death, but to stall more time for Xiang Xu, Zhang XiaoBai, and the others.\nThe fireballs pelted the ice shield like they were nothing, and the sound of ice shattering rang out from time to time, causing those two people underneath the ice shield to be frightened. Staring upwards, the fireballs smashed into the ice shield and exploded with a bang that seemed slightly like a firework. However, neither of the two men underneath the ice shield was in the mood for fireworks. Jia DaoZhang was anxious and added more layers to the ice shields, and Brother San continued to rush him to put up more layers as well as constantly replenishing the earth wall.\nCheng Ming’s wind blades basically never stopped, maintaining an average of hundreds of wind blades formed per second. The psychic energy depleted at a very high speed but luckily his energy reserves were very sufficient, so even with such an intense release of his energy, the consumption was only around twenty percent of his overall.\nAlthough those vines looked terrifying, none of them were able to break through the barrier formed by Cheng Ming and his wind blade.\nObviously, Cheng Ming and Jia DaoZhang’s ample amount of psychic energy had shocked them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere was also the fact that Brother San’s stance of eating the transparent crystal cores like snacks also made them feel so shocked.\nWang Bo’s face was gloomy as he commanded: “Don’t hold back any longer, let’s fight quickly!”\nThe other five felt the pressure and they released all their powers at once!\nAs the two earth ability users fired at the same time, the walls that Brother San had erected didn’t last and collapsed with a crash! Then countless earth spikes and fireballs flew towards the ice shield!\nBrother San and Jia DaoZhang hurriedly escaped from the ice shield. Just as they had stepped out of the ice shield when the blasting fireball with earth spikes smashed into it and shredded the ice shield.\nBrother San managed to conjure up an earth shield just in time to block away from the splattered debris, and the two men had no time to celebrate their quick reaction before they were knocked off their feet by the massive impact!\nBrother San and Jia DaoZhang were knocked off their feet by the huge force and then smashed onto the ground heavily. Jia DaoZhang didn’t know where he had injured himself and spat out blood on the spot. He was so injured that he couldn’t even get up from the ground. Brother San had experience in resisting blows and changed his posture to cushion away from the force when he landed, so he was in a much better state than Jia DaoZhang. When he saw Jia DaoZhang vomiting blood, his heart tightened and before he could check on his injuries, a vine was wrapped around his ankle. As soon as he turned around, a force travelled from the vine and dragged him backward by the leg. Then the world spun in front of Brother San’s eyes and he was hung upside down by his ankles!\nInstantly all the blood rushed to the top of his head, a dizzy spell, and an unpleasant urge to vomit.\nJia DaoZhang was also dangled upside down from the vine that caught his legs. He was already badly injured, and now he coughed violently. Blood dripped down the corners of his mouth and onto his forehead as he coughed, looking very miserable and bloody. He opened one eye with difficulty to peek at Brother San and muttered in pain: “Lao San, I… I can’t make it……” This was followed by another violent coughing fit, his face was red from the congestion and was contorted with an expression that seemed extremely painful.\nWang Bo said with a sideways glance: “Jiang Xue, you and Liang Long, Sun Guang, go after those few missing fish first. I’ll settle here and join you all later.”\nWith a nod, Jiang Xue then ran with the skinny man as well as the fire ability user towards her the path her mental power directed.\nNo one could stop them this time.\nCheng Ming tried to part a few wind blades to stop them, yet abruptly! It was as if countless fine needles had been violently inserted into his brain, and that completely unbearable pain caused Cheng Ming to let out a painful scream as the wind blades surrounding him instantly dispersed. As soon as the pain in his head subsided a little, a half-metre-long earth spike was viciously thrust into his stomach! Cheng Ming fell to the ground in agony, covering the earth spike in his stomach, blood was gushing out wildly, instantly staining his clothes red.\nWang Bo walked past Cheng Ming without stopping in the slightest.\nCheng Ming raised his eyes in great difficulty to look at him, a flash of determination in his eyes, and then desperately mobilized a small trace of psychic energy and a wind blade soundlessly shot toward Wang Bo’s calf!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPfft —— a sound rang out, Wang Bo had not expected Cheng Ming to be able to mobilize his psychic energy even though he was seriously injured to that extent. Even though it was only a small trace of psychic power, the wind blade managed to create a bloody gash on his calf.\nCheng Ming cracked a satisfied smile.\nWang Bo was successfully enraged, he kicked Cheng Ming hard near his heart, and sent him tumbling backward. Blood was dripping from the corner of Cheng Ming’s mouth, half of his face was stuck with dust as he lay motionlessly on the ground. Wang Bo’s gaze was cold, he coldly barked orders at the few other special abilities users: “Kill them.”\nBrother San cursed without fear: “I’ll f*ck your ancestors! I won’t spare you even if I’m turned into a ghost! If one of our men escaped today! We’ll make you pay back a thousand times more! Your little god*mned b*stards!”\nJia DaoZhang wanted to follow suit with the curses but he was too injured and didn’t have the strength. He just hissed in a small voice: “Lao San… good curses… good.”\nWang Bo said in a cold voice: “Nail them both to the wall and drain every single drop of blood from them. I want to see how long they can curse.”\nInstead of being shocked by the gruesome suggestion, the earth ability user was slightly excited and agreed with a chuckled: “Hehe, I like this way of death torturing!”\nDozens of half-metre-long earth spikes with sharp tips instantly solidified in front of his chest which looked very terrifying.\nCheng Ming could not bear to watch any further and closed his eyes in despair.\nBrother San was still cursing bitterly and brazenly.\nJia DaoZhang could no longer speak, his mind had begun to recite to himself the scripture of transcendence. However, he rethinks again that if he was to reincarnate into this world once more, it would be so miserable. Therefore, he gave up reciting and quietly waiting for death.\nJust then!\nA wretched howl of misery rang out!\nBrother San’s curses were cut off, Jia DaoZhang’s eyelids twitched and he struggled to open his eyes. Cheng Ming trembled and glanced towards the place where the miserable howl came from……\n===============================================================\n(T/N: For clearer references\nTeam of Seven abilities users consisted:\nLi Qi – Speed ability user\nJiang Xue – Mental ability user\nWang Bo (Leader) – Water ability user\nLiang Long/Skinny man – Earth ability user\nSun Guang – Fire ability user\nNo name – Earth ability user\nHuang Fei – Plant ability user\nAhhhhhh hang on Cheng Ming, Jia DaoZhang, and Brother San!

    "68": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-68/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat earth ability user had a thick green vine sticking out of his chest and as if he still didn’t know what was going on, the excited and cruel smile was still frozen on his face. He looked down in amazement to see that the green vine had penetrated his chest, the tip poked straight through his chest and out from his back. The tip of the vine was moistened with blood and blossomed into a blood-red flower. Those half-metre-long earth spikes conjured by him lost their power and shattered to the ground.\nImmediately afterward, the earth ability user was swung up by the vine that was stuck in his chest and wheeled into the wall with a snap. The tip of the vine plunged deep into the wall, pinning the earth ability user into the wall. The earth ability user’s body twitched in pain for a while and the blood on his face faded away, leaving him hanging there with his last breath while the blood trickled down from the vine to the ground ——\n\n\n\nEveryone present stared at the scene with incomparable dismay and shock, even the air seemed to freeze. Brother San stopped bellowing and watched dumbfounded as the one who had just been ready to nail him to death was now nailed to the wall by vines that seemed to have fallen from the sky.\nJia DaoZhang squinted his eyes and struggled from breathing in and out with his mouth. He shifted his body slightly with great difficulty, trailing along the vine that had pinned the earth ability user. A huge shock made his eyes widen in disbelief at the person standing on a huge vine that was as thick as a bucket.\nCheng Ming fell to the ground and glanced in the same direction as Jia DaoZhang. The expression on his face could not be read if he was crying or laughing. He just stared in a daze at the person who was standing on top of the vines and was rushing towards them quickly as he couldn’t believe his eyes.\nOnly Brother San who still had some strength left shouted in shock: “Gu Ning?!”\nGu Ning was standing steadily on top of a giant vine, the wind rustling in her ears, her short blonde hair dancing in the wind. She glanced at Brother San, Jia DaoZhang, who was hanging upside down, and Cheng Ming, whose breathing was sluggish while laying on the ground. Her wave of psychic energy surged up in a manic manner. Underneath her feet, the giant vine was rushing forward rapidly. Behind her, Zhang XiaoBai, Xiang Xu, Xiang Yi, including Hong Jie were all hugging tightly onto the vine for the fear of being thrown off.\nThis unbelievable scene caused everyone to be speechless.\nJust as they were shocked.\n“Bang!” “Bang!” “Bang!”\nThe sound of three heavy objects crashing to the ground rang out.\nIt was as if the three people who had fallen from the sky were dropped like worthless sacks to the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Jiang Xue?!”\nThe plant ability user cried out in shock as he stared at the person who had been thrown to the ground.\nThe three people who fell from the sky were none other than Jiang Xue, Sun Guang, and Liang Long, who had gone after Zhang XiaoBai and Xiang Xu!\nJiang Xue dropped to the ground, her face was pale and in extreme pain. Not knowing how many bones had been broken in her body and she looked completely different from the high-spirited person just a few minutes ago. The other two were lying motionless on the ground, unsure whether they were dead or alive.\nJiang Xue cried out in her last few breaths: “Help, help me ——“\nWang Bo stared at the Jiang Xue and the others on the ground in shock and snapped out of it. He didn’t even want to see who was the owner of the vine, and almost instantly without hesitation, his psychic energy surged out wildly and conjured countless water walls out from the flat ground! In the blink of an eye, a dozen or so water walls were erected!\nWith a wave from Gu Ning, several small vines as thick as an arm instantly broke out of the ground! As they grew rapidly, they quickly tangled together and twisted into a single thick vine which then drew a graceful arc in the air before crashing towards the dozen walls of water! The soft vine, which had always been known for its binding skills, had now become a powerful weapon!\nAll that could be heard was the sound of splattering water! The vines effortlessly destroyed the first water wall, then the second, the third, and the fourth —— The seemingly strong and indestructible water wall looked as fragile as tofu right now and the crash from the vines made them turn into raindrops and splashed onto the floor. The water wall only stalled the vines for a moment before the huge vine crashed through all the water walls destructively without reducing their speed as they charged straight towards Wang Bo!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe dozens of water walls were all destroyed in less than a few seconds! Wang Bo’s pupils instantly shrank and he retreated sharply. He no longer cared about the consumption of his psychic energy and it gushed out frantically. Instead of creating water walls for defences, he had conjured numerous water arrows that drained up thirty percent of his remaining psychic energy! Then with a wave of his hands, the hundreds of water arrows all shot densely towards the vines!\nThe water arrows looked transparent and watery, but they were not weak in their strength and a hundred arrows in a single shot were even more powerful! The arrows showed off their great power as they met the incoming vines in the mid-air. The vine had already been drained of most of its strength by the dozens of water walls it had passed through, and when they collided, the vine was shattered by the numerous water arrows after lasting a few seconds of resistance!\nWhen Wang Bo saw his water arrows shattered the vine, his spirits lifted and he shouted to the already frozen plant ability user: “Huang Fei!”\nHuang Fei, the plant ability user, finally recovered from his shock. Seeing the miserable state of the earth ability user, and Jiang Xue and the others, he knew that if he didn’t put in all his efforts in this fight, he would suffer the same fate. Thus, he immediately got up his spirits and mobilized all his powers to prepare for the attack.\nGu Ning had reached them by now, Zhang XiaoBai, Xiang Xu, and the others all jumped down from the giant vine. Luo Long even vomited, while the rest ran to rescue Jia DaoZhang, Brother San who were hanging upside down as the other checked on Cheng Ming’s condition.\nWang Bo yelled: “Huang Fei! Attack!”\nHuang Fei released all his psychic power and dozens of vines broke out from the ground, twisted, and rushed towards Gu Ning!\nWhile he was attacking Gu Ning with all his might, Wang Bo stuffed a replenishing transparent crystal core into his mouth, then suddenly retreated after he finished conjuring dozens of water walls! He darted in the opposite direction instantly!\nHuang Fei looked incredulously at Wang Bo as he ran away. It was clear that Wang Bo was using him to hold back Gu Ning so that he could escape!\nWith a single wave from Gu Ning, countless vines grew up and directly wrapped away Huang Fei’s vines before one of them stabbed into his body and pinned him next to the earth ability user.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning’s gaze was icy as she stared at Wang Bo’s back view in the distance as he ran desperately and frantically, and she was about to activate her psychic powers to chase after him.\nHong Jie’s anxious voice rang out: “Gu Ning! Cheng Ming can’t make it!”\nGu Ning saw Wang Bo disappear behind the building but she gave up without any hesitation for the pursuit and ran over to Cheng Ming’s side instead.\nCheng Ming was laid flat on the ground by Hong Jie, his eyes were closed in pain and when he heard Gu Ning’s footsteps, he struggled to open his eyes with difficulty. When he saw that it was really Gu Ning, he wanted to smile at her yet he couldn’t even control his face’s muscles. He was still bleeding from the earth spike that had poked through his abdomen and caused him to lose too much blood. Cheng Ming thought that he was probably going to die and since he was able to see Gu Ning again, he could at least rest in peace. However, there was something he hadn’t said to her and he swallowed hard with difficulty before preparing to speak his last words.\n“Shut up.” Gu Ning coldly stopped him: “Don’t speak and just close your eyes.”\nCheng Ming almost couldn’t catch his breath but still obediently closed his mouth yet he refused to shut his eyes and squinted to look at Gu Ning.\n“Pass me the knife.” Gu Ning stretched out her hand to the side.\nLuo Long hurriedly handed the knife to Gu Ning, who carefully cut off all the clothes next to the wound, revealing the full extent of the wound. It looked particularly ghastly with the earth spike plugged deeply into the flesh.\nGu Ning glanced at Cheng Ming before saying: “Zhang XiaoBai, come over here.”\nZhang XiaoBai hurriedly rushed over.\nGu Ning instructed: “Pluck out the earth spike.”\n“What? ? ? ! ! ! “ Zhang XiaoBai stared at Gu Ning with a shocked expression. The earth spike had penetrated Cheng Ming’s entire abdomen, if he just pulled it out hastily, it was likely that Cheng Ming would die on the spot.\nGu Ning didn’t have any time to explain and just instructed: “I’ll countdown from three, then you will pluck it out.”\nZhang XiaoBai stared into Gu Ning’s eyes, before he solemnly nodded, then trembled as he gripped onto the outermost area of the earth spike that had remained out of the wound.\nGu Ning glanced at Cheng Ming and said calmly: “One.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai tensed up.\n“Two.”\nXiang Yi covered Xiang Xu’s eyes.\nGu Ning, right now was staring at Cheng Ming’s wound with full concentration, placing her hands on either side of the earth spike.\n“Three ——“\nEveryone’s heart jumped ——\n“Ah!” Zhang XiaoBai shouted and with great force, he pulled the earth spike out of Cheng Ming’s body! There was blood spurting out! Cheng Ming’s face instantly turned a few shades paler than previously as his whole body was twitching violently before fainting from the immense pain ——\nGu Ning’s hand, which had been placed beside the earth spike, immediately pressed down onto the wound the moment the earth spike was plucked out while closing her eyes.\nThe green ocean in the space suddenly fluctuated and then began to rotate at high speed which formed a huge whirlpool from the middle while a column of water rose and spun towards the sky —— There were countless green dots of light emerging from Gu Ning’s palms and flowed into Cheng Ming’s wound ——\nXiang Xu was covered by Xiang Yi’s eyes, but that did not prevent her spiritual power from perceiving it.\nShe sensed the green dots of light emerging from Gu Ning’s palms and was shocked: “What a powerful fluctuation of psychic energy ——“ A powerful fluctuation meant that the amount of psychic energy was also greatly consumed.\nGu Ning closed her eyes and concentrated on directing the green seawater from the space to pour into Cheng Ming’s wound. An endless stream of green seawater rose from the ocean into the air, transforming into green dots of light in Gu Ning’s palm while entering into Cheng Ming’s body through her guidance, rapidly repairing all the organs damaged by external forces ——\nBrother San and the incredibly weak Jia DaoZhang looked incredulously at the occasional green dots of light leaking out of Gu Ning’s palm. Although they didn’t know what these green dots of lights were for, they were very clear that Gu Ning was trying to save Cheng Ming.\nZhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu, who had already been rescued and treated by Gu Ning, still felt very shocked even when they saw it for the second time.\nGu Ning’s hand slowly detached itself from Cheng Ming’s abdomen.\nThe crowd of onlookers subconsciously padded over.\nThe bloody hole in Cheng Ming’s stomach that ran through his abdomen had disappeared. If it weren’t for the residual blood on his stomach, it would have been as if he wasn’t injured at all. Cheng Ming remained unconscious due to the loss of a large amount of blood.\nJia DaoZhang was shocked till speechless: “This……”\nGu Ning smiled: “These are my psychic power, the plant, and healing ability.”\nJia DaoZhang swallowed hard: “This is incredible.”\nGu Ning used the same technique again to heal the wounds on Jia DaoZhang and Brother San.\nJia DaoZhang was still immersed in this shock.\nBrother San, however, asked: “Gu Ning, what was the reason for your disappearance then?”\nGu Ning replied mysteriously: “I’ll explain it to you all later.”\nBy the time they reached the supermarket, with a little wave from Gu Ning, the entire shelf of stuff had all vanished into the thin air!\nEveryone’s jaws dropped.\nBrother San stared at the empty ground, not knowing if he should be nervous, excited, or even scared. His tongue was tied in a knot before asking: “What, what’s going on here?”\n“This is my other psychic power. I call it the Spatial ability.” Gu Ning replied, spreading out her hand, and there was an extra packet of chips that appeared on her palm. As soon as she closed her palm, the chips disappeared again: “To put it simpler, it’s similar to a large storage cabinet, but the key to this locker is only available to me.”\nEveryone’s mouth was left hanging wide open.\nJia DaoZhang asked: “So, how much stuff can you fit in this large storage cabinet?”\nGu Ning thought about it, even she didn’t know how much she could fit in her space, so she once again showed a mysterious smile and said: “Follow me.”\nEveryone just followed Gu Ning in a dumbfounded manner, and then they saw that everywhere Gu Ning had been to, all the things in that place disappeared! She managed to empty the entire first floor of the department store.\nAll of them felt like they were hallucinating as they watched the vast first floor of the department store which had been filled with shelves and various items become unbelievably empty.\nAfterward, they followed Gu Ning to the second floor.\nThe second floor was selling clothing and attires.\nGu Ning walked around for a while and then it was fully emptied.\nThe third floor was selling all kinds of home appliances. After Gu Ning strolled around, it was also cleared away.\nWhen they reached the fourth floor, it was all filled with all kinds of household products. Gu Ning took a stroll again, and it was also fully emptied.\nThe group of people who stood behind Gu Ning were all in a trance.\nFinally, Brother San broke down and whined: “Gu Ning, how is that a storage cabinet, where can we find a locker that can hold that much stuff!”\nZhang XiaoBai also broke down: “Gu Ning, you’re practically incredible! Either there was no psychic power or suddenly you had developed three psychic powers! Three psychic abilities! How can that be justified? How can the rest of us live?”\nOnly Jia DaoZhang’s eyes narrowed with joy, sighing that he really had good foresight, that he had known from the beginning that Gu Ning was someone special. Now, she even had three psychic abilities at once, what a crazy concept?!\nAll the soldiers had all gone crazy.\nGu Ning spoke solemnly: “I hope you all can help me keep my healing ability a secret and it’s best not to share with anyone about my spatial ability too.”\nBrother San calmed down and continued: “That’s right if that news of your psychic abilities leaked out,  I’m afraid it will be disastrous.” In the post-apocalyptic world, the medical conditions were unimaginably poor, if others knew that Gu Ning had healing powers, the trouble caused would be beyond their imagination.\nAll the people presented obviously understood the consequences and all of them agreed to it.\nThen, they all joyfully flocked around Gu Ning and travelled down to the first floor.\nWhen Bai Lang, Zhuang Chen, and the others arrived at the Haining Department Store, they knew that the place had been visited by someone when they saw the earth wall that had been crumbled at the entrance and the wet mud footsteps all over the floor. However, they were stunned when they entered and faced the empty first floor and all fell into a short silence.\nThen a man spoke in shock: “How is that possible?!”\nZhuang Chen was also a little shocked.\nShe had been here the day before the apocalypse happened, and there was a huge variety and quantity of stuff. There was no way it could have been moved away so cleanly, not even a scattered biscuit on the floor and even the shelves were all gone. How was this possible?\nJust as they were all greatly perplexed.\nSome people were coming down from the second floor.\nThe sound of footsteps mixed with the relaxed laughter was very eye-catching.\nAs soon as Bai Lang waved his hand, all the special abilities users including Zhuang Chen prepared themselves for the first exchange of blows.\nBoth sides froze as soon as they met.\nEspecially when Zhuang Chen saw Gu Ning on the escalator, she couldn’t help but blurted out: “Gu Ning?!”\nZhuang Chen’s red hair was extraordinarily conspicuous and Gu Ning naturally saw her at a glance, and was still a little stunned: “Zhuang Chen? Why are you here?”\nGu Ning was really too surprised, if nothing went wrong, Zhuang Chen should be with Fang Fa now, already reached the capital or on the way to the capital…… Her heart suddenly thumped, her eyes searched quickly in the crowd next to Zhuang Chen, and didn’t find that familiar face. Suddenly her expression changed slightly: “Where’s Fang Fa? Where is he?”\nWhen Zhuang Chen noticed the changes of expression in Gu Ning’s face, she hurriedly explained: “He is fine for the time being, and is now at your colony.”\nGu Ning relaxed a little and then questioned: “What do you mean he’s fine for now?”\nZhuang Chen replied: “He was injured and I am here to find medicine for him.”\nGu Ning asked as she walked down the escalator: “Is he badly injured?”\nWhen this unfamiliar name spoke from Gu Ning’s mouth, Brother San, Jia DaoZhang, and the rest were all curious about this person as none of them knew him. Plus, it was very obvious that this person was very close to Gu Ning.\n“It’s a bit of a problem.” Zhuang Chen frowned and continued: “The doctor said he needed an operation, but there were no tools and medicines. I just came out here to look for these things and I didn’t expect to meet you first.”\nGu Ning replied: “I have all these things.” She asked directly: “So are you coming with me now or…?”\nWithout hesitation, Zhuang Chen agreed: “I’ll go with you.”\nBai Lang’s expression was a bit stunned: “Zhuang Chen?”\nZhuang Chen stared at Bai Lang with a straight face and answered: “What? I came out to look for medicine and Gu Ning. So of course, I’ll leave first after finding everything I’ve needed.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Tada!!!

Gu Ning didn’t tell Zhuang Chen about her spatial and healing abilities, but only mentioned she had developed plant psychic power. After asking again about the condition of Fang Fa, she was slightly relieved to learn that it was not a life-threatening situation. Brother San and the rest had never heard Gu Ning mention Fang Fa’s name before. Gu Ning had always been rather cold in her dealings with people, and it was so rare to see that she cared so much about someone. Right now they had just become closer to Gu Ning, and here came Fang Fa, whom they didn’t know, so they inevitably had some strange feeling in their hearts.\nZhuang Chen was good at reading body language and at this moment, looking at the subtle expressions of those people in the truck, she could probably guess what they were thinking. She was only a little curious as she had been separated from Gu Ning for less than a week, and these people all seemed like they should have known Gu Ning since then, so how did Gu Ning have gained such an important position among them in such a short period?\nThe wood element psychic ability was not the strongest and it might even be the weakest among other psychic powers. Also, the power fluctuations of several people in this carriage were not weak……\nThe journey back to the colony was fairly uneventful, shocking the survivors in the colony when the big truck drove back in and parked in front of the small compound where they lived and started unloading. The children were very happy as if it was Lunar New Year’s Eve when they saw the small loads of supplies in the truck.\nGu Ning let Brother San in charge and handled the rest. Then she sent her greeting to her parents before directly following Zhuang Chen to the infirmary to find Fang Fa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San glanced at Gu Ning and Zhuang Chen’s distant back view and couldn’t help but frown.\nZhang XiaoBai couldn’t hold back either and asked: “Brother San, what kind of relationship do you think that Fang Fa or whatever the name is, has with Gu Ning? She seems quite anxious about him.”\nBrother San snapped: “If you ask me, who should I ask?”\nLuo Long nervously came over and chimed in: “Then Gu Ning wouldn’t follow them and leave right?”\nZhang XiaoBai was stunned and replied: “No way?”\nZhong Xu interjected: “I don’t think Gu Ning is going to leave with them. She even hid her healing and spatial abilities from the woman and only told us about them. What does this mean? Trust! Trust, right? We are her family.”\nBrother San cut them off their discussion and said impatiently: “*The rain will fall, the womenfolk will marry. We can’t stop Gu Ning if she wants to leave.” He couldn’t help but sigh after saying that.\n(T/N: *天要下雨娘要嫁人 tiān yào xià yǔ niáng yào jià rén means the natural order of things, something which they can’t go against with.)\nHe was also worried about that too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJia DaoZhang abnormally didn’t join in the conversation, he had already thought of it anyway. He would go wherever Gu Ning went.\nDoctor Gao was nowhere to be found.\nFang Fa was placed on the bed and was now flipping through a high school textbook in a bored manner, his face looking pale.\nHe was completely frozen when he saw Gu Ning who had followed Zhuang Chen in.\nHis jaw dropped as he stared at Gu Ning and asked: “Gu Ning?! You, why are you here?”\nGu Ning walked over and took a good look at the bandaged wound on Fang Fa’s thigh, then replied: “I should be the one asking you this.”\nFang Fa scratched his head, and although he was surprised to see Gu Ning here, he was still very happy: “We had an accident, so we made a detour.”\nAbout this accident, in the truck, Zhuang Chen also roughly mentioned.\nGu Ning suddenly asked Zhuang Chen: “Zhuang Chen, can I have a moment alone with Fang Fa?”\nZhuang Chen replied very sensibly: “Of course.” Then she turned around and walked out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Let me take a look at your wound first.” Gu Ning said as she was about to remove the gauze that wrapped around the wound on Fang Fa’s thigh.\nFang Fa pressed Gu Ning’s hand and stopped her: “Don’t don’t don’t. It’s disgusting, you’re not a doctor, so why do you need to look at it?”\nGu Ning glared at him and Fang Fa surrendered in the end, lying back and saying helplessly: “Fine fine fine, look all you want.”\nGu Ning carefully lifted the gauze wrapped around Fang Fa’s wound, the gauze was stuck to the pus and his leg twitched when she tore it open. Finally, she removed the gauze and the wound on his thigh was completely exposed.\nFang Fa pursed his lips and whined: “See, I told you it looks disgusting ——“\nGu Ning stared at him and told him seriously: “Fang Fa, whatever happened next, I hope you will promise me not to tell anyone.” Gu Ning paused and continued: “Including Zhuang Chen.” Although she admired Zhuang Chen, a day with her was not enough for Gu Ning to fully trust her. Not to mention that Zhuang Chen’s relationship with Bai Lang was still unclear. She didn’t dare to take any risk.\nFang Fa didn’t know what Gu Ning was talking about and froze for a moment before nodding.\nGu Ning then raised her hand and placed it a little above Fang Fa’s wound before she began to mobilise her psychic power.\nWhen those green dots of light appeared in Gu Ning’s palm, drilling into his wounds, Fang Fa couldn’t help but widen his eyes in shock. He subconsciously used his hands to brace himself and prepared to retreat but he stopped after being glared at by Gu Ning.\nGu Ning closed her eyes again and focused on manipulating the seawater in the green ocean from the space ——\nIf one examined closely, one would see that the level of the green ocean was slipping. The amount of psychic energy consumed, including the healing for Cheng Ming, Jia DaoZhang was so great that if one were to use Xiang Xu’s psychic energy as calculation. It would all have been drained by the time she finished healing Cheng Ming. It was also Gu Ning, who had acquired such a huge ocean of psychic energy to sustain her large consumption in such a short period. Yet to her, the amount of psychic energy was only like ten percent or probably twenty percent of what she had consumed.\nFang Fa only felt a cool wind enter his wound, then a very itchy feeling came from the wound. He restrained himself from scratching it, but just held his breath and watched the green dots of light that kept emerging from Gu Ning’s palm without blinking. He wanted to ask Gu Ning what it was, however, she had her eyes tightly shut and was so focused that he was afraid of interrupting her, so he could only restrain his overflowing curiosity.\nGu Ning’s eyes were closed and turned sideways to face him, and her expression was very focused. Her skin was a little pale and she looked a little sickly, yet she had obviously looked much healthier before when she still had black hair. Fang Fa thought silently, then continued to watch her, her features were all small, but they all seemed to be just the right size. The right size for the eyes, the nose, the mouth…… not too pretty to be offensive nor was it too plain to be completely lost in the crowd.\nShe used to look a lot friendlier when she had black hair and often exchanged some questions and discussions with him. After she had dyed her hair blonde, it seems that even her personality had changed quite a bit. She gave off a sense of detachment when she was not talking and always spoke in a cold and emotionless manner.\nHowever, strangely enough, he didn’t know if it was just his illusion. It seemed that Gu Ning was much closer to him after this encounter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, he didn’t know that Gu Ning’s closeness to him was because of his other self in the other world.\nFang Fa saw Gu Ning’s eyelashes twitch slightly, after some inexplicable panic, he hurriedly shifted his stares away. Then his gaze naturally landed on the wound on his thigh, his eyes widened in shock, looking at his intact thigh in shock: “…… This ——“\nWhile rewrapping those gauze around Fang Fa’s thighs again, Gu Ning explained to him: “This is my psychic power. Healing.” She tied those gauze around Fang Fa’s thigh as before then continued: “I need you to pretend that you’ve just had an operation. I’d be in trouble if too many people knew about this psychic ability of mine.”\nFang Fa’s throat throbbed for a moment. Yet, you trusted me so much? He wanted to ask her, but looking at Gu Ning’s natural look, he felt like he didn’t even need to ask anymore.\nGu Ning stood up and said: “If Zhuang Chen asks, just say that I’ve operated on you.”\nFang Fa froze and nodded, then snapped back to attention and replied: “I don’t think I can hide it from her.” He paused: “She’s smart.”\nGu Ning answered: “I didn’t think I could hide it from her, but just trying to keep her from knowing the actual truth.” Gu Ning didn’t ask Fang Fa about his parents, since they weren’t together, then he hadn’t found them yet.\nFang Fa asked: “Have you been well?”\nGu Ning nodded without hesitation, and couldn’t help but show a small smile on her face: “I’ve found my parents. And, I met a lot of friends.” The cold detachment on her face instantly faded when she smiled and she seemed more lively.\nYet for some reason, there was a strange sour feeling in his heart when he heard Gu Ning say that she had met many friends.\n“What about you?” Gu Ning suddenly asked: “Want to join me?”\nFang Fa didn’t respond for a moment: “Huh?”\n“We encountered very powerful mutated zombies when we went outside this time.” Gu Ning’s expression immediately became gloomy: “This world is evolving at a more rapid rate than we can imagine and is becoming more and more dangerous. Right now it is only three months, so what would happen three years from now? If you want to survive then you must always be a step ahead of the world. That means we have to become stronger.”\nGu Ning continued solemnly: “There is a limit to how strong a person can be, even if they are very strong. We have a lot of special abilities users in our group now, we were the first batch to know and to evolve as a group. This means that we are probably the group that has the best chance of surviving in the world now. So Fang Fa, I now solemnly invite you to join us.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Bonus Year End/New Year Chapter!!! Ahhh such a nice way to end and start a new year with this chapter. Hehehe. Hmmmm let me see if I could rush another chapter out for today instead of Sunday usual upload. Finger-crossed. Thank you all for reading! )\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "70": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-70/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen faced with such a solemn invitation from Gu Ning, Fang Fa chuckled a little: “Gu Ning, do you need to make it so serious. Even if you don’t ask me, of course, I’m still going to follow you.”\nThus, it was a natural and pleasant agreement.\n\n\n\nFang Fa suddenly asked again: “But what about Zhuang Chen? Do you have any ideas for recruiting her to your team as well? She’s a wind ability user and has great skills.”\nGu Ning pondered for a while before shaking her head somewhat hesitantly: “There is no such plan for now. I see that she seems to have an unusual relationship with the other team. Although I admire her, I can’t figure her out yet so I’m afraid there’ll be trouble.”\nFang Fa nodded and replied: “Your concern is right. Zhuang Chen’s identity is definitely not that simple, that group of people who hijacked the plane at that time is people whom Zhuang Chen used to know. It was a group of five and all of them are special abilities users, and very arrogant.” He added after a pause: “But Zhuang Chen is a good person.”\nGu Ning, of course, knew that he was talking about his legs being injured and having difficulty in moving, and those days of separation, they might have suffered a lot of danger. Zhuang Chen and Fang Fa were just acquaintances who were heading in the same direction, but even if Zhuang Chen left him halfway, no one would say anything. Just the fact that she didn’t leave Fang Fa behind, shows how precious her personality was.\nIt was just that Zhuang Chen was close with Bai Lang, and although Bai Lang had never been in direct conflict with them, their relationship had always been rather delicate. Zhuang Chen had such a special background identity, which made Gu Ning a little more cautious with her.\nAfterward, Gu Ning didn’t deliberately mention this matter to Zhuang Chen. Instead, it was Zhuang Chen who first asked Gu Ning about her plans: “Gu Ning, what are your plans for the future? You aren’t going to stay here forever, do you? I’m not being alarmist, this place is safe for now, but you should know that it won’t be safe forever. Special abilities users, after all, are just a minority, one in a thousand or even one in a million chance. If you encounter a large wave of zombies besieging this place, it won’t work with just a few special abilities users.”\nZhuang Chen stated very frankly: “Your parents aren’t special ability users so they would need a more stable environment to live out their old age in peace. The capital has the strongest military force, and there are certainly the most special abilities users. If you come with us, I can guarantee that you and your parents will be safe to the greatest extent possible. Both on the road as well as when we get to the capital. I admire you, Gu Ning, so I would like you to come with me to the capital.”\nShe paused, then continued: “I heard from Bai Lang that you’ve met a group of people here and they’ve taken in a lot of children…… It’s a bit cruel to say that, but the world is too dangerous for them right now, and you need to make sure you can survive first before you can protect others.”\nGu Ning nodded and replied: “I know.”\nZhuang Chen patted her shoulder and said: “We would still be here for another three or four days or so. Thus, you can think about it during this period. If you really want to come with us, you can bring Fang Fa and your parents with you. And of course, the other special abilities users are all welcome.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning smiled and replied: “Alright. I will give you an answer as soon as possible.”\nZhuang Chen also smiled and spoke after casually flicking her hair behind her ear: “Alright then, I’ll hand Fang Fa back to you then.”\nGu Ning nodded again: “Mmm.”\nZhuang Chen bid goodbye to Fang Fa before strolling away.\n“You’re not going to leave with her, are you?” Fang Fa asked as soon as he stepped off the bed.\nGu Ning smiled, not dismissing it away, as Zhuang Chen’s offer was very tempting but she also had something she couldn’t throw away.\nOn the other side, Bai Lang was asking Zhuang Chen a similar question: “I guess she won’t come with you.”\n“She needs a bit of time to consider it.” Zhuang Chen paused: “I don’t think there’s much hope though.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“She probably thinks she’s the Virgin Mary who needs to save the world.” Yin Sang suddenly sneered coldly.\nZhuang Chen glanced at her coldly and sneered after noticing that Yin Sang’s cut had already healed: “It seems that the wound healed so quickly that you’ve forgotten about the pain.”\nYin Sang immediately tried to rebut back, yet was cut off by a single glance from Bai Lang.\nZhuang Chen looked at Bai Lang then at Yin Sang, suddenly chuckled before saying with a smile: “Bai Lang, I’m seriously interested in seeing you and Gu Ning being together.”\nBai Lang was a little stunned.\nYin Sang, however, instantly became very gloomy.\nZhuang Chen laughed while nodding her head: “It would be very exciting.”\nBai Land replied mockingly: “Looks like you’re bored in Yi ShaoQing’s absence.”\nZhuang Chen actually nodded and answered thoughtfully: “It seems so, at least he’s not as boring as you guys.” After saying this, she stood up from her seat and strolled out with her long legs while ordering: “Have that water ability user under you to pass me two buckets of water. I need to take a shower.”\nAfter a flurry of eager introductions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere in the hall was quietly subtle.\nZhang XiaoBai sat opposite of Fang Fa, smiling harmlessly as if nothing had happened, and asked: “Hey Fang Fa, what’s your relationship with Gu Ning? How do you know each other? How long have you known each other?”\nFang Fa didn’t think too much about it, and in the spirit of wanting to get on good terms with them, he spilled out everything about the meeting with Gu Ning and so on.\n“Oh~~ You’ve only known her during the apocalypse.” Zhang XiaoBai caught the point of the chat and said in an unexpectedly deep and long tone. After exchanging a few looks with the others, the atmosphere was becoming harmonious.\nCheng Ming was badly injured, and although Gu Ning had used her healing ability to heal him, he was still unconscious because of the blood loss. He was awake for a short while in the truck before passing out again.\nDinner was ready by three o’clock.\nHuang MengYao was responsible for starting the fire and Zhong Xu for conjuring the water.\nZhong Xu was arguably the most miserable of all, and from the time he returned, he kept condensing water for daily uses. Since there were girls around, the soldiers all gave up on the idea of taking a shower in the courtyard as a group and all took turns carrying buckets of water into the showering room to bathe.\nThe men’s clothes that Gu Ning had raided from the supermarket were piled up in a heap, and the soldiers were excitedly picking out the clothes that suited them. It was somewhat unfortunate that it was summer when the apocalypse broke out, so most of the clothes in the mall were still summer clothes.\nThe soldiers scrubbed off all the black mud that had accumulated on their bodies, washed their faces, and felt that their noses were cleared after wearing their new clothes. The smelly clothes that they normally didn’t feel were stinking, at this moment, all of them refused to wear them back. Finally, after thinking of a solution, they decided to wash the clothes and let Huang MengYao dry them directly with her fire ability.\nThe children finally found something to do and all of them volunteered to throw the soldiers’ dirty clothes in the basin and wash them together. They were washing it decently, not minding the dirt and stench, they were all so well-behaved that it was heart-breaking.\nLater, when Zhuang Chen saw Huang MengYao was manipulating the fireball to roast dry the clothing, she found it to be amusing and joined in with her wind ability to blow dry at the hanging clothes. All the children’s faces turned red with joy, cheering and clapping loudly at the scene.\nOn the other side, Mother Gu was preparing dinner. Zhang Yang, who was originally in the cooking sector, was even better at cooking with a big spatula than Mother Gu and several other soldiers were there to do the remaining work while Mother Gu instructed them. The soldiers basically didn’t let Mother Gu do anything, so she could only move her mouth and the soldiers actively took care of it for her. Seeing this, Father Gu chimed cheerfully to Gu Ning: “I can’t believe it, your mother really has a bit of the style like a commander chief.”\nGu Ning had collected a whole supermarket’s worth of supplies, so to speak, she had everything. Therefore, she could immediately extract anything out of her space when someone requested it. A group of children followed behind her, exclaiming their amazement.\nWhen there was a lack of stools or tables, Brother San immediately used his earth ability to build them, completely making the best use of everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe courtyard was so lively with adults and children that one was transported back to the time before the apocalypse happened. Everyone’s face was involuntarily smiling, enjoying this rare moment of peace and happiness in this post-apocalyptic time.\nGu Ning watched the innocent and happy smiles on the faces of those small children running in and out of the courtyard and said to Zhuang Chen who was beside her: “Although I can’t guarantee that I will be able to protect them as they grow up, I will still do my best.”\nThe smile on Zhuang Chen’s face gave a slight pause, then she sighed and replied with an undisguised regret: “It seems that this is your answer for me.”\nGu Ning smiled and said: “Mmm. That’s my reply to you.”\n“Actually, I kind of can’t figure it out.” Zhuang Chen hesitated but still asked: “You were clearly once abandoned by that bus of people, so why are you now……”\n“Because they’re not those people.” Gu Ning looked at Zhuang Chen, her eyes shining: “I do not doubt that if the same thing happened with these people, they would not hesitate to save me. My parents are still alive, and with so many friends, I’m doing well now.”\nZhuang Chen froze for a moment, then raised her eyebrows and asked: “So you just forgive those people?”\n“Forgive?” Gu Ning suddenly stared at Zhuang Chen and smiled: “If you are unfortunate enough to meet those people halfway, then please take “good care” of them for my sake and make sure not to let them get away easily with it.”\nZhuang Chen was stunned for a moment before suddenly bursting into a hearty laugh.\nGu Ning also smiled faintly, gazing up into the sky.\nShe would never forget the despair she felt when the bus drove away, nor the pain she endured when the zombie virus struck.\nForgiveness?\nGu Ning’s smile became slightly cold.\nPerhaps she might only try to forgive when those people gave her back their life.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hurray managed to rush out the chapter and posting it all today!

    "71": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-71/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis was probably the heartiest meal all of them had since the apocalypse happened.\nGu Ning’s plant ability came in handy, as the carrot, which was as thick as a small arm, grew as thick as a thigh as soon as it was boosted by Gu Ning’s psychic power.\n\n\n\nThe various alcoholic beverages brought back were chilled with ice by Jia DaoZhang.\nThere was no meat, but a hot meal and chilled drinks, not to mention in the post-apocalyptic world, all these were cherished by everyone.\nBrother San had made two long tables. The children all ate at the other table, which was obviously much shorter.\nDuring a lively exchange of glasses, a small whimper suddenly sounded.\nEveryone glanced over and saw that it was a little boy of eleven or twelve years old, holding a bowl and crying while eating.\nBrother San asked with a smile: “Why are you crying when you’re eating well?”\nThe boy sobbed and wiped tears from his eyes as he replied: “I miss my mum……”\nThe children, who had just been so happy, all fell silent at these words. All these children were brought back by the soldiers, some were separated from their parents and some became orphaned. Perhaps because they had seen so many terrifying things, they were more well-behaved and obedient than one another. However, they were still children, after all. So as they were eating the hot food, it probably reminded them of the past, which was why they couldn’t hold back their tears.\nThe soldiers looked at each other and didn’t know how to comfort them.\nMother Gu and Huang MengYao placed down their bowls and went to comfort those teary-eyed children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nInstead, Gu Ning suddenly said to Brother San: “Let them learn how to use knives and guns from tomorrow onwards.”\n“Huh?” Brother San didn’t react for a moment.\nAll the children glanced over at once.\n“Really?” A little boy called Wu Sen stood up excitedly.\nGu Ning replied: “Mmm. If you guys perform well enough, I’ll even give you the crystal cores.”\n“Wow! So can we become as good as you guys?” Another boy asked nervously but also excitedly. They had discussed privately the adults developing their psychic powers and were all full of longing and anticipation for those mysterious crystal cores. Yet they had never thought that Gu Ning would be willing to give it to them!\n“What about us?” A little girl around twelve or thirteen with a crooked little ponytail asked. She mustered up all the courage to ask and by us, she naturally meant their little group of girls.\nInstead of answering, Gu Ning asked: “Are you willing to learn?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe little girl stole a glance at Xiang Xu, who was sitting next to Gu Ning, and with a vague look of hope in her eyes, she gathered her courage and nodded: “I’m willing.”\nShe was the oldest of the girls and had always taken the lead. Now that she had taken the lead, the other little girls also plucked up the courage to say yes.\nGu Ning nodded approvingly and said: “Then from tomorrow onwards, you will all follow along too.”\nThe excitement from the news managed to make the children throw away the sadness which they had just gone felt, and even the little boy who had just been teary joined the guys with their exciting discussion.\n“Gu Ning, you’re really good.” Zhang XiaoBai gave a thumbs up to Gu Ning.\nBrother San, however, lowered his voice and asked: “Gu Ning, are you serious or were you just coaxing them?”\nGu Ning answered: “Of course I’m serious.”\nBrother San stated with some difficulty: “Aren’t they too young for that?” The oldest teenager was only fourteen years old.\nMother Gu was also clearly a bit reluctant: “They are still so young and asking them to learn these things now, I’m afraid that it will be detrimental to their future growth.”\n“The prerequisite is that they can grow up.” Gu Ning explained solemnly: “I don’t require them to be able to follow us out to kill the zombies, but at the very least, they can escape from the mouths of the zombies when we have no time to take care of them.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“I think Gu Ning is right.” Zhuang Chen chimed in approvingly: “And don’t underestimate children, I could already take on more than one adult when I was ten.”\nXiang Xu spoke like an adult: “Although they are not as smart as I am…… I can still teach them how to become a little smarter.”\nAfter having their dinner, it was already after six o’clock and it was completely dark. Zhuang Chen left and went back to Bai Lang’s sector.\nHuang MengYao threw a few fireballs to illuminate the backyard.\nUnder the light of the fireballs, everyone gathered around and began to count the crystal cores which they had obtained during the day. The colourful and transparent crystal cores were glimmering brightly.\nAlthough the number of zombies they had killed was at least several hundred, there were still relatively only a few evolved zombies. Thus, there were only five coloured crystal cores and thirteen transparent crystal cores in total. One of these four crystal cores went to Hong Jie while the other was split with the other soldiers who didn’t get a turn with the crystal cores last time. The crystal core that had been dug out from the head of the mutated zombie, Brother San gave it to Gu Ning. However, what was surprising was that none of the five people, including Hong Jie, had developed their powers this time. Compared to the high probability before, the result this time was a bit unacceptable.\nThose failed soldiers were obviously very disappointed. Even though Hong Jie was a little disappointed, she didn’t put much thought into it: “I’m a handful of years old anyway, so I’ll be in charge of managing all your logistics from now on.”\nJia DaoZhang’s heart couldn’t help but be a little thankful for their luck.\nAt night, Gu Ning placed the beds she got from the Haining Department Store into the rooms, one for Father Gu and Mother Gu, one for Hong Jie and Huang MengYao and the other was for the youngest children.\nThe other rooms, although they did not have beds, were covered with thick quilts from Gu Ning.\nThe soldiers felt satisfied as they lay on the soft quilts insulating them from the coldness of the floor.\nThe children burrowed into the soft warmth of their blankets and went to sleep with happy smiles on their faces, except for a few little boys, who were still whispering excitedly at the thought of tomorrow’s training and were too excited to sleep.\nGu Ning made a floor bed next to Father Gu and Mother Gu’s bed.\nFather Gu asked as he lay in bed: “NingNing, what are your plans for the future?”\nGu Ning froze for a moment after hearing Father Gu’s question, then placed her hand behind her head and started thinking that she hadn’t been chatting much with her parents recently. She had inevitably neglected her parents’ feelings by being busy with various things these days. Thinking of this, Gu Ning felt a bit apologetic, she stared at the ceiling and then answered honestly: “I don’t know.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning was now a little confused and lost.\nThe reason she refused Zhang Chen’s invitation was that she couldn’t leave behind her companion with no special abilities and the capital was too big with lots of complicated forces. Gu Ning subconsciously felt that Zhuang Chen’s background was very complicated and she really didn’t want to be involved in some unnecessary power and political struggle.\nShe had remained in the post-apocalyptic world at the beginning for a sole reason that was to protect her parents. Yet, now she had more people to protect and more goals, one of which was to use the resources on this side of the world to provide her parents in the peaceful world a better life as well.\nShe knew very well that this colony would not last long, especially after Bai Lang and the others had gone too. However, she didn’t know where she could go if she left here.\nGu SiYuan was not a father in the traditional sense, he was happy to communicate with his child and listen to Gu Ning’s confusion. Under his guidance, Gu Ning would always go to Gu SiYuan to chat about any of the confusion or worry she had since she was a child. In a sense, Gu SiYuan was probably the person in the world who knows her the best apart from Gu Ning herself and even more than Mother Gu.\nWith just a simple sentence of not knowing, he already understood how at a loss Gu Ning was at this moment.\nHe started counselling her: “We can’t predict the events in the future, so let’s just solve the immediate issue first and as for those things we can’t see, there are always ways to deal with them when the time comes.”\nGu Ning’s tightened eyebrows relaxed slightly. Although she knew that her father was trying to counsel her, what Father Gu said was not without any reason. She couldn’t be sure how long this colony could hold, so there was not much point for her to worry about here and there. It was better to settle matters at hand first.\nThe next day at breakfast, Gu Ning told the others: “I think it’s time to spread the news of the crystal cores.”\n“Huh?” Everyone else was a little surprised by this news.\nBrother San replied with approval: “Well, now that all of us have completed our first round of evolution and are more skilled at manipulating our powers, there’s no use in hiding this information anymore. Now that the zombies are evolving so quickly, it would be better to disseminate this information earlier, so that more special abilities users would appear to kill more zombies. That would do us more good than harm.”\nWhen Brother San explained this, the rest who hadn’t understood, finally agreed to it.\nThus, that day they spread the news.\nThe news was that there were crystal cores in the brains of the zombies and that if they ate those cores, they could also develop their special abilities. This news spread quickly within an hour in the colony of more than two thousand people like it had wings attached to it.\nThe fireballs that Yan Yu sent out at the entrance of the colony attracted a lot of attention, and the killing power of those fireballs to the zombies was also appealing. After that event, some people had been discussing how Yan Yu had conjured those fireballs, but they didn’t get an answer and after this information was spread, their confusion immediately went away.\nThe dullness of the colony was instantly set abuzz! To be precise, it was the people living in the colony who were overwhelmed. They exchanged stories about the credibility of the news and finally received confirmation from Zhong Xu, Zhang XiaoBai who was in charge of spreading the information.\nExcept for the children and the elderly and some of the women, people were forming groups and headed out the door of the colony, where they had been afraid to go, to do what? To hunt zombies and get crystal cores, of course!\nAfter receiving the news, Yin Sang’s face was very gloomy: “It was Gu Ning’s gang who spread the news of the crystal cores.”\nZhuang Chen didn’t know where she got a file to sharpen her nails and kept her head down as she focused on sharpening, not even lifting her eyes when she heard the news.\nBai Lang’s reaction was also very cold.\nYin Sang was very dissatisfied with their reaction and said in annoyance: “Now all those people are running out like crazy to kill the zombies.”\nAs if she could hardly withstand Yin Sang’s whining and rebut: “Isn’t this a good thing?”\nYin Sang’s eyebrows knitted: “A good thing?! Those people killed all the zombies, then what is left for us to kill? The crystal cores have all been dug away, and the more special abilities users there are, the worse it will be for us.”\nZhuang Chen spread her fingers to carefully check where else her fingernails were not repaired, not even bothered to pay any more attention to Yin Sang.\nYin Qi replied: “Gu Ning is actually willing to spread the crystal cores’ information to those people to grab, what a surprise.”\n“You guys’ thoughts are for the present, yet she’s thinking about the future. At least for now our biggest enemy is still the evolving zombies out there.” Bai Lang continued: “Since she had already spread the news, there’s no need for us to delay and stay here any longer.” He paused briefly as he spoke, then turned to Zhuang Chen and asked: “Are you sure Gu Ning’s not coming with us?”\nRecalling the smile on Gu Ning’s face and her reply last night, Zhuang Chen let out a slight sigh and then answered: “That Gu Ning is good at everything but she is too soft-hearted.”\nBai Lang’s gaze flickered slightly as he stated: “Such a person is most likely to die.”\nZhuang Chen glanced at him and rebutted him with some dissatisfaction: “I know you don’t like Gu Ning, but you shouldn’t curse her to death.”\nBai Lang, however, gave Zhuang Chen a side glance then stood up and walked away while replying in a light tone: “Who said I don’t like her?”\n……\nDue to Bai Lang’s impromptu decision, they decided to depart for the capital today.\nWhen Zhuang Chen went to bid goodbye to Gu Ning, Gu Ning had already driven out to hunt so she could only inform Father Gu and Mother Gu about it.\nCompared to the past, Gu Ning met quite a few people from the colony, all in groups, with at least ten people moving together.\nSeveral places could be seen with the scene of several dozen people besieging the zombies.\nAt Gu Ning’s request, they didn’t go over to help, as if they saw their group of special abilities users, they would only immediately try to suck up to them.\nThey did not stay at the edge of the downtown area but went straight into it. It was a bit regrettable that they did not encounter the two mutated zombies, since Gu Ning, a plant ability user with a perverted number of psychic abilities, they were hoping to meet and fight again with those mutated zombies to wash away their previous battle’s shame. The journey could be described as peaceful, even if there were hordes of zombies, they were small waves of no more than twenty, and most of them were ordinary zombies. The only thing that made them feel happy was that Gu Ning took them to sweep the whole shopping street of shops. They were all a little surprised when Gu Ning even raided a large gold jewelry shop.\nGu Ning explained very calmly: “Maybe we’ll need it later.” In her mind, she had already calculated who she was going to find to sell the loot for her.\nAlthough they hadn’t harvested many crystal cores, they still had gained enough supplies to make them very happy.\nHowever, this happy mood only lasted until they entered the door back at their base.\nAfter entering, the smiles on the faces of the people who entered first froze after staring at those people sitting on the sofa in the hall. Then they all looked over at Gu Ning in unison.\nGu Ning was the last to enter the building and was a little confused when she saw everyone’s gazes, then she shifted her gaze, and the smile in her eyes instantly froze as she saw Jiang YueZhou, Jiang Yu, Lin MeiFeng’s family sitting on the sofa in the hall. Mother Gu and Father Gu who were sitting on the opposite sofa and looking at her, all were at a loss for words.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sorry all, I am caught up with too many things so postponed last week’s update. Thus, I’m posting Sunday upload now too. Hopefully, I could rush out another chapter. XD Also, Pang V, sorry to delay your dedicated chapters as I’m waiting to the point of the story that at least had a fighting/battling scene in it. (Which would appear soon.)

    "72": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-72/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere in the room went from awkward to icy cold all of a sudden.\nThe children were uneasy and curious, they poked their heads around the door and were shooed away into the backyard by their sharp-eyed Hong Jie.\n\n\n\nFang Fa felt even more embarrassed by the scene, he had seen Gu Ning clash with Jiang YueZhou’s family and he didn’t expect the Jiang Family to find their way here.\nJiang YueZhou was fidgeting and when he saw Gu Ning at that moment, he felt even more ashamed. He just squeezed out an embarrassed smile, got up, and called out: “NingNing, you… you’re back.”\nFather Gu had been sitting on the sofa with a stern face, if it wasn’t for Mother Gu holding him back, he would have gone straight back to his room. Only then did the expression on his face loosen when he saw Gu Ning return. However, Mother Gu stood up at once and greeted Gu Ning: “NingNing, come and sit here, your aunt and uncle have something to say to you.” As she said this, she kept winking at Gu Ning.\nAt this time, Jia DaoZhang coughed dryly and interjected: “Cough, cough, that… Gu Ning, we’ll go out for a walk then.” Those who were frozen at the doorway also reacted and walked out as if they had just woken up from a dream.\nAfter thinking about it, Hong Jie felt that she could roughly be considered as a party and she could stand up for Gu Ning if there was any trouble, so she stayed behind.\nAfter Jia DaoZhang and the others had left, the remaining people in the room were Gu Ning’s family, Jiang Yu’s family, and Hong Jie.\nGu Ning heard Mother Gu calling but turned a deaf ear to it, not even moving a step, and just stared coldly at the Jiang family.\nJiang YueZhou became even more embarrassed from her stare, he just stood there unsure if he should take a seat or not. On the other hand, Jiang Yu’s head was lowered with her long hair scattered down on both sides that covered most of her face which made her expression unreadable. Lin MeiFeng cursed Gu Ning in her heart, but when she thought about the clean beds, the leftover food in the backyard, and the half-full room of food and drinks. Lin MeiFeng squeezed a smile onto her face and said dryly: “NingNing, your aunt and uncle have come here to apologize to you. Previously, we were blinded by greed and wronged you. But we are still a family, we are your uncle and aunt, you can’t just watch us being eaten by those monsters out there, can you?”\nGu Ning had not spoken a single word and when she heard this, she finally reached the end of her patience and bluntly spoke in a cold voice: “Get out.”\nThe smile on Lin MeiFeng’s face froze, then she looked at Mother Gu as if pleading for help: “*Da Jie, see this Gu Ning is so…… Da Jie, you only have YueZhou as your only related brother, your mom and dad held your hand before they passed away and insisted you look after YueZhou.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n(T/N: 大姐 Da Jie means big sister or elder sister.)\nMother Gu’s heart was tormented, her family has always consisted of her and her brother, from childhood and till they grew up, they had always been so close. Although she was also angry that he didn’t help during the bus incident, they had grown up together as very close siblings. Mother Gu’s expression loosened and couldn’t help but be persuaded: “NingNing……”\nYet, just as she had called out Gu Ning’s name, she was cut off by her: “Mom, think carefully and clearly. It’s the truth that you only have one brother, but at the same time, you also only have one daughter, that’s me! If the person that day had been Jiang Yu, do you think we would have left her behind?” She stared at Mother Gu without blinking and continued with determination: “If you want to have this brother, then you’ll have to lose me.”\nMother Gu jolted in shock.\nIt was no wonder that Gu Ning spoke so harshly, it could be said that she had a deep hatred for Lin MeiFeng. Although she did not feel the same way about Jiang Yu as compared to Lin MeiFeng, she still could not tolerate living under the same roof with her. As for Jiang YueZhou, her own uncle who had loved her since childhood, Gu Ning was angry at his cowardice. Even though there was still some reluctance in her heart, Lin MeiFeng repeatedly pestered her, wearing out the last trace of patience she had left. If it wasn’t in consideration of Mother Gu’s feelings, Gu Ning would have shot Lin MeiFeng to death to vent her hatred.\n“Gu Ning! You’re trying to disown your relatives!” Seeing Gu Ning spurting out such words, Lin MeiFeng knew that she wasn’t just saying it. Finally, she couldn’t stand it anymore, stood up directly, and pointed at Gu Ning’s nose while scolding: “How did the Gu Family give birth to such a little brat like you who disowns her relatives!”\n“Enough!” Father Gu who had been sullen and silent, suddenly bellowed. He was so gentle that he rarely got angry with people, and had never raised his voice to Mother Gu for so many years. Father Gu was even more courteous in front of outsiders, but at that moment, his loud shout shocked the whole room. He seemed to be so furious that he pointed at Lin MeiFeng and yelled: “What my Gu family’s daughter, is not for you, a malicious outsider, to say!” After he scolded Lin MeiFeng, he turned to Mother Gu and continued: “JiaoJiao, if you want to retain them, I’ll be the first to reject it!” He pointed at Jiang YueZhou again and explained to Mother Gu: “Look carefully, she scolded our daughter like that, and did Jiang YueZhou stop her at all? Are you willing to let our daughter be bullied like this?!”\nJiang YueZhou’s mouth moved at his words, but he was so ashamed that he didn’t know what to say. Mother Gu glanced at Gu Ning upon her words and when she saw that Gu Ning’s eyes were slightly reddish, her heart suddenly trembled. Recalling all those suffering Gu Ning had endured during the post-apocalypse, she felt a pang in her heart. She glanced at Jiang YueZhou’s ashamed face and thought about how he had repeatedly indulged Lin MeiFeng, even though he had not uttered any bad words…… Mother Gu suddenly felt that his face was somewhat unfamiliar at this point, she sighed and didn’t look at him again while announcing softly: “You guys better leave.”\nJiang YueZhou was shaken and stared at Mother Gu incredulously, but he couldn’t believe that she would chase him away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAt that point did Jiang Yu jerk her head up to look at Mother Gu, obviously not daring to believe that this aunt, who had always been so soft-hearted, would make such a decision. A few moments later, she fell into tears and shouted miserably: “Auntie…….”\nMother Gu didn’t even look at her and just said: “Jiang You, stop calling me your aunt. At that time, I didn’t know whether you did that purposely or not, but, it was because of you that my family had lost NingNing.”\n“I really didn’t mean it.” Jiang Yu burst into tears while holding the hand of Jiang YueZhou next to her, looking at him with a panicked expression: “Dad, say something!”\nJiang YueZhou was also stunned by Mother Gu rendered him speechless. And only when Jiang Yu called out to him did he regain his senses and panicked exclaimed: “Sis……”\n“*Lao Er, you knew deep in your heart whether I, as your sister, treated you well or not. But what about you? Did you treat me fairly?” Mother Gu suddenly interrupted Jiang YueZhou then stood up and pulled Father Gu away and said: “Old Gu, I’m feeling stuffy in my chest, come accompany me to go out for some fresh air.” She dragged Father Gu and headed to the backyard, not even giving Jiang YueZhou a chance to explain.\n(T/N: 老二 Lao Er refers to the second child in the family.)\nWith shame and fear on his face, Jiang YueZhou didn’t know what to do anymore.\nGu Ning felt more assured and comforted in her heart, then she asked Hong Jie: “Hong Jie. Please help me get some people to see them out. I’ll go and check out my parents.” With that, she actually left Jiang’s family and went straight to the backyard.\nNaturally, Hong Jie was delighted to do so, and as soon as she pushed the front door open, she saw that the doorway was packed with people eavesdropping next to it. Then she instructed Brother San, who was accosted at the front: “Get some men and send them out.”\nBrother San froze for a moment, they couldn’t hear much from outside. All they heard was curses and were startled by the suddenness of chasing them away as they didn’t expect it to be resolved so quickly.\nAll of them glanced at each other and were slightly awkward to take the first step.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHowever, Jia DaoZhang rolled up his sleeves and accepted: “I’ll do it.” Then he turned to Jiang YueZhou and said with a smile on his face as the crowd stared in amazement: “All of you, leave then.”\nJiang YueZhou and Jiang Yu didn’t know what to do, all of these happenings were too different from what they had expected. They thought that in front of Father Gu and Mother Gu, Gu Ning would at least be less aggressive, but they didn’t expect Gu Ning to be more revengeful than they had imagined. Even Mother Gu, who had always been soft-hearted, had somehow managed to be ruthless today.\nHowever, Lin MeiFeng shouted after lying down on the sofa: “I’ll see how you guys can chase me out! I will just lie here, eat here and sleep here! I want to see who dares to throw me out today!”\nA gleam of light flashed across Jiang Yu’s eyes, but her face was quickly floated with shame and tears while looking at Lin MeiFeng and said: “Mom, let’s go, we shouldn’t be a burden for Gu Ning…..”\nOn the contrary, it was Huang MengYao, who had been keeping a low profile since she had followed Gu Ning, who spoke up: “Stop pretending, no one here is watching your act.”\nThe expression on Jiang Yu’s face froze for a moment.\nHuang MengYao continued: “Since you all are men and it’s not good for men to hit women so Hong Jie, I’ll give you a hand.”\nA smile emerged on Hong Jie’s face: “Great.”\n“Jiang Yu, right? Please excuse us.” Huang MengYao said excuse us, but she directly shoved Jiang Yu to the side rudely and then went forward to grab Lin MeiFeng who was lying on the sofa. Hong Jie also pushed Jiang YueZhou away and went ahead to grab Lin MeiFeng too.\nBefore they could touch Lin MeiFeng, she let out a pig-screeching scream: “Help! Murder! ! ! Murder ! ! !” At the same time, her hands and feet were flinging and kicking around like a crazy woman.\nHuang MengYao, impatiently grabbed Lin MeiFeng’s wrist directly while her palm was covered with a layer of flame. With this grab, Lin MeiFeng genuinely let out an extremely miserable cry: “Ahhh ! ! ! !”\nJiang Yu couldn’t see the flames on Huang MengYao’s palm and after hearing the scream, she secretly thought that Lin MeiFeng was exaggerating.\nHuang MengYao grabbed Lin MeiFeng’s wrist for more than ten to twenty seconds before releasing it. Lin MeiFeng’s face was sweating in pain, but she couldn’t break away from Huang MengYao’s grip and just scream desperately. The longer Jiang Yu watched, the more she felt that something was off until Lin MeiFeng fainted from the pain then she realized that Huang MengYao must have used some underhanded method.\nIt was only then that Huang MengYao let go of Lin MeiFeng’s already burnt wrist and said: “Look, I’m asking you guys to leave nicely and you three refuses, now you both have to carry her out.”\nJiang Yu was shocked by Lin MeiFeng’s burnt wrist and stared at Huang MengYao’s murderous expression. She didn’t dare to rebut a single word and could only carry Lin MeiFeng out with Jiang YueZhou in a wretched manner while tears rolled down her face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe door snapped shut behind them.\nHuang MengYao glanced at the room of people that were staring at her with astonishment and inexplicable gaze. She felt slightly embarrassed, brushed her short hair behind her ear, and said sheepishly: “They’re just too annoying.” It was a far cry from the ferocious look she had just now.\nXie YuHong, who was always very quiet, replied: “I think that’s the actual you.”\nHuang MengYao gave him an annoyed look but froze slightly when she saw that Cheng Ming was smiling at her.\nAlthough Mother Gu said those refusals ruthlessly, she felt pain in her heart. After being calmed down by Father Gu and Gu Ning for a while, she went to bed and took her medicine.\nAt that moment, Gu Ning just realized that Lu JiaZi didn’t come with them.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Eeeeekk that Jiang’s Family…. really… gosh. Good that Mother Gu had finally decided to cut off their ties. Anyway, thank you all for reading and concern! Hopefully, I could rush out another chapter for Sunday….)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "73": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-73/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter a simple dinner, everyone freshened up and then went back to their rooms.\nMother Gu lay in the bed and sighed, regretting that she should have at least given them something to eat.\n\n\n\nGu Ning rolled over and pretended not to hear, while Father Gu was patiently comforting Mother Gu.\nGu Ning thought about her proficiency in manipulating her powers during the day, and the amount of psychic energy she had, she felt that she didn’t need to fight in any close-quarters combat anymore. Thus, did she really need to spend so much effort to enter the Five Stars Brigade to learn close combat skills? This side of the world was exhausting enough, maybe one could take it easy in the other world……\nA little while later, Gu Ning sneaked out of the room and went straight into the space after entering the storage room in the backyard.\nThe first thing Gu Ning did after returning the space was to go and check the ocean of psychic energy. She had only just reached the shore and immediately felt that something was wrong. She was surprised to find that the level of the green ocean had lowered, the grass on the beach had previously grown close to the sea but now the sea level had shrunk so much to a distance of five metres and away.\nThis ocean was Gu Ning’s source of psychic energy, and of Gu Ning’s two types of powers, the plant ability consumption was lesser but the consumption of the healing ability was very frightening. If it were for any other special abilities users, such a huge consumption of psychic energy might have drained away all their reserves. However Gu Ning, because she has such a huge amount of psychic energy reserve, didn’t control it at all when she manipulated it……\nOn the contrary, as far as the feedback from Xiang Xu and the others was concerned, the speed of recovery for the psychic energy was very fast as long as they were not depleted. Yet for some reason, Gu Ning wasn’t sure about her psychic energy whether it was recovering abnormally slowly or simply not regenerating itself after consumption….. If it was the former reason, it would be fine, but what if it was the latter? Thinking of this, Gu Ning couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat.\nEven if she had that much psychic energy in front of her, eventually it would run out sooner or later if she wasn’t able to absorb replenishment for it. Not to mention the healing ability consumption of psychic energy was huge.\nGu Ning sat on the beach for a while, after having a taste of being powerful, Gu Ning could hardly imagine losing her powers again. Just thinking about that situation made her feel drenched in a cold sweat.\nShe instantly dismissed the idea of giving up on entering the Five Stars Brigade. If she had become too dependent on her powers and once they could no longer be used, wouldn’t she be a failure or useless?\nShe stared carefully at the waterline again and then drew a line at the junction where the water joined the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOnly then did she emerge from the space with uneasiness.\nLooking at the clock, the time was 6:30 am.\nShe changed out of her dirty clothes and wore the military uniform before going to the bathroom for a wash-up. Then she strolled out clean and fresh.\nAlthough Gu Ning had maintained her posture throughout the day’s training, her mind had been preoccupied with the psychic energy in the space and was slightly distracted. However, as Gu Ning had always been a person of few words, Zhang XiaoBai and the others did not notice any difference.\nAs soon as she returned to her room at night, Gu Ning couldn’t wait to return to the space to check the waterline. However, she saw that the water still remained at the line she had drawn and it didn’t rise at all. The day went by without any of her psychic energy being replenished, and her hopeful mood was immediately washed down by a pot of cold water.\nEven though she had been mentally prepared for it, Gu Ning was still a little depressed when it really was the worst possible outcome.\nShe sat on the beach all night and studied it but she didn’t come up with any solution.\nThe next day even Zhang XiaoBai noticed that she was depressed and thought that she was being nervous about the Five Stars Brigade selection tomorrow, so Zhong Xu and Zhang XiaoBai took turns comforting her for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning had finally come to her senses. After all, if she couldn’t rely solely on her psychic powers, close combat would be a life-saving skill for her. After going around in circles, Gu Ning felt like she was back to square one. Since the psychic energy couldn’t be regenerated, Gu Ning decided to use lesser in the future, not wanting to waste her power until only at critical times. She instantly had a kind of feeling like she was back to the night of liberation, where her pockets were filled with silver but she didn’t dare to use it and the feeling was very suffocating.\nToday’s training only lasted half a day.\nBrother San had decided to give them half a day off to get in shape for tomorrow’s selection.\nThe three were quite happy but there was a sense of tension and anxiousness in that happiness. Gu Ning was the most relaxed of the three, although she now had a sense of urgency to enter the Five Stars Brigade, she had the secret card of her psychic ability in her hands, and so she could try and use her powers to cheat when it was crucial. As compared to Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu, she felt a little better.\nIn the past two days, Chen Gen of the first company also trained with them. Chen Gen looked like just twenty-three or twenty-four years old, with a common look and a very calm personality, and was able to keep quiet for half a day. It was said that their company had nicknamed him Muffled Gourd. The past two days, Zhang XiaoBai had been making jokes about him and he was not annoyed or angry, but he also ignored him which in turn bored Zhang XiaoBai.\nGu Ning admired him but just didn’t know if he managed to escape during the apocalypse.\nAfter half a day’s vacation, Zhang XiaoBai was there chattering for half a day and finally decided to go to an internet café to play games. He invited Gu Ning along, saying he could take her to practice for leveling. Gu Ning expressed no interest and wanted to take a trip back home instead.\nZhang XiaoBai immediately made a strong request to visit Gu Ning’s house: “Gu Ning! Take us with you! How about taking our parents out for a big dinner? It’s on me!”\nZhang XiaoBai and the others used to call Father Gu and Mother Gu the same way during the post-apocalyptic times. Gu Ning didn’t feel anything wrong for a while and just told him about the inconvenience of hiding her situation from her parents. Zhang XiaoBai immediately replied: “Just say that we are your college classmates, won’t you? I still look so young like a recent graduate, and for Zhong Xu who was slightly older, just say that he’s a classmate who looks old. As for Chen Gen, you can say that he is the college military training instructor.”\nZhong Xu laughed out loud and Gu Ning was also amused by Zhang XiaoBai, but Chen Gen replied seriously: “I have something to do this afternoon.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning continued: “You two should go and play the game as planned. I’ll go back and return in the evening.” On one hand, she wanted to bring back the money, and on the other hand, there was that little vault in her space. She was going to sell it away and it was not really a good idea to bring anyone with her.\nZhong Xu arranged: “Then let’s take the bus together and head over to Golden Gate Street, we’ll go there for a stroll too.”\nIt just so happened that Chen Gen’s errand was also heading to the city centre, so it was happily decided.\nSince there were four of them, Zhang XiaoBai was so cheeky that he persuaded Brother San to especially approve an off-road vehicle for them to drive there.\nThey chatted and laughed along the way, discussing the tactics to be used when they faced the Five Stars Brigades tomorrow. Time flew by and they soon arrived at their destination.\nAfter parking the car in the car park, the four exchanged their mobile numbers, when they saw the bulging Nokia in Gu Ning’s hand, Zhang XiaoBai exaggeratedly marvelled for a while. Even Chen Gen was a little surprised and then they made an appointment to meet here at seven o’clock at the latest.\nAs soon as Gu Ning left, Zhang XiaoBai couldn’t help but ask: “Is Gu Ning’s family having some financial difficulty? I see that she usually wears sports clothes or something, and she doesn’t have any feminine clothes. The mobile phone she is using has long been discontinued, right?”\nZhong Xu also answered with a deep thought on his face: “Don’t mention going to her house in the future. To prevent her from being embarrassed.”\nZhang XiaoBai nodded his head repeatedly.\nChen Gen, however, went off in another direction after a simple greeting.\nGu Ning casually waved for a taxi, now she only wanted to be convenient, previously, she would never take a taxi if she could have taken a bus. When she got into the car, she wanted to call Fang Fa but she thought better not to do so and asked the taxi driver next to her: “Sir, do you know where there will be a pawn shop?”\nIt took half an hour for the taxi to stop and the driver pointed to the shop across the road and said: “See? It’s the one across the road with the red sign.”\nGu Ning thanked the driver and got out of the taxi. After getting out of the car, she didn’t immediately enter the pawnshop but found a public toilet and took out dozens of gold necklaces from the space, packed them into a black plastic bag before crossing the road, and walked into the pawnshop.\nHalf an hour later Gu Ning came out of the pawnshop with several stacks of red bricks in her backpack.  When the pawnbroker quoted a figure, Gu Ning signed the pawn note without any objection which went more smoothly than she had expected. The final payment from Fang Fa’s side was also credited to her card, so Gu Ning now had nearly 100, 000 yuan. Gu Ning carried her backpack and it swept away any depression she had from her psychic energy and her face finally revealed a few smiles.\nWhen she returned home, only Mother Gu was there. Gu Ning suddenly returned without greeting and Mother Gu was so surprised and delighted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Why are you back at this time?” Mother Gu asked nervously: “It’s something wrong with your work?”\nGu Ning smiled and replied: “Nope. The kid’s grandparents came today and took him out to play, so they gave me half a day off. Thus, I came back. They were especially pleased with me.”\nMother Gu then breathed a sigh of relief before asking: “Have you eaten?”\n“I’ve eaten.” After Gu Ning had pawned the gold necklace, she went to a small restaurant, ordered several meat dishes, and cleared all of them which even stunned the owner.\nGu Ning sat down on the sofa, then took out the money from her backpack.\nThree neat stacks of large red banknotes were laid out on the table, startling Mother Gu: “What… where did you get so much money?!”\nGu Ning answered: “Isn’t there some family debt we owe? I’ve talked to the parents of that family to see if I could get a three-month advance for my salary, and since they were particularly happy with me while Fang Fa helped in guaranteeing it, they agreed. Take this money to pay off the urgent ones first, and wait a while for the others that are less urgent.”\nMother Gu was surprised and delighted but was still slightly unconvinced: “This… How can those parents be so nice?” There had been several calls recently urging for the payment. She and Father Gu were lying in bed last night, worrying about where they would get the money to pay it back, and these tens of thousands of dollars were a real relief.\n“This 30,000 yuan, I’ll pay back the 10, 000 to your uncle’s family first. Your aunt had called several times to urge, saying that your cousin had a job which needed to send some gifts. Previously when I loaned her eighty thousand, I didn’t even rush her so frequently. By the way, your uncle has heard that you’re back and asked you to come over for dinner. Let’s go over on one of the Sundays and return the money too.”\nThe smile on Gu Ning’s face disappeared without a trace as soon as she heard Mother Gu mention her uncle’s family, and she simply replied perfunctorily: “Let’s talk about that later. Go and keep that money first.”\nMother Gu hurriedly picked up the money and chimed while walking back into the room: “NingNing, you should really thank Fang Fa! He introduced you to such a good job!”\nGu Ning suddenly cut her off and asked: “Mom, aren’t you going to take a nap?”\nMother Gu replied: “I was just about to take a nap, but I didn’t know you were coming back. Now how could I fall asleep?”\nGu Ning said: “I want to catch some winks too, so let’s sleep together.”\nThe two of them lay on the bed and chatted for a long time. Mother Gu also told Gu Ning about the cactus that had come back from the dead on the balcony, and Gu Ning had linked it back to her psychic powers that had leaked out that night.\nHalf an hour later, Mother Gu had fallen asleep soundly.\nOnly then was Gu Ning able to do her own thing.\nShe held onto Mother Gu’s wrist, then manipulated her healing powers and kept pouring into Mother Gu’s body through her palm while Mother Gu was oblivious about it.\nAlthough Gu Ning knew that her psychic energy could not be replenished, she still had no intention of saving it up when treating Mother Gu and the psychic energy gushed out wildly.\nIt took around half an hour before Gu Ning let go of Mother Gu’s hand and Mother Gu’s originally heavy breathing became lighter.\nGu Ning carefully got up and walked to the balcony. Looking at the very verdant cactus that Mother Gu said to have come back from the dead, and sighed at the wonders of psychic powers.\nMother Gu got up after a good sleep. Not only was she relaxed, but she also didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. She even smiled at Gu Ning and told her that she felt much better after sleeping with her.\nWithout waiting for Father Gu to return, Gu Ning had left.\nIt was already dark at six o’clock.\nGu Ning stepped out into the light of the street lamps, there was still plenty of time so Gu Ning decided to stroll there, stopping by to admire the streets which were very different from the post-apocalyptic world.\nGu Ning lives in a relatively isolated area, and to get to the main road, she had to go through a lot of those confusing streets and alleys that were dimly lit. In the past, Gu Ning was afraid of the dark and rarely crossed through these alleys at night, but now she was not afraid at all and went straight across those streets and alleys.\nWhen walking out an alleyway, crossing a street to enter another alley, a hand reached out violently from a dark corner. Before Gu Ning could react, she was dragged in and pinned against the wall, and a coarse palm covered her mouth with unerring accuracy in the darkness. A cold aura flashed in Gu Ning’s eyes and when she was about to move, yet as if that person could foresee Gu Ning’s movement, the man lifted his leg and pushed down the leg that Gu Ning was about to lift. A low voice rang out in her ear: “Shhh.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Weeeeee I’ve managed to translate another chapter muahahaha! Hmmmmm… so who is the person that stopped Gu Ning? and soon the Five Stars Brigade selection! Wooots! Thank you all for reading!)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "74": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-74/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning was monstrously strong, however, this man seemed to be even stronger than her, pinning her leg that she was trying to lift, and his body was subtly separated from her. Gu Ning’s heart trembled slightly then she reduced the strength from her legs and obediently leaned against the wall, expressing her will of not resisting. The man seemed a little surprised and hesitated for a brief moment before releasing the hand that was covering Gu Ning’s mouth.\nThe man was so tall that Gu Ning raised her eyes and all she could see was his smoothly defined jaw. In her ears, she could hear the sound of chaotic and hurried footsteps heading toward this way. After a short pause, she could hear a man asking sharply: “Where is he? Where’d he go? How come he’s gone in the blink of an eye!” A few garbled replies and then the burst of footsteps passed by them and headed forward.\n\n\n\nGu Ning glanced at those men with long knives in their hands through her side gazes and immediately frowned.\nAs she heard those voices had drifted away. Gu Ning suddenly reacted, and the elbow that the man released slammed towards the man’s abdomen! The man didn’t expect Gu Ning’s sudden attack and he was a bit shocked but his reaction was extremely fast! He reached out and blocked Gu Ning’s elbow with a grip while saying with a bit of annoyance: “Little girl, you are so unreasonable.”\nGu Ning coldly replied: “You borrow me to hide away from your enemies. If your enemies find out, they will surely think that I’m with you. Then I would be dragged into the mess by you, hacked to death with those knives, and that’s being reasonable?”\nThe man, however, froze for a moment, then smiled dumbly: “Makes sense.” The alley was dimly lit and it was impossible to see what the girl looked like at that moment. Yet there was a thin note of anger in that voice, and by the sound of it, she was very young so he suddenly had the urge to see what she looked like.\nAt this moment, Gu Ning noticed that this man’s strength and skills were much stronger than hers. Also, she couldn’t use her psychic powers to deal with him, so she had no choice but to suppress her anger and negotiate: “I can’t beat you. Please make way, I’m leaving.”\nThe man didn’t expect Gu Ning to take it so well, and after being stunned, he raised his hand and took a few steps backward, and replied helplessly: “Please.”\nGu Ning only felt very unlucky and didn’t even have any interest to look at him as she directly turned around and headed deeper into the alley.\nThe man watched her walk away in the darkness and was slightly startled to see her short, dazzling blonde hair when she stepped out into the lighted part of the alleyway.\nGu Ning walked all the way to the meeting location, where Chen Gen was already squatting there with a bottle of mineral water as if he had waited for a long time. Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu arrived twenty minutes later and in a hurry, carrying several large bags. Apparently, they did a lot of shopping. They apologized to the two of them repeatedly.\nThen they drove back together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt was around 9:00 pm when they returned. Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu were inevitably caught and scolded by Brother San. Chen Gen returned to his first company.\nGu Ning bid goodbye to Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu before heading back to the family building. Zhang XiaoBai instantly caught up with her and shoved a paper bag into Gu Ning’s arms, instructing: “Go back then open up, alright!”\nGu Ning really followed the instructions and waited until she got to her room before opening up the paper bag. Inside was actually a white dress, Gu Ning held up the dress for a moment and then smiled faintly.\nThe first thing she did when she returned to the space was, of course, to check the waterline.\nThe line she had drawn was still there, but the level of the water had shrunk almost half a meter lower from the line again. That was because the psychic power that was consumed for healing Mother Gu’s heart was very frightening. Gu Ning’s brow furrowed and then relaxed. With a thought in mind, she returned to the post-apocalyptic world.\nIt was already eight o’clock in the morning and the sky had just turned bright, so many people were still lazy and asleep at this time.\nGu Ning gently pushed the door open to the room and took a look, Father Gu and Mother Gu were still asleep. She was about to enter in when she suddenly heard a deliberately muffled argument coming from the front yard, and with a glance and a slight pause, she closed the door behind her and headed for the front yard instead.\nGu Ning didn’t push open the front door either but just stood at the window and glanced outside. Huang MengYao was talking to a girl who seemed a bit familiar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe girl was holding Huang MengYao’s hand with one hand while another hand was holding onto a bag of bread: “MengYao, now that you don’t have to worry about food and water by following them, and you have even developed psychic powers, can’t you just help me to talk to them? Let me follow you guys too ah, I can help with many things too.”\nHuang MengYao had a difficult look on her face: “It’s not going to work……”\n“Why not?! Are you worried that I’ll take over your place when I get in?” The girl frowned furiously, then after seeing Huang MengYao’s expression change slightly, she softened her voice again and begged: “YaoYao, the two of us are best friends and have been depending on each other ever since we had escaped from the school together. Are you willing to watch me freeze and starve to death?”\nOnly when Gu Ning heard this, did she recognise that the girl was Xiao YunYun who was with Huang MengYao when she first met Cheng Ming and the others. She had chosen to be on the other side herself when they were trapped in the small courtyard by that zombie dog. Thus, after entering the colony, they were assigned to classroom accommodation. She didn’t expect Huang MengYao to still be in contact with her. It seems that this was not the first time Huang MengYao had privately given Xiao YunYun supplies, and Xiao YunYun was clearly no longer satisfied with Huang MengYao’s support.\nHuang MengYao’s expression became more awkward: “We have rules, we can’t just bring in people. And you haven’t even killed a single zombie yet.” She had personally asked Cheng Ming for help, but he also said that it wouldn’t work as Xiao YunYun was just too weak and hadn’t killed a single zombie so far. If she hadn’t taken over Gu Ning’s knife and killed the zombies, Gu Ning wouldn’t be bringing her along too. Giving supplies to Xiao YunYun was the best she could do.\nXiao YunYun exclaimed agitatedly: “What about Cheng Ming? Can you ask Cheng Ming to help me ah? You, Cheng Ming, and Xie YuHong can help me to plead too! Although I don’t know how to kill zombies, there’s a lot of other things I can do!” She suddenly grabbed Huang MengYao’s hand and her gaze became very strange and asked: “Did you sleep with them?”\nHuang MengYao finally got angry: “What nonsense are you babbling about?!”\nSeeing that Huang MengYao seemed to be really furious, Xiao YunYun hurriedly explained again: “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it, and I was just …… too sad.”\nHuang MengYao, however, was still in a state of residual anger and glared at Xiao YunYun and stated impatiently: “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go in first.”\n“Go ahead.” Xiao YunYun raised the bread in her hand: “Thank you for the bread, YaoYao.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHuang MengYao sighed then she turned around and went back in, only to see Gu Ning who was standing by the window looking at her. She had no idea how long Gu Ning had been standing there but she must have seen her giving bread to Xiao YunYun and was a little bit embarrassed: “Gu Ning.”\n“I just saw her cursing you.” Gu Ning said to Huang MengYao: “When you turned around, she called you a b*tch, I saw that.”\nHuang MengYao froze for a moment before her expression became more embarrassed.\nLooking at Huang MengYao in this state, Gu Ning inevitably thought of the time when she was on the bus, and when she saw the trace of pity in Huang MengYao’s eyes, she couldn’t help but tell her: “Some people are not worthy of you being nice to them.” With those words, she stopped talking, turned, and walked away.\nHuang MengYao froze for a long time then turned around to look out of the window. Watching Xiao YunYun’s back view as she carefully hid the bread under her clothes and walked away, Huang MengYao’s gaze clouded over with a layer of gloominess.\nGu Ning was slightly disappointed to learn from Father Gu that Zhuang Chen had already left with Bai Lang.\nYesterday the whole day, for those who went out to hunt for crystal cores, five or six out of ten lucky people would come back alive, while those who were unlucky would probably all be sacrificed. Only one or two out of a hundred people alive may have picked up the crystal cores. Yet that one person may not even succeed in developing the ability. Yesterday, at least five or six hundred young adults went out but only one person managed to develop the special ability.\nIt was a probability that made one feel hopeful and desperate at the same time. However, today, those who did not develop their powers all glanced at the person who had successfully developed. Some chose to give up, while others still walked out of the gate of the colony without any hesitation. It was impossible to decide which choice was the right one, except one could say that those who walked out of the gates of the colony were very brave.\nIn the morning at breakfast, Gu Ning talked about her inability to replenish her powers at the dining table. Her tone was very flat as if she was just discussing what to eat for her next meal.\nSo bland that it led many to think they had misunderstood Gu Ning’s meaning, Zhang XiaoBai asked after swallowing nervously: “What does it mean that you can’t replenish?”\nGu Ning’s tone remained flat, she had already accepted this fact, so she was able to explain it in such a flat tone: “It means if I use my power, it will get lesser and when it’s finished, it’s gone.”\nThere was a silence at the table, as they all understood what the inability to replenish their powers meant.\nWhen they went out hunting yesterday, they had seen the powerful combat power brought by Gu Ning’s huge psychic power, which gave them an infinite sense of security. Yet, today Gu Ning told them that her psychic energy could not be regenerated.\nGu Ning continued: “So in the future, I will not be using much of my psychic power if possible. Don’t count on my healing ability unless there are serious injuries.” After all, the healing power consumption of psychic energy was several times greater than her plant ability.\n“Ever tried to replenish your energy with the transparent crystal core?” Xiang Xu asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning replied: “I tried it. Didn’t work.”\nThe crowd was disappointed once again, but when they thought about how bummed they all were, Gu Ning might even have a harder time accepting the fact.\nFang Fa took a sip of the porridge then said: “It’s fine, it’s better than having no powers. And your powers are so unbelievable if there isn’t any restriction on them, then you’ll be the bug in the post-apocalyptic time. The rest of us don’t need to live anymore.”\nThere was a rush of agreement from the crowd.\nThus, Gu Ning was removed from the list of zombies hunting today. After Gu Ning told Brother San about the worries of the zombie swarm, they decided to reduce the number of people in the daily crystal hunting activities. In addition to Gu Ning, there were ten other special abilities users in their team. With five of them going out for the hunt, the other five stayed behind. Gu Ning became the key figure for protection, and all of sudden from being in-charge of the main attack in the team to being in-charge of the logistics.\nTwo days passed quietly in the post-apocalyptic world.\nGu Ning left the space and appeared in her room in the family building. Looking at her refreshed self in the mirror after changing into her military uniform, she let out a confident smile.\nIt’s a must for her to get into this Five Stars Brigade.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: I’ve almost forgotten that there was this Xiao YunYun character hahaha. Muahahahaha the next chapters will be the long awaited Five Stars Brigade~ Stay tuned! Thank you for reading! It seem that I had scheduled the timing wrongly. Hahaha sorry for the delay.)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "75": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-75/\n(T/N: These chapters are dedicated to Pang V. Thank you for your kind support and finally awaited the battling chapters. =) )\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and Chen Gen all arrived at the assembly area. Without seeing Brother San, they were directly fetched by the army truck and were brought to the foot of the mountain where they had the mock battle for the four slots.\nBrother San and the others were already waiting there.\n\n\n\nThey were accompanied by the First Company Commander as well as the Second Company Commander, who had no candidate.\nThe First Company Commander started explaining: “The Five Stars Brigade group is already waiting for you in the mountain. All you have to do is one thing, no matter which rabbit hole you hide in, you will win if you don’t get taken out by them within three hours.” He continued in a heavy tone: “I don’t know whether you all are lucky or unlucky, but the four people who came are all-powerful figures of the Five Stars Brigade.”\nThe Second Company Commander who always had some conflict with the first and third companies, yet at such a crucial time, he was on the side of the troops: “You all have an advantage, as you’ve all pretty much mapped out the terrain on this mountain. Let’s see if you can use that to your advantage to close the gap a bit. Logically, they’ll be slightly lenient, so don’t worry about anything and just show your full strength anyway.”\nBrother San didn’t instruct anything, just a simple sentence: “When you guys come back, we’ll go to the seafood restaurant that Zhang XiaoBai has always talked about to celebrate.”\nAfterward, all four of them wear their watch with a countdown of three hours on it.\nThe four of their watches were placed together and then pressed at the same time. It immediately began the count down.\nZhang XiaoBai glanced at the rapidly passing numbers on his wrist and asked: “Why don’t we stay here and chat for a while longer?”\n……\nAt last, the four of them, armed fully and headed up the mountain together with an inexplicable sense of eagerness and excitement with mixed nervousness in it.\nAs the Second Company Commander had said earlier, apart from Gu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and Chen Gen were all familiar with the terrain on the mountain. Gu Ning had been up in the mountains last time when they were fighting for the slot. Although she hadn’t deliberately tried to memorise the terrain, she still had the idea of the general directions, which was indeed a great advantage for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs soon as the four of them entered the mountain, their nerves began to tense. They were way more nervous as compared to the last time they fought for the slot as this time they were officially fighting against the Five Stars Brigade. The slightest movement of the wind and grass around them could easily ruffle their tense nerves. Even Zhang XiaoBai, who had always been smiling, had his face tightened up at this moment, not even a hint of a smile could be seen.\nThe four of them didn’t dare to run, so they moved carefully while checking their surroundings as they bent over and switched between the mountain paths.\nThe Five Stars Brigade was ahead of them in the mountain, and it was a bad feeling not knowing where they were hiding and spying on them. It was frightening to be constantly on the edge of their seat.\nThe four of them managed to move to the bottom of a sheltered slope before stopping.\nZhang XiaoBai leaned against the mountain rock and covered his chest and asked: “Are you guys nervous? I’m so nervous that my heart is about to pop out.” He said he was nervous, but his eyes were flickering with excitement.\nNo one answered him. Zhong Xu’s nervousness was all over his face even though he tried his best to control it but his expression was all very stiff.\nChen Gen still had the same expressionless look on his face, no changes could be seen, but it would be a lie that he wasn’t nervous. Gu Ning popped out half of her head to check the surroundings vigilantly and found nothing suspicious before re-entering the rocky shelter.\nShe was the most relaxed among them. After all, nothing was scary as facing those horrible man-eating zombies in the apocalypse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Gu Ning, what do you think?” Zhong Xu asked, lowering his voice.\nGu Ning’s mouth only moved for a moment and spat out one word: “Wait.”\nUnlike the previous selection, the rule this time was that as long as they were not taken out within three hours, they won. This should be the compromise made by the Five Stars Brigade considering the disparity in strength between the two sides, as well as a reflection of how powerful they were. Thus, if they went around blindly, they might be eliminated without even seeing the group. The safest plan for their current situation was to stay put and wait for the right moment.\nIf the Five Stars Brigade wanted to finish them off, they would have to show themselves first. Once they came out into the opening, Gu Ning and the others were hidden in the dark, the contrast between the open and hidden, was a little more advantageous for Gu Ning and the others.\nChen Gen obviously felt the same way and gave a slight nod of approval to Gu Ning.\nZhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu had the experience from their last training together. In their minds and perception of Gu Ning, she was no longer just a great marksman, they had very strong confidence in her.\nZhang XiaoBai stared at his watch, only to feel that every minute passed by was incomparably torturous. It felt like a long time had passed, but when he checked his watch, only ten minutes or so had gone by.\nEvery five minutes, Chen Gen would peek out with his binoculars to scout.\nHalf an hour had passed quietly, even though the time felt very long.\n“Gu Ning, what are you doing?” Zhong Xu lowered his voice and asked Gu Ning, who was busy with her hands while her back was shifted to the side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai and Chen Gen, both glanced over curiously and saw that Gu Ning had gotten some finger-thick vines from somewhere and was weaving them around for some preparation.\nGu Ning replied; “Making a few traps, they might be useful.”\n“Yes! Why didn’t I think of that! I’ll help too!” Zhang XiaoBai forgot to control his volume in excitement and was covered by Chen Gen: “Shhh!”\n“Where did you get these vines?” Zhong Xu asked as he came closer.\nGu Ning inclined her head and gestured for him to look over there: “Aren’t there quite a lot of them growing over there?” There were indeed many vines like the one in Gu Ning’s hand coiled on top of the rocks near them.\nZhang XiaoBai scratched his head and wondered strangely: “I didn’t even see them just now when we came here.”\nZhong Xu replied: “How could you, a careless person, notice it.”\nThen he also went over and took out a knife to cut off a long vine from it. He tugged it a few times and it was so strong and thick that he thought it wouldn’t be a problem to lift a man. He had never really seen such vines growing in the mountains on several occasions when he was here, but fortunately, Gu Ning was very detailed.\nZhong Xu followed Gu Ning’s example and made the same ring, he tried by putting his hand in and then pulling the vine, the knot instantly tightened and held his wrist firmly in place. Seeing that it worked, he made a few more with Gu Ning. When they were done, Zhong Xu was about to take the finished rings to set them up, yet Gu Ning held him back.\n“I’ll go.” Gu Ning said. Then she took all the rings from Zhong Xu’s hand, pressed her cap down to hide all her blonde hair, and then slowly sneaked her way out.\nHer footsteps were as light as a cat’s soft paws on the ground, without making a single sound as she crouched in the grass. She listened to the surroundings patiently for a while, making sure she heard nothing unusual before moving on. Agilely, she weaved through the trees, set down the traps, and was preparing to return.\nSuddenly a crisp bird call was heard ——\nGu Ning’s entire body stiffened, and without the slightest hesitation, she slowly retreated into a nearby thorny bush. However, the thorny bush was not dense enough and could easily be detected if she was approached. Gu Ning unleashed her psychic powers and the weeds she had just squashed immediately grew at an incredible speed visible to the naked eyes—— perfectly concealed Gu Ning’s whole body.\nThe bird’s call was made by Chen Gen, who could imitate the bird’s call so well that it was used to alert his companions without alerting the enemy in an emergency. The bird’s call was clearly a sign that Chen Gen had spotted the Five Stars Brigade’s trail.\nShe didn’t expect them to arrive so quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning hid in the bushes with her gun in her arms and couldn’t help but hold onto her breath. The Five Stars Brigade that had been so mysterious and left her curiosity hanging, was finally going to reveal their faces. Gu Ning couldn’t help but feel so excited in her heart. Excited as she was, the gun in her hand was carefully repositioned and she waited with bated breath for the group to come within her line of sight.\nFirst, the sound of light footsteps reached Gu Ning’s ears, the footsteps were so close and light that if Gu Ning didn’t have the amazing hearing, she would hardly have noticed them. It was only then that Gu Ning felt the tension coming.\nLooking out from Gu Ning’s line of sight, the first thing that came into view was a pair of slim slender legs wearing tight black trousers. Those legs were only less than five metres away from Gu Ning’s side, and she froze for a moment before gazing upward. When she saw the woman’s face, even the usually calm Gu Ning, couldn’t help but be in a daze at this time, and a name almost blurted out of her mouth.\nZhuang Chen? ! ! !\nLooking at the voluptuous woman with her red hair tied cleanly behind her head, with a special gun in her hand, Gu Ning almost bit her tongue. She had never thought that she would meet Zhuang Chen in this place and such a situation. Gu Ning could have never imagined that Zhuang Chen would be a member of the Five Stars Brigade!\nGu Ning swallowed with difficulty and managed to calm herself down. Glancing behind Zhuang Chen, she froze again, it was actually another acquaintance again! Although she hadn’t really dealt with the person before, Gu Ning was extremely impressed with this person. The person that was standing behind Zhuang Chen was none other than Yin Sang!\nAfter seeing Zhuang Chen and Yin Sang, one after another, even if the next one she saw was Bai Lang, Gu Ning wouldn’t be surprised. Gu Ning secretly muttered in her heart, and then she looked out again through the gap in the weeds in front of her. However, this time Gu Ning saw two men she didn’t know.\nWhile Zhuang Chen was about one point seven metres, these two men were both considerably taller than her.\nOne of the men in camouflage raised his hand, and the other three stopped in their tracks that were just right in front of Gu Ning’s pile of bushes. Gu Ning’s breath lifted as she quickly estimated whether she could eliminate all four of them at once if she took the advantage of their surprises. The result was of course no, the distance between the two sides was so close that she was only sure of eliminating one person.\nThe brim of that man’s cap was pressed so low that only the lower half of his face could be seen was his sharp jawline. The man’s perception was extremely keen and his sharp gaze suddenly shot in Gu Ning’s direction. At that moment he glanced over, Gu Ning had already turned her gaze away. The man quietly stared at the thorny bush where Gu Ning was hiding for a while, Gu Ning couldn’t help but hold her breath and the hairs on her body all stood up. That man’s gaze gave her a great sense of crisis! Her finger was ready on the trigger, the gaze stared silently in her direction for a while then it moved away again as if not noticing anything unusual.\nThe thorny bush where Gu Ning was hiding was like an enclosed space. If she had gone in from the front, the surrounding weeds would have been crushed. However, the pile of weeds in front of her was lush and vibrant with no sign of having been crushed by a person, which allowed Gu Ning to narrowly escape.\nGu Ning was secretly shocked in her mind, that man clearly sensed her gaze. He was so keen to this extent, no wonder the soldiers at the Third Company all mentioned the Five Stars Brigade with an indescribable look on their faces.\nShe heard the sound of the footsteps moving away, heading in the direction of Zhang XiaoBai and his men’s hideout. Gu Ning’s heart tightened slightly and she couldn’t help but worry about them.\nYet a male voice was heard saying: “That bird call was clearly a human imitation but they slipped away so quickly to god knows where.” He kicked the grass on the ground: “Pretty cunning, and knows how to make traps, just that it was a bit too easy to spot.”\nGu Ning heard Zhuang Chen let out a laugh and chimed in: “Who told our captain to set such rules, so of course, they would hide if they could. They are very familiar with this place as if it were their own home, but they are causing us to run all over the mountain.”\nHearing this, Gu Ning was slightly relieved. It seemed that they had shifted their position when they had scouted the trail of the Five Stars Brigade group.\nYin Sang was a little impatient: “Hurry up and finish them off so that we can go back to the hotel early.”\nZhuang Chen’s voice cooled down: “You insisted on following us from the capital, it’s not like anyone asked you to come with us.”\nYin Sang then stopped talking.\nThe man who gave Gu Ning a great sense of crisis remained silent and didn’t speak. Gu Ning estimated the distance between them, and although the distance was far enough, Gu Ning didn’t dare to make a move first for the sake of insurance.\nFinally, the four people had left.\nHowever, Gu Ning remained still for ten minutes to make sure they wouldn’t be returning before crawling out of the thorny bush. The back of her hands was cut with a few fine marks, yet she had no time to take care of it. After looking around warily and not finding any sign of Zhang XiaoBai and the others, she decided to hang out behind them from afar. It was better to keep track of their movements than to hide and not know when they would appear, and she could also help in the shadows if Zhang XiaoBai and his men were exposed.\nShe kicked the trap that her little cleverness had made on the ground and was slightly depressed when she remembered the man’s comment earlier. Then she followed them gingerly in the direction they had left with her gun in her hand.\nEver since she saw Zhuang Chen and Yin Sang, Gu Ning had not been able to relax but now her mood could be considered as heavy. As for Yin Sang, Gu Ning had seen with her own eyes how powerful she was, although she didn’t know how her marksmanship was, her close combat skills alone already made Gu Ning sigh in awe.\nThough she hadn’t seen Zhuang Chen in a fight, she subconsciously felt that Zhuang Chen’s skills must be very powerful. Moreover, from Yin Sang’s fear of Zhuang Chen just now, it seems that Zhuang Chen was even more formidable than Yin Sang. Not to mention a dangerous man whose gaze alone gave her a great sense of oppression and crisis and another figure whose depth she did not know.\nGu Ning had been confident in her strength due to the post-apocalyptic world, but she had not expected the strength of the Five Stars Brigade to have far exceeded her imagination.\nGu Ning was so lost in thought that she didn’t pay special attention to her feet and unknowingly stepped on an arching dead branch. When a subtle crack sounded under Gu Ning’s feet, she instantly exploded in sweat!\nThat tiny crack might not be noticeable to normal people, but to the specially trained Five Stars Brigade, even the softest sound would have been caught by them. There was barely a gap between Zhuang Chen’s pause and her turn, her red ponytail cutting a sharp arc in the air as she spun around, not even needing to aim, she raised her gun and fired!\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Woooaaa Zhuang Chen firing! Hehehe quick quick press the next chapter button for more fight scene! Love ya all!)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",

Thank you once again for your generous support! <3)\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning, however, reacted extremely quickly and didn’t take any chances that they wouldn’t notice the moment when the dead branch snapped. She dodged behind the nearest tree without hesitation. Although she had dodged well, Gu Ning was still shocked in cold sweat by the speed with which Zhuang Chen had turned and fired, and if she had hesitated, she would have been covered in smoke.\nZhuang Chen could only see a green shadow scurrying behind a tree, and even her three shots were dodged by that person. Both in terms of speed and reaction were good which made her raise her eyebrows: “What quick reflexes!”\n\n\n\nAs soon as Gu Ning had hidden behind the tree, she didn’t dare to delay in the slightest. She catapulted her body towards the other end at great speed without any hesitation.\nZhuang Chen continued to fire several shots at the fast-moving Gu Ning, yet Gu Ning was extremely agile in dodging left and right in the forest! It was as if there were eyes behind her back, even Zhuang Chen missed Gu Ning with several shots. The range of the special gun was limited, and the sensor wouldn’t work more than 50 metres away. Thus, after Gu Ning had fled around 100 metres away, she stopped hiding her tracks and revealed her body while continuing to dash away.\nHalf surprised and amused, Zhuang Chen lowered her gun: “Looks like there’s a good candidate this year.”\nThe man with his camouflage sleeves rolled up nodded and commented: “Good reflexes and speed… and a good judgement of danger.” After a pause, he added with a smile: “Quite bold too.” This was to say that Gu Ning had actually dared to tail behind them.\nInstead, Zhuang Chen asked the other man who had not been commenting: “Captain, what do you think?”\nThe man glanced at the place where Gu Ning had just exposed her tracks and replied: “Her concealment skill is not up to par.”\nThe other man explained: “JiuZe, you’re expecting standards for us from the newcomers. This is the first time you’re personally selecting a newcomer, so you probably don’t know that it’s already very impressive for a newcomer to reach such a level. The one just now was an upper class in terms of both reaction speed and judgement, there aren’t many people who can dodge Zhuang Chen’s shooting speed.”\nZhuang Chen hummed and agreed: “That shot just now, even Yin Sang couldn’t dodge it.”\nYin Sang frowned fiercely but didn’t retort.\nGu Ning didn’t know what they were saying about her and ran furiously for a long distance while making sure that they weren’t following her before she gradually slowed her pace. A few dozen metres further, one could see the iron fence that serves as a border barrier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning lifted her wrist to check her watch, there were still two hours left on the clock. Gu Ning had never felt that time had passed so slowly before. Right now, she had gotten out of danger and could only pray that Zhang XiaoBai and the other two would be lucky enough, not to run into the Five Stars Brigade head-on.\nJi JiuZe was the first to notice that Yin Sang went missing.\nZhuang Chen frowned and said: “I knew bringing her here would be a problem. Must have gone back to look for that person just now.”\nThe other man said impatiently: “Ignore her. Let’s just go find the other three.”\nAs Zhuang Chen had expected, Yin Sang was running rapidly through the forest with a special gun on her back. She stopped from time to time to crouch down, checked the traces on the ground to determine the direction in which Gu Ning had fled, and then continued to chase after her.\nAs for Zhuang Chen’s comment about Gu Ning, it was simply a provocation to Yin Sang. Especially saying that she couldn’t even dodge that shot while that person managed to dodge it, so she would finish that person off and see what Zhuang Chen had to say.\nGu Ning thought that she was out of the danger zone for the time being and decided to take a detour to intercept Zhang XiaoBai before they met the Five Stars Brigade. Little did she know that Yin Sang had left the group without permission and was chasing after her trail.\nYin Sang followed Gu Ning’s trail all the way to a tree and lost sight of her. She crouched down and carefully surveyed the traces around her. Her expression gradually became grim, that person couldn’t have disappeared into thin air, eh? What’s that in the grass under the tree…… a gun?!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYin Sang was alarmed and she quickly jerked her head up! Right in front of her eyes was an enlarging green shadow falling from the sky towards her! Yin Sang was caught off guard and had no time to dodge. This caused her to be instantly thrown to the ground.\nThe person rolled twice on the ground with her in her arms, then pinned her down and reached for the gun in her hand without hesitation! Yin Sang’s gaze went slightly cold, then one of her legs broke free from the tangle and kicked directly towards the person who was holding her down! The kick landed heavily on that person’s waist! She used seventy percent of her strength in this kick, and the opponent grunted but was not sent flying off by her kick. The grip on her wrist remained deadly clasped.\nAfter Gu Ning sensed that someone was following her, she hid her heavy special gun away in the bushes under the tree due to time constraints and then climbed quickly up the tree. When she had just climbed to the top of the tree, she saw someone coming from afar, and it was actually Yin Sang! She had seen Yin Sang’s skills, and she knew that she was definitely no match for her in a solo fight. Thus, she had wanted to wait for her to leave before she descended from the tree. Yet, unluckily, Yin Sang had found her gun which she had hidden under the tree, therefore, forced her to show herself.\nShe was kicked heavily on her waist and the force was extremely strong. Gu Ning felt a sharp pain drilling into her, originally, she was going to hold back her strength, with the thought that there was no need to hurt the other party.\nHowever, she didn’t expect that Yin Sang wouldn’t hold back her strength in the slightest with that kick. Stirred by the pain, Gu Ning was pissed. She no longer had any intention of holding back her strength since Yin Sang had started it, she would follow too. Her grip, which had only exerted around fifty percent of her strength, suddenly unleashed her full strength and clutched tightly!\nYin Sang instantly felt as if her wrist was being clamped by an iron pincer, and the huge force that came from the iron pincer was as if they were trying to break her wrist! When Gu Ning felt that Yin Sang’s hands went weak, she was instantly delighted and snatched the gun out of her grips. Once the gun left Yin Sang’s hand, she was horrified and immediately swung her long legs! Bringing up a heck of wind, another kick sent the gun that Gu Ning had just snatched into the air! It flew and landed in the grass patch that was three metres away with a thud!\nGu Ning couldn’t be bothered in pinning her and hurriedly got up to retrieve the gun she had hidden under a tree, trying to seize this rare opportunity to take Yin Sang down with shots.\nHowever, Yin Sang moved even faster than Gu Ning! She quickly rose from the ground, crouched down, and aimed a sweeping kick at Gu Ning’s calf! Gu Ning failed to dodge and was stuck hard on her calf as if by an iron bar! With a sharp pain, she fell to the ground with a loud thud.\nSeeing Yin Sang was running towards the gun that was three metres away, Gu Ning couldn’t care less, stood up in pain, and directly sprang at Yin Sang! She fell heavily to the ground but her hands managed to tug on Yin Sang’s calf! With a low growl, she yanked Yin Sang straight down!\nYin Sang fell heavily to the ground, her chin knocked hard into the mud. The mountain’s mud was so hard and with her chin slammed into it, a sharp pain shot up. What hurts the most was the indescribable pain of her biting the tip of her tongue and a bloody smell spread in her mouth. The anger in Yin Sang’s heart rose to its peak and she had the urge to kill! A murderous aura filled her eyes! With her hands on the ground, she flipped onto her back! The person who was holding her legs was also forced by her strength and flipped over!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHer legs jerked away from the slightly loosen hands, and then she stomped with a vengeance! Both feet stomped hard on the person’s shoulders! It could be said that she used her full strength! It was so full of hate that she didn’t hold back at all!\nGu Ning only felt a huge blow hit her shoulder and then her entire body was kicked and skidded against the ground! The huge force sent her skidding two metres away! Her face was facing the floor, she didn’t have time to tilt her face up, and was cut by the debris and mud on the ground. With a stinging pain, she didn’t know if she had disfigured her face, her palms were also badly scratched from the ground and were in hot burning pain!\nGu Ning was sure that Yin Sang had struck her with a deadly blow! The pain coming from different parts of her body completely aroused Gu Ning’s ruthlessness!\nPreviously, she had thought about trying not to break the peace for the sake of their future relationship but right now, she had only one thought in her mind, f*ck your peace! I’m going to screw you!\nGu Ning let out a loud angry yell and got up from the ground, then leaped towards Yin Sang who had also just gotten up from the floor!\nThis angry cry caused Yin Sang to freeze for a moment, and the thought that came to her mind was ‘A female’?!\nIt was during this daze that Gu Ning pounced onto Yin Sang again!\nYin Sang was furious at Gu Ning who was simply pestering her like a sticky toffee and grabbed Gu Ning’s clothes with her backhand. She dived down and tried to fling Gu Ning off her back! However, Gu Ning’s legs clamped down on Yin Sang’s slender waist tightly, and her arms were wrapped around Yin Sang’s neck! She had tangled herself around Yin Sang’s entire body.\nInstead of throwing Gu Ning off, Yin Sang was strangled by Gu Ning and suffocated for a while. She hurriedly straightened up and fell backward, slamming Gu Ning straight down to the ground! Gu Ning’s back smashed heavily on the ground, almost hearing the sound of her spine cracking, but she gritted her teeth and refused to let go. Meanwhile, she released one of her hands that were strangling Yin Sang, quickly wrapped it around Yin Sang’s ponytail, and tugged onto it tightly.\nAt this moment, Gu Ning had completely forgotten the fact that she couldn’t beat Yin Sang. She was so enraged that she wanted to let it all out, and no matter how hard Yin Sang tried to shake her off, she just refused to let go. Gu Ning had made up her mind to annoy her to the max since she had pissed her off.\nYin Sang was indeed very annoyed at this moment, she could have never imagined that she would actually meet with such unexpected failure and suffer so much from a woman! ! ! She was so furious that she was going crazy!\nHowever, no matter how she tried, she just couldn’t shake Gu Ning off her.\nYin Sang was so outraged that she was almost gritting her teeth “Let go!”\nGu Ning only spouted two words: “No way!”\nThe two of them remained frozen in that position for an unknown amount of time. It was so long that Yin Sang’s body began to ache all over. Of course, if she had known what was going to happen next, she would have preferred to stay in this position for a little while longer——\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Zhuang Chen, Yi ShaoQing, and Ji JiuZe came around from behind a large tree, they were all being completely shocked by the scene in front of them till the point of being speechless.\nThis was probably the most disastrous look they had ever seen Yin Sang to be in. She was held from behind by a person, a pair of legs clasped around her waist like a giant pincer, an arm was strangled her neck and her black ponytail was tugged firmly on that person’s hand. Yin Sang had mud on her chin and blood stained the corners of her mouth while her expression was unspeakably grimy——\nYi ShaoQing’s mouth was gaped wide open, unable to believe what his eyes were seeing.\nZhuang Chen was also stunned.\nJi JiuZe’s face was still expressionless, but a trace of astonishment flashed in his eyes.\nZhang XiaoBai, Chen Gen, and Zhong Xu, who was following behind the Five Stars Brigade group were all shocked and dumbfounded.\nThen everyone’s gaze drifted silently away from the scene.\nGu Ning’s cap had long been thrown away, and her blonde hair was covered in countless grass and debris, clinging to her head like a huge mess. Her two cheeks had been scratched and bleeding while mixed with mud and sand, which made her look very wretched. Yet, this miserable face suddenly opened her mouth to reveal a mouthful of white teeth at that moment, while stating with endless pleasure: “I’ve won!”\n…….\nJi JiuZe was silent for a long time, and then placed the walkie-talkie to his mouth: “There are wounded up here, send two stretchers over.” Then he stopped looking at the two who were still tangled up together and proceeded to descend the mountain.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Woooots! Gu Ning won! although she had suffered injuries. Well~ unexpected match with Yin Sang. Thank you all for reading and hope you all like it. )\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "77": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-77/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Gu Ning had confirmed that she had survived the three hours limit, she tried to let go of Yin Sang. Yet, she found that her limbs had stiffened and she couldn’t get off Yin Sang’s body.\nYin Sang saw Zhuang Chen’s looks of dismay and laughter which seemed like she was gloating at her in her mind. She would have screamed if she was the only one here! Never in her wildest dream had she imagined that she would have such a wretched day, and in such a pathetic posture to be witnessed by Zhuang Chen! If she could, she would like to kill everyone here who saw her in this mess and the first person she would target would be the woman on her back right now! ! !\n\n\n\nAt this moment, she heard the woman who was straddling her back say: “Excuse me, please do me a favour, I can’t move.”\nOnly then did Zhuang Chen and the others wake up from a dream, and they all hurriedly came forward to help free Gu Ning from Yin Sang’s body.\nGu Ning felt that her body no longer belonged to her, but the pain coming from all parts of her body was unmistakable.\nThose who came up with the stretcher were the three company commanders, in addition to Ji JiuZe who had gone to lead the way to their location.\nYin Sang was being helped by Yi ShaoQing to stand up, but her face was very ghastly pale. Gu Ning, however, was still lying on the ground with no strength left. Although she had made Yin Sang look so wretched, her injuries were way more serious than her.\nThe stretcher had been prepared on standby at the foot of the mountain. Brother San had thought that someone might get injured but he didn’t expect the battle to be so fierce. He could accept the fact that Gu Ning was in a mess, but the girl from the Five Stars Brigade didn’t look much better than her…… The three company commanders glanced at each other, all of them were a little impatient to know what was going on. However, when they saw the Five Stars Brigade girl’s pale yet grimly face that seem to be ready to go on a murderous rampage, they all tacitly kept their mouths shut.\nGu Ning and Yin Sang were both carefully carried onto the stretcher. The military doctor was a man in his thirties and carrying a medical kit. First, he checked on the wound in Yin Sang’s mouth and saw that it was only a bump on the tongue before he went to treat the wound on Gu Ning’s face. The cut on her face was not deep, but it was mixed with a lot of mud and sand that made it look a bit terrifying.\nThe middle-aged doctor jokingly said: “Little girl, you might be disfigured eh.”\nGu Ning only smiled, looking unconcerned about it.\nThe middle-aged doctor didn’t get the response he wanted so he quietly continued treating her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhile he was cleaning Gu Ning’s wounds, Zhang XiaoBai and the others watched from the side and kept inhaling as if the pain was on their faces. They kept calling out for the doctor to be more careful and gentle. Gu Ning just frowned slightly at the discomfort. Zhuang Chen, on the other hand, was very curious about Gu Ning and crouched beside her.\nGu Ning was acquainted with Zhuang Chen, yet Zhuang Che didn’t know her. This was just like when she met Fang Fa. Gu Ning felt that it was amazing and couldn’t help but smile at the thought.\nIn Yi ShaoQing’s mind, he was horrified and muttered: “That’s it, there’s going to be another crazy woman in the team.”\nHowever, Zhuang Chen seemed very happy and asked Gu Ning: “What are you smiling at?”\nJi JiuZe also glanced over.\nGu Ning smiled and explained: “You look like a friend whom I know.”\nYi ShaoQing let out a chuckle as if he was laughing at Gu Ning’s old-fashioned pickup lines: “You’ve already passed the test, there’s no need to get close to her.”\nGu Ning just laughed it off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYin Sang’s stretcher was carried by two paramedics.\nGu Ning’s stretcher was carried by Zhong Xu and Chen Gen, who were about the same height.\nZhang XiaoBai lowered his voice and couldn’t help but whisper to Gu Ning on the stretcher: “Gu Ning, you’re so awesome!”\nGu Ning’s lip curled slightly into a smile before asking: “How did you guys fair?”\nThe excitement on Zhang XiaoBai’s face was instantly quenched: “Let’s talk about it after we’ve descended the mountain.”\nSeeing the change in expression, Gu Ning’s heart sank.\nThe stretcher rattled, Gu Ning was feeling a little sore from her injuries, her healing powers had automatically started to heal her body. She hadn’t slept in a long time and previously she would still feel energetic even if she didn’t sleep for a few days. Yet, at this moment, she managed to fall asleep on the staggering stretcher.\nIn the room specially vacated for the Five Stars brigade, Zhuang Chen immediately voiced her opinion as soon as she sat down: “I don’t care about the others, this Gu Ning must be mine.”\nYi ShaoQing replied: “I’ve read Gu Ning’s profile, the reason she applied for the Five Stars Brigade was that she wanted to learn close combat. Zhuang Chen, your close combat skill is still a little bit weaker……” He paused and glanced wistfully at Ji JiuZe: “Hey JiuZe, your close combat skill is the strongest in the brigade, would you be interested in teaching a disciple?”\n“Come on.” Chuang Chen interjected: “When have you ever seen him teach someone before?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Leave it to me.” Yin Sang, who was nestled on the sofa and hadn’t spoken for a while, suddenly voiced out: “I see that she has very good potential.”\nYin ShaoQing silently complained in his mind, she should at least control the expression on her face when she says those words. Currently, her expression was like she wanted to murder someone on the spot.\nYi ShaoQing only dared to complain in his mind, but Zhuang Chen rebutted directly: “Leave it to you? To let you destroy her?”\nJi JiuZe glanced at Yin Sang and pondered for a long time before stating: “Let’s discuss this matter when we are back in the capital. What do you guys think about the other three candidates?”\nYi ShaoQing contemplated for a moment and answered: “Apart from Gu Ning, that Zhang XiaoBai had the best potential, and to have such skills after a year in the army is very good. Other than him, Chen Gen’s performance is not too impressive, but he’s very calm and has a lot of drive when it matters. This is a rare thing, especially as there’s a shortage of these types of newcomers these days. The last man, Zhong Xu, is a little bit less satisfactory in comparison.”\n“Is this your revenge?” Zhuang Chen sneered: “It’s quite depressing to be hit by a stick, isn’t it?”\nYi ShaoQing blew up: “How can it be! Am I such a person?!”\nOn the other side, Zhang XiaoBai and the rest were all guarding the infirmary. They were all relieved after hearing the doctor announce that there was nothing wrong, and she would be fine after resting. Recalling the scene that they had seen, they were still a bit incredulous.\nIn contrast to Gu Ning’s “toughness”, they were tricked around like monkeys by the Five Stars Brigade members. In the end, they didn’t last till the three hour limit, so they were probably a lost cause.\nGu Ning didn’t wake up until around 5 pm or so. When the doctor saw that she had woken up, he dialled a call and informed the Third Company.\nIt wasn’t long before Brother San arrived.\n“The results are out.” Brother San said to Gu Ning: “There’s one good news and one bad news, which one do you want to hear first?”\nGu Ning held back from rolling her eyes and replied while putting on her shoes: “The bad news.”\nBrother San’s expression suddenly froze: “The bad news is that all four of you are not selected.”\nGu Ning was startled and jerked her body up to look at Brother San in disbelief: “How is that possible?!” She paused and then asked: “What about the good news?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San’s expression remained stony: “The good news is……” He paused, then his expression changed: “I’ve lied!”\nGu Ning was stunned. Before she could react, Zhang XiaoBai and the rest pushed open the door. They were holding all kinds of party poppers in their hands, which popped several times while countless colourful confetti burst out.\nThe doctor was startled at first, then shouted in exasperation: “Wait a minute, all of you don’t run away! Help me sweep this place!”\nAll the soldiers ignored him and they all flocked to Gu Ning’s side to congratulate her.\nZhong Xu’s face was red with excitement: “Gu Ning! The Five Stars Brigade has just come to inform us that all four of us have been selected!”\nChen Gen, who was always expressionless, had a smile on his face this time, and Zhang XiaoBai was even grinning like crazy.\nGu Ning was also surprised, but before she could reprimand them for the prank, she was dumbfounded by the result. Her heart that had been hanging was instantly returned to its original position and a smile unknowingly spread across her face.\nThat same night, Brother San was like being all fired up, brought out his bank card, and arranged five military trucks to bring all of them to the seafood restaurant near the city centre that Zhang XiaoBai had been talking about.\nThe Five Stars Brigades group had politely declined at first, but the generosity was unbearable, so they were forced by the soldiers and followed them except for Yin Sang who said that she had seafood allergies.\nZhang XiaoBai had booked the tables a long time ago.\nToday wasn’t a holiday so there weren’t particularly too many people. Thus, when they had arrived, there were still some sparse tables left while half of the venue was taken up by them.\nThe soldiers had all changed into civilian clothes to reduce the attention being drawn to them. However, the straightened posture of the soldiers was still a sight to behold as they walked in line when they entered.\n“Cheese-baked lobster, make it three kilograms per table. Then this turbot fish dish, one per table. This oriental shrimp, two kilograms for each table, and this eight treasure duck, we will have the large serving…..”Zhang XiaoBai continued naming out and ordering all the dishes, which made Brother San who sat on the same table turn pale. The three of the Five Stars Brigade members were sitting with them so he couldn’t show his irritation.\nWhen he heard Zhang XiaoBai ordering the fourteenth dish, he no longer cared about his reputation and straight away snatched the menu from Zhang XiaoBai. He returned the menu to the waiter and said:  “Hey hey hey! Alright, that’s all! Let’s start with these, we will order more if we don’t have enough. Go tell your kitchen to hurry up and serve those dishes.” After saying these, he hastily waved away to the waiter who was taking orders. Then he explained to the Five Stars Brigade members shamelessly: “Now that the country is calling for frugality and resolutely eliminating wastefulness, we have to take the initiative and lead a good example.”\nThe dishes were served one after another, and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Driven by Zhang XiaoBai and a few partygoers, there was a lively exchange of glasses. The soldiers were happily eating and enjoying themselves as it was very rare for them to have a grand seafood meal like this.\nIt was in the midst of this joyful atmosphere.\nA surprised voice suddenly rang out: “Gu Ning?!”\nThe rest of the soldiers at the other tables didn’t hear it because of the noise in the hall, but everyone at Gu Ning’s table heard the calling.\nThey all glanced over in unison.\nGu Ning was sitting sideways near the aisle. When she heard the voice, she gave a slight pause before glancing over.\nFirst, she saw a more surprised Jiang Yu than Lu JiaZi, who was standing in the aisle in shock.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Well this is the chapter for today update. Tada 3 chapters! Thanks to Pang V. hehehe.\nHurray to Gu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu and Chen Gen for passing the selection! woooots!\nAlso, here is the picture of those dishes. ? and Brother San is just too funny and shameless. ?\nThank you all for reading.

Her eyes lingered a little longer on Ji JiuZe’s face. Even among the men at the table, Ji JiuZe stood out from the rest, both in terms of his cool appearance and his temperament, which made Jiang Yu take a double look at him.\n“You guys eat first, I’ll head out for a bit.” Gu Ning nodded to the people at her table and informed them before getting up and told Jiang Yu and Lu JiaZi: “Let’s talk outside.”\n\n\n\nWhen Gu Ning led Jiang Yu and Lu JiaZi out of the hall, the expressions of those who remained at the table were a little subtle. Although Gu Ning had just controlled her expression, that instant coldness was very obvious.\nGu Ning, Jiang Yu, and Lu JiaZi made their way out to the lobby after exiting the hall.\nJiang Yu feigned with some anger: “Gu Ning, what’s wrong with you, you didn’t even contact me when you returned.”\nLu JiaZi was more concerned about the injury on Gu Ning’s face as he frowned and asked: “How did you injure your face? How did you get into such a state?”\n“I just fell.” Gu Ning briefly stated.\nLu JiaZi continued: “Auntie said that you’ve started tutoring.” What he meant was that Gu Ning should be tutoring now and not dining here with a group of people that he had never seen before.\n“It’s a day off.” Gu Ning remained cold in manner when answering: “It seems that you two should still have things to do, then I will head back in first.”\n“Wait a minute.” Lu JiaZi called out to Gu Ning. Then he said to Jiang Yu: “Jiang Yu, you leave first, I have a few words to talk to Gu Ning.”\nJiang Yu furrowed faintly and unnoticeably before agreeing: “Hmm, okay.” Then she said to Gu Ning before leaving: “Don’t forget to come over to my house for dinner on Sunday. I’ll leave first then.”\nLu JiaZi explained to Gu Ning: “Jiang Yu introduced a new client to me and we just had dinner over here. Don’t think too much about it.” He stretched out to touch Gu Ning’s face: “Why did you fall so badly, does it hurt?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning took a step back, avoiding Lu JiaZi’s hand that was reaching out for her face: “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go in first.”\n“Who are those people?” Lu JiaZi finally couldn’t resist asking.\n“My friends. It’s not like I have to report to you for making friends, right?” Gu Ning turned around, walked back to the hall after she finished speaking as she had run out of patience.\nLu JiaZi frowned as he watched Gu Ning disappear behind the door, but he couldn’t help and thought back about the past when Gu Ning used to even tell him what she had eaten for lunch…… This feeling right now made him very uncomfortable. Seeing that Jiang Yu was still waiting outside, his frown tightened.\nWhen Jiang Yu saw Lu JiaZi walking out, a smile appeared on her face while she strolled over on her high heels: “Let’s go.”\nLu JiaZi stopped in his tracks and suddenly changed his mind: “I have some sudden matters that I need to take care of, so I won’t be sending you back.”\nThe smile on Jiang Yu’s face paused faintly before she replied with a small grin: “That’s okay. I’ll be fine on my own.”\n“Sorry.” Lu JiaZi smiled apologetically before sending Jiang Yu into a taxi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHe glanced back again before turning around and walking towards the car park.\nAfter being seated in his car, his phone rang. He glanced at it and it was a message from Jiang Yu.\n“Don’t forget to treat me to dinner after the business deal is done.” A very cute emoji was added at the end.\nLu JiaZi stared at the message for about ten seconds before replying to it: “Sure, no problem.”\nJiang Yu in the taxi stared at her phone until she saw Lu JiaZi’s message come through. A satisfied smile spread across her face but when she thought of Lu JiaZi staying behind to chat with Gu Ning, her smile faded slightly.\nGu Ning returned to her seat, and apart from giving a salute, everything else went on as normal.\nWhen Brother San was checking out at the cashier, his heart was bleeding as this meal had cost him over 20,000 yuan. Every single digit he entered for the pin code of his card was like poking his finger on the tip of a knife.\nThe whole journey back, Brother San was doing psychological comfort of his own. With Gu Ning plus the other two in his team, he would receive the 300,000 yuan bonus, this helped to heal the bleeding heart a lot. Upholding the principle of never wasting anything, that leftover food was packed up for late-night supper.\nGu Ning took the time to go to the washroom and called Mother Gu, informing her that she had the day off while mentioning briefly that she had been out to dinner with friends and met Lu JiaZi with Jiang Yu.\nMother Gu was very happy that Gu Ning was willing to go out for dinner with her friends, but she was a little surprised to hear that Lu JiaZi was with Jiang Yu. In her opinion, these two should not have gotten along at all. She even asked sensitively if the two of them were in a relationship?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning only answered that she didn’t know and hung up after chatting a bit more. The main reason she called was to prevent Jiang Yu or Lu JiaZi from mentioning this to her parents. What Gu Ning was doing now was to give a head up to Mother Gu and prevent any trouble from brewing.\nLu JiaZi was still a little distracted when he had returned home. Lu Mama noticed and asked him yet he just brushed it off as a work-related matter.\nLu Mama also whined that Gu Ning had promised that she would come over for dinner yet failed to do so these days: “Did you two fight? Last time at the hospital, I noticed that Gu Ning was treating you a little differently.”\nWithout thinking, Lu JiaZi answered: “Nope.” After a pause, he sighed and glanced at Lu Mama helplessly and continued: “We didn’t quarrel but it seems that Gu Ning is angry with me.”\nLu Mama couldn’t help but complain: “Gu Ning is so good-tempered, don’t always bully her all the time. Sometimes you have to coax her and don’t wait for her to make up with you every time. Gu Ning is slowly getting older, her thinking is naturally more mature. Do you think that she will still be the little girl in the past when you just wave at her and she will come over instantly?”\nLu Mama looked like an experienced person who had gone through the situation: “Also look, that day at the hospital, I think that the relationship between that young man and Gu Ning was certainly not that simple. To accompany her to the hospital, that relationship was not ordinary.”\nLu Mama continued with a heartfelt manner: “I’m a woman too and when women say they like you, they really like you a lot. However, when they said they don’t like you, they really don’t like you anymore. Sometimes women are even more heartless than men. You shouldn’t rely on her liking and don’t take her seriously. If she really doesn’t like you anymore, then it will be too late for you to do anything about it. Anyway, I’ve watched Gu Ning grow up and your father even treated Gu Ning as his daughter. If you don’t like her then don’t delay them. She is already twenty-three this year, and for you, she didn’t accept anyone for so many years, so…….”\nLu JiaZi listened to Mother Lu’s words and frowned more tightly. After thinking back, the several meetings with Gu Ning ended up unhappy, as well as Gu Ning’s attitude towards him after she had returned was always so distant and cold…… He was inexplicably annoyed, even though Lu Mama was trying to impart her love lessons to him. He simply got up and went back into his room. In the end, after a few considerations, he took out his phone and dialed Gu Ning’s home number.\nThe phone was picked up after a few rings.\nMother Gu’s voice came from the other end of the phone; “Hello? Who is it?” She also informed Father Gu to lower the TV volume a little.\nLu JiaZi replied: “Auntie, it’s me, JiaZi.”\n“Eh?! JiaZi? Why are you calling us, is there something wrong?” Mother Gu asked while gesturing to Father Gu who was sitting on the sofa.\nLu JiaZi answered: “It’s nothing. Just that I haven’t seen you for a long time so I’ve wanted to call and check how you are doing.”\nMother Gu replied: “Oh, yes, we are fine. Thank you for thinking about us. Oh yeah, NingNing called just now and told me that she saw you.”\nLu JiaZi’s spirit lifted and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but rise slightly: “Really?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMother Gu asked tentatively: “Yes. She said that you’re with Jiang Yu. JiaZi, are you dating Jiang Yu?”\nLu JiaZi immediately rejected: “No, auntie. Jiang Yu just introduced me to a new client and we went for a meal together. Please don’t misunderstand us.”\n“Aiya, it’s alright. It’s none of our business if you youngsters fall in love. If you are dating Jiang Yu, I, as your aunt, will be happy for you two.” Mother Gu replied.\nLu JiaZi repeatedly emphasized that he was not in a relationship with Jiang Yu before hanging up the phone.\nLu JiaZi felt very bad after hanging up the phone. The changes in Mother Gu’s attitude towards him were too obvious. She clearly knew that Gu Ning liked him, so how could she possibly set him up in a relationship with Jiang Yu?! Unless it was Gu Ning’s attitude towards him had obviously changed and also revealed it to Mother Gu…… Lu JiaZi held the phone and sat on the sofa, and his heart suddenly felt empty. It was like he wanted to grasp onto something but he was helpless about it.\nWhen they were on the way returning, Zhuang Chen sat specifically near Gu Ning and introduced with excitement: “Gu Ning, it seems we haven’t officially met yet. My name is Zhuang Chen.”\nWhen Gu Ning saw Zhuang Chen introducing herself, she inevitably thought of how she seemed to have introduced herself the same way in the post-apocalyptic world. The depressed mood brought on by Lu JiaZi and Jiang Yu just now was instantly swept away, and she couldn’t help but smile: “Hello, my name is Gu Ning.”\nAfter staring at Gu Ning for a while, Zhuang Chen suddenly stated: “I don’t know why, but I always feel that you like me especially.”\nYi ShaoQing, who was sitting near them, couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said somewhat unbearably: “Zhuang Chen, this is the first time I’ve known you to be so narcissistic.”\nWhen Zhuang Chen gestured a fist, Yi ShaoQing immediately kept quiet.\n“Let me tell you, I may not be the best in close combat but I know how to use all types of guns. I can even use rocket launchers and stuff, do you want to learn and try? Or do you want to learn how to drive a tank? Or a helicopter or something like that? I can teach you all those.”Zhuang Chen was trying to sell herself to Gu Ning with great enthusiasm.\nHearing this, Yi ShaoQing rolled his eyes again but didn’t dare to voice it out as his fighting power was not a match for Zhuang Chen at all.\nIt was a bit envying for Zhong Xu, Zhang XiaoBai, and Chen Gen to hear this self-promoting. They were sighing that Gu Ning was so extraordinary that even those proud and arrogant Five Stars Brigade team wanted her so badly. However, they were sobbing in their heart that no one asked and was concerned about them.\nJi JiuZe sat against the corner, closing his eyes while listening to Zhuang Chen’s non-stop self-promotion and Gu Ning’s occasional reply.\nWhen getting off the truck, Yi ShaoQing dawdled at the end near Gu Ning and mysteriously lowered his voice and whispered: “Gu Ning, I have to remind you kindly. If you really want to learn the best close combat skill, our captain is the most powerful of all.” After saying this, he raised his chin and gestured at Ji JiuZe who had already gotten out of the truck then he alighted too.\nAfter bidding goodbye to the Five Stars Brigade team, Brother San, Gu Ning, and the others joked and laughed as they headed back to their dormitory.\nBefore the Five Stars Brigade split up with Gu Ning, Yi ShaoQing didn’t forget to wink at Gu Ning.\nGu Ning went back to her room in the family building alone. Laying on her bed and thinking about the Five Stars Brigade’s captain Ji JiuZe. He was about thirty years old and looked very serious. He didn’t even smile nor showed any interest in her in the slightest. If it was true that Ji JiuZe was the best in close combat as Yi ShaoQing had claimed, then what would she need to do to convince him to teach her?\nGu Ning thought about it all night, yet she couldn’t come up with any solution.\nThe next day after breakfast, she found an opportunity to chat with Yi ShaoQing alone.\nGu Ning got straight to the point: “What do I have to do to get him to teach me?”\n“Hehehe.” Yi ShaoQing chuckled before answering: “To deal with someone like Ji JiuZe, there’s just one word. And that word is pester. If you pester him a hundred times a day, maybe he’ll agree to your request.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ahahaha Zhuang Chen is so cute <3 Slightly short chapter for today.

    "79": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-79/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter listening to Yi ShaoQing’s suggestion, Gu Ning was very troubled.\nWith the so-called art of pestering.\n\n\n\nBefore the apocalypse happened, she used this method on Lu JiaZi. In the past, when Lu JiaZi had not yet moved away, Gu Ning used to visit his home every day. Later on, when he had moved, she would still visit him there at least once a week. As compared to her past self, she used to be a spoiled and pestering little girl.\nAfter the apocalypse happened, Gu Ning grew up at a very fast pace. When she had discovered Lu JiaZi’s relationship with Jiang Yu, she even put on a strong front while her personality became colder each day that making jokes was eventually a rare sight of her.\nIt had only been three months since then.\nGu Ning had a spoon in her hand and glanced at Ji JiuZe who was strolling over with a tray of food while her gaze was a little lax.\nJi JiuZe was expressionless as he walked, his figure was slender and his posture was straight like a pine tree with an exquisite aura around him. Being a new face and member of the Five Stars Brigade, all the soldiers knew about them which made him stand out from the crowd even more. With a tray of food in his hand, he sat down straight away next to Yi ShaoQing, which was directly opposite of Gu Ning, and gave her a slight nod as a greeting before he started eating.\nGu Ning feigned her unconcern but in fact, she was carefully observing him between each inadvertent glance.\nHis expressionless face was somewhat cold, even the sharpness of his eyebrows and eyes gave a vague sense of aggression. When he was eating, he sat up straight, and his action of using a chopstick to pick up the tofu on his plate and into his mouth was so righteous. It gave people a meticulous feeling unlike Yi ShaoQing’s playfulness or Zhuang Chen’s casualness. Since Yin Sang didn’t come to the cafeteria to eat, Gu Ning had no way to compare her to him. Yet such righteousness didn’t seem like a stereotype in the least and it was like the baseline that contributed to his demeanour.\nPerhaps Ji JiuZe’s aura was too powerful, except for Zhuang Chen and Yi ShaoQing who were talking and laughing, Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and Chen Gen who were at the same table didn’t dare to speak much as they just buried their heads and ate.\nWith this kind of person, who needs courage to even speak to, how could she use the art of pestering him?\nLooking at his upright posture, if she spoke at this moment, she might even be reprimanded by him for speaking while eating. Gu Ning thought of this and couldn’t help but hesitate a little. If she really learned close combat from him, would he be infuriated at every turn? On second thought, if he was really as good as Yi ShaoQing had claimed, even if she had to suffer, it would still be worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYi ShaoQing bit on his spoon while glancing at the expressionless Ji JiuZe for a moment then at the same blank-faced Gu Ning, he couldn’t help but mutter in his heart.\nAfter eating, they all left the canteen together.\nYi ShaoQing suddenly asked Gu Ning: “Gu Ning, yesterday didn’t you tell me that you had something to say to our captain? Then we’ll leave first, you can join us later after you’ve talked to Captain.”\nGu Ning was caught off guard by his words and stared at him stunned. Yi ShaoQing blinked furiously at her a few times before dragging Zhuang Chen away. Zhang XiaoBai and the others were not sure what to do and just gave Gu Ning a strange look before following Yi ShaoQing too.\nJi JiuZe, however, stopped and peered down at Gu Ning: “You have something to tell me?”\nGu Ning felt nervous for no reason, but she only panicked for a moment before she calmed down: “I heard from Yi ShaoQing that you are the best in close combat, so I want to ask you if you can teach me after I’ve entered the Five Stars Brigade?”\nJi JiuZe already seemed to know what Gu Ning was going to ask, so he refused almost without thinking: “Nope.”\nGu Ning was prepared for rejection, but she didn’t expect it to be such a concise and sharp rejection without any explanation. Yet she wasn’t overly surprised and her expression was calm as she had accepted it frankly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, Gu Ning was slightly disappointed but she had long expected that the path of getting him to teach her would not be so smooth. Since there would be many opportunities later, it meant that she would also have many chances to get Ji JiuZe to change his current mind.\nThe next step was the troop handover. Gu Ning was not a soldier, so she didn’t need to do any handover at all. Thus she just went back to her room in the little white building and packed her things briefly. Zhuang Chen even drove the car to pick her up downstairs. Her fondness for Zhuang Chen came from her knowledge of her in the post-apocalyptic world but Zhuang Chen’s passionate affection towards Gu Ning left her feeling a little baffled.\nShe was not aware of the feud between Zhuang Chen and Yin Sang at this time, so naturally, she didn’t know that most of Zhuang Chen’s affections towards her stemmed from the fact that she had made such a mess of Yin Sang.\nAlong with Gu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu and Chen Gen all packed their bags and boarded the Five Stars Brigade’s special car.\nJi JiuZe was driving the red off-road vehicle and Gu Ning felt a little deja-vu when she got back into the car once again. Yet no one could share this feeling with her and when she thought about this, she suddenly felt a little lonely.\nJi JiuZe was lost in thoughts after glancing at Gu Ning in the mirror as she looked out of the window.\nThe car drove for nearly two hours before arriving.\nGu Ning stepped down from the car and could hardly hide her surprise, it was hard to imagine that the Jinyong branch of the Five Stars Brigade would be in such a place.\nIt was a large double-story detached villa, occupying an extremely large area and there weren’t any other houses in the surroundings. There was a three-metre-high fence enclosing the whole villa, and an exaggeratedly large front yard after the metal gates, all covered in lawn and cascading greenery on both sides.\nWalking to the main door, Zhuang Chen directly placed her hand on the sensor plate by the door. The door clicked open and Zhuang Chen informed them as they strolled into the house: “Later on, I’ll input all of your palm prints into the system.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe living room was very spacious after entering, and once Yi ShaoQing entered, he dropped Gu Ning’s luggage to the side and plopped himself into the sofa while saying comfortably: “Our home is still the best.  Zhuang Chen, go show them around, I’ll catch up on my sleep.” Then he simply rolled over, hid his face in the sofa, and ignored the rest of them.\nZhuang Chen rolled her eyes, but didn’t bother him, then led Gu Ning and the others to tour around the house.\nThe front was dedicated to accommodation, the first floor was the lounge for normal activity while the second floor was their personal space.\nEach bedroom was very spacious, with all kinds of furniture, and was decorated in a bright palette, very simple and clean. On the second floor, there were at least a dozen of rooms that were of various sizes.\n“I’ve already reserved a room for you, Gu Ning, it’s this room.” The room Zhuang Chen mentioned was the one closest to hers: “I’ll make a call later and have them deliver all the bedding. You can also make a list of what you need and write down your specific requirements.”\nIn addition to their personal room, there was a large common study room. Half of it was for books and the other half of the room was equipped with a long table and a few chairs which Zhuang Chen mentioned was their usual spot for meeting.\nOn the second floor, there was a corridor leading to the back of the building.\nIf the building front section was for their daily life, then the back was where they had trained.\nGu Ning roughly estimated that there were at least 300 square feet, all of the rooms were linked and filled with all sorts of equipment, including sandbags and all those gym facilities which Gu Ning couldn’t quite understand. What puzzled her was in the corner there was a ping pong table, a storage box with various tennis rackets, badminton rackets, and other sports equipment, as well as a dart target hanging on the wall.\nZhuang Chen laughed slightly awkwardly: “When I’m bored, I usually just play around.”\nGu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai, Chen Gen, and Zhong Xu, all four looked at each other with their bellies full of confusion.\nIn all seriousness, none of the four of them knew what the Five Stars Brigade was supposed to do. They had thought that they would be pulled into a group training ground like the army and then had to go through a very tough training period. Instead, when they had arrived here, it was very different from what they had imagined and it made them feel more uneasy than happy.\nZhuang Chen explained: “Don’t worry guys, the other squads will be sending people over in the next few days.”\nGu Ning frowned: “So we have to wait for everyone to arrive before we can start learning things?”\nZhuang Chen was stunned by Gu Ning’s question, then laughed: “Don’t worry, if you want, I can teach you later.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Really?” Gu Ning’s eyes lit up.\n“You’re such a strange person.” Zhuang Chen said: “Don’t cry when the time comes.”\nGu Ning only laughed and didn’t say anything.\nAfter that Zhuang Chen took Gu Ning to the training room.\n“Did you learn any foundation for martial arts before?” Zhuang Chen asked.\nGu Ning shook her head honestly.\n“For me, there are no special moves for close combat. How to deal the most damage to the enemy is the best move and can only be taught to you in actual drills. So you should try attacking me now.” Zhuang Chen stood there and waited for her.\nGu Ning stared at Zhuang Chen who stood there casually, a bit unsure of how to start. She hadn’t learned any close combat skills and only knew how to use her knife to slash directly. Thus, when Zhuang Chen asked her to attack, she didn’t know how to react to it for a while.\n“What’s wrong?” Zhuang Chen asked curiously as she stared at Gu Ning who didn’t react.\nIt was a rare moment for Gu Ning to be a little embarrassed but she replied honestly: “I don’t know how to attack——“\nZhuang Chen’s expression was a little odd: “Then how did you get Yin Sang into such a mess? Just do what you did to Yin Sang and do the same to me too.”\nGu Ning had a somewhat struggling expression on her face before she sighed and resigned herself to fate as she rushed towards Zhuang Chen.\n“What is Gu Ning doing?” Yi ShaoQing asked in surprise. Not sure when he came over and watched Gu Ning’s training but right now she was charging towards Zhuang Chen like a fighting bull.\n“Uh…… that’s probably Gu Ning’s way of attacking.” Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and Chen Gen, who was also watching the scene from the side, replied with some embarrassment.\nGu Ning’s first attack ended with her being viciously flipped to the ground by Zhuang Chen.\nZhang XiaoBai and the two onlookers, all winced at the scene.\nYi ShaoQing, on the other hand, was stunned: “How did she get Yin Sang into such a mess like that?! She didn’t cheat, did she?”\nGu Ning stood up from the ground, thought for a moment then said to Zhuang Chen: “I think you should attack me instead?”\nZhuang Chen was stunned: “What?” Then she quickly responded: “Are you sure?”\nGu Ning nodded her head.\nYi ShaoQing chuckled: “Tsk tsk, such courageous.”\nAfter Zhuang Chen confirmed that Gu Ning was being serious, she didn’t hesitate any more and launched a quick punch toward Gu Ning’s face. She only used a quarter of her strength in this punch, fearing that she would injure her in the process. Zhuang Chen’s close combat was not the most powerful, but her punches were still fast. However, Gu Ning, who was passive in the previous fight, finally found her way to react. Even though Zhuang Chen’s punches were fast, Gu Ning’s reactions were even faster. She sidestepped to avoid the punch and her eyes flashed brightly as she found the same feeling she had in the post-apocalyptic world. After avoiding it, her elbow gathered strength and slammed it hard towards Zhuang Chen’s waist!\nThe playful look on Yi ShaoQing’s face was gone and he exclaimed in shock: “What a quick reaction!”\nHe didn’t know that Gu Ning’s reaction had been honed in countless life-and-death situations, and a split second of judgement was a matter between life and death, so how could she dare to make the slightest mistake?\nZhuang Chen was equally surprised as Yi ShaoQing as how could the difference between attacking and being attacked be so great? As surprised as she was, Zhuang Chen didn’t panic, and with the same rich experience in combat, she dodged it sideways. Her hands reached out like lightning and grabbed onto Gu Ning’s elbow that had missed the strike, and then flipped it with force!\nBoth of them were empty-handed, and Gu Ning managed to sustain nearly twenty moves before being knocked to the ground by Zhuang Chen again.\nThis time, her eyes were suddenly lit up, and after getting up from the ground, she said excitedly to Zhuang Chen: “Again!”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hmmm… not much of the fighting was explained. Oh well~ sometime it just doesn’t fit that well with the chapter titles hahaha. Too high expectation with such chapter titles. Thank you all for reading!

    "80": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-80/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAn hour or so had passed.\nYi ShaoQing, who originally had a gleeful smile on his face, became increasingly serious. He had watched Gu Ning go from being toppled to the ground by Zhuang Chen in three minutes to now withstanding Zhuang Chen’s attack for over ten minutes, whereas Gu Ning had been a person with no foundation in close combat at all an hour ago.\n\n\n\nZhuang Chen, on the other hand, was increasingly alarmed. From the ease of the beginning to the present, Gu Ning’s attack ability started forming a sense of oppression even though Zhuang Chen had gradually increased her strength. Although it was not enough to make her use her full strength, it was still enough to make her put away her contempt for Gu Ning.\nThis was entirely dependent on Gu Ning’s fearsome learning ability, as she was able to distract herself from this fierce fight to remember Zhaung Chen’s moves and soon mimicked those moves she had just learned to attack her back. It had to be said that her learning ability was very frightening. Moreover, in the process of exchanging blows, Zhuang Chen also found out that Gu Ning’s physical fitness was different from normal……\nExcellent reaction speed and physical fitness coupled with a terrifying learning ability…… Zhuang Chen was secretly amazed.\nZhuang Chen knocked Gu Ning down again, this time she had put up for twenty minutes. Even though it was in a state where Zhuang Chen had controlled her strength, it was still amazing enough.\nGu Ning stood up from the ground, her eyes were shining. Although she had been knocked over again and again by Zhuang Chen, she was incomparably exhilarated both mentally and physically at this very moment.\nIt could be said that she relied on her strength and agility in killing the zombies previously, without any skills involved. However, that only worked on zombies that had not been evolved as she could still handle them. Yet, now that the zombies have evolved and those unresponsive zombies had become agile, the strength and agility she relies on would be greatly diminished. Meanwhile, knowing close combat techniques was a way to fully utilise the strength and agility she possesses.\nIn just over an hour, Gu Ning had already felt the benefit of learning close combat skills could do for her.\nSeeing that Gu Ning’s eyes were still shining and her eager look to continue, Zhuang Chen had to call a halt: “Wait wait! Aren’t you tired, Gu Ning?”\nGu Ning replied: “I’m fine.” She was way more than fine, she couldn’t have been better.\nZhuang Chen shrugged helplessly: “You aren’t tired, but I am. Let’s stop the training for today, it’s only the first day so there isn’t a need to rush.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning felt that what she had learned from Zhuang Chen was enough for her to digest for a while.\nZhuang Chen pulled a towel to wipe the sweat from her face and glanced at Gu Ning’s clean face and exclaimed in surprise: “After practicing for so long, you didn’t even sweat a drop?! Such a pervert.”\nGu Ning smiled: “I rarely sweat.”\n“Then, the few of you feel free to practice here, I’m going to take a shower.” Zhuang Chen greeted Yi ShaoQing after she had finished speaking, then the two of them left together.\nIn the small conference room, Zhuang Chen made her assessment of Gu Ning’s performance in the afternoon: “Gu Ning is amazing in both her reaction speed and physical fitness as well as her learning ability. From this point of view, it’s very unlikely to be someone who has never trained before.”\nYi ShaoQing flipped the information in his hand, then commented: “According to the information collected, Gu Ning used to belong to the type of people who didn’t have a high presence in the university. She didn’t participate in the school sports at all, much less to learn taekwondo or other martial arts. Gu Ning’s family background is extremely simple, her father has been a teacher in a high school for over twenty years while her mother is a housewife and their interpersonal relationship is clear. The only thing that is a little strange is that she went on a trip after graduation and was out of touch for three months. Her parents reported her missing, but the police have also found records of her registering her stay in the area with her ID card, and videos of her going in and out of the hotels.”\n“So how did she know about the Five Stars Brigade?” Yin Sang asked a vital question.\nYi ShaoQing continued: “The commander of Third Company said it was a friend of hers. I’ve also asked someone to investigate this friend of hers, and he was a police officer named Fang Fa who had been close to Gu Ning recently that had leaked out this information. This Fang Fa had graduated from military school and served in the army. He also took part in the selection process the year before but was unsuccessful. There is nothing wrong with any of this information. We can say that Gu Ning’s identity is very clean.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhuang Chen nodded and chimed in: “If she had any ulterior motives, then in order not to arouse our suspicion, she would have hidden these differences in herself. However, it’s like she doesn’t even know that she’s different from the norm. So I still think she should just be talented.”\nYi ShaoQing nodded: “I agree with Zhuang Chen.”\nGu Ning didn’t know that there was a dispute within the Five Stars Brigade because of her, she was practicing with Zhang XiaoBai and the other two.\nZhang XiaoBai refused to get up after being knocked to the ground for the third time by Gu Ning: “Enough, no more fighting! You pervert!”\nGu Ning looked awkwardly at Zhong Xu and Chen Gen.\nZhong Xu hurriedly walked a little further away while Chen Gen silently stepped back and pretended not to see Gu Ning’s gaze at all. It wasn’t that they wouldn’t practice with Gu Ning, it was because she was just too scary.\nAfter learning those moves from Zhuang Chen, she used them all on the three of them. All of their close combat skills were very average, and after being knocked over by Gu Ning a few times, they were afraid of falling. Gu Ning had no choice but to go and beat up the sandbag helplessly.\nDinner was ordered from the takeaway, and in order not to scare them too much, Gu Ning tried to restrain her appetite. However, when she picked up the third portion of rice, Zhuang Chen, Yi ShaoQing, and Yin Sang’s expressions still changed. Ji JiuZe just glanced at her and then continued eating his bowl of food.\nHer room had already been set up while she was still at the training area. After changing into a clean set of pajamas, Gu Ning lay on her bed, still, a little overwhelmed as she recalled the close combat skills she had learned during the day.\nEven though she had made sure the door to her room was locked, she still went into the bathroom, locked the door before entering the space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning took a look at the ocean level as usual, yet there was no surprise and nothing had changed.\nGu Ning was now able to fully accept this fact as she glanced at the ocean, wondering when it would totally dry up.\nLeaving the space to the post-apocalyptic world.\nIt was already nine o’clock in the morning, yet the dawn slowly rose.\n“The sun is rising late.” Fang Fa walked over to Gu Ning with a piece of bread in his mouth and a messy chicken nest haircut. He followed her gaze into the sky while passing the other piece of bread in his hand to Gu Ning.\nGu Ning took the bread and said: “The sun is sinking earlier in the evening too.”\nFang Fa asked with a sudden thought: “What do you think the world would be like if the sun never rose again one day?”\nHowever, Gu Ning only replied: “I hope that day will never come.”\nCheng Ming unintentionally passed by and froze for a moment as he stared at Fang Fa and Gu Ning’s back view in the backyard, while his expression became a little gloomy.\nThe children were stronger and more diligent than the adults expected from them.\nAlthough yesterday’s training had worn out the fragile hands of several children, most of them were present for the training today except for two of the younger girls.\nThe training program that Brother San had set for them was to get up every morning at seven to go running in the backyard. Whoever finished the 3,000 metres course first could go and have their breakfast.\nAfter a half-hour break from breakfast, they started chopping down trees. The trees they were chopping were catalysed by Gu Ning’s psychic power. This was also a new way Gu Ning had found to consume less psychic energy. If she used her psychic energy to conjure something out of nothing, the amount of energy consumed would be almost several times more than catalysing the already existing seeds or saplings. The amount of energy required to catalyse a few saplings were almost negligible to Gu Ning.\nA tree that could only be encircled by an adult was chopped by groups of two from morning to night, and today’s training event was still tree chopping.\nTheir blistered palms were just wrapped in a few layers of gauze. As compared to yesterday, the enthusiasm of the children was subdued. With the pain in their hands, they were all chopping it half-heartedly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAmong them, however, were a few children who did exceptionally well.\nOne was Wu Sen, a young boy who had already made an impression on Gu Ning. Along with a little fatty named Zuo You who was always sticking with him had to take three breaths before he could chop the tree again but never did he ever stop chopping. Another was the oldest of girls, He He, who was also pursing her lips and chopping hard at the tree.\nFather Gu pointed out: “These three kids are amazing.” After a few days of recuperation and with Gu Ning’s healing powers, Father Gu looked a lot more energetic. He loved reading newspapers before the apocalypse happened, but now there was none for him to read. Gu Ning was afraid that he would be bored so she had him in-charge of supervising the children which he enjoyed a lot. He sighed again: “If there had been peace like the past, these three children would have been of great use in the future. They are so young and have so much perseverance.”\nGu Ning smiled faintly. If they were able to grow up safely, that would be the future that Brother San had been talking about.\nIt was impossible to tell how many children had died in such a disaster.\nWas the population now just a percent of what it was before the apocalypse happened? Gu Ning didn’t know, but as far as Jinyong was concerned, it was definitely less than one percent.\nAfter dawn, Brother San and the others would be heading out again.\nUnder Gu Ning’s strong request, the other soldier was replaced and she took the spot.\nRight now, she couldn’t wait to get a feel of how close combat would work on a real battlefield.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hohohoho… the smell of battle scene is coming soon.

Yesterday there were people in their forties and fifties mixed in the hunting group, yet today it was mostly young adults. Those who did not have a car looked enviously at Gu Ning as they got into their military truck. Some were even more daring to come forward and ask them for a lift to the nearby area.\n“We can submit our supplies, just bring us near to the Yellow Bridge.” A young man found the courage to approach Brother San, who appeared to be in charge among these men. They were a group of five, four men and one woman, all in their twenties. They were holding knives, most of which had been curled, and waited for the reply with a look of apprehension and vague expectation……\n\n\n\nThey were requesting this because it was difficult to find any more supplies and zombies within the distance from the colony to the Yellow Bridge.  It would take at least two hours to walk from here to the Yellow Bridge, and there was a chance of encountering danger in the midway. Thus, when they saw Brother San’s truck, they decided to take their chances.\nOriginally, Brother San wanted to refuse straight away, but after looking at their wretched and pleading faces, he inevitably thought of those soldiers under his command. After a moment’s hesitation, he took a piece of bread from the young man’s hand and agreed: “Get in, we’ll give you all a ride.”\nThey were not expecting much but when they heard that Brother San had agreed, they were overjoyed and thanked him. Fearing that Brother San might back out suddenly, they all hurried and got into the last military truck.\nLuo Long looked at the somewhat dirty piece of bread in Brother San’s hand and asked in disbelief: “Brother San, if you’re bringing them for a ride, why do you have to take this piece of bread from them? It’s not like we’re short of supplies to eat.”\nBrother San glanced at him and explained: “This is to let them know that we aren’t any saints. At least the rest won’t bother us like some pests. Stop nagging and get in the truck.”\nLuo Long scratched his head and followed Brother San into the truck. He was simple-minded and naturally not as meticulous as Brother San.\nThe five men wore clothes that hadn’t been changed for who knows how long, and their bodies reeked of unpleasant sour odours. Their exposed skin was caked with a thick layer of mud and dirt, except for their slightly cleaner faces. In the military truck, Gu Ning, Cheng Ming, and the others were all dressed in clean clothes and good spirits, and the carriage was kept clean and tidy, free of odours. When those five men got into the truck, the carriage was instantly filled with their sour smell, and they were a little embarrassed, afraid that Gu Ning and the others would kick them out because of this.\nHowever, to their surprise, Gu Ning and the other’s expressions always looked very calm and frank. There weren’t any disgusted expressions, not even a subtle movement like a frown, as if they couldn’t smell the stench on them at all which slowly calmed down their fidgeting bodies.\nIt took around 20 to 30 minutes to reach the Yellow Bridge, Zhang XiaoBai and the others were not too comfortable chatting and laughing when they were presented with a few strangers. Thus, the atmosphere in the truck was somewhat dull, as the few men exchanged glances and swallowed away the introductions they were about to make in silence.\nOnce they got to the Yellow Bridge, the truck stopped to drop them off before driving away immediately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“If only we could join their team.” A young man said enviously as he looked at the military truck that was speeding away.\n“Dream on.” Another youth sneered but also stated with slight envy: “I heard that they can eat three meals a day. Did you see that big truck that was parked in their yard? I heard that the truck was full of supplies. Just look at their clothes and you can tell that they are from a different world as compared with us……” At this point, he gave an awkward smile: “Let’s work hard too, so we can be just like them after we’ve become special abilities users.”\nEveryone else felt their spirits lifted.\nMany others thought like them too, and all were searching in groups for the crystal cores as those were their last hope for this world.\nParked in an outskirts area of the downtown, probably it was still early so they were the first batch of people to arrive here and no others were here yet.\nToday, they were heading deeper into the downtown area, targeting the hospital downtown.\nAs they had to go deeper into the downtown area, soldiers like Zhang Yang, who hadn’t developed their powers had to stay behind at the colony and were responsible for keeping watch. Right now in Gu Ning’s group were Brother San, Fang Fa, Cheng Ming, Zhang XiaoBai, Huang MengYao, Jia DaoZhang, and Xiang Xu, all seven special abilities users were present, along with Xiang Yi who requested strongly to follow and was responsible for protecting Xiang Xu. Gu Ning had considered that if there was really any danger, there wouldn’t be anyone who would be more capable than Xiang Yi of taking care of Xiang Xu instantly, so his request was granted. Although Gu Ning still subconsciously rejects the leader position, unknowingly her responsibility in this team was growing.\nEveryone except Gu Ning and Xiang Yu had two transparent crystal cores on standby in case of emergency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDue to Gu Ning’s healing ability being too consuming, they didn’t want to use her psychic power unless they were forced to, so they needed a lot of medicine on standby. Moreover, Brother San had mentioned in his conversation with Gu Ning that he was interested in bringing Dr. Gao to the team and Gu Ning agreed. She had trusted Gao Yue ever since she had operated on Father Gu, and the sensible and calm manner displayed by her in several contacts had also left a good impression on Gu Ning while their team was indeed short of doctors.\nTherefore, they were going to sweep the central hospital and use those items and equipment to pull Dr. Gao into their team when they returned.\nThe city’s central hospital was the largest public tertiary hospital in Jinyong city and was ranked among the best in the country. It was located in the middle of Golden Gate Street and Eleventh Square.\nGolden Gate Street was much more crowded than Eleventh Square, and the hospital was at its peak during weekends. At that time, people who were infected by the zombie virus and fainted would first be sent to the hospital. Afterward, they would transform into zombies in the hospital while those medical staff who treated them were completely unaware of the situation, as well as those visitors who came to see the patients. One could imagine what a tragic disaster it was.\nHowever, imagining it was not as gruesome as witnessing it.\nThe glass doors of the hospital were half ajar and several unrecognizable bodies were lying in front of the entrance. It included half-severe bodies, bodies with missing parts, a pool of dried blood on the floor, and various internal organs that had dried up ——\nGu Ning asked: “Xiang Xu, what’s the situation there?”\nXiang Xu’s spiritual energy had long covered the entire building, and her brow furrowed slightly as she replied with a strange feeling: “Only a few zombies were checked out….. Could there be monsters like last time?” Xiang Xu was referring to the previous mutated zombies that could avoid her spiritual power detection.\nThere were nine floors in the city’s central hospital and it would be too strange if there were so few zombies in it.\nEveryone, including Gu Ning, thought that it was unlikely to have so few zombies, but they were unwilling to head back without knowing what was inside. After a moment’s of hesitation, they decided to go in and find out what was going on, and if they noticed anything wrong, they would immediately retreat,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs soon as their retreat path was planned, Gu Ning was the first one to step over the blackened bloodstains on the floor and walked into the hospital lobby.\nEveryone else followed Gu Ning’s footsteps one by one and entered.\nThe hospital was eerily quiet and only the sound of their footsteps could be heard. The first floor lobby was strewn with countless bodies, few of which could be found intact while most were missing arms and legs. There were also disembowelled bodies with their heads cracked open and dried brain juices spilled everywhere, and what was even more chilling were those fearful expressions with their eyes wide open. There were so many severed limbs on the ground that even walking had to be done in between the gaps of the bodies. When Huang MengYao accidentally stepped on a severed hand, she shrieked in shock. The group of them who were already on the edge were all startled by her.\n“Still haven’t found anything yet?” Gu Ning asked again.\nXiang Xu shook her head with a gloomy expression.\nBy now, Fang Fa, who had already walked to the entrance of the elevator in the lobby, was standing by the bulletin board in front of the elevator entrance and called out to them: “Hey, come over here and take a look. Here is the map of the hospital layout.”\nGu Ning and the others gathered over. There was indeed a map of the hospital’s layout posted on that bulletin board, with details of the locations and directions.\nTheir main targets this time were the pharmacy and the operating theatre which were on the first floor.\n“Hey?! How strange, this elevator actually still works?” Jia DaoZhang suddenly said as he unintentionally pressed the down button and only to find that the button lit up.\nThe others glanced over and sure enough, the down button was lit up in red.\nFang Fa explained: “It should be the hospital’s backup electricity.”\nJia DaoZhang continued: “When the time comes, we shall get a few generators too. It’s really inconvenient now that there’s no electricity anywhere.”\nAs they spoke, the screen above the button showed that the lift had reached the fourth floor and was continuing its descent.\nGu Ning suddenly made a gesture of silence, the others subconsciously focused at that elevator door. Gu Ning focused on her listening for a moment before her expression changed slightly: “Be careful!”\nThe next second after Gu Ning had shouted this out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe elevator made a “ding!” sound.\nThe elevator doors opened silently in front of the nervous crowd, it was too late to retreat and everyone held their breath for a moment while getting ready to unleash their psychic powers for whatever came out of it.\nYet inside the opened elevator was empty except for the blood all over the floor and a corpse in the corner with half of its body bitten off. There was nothing at all for them to be careful about.\nThe elevator door stayed open for a short while before slowly closing again which made it look like a false alarm. Everyone’s tense nerves were instantly relaxed after the shout by Gu Ning. Zhang XiaoBai even gave Gu Ning a slight grumbling look and said: “Gu Ning, do you know that could scare other people to death?!”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hehehe you could see where the battle scene would be coming from~ Thank you all for reading! Get ready for next week! Love ya all!)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "82": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-82/\n(T/N: These chapters are dedicated to Kyuin T. ~ Thank you for your kind and generous support! Although you didn’t state which novel you are from so I’ve assumed it’s TDRA hahahaha. Thank you once again! If it’s not TDRA please let me know and I’ll rush other novel chapters for you again haha~)\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHowever, just as Zhang XiaoBai’s sentence ended, Xiang Yi, who was standing at the very edge, stared at the top of the elevator door with a sudden change in his expression: “What is that?!”\nEveryone jerked their gaze towards the elevator instantly, but they saw nothing. Then the elevator door closed completely in front of their eyes.\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai who got startled by Xiang Yi’s yell patted his chest, and whined: “Xiang Yi, what’s wrong with you kid, there’s nothing there!”\nGu Ning asked Xiang Yi: “What did you see?”\n“I don’t know.” Xiang Yi was still slightly distraught and his face was pale: “I don’t know what it was, it just leaped out from the top of the elevator and was gone in a flash.” He pointed to the ceiling above the walkway leading to the other direction and stated: “It ran that way and it was very fast!”\nZhang XiaoBai was puzzled and asked: “How is it possible that you’re the only one who saw it when there are multiple pairs of eyes but didn’t manage to see it? It can’t be that your eyes are blurry, right?”\nGu Ning, however, ignored Zhang XiaoBai’s remarks and walked over to the elevator door to check out the ceiling. There was a thin layer of transparent water-like trail that could be seen, trailing along the direction of where Xiang Yi had pointed out. This should be the trail left by the thing that Xiang Yi said to have burst out of the elevator. She had focused on listening intently and was sure that she heard some movement in the elevator previously. Yet only Xiang Yi had seen it, so it could be concluded that the thing’s movement speed was very fast.\nShe turned around and warned everyone in a deep voice: “Everyone be careful and stay alert.” She glanced up at the ceiling: “There might be some mutated zombies.”\nWhat Xiang Yi had said would be questioned by everyone but Gu Ning’s words were rarely doubted by anyone.\nThe crowd was shocked and those who had experienced dealing with the mutated zombies previously changed their expressions. Huang MengYao was not present the last time but seeing the grim and wary expression of others, she also understood how frightening the mutated zombies were.\nRecalling the tentacles with suctions that clung onto his chest previously when fighting the mutated zombies, Jia DaoZhang rubbed his chest to reduce the disgusting feeling and asked: “It won’t be similar to that tentacle-sucking monster last time, right?” Looking around uneasily and continued: “This place is strangely sinister, let’s not waste any time and hurry up, grab the stuff we need and get out of here.”\nBrother San agreed: “Let’s move quickly and stop idling. I’ve also felt that something is off here.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe rest of them agreed, and without any further ado, they quickened their pace and ran in the direction of the pharmacy.\nXiang Xu did not detect anything unusual with her spiritual power that she had emitted so she retracted it before spreading it out again in a large net to shield everyone in it.\nThe corridors were full of wreckage and severed limbs, with very few intact bodies to be seen. The gnawed bodies were horrifying, lying in disarray in the corridors, creating a distressing visual impact for the human eye and mind. Even Gu Ning only stared straight ahead and did not dare check it out too closely. Huang MengYao’s face turned a shade whiter, holding back herself from shrieking and followed closely behind Cheng Ming while carefully avoiding stepping on those corpses.\nThe pharmacy was large and looking through the glass panels, a violent struggle must have taken place in it as the shelves were all knocked out of place. The door was wide open and in front of the doorway lay a corpse with the back of its head smashed in by some blunt object.\nBrother San immediately dragged the corpse away from them and threw it into the side of the corridor, then he stopped everyone who wanted to enter and said: “I’ll go in with Gu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai, and Cheng Ming. The rest of you, remain outside so you all can deal with any situation that happens.”\nGu Ning nodded: “Brother San is right.” Then she took the lead, stepped on the blood-stained floor, and entered.\nAs soon as they had entered, they saw two female bodies in white coats lying under the table by the window, both were in a crawling position towards the door. On the floor were various medicines that had fallen from the shelves.\nThe shelves were more than two metres high and the pharmacy had a small ladder for the pharmacist to climb up and get those medicines, so the view was blocked from looking further in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai excitedly urged: “So many medicines! Gu Ning, quickly use your space and store all these medicines.”\nGu Ning nodded then with a wave of her hand, she emptied the first row of shelves all into her space, then she walked to the second row, then the third row, then the fourth…… In less than a minute, Gu Ning had wiped out all of the medicines in the pharmacy, including those that had fallen on the floor as well as the ones in the storage room.\nAfter ransacking the pharmacy, the four of them exited, and then the group continued exploring. They opened the doors to every room along the way and then collected everything they could use into the space. Gu Ning and the others barged into an operating theatre where there was a corpse lying on the operating table in a gnawed mess. Its stomach had been ripped open, the whole scene was so gruesome that Xiang Yi had pulled Xiang Xu out of the room.\nGu Ning silently collected all the equipment and stuff into the space.\nThen all of them retreated to the corridor.\nBrother San glanced at the building next to him and asked: “Do we still go there?”\nGu Ning roughly estimated the things she had collected in the space, plus the fact that she had been having an uneasy feeling in her mind ever since she had stepped into the hospital and replied: “Forget it, let’s just go back.”\nThe crowd was relieved to hear Gu Ning’s decision, it was obvious that everyone was worried by the thing that Xiang Yi had witnessed coming out of the lift and just wanted to leave as fast as possible.\nZhang XiaoBai walked at the end of the group and followed everyone forward.\nAt that very moment, a drop of liquid dripped down from the ceiling and precisely onto the top of Zhang XiaoBai’s head. He stopped in his tracks and wondered as he touched the top of his head for a moment. Feeling the wet and slippery mucus, he subconsciously glanced up——\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nA long cold, slippery object strangled Zhang XiaoBai’s neck at the moment when he tried to cry out in surprise. The spiky tip plunged directly into his throat and gagged him from making any noise! Zhang XiaoBai’s eyes widened in horror as he stared at the people in front of him who were walking away unaware. He tried making sounds but it was too difficult to even open his mouth while his stomach churned and wanted to throw up. As he was about to unleash his psychic power, suddenly something stung his tongue and his body instantly felt like it had been struck by electricity. Zhang XiaoBai’s whole body went numb and weak that he couldn’t even move his fingers. However, he was conscious enough to feel the cold, slippery snake-like object wrapped around his neck tighten for a moment before he was dragged backward by this “tail” from some part of the mutated zombies’ body…..\nTurn around ah! Please look back ! ! ! His eyes were reddened with bloodshot as he stared deadly at the group that kept moving ahead while he was screaming in his mind! Hoping that someone would glance back at this point, yet he could only watch as Gu Ning and the others moved further away from him. The object that wrapped around his neck was getting tighter as if it was trying to strangle him straight to death. Zhang XiaoBai was simply devastated when half of his body was dragged up the stairs!\nHowever, just then! Gu Ning, who had been walking in front, suddenly felt that something was wrong. Zhang XiaoBai had always been the most talkative, yet he had been quiet for so long? A sudden ominous feeling arose in her heart, and she jerked to a halt to glance behind her and it was just that glance! Gu Ning happened to see Zhang XiaoBai’s feet disappearing into the stairway!\nGu Ning was instantly shocked and shouted: “Shit!”\nGu Ning’s shout was simply frightening in this oppressive atmosphere! Without waiting for others to react, Gu Ning had already spun around and chased Zhang XiaoBai up the stairs with her knife in hand! At the same time, she yelled to Fang Fa in the group: “Fang Fa! Quick go and save Zhang XiaoBai!”\nFang Fa’s psychic power was speed ability and at the very moment when he heard Gu Ning shout, he didn’t even have the time to check if Zhang XiaoBai was gone and just hurriedly mobilized his psychic power. His body immediately rushed out like an arrow shot off from the bow!\nThe others reacted quickly as well! They immediately noticed that someone was missing from the group and when they heard Gu Ning’s words, they were all shocked, then spun around and chased after them!\nAlthough Gu Ning didn’t have speed augmenting ability, she was still extremely fast because of her body mechanism! She went up the stairs in three steps per stride along with Fang Fa to chase after Zhang XiaoBai!\nThe mutated zombie was dragging its long “tail” with the end firmly wrapped around Zhang XiaoBai’s neck while its hands and feet were firmly glued to the ceiling like suction cups. It darted across the ceiling like a gecko and its body, including its face, was covered in a layer of transparent slime, leaving a trail wherever it crawled——\nEven though the mutated zombie speed was very fast, Gu Ning and Fang Fa followed them by the slime trail. However, dragging a prey with its “tail”, its speed was slightly slowed down but the mutated zombie refused to release the prey that it had caught so easily. The mutated zombie had only fled to the third floor when it was caught up by Fang Fa who was in hot pursuit. Fang Fa saw that Zhang XiaoBai’s neck was held in a deadly grip, his face had turned reddish and his eyes were about to burst out from the choking which looked simply horrifying! Fang Fa was startled, then once again increased his speed while holding onto his knife tightly. His mind was focused on saving Zhang XiaoBai from the mutated zombie and didn’t even bother to see how scary that mutated zombie looked!\nIn a blink of an eye, Fang Fa, being a speed ability user, appeared in front of Zhang XiaoBai! Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately raised the knife and slashed it! The mutated zombie didn’t seem to expect Fang Fa’s agility so it didn’t manage to dodge and the knife directly slashed at its “tail”! The mutated zombie hissed out in pain! However, the slash made by Fang Fa only left a small cut on the “tail” of the mutated zombie! It didn’t even manage to leave a deep wound!\nThe mutated zombie was in pain! It hissed and growled! It went berserk and swung the “tail” that had coiled around Zhang XiaoBai! Then with a strong fling, it threw Zhang XiaoBai against the wall! Zhang XiaoBai wrapped by the “tail” was slammed heavily into the wall before falling to the ground. His whole body curled up in pain and coughed violently!\nAs soon as Zhang Xiaobai had been shaken off, the “tail” instantly swung toward Fang Fa! The “tail” was incredibly agile after getting rid of Zhang XiaoBai! And it was extremely fast! It lunged straight at Fang Fa! Fang Fa’s heart thumped as he saw how fast the “tail” had moved but it was too late for him to avoid it. Thus he could only grit his teeth and raise his knife to block the attack!\nZhang XiaoBai’s body was in severe pain, and recalled being stabbed by the stinger on the “tail” of the mutated zombie which caused his whole body to be paralyzed, and couldn’t even move his fingers. Right now when he saw Fang Fa was fighting head-on with it, he wanted to warn him to be careful of the stinger on the “tail”. Yet the more anxious he was, the more he coughed. His face was so flushed with anger and anxiety that he almost couldn’t catch his breath and was about to pass out!\nIt was like the “tail” had eyes on it! It wasn’t afraid of the knife in Fang Fa’s hand as it swept the knife away and flung it to the side before lunging toward him again! Fang Fa’s sharp eyes noticed that the tip of the “tail” was abnormally pointy and as if he was fighting his nemesis, he was afraid that there was something tricky about it. He didn’t have any knife in his hand right now and didn’t dare to fight it directly with his bare hand, so he could only retreat immediately! Luckily he was a speed ability user, if it were any ordinary person in this situation, they would never be able to avoid the attack. He managed to use his speed psychic energy to distance himself three or four meters away instantly! That “tail” smacked right into the wall with a loud pow! It was simply mind-blowing and terrifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSeeing that the blow had missed, the mutated zombie darted quickly along with the ceiling and the walls on the side. It was unburdened at the moment and was incredibly fast as it rapidly closed in on Fang Fa! It was only then did Fang Fa take a good look at the face of the mutated zombie which was covered in a layer of mucus. The left face was rotting but the right face was still intact and both eyes were tightly closed. It looked weird and disgusting, and there was no telling what it used to capture its prey’s location with such high precision! Fang Fa couldn’t give it more thought, knowing that Gu Ning and the others were desperately trying to reach here, all he had to do now was to stall for some time.\nTherefore, he used his speed ability to start running along the corridor and around the hall in a mad frenzy!\nYet the mutated zombie that had lost the restraint was on the same pace as Fang Fa! What’s even scarier was that Fang Fa could only run on the floor while it could dash around on the ceiling and walls. Fang Fa reached the end of the corridor with no other route, and just as he turned around to find another way, the mutated zombie snapped off the ceiling, dropped to the floor, directly blocking his path of retreat!\nAs if sensing that Fang Fa had nowhere to run, it slowed its movements, dragging its long “tail” like a gecko on the ground as it approached Fang Fa. Its “tail” flipped upside down in an arc, like a scorpion holding up its stinger getting ready. At the slightest movement from Fang Fa, it would not hesitate to stab it towards him!\nFang Fa stared at the slime-covered face from a distance and felt suffocated. He glanced back, the window behind him was open, would he die if he jumped from the third floor? At the same time as he thought about it, he wondered why Gu Ning and the others were so slow in rescuing?!\nFang Fa was unaware that Gu Ning and the others were in a more dangerous situation than he was!\nXiang Yi and Xiang Xu were surrounded by Gu Ning, Brother San, Jia DaoZhang, and others in the middle. Xiang Yi gripped the knife in his hand so tightly that even his voice was noticeably trembling uncontrollably: “What… What the hell are those things…….” He watched in horror as at least four or five extremely disgusting mutated zombies dragged their long “tails” and were covered in slime, slowly approaching them from the ceiling……\n===============================================================\n(T/N: The previous posting was met with the site maintenance so the post was gone.

Here we go ~)\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning’s lips pursed tightly as she stared at the five disgusting mutated zombies on the ceiling while gripping the knife in her hand firmly. Even she had turned pale in the face of these mutated zombies, let alone the others. Huang MengYao’s face had been entirely pale since she entered the hospital and now it was as white as paper. Xiang Xu, who was being protected by Xiang Yi, was also as white as a sheet.\nEveryone else’s expression was unusually grim.\n\n\n\nGu Ning instructed: “Cheng Ming, you are in-charge of protecting Xiang Xu and Xiang Yi.”\nCheng Ming gave a solemn nod.\nGu Ning was still worried about Fang Fa and Zhang XiaoBai at this point: “Jia DaoZhang, we’ll cover you. You’ll head up and help Fang Fa and leave the situation here to us.”\nJia DaoZhang froze, then glanced at the stairs next to him and replied with a solemnness: “Alright.”\nSeeing those mutated zombies getting closer, Gu Ning didn’t care about saving her psychic energy at this moment and her psychic energy within the space surged up in huge waves! The psychic energy gushed out frantically! Several vines broke out of the wall and were manipulated by Gu Ning into two lanes heading straight for the two closest mutated zombies!\nGu Ning’s attack was like a signal, and almost as soon as the vines broke through the wall, the others reacted too!\nFollowing closely behind Gu Ning was Cheng Ming! Dozens of wind blades instantly manifested themselves and swept toward the mutated zombies closest to him!\nBrother San launched the attack at the same time as Cheng Ming, however, his attack speed was not as fast as his. In addition, Brother San’s psychic power was limited and each time he could only conjure twenty earth spikes. Knowing how terrifying the mutated zombies were, he didn’t skimp on his powers and sent twenty earth spikes straight away toward the head of the mutated zombie right in front of him!\nThe last one to strike was Huang MengYao and her face was still ghastly pale. In all seriousness, she had evolved together with Gu Ning. The amount of psychic energy she had after absorbing the psychic energy attracted by Gu Ning was far more than Brother San. She had also practiced a lot in manipulating her psychic energy under Cheng Ming’s guidance, but her actual combat experience was considered to be zero. Thus, when she struck, she didn’t know how many fireballs she should conjure and just launched her largest one-time attack straight away! Instantly, thirty to forty fist-sized balls of fire appeared and the surrounding temperature soared! Her face was illuminated by the light of the fire which made her pale and beautiful facial features more holy-looking.\nThe fear in her mind dropped slightly as the fireballs appeared, then with a wave of her hands, it whizzed toward the mutated zombie in front of her!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCheng Ming’s wind blade was extremely fast! Yet not as fast as the vines supported by Gu Ning’s massive psychic energy! Just in a blink of an eye! The vines were like a giant anaconda, rushed toward the two mutated zombies in an attempt to tie them up! However, the moment the vines encircled around the mutated zombie, they moved too! One of the mutated zombie’s bodies suddenly contracted and then slid out of the vine like a mudskipper ——  the vine was stained in those clear slime and it looked very gross.  Another mutated zombie curled its tail around and stabbed on the vine that bound it with the stinger on its tail! The vine withered away at a speed visible to the naked eyes!\nGu Ning watched in shock as her vines became withered all of a sudden and then were wrenched away by the mutated zombie. Her expression was gloomy as she stared at the two mutated zombies while warning it out to the rest: “Watch out for its tail!”\nThe others subconsciously glanced over and after seeing Gu Ning’s withered vines, they all felt a chill running down their spines.\nAs soon as the two mutated zombies escaped, they snapped off the ceiling and hung their tails in an arc-like scorpion, aiming their stingers on their tails at Gu Ning. Their limbs paddling rapidly and using the slime on their bodies as lubricants, they darted over toward Gu Ning immediately!\nWhen Gu Ning saw that she wasn’t able to hold them back, her powers surged again and dozens of vines broke through the wall once more! This time, the vines changed in form and their tips became incredibly sharp —— under Gu Ning’s control, they all rushed toward the two mutated zombies!\nAt the same time, she shouted to Jia DaoZhang: “Jia DaoZhang!”\nJia DaoZhang’s heart suddenly jumped and seeing that all the other mutated zombies were temporarily held in place, he dashed toward the stairs! As if sensing that their prey was trying to escape, one of the two mutated zombies in front of Gu Ning suddenly made a temporary turn and raced toward Jia DaoZhang!\n“Come back here!” Gu Ning yelled out and two arm-thick vines burst out of the ground, heading straight at that mutated zombie! The two vines wrapped around like a spiral and entangled the mutated zombie’s tail! Gu Ning’s right hand swung vigorously! The vines suddenly rose! It flung the mutated zombie! The mutated zombie hissed and then was slammed against the opposite ward door! It smashed right through the door and was thrown into the ward!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJia DaoZhang took one last look and then hurriedly quickened his pace and rushed toward the third floor.\nMeanwhile, Fang Fa, who was on the third floor, was forced to the dead end of the corridor by this mutated zombie. He was struggling to dodge the stingers on the tail from the mutated zombie with his speed ability! However, with the extremely limited space to move around, Fang Fa was soon caught by the mutated zombie! The tail stabbed straight at Fang Fa! He was unable to escape! The moment the tail thrust toward him, his hand reached out like a bolt of lightning! He had actually managed to grab onto the zombie’s tail! The stinger on the tail was less than ten centimeters away from his brow at that moment, and he could clearly see some clear liquid oozing out from the frighteningly pointed tip ——\nHowever, although he had a death grip on the tail, the clear slime on it acted as a lubricant, and Fang Fa gritted his teeth to hold on for his dear life. He was unable to stop the stinger from inching its way toward his brows——\nJia DaoZhang ran all the way up and saw Zhang XiaoBai lying limply on the wall and was startled! Then he saw Zhang XiaoBai looking at him with surprise and joy, his eyes winking at him desperately. Seeing that Zhang XiaoBai was not in danger of dying, for the time being, Jia DaoZhang was relieved and instantly understood Zhang XiaoBai’s meaning, he hurriedly rushed over in the direction Zhang XiaoBai had pointed! Soon he saw the back of the mutated zombie, as well as Fang Fa with a flushed face while holding on desperately at the tail of that mutated zombie! Jia DaoZhang was first taken aback when he saw this, and Fang Fa finally noticed Jia DaoZhang standing there. Seeing that he still had time to be surprised, Fang Fa broke down and called out: “Quick help me! ! ! !”\n“Coming! Coming!” Seeing the critical situation, Jia DaoZhang gushed out his psychic power wildly! At the same time, his arms spread open! In a flash, dozens of ice prisms were formed between his two hands! He instantly shot them at the mutated zombie’s body!\nThe mutated zombie heard the commotion and was furious! It hissed a few times, but instinct forced itself to withdraw its tail that was attacking Fang Fa! Then it defended itself against the ice prisms behind it. As soon as the tail slipped out of Fang Fa’s hand, Fang Fa felt his knees go weak and almost fell to the ground. Yet he knew that this was not the time to relax and saw the mutated zombie had fled to the ceiling to avoid the ice prisms. At once, he moved his body! And charged toward the knife at the front of the corridor which the mutated zombie had previously smacked it away!\nThe battle on the second floor was also treacherous at this point, as those mutated zombies were wrapped in those clear slime that allowed them to glide across the floor without a care in the world at a rapid pace. Moreover, they could roam on the walls and ceilings, and they seemed to know what Gu Ning and the rest were capable of. They didn’t even fight them head-on and just wandered around, coldly waving that flexible tail that looked like another living thing. Under such circumstances, Gu Ning could only barely hold back the two of them.\nCheng Ming’s wind blades were incomparably sharp, yet the slime on those mutated zombies was not only lubricating, but it also served as a defence for their bodies. A single wind blade would at most make a small cut on the body of the mutated zombie. Furthermore, the speed of the mutated zombies was so fast that even Cheng Ming’s dozen of fast wind blades could only hit them with two or three strikes. It did not deal too much substantial damage which made Cheng Ming annoyed. After all, even Cheng Ming, who had several times more psychic energy than ordinary special abilities users, could not withstand such a long period of consumption of power.\nCompared to Cheng Ming, Brother San’s situation was even less optimistic as he was inferior to Cheng Ming in terms of both the quantity and speed of his attacks. Cheng Ming could still attack the mutated zombies but Brother San was the one being attacked!\nHe put up an earth shield with his right hand and kept raising it to block the mutated zombie’s tail attack. In the meantime, he could only spare one or two earth spikes to attack while most of them were directly swatted away by the tail. Moreover, the earth shield he had conjured could withstand at most three attacks from the mutated zombies. After three attacks, he had to reinforce it with his powers again and such consumption of powers was rather painful for Brother San. He had prepared a transparent crystal core in his left hand, which he would use to replenish his psychic energy when it was half depleted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn the contrary, Huang MengYao’s battle was somewhat surprising. The mutated zombies seemed to be afraid of fire, and before those fireballs could get closer, the mutated zombies retreated far away. They were very wary of Huang MengYao and they did not dare to approach her rashly. They emitted uneasy hissing from time to time, yet they also refused to leave that easily. Huang MengYao knew by now that they feared her fire, and her fear of them was instantly reduced by half. While attacking the mutated zombies, she was able to take some time out to help Brother San in blocking, which made Brother San very grateful and at the same time envious of her special ability.\nSimultaneously, Xiang Yi and Xiang Xu were forged by the four of them into a protective circle, shielding them firmly behind their backs.\nXiang Xu pursed her lips, mentally blaming her spiritual power for not being able to use it for the attack so easily. However, at the same time, she was keeping a close watch on the battle. Once she found anyone in danger, she would activate a spiritual attack at all costs ——\nIn the overview of the battle, although the five mutated zombies could not cause substantial damage to Gu Ning and the others, they were still being held at bay by them. Besides, the zombies were rarely exhausted, while Gu Ning and the other psychic energy were constantly being depleted. Even if they replenish their psychic energy, the time would come when they are completely depleted. Not to mention that for Gu Ning, every bit of psychic energy consumed was non-replenishable, which was just like bleeding blood for her!\nAs Gu Ning thought of this, her eyes glowed murderously!\n===============================================================\n(T/N: The previous posting was met with the site maintenances so had to repost the chapters again~ Hope you all understand! Thank you! Hehehe and my editor had caught up with the chapters.)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "84": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-84/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning’s murderous aura rose, this battle had made her realize that although her power was powerful in long-range attacks, she hadn’t developed them long enough. Thus she wasn’t very skilled in manipulating them and her accuracy was limited, and it wasn’t as handy as her own limbs. Gu Ning decided to risk her own life, so she tightened her grip on the knife in her hand and at the same time mobilized her psychic power. Two small arm-thick vines suddenly arched up from the concrete in front of her feet and then quickly wrapped around her calves, supporting her up! Gu Ning manipulated the vine and leaped straight up. Then she sprinted toward the mutated zombies!\nThe mutated zombie saw Gu Ning rise in the air and raise its head at her. Its eyes were tightly closed but Gu Ning could feel it was staring at her. There was not much fear in her heart at the moment and she just went ahead.\n\n\n\nThe mutated zombie sensed danger and took a look at Gu Ning before turning around and fleeing! However, Gu Ning didn’t give it the chance to do so, and directly manipulated the vines to entangle around it again! The moment the vine had wrapped around it, Gu Ning didn’t give the mutated zombie a chance to use its slime and escape from its bonds again. With a thought, the tip of the vine became steeply sharp and lifted before stabbing down viciously towards the mutated zombie’s body!\nSeveral vines were stabbed directly into the mutated zombies’ body and with a sharp cry, it tried to struggle for its life! Although the vines had penetrated the flesh of the zombie, they were not pierced deep enough to stop it from moving. It seemed that it was about to break free after such a difficult catch. The mutated zombie’s tail tried stabbing on the vines again like previously——\nGu Ning’s gaze was cold and stern as she raised her right hand! Several more vines broke through the ground! No matter how flexible the mutated zombie’s tail was, it was still attached to its body. The vine followed the tail and all the way to the tip before plunging down the tail hard into the ground, pinning the tip of the tail to the floor!\nSeeing that the mutated zombie was completely restrained, Gu Ning no longer hesitated. Gripping her knife tightly, she aimed at the mutated zombie’s head and charged down from the ceiling!\nThe mutated zombie tilted its head up, although its eyes were sealed, Gu Ning knew it was looking at her. She looked sternly while her lips moved slightly, mouthing out: “Got to hell.” Then she dropped from the air and onto the floor on one knee, the long knife in her hand had pierced deeply through the top of the mutated zombie’s head and plunged into the ground.\nFrom its brain, bright red blood like that of humans was oozing out. The mutated zombie’s body, which was still struggling, twitched twice before it completely stopped moving.\nWithout pausing for a moment, Gu Ning pulled the knife out of the ground and swung it vigorously to the left! The long knife in her hand immediately flew toward another mutated zombie that had just crawled out of the ward!\nThe mutated zombie was so badly hurt by the fall just now that the slime on its body had dried up quite a bit. Just when it crawled out of the ward, a knife was thrown at it! Instinctively, it raised its tail and swiped at the knife! Gu Ning’s strength was incredibly strong, and it was hard to estimate the lethality of the knife when it was thrown with full force and the sharpness of the blade. The mutated zombie relied on the defensive ability of its tail and swung toward the incoming long knife. The force of the long knife instantly severed the mutated zombie’s tail when both forces collided!\nWith an extremely miserable hiss! The severed tail snapped to the ground and was still writhing in a very disgusting manner.\nThe mutated zombie had lost its most advantageous attacking weapon and was screaming in pain. It had completely lost its previous “cunningness” and went berserk, recklessly paddling its limbs toward Gu Ning in an attempt to kill her!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning laughed coldly in her heart, she was afraid that it would escape but she was not afraid to face it head-on. She manipulated the vines under her feet to retreat sharply, while several more vines broke through the ground and headed straight for the mutated zombie! The mutated zombie was even faster than ever and when it saw the vines were coming, it swerved and changed direction! It actually went around Gu Ning and climbed up toward the ceiling! It was extremely fast at that moment! Even Gu Ning’s vines were a minute slower, and with a wave of her hand, the long knife that had fallen to the ground was swept up by the vines and brought to her hand. She stared closely at the mutated zombie, watching its direction of advancement, and suddenly she saw an alarming sign! When she looked down, the mutated zombie was on top of Brother San’s head instantly! Brother San was desperately defending himself against another mutated zombie and was unaware that another mutated zombie was creeping up on top of him silently! Its mouth was wide open and was about to pounce on Brother San!\nGu Ning was shocked! Shouting out: “Brother San! Get back!” At the same time, her power surged wildly! Brother San heard Gu Ning shout and the strong image Gu Ning had usually built up came in handy! Brother San backed up sharply without the slightest hesitation! The moment he stepped backward, several sharp-tipped vines sprang up from where he had been standing, like a couple of sharp bamboos, and shoot straight up with extreme strength! They met with the mutated zombie that was dropping down in the mid-air!\nPffft —— the sound of a sharp object being driven through the flesh and blood rang out! Followed by the mournful howl of the mutated zombie!\nIts entire abdomen and chest were penetrated by vines, the tips of which were pierced directly into the ceiling. Its blood flowed down the vines as the body slowly descended, the hissing became even more violent every time it lowered a bit. The three remaining mutated zombies hissed in response, but there were more of a hint of fear in that hiss while in addition to the anger——\nGu Ning grabbed her knife and stepped forward without hesitation. She swung her knife and slashed off the head of the mutated zombie. Her purlicue was a little numb but she tightened her grip on the knife even more.\nThe remaining three mutated zombies were much easier to deal with now.\nAfter finishing another one, Gu Ning handed the remaining two mutated zombies over to Cheng Ming and the others while she prepared to go to the third floor in search of Fang Fa and Jia DaoZhang. Halfway there, she saw Fang Fa coming down with Zhang XiaoBai on his back and Jia DaoZhang trailing behind them with a bloody gash on his face.\n“How is Zhang XiaoBai doing?” Cheng Ming and the others also gathered around them after they had finished with the two remaining mutated zombies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBy this time, Zhang XiaoBai had been fed a transparent crystal core but was still weak as he crouched on Fang Fa’s back while his face was ghastly pale.\nGu Ning saw that he looked very uncomfortable and was afraid that he would have an unforeseen circumstance, so she stepped forward and prepared to heal him. However, Zhang XiaoBai shifted to the side to avoid her and said in a broken voice: “I’ll be fine after resting, don’t waste it……”\nGu Ning first froze for a moment, then forcefully grabbed Zhang XiaoBai’s wrist. Without knowing the reason, she could actually feel that the psychic energy in his body had completely dried up, and channelled a wave of healing psychic energy into his body. It didn’t take too long for the greyish-blue colour on Zhang XiaoBai’s face to fade and was just slightly pale.\nGu Ning withdrew her hand and then said to them: “I’ll go up for a while, you guys wait here for me.”\nThen she trotted up to the third floor.\nThe body of the mutated zombie was seen in the corridor, a whole row of ice prisms had been stabbed into its body. Its head had been pierced by an ice prism and the crystal core had been dug up while the tail was left on the side. Gu Ning walked to one of the wards and took out a bedsheet. She pulled it into several strips before walking over to the tail. Gu Ning used her knife and sliced off a finger-length of the stinger and wrapped it in the cloth in a few rounds.\nAfter heading down, Brother San and the others had already dug out the crystal cores of the five mutated zombies below. Gu Ning went over and sliced off their stingers and wrapped them up in layers of cloth and placed them away in the space.\nThe others were a little puzzled at Gu Ning’s actions and Fang Fa asked: “Gu Ning, these things are so poisonous, what are you collecting them for?”\n“I don’t know, but maybe they’ll come in handy later.” Since they had already reached the second floor, Gu Ning also collected everything useful into the space, and after checking around for a while, she announced: “Let’s leave.”\nThe others were waiting specifically for this sentence from Gu Ning as they were really frightened by those few mutated zombies. Fortunately, Zhang XiaoBai was only injured and not in danger of dying. The others had only consumed a very large amount of their psychic energy but Gu Ning in contrast suffered the greatest loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWithout looking back, the group of nine went downstairs and ran all the way out of the hospital without further delay, driving straight back to the colony.\nOn the way, Gu Ning took stock of the spoils of the battle this time. Apart from the useful medicines and various medical equipment, there were also six crystal cores from the mutated zombies, plus the previous hunt, making a total of seven coloured crystal cores. It could be said that it was quite rewarding and luckily Zhang XiaoBai was only injured in such a dangerous situation.\nHalfway back, they ran into the same group of people who had asked to be in their truck on the way over. They were currently being chased by two evolved zombies, and when they saw the truck drive past, they all ran ecstatically in their direction, shouting for help.\nBrother San had his eye on the crystal cores from the two evolved zombies, and after parking the truck, he struck out the two zombies and then naturally went to dig for the cores.\n“Hey! Wait! We lured the zombies here. No matter what, we should get half of it right?” One of the men said indignantly.\nWithout waiting for Brother San to speak, the young man who had come out to deal with Brother San before tugged the guy and frowned: “Huang Bin, what are you doing, they are the ones who brought us over and just saved our lives.”\nThe man called Huang Bin, however, said with a straight face: “Zhong ShuJun, we didn’t come here for free. And these two zombies were lured here by us and they just simply killed it. Is it just too much for us to ask for just one?”\n“Forget it Huang Bin.” The only girl in the group also spoke up.\n“It’s none of your business?! You don’t have any say in this?” Huang Bin instead glared at the girl and scolded her in a vicious voice.\nA flash of anger flashed across the girl’s face, but she didn’t make a sound.\nBrother San ignored him, dug out the crystal cores and put them in his pocket, then turned around and walked toward the truck.\nHuang Bin hurriedly chased after him and cursed: “F*ck you! Are you deaf? I told you to leave one behind!”\nBrother San didn’t even turn his head back, but a row of earth spikes broke out behind him! Woosh, woosh, woosh! It was lined up right in front of the man called Huang Bin. If he had taken just one more step forward just now, his foot would probably have been pierced through right now ——\nHuang Bin was so frightened by the sudden row of earth spikes that he fell to the ground. His face was pale because earlier, Brother San had agreed to let them get on for a ride with just a piece of bread and he had thought that Brother San was an easy character to be dealing with……\nThe young man named Zhong ShuJun watched the military truck drive away and said to Huang Bin with a frown: “Huang Bin, next time you do that again, we’ll have to part our ways with you.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHuang Bin’s face paled and he no longer was as arrogant as he had been earlier.\nZhong ShuJun watched that military truck fade out of sight and couldn’t help but slowly tighten his grip on the crystal core in his pocket. If he ate this crystal core, would he be as powerful as they were……\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Happy Belated Birthday Anazu!

    "85": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-85/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe first thing Gu Ning did when she returned to the colony was to hide in the bathroom and enter the space first. Sure enough, the ocean level was a little further away from the waterline.\nGu Ning left the space and counted the spoils from the past few days to split with everyone else. There were seven mutated crystal cores in total and only five were coloured. They got more transparent crystal cores instead, roughly around forty or so and twenty of them were harvested in a day. This proved that more and more evolved zombies were spawning.\n\n\n\nCurrently, they had ten special abilities users in the team and Brother San suggested that the transparent crystal cores were to be shared equally among the ten. The remaining coloured crystal cores and mutated crystal core were all given to Gu Ning for safekeeping, which no one else had any objection to.\nIt was still early as they had left the colony at 10:30 am and now it was just 2 pm.\nAfter having lunch, those who were sleepy took a nap, and those who couldn’t sleep coaxed Gu Ning to take out a deck of poker from the space. All of them actually gathered around to play cards and bet with the transparent crystal cores.\nShe also took out a set of mah-jong for Mother Gu, Hong Jie, and the rest to play with.\nThe soldiers who were not on duty at the main gate, gathered around to watch the fun while munching on the peanuts and melon seeds in their hands. The room was buzzing with activity.\nFather Gu was not interested in playing cards so Gu Ning brought out the books collection she had swept from the supermarket for him to pick from.\nGu Ning glanced around at the lively scene in the house and for a moment, she felt as though she was on the other side of the world.\nShe smiled then walked out of the room and went to sit near Father Gu on the stairs in the front yard where some children were still practising holding guns.\nThe pistol weighed around six or seven pounds, several other children could not hold it for more than two minutes before they had to put it down for a long rest and these were because they wanted to perform in front of Gu Ning. However, Wu Sen, the little chubby boy, Zuo You, and the little girl, Wo Wo, were extra serious. The three of them were also the oldest in this group of children and Wo Wo was even a female. The tenacity they had shown made Father Gu proud and praised them a lot.\nBy now the weather had turned cooler, but the three children were sweating like it was raining. The chubby little boy in the middle was dripping sweat down to his trousers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe sweat dripped into their eyes, causing them to blink incessantly. Yet they refused to lower their guns down, and Gu Ning couldn’t bear it, took a towel over to wipe the sweat off their faces.\nLittle chubby Zuo You was the first to put it down, Wo Wo withstand a dozen seconds longer but Wu Sen was the one who held it for another two minutes or so before lowering the gun down with his trembling hands.\nGu Ning waved at the three of them and instructed: “Come here you three.”\n“I’ve been practising for a long time today, I can hold it for over ten minutes from the start!” Wu Sen explained with some anxiety and frustration after walking over. He was afraid that Gu Ning would think that he could only last for that short period.\n“That’s good enough.” Gu Ning looked at him with encouraging eyes as well as the other two, Zuo You and Wo Wo, who were staring at her with anticipation too: “Both of you are very good too.”\nZuo You smiled and his cheeks rose which made his eyes look even smaller. He scratched his head and replied with shyness: “They’re way better than me. If they hadn’t encouraged me, I wouldn’t have been able to keep up, hehe.” After saying this, he asked carefully and tentatively: “When can we really learn to shoot from a gun?”\nGu Ning thought for a moment and answered: “When you can hold the gun for twenty minutes.”\nZuo You were suddenly a little upset: “I can only carry it for eight minutes at most for now.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWu Sen, however, had a happy face: “Then I can learn how to shoot tomorrow!”\nGu Ning smiled and nodded: “As long as you can hold the gun for twenty minutes, I’ll have someone to teach you the shooting.”\nWu Sen nodded then cautiously glanced at Gu Ning, when he saw that Gu Ning was not that difficult to approach like usual, he gathered the courage to ask: “I heard from them that you have the best marksmanship, sister. Can you teach us instead?”\nWo Wo and Zuo you were also staring at Gu Ning nervously, afraid that she would refuse.\nGu Ning looked at their expectation and nervousness on their faces, thought about it, and replied: “I will if I’m free.”\nA few older children who were resting a little further away were glancing over. When they heard Gu Ning’s reply, the way they looked at Wu Sen and the other two changed a little.\n“Don’t practice anymore, go inside and let Jia DaoZhang get you some ice to reduce the swelling.” She instructed as she saw their swollen arms.\n“I’m not tired yet!” Wu Sen said with bright eyes: “I’ll be able to continue practicing after resting for a while.”\nGu Ning rejected: “Combine work and rest. You’ve enough training for today, if you get injured from training, it won’t be worth it.”\nAlthough Wu Sen was still slightly reluctant, he nodded obediently and followed: “Alright then.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfterward, Father Gu led the way into the house to find Jia DaoZhang.\nGu Ning glanced at the young children at the side who had picked up their guns and continued practicing before she headed over to the infirmary.\nBefore reaching the infirmary, she could see from afar that there were many people gathered at the entrance of the infirmary.\nShe saw Gao Yue standing in the doorway being accused of something. Instead of going there straight, Gu Ning stood right next to the infirmary on the stairs and watched.\nA middle-aged man pointed at Gao Yue and shouted: “Aren’t you a doctor?! His leg is injured, why don’t you treat him!”\nGao Yue still had that same expressionless look and replied coldly: “I am a doctor, but I don’t have the medicine. If you have the medicine, I can certainly treat him.”\nThe man lashed out in fury: “And why were you able to treat those people previously?! All doctors should show love like parents! How can you be so profit-oriented? What did they give you?! It’s just a few pieces of bread! Have you lost your conscience for those?!”\nGao Yue didn’t even show a hint of anger, she just stood on the steps and looked down at the middle-aged man and stated the facts: “I helped them because they provided the medicine. The goods are what they pay me for. I am not married nor am I pregnant so I don’t know what it means to be a parent. I am a human being, not a god, and have to eat to live. Even before the apocalypse, you have to pay the hospital to get the treatment. Naturally, I will cure him if you have the medicine. If not, please don’t stand in the way and block my business.” She was wearing a dirty, unlikeable white coat, and with her hands in her pockets while honestly describing her thoughts of helping people with their illnesses as a form of business. Even Gu Ning was a little surprised by that.\nThe middle-aged man gritted his teeth but was unable to retort, so he just cursed, then dragged the other guy and limped away slowly.\nThe remaining onlookers, seeing that the drama had ended, scattered unwillingly.\nGao Yue glanced at Gu Ning who was standing on the stairs and asked: “Looking for me or are you here to watch the show?”\nGu Ning smiled faintly: “Looking for you.”\nGao Yue raised an eyebrow and replied: “Come in then.” Then she turned around and entered back into the room.\nGu Ning walked down the stairs and then entered the infirmary.\n“Water is a scarce resource now, so I won’t be pouring it for you.” Gao Yue said before sitting down and crossing her legs naturally. Gu Ning couldn’t help but realise that she had long slender legs just like Zhuang Chen. Gao Yue gestured to Gu Ning after she had sat down: “Take a seat.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt was only after Gu Ning had settled down that she continued: “What’s the matter? Go on.”\nGu Ning was too lazy to beat around the bush and asked her: “I just came to ask you a question. If there was a team that could provide you with enough medicine and supplies that you would never need to worry about, would you be willing to join?”\nGao Yue stared at Gu Ning and pointed out in a somewhat meaningful manner: “It seems that you guys have gained a lot from this hunt. But never needing to worry about supplies is such a big promise in the current world.”\nGu Ning smiled, unable to deny it.\nGao Yue was silent for a moment and studied Gu Ning very seriously before she finally answered: “I only have two requests.”\nGu Ning made a gesture for her to continue.\nGao Yue stated: “Firstly, if you failed to achieve the two points you promised earlier, then I can leave the team at any point.”\n“Secondly, I hope that we can keep the relationship between us as a simple employment.”\nGu Ning was a little surprised by Gao Yue’s second request, but on second thought, she understood why Gao Yue had stated that. Gu Ning thought for a moment before agreeing: “No problem.”\nGao Yue frowned, somewhat surprised by Gu Ning’s quick decision. Undoubtedly, the terms Gu Ning had stated were a great temptation to her, she stood up and after glancing around and said: “I don’t have any luggage to pack, let’s leave now. Boss Gu.”\nGu Ning chuckled and then stood up.\n“By the way, I have something I wanted to ask you.” Gao Yue asked as they walked out: “I want to know how you’ve healed Fang Fa’s injury?” She had examined Fang Fa’s injury that day and it would be difficult for the wound to heal itself without any stitches. Whereas today, she had witnessed Fang Fa walking very freely on his feet like everything was normal.\nGu Ning revealed a smirk before answering: “I don’t think I would need to explain this to you if it’s just an employment relationship.”\nGao Yue raised an eyebrow in surprise, not expecting Gu Ning to return her words so quickly.\nThe others were not surprised at all when Gu Ning had brought Gao Yue over. After all, the terms which they provided were very tempting and others would fight for it.\nGao Yue was shocked to see a room full of people laughing and playing cards, munching on melon seeds and peanuts. She lost her composure momentarily before turning over to Gu Ning and asked: “It’s time for you to show me your strength, Boss Gu.”\nGu Ning called out to Huang MengYao: “MengYao, bring her to our warehouse for a tour.”\nHuang MengYao smiled faintly: “Dr. Gao, come with me.” Then she led Gao Yue to the second floor.\n“NingNing, why is this Dr. Gao calling you Boss Gu? It sounds so weird?” Mother Gu hadn’t missed the conversation while playing her mah-jong.\nGu Ning chuckled slightly before replying: “If she likes it, let her be.”\nShe didn’t even tell them what Gao Yue had requested from her as she didn’t think it was necessary. Even if it was just an employment relationship, Gu Ning was sure that Gao Yue wouldn’t find a better boss than her.\nAfter coming down from the second floor, Gao Yue’s gaze on Gu Ning had changed slightly. In a room, on the second floor, it was piled with medical equipment and various medicines that Gu Ning had purposely stacked in there, while the other room was filled with supplies.\nBrother San stared at his mah-jong while raising his volume and ordered: “Hey hey hey! I say, let’s all introduce ourselves! So that Dr. Gao would know us! Hey! Don’t touch that! I want to pon that three of bamboo!”\nLuo Long was the first to respond and said: “My name is Luo Long, I’m a Gold element ability user.”\nZhong Xu sneered: “Tsk, Luo Long, you are always showing off your special ability. Why do you even introduce yourself as a Gold element ability user when people just asked you for a simple introduction —— Dr. Gao, we know each other but let me introduce you again. My name is Zhong Xu, a Water element ability user!”\nLuo Long scolded: “Hey! How can you be so shameless, Zhong Xu?!”\nWith a room full of people bickering, Gao Yue managed to know everyone in the room.\nBrother San concluded: “From now on, our health is in your hands, Dr. Gao!”\nGao Yue smiled unexpectedly.\nGu Ning secretly laughed in her mind that Gao Yue was probably shocked by this room of special abilities users instead.\n“Oh right, where are Jia DaoZhang and Fang Fa?” Gu Ning suddenly asked.\nBrother San replied: “Out for a walk probably.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Alright end of this week post.

    "86": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-86/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOriginally, Jia DaoZhang was forced by Fang Fa to go out for a stroll around the colony with him. Fang Fa looked at the survivors whose lives were countless times harder than theirs and felt very uncomfortable. Seeing his gloomy look and knowing that he used to be a policeman, Jia DaoZhang knew exactly what he was feeling now and dragged him away. Yet, when they were passing through the gates, they met a couple of small groups who had come over from Zhongnan City in search of their relatives. Thus, they received an important piece of information from them.\nThe two of them returned to the dormitory and immediately told Gu Ning about the information.\n\n\n\nIn the evening after having their dinner, Gu Ning asked Huang MengYao to send all the children back to their rooms. Everyone else gathered and held a meeting.\nGu Ning nodded at Jia DaoZhang, signalling him to speak up.\nJia DaoZhang cleared his throat for a moment before speaking up: “The current situation is that the Zhongnan side had built a large base with the support of the capital. There are around 100,000 survivors with aircraft and artillery to defend against the zombies. I’ve heard they have electricity, and the management is better. We can’t defend this small colony for long, so before we are surrounded by zombies, I suggest that we move to the Zhongnan Base.”\nThis information from Jia DaoZhang had silenced the room of people.\nThe soldiers all glanced at Brother San but Cheng Ming, Huang MengYao and the few others focused on Gu Ning.\nGu Ning glanced at Brother San and then Hong Jie: “Brother San, Hong Jie, what are your thoughts?”\nHong Jie didn’t expect Gu Ning to ask her opinion on this, but she also perked up at once and replied after looking at the crowd: “Then I’ll say what I think. If we are leaving, then it’s better to leave now instead of later. That base is large so it will definitely attract more survivors. If we don’t go there soon, I’m afraid there won’t be a place for us. If we’re going, then we need to be there before it’s too late.”\nBrother San explained his thoughts too: “I’m a bit sad to leave, but with just a few of us, we won’t be able to defend this place. As Hong Jie said, if we really want to leave, we might as well go before it’s too late. Living in a big base is definitely better than being worried here all the time, furthermore, we can leave the kids at the base without worries when we go out and kill zombies.”\nGu Ning nodded as what they said was correct. Here, they had to always be on guard in case the colony was besieged by zombies at any moment. Even when they go out to hunt, they can’t put their minds at ease and have to leave a good number of special abilities users to guard their place. If they went to a larger base, then they would be able to spare more people to go out together when hunting for crystal cores. As of now, the hunt for crystal cores and gaining actual combat experience is way more important.\nTheir chances of success from breaking out from a siege of a few mutated zombies relied on the tacit understanding between their teammates that they quickly built up during their recent battles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere were already enough supplies inside her space to last them a year.\nThe subsequent supplies Gu Ning collected had at least several millions worth of weapons in her space, the other world could also be considered as her spare warehouse too.\nThe most important thing now was to ensure the safety of Father Gu and Mother Gu, as well as the people she wanted to protect.\nAs Gu Ning thought of this, she glanced at a room of people where some were vaguely nervous and some were looking at her with expectant gazes and said: “In that case, Brother San, Hong Jie, let’s leave tomorrow morning at dawn.”\nBrother San was a little stunned; “So soon?”\nGu Ning smiled a little: “Didn’t you also say that it was better to leave as early as possible? And since it had already been decided, then there is no point in staying behind for a few more days.”\nHong Jie agreed with a smile: “Then tonight we shall rest well, and get up in the morning to pack and leave!”\nFrom the beginning till the end, Gao Yue didn’t make any comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWith this decision, some people were happy and some were slightly upset.\nShi Tou was one of those who did not want to leave: “Why must we go to Zhongnan when we are staying here so well…”\nZhang XiaoBai poked his head and made fun of him: “You are really a stone head, tonight’s meeting was in vain. All you have to know is that this is a strategic shift for us, why do you have to think so much!”\nShi Tou was still a bit sullen.\nExcept for a few, most of them were actually vaguely looking forward to the Zhongnan Base, curious about what the so-called large base was like. They also longed from their hearts to be able to blossom in a broader world.\nAfter everyone had dispersed, Gu Ning found Gao Yue and gave her a coloured crystal core.\nEven Gao Yue, staring at the crystal clear bead in her hand, was in shock: “This is the…… crystal core?” Every day, she saw people from the colony go out, a hundred of them went out and only ten to twenty had returned, all for the little thing she was holding in her hand right now. She knew that this was the crystal core and that there was a certain probability of developing psychic powers after eating it. Her gaze was a little fiery, but more than that, she was very puzzled.\nGu Ning smiled and just stated: “I’m really a generous boss, aren’t I? I wish you success then.” After saying these words, Gu Ning turned and walked away.\nGao Yue slowly gripped the crystal core in her hand, her gaze following Gu Ning’s back view with some odd emotion rising in her heart.\nEarly the next morning, the children watched the adults go around with their business, and were a little surprised. Most of them were a little frightened to know that they were about to leave the colony. They had almost forgotten the dangers of the outside world because they had been living so peacefully for some time. However, now that they were suddenly leaving what they deemed as a warm and safe “home”, they felt scared from the bottom of their hearts. A small part of that fear was subconsciously fearing that they would be left behind by Gu Ning and the others. After all, no one wants to bring a child on the road with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn the midst of most of the children’s fears and anxieties, Wu Sen, Zuo You, and Wo Wo tagged along in helping the adults with arranging the pots and pans while they were waiting for Gu Ning to store them back in the space. The three children were busy like little adults. There were times when Wo Wo couldn’t help but steal a glance at Xiang Xu, who was sitting on the sofa without having to do anything, and her hands which were carrying things gained more strength.\nWhen Hong Jie greeted the children and got them onto the bus, the previously nervous and terrified children immediately cheered.\nWhen a few children passed by Wu Sen who was standing at the side with Zuo You and Wo Wo, they cursed in a low voice: “Bootlicker!”\nWo Wo’s face was flushed and about to go over and argue with them but Wu Sen stopped her: “Let them be.”\nZuo You joined in and said in a hurry: “Yes. Let’s just do our own thing and not cause any trouble.”\nWo Wo replied resentfully: “But they are badmouthing us! I will go and tell Sister Gu Ning!”\n“Don’t!” Zuo You interjected quickly: “The adults have a lot of things to do, so don’t add on to their worries for us. It’s not like you’ll lose any meat if you get belittled.” Then he continued with a small grin while clutching his tummy; “I’ll have to thank them if I really lose some meat!”\nWo Wo was so upset but when Zuo You said that, she broke into chuckles and nagged: “Look at your fat body, be careful of being caught and eaten! I don’t know how you could not lose any weight at all.” They had heard from the soldiers about the story of cannibalism and often used it to scare Zuo You.\nZuo You replied in agony: “I was born fat, what else can I do about it.”\nXiang Xu stood in the doorway, looking at the three of them smiling together and she was slightly envious of them.\nXiang Yi smiled and nudged: “Xiang Xu, go join and play with them.”\nHowever, Xiang Xu just grunted: “I’m not a child anymore.” Yet her gaze was still staring at the three of them.\nThere were a total of three vehicles.\nThe two military trucks were in the front and at the back while the big lorry was in the middle.\nAlthough they left very early, several people noticed their departure. The children were taken with them so it was not hard to guess that they were leaving the colony instead of going out for their daily zombie hunting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter all the three vehicles had left.\nThe news immediately spread throughout the colony and the residents were all in a panic at once.\nAlthough Brother San and the others had not deliberately said that they were there to protect them, they had always been the ones guarding the gates. Everyone knew that as long as those special abilities users were here, they would always be at the frontline of whatever happened, and they were their spiritual support in the colony every day. Yet, now that they had left, the residents felt that they were exposed to great danger, and the collapse of their spiritual support brought them endless fear.\nThere were quite a few quick-witted people who ran to the courtyard where Brother San and the rest had lived. Immediately, they found quite a few supplies that were left behind and they didn’t know whether they had left it unintentionally or deliberately by Brother San.\nOnly Lin MeiFeng, after looking at the empty courtyard, started cursing: “F*ck it! No wonder your big sister suddenly became so kind and sent us two bags of food last night! In the end, it was just to chase us away! They’ve all left!”\nJiang Yu just stood there with a stiff expression as she watched Lin MeiFeng curse.\nLin MeiFeng stopped cursing as she saw a man come out of the building cheerfully while holding a bag of bread! She darted over to grab the bread from the man’s hand: “Everything in here is ours! Who told you to take it? Put it all down! Put it down!”\n“Where’s this crazy b*tch came from! Get out of my way!” That man was dying with hunger and had just picked up a bag of bread, how could he withstand someone from snatching it away? He kicked and punched Lin MeiFeng and knocked her to the ground.\nLin MeiFeng fell to the ground, whining and cursing while slapping on her legs: “Why didn’t you two come over and help! You both are driving me crazy! All the things here are ours! And the both of you just watched them taking away our stuff! Oh my God! Why did I marry such a loser like you? Even your own sister disowned you!”\nHowever, no matter how she belittled them, Jiang YueZhou and Jiang Yu stood aside with a stony expression, without uttering a single word nor going to help her.\nGu Ning and the others were unaware of these things. They were on their way to Zhongnan at the moment.\nWhen Luo Long and the others stayed behind, they followed Hong Jie’s instructions and opened a few windows in each carriage so that the people inside could get some air but also check the situation outside. It was better than the previously enclosed carriage, but the comfort level was still lacking, so Jia DaoZhang chatted about hijacking a bus along the way which would be more comfortable for their journey.\nBefore the apocalypse, journeying to Zhongnan and Jinyong would take around five to six hours by train, or seven to eight hours by car. However, right now it was the post-apocalyptic world, and the road towards it was full of unknown dangers.\nEach of them prayed in their hearts for a smooth journey, but they also knew at the same time that it would be impossible.\nGu Ning didn’t look out of the window at the rapidly receding scenery, but stared into the far distance in the direction of Zhongnan, wondering what it would be like there? What would be waiting for them ahead?\n===============================================================\n(T/N: This suppose to be Friday update hahaha. Sorry for the delay.)\n(Editor: De Vile)\n\n\n",
    "87": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-87/\n(T/N: This is a dedicated chapter for Shawn L. Thank you for your kind and generous support! It means a lot to us =) Hope you enjoy this little chapter~)\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere were many roaming zombies on the road, and when they heard the sound of the trucks coming, many of them gathered around. The crashing sound of the trucks hitting the zombies was endless and with the corpses on the ground, the trucks were shaken badly.\nGu Ning and the adults were used to it, but not the children. It was unsure whether they were scared by the zombies coming at them or was the truck moving too bumpy which made all their faces paled, while some even vomited through the window.\n\n\n\nAfter about two hours of intermittent driving, the road ahead was blocked. Gu Ning peeked out of the window and saw at least 30 to 40 abandoned cars in front of them.\n“it’s blocked up ahead, so we’ll have to go around.” Brother San said: “I’ve met a car accident when I went to Zhongnan previously, we just have to back up a bit and there’s a little road near there. It just goes around it and was just a slight detour. There’s nothing we could do about it now.”\nListening to what Brother San had explained, all three trucks made a turn and drove back.\nIt took about 20 minutes to find the small road that Brother San had said and it was only big enough for two cars to cross at the same time.\nThe road was also paved with concrete, but in many places, it had been crushed by the overloaded large trucks that usually pass by it. The road was full of potholes and sinkholes that test the driver’s skills. Fortunately, this side of the road was off the usual traffic and there were very few zombies on the road. It took no more than 20 minutes of driving before they encountered a zombie walking around in the field, and they had driven away before it could even catch up to the road.\nIt was almost noon when the weather, which had been sunny, suddenly started to rain. In a short while, raindrops as big as beans were beating on the roof of the trucks, and the sky was covered with dark clouds, accompanied by thunder and lightning. They had to find a village to stop in for the time being for safety reasons.\nDaishui village was a small village surrounded by mountains and rivers. Before the apocalypse happened, there were about a hundred families with a population of about four to five hundred people.\nGu Ning found a house at the entrance of the village. One of the walls of the house was covered with vines, the colour of which was very green that looked slightly special as compared to other plants which were already preparing to enter winter.\nAfter alighting from the trucks, Luo Long knocked on the door for a while but no one answered. Thus, he just banged the closed door of the house opened.\nThe stench of rotting corpses came hitting them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere were two corpses on the floor of the living room.\nThe corpses looked very strange, their bodies were unusually dry and thin, with only a layer of wrinkled human skin wrapped around their bones. Their clothes look empty on top of the corpses, seemingly without any flesh or blood on their bodies. One of which was facing the doorway, hands outstretched toward it. The fear of the moment still seemed to linger on its face, yet, there was no visible blood around either of them, not even bite wounds from the zombies……\nLuo Long and the rest had seen lots of horrible and disgusting corpses, but when they saw the two corpses on the ground, they inexplicably felt extremely frightening and terrified, and chills ran down their backs.\nAt the urging of Brother San, the two corpses were wrapped in a blanket from the bedroom and buried in a hole in the back courtyard.\nAfter making sure that there were no other corpses in the house before they let everyone else in the trucks enter.\nThe wall behind the sofa had a picture of the family hanging on it. They only found the corpses of two people in the house, and judging by the clothes they were wearing, they must have been the middle-aged couple in the photo but the girl in her twenties standing between them was nowhere to be seen.\nIt was a well-off family, with the house fully furnished with all the electrical appliances and nicely decorated.\nIt was just about noon, so they started cooking, hoping that the rain would stop after they had finished their meal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter finishing and washing their dishes, the rain showed no sign of stopping. It had gotten heavier with lightning and thunder striking nonstop. The wind was howling so strong that the windows were clanging.\n“It looks like we’ll have to spend the night here today.” Brother San decided after taking a look out of the window: “How come it’s raining so heavily just like that.”\nThe sky was dark as though it was five or six o’clock in the evening.\nThe clattering rain mixed with thunder gave an inexplicable chill down the back, especially when a lightning bolt filtered in through the window. It instantly illuminated the whole room with a flash of brightness, then those furniture cast weird shadows before plunging back into darkness immediately.\nLuo Long rubbed the goosebumps on his arms and asked Huang MengYao to send two fireballs out to illuminate the room.\nGu Ning checked her watch and the time was 2 pm.\nShe had to be back by 6 am on that side of the world, which meant that she could only stay over here until 8 pm at most.\nThe night soon arrived and by 6 pm, it was raining lesser and just drizzling. However, it was already too dark so they stayed overnight, had dinner, and played cards for a while. After washing up, they laid on the floor with the quilts Gu Ning had taken out from the space. It was strange that all the windows in the house were mostly broken and vines were poking in. Jia DaoZhang grabbed a vine and even joked about it: “It’s quite an elegant house.” As it was not raining too heavily, they spread on the floor some distance away from the window. After blocking the front and back doors, they all lay down to rest and get ready for the journey tomorrow.\nThis time Gu Ning had a room on the first floor to herself for the convenience of leaving. The window in this room was also broken, and vines were poking in through the broken window.\nAfter locking the door behind her, Gu Ning went back to the space with a thought and then crossed over to the other side of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt was still 6 am on the other side of the world, so she changed her clothes, then pulled open the door and walked out.\nIt was 1 am in the middle of the night in the post-apocalyptic world.\nThe temperature plummeted at night because of the rain during the day. Yet, they didn’t have to worry about freezing as both underneath and on top of them were wrapped with thick quilts. Most of them who had gone through the bumpy ride during the day were already in a deep sleep. Luo Long lay with his eyes closed under the warm blanket, but his mind uncontrollably remembered the two corpses in the living room during the day. No matter how much he tried to hypnotise himself, he couldn’t sleep and the rains got heavier again.\nWhile Luo Long was being annoyed, he suddenly heard a rustling sound —— a small sound that he would never have heard if he had been asleep, but it was so late into the night while the slightest sound would be amplified, and surprisingly he was still awake ……. At first, he thought it was someone who had rolled over, but he couldn’t help and hold onto his breath and listen tentatively …… swish …… There was a sound of something scraping against the ground, faintly and vaguely from time to time. Luo Long’s heart thudded, then he opened his eyes. It was late at night, the sky was glooming with dark clouds that covered the moon. Without a trace of light, nothing could be seen.\nRight at that moment! A bolt of lightning streaked across the sky! With a flash! The whole sky was illuminated including the room ——\nAt the same time, it also illuminated the pale face of Luo Long.\nThe empty room had somehow been covered with those vines that grew outside of the house, crawling over half of the ceiling …… on the walls …… on the floor ….. everywhere except where they were sleeping! —— In that flash of light, Luo Long even saw that a vine was slowly poking its way over!\nThe lightning flashed for just a moment, and the house was instantly plunged back into darkness.\nLuo Long even wondered if he was dreaming that he even pinched himself so hard that he almost screamed out in the darkness. Under the huge shock, Luo Long was almost scared half to death, just desperately gritting his teeth to keep himself from screaming out and then shaking Zhang XiaoBai madly, who was sleeping beside him.\nZhang XiaoBai was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awakened from his dream by the violent shaking. He opened his mouth to curse, but before he could curse out, a hand was pressed over his mouth.\nLuo Long’s very light shush came into his ears, making Zhang XiaoBai instantly realize that something was going on.\nLuo Long moved closer and whispered to Zhang XiaoBai with a shiver: “Xiao, XiaoBai …… those vines seem to have changed, like mutated …… all, all over the house……”\nZhang XiaoBai couldn’t really hear what he was saying and only vaguely heard about what mutation and the house……\nBefore he could figure out what Luo Long had said, a sudden shriek sounded from the other side!\nIt was the post-apocalyptic world! Everyone’s nerves were not completely relaxed even in their sleep, and such a shriek instantly woke everyone up!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai instantly got up from the ground, then raised his hand, in which lightning twisted around him and illuminated the whole room at once! Then everyone was at a loss for words as they looked at the scene before them in shock.\nJia DaoZhang stammered: “What, what’s going on here?!”\nAs far as they could see, all the open space except for their quilts were covered with strips of vines, and those verdant leaves looked extremely eerie at the moment!\nThe vines that were still in motion seemed to be startled by the sudden appearance of light, and after a strange pause, the vines started moving!\nThe ceiling with an uncountable number of vines suddenly spread rapidly towards them!\nLuo Long suddenly linked everything in his mind as he pointed at the fast-moving vines and shouted in horror: “It’s these things! These are the things that did to the two corpses in the living room!”\nAt the same time as Luo Long shouted these words, the sound of children screaming in terror suddenly rang from the room next door where Huang MengYao, Gao Yue, Hong Jie, and more than twenty children slept in!\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Thank you once again Shawn L. for your kind gesture! <3 Hope you enjoy this dedicated chapter!)\n\n\n",
    "88": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-88/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBoth the words that Luo long had just uttered in unparalleled terror and the screams that rang from the next door had caused everyone in the room to break out in a cold sweat.\nThinking of Father Gu and Mother Gu who slept in a separate room, Brother San was even more anxious and commanded in a hurry: “Fang Fa, Zhang XiaoBai! Go over and protect Teacher Gu!”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, they retreated toward the entrance of the room, as if sensing that they were going to escape, the vines suddenly picked up the speed and spread toward them!\n“Ah!” Luo Long let out a scream! Somehow the vines that had fallen from the ceiling, wrapped themselves around his neck in a deadly grip! Dangling him upward!\nCheng Ming had already unleashed his wind blade, swoosh swoosh swoosh! The vines that were binding Luo Long broke with a loud snap as he fell from the ceiling and onto the floor. Before he could cry out in pain, he grabbed the knife underneath the quilt and slashed at the vines wildly.\nSeeing that the room was already covered with vines, and it was not easy for several big men to move around in here, Brother San ordered: “Let’s get out first!”\nThe few of them quickly rushed out, while Cheng Ming covered their escape with his countless wind blades as his psychic energy surged out wildly. It swooshed and slashed at the vine that was dancing madly, filling the ground with vines that had been severed by the wind blades —— Once the vines were cut off and fell to the ground, blood actually flowed out of the broken vines, which looks shocking and horrifying —— The vines, however, seemed to be infinitely extendible, and the ones that were cut down, regenerated quickly!\nCheng Ming finally exited the room and shut all those vines behind the door as soon as he rushed out.\nYet as the door had just closed! All that could be heard was a boom! The vines had twisted together and broke a hole in the door! Then countless vines poked out of the hole and twirled toward them!\nNext door, there were three adults, Huang MengYao, Gao Yue, Hong Jie, and more than ten children were sleeping in the room. Huang MengYao conjured a wall of fire with both hands to protect Hong Jie, Gao Yue, and the children behind her. Similar to the next room, this room was also full of vines but they seemed to be afraid of fire like the mutated zombies from the previous day. For a while, the vines were all in the mid-air, but didn’t dare to reach over the firewall!\nA room across the hall was the place where screams rang out from time to time!\nOnly a few children were sleeping in that room which included Xiang Xu, Xiang Yi, Wu Sen, Zuo You, Wo Wo, and a few other children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nXiang Xu was the first to notice the vines sneaking into the room, and she put up her spiritual barrier immediately but was still a step too late. Those vines quickly rolled up the ankles of three children and dragged them out of the window! One of them was Zuo You!\nThe three children were grabbed by the ankles and dragged outside, screaming in terror. Zuo You was even shrieking like a pig being slaughtered: “Help! ! ! There’s a ghost! ! ! ! Help! ! ! !” As he screamed, he clawed desperately at the ground, trying to find something to hold onto, but the ground was nothing but vines, so there was nothing for him to grab.\nThe other children including Xiang Xu were so startled by these things that they didn’t know what they were and reflexively retreated toward the door!\n“Zuo You!” Wu Sen and Wo Wo shrieked at the same time! The first thing they did was to jump out to save him!\nXiang Yi didn’t manage to catch them and let them run out of the spiritual barrier! Wo Wo and Wu Sen simultaneously lunged out and grabbed Zuo You’s both hands, then gritted their teeth and held on for their dear life and refused to let go.\nZuo You were already crying in fear, he was crying and shouting: “I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m dying!”\nThe three children managed to hold onto each other tightly and the vines were held back by them for a while. Wu Sen quickly pulled out a dagger from his pocket and trailed down from Zuo You’s feet to the vines. He grabbed the vine that was wrapped around Zuo You’s ankle and started cutting it —— However, not before he had finished cutting the vines off! Some more vines came rushing in through the crack from the window and coiled straight toward Wu Sen!\nWu Sen acted as if he didn’t see the vines twirled toward him and just speeded up the movement in his hands, gritting his teeth and cutting back and forth on the vines. The dagger was given to him by Gu Ning and he took it out every day to sharpen it when he had nothing else to do. He had sharpened it so finely that it actually cut away the vines that were dragging Zuo You! He was so happy! Before he could tell Zuo You to get up quickly and run to Xiang Xu! The vines that came in through the window coiled around his thighs and his entire lower body at once. Without waiting for Wu Sen to cut them with the dagger in his hand, they yanked him hard and flung him out! The force was tremendous! In one swoop, he was pulled up and carried over the window sill! The moment he tumbled off the ledge, the vines had wrapped his body like a cocoon and dragged him away ——\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Wu Sen! ! !”\nWo Wo and Zuo You shouted in panic, both of them getting up from the floor with reddened eyes and about to lunge to the windowsill! Then they were jerked back by two hands.\nBrother San dragged them with both hands out of the house to retreat.\nWo Wo shouted in anxiety: “Uncle San! Wu Sen has been captured by those things!”\nBrother San didn’t speak a word, holding the two of them in his hand with a death grip as he retreated out of the house while conjuring an earth shield from time to time to block the vines that kept attacking them.\nShoved the two constantly struggling Zuo You and Wo Wo into the hands of the soldiers at the back and ordered: “Look after them!”\nZhang XiaoBai also ran down with Father Gu and Mother Gu from the second floor.\nBrother San didn’t see Fang Fa who supposedly to go with him and asked at once: “Where’s Fang Fa?!”\nZhang XiaoBai ran down panting and answered: “He’s gone to find Gu Ning!”\nOnly then did Brother San realise that he seemed to have missed Gu Ning all along. Seeing that those vines kept banging against his earth wall that was blocking the doorway which would not last for long. He instructed his soldiers: “You guys, take them back to the truck first, pay attention to safety!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWo Wo shouted: “No! We’re going to save Wu Sen! Where is Sister Gu Ning?! Sister Gu Ning will help us to save Wu Sen!”\n“Listen!” Gao Yue suddenly warned coldly: “If you don’t want anyone to die because of you, then shut up and get into the truck obediently for us!”\nEven Zuo You were stunned by Gao Yue’s sudden cold tone and could only tug Wo Wo’s arm and consoled: “Wo  Wo, let’s get in the truck. We can’t save Wu Sen even if we stay here. Don’t worry, Sister Gu Ning will help us to get Wu Sen back.”\nAlthough Wo Wo’s eyes were reddened, she could only nod her head.\nThe soldiers then protected Father and Mother Gu, Hong Jie, Gao Yue, and some frightened and paled children as they withdrew from the house.\nFang Fa first knocked on Gu Ning’s door several times and found that there was no movement inside and the door was also locked. He vigorously banged and shouted Gu Ning’s name but there was no response. In desperation, Fang Fa directly raised his knife to destroy the lock and once the lock was broken, he pushed in but the room was empty!\nHe ran to the window and glanced down, yet there was nothing to be seen from the pitch darkness. He shouted twice for her but there was no response from Gu Ning and instead, he attracted more vines! He hacked away at the tangled vines then quickly retreated from the room and started searching in other rooms.\nThe people below only saw Fang Fa open the doors with great speed, but never sighted Gu Ning at all and they all had a sense of ominous feeling!\nFang Fa had searched all the rooms on the second floor with great speed then rushed down the stairs. His face was pale and spat out the news that shocked everyone: “Gu Ning is gone!” The temperature at night was very cold, but at this time, his forehead was covered with sweat: “I’ve searched all over the place and still couldn’t find Gu Ning. The door to her room was also locked……”\nJia DaoZhang yelled: “What are we waiting for! Let’s go and save them!”\nEveryone had subconsciously believed that something could happen to any of them, yet never once had they thought that something would happen to Gu Ning. When the facts were presented in front of them, they had no choice but to plan for the worst. Since they had to save people, they had to uproot all those vines that were causing the problem.\nHowever, after the soldiers had exited, the vines had blocked the front door as well. Countless vines emerged from each room like cold-blooded snakes crawling out which sent chills down their backs.\nSeveral children and a soldier were being dragged away by the vines. The thought of the two corpses, drained of flesh and blood, sent shivers down everyone’s spine.\nBrother San’s expression was grim as he watched the vines overlapping in layers and then instructed Fang Fa: “Fang Fa, you’re the fastest, try and see if you can recuse those people out first.”It was dangerous to move through so many vines alone, but those who had already been dragged away by the vines were in an even more dangerous situation at this point.\nFang Fa gripped the knife in his hand, not even hesitating, wiped a handful of sweat off his face, and nodded solemnly: “Alright.” As long as he thought that Gu Ning might be wrapped into a layer like a cocoon by these disgusting vines, then be drained of flesh and blood, he couldn’t wait a moment longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe moment he finished speaking, his entire body dashes toward the second floor like a bolt of lightning! The vines on the ground twisted and turned as if they were alive, and when a foot stepped on it, those vines would extend countless branches trying to bind the foot. Yet Fang Fa was extremely fast! Those branches had only just sprung up and he had already moved two metres away!\nZhang XiaoBai licked his cracked lips, his hand entwined with bursts of lightning: “Alright friends! Let’s get to work too!”\nPreviously, it was pitch black and all of them were confused when they suddenly encountered the mutated plant for the first time. However, after a brief moment of panic, the special abilities users had completely calmed down. With Huang MengYao’s fireball illuminated the whole place and was clear for them to see, they all started to use their fighting abilities normally!\nZhang XiaoBai grabbed a vine that flipped up from the ground and twirled toward him, then he extended the lightning in his hand through that vine instantly! The whole vine trembled violently like a mudskipper being electrocuted! The green leaves on the vine were rapidly charring at a speed visible to the naked eye —— finally, it emitted a strong burnt smell ——\nCheng Ming’s wind blades had already been sent out in a form of a wind hurricane! As he thought of the dangerous situation Gu Ning could have gotten into, his psychic energy surged out wildly, doubling the number of wind blades once again! With a harsh cracking sound, even the speed of the vine’s regenerating power was no match for such an intense wind blade attack from Cheng Ming! The blood splattered out from the broken vines which almost seem like a rain of blood showering the whole place!\nOn the contrary, Jia DaoZhang let out a miserable howl: “Cheng Ming, watch out for your special moves! You’re splashing blood all over me!” Although he was blaming Cheng Ming verbally, he immediately mobilized his psychic energy and stepped on a vine on the ground, and then his psychic power surged out —— the vines, from the point of his feet, quickly frosted over and then froze completely in the ice, unable to move.\nBrother San’s earth ability and Zhong Xu’s water ability were less powerful than those trio mutated abilities powers. When facing this kind of mutated plant, their abilities were considered as support attack while helping the trio in diffusing some attack and at the same time, using their knives to slash at the vines that were closer to them.\nAlthough Huang MengYao’s fire abilities were highly lethal, they were all in the house now, so if she really burn it down, it may cause a situation of accidental injuries. Fortunately, both animals and plants had a natural fear of fire, so Huang MengYao just held up a wall of fire to block away from all the attacks while her teammates unleashed their powers with confidence and at ease!\nShi Tou, who hadn’t performed much, finally showed the terrifying battle power of his special ability this time! Without dodging, he grabbed the vines that were reaching toward him, wrapped a few quick loops of them around his left arm. Then he grabbed the large vine with his right hand, let out a low cry before mobilizing his psychic energy which instantly increased to more than ten times his strength! All that could be heard was a wave of crunching snap! The vines that had been clinging to the ground with their little suction-caps-like tentacles were pulled up hard from the ground! The large handful of vines in Shi Tou’s hand had ripped up an area of at least three metres wide of vines! At that moment, Shi Tou roared again! His psychic power rose again! Those snapping sounds rang out in a wave, plak plak plak plak plak plak —— the vines that were yanked up by Shi Tou were broken! Blood splattered everywhere, making the whole scene extremely gory!\nThey were all stunned for a moment!\nOnly in an instant, they’ve all returned to their senses. The exit on the first floor had been completely wiped and they began to quickly clear a path to the second floor with only one thought in their mind at this point.\nThose who had been dragged away by that mutated vines must hang on and wait for the rescues!\nGu Ning, hold on —— you must not die!\nFang Fa was desperately cutting the “human cocoon” that were tangled in vines with the knife in his hand. The drops of sweat mixed with rainwater dripped from his forehead to his eyelashes and into his eyes were causing burning pain. However, as if he couldn’t feel it, he continued struggling to untangle the vines. His palms were already torn and bloodied from the intense friction but he didn’t seem to feel any pain at all. At that moment, he had only one selfish thought in his heart, hoping that this one must be Gu Ning, must be the living Gu Ning——\nBeside him lay two children who had been untied from the vines. Their faces were bluish and their eyes were staring blankly at the blacken sky which was raining. They didn’t blink even when the rain dripped into their eyes and rolled down from the corners as if they were tears streaming down from their empty eyes. Their thin chest didn’t rise or fall as they had completely stopped breathing.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Thank you all for your kind patience in waiting.

    "89": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-89/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe vines were so damaged by the psychic powers that they were unable to regenerate for a while.\nThe others all carefully lowered the cocoons wrapped in vines that were hanging from the walls. Then they used their knives to quickly unravel the vines.\n\n\n\nThe bodies of a soldier and four children were lying next to each other on the ground as they were dragged away by the vines during the confusion. It was too late for the crowd to save them and with each cocoon unravelled, the crowd’s hearts twitched while the dark sky was still drizzling as if they were attending a funeral.\nGao Yue knelt on the ground and gave artificial respiration and CPR to the children one by one but she could only watch in vain as their bodies turned cold under the rain.\nOnly one cocoon left that remained unravelled.\nFang Fa’s hands began to tremble uncontrollably.\nThen he was pushed aside by Cheng Ming, who took over the knife and began cutting the vines hurriedly.\nWhen Wu Sen’s ghastly white face emerged from the vines, Cheng Ming’s hand shook uncontrollably. Fang Fa was the closest, and when he saw that the last cocoon was not Gu Ning either, he couldn’t help but feel his legs go weak and he sat down in the mud at once while his face paled with misery.\nWo Wo and Zuo You pounced over and hugged the pale Wu Sen and started crying.\nEveryone was silent except for the sound of the two small children crying and the raindrops falling on the bodies. Everyone’s faces were drenched, not knowing if it was from the rain or tears.\nSuddenly, a violent coughing fit sounded out of nowhere! Everyone was stunned.\nGao Yue was the first to react and quickly pushed aside the frightened and frozen Wo Wo and Zuo You. She lunged forward, plucking away all the vines that were wrapped around Wu Sen’s body. Wu Sen coughed for a while before he slowly calmed down, then opened his eyes. His hand was still holding the dagger tightly while his body was covered in blood from cutting away those vines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt turned out that after he was bound, luckily he had held onto his small dagger and managed to cut a small opening in the vine for breathing, thus he wasn’t suffocated alive.\nWo Wo and Zuo You cried and laughed when they saw that Wu Sen was still alive.\nGao Yue hurriedly got someone to carry Wu Sen back to the truck.\nAfter checking the surrounding area thoroughly there was still no sign of Gu Ning.\nThose vines had been uprooted.\nIt was impossible to describe how everyone felt when the ground was dug up and saw the roots of those vines sprouting out of a girl’s body.\nThose vines were rooted in the girl’s corpse, making the corpse look as if it were alive, in flesh and blood undried, eyes tightly closed. On closer look, it was actually the girl in the photo of the family of three.\nJia DaoZhang stared at it pitifully: “What a tragedy.” Then recited silently the transcendental sutra under his breath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWorried that the bodies of the dead children and soldier would be eaten by other mutated plants for their flesh and blood, they had no choice but to get Huang MengYao to set a fire and burn them on the spot. Then they picked up some ashes and keep them in a mineral water bottle before heading back to the truck.\nThe girl’s ashes were buried next to her parents in the hope that they might meet again in the afterlife.\nOnce they got back into the truck, all of them were drenched and the group felt like they had just been through a nightmare.\nAfter so many days without casualties, five people had died in just one short hour. One of them was a soldier named Wang Yang whom they spend a lot of time with and the four children with innocent smiles….\nMoreover, Gu Ning, whose life and death was still uncertain.\nThe atmosphere in the truck was heavy as if it had been filled with concrete, making everyone breathless.\nFather Gu, Mother Gu, Hong Jie, and Gao Yue, as well as those children who were extremely frightened, were all in another truck.\nThey hadn’t told Gu Ning’s parents about her disappearance yet.\nJia DaoZhang glanced around everyone in the truck and suddenly asked strangely: “Why do all of you look as if Gu Ning is dead?!”\nThe crowd was drawn to his words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJia DaoZhang continued: “Have you all forgotten what happened in that basement at Eleventh Square last time?”\nWhen Jia DaoZhang mentioned the incident, Brother San, Cheng Ming, and the rest were all shocked. They might have been in turmoil because of the cold corpses of their close comrades and they were too preoccupied with their concerns and worries. Right now when Jia DaoZhang had pointed it out, they almost immediately recalled what incident Jia DaoZhang was referring to.\nIt was not the first time that Gu Ning had disappeared without notice like this, it had already happened once in the basement of Eleventh Square!\nAlso after a few hours, Gu Ning had reappeared in the basement again.\nThat means Gu Ning might not have met with any mishaps at this point but might have passively returned to that mysterious space of hers again!\nAfter thinking this through, Brother San and several others immediately looked much better, with almost ecstatic expressions appearing.\nHowever, apart from the few people who witnessed Gu Ning’s disappearance last time, Fang Fa had no idea what Jia DaoZhang was referring to. Yet when looking at the instantaneous burst of hope on the faces of others, Fang Fa realised that there was still a chance for things to turn around and he looked at Jia DaoZhang and asked eagerly: “Jia DaoZhang, what is going on?”\nFang Fa was a kind person and had always been respectful toward Jia DaoZhang. Although they had not known each other for a long time, they had a good relationship. Thus, at this moment seeing his face full of urgency, Fang Fa must be very worried about Gu Ning’s safety. Jia DaoZhang silently swallowed his customary words of teasing and went straight into a brief and concise account of what had happened that day at Eleventh Square.\n“What happened that day is only known to those of us who were there. Gu Ning instructed us to keep it a secret, so now that we’ve told you, you should keep it to yourself.”\nFang Fa didn’t care about all this, but eagerly ascertained and asked: “In other words, it is highly likely that Gu Ning is now back inside that space of hers?”\n“Eighty to ninety percent certainty.” Jia DaoZhang nodded and explained: “You had also said that Gu Ning’s door was locked, which means that she didn’t go out. Besides, although today was a dangerous situation, these mutated vines were not particularly powerful, and if we were able to get out alive, how could Gu Ning be trapped with her strength? In all probability, it was just like that day when she was unknowingly transferred into the space while she was asleep.”\nThis was a convincing analysis by Jia DaoZhang, and those who were worried about Gu Ning could finally relax their knotted brows after hearing this.\nJia DaoZhang continued: “Everyone let’s change out of our wet clothes to avoid catching a cold. Put your worries aside and stay in the truck for the night, maybe Gu Ning will appear once again in the morning.” Then he also instructed Luo long: “Xiao Long, you go and inform Mr. Gu and the others, don’t let them worry about it.”\n“Why me…” Luo Long complained smoothly under his breath, but in a flash, he jumped up from his seat, got out of the truck, and rushed into the rain to report to the other trucks.\nAfter hearing that analysis from Jia DaoZhang, the others in the truck looked much more relaxed. It was really hard to imagine how they were going to explain to Teacher Gu and the others if something happened to Gu Ning. It was only then that they realised that Gu Ning had taken a vital place in their ranks and hearts, and their first thought when they realised that Gu Ning could be in distress was that everything was over. They had unconsciously developed a sense of dependence on Gu Ning like she was their pillar of support in their group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang Yang suddenly commented: “If Gu Ning had been here, maybe there won’t be so many death tonight.”\nHe had meant to say that if Gu Ning had been here, all those people might have been rescued.\nBrother San immediately changed expression and was unspeakably serious: “You should not say such words when Gu Ning returns.”\nEveryone present was not stupid, and when Brother San stated this, everyone knew what it meant.\nThis couldn’t be Gu Ning’s fault, but Brother San was just afraid that she would carry those blame on her shoulders when she saw the situation after she had returned. Also, if even they thought so too, then Gu Ning would feel even worse in her heart.\nZhang Yang knew that he had spoken wrongly, hastily pursed his lips, and stopped talking.\nBrother San didn’t reprimand anymore and just ordered: “You guys go get some rest first after changing your clothes. Cheng Ming, Zhang Yang, tonight we will trouble the both of you to keep watch with me. Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu, you two go rest now and take over the second half of the night to keep watch.”\nBy this time, the rain had subsided and it was only drizzling. The three of them changed into dry clothes, each took a quilt and climbed onto the roof of the truck, while Brother San conjured an earth shield to shelter them from the rain.\nThe three men sat on top of the truck, all subconsciously glancing over to the house, and kept thinking that Gu Ning would pop out from it.\nBrother San was slightly guilty, after just a few days of peace and quiet, his sense of crisis had faded a lot. If tonight wasn’t for Luo long’s warning, more people would have died. If he had sent a few more people to keep watch beforehand, then those mutated vines might have been discovered as soon as they crawled into the window.\nCheng Ming suddenly spoke up as he stared at the house: “Now even those vines had mutated and became man-eating monsters. What the hell do you guys think the world will become in the future?”\nZhang Yang just clutched the gun in his hand without knowing how to answer that question.\nBrother San was also silent, just staring at the house in the darkness. For the first time, there was some confusion in his eyes as just like what Cheng Ming had pointed out, even those vines had mutated and were coming out to eat people, what the hell would this world become in the end? Will the human race not be able to escape the fate of extinction in the end?\nGu Ning, who was in another world, was oblivious to all of these. While they were fighting to the death against those mutated vines, she was enjoying her breakfast in the comfort of absolute safety, without any fear, looking out of the window at the dawn while relaxing her tensed nerves.\nMeanwhile, the post-apocalyptic world was in infinite darkness.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Finally managed to complete a chapter. XD Thank you all for your kind concern <3, my wrists are getting better but it’s a long process for it to be fully recovered. I will still try to hit the update schedule for next week so yup, please wait and stay tuned XD hahahaha. Love ya all! and let’s see what would happened in the next Zhongnan aka South Central Base for Gu Ning and her friends!)\n\n \n\n",
    "90": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-90/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning hadn’t noticed anything wrong when she walked out of the space, however, when she pushed the door open and walked out, she was completely frozen. Looking at the broken vines and dried blood everywhere, Gu Ning almost felt a sense of dizziness at that moment. She had no time to think about what had happened in her absence last night and directly rushed madly to the next room. That was her parent’s room, yet it was empty except for the broken vines and blood splat all over the floor. She just felt her legs go weak but steeled herself to check around the room and make sure there weren’t any remaining limbs from the human bodies that were left behind. After a quick confirmation glance, she rushed out of the room to the first floor.\nAll the doors were broken, severed vines and dried blood stains indicated how fierce the battle had taken place last night. Gu Ning searched the whole house and hadn’t seen a single person yet.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, she was relieved that she hadn’t found any human limbs laying around.\nMaybe they had all retreated safely last night.\nGu Ning had to take a deep breath and prep herself mentally before walking out of the front gate. Soon, she saw the three trucks parked not far away and Zhang XiaoBai who was standing on the roof of the truck, looking in her direction.\nThe moment Gu Ning saw Zhang XiaoBai, he had also spotted her. Zhang XiaoBai first frozen for a moment, rubbed his eyes a little incredulously, and then yelled: “Brother San! ! ! ! Gu Ning is back!” While screaming, he stomped vigorously on the roof of the truck.\nSoon all the people in the truck came running out.\nGu Ning also ran over, the moment she saw Father Gu and Mother Gu, she almost kneeled while cold sweat broke out on her back. At this time, she felt a cold chill down her back as the wind blew, and her heart had almost burst out in fear of losing them.\nGu Ning glanced around at everyone who had gathered around her with surprise and concern written on their faces. She felt that a thousand words were stuck in her throat and she didn’t know how to express it to them.\nBrother San seemed to notice the state of mind Gu Ning had at this moment and just patted her shoulder and instructed: “Gu Ning, let’s get into the truck first and then chat later.”\nGu Ning nodded and then everyone got into the truck together.\nBrother San first updated her about the battle that had taken place last night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning listened and felt a pang of fear afterward while was somewhat thankful: “Fortunately, there were no casualties……” Halfway through the sentences, Gu Ning caught a slight change in Brother San’s expression, and her heart suddenly thumped. Her gaze swept over the faces of the others, all of them involuntarily avoiding her eyes. Gu Ning finally focused on Brother San and asked slowly: “…… who died?”\nBrother San took a puff on his cigarette and replied in his low voice: “Four kids died and one of my soldiers.” After saying that he forced out a laugh: “What’s so unusual about a dead man now. Although we are sitting here right now, who knows if we’ll be the next one. There’s nothing to feel bad about.” Yet his smile looked way worse than crying.\nGu Ning fell into a long silence and only spoke up after a long while: “If I had been there yesterday, perhaps they wouldn’t have died …… Even if they only had one breath left, I would have been able to bring them back to life ……” Her head was lowered while her blonde hair fell over her eyes so that no one could see her expression clearly. Her voice remained unchanged but her shoulders which had always been upright was now slumped.\n“Gu Ning.” Brother San pressed his hands on her shoulders, forcing her to look up at him as he said solemnly: “You’ve already done enough, more than enough.”\nGu Ning, however, just smiled bitterly, then leaned against the wall of the truck and explained suddenly: “I didn’t disappear just last night, I disappeared every night after you guys had fallen asleep. For every day that passed, I have to return to the space the next night, and is a must for me to do so.”\nEveryone in the truck glanced at each other upon hearing the explanation. Zhang XiaoBai opened his mouth but in the end, he didn’t ask what was the reason for returning.\nSince even Zhang XiaoBai didn’t ask, the others would be even less likely to ask too.\nGu Ning felt very grateful deep in her heart that they didn’t ask any further and then stated: “From today onward, no matter under what circumstances, we have to make sure to get someone to keep a lookout.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San nodded: “This is also negligence on my part. Everyone, go have something to eat and rest. Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu, you two have worked hard and probably didn’t sleep well last night either, so go to the side and catch some winks if you need.” They were in a big truck and the floor was covered with cushions. Just like Brother San had said, most of them were not able to sleep well last night, and only when they saw Gu Ning return, then did they feel at ease. Within a few minutes of lying down on the cushions and covering themselves with blankets, they all fell asleep and their snoring was like thunder ringing out in the whole carriage.\nThe truck started driving.\nThey still had to make good use of the time to get to the Zhongnan base.\nPerhaps because of this calamity, the journey afterward was much smoother than they had expected and it actually took them only half a day to enter the city of Zhongnan.\nAccording to the information that Jia DaoZhang had gathered, the Zhongnan base was established on the south campus of Zhongnan University. It was backed by the valley of the mountain and surrounded by a river in the east.\nNot knowing the actual direction, they took a long detour and only managed to reach the Zhongnan base after four o’clock when it was already dark.\nCompared to the small colony they had in Jinyong, this Zhongnan base was at least ten times bigger. Although the sky was very dark, Gu Ning’s vision was not affected by it.\nThe three trucks were illuminated by a very strong beam of light before they got within twenty metres of the base.\nThen a horn sounded.\n“Those who are in the truck listen up! No survivors will be accepted in the base at night! Come again tomorrow dawn to enter!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEveryone in the truck looked at each other and was a little surprised, but there was nothing they could do, and had to find a place to park the trucks.\nBrother San began to plan out the men for tonight’s watch: “Tonight, the first half of the night will be Luo Long and Shi Tou. You two will guard the first half and the second half, Fang Fa and Zhang XiaoBai will take over.”\nAs soon as he finished planning, Jia DaoZhang became slightly displeased: “Hey Lao San, are you looking down on the poor old me? Don’t think that because I’m older than you, my body will be worse than yours. Zhang XiaoBai was already on watch last night, so tonight I will take over instead.”\nBrother San understood that he was just being considerate to his juniors, so he smiled and didn’t bicker with him.\nThe night was peaceful, with cars driving over intermittently in the middle of the night. All were parked outside the base and waited obediently due to the rules of the base.\nThe next day at 8:30 am at dawn, everyone in the truck had to wake up and went out to wash up with their cups and basins.\nMore than a dozen other cars had been parked here since yesterday night.\nBy this time, those people in the other cars were all awake and got out of their vehicles to check around. When they saw the young and old who were washing up at the truck, they were all frozen in their tracks.\nWater was already a very rare resource at this time, and although there were water abilities users, the probability of developing special ability users was about 1 in 10,000 and for water ability users were potentially 1 in 100,000.  Moreover, most of the water abilities users treasure their psychic energy a lot and were all very stingy with their energy consumption except for the necessary needs. It was absolutely impossible to find people like Zhong Xu who was being forced by Brother San to conjure water whenever it was needed. Yet this also made Zhong Xu discover that the more he conjured water, the more skilful he seemed to become at manipulating his water ability.\nFurthermore, water was even more scarce for ordinary people.\nTherefore, imagine how devastated they were to see the long queue of people with cups and toothbrushes washing their faces and brushing their teeth with the water that was so precious to them.\nBrother San and the rest hadn’t noticed anything wrong but when Gu Ning came out with a basin and as soon as she saw how the others were staring at them, she immediately turned around and head back in.\nIt was only then that Brother San and the rest felt something was wrong and they all had a quick wash up before dragging everyone back into the truck.\nGu Ning then commented: “Once we get into the base, let’s try to keep a low profile.”\nBrother San and the rest who had just flaunted their “wealth” accidentally, nodded their heads repeatedly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThen it was time to start queuing up to enter the base.\n“Do you want to bring your trucks into the base?” The man at the gate with a book for registration asked as he glanced at the three trucks.\n“Can we get it in?” Brother San asked.\nThe man replied: “Yes of course. Parking fee is one pound of supplies per month for each car.”\nAlthough now they were very well supplied, Brother San was still a little distressed about the requirement. He gave Gu Ning a side glance and Gu Ning thought for a moment before asking: “Can we submit water instead?”\nThe man’s eyes lit up before agreeing: “Sure, the base now is short of water. 500ml will be equivalent to a pound of supplies.”\nBrother San immediately smiled with joy: “Then we’ll pay with water.”\nThe man pointed to Brother San at the window next to him and instructed: “Just go and pay at the next window.”\nBrother San glanced at Zhong Xu, who then resigned and walked over with his empty hands.\nThe man obviously noticed that Zhong Xu had gone over empty-handed and was instantly surprised: “A water ability user?” Then he immediately recalled that this man had just glanced at that water ability user who had passed by obediently. Back in the base, all the special abilities users were very proud so this man in front of him was definitely not that simple. His eyes glanced at Brother San’s party of twenty to thirty people and his attitude had changed from casual to very respectful while pulling out a few forms from the drawer below and asked: “Please kindly cooperate with me and fill out this form.”\nBefore asking again: “Do you all belong to a team or individual?”\nBrother San replied: “Team, I guess.”\n“Well…… do you all have a team name?”\n“Third…..” He blurted out and was about to say third company but then he stopped after spurting out the word. He glanced back at Gu Ning and seek for her thoughts. Gu Ning just nodded her head in agreement.\nBrother San smiled then replied again: “The Third Company.”\nThe man asked: “Big brother used to be a soldier, right?”\nBrother San nodded his head.\nThe man cleared his throat and then continued: “Here’s the thing, I need to brief you all first. We have over 100,000 survivors in total at our Zhongnan base, and several hundred new people are joining our base daily. Our base will provide a place of refuge, but at the same time, we will be expecting you all to abide by the rules of our base while fulfilling some of the obligations imposed on you by our base. All the special abilities users are responsible for protecting the base. Therefore, all the special abilities users entering the base are not required to pay for any supplies. However, ordinary people have to pay three pounds of supplies. Of course, many people who can’t pay the three pounds of supplies will have to join our base building team. They will have to build our base for free until they had fully completed paying off the three pounds.”\nBrother San nodded in agreement, then glanced at Zhong Xu who had just finished condensing water, and returned. Zhong Xu rolled his eyes and then resigned himself again to go back to that window.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hahahaha poor Zhong Xu. XD well… bigger base, new start again for them. Go Go Gu Ning! Thank you all for reading~)\n\n",

So how many users do you have in your team? Could the member of your team with abilities please come over here and fill out this form.”\nThe man saw a group of them walking over, he felt a little dazed, even his speech was stumbling: “You guys ….. Are all special abilities users?”\n\n\n\nIt had only been a few days since the discovery of crystal cores that could make humans develop psychic powers and the vast majority of people didn’t even know what they look like. Even for their base, which had more than 150,000 survivors and they had recently encouraged people to go out of the base to hunt zombies.\nThe entire base only had a total of more than fifty special abilities users. Although there were intermittent entries of special abilities users entering the base these days, this specific team of thirty people or so actually had ten of them as abilities users?!\nBrother San and the others still had some difficulty understanding the shocked expression on this man. They knew that special abilities users were rare but ever since they had developed psychic powers, the number of abilities users that had appeared from the colony alone, including Bai Lang and his party, had already exceeded ten digits.\nThere was also the team of seven that they had met at the Eleventh Square, they had all developed special abilities too. Moreover, coupled with the probability of developing special abilities in their group, it had led them to overestimate the average people’s probability of developing special abilities by a large margin.\nIf they had known, they would have been able to understand the shocked expression on that man’s face at that moment.\nAfter Gu Ning had filled in her name, age and place of birth, her pen reached the box for special abilities and she wrote down the word space without giving it a second thought.\nWater, Gold, Fire, Earth, Power and Speed element were all common abilities, but Lightning?! Wind?! Ice?! Spiritual?!  He had only heard of these mutated abilities, but there were so many of them appearing at once?!\nThe expression on the man’s face had gone completely out of control.\nFinally, his gaze landed on the last form with Space written on the special abilities box. He froze for a moment and then stared at Gu Ning: “Miss Gu, you are a Space ability user?”\nSeeing that his expression changed, Gu Ning asked: “Is there something wrong?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHe hesitated for a moment, looking at Gu Ning and the others who didn’t know what the problem was. If it were anyone else, he wouldn’t have spoken that much but this group was so strong, if he made friends with them now, then he might be able to ask them for some help in the future.\nAfter deciding on that, he closed the gap with Gu Ning and whispered: “You’d better not reveal your identity as a Space ability user after you had entered the base. You guys probably didn’t hear the latest news that was spreading recently. It is said that if you kill a Space ability user, everything that was kept in the space will burst out of it……”\nHe didn’t continue any further but the reason that he was explaining was clear enough for them to understand.\nThis was a very important piece of information and Gu Ning’s expression changed slightly. Although she thought that her space should be different from those developed by the crystal cores, the others didn’t know about the differences. If the news of her being a Space ability user spread out, it was inevitable that some people would target her.\nShe smoothly pulled the form out of the man’s hand and then very smoothly tore it into pieces while thanking the staff member before filling in her details on the other piece of paper that were given to the general public for registration.\nThe man’s mouth gaped open but didn’t say anything and then just handed out the badges to the other ten people.\nAll the adults filled out the form truthfully.\nWhereas the children just filled out their names under the Third Company team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe staff member also expressed his surprise that the Third Company team had brought so many children on the journey.\nThen he gestured: “Please follow her to the checkpoint for inspection before you can officially enter the base.”\nA young female staff member came out of the small house and led them in.\nAs soon as they left, the staff member at the registration window immediately picked up the walkie-talkie next to him and shouted excitedly into it: “Report headquarters, report headquarters, there is a team entering the base with fifty-three people. There are special abilities users.”\nThe checkpoints were two rather modest sheds that had been improvised.\nOn the female side, there were four middle-aged women in white coats, seated inside while chatting away as they entered.\nAfter seeing someone come in, one of them said with some discontent: “Why is this getting earlier as the day goes by… seriously…” Shoving another impatient glance at them, she continued: “Take off all your clothes. You have to take off your underwear too. We are all women here so a few glances and checks won’t take away a few pounds of meat from you.”\nThere was no compartment or anything and it was just an empty room. The little girls were a bit scared but when they saw Gu Ning take off her clothes first, the rest followed suit.\nSeeing that Gu Ning and the girls didn’t dawdle like the others, even the most impatient middle-aged woman’s expression softened slightly. They were very experienced in examination and after making them turn around, they were being let off the hook without finding any wounds on their bodies. They stamped a red seal of approval on the forms Gu Ning and the girls had brought along.\nAfter they were out, they waited for a little while for the men in the group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang XiaoBai cursed as soon as he came out: “F*ck, the one who examined me must be a faggot! He kept staring at me! He’s giving me creeps!” Zhang XiaoBai rubbed the goosebumps on both sides of his arms as he said: “Look, guys, I’ve got goosebumps.”\nThe others all roared with laughter while making fun of Zhang XiaoBai.\nAfter the two sides had met up, the female staff member took away their stamped forms and led them to another building.\nYesterday, it rained heavily for most of the day in Jinyong, and in the evening, it rained again until the morning. However, the ground was not even wet in Zhongnan city and the sun was lazily hanging in the sky.\nThis building was the management office according to the female staff who works here. New survivors had to report here upon checking in.\nWhen they arrived, a middle-aged man in his 30s or 40s, wearing glasses was waiting for them. As soon as he spotted them, he immediately greeted them and warmly extended his hand to Brother San, who looked like their leader and said: “You all are the Third Company team right? I’m Director Zhong from the management office. Come, come, please do come in.”\nBrother San shook his hand and replied: “Hello, Director Zhong. You can just call me Lao San.”\nThey exchanged a few more courtesies after that.\nThe others were curiously surveying the surrounding before sighting a wall covered with various missing person notices. The post slapped on another post all over the wall and most of them were without photos.\nDirector Zhong finally got to the point: “Our base has a privilege policy for the special abilities users but I would like to ask if your team is planning to stay here for a long term or is just passing through?”\nBrother San smiled faintly: “That depends on whether this base is suitable for us to stay for a long term or not.”\nDirector Zhong cursed in his mind that this Brother San was an old greaser but he replied with a smile on his face: “Brother San, I won’t hide it from you, I came from the capital. Indeed, it’s better than this base of ours in every way but there are more people there. Since there are more people with different abilities gathering there, if your team were to go over to the capital, your team strength would only be considered as average. However, if you decided to settle down here, our base has just started growing recently and is very much valued by the central government as a key support base……”\nBrother San didn’t interrupt him and just listened with a smile before stating: “Director Zhong, we are new here and we don’t know anything. Thus, we aren’t sure if what you’ve told us is true or not, but don’t worry, if this base is really good, we naturally won’t want to leave. You see, we have so many elderly and youngsters plus we look so miserable. Shouldn’t you arrange a good place for us to stay first, right?”\n“Yes, yes, yes.” Director Zhong nodded with a smile then instructed the pretty young girl at the window: “Xiao Yan, pass me the key to the dormitory building.”\nThe girl who was called Xiao Yan, gave a surprising look at Brother San and the others before she got out a set of keys from the drawer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter receiving the keys, Director Zhong showed the way: “Let’s go. I’ll show you the way. You all will definitely be satisfied by the place to stay.”\nAlong the way, several survivors had come out of the tent. Although most of them looked so bad like they were being beaten up, their expression was not as frightened as those other survivors which they had seen on the outside. It was clear that they were very confident about the safety of this base.\nThere was only one dormitory building on this end, a high-class student flat, which rents for 30,000 per year. Around 500 metres away from here were large blocks of ordinary student dormitory yet because the distance was a bit far and the base’s defences were not that strong enough to cover properly. Many people prefer to pitch their tents at the base rather than to live in the student dormitory at the other end.\nMoreover, the number of survivors arriving at the base was still growing by hundreds daily.\nTherefore, many open spaces had been covered by colourful tents.\nDirector Zhong introduced with a smile as he walked: “If you want to live in the building, then you have to surrender a pound of supplies to the base every month. Of course, it’s all free if you’re a special ability user.”\nAs the survivors watched the dozen of people in their party all head to the dormitory, they revealed envious looks and were surprised that the group had so many young children with them.\nThe dormitory building had nine floors.\nThe flat that Director Zhong had arranged for them was on the second floor.\nIt consisted of two bedrooms, one living room, a bathroom, a kitchen and an open balcony.\nThanks to Brother San’s “negotiation” this whole floor was occupied by them.\nIn fact, because of the scarcity of special abilities users and very few ordinary survivors could afford to exchange their supplies to live in the dormitory, there were plenty of empty floors. Since Director Zhong had the intention of making them stay, he was naturally happy to extend this favour.\nDirector Zhong informed them to find him in the management office if they had any problem and then left after bidding goodbye.\nBrother San, Gu Ning and the rest looked at each other with a relieved smile and a feeling that they had finally settled down.\nThe flats were distributed among themselves again.\nAlthough they had occupied the whole floor, they had gathered themselves and lived in just three households together.\nGu Ning, Father Gu and Mother Gu, Dr Gao, Hong Jie, Huang MengYao, Xiang Xu, Wu Sen, Zuo You and Wo Wo all lived in the same household.\nThe twenty or so men crammed into the second household.\nThe remaining children stayed in the third household.\nThe dining was served in a different household.\nAfter the distribution and a quick breakfast, a few soldiers went out of the base to bring back in their vehicles.\nIt actually only took them two days to get from Jinyong to Zhongnan.\nThus, they had officially begun their life at the Zhongnan base.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Opps I didn’t notice that the Zhongnan base was split into two parts. So… here is the part 2. XD Oh Paj, all your dedicated chapters will be coming soon as I’m pushing it to link the very interesting battle chapters, it will be a whole chunk hahaha. Do stay tuned ~ Thank you all for reading!)\n\n\n",
    "92": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-92/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nApart from Gu Ning, Jia DaoZhang, Xiang Xu, Hong Jie onward, all the others in the team wrote down a search notice by hand, a dense row of names on the list.\nAfter coming back, Zhang XiaoBai informed them that the base was so greedy and dark, posting a search notice was divided into the section. The free section was randomly pasted where another post could cover it up and it might be even torn away by others in just a short time. The paying section require them to submit a pound of supplies for each notice posted and after a month, they had to renew it by submitting supplies again.\n\n\n\nThere were only about five or six of them pasted on the paying section and it was highly visible so they choose to paste it there.\nZhang XiaoBai added: “However, there’s seem to be a bazaar over there. A lot of people were setting up stalls and it seem quite interesting. Since we are bored, why not let’s go out for a stroll and get familiar with the surrounding?”\nGu Ning noticed that everyone were very excited and the children all looked so eager to go out. It was just as well to go out and familiarise themselves with the place that they would be settling down so they all went out together.\nThe children cheered for a while as they went out, but when they got out, they couldn’t resist wandering around. After being scolded by Hong Jie, they followed the group closely and didn’t dare to wander around.\nThe survivors they saw on the way were generally dressed in shabby clothes and were not as clean as tidy as they were. Furthermore, Gu Ning and the rest faces were rosy and full of energy, not to mention the fact that there were 40 to 50 of them including the children, which made them very striking. At this point, the existence of special abilities users was no longer a secret, so the remaining survivors all guessed that the team must have special abilities users as they looked so different from them.\nThe so-called bazaar was a two hundred metre walk in the opposite direction from the management office to the flats.\nAlong the riverbank, there were many items placed on both sides by the survivors. It was bustling with people at the bazaar, but most of them were new survivors roaming around the base and only a few people were actually buying things. All kinds of things that were worth a lot of money before the apocalypse could only be exchanged for a mouthful of supplies right now.\nGu Ning’s group was just too attention-grabbing, and with the big bulging backpack which Shi Tou was carrying, the eyes of those survivors who had been too restless and lazy to sell suddenly lit up.\n“Hey! Come and have a look! The latest fruit model phone! Charge it up and it will work! Bought it for over 8,000 yuan and it’s 90% new! How about a pound of supplies and I’ll even throw in a tablet free for you?!”\n“Miss, take a look at this necklace of mine!” A woman crossed the stall and took Huang MengYao by the hand: “It’s a diamond, three carats! Really, take a closer look at the cut and the colour! I only want five pounds of supplies! It’s really a good deal! How’s that?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHuang MengYao pulled her hand out and refused it outright.\nThe woman refused to stop but looking at Huang MengYao’s impatient expression, she didn’t dare to pull her again. However, she grabbed Gu Ning who seemed to be watching the scene: “Three pounds! Just three pounds alright?! Biscuits, bread, sausages or any food supplies! I’m telling you! I used to buy this necklace for over a million dollars! It’s real! Two pounds! Just two pounds of supplies and you can have the necklace!”\nThe others thought Gu Ning would surely just shrug it off and leave, but to their surprise, she took the diamond necklace from the woman’s hand and held it while commenting: “It looks quite pretty.”\nThe others almost fell in shock, silently sighing in their hearts that women were still women, after all, even Gu Ning couldn’t be exempted.\nFang Fa smiled and asked: “Do you like it?”\nInstead, Gu Ning passed the diamond necklace to Fang Fa and said: “Can you tell if it’s real?”\n“It’s real! Of course, it’s real!” Without waiting for Fang Fa to reply, the woman spoke excitedly: “I brought this when I got married, of course, it’s real!”\nFang Fa laughed bitterly: “I’m not a jewellery appraiser so I don’t know about that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGao Yue, however, took the necklace from Fang Fa’s hand, pinched the diamond and put it in front of her eyes and examined it carefully for a while. Then glanced at the woman who was trying to sell the diamond necklace, and after seeing the half apprehension and reluctance in her eyes, Gao Yue informed Gu Ning: “It’s real, do you want to buy it?”\nGu Ning casually slipped the diamond necklace into her pocket and instructed without waiting for the woman to negotiate: “Shi Tou, give the supplies!”\nThat woman had been trying to sell her necklace for days and hadn’t sold it yet. Just now she was about to change her mind and sell it for only a pound of supplies but to her surprise, they actually bought it! She was overjoyed to have a small pile of two pounds of supplies. She looked around warily then quickly packed those supplies in her backpack she had prepared and then scurried away with them in her arms.\nThose survivors who were selling items were at once abuzz, shouting even more vigorously and some even came over directly to sell their items.\nWhile everyone else was a bit overwhelmed, Gu Ning was interested and glanced around looking for something valuable unlike those high-end mobile phones and various electronic products which obviously were not her target. She silently estimated in her mind how much the diamond she had just bought could be pawned for, then converted it to supplies, and the calculated value brought an involuntary smile to her face.\nThis was indeed a very good deal.\nAt that moment, a wrinkled hand grabbed Gu Ning’s arm and when Gu Ning looked up, an old man with white hair was staring at her closely: “You come with me, follow me.”\nGu Ning glanced down at the small bag he was holding tightly in his right hand, then at his eager looking expression. She hesitated for a moment before following the old man to the far corner.\nOnly then did the old man let go of Gu Ning’s arm, and then clasped his hands tightly around the object in his hand: “Lady, I have a good item here, take a look and name me a price.” As he said that, he unzipped half of the small bag in his arms, revealing the object inside. Gu Ning only saw a greenish bowl-like object and that old man quickly pulled the zip up: “How is it?”\nBefore Gu Ning could see clearly what it was, she heard the voice of Jia DaoZhang drawing a cold breath next to her: “This… is this that Northern Song Dynasty Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash1?!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning had no idea when did Jia DaoZhang stood beside her, but his eyes were so sharp that before she could even see what it was, he had already called out the name of it.\nThe old man was also a bit surprised: “You recognise it?”\nHowever, Jia DaoZhang replied: “I didn’t see it clearly at first glance, so take this out again and let me take a closer look.” As he spoke, he stared at the old man’s bag without blinking, as if he was afraid that the object inside would fly away.\nThe old man looked at Jia DaoZhang for a few moments in disbelief, then unzipped the bag and carefully took out the green bowl.\n“Be careful, don’t break it!” The old man said with a wary look at Jia DaoZhang.\nJia DaoZhang also held it cautiously and replied: “Don’t worry! I won’t break this even if I’m broken.”\nSeeing the solemnity of the two men, Gu Ning was also piqued and looked at the “bowl” with curiosity. The bowl was of a very pleasing colour, with a pale green glaze and the opening looked like six flower petals, making it look warm and ancient which was very pleasing to the eye. It was just that Gu Ning couldn’t tell anything apart from the shape, but hearing Jia DaoZhang calling out the name of the object in one breath, it seem to be an antique from the Northern Song Dynasty.\nJia DaoZhang held the bowl in hand for a long time, checking it left and right, and then turned it over to look at the bottom. Meanwhile, the others were curious and all gathered around. The old man’s expression was tensed but seeing that the others, both young and old, did not look like any vicious people. Moreover, since he had finally met someone who knew about it, the old man had no choice but to calmly wait for Jia DaoZhang to finish his appraisal.\nJia DaoZhang examined it for nearly ten minutes before he asked the old man in shock: “Where did you get this?”\nThe old man glared and snatched away the Ru-Kiln directly from his hand. Although he snatched it away, it was carefully snatched and then carefully placed back into his bag before answering: “Why do you care about how I got it. You’ve already appraised the goods, so now it’s time to talk about the price.”\n“Sure sure sure, speak!” Jia DaoZhang replied excitedly: “How much supplies do you want before you are willing to give this to me?”\n“I don’t want supplies.” The old man replied.\nJia DaoZhang choked then stared at the old man with incredulous eyes and asked: “You aren’t planning to give it to me for free, are you? That, that’s too much for a gift!”\nThe old man didn’t say anything, but his expression was in awe at Jia DaoZhang’s shamelessness.\nJia DaoZhang coughed dryly before asking again: “Then tell me, what you want? Although I’m poor I will definitely think of a way!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe old man replied: “Do you have crystal cores?”\nJia DaoZhang froze then negotiated again: “You’re already so old, you can’t develop your powers even if you ate the crystal cores. It’s better to exchange it for more supplies.”\nThe old man held out two fingers to Jia DaoZhang and gestured: “Two. Those that have colour.”\nJia DaoZhang was stunned when he heard the old man exchange request. The crystal cores were not that easy to come by, and although the Ru-Kiln was precious, it was not of much value to him now. Thus, even if he had the cheek to ask Gu Ning for the crystal cores, he would be embarrassed to exchange them for the Ru-Kiln.\nGu Ning, who had not said anything, suddenly interrupted: “Is it worth a lot of money?”\nJia DaoZhang nodded affirmatively and explained: “Before the apocalypse, another Northern Song Dynasty Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash fetched for at least 200 million …… not Korean Won nor Japanese Yen but is RMB!”\nGu Ning also couldn’t help but draw a cold breath in her heart, 200 million? What is that concept? 200,000,000? Even the zeros at the end would make one dizzy! Gu Ning suppressed the excitement in her heart, and without the slightest hesitation, she instantly took out two crystal cores from her pocket. Then directly shoved the crystal cores into the old man’s hand and under the dismayed look of the old man, she snatched the small bag before agreeing: “It’s a deal.”\nThe old man carefully examined the crystal core in his hand, then looked at Gu Ning with a bit of disbelief. Although he knew how much this Ru-Kiln was worth before the apocalypse but right now, for many people, this Ru-Kiln was not even comparable to a loaf of bread. Previously he asked for two crystal cores was to leave them the room for bargaining but he didn’t expect this girl with blonde hair to give two to him without negotiating.\nThis unexpected smoothness only pleased him for a moment and then he stared at that little bag with some reluctance. After a moment of hesitation, the old man said to Jia DaoZhang: “This gentleman. I see that you know what you’re talking about, and it’s not a waste if it falls into your hands. It’s an old piece and if it weren’t for the current world, I wouldn’t have taken it out for anything. Thus, I’ll like to ask you to take good care of it in the future.”\nJia DaoZhang’s mouth was already grinning behind his ears, but when he heard such a solemn explanation from the old man, he couldn’t help but said: “Don’t worry, rest assured!”\nThen the old man clutched the crystal cores tightly and prepared to leave in a hurry.\n“Please wait!” Gu Ning suddenly called out to the old man.\nAlthough the old man stopped, he looked at them with a wary face, as if he was worried that they would go back on their word to rob his crystal cores after they had gotten the item.\nGu Ning gestured to him to look around at those veiled gazes and it suddenly dawned on the old man and he seem embarrassed.\nBrother San also exclaimed with relief at Gu Ning’s sharp perceptiveness. If she hadn’t noticed, the old man wouldn’t have gotten very far before he was robbed and in serious cases, it might even danger his life.  Then Brother San stepped forward and asked the old man: “Grandpa, we used to be soldiers. If you trust us, I’ll have someone to send you back to your place?”\nThe old man thought that if these few people really wanted to find trouble with him, he was already a damn elderly and they didn’t have to wait until they got him back to his residence before robbing him. Seeing that the young men were all looking at him with concern, he was touched and for the first time, he gave them a genuine smile; “Then….. I’ll trouble you all.”\nIn the end, Brother San sent Zhong Xu to send the old man back.\nJia DaoZhang salivated as he stared at the small bag in Gu Ning’s hand and almost drooled.\nGu Ning was amused to see him like this, and then tried passing him the small bag and said: “For you to relieve your hunger for the moment.”\nHowever, Jia DaoZhang was busy waving his hand: “No, no, no. It’s safer for you to keep it. Lend it to me after we have returned. Be careful, don’t break it accidentally. Have you finished shopping? Let’s go back if we’re done?!”\nGu Ning received two wonderful items and was in a good mood but refused to let go of such a good opportunity to make a fortune. Pretending not to see Jia DaoZhang’s anxious look, she insisted on shopping for half an hour and exchanged the supplies for a few more very valuable objects before the group returned to their home.\nWhen Gu Ning was on her way back, she was thinking about how to cash in on the few things she had exchanged. In one fell swoop, Gu Ning had turned from a poor man to a rich woman, and it still felt a bit surreal.\nYet a mysterious smile kept hanging on her face which stunned everyone. The others naturally didn’t know what was in Gu Ning’s mind and all thought that Gu Ning must have really liked the diamond necklace a lot.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: 北宋汝窑天青釉葵花洗 Běisòng rǔ yáo tiān qīng yòu kuíhuā xǐ 1= Northern Song Dynasty Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash.

It’s a sin for that old man to have such a grandson at his age.”\nAfter gossiping a little while, they had soon changed the subject.\n\n\n\n“By the way, you have to go back to the space tonight right, Gu Ning?” Jia DaoZhang suddenly asked.\nGu Ning replied: “Yes, that’s right.”\nAs soon as Zhang XiaoBai heard this, he immediately perked up and came over curiously while asking: “Gu Ning, what exactly is that space of yours like? Is it sealed or open space? Did you have any consciousness after you went in?”\nGu Ning had long been prepared for them to ask this question, so she wasn’t surprised and answered: “No. I lost consciousness after I’ve entered that space. It was as if I had fallen asleep.” This was the best answer Gu Ning had come up with.\nThere was nothing they could do even if they didn’t believe it. After all, no one knew exactly what the space looks like, so naturally, there was no way to prove whether what Gu Ning said was true or false.\nAfter Gu Ning’s explanation, she added: “Don’t tell anyone about me being a Space ability user.”\n“Don’t worry.” Brother San assured.\nThey had also overheard what the staff member had said when they were at the entrance.\nAs long as they killed the ability user themselves, they could obtain everything inside the space. Thus, a Space ability user would be like a walking warehouse to others. If they knew the huge amount of supplies inside Gu Ning’s space, everyone would be so envious and jealous that they would eventually lose their minds over it.\nGu Ning was also well aware of the crisis that follow it and after she knew this information, she had made preparations by packing enough supplies in the truck, as well as asking most of their group members to carry a backpack full of supplies in case of accidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAt Zhang XiaoBai’s strong request, at 9 pm, Gu Ning sat on the sofa waiting for the moment to enter the space. The time to enter the space was entirely chosen by Gu Ning herself, but she had to pretend in front of them that she was waiting for the loss of her consciousness and then disappeared.\nAt ten minutes past nine, Zhang XiaoBai’s eyes had been staring to the point of soreness. Yet when he couldn’t hold on and wanted to ask Gu Ning when exactly would she going to disappear, the moment he opened his mouth, Gu Ning who had been sitting on the sofa in front of him, disappeared!\nHis mouth hung open in shock for a long while before closing it. Zhang XiaoBai shifted his shocked gaze to others and asked: “Did you, did you all see that? Gu Ning just swopped and then disappeared.”\nFang Fa touched the place where Gu Ning had just sat with his hand, her body heat still lingered on the sofa but she had just disappeared and it was so incredible.\n“Hiss——“ Zhang XiaoBai suddenly drew in a cold breath before rubbing both his arms with strong forces: “Look, I’m having goosebumps right now.”\nThe expression of others in the living room were all in awe and stunned too.\nGu Ning returned to the space and shook her head helplessly as telling such a lie was a helpless act to avoid unnecessary troubles. She opened the door, travelled back to the bathroom in that peaceful world, then went back into her bedroom, and changed her clothing before heading out of her room.\n“Morning.” Yi ShaoQing drifted sleepily past Gu Ning with a cup of steaming coffee with his messy curly hair while dressed in his usual striped pyjamas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEvery morning, he looked like he hadn’t fully woken up and he wouldn’t change out of the striped cotton pyjamas if he didn’t intend to go out.\nZhuang Chen, on the other hand, even when she didn’t head out, every day she would still wear unbelievably delicate make-up. With her long, red, big wavy hair, she always looked so radiant.\nZhuang Chen referred to this as “aura”.\nYin Sang hadn’t stayed here ever since the first day they had returned. Gu Ning didn’t know if it was because of herself but she didn’t bother about that.\nAs for Ji JiuZe.\nEvery day, either he was in his room, if not he would be in the study room for the whole day except for the daily three meals so it was rare to come across him. Whereas Yi ShaoQing usually spent his morning in a daze and from the afternoon onward, he would start experimenting in his so-called laboratory. Thus, Gu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai, and the other’s training were all handled by Zhuang Chen.\nApart from Zhuang Chen’s extraordinary enthusiasm for Gu Ning, Zhang XiaoBai and the rest were basically left aside to survive on their own.\nZhuang Chen even told them that if they had nothing to do, they could just go out for a stroll.\nIn the past few days, they had not been exposed to any information about what the Five Stars Brigade was all about. Gu Ning had been training every day plus her biggest goal of joining the Five Stars Brigade was now being achieved, so she didn’t really care about what they actually were at all. Zhang XiaoBai and the rest had nothing to do all day long and were bored that they almost climbed a tree to catch a bird for fun. From the initial sympathy to now being slightly jealous, they watched Gu Ning being wrestled around by Zhuang Chen all day long.\nZhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu were slightly worried, did these indicate that they were going to be expelled if they were to be left alone like now? Whereas Chen Gen was calm and collected, strolling here and there every day, watching Zhuang Chen wrestle Gu Ning at the training ground when he had nothing better to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Bang!” With a loud smash, Gu Ning fell to the ground for the first time today, then she got up excitedly and asked Chen Gen who was watching at the side: “How long?!”\nChen Gen lifted his eyes from his watch and looked at her with some complexity and answered: “Twenty-eight minutes.”\nWhat kind of concept were twenty-eight minutes? Three days ago, Gu Ning could only last for a few minutes under Zhuang Chen’s attack, and that was Zhuang Chen without using her full strength. However, comparing both of their states right now.  Zhuang Chen was sitting on a recliner, wiping her sweat with a towel while Gu Ning was not even tired, not to mention that she didn’t even sweat much and her eyes shone so brightly and eagerly.\nChen Gen had noticed that Zhuang Chen had been forced to use her full strength against Gu Ning. It had only been three days since she had struggled under Zhuang Chen’s attack and now she could hold on for almost half an hour under her full strength.\nChen Gen couldn’t help but wonder if Gu Ning was like those natural martial arts training genius written in those novels?! If not, there was no way to explain Gu Ning’s speed of progression in such a short duration.\nThree days later, another three days had passed.\nZhuang Chen had no choice but to find Ji JiuZe in the study room. She felt a little embarrassed about the fact that she couldn’t teach Gu Ning anymore. After all, it was under her strong request to get Ji JiuZe to pass Gu Ning to her for training. Yet, not even half a month, her disciple was too smart and was about to overtake her teacher. It was a bit difficult and embarrassed to say it out so she beat around the bushes for a long time to express her desire to stop teaching Gu Ning.\nA person as smart as Ji JiuZe would definitely be able to understand what she meant and then prevented her from losing her reputation in front of Yi ShaoQing.\nYet, who would have guessed that after she had finished speaking, Ji JiuZe finally removed his gaze from the papers on the table and looked up at Zhuang Chen, slightly raising his eyebrows to indicate that she could continue with her explanation.\nZhuang Chen stared at Ji JiuZe for a long time, but gave up on the impassive Ji JiuZe and finally admitted: “Okay, I admit that I can’t teach her anymore.”\n“I’ve used my full strength but it’s already getting hard to win against her.” Zhuang Chen was still a bit speechless when she mentioned this problem: “She is simply a monster, her reflexes and speed are frightening fast. And the scariest thing is her ability to replicate…..”She parted her hair to the side and then continued righteously: “In a few more days, she will be able to take me down and it will be too humiliating for me by then.”\n“I can testify to this!” Yi ShaoQing, who had been sitting at the side suddenly interrupted: “Gu Ning’s physique is indeed different from normal people, I need to find a chance to draw some blood from her to study.”\nJi JiuZe closed the document in front of him, still being expressionless, he looked at Zhuang Chen and asked: “So you are now officially giving up.”\nZhuang Chen gave a frustrated look and replied: “Yes.”\nJi JiuZe stood up and shoved the documents back onto the shelf behind him but his originally cold and solemn face loosened up a little as he glanced at Zhuang Chen while stating: “Then I’ll take over.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“…… ? ? ?” Zhuang Chen vaguely felt as if something was wrong.\nJi JiuZe had already reached the door when he suddenly turned to someone and warned: “Yi ShaoQing, don’t get your idea on Gu Ning.”\nYi ShaoQing raised his hands in surrender: “I know I know. She’s yours now! I won’t touch a single hair on her head, go find your good disciple now!”\nAs soon as Ji JiuZe left the room, Yi ShaoQing immediately placed his legs up on the desk.\n“The captain indeed is the captain. He has long guessed that there will be such a day. He purposely passed Gu Ning to you for a few days to train her and then waited until you can’t teach her anymore. Then you’ll come over to find him for a withdrawal, and he’ll take over it as a matter of course. Maybe he had his eye on Gu Ning from the start and then took this opportunity to make you teach Gu Ning a few days of foundation so that he could save some trouble!” Yi ShaoQing stroked the non-existent beard on his chin and tsked: “Tsk tsk tsk, in the end, the calculative Ji Foxy won.”\n“Zhuang Chen had withdrawn her right to teach you because of her limited ability. You are now in my hands.” Gu Ning was eating breakfast after her usual morning running when Ji JiuZe, who was walking down the stairs as if he was just passing by, suddenly stopped and informed her. After a pause, he added: “Any objections?”\nBefore Gu Ning could swallow the bread in her mouth, she shook her head like a rattle and slurred her replies: “No, nothing.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Late update!!

    "94": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-94/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter receiving Gu Ning’s answer without hesitation, Ji JiuZe dropped another sentence: “Come to the training room after you are done with your meal.” Then he walked away without looking back.\nGu Ning had probably figured out Zhuang Chen’s capability during her confrontation with her in the past few days. She had guessed in her mind that Zhuang Chen would not be able to teach her for too long. As far as she knew, Yin Sang’s close combat skills were superior to Zhuang Chen’s but she and Yin Sang were already at each other necks so if she were to teach herself, she would probably suffer a lot more.\n\n\n\nShe didn’t expect it to be Ji JiuZe to take over, which was really an unexpected pleasant surprise.\nIn less than two minutes, Gu Ning was put down by Ji JiuZe.\nGu Ning got up from the ground and cautiously looked at Ji JiuZe. She felt as if that moment just now was what she had felt when she first fought Zhuang Chen and it was even more helpless and powerless. She was already very close to Zhuang Chen’s capability so unlike the first time when she fought without any foundation and got knocked down, right now she was feeling way more excited. However, after her strength had been greatly improved, she was still knocked down so easily by Ji JiuZe. Apart from feeling a blow to her self-confidence, she was more shocked by Ji JiuZe’s strength.\nAlthough she had known for a long time that Ji JiuZe was the strongest among them in close combat, a level like this was a little bit too perverse by any stretch of the imagination.\nHer reaction speed was fast, yet Ji JiuZe’s reaction speed was even faster. Even with the strength, she relied on, Ji JiuZe was on par with her. What made Gu Ning feel even more appalled was that the strength Ji JiuZe was showing now was not even his true strength ……\nGu Ning swallowed dryly, the pupils under her fine blonde fringes narrowed slightly, her eyes full of scruple.\nIn stark contrast to her tensed body, Ji JiuZe was standing there calmly, waiting for Gu Ning to launch her second attack.\nUnlike Zhuang Chen’s rehearsal teaching, Ji JiuZe belongs to the “actual combat style.”\nThe fundamental difference between rehearsal teaching and the actual combat style was that one was fake and the other was real. One was absolutely safe while the other one had to suffer a bit.\nAfter practicing with Zhuang Chen for almost ten days, Gu Ning didn’t have any injuries on her body. However, within half a day of practicing with Ji JiuZe, Gu Ning already had bruises on her knees and arms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat was more painful was not the physical injuries but the mentally. Basically, Gu Ning was being pressed and beaten by Ji JiuZe, even creating a feeling that she was a flat raft, being battered by the tumbling waves on the sea and she might even capsize at any moment. Even when facing the tentacle mutated zombie, Gu Ning didn’t feel as helpless as she does now.\nNot only was Gu Ning, the person who was suffering, but even the onlookers like Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and Chen Gen were sympathetic to her as if they were the ones being constantly wrestled. Yet Gu Ning stubbornly got up every time she was thrown to the ground. They didn’t even have a chance to excuse her from him and could only watch as Gu Ning continued slammed to the wall, fell, and got up from the ground stubbornly and repeatedly.\nThroughout the whole morning, Gu Ning, this small raft was lapped by the roaring waves in the middle of the ocean, that was Ji JiuZe. It was not until lunchtime that he announced the end of this morning’s practice.\nGu Ning had already been numbed by the abuse and was in a rare state of mental depression during lunch.\nAfter the meal, there was a two hours break.\nGu Ning felt the pain in her elbow and lifted her sleeve to take a look. There was a big bruise on her elbow which was caused by her hitting the wall when she tried to attack Ji JiuZe with all her might. This was the result of Ji JiuZe taking some of the force off her, if not, hitting with her full strength on the wall, her bones would have been cracked by then.\nAlthough she had been abused all morning, Gu Ning still managed to gain some benefit out of it. However, as compared to Zhuang Chen’s way of teaching which she still had time to observe the skills in between, Ji JiuZe’s attack was too fierce that Gu Ning had to concentrate on her moves. Moreover, if she was distracted for a second, she would be knocked down by Ji JiuZe who attacked from nowhere.\nUnder a week of high-intensity combat training, there were countless times when Gu Ning wanted to ask Ji JiuZe if he had any grudge against her but in the end, she forced the question down her throat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAlthough Gu Ning was very reluctant to use her psychic energy, the bruises on her body were really a bit too frightening. Plus in such a state, it was really difficult for her to survive under Ji JiuZe’s horrible training so she could only use her precious psychic energy to recover her bruises every night.\nAt the same time, Gu Ning could feel that she was growing in leaps and bounds from such intense training. Thus, even though new bruises would appear every day before she slept, Gu Ning still gritted her teeth and endured them. She even felt thankful to Ji JiuZe’s training in her heart for such sweet growth in a short period.\nThere was a turn of events during one afternoon when Yi ShaoQing, for once being refreshed, suddenly gave up his usual lab routine and went to the training room to see how Ji JiuZe trained Gu Ning.\nThe expression on his face could be described as strange when he saw Gu Ning being thrown down by Ji JiuZe continuously without any mercy.\nHe had to suspend their training and then secretly called Ji JiuZe over.\n“Is this how you trained Gu Ning?” Yi ShaoQing glanced at Gu Ning who was catching some rest and asked in a whisper: “Are you training her or do you have a grudge against her eh?!”\nJi JiuZe remained expressionless: “What’s the problem?”\nYi ShaoQing stared at Ji JiuZe and answered exaggeratedly: “Because it seems to me that you are not training Gu Ning at all but deliberately abusing her. I really don’t know how she survived a whole week.”\nJi JiuZe replied: “Such actual combat training is the best way to train.”\n“It’s not that there’s something wrong with the way you train. Rather, did you never consider that Gu Ning is a girl from the beginning?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYi ShaoQing saw Ji JiuZe visibly freeze for a moment before continuing. “Even a strong male will be ruined by such practice. No matter how strong Gu Ning is, she is still a girl, so she might not dare to talk about the beating she received from you but probably cry behind your back. I know you have not taken in any disciple before nor have you personally condescended to instruct anyone. Yet, since you have finally accepted a disciple, you have to first ensure that they are not crippled by you. Although actual combat training meant real fighting, couldn’t you at least hit her a little bit lighter, or let her fall a bit softer? She was like a sandbag that was slammed around by you…..” Yi ShaoQing was still ranting on Gu Ning’s behalf and raving about Ji JiuZe’s brutality training.\nJi JiuZe was swayed by Yi ShaoQing’s words, and glanced over to Gu Ning, just in time to see that she was frowning while leaning against the wall and rubbing her shoulders.\nHe was slightly stunned as just like what Yi ShaoQing had stated, Gu Ning was the first person he had ever taught personally. If he hadn’t valued Gu Ning’s potential, he wouldn’t have had the idea of teaching her himself. Since he had never taken in any disciple, he naturally had no experience in teaching others so he just used the method which he thought would achieve the quickest results as a matter of course, even forgetting the fact that Gu Ning was a girl. Now that he thought about it, if it were Zhuang Chen, she would have lost her temper with him. However, Gu Ning was always on time for her morning and afternoon training, other than the necessary greetings and the occasional request for advice, she seldom spoke much. After being slammed onto the ground every time, she would just get up and continue without saying a word……\nJi JiuZe replied: “She didn’t tell me about it .”\nYi ShaoQing couldn’t help but rolled his eyes and explained: “You have an ice-cube expressionless face every day, Gu Ning is probably scared to death mentally so how could she tell that to you.”\nJi JiuZe’s brow frowned slightly before ignoring Yi ShaoQing who was still nagging away and walking toward Gu Ning.\n“Do you have any comments on my training methods?”\nJi JiuZe suddenly asked such a direct question.\nGu Ning first froze for a moment, then looked at Ji JiuZe’s cold expression and subconsciously replied: “No.” Then under his questioning gaze, she thought carefully again before answering honestly: “Nothing, really.”\nJi JiuZe was sure that Gu Ning was not lying, yet he was even more puzzled.\nIn the end, Gu Ning was inexplicably given a half-day off and had absolutely no idea what was the reason behind it.\nInstead, she was a little apprehensive because of Ji JiuZe’s questioning.\nIn the evening, when Gu Ning was about to lock the door and went to bed, there was a knock on the door.\nAfter opening the door, Gu Ning was surprised to find Zhuang Chen holding a bottle of brown medicinal ointment: “Zhuang Chen? Any problem?”\nZhuang Chen handed over the medicinal ointment that was twirling in her hand and said: “I don’t know, JiuZe asked me to send it over. It’s a special ointment for bruises and injuries, you’re injured?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter sending Zhuang Chen away, Gu Ning looked at the bottle of medicinal ointment and guessed that perhaps Yi ShaoQing had said something to Ji JiuZe when he came to the training room this afternoon.\nGu Ning didn’t put it to heart.\nYet the next day, she had another day off and was free to go out, no limiting to her range of activities at all.\nGu Ning was puzzled by the sudden day off but she just went home straight.\nShe hadn’t been back for two weeks.\nShe explained that the child’s parents were busy and she couldn’t leave but she was paid double on Sundays which made Mother Gu feel slightly better.\nGu Ning’s return during the usual weekday and not just holidays nor weekends made Mother Gu very happy.\nMother Gu cooked a nice table of goodies for Gu Ning during lunch. The money which Gu Ning gave last time, she paid back to the few families who were pressing hard on them. Moreover, Father Gu started attending classes again so the family’s financial situation was instantly a lot better. If it wasn’t for the fear of making them suspicious, Gu Ning almost wanted to pay off all the family’s debts immediately.\nAfter lunch, Gu Ning went back to her bedroom and turned on her computer. She took out the Northern Song Dynasty Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash and placed it on the side of her computer table and began searching for its origins of it.\nOnce she had checked, Gu Ning discovered that her Celadon Sunflower Wash was identical to the one that had fetched a staggering $200 million! At that time, Gu Ning thought that Jia DaoZhang was just boasting and that he might have been mistaken. Yet, at this moment, Gu Ning took the Ru-Kiln and compared it to the image on the screen and found that it was indeed identical. If this was the real deal, it would be $200 million ahhhh! ! !\nGu Ning was grinning from ear to ear and she was already thinking about how to sell this Ru-Kiln. Finding Fang Fa was probably more troublesome than finding a pawn shop, but which pawn shop could afford such an expensive piece?!\n===============================================================\n(T/N: This JiuZe… poor Gu Ning, getting bruises here and there. Sorry for the very late chapter but better late than never. XD. Oh and have a wonderful Ramadan and blessed month =) Thank you all for reading!~)\n\n\n",
    "95": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-95/\n(T/N: This chapter is dedicated to Julio for the kind and generous support you had given from the start. I had been retracing all the support and I do owe you 1 more chapter hahaha. Hope you like it if you are still reading it from here. XD. Thank you)\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning was still immersed in the joy that she was about to have at least $200 million in assets before hearing Mother Gu calling out to her: “NingNing, just now Xiao Yu called and said that she would be coming over later. I’ll go out to buy some fruit and come back. Do open the door for her later.”\nGu Ning instantly withdraw herself from the joy of becoming a rich woman and immediately opened her bedroom door before walking out: “Why is she coming over?”\n\n\n\nMother Gu replied: “She didn’t say, probably she is here to visit you. When you came back the first day, they wanted to come over to visit you but you rejected them. They asked you to go over for dinner but you were too busy with work. The two of you are the only girls in the family, so if you don’t put more effort into your relationship, you’re going to be distanced. In the past, both of you were very close so now that you’re back, no matter how busy you are, you two sisters need to make time to get together right?”\nMother Gu didn’t know what had happened in the post-apocalyptic world, so she naturally thought that Gu Ning and Jiang Yu were still maintaining a good sister relationship. Perhaps that is what Jiang Yu thought so too, but Gu Ning only wanted to be as far away from Jiang Yu as much as possible, it would be better if they never get to see each other again till they died. However, she was afraid that Mother Gu wouldn’t be able to accept it if she suddenly became too indifferent to Jiang Yu’s family, so she could only take things slowly.\nGu Ning quickly thought of an idea, an anxious look appeared on her face: “Then what should I do? I just received a call from the child’s parents asking me to hurry over, they have some urgent business to attend and the child is alone at home.”\nMother Gu immediately replied: “Then you’d better go now. The child’s parents treat you so well and trust you so much. You can’t let them down. Xiao Yu is our family member so it’s okay. I’ll just let her know later.”\nGu Ning even deliberately asked: “Will that be fine?”\n“It’s fine. You two can meet anytime you want, so go ahead and don’t worry about it. Don’t drag on any longer, go now.” Now it was Mother Gu who kept urging her to leave.\nGu Ning got her way so she hurried left.\nWithin ten minutes after Gu Ning had left, Jiang Yu parked her car downstairs.\nShe knocked on Gu Ning’s house front door, and upon entering the house, she hugged Mother Gu and greeted sweetly: “Auntie, I haven’t visited you for so long, I miss you so much.”\nMother Gu couldn’t stop smiling and joked: “Aiya, why do you even bring so many fruits over? Too much money to burn ah.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“It’s a token of my respect to you, Auntie.” Jiang Yu entered the house and placed the fruits on the table, then glanced around the room before asking: “Eh? Where’s Gu Ning? Didn’t you say she was home?”\nMother Gu explained: “She received a call from the parents of the child she is tutoring, they said it was urgent and needed her to rush over and take care of the child. So I’ve let her head over. There’s still plenty of time for you sisters to meet and catch up with each other anyway.”\nJiang Yu smiled and asked: “It’s quite tiring for Gu Ning to take care of children, isn’t it? In fact, our company has a position open right now, so why don’t I try to get it for her?”\nMother Gu waved her hand and rejected: “There’s no need. The other day, JiaZi said there was a position in their company where Gu Ning could go and work there when she felt like it but in the end, she still rejected it. Her current job is quite good, and the parents are very nice and pay her a lot, nearly ten thousand per month. It’s quite good that Gu Ning has just graduated and is already getting such a good pay.”\nJiang Yu was surprised for a moment: “The salary is that high?”\nMother Gu answered proudly: “Yes. It’s mainly because the parents of that family think especially highly of NingNing, and she had only been working for a few weeks yet they’ve already given her an advance payment of thirty thousand.”\nThe expression on Jiang Yu’s face was a little unnatural but it was only there for an instant: “With such a good offer, NingNing isn’t being scammed right?”\n“No way!” Mother Gu immediately replied: “It was introduced by a friend of Gu Ning’s who is a police officer. Don’t worry about that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJiang Yu asked curiously: “How come Gu Ning didn’t tell me that she has a police officer friend before?”\n“Ah, speaking of Fang Fa, he is Gu Ning little police officer friend. I really like that boy. He’s good-looking, tall, sunny, and at the right age. Some days, I will get Gu Ning to bring him back home so that you can take a look too and see how compatible they are.” Mother Gu was close-knitted to Jiang’s family and Jiang Yu also grew up with Gu Ning, so the sisters were very familiar with each other which was why Mother Gu had no reservations when she was talking to Jiang Yu. She was so happy with Gu Ning’s current situation that her desire to chat about it was particularly strong, and she spilled everything in her mind without noticing that Jiang Yu’s smile was a little different.\n“Oh sure.” Jiang Yu gave a faint smile: “Then call me out for a meal someday and I’ll help Gu Ning check it out then.”\nShe smiled and then chatted about recent events. Finally, Jiang Yu changed the subject to her real purpose of this visit: “By the way, Eldest Aunt, I have something I need to trouble you.”\nMother Gu asked casually: “What is it?”\n“It’s like this, I’m actually doing it as a favour to a friend.” Jiang Yu explained and took Mother Gu’s arm affectionately: “A friend of mine is working at the TV station and they have a treasure appraisal show. Yes, it’s the one that has been getting high ratings lately. I was looking for something like an antique to borrow for the show, and I’ve remembered that you have a pair of vases that seem like an antique, right? So I’m humbly asking if I can borrow it to help out the favour.”\nMother Gu laughed at that: “What antique. That was Gu Ning’s old grandmother’s dowry when she got married, and then it was passed down to me when I got married. It was something from the Civil War Era only.”\nJiang Yu urged: “It’s okay. They don’t necessarily have to be antiques, they just need others to bring them over and come up with a story before appraising them on the spot. After the show is filmed, I’ll return the items to you immediately.”\nMother Gu gave in: “Fine then. Although it’s not something valuable, I’m thinking of handing it over to NingNing as her dowry when she gets married. Wait for a while, I’ll go and get it for you.”\nWith that, she stood up and went to her room to retrieve it. Jiang Yu smiled and called out: “Thank you, Eldest Aunt.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThen she also stood up, looked around casually, and found that the door to Gu Ning’s room was left open. Her heart thumped slightly before entering Gu Ning’s room. In the past, when the two of them were very close, she used to go in and out of her room as she pleased. Gu Ning didn’t say anything about it so Jiang Yu didn’t have many worries so she entered the room and glanced around casually. Suddenly something caught her eyes that was placed next to the computer desk.\nMother Gu froze for a moment when she saw Jiang Yu carrying out a box from Gu Ning’s room, then Jiang Yu asked: “Eldest Aunt, Gu Ning has a particularly nice porcelain bowl here, it looks like an antique to me too, can I borrow it?” The item in her hand was none other than Gu Ning’s Northern Song Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash, which she had left at home and forgotten to take with her because she was in a hurry to avoid Jiang Yu.\n“I can’t make decisions about her stuff, so why don’t you give her a call. I’ll give you her new number.” Mother Gu said as she searched her phonebook.\nJiang Yu called Gu Ning on her mobile phone.\n“NingNing’s phone is off. How about I bring the stuff back first? I’ll call Gu Ning later and let her know. If it isn’t needed, I’ll send it back right away.” When Jiang Yu saw that Mother Gu was still hesitating, she immediately came forward and wrapped her arm around and coaxed: “Please Eldest Aunt, let me borrow it, I’ll definitely send it back in one piece, pretty please.”\nMother Gu’s heart softened and had no choice but to agree with her pleading.\nThe two of them chatted for a little longer, after which Jiang Yu took the pair of an emerald green vase and the $200 million worth of celadon sunflower wash and left.\nGu Ning had just remembered that she had left the celadon sunflower wash at home when she was in the taxi. She wanted to call back and ask Mother Gu to keep it away properly but she just noticed that her phone happened to be out of battery. Thinking that Mother Gu’s character, would definitely help her keep it away if she saw it, so she didn’t put much more thought into it.\nRight now it was just slightly over one o’clock and there was still plenty of time.\nGu Ning borrowed the taxi driver’s phone to look up available warehouses for rent on the internet.\nSoon, she had found a warehouse of about 100 square feet. The property prices in Jinyong were not very expensive, plus the location was near the outskirt. Thus, after negotiating, Gu Ning managed to rent it for 2,500 yuan per month and she instantly paid for the full year.\nGu Ning couldn’t care less about the money spent on the rent and then directly went to the city’s famous wholesale market. They sold a large bundle of winter items like men, women, and children’s winter cotton clothing, different variety of socks and shoes, heavy quilts, and all kinds of household goods.\nGu Ning was afraid of trouble, so she purchased a large number of items all at once.  As long as she thought that it was useful, she took a lot of it, and because of the huge quantity of goods she was purchasing, Gu Ning managed to bargain it for a low price. The owners of those wholesale shops were also smiling happily because they rarely encountered such a large buyer and sent a large truck to deliver it for Gu Ning for free. It took around two trips for them to finish delivering all the goods.\nThe warehouse which Gu Ning had rented was actually a staged cover for her to keep the items to her space.\nAfterward, Gu Ning went to the farmers’ market and found a shop specialising in seeds and bought a whole bunch of fruit and vegetable seeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn one afternoon, Gu Ning had spent about 100,000 yuan or so.\nThe money from the previous gold jewelleries exchanges went down the drain in a flash and Gu Ning felt a slight pain. However, when she thought about the diamond necklace alone could be sold for at least eight hundred thousand to a million, and the antique from the Northern Song Dynasty which was worth around 200 million dollars, the pain disappeared without a trace. Yet, she didn’t know that the celadon sunflower wash was now in Jiang Yu’s hand.\nIn the parlour of the TV station. The man in his thirties wearing a green shirt was the TV station friend called He YouPing that Jiang Yu had told Mother Gu about. He first picked up one of the pair of vases and held it in his hand to examining at it carefully. The style of the vase looked like the recent era so he put it aside after a few glances and then opened the other delicate box.\nJiang Yu saw that he looked as if he was not satisfied with the two vases and was inevitable a little disappointed.\nHe YouPing was unaware of Jiang Yu’s thoughts and simply lifted the lid of the box in front of him. He was also mentally prepared that Jiang Yu would not be able to bring anything worthy and the pair of vases proved his thoughts. Yet, as soon as the lid of the delicate box was lifted, He YouPing’s eyes lit up.\nGu Ning transferred most of the items in the warehouse into the space and left a small amount in the warehouse.\nGu Ning checked the time and it was only five in the afternoon.\nIn the post-apocalyptic world, her parents and friends from the third company were settled safely in the Zhongnan base. Except for the regular hunting of zombies for the crystal cores, there wasn’t much for her to worry about and there were times when she didn’t return for a day or two after informing them.\nOn the other hand, apart from slight suffering from the daily training by Ji JiuZe, without the constant threat to her life and feeling that her close combat skill was improving by leaps and bounds, Gu Ning was very satisfied with her current lifestyle.\nThinking about the kitchen that had all the equipment but was always not in use. As well as yesterday, Zhuang Chen had said she was tired of eating takeout, Gu Ning ran to the supermarket and brought back some ingredients before taking a taxi back.\n“Don’t tell me that you even know how to cook?!” Zhuang Chen was shocked as she watched Gu Ning enter with two large bags of ingredients. She was beaming with joy after receiving the confirmation: “Gu Ning, did you hear me yesterday that I was tired of having takeout, so you are cooking it for me today especially? Gu Ning! I’m so moved that my tears are coming out!” Zhuang Chen commented exaggeratedly.\nYi ShaoQing, Zhang XiaoBai, and the rest had all gathered around. After politely declining their offer to help, Gu Ning methodically moved around in the kitchen.\nShe originally didn’t know how to cook.\nIt all happened when Lu JiaZi was in college and complained once to Gu Ning that the food in the school cafeteria was getting worse. At that time, Gu Ning was immediately motivated and she, who had never held a spatula before, began to study recipes, read various books on food and watched culinary shows. She even secretly spend several thousand dollars to enroll in a cooking class.\nWhen she was slightly confident in cooking, she started making various dishes and brought them to school for Lu JiaZi whenever she had time. With just a single praise from Lu JiaZi would make Gu Ning’s heart burst with joy.\nGu Ning’s cooking skills had improved dramatically in those years, and she was even exposed to all eight major cuisines and was now at the level of a professional chef. Father Gu often joked that if she had studied in high school with the same vigour as she did with her cooking, she would have attended Tsinghua University or Peking University by now.\nAlthough it had been a little over half a year since she had cooked, and the knife in her hand had been used mostly for slashing zombies instead of fishes, the familiarity of the kitchen was still seared into her bones.\nAfter watching Gu Ning’s knife skills in slaughtering the fish, Zhuang Chen tsked in admiration: “See guys? This is excellent knife skills!” Then she remembered to ask: “Gu Ning, when will the food be ready?”\nGu Ning answered as she sliced open the fish: “The food will be ready at six-thirty exactly.”\nZhuang Chen glanced at her watch then bemoaned: “It still needs nearly an hour!”\nWashing, chopping, and preparing various vegetables and ingredients. It was obviously a very tedious and hectic task, but watching Gu Ning moving around in the kitchen made everything feel so organised.\n“Do you guys feel that Gu Ning is glowing in an aura?” Zhang XiaoBai suddenly asked Zhong Xu who was beside him as he looked at Gu Ning.\nZhong Xu replied; “I just didn’t think that Gu Ning could actually cook….. I thought all she knew was how to fight.”\nJi JiuZe, who happened to be passing by, didn’t know if he had overheard their conversation but his footsteps gave a slight pause. His gaze seemed to glance over to the kitchen inadvertently, a faint glen flashed in his eyes before he continued to walk away with his cup of tea.\nAs soon as Zhang XiaoBai had brought out the last dish to the table, Ji JiuZe arrived late and sat down in the seat opposite Gu Ning.\nThere were eight dishes on the table: braised carp, sweet and sour pork ribs, beef with small red chilies, cola chicken wings, white-scorched prawns, farmhouse stir-fry meat…… six meat dishes, three vegetarian dishes plus a fresh scallop and tofu soup.\nThese full table of dishes was not only rich in their variety but was also well-presented with exquisite usage of cutlery. This made Zhuang Chen’s appetite tingle as compared to the usual takeout plastic cutlery and poor-looking and tasting meals, her mouth was already salivating like craziness.\nShe had already tied up her big, loose, wavy red hair and as soon as the last dish was served, Zhuang Chen chimed: “I’ll start eating!” Then she darted her chopsticks toward the nearest plate of braised carp. Right after she had shoved it into her mouth, she exaggeratedly shouted before she could taste it properly: “It’s so delicious!”\nGu Ning knew she was just trying to support her so she couldn’t help but smiled.\nJi JiuZe looked at the plate of sweet and sour pork ribs placed in front of him and was a little surprised when he glanced at Gu Ning. How did she find out that he liked sweet food? Then he took a piece of the sweet and sour ribs, slightly lowered his head, and ate the small piece. After a few bites, he was slightly surprised that the food was indeed more than just being nicely presented.\n“Gu Ning, how do you cook all these dishes? It’s so delicious!” Zhang XiaoBai said vaguely as he stuffed all the vegetables into his mouth.\nYi ShaoQing’s mouth was full of food, but he still managed to spare a bit of breath and exclaimed: “It’s really so yummy!”\nZhuang Chen could no longer care to speak, she just kept nodding her head and then tasted every dish on the table.\nAt the end of the meal, there were only some sauces left on the dishes, and even the sauce from the stir-fried beef with chilies was mixed with rice by Yi ShaoQing who loves spicy food most. On the contrary, the pot of soup was too much to be finished. Zhuang Chen held her stomach and rested on the chair with satisfaction.\nThe others winded up all the food and filled their stomachs to the brim, but only Ji JiuZe had a brief taste of each dish, and then finished half a bowl of the fresh seafood soup.\nIt was a great tribute to the chef that their dishes were cleared so clean. Gu Ning also felt very satisfied, she didn’t eat much so after sitting for a while, she got up and started cleaning up the mess on the table.\nJi JiuZe, however, silently carried the dinner plate from the table and walked to the kitchen. Gu Ning hurriedly went over and tried to take the plate off his hand: “Captain, let me do it!”\nJi JiuZe, however, dodged Gu Ning’s hand as he raised it up and then explained: “You are responsible for cooking so I am responsible for cleaning it up.”\nWith such a logical answer, Gu Ning was too embarrassed to grab the plate he was holding on to.\nThus, she went back to collect other plates.\nWith a few trips, the table was clean and cleared.\nWhen Gu Ning wiped the table clean and prepared to wash the dishes, she was shocked to see that Ji JiuZe had already put on his apron and even wore one of the gloves. Seeing that Gu Ning was walking over to him hurriedly, he turned his back to Gu Ning while wearing the other glove and instructed: “Help me tie my apron.”\nGu Ning subconsciously began to help him tie the string on the back of his apron —— only after tying, then she asked weakly as if she had just woke up from a dream: “Why don’t I do it……”\nJi JiuZe snapped open the tap and Gu Ning promptly went up to pour the detergent into the sink.\nJi JiuZe took the sponge and started washing the dishes, while Gu Ning stood beside him in a slightly awkward manner, feeling like she had no idea whether to stand here or leave. Just when she was hesitating to give all the space to Ji JiuZe, he had finished washing the first plate and passed it to the side very naturally. It was right in front of Gu Ning, who froze for a moment and then took the plate, wiped it clean with a dry cloth, and then kept it back in the cabinet beside her before receiving the second plate and continued……\nTwo figures, one tall and one short, accompanied by the sound of running water, didn’t communicate with each other in any way but just simple gestures of handing and receiving. It was so incomparably harmonious and natural.\nMeanwhile, Zhuang Chen and Yi ShaoQing’s eyes were staring at them with their body being petrified…..\nAfter a long while before Zhuang Chen blinked and asked Yi ShaoQing: “Have you ever seen Ji JiuZe do the dishes?”\nYi ShaoQing stiffened and shook his head.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ahem… I’ve retraced back all the support I had received, so here is a small list of chapters I’m owing XD.

She switched on her phone while charging and there was numerous missed call. The first number was not saved but Gu Ning knew it was Jiang Yu’s number. The next ten or so were all from home.\nGu Ning had an ominous feeling in her heart and immediately dialled back.\n\n\n\nMother Gu’s anxious voice rang out: “Hello! NingNing ah. Why is your phone off? I couldn’t find you even if I wanted to, I was so worried.”\nGu Ning replied: “My phone ran out of battery. What’s happened?”\nMother Gu answered: “Aiya, remember you left something at home, that particularly pretty little green bowl?”\nGu Ning’s heart thumped and couldn’t help but interrupt Mother Gu sharply: “Don’t tell me it’s broken?!”\n“That’s not it.” Mother Gu replied.\nGu Ning relaxed a bit.\nThen she heard Mother Gu explaining: “It’s just that your cousin had borrowed it.”\nGu Ning jerked up and asked: “What do you mean? What do you mean she borrowed it? Why did she borrow it for? Who gave her permission to borrow it?!”\nThe urgent questioning from Gu Ning startled Mother Gu: “What’s wrong, is it something valuable? She said she is borrowing it to film a TV show. I asked her to call you but your phone was turned off…. Your father came back and grumbled at me and told me to call you as soon as possible. Don’t worry too much, she said she is just borrowing for a day or two and will return it to you right away.”\nGu Ning only felt a breath of anger being held in her chest but she couldn’t vent it at Mother Gu so she just said: “I’ll call her.” Then she hung up the phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“She had hung up.” Mother Gu looked at Father Gu guiltily.\nFather Gu glanced at her and then nagged: “I’ve told you before not to touch NingNing’s things when she’s not at home. You’re even better, you let Jiang Yu take it straight away. When Gu Ning was a child, those bronze figurines of hers, you gave to Jiang Yu and NingNing still remember the incident till now. After so many years, you still haven’t learned. Later on, if your daughter resented you in her heart, don’t come crying to me.”\nMother Gu was also full of grievances: “She went into NingNing’s room and took it out herself. It’s already in her hands and I’m too embarrassed to reject her pleading.”\n“Next time when NingNing is out, you should just lock her room. That Jiang Yu too, how can she just casually enter someone’s room and touches their things when they’re not in. It’s just so rude.” Father Gu continues nagging with a frown.\nMother Gu knew that Father Gu had never liked Jiang Yu. Moreover, she felt that it was her fault that she allowed Jiang Yu to take away Gu Ning’s stuff so she just kept quiet and listened.\nAfter Gu Ning had found Jiang Yu’s number and dialled it, the soft music ringtone only made her feel so anxious.\nHowever, at the end of the phone call, there was only a mechanical female voice saying that the number she had dialled was temporarily unanswered and please try again later.\nGu Ning called several times but no one answered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTaking a few deep breaths, Gu Ning calmed down and recalled Jiang Yu’s home number, and dialled over.\nThe phone rang four times before it was picked up.\nJiang YueZhou’s voice rang out: “Hello, who is this?”\nGu Ning asked directly: “Is Jiang Yu home?”\n“Looking for Jiang Yu ah, she hasn’t come back yet. She’s not living here now so you are…..” Jiang YueZhou stared inexplicably at the phone which was hung up.\n“Who is it?” Lin MeiFeng asked.\nJiang YueZhou replied: “I don’t know…… it seems a bit like Gu Ning’s voice but I’m not too sure.”\nWhen Lin MeiFeng heard it might be Gu Ning, she immediately perked up: “This Gu Ning, she didn’t even come to visit us when she had returned. Really, she couldn’t be expecting us, the elders, to visit her especially instead?”\nJiang YueZhou expressed his dissatisfaction: “You should cut the crap. Gu Ning has recently returned and no one knows what she has been through. I only have this niece, can’t you say something nice instead? What’s wrong with us going over to visit her?”\nLin MeiFeng sneered: “Well well well, the younger generation doesn’t pay respect and visit the elders but we have to go and visit her instead?!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJiang YueZhou didn’t bother to argue with her and called Gu Ning’s home to ask about her recent condition.\nGu Ning hung up Jiang YueZhou’s phone and called Jiang Yu again but there was still no answer.\nMother Gu said that Jiang Yu had taken her things away to record a show yet Gu Ning didn’t even know what show it was.\nWhen Jiang Yu didn’t answer her phone, Gu Ning had no way of locating her.\nAfter waiting patiently for half an hour, she tried dialling Jiang Yu’s number again.\nThis time, the result was still the same, the call was unanswered.\nGu Ning was very annoyed at her own carelessness, but there was nothing she could do…… Gu Ning was seated on her bed thinking before she suddenly stood up, walked out of her room, and headed straight to find Zhuang Chen. She knocked at her door a few times and waited.\nZhuang Chen opened the door with her facial mask still on her face and was a little surprised: “Gu Ning? Is there something wrong?”\nGu Ning asked directly: “It’s like this, I have a problem.  If I want to find someone but this person doesn’t answer their phone. Do you have any way of helping me to find them?”\nZhuang Chen smiled as soon as she heard the request: “Then, you’ve found the right person.”\nOn the other hand, Jiang Yu was already in the recording of the show at the TV station.\nThis was a treasure appraisal show, an improvised version of the older treasure hunting show.\nA great deal of money was spent in bringing in the master of treasure appraisal society, along with a brand new group of expert examiners. In addition, the previous host who was rather dull in their way of presenting was replaced by another new male host who was calm, funny, and very knowledgeable. All these innovative changes had brought the show ratings to a new height.\nOne of the improvisations was to divide the previous single show format into several treasure appraisal segments which would capture and hold onto the audiences’ curiosity. The first segment was to have an overview in which the experts had to gauge the item based on the photographs provided by the crew. Afterward, the actual item would be brought out for the appraisal from them before concluding the final verdict. The experts had to share their opinions at the end of each segment while the master of the treasure appraisal society would be the one who had the final say in the end.\nFor the best effect of the show, the items were kept in high confidential and the experts would not be able to know it until the recording.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe host started the show introduction before moving on to the topic of the day.\nAn enlarged photograph appeared on the big screen and the first item of the day was shown. There were five photographs of each item and each photo could only be viewed for twenty seconds. Later on, there would be a five minutes pause for the experts to share their opinions and discussion on the item before moving on to the next item.\nThe celadon sunflower wash was arranged as the sixth showcase and was the last item of the day.\nThe first five items were mediocre and those experts were leaning lazily in their chairs without spending too much focus on them and commented on the items with some brief descriptions. The master appraiser was even sipping his tea slowly, occasionally raising his eyes to look at them.\nAs soon as the celadon sunflower wash appeared on the screen, the experts who had been mingling with each other sat up straight and even subconsciously leaned forward to look at the screen. The camera zoomed in on the experts’ expressions, capturing their shocked look which was a stark contrast to their previous casual and disinterested look.\nEven the master who was sitting leisurely drinking tea covered the lid and stared at the screen with surprise.\nAn expert whose expression was filled with disbelief asked: “Isnt’ this, isn’t this the Northern Song Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash?”\nThe expert examiner beside him was much calmer, the shock on his face was only for a moment when he saw the photo and by now, he had already regained his composure before commenting with slight disdain: “One of the two celadon sunflower wash is in the museum in Country Y. The other one is in Hong Kong. I think this is an imitation in all probability.”\nUpon hearing his statement, the other few experts who were full of amazement collected their composures and astonishment.\nThe middle-aged man in his fifties who was seated beside him in a green robe sneered: “Li YaoXian, aren’t you too presumptuous? Since there are two of the items, who says there won’t be a third? This is only the first photo and you’ve already concluded that it’s a fake?”\n“Haha! The two experts have already fired up as soon the item is shown.” The host smiled and tried to explain: “I assume that the audiences here and those in front of the TV are not quite sure about the origin of the celadon sunflower wash. Therefore, I will start by giving you all a brief introduction. The full name of this antique is Northern Song Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash. Right now, there is only two existence are known, one of which is kept in a museum in Country Y. The other one fetched an astronomical price of 200 million dollars during an auction in Hong Kong in 2012! Fellow audiences! That’s 200 million dollars ah!”\nThe audience that was presented in the recording all drew in a cold breath and immediately stared at the celadon sunflower wash on the screen and exchanged whispers among themselves.\nThe five photos were quickly shown.\nIt was time for the experts to officially begin their verbal sparring.\nThe middle-aged man in the green robe who had dismissed the other expert who commented that the item was a forgery said: “As we all know, the Ru-Kiln is the pinnacle of Chinese porcelain history, with a history of over 900 years. As the host has explained, another celadon sunflower wash had fetched a record price of over $200 million in Hong Kong and is now in a private collection. If this is the real deal, then I can guarantee that if it is taken to auction, it will definitely set a new world auction record for the Song Dynasty porcelain!”\nLi YaoXian sneered back: “You are talking about how much it is worth when the verdict of the item authenticity is not out yet. No wonder your antique shop is getting bigger and bigger, after all, you are just a businessman.”\nThe host interrupted the tensed bickering and shifted the focus to other experts: “What about the fellow experts, what are your thoughts about this?”\nIndeed, they couldn’t tell much from just a few photos but this was just the flow of the show, and everyone else shared their opinions before moving on to the next segment.\nThe items were brought out by the owner of the item.\nThe experts had shown a lack of enthusiasm for the first five items and just gave very brief reviews and conclusion on it. Luckily, the host was able to chime in some gags occasional to prevent the show from getting dull as it was clear that the main highlight of today’s show was the last item.\nWhen Jiang Yu walked out with the delicate box in her hand, everyone felt refreshed at the sight of her.\nJiang Yu walked out, wearing a pair of high heels which made her figure look tall and slender. Her hair was pulled back into a bun, her skin was fair and her make-up today made her look very gentle and beautiful. She wore a gracious and warm smile, making everyone feel that this girl was very pleasant to the eyes at first glance.\nHowever, the eyes of the experts were all focused on the box she held in her hands.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: This Jiang Yu … arghh… shameless. Tsk tsk. Thank you all for reading and sorry for the late update as I was linking the chapters. Next chapter will be up soon. )\n\n",
    "97": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-97/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe experts gathered around the celadon sunflower wash, leaning slightly over to look at the details. With such examination, they became more astonished.\nThe time limit for this segment was only three minutes.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the three minutes were up, all the experts had to return to their seats. Several of their gazes collided and they all saw the disbelief in each other’s eyes. Immediately, when they were back in their seats, they started exchanging their opinions and discussion.\nJiang Yu still had a gentle and serene smile on her face, but if looked closely, the smile on her face had stiffened. She was very uneasy but the current atmosphere in the show recording was very intense.  The experts in the room began to debate the authenticity of the celadon sunflower wash between Li YaoXian and the middle-aged man in green robe, Lin YunZhi, point of view.\nJiang Yu originally thought it was just a pretty-looking bowl. Initially, she had brought it over to make up the number but she had never expected that it would be chosen for the show by He YouPing at first glance.\nIn the scene when an expert called out the name of Northern Song Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash, Jiang Yu was in shock. Although she didn’t know exactly what a celadon sunflower wash was, she knew what Northern Song Ru-Kiln meant, as well as the saying “even if the family fortune is worth ten thousand, it’s incomparable with a good piece of Ru-Kiln”.\nOn second thought, she thought that it was probably a fake that Gu Ning had found at a street stall. Yet when she brought the item up to the stage and showed it to the experts, Jiang Yu felt that she had thought very wrongly about this item’s origin.\nThe entire studio, including the audience and the host on stage, were in an uproar when the master of treasure appraisal confirmed that this piece was indeed the third surviving celadon sunflower wash! Jiang Yu was even more dumbfounded and stunned.\nThe show director didn’t miss this wonderful scene and the camera was focused on Jiang Yu’s face to capture her expression in all its glory.\nThe thing that she thought Gu Ning had found on a street stall was actually worth 200 million dollars?!\nBefore she could regain her composure, she heard the host beside her ask excitedly: “Miss, you must be overjoyed now, let me do a quick interview with you alright. Did you know beforehand that this is a Northern Song Ru-Kiln? Did you know that it is worth that much money?”\nJiang Yu’s mind felt so empty with the sudden confusion and she couldn’t understand properly what the host was asking and just shook her head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe host chuckled and joked: “It seems that this lady here has been overwhelmed by this heavenly fortune! Let me ask you a few questions while you calm down. May I ask what kind of profession are you currently working in?”\nJiang Yu finally came back to her sense a little: “Business manager.”\n“Wow, a manager at such a young age. Very impressive.” The host praised Jiang Yu and then asked curiously: “I’m particularly curious right now, what are your feeling? Is it too difficult to believe it? Or are you overjoyed?”\nThe expression on Jiang Yu’s face was a little stiff: “I felt it’s a little bit unbelievable…..” In fact, currently, she was full of thoughts about where Gu Ning had gotten this thing.\n“Is it convenient to ask then, what is the origin of this item? Has it been handed down from your ancestors or is it from another source?”\nJiang Yu looked at the cameras and the microphones that were pointed at her as she answered: “This was handed down to me by my grandfather when he passed away. He said it was a dowry for me, and I didn’t expect it to be that expensive.”\nAfterward, she couldn’t quite remember what the host had said or asked, and the recording ended with her confusion and goosebumps rising on her back.\nAs soon as she got off the stage, Jiang Yu hugged the delicate box, carried her handbag, and hurried into a bathroom cubicle. She sat on the toilet and began to force herself to calm down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhere did Gu Ning get this thing from? The way she had placed it casually next to her computer desk, it’s almost as if that thing was something invaluable….. Then is it possible that Gu Ning didn’t even know that it was a genuine antique? Or know how much it was worth? Jiang Yu’s mind flashed through many inappropriate thoughts in this instant, not knowing whether she was overly excited or she was guilty, all she could only feel right now was her heart pounding loudly……\nShe took several deep breaths before her racing heart finally calmed down, then she took out her phone from her handbag. When she saw that there were six missed calls on her phone and all were from Gu Ning, her heart thudded and her body instantly froze. Her mind turned rapidly for excuses as she dialled Gu Ning’s number.\nThe call was quickly answered.\nJiang Yu tried to sound calm: “Hello, Gu Ning? I saw that you’ve called me several times, hey is there something wrong?”\nThere was a moment of silence on the other side of the phone.\nJiang Yu’s heart was lifted with anxiety, but she concentrated even more to catch the voice coming from the receiver, even to the point of holding her breath.\nThen Gu Ning’s voice sounded with a slightly icy tone: “Oh. I called you a few times because I saw that you gave me a call previously and thought that you were looking for me. So why do you call me for?”\nJiang Yu quickly analysed Gu Ning’s words and got the information that Gu Ning didn’t even know that she had taken her things right now! She relaxed slightly and tried to make herself sound a little more natural: “It’s like this, I saw that little green bowl in your room, it looked particularly nice, so I wanted to ask where you bought it?” Although she had tried her best to relax, there was still a slight tremor in her voice because she was so nervous.\nThere was a silence on the receiver again for a moment.\nJiang Yu’s heart was lifted once again…..\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThen she heard Gu Ning’s voice ranging out again and sounded a little absently: “Oh, I didn’t buy it. It’s a gift from a friend. What’s wrong?”\nJiang Yu’s throat tightened with anxiety: “I went to your house today and saw that little bowl was especially pretty, so I was wondering if you could give that little bowl to me?”\nAs if Gu Ning was deliberately trying to make her nervous, the other end of the phone was once again quiet. If it was the usual, Jiang Yu would have questioned her why she was speaking so slowly, but today, she was very patient…..\nUnfortunately, this time what she had waited for was an answer that she didn’t want to hear. Gu Ning replied: “Sorry, because it’s from a friend and I like it too so I can’t give it to you.”\n“Ah so…..” Jiang Yu struggled to explain: “Gu Ning, I’m telling you now but don’t be angry with me okay. That bowl is with me right now, I saw it this afternoon and it looks too pretty. I was so captivated by it that I asked Eldest Aunt to lend it to me for a while and since you don’t want to give it to me, then I’ll return it to you some other time.”\nThe phone was hung up abruptly.\nJiang Yu stared at her phone for a long while before she suddenly stood up, carried her bag, and headed out. When she was back at the guest lounge, she saw that He YouPing was chatting with other guests.\nAs soon as He YouPing saw Jiang Yu, he rushed over excitedly without waiting for Jiang Yu to greet him: “Jiang Yu, I’ve been looking for you and thought that you’ve run away! You had struck a fortune! That antique is actually genuine! If you put it up for auction, that’s will be at least 200 million dollars! Where did you get this antique? Don’t forget about your senior, me, when you make a fortune okay. If it wasn’t for me, you probably wouldn’t have known it was worth that much money.”\nJiang Yu, on the contrary, suddenly grabbed He YouPing’s hand with a certain cold glint in her eyes and stared unblinkingly at He YouPing: “Senior, can you not air this episode?!”\nHe YouPing was stunned for a moment: “Of course not! Do you know how much it costs to hire those experts to record a show? Especially that elderly gentleman, we had been through a lot of trouble to ask him for……” He suddenly stopped at this point and looked at Jiang Yu strangely: “What do you actually mean?”\n“It means that she’s trying to steal the item which doesn’t belong to her.”\nAn unexpected voice rang out.\nThe voice was not too loud but it rang out clearly in the lounge.\nIt was heard by everyone in the lounge, as well as the experts and the elderly gentleman who was about to enter the room from the corridor.\nJiang Yu’s heart jumped so hard that her body stiffened. She slowly turned toward the source of the voice and saw two people who had just walked in through the doorway. One was Gu Ning, and the other was a tall, red-haired, beautiful woman, who Jiang Yu was pretty sure she hadn’t seen before. The red-haired gorgeous female was naturally Zhuang Chen and that previous comment was from her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJiang Yu’s looks were considered to be pretty for anyone who first saw her, but when she was compared to Zhuang Chen, she looks cheap and insignificant.\nEveryone in the lounge, including He YouPing looked dumbfounded for a moment before they noticed the ice-cold expressionless Gu Ning who was standing beside Zhuang Chen.\nA conspicuous short blonde hair with a sickly pale face wearing a grey tracksuit who looks more like a pretty boy than a girl seems very detached and indifferent when she kept quiet. Although she wasn’t too eye-catching when standing beside the glorious beauty, she was not overshadowed by the aura that was emitting from Zhuang Chen.\nWere they the new group from the next shed for the singing competition show?\nHe YouPing thought strangely.\nIt was understandable for him to think so, as neither Zhuang Chen nor Gu Ning looked like “ordinary people” in terms of their looks or their “striking” hair colour and temperament.\nJiang Yu, however, was staring at Gu Ning with a deadly stare. Her face was turning uncontrollably white as she thought of that phone call earlier and couldn’t help but panic: “ Gu Ning, why are you here?”\nZhuang Chen crossed her arms in front of her chest, glanced at the delicate box in Jiang Yu’s hand, and said: “She came to accompany me to collect my things.” After saying these, Zhuang Chen’s expression instantly turned cold, her gaze was sharp like a knife as she coldly addressed Jiang Yu: “Miss Jiang, you took someone else’s stuff without asking and actually went on a TV show with it while claiming it to be yours? I came here by coincidence and just in time to hear you ask if this episode could not be aired. I suppose that you had come up with an ill intention when you’ve learned about the worth of the item and even tried to hide it away secretly. I’ve never seen anyone as shameless and thick-skinned as you.”\nJiang Yu’s expression changed from shock to embarrassment as she noticed that everyone was staring at her. Even though she was already in a state of panic, she still forced herself to calm down before urging Gu Ning: “Gu Ning, let’s go back then talk about it.” She even sent a few winks to Gu Ning, hinting her to go out. Who knew that Gu Ning was simply unfazed by her pleading and just looked at her coldly while watching the scene unfold.\nHe YouPing and the rest were dumbfounded as they never thought that the antique was “stolen” by Jiang Yu and now she was caught in the act……\nHe YouPing glanced at Jiang Yu before asking Zhuang Chen: “Excuse me, lady. Is there any misunderstanding here?”\nZhuang Chen smiled as she gazed condescendingly at Jiang Yu and sneered: “Misunderstanding? Well then, Miss Jiang please explain. Or, do you dare to say that you own this thing?” She shook the phone in her hand and continued: “Miss Jiang can prove her innocence as loudly as she likes.”\nJiang Yu stared at the phone in Zhuang Chen’s hand and recalled the previous phone call she made just now. Her face paled as the countless responses that had been floating around in her mind were all shattered. She could only bite her lips as she glared at Gu Ning.\nSeeing Jiang Yu’s reaction and the state she was in right now, there was nothing more to question about. He YouPing gave Jiang Yu a surprised look but he did not know what else to say in such situations and all he could do was shut his mouth.\nThe others started discussing the sudden occurrence. The few guests who had been jealous and envious of Jiang Yu previously were even more unabashed in their gloating at this point.\n“Since Miss Jiang doesn’t deny that it is not yours. Then please pass it back to its rightful owner.” Zhuang Chen instructed while directly extending her hand to Jiang Yu, and even did a beckoning gesture to indicate her to hand over the celadon sunflower wash. She really didn’t give a damn sh*t to Jiang Yu’s reputation.\nNo one hit Jiang Yu but her face felt so hot and painful as if she had been slapped a dozen times.\nAmid the dozen pairs of gloating eyes in the lounge as well as those from the corridor watching the whole drama, Jiang Yu stiffly placed the delicate box into Zhuang Chen’s hand. She opened her mouth and tried to defend herself. However, as soon as Zhuang Chen got the box, she turned around and left. Gu Ning glanced at her before she left with Zhuang Chen while the sneer and chill in her gaze made a chill run down Jiang Yu’s back abruptly.\nIt was only after a moment before Jiang Yu woke up from the daze and rushed out of the lounge in the direction where Gu Ning and Zhuang Chen had left.\nHe YouPing looked at the director who had also arrived in the lounge at some point and asked: “Director, do we still air this episode??”\nThe director glanced at him as if he was like a fool and replied “Of course! Go air it! Now go to the publicity department and tell them all about what had just happened, organise some highlights and upload them on the internet as soon as possible. Drive-up some news and make sure the editors put in more effort!” The director’s eyes lit up with excitement: “It’ll be hell if this episode rating didn’t explode!”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hurray to Zhuang Chen! for helping Gu Ning!

Love ya!)\n\nHehehe welcome little Nero~\nYes I am overly excited for the adoption right now and it’s been like this for over the weeks. XD\n\n",
    "98": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-98/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Zhuang Chen, thank you so much this time.” Gu Ning looked at the intact celadon sunflower wash in her hand and sighed with relief. If it wasn’t for Zhuang Chen, even if she knew Jiang Yu was at the TV station, she won’t dare to go in so bluntly.\nZhuang Chen replied with a smile: “You’re welcome, just call me next time if there’s something fun like this.”\n\n\n\nGu Ning looked at her helplessly.\nOriginally they intended to come and collect back the celadon sunflower wash from Jiang Yu quietly. Yet they received the phone call just as they arrived at the TV station.\nAlthough Gu Ning knew that Jiang Yu had her heart set on Lu JiaZi and that was eighty percent of the reason why she had deliberately put her in that situation during the post-apocalypse times, she didn’t take it too personally. All she wanted to do was to stay away from her and yet only now did she realise that Jiang Yu was just simply black-hearted. After knowing the true value of the celadon sunflower wash, she actually thought of tricking it out of her hands.\nEven if Gu Ning refused, she could have given the excuse that she had accidentally broken the bowl. As long as that episode was not aired, Gu Ning would never know the value of this Ru-Kiln. According to Gu Ning’s usual character, even if she was angry, she would not have a fall out with Jiang Yu…… Jiang Yu had it all well-planned.\nHowever, all of this was based on the premise that Gu Ning didn’t know the value of the Ru-Kiln.\nJiang Yu was unaware that her well-planned idea and careful probing had completely exposed her ill intention to Gu Ning and Zhuang Chen.\nIf Jiang Yu hadn’t gotten so greedy, Gu Ning would have just taken the bowl back in low profile and wouldn’t gotten Zhuang Chen publicly shame her in the crowd.\nYet, this was a good idea to take this opportunity to have a fall out with her, and its best if Jiang Yu just stopped contacting her.\n“Gu Ning! Hold on!” As they were about to walk out of the TV station’s front gate, Jiang Yu had finally caught up with her.\nZhuang Chen raised her eyebrows and immediately became energetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Gu Ning, I want to talk with you alone.” Jiang Yu gestured with her eyes to hint at Zhuang Chen but Zhuang Chen just looked at her coldly with her arms braced around her chest, without the slightest intention of leaving.\nInstead, Gu Ning asked: “Zhuang Chen, please wait for me in the car okay.”\nZhuang Chen was naturally not afraid that Gu Ning would suffer any loss, she just wanted to stay and watch the fun. Since Gu Ning had asked her to leave, she had no choice but to follow reluctantly.\n“Let’s find a better place to talk.” Jiang Yu said and took Gu Ning to a corner that was slightly out of the way.\nJiang Yu sighed before explaining: “Gu Ning, I know you must have just misunderstood. We both grew up together and have been sisters for over twenty years, don’t you know what kind of person I am?”\nGu Ning glanced at Jiang Yu and the corner of her mouth lifted into a sneer: “Yes. We grew up together, and I didn’t even know that you were such a person.”\nJiang Yu was choked from the reply and then looked at Gu Ning with a painful and disappointed expression before continuing: “Gu Ning, can you at least listen to my explanation……”\nWithout waiting for her to explain more, Gu Ning interrupted coldly: “I know you like Lu JiaZi.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJiang Yu’s pupils contracted uncontrollably: “What?”\nGu Ning’s icy gaze focused on her: “Since such an incident had happened today, I’ll just lay out everything on the table. I don’t know if you fell in love with him at first sight or if I had described him too well that you couldn’t help but be moved, right now, I don’t want to know the reason anymore.” She continued with a smile while sneering: “But for the sake that we used to be close sisters, I will bear the pain and give you, Lu JiaZi.”\nJiang Yu had already been confused by Gu Ning’s words at this point so once she heard that Gu Ning was giving Lu JiaZi to her, she couldn’t help but stared and wondered what she actually meant.\nGu Ning’s smile faded abruptly and became intimidatingly cold: “As for the two of us, first you tried to steal the guy I was interested and now you want to cheat me out of my things. We have a fallout now, so you can stop pretending to be sisterly with me anymore. Even if your face is thicker than a wall and shamelessly enough to insist that you still want to be my sister, I don’t think I can swallow the anger and call you “sister” again. To avoid further embarrassment, the two of us should stop contacting each other in the future. What do you say?”\nGu Ning’s words were like a sharp sword that each one of it hit the bullseye. Jiang Yu wanted to explain further but Gu Ning didn’t give her the chance to do so at all.\nIt was not until Gu Ning had left for a long time that Jiang Yu finally regained her senses and her body shivered from the chill. When did the Gu Ning who used to smile a lot and was very friendly become so sharp-tongued and aggressive?\nThe fact that Gu Ning had completely fallout with Jiang Yu had also helped her to release the anger she had held up. Gu Ning felt so relieved that even her walk was much lighter and she couldn’t help but smiled.\nJust after she had walked out of the front gate, several people were heading in her direction.\nWhen Gu Ning saw them, she was stunned on the spot.\nXiang Xu, who was wearing a small white cotton dress, and Xiang Yu, who was wearing a white shirt, were being surrounded by several adults and walking towards the front gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOne of the scriptwriters was patiently reminding Xiang Xu of the precautions to be taken during the recording of the program, while the eight-year-old Xiang Xu’s tender face was calm and unruffled. As if sensing the gaze, Xiang Xu suddenly looked at Gu Ning. After noticing that Gu Ning was just simply staring at her, she glanced at her blonde hair with a slight probe of curiosity before turning her gaze away. Whereas Xiang Yi didn’t even look at her, just like a stranger.\nIndeed, they were stranger in this world. Gu Ning watched in silence as that group of people got on the lift while she smiled in assurance before walking away from the TV station.\nThe two of them drove back and halfway down the street, Zhuang Chen dragged Gu Ning out of the car and brought a large pile of midnight snacks when they returned. They had already heard about the value of the celadon sunflower wash at the TV station, but Zhuang Chen didn’t even ask a single question about how she gained such a valuable item or so on the way back. This made Gu Ning feel inexplicably touched and nostalgic.\nIt was already ten in the morning when she returned to the post-apocalyptic world. She hadn’t returned the whole day yesterday and when she opened the door and walked out see the living room full of people. Brother San, Zhang XiaoBai, Fang Fa, Cheng Ming, and the rest were all present, whereas usually they would be gone out hunting by this time.\n“Did something happen?” Gu Ning asked.\n“A few kids ran away.” Father Gu replied.\nGu Ning frowned and walked over: “What does this mean?”\nZhang XiaoBai’s face was grim as he explained: “This morning, I took them out for a morning run and when we reached the river, some boys pushed Zuo You into the river. Zuo You couldn’t swim and I was running at the front so I had no idea what had happened at the back. If it wasn’t for Wo Wo and Wu Sen to save him, Zuo You would have drowned. I yelled and reprimanded those boys on the spot, they called us biased then ran away in a huff. Till now they still haven’t returned.”\nThe three of them, Wu Sen, Wo Wo, and Zuo You, stood at the side as if they had done something wrong. Their heads hung low for the fear of being scolded by Gu Ning.\nGu Ning asked: “Come over here, Zuo You.”\nWith a tremble of his chubby body, he looked at Wo Wo and Wu Sen, then a terrified glance at Gu Ning before moving over with small steps.\nGu Ning asked; “Tell me about the whole incident again. Why did they push you into the river?”\nZuo You was a bit scared but he answered honestly: “I don’t know, I was just running like the usual routine, they suddenly rushed toward me and knocked me into the river……. It’s all my fault that they ran away because I caused them to be scolded by Brother XiaoBai.”\nWo Wo interjected in a hurry: “Sister Gu Ning, it’s really not Zuo You’s fault! They often sneakily bully Zuo You when the adults aren’t around! They said that sister, you were biased and only treat the three of us the best! That Zhou Jian is the worst! They did it on purpose and try to kill Zuo You!”\nFather Gu informed Gu Ning: “Zhou Jian is the oldest boy among them. He is a very impetuous and defiant person, and when he was asked to train, he was always lazy about it. Also, his personality is very rebellious so it’s difficult to discipline him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhong Xu also added in: “This Zhou Jian found us on his own, saying that his parents had been bitten to death by the zombies. We took pity on him and let him stay. He is quite clever and is very good at talking but he isn’t honest. At first, he would steal food from other children, and after we told him off a few times than he stopped. The other children who followed him are those who he play well with.”\nGu Ning frowned, it seems that this child named Zhou Jian had pushed Zuo You into the river not because they were too playful and gone over the limit, but there was a possibility that he really wants to kill someone…..\nGu Ning pondered, then asked: “Have you guys found them yet?”\nBrother San answered: “I’ve asked Luo Long to bring several people to look everywhere in the base but they haven’t found them yet.”\nGu Ning instructed: “Then let Luo Long and the others come back. There’s no need to go and look for them anymore.”\nThe room was quiet for a moment as no one expected Gu Ning to make such a decision and only Hong Jie smiled slightly upon hearing it.\nBrother San noticed the changes in Hong Jie’s expression and then asked: “What do you mean by that Gu Ning? Let them find their way back?”\n“No.” Gu Ning explained: “They can leave as and when they want but that doesn’t mean that they can just return because they wanted to. Tell the caretaker downstairs that if those children who ran away returned, don’t let them in. As of today, they are no longer with us. You all should treat them as strangers when you see them next time.”\nThe less than twenty or so children who were left behind didn’t dare to speak up when they heard Gu Ning’s words.\nZhang Yang was the most soft-hearted and upon hearing this, he couldn’t help but plead for those runaway children: “Gu Ning, they are still kids, after all, inevitably, they do not understand……”\n“It’s now four months into the post-apocalyptic era, and they no longer qualify not to understand how to behave.” Gu Ning glanced at the group of children who were shocked by her words and warned coldly: “If I find anyone of you bullying one another next time, I will just kick you out.”\nAlthough Gu Ning had never lost her temper with them and could even be described as gentle, the cold and cool aura emitting from Gu Ning made the children admire her in awe. Moreover, they had heard so much about her “heroic deeds” which made them look up to her even more. Yet, right now, Gu Ning’s anger made all the children in the room went silent and even held onto their breaths.\nIt took a while before they were all let out and the room was left with the adults.\nThe runaway children took everyone by surprise as they didn’t expect such problems to arise despite the comfortable environment they had provided. It could be said that they thought too simply of these children, thinking that they would behave if they were just given food and water. However, where there were people, conflicts and contradictions were bound to arise. Even though they were still children, their personalities might have changed subtly as their surroundings changed. Some were for the better whereas some were for the worse.\nIt was the first time something like this had happened to the team and Gu Ning hoped that it would be the last.\nHong Jie took the lead in breaking the depressing and sullen atmosphere and instructed Brother San: “Xiao Xie, later on, you should arrange for a few men to bring those children out for a stroll around the base and show them how other survivors lived. Don’t let us feed them for nothing and ended up raising a bunch of white-eyed wolves (ingrates).”\nBrother San understood the importance behind these teaching and nodded solemnly: “Alright.”\nThere were six boys and a ten-year-old girl who followed Zhou Jian in the runaway. They were nestling behind a tent, peeking cautiously at Luo Long, who was searching for them anxiously. The only girl in the runaway group asked in a whisper: “Zhou Jian, can we go out now? We’ve been hiding for so long.”\n“What do you know?!” Zhou Jian replied smugly: “If we go back so soon, what’s the point of running away? We might even get scolded when we got back. Did you see those people who come looking for us? We’ll go out once they are very desperate in finding us.  Not only will they not scold us but they might even scold Wu Sen and the others instead.”\nThe girl answered aggrievedly: “But I want to go back now.”\n“Shhh!” Another little boy who was staring at the scene hushed: “Brother XiaoBai is heading over, is he here to find us too?”\nThe rest cautiously poked their heads out to look. Sure enough, they saw Zhang XiaoBai talking to Luo Long who seemed very surprised.\nZhou Jian commented excitedly: “Look, now all of them came to look for us.”\nJust as his sentence ended, he saw Zhang XiaoBai and Luo Long walked away while they continued chatting.\nThe girl exclaimed: “They’re leaving!”\nAs if they heard the exclamation from them, Zhang XiaoBai turned his head and glanced over. Zhou Jian met the gaze of Zhang XiaoBai and he was startled. His eyes flickered uneasily and were hesitated if he should go out and leave with Zhang XiaoBai or if they should continue running away. Yet he saw the strange changes in Zhang XiaoBai’s expression —— Then to his amazement, Zhang XiaoBai shifted his gaze away, pretended not to notice them while walking away in the direction of the dormitory building, chatting and laughing with Luo Long.\nWhat happened? Zhou Jian had a big question mark on his mind. Zhang XiaoBai had clearly seen him just now? Why didn’t he come and catch them back?\n“Oh no! They’ve gone back! They’re not searching for us anymore?!” A young boy stood up and looked at Zhang XiaoBai and Luo Long’s back view and asked anxiously: “Zhou Jian?! What should we do now?!”\nZhou Jian was still frozen and overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events.\nThe girl panicked and called out to them: “Brother XiaoBai! Brother Luo Long! We’re here!”\n“XiaoBai, are we really going to leave them alone?” Luo Long asked with some hesitation as they walked away.\nZhang XiaoBai, on the contrary, seemed much more straightforward: “Hong Jie already said that we don’t raise white-eyed wolves (ingrates). Let’s go.”\nZhang XiaoBai and Luo Long must have heard them but they continued strolling away as if they heard nothing, not even glancing back.\nThe several children stood at the hideout helplessly but they didn’t dare to go after them. All of them looked at each other but there was nothing they could do for now and there was a sudden infinite fear creeping upon them.\nThe girl cried in fear as she saw the two brothers walking further away: “Waaahh —— what should we do now! They don’t want us anymore!”\nZhou Jian stood stiffly at the spot, staring at the backs of the two brothers when he suddenly realized that he had made a wrong choice and it could lead to serious consequences. Then it was as if he had thought of something extremely frightening that his small face went pale with fear and his whole body was shivering…..\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Muahahahaha I’m back… kinda!!! Sorry for the missing weeks and I will try to translate it faster. Well actually… I’m dying from taking care of Nero… He just bite a lot… a lot….

    "99": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-99/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBy the time the few children all came back to their senses, Zhang XiaoBai and Luo Long had already disappeared without even a trace.\n“Zhou Jian, what should we do now?! They seem to have gone straight back.” A young boy asked in fear: “Let’s head back quickly. Even if we get scolded, it’s better than being kicked out!”\n\n\n\nThe other children all chimed in: “Yeah, Zhou Jian! Let’s go back now!”\nZhou Jian slowly calmed down his emotions, he thought about it and felt that they were just scaring them, how could they just leave them alone? They’ll forgive them as long as they went back and admit their wrongdoings. He was only thirteen and still considered a child so they must be just scaring them. With this thought in mind, Zhou Jian wasn’t afraid and then said to the younger children: “What’s with all the racket! It’s all because of your cowardice, how can you all beat Wu Sen when you’re such cowards? That’s enough! Now it’s you all who want to go back, not me.”\n“Fine, okay, stop talking. Let’s hurry back.” Several young boys couldn’t care less about anything at this point and just urged on.\nThus, the few of them returned to the dormitory building.\n“What, what did you say? Why won’t you let us in? We live on the third floor!” Zhou Jian asked anxiously.\nIt turned out that they were stopped by the caretaker when they reached the entrance of the dormitory building and were denied of entries so they were all in a panic.\nThere were two men in-charge of the dormitory building, just in case of those ordinary survivors tried to break in, and one of the caretakers replied: “Show me your passes.”\nZhou Jian answered: “We came out in a hurry so we didn’t bring it with us. Uncle, just let us in, please! We come in and out of here every day, don’t you recognise us?”\nThe two caretakers did recognise them but Zhang XiaoBai had already informed them so they naturally wouldn’t let these children in and stated: “We don’t recognise others, only the passes.”\nZhou Jian panicked: “We really do live here. You can go up to the third floor and ask them if you don’t believe us!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“What’s the point of asking?!”The other caretaker obviously had lost his temper and told them directly: “They’ve specifically informed us that you’re no longer with them anymore! From now on, you’ll go and sleep outside in tents. There’s no more room for you in here.” He continued with another sneering: “I heard that it’s you kids who ran away on your own? You all are so unaware of your blessings. You kids can’t even lift a knife and aren’t even related to any one of them personally. They feed and took care of you all for free yet your kids aren’t satisfied by it. You all should leave now! Go and see if there is anyone out there who will be willing to take you in!” When this caretaker saw that Brother San had brought so many children with them, he thought that they were at least related to each other. However, as he found out that they were all orphans which they had picked up on the way, he couldn’t help but admire Brother San’s doings. Therefore, right now he couldn’t stand the children and outright lashed out at them.\nThe girl cried immediately in shock: “Wahh —— how now?! We’ve really been kicked out! They really don’t want us anymore!”\n“What, what do we do now Zhou Jian.” The other boys panicked all at once.\nZhou Jian’s face was white, his legs went weak and his whole mind was buzzing.\nAs Hong Jie had proposed was very effective, Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu took the children out for a stroll to look at how the other survivors lived in the tent area. When the children returned, they all seemed to be lost in the shock of the situation of other survivors and behaved exceptionally well.\nAt the same time, Zhong Xu also expressed concern about the current state of the base.\nThe vast majority of the survivors in the base, adults, and children were all starving and skinny. The base would provide very watery porridge and each person would only receive a bowl per day which could only keep them alive but not enough to provide any extra energy to do other stuff. When there was nothing to do, they tried not to move as much as possible and only speak when they were required as they feared not having enough drinkable water. Those who were not capable of killing the zombies generally stay in their tents.\nSome of the jobs available at the base only require young and strong workers, and the work they do was labour work such as carrying bricks, picking up cement, and so on. They would only receive two to three packs of biscuits or two to three sausages with a slice of bread for the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe more daring ones would register at the management office and head out to kill the zombies in teams. If they were lucky enough to be recruited by a team with special abilities users, their chances of survival would increase. If they had a chance to come back and the team had a very good harvest that day, then it would be way more worthy as compared to staying and working at the base for a month of supplies.\nGenerally, only daring young adults were more likely to gain such opportunities.\nIn fact, it was no longer a secret that Gu Ning and her team had around ten special abilities users. Some of the abilities users who had arrived at the Zhongnan base before them had formed their own team over time, and they had at least shown a very friendly attitude towards Gu Ning team’s arrival. One by one, they asked the Third Company team if they were willing to form alliances with them. What did a team of ten special abilities users mean in this current situation? It meant that they didn’t need to recruit any outsider’s help every time they went out to hunt the zombies. Moreover, the other teams had noticed that the Third Company team always came back with as many men as they went out with each time. They had arrived at the base for over half a month and there hadn’t even been a single casualty which was truly incredible.\nTo the rest of the teams in the base, the Third Company team was mysterious.\nFrom the few scraps of information that the other teams had received, they only knew that the Third Company team was of military origin which made it difficult for them to understand why they brought those twenty or so children with them who seemed like twenty big bags of burden instead. Furthermore, they were so well-stocked with supplies and even had a special room to contain all of them. Also, they had a doctor on their team with a full range of medication supplies.\nPreviously, they accidentally ran into a child while backing the truck, then the female doctor treated the little child while leaving enough supplies to feed that child’s family for three months on a sparing basis. It was worth mentioning that afterward, someone deliberately tried to get hit by the truck from the Third Company team but they were run over on the spot.  It was not difficult to have a doctor on the team but it was much more challenging to have adequate medication.\nIn response to the frequent gestures of goodwill from the other teams, the Third Company team kept maintaining a relationship that was not too close nor too distanced. If they were asked to team up together to go out hunting the zombies, they would put it off with the excuse that they didn’t need it at the moment. Their team members never act alone and usually travelled in groups of three or five while each one of them was exceptionally alert. Therefore, no other teams could fish out more information from them as they knew what should or shouldn’t be said.\nEvery day at dawn, an adult would run around the base with about twenty or so children and it had become an unusual sight at the base. The survivors in the tent area had gone from shock to amazement to numbness, and some secretly hated the fact that they didn’t even have enough to eat yet this group of people still had the strength to exercise.\nIn the past few days, a piece of news about the Third Company team spread all over the base as if it had grown wings. Both the special abilities users and ordinary survivors knew about this piece of information which was: the girl with short blonde hair in the Third Company team was a Space ability user.\nEveryone knew that by killing a Space ability user, everything that was stored in the space would burst out of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Third Company team was indeed powerful and had ten special abilities users which were definitely intimidating. Yet, equally, the supplies they had were also enough to drive others crazy. Everyone knew that the Space ability users were the team’s mobile warehouse. There was a case where a Space ability user was killed, around three months of supplies for ten people had burst out of the space. Also, the Space ability user was just from a small team of ten people with only one special ability user.\nSurvivors who were starved went mad and driven by desperation sometimes did things that were completely out of their minds.\nCountless pairs of eyes were stalking the team from the shadows.\nBefore the news had spread throughout the base, the staff member who they had met at the gate, informed them of the news and repeatedly explained that it was not leaked by him.\nAfter sending off the staff who was worried about being misunderstood, the remaining people in the room looked gloomy.\nHong Jie jumped straight to conclusions: “It must have been those little brats who leaked the news out.” She said with a frown: “We still aren’t ruthless enough.” She stared at Brother San when she spoke this sentence.\n“F*ck! I’ll go and catch those boys back!” Zhang XiaoBai said as he stood up in a rage.\nHong Jie glanced at him: “What’s the point of capturing them back? To kill them? Are you going to kill them yourself?”\nZhang XiaoBai immediately stopped as if his action was deflated by the question. Although he hated them, he didn’t have the heart to do anything to those children: “So we just let them off the hook?!” Yet, he couldn’t swallow his anger.\nA cold glint shone in Hong Jie’s eyes as she instructed: “Xiang Yi. I’ll leave this matter to you. Find them and break one of the hands of the oldest child. Tell him the reason why we have to break them.”\nXiang Yi didn’t immediately respond but looked at Brother San in silence.\nBrother San was quiet for a moment, then glanced up at Hong Jie: “Hong Jie, if you break his hand, it means you want him to die.”\nHong Jie held onto his gaze steadily: “It is him, who wants Gu Ning to be dead.”\nBrother San went completely silent.\nGu Ning didn’t comment and that was a tacit acceptance of Hong Jie’s suggestion of dealing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHong Jie continued: “Fortunately, Gu Ning had Plant psychic power as an alternative. However, to be on the safe side, Gu Ning, you shouldn’t act alone during this period.”\nJia DaoZhang interjected: “You guys don’t need to be overly worried. I’ve already made a clear inquiry, there is no existing special ability user in this base who can threaten Gu Ning. We just need to be a bit more careful so there’s no need to look so gloomily.”\nThe others couldn’t help but relaxed their tensed nerves when they recalled Gu Ning’s fighting capabilities.\nJust as they were discussing, three cars pulled up at the gate of the base.\nOne by one, a group of people got out of the car. There was a mixture of men and women, all were covered in dust but they were laughing and chatting about the base in front of them.\nThe leader of the group walked up to the registration window at the entrance and asked the staff: “We want to enter the base. What is the process?”\nThe staff member glanced up at him and asked lazily: “Any special abilities users?”\nThe man smiled and replied: “Yes. Thirteen of them.”\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Is there any available spare limbs on sale? I need it as Nero is biting mine too frequently.

    "100": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-100/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter completing all the procedures, the three cars slowly drove into the base.\nIt’s not easy to find someone in a base that big but for Xiang Xu, it was fairly simple.\n\n\n\nXiang Xu was very diligent plus the previous few times when her spiritual power had failed, she was very disappointed in herself. However, the failed blow didn’t stop her from continuing practicing, it rather increased her fighting spirit. Her perseverance in training was almost like a desperate attempt. Every day, whenever she had time, she would engage in intensive spiritual practice, which was a very torturous task. However, Xiang Xu had remarkable persistence and stubbornness, and her unrelenting daily training had allowed her to improve her spiritual power by leaps and bounds.\nShe had no good feelings towards Zhou Jian and the other few children who had been kicked out. Moreover, they placed Gu Ning in danger by spreading the news about her being a Space ability user. Thus, Xiang Xu was even more furious, and her spiritual power directly covered most of the base while it only took less than ten minutes to locate Zhou Jian.\nOriginally they had some doubts about the certainty with which Zhou Jian had spread the news. However, when they found them and saw the uneasy look on their faces, there was no longer any doubt. When Xiang Yi questioned them a few more times, even though Zhou Jian refused to admit anything, the other children all gave an honest account.\nXiang Yi passed the message from Hong Jie to Zhou Jian and all the children immediately turned white with fear. Zhou Jian didn’t even expect that the always smiling Auntie Hong would be so ruthless.\nHe tried to run away but Xiang Yi caught him and pinned him to the ground. Although Zhou Jian was only thirteen years old, he had leeched the Third Company for a month after the apocalypse happened. Despite not having enough to eat till full, they weren’t particularly hungry either.\nAfter Gu Ning had arrived at the Third Company, he had enough supplies to eat and drink so his body wasn’t as weak as the average child survivor in the base. Zhou Jian had grown very tall and was only a head shorter than Xiang Yi. In addition, he was now in a frenzy that even Xiang Yi couldn’t hold him down as he broke free and knocked Xiang Yi’s head with his.\nThe other children were all dumbfounded and didn’t know which side to help. They just stood there and watch the whole scene like logs. Xiang Xu was concerned about Hong Jie’s order to just break Zhou Jian’s hand so she didn’t dare to use her spiritual power as he would be killed easily. There were still some explicit regulations against killing people in the base.\nWhen Xiang Yi saw that Zhou Jian was going to run away, he hurriedly chased after him and swung the iron rod in his hand to hit Zhou Jian’s leg. Yet, before the rod touched Zhou Jian’s leg, he heard Xiang Xu exclaim: “GeGe, be careful!”\nThen he saw a big ball of fire suddenly charging towards him at a very fast speed! Xiang Yi had no time to react! All he heard was a loud bang! The fireball smashed onto Xiang Yi’s body! Sparks flew everywhere! The few children who were watching as well as those on-lookers, all screamed and dodged in fear.\nAs the sparks and flames faded away, the woman who had released the fireball suddenly gave a startled cry. Then she saw Xiang Yu standing there with a shocked expression but he was still intact. She shifted her gaze to the side and saw a little girl around seven or eight years old, staring at her angrily.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nXiang Xu’s face was full of anger at this moment. If she hadn’t reacted quickly and put up a spiritual barrier, Xiang Yi would have been a charred corpse by now!\nAt this moment, Zhou Jian, who had gotten up from the ground, glanced over at the Fire ability user in shock and shouted incredulously: “Sis?!”\nXiang Xu and Xiang Yu’s expression changed as they looked in surprise at the young woman who had suddenly attacked them.\n“Sis! You’re alive!” Zhou Jian ran over and hugged the young woman who was about twenty-two or twenty-three years old and shouted in joy.\nThe young woman patted Zhou Jian’s head and her expression softened considerably.\nThe three cars parked on the other side of the street and those ten or so passengers slowly alight. All of them were looking at Zhou Jian curiously and one of them asked: “Zhou Yan, is this your brother?!”\nA young man smiled and commented: “You’re so lucky! You have found your brother as soon as you arrived!”\nAnother youth glanced at Xiang Yi and Xiang Xu at the other side and remarked somewhat unkindly: “And just in time too.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Yan heard what they had commented, her gaze which had been softened, instantly turned sharp again. After the apocalypse happened, she had been searching for Zhou Jian but she never found him until now. She had never expected to witness Zhou Jian being chased and to be beaten up when she finally was able to reunite with him. When she thought of how much her beloved little brother had suffered during these four months of being apart, Zhou Yan wanted to kill Xiang Yi immediately!\nZhou Yan asked Zhou Jian who was in her arms: “Zhou Jian, tell me, what do you want to deal with these two people?”\nZhou Jian shifted aside from her hug, his eyes fixed deadly on Xiang Xu and Xiang Yi while his expression was indescribably smug and ruthless as he replied: “I want them dead!”\nAt this moment, the leader of the group spoke up: “Do whatever you want with that boy but keep that little girl for me. She actually managed to stop your blow with her spiritual power just now, so interesting.”\nXiang Xu’s spiritual power was so keen that she immediately detected that this woman’s group of friends, all had psychic energy fluctuations in their bodies! When she heard their conversation, she was horrified but tried her best to remain calm and whispered to Xiang Yi: “GeGe, quick run!” Then she grabbed Xiang Yi’s hand and turned around to run.\nJust when they had turned and run a few steps away, a special ability user who was chatting just a moment ago, instantly appeared in front of them, laughing and saying: “You won’t be able to run away kid.”\nXiang Xu’s eyes narrowed as she growled: “GeGe! Quickly go back and inform Sister Gu Ning and the others! I’ll hold them off!”\nThe Speed ability user laughed and commented: “Hahaha! Little girl, you’ve got a whole bunch of nerve to say that!”\n“Now!” Xiang Xu bellowed at Xiang Yi! Then her spiritual power suddenly surged out wildly! Every day, Xiang Xu’s daily training was to practice how to kill people with her spiritual power. Right now, the moment her spiritual energy gushed out, it condensed into the sharp invisible spikes, and then under her spiritual power controlling, a small part of it stabbed towards the Speed ability user in front of her! The majority of them circled in the air and headed directly to the dozen of people behind her!\n“What a powerful spiritual energy! Guo Qiang! Watch out!” A woman in the group shouted in horror while her spiritual power surged out immediately! If spiritual energy could be seen by the naked eye, then they would notice the instantaneous surge of spiritual energy from Xiang Xu was double the amount of spiritual energy from this woman!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe first reaction of the Speed ability user when he heard the woman’s voice was to retreat! Meanwhile, his teammate’s spiritual energy was heading toward him but it was still a moment too slow in his retreating and his teammate’s help was nowhere nearer or faster than Xiang Xu. In this split second, Guo Qiang instantly felt as if millions of needles were stabbed into his skull while he was retreating, and he screamed out as an unimaginably intense pain hit him hard!\nGuo Qiang’s sudden fall to the ground and the sharp scream that burst out of his mouth at the same time caused his teammates’ expression to change abruptly.\nXiang Yi saw that Xiang Xu had already started attacking so he knew beyond doubt that there was no way he could help Xiang Xu by staying behind and the most important thing he should do right now was to run back quickly to report the news. The longer he stayed, the more danger Xiang Xu would be in. Xiang Yi gritted his teeth and turned his head toward the direction of the dormitory building and ran!\n“Trying to run?!” One of the youths in the group took a step forward and stomped hard with his right foot. A vine suddenly sprang up under Xiang Yu’s foot and coiled his ankle! Xiang Yi was unable to react fast enough so his right leg was caught by the vine and he was dragged down to the ground! Xiang Yi’s whole body slumped down and his jaw hit the concrete floor with a heavy thud. A sound of bone cracking was heard as Xiang Yi grunted in pain and tears came out, but what hurt the most was that he had to bite his tongue when his jaw hit the concrete floor. At the same time as a strong smell of blood filled his mouth, his entire body was dragged backward by the vine!\nSuddenly! Out of nowhere, a person grabbed Xiang Yi’s hand and tried yanking him back! Xiang Yi squinted his eyes and saw that the person who grabbed his hand was actually Zuo You! Zuo You tugged hard on his hand as he leaned back fully, fighting with all his might against the tremendous force of the vine while Wu Sen was crouching at his feet with his pocket knife in hand. Wu Sen was quickly cutting away the vine that was coiled around Xiang Yi’s leg.\nWu Sen lowered his voice while cutting the vines and said: “Brother Xiang Yi, Wo Wo has already gone back to call for help!”\nXiang Xu’s spiritual attacks were all blocked away by the other Spiritual ability user except for Guo Qiang.\nAt this point, she had formed a huge three meters wide spiritual barrier to block in front of her. The Spiritual ability user tried to attack and was surprised to find that Xiang Xu’s spiritual barrier didn’t even show the slightest sign of breaking even after receiving her full force! She looked at Xiang Xu’s appearance and she was only around seven or eight years old, how could she have such a strong spiritual power?! It was really beyond her knowledge!\n“Stop wasting time, attack with all our power! Let’s see how long she can last!” After Zhou Yan finished speaking, she took the lead in launching full assault psychic attacks. She had conjured more than ten fireballs instantly and blasted toward Xiang Xu!\nXiang Xu spread opened her arms and widen her spiritual barrier. The moment the dozen or so fireballs hit the spiritual barrier, she felt that it started to shake slightly and immediately increased the output of her psychic energy. Her spiritual energy gushed out wildly into the spiritual barrier once more. However, Xiang Xu’s expression was incomparably gloomy as she stared at the dozen or so special abilities users frantically attacking her spiritual barrier. She felt her spiritual barrier was disappearing rapidly while the psychic energy in her body was depleting at an alarming rate. She knew that with such an intense attack of psychic powers, her spiritual barrier won’t be able to last long!\nHowever, those frantic attackers on the other side were even more horrified! With twelve of them attacking in unison, the little girl across the street, who was just only seven or eight years old, managed to last for almost a full minute! Not to mention the fact that Guo Qiang was lying on the ground who was not known to be alive or dead! This minute might seem short but those who were involved in it felt incredibly long!\nXiang Xu felt every last drop of her psychic energy in her body was being drained away! The spiritual barrier lost the support of her psychic energy and was instantly shattered under the opponent’s continuous psychic attacks! A huge ball of fire flew towards the pale-faced Xiang Xu! It sent a whistling wind and hot air toward her face! Knowing that Xiang Xu was such a strong Spiritual ability user, all they wanted to do now was to eliminate her!\nXiang Xu’s face was lit up by the fireball!\nXiang Yi’s legs were untied at that moment and he subconsciously glanced back! He saw a huge fireball was blasted toward Xiang Xu and she who had her psychic energy completely drained, was no different from any ordinary seven or eight years old little girl. If there was no stopping, she would be blown away directly by this fireball without even leaving a whole corpse. Xiang Yi’s eyes were cracking with anxiety as he cried out: “Xiang Xu!”\nWu Sen lost his voice with Zuo You and both could only stare in horror while being frozen in shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nXiang Xu felt the searing heat that was heading toward her, she shuddered and closed her eyes ——\nRight then!\nXiang Yi felt a blinding wind sweep past him! His eyes widened and he saw a lightning-fast figure dashed toward Xiang Xu! He couldn’t help but hold his breath.\n“Bang!” an explosion! The fireball smashed into the ground with a shower of sparks!\nOn the contrary, Xiang Xu who should have been hit squarely by the fireball disappeared into the thin air and crashed into a tent five metres away from that spot with Fang Fa. Both his hands tightly shielded Xiang Xu in his arms while his back was narrowly grazed by the fireball. There was a big burned hole on his back and his skin was scorched. Fang Fa grimaced in pain but still grinned at Xiang Xu who was trembling in his arms and looked up at him. He comforted her with a smile: “Don’t worry. We’re here.”\nInstead of continuing their attack, Zhou Yan and the attacker’s expression changed as they saw another group of people heading over. It was easy to different out the aura of a special ability user and an ordinary survivor, especially when this was a whole group of special abilities users.\nWhen Zhou Jian saw the group of people walking over, he turned pale with fear and hid behind Zhou Yan.\nThe leader of the group of attackers watched as another group of people headed toward them. He felt the murderous and lethal aura that was emanating from those people and thought that this incident would not be able to end so simply.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Hurray! Chapter 100! Finally!!! My god… took me so long. Sorry guys. XD Well it’s better late than never hehehe. Thank you all once again for your kind patient and understanding.

Some tents had been smashed directly by the fireball and burnt up. Right now, there were only a few blackened iron frames remaining, those who lived in the tents were shifted away. They were standing far away from the drama and not even dared to come forward to ask for compensation for the destroyed tents.\nThe sound caused by the simultaneous attack of more than ten kinds of psychic powers woke up most of the survivors who were still sleeping in their tents. The base explicitly states that no killing in the base but from just the noise, it was way more than just fighting.\n\n\n\nEven in the post-apocalyptic time, human beings were still inevitably fond of watching drama, and within a short while, a circle of survivors was stretched out from afar while stretching their necks to watch the whole scene.\nGu Ning’s blonde hair was a very conspicuous indicator. There were not many teams of special abilities users in the base and they quickly recognised Gu Ning’s team but the other team was unheard of.\nGao Yue quickly rushed over with her medical kit and checked on Xiang Yi’s injuries before she moved promptly to check on Fang Fa and Xiang Xu’s injuries. Xiang Yi’s jaw had scraping marks from the ground, his mouth was full of blood and his jaw showed signs of dislocation. As for Fang Fa, his whole back was scraped by the fireball and a big hole was burnt through the clothes. The skin on his back was scorched and it looked very gruesome. Gao Yue was only slightly relieved after making sure that both of their lives were not in danger. *A transparent crystal core was fed to Xiang Xu while she had lost consciousness due to the overuse of her psychic energy.\n(T/N: ermm… I’ve added that assumption line * to better explain Xiang Xu’s situation.)\nBrother San and the rest were on the face-off with the other team.\nAs the two teams faced off with each other, both were emanating with murderous intent.\nAt this moment, the leader of the other team suddenly stared in astonishment at Gu Ning, who was focused on examining Fang Fa’s injuries. The leader let out a surprised cry: “Gu Ning?”\nGu Ning, who was too engrossed in checking Fang Fa’s injuries, froze for a moment before raising her gaze to look at the man. A hint of dismay flashed through her eyes as well: “Zhang Ji.” Her brow furrowed immediately as the name came out of her mouth while she stood up and asked him sullenly: “I think you need to give me an explanation.”\nIt surprised everyone as the both of them blurted out each other’s names. Obviously, the man on the other team was an old acquaintance of Gu Ning which stunned Brother San and the rest. Zhang XiaoBai even blurted out: “Gu Ning? You know him?”\nThe members of the other team all had strange looks on their faces as well.\nGu Ning nodded, not only did they know one another, but they were also very familiar with each other. This Zhang Ji was a good friend of Lu JiaZi, from high school to college, and had been in the same class while they were even roommates during college. Gu Ning became acquainted with Zhang Ji because of her relationship with Lu JiaZi so her relationship with him could even be described as relatively good. When she cooked for Lu JiaZi, she would often make two portions, one for Lu JiaZi and the other for Zhang Ji. He would sometimes treat Gu Ning out for meals and after graduation, he even took the initiative to introduce jobs to her. Zhang Ji was very good at managing relationships and he was a competent person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt seemed that capable people wouldn’t do too badly even in the post-apocalypse era. Gu Ning thought silently in her mind after observing the team of special abilities users that he was leading.\nZhang Ji smiled at Gu Ning and exclaimed: “Gu Ning, I really didn’t expect to meet you here!” His eyes searched the whole crowd before asking: “Where’s JiaZi? Is he here with you too?”\nCheng Ming and Fang Fa unconsciously frowned at the same time and subconsciously looked at Zhang Ji with some hostility in their gazes.\nBrother San and Jia DaoZhang also looked at each other. They both felt that today’s incident was too coincidental and Gu Ning even knew that man. Moreover, judging from the man’s reaction, it seemed that the two of them were quite familiar with each other. However, what about the suffering of Xiang Yi, Xiang Xu, and Fang Fa? Both of them looked at Gu Ning while waiting for her next course of action.\n“Lu JiaZi is not here.” Gu Ning answered: “But I need you to explain what’s happened here.” After saying this, she glanced over to Zhou Jian who was avoiding and afraid to look at her. At the same time, she noticed Zhou Yan who looked a bit similar to Zhou Jian and her mind quickly formed a few guesses about what had happened just now.\nZhang Ji still replied with a smile on his face: “Zhou Yan finally found her own brother then she saw him being chased and beaten. In the heat of the moment, so that’s why she…..”\nGu Ning glanced at the wreckage on the ground, the corners of her mouth curled up into a smirk: “Looks like she’s a multi-abilities user?”\nZhou Yan sneered: “You asked me for an explanation and I’m waiting for one from you too! Why do you instigate the killing of my brother?!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Killing?” Gu Ning stared at her and replied seriously: “I just asked Xiang Yi to break his hand.”\nZhang Ji saw the chilling smile on Gu Ning’s face and the friendly smile he had, slowly faded as his gaze became astonished by the changes.\nGu Ning continued: “Why don’t you ask Zhou Jian the reason why I want to break his hand.”\nZhou Jian hid behind Zhou Yan and stammered, refusing to answer properly.\nGu Ning stared coldly at Zhou Yan and instructed: “Zhang XiaoBai, come and talk some sense into this young lady.”\nWhen Zhang XiaoBai heard the order, he immediately stepped forward, and sneered while explaining the cause and consequences before finally stating: “Why don’t you ask your precious little brother if any of what I’ve said is false and if he is an ungrateful brat?”\nZhou Yan looked at him angrily, then glanced down at Zhou Jian who was afraid and didn’t dare to rebut any of the claims. Zhou Yan instantly understood that what Zhang XiaoBai said was true. Now even Zhang Ji was ashamed of the truth.\nZhou Yan spoke: “I will double the number of supplies he owes you all.”\nGu Ning shook her head: “Sorry. You probably don’t know that the last thing we are ever going to be lacking is supplies.”\n“I’ll add one more crystal core.” Zhou Yan paused and gritted her teeth: “An evolved crystal core.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning shook her head again: “Do you think we look like we’re short of crystal cores?”\nZhou Yan asked in annoyance: “Then what do you want?”\nGu Ning laughed: “Break his hand.”\nZhou Yan gritted her teeth: “Don’t you bully us too much.”\n“Guo Qiang has also been seriously injured.” The Spiritual ability user interjected. The Speed ability user Guo Qiang had already been carried away back to their cars.\nGu Ning answered: “Xiang Xu is also unconscious. That teammate of yours even bullied a child but his skill is not up to par, doesn’t he deserve it?”\nZhang Ji gave a wink to the youth next to him who dragged Zhou Yan away to the back.\nZhang Ji asked: “Gu Ning, we used to be in such a good term so do me a favour and let him off? Besides, he is still a child, are you able to lay your hands on him?”\nGu Ning looked at him incomparably serious and replied: “Originally, we were here to kill.”\nZhang Ji was speechless and he glanced at the group of people behind Gu Ning with a slight shiver in his heart.\nZhang Ji’s gaze was slightly icy as he looked toward Zhou Yan.\nZhou Yan stared at him incredulously and Zhou Jian hugged her even tightly while shouting in terror: “Sis! Save me!”\nZhou Yan shifted her gaze to Gu Ning and said through clenched teeth: “Name out a condition! As long as you don’t hurt him and I can do it, I will definitely promise you.”\nGu Ning answered: “If I say I am going to break his hand, I WILL break his hand.”\n“What if I do not agree?” Zhou Yan rebutted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“There is no way for you not to agree.” Gu Ning grinned but her gaze abruptly harshen: “Cheng Ming! Do it!”\nCheng Ming had been prepared for this, and almost the moment Gu Ning called out his name, a piercing sound rang out! Zhang Ji’s eyebrows leaped but he didn’t make a move. Soon it was followed by Zhou Jian’s miserable scream and Zhou Yan’s shrieking —— a bloody palm landed on the ground.\nZhou Jian covered his severed hand that kept spurting blood and turned white with fear. He just kept screaming until he suddenly fainted from the pain. The others hurriedly brought the medicine to stop his bleeding while Zhou Yan retreated to the side with a pale face. Her eyes stared deadly at Gu Ning as if she couldn’t wait to kill her immediately.\nZhang Ji’s expression was a little complicated as he stared at Gu Ning for a while before he sighed: “Gu Ning, you’ve changed so much that I could hardly recognize you. I don’t know if JiaZi will still be able to recognise you when he sees you now.”\n“Me and Lu JiaZi no longer have any semblance of a relationship now.” Gu Ning smiled and continued: “We both have wounded teammates who need treatment, so let’s not waste time. Goodbye.”\nAfter saying those, she immediately turned around and left with the team.\nA great battle between two powerful teams of special abilities users began and ended with a severed hand. A duel to the death that was meant to be fought just dissolved into nothingness.\nZhang Ji’s gaze moved away from the severed palm on the ground and glanced at Gu Ning who was walking away in the crowd. The unfamiliarity spread out in his heart as it was really difficult to relate this Gu Ning to the little girl he had remembered that was always smiling and pestering Lu JiaZi.\nOne of the youth took a glance at the onlookers who were standing far away on the other end and asked with some annoyance: “Zhang Ji. We’ve just arrived at this base and we’ve been given such a big slap. How are we able to set a foothold in the base in the future?”\n“Don’t mess with that group of people.” Zhang Ji’s gaze was in deep dread as he watched the group’s distance back. He might have held some regard for Gu Ning’s past relationship with him but this point of affection was absolutely impossible for him to tolerate Gu Ning from publicly shaming them. Moreover, Gu Ning obviously understood this very well but she shamed them anyway. Not in spitefulness but she simply wasn’t afraid of them as she had stated from the start that they were here to kill.\nBy the time the base’s guard team received the news belatedly, the place was nothing but a wretched battlefield.\nInevitably, Zhang Ji and the rest also took up the residence in the dormitory building and were living on a level above Gu Ning and the others.\n“We’re running low on supplies now and we’ll only last until the end of next month at most. Even if we have crystal cores, it will be hard to exchange them for supplies.” The young woman who was their team Spiritual ability user paused for a while as if in an unintentional manner before continuing: “That Gu Ning is a Space ability user……” She and Zhou Yan were very close so the meaning saying this statement could not be even clearer.\n“I said not to mess with them.” Zhang Ji glanced at her coldly: “Also, Gu Ning is still my friend.”\nThe atmosphere in the room went chill.\nZhang Ji continued: “You all don’t need to worry about the supplies, I have my own way.” His fingers tapped on the seat as he was in thought.\nGu Ning didn’t expect Zhang Ji to knock on their door so quickly and he didn’t have any hard feelings over the morning’s incident.\n“I won’t beat around the bush with you either.” Zhang Ji got straight to the point and asked: “You said you aren’t short of supplies. I’m not going to hide it from you that I’m lacking it. So I want to exchange crystal cores for your supplies, is that okay with you?”\nGu Ning froze for a moment, to be honest, if there was one thing she lacked the least that would be the supplies. Yet, she had never thought of exchanging supplies for crystal cores nor had she ever thought that anyone would exchange it for supplies. In fact, when she thought about it, it was not difficult to understand that although crystal cores were useful, they were only used to replenish their energy in times of crisis for those who had already developed their powers. If without any food, they were bound to die of starvation. Furthermore, supplies were the least valuable thing for her. There was indeed the risk of heading out to kill the zombies for the crystal core and sometimes the crystal core would even save their lives when it matters.\nGu Ning thought for a while before replying: “How do we trade?”\nWhen Zhang Ji saw that there was a possibility, he answered: “I’ll quote a number first and if you think it won’t work, we’ll negotiate it.” After he said this, he asked: “How about one crystal core for ten pounds of supplies?”\n“Five pounds.” Gu Ning directly cut it in half.\nZhang Ji chuckled: “You’re lowering the price so much. You know how hard it is to kill evolved zombies now, right?”\nGu Ning blinked: “That’s mate’s rate.”\nZhang Ji continued helplessly: “Alright. Tell me what do you have first?”\nGu Ning asked: “What do you want?”\nZhang Ji replied tentatively: “Bread, sausage, biscuits, and chocolate?”\nGu Ning answered: “Yes we have. So you want to have some of each?”\nZhang Ji agreed with a helpless smile: “You’re now living like that kiosk owner during our schooldays.” He paused and said with a slight grimace: “But at least you are more human-like now.”\nGu Ning’s smile lurched before smiling widely again: “So how much do you want to trade?”\nZhang Ji made a mental calculation before asking tentatively: “Ten crystals?”\nGu Ning deliberately hesitated for a moment to prevent Zhang Ji from suspecting anything fishy about it and replied: “Wait for a while, the supplies aren’t mine alone. I have to go back and discuss it with them.”\nZhang Ji nodded in understanding.\nWhen Gu Ning returned to the living room and told the rest what had happened. The others didn’t think it was possible to make a deal like this, so they all did some calculations and thought it was a good deal. Thus, they had Shi Tou pack up the supplies from the room and brought them out to the door in big sacks.\nAs for Gu Ning, she was very happy to gain ten crystal cores so easily.\nMeanwhile, Zhang Ji was pleased with himself that Gu Ning and the others were completely unaware of the shortage of supplies out there. The highest exchange rate was just three pounds of supplies for each crystal core while very seldom survivors would exchange their supplies for crystal cores.\nGu Ning and the others didn’t know the rate so Zhang Ji took advantage of them for now. Therefore, he took out ten crystal cores in exchange, fearing that next time Gu Ning would learn about the exchange rate and he wouldn’t be able to gain such an advantage. After Zhang Ji brought those stuff back, all his teammates were shocked.\nIn a way, this was really beneficial for both sides in this trade.\nAlthough Gu Ning had deliberately acted a little hesitant, the generous gesture of taking out fifty pounds of supplies all at once still made Zhang Ji hit on the idea of her space.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Dang… Zhou Yan was left alive … bound to have more trouble later on. Hehehe update for Sunday dragged till now as I’m linking it to the next chapter~ Thank you for reading!)\n\n",
    "102": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-102/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt could be said that Zhang Ji had opened the door to a new world for Gu Ning. They hadn’t even realised before that survivors were willing to trade crystal cores for supplies. However, according to Brother San, although they now had as many supplies as a supermarket, eventually it would still be used up. Moreover, they went out to hunt zombies every day, and they weren’t short of crystal cores. Yet for Gu Ning, supplies could be bought as long as they had money but crystal cores were something that they had to risk their lives on to obtain.\nEspecially the evolved crystal cores. They had already discovered that evolved crystal cores would expand the pool of their psychic energy in their bodies to a certain extent when they consumed a second time. This meant that more psychic energy could be stored which was a very big advantage when it came to battle.\n\n\n\nThe crystal core that was dug out from the brain of the tentacle mutated zombie, Gu Ning had given it to Xiang Xu. Xiang Xu’s pool of psychic energy had expanded by nearly a quarter, and it was this quarter of increment that allowed her to resist strong for a minute against more than ten special abilities users’ attacks.\nThe other six mutated crystal cores were divided among the three mutated special abilities users as well as Brother San, Zhong Xu, and Fang Fa. Another few evolved crystal cores were also distributed to the other special abilities users in the team except for herself. The last three evolved crystal cores were reserved by Gu Ning for backup.\nTheir transparent crystal cores for replenishment had accumulated a relatively large number, almost a hundred, after going out to hunt for zombies daily for the past few weeks.\nThe next day near the management office, on the large noticeboard that require payment, half of the noticeboard was taken up by this notice written in a big black marker stating trading supplies for crystal cores. Below, in a slightly finer line reads that one transparent crystal core could be exchanged for five pounds of supplies, and one evolved crystal core could be exchanged for fifty pounds of supplies.\nThis was a rate far above the market price. Gu Ning didn’t just want to obtain the crystal cores but she also hoped to use this opportunity to release a batch of supplies. On the one hand, her Space ability had been exposed and she believed that there were already quite a few people who had been eying on her space. If the Third Company being so strong still couldn’t deter those people, then they must be extremely short of supplies. Since that was the case, why not just offer a very favourable deal to them? If she could just release a large number of supplies, as long as she could solve the urgent needs of those people, they naturally won’t be too heartless to hit the idea on her again.\nSecondly, the other reason was Gu Ning was soft-hearted. She had never been a ruthless person and her cold-bloodedness was only directed at those who were hostile to her. She watched the survivors in the base withering away one by one. Furthermore, those children who should have been alive and carefree, did everything they could to just get a mouthful of food. If things continue like this, in a few more years, there would be lesser and lesser humans alive in this world.\nIt may be difficult for an ordinary survivor to obtain an evolved crystal core but a transparent crystal core might be possible if they were lucky enough to gain one or two of it. Five pounds of supplies could feed a man for half a month if he ate them sparingly. With this half a month of buffer, they could go out and hunt for more crystal cores.\nIt had to be said that supplies had been scavenged once since the early days of the apocalypse. Now it had been more than four months since it happened and unless one ventured into the densely populated areas filled with zombies or in the more remote areas of the surrounding cities, the usual surrounding supplies had almost been fully scavenged. In contrast, the crystal cores were slightly easier to obtain.\nAs soon as this piece of notice was posted, it immediately attracted many survivors who had crystal cores in their hands but lacked supplies.\nBy the afternoon, they had exchanged supplies with the management office for a large shed. Jia DaoZhang brought several soldiers with him and carried bags of supplies from the third floor to the shed. All the soldiers were armed with a gun and Jia DaoZhang being a special ability user stationing at the shed while their base was just on top, no one would be so stupid enough to come forward and rob them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTwo metres away from the shed, a one-metre high earth wall was erected around it by Brother San, leaving only a small door roughly a metre wide for those who need to trade to enter.\nBags of rice, noodles, vermicelli, various kinds of biscuits, and sausages were piled up in the shed. On the other end, it was piled up with various types of winter clothes, quilts, and all kinds of items that were bought by Gu Ning from the other side of the world in the past. Jia DaoZhang and the rest thought it was collected by Gu Ning during their last visit to the supermarket.\nWithin a few minutes, a large crowd had gathered. All were standing outside of the fence and drooling at the piles of rice and various supplies in it.\nSeeing that there were lots of survivors gathered around, Jia DaoZhang cleared his throat and started to introduce the rules of the trade. Not only did they accept the crystal cores but also all kinds of gold, diamond, and other worthy items could be exchanged for supplies. Not many survivors had crystal cores but there were plenty who kept their gold necklaces and rings because they couldn’t bear to lose them.\nAs soon as they heard of the latest instruction, they all turned around and went back to their tents to search for valuable things they could trade. The survivors didn’t even understand what use they would have for gold in this post-apocalyptic world, just like Jia DaoZhang and the rest who were puzzled but still followed and met Gu Ning’s request.\nThe first customer that arrived was a small group of special abilities users living in the same building.\nBoth sides knew each other. An evolved crystal core was exchanged for a bag of rice and several more transparent cores for several winter coats, a couple of quilts, bread, biscuits, and other supplies. All of them hugged their supplies away happily.\nThe only unexpected thing was that quite a few ordinary survivors managed to take out transparent crystal cores. Jia DaoZhang was also soft-hearted toward them, he wouldn’t give a gram more when trading with the other abilities users but if some ordinary survivors came to trade, he would secretly give an extra bread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMany children were lying on the fence, staring at the piles of supplies. The children were all starving, and although Jia DaoZhang felt a little bad in his heart, he knew that if he was to give one of them some food, there would be another asking for it and that’s not the way of doing good deeds.\nPreviously, Brother San had proposed to set up a porridge shed specifically for the children and elderly in the base which was firmly rejected by Hong Jie. Apart from a few enthusiastic soldiers, everyone else was against the idea. There were now over 100,000 survivors in the base, the elderly and children added up to several thousand. Therefore if they were to set up a porridge shed, it might eventually lead to a disaster.\nZhang Ji didn’t expect Gu Ning to come up with such an idea. At the same time, he had also vaguely guessed Gu Ning’s intention but he just didn’t know whether that was her idea or her team members.\nThe two times he had come in contact with Gu Ning in the post-apocalyptic world, Zhang Ji was keenly aware of Gu Ning who seemed to be the core figure in that team. Generally speaking, a Space ability user in the team was usually just a mobile warehouse, not to mention that Gu Ning was a girl…… Thinking about the fact that most of the team members he saw that day were mostly men, Zhang Ji inevitably had some other thoughts. Coupled with Gu Ning’s words that she no longer had any relationship with Lu JiaZi, and her drastic change in temperament, both made Zhang Ji even more certain of what he thought.\nAfter all, such a way was very common in the post-apocalyptic world.\nThe main point was if he could win Gu Ning over? Previously, he had very strong thoughts about obtaining Gu Ning’s space. Yet, after all, the both of them knew each other so he couldn’t bear to kill Gu Ning outright to take the stuff from her space. It was also like killing a chicken to get an egg. However, right now, Zhang Ji suddenly found it possible to just take the chicken over.\nThe exact method would still need longer planning.\nZhang Ji was deep in thought.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Shooo shoo get lost Zhang Ji, don’t dirty our Gu Ning like this.

And Gu Ning, these are yours.” Jia DaoZhang said as he pushed all the gold rings, necklaces, and all kinds of jewellery that were piled up on the table to Gu Ning.\n\n\n\nGu Ning just kept everything back into the space when there was a knock on the door.\nEveryone in the room glanced at each other strangely as how could someone be knocking on the door at this time of the day?\nAs soon as Luo Long opened the door, he then turned his head to Gu Ning and told her: “Gu Ning, it’s for you.” He passed a look to Cheng Ming before pulling the door open, directly exposing Zhang Ji who was standing in the doorway.\nZhang Ji said to Gu Ning: “Gu Ning, come out. I have something to talk to you about.”\nJia DaoZhang glanced at Cheng Ming and Fang Fa before asking: “It’s late now, is there something that you can’t talk about during the day?”\nZhang Ji looked at Gu Ning with a smile and asked: “You wouldn’t deny me of such a request after all the years we’ve known each other, would you?”\n“I’m going out for a while, I’ll be back soon.” Gu Ning told Brother San and the others before walking out with Zhang Ji.\nAt Zhang Ji’s request, the two of them went downstairs and strolled through the night. Only the management office was lit up in the whole base but everywhere else was lit by a torch every ten meters or so with burning fireballs. By this time, there was basically no one walking on the street, only occasionally survivors returning to the base.\nIt was quite a long walk when Zhang Ji suddenly asked: “Remember the last time we walked like this at night?”\nThe last time she and Zhang Ji took a stroll together like this was when she graduated from college and Zhang Ji invited her and Lu JiaZi to dinner. Halfway through the meal, Lu JiaZi had to leave first so Zhang Ji sent Gu Ning home and took a walk like this. She didn’t expect to meet him again and when Zhang Ji reminded her, Gu Ning felt a little bit nostalgic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang Ji then asked, “You and JiaZi haven’t met each other since the apocalypse happened?”\nGu Ning was silent for a moment before answering: “No.”\n“I thought I recognized the wrong person when I saw you yesterday. You’ve changed a lot.” Zhang Ji suddenly stopped in his tracks then looked at Gu Ning and said softly: “You must have suffered a lot.”\nGu Ning was keenly aware that Zhang Ji’s tone was a little strange when he said this but she didn’t think too much about it. When she was about to reply, Zhang Ji suddenly leaned down slightly and placed his hands on her shoulders: “Come over to me.” He said: “I will take care of you.”\nGu Ning froze for a moment, then abruptly smiled as she asked: “Are you saying such a thing for the sake of our past friendship, or are you aiming at my space ability?”\nZhang Ji didn’t expect Gu Ning to ask him that rhetorically, he was stunned for a while before smiling and answering frankly to her: “Both.” He sat down on the edge of the flower bed by the roadside then patted the space next to him to indicate Gu Ning to sit as he continued: “But without our past friendship, then I would probably be more inclined to just kill you now.”\nGu Ning spoke as she implied: “That Zhou Yan in your team would want to kill me more than you do.”\nZhang Ji picked up a cigarette, lit it with a lighter, and took a puff before replying slowly: “As long as you come to my side, I will naturally protect you. I’ll even sacrifice her to protect you if necessary.” After saying this, he smiled faintly and stared at Gu Ning: “You know, compared to the past, I prefer the life now. It’s easier.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning was unmoved then raised her hand to look at her watch and stated: “I’m going back.”\nThis was a rejection.\nZhang Ji stood up and asked an incredibly abrupt question: “You’ve fallen for someone else?”\nApart from this reason, he couldn’t think of any other reason for Gu Ning to reject him. The three distinguished faces of Fang Fa, Cheng Ming, and Zhang XiaoBai quickly flashed through his mind. Thinking of that, he looked at Gu Ning with a hint of pity in his gaze and a hint of disdain that even he didn’t realized.\nAfter Gu Ning went back up to the floor and recalled the look Zhang Ji had just given her, she suddenly realized that Zhang Ji had misunderstood and was a little annoyed. Just when she was about to turn around and went downstairs to explain to Zhang Ji, on the second thought, she didn’t think that was necessary. Thus, she ignored him and headed back.\nWhen she returned, it was clear that the rest were all ‘curious’ about what Zhang Ji had chatted with her. Yet, after all, it was Gu Ning’s business and they didn’t feel too comfortable prying it. Gu Ning was considerate enough to explain: “That’s one of the seniors from my school. It’s been so long since I’ve last met him so we had chatted for a while.”\nIn the evening Gu Ning returned to the other side of the world through the space.\nIt was early in the morning so she changed her clothes and opened the door as she walked out for her regular exercises. After half an hour of her morning run, the others were already having their breakfast. Yi ShaoQing walked down the stairs with his coffee and messy hair. He stared at Gu Ning with his sleepy eyes and asked for advice seriously: “Gu Ning, can you tell me how you managed to survive after being abused half to death by Ji JiuZe yesterday and still seem so energetic now?”\nGu Ning thought for a moment before replying seriously: “Because there was no training yesterday.” After stating this, she sat down opposite Ji JiuZe and started having her breakfast.\nIt was obvious to her during the training that Ji JiuZe was more lenient and the overwhelming feeling was lessened. She could now split some of her energy to observe his combat skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter three hours of training followed by a half-hour break.\nGu Ning sat against the wall and gulped the water down her throat without any image. Even though Ji JiuZe sweats more than her, he still drank his water so slowly and unhurriedly. It was as if there was nothing in this world that could make him do things in a hurry.\nGu Ning suddenly wondered what he would be like when he was in the post-apocalyptic world. Then her thoughts shifted to that she had met Yin Sang and Zhuang Chen in the post-apocalyptic world but not him nor Yi ShaoQing…… Gu Ning shook her head as she recalled Ji JiuZe’s terrifying combat skills, even if he hadn’t evolved his powers, there was no need to worry about him being eaten by zombies.\n“What’s wrong?” Ji JiuZe suddenly placed down the water, looked at Gu Ning, and asked.\n“Hmm?” Gu Ning didn’t understand: “What?”\nJi JiuZe stared at her and explained: “You were shaking your head just now.”\nGu Ning didn’t expect to be noticed by Ji JiuZe and was slightly flustered: “Uh. It’s nothing.”\nJi JiuZe, however, remembered what Yi ShaoQing had told him the previous day and looked at the flash of panic on Gu Ning’s face. He believed Yi ShaoQing’s statement even more and asked again: “Do you have any problems with my training methods?”\nHe was serious when asking Gu Ning’s opinion but his expression was just too solemn, causing Gu Ning to misinterpret it and thought that he was reprimanding her for being unhappy with him. She immediately shook her head and denied: “No, no.” The expression on her face was a hundred percent sincere.\nJi JiuZe stared at Gu Ning for a solid minute before asking: “Have you rested enough?”\nGu Ning hurriedly got up from the ground: “Enough, enough.”\nAfter Ji JiuZe adjusted his training method in time, Gu Ning once again showed her amazing skill of movement replication. Her combat skills once again leaped by bounds.\nMoreover, it was not easy to make Ji JiuZe feel contented.\nThree days later, Gu Ning received her first assignment after entering the Five Stars Brigade.\nPrior to that, she had signed a confidentiality agreement of at least twenty pages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThen she got in Ji JiuZe’s car at noon, with no idea where she was going or what she was going to do. No matter who she asked like Zhuang Chen or Yi ShaoQing, it’s all the same reply that she would know when the time comes.\nJi JiuZe was wearing a tailor-made black suit, none of which was uneven, making him look even sharper. Accompanying with a white shirt and a black tie, he looks like a complete business elite.\nGu Ning even had the illusion that Ji JiuZe was the boss, she was his secretary, and now she was following him to a very important business deal.\nAfter getting into the car, Ji JiuZe threw over a file and stated briefly: “This is the target of this mission.”\nGu Ning apprehensively took the information out of the file and found that it was a topographical map, a spatial structure of a villa to be exact. It included the exterior pool, the location of every walkway and every room was clearly drawn. The room in the very centre was circled in red.\nJi JiuZe continued speaking as he started the car: “You have half an hour to get this map engraved in your mind.”\nGu Ning kept quiet and just focused on the map seriously. Starting from where she was going to enter and two minutes later, she closed her eyes and the structure of the map appeared clearly in her mind. She placed the map into the file and asked Ji JiuZe: “What do I need to do later?”\nJi JiuZe glanced at the file in her hand with some approval, then answered: “Twenty minutes after I’ve gone in, you need to find your own way to enter this villa and get into that marked room to find a document. It is the seventh book in the top third compartment from the right of the bookshelf. You have ten minutes to retrieve the document out.”\nWith those words, he pulled the car over to the side.\nThen he stretched his watch-worn hand out in front of Gu Ning: “Time match.”\nAfter matching the time, Ji JiuZe reached into the back seat and lifted a sliver case before pushing the door open and alighted. He then leaned down slightly to look at Gu Ning who was slightly nervous in the car and said: “Be careful.”\nGu Ning nodded solemnly.\nAfterward, Ji JiuZe disappeared into the night with his suitcase.\nGu Ning hurriedly got out of the car and stuck close to the fence next to her, then carefully sneaked to the front and poked her head out to check.\nShe saw Ji JiuZe walk straight to the entrance of the villa and then he was stopped right in front of the main door. His back was facing Gu Ning and then he spread open his arms.\nTwo young men came forward and searched Ji JiuZe thoroughly before leading him in.\nGu Ning took the opportunity to count the guards at the entrance alone. There were five to six of them, on the other side, there were a few with torches patrolling around the villa. She looked down at her watch, there were still seventeen minutes left, she had to figure out how to avoid all these guards and get into the villa quickly.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Another 2 chapters will be uploaded tmr or on Tuesday. Hohoho, Gu Ning’s first ever mission! Muahahaha! Thank you all for reading~)\n\n",
    "104": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-104/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHiding her form in the dark was what Gu Ning was best at. Even a cat might not have lighter steps than hers. She moved quickly through the darkness, illuminated by the streetlights within ten metres of the villa. Gu Ning moved quickly and shield herself behind a begonia tree.\nThe moment the flashes from the torchlight swung past the tree where she was hiding, Gu Ning instantly bowed and dashed toward the wall with her back pressed against it. In order not to make any noise, Gu Ning took off her shoes and kicked them into the grass. She glanced around to make sure no one was near her and then with a light step, vines broke out from the grass on the other side of the fence while spreading up along the fence rapidly and then over it.\n\n\n\nGu Ning tugged on one end and wrapped it around her hand a few times before she climbed up quickly. In a blink of an eye, she climbed up the fence, flipped herself over, and landed on the grass softly with one hand. Gu Ning instantly shifted like a black shadow and ran in a single direction without the slightest hesitation.\nAs she ran, the structural map of the villa appeared clearly in her mind.\nGu Ning dodged the patrolling guards and went around to the back of the villa where there was a large swimming pool. Above the pool was a huge open balcony that connected to the second floor. Gu Ning was now about to enter the villa through the balcony. However, two men were standing on the balcony chatting.\nFortunately, the greenery around the villa was very well maintained. Gu Ning hid behind an unknown bush and glanced down at her watch. Thirteen minutes had passed since Ji JiuZe had stated the twenty minutes buffer time. Thus, there were still seven minutes left for her to try and enter the villa.\nShe nestled behind a bush and waited patiently for the two men on the balcony to finish their conversation and walk away as soon as possible.\nYet the two men seemed to be having a great time chatting with each other, and as the time passed, her seven minutes buffer time had gone in the blink of an eye while the two men still had no intention of leaving. When the buffer time passed, Gu Ning became anxious, staring deadly at the two figures on the balcony. Another three minutes passed, and it was only when Gu Ning was about to leave to find another way then the two men left.\nGu Ning didn’t waste any more time and ran quickly to the bottom of the balcony. There was a coconut three about a metre away from the balcony, so she quickly climbed up the tree on her hands and knees. After climbing up, she listened to the surroundings to make sure no one was near the balcony before leaping down from the tree and carefully jumping onto the balcony.\nBy this time, four minutes had passed since Ji JiuZe had set the time limit for her. There was not much time left so she once again carefully recalled the map in her mind, double-checked the direction, and started darting across the cold marble floor with her bare feet.\nGu Ning ran against the wall, avoiding the patrolling and weaving through the corridors. Her pores were all open, feeling everything around her and her nerves tensed while her ears perked up so that she could capture any movement around her.\nAt the same time as she heard sounds coming from the left corridor, Gu Ning’s body, which had been charging forward lurched and then bounced backward like a spring before quickly retreating to the corridor she had come from. She was slightly relieved to find that the two sets of footsteps had gone the other way and was about to move on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Who is it?!” Suddenly a hand was placed on her shoulder and simultaneously pressed down hard to wrench her shoulder backward! Gu Ning was shocked but her expression remained calm. Without waiting for the man to say anything else, her body suddenly darted downward and broke away from the man’s grip. Her reflex and speed had shocked everyone in the Five Stars Brigade except Ji JiuZe and this time, Gu Ning had exploded to her greatest advantage! With dizzying speed, she went around behind the tall man and used her hand as a knife to hit the spot where Ji JiuZe had told her it was the easiest place to cause a person to faint!\nThe man didn’t expect Gu Ning to be this fast! He had obviously grabbed her but he didn’t expect her to slip out of his grasp in the blink of an eye like a slippery loach. Then he felt a sharp pain at the back of his neck as his vision went black and his body plunged to the ground!\nGu Ning reached out to catch the man a second before he fell to the floor, then unlocked the door to the room next to them, and dragged the man inside before stuffing him under the bed. Gu Ning darted out the door and continued to approach quickly in the direction of her target.\nCarefully unlocking the door, she rushed in. The room was dark but this did not affect Gu Ning’s vision. She quickly glanced around the very spacious room and found the bookshelf that Ji JiuZe said was almost as big as a whole wall. The floor was covered with a wonderfully fluffy carpet and she made her way to the bookshelf which the top rightmost shelf was almost reaching the ceiling! Gu Ning soon saw a small ladder placed on the other side and she immediately move it over, climbed up, grab the seventh book from the right at the top.\nAs her hand had only just touched the bookshelf when all of a sudden! There was a click —— the closed door was being opened! Someone was coming!\nWith a “snap”, someone had switched on the lights and the room lit up!\nMeanwhile, Gu Ning had rolled under the desk in front of the bookshelf, holding her breath as the book had passed through her hands into the space. She raised her hand to glance at her watch before cursing that thirteen minutes had passed. She was delayed by tucking the man under the bed and was irritated. Then she saw a pair of feet in shiny black leather shoes appear in front of her as the man actually walked over to the desk and sat down.\nGu Ning was even more afraid to move and her breathing became very faint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis was not the post-apocalyptic world where she could enter the space rashly. If she was discovered when she came out of the space, then there would be endless consequences.\nWhere could Ji JiuZe be at this hour? Was he gone already?\n“Bang!” a loud sound rang out!\nBefore Gu Ning could react, the table above her head was lifted off the ground!\nGu Ning instantly responded as soon as the light hit her blonde hair and she bounded up from the floor and was going to restrain the man! However, the moment she stood up, she was shocked when she saw that person’s face. With that arrogant short silver hair was none other than Bai Lang?! The shock was only momentary, Gu Ning’s hand had already swung toward Bai Lang!\nBai Lang seemed to be stunned for a moment at the sight of Gu Ning then quickly reacted by stomping his long legs on the floor and his whole body along with the office chair flew backward. At the same time, raised his legs to block away Gu Ning’s attacking hand again.\nGu Ning’s two attacks failed and she was a little panicking. It was mainly because she was worried that the commotion here would draw in all those guards patrolling outside. She had no desire to fight with Bai Lang and after throwing a false attack, she darted in the direction of the door!\n“Want to leave?” Bai Lang caught up with Gu Ning in three to five steps and reached out for her shoulder! Gu Ning caught a glimpse of him and reached out to switch off the light in the room. The room was instantly plunged into darkness again, followed by a bend and shifted behind Bai Lang. Gu Ning wanted to use the same trick again by knocking Bai Lang unconscious, but who knew that she was fast yet Bai Lang was even faster! With a spin, he blocked Gu Ning’s hand slash with a single swing! Then he persistently reached out to grab hold of her! Gu Ning sidestepped and her elbow slammed into Bai Lang’s armpit!\nBai Lang was also slightly startled by her quick reflex and at the same time took half a step back! His eyes shone out vicious gaze and instead of trying to grab hold of Gu Ning, he started attacking her directly!\nGu Ning immediately felt the pressure increase as she struggled to block Bai Lang’s storm of attacks while secretly panicking. Although they had met each other several times in the post-apocalyptic world, they had never fought against each other so she didn’t know that his fighting skills were almost as good as Ji JiuZe!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShe couldn’t beat Ji JiuZe so certainly not even Bai Lang. However, thanks to her daily diligent practice, she actually managed to block away dozens of his moves! Moreover, she also noticed that darkness had very little effect on him.\nFinally, Bai Lang found her loophole and clipped her hands behind her while slamming Gu Ning’s entire body directly into the wall! Just when Gu Ning thought she was going to be slammed hard into the wall when Bai Lang suddenly withdrew some of his strength. She felt soreness from the slam but it was not too serious yet she was still pinned to the wall by Bai Lang in dead weight.\nShe raised her leg to kick! Only to be knocked back by his and her knee knocked painfully into the wall.\nBai Lang abruptly pressed his body over, one hand was still holding onto Gu Ning’s hands in a deadly grip while pinning her hard against the wall and another hand came around to cover her mouth.\nGu Ning suddenly had an extremely strange feeling and even more so, an inexplicable sense of familiarity with her current situation ——\nThe feeling had only surfaced when she heard Bai Lang say with some triumph and incredulity: “It was you!”\nIt was her? Where did that come from?\nGu Ning suddenly had a flash of thought run through her mind, remembering the dark alley where she had been inexplicably “hijacked” and used by someone as a cover. Could it be that the person that day was Bai Lang? Gu Ning was in a state of disbelief.\nOut of nowhere! “Bang!” There was a loud crash! The door next to her, which was closed had been violently and viciously kicked open!\nGu Ning and Bai Lang were both startled and looked sideways at the same time to see Ji JiuZe dressed in a suit, walking in through the doorway, followed by five or six men who seemed to be overwhelmed by his aura and didn’t dare to come forward to stop him.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: I’m seriously sorry for the delay again. So many things to do and so little time. Yup my free time is now based on Nero. XD Oh well~ Anyway, thank you all for reading. My chapters owing continued to pile up … T-T)\n\n",
    "105": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-105/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBai Lang and Gu Ning who were very close to the door were almost crushed by the door that was kicked open instantly! Bai Lang reacted quickly, holding Gu Ning and spinning around against the wall to avoid the impact of the door. However, because of spinning around, Gu Ning was now facing Bai Lang. When Ji JiuZe looked over, it seem like Gu Ning was being held in the arms of Bai Lang.\nSix eyes met and for some reason, Bai Lang felt a flash of murderous intent in Ji JiuZe’s gaze.\n\n\n\nGu Ning, however, took advantage of Bai Lang’s unpreparedness and lifted her foot to kick him hard on his knee. Then she hurriedly ran over to Ji JiuZe’s side when Bai Lang was holding his legs and yelled in pain.\nGu Ning didn’t hold back her strength in the slightest with that kick and Bai Lang kept rubbing his knee while hissing at Ji JiuZe: “Ji JiuZe, don’t tell me she’s the rookie you’ve recruited this time!”\nTen minutes later.\nGu Ning had an expression of being refreshed in her worldview: “So he’s in alliance with the Five Stars Brigade?”\nJi JiuZe stressed; “It’s just a partnership.”\nBai Lang suddenly lifted his right leg, which had been kicked by Gu Ning, and placed them heavily on the glass table in front of him. The heel of his leather shoe made a clanging sound against the glass table and he pulled up his trouser to the top of his knee. It was obviously bruised and his eyes were fixed on Gu Ning with his face full of frost.\nGu Ning looked at it and was a bit guilty. Just now she was in a hurry to get away and used all her strength so now she was slightly embarrassed.\nJi JiuZe glanced at it before saying it slowly: “Provide an examination report and someone will handle the compensation.”\nBai Lang replied with a sneer as he rolled down his trouser: “Ji JiuZe. Even though we are in a partnership. It’s not very nice of you to send your Five Stars Brigade rookie to my place for training, isn’t it? I’ve even wondered why you suddenly dropped by to see me for no reason.”\nJi JiuZe replied calmly: “This is Zhuang Chen’s suggestion. If there are any problems, you can go and deal with her.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBai Lang’s expression immediately became speechless as if he had eaten a fly.\nOnly then did Gu Ning remember that Bai Lang and Zhuang Chen had a slightly complicated friendship, also she followed Bai Lang without hesitation in the post-apocalyptic world. However, this place, no matter was it the geographical location or Bai Lang’s well-trained guards, was just perfect for training newbies.\nJi JiuZe stood up after finishing his sentences: “I’m sorry to bother you today. I’ll get Zhuang Chen to call you for the cost of repairing the door. I’ll come back to chat with you next time if there are chances.” Then he glanced at Gu Ning, who hurried followed suit and stood up.\nBai Lang instead aimed his question at Gu Ning: “Little golden retriever, what’s your name?”\nGu Ning froze for a moment before realizing that he was calling her a golden retriever? ? ? Gu Ning was speechless.\nJi JiuZe glanced at Gu Ning before interrupting: “There’s no need for you to know her name, and you won’t have many chances to meet her in the future.”\nBai Lang placed his other leg on the glass table as well and stared at Ji JiuZe with a smirk: “That’s not necessarily true. Maybe we’ll even meet tomorrow too.” As he paused, his gaze fixed on Gu Ning’s face and continued suggestively: “Besides, I haven’t had a chance to thank you for what happened last time.”\nNaturally, he was talking about the previous time when she was held hostage by him as a cover, and she still didn’t know how he had recognised her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJi JiuZe glanced sideways at Gu Ning before stating: “Let’s go.”\n“Little golden retriever, wait up.” Bai Lang suddenly called out and stopped Gu Ning.\nAs soon as Gu Ning turned around, she saw Bai Lang stretch out a finger and point to the top of the bookshelf then smiled at her: “Return the book.”\n“I didn’t take it.” Gu Ning spread her arms widely: “You can get someone to search me.”\nGu Ning look so frankly that it didn’t seem like she was lying.\nHowever, Bai Lang really called the maid in the villa over to search for Gu Ning, and of course, the result was Gu Ning didn’t have it.\nGu Ning asked: “I can go now, right?”\nAlthough Bai Lang still had some doubts in his mind, he couldn’t force her to stay and just ordered impatiently to the man guarding the door: “Send both of them out.”\n“Oh. By the way.” Gu Ning suddenly said: “There’s a person tucked under the bed in the room past this corridor to the right, and then another right of the walkway.”\nBai Lang: ……\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBoth of them walked back to their car under the gaze of the Bai Lang’s group of minions.\nOn the way, Ji JiuZe didn’t even talk to Gu Ning, and with her current personality, she had also developed the habit of keeping quiet. Thus, the whole trip back to the Five Stars Brigade was silent.\n“You guys are back!” Zhuang Chen and Yi ShaoQing were waiting for them in the living room.\nZhuang Chen’s eyes lit up: “Where is the book? Have you brought them back yet?!”\nGu Ning froze for a moment, a book?! The book was still in her space!\nShe was about to make an excuse that she had left it in the car and went back to get it when Ji JiuZe suddenly pulled out a book from somewhere and placed it on the table. He then looked at Gu Ning and stated: “You left it in the car.” After stating it, he loosens his tie as he walked up the stairs. Yi ShaoQing glanced sideways at Ji JiuZe who was heading upstairs, then his gaze fell on the book on the table before he finally looked at Gu Ning with a somewhat subtle expression on his face.\nZhuang Chen exclaimed excitedly: “Gu Ning, you’re amazing! Congratulations! From today onward, you are officially a member of the First Squad of the Five Stars Brigade!”\nGu Ning had not yet reacted to Ji JiuZe’s actions and this time, she was baffled by Zhuang Chen’s words. She suddenly looked around and found no sign of the other three people and a sense of uncertainty rose in her heart as she asked: “Where are Zhang XiaoBai and the others?”\nYi ShaoQing replied with a matter-of-fact expression: “Eliminated.”\nGu Ning froze: “What?”\nZhuang Chen explained: “It’s not a direct elimination back to the unit. It’s just an elimination from the First Squad to the Second Squad, er, or possibly the Third or Fourth Squad but they should be able to stay in the second with their strength. Don’t look at me like that, if you hadn’t brought back the book tonight, you might have been assigned to the Second Squad by Ji JiuZe as well. Luckily, you did a great job and didn’t make him send away his first disciple personally to the Second Squad.”\nGu Ning laughed dryly as she thought back about Ji JiuZe’s action just now, he was really afraid that he would be disgraced by her. She felt a little awkward and couldn’t care too much about feeling sorry for Zhang XiaoBai and the others.  It was because of the post-apocalyptic world that she was closer to Zhang XiaoBai, and Zhong Xu than Zhuang Chen and Yi ShaoQing. However, now that the three of them had been separated, Gu Ning suddenly felt a little empty.\nZhuang Chen then continued: “Since you have now become an official member of the Five Stars Brigade, it’s time to tell you exactly what our Five Stars Brigade does.”\nGu Ning was then taken to the study room on the second floor.\nJi JiuZe had already changed into casual clothes and was sitting in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“The Five Stars Brigade is an organisation filled with hundreds of elites. There are more than ten squads within the organisation and the First Squad, which is the one you are in now, is the top-notch of the pyramid among the rest. All are unified under the Five Stars Brigade and the headquarters are in the capital. There is competition within the organisation between the squads, depending on the difficulty and completion of the mission as a vetting criterion, an annual shuffle is made. Of course, no matter how the shuffle goes, our squad has been standing steadily at the tip of the pyramid for over a decade and has never gone below it. Even if the Second Squad has twice the number of members than us and tried to jump up, they still can’t reach the bottom of our shoes.” Zhuang Chen boosted without any complacency.\nGu Ning caught the gist of Zhuang Chen’s explanation: “Mission?”\n“Yes. Like tonight’s mission where you are supposed to bring back a book from Bai Lang.” Zhuang Chen stated lightly after picking up an apple and taking a bite: “It also includes investigating criminal cases that are too difficult for the local police to solve, such as last year’s highly publicized serial killer case which was caught by the Second Squad. As well as going to the border to catch any of those cross-border drug dealers, destroying their lairs on the way, stealing confidential information from foreign countries or whatsoever.”\n? ? ? How could all these tasks be comparable with what happened tonight? ? ?\nYi ShaoQing gloated by the side: “Gu Ning, are you alright? You seem a little pale, eh?”\nGu Ning couldn’t even muster up a forced smile and silently grabbed a glass of water to drink while sitting on the sofa.\n“Gu Ning, don’t be afraid. I’m just giving you an example.” Zhuang Chen comforted her before continuing to explain: “Do you know what the top of the pyramid means? It means that we can enjoy the best treatment in the brigade, earn the most money, live in the best house, drive the best car and also have maximum freedom. That said, we have a choice to choose the missions. The points for completing an S-rank mission are ten times that of an A-rank mission, and now we have more than ten times the points of the Second Squad, so you can be completely at ease. Even if we didn’t take upon any mission for the next three years, we would still be standing at the top of the pyramid steadily.”\n“Umm……” Gu Ning calmed down a little before asking: “What does an S-rank mission look like?”\nZhuang Chen hesitated for a moment: “Uh……”\n“You know that xz riot leader who died of illness last year?” Yi ShaoQing grinned: “I was his attending doctor last year.”\nGu Ning picked up the cup again and started drinking. She finally knew what Yi ShaoQing was researching in the lab every day.\n“Gu Ning, do you know why we’re called the Five Stars Brigade?” Zhuang Chen suddenly became serious.\nGu Ning tentatively replied: “Is it something to do with the flag?”\n“Right. The Five Stars Brigade’s team logo was created based on the flag.” For the first time, Zhuang Chen showed a solemn look in front of Gu Ning: “Gu Ning, will you become a member of the First Squad of the Five Stars Brigade and inherit the spirit of defending to the death for the soil beneath our feet and the country that stands on this land!” Gu Ning stared at Zhuang Chen, whose expression was solemn but her gaze showed eagerness. Gu Ning was stunned and felt slightly mixed emotions.\nShe thought of the country in the post-apocalyptic world that had suffered so much in disaster, and the land beneath her feet had begun to change……\nBoth Zhuang Chen and Yi ShaoQing had hesitated on the day they had formally joined the team a long time ago. Even Bai Lang back then had chosen to give up at this one point, so they weren’t in a hurry and just watched Gu Ning quietly, waiting for her answer.\nGu Ning looked like she had made an incredibly big decision and it was indeed an incomparably important decision. She raised her eyes, her gaze skimmed over Zhuang Chen, Yi ShaoQing’s face, and finally met Ji JiuZe’s eyes. His eyes were still as calm as ever, he didn’t push or urge her and just quietly waited for Gu Ning’s answer like the other two.\nGu Ning finally strengthened her conviction as she took a deep breath before replying: “I am willing.” As she said those words, Gu Ning instantly felt relief in her heart as well as the responsibility placed on her shoulders.\nZhuang Chen made a much-exaggerated expression of relief and came over to give Gu Ning a firm hug while Yi ShaoQing also cracked a smile.\nThe tense atmosphere loosened up at once.\nJi JiuZe, on the other hand, stood up from his chair and walked toward Gu Ning. He stopped in front of her, lowered his head, took off the five-star badge on his chest, and carefully pinned it on her chest which was two inches below her shoulder. Then he took a step back, raised his right hand, and gave a formal military salute to Gu Ning.\nZhuang Chen and Yi ShaoQing also stood up straight at the same time, smiling and saluting at Gu Ning.\nGu Ning glanced at the badge on her chest and wordlessly straightened her back before solemnly returning the three of them with a less-than-standard salute.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: All Gu Ning wanted was to learn better combat skills and now she was roped into these. hahahaha. Just like spiderman quote: “with great power comes great responsibility”. Thank you all for reading! Love ya!)\n\n",

She felt a little complicated right now.\nIn fact, the moment Zhuang Chen asked her to take the oath, she really had the thought of rejecting it just now. However, with three pairs of eyes staring at her, especially Ji JiuZe, who seem very calm but somehow gave her a feeling that if she chose to reject, she wouldn’t be able to get out of the door alive.\n\n\n\nIt would be good if Gu Ning was a person of light promises, but the point was that she was a person who never made promises easily. Thus, once she made a promise, she would keep hold of it.\nWhat if she really had to do some cross-border mission of catching some big drug dealer?\nGu Ning rolled back and forth on the bed a few times. She wailed out in frustration before lying flat on her back completely motionless.\nAt eight o’clock in the evening, Zhuang Chen came to Gu Ning with a laptop.\nZhuang Chen smiled and explained: “I’d forgotten to brief you about the benefits of our Five Stars Brigade when you took the oath just now.”\nGu Ning was instantly energised and sat cross-legged on the bed to listen to Zhuang Chen’s briefing.\nThe fixed base salary of the First Squad of the Five Stars Brigade was eight thousand.\nHowever, completing an S-rank mission was a minimum pay of tens of million.\n“Each mission.” Zhuang Chen emphasized: “The number of people needed for a single S-rank mission has to be submitted to the headquarters for approval. Of course, how much you can receive depend on whether you are the front-end staff or the back-end support. I only received two million from that S-rank mission which Yi ShaoQing had accepted last year.”\nThe reward for an A-rank mission was five million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe reward for a B-rank mission was a million.\nC-rank mission would only be half a million.\nThe lowest was a C-rank mission, anything lower than that had no point in alerting the Five Stars Brigade.\nZhuang Chen continued: “Last year, our team took a total of three missions. Two S-rank and one A-rank. Ji JiuZe and Yi ShaoQing, each had one S-rank mission while I took on the A-rank mission alone. Yin Sang couldn’t handle the A-rank mission but didn’t want to take up the B-rank mission so her record last year was a zero.” Zhuang Chen stared at Gu Ning for a while before suggesting: “You can take up some private mission to do first if you want.”\nGu Ning asked: “What is a private mission?”\n“The Five Stars Brigade is a part of a mercenary-like organization that specializes in taking up some mission from the public. By the way, that Celadon Sunflower Wash antique you had last time, its twin which was auctioned off in 2012, the buyer had the Second Squad to escort it for five million. The private mission is considered lower risk and higher return than the public mission. However, private missions can’t accumulate points and they are simply used to earn money. Moreover, you have to pay for all the equipment for the private mission yourself or of course, you can let the issuer pay for it. The headquarter will not cover any of the cost and a 10% fee will be taken.”\nWhile she spoke, her eyes were fixed on the laptop in her hand, tapping in a long list of web addresses. The page she opened had a very simple layout without any fanciful icons.\n“See here, red means the missions are available for pick up. Black means the missions that have already been picked up.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning took a serious look at the list of red missions which had at least hundreds of entries.\nZhuang Chen continued: “When there is no mission, you have all the freedom to spend your time however you want. If lack of money……” Zhuang Chen paused for a moment, remembering Gu Ning’s celadon sunflower wash, and then said: “You aren’t short of money either. Then use this as training your skills by picking up some private missions. But it seems that you won’t have much free time this while as Ji JiuZe surely has other arrangements for you.” She looked at Gu Ning without any sympathy and stated: “After all, you are his first disciple, and definitely the one and only. According to his character, he will definitely be strict with you so do prepare yourself mentally.”\nGu Ning’s mind was full of money money money. Although the celadon sunflower wash was worth a lot, she was not in a hurry to sell it now. As she thought along the line of getting paid so much for completing a mission, Gu Ning couldn’t help but wanted to burst out laughing in joy. Meanwhile, she secretly slanders Zhuang Chen and the rest in her mind, who were so scheming by deliberately not telling her about the planned arrangement and even pretending that they had forgotten what it was. Yet, everyone knew what was going on and just didn’t bring it to the surface.\nShe didn’t really take what Zhuang Chen had said to heart.\nAs a result, the next day, after breakfast, when Ji JiuZe came down the stairs in his very eye-catching long autumn grey long coat, Gu Ning took the initiative to ask: “Captain, are you heading out?” She would be free if he went away! After reaching a certain level of close combat skill, Gu Ning naturally developed a burnout mentality.\nJi JiuZe gave a nod, then stared at the soy milk in her hand and asked: “Have you finished eating?”\nGu Ning replied: “I’m done eating.”\n“Then let’s go.”\n“Eh? ? ?”\nTherefore, half an hour later, Gu Ning followed and got on the high-speed train to Pingze City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Where are we going, Captain?”\n“Pingze.”\n“…… I don’t have anything with me, and I didn’t even bring any money.”\n“I have.”\n“…… Going there to do what?”\n“Fighting.”\n“? ? ?”\nJi JiuZe didn’t give Gu Ning much chance to ask questions as after he had adjusted his seat, he actually took out two blindfolds from the pockets of his long coat. He passed one to Gu Ning and then immediately wore his blindfold and started to sleep.\nGu Ning took the blindfold and stared at Ji JiuZe who was already resting with the blindfold on. She was slightly dumbfounded but then also silently wore hers and lay back to rest.\nEver since she had developed the Space ability, it was like a switch had been installed in Gu Ning’s body. If she didn’t want to sleep, then she would still be as energetic as ever even if she didn’t sleep for three days and nights. However, if she switched on the sleeping mode, then she could fall asleep immediately the moment she closed her eyes.\nGu Ning slept for two whole hours and when she woke up, she felt a bit out of place. She and Ji JiuZe were sitting in the same row and she was seated in the inner seat, leaning against the right side. Yet, right now she was leaning against the left side and the fabric next to her face was very comfortable……\nShe actually slept on Ji JiuZe’s arms?! Then Gu Ning heard the sound of the book flipping as Ji JiuZe had already woken up and was reading a book. As if he was afraid of waking Gu Ning, he was using his other hand to flip the pages which she could hardly feel any movement from it…… Just as Gu Ning was about to pretend to turn her body in her sleep, Ji JiuZe’s nonchalant voice rang out: “We’re almost there.”\nIt was obvious that he had noticed that she was awake.\nGu Ning stiffened for a moment, then silently sat up straight. She quietly took off the blindfold and returned it to Ji JiuZe.\n“Excuse me, please pour another cup of warm water.” Ji JiuZe said to the stewardess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Yes, just a moment, please.” The stewardess said softly with a very beautiful smile on her pretty face. ”\nWithin a few moments, a glass of warm water was brought over: “Your warm water, sir.”\n“Thank you.” Ji JiuZe took the glass and handed it to Gu Ning next to him.\n“Ah, thanks.” Gu Ning hurriedly took it and then slowly sipped it.\nAs soon as Gu Ning got on the train, she put on a blindfold so Zhao Lin didn’t get a good look at her. Also, the people sitting in this first-class carriage were generally of a more substantial financial status. Zhao Lin chose such a job after graduating from university and it took her some while to be promoted to the first-class carriage so naturally, she had her plans.\nWhen she came over to the compartment, she caught a glimpse of Ji JiuZe, who was wearing a blindfold but his sharp features could still be seen. Coupled with his expensive-looking long coat, matching pants, and shoes, the more Zhao Lin looked at him, the more she was attracted to him. She even had a vague feeling that her chance was about to come.\nZhao Lin then subconsciously glanced at the woman sitting next to him, who was wearing the same “black” blindfold but was immediately put off by the thought of them being companions from the sight of Gu Ning’s short, “non-mainstream” blonde hair and inexpensive sportswear. Then Zhao Lin started to think about how she was going to get his attention later, preferably leaving a way to contact and Ji JiuZe woke up after about an hour or so of the nap.\nOnce she saw him remove the blindfold, Zhao Lin could hardly contain her joy and a sweet smile appeared on her face.\n“Excuse me, can I have a glass of warm water, please. Thank you.”\nHe was so polite and courteous!\nAfter handing the warm water to Ji JiuZe, Zhao Lin noticed that the woman sitting next to him had her head leaning on him! The seat was so wide yet she had to lean on his side, she might be doing this on purpose and faking sleeping. Zhao Lin thought that in her mind and when she saw Ji JiuZe’s brow frowning slightly, it reinforced her thought. Thus, she asked in a very understanding soft voice: “Sir, do you need me to remind the lady next to you?”\nJi JiuZe froze for a moment and glanced at her before replying: “No need.”\nZhao Lin was stunned for a while then immediately thought that this man was truly a rare gentleman.\nHer smile became even sweeter as she leaned down slightly, showing the most graceful curves of her body while her gaze was subtly encouraging: “Do you need anything else?”\n“Nothing. Thanks.” Ji JiuZe didn’t even glance at her graceful body line and replied coldly. Then he picked up the magazine in front of him and put it on his lap to flip through it.\nZhao Lin’s smile paused before saying: “Alright. Please feel free to call me if you need anything.” Then she stood up and retreated to the back aisle.\nShe waited until after an hour later before he finally called her again.\nThe woman sitting next to him was already awake, and from her direction, only the side profile was visible. The woman’s skin was very pale like someone with an illness and she looked very young, about twenty-one or two years old. However, strangely enough, she looked a bit familiar.\nAfterward, she saw Ji JiuZe take the glass from her hand and handed it to the woman next to him naturally. So the two of them actually really knew each other?\nThe woman seemed to have not fully woken up and turned around with some confusion. Zhao Lin immediately froze when she saw the front view of the woman. She looked like someone she knew but why couldn’t she remember?\nAfter Gu Ning took a few sips of water, she felt a strong gaze on her so she glanced over and saw the stewardess staring at her with a frown. When their eyes met, both of them were stunned.\nZhao Lin asked with some hesitation and incredulity: “Gu Ning?”\nGu Ning also recognised Zhao Lin at this moment as she was actually a classmate from the university.\n“Oh my god——“ Zhao Lin covered her mouth incredulously: “How did you become like this?” As soon as the words left her mouth, she instantly felt a somewhat icy gaze being shot over by Ji JiuZe. Zhao Lin thought that it was her fussiness that had upset him and hastily collected the shocked expression before turning to Gu Ning and asking; “Gu Ning, when did you come back? Didn’t they say you went missing previously? We went around searching for news about you, how come you didn’t contact us even when you returned?”\nTo be honest, Gu Ning had never bothered to manage her relationships in her four years of university apart from following in Lu JiaZi’s footsteps. She had always stayed at home and had no close friends who lived in the same dormitory. When she first joined the school, she had joined a club because of novelty but she was removed three months later due to absences. Most of the time in the university consisted of a small circle of friends hanging around and since Gu Ning had always been wandering alone, it resulted in her not having any deep friendships with anyone.\nThus, after she had returned, the most troublesome thing she felt was that someone still asked her about her disappearance. Apart from her parents notifying her relatives’ family and Lu JiaZi without her knowledge, she had made a point of explaining to Father Gu not to spread the news of her return.\nGu Ning had never thought that she would meet her university classmate here. This Zhao Ling, back in the days, was a class flower. There were always one or two people in a class who were the core focus of the whole class and she was one of them. Most of the class activities were organized by her and Gu Ning still remembered that Zhao Lin had once said that she wanted to become a teacher in the future……\nGu Ning smiled politely and answered: “I’ve been too busy lately so I’ve missed informing you all.”\nZhao Lin pouted: “Really, you made us worry about you for so long! Even if you’re busy, you should have at least called us!” After saying this she stopped exchanging pleasantries and asked slightly impatiently: “Where are you heading?” Her gaze shifted to Ji JiuZe then asked tentatively: “Who is this?”\nGu Ning replied instantly without any thought: “My boss.”\nJi JiuZe raised his eyes and looked at her silently.\nZhao Lin’s eyes immediately lit up and said eagerly: “Gu Ning, give me your number so that we can get together some time with the other classmates too.”\nGu Ning smiled faintly: “Sorry, I changed my number recently and I don’t have my phone with me now. Why don’t I give you a call some other time.”\nZhao Lin couldn’t tell if Gu Ning’s speech was true or not and she could only agree to it: “Alright, make sure you do call us!”\nZhao Lin stopped chatting too much as it might make Ji JiuZe dislike her for being too noisy. Thus, she just gave a polite nod at him with a sweet smile before retreating to her seat. As she sit down, she couldn’t help but think of what kind of luck Gu Ning had gotten to go on a business trip with such a boss. Moreover, having her hair dyed in such non-mainstream colour.\nGu Ning didn’t know those little thoughts Zhao Lin had in her mind and all she wanted to do was to send her off as soon as possible. Gu Ning was slightly relieved when she had left and as for the call, she definitely won’t phone it. Right now, she was really busy and didn’t have the leisure to deal with those people that whom she didn’t have many friendships, to begin with.\nWhen she was alighting, Zhao Lin stiffly pulled Gu Ning to the side to chat a little while more.\nJi JiuZe had already alighted the train and glanced at his watch, then showed a few hints of impatience between his brows as he said to Gu Ning: “Secretary Gu, It’s going to be late.”\nGu Ning was stunned for a moment before realizing as she hold back her laughter and pretended to look anxious as she replied: “Okay boss!” Then gave an apologetic smile at Zhao Lin as she rushed off the carriage and followed Ji JiuZe without looking back.\n“Thank you, Captain.” Gu Ning sincerely thanked Ji JiuZe.\nJi JiuZe replied: “Then buy me dinner.”\nGu Ning froze for a while then answered in a matter-of-fact: “Captain, have you forgotten, I didn’t bring any money.”\nAt noon, Ji JiuZe took Gu Ning to a Chinese restaurant with a very beautiful décor of the ancient. The environment was very quiet and there was no main hall as all rooms were separated by screens.\nThe dishes were all very delicate, even the plating was very elaborate as well as the chopsticks were all silverware.\nJi JiuZe likes sweet food and Gu Ning prefers spicy food, so they had half of the dishes ordered were sweet and half were spicy. All the spicy dishes were meat dishes plus two plates of small green vegetables. The restaurant kitchen had probably never seen such an order before.\nAfter Ji JiuZe took a bite of the sweet and sour ribs, he suddenly spoke: “The sweet and sour ribs you made last time were very good.”\nGu Ning instantly understood: “…… Then I’ll make them for you again the next time?”\nJi JiuZe gave Gu Ning a satisfied look, fortunately, the disciple he had taken in was not too stupid.\nBoth of them said very little during the meal and ate with great concentration. Ji JiuZe ate more dishes and only had one bowl of rice whereas Gu Ning ate three bowls of rice in a row. As long as the dishes had meat in them, they were all picked out and eaten, leaving only some vegetables left,\nWhen the bill came, the waiter smilingly quoted the figures which made Gu Ning stare in awe upon hearing it.\n“The meal is delicious but it’s also very expensive.” Gu Ning muttered and as she went out of the door, she deliberately glanced back at the signboard above it. Gu Ning silently remembered the name in her mind and dragged it into her blacklist. When she looked back at Ji JiuZe, she felt profound about what it meant to be rich and unrestrained.\nAn S-rank mission was worth tens of millions but for two people to have a meal for over five thousand was just a bit too exaggerating.\nOver five thousand, how many supplies could she buy and bring back to the post-apocalyptic world?!\nGu Ning’s heart jolted as she suddenly remember that Ji JiuZe had told her that he wanted her to treat him to a meal. Please, it wouldn’t be of such standard right? Now Gu Ning had a small fortune but spending five thousand on a meal would be like drawing her blood away, especially when converting it into supplies, it could even be piled up into a small mountain.\nWith a plan in mind, Gu Ning immediately walked two steps faster and alongside Ji JiuZe as she asked: “Captain, previously you think that my cooking skill is kind of good right? How about the meal which I suppose to treat you,  I’ll cook it for you at home instead?”\nJi JiuZe glanced at her as he asked: “Are you very short of money?”\nGu Ning dryly chuckled and replied: “A little.”\nJi JiuZe paused before continuing slowly: “I heard from Zhuang Chen that you have a Celadon Sunflower Wash?”\nGu Ning: ……\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Late update again… Really can’t drag out more free times.. Sorry all! Anyway, this chapter is light and funny with JiuZe and Gu Ning interaction hahahaha. Alright, that’s all for now. Thank you all for reading and your kind patience in waiting. <3 )\n\n",
    "107": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-107/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen they arrived at the Five Stars Brigade Seven Squad in Pingze, then Gu Ning realised that Ji JiuZe’s words about coming to fight were actually not a joke!\nThe Seven Squad was the lowest-ranked squad in the Five Stars Brigade. In short, they were the least powerful squad yet it consisted of hundreds of members in it.\n\n\n\nThe Five Stars Brigade team was like a pyramid and they were at the bottom of the hierarchy. Thus, the First Squad was like the pinnacle of existence for them to look up to.\nTherefore, when they were informed that the captain of the First Squad was coming, it was hard to describe their excitement.\nWhen Ji JiuZe took Gu Ning to the Seven Squad’s training area, he directly ordered a few soldiers to step out.\nThe few members of Seven Squad who had originally thought Gu Ning was fragile, even with some slight contempt for her, had their contempt gone once they learned that she was the first official member of First Squad in nearly three years.\nGu Ning never had the habit of taking her enemies lightly, it was just that she usually trained by sparring with Ji JiuZe, so she wasn’t half apprehensive in her mind.\nThe first person to spar with Gu Ning was a young man of twenty-six or seven years old. His name was Yao Wei and his smile was a little shy.\nThe two parties exchanged greeting and as soon as the captain of the Seven Squad shouted start, the smile on the young man’s face instantly faded before taking the lead and attacked Gu Ning! Gu Ning’s greatest strength was her reflexes and speed, so her body dodged to the side in a flash while avoiding his punch. Before he could retreat his fist, Gu Ning’s hand fiercely probed out like lightning, using her palm as a blade to vigorously strike down towards the middle of Yao Wei’s arm!\nYao Wei was surprised by the speed of Gu Ning’s dodge and the speed of her strike. Yet, it was too late for him to dodge away so he thought of resisting her blow and then taking the opportunity to attack the side of her waist……\n“Ah!” As Gu Ning’s seemingly slender hand blade slashed at Yao Wei’s arm, a sharp pain that he couldn’t have imagined came through! Instantly, he couldn’t help but scream out miserably and his entire arm went numb! Yao Wei felt that it was not a hand-chopping at his arm, but a strong man wielding an iron bar, swinging heavily at his arm. The sharp pain of bones cracking instantly paralysed his whole arm so much that his brain went blank for a moment.\nThe next thing he knew, he has knocked off the ground with a kick and didn’t even realised until he was helped up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe captain of the Seven Squad and the few members of the squad who had come in to watch were all stunned by the scene…… They only saw that the girl called Gu Ning just hit Yao Wei, and Yao Wei began to scream miserably. His face was instantly paled as if he had been slashed by a knife. What’s more terrifying was that more than ten pairs of eyes were staring at their fight yet none could see clearly how Gu Ning had struck……\nIs this the standard of the First Squad?! Just a newcomer who had joined the squad less than a month ago was already so frightening? In just one move, Yao Wei, who had been a member of the squad for three years, and had one of the best combat skills in Seven Squad was knocked down so easily——\nIn fact, Gu Ning knew very well that if she hadn’t relied on her unusual strength which caused Yao Wei to make a wrong judgment, she would have to drag at least two or three minutes before defeating him and it definitely wouldn’t have been as clean hit as it was now.\nLooking at Yao Wei’s dumbfounded look, Gu Ning felt a bit guilty: “Sorry, my strength is a bit strong, are you seriously injured?”\nThat was just a bit strong? ? ? It was obviously *Li YuanBa! Yao Wei muttered angrily in his mind but Gu Ning’s expression was so sincere that even if he had been angry, he was too embarrassed to say it out. He squeezed out an ugly-looking smile on his face and said to Gu Ning while covering his still-shaking arm: “It’s fine. I’ve lost.”\n(T/N: 李元霸 Li YuanBa is a fictional character in the classic novel “Speaking of Tang” who was skinny like a stick, pale like a ghost but his arm had the strength of four elephants and was invincible.)\nThen he was helped to the side to rest.\nGu Ning gave an awkward glance at Ji JiuZe who was slowly drinking his tea at the side. Ji JiuZe raised his eyes to look at her, then spoke slowly: “Control your strength. You’re here to learn, not to kill.”\nThis was bluntly telling the soldiers of Seven Squad that he brought Gu Ning here to practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, in turn, the soldiers of Seven Squad could likewise learn Gu Ning’s attacking moves. It was a mutually beneficial thing and the soldiers of the Seven Squad had such a small plan in their mind but Gu Ning’s strength had clearly exceeded their highest predictions.\nThe captain of Seven Squad coughed dryly, his eyes glancing at the man sitting next to him. Zhang Xu, the same age around twenty-five or six years old, stiffened and moved his butt off the stool at the captain’s gesture. The corner of his mouth pulled up awkwardly as he made a gesture of invitation to Gu Ning.\nGu Ning nodded, then waited for Zhang Xu to attack first. Yet after waiting for a while, Zhang Xu only glared at her as if she was his nemesis, and only then did she strike.\nGu Ning’s current combat skills should be on par with Zhuang Chen’s and her strength and speed were both better than hers. Thus, right now, she was confident that if she was to have a real fight with Zhuang Chen, she was 90% sure that she could beat her. However, all along, she had faced opponents who were stronger than her, so when she fought against Yao Wei just now, she didn’t control the force and speed which caused such an effect. As Ji JiuZe said, you only had to be quick if you were there to kill.\nGu Ning was much more cautious when fighting with Zhang Xu, and under her deliberate control, her strength and speed lessened. Zhang Xu felt less pressure all of a sudden but was still secretly surprised by the speed and strength Gu Ning was displaying. Plus, this was still under her control! The First Squad really did live up to its name.\n\n \nGu Ning held two knives in both hands and dashed towards the two speedy zombies that pounced with sharp screeching. The knives spun nimbly in her hands, blades facing outwards as she slid through the middle of the two zombies with great speed! In the moment of sliding through, the knife blade made two long cuts on the abdomen of the two zombies. Foul-smelling intestines and various internal organs flowed out along the wounds on their stomachs but they were oblivious to it and were about to turn their heads to continue lunging at Gu Ning. Just then, the two heads fell to the ground, their bodies stumbled twice, and took a few steps forward in motion before thudding to the ground.\nWu Sen put away the look of amazement on his face and immediately came forward with his gun on his back and pulled out his pocket knife from his waist. He neatly dug out the crystal cores from the two zombie heads on the ground without feeling disgusted at all.\nThree days ago, he had received permission from Brother San to follow the team out on the hunt. Although there were crystal cores in the heads of the zombies, the stench and greyish-white pulp in the heads sometimes makes their hands dirty and it didn’t feel nice getting it on their hands. Therefore, digging into crystal cores could be considered a chore but Wu Sen was happy to do it. His greatest pleasure was to follow Gu Ning and dig for them as soon as she finished the kills.\nAfter he had collected the crystal cores, he saw Gu Ning once again rushing toward the three or four zombies that came over after noticing the human scents and Wu Sen’s eyes shone with admiration. Previously, what he aspired the most was to emit gorgeous psychic powers like Cheng Ming and Zhang XiaoBai, but now, he wanted to be like Gu Ning who dared to charge into a horde of zombies and carrying just two long knives! There was nothing fancy to it, just powerful slashes and the zombies that seemed so scary to him fell one by one under her slashes……\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBrother San chatted with Jia DaoZhang with a cigarette in his mouth: “Gu Ning has been acting strange lately.”\nJia DaoZhang replied: “Not recently, she’s always been strange.”\n“It’s not about that.” The cigarette in Brother San’s mouth bobbed up and down as he spoke: “Don’t you think Gu Ning has been getting skillful lately?” He looked at Gu Ning who was stabbing through the back of the zombie’s head, his eyes flashed in awe: “Before, I only felt that she was just ruthless in striking. But in the last half month, I feel as if Gu Ning has become more powerful, look at the beautiful dodging movement she just made……”\nJia DaoZhang interrupted Brother San: “Don’t look too much into these. The more powerful Gu Ning is, the better it is for everyone. Why think so much about it and make yourself a headache?” He commented and chewed on the chocolate in his mouth. Jia DaoZhang firmly believed that Gu Ning was the saviour in the post-apocalyptic world, so he had always trusted Gu Ning so much that whatever strange things happened to her was no longer weird for him. Just that…… he looked slightly sympathetically at Cheng Ming and Fang Fa who had a complicated expressions as they watched. He shook his head as he thought that it was so unlucky for them to like such a “perverted” little girl like Gu Ning.\nGu Ning was very excited at this moment, she obviously felt the benefits of learning close combat skills. In the past, when she saw a zombie, she would only think about attacking its head as soon as possible but she often failed to do so. Most of her energy was spent playing “chase” with the zombie so she only relied on her ruthlessness.\nHowever, right now, when she saw the zombie lunging toward her, countless pieces of information would instantly flash in her mind. It included what direction to dodge from, what part of the body to attack first, and then dealing a fatal blow. At the same time as these thoughts flashed through her mind after Ji JiuZe had taken her to various squads of the Five Stars Brigade for “special training”, her body seemed to have developed a reflex system that was already autonomous and reacted before her brain could send out the commands. This response was becoming more acute and clearer every day —— It was a very special and wonderful feeling.\nGu Ning now gained more confidence that she could survive in the post-apocalyptic world even if she didn’t have her powers. Compared to psychic powers that developed for no reason and she didn’t know when would it disappear. Honing the skills that required her to sweat and taking one step at a time, made her feel more at ease.\nThe image of Gu Ning wielding her long knife with a smile as she reaped the heads of the zombies caused a chill to inexplicably rise in the back of those who came over to take a break.\nIt seem that it was about time to change to a better weapon.\nGu Ning didn’t know that she had somehow become a “pervert” in their eyes as she was lost in thoughts while staring at her long knives with curled blades in disgust.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ok managed to rush out another short chapter. Gu Ning becoming more powerful weeeeeeeee! Thank you all for reading! <3)\n\n",
    "108": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-108/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning’s daily life now consisted of riding the train, fighting people, and killing zombies.\nAfter staying in the city for three days, she was taken to another city by Ji JiuZe.\n\n\n\nGu Ning hadn’t been home for three weeks and either when she was flying in the sky or running on the ground, she would still call back to check in with Mother Gu in advance. Mother Gu was always worried about her not eating well and even thought of going to her rental place to cook for a few days but Gu Ning firmly refused.\nShe also remembered the weapon that was overly damaged in the post-apocalyptic world and called Zhuang Chen to help her search for any cold weapons with high killing power.\nZhuang Chen promised to help her without even asking a single question while saying that it would be ready when she returned.\nThat was one of the things she liked the most about Zhuang Chen. As long as she didn’t take the initiative to say it herself, she wouldn’t pursue it. This was the same case with the celadon sunflower wash and this time was with the cold weapon. Every time this happened, Gu Ning was very glad that she didn’t back out when taking the oath. If she had made a different choice, then her relationship with Zhuang Chen would have ended there.\nUp to now, Gu Ning had been to three cities of Squad Seven, Six, and Five, starting from the bottom of the pyramid. So far she had yet to encounter an opponent who could make her feel very overwhelmed.\nAfter each intensive battle, Gu Ning didn’t feel fatigued but rather had a great sense of exhilaration both mentally and physically. At the same time, her combat skills were perfecting with each passing day. She learned something new from every opponent which always kept her constantly on the lookout for more.\nMeanwhile, she also felt that Ji JiuZe’s attitude toward her was becoming more “amicable”, after all, it was very satisfying to bring up a disciple with good enlightenment. Perhaps it was because her strength had improved so she had changed her attitude toward Ji JiuZe as well. The initial sense of reverence she had felt toward Ji JiuZe was slowly fading and now their relationship was more like a peer-companion than a subordinate relationship which had made her feel pressured at first.\nGu Ning, whose life had been incomparably busy, was completely unaware of how much trouble Jiang Yu was currently in.\nThe episode of the treasure appraisal show was aired last Sunday. The Northern Song Dynasty Ru-Kiln Celadon Sunflower Wash, which was identified as authentic on the show, quickly took over all the headlines on major portals overnight. Posts about the celadon sunflower wash showed up on all the major forums too. At the same time, the owner of the celadon sunflower wash, Jiang Yu, who was very pretty and elegant in her behaviour, accompanied by her sweet voice, instantly gained large popularity! Many netizens were referring to her as the goddess.\nThe highest record of discussion for this treasure appraisal show was usually maintained at over 5 million but after this episode was aired, the online discussion reached over 20 million and was still soaring. Even the shocked expressions of the experts on the show when they saw the celadon sunflower wash, were captured in pictures and made into the current hottest emoji packs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHowever, as the websites and media were gearing up to contact all parties to interview the new “goddess” who had become an overnight sensation thanks to the $200 million antique, a piece of even more shocking news erupted!\nA set of photos, apparently taken by a phone backstage at the TV station, quickly went viral with text explanation. According to this tipster, two women rushed into the lounge after the show was recorded on that day. They outright claimed that the celadon sunflower was something Jiang Yu had taken from them without their consent to be shown on the program! Plus, there were photos of evidence that the celadon sunflower wash was indeed taken away by the two women afterward.\nJiang Yu’s pale and embarrassed expression in the photo was instantly repulsive. Also, the other two women in the photo had their heads mosaiced so it was impossible to know what they looked like.\nThe internet craze was always changing in a blink of an eye. In the morning, there was still a lot of envy and jealousy, all sorts of marriage proposals, praising her beauty and temperament. However, in the afternoon, it all turned into sneering and mockery, such as green tea b*tch, wanting to gain fame to the point of craziness, and so on.\nJiang Yu’s phone was ringing all day long and the news spread quietly around her company. In the morning, it was still a peaceful scene of compliments, but in the afternoon, everyone looked at her differently.\nJiang Yu hid in the washroom, browsing through all the nasty comments on the internet. She felt that all the blood was rushing to her head, she was so dizzy that she could barely hold her phone.\nAs soon as she left the washroom, she was getting ready to apply for leave but she was called by a girl: “Jiang Yu, Mr. Huang wants you to go to his office.” There was a clear look of disdain in her eyes.\nJiang Yu entered Mr. Huang’s office in a daze, she already had a hunch. As expected, Mr. Huang didn’t beat around the bush or even ask whether the news on the internet was true but told her straightforwardly: “Jiang Yu, you don’t have to come to work tomorrow. Come back on Friday instead and settle your salary with the finance department.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“Mr. Huang……” Jiang Yu still wanted to explain and tried to save her job as this job opportunity was hard to get while she only left a week of probation period before getting the final offer…… However, Mr. Huang didn’t give her a chance to explain and interrupted her directly and rudely while saying indifferently: “You don’t have to explain anything to me. I’ve always recognised your business skills but this matter has gone too far online so I had to choose before it affected the company. I hope you can understand that.”\nJiang Yu looked at Mr. Huang’s deep eyes and only felt a lump in her throat, but in the end, she could only nod reluctantly.\nMr. Huang showed a satisfied look: “Well. I will inform the finance department to pay you an extra month of salary. You can leave now.”\nJiang Yu got up from the seat with difficulty and walked out of the door in a bit of a trance. She could feel a lot of stares being focused on her —— there were contemptuous, sympathetic, and gloating……\nAmidst these gazes, Jiang Yu slowly straightened herself and suddenly became radiant as she walked out of the company she had worked for almost three months with her head held high. The moment she walked out of the company’s front gate, Jiang Yu’s energy seemed to be drained away in a flash. She hailed a taxi casually and headed straight for home as all she wanted to do now was to get back home.\n“JiaZi, hey see if this girl is the one you had dinner with last time?”\nAs he had completed a new project, Lu JiaZi had invited the project team to have dinner together. Right now a male staff member who was usually on good terms with him suddenly came over with his mobile phone and asked.\nLu JiaZi frowned a little impatiently and a breath of alcohol came out of his mouth. His eyes immediately froze when they landed on Jiang Yu’s face on the phone screen which he reached out to take it over and took a better look. Yes, it was indeed Jiang Yu.\nHe skimmed through the news from the beginning and then subconsciously clicked on the group picture. However, his gaze soon fell on the mosaic figure…… This sportswear, Gu Ning seems to have the same piece…….\nThe male staff was still pinning him for an answer: “Right? It’s the girl from last time, right?!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“It’s my friend’s sister, I don’t know her well but just had some business dealings with her previously.” Lu JiaZi brushed it off lightly, then handed the phone back.\nThe male staff took the phone back and continued: “This girl is so bold, she probably didn’t know it was such a valuable item. If they really want to pursue her, that’s a $200 million antique case! And probably a few years in jail! She must really be crazy for wanting to be famous, isn’t she?”\nLu JiaZi smiled, took a few sips of alcohol absentmindedly, then suddenly stood up.\nThe male staff called out: “Where are you going?”\nHe replied: “Going to the washroom.” Then he walked in the direction of the washroom.\nHe stood in the hallway near the washroom, took out his phone, and flicked through the screen.\nContact.\nHis parent’s number was immediately followed by Gu Ning’s new number.\nGu Ning often changed her number when her phone card was in debt, and each time she would ask him to store her new number after his parents.\nTherefore, this time with Gu Ning’s new number, even though she didn’t request it, he had subconsciously arranged her number after his parents.\nHe stared at the strings of numbers for a long time but still didn’t dare to call it.\nAs he was about to put his phone away and rejoin the meal, a message appeared.\nHe opened it and it was an MMS message from Zhang Ji.\nThe content was simple, a photo and a line of text.\nThe texts were: “I’m in Qingping. I think I saw Gu Ning.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe photo was the back views of two people.\nOne tall and one short, one male and one female.\nThe woman was wearing sportswear and had striking short blonde hair. This back view was too familiar for Lu JiaZi and he had recognised Gu Ning at a glance. Qingping? What was she doing in Qingping? Lu JiaZi frowned slightly as he stared at the man standing next to her was wearing a long black coat, with an upright posture, and was a great deal taller than Gu Ning. Just by looking at the back view, Lu JiaZi inexplicably felt a cold solemnity.\nThis man was a little taller than the man he had seen last time at the hospital and from the back view, Lu JiaZi couldn’t recognise who he was.\nThe way how Gu Ning had treated him recently popped into his mind, was it because of this man?\nIn those three months when Gu Ning was missing, Lu JiaZi then realised that because of her, there were too many traces left by her in his life and too many habits were created at the same time. A month after Gu Ning’s trip, Mother Gu called him about Gu Ning’s disappearance. He had always known how much Gu Ning liked him but he didn’t know whether he liked her or not as he was just too used to Gu Ning swirling around him. He was often focused on planning his future career and didn’t have the time to think about what kind of presence Gu Ning was meant to him.\nYet, the next day, he suspended a project that was in progress and on a very tight schedule. He flew to the city where Gu Ning had said she was traveling, and contacted the local police and media as soon as he landed. Lu JiaZi even used his connection to spread the news of Gu Ning’s disappearance quickly through social media.\nHe spent a whole week in that city but nothing came of it, and as a result, he lost out on the project which he had been following up on.\nAfterward, he started to go back to work and socialize as normal. In the middle of the night, he would wake up from his sleep without warning, dreaming of Gu Ning being subjected to all kinds of inhumane torture.\nThis was the first time he had ever experienced what it meant to be afraid. Lu JiaZi from childhood always had a smooth sailing path. He had a great family, many friends, and even popularity among women so the only thing worth putting effort into was his current career. However, after Gu Ning’s disappearance, he often felt scared that she would never return.\nYet, even then, he didn’t feel like he was truly losing her. Right now as he was staring at this picture on his phone, with just the two back views, it was already making him feel a sense of panic from deep within his heart.\nHe finally understood that what Gu Ning had said to him the other day turned out to be true and she wasn’t throwing a tantrum with him.\nLu JiaZi didn’t call Gu Ning immediately but phoned the Gu family home number.\nIt was Mother Gu who answered the phone.\nLu JiaZi, in a rare moment of some impatience, did not exchange any pleasantries but went straight to the point: “Auntie, it’s me, JiaZi. Is Gu Ning still working as a tutor now?”\nMother Gu glanced at Father Gu beside her and made a gesture hinting it was Lu JiaZi before answering: “Yes. What’s wrong JiaZi, is there anything problem?”\nLu JiaZi replied: “Well. I’m looking for NingNing for something. Do you have the address of the family where she is tutoring?”\nMother Gu responded: “No. I don’t have it. NingNing didn’t give me the address because she was afraid that I would disturb her at work. Why don’t you call and ask her?”\nAt that moment, there was a knock on the door. Father Gu got up and went to open it, then looked at Fang Fa standing at the doorway in surprise while saying: “Xiao Fang, why are you here? Quickly, quickly, come in and take a sit!”\nFang Fa smiled as he walked in with a basket of fruits: “It’s fine. It’s all because of my friend who caused Gu Ning to be overly busy recently and didn’t come back home to see you all. I happened to be passing by near here after work so I’ve thought of coming up and finding you both.”\n“Aiya! Xiao Fang, you’re here ah!” Mother Gu’s eyes lit up at the sight of Fang Fa and forgotten that she was still on the phone with Lu JiaZi as she greeted excitedly: “This is great! Auntie has just cooked some food! Later Auntie will go and fry some more dishes so please do stay and eat with us!”\nLu JiaZi overheard the voice of the young man and the happy greeting from Mother Gu. Xiao Fang, that name was not from any of the relatives while the voice sounded very young and it seem a bit familiar….. The man which they had met at the hospital that day seemed to have the Fang surname. Moreover, listening to Mother Gu’s voice, she seemed to be very happy……\nMother Gu finally remembered that she was still on the phone and quickly asked with a smile: “Sorry, excuse us. We have a guest! Do you still need anything, JiaZi?”\nLu JiaZi paused for a moment before replying: “It’s alright. Auntie, go on with your thing then.”\n“Goodbye then!” Mother Gu hung up the phone without hesitation.\nLu JiaZi stared at the call that had been disconnected and fell into silence.\nGu Ning said she was working as a tutor but Zhang Ji had took a photo of her with a man in Qingping.\nThe expression on Gu Ning’s face changed subtly when she saw the number flashing on her phone. She hesitated for a moment but still answered the call: “Hello? Is there something wrong?”\nLu JiaZi’s voice rang out through the phone: “Where are you now?”\nGu Ning paused for a moment before replying: “At work.”\nJi JiuZe on the opposite end of the table raised his eyes and looked at her.\nLu JiaZi’s voice stalled for a while and then asked; “Tutoring still needs you to travel to Qingping?”\nGu Ning froze for a second as she replied in a cold voice: “Does it have anything to do with you. Mr. Lu”\nThen she simply hung up the call.\nListening to the noisy buzzing sound from the phone, Lu JiaZi was completely stunned.\nIt took almost a long while before someone nudged him out of his thoughts: “JiaZi? Why did it take you so long to use the washroom? You seem like your soul had run away>”\nIt turned out that someone from his group had noticed him being gone for too long so they had sent the other to come out and look for him.\n“I have to leave now for an urgent matter. You guys take your time and eat, I’ll go first.” Lu JiaZi replied and left in a hurry.\nHanging up the call, Gu Ning no longer had any appetite. She informed Ji JiuZe then took her phone and walked out to call her parents. She wasn’t sure if Lu JiaZi had disturbed them, yet it was safer for her to give them a precautionary shot first.\nJi JiuZe watched Gu Ning walk out of the room, then shifted his gaze back to the piping hot red pot that was gurgling and boiling in front of him as he pondered.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: I sincerely apologize for the late and missing update. It had been very hectic months ever since Nero came into the family. Taking care of a 3-month-old puppy is just very very tiring when he bites everything and picks scraps on the street.

    "109": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-109/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning called to test out the water with Mother Gu first and found out that Lu JiaZi had not told them about her being out of town. Then she told them she was on holiday leave today and had gone to Qingping with her friends to play. Mother Gu was still slightly nervous as after all, the last time Gu Ning went on a trip to the provinces, she had disappeared. However, after continuously assuring Mother Gu that she was absolutely safe with a group of friends, thus was Mother Gu was able to calm down.\nMother Gu suddenly said: “Oh right! Xiao Fang is with us! Do you want to have a word with him?!”\n\n\n\nGu Ning asked strangely: “How come he’s at our house?”\n“He knows that you haven’t come back for weeks so he came over especially to check up on us, the two elderly.” Mother Gu said meaningfully: “Look at how considerate and thoughtful he is……”\nGu Ning quickly interrupted her: “Alright mom, please let Fang Fa answer the phone.”\nFang Fa had overheard Mother Gu saying Gu Ning’s name and knew it was her who was on the call. His pair of chopsticks was flickering the fish meat in his bowl of rice as he focused on listening to their conversation. Father Gu watched him pinch the fish meat into pieces and shook his head silently.\nFang Fa was listening carefully while thinking that Gu Ning was so heartless. He had helped her so much help, but as a result, he had not even received a call from her for almost a month and the promised dinner had not been followed up. Fang Fa’s expression turned resentfully yet as he heard Mother Gu call him and told him to answer the phone, he froze for a moment then immediately placed down his chopsticks and ran over.\nIt’s been so long since he had last heard Gu Ning’s voice and she started speaking: “Hello? Fang Fa.”\nAs soon as he heard her voice, Fang Fa couldn’t help but crack a smile. Then instantly realised and thought that his reaction to smile so happily from just hearing Gu Ning’s voice was really too strange so he immediately controlled himself. Fang Fa subconsciously cleared his throat and replied coldly: “Well, it’s me.”\n“Fang Fa, thank you for visiting my parents, how have you been?” Gu Ning exchanged very “polite” pleasantries. In fact, she was already very familiar with Fang Fa in the post-apocalyptic world but here, their friendship was not very deep yet. Thus, Gu Ning didn’t know how to greet him and ended up sounding a bit stiff.\nYet this stiffness represents unfamiliarity.\nFang Fa was very unhappy: “Just stopped by to visit them since I am passing by. Auntie and Uncle had already invited me for dinner so there’s no need for you to thank me.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning immediately heard the displeasure in Fang Fa’s words and consoled: “I still remember that I owe you a meal. Sorry, I’ve been really busy lately so once I’ve returned to Jinyong, I’ll treat you to dinner immediately.” ”\nFang Fa grunted: “We’ll see by then. I don’t know if I’ll be free yet.”\nGu Ning chuckled and agreed to it.\nFang Fa suddenly remember something very important and lowered his voice to ask: “Gu Ning, did you succeed?”\nGu Ning instantly understood, then smiled and answered with an acknowledgement: “Mmm.”\nFang Fa was stunned for a long while before asking again: “You…… how did you even do that?”\nWhen Gu Ning remembered that Fang Fa was currently at her house, she replied: “It’s not convenient to talk about it on the phone, I should be back this week. Let’s meet up and chat then.”\nFang Fa understood that Gu Ning was still hiding this matter from her parents so he immediately agreed: “Mm, okay.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning bided goodbye: “I’ll see you soon then.”\nFang Fa couldn’t help as the corner of his lips curled up: “Mmm. See you soon.”\nHanging up the phone, Fang Fa was still a bit shocked at the news. Five Stars Brigade ahh! That was the elite Five Stars Brigade!\nWhen Mother Gu saw that Fang Fa seem surprised, she asked: “Xiao Fang, what’s wrong? What did NingNing say to you?”\nFang Fa hurriedly replied: “Nothing, just that she’ll invite me to dinner next time when she’s back.”\nMother Gu was instantly happy and continued: “Yes! That’s right. No matter how busy she is, she still needs to treat you to a meal.” Then she placed a big piece of fish in Fang Fa’s bowl of rice while hinting: “Xiao Fang, Auntie wants to ask you a question ah?”\nFang Fa answered: “Sure. Please ask, Auntie.”\nMother Gu smiled and glanced at Father Gu before asking again: “Do you have a girlfriend?”\nAlthough Fang Fa was usually rather thick-headed, being a police officer was usually about training one’s divergent thinking and associative power. After hearing Mother Gu asking this question, he immediately thought of what she was going to possibly ask next and for some reason, he got rather nervous while trying to answer it as naturally as possible: “Nope.”\nMother Gu’s eyes lit up and continue asking: “Then what do you think of our NingNing?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFang Fa’s heart was pounding fast, his face was numb and the grip on his chopsticks was stiff while his throat started to tighten. He coughed dryly before lowering his head and pretending to be picking at his food while murmuring: “She’s quite good……”\nMother Gu glanced smugly at Father Gu who was glaring at her then he interjected: “You need to speak lesser.” Then he turned to Fang Fa and said pleasantly: “Ah Fang Fa, do eat more.”\nWhen Fang Fa was leaving, Mother Gu insisted on sending him off which made him feel very embarrassed. Mother Gu only left after seeing Fang Fa driving away.\n“Why did you do that? Are you trying to pimp out your daughter?!”Father Gu was a little displeased with the way Mother Gu was acting just now.\nMother Gu rebutted discontentedly: “What pimping! Why do you sound so harsh? Look at Fang Fa, he is interested in our NingNing, so what’s wrong with me trying to help?”\nFather Gu explained: “Fang Fa likes NingNing. Then have you asked NingNing if she likes Fang Fa? You’re not helping but creating trouble for NingNing!”\n“Fang Fa is such a nice lad! He’s tall and handsome! He’s also from a good family and was brought up well. Also, in a family which can raise a child like this, the parent can’t be too far off! What’s more, he likes NingNing! ”Mother Gu paused for a moment before continuing: “Look at our NingNing, she has liked JiaZi for so many years but he just left her hanging there without stating if he liked her or not. NingNing is almost twenty-four, she has finally given up on Jiazi so I absolutely have to find her someone who can spoil her and love her.”\nFather Gu held on to his stand: “Anyway, you must first respect NingNing’s opinion. Fang Fa is a good guy and I like him too but the most important thing is whether NingNing likes him or not. You should be careful before making a mess of it!”\nLu JiaZi alighted from the plane at 8:30 pm at Qingping airport.\nZhang Ji, who had come to fetch him, was wearing a strange expression on his face and asked: “Why didn’t you inform me when Gu Ning was found? Did you two have some kind of fallout? Also, what’s with her hair colour and her temperament has changed so much that I almost didn’t recognise her —— What exactly happened with her? Why is she staying in a hotel with a man? I don’t think that man’s identity is that simple……”\nLu JiaZi closed his eyes and replied: “Can you leave me alone for a moment?”From the time he came out of the airport and got into Zhang Ji’s car, Zhang Ji had never stopped talking. Right now, Lu JiaZi was in a very bad mood and very frustrated.\nZhang Ji was a sensible person and kept quiet while glancing sideways to observe Lu JiaZi’s expression. He had only seen such an expression appear on Lu JiaZi’s face twice. Once was when he returned from the city where Gu Ning had disappeared and then right now.\nThe drive from the airport to the hotel where Zhang Ji saw Gu Ning and Ji JiuZe checked in was almost an hour away. It was already 9:30 pm when they reached.\nThe two of them walked up to the front desk and directly asked for Gu Ning’s check-in record.\nAfter the receptionist rejected to provide the information, Zhang Ji asked Lu JiaZi: “So what’s now? We can’t go knocking on the door of every room, right?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n“I’ll make a call.” Lu JiaZi replied while walking to the side, took out his phone and dialled Gu Ning’s number.\n“The number you have dialled is not in the service area……”\nWhat does this mean?\nLu Jiazi tried a few more times and the result was still the same.\n“So? Can’t get through?” Zhang Ji questioned. Lu JiaZi didn’t answer and just frowned while tightening his grip on his phone.\n“Why don’t you follow me back to my place for the night and talk about it tomorrow?…… Even if you do see Gu Ning and the guy coming out of a room, what can you do?” Zhang Ji added on: “You’re not even her boyfriend. Even if… even if you are trying to catch her in adultery, you are in no position to do so right now ah.”\nLu JiaZi’s frown tightened, and then took his phone and walked to the sofa located at the side of the hotel lobby. He sat down and told Zhang Ji: “You go back first. We’ll keep in touch by phone.”\n“What do you mean?” Zhang Ji stared at Lu JiaZi in dismay and asked: “Don’t tell me you’re going to sit here and wait until Gu Ning comes out, huh?!”\nLu JiaZi didn’t say anything but his expression made it clear that this was exactly what he intended to do.\nZhang Ji was pissed off by him: “What are you doing? This really doesn’t seem like something you would do. Have you gone crazy from some kind of provocation today?!”\nLu JiaZi, however, was unmoved no matter what Zhang Ji said.\nMeanwhile, Gu Ning had no time to think about what had happened to Lu JiaZi in the other world. She was back in the post-apocalyptic world and glanced around at all the special abilities users in the conference room. Half an hour ago, all the special abilities users in the base were called here for an emergency meeting. Although she didn’t know what was happening, Gu Ning knew that something important was definitely about to happen.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sorry once again. Here are the delayed update. After going training with Nero for the past week, he have been able to settle down more easily so that I could spare out some time to translate. Hope everything will get back on track soon. I really miss my free time doing translating… T-T. Love ya all, and thank you for reading.)\n\n",
    "110": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-110/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt was just after ten o’clock when the dawn finally arrive and it was nearing November. Gu Ning compared the weather in the other world and felt that here was much colder plus the sunset around three o’clock. By four o’clock, the sky was dark and they had to wait until the next day at ten o’clock for the sun to rise again.\nThe daylight hours lasts no more than five hours, the morning and afternoon were fine but when nights arrived, they were as cold as winter. Thus, if they didn’t have any thick blanket to keep themselves warm, it was easy to get sick. Not to mention the fact that most people were malnourished and in poor health nowadays and there was no medicine to cure them when they had fallen ill.\n\n\n\nSome quilts had been given out for free at the base recently, but the demand was just too high. Every day they heard the news of weak elderly and children passing away.\nWhen Gu Ning and the others left the base previously, they witnessed a mother holding a two to three-year-old child who had turned blue and she was kneeling in front of the tent, patting the dead child in her arms slowly. The sun had just risen in the east and the warmth of the sun shone on the weak body of the frozen child but it was unable to make the cold body warm again.\nEven Hong Jie, who is considered the most vicious in her way of speaking and ruthless in her way of handling in the Third Company, had a feeling of inexpressibility when she saw this scene. As if a boulder was placed on her chest, making her breathless and stuffy. Not to mention Cheng Ming and Fang Fa who were always so kind-hearted as well as Brother San and the rest who had vowed to protect the citizen.\nThere were a lot of mixed feelings and they felt suffocated for unable to voice it out. Right now, they live in the best houses, wore warm cotton clothes and had a thick blanket to warm themselves in the night. Even if they had a headache or cold, they still had a doctor in the team.\nThat night, Gu Ning quietly visited the director of the management office and explained her intention of donating a batch of supplies in the name of the Third Company. It included three hundred bags of rice, as well as winter clothing and quilts which Gu Ning had specially bought in bulk from another world. She also provided some emergency medicines that the base was in urgent need of.\nAs for this Director Zhong of the management, Gu Ning still trusted him a lot after witnessing him secretly gave supplies to some elderly and children on the base. Furthermore, they usually had some dealing with him and he had chatted with Gu Ning about him being helpless with a deep sense of pity in his eyes.\nThree hundred bags of rice were neatly stacked against the wall, all were fifty pounds each! Currently, the ration distributed by the base every night might not even use a bowl of rice for cooking a large pot of porridge. With a scoop from the ladle, the porridge was almost as clear as water and the soup was not even slightly cloudy. Director Zhong was anxious, with his heart burning in frustration when he saw the survivors getting weaker day by day and there was nothing he could do as the support from the capital was delayed once again. The base had limited supplies and they had to prioritize it for those survivors who were doing the labour of building the base.\nHowever, with these three hundred bags of rice, amounting to fifteen thousand pounds of rice! If they use it sparingly, they should be able to last until the next batch of supplies arrives from the capital!\nMoreover, there were quilts and clothing to keep out the winter cold. What’s even rarer were the medicines that were now scarce resources all over the world!\nWhen Director Zhong found out that Gu Ning was going to donate such a large amount of supplies, he was simply flabbergasted. After confirming repeatedly with Gu Ning that they were for donation, he was so moved to tears and couldn’t speak for a long while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning only made two requests.\nOne was that the news of her who had donated the supplies must not be leaked out.\nSecondly, it must be ensured that these supplies were provided to the elderly and children as a priority.\nAlthough Director Zhong could not understand the first clause, he still agreed to it with great solemnity. After thanking Gu Ning once more while she declined his offer of sending her back, Director Zhong stared at the piled-up supplies which filled half of the room with a great deal of emotion.\nGu Ning came out of the management office feeling nothing but relief.\nShe had consulted the team in making such a decision and everyone was very much in favour of it. Even Hong Jie who expressed concern that giving so many supplies at once would be detrimental to them later still agreed with the decision and kept quiet.\nThe next day at dawn, before they were about to head out, the management sent someone to inform them that all the special abilities users were requested to attend a meeting at the second level of the management office. There was an emergency, and all of them were required to be present.\nThe base management belonged to the authoritative governing hierarchy of the base so no matter how powerful Gu Ning and the other special abilities users were, they were still within the jurisdiction of the base after all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThus, this modest conference room was packed with the base’s special abilities users and those who knew each other well were exchanging pleasantries and passing on the information they had acquired. Gu Ning glanced at Zhang Ji, who was sitting opposite her and shook his head which indicated that he didn’t know what was going on either. Even Jia DaoZhang, the diplomatic and part-time intelligence minister of the Third Company team, had already scooted over to the other teams. Yet, within a few minutes later, he was back sitting with them and informed Gu Ning that the others also had no idea what was going on.\nRight now they could only wait for the Base Commander to arrive and find out more about it.\nThe Base Commander was a middle-aged man of about forty-five, wearing a grey woollen jumper, had very messy hair as if he had got up in a hurry and didn’t have the time to comb it. However, those who knew him well knew that his hair had always been like this.\nHe came through the door looking like one of those middle-aged old men who were sitting on the street everywhere before the apocalypse happened, without the traits of being a high-position official. Compared to him, Director Zhong, who came in behind him with a worried frown, looked more like the base commander. When he saw Gu Ning, Director Zhong’s tightly locked brow was slightly relaxed and he gave her an unnoticeable nod.\nThen the Base Commander took his seat and Director Zhong followed to settle down in the first seat on the right.\nAfter yawning, the Base Commander instructed slowly: “Director Zhong, please brief everyone on the mission.”\nDirector Zhong’s body leaned forward slightly, his face was full of solemnity: “Because of the urgency of the situation, I won’t beat around the bush with you all. The reason for requesting everyone over in such a hurry is that there is a very urgent matter that requires the help of everyone here.”\nSeeing Director Zhong’s solemn expression, all the special abilities users realised that something major must have happened this round.\n“It’s a message from the capital. Yesterday, two of our three helicopters were attacked by an unknown source and were forced to land in the Baoxi District. Contact has been lost since then.” Director Zhong frowned and continued very cautiously; “There is a very valuable document about the development of the zombie virus vaccine on this helicopter and several abilities users were responsible for escorting it.”\nAs soon as Director Zhong made this statement, the conference room immediately exploded with chattering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang Ji was the first to voice out and asked: “Has the vaccine for the zombie virus been developed?!”\nDirector Zhong replied slightly gloomy: “Not yet. But according to sources from the capital, the helicopter is carrying ground-breaking documents for vaccine development, as well as a medical expert who has made a breakthrough with the zombie virus. If anything were to happen, it would be a great loss to the entire human race! If the vaccine is developed successfully, then our country, or even the whole world, will be saved!”\nSomeone hesitantly asked: “So now we’re called in here, is to send us out to retrieve that document?”\nDirector Zhong nodded: “That’s right.”\nThe meeting room was instantly in an uproar, Director Zhong had stated that it was being attacked by an unknown source which obviously was an evolved zombie that could attack a helicopter. It didn’t require much for them to understand how dangerous this mission was and not to mention that the area where the helicopter was forced to land was the Baoxi District!\nThe Baoxi District was notoriously densely populated with zombies, and it’s not a place where they would normally go to gather supplies. Yet, the base right now wanted them to risk their lives to go there and all their discontent was overflowed all at once.\nAs for Gu Ning and her team, they were all in deep thought and kept silent.\nSomeone spoke up: “Evolved zombies that can attack helicopters…… Director Zhong, although we are abilities users, this is just too dangerous……”\n“We are all ordinary people too…… Besides, since it was the capital that received the news, then why didn’t the capital send someone over to look for it? Wouldn’t it be enough to send out a few more helicopters over to settle it?!”\n“Exactly! And there were abilities users on that helicopter so maybe they had all escaped? If we were to go over to find them, it might end up to be in vain instead!”\nThis drew a chorus of agreement and, in the end, no one was willing to go out to risk their lives for some mission to save the world.\nDirector Zhong’s expression was very grim at this point: “Everyone. Our base is the closest to the Baoxi District. It’s only two hours from here to there. If we send people from the capital, it will take at least half a day. Saving lives is like putting out a fire, every minute we delay, those people and the document on the helicopter are in danger.” He paused and then continued: “All of you must have lived in the base for some time, and without the protection of the base, I’m sure you all wouldn’t be as secure as you are right now. Since you all have enjoyed the protection of the base, you all need to fulfil some obligations as well.” As he said this, he glanced at Gu Ning before going on: “And this time, it’s not like we’re letting everyone work for nothing. This round, no matter what the final result of the mission is, everyone who participates will get a reward of fifty pounds of rice each!”\nThere was immediate silence in the meeting room.\nThe scarcity of supplies had been extraordinarily acute recently.\nAlthough the Third Company hadn’t stopped exchanging supplies, it was still a bit painful to exchange them with crystal cores that could expand one’s pool of psychic energy. What’s more, fifty pounds of rice per person was enough to last for several months if used sparingly. Just as everyone in the conference room was hesitating, a voice sneered: “Even with more supplies, you need to be alive to use them.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMost of the people in the meeting room immediately waken up from their hesitation and several groups instantly opted out.\nZhang Ji never took a stand yet but only glanced over to the Third Company team from time to time.\nJust in these few moments, Zhang Ji saw that Brother San seemed to be slightly anxious and he took a glance at Gu Ning. Gu Ning was silent for a moment before giving a slight nod then the expression on Brother San’s face immediately calmed down.\nZhang Ji was somewhat puzzled by the interaction between Brother San and Gu Ning.\nAs far as he knew, the leader of the Third Company team was Brother San, and Gu Ning had brought her parents with her to join them. Although she was a Space ability user, she was still carrying two burdens with her, so her position in the team should reasonably be somewhat awkward. However, right now the meeting with the whole team of Third Company, Zhang Ji would get the feeling that Gu Ning’s position in the team did not seem as low as he had thought. At this moment, Brother San’s very subtle interaction with Gu Ning had shown this.\nThen he heard Brother San asking: “Director Zhong, can you provide us with a copy of the exact location of the helicopter’s forced landing?”\nZhang Ji froze. The glance that Brother San had just given to Gu Ning was …… to ask her for her opinion?!\nDirector Zhong was also stunned for a while before immediately replied: “There were positioning devices on the helicopters at the time, and the capital had transmitted the precise range to be within five hundred metres.”\nEveryone else in the meeting room was silent. They didn’t expect the Third Company team, which had always been a loner, didn’t come forward easily and didn’t have a very close relationship with the base management would suddenly step forward.\nBrother San nodded, then smiled before agreeing: “Good. Count us in then.” His smile was very relaxed and was not being forced at all.\nThe Third Company team and Zhang Ji’s team were considered to be the two strongest teams in the base. However, after arriving at the base, the Third Company team had no intention of recruiting other special abilities users whereas Zhang Ji’s team had already recruited five more abilities users in just a month since they arrived at the base. Their number of men immediately overtook the Third Company team. However, perhaps, it was because the Third Company team was so mysterious and had revealed the huge amount of supplies made everyone at the base subconsciously thought that Zhang Ji’s team was not necessarily stronger than the Third Company team.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Sob.. didn’t even have time to upload the edited version from De Vile for all the previous chapter… Sorry buddy…  Soon soon. Things will get better and be on track once more. Anyway, wooooooots… action pack chapters coming soon! The rescue mission! Weeeeeeee! Thank you all for waiting and reading it.)\n\n",
    "111": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-111/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhang Ji’s gaze swept back and forth from Gu Ning’s to Brother San’s face, as if he was weighing something.\nThose previously chattering special abilities users were all stunned by Brother San’s agreement. They stared in some disbelief at the Third Company team before noticing that their team members all looked as if it was normal to accept it and none objected.\n\n\n\nThey really didn’t understand as from the “strength” the Third Company had displayed in terms of both supplies and crystal cores, they didn’t have to accept the mission. For example, the rice which was up for trading had already exceeded several thousand pounds and the number of crystal cores they received in exchange was unimaginable. Thus, why would they take up such a big risk now for just a few hundred pounds of rice given by the base?\nOr did it mean that there is a secret agreement between the Third Company team and the base which they didn’t know about?\nHowever, the Third Company team was indeed strong. Even that little girl who looked like just seven or eight years old was a Spiritual ability user. It was rumoured that when Zhang Ji’s team entered the base a month ago, there was a clash between both sides and that little girl alone was able to use her spiritual power to block the psychic attacks of more than ten abilities users! Of course, these were all rumours from the base which hadn’t been confirmed.\nMoreover, the other teams from the time they had entered the base till now when they went out to hunt for zombies, there would be some casualties more or less. Even Zhang Ji’s team with more than ten special abilities users and having only been in the base for a month already suffered two deaths by now. On the other hand, this Third Company team, which had been living on the base for nearly two months, had not even received a single casualty, let alone death.\nEvery day, when those few members went out, they would always return together. They always chatted and laughed on the way back as if they weren’t out hunting for zombies but were on a holiday instead.\nAlso, the Third Company team tends to go out to hunt zombies in areas that were densely populated and often avoided by the general survivors. Therefore, there wasn’t many encounters with other teams so their real strength remained a mystery.\nThen this mission would be a great opportunity to understand them.\nFollowing the Third Company team to go out hunting, on the one hand, they could figure out their real strength. On the other hand, the basic strength of the Third Company was there and since they dared to take on this mission, they must have a certain degree of assurance.\nFrankly speaking, fifty pounds of rice per person was still a relatively high reward and temptation.\nThe other teams in the conference room were a little excited but they didn’t make their stand immediately as they were all still waiting for the Zhang Ji team’s opinion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNaturally, Zhang Ji could feel the tense atmosphere in the conference room and those unconcealed gazes focusing on him. As if he couldn’t feel them, his fingers under the table were tapping on his thighs repeatedly while he thought about it. What the other teams had thought of, he could naturally think of it as well. Although it was said that after exchanging a few batches of supplies with Gu Ning, their need was not so urgent for the time being. Yet, fifty pounds of rice per person was a very substantial amount and tempting.\nFurthermore, if he agreed to accept it, at least half of the special abilities users’ teams in this room would join in too.\nPlus, with the strength of the Third Company…..\nAfter weighing, he finally made his decision and smiled before announcing: “Director Zhong is right, since we are protected by the base, it is only natural that we should do our part as well. So do count us in.”\nWhen Zhang Ji announced this, the conference room immediately had an uproar again. The other teams of special abilities users who had been reluctant and wanted to retreat, as they saw that the Third Company and Zhang Ji team were going, all became enthusiastic at once since it was equivalent to a double layer of insurance.\nAs for Gu Ning’s team, not everyone was joining this mission. ShiTou, Luo Long, Xiang Yi, and several others who did not have special abilities were left behind. In order not to expose Gu Ning’s healing powers, Gao Yue was coming with them.\nThus, the Third Company members who joined were Gu Ning, Xiang Xu, Brother San, Jia DaoZhang, Zhang XiaoBai, Cheng Ming, Fang Fa, Zhong Xu, Huang MengYao, and Gao Yue. A total of ten people.\n(T/N: Haiz… author just stated to bring Gao Yue along, then later part said there were a total of nine people only… XD only counted the special abilities users.)\nZhang Ji and his team, since all of them, were special abilities users, naturally, all of them were joining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe remaining other teams had all their members joined in as well.\nAfter all, one more member would mean another fifty pounds of rice!\nFrom the beginning to the end, the Base Commander sat in the main seat the whole time without saying a word and left directly after the meeting was adjourned.\nThe others went off one by one to get ready, with the Third Company team walking at the end. It was then that Director Zhong called out to Brother San.\nThe supplies which he had provided this time were all donated by Gu Ning last night, so of course, he wouldn’t think that Gu Ning and the others were aiming for those supplies. Moreover, if Brother San hadn’t been the first to come forward, then Director Zhong really didn’t know what other method he should use to convince those people to participate: “Brother San, Gu Ning, I’m really grateful to you guys this time.”\nBrother San replied with a straight face: “Director Zhong, I am still a soldier and there are many people in my team who are also soldiers.” Many things might have changed after the apocalypse happened but the sense of honour and mission that was engraved in Brother San’s soul for over ten years had not been erased. Gu Ning right now could understand Brother San’s feeling, even more, coupled with her thoughts of what she had once sworn in the Five Stars Brigade. This trip was unavoidable and was a definite trip for them.\nGu Ning remembered the hostile look Zhou Yan cast at her when Zhang Ji’s team left just now. Gu Ning narrowed her eyes, that Zhou Yan held a grudge against her and might make some small acts so it’s better to be careful of that woman and if necessary, she would strike first instead.\nGu Ning and the others had nothing much to prepare so she just had a quick word with Mother and Father Gu. Gao Yue had no complaints about the decision of having to tag along and her medical kit was full of various first aid medications that Gu Ning had equipped her with for unexpected situations.\nGu Ning’s two long knives with curled blades had been replaced with two fairly new ones.\nEach person in the group carried at least three or more replenishing transparent crystal cores with them, just to be safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThen it was time to head downstairs and meet up with the others.\nThe outcome was that there would be a total of fifty-nine participants in total.\nGu Ning’s team had ten people.\nZhang Ji’s team had fourteen people.\nThere were also four other teams joined in.\nOne of the teams was called the Nighthawks, the strongest among the other four teams was a combination of two previous teams with a total of ten special abilities users. They were led by a tall man named Wang Sheng who was probably around thirty years old with Lvl.3 Earth ability psychic.\nAnother team was called Yuezhou because all of the seven members were from the Yuezhou provinces. The captain was called Wei Xin, about twenty-seven or eight years old, wearing a pair of highly myopic glasses with Lvl.2 Fire ability psychic.\nThe next team was called the Survival Squad, with eight special abilities users, led by Yuan Ge. He was a young man around twenty-three or four years old with Lvl.3 Plant ability psychic. At a glance, the whole team consisted of young adults around the same age.\nThe last team made Gu Ning took note of them as it was the only female leader among the several other teams. The team was called Green Tree Squad, their leader was Liang Le, an Lvl.2 Water ability psychic. There were around ten members on the team, seven of them were females and the youngest was around sixteen or seventeen years old girl.\nOut of this total of fifty-eight special abilities users, Jia DaoZhang was actually the oldest, followed by Brother San. The youngest was also of their team was Xiang Xu and the ratio of female to male special abilities users was almost 5:1.\nApart from Gu Ning, there was another Space ability user in the Survival Squad. A young man in his twenties, perhaps the dangerous nature of the Space ability caused his demeanour to seem perpetually wary. His eyes always scan the surroundings vigilantly at all times.\nIn contrast, Gu Ning, who was “heavily loaded” was much more open and casual.\nAt least a dozen of these special abilities users had just evolved their powers in the last two weeks and had limited experience in actual combat.\nAfter assembling, Director Zhong rightfully handed over the command of this mission to Brother San and none had any objections to it. Anyway, no one took it too seriously as whether or not his command would work when they arrived on the scene was still another matter.\nFinally, they all got on the bus which was provided by the base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOnce on board, the bus was filled to the brim.\nJia DaoZhang consciously got into the driver’s seat.\nThen the gate opened and the bus slowly drove away from the Zhongnan base towards the Baoxi District.\nWithout anyone reminding, Xiang Xu’s spiritual energy had already spread out with the bus as the centre, covering a five hundred metre range around it. Due to the great effect of her spiritual power, every time they harvested an evolved crystal core, they would first supply it to Xiang Xu. In just a month, Xiang Xu had jumped two levels in a row and had already become an Lvl.4 Spiritual abilities user. Furthermore, her manipulation of spiritual power was also terrifying, she could leap over the ranks and kill an Lvl.5 ability user with her current strength!\nThe rank of a special ability user was divided by the amount of storage one had in their psychic energy pool.\nGu Ning really didn’t know what rank she was, she probably own the world’s largest but non-regenerative pool of psychic energy.\nApart from the noise of the bus moving, there was no other sound on the bus. Although they had usually dealt with each other more or less, it was the first time that so many people went out together. Especially because of the Third Company team, who had always taken the “high-end, cold and elegant” demeanour, the atmosphere inside the bus was somewhat awkward.\nThe area around the base was almost cleared of zombies. The bus drove for a long distance without bumping into single zombies and the shops on both sides of the road were all wide open while the inside was a mess. The corpses of the zombies and humans on the ground had all been gathered together and burned, so this section of the road looked relatively clean.\nFinally, someone couldn’t stand the loneliness and began to whisper.\nXiang Xu took the map provided by Director Zhong and guided the way for Jia DaoZhang.\nAfter driving about five miles away from the base, one or two zombies gradually appeared on the road. Those zombies that still had their faces intact after five months in the post-apocalyptic world were those that had been bitten recently. If they had been turned into zombies for more than three months, the flesh on their faces was basically hanging on and rotting beyond recognition.\nDue to the rush, Jia DaoZhang drove into the zombies on the road right away. The bus was violently bumped and swayed from those impacts. Everyone who was inside the bus had to hold on to the front seats to keep their bodies stable.\nThe bus was on the road for nearly an hour, and the journey went smoothly except for the abandoned car that got in the way and had to shift them away.\nHowever, Gu Ning didn’t reduce her vigilance.\nSoon, the bus came to a halt.\n“The bus can’t go on any further.” Jia DaoZhang was slightly grave as he explained: “The area ahead is dense with zombies.”\nThose people who had relaxed after the smooth journey was once again tensed up upon Jia DaoZhang’s words.\nThe Third Company and Zhang Ji’s team were the first to get out of the bus while the others slowly alighted.\nAs soon as they got out of the bus, they encountered a small wave of zombies.\nThe Third Company team hardly needed any command and Zhong Xu instantly shot dozens of water arrows over. Yet, from a glance, those dozens of water arrows were shot askew and were aimed at the top of those zombies’ heads instead. The other special abilities users who had just alighted were secretly laughing at Zhong Xu for his outrageous deviation aiming skill. However, in the blink of an eye, the dozens of water arrows had already sped out more than ten meters and reached the top of that small wave of zombies when Zhong Xu finally uttered a single word: “Burst!”\nThose water arrows exploded with a bang on top of that small wave of zombies!\nWhat? What kind of skill was this? Water psychic power could still be used like this?!\nEh? Yet those zombies didn’t seem to be injured by anything except being drenched……\nJust when the group of onlookers was still puzzled, Zhang XiaoBai had spread open his hands and two lightning dragons were instantly conjured from his palms while twirling around both of his arms. With a swing of his hands, the two lightning dragons rushed towards the small wave of zombies with a loud bursting thunder!\nCrackling and sizzling! —— A continuous burst of explosion and zombie howls mingled together, followed by a smell of burning mixed with rotten odour wafted over. However, no one bother to fan out the smell other than the Third Company team, the other teams were very shocked while staring at the eight zombie corpses lying on the ground.\nFang Fa dashed forward in a flash, and in less than thirty seconds, the heads of the eight charred corpses on the ground were gouged open. Fang Fa placed the knife back on his waist and the other hand was holding onto a dirty crystal core. He ignored the dirtiness and just shoved it directly into the pouch hanging from his waist.\nThen the Third Company continued on its way forward.\nThe other special ability users’ teams including Zhang Ji’s team hadn’t recovered from the scene previously. If it weren’t for those gouged corpses lying on the ground, they almost thought they had just been hallucinating.\nEight zombies including one being evolved were destroyed in less than ten seconds?!\nYuan Ge, the leader of the Survival Squad, had his mouth wide open, staring at the eight burnt and gouged corpses on the ground before cursing out in surprise.\nZhang Ji was also filled with horror and astonishment.\nHe was shocked not only by the fact that the water and lighting ability could work together so perfectly in such a tactic but by the tacit understanding between the Third Company team. In the whole process, they didn’t even make a sound nor was there any eye contact and it was so seamlessly coordinated…… He considered his team to be very experienced in actual combat but they definitely did not have such a level of tacit understanding.\n“Everyone, don’t just freeze there, we’re in a hurry.” Jia DaoZhang shouted at them after seeing that they were all still stationed at the spot.\nOnly then did they wake up from their thoughts and hurried to follow them.\nWhen several teams came together at once, naturally each of them was playing their little mind games as before any of the powerful zombies appeared, they didn’t really want to use up their psychic energy in advance. At first, they thought that they would have to go through a bit of a tussle of wits to save their strength, it seem like they were just overthinking. The Third Company team didn’t seem to have any intention of saving their strength at all. Often a bunch of zombies would rush out from nowhere and before they could get within ten metres, they would be taken care of by the members of the Third Company team who were the first to charge over.\nThey had tackled at least a dozen waves of such small groups of zombies along the way but they didn’t seem to have any intention of asking for help from other teams. The rest of the special abilities users were happy to maintain their strength and reduce their psychic energy consumption but there was always a vague feeling that something was unbalanced.\nSlowly, they realised what was the problem.\nThis area was densely populated with zombies, both normal and evolved. On average every three minutes, a few of them would scurry out of the alleyways on either side.\nThe Third Company team were on a killing spree, clearing and digging all the way. By now, they had already dug up more than ten crystal cores and one of which was an evolved crystal core! With all their strange tactics that no one else had ever thought could be used in combination like this, their psychic energy consumption was almost negligible!\n(T/N: according to the author, their tactics are considered strange but….. that should be basic physics … sciences… knowledge … XD. Oh well got to make other teams look bad hahahaha~)\nThose other teams which had been cowering at the back watching the action slowly became envious and then silently rushed to the frontline.\nStrangely enough, the members of the Third Company team didn’t fight with them for the kills. When they rushed to the front, the Third Company team retreated to the back and follow the group silently, except Xiang Xu who occasionally would point out the direction. The other members changed from their murderous mood to being as leisurely as if they were out for an autumn trip all of a sudden.\nIn the end, the other teams were struggling to clear the path and kill the zombies in front of them. Yet, when they had the time to glance back, they saw the Third Company team members were idly still and pin-pointing how the others were fairing in their combat which made them feel unequal and envious again.\n\n(T/N: Sorry all and thank you for your kind patience… I kept apologizing and delaying updated. I’m just really really busy with sudden urgent works & matters. There are 8 parts to this rescue mission yet till now I have no spare time to continue translating it…. I still have 5 more pending urgent work/project to be complete asap so only after those works are done, then I will be back. Sorry all.)\n\n",
    "112": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-112/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe fifty-nine people entered the Baoxi district at a very fast pace. The location provided by Director Zhong showed that the two helicopters had been force landed near the lake which was beside the railway station and arguably the most crowded area before the apocalypse.\nThe team’s pace was gradually slowed and with so many humans gathered together, the fresh human smell emanating from them was very strong which attracted lots of zombies toward them. Without communication devices, it would be very troublesome if they got separated.\n\n\n\nHowever, with so many of the special abilities users and Xiang Xu, a precise radar that kept them informed of where the zombies were coming from, those zombies were basically exterminated as soon as they appeared.\nHaving seen the benefits that the Third Company team had gained earlier, all the other teams unknowingly rushed to the front. The structure of the rescue squad was now being led by Lvl.3 Earth ability psychic from the Nighthawks team, followed by the Yuezhou team, then Zhang Ji’s team, the Survival Squad, and the Green Tree Squad. The Third Company team was instead squeezed to the end and had no chances to make any move.\nThey also faced the least pressure, except for Xiang Xu who kept guiding the direction with her spiritual power while the rest just followed the lead. The zombies were already taken out by the front team and if there were larger numbers, at best, they were all be wiped out by the middle team.\nWhat made the other teams unhappy once more was that as the number of zombies gradually increased, they were under a lot more pressure. Looking back at the Third Company team who were enjoying watching their battle while the feeling of their psychic energy depleting made them feel even more unequal.\nIt was just that they had squeezed their way to the front, yet now it was too obvious and embarrassing for them to shift back so they could only continue gritting their teeth while heading forward. They started to think of excuses like their psychic energy had depleted too much and required the Third Company team to take over the lead etc.\nJia DaoZhang stared at the sky before frowning: “Look at this weather, is it going to rain soon?”\nWhen they had left the base, the sun was still hanging up high in the sky but now, it had disappeared without a trace and was replaced by a large spread of dark gloomy clouds. The heavy dark clouds were pressing lower which created an ominous feeling ahead of their path.\nGu Ning stared at the dark clouds in the distance and frowned. If it was going to rain, it would definitely be a heavy downpour and it might even affect the rescue mission.\nThe recuse squad continues forward toward the lake.\nHalf an hour later, a few large drops of rain fell to the ground. Someone from the squad looked up and said: “It’s raining now!” Almost as soon as the sentence ended, a downpour of rain accompanied by rumbling thunder showered down from the thick dark clouds which instantly bound the whole world into a curtain of rain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe three teams running ahead of the Third Company team subconsciously ducked under a nearby building to take shelter from the rain.\n“What are you guys doing?! Do you guys have the time to hide away from the rain now?” Brother San shouted at them.\nWhen those teams looked over, they realised that the Third Company team and Zhang Ji’s team had all remained in the rain. However, the Third Company team was not drenched at all. The rain was pouring down but it was diverted away around a metre above their heads. The droplets splattered in the air like a flower blossoming, creating a strange and beautiful sight. It turned out that Xiang Xu had already set up a spiritual barrier to shield all the members of the Third Company team while Zhang Ji’s Spiritual ability user who reacted slower, also followed suit and set up a spiritual barrier.\n“Just get back here!” Brother San shouted impatiently.\nOnly then, were those abilities users slowly leaving the shelter and strolled over while muttering discontentedly that Brother San and the rest were as if in a hurry for reincarnation.\nAt that moment, Xiang Xu’s expression suddenly changed, and shouted harshly to those strollers: “There are zombies! Quick run!!!”\nThe rest who were facing in the direction of those slow strollers had a dramatic change in their expression at this instant!\nThose strollers who were standing beneath the building’s shelter heard Xiang Xu shout. One of them reflexively glanced back and was instantly hit with a strong fishy smell, followed by the sight of something he could never imagine at all. It was a huge open mouth! In the next second, the huge mouth bit off his head in a single bite! With a chilling bone cracking sound, a sticky liquid of brain matter mixed with blood slowly dripped down from the mutated zombie’s mouth ——\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe body that had its head bitten off collapsed to the ground with a loud thud, and blood continued to ooze out from the broken neck —— the man who was alive just a moment ago had turned into a headless corpse in an instant.\nA dead silence —— yet only the chewing sound of the mutated zombie echoed in everyone’s ears ——\n“Ou ——“\nSomeone who was triggered by the scene started dry vomiting and gagging.\nEveryone was instantly jolted back into their senses!\n“Run!!!” Gu Ning and Brother San shouted at the same time!\n“AHHH!!!” As if the paused video began to play, those strollers who had been taking their own sweet time were all running away frantically!\nNow and then, a mutated zombie would just swoop down from the ceiling and land in the crowd. It spread opened its huge, terrifying mouth and bit off a head while munching with enjoyment!\n“Crap! What the hell is this?!”Zhang XiaoBai yelled out in shock as he watched the mutated zombies that kept dropping down from the ceiling.\nTheir bodies were like normal human beings yet their heads were large, at least four or five times bigger than normal humans! What was even more frightening was that there were no other facial features on that face except the big mouth. It might have been squeezed to somewhere else but right now all they could see was a huge incomparable mouth that kept opening and closing while munching on the human head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe mutated zombie which didn’t manage to pounce on its prey from the first dive opened its huge mouth and a bright red fat tongue came stretching out of it! The slimy wet tongue snapped out, and curled around one of the girl’s necks before dragging her over in an instant as the girl stared in unbridled horror! And then CLACK! With a disturbing sound, a head crumbled beneath the mutated zombie’s uneven but exceptionally sharp teeth.\nThere had been five to six of such mutated zombies fallen from the ceiling since the first one appeared! It had only been a matter of a few breaths! Yet in the blink of an eye, half a dozen of the abilities users had their heads already bitten off!\n“Mutated zombies!” Even Gu Ning, who had a strong heart, couldn’t help but shiver at the sight of the scene! Subconsciously, she gripped the long knife in her hand tightly. Although they had encountered mutated zombies several times, this was the first time they had seen something so disgusting and horrifying! The others even felt their legs go weak.\nGu Ning keenly observed that although the limbs of those big-headed zombies were like the size of a normal human, it didn’t slow them down at all! Apart from Fang Fa who was a Speed ability user, no one else would be able to outrun them! The decision was instantly made, and after a glance with the rest of the team, they all started to mobilize their psychic powers to attack!\n“Attack!”\nGu Ning didn’t unleash her Plant ability but coldly bellowed before swinging the long knife in her hand and rushed directly toward a big-headed zombie that was lunging at a screaming girl from the Green Tree Squad!\n“Gu Ning!” Zhang Ji was taken aback when he saw Gu Ning had charged over with just her long knife in hand. He subconsciously began to mobilize his psychic power as two lightning bolts instantly wrapped around him!\nThen he saw a scene that left him dumbfounded!\nGu Ning rushed over as fast as lightning! The big-headed zombie had reached behind the girl and its bright red tongue was sticking out while trying to wrap around the back of the girl’s neck! Simultaneously, Gu Ning had also reached them! The moment the cold, slippery tongue touched the back of the girl’s neck, without any hesitation, Gu Ning slashed down with her knife!\nGu Ning struck hard and fast! Her speed was so quick that the knife in her hand became a flickered shadow! A full force slash! All that could be heard was a swish! The fat tongue was unable to retract in time! And was severed off a palm-width size! Blood came gushing out! Sprayed onto the back of the girl’s head! The girl was so scared that her legs went limp as she fell to her knees! Followed by an unbearable hiss from the big-headed zombie!\nThe girl turned around with a shudder and saw Gu Ning standing behind her with a knife in hand. On the ground, there was a small piece of the tongue being cut off while she felt a wetness on the back of her head. Then the girl reached back and touched the wetness before withdrawing her hand back into her sight. She saw a handful of blood and a dizzy spell swept over her once again.\nGu Ning had no time to bother with the girl who had only recently developed her powers and fainted from fear. She stared solemnly at the big-headed zombie in front of her that was glaring back with an incomparably hateful gaze. Finally, she saw its eyes. The pair of bloodshot eyes were on both sides of the big mouth. Those pair of eyes were full of hatred and the tongue which was severed off a piece by Gu Ning was hanging out on the side of the mouth. The blood had gradually stopped gushing but it looked extraordinarily bizarre and horrible.\nFiercely! The seemingly powerless tongue suddenly struck straight and jabbed towards Gu Ning!\nGu Ning’s reflexes and speed were certified by the Five Stars Brigade! Despite the chill in her heart, she remained calm and just retreated sharply around two metres away before screeching to a stop abruptly! Gu Ning immediately leaped and throw her weight backward as she did a backflip in the air! Her entire body was arched like a bridge in the mid-air while the tongue was still heading straight toward her initial position. The tongue which was sticking straight out and aimed for her neck was trying to retract when it didn’t grab onto anything. Even though the big-headed zombie was quick, it wasn’t as fast as Gu Ning. Thus, when Gu Ning had stopped abruptly in her track, the big-headed zombie tongue was still in the motion of lurching forward! Gu Ning did a backflip and the moment she was on her feet, she dashed forward with the long knife —— and stabbed right into the big-headed zombie’s open mouth!\n“Pfft ——!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe moment Gu Ning and the big-headed zombie crossed each other path, the long knife went straight through its mouth and poked out at the end of the head from her full sprint. Gu Ning expressionlessly twisted the knife’s hilt and stirred around in the head before pulling it out with a “swoosh”.\n“Bam ——” The big-headed zombie corpse collapsed onto the ground.\nZhang Ji stared at the expressionless Gu Ning and gulped with difficulty.\n===============================================================\n(T/N: Ok… finally another chapter….Thank you all for reading and your kind patience/understanding.)\n(Haiz… I’m getting old and energy level isn’t as great as before… Luckily, I don’t have kids.

They managed to temporarily stop the rampage of those big-headed zombies while the others gradually regained their composure. However, the rest were still badly shaken in their mind when they looked at the headless bodies on the ground.\nIn just a short span of fewer than two minutes, the death toll of the recuse squad was already as high as eight, seven of which became the headless corpses on the ground. Apart from the Third Company team and Zhang Ji’s team who did not take coverage from the rain, several other teams were all suffering from injuries from the sudden attack. The mutated zombie which Gu Ning had killed was the smallest of them all and relatively speaking it was the weakest.\n\n\n\nSeeing that the other mutated zombies were temporarily restrained, Gu Ning bent down to dig out the crystal core and kept it away. She wiped away a handful of rain from her face before dashing toward another big-headed zombie with the long knife in her hand.\nPuddles of rain were splashed by Gu Ning as she rushed forward with her long knife while dodging the big-headed zombie’s curling tongue. The moment she stepped sideways to avoid the incoming tongue, her long knife stuck precisely into the neck that looked unusually slender because of its big head. With a strong swing, the knife instantly sliced through the most vulnerable neck ——\nThe huge head rolled off from the neck and landed in the puddle with a snap. It caused a huge splash while instantly turning the large puddle into crimson red.\nThe others cast horrified glances over at Gu Ning!\nThese big-headed zombies seem ghastly but their actual combat power was nowhere near as tricky as the tentacle zombies which Gu Ning and the Third Company had encountered, as well as the long-tailed zombies from the hospital.\nIn the beginning, they were stunned and confused which resulted in the loss of so many teammates. Moreover, those who were killed were generally those who had just developed their powers and didn’t have much real combat experience. Thus, their legs instantly went weak when they were forced to face those big-headed zombies.\nThe last big-headed zombie was finished off by a few other abilities users attacking it. As if they were afraid of being robbed, the Yuezhou team immediately dug out the crystal core and then hid it after switching among a few of them.\nIn the end, the Third Company team had gained four mutated crystal cores and three of which were all killed by Gu Ning. Zhang Ji’s team gained two while the other three teams gained one each and only the Green Tree squad gained none.\nBrother San wiped a handful of rain from his face and stared at the paled bodies on the ground. His expression was stony as the recuse squad had lost eight men without even seeing any sight of the helicopter.\n“Are all our men okay?” Jia DaoZhang counted and was relieved to find that none were missing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe other teams started to count their losses, except for the Third Company team and Zhang Ji’s team, all the other teams suffered some casualties and deaths. The leader of the Green Tree squad, Liang Le, was very grim as three of those deaths were in her squad while several other girls in the squad were silently wiping their tears away.\nWhen Brother San noticed it, he asked Fang Fa, Cheng Ming, Zhang XiaoBai and a few other men to carry all those corpses to a dry area before getting Huang MengYao to set them on fire.\nIn the battle just now, Xiang Xu’s spiritual energy was focused on the entire area and was ready to rescue her team members in case they were in danger. She had to concentrate intensely and could no longer conjure up a barrier to shield everyone away from the rain. Thus, everyone was drenched and soaked for now.\nEveryone started to feel the chill and coldness from the rain. All of them headed toward the direction that Xiang Xu had pointed out to be the safe zone. They found a house and entered while Gu Ning took out fifty sets of clothes from her space and handed them out. Immediately after changing into dry clothes, they felt their bodies were gradually warming up. Inevitably, after encountering such a dangerous situation, a number of them had developed a sense of retreat.\n“We’ve already lost three members.” Liang Le, the leader of the Green Tree squad, looked grimly and hesitantly voiced out her thoughts: “We don’t want to continue anymore.” There were only ten of them in the group yet three died at once, it was reasonable why she was so upset and made such a decision.\nUpon hearing her statement, the other three teams who suffered injuries had the same hesitant looks on their faces. It seems like all of them had the intention of withdrawing.\n“Think it over guys. You have already lost a few men but the payment will still be the same. It is equivalent to the fact that you have now been paid an extra one hundred and fifty pounds of rice. You all should consider carefully whether you want to back out or not.” Zhang Ji pointed out soberly.\nThis was a cold-blooded statement, but it was the truth too. Those members had died but the payment would remain in the team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe expression on those people all changed slightly and even the Green Tree squad who had been determined to leave became hesitant at this point. However, someone sneered: “There’s not a single person from either of your teams died and you guys have collected the most crystal cores. Of course, you would say something like that.”\nZhang XiaoBai’s expression darken, he was a man who refused to take any sh*t and immediately sneered back: “It was because you guys broke away from the group to hide away from the rain that’s why your team suffered causality! If it wasn’t for us, more of you would have died! The number of crystal cores is based on everyone’s ability and no one is stopping you from killing the zombies.”\nThat person immediately choked on his words and grimaced.\nSeeing their hesitation, Jia DaoZhang hurriedly interjected: “Everyone, please listen to what I have to say. Now we are not far from where the helicopter had landed, maybe if we continued for a little bit longer, the piles of supplies will be secured. If we return now, those people will die in vain since there won’t be any payment so it’s not worth the loss. Besides, there aren’t any powerful mutated zombies along that way but it’s not certain that you won’t encounter them if you head back now. Thus, it would be safer to follow the main group.”\nSeveral other team leaders had mixed feelings but it was Yuan Ge of the Survival squad who replied: “Jia DaoZhang is right, it would be too unprofitable if we go back just like that. Since we are already here, then let’s go all the way.” His group consisted of all young adults and they agreed with it.\nThat left three teams undecided.\nThey were the Nighthawk squad, Yuezhou team and Green Tree squad which were somewhat hesitating.\nGu Ning took a look at the heavy downpour and frowned coldly: “Let’s go.” Then she was the first to walk out of the room and the rest of the Third Company team followed without hesitation.\nThe scene of Gu Ning slaughtering three big-headed mutated zombies with knives was still so fresh in their minds. Even they, who were special abilities users, could not complete the three kills as cleanly as Gu Ning did. Gu Ning’s silent image instantly transformed into gore and coldness.\nThe leaders of the Nighthawk squad and Yuezhou team looked at each other and without further ado, they hurriedly raised their steps to follow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOnly the Green Tree squad was left and they were still indecisive. However, they were also the weakest so they had no choice but to passively follow the group and move on.\nThe rain splattered over the spiritual barrier silently, flowing down the edge of the barrier. The only sound that echoed through the rain was their heavy footsteps.\nGu Ning ignored the complicated gaze that Zhang Ji kept casting over now and then.\nThe closer the group got to the objective location, the more depressing the atmosphere became. As more and more zombies rushed out from the streets and alleys in all directions, even Gu Ning’s expression began to grimace and everyone else had a very solemn look. Gold, wood, water, fire and earth plus the three mutated elements wind, lightning and ice, intertwined to form a barrier. It crushed any low-level evolved zombies and ordinary zombies that appeared, and at this time, no one was thinking of hiding their special abilities anymore. After all, if they didn’t use it now, they might not have the chance to use it later. With the torturous hissing from the zombies, the team continued to advance with difficulty.\nFinally, they reached the five hundred metres range provided by Director Zhong.\nA five-star hotel could be seen, which was significantly taller than the rest of the buildings in the area, almost reaching forty storeys.\nThe helicopter was located within a five hundred metre radius of this five-star hotel.\nAs soon as they found the helicopter which had crashed into the flower bed in front of the hotel, their spirits were lifted and ran towards it.\nWhen the helicopter was forced to land, it didn’t choose a good location to crash or it was under another attack as the whole body of the helicopter was covered in scratches and only one piece of the propeller remained. The other piece had flown almost thirty to forty metres away from the crash scene and was tipped on its side in the flower bed.\nInside the helicopter, was a man’s body being severed off by some sharp object. The lower half of his body was fastened onto the seat but his upper half was thrown outside of the helicopter and connected only by a few intestines that were still dangling in between the two body parts. From the face that was still visible, the man was probably around thirty and the whole scene was utterly gruesome.\nFang Fa suppressed his discomfort and checked out the helicopter carefully.\nAfter searching for nearly half an hour, two more helpers went in to double-check. However, neither of them found the suitcase that Director Zhong had mentioned nor any other documents.\nThere was only this corpse being found.\nYet, there were two helicopters and there was no information about the vaccine on this so it must have been on the other chopper.\nXiang Xu and the spiritual ability user in Zhang Ji’s team, both poured out their spiritual energy to investigate the whereabouts of the other helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMore zombies were swarming in from the direction in which they had come from.\nGu Ning took a step forward with her knife and suddenly stepped on a bulge. She subconsciously moved her foot away and glanced down, then she saw a red five-star badge lying on the ground covered with mud.\nGu Ning recognized it at once as that was the badge of the Five Stars Brigade.\nIt was the five-star badge that only the First Squad was qualified to wear it……\n\n(T/N: Thank you all for your kind patience and sorry for the long-awaited chapter… The next chapter is halfway there but as usual… the mathematic from the author T-T…. just left me confused hahahahaha. Hopefully, it will be done tmr… thanks all and love you guys if you are still there… XD)\n\n",
    "114": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-114/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning picked up the badge and placed it carefully in her hand to double check and it was indeed the Five Stars Brigade badge with the five stars being plated with real gold. Whose badge did this belong to? Who was on the plane? Was it Zhuang Chen, Yi ShaoQing, or Ji JiuZhe?\nGu Ning felt a little dazed for a moment as she thought of the corpse that had been severed in half.\n\n\n\nWhen Brother San saw Gu Ning stopped in her track and picked up something from the ground. He hurried over to check on the stunned Gu Ning and asked: “Gu Ning, are you alright?” Brother San was in shock after getting a glimpse at the five-star badge in her hand: “This, this seems to be the badge of the Five Stars Brigade. Could it be that they were the ones on these helicopters?”\nGu Ning clenched the badge in her hand, calmed down her nerves, and stopped moving ahead.\nInstead, she stayed by Xiang Xu’s side.\nTime seem to be slowed down suddenly, Gu Ning was a little anxious and restless. She kept holding back the urge from turning around to look at the crashed helicopter scene.\nZhang Ji hesitated for a moment, then came over: “Gu Ning, are you alright?”\nGu Ning shook her head: “I’m fine.”\nZhang Ji actually had a lot of questions in mind but he didn’t know where or how to start asking them. He wanted to ask how was it possible for Gu Ning, who came in second to last in the 400m run at the sports day, had become what she was now.\nAt that moment, Xiang Xu who kept her eyes shut, all of a sudden snapped open and exclaimed: “Found it!”\nGu Ning’s spirit was lifted and asked immediately: “Where is it?!”\nXiang Xu looked up to the roof of the hotel: “Right at the top of the building.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning, Zhang Ji, and a few others glanced up at the building and could barely see the roof. Zhang Ji frowned before stating: “This building has at least forty floors.”\nWith over forty floors to the roof and no electricity for the elevator, all they could do were climb up one floor at a time.\nAfter taking care of some of the zombies surrounding them, the group retreated into the hotel’s lobby. It was a mess and filled with corpses of adults and children. Almost all of them had been chewed on by zombies, making it difficult to even find a whole corpse intact.\nGu Ning roughly glanced through it and instructed: “Half of the men will follow me and the other half will remain here.” Then she continued: “Fang Fa, Cheng Ming, Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and Xiang Xu, you five will go with me. Brother San, Jia DaoZhang, and the rest will stay down here.”\nBrother San had no objection and agreed: “Alright, take care of yourselves guys”\nNo one suggested Gu Ning stay down here with them as they knew very well in their minds that she had far surpassed them in both physical strength and combat ability.\nZhang Ji had realised that he had completely misunderstood Gu Ning’s position in the Third Company ever since he had witnessed her killing the big-headed zombie. Thus, right now he took the initiative to speak up: “I’ll go with you.”\nThere was also an Earth ability user in his team as well as Zhou Jian’s sister, Zhou Yan, who also volunteered to head up. Gu Ning also requested the Spiritual ability user in Zhang Ji’s team to tag along.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe other teams also sent two or more physically fit members to follow Gu Ning.\nWithout further delay, Gu Ning led the team toward the stairs\nThe stairs were so narrow that three people could barely walk side by side with each other. Therefore, they spaced themselves from each other around a metre apart in case there was no room to manoeuvre during an emergency. The Third Company team took the brunt of the action, followed by Zhang Ji’s team, the Survival squad, the Yuezhou team, the Green Tree squad, and finally the Nighthawks squad at end.\nThe difference between a special ability user and an ordinary person was not only about their psychic abilities but also in terms of their physical strength. Yet, climbing up stairs of more than 40 floors was still a bit strenuous.\nFang Fa walked at the front of the group since he was a Speed ability user and his strides seemed unusually brisk compared to the others. It was understandable for him to maintain such a brisk pace when he had already reached the tenth floor, but Gu Ning was following closely behind him and her pace did not even reduce in the slightest. She didn’t even pant and her breathing was as calm as if they were walking on flat ground.\nZhang XiaoBai, Cheng Ming, and Zhong Xu were well aware of Gu Ning’s crazy physical strength, but the others weren’t. Gu Ning’s previous reticence was due to timidity in their eyes, but now that timid and slender image was crumbling in their mind. It was replaced by the way Gu Ning wielded her knives to kill the mutated zombies without any hesitation.\nZhang Ji felt even more complicated than the others at this time.\nWhile Zhang XiaoBai and the others had never seen Gu Ning’s former personality, Zhang Ji knew her past very well. She was the girl who always smiled and circled around Lu JiaZi. She also loved to wear all kinds of dresses and could cook very well. Moreover, she had almost no temper at all, so it was very hard to relate the former Gu Ning to the girl who now had short blonde hair, wore a long grey sports attire, and carried knives around with an indifferent look.\nEven if the apocalypse would change a person and their personality, what about her skills? How did she become so powerful? It was really puzzling as Zhang Ji thought silently in his mind.\nAlthough Gu Ning had calmed down her emotions which had fluctuated violently because of that five-star brigade badge, her heart was incomparably worried and heavy. Who was the owner of this five-star badge? Most importantly, is this person still alive……\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThey had climbed over thirty floors.\nThe distance between each other was getting farther apart, at first it was just three steps, but now it became nine or ten. The last one was even left behind at twenty-plus or so floors. Even Zhang XiaoBai and Zhong Xu who had excellent endurance were starting to get a bit overwhelmed while Cheng Ming was also gritting his teeth to support himself. Most of them were sweating profusely and panting while hanging onto the railing as they struggled to climb upward.\nFang Fa was a Speed ability user so this was to his advantage. What the others couldn’t understand was how did Gu Ning manage to keep up with his speed to this point without looking tired at all? If they remembered correctly, she was only a Space ability user, right?!\n“Fang Fa, hold on.”Gu Ning called out to Fang Fa, who was still going up, and gestured for him to look at those behind them: “Let’s take a break first.”\nFang Fa glanced at those panting, pale-looking faces behind him, he stopped his strides with some embarrassment and scratched his head.\nHowever, the moment Fang Fa stopped in his track, Gu Ning suddenly snapped her gaze in his direction. He was standing on the platform between the thirty and thirty-one floors and was facing a small door on the opposite side of the wall. The door was tightly shut and it didn’t look any different from others yet for some reason, Gu Ning had a sudden ominous feeling!\nShe subconsciously glanced over at the Spiritual ability user in Zhang Ji’s team! Just in time to find her standing in the middle of the next floor while Zhou Yan was beside her. Both of them were looking in her direction at the moment and were startled by Gu Ning’s fierce gaze when their eyes met. The Spiritual ability user’s gaze flickered away as if she had done something wrong while sheepishly avoiding Gu Ning’s gaze. Yet, Zhou Yan who was beside her gave a sarcastic and smug smile.\nGu Ning’s heart suddenly leaped and her expression changed! She instantly snapped her head to look at the door, and then saw slight vibration on the door…… Gu Ning shouted: “Fang Fa watch out!” Yet the moment her sentence ended, a loud boom! Rang out instantly! A huge force hit the door and the whole wooden door was flung off in a second! The lifted door slammed straight toward Fang Fa!\nCausing shrieks from below!\nFang Fa, however, seem to be stunned and stood there frozen in his tracks!\nGu Ning screamed in her mind, but her body reacted even faster than her brain! In a flash, she rushed forward and lunged at Fang Fa! He had been frozen by the sudden loud noise! Before he could react, his whole body was knocked out of the way! And then slammed heavily on another wall, the door grazed his arm before crashing onto the wall beside him. There was a splash of wood splinters everywhere!\nAlthough Gu Ning managed to push Fang Fa away, the door brushed hard past her right shoulder. The sharp pain made Gu Ning knit her eyebrows yet there was no time to check on her injury. She clutched the knife in her hand with a grave expression, her gaze slowly trailed from the huge stone pillar in front of her feet and fell on the hovering corridor beyond the knocked-out wooden door. A mutated zombie was leering at the ground.\nGu Ning had seen many different kinds of mutated zombies but this was the first time she had seen such a huge zombie. It was so enormous that its body looked like a puddle of mud and almost filled the entire corridor. The fluid travelling in the veins beneath the propped-up skin could be seen and there were numerous wounds and slime all over its body as well. One of the wound seem to be caused by some unknown sharp object and some green slime were oozing out from one end of its body to the other. Many tentacles grew on top of those bodies, twisting and turning while being entangled. If anyone with trypophobia saw this sight, they would probably vomit, and even Gu Ning without having the phobia also found the mutated zombie very disgusting.\nUpon taking a closer look, Gu Ning noticed the oddity of the mutated zombie. Some of those tentacles were thick while some were thin and seem lighter in colour…… It seem like they were newly grown and combined with those previous wounds on its body, maybe it had already engaged in a tough battle not long ago……\nIf she was right, it should be caused by the Five Star Brigade. Furthermore, since they were still able to fight off this mutated zombie, that would prove that at least they were still alive and had not been in the helicopter crash but managed to make a forced landing. The thought of this brought a very untimely surge of joy to Gu Ning’s heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFang Fa forced down the gastric acid that rose to the back of his throat due to the sight of the disgusting mutated zombie. Those big-headed zombies from half an hour ago were disturbing enough but never once did he think that the more revolting would follow later.\nIn one of its tentacles, the mutated zombie had a huge stone pillar rolled up in it and the door that had just been smashed away was done by this stone pillar. The image of a tentacle that was only the size of an arm being able to swing a stone pillar that required two hands to hold by a normal adult was utterly bizarre.\nAlthough Gu Ning couldn’t see where the eyes of the mutated zombie were, she could feel that its strong gaze was “staring” at her. Strangely, she felt that the mutated zombie’s gaze was full of hatred and at the same time seemed to have deep scruples……\nZhang Ji saw Gu Ning and Fang Fa almost being crushed by the door and immediately guessed what had happened up there. Associating with Gu Ning’s sudden glance to the back just now, he instantly thought of something and turned his head to stare at Lu Qi and Zhou Yan. Lu Qi didn’t dare to meet his gaze but Zhou Yan’s expression was full of grim and hatred mixed with pleasure which made Zhang Ji feel very repulsive.\nZhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and Cheng Ming were all stunned by the sudden attack just now and immediately rushed up when they came back to their senses. After spotting the mutated zombie, a feeling of nausea rose in their stomach.\nGu Ning had a deadly stare fixed on the mutated zombie, it was as if she was trying to intimidate the mutated zombie before ordering in a low voice: “Get ready……”The psychic energy in her body began to surge wildly as she prepared to utter the word run.\nHowever, the mutated zombies reacted first!\nInstead of attacking it was moving backward!\nThe huge body was moving backward and away from the staircase as it headed to the other side of the corridor with great difficulty! The tentacle that was wrapped around the stone pillar was still raised high while its “eyes” were still fixated on Gu Ning. As if it would swing the pillar as soon as Gu Ning made a move.\nIt just stared at Gu Ning while slowly retreating and disappearing from her sight afterward!\n\n(T/N: Well… the last few paragraphs and proofreading it took almost forever.. XD)\n\n",
    "115": "https://knoxt.space/the-door-to-rebirth-in-apocalypse-chapter-115/\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe zombie had just retreated and disappeared from Gu Ning’s sight. If it wasn’t for the smashed door, the floor full of wood splinters while covered in green slime that oozed out of the zombie’s wounds, and her right arm that was still faintly painful, Gu Ning would almost have thought that the appearance of the mutant zombie just now was a hallucination on her part.\nFang Fa stared at the empty corridor with disbelief and a little incomprehensible before asking: “It… it run away?”\n\n\n\nCheng Ming and Zhang Xiaobai were also speechless.\nIt was no wonder that they were surprised because nothing could stop the zombie’s instinct to feed on living things. They had experienced so many battles with them and each time they had to kill them to avoid being bitten. Never once did they encounter such situation where the zombie retreated.\n“Is this …… It’s being scared off by us?” Zhang XiaoBai exclaimed with disbelief.\nGu Ning was also puzzled if that zombie had fled because of those wounds on its body and knew it was no match with them. Then did this prove that the zombie that had been regarded as having no autonomous consciousness and only preying on living things by instinct had evolved autonomous consciousness?! The zombies in the state of instinct were already so terrifying if they were to evolve autonomous consciousness…… Gu Ning shivered from the thoughts of the possibilities.\nHowever, this wasn’t the time for them to worry about it. The alarm had been lifted for now but there was still an unsettled score to settle.\nGu Ning’s icy-cold gaze focused on the spiritual ability user, Lu Qi, who was standing behind Zhang Ji and beside Zhou Yan whose expression was a bit unsightly. Gu Ning had specifically requested the spiritual ability user to follow them so that they could prevent this unpredictable danger from happening. If she hadn’t discovered it quickly just now, Fang Fa would have been seriously injured or maybe even lost his life. Gu Ning knew very well that their target wasn’t him, as apart from Fang Fa, she was the closest to that zombie, and right behind her, were the members of the Third Company team. If there was any slight mistake, the Third Company team would be the first to suffer!\nIt’s just that now was really not the time to settle the scores.\nGu Ning looked over at Zhang Ji and stated in a cold voice, “Zhang Ji, mind your people.” After saying that, she continued to walk up the stairs. Zhang XiaoBai, Zhong Xu, and Fang Fa were not stupid, it’s just that they didn’t notice it immediately until they heard Gu Ning’s statement. Their expression was grim and solemn as they stared at Lu Qi and Zhou Yan. Although they couldn’t swallow the anger, they knew that now was not the time to settle it so they ignored them and followed Gu Ning for now.\nThe other teams glanced at Zhang Ji’s team with a subtle look. It was obvious that the spiritual ability user in Zhang Ji’s team had just conned the Third company team. Previously, there were rumours that Zhang Ji’s team had fought with the Third Company team when they first entered the base and it seem like someone was not happy with the results.\nZhang Ji’s expression was slightly darkened as his sharp gaze swept over Lu Qi and Zhou Yan with obvious anger on his face. Lu Qi opened her mouth and tried to explain but Zhang Ji ignored her and went straight up the stairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLu Qi gave Zhou Yan a resentful look, if she hadn’t begged so badly, she wouldn’t have made Zhang Ji angry and couldn’t help but push all the blame on Zhou Yan for causing all these troubles before hurriedly following the rest.\nAfter the incident, the journey to the roof was smooth, with only a few ordinary zombies stumbling by and all of which was cleanly taken care of by Gu Ning.\nThe closer they got, the more urgent Gu Ning’s felt so she increased her pace as she climbed the floors. Reaching closer to the rooftop, except for the Fang Fa who could keep up with her, the rest were all left behind by a large margin. However, the feeling of uneasiness was getting stronger in Gu Ning’s heart. All these while to the top, there was no trace of zombie attacks found on the path at all, and there were no corpses of zombies. It was way too clean as if no one had passed through here before, what did this even mean now? Gu Ning was getting a bit worried.\n“This Gu Ning, she isn’t a space ability user but a damn speed ability user, right?!” Yuan Ge lamented as he held onto the railing panting.\n“Is it possible that she is a space and speed ability user?” someone in his team chimed.\n“A dual abilities user? Never heard of it before. Plus you can see that she’s not extremely fast, so maybe she’s just physically fit.” After saying this, Yuan Ge also felt a little bit doubtful. Even he who had won the marathon championship back then and was physically fit was still incomparable to this freaky Gu Ning ah!\nGu Ning was unable to hear those comments as they were still struggling to climb up the thirty-fifth floor while she and Fang Fa had already reached the top.\nThe door to the top floor was still locked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGu Ning straight away used her knife to violently force open the lock, then pushed open the heavy iron door and walked out. As soon as Gu Ning walked out, she saw the helicopter parked in the centre and got very agitated. She quickly ran over after checking that there was nothing suspicious around it.\nAs she got closer, she noticed the helicopter had probably been under attack while it was still in the air. The whole fuselage was slightly dented and deformed as if it had been squeezed by a huge hand while the tail was broken, and the pilot of this helicopter must have very good piloting skills to land safely under such circumstances.\nGu Ning couldn’t suppress the nervousness in her heart as she approached and stepped on the pedals of the helicopter. When she found out that the helicopter was empty, Gu Ning was almost instantly relieved. She was really afraid that she would see someone familiar inside the helicopter when she got over. Gu Ning got into the cabin and examined it carefully. She was unable to find any documents or anything that might be a vaccine sample, but a backpack filled with all sorts of supplies was left at the side. It seems that they must have been in a great hurry when they left.\nGu Ning checked the cabin carefully once more before retreating and shaking her head at Fang Fa who was waiting outside, “There’s nothing.” Yet her mood was much lighter now. Whether it was Ji JiuZe, Yi ShaoQing, or Zhuang Chen, Gu Ning had great confidence in them as long as the helicopter didn’t crash. She believed that either one of them in this helicopter would definitely be able to find a way to escape, otherwise, there would be no way they had become the first squad.\nFang Fa was sensitive to the sudden change in Gu Ning’s mood but he was puzzled as Gu Ning looked very relieved when no man nor any vaccine documents were found. He didn’t think too deeply about it and while Gu Ning was checking the compartment, he also checked the surrounding: “There are traces of psychic battles over there, it should be that those people had encountered the mutant zombies and even a piece of the rail had been stripped off.” Fang Fa pointed in another direction before continuing: “There’s another door down there with another flight of stairs and I saw some of the green slimes which oozed out of that mutant zombie that we saw earlier. Plus there were also some damage on the wall caused by wind blades and other psychic powers. They should have probably gone down the passage from there. ”\nThis would fully explain why they didn’t see any traces along the way when they came up.\nWhile waiting for the rest of the team to reach the rooftop, Gu Ning took another look around the area, and just like what Fang Fa had stated, a very fierce battle seem to have broken out. Moreover, the rails had been completely destroyed and even a little further past that, a hole had been made through the wall. Gu Ning analysed those traces in the battle and they were made from wind, fire, and earth psychic powers. She remembered that Zhuang Chen was a wind ability user and wind psychic power belonged to the mutation lineage, which was slightly rare so it was likely that this wind ability user was indeed Zhuang Chen!\nGu Ning and Fang Fa waited for almost five to fifteen minutes before everyone arrived. Fang Fa then told the others what he had concluded with Gu Ning, and after hearing Fang Fa’s speculation, the others were deeply convinced.\nZhang Ji spoke up: “The mutant zombie we encountered earlier seemed to be badly injured so it’s most likely injured by those people on this helicopter. It seems that there was a very strong ability user on this helicopter who might have probably escaped with the documents already. ”\nSomeone sneered discontentedly: “Then we’ve made a trip for nothing?!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nZhong Xu mocked in reply: “Don’t worry, whether the documents are found or not, the supplies won’t be lessened for you.”\nThe person was immediately silent.\nConsidering that the others were physically exhausted, they took a small break in the roof for ten minutes. The rest were all paralyzed on the ground, even Cheng Ming, Zhang XiaoBai, and Zhong Xu were visibly exhausted. Zhang Ji found a place to sit down, then glanced over at Gu Ning with a feeling of complexity as she was still pacing around the area without any semblance of looking strained.\nAfter a short break, Fang Fa urged the team as they struggled to get up from the ground to follow Gu Ning down another passage.\nGu Ning was still leading the team and as Fang Fa had observed previously, there was plenty of green slime trailing down the stairs and some even smeared on the wall along the passage. There were also lots of cut marks made by the wind blades and corpses of zombies filled the stairs, stacked one on top of another. For the first time, Gu Ning examined the corpses very carefully while her eyes skimmed over the faces of all of them.\nIt took nearly an hour to get up to the roof but the descent was quicker. It was only when Gu Ning had returned to the ground floor after making sure that there were no familiar faces among those corpses that she finally put her mind at ease.\n\n(T/N: Sorry everyone for the long delay. Nero is getting better now but my job increased… signed contracts so had to focus on those projects first… So many unexpected events XD Anyway, Thank you everyone for reading and love you all!)\n\n"
