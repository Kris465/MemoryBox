“Well, since you’ve granted me a wish… I have one more wish.”
“What is it?”
“I would love to take a boat trip across the sea. Sometime before the engagement ceremony, because after the engagement I’ll be extremely busy. Be it tomorrow or the day after…”
“Then I’ll have it ready for us right away.”
“No.”
Rowena added quickly, tilting her head back and continuing in an honest tone.
“Not with you, Killian. With my son, Damian, and one other person who will row the boat.”
His hand gripping the reins tightened, and his knuckles began to whiten. Glancing at his hand sideways, Rowena gave him a sullen look.
“I wasn’t able to spend much time with my child because of the engagement preparations. Can’t I really go?”
“…….”
After a few moments of silence, the gentle permission was given.
“Do as you please. I’ll have the boat ready for you in advance.”
* * *
As preparations for the engagement ceremony were almost in their final stages, the invited guests began to fill the spacious villa one by one.
For Rowena, who was an orphan and had no relatives of her own, the countess self-assigned herself to the role of her mother.
The members of her salon, who were also invited to the engagement party, were happy to take on small tasks on behalf of the busy Rowena.
It was now the day before the engagement ceremony, and part of it was to make sure the dress and shoes were prepared for the day of the engagement party.
“All preparations are done; Miss Rowena is now ready.”
Joanne came out through the side door and bowed to the ladies who were waiting for Rowena.
The countess jumped up from her seat, her eyes sparkling.
“Hurry up and let me see it. I’m so curious, I can’t stand it.”
“Indeed, I can’t wait to see how beautiful it will look!”
As a few more expectant voices joined others, the door slowly slid open. Rowena, dressed in a pale apricot-coloured engagement dress, walked out of the dressing room holding Melissa’s hand to keep her steady. When Rowena lifted her face, which had been tilted down, she was flooded with compliments.
“I don’t see anything other than an angel!”
” Yeah! You look like you’re 18 all over again, Miss Rowena.”
“I can see why His Highness is so smitten.”
“This is so much for an engagement ceremony. At the actual wedding all the gentlemen will be dazzled by your beauty.”
“You flatter me too much.”
Laughing awkwardly at the embarrassing amount of praise, Rowena glanced over at Countess Rachel. Noticing her gaze, the countess rose to her feet and snapped all to attention.
“Now, now, that’s enough for the compliments. You are all in charge of the preparations for tomorrow night’s reception. Please do a final check on them.”
“What about you, Countess?”
“I’ll just help with the finishing touches and follow you.” , she said.
At her words, everyone left the salon excitedly. It was only then that the countess approached and sat down next to Rowena, who remained seated.
“You look very beautiful, Rowena. It’s not just empty words; I really mean it.”
“Thank you, it’s all thanks to you.”
“Oh my, what are you talking about~ I didn’t do anything.”
After sharing a light compliment, Rowena decided it was time to get straight to the point.

Rowena took a short breath before she continued.
“That reminds me, I’m going to take a brief boat trip tonight.”
“Will that be alright though, tomorrow is the long awaited engagement ceremony?”
The countess’ eyes widened at the unexpected words.
“Yeah, it’s fine~ Once we’re engaged, I’ll have to start preparing for the wedding again, so I’ll be very busy.”
“That’s true. You will be even more occupied than you are now. You will have to have an audience with His Majesty.”
Rowena smiled at the genuine answer.
“Would you like to go with me?”
“With you? That sounds lovely.”
The Countess nodded cheerfully.
“When are we going?”
“Around 9:30 maybe? I heard that the sea is so beautiful at night! The moonlight reflects off the sea making it sparkle.”
“A boating trip under the moonlight… It’s a bit unusual, still, it’s romantic in a way. But…”
“Countess?”
The Countess, nodding honestly, stopped talking as if she had just remembered something. Rowena, curious as to what she was about to say, inquired why, but the countess only alternated between looking at Joanne and Melissa silently.
“Joanne, Melissa. Can you step out for a minute?”
“As you order.”
After Rowena, who had quickly read the Countess’s mind, had dismissed them both, the Countess opened her mouth again.
“To be honest, I’ve tried to tell you many times.”
“What is that supposed to mean?”
“The duke’s late fiancée, who died in an accident.”
“…….”
Rowena froze in place at the mention of that person whom she had actively trying to forget existed in her head for a while. Unsure whether she should tell the story or not, the countess quickly confessed.
“It was all a cover up story, but there has been talk going around that His Majesty planned that accident eight years ago. I can only assume that you didn’t do that.”
“What do you mean? It wasn’t an accident!?”
It felt like someone had just dumped ice-cold water on top of the top of her head. Rowena was too startled that her mouth was agape, unable to close it. The Countess nodded and continued speaking in a serious voice.
“As you know, Rowena, yours and his excellency’s marriage is not only a normal marriage between families, but it is also related to the national interest. It is that significant, and so many people are involved. This was also the case for his late fiancée, who was chosen strictly after taking all aspects into consideration.”
“Then, why the accident ….”
“I heard that the ship that was operated by her family sank, which made her family’s business decline. As a result, the most likely story is that the value of this marriage was no longer worthwhile.”
“…….”
“After that, His Majesty arranged the duke’s previous marriage as well. I was debating whether or not to tell you, but I thought you should know.”
Rowena’s eyes dropped to the floor.
Suddenly, she was reminded of what the butler had said to her the other day. He said that Kilian had grown up without the love and affection that other people had naturally received growing up. She was in a state of confusion for a moment, but soon forgot about it. Whatever his past was, he is a man who has everything now. She was not someone who would dare to pity him, nor was he one who would appreciate such pity.
However, the story of the loss of his fiancée, and that it might have been in the hands of his aunt, the Queen was even more shocking than she had expected.
Rowena, who was at a loss for words and remained frozen for a while, raised her downcast head at the thought that quickly came to her mind.
“But how come I’m fine?”
“Rowena.”
“Why does His Majesty keep me still? I must have been an embarrassment and an eyesore for so long.” 
The silence fell over after the reasonable question. Just then, they were interrupted by a man who had just walked in.
“My lord has taken care of it.”

It was Jenok. Startled by the sudden interruption, the two women quickly turned around. Jenok bowed his head briefly, apologizing for startling them.
“Five years ago, you were in constant danger, Miss. When you were recognized as his excellency’s mistress, there was a vicious eye aimed at you at all times. His Majesty has a tail on you wherever you go.”
“I …”
Rowena blinked at the surprising revelation. Five years ago, when she was still his mistress, she had never once thought someone was targeting her.
“I didn’t know anything about this.”
“Of course you didn’t, Miss. That’s how thoroughly you were protected from the shadows.”
Jenok, who nodded as if he was stating the obvious, continued with a calm tone.
“Over the past five years, His Excellency has established a new force to ensure that he won’t be swayed any further to His Majesty’s whims. He battled alone, constantly traveling back and forth between foreign countries without a single day of proper sleep. Thus, he was able to obtain permission for this engagement.”
The countess, offended by his condescending manner of speaking, spoke up on Rowena’s behalf.
“Surely you don’t mean to say that His Excellency married another woman deliberately in an attempt to protect Rowena? Do you?”
It was a sharp accusation. After a pause, Jenok slowly shook his head.
“….. No.”
The Countess shot back at him with a plain expression.
“It was for His Excellency to gain more power and influence of his own. The fact that he left Miss Rowena to marry another woman and then got a divorce will never go away.”
Rowena looked at Countess Rachel with an astonished look. She knew she had been favored by her from the beginning, but she thought that she only had weighed her and Veronica against each other, and decided that being by her side has more value. Nevertheless, seeing now that she was even criticizing the duke’s action, and being so protective of her, Rowena was genuinely moved.
“I wasn’t trying to argue with the countess. I apologize to both of you if I have offended you in any way.”
With both palms up, Jenok displayed a giving up position and immediately dropped his sharp act. Rowena, who had been watching the nerve-wracking battle between the two, summarized the situation in her mind.
“By the way, why are you here?”
* * *
Jenok brought her to a large, desolate building. From a distance it seemed to be a stoned building with a unique structure, but once they entered, she was surprised to find that it was very spacious and had some classic looking interior.
At first impression, it looked like a place where rituals were held. There were statues at each corner shaped as armed knights standing like gatekeepers.
When she saw the large entrance leading to the basement, she knew it. This was a family mausoleum. In front of the entrance, a statue of an angel with one hand over its eyes, pointing downwards in mourning.
“This is …”
“The family mausoleum of the ducal family of Devonshire.”
“I understand His Excellency is here?”
She finally understood why he had held his wedding on this island before. Nodding at Rowena’s question, Jenok grabbed a lamp from the top of the altar facing the entrance.
“Please go downstairs.”
“You’re not joining us?”
“No one but a recognized member of the ducal family is allowed to enter.”
It was a place where even Jenok, who had been loyal to Killian for a long time, was forbidden to set foot. As she hesitated whether she could enter or not, Jenok held out a lamp to Rowena which she took in anxious anticipation. 
“You can go in a straight path down the stairs. The steps are not too high, so there is nothing to be concerned about.”
“Thank you…”
With pursed lips, Rowena gradually made her way down to the basement.
As she went down the last staircase, she saw a familiar figure standing before her.

“Killian?”
As she approached the cold stone wall, she saw him looking up at a statue in front of a tombstone. It was a statue of a young woman sitting with a downcast face. Rowena read the words inscribed on the marble beneath the statue.
“Herrace Monica Devonshire.”
“She was the sister of one of my predecessors. A great-aunt or something of that sort.”
The somewhat familiar name made Rowena look back at her memory, and suddenly she remembered what had happened at the duke’s Castle.
“I have seen a portrait of this person.”
It was the woman she saw when she walked through the corridors with Baron Benedict. He said she was forced to marry a foreign archduke while she had a lover back home.
“Though I heard it was quite a long time ago….”
Rowena muttered, comparing Lady Herrace’s grave to the tomb of the previous duke next to her.
Although they passed away at different points in time, the letters were engraved in the same style, and the statues were as similar to each other as if they were twins.
“They were commissioned by the same sculptor.”
As if reading her mind, Killian opened his mouth and said in a casual manner.
“This grave is empty.”
“Empty.. you said??” She asked.
“It’s because she hung herself in a foreign country when she went to get married. It was considered a disgrace for the family and a shame they wanted to be erased.”
Rowena listened to him quietly. She had known him and been by his side for not a short time, but this was the first time she had heard him talking about something so private.
“Both the portrait and this family tomb were placed here after the death of my predecessor, her brother. The previous duke felt sorry for her, so he ordered the construction of this place.”
His tone was nonchalant, as though he were talking about a distant family member rather than referring to his own grandfather and father.
“Your Excellency too?”
Rowena’s lips pursed sweetly as she stared at his somber profile.
“Do you feel sorry for her? Like your father?”
“Not at all.”
Killian’s eyes narrowed slightly at the word “father,” and he denied it flatly.
“My predecessor was right. She had tarnished the family name with her personal feelings and even made it bear a stigma that cannot be washed away.”
“…….”
“It’s pathetic to have ruined everything based on such useless sentiments.”
No, in fact, Herrace Devonshire was a courageous lady. She decided that rather than spend her life with a man she didn’t want, she decided to let go of this life without even spending a single moment of her life doing something that was unnecessary. In comparison, his father, who was messing around with an actress and had a carriage accident with her, was an even more pathetic human being. They could have committed suicide together before marrying, or they could have run away together the night before, abandoning everything. (Maximilian*)
Frederick Jenon Devonshire was a coward who dared neither to commit suicide with the woman he loved nor leave everything behind. So cowardly that he put the name of his mistress in the name of the son his wife had borne him.
While he scoffed at the two tombs one after the other, Rowena smiled bitterly at Killian Devonshire-esque words that flashed in her mind.
“What am I exactly standing here for, by the way?”
“You told me the other day.”
Killian, who had his gaze fixed on the statue, turned his head.
“You asked if I’ll grieve for you if you die someday in an unexpected accident.” (*reference ch 46.1)
“It’s a joke…”
She didn’t expect him to remember the words she had spoken, which he had decided to come halfway to. Perplexed, Rowena tried to make excuses, but he cut her off.
“Perhaps soon after, I will have another wife. Because the duchess’s position is not one that I can keep vacant for so long.”
It was not the sort of thing one would say to a woman about to be engaged. Was it too great of a dream to wish for his heart to be broken? Perhaps this man would not even blink if she disappeared. Rowena looked at him in silence. 
Killian’s lips pursed as he watched Rowena, who showed no anger or sadness, obsessively.
“But I promise you one thing..”

“But I promise you one thing. Here, the place right next to where I’ll be laid to rest will forever be yours, regardless of how long it will take.”
A chilling sensation invaded her whole being from head to toe. Her words brought her an eerie feeling, but it was worth saying that it was more memorable than any word ever came from his mouth. Grabbing Rowena’s arm as she backed away, Killian lifted her chin. Her blue eyes shone dangerously in the darkness.
“No matter what woman stands beside me, you will be the only one left in the end.”
“Killian…”
“Whether it is a hundred or two hundred years, in the end, we shall lie here side by side.”
It was an answer to her previous question and a terribly arrogant announcement. Her rapidly racing heartbeat seemed to pulse through her left chest and echo in her head.
Many young ladies would have blushed if they had heard the words, as it was a sad confession of love. Still, Rowena kept her eyes down, and instead of quietly embracing him, she pursed her lips.
“Then, what about your late fiancée?”
After all, his one true love was his deceased fiancée. She and his ex-wife were the replacements. He loved her so much to the point that he played two women.
“What are you talking about?”
Killian raised his eyebrows at the unexpected mention. He opened his mouth as if he was about to say something, but she interrupted him before he could do that.
Rowena, gently closing her eyes and opening them, continued to speak softly.
“Since you seem to remember what I said the other day quite well, I will ask you this again.”
“…….”
“Five years ago. Knowing all that you know, is there really nothing you would like to say to me?”
She heard about his life without having a single person he could trust. And the fact that he was there for her in his own way five years ago was peculiar on its own. That didn’t inspire her to forgive him, nor did she intend to.
Still, she wanted to hear him say he was sorry. I made a mistake. I misunderstood you. I’m sorry I didn’t trust you.
It was the natural thing for a human being to say. She had no idea how she left the island on that cruel night and how she had felt.
She figured if he said that, she wouldn’t be able to forgive him, but at least she would be able to understand him. That way, she herself would be able to disappear from his life in a clean manner and without any regrets, resentment, or lingering feelings left in her mind.
“Are you sure there isn’t?”
Rowena looked up at him in desperation. The chilling feeling that went over her moments ago was now replaced with a weird warmth, hot blood flowed backward from her toe to her head, and a numbing longing welled up in her.
Silence settled over the cool basement as she asked his question twice. The light from the flickering lamps, his face illuminated red in the light, was expressionless, undisturbed by anything she said.
After a few moments of silence, Killian nodded his head and said.
“I’ll compensate you.”
“….. what?”
“I will make sure you live in wealth, prosperity, and prestige for the rest of your life. To the point that poverty you’ve lived for in the past few years would only seem to be a dream.”
The moment she heard the reply, the blood in her body cooled down instantly. Rowena grew cold little by little, starting from the tips of her fingers; it was as if someone had stabbed her straight in the heart with a sharp, cold dagger made of freezing ice.
“Is there anything else you need?”
Anything that she needs?????
Her eyes twitched, and she burst into an empty laugh as if to let out a breath she had been holding back.
“Hah …… haha.”
What on earth had she expected?

For the high and mighty Killian Maximilian Devonshire, what had happened five years ago, it was as if a beggar had been hit by a carriage he was riding in. It was the coachman’s responsibility, but morally he was to pay for the medical treatment.
It wasn’t a case of misunderstanding or lack of communication. The man in front of her was as different from her in each and every way; they lived in a different environments and had very different backgrounds. Her way of thinking was different, her values were different, and her conscience and moral standards were different.
Trying to understand him was a foolish endeavor.
She could never understand him. Just as he could never understand her.
The realization was fleeting. Rowena confronted her heart, which was as desolate as a place where a typhoon had just hit.
Everything was the same as before. There was nothing… Nothing…
“Haah…….”
“Rowena.”
A large hand wrapped around her shoulder as Rowena’s legs relaxed, and she faltered.
Just as Killian, who had put all his force into his hand, was about to open his mouth again to say something, Rowena whispered with a drained complexion.
“I’m dizzy. I want to go up.”
It was an indirect rejection of his earlier proposal.
* * *
Rowena remained silent the whole way back to the villa. The same thing was true for Killian, who sat across from her. The mood inside the carriage was incredibly sharp; it was hard to believe that the man and woman were to be engaged tomorrow. The air was so tense contrary to the day when they had enjoyed a cozy dinner alone by the beach, that it made Jenok break out in a cold sweat just by watching them.
“I’ll skip dinner tonight. I don’t have much of an appetite, and I’m worried about getting an upset stomach since our engagement ceremony is tomorrow.”
“Do as you please.”
Killian answered coldly as he brushed past her.
Joanne and Melissa, who were waiting in the entrance hall, approached her with questioning looks on their faces, but Rowena left them behind and went up the stairs by herself without muttering a word.
“Mom!”
As soon as she opened the door with a twisted look on her face, Damian threw himself into her arms.
“Damian, did you hear everything your uncle said? Are you all prepared for tonight?”
“Yes! I’m ready!”
Nodding, Damian smiled brightly. As the dimple on his left cheek appeared, she recalled the face of the man who had a similar dimple to his left cheek as well, and her smile hardened, and Damian tilted his head.
“Mother?”
“…….”
“Mom, you’re hurting my shoulder.”
“…… Oh, sorry.”
Rowena looked down at her hand, which had tightened involuntarily around his shoulder and loosened it instantly. She then lowered her head and kissed Damian’s forehead.
“My dear son, you must have had a hard time learning to swim every night from your uncle up until now. If you swim well today, you don’t have to force yourself to swim anymore. I dragged you to a place you didn’t know, away from all of your friends. It must have been difficult for you.”
Her voice, which she tried to keep indifferent, began to crack a bit. Reaching out to her face with his skinny arms, Damian wiped Rowena’s cheek.
“I enjoyed it, Mother. So don’t cry.”
“Uh…… eh?’
Rowena blinked as she repeated what she was saying and felt hot liquid running down her eyes. Startled, she hurriedly wiped away her tears.

“I enjoyed it, Mother. So don’t cry.”
“Uh…… eh?’
Rowena blinked as she repeated what she was saying and felt hot liquid running down her eyes. Startled, she hurriedly wiped away her tears.
“Mom, I’ll do as you say from now on. So please don’t cry, okay?”
“This.”
It didn’t take long for the sorrow that filled her to transfer to her child, before she knew it, Damian was in tears too.
“No, Damian. I’m not crying because of you son.”
Normally, her son should have been showered with love and nurtured by his noble parents. She felt sorry and apologetic that he had to mature at such an early age, just because of the adults’ circumstances.
“Then why are you crying?”
“Because I’m so happy.”
“Happy?”
“Yeah. Because soon I’ll get to live with my son and my uncle.”
“…… just the three of us?”
“Yes. Just the three of us.”
Rowena smiled brightly, thinking his questioning words were to confirm what she said. Damian, who had hesitated at the smile, curled his lips and continued.
“But, Mom …….”
Rowena smiled, “Yeah?”
“….. no, nothing.”
Damian shook his head as he looked at Rowena, who wiped away her tears before long and had a cheerful expression on her face.
“Well, I’ll see you later, my treasure, my cotton candy. I love you.”
“Yes, mom. See you later. I love you too.”
Rowena finally excused herself and stood up after kissing Damian on both cheeks alternately. As she opened the door out of the child’s room, her eyes met those of one of the man waiting outside.
Her heart pounded in shock. The painter greeted Rowena, his face blank and his eyes kept blinking, with an embarrassed look on his face.
“I’m sorry. I heard you are here…”
“When did you get here?”
Rowena clenched her fists with wary eyes .
“Oh, I just got here.”
“I see…”
Her tensed shoulders loosened at the reply that followed, and the painter, who had turned his head in dramatic response, suddenly became interested across the room.
“By the way, this place is-..”
“You came looking for me for the painting, right?”
Rowena, uncharacteristically, interrupted the painter’s word and  turned his attention elsewhere.
“‘Ah, yes, I did.”
“You haven’t found the look you want for the painting yet?” She asked
“I’m ashamed to say it but yes..”
The painter mumbled a few words as his face was downcast with shame. The engagement ceremony is happening tomorrow. He was given the honor of being commissioned by the Duke himself and he had to respond to it, but he couldn’t capture the right expression to include in making the portrait. 
That had nothing to do with the portrait subject being ugly, that was definitely not the case! She was a mesmerizing woman, more beautiful than any other female opera singer he had ever drawn, and more than any famous actress in a foreign country he had ever seen
However, this fact alone made it rather difficult to finish the painting. The structure and beauty on the canvas were already all perfectly executed, and if he could only nail out the subject facial expression, perhaps this portrait would become a masterpiece that would remain for many years to come…. 
Despite being allowed to follow her around from time to time, Rowena rarely showed any expression which just increased the difficulty level of his task.

Rowena Philone. The woman who was known as the duke’s mistress was now in the seat of the duke’s betrothed, and has always been a graceful, elegant and cheerful person . She was always kind to people of lower status, and usually never spoke casually to other people, except for her two maids who remained at her side at all times to tend to her.
But no matter how brightly she smiled, something was missing. She was simply beautiful, like a beautiful woman in a portrait from a hundred years ago, and any liveliness or emotion was blurred out and not clearly visible.
“Well, I’m going on a boat trip tonight, will you come with me?”
“a boat trip?”
It was early summer, sunny with a cool breeze, it was definitely surprising to be on a boat at night, not in the daytime when the days were not so hot nor the sun shone brightly for most of the time. Rowena smiled thinly at the painter, who tilted his head.
“Yes, although I can’t ride with you. If you would like, would you like to come with me.”
“Of course, miss. What time do you want me to be there and where should I go?”
The painter, who nodded repeatedly, asked back. Rowena, after being silent for a moment, as if contemplating the question, answered quickly.
“Come to the main door at nine o’clock.”
* * *
At nine o’clock in the evening, the sun slipped over the horizon and the moon, which had raised its head instead, faintly illuminated the night sky.
It was dangerous, no matter how long they had spent preparing for it. Jeremy repeatedly emphasized his plan to the mother and their child.
“If I give the signal, you jump into the water and then both of you swim right to where I tell you to go. You can do that, right?”
“We can do it. Don’t worry too much, uncle.”
“Yes, I can do it. It will be fine!”
Rowena, holding Damien’s hand tightly, smiled at him.
Despite being a mother to a child, in Jeremy’s eyes, she was still his tiny, young niece. Jeremy sighed heavily as he looked at Rowena and Damian alternately with restless eyes.
“If anything goes wrong and something happens to you or Damian.. No, no it’s still too reckless. Forget about it, let’s not do it today… I’ll just think of some other way to get you both out of here safely.”
“Uncle.”
Rowena, smiling bitterly, called out to Jeremy who was speaking in a vulnerable voice that was unlike him.
“The engagement ceremony is happening tomorrow. It’s already too difficult to hide Damien’s true identity. Soon enough all opportunities will be gone. This is our first and probably last chance.”
“Rowena …”
“I don’t want to remain his fiancée and eventually become a duchess, no matter how prestigious and honorable the position may be.”
“Well, then, what about Damian, all what he could have?”
Jeremy, who was firmly preparing to escape, asked for the last time as if he were trying to find out.
“Title, property, and honor that your son deserves to have? Are you sure you’re confident you won’t come to regret it later?”
“Uncle …”
“If he knew Damian was his biological son, regardless if he was an illegitimate son, he would still adore his own flesh and blood.”
“No.”
Shaking her head resolutely, Rowena gently covered Damian’s ears with both hands.
“That man is not that kind of man. Even if one day he suddenly finds out he had a son, he would never believe it. No matter how hard you try to convince him, he is not capable of loving this child. Never.”
As she let go of the hope that she had held on to like a thread until the end, her resolve became even firmer. Jeremy smiled lightly, as if confirming her unwavering true intentions.
“Yes, that’s what I wanted to hear.”
“Uncle …”
“If you escape from the Duke safely, I have some people I want to introduce you to.”
“People who will introduce me to them?”
“Yes.. although I don’t know if it’ll turn out to be a blessing or a curse..”
It was the moment Rowena’s eyes fluttered, suspicious of Jeremy’s vague words. A knock followed, and Melissa’s voice interrupted from outside the door.
“Lady Rowena. We are ready to go out.”
Rowena, who exchanged glances with Jeremy with wistful eyes, pushed the hat down on Damian’s head.

As they descended the long staircase, they were greeted by a carriage waiting for them in front of the main entrance. Rowena helped Damian into the carriage, and before getting in, she turned to look back.
The bedroom, where she had thought the lights were out, was brightly lit. Rowena was facing the man looking down on them through the window.
The distance was not that close by any means, but his bright blue eyes shone like the eyes of a beast in the darkness.
“Lady Rowena?”
Rowena gazed up into those eyes . Melissa’s voice calling out to her, the neighing of the horses, and the clear, cool night air all disappeared. Everything in the vicinity faded away for a while, and the two of them were the only ones remaining.
They were the eyes she had once loved and desired so much. He was the man she had once longed and prayed for that he would only look at her. It was the face that her son looked just like when he was growing up.
The two pairs of eyes, locked on each other in what seemed like a tight tug of war, were interrupted by the sound of someone hurriedly approaching.
“Wait a minute! I’m coming too!”
“Mr. Painter?”
Melissa’s mouth opened wide in surprise.
“No way! Isn’t it enough that you follow her all day?? you want to follow her all night too?”
“Lady Rowena has allowed me to do this.”
The painter turned his head toward Rowena as if seeking her consent.
In a taut tug of war, Rowena was the first to let go and straightened her head.
“What he’s saying is true.”
“Lady Rowena …”
Melissa looked at Rowena with a sad face. She was the one who had refused to let her and Joanne accompany her to the trip. However, to offer the painter, whom she had known now for only a few months, to accompany her, made Melissa feel lonely, even though she knew she was not entitled to do so.
“Can’t I accompany you, too, pleasee?”
Melissa begged as she glanced at the painter, who sat next to Damian with hatred. For some reason, she was irritated by the strange feeling that she couldn’t just send her on her way.
“Even if I can’t go on the boat with you, I’ll just see you off. hmm? please?”
“No.”
Shaking her head, Rowena looked up fearlessly. The man who had been looking down at them with hawk eyes was gone. The curtains were closed and the lights were out.
Only after confirming this did Rowena finally close the carriage door.
“Five years ago, you betrayed me. Now, you want to follow me on this night? How can I trust you?”
“Lady Ro-..”
“Don’t you dare call my name.”
“Ah …… Ahhhhh.”
Melissa staggered as if she’d been struck by a thunderbolt and fall to her knees. Rowena looked down at her and sighed.
“As expected, I was right.”
“…….”
“Still, just in case I had to confirm.”
At first it was a small spark of suspicion. After learning that what happened five years ago was a plot by Benedict Sussex, a question suddenly popped into her head
Who was reporting her every move to Baron Sussex?
If it was not Gertrude.
It was Melissa who had turned her back on her hesitancy to meet the man William, and it was Melissa who had testified to her injustice. Although she doesn’t know why Killian didn’t tell her that part.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry …!”
Melissa pleaded, grabbing the hem of her skirt as her shoulders quivered.
“I’m so sorry … I really didn’t want to do it. Please forgive me.”
There was a heavy silence. Rowena reached out her hand to the panting Melissa.

“My lady…?”
“Forgive me.” Taking her hand in hers and helping her to her feet, Rowena continued speaking with a blank expression on her face. “You, too, must have your own reasons. For no one acts without a reason, and you weren’t such a bad person either.”
“My-.. my lady.” Melissa burst into tears as she sensed a faint glimmer of hope. “So then, ……”
“So I can hate you too as per my own reasons― aside from forgiveness, because these are my feelings.” As refreshing as this felt, she was now exhausted! She no longer wanted to try to understand, forgive, or accommodate anyone.
Not allowing Melissa to accompany her to this trip and not showing her everything that will transpire tonight was the least bit of consideration she will show; given to the fact that she was still a young woman who was yet to be married. After tonight, Melissa would probably be tormented by guilt for a long time, but that part was none of her business.
“Don’t follow me, don’t you dare call my name. Stay out of my sight for as long as you live, Melissa Brown.”
Melissa’s face was pale as a white sheet of paper, as Rowena turned her back on her for the very last time.
As soon as the carriage door slammed shut, the coachman immediately swung his whip. Melissa, completely stunned, fell down straight to the dirt.
***
Soon after, the carriage arrived at its destination. Once on the shore, a servant who had been notified of their arrival guided them to the boat. Jeremy, having been waiting for them beforehand, took over for the boatman and got on board first, then took Damian and Rowena’s hands in his and helped them on board. 
“Can’t I come on board too?” The painter, who was watching the scene with a somewhat nervous heart, suddenly asked.
“No, you can’t do that. This is all I promised you.”
Rowena declined his request at once, and the boat started to sail away. Two servants pushed the boat along with the current as it gradually drifted away. 
“Lady Rowena!”
The painter shouted at the boat when he thought he could no longer see her face. 
“Please look at this side and smile just once!”
Upon the request, Rowena slowly tilted her head toward the sandy beach. 
The moment his eyes met hers under the faint moonlight, the painter took a deep breath. An electric current ran sharply from his head to his toes. Simultaneously, a flood of inspiration that had been blocked for some time flooded him like a dam, and made every vein in his body hot and feverish. 
The excited painter hastened to the servant who stood next to him.
“Canvas! Bring me my canvas from the carriage Nowwww!!”
The wind, which had been calm until they arrived here, was getting stronger and stronger. Normally, his sharp instincts would have alerted him to the unusual atmosphere, but with the overflowing inspiration as if it’s a bursting dam, the painter grabbed his brush instead of calling out for people.
* * *
Tommy tried to steady his his shaky breath as he stood in front of the large bedroom door. The note in his hand was already long since drenched in sweat.
-Just take this to him once the bell rings, announcing 9:30
-At night?
Rowena just smiled at Tommy as he asked.
-Just bring it to him and he’ll understand. 
Hesitating, Tommy slowly knocked on the door.

For a few moments that felt like an eternity, there was no sign of anything, so he turned to leave, thinking that he was asleep. When the door slid open without a sound, a man with hollow eyes looked down at the boy.
“What is it?”
The lights were indeed out, but this was not the face of a man who had just woken up from sleep, but a face that has been sleep deprived for a long time. The way he looked at in the dim light was horrifying, as though his hollowed cheeks and piercing eyes were those of a wild beast that was hibernating in a cave. Tommy felt as if he were a rabbit standing in front of some predator. 
Once again, he was reminded that the man in front of me was a man whom the people of the island, including his father, had nothing but envy, respected and worshiped like a god.
While Tommy was frozen in place, unable to move due to the stifling intimidation, Killian, his brow furrowed, spotted the note that Tommy was holding tightly in his small hands. Only then did Tommy finally realize what was happening, he stood firmly and stammered..
“This, this, Lady Rowena told me to take it and give it to you…”
He bent over as if his back was broken and lifted the note with both hands together. Killian, reached out for the note while brushing away his disheveled hair. The content of the note was brief and clear.
[I wish I could turn back time]
He stomped after reading the first word.
The moment he crumpled the note mercilessly, Melissa came running in, screaming and crying.
“My Lord! It’s Lady Rowena! The young master!” 
* * *
“The sea swallowed the ship in an instant. I waved from afar, and then ah…! Why did she board so early …… If she waited until I came… No, if I came and stopped her…!” Countess Rachel wailed as she sank down onto the white sandy beach. 
Her two maids dutifully stood next to their red-faced, practically breathless hostess, who was gasping for air. They tried to support her, but the countess shook her head and grabbed the hem of Killian’s trousers as he stared out at the sea with a murderous look on his face.
“Rowena must be alive. Isn’t she? If we send some people to look fo-.”
“Countess.”
A bride who was swallowed by the sea just one day before her engagement. The guests and local islanders who crowded the sandy beach lowered their heads with sorrowful faces. 
The situation was one in which they could not release searching parties even if they wanted to. By the time Rowena was far away on the boat, the wind had grown wild and the weather worsened, as if it were a joke to say that the weather was clear just a few moments earlier.
Waves were crashing violently as if they were about to engulf the whole island. Adding to the tragedy, the rain which began to fall was accompanied by lighting and thunderstorms. Jenok, who choked back his breath, interrupted.
“I think everyone should go back in. If you were caught in the middle of the storm, you could not guarantee your life.”
The wind was so intense that it was almost impossible to stand up properly. As the regents, starting with the countess, let the servants lead people one by one into the villa, Killian turned around. On seeing where he was headed, Jenock threw himself in front of him and blocked his way.

The wind was so intense that it was almost impossible to stand up properly. As the regents, starting with the countess, let the servants lead people one by one into the villa, Killian turned around. On seeing where he was headed, Jenock threw himself in front of him and blocked his way.
“No!”
“Move aside.”
It was a gut-wrenching voice. But he could not retreat!
“Please calm down! If you go in now, even you, my lord will be in serious danger!
“Can’t you hear me telling you to get out of the way?”
Killian’s eyes squinted, warning for a second time, which was rare but still happened, but never a third time and Jenok didn’t budge despite knowing this! 
Tsk, Killian clicked his tongue, and he pulled out a gun, however, even at the moment the muzzle of the gun brushed against his forehead, Jenok didn’t flutter.
“Absolutely not. I would rather you shoot me and go.”
“…….”
“As soon as the weather clears up a bit, I will release the searching parties, jumpping into the sea now, in this condition, would be nothing short of suicide!”
The wind and rain were getting worse and worse. Desperate pleading voices rang out the echoed dimly like a mist of water, disobeying orders. Then, Killian, soaked from head to toe, slowly pulled the trigger. 
At that moment, a yell echoed through the place
“I see a ship!”
One of the servants, who was searching along the ridgeline of the beach just to be sure, hastily shouted. As soon as the delighted Jenok turned back around, Killian ran past him. 
This was a man who never ran, even in the many moments when his life was in danger from collisions with the port’s organization.  Jenok, who had been watching his master running like a mad man, also followed him hurriedly.
* * *
The ship that was found that day was deserted. Rowena and Damian were never found. The engagement was canceled due to the tragic accident, and the guests returned with somber faces. 
Time passed uneventfully, and the seasons changed twice again. Between the passing of summer, autumn, the island was peaceful, but when winter comes, it is as if the island is swallowed by a rainstorm and a blustery windstorm and a threatening wave.
Unlike the warm, sunny weather, the entire island had a funeral atmosphere going on.
After that incident, all that remained was the silent atmosphere of the island and the air of the villa that seemed as if it would crack at any moment. Killian would board the boat every morning through the fog and continue his search until nightfall. He was wandering through the vast sea like a man who never felt any kind of fatigue, and the sight of him was madness itself. 
“I think it’s time for you to go back to the mainland. Your Excellency.” Jenok, who could not bear to see his lord growing thinner by the day, uttered with a heavy heart.
Instead of a reply, a grim gaze fell upon him– Facing those icy blue eyes, Jenok felt like he was confronted by a beast licking his wounds in a deep, dark cave.
A chilling dread penetrated through his skin. But he could not hold back any longer. Swallowing a gulp, Jenok summoned up all the courage he could muster and allowed his lips to run loose.
“It’s been six months now, You have been away from your position for a long time. So far I have managed to handle some business while traveling back and forth between the mainland and here, but more and more business is piling up and some that your Excellency needs to see things in person. In addition, there are also moves of treason in foreign countries….”
As he continued his discourse, Jenok’s nose was blocked by the smell of strong alcohol. The smell of alcohol was so strong that even he, who had become somewhat immune to all kinds of odors, frowned at it, and it seeped all over the office. However, despite drinking three bottles of strong scotch one after the other all night alone, Killian kept a clear face. –Then, a shocking question popped up unexpectedly for Jenok, who was waiting for Killian to lash out.
“What’s the possibility that she ran away?”
“Your Excellency?”
“We haven’t found any bodies yet– And even the teacher who rode with them is nowhere to be found either.”
With a somber look on his face, Jenok squeezed his eyes shut. He had to reiterate the words he had repeated so many times by this point.

“After examining the boat, it appears that the boat was knocked over by the sudden storm, just as the Countess testified. We also found evidence of an attempt to climb into the boat….
And above all…”
Jenok took a deep breath before finally concluded his statement
“The young master was with her….”
Although it could be different if she was alone, Rowena Philone was not a woman to take such a risky decision when she was taking her son along, whom she valued more than her own life.
Crash. Instead of answering, Killian, who poured the rest of his liquor down his throat, threw the glass he was holding straight into the wall. Jenok, glancing at the shattered pieces that could never be put up again, stammered but continued his speech. 
“A long time has passed already. We have mobilized all the fishermen and young men to carry on the rescue efforts, but the fact that they haven’t found anything yet…”
“No.”
Jolting up from the couch, Killian, bloodshot eyed, pulled something out of his chest pocket.
“The woman couldn’t be dead.”
“…….”
What he pulled out was none other than the note from Rowena, which had been delivered to him by the son of the regent.
[I wish I could turn back time]
What did she mean? He glanced at the note with bloodshot eyes, remembering the woman who looked up at him boldly in the underground mausoleum. 
No, this was not the only face he remembered.
Rowena, who was eating on the sandy beach with an innocent expression on her face. Rowena, who looked out over the calm night sea, looking at the island with a detached expression on her face. Rowena, who sat gracefully in a chair under an elm tree as the painter was working on her portrait. Rowena, who revealed some of her true feelings behind that hard shell, even if it was for a little bit, to the engagement announcement  during the fox hunting season.
Dozens of times, hundreds of times, the face of the woman who laughed, raged, and grieved before him overlapped and scattered.
And his son, whose name he had never called once… In fact, he tried to call his name aloud few times but only a muffled sound flowed out, as if someone was strangling him. Jenok approached Killian, who, unknowingly gripped his neck with both hands with a clouded look on his face.
“My Lo-..”
“She must be hiding somewhere very thoroughly. She must be hiding somewhere and mocking me.”
“…….”
Jenok clenched his sweat-soaked fists. He was in no condition to talk. His master who accepted only the evidence and the truth was, for the first time, refusing to listen to reason in all its forms. 
On the surface, he acted no differently than he had half a year ago, only a little more wild and unhinged, but like a cold, beautiful marble statue, he was crumbling… He was slowly crumbling from the corners away from clear sight.
Jenok’s shriveled shoulders drooped as his voice was suffocatingly cold, and he mouthed it over and over again.
“…… there’s one thing I want to show you.”
“What is it?”
“The painter.. who was commissioned to paint a portrait of Ms. Rowena the other day. He said it was just completed yesterday.”
Killian, narrowing his brows as if recalling a memory for a while, shock his head. Jenok let the painter in, who was waiting behind the door. Following the painter, who greeted him politely, two servants entered. They were carefully holding up a large portrait that was covered with a white cloth. 
“Open it.”
“Yes.”
The painter instructed at the look in Jenok’s eyes – the two servants then, bowed silently and removed the white cloth. 
As his eyes locked with the woman in the portrait, Killian took an involuntary step forward. Feeling as if he might burn the painting at any moment, the painter turned to Jenok with a white face and asked him to help in silence. Jenok stepped up behind Killian and cautiously called out to him.

As he approached behind Killian, Jenok cautiously called out to him.
“…… Your Excellency?”
The sounds dissipated pointlessly into thin air. Killian’s blue gaze was locked on the woman smiling at him. 
She was familiar, but she was a stranger. Her eyes were plastered with red makeup and her lips were a bright crimson color. This wasn’t Rowena; she didn’t wear heavy makeup like that unless it was absolutely necessary. 
Her face appeared so vivid that even with his eyes closed, it seemed to be right in front of him. A round, small forehead, thin, elegant eyebrows that were slightly arched, long, delicate lashes that fluttered like butterflies, green eyes that sparkled like midsummer’s fresh greenery, soft blond hair that glistened as if it had been woven from skeins of gold.
He wanted to tear the portrait of this strange woman to shreds, but he couldn’t move an inch as her face smiled back at him.
A smile that seemed almost relieved, as if she had let go of everything and was going somewhere aloof and solemn.
“Lady Rowena was very beautiful and graceful, but I always felt that something was missing. It was as if I was looking at an illusion that didn’t exist, a well-dressed, well-decorated doll in someone else’s hands. So I agonized and agonized for a long time on how to paint her. I am a painter, after all, I paint people, ugly or beautiful, not a painter of beautiful dolls.”
The painter cautiously explained his opinion to the two men who were looking at his work with fascination.
“But that day…… When I saw her, it was as if a thunderbolt had struck my head and all my doubts were resolved, and at the same time I wanted to pick up the brush I had laid down. I didn’t even know I had such an intense desire left in me.”
“……So.”
After he stared at the portrait for a while, a hoarse voice broke through the silence and asked Killian.
“…What do you think?” There was so much in that short question.
“I don’t know if I should really say this, but…….”
 The painter cleared his throat and continued slowly.
“I’m an atheist, but at that moment, Lady Rowena looked like goddess Harmenia of Crotia, the goddess of life, and I felt her energy more dynamic and lively than any other.” 
Tearing his eyes away from the portrait, Killian slowly shifted his gaze toward the painter. It was a gesture for him to explain further.
“The goddess Harmenia is the goddess who, when the time comes, incinerates herself to be reborn. She would revive the earth with her flesh and blood, allowing it to be nurtured and grow again, and when it’s at its most beautiful, she would sacrifice herself again for the sake of living beings.”
“…….”
“According to Croatian scriptures, Goddess Harmenia is the goddess of eternal purity, virtue, sacrifice, and symbolizes the circle of life. She represents absolutely everything. Therefore, she’s also known as…….”
Looking proudly at his masterpiece, the painter straightened his shoulders and said.
“Another beginning.”

“Mom!”
Damian called out to Rowena from the snow-covered field, where he was riding his pony. Rowena, who was walking along the fence, turned her head toward her son.
“Damian!”
Even though she was far away, she instantly caught sight of her son’s face. Half a year ago, his expression that had been shy and reserved, now looked bright and cheerful. 
Damian was smart and a cheerful child, just like her. Even in a foreign country where he didn’t speak the tongue of it, he quickly picked up the language and now could converse with the mansion’s servants without hesitation.
As Rowena watched with delight as Damian learned how to ride a pony, someone came up to her and put a hand on her shoulder. Smiling at the familiar scent, Rowena turned.
“Lauren.”
“Diana.”
The gentle-looking lady was the wife of Viscount Senneth, lord of the province of Crotia, to which the two mother and child were indebted. 
Rowena recalled the first time she had met the woman standing before her. It was directly after their escape from the Loops island. It had all started with Jeremy’s plan.
―It turns out, Loops Island gets hit by a typhoon once every three to four years, but it’s in the off-season, and it’s so rare that only the old fishermen know about it. I researched all the weather records for the last ten years and came up with a statistic. I am yet to be certain of its exact date, but somewhere between June and July. 
―So what am I supposed to do?
―We need to arrange for someone to ‘witness’ our accident, we get on a boat and head out to sea just before the weather gets really bad, and when I give the signal, we’ll all jump into the water.
It was a risky plan –At first, Rowena was adamantly against it. There was no way she was going to put Damian at risk! and for the first time, there was a fierce argument between her and Jeremy.
―This is our only chance! It’s now or never!
―Still !!!
―Rowena, I beg you to reconsider! you’ll be a puppet by the Duke’s side for the rest of your life, and so will Damian be.
―…….
―What do you think he’ll do when he finds out you’ve been hiding the fact that Damian was his biological son all this time?
Jeremy looked like he wasn’t going to take no for an answer. When he saw Rowena’s eyes waver, he turned her to face him.
―You have to take some risks in order to start a new life, and Damian is not as weak as you think.
If Jeremy hadn’t been an exceptional swimmer since his youth, she would never have accepted it if he hadn’t persuaded her to the end.
It was something they’d been preparing for for a long time, but as expected it was dangerous and difficult to swim against the rough waves. However, with Jeremy holding Damian’s hand and guiding him, they were able to reach their destination with no issues.
With Jeremy’s help, they boarded a stranger’s boat and stayed in a warehouse on the other side of the island for a day. Taking advantage of the distraction happening offshore, the three escaped Loops Island by hiding in empty liquor barrels. They parted ways with Jeremy just before boarding a smuggling ship headed for foreign shores.
―This is it.
―Uncle…….
―We’ll stand out too much if the three of us move together, and I have some unfinished business to tend to, so I can’t leave.
Rowena nodded with tearful eyes. Jeremy looked at his niece affectionately and pressed a quick kiss to her forehead.
―Write to me anytime. Under the pseudonym ‘Diana’ at the inn I told you about. Okay?
The goodbye was brief, and Rowena climbed aboard the smuggling ship with an exhausted Damian in her arms. The suffocating tension finally eased once the ship was on the move.
―Don’t wander around or talk unless it’s absolutely necessary. Understood, Damian?
―Until when? 
―Just until the ship reaches the port. It’ll take around five days before we get there.
Fortunately, Killian’s hand hadn’t reached the small port of a rural area, and they made it safely to the province of Crotia.

Rowena had barely stepped off the ship and headed to the appointed meeting point when a woman ran up to her and hugged her tightly. Startled by the sudden contact, Rowena pushed her away, only to hear the woman’s tea―rful voice in her ear.
―Angela…
The older woman who hugged her was none other than the Viscountess Senneth. 
―You’re mistaken, I’m not Angela.
―Forgive me dear, you just look too much like my niece.. Ah I’m Lauren by the way.
The Viscountess, who looked at Rowena with tears in her eyes, had welcomed them wholeheartedly from the very beginning. 
She was originally from Ethelwood, but had spent decades living abroad after she got married a foreign noble, and was now a widow, after losing her husband several years ago, and now running her estate by herself.
Beside her deep knowledge of fine arts and generous patronage of Jeremy, Lauren was also warm-hearted and everyone who knew her was fond of her. The same was true for Rowena and Damian. 
Lauren graciously opened up her home and offered her spacious guest room to the both mother and son and provided them with food, clothing, and shelter without asking for anything in return. In addition, she even provided her full support for Rowena’s writing.
“I’m sorry, I’m indebted to you ever since the beginning.”
“Don’t say that. I’m honored to have the niece of one of my favorite authors, Jeremy Dish, in my home.”
Lauren was a generous person who accepted Rowena into her mansion without asking any questions, even if it was a request from her favorite author, this wasn’t a request so many people would accept. Lauren believed without a shred of doubt the story that her child’s father had died early and that she had fled to avoid the creditors who were demanding her to pay his gambling debts.
Not only that, but the people at the mansion believed Rowena’s story without a doubt. This was due to Lauren’s interest in managing her vast estate and farm, and partially to the fact that this was a very small country, and even within it, the rural areas were far from the reach of distant foreign countries’ social circles.
She lowered her eyes in guilt, and Rowena promised.
“I will definitely repay you for this kindness, I mean it.”
“Why act so distant, aren’t we family now? It’s already been half a year.”
Lauren looked over at Rowena lovingly and waved loudly at Damien as he rode around the grassy field on his pony, and after ensuring that the coachman had a hold of the reins to avoid any accidents, she walked back with Rowena toward the villa.
“Oh, right. How is the novel you’ve been writing? Are you going to finish it up soon?”
“Yeah. I’m getting close to finishing it. I think I’ll wrap it up soon.”
The novel she was writing was the very work she had intended to publish five years earlier. Back then it was the only hope, and, perhaps ironically, was the trigger for everything that happened after. She was determined to get rid of it once Killian found out about everything. But every time she tried to put it in the fireplace again and again, she could never quite bring herself to do it. 
She recalled Jeremy’s advice to her that this novel could be her new starting point.
―Writing is not a sin. Rowena. 
―But…
―Maybe by finishing it, you can bring closure to your past. 
It was only for a moment that she was lost in thought when Lauren’s words brought Rowena out of her thoughts.
“I am really looking forward to it, don’t forget you promised to show it to me first.”
“I’m embarrassed because it’s not good enough. It’s my first novel.”
“I heard you’ve been writing it for a long time, I’m sure you wrote it well.”
“Thank you, Lauren.”

When the two returned to the mansion while engaged in a lively conversation, they were met by someone waiting for them. He was a tall, slender young gentleman.
“Oh, Cedric!”
Lauren’s complexion brightened as soon as she laid eyes on the familiar back figure, and she approached the man at a quick pace. Meanwhile, the man who heard Lauren approaching turned around and his eyes met Rowena’s gaze. 
He was a gentle-looking, handsome man with curly platinum blonde hair and purple eyes. While Rowena, surprised by the unexpected visitor, froze, the man called Cedric opened his eyes wide– His face looked as if he had seen a ghost.
Rowena tilted her head, and Lauren kept pacing toward the man, shortening the distance between them.
“I’m surprised. How could you just show up unannounced?”
“Sister.”
Lauren pinched her brother’s cheeks and with a broad smile turned to introduce him to Rowena.
“Diana, this is Cedric Godwell, my youngest brother. He has no interest in business and just spends most of his time in faraway foreign lands studying insects.”
“Oh…….”
Rowena smiled faintly, realizing the relationship between the two. Lauren went on to introduce Rowena to her younger brother.
“Cedric. This is Diana, she’s the niece of the author Jeremy Dish”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Madam.”
Cedric took off his hat and stepped closer to Rowena, whose eyes widened a bit in surprise. Rowena, taken aback by his stride, took several steps back, but he just came that much closer and stopped, leaning as her stared down at her face.
“… Mr. Godwell?” 
Rowena, frozen like a butterfly caught in a pin, pursed her lips as she asked. His gaze was not odd enough to be flirtatious, nor did it show any sign of sexual desires whatsoever. Instead, it was a gaze filled with curiosity and a thirst for the unknown, as if he had discovered a peculiar object worthy of study. 
“Cedric!”
Rowena’s face turned bright red while Lauren, who had approached her, gave her brother a big smack on his broad back.
“It’s not polite to stare at people so intensely like this!”
* * *
Beginning with their strange first encounter, Cedric Godwell stayed at the mansion with them over the next ten days. As the mansion was quite large and had many rooms considering it was in the countryside, Rowena tried as much as possible not to pay attention to the newest guests staying there. 
But the more she tried to ignore him, the more Cedric drew a little closer. At every meal where everyone gathered, Rowena had to somehow compose herself to avoid getting an upset stomach due to his starting. True, he didn’t talk to her in particular, nor did he approach her without hesitation like that time but he just kept staring at her. Like a scientist who had discovered a new research topic. 
Lauren, standing in the middle of the room, took notice of Rowena’s expression and decided to subtly bring up the topic.
“I’m sorry, Diana. Cedric is making you uncomfortable, isn’t he?”
“Not at all. I am the one freeloading off– he’s a part of your family, of course he can stay as long as he wants.”
She was forcing a smile, but the shadows under her eyes were clear. Lauren sighed and shook her head.
“I really don’t know what’s wrong with him, he’s never been like this before, he’s never shown any interest in anything since he was a kid, which worries me.”

Cedric Godwell was the youngest of three siblings, and the age gap between them was almost as great as that between a parent and child so he was pampered and doted on dearly. 
“He was a bit of an…… oddball, but he had a very good head on his shoulders, and he never forgot anything once he saw it. But one day, they became interested in birds and decided to pursue a doctorate in the related field, and was appointed as an associate professor at a foreign university, much to the disapproval of my father, who expected him to help him and my brother run the family business, this incident actually shattered our father’s expectations deeply” 
“Oh..” Rowena listened attentively to the deep affection underlying Lauren’s grumbling words.
“My family was very much against it, to the point where they threatened to cut him off all the support they had been giving him so far.”
“But, did he end up becoming a professor? Or did he give up?”
“That’s the thing..”
Lauren waved her hands in the air as she let out a deep sigh. 
“He went ahead and made a fortune from his self-published academic book, then proceeded to not follow the family’s wishes and even ditched his job as a professor! This time he’s into minerals– not just gemstones and geology, but all sorts of minerals, whatever that means.”
“…….”
“He got his master’s degree again in a year and is now preparing to get his doctorate.”
He was what you might call a “genius,” albeit a somewhat unpredictable and fickle one. After a moment of stunned silence, Rowena blurted out.
“Didn’t you just say he’s thirty-two? That’s amazing.”
“Amazing how? By this age he’s supposed to be married and starting a family, yet he’s still acting like a kid.”
Lauren shrugged, and although she put it out like that, she was clearly proud of him. 
“I mean, I have a problem with weird research obsessions he has going on, but my biggest worry is what will happen if he keeps sticking to this habit, wouldn’t that drive him crazy eventually? Also, I wonder when he’s finally going to get married and give me a nephew as cute as Damien. He’s such a nerd.” She said as she clicked her tongue in a subtle manner. 
“Mom!”
Lauren’s rant was about to get even longer when a cute little interruption came running up to them.
“Damian. Did you finish the homework Mommy gave you?”
“Yeah, I’m done! By the way, can I ride the pony to the mine with Mr. Cedric today?”
“What?”
The sudden words made both women look at each other almost simultaneously. As they turned to look into the child’s wide sparkling eyes, a low voice came from a distance. 
“He said he hadn’t been anywhere but the farms around the manor since he came here.”
Rowena slowly lifted her head, her eyes meeting Cedric’s piercing gaze. Cedric, patting Damian’s head as he came closer to her, smiled at her and continued.
“I think it’ll take about half a day.”
His tone was soft, but his eyes sparkled like a cat standing before a fish. She felt the hairs on her back prickle with a strange sensation but not in a good way. Ominously, Rowena looked at Damien and shook her head firmly. 
“No.”
“No? Why?”
“It’s dangerous.”
Even if they were in the middle of nowhere and there was no way they’d be recognized, she couldn’t allow herself to send him off somewhere with a random stranger.
“But Mom! Cedric’s coming with me!”
Damian’s mouth dropped open and his face fell.
“I said no.”
“Mom!”
She was about to open her mouth to scold the whimpering Damian when Cedric, eyes narrowed, interrupted. 
“You’re being overprotective.”
“……What?” Rowena doubted her ears.
The next words were even worse. Cedric added, as he wrinkled his nose.
“You look like a hen in heat.”
“…….”
It felt like someone had poured cold water on her head. The atmosphere froze, and just as Lauren was about to jump to her feet and lecture Cedric, Rowena, one step ahead of her, slapped him on the face.
