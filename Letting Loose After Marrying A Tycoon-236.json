Du Tingting\u2019s eyes were red as tears streamed down her face.\n \u201cI feel that if we have this child, it will be like a betrayal to Qiu-er.\u201d Thinking of Mu Qiu suffering all alone in the hospital, Du Tingting just couldn\u2019t feel any joy. Her heart clenched with pain.\n \u201cIf we have it, Qiu-er will feel like we have abandoned her. If she knows I am pregnant, she will lose all will to live. Hubby, we cannot be so cruel to Qiu-er.\u201d\n Mu Mian also felt very distressed. He hugged Du Tingting as he clenched his fists and swore. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Qiu-er will live! The baby in your tummy will also live!\u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s crying suddenly halted.\n Mu Mian thought his comforting words had worked. Just when he was about to heave a sigh of relief, Du Tingting suddenly spoke. \u201cI saw the organ compatibility test results in your safe today.\u201d\n Mu Mian went stiff.\n Du Tingting pushed Mu Mian\u2019s hands aside and gazed up at the man with teary eyes.\n Taking a deep breath, Du Tingting gathered up her courage and asked him, \u201cYou took a sample of Song Fei\u2019s blood and compared it with Qiu-er\u2019s. You...\u201d Du Tingting\u2019s voice was trembling. \u201cAre you planning to kill Song Fei so you can take her heart to save Qiu-er?!\u201d\n Mu Mian averted his eyes. He kept silent, but his face had paled considerably.\n Du Tingting said in a pained voice, \u201cThat is Song Song\u2019s biological sister! Mu Mian, how can you kill someone else\u2019s daughter to save our own? How can you be so vicious?\u201d\n Mu Mian tried to argue, \u201cBut she is in a vegetative state!\u201d\n Du Tingting clutched at her own heart and shook her head bitterly. \u201cVegetative state? But she woke up! If not for Song Fei suddenly disappearing, you were going to take her heart for Qiu-er, weren\u2019t you?!\u201d\n Faced with Du Tingting\u2019s interrogation, Mu Mian\u2019s lips felt like someone had sewn them shut. He couldn\u2019t open them at all.\n Du Tingting knew very well what his silence meant.\n Du Tingting looked at Mu Mian as if she was staring at a stranger.\n She retreated clumsily and fell back on the bed. Lowering her head, she tugged hard at her hair. She muttered, \u201cHow could you be such a person? How could you?\u201d\n \u201cThe kind-hearted Mu Mian whom I once knew. Where is he?\u201d\n Du Tingting lifted her head to stare at Mu Mian.\n Mu Mian was already frozen in place and his heart bled as he heard Du Tingting\u2019s accusations. He felt guilty, but at the same time, he also had no regrets. Nevertheless, he felt very terrible and ashamed that Du Tingting had to witness this cruel side to him.\n \u201cSong Fei is Song Song\u2019s elder sister.\u201d Tears streamed down Du Tingting\u2019s cheeks. \u201cMu Mian, don\u2019t you feel uneasy at all facing Song Song every day? Every time she asks you about Song Fei\u2019s whereabouts, how did you manage to answer her with such a calm expression?\u201d\n \u201cMu Mian, don\u2019t you have any regrets?\u201d\n The innocent and na\u00efve Du Tingting never even thought of the possibility that Mu Mian could also be targeting Song Ci, whom she treated as her daughter. She was also just an organ host that Mu Mian had prepared for Mu Qiu.\n Du Tingting broke down when she saw that Mu Mian kept silent. She picked up the box of cakes and flung it at Mu Mian. \u201cSpeak up!\u201d\n The box was very light, and it didn\u2019t hurt Mu Mian at all. One of the coconut balls rolled out and left a stain on his face.\n Mu Mian gazed at the coconut balls scattered all over the floor. He remained quiet for a long, long time...\n After a long while, a raspy, despondent voice finally came out of Mu Mian\u2019s lips. \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d\n Du Tingting looked up and stared at Mu Mian. She didn\u2019t say a word.\n Lowering his head, Mu Mian stared back at Du Tingting.\n Pain and fragility filled his orbs. \u201cWe only have one child. She is our baby. We gave her our greatest love from the time she was born. But Qiu-er will die anytime now. If she dies, you can never bear the pain of losing a daughter.\u201d\n \u201cNot just you, I am the same.\u201d\n \u201cTingting, I am the same as you. I cannot bear the thought of losing Qiu-er.\u201d Mu Mian clenched his fists, his nails nearly piercing into his flesh. \u201cI want her to live! She doesn\u2019t have many days left. I cannot just stand by and watch her die...\u201d\n Mu Mian got down to his knees. He hollered in despair, \u201cI can\u2019t do it! I just want her to live! I want my daughter to live. Am I wrong in wanting that?\u201d Mu Mian\u2019s voice broke at that last sentence.\n He was crying now. A middle-aged man sobbing was a tragic and sorrowful sight.\n Du Tingting stared at Mu Mian in a daze. This was the second time in her life that she saw Mu Mian cry. The first time was the day they got married, right when he put the ring on her finger. Tears streamed down the face of that full-grown man.\n Du Tingting slid down to the floor and knelt beside Mu Mian to hug him.\n \u201cMu Mian.\u201d Du Tingting wrapped her arms around Mu Mian\u2019s shaking shoulders. She bent down and kissed his head. \u201cMu Mian, don\u2019t let the man I love turn into a murderer...\u201d\n Mu Mian hugged her back tightly. His sobs were heart-wrenching.\n \u201cI am sorry. I am sorry, Tingting...\u201d\n Only the heavens knew how tormented Mu Mian was.\n His heart burned as he watched Mu Qiu get thinner and more depressed by the day. Meanwhile, he also felt guilty whenever he gazed at Song Ci\u2019s smiling face. Returning home to the gentle and considerate Du Tingting, Mu Mian always felt so tired that he just wanted to hold her and cry.\n In the end, Du Tingting uncovered his despicable intentions.\n He was like a detestable parasite.\n That night, they wept in each other\u2019s arms.\n ...\n The next morning, the alarm woke Song Ci again. She yawned and gazed at the brightening sky. She cursed Han Zhan in a low voice before finally climbing out of bed to change clothes.\n Han Zhan bathed after completing his morning exercises. He went downstairs and saw that Song Ci had prepared breakfast for him. It was hot and sour rice noodles, as he had requested.\n Song Ci had on a black apron and waved at him from the dining table. \u201cBrother Han, come over here quickly. Taste my cooking.\u201d\n Han Zhan walked over with little expectations. He sat down and picked up his chopsticks. Under Song Ci\u2019s watchful eyes, he tasted the noodles. After just one bite, Han Zhan put down his chopsticks and looked at Song Ci in surprise.\n \u201cHow is it?\u201d Song Ci looked like a little kid just waiting to be praised.\n \u201cThe noodles are delicious, \u201cHan Zhan said. He had seen Song Ci make her low-calorie breakfast, and he also ate her fried rice. As a result, he didn\u2019t have high expectations for her culinary skills. But her rice noodles were not bad at all.\n Song Ci was very smug. \u201cI watched a cooking tutorial several times yesterday.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s felt heart warm at the thought of Song Ci learning how to cook from a video tutorial.\n Taking advantage of this moment, Song Ci held Han Zhan\u2019s left hand and said lovingly, \u201cBrother Han, I don\u2019t know how to cook, but I am willing to learn for you. Let\u2019s put off hiring a cook for now. Let me enjoy the feeling of taking care of my beloved man.\u201d She held Han Zhan\u2019s hand up to her lips and kissed it.\n Han Zhan tried to draw back his hand, but Song Ci clung to it, not allowing him to retreat.\n Han Zhan\u2019s girlfriend was being too romantic and passionate that he could not stand it.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "51": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-51\n\n Chapter 51: Getting A Marriage Certificate  \u201cBrother Han.\u201d Song Ci rested her chin on the back of Han Zhan\u2019s hand. She gazed at him, her lovely eyes clearly reflecting Han Zhan\u2019s image. \u201cLet\u2019s go get registered today.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s words surprised Han Zhan.\n He went silent.\n After a few moments, Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mind taking photos in your neck brace?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI have many existing photos suitable for the marriage certificate. Give me one of your solo photos, and I can easily photoshop us together to make a wedding photo.\u201d\n Han Zhan was thinking, \u2018She really has so many tricks up her sleeves.\u2019\n The two of them hurried over to the Ministry of Civil Affairs to get registered. In a blink of an eye, Han Zhan was sitting in the car and staring down at the red marriage certificate on his lap. Thinking of what had happened, Han Zhan suddenly felt it was all very absurd.\n He was already 32-years-old, not some impulsive 23-year-old guy. Why was he fooling around like this with Song Ci?\n Song Ci carefully studied the marriage certificate. She critiqued the photo on it. \u201cBrother Han, you should smile more in photos. Look, your face is so stern in this photo. You look just like an old fogey.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced down and smiled in exasperation.\n \u201cBrother Han, reach out one hand.\u201d\n Han Zhan instinctively reached out his left hand.\n As if she was performing a magic trick, Song Ci suddenly produced a gold ring.\n Staring at that ring, Han Zhan\u2019s breathing suddenly slowed.\n Song Ci placed the ring on Han Zhan\u2019s ring finger. She raised his left hand and scrutinized it before speaking with satisfaction. \u201cSuits you perfectly. Looks great on you.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at the gold ring, which had a simple black diamond in the center. It truly suited Han Zhan perfectly. After keeping silent for a long time, Han Zhan asked Song Ci in a low voice, \u201cWhen did you buy this?\u201d\n \u201cLast night.\u201d After leaving the Mu Family residence, Song Ci went shopping. \u201cI was afraid that the size might not be accurate, but luckily it fits nicely. It must be fate.\u201d\n Song Ci took out her ring. It was the same design as Han Zhan\u2019s, with just one small black diamond. She was about to put it on her when Han Zhan suddenly reached out and grabbed that ring.\n He said, \u201cI will put it on for you.\u201d\n Song Ci pursed her lips and shot him a look. She suddenly said, \u201cThe groom has to use his right hand to put it on for the bride.\u201d\n Sitting in the driver\u2019s seat in front, Long Yu overheard Song Ci\u2019s statement. His expression suddenly changed, and he stole a discreet glimpse at the back from the corner of his eye. Long Yu thought Han Zhan would reject Song Ci\u2019s suggestion, but Han Zhan just kept silent for a couple of moments before nodding his head. \u201cAlright.\u201d\n Long Yu was shocked.\n Mr. Han really treated Ms. Song differently.\n For the first time since they met, Han Zhan took off the glove covering his right hand.\n And that revealed Han Zhan\u2019s right hand.\n Two fake fingers were fixed on it, which were both flesh-colored. At first glance, one might not detect any difference, but upon closer look, they would notice those immobile fingers.\n They were slightly curved and looked very real.\n Just before taking off his fake fingers, Han Zhan warned Song Ci, \u201cThis might look ugly and disgusting.\u201d\n Song Ci glanced at him with a complex expression. She didn\u2019t speak.\n Without further hesitation, Han Zhan took off his fake fingers to reveal two ugly, scarred stumps. Han Zhan\u2019s fingers were cut off at the joints. Even after so many years, the scars still looked quite ugly.\n It was the first time Song Ci saw such a hand. Her breathing turned shallow.\n After a moment, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s really quite ugly.\u201d\n Long Yu\u2019s back stiffened at her words.\n Han Zhan was momentarily stunned before giving a smile. He didn\u2019t look angry at all. Long Yu stole a peek at Han Zhan as he felt a rush of complex emotions. Mr. Han had not been so calm and steady during the period right after he broke his fingers.\n He was once an elite sniper. His eyes and hands were more important to him than his own life. But someone broke his fingers. During that dark period, Mr. Han had been gloomy and depressed. Everyone thought he wouldn\u2019t make it.\n But now, Mr. Han could actually smile after he heard Song Ci say his fingers were ugly. This was completely unthinkable for Long Yu.\n Han Zhan used his thumb and ring finger to pick up the ring and placed it onto Song Ci\u2019s left ring finger. \u201cAlright, you are my bride now.\u201d\n Han Zhan lowered his head and prepared to put on his fake fingers.\n Song Ci suddenly leaned over and snatched away his fake fingers. \u201cLet me.\u201d\n Han Zhan instinctively rejected, \u201cNo need, I can...\u201d\n \u201cGet used to the fact that I will help you put them on from now on.\u201d Song Ci stared straight into Han Zhan\u2019s eyes. She patted his chest. \u201cBrother Han, from now on, only I can touch your right hand and your tie.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt like a hammer was smashed into his chest. He felt somewhat suffocated.\n So domineering.\n Han Zhan looked at his right hand with the fake fingers back on. His blue-grey eyes dimmed. In this world, there were plenty of women who were willing to help him with his tie. But only one was willing to put on his fake fingers for him.\n He wouldn\u2019t be able to bear seeing her leave after their year was up.\n Han Zhan wanted to try to keep her by his side.\n Although he was still not in love with her, his fondness for her had increased exponentially.\n Han Zhan suddenly held Song Ci\u2019s hand.\n Shocked, Song Ci turned and scolded him playfully, \u201cWhy are you holding my hand?\u201d Song Ci then grinned and placed both hands on Han Zhan\u2019s shoulders. She whispered seductively by his ear, \u201cBrother Han, give me a kiss.\u201d\n Song Ci was just teasing Han Zhan, but he instructed Long Yu, \u201cDon\u2019t turn your head.\u201d\n There was no way Long Yu would dare to do that now.\n Song Ci raised her brows.\n She still wished to tease Han Zhan, but he suddenly turned and cupped the back of her head with his left hand. He leaned over and planted his searing lips on Song Ci\u2019s soft ones. No one expected the cold, steady Han Zhan to have such passionately hot lips.\n Song Ci was momentarily startled, but she then closed her eyes.\n After parting, Song Ci\u2019s face was deep red, but she still tried to put on the calm facade of an experienced lover.\n Han Zhan put the two marriage certificates together and kept them in his pocket. Since he didn\u2019t think Mu Mian would agree to their marriage so easily, he asked her, \u201cHow did you get your household register?\u201d\n Song Ci said rather sheepishly, \u201cI took it from my mother. I told her I was... buying a house.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled. \u201cSly girl.\u201d\n His tone was heavy and Song Ci blushed even deeper.\n Long Yu fled immediately after dropping them off at the house. Song Ci commented, \u201cBrother Long is terribly scared because of you.\u201d\n Han Zhan followed Song Ci into the lift. \u201cHe will have to get used to it.\u201d\n Get used to it...\n He meant that whatever happened today would continue to happen in the future.\n Song Ci rubbed her earlobes discreetly, and she quite looked forward to it.\n Song Ci bent over to change shoes the moment they entered the house. She said to Han Zhan, \u201cTo celebrate our marriage registration, should we have an enormous meal this afternoon? Brother Han, you cook. I will be your assistant.\u201d\n Song Ci licked her lips when she thought of that huge lobster in the freezer. \u201cI want to chop up that lobster, peel off its shell, and devour it.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "52": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-52\n\n Chapter 52: These Long Socks Represent Brother Han\u2019s Love And Care  Her excitement amused Han Zhan.\n When Han Zhan was about to reply, his cell phone suddenly rang. He stopped changing his shoes and leaned against the wall to speak on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t speak out the caller\u2019s name.\n Song Ci vaguely heard the words \u201cRed Cross Society\u201d and \u201cDu Tingting.\u201d\n After Han Zhan had hung up, Song Ci asked, \u201cWho was it?\u201d\n \u201cMy surveillance guys.\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t hide the truth and told Song Ci, \u201cI had someone monitor the Mu Family\u2019s movements.\u201d He then took off his shoes and put on slippers. His tall, imposing figure brushed past Song Ci into the kitchen.\n Song Ci followed behind.\n Han Zhan placed a few dried wolfberries into a cup and filled it with boiling water. He handed the drink to Song Ci. \u201cDrink this.\u201d\n Song Ci held the cup and whined. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot today. I want to drink something cold.\u201d\n Han Zhan replied, \u201cNo, definitely not over these few days.\u201d\n \u201cWhy...\u201d Song Ci suddenly kept quiet.\n They were both staying under the same roof and there was no way she could hide the fact that she was menstruating. They were both adults, and Song Ci didn\u2019t feel any need to be embarrassed. She obediently drank the warm water before asking, \u201cCan we have lobster this afternoon then?\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci quickly opened the freezer and took out the frozen lobster. She placed it in a big bowl for it to thaw. \u201cWe will prepare it later. No hurry.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Han Zhan walked over to the sofa with his cup in hand. He spoke to Song Ci, who was following behind. \u201cDu Tingting went to the Red Cross Society this afternoon to inquire about organ donation.\u201d\n Song Ci frowned. She asked, \u201cWhat exactly did she enquire about?\u201d\n Han Zhan replied, \u201cShe signed up to be an organ donor. Guess what she intends to do?\u201d\n Song Ci was no fool. After thinking for a moment, she immediately understood what Du Tingting\u2019s actions meant.\n \u201cShe wants to donate her heart to Mu Qiu.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart felt very heavy.\n Only a mother would have such determination to sacrifice herself for her child.\n Han Zhan placed his cup on the coffee table. The moment he settled down on the sofa, Song Ci hustled over like a puppy and sat close to him. Both were very close to each other, with Song Ci purposely narrowing their distance.\n Han Zhan noticed and silently accepted her intimacy.\n They were husband and wife. They would perform the world\u2019s most intimate action, eventually. The earlier they got used to being intimate, the better it would be.\n Lowering his eyes to gaze at Song Ci\u2019s long, slender fair legs peeking out of her knee-length skirt, Han Zhan said, \u201cI am thinking what led to your mother suddenly having such a notion?\u201d\n \u201cMu Qiu\u2019s getting weaker by the day. She will die if she can\u2019t get a suitable heart. While Mother, on the other hand, has been in constant agony these days. Perhaps she already thought of something long ago.\u201d\n Song Ci knew Han Zhan was sizing up her legs. She purposely sat sideways to elongate the line of her legs, which made her even more lovely.\n Han Zhan\u2019s brows shot up.\n Song Ci patted her thigh gently, and with a suggestive expression, she asked, \u201cBrother Han, do you think my legs are attractive? Do you wish to touch them?\u201d Song Ci lifted her right leg and extended it toward Han Zhan. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll let you touch it for free.\u201d\n Han Zhan reached out one calloused finger and pushed her right leg away.\n He got up and went upstairs, leaving Song Ci still in a daze on the sofa. After a short while, Han Zhan went downstairs with a pair of men\u2019s woolen socks. He tossed them into Song Ci\u2019s arms. \u201cWear these socks.\u201d\n Holding those long, woolen socks, Song Ci had doubts about her own life. \u201cIt\u2019s summer now.\u201d\n Han Zhan replied, \u201cI already adjusted the central air-conditioning to 24 degrees celsius.\u201d\n Song Ci pouted. \u201cTwenty-four degrees celsius is not that cold...\u201d\n Han Zhan shot her a cool look. He said, \u201cGirls have lower body temperature. They will suffer from joint pain if they don\u2019t keep their limbs warm. Be a good girl, put them on.\u201d\n His tone was warm and gentle but held an irrefutable dominance.\n Grumbling, Song Ci put on the socks.\n As Han Zhan started chopping up onions in the kitchen, Song Ci laid like a corpse on the sofa. She sank deep into the valley of self-doubt.\n She was Song Ci. Top debutante. Fashion Icon. Her every movement and outfit change was everyone\u2019s focus. The last time she put on a sock was when she was six, the time she understood the concept of beauty and fashion.\n But today, her darling hubby had tossed her a pair of long socks...\n Song Ci took a photo and sent it to Yan Jiang to complain. [ Look. ]\n [ Yan Jiang: Yellow skirt matched with black socks?? ]\n [ Yan Jiang: Have you gone mad? ]\n [ Song Ci: Brother Han said this will keep me warm. Otherwise, my joints will ache when I am old. ]\n Yan Jiang had a cigarette between his lips. He was sitting on a chair in the dressing room and puffing out streams of smoke. He frowned when he read Song Ci\u2019s message and typed a reply.\n [ Yan Jiang: Song Song, are you gloating about how much your Brother Han cares for you? ]\n Song Ci read Yan Jiang\u2019s reply and glanced at the kitchen. She secretly took a photo of Han Zhan cooking and sent it to Yan Jiang.\n [ Song Ci: That\u2019s my Brother Han. Isn\u2019t he handsome? ]\n Half a second later, Yan Jiang replied. [ Whatever floats your boat. ]\n Angered, Song Ci tossed her cell phone aside. She got up and entered the kitchen.\n Han Zhan was stir-frying onions, and its fragrance filled the kitchen. Song Ci suddenly hugged Han Zhan from behind. His hands paused, and he quickly put down the frying pan. \u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d\n He had to quickly get used to Song Ci\u2019s touchy-feely antics.\n \u201cI am hugging my hubby. Do I need a reason for that?\u201d Song Ci stated very self-righteously. She then stood on tiptoe to watch him cook, to which Han Zhan could not retort.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t have an enormous appetite, but she was full after just half a lobster. After the meal, she watched Han Zhan finish up the remaining lobster and two bowls of rice. Song Ci gave him a big thumbs-up. \u201cBrother Han has such a big appetite. No wonder you grew up to be so tall.\u201d\n Han Zhan took it as a compliment. \u201cI have to work this afternoon and cannot accompany you.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t need you to accompany me.\u201d\n After she saw Han Zhan go, Song Ci planned to visit Mu Qiu at the hospital.\n ...\n Wangdong City was divided into the east and west sides, as well as the north and south coasts. There were six districts in the west part of the city: Golden District, Blue Water District, Huoan District, Jinshan District, Phoenix District, and Yufu District. Meanwhile, the east side had three districts: Jade District, East Mountain District, and Three Bridges District.\n The north and south coasts were only recently carved out to become the new high-tech parks. The research and development department of Han Zhan\u2019s Zeus Airlines was on the south coast. The Great Dragon River ran between the east and west sides of Wangdong City. There were three major bridges over this river: Crossings Bridge, Wangdong Bridge, and East Mountain Bridge.\n A small hill stood right in the middle of the Great Dragon River. It used to be empty in the past, but someone bought it eight years ago. They built a grand skyscraper on that hill which astonished the world.\n The Crouching Dragon BuildingCurren.\n The skyscraper was 180m tall and looked like a sleeping mythical dragon from afar. The world-famous architect, Ying Fan, designed it and his design won the Pritzker Architecture Prize!\n Some claimed that it was Sheng Hui Technology Company\u2019s new building. Others claimed it was Huiteng Car Corporation headquarters. Everyone had their speculation, but no one knew which was the truth.\n But the reborn Song Ci knew. A year later, Sheng Hui Technology Company, Huiteng Car Corporation, the famous Jetta Hotel Chain, Oriental Real Estate Group, and the newly established Zeus Corporation would all merge to become Zeus Corporation!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "53": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-53\n\n Chapter 53: He is Handicapped  Two years later, the big boss of Zeus Corporation, Han Zhan, would appear in the media for the first time. The public unveiling of the newly crowned richest man in the town was a shock for everyone. From that day onwards, Han Zhan\u2019s face was deeply imprinted in virtually everyone in Wangdong City.\n Up until Song Ci\u2019s death, Han Zhan\u2019s status in Wangdong City was of the highest level possible. But in this life, the legendary Han Zhan was now officially hers.\n And that Crouching Dragon Building was Zeus Corporation\u2019s headquarters.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s hospital was on the east side of the city. One would need to cross the Wangdong Bridge to get from Han Zhan\u2019s place to the hospital. As the car drove over the bridge, Song Ci could see that the Crouching Dragon Building construction was on-going. She could hear her heartbeat getting louder and louder.\n Her heart grew warm as she thought of how one day Han Zhan would sit in the most revered seat in that entire building.\n Noticing that there was some activity going on at the Crouching Dragon Building, Song Ci told Long Yu, \u201cBrother Long, please slow down.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n As the car slowed down, Song Ci wound down the window. She saw a big crowd standing at the entrance of the Crouching Dragon Building. She asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at the Crouching Dragon Building today?\u201d\n Long Yu replied, \u201cHuiteng Car Corporation launched a new car model today, called Aoyu. I heard it\u2019s very high tech and awesome. It has an advanced sensor system and awesome smart-driving capabilities...\u201d\n Long Yu must really like that car. As he went on and on about its capabilities, he kept repeating the word \u201cawesome.\u201d\n Song Ci knew that they named this car after Old Master Han.\n Aoyu Number 1 could go from manual drive to automatic drive. It could automatically analyze its surroundings and come to an immediate stop on its own if it sensed danger.\n It was very suitable for people bad at driving. Song Ci bought an Aoyu car in her previous life, but she would never admit to being bad at driving.\n Aoyu Number 1 would perform astonishingly well after they launched it in the market. It would top the sales leagues for three consecutive years. And the next car model to beat its sales record would not be any other model, but Aoyu Number 2.\n No wonder Han Zhan said he had something on this afternoon. He probably had to go attend the news conference for the launching of the new car. Song Ci was not sure about Han Zhan\u2019s real background. She just knew he was the big boss behind Zeus Airlines and the grandson of Old Master Han Aoyu.\n Song Ci had no idea how he was connected to the bosses of Sheng Hui Technology Company and Huiteng Car Corporation, though.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help but feel amused as she looked at Long Yu\u2019s sparkling eyes. \u201cDo you like it a lot?\u201d\n Completely not embarrassed, Long Yu quickly nodded. \u201cOf course. Many people like it. But I heard that each car costs about $600,000 to $700,000. I won\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d\n Song Ci chuckled. \u201cI like it too. I will have Brother Han buy you one at the end of the year.\u201d\n Long Yu smiled so widely that his eyes narrowed into slits.\n ...\n When Song Ci arrived at the hospital, she realized that Du Tingting was also there. She was washing some towels, and it seemed like she had just helped Mu Qiu clean up.\n She thought of how Du Tingting visited the Red Cross Society yesterday to enquire about organ donation. Her heart was somewhat heavy as she faced Du Tingting, for she knew that if all else failed, Du Tingting would truly sacrifice her own life to save Mu Qiu\u2019s.\n Song Ci looked at Mu Qiu, who was lying on the bed disconsolately. She suddenly felt it was totally not worth it. Mother, would you be disappointed if you knew this beloved child of yours would steal her sister\u2019s heart just to save herself?\n Du Tingting hung the towel on a rack to dry. When she turned to the doorway,.she saw Song Ci there and apparently in a daze. She smiled. \u201cSong Song, you are here.\u201d\n Mu Qiu lifted her head to look at Song Ci.\n Upon seeing Song Ci, a smile finally broke out on Mu Qiu\u2019s face. Mu Qiu saw on television that Song Ci had cut her hair short, but she thought she had seen wrong. \u201cBig sister! You really cut your hair?\u201d\n Now that she saw Song Ci\u2019s short hair in person, Mu Qiu looked puzzled. \u201cBig sister, why did you cut your hair?\u201d\n Of course, Song Ci did not tell her the truth. Instead, she said, \u201cThe weather is too hot. It\u2019s quite uncomfortable to have my hair sticking to my neck all the time.\u201d\n \u201cYou can just tie it up.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s more convenient to cut it.\u201d Song Ci went to sit down on a stool beside the bed. She noticed that Mu Qiu was becoming thinner by the day, and she looked rather sickly. The longer she waited, the more depressed Mu Qiu had become. With such a despondent state of mind, how could she look happy and healthy?\n Mu Qiu suddenly covered her mouth with her hands and widened her eyes, as if suddenly realizing something major.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Qiu-er?\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s action bewildered Du Tingting.\n Mu Qiu pointed at Song Ci\u2019s left hand and exclaimed in shock. \u201cSister, you are married!\u201d\n Du Tingting was stunned.\n Song Ci graciously lifted her left hand and faced Du Tingting. She explained, \u201cMother, Han Zhan and I went to register our marriage yesterday.\u201d\n Du Tingting opened her mouth but didn\u2019t know what to say. Some moments later, she finally said, \u201cSo when you got the household register from me yesterday...\u201d Song Ci deceived her!\n \u201cI am sorry, mother.\u201d Song Ci lowered her head and apologized softly. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have done that. But I had no choice. Father doesn\u2019t approve of Han Zhan. I know that.\u201d\n \u201cBut I truly love Han Zhan. Father would definitely object if he knew that I was going to marry Han Zhan, so I...\u201d Two streams of tears flowed down her fair cheeks.\n Du Tingting was momentarily dumbstruck. Ever since she discovered the organ compatibility test results, she felt a deep sense of guilt toward Song Ci.\n Du Tingting could not bring herself to rebuke Song Ci, no matter what wrong she had committed.\n Du Tingting kept silent the entire time.\n Mu Qiu had already heard about Han Zhan from Du Tingting. She knew that Han Zhan came from an ordinary family background, and he had a handicap. To be honest, Mu Qiu was pleasantly surprised when she saw Han Zhan\u2019s handsome face on the screen. But her heart hardened after knowing that he had a physical defect.\n She did not understand why her gorgeous sister would marry such a small-time nobody.\n Big sister had so many admirers. Any of them were better than Han Zhan.\n \u201cBig sister, why did you marry Brother Han...\u201d Mu Qiu stammered. \u201cHe... he is a handicapped person.\u201d\n Song Ci frowned. \u201cSo what if he has a handicap?\u201d\n Han Zhan was already her official husband. How could she endure anyone insulting Han Zhan because of his physical defect? \u201cHe is just missing two fingers, not two hands!\u201d\n \u201cMoreover, I love Han Zhan not because of his looks or any such superficial things.\u201d Song Ci was getting increasingly adept at lying. She could spout all sorts of righteous nonsense without even thinking.\n Mu Qiu saw how protective Song Ci was of Han Zhan and believed that she must be blinded by love. Mu Qiu still didn\u2019t think much of Han Zhan. But she was afraid of angering Song Ci, and so kept her mouth shut.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "54": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-54\n\n Chapter 54: Testing Each Other  Mu Qiu saw how protective Song Ci was of Han Zhan and believed that she must be blindly in love. Mu Qiu still didn\u2019t think much of Han Zhan. But she was afraid of angering Song Ci, and so kept her mouth shut.\n Du Tingting quickly cut in to soothe things over. \u201cAlright, Qiu-er, you are not allowed to say such things in the future.\u201d Tugging at Song Ci\u2019s arm, Du Tingting apologized, \u201cSong Song, don\u2019t be angry at Qiu-er. She is pointing out Han Zhan\u2019s flaws only because she worries that you might suffer in the future.\u201d\n Since Du Tingting apologized on behalf of Mu Qiu, Song Ci couldn\u2019t continue being mad. She made up with Mu Qiu.\n At this moment, someone bearing a plate of food walked past the ward. The fragrant smell of cooked meat wafted in. As Song Ci sniffed, she realized it was pork rib soup.\n Du Tingting\u2019s brows suddenly furrowed. She let go of Song Ci\u2019s arm and turned to rush into the toilet. Du Tingting moved so hastily that Song Ci and Mu Qiu were left exchanging glances.\n In her hurry, Du Tingting didn\u2019t close the door. Within seconds, Song Ci and Mu Qiu heard sounds of vomiting.\n Song Ci had a sudden flash of insight.\n Du Tingting had been exhausted and drowsy these few days. She was easily distracted, nauseated...\n These were all signs of pregnancy!\n Song Ci glanced at Mu Qiu and saw that she also looked somewhat bewildered. Mu Qiu was no fool, she probably also suspected.\n Song Ci\u2019s face darkened slightly. Things were not looking good.\n Since Mu Qiu\u2019s days were numbered, she would definitely die if she couldn\u2019t find a suitable heart any time soon. Meanwhile, Du Tingting was pregnant and would have a new child with Mu Mian. It would be earth-shattering news for Mu Qiu, who was reaching the end of her road.\n What would Mu Qiu think about this?\n Song Ci didn\u2019t even dare to guess.\n Several minutes later, Du Tingting emerged from the toilet. She had already rinsed her mouth and carefully dabbed her lips dry. Walking out from the toilet, she flashed a tired smile at the two sisters. \u201cI have been having gastric problems in the past few days.\u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s deliberate explanation made the entire situation even more suspicious. Perhaps Du Tingting already knew she was pregnant and was afraid of how Mu Qiu might react. Hence, she made up this lie.\n Song Ci glanced at Mu Qiu again. Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes were indeed dark and grim.\n If Song Ci could think of that possibility, Mu Qiu would have the same conclusion too. \u201cThen rest more. Take your medicine at stipulated times. Eat foods that are more light and healthy.\u201d Mu Qiu pulled herself together to show concern for Du Tingting\u2019s health. She said, \u201cMother, don\u2019t come to the hospital these couple of days if you are feeling unwell. I feel tired for you, seeing you running back and forth every day.\u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart became warm at Mu Qiu\u2019s words, but it put Song Ci on the alert.\n \u201cI wish to take a rest. Mother, you head back first with sister.\u201d Mu Qiu laid down and pulled her blanket over her chest. She was clearly instructing them to leave.\n Du Tingting wanted to stay a little longer, but Song Ci spoke up. \u201cMother, since Qiu-er is tired, let her rest. I will leave with you. I drove over so I can send you home.\u201d\n Du Tingting nearly hit someone in her early years of driving. Since then, Mu Mian was so worried that he forbade Du Tingting from driving ever again. She had a chauffeur with her wherever she went.\n Du Tingting hesitated before finally nodding her assent. She nagged at Mu Qiu a bit more and urged her to not play with her cell phone so much and to get more rest. Mu Qiu looked very impatient and covered her head with her blanket. The blanket had muffled her voice as she said, \u201cAlright, I got it. You guys leave first.\u201d\n Du Tingting looked at Mu Qiu with a worried look for a few more moments, before leaving with Song Ci.\n The mother-daughter pair headed toward the lift.\n Both of them held secrets deep inside their hearts, and could not speak them out loud. They had arrived on the first floor in silence when Du Tingting suddenly tugged at Song Ci\u2019s arm. \u201cSong Song, it has been a long time since we last came out for a coffee. There\u2019s a cafe nearby. Shall we go there and sit for a bit?\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I am free anyway,\u201d Song Ci agreed. It was just as well that Song Ci also had some things to tell Du Tingting, like how she was on medical leave after getting injured. She would continue with her trainee practice at Zeus Airlines after she recovered.\n ...\n Arriving at the cafe, Song Ci ordered an Americano while Du Tingting got a cup of milk. Song Ci casually asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get a mocha? I remember that you always get mocha at cafes.\u201d\n Worried that Song Ci would get suspicious, Du Tingting explained calmly, \u201cMy stomach doesn\u2019t feel that well, and a glass of warm milk soothes it. Moreover, this cafe\u2019s mocha doesn\u2019t look that good.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t try to unravel Du Tingting\u2019s well-conceived lies.\n Du Tingting fidgeted as she held her glass of milk. She was considering how to tell Song Ci her thoughts.\n She didn\u2019t dare to tell Song Ci about what Mu Mian had done for the fear of causing a rift between the father and daughter. But Du Tingting couldn\u2019t just stand by and do nothing now that she knew Song Fei was in danger. She had to warn Song Ci to protect Song Fei!\n Having finally decided, Du Tingting asked Song Ci, \u201cSong Song, did your elder sister contact you?\u201d\n Song Ci shot Du Tingting a meaningful look.\n Du Tingting already felt guilty and her lashes started fluttering uncontrollably at Song Ci\u2019s straight stare.\n \u2018Why is mother suddenly asking about elder sister? Did she find out about Mu Mian\u2019s shady actions?\u2019\n This sudden question about her elder sister\u2019s whereabouts... Was she trying to help Mu Mian catch her elder sister so they could steal her heart for Mu Qiu? Or was she trying to warn her about Mu Mian?\n Song Ci quickly averted her gaze and picked up her coffee. It was difficult to drink something while wearing a neck brace, so she had struggled awkwardly for a few moments before answering. \u201cI am still trying to find her. The police are very busy and finding a missing person is low on their priorities. I have also hired a private investigator to help.\u201d\n Song Ci casually glanced at Du Tingting as she spoke. She discovered that Du Tingting looked even more anxious now.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart quivered as she noticed the change in Du Tingting\u2019s expression. It seemed like Du Tingting had found out about Mu Mian\u2019s actions toward Song Fei! When did she find out? Did she already know of this a long time ago? Or was it just recently?\n Song Ci wanted to know whether Du Tingting was in the dark over Song Fei\u2019s murder, or was she complicit in the scheme? She decided to put Du Tingting on a test.\n Song Ci put on a determined expression. She said, \u201cI believe that I will find Song Fei. I am the only family she has left in this world. She will only feel safe by my side. Moreover, isn\u2019t father busy looking for her too? Father has so many connections. I believe it will not take long before we find elder sister.\u201d\n Instead of Song Fei\u2019s words reassuring her, Du Tingting appeared even more anxious. She suddenly said with urgency, \u201cPerhaps Song Fei has some hidden and unspeakable reason for keeping away from you?\u201d\n \u201cSong Song, know that it is nearly impossible to find someone who truly wishes to hide. Perhaps Song Fei will return on her own after she sorts out her situation.\u201d\n \u201cI think you need not worry too much about Song Fei. She is no longer a child. Moreover, your father has cut off your allowance and Han Zhan still has a housing loan to repay. It must be quite expensive for you to hire a private detective. I think we should just quietly wait for good news from the police.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "55": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-55\n\n Chapter 55: You Are Too Biased  It was clear from Du Tingting\u2019s words she did not want them to find Song Fei.\n But why?\n Song Ci guessed that Du Tingting must have discovered Mu Mian\u2019s plans. She couldn\u2019t warn Song Ci directly of the danger, but also couldn\u2019t just stand by and watch. As a result, all she could do was to urge her to give up her search for Song Fei.\n Du Tingting was not guilty of murdering Song Fei. She was the only innocent party in this entire scheme.\n This realization soothed Song Ci\u2019s heart.\n But she had to continue her act. As Song Fei\u2019s little sister, Song Ci couldn\u2019t give up the search for Song Fei so easily. \u201cI won\u2019t stop looking for Song Fei. I still have money. Mother, you need not worry about me.\u201d\n Du Tingting took her glass of milk with a heavy heart. She took a big gulp and the hot liquid almost burned her. She quickly put down the glass and tried to cool off her tongue. \u201cDamn!\u201d\n Song Ci immediately stood up to get a glass of ice water for Du Tingting.\n Du Tingting gave a self-mocking smile after drinking the water. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize the milk was so hot.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t expose her lie. She looked at Du Tingting meaningfully. \u201cDoes mother have anything weighing down on her mind?\u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart gave a jolt. She looked at Song Ci with uncertainty.\n Du Tingting\u2019s nervous expression amused Song Ci. \u201cMother looked uneasy since the moment we sat down. Now that Qiu-er is ill, we have little opportunity to sit down for a long chat. You can tell me if anything\u2019s bothering you.\u201d\n Du Tingting bore too many secrets, and she had to release some of her burden to someone.\n Du Tingting kept silent for a long time before she finally spoke her mind. \u201cI went to inquire at the Red Cross Society today.\u201d Looking at Song Ci\u2019s puzzled face, Du Tingting added, \u201cRegarding organ donation.\u201d\n \u201cMother...\u201d At that, Song Ci\u2019s expression changed slightly. Song Ci was sternly looking at Du Tingting. She asked, \u201cAre you thinking of giving your heart to Qiu-er?\u201d\n Although she was asking a question, there was no uncertainty in Song Ci\u2019s tone.\n \u201cI am thinking of doing that.\u201d Du Tingting nodded. Her heart felt like it was being stabbed every time she thought of her daughter.\n \u201cQiu-er is still so young. I really cannot just stand by and watch her die.\u201d Du Tingting clenched her stirring spoon tightly and her breathing became labored. \u201cShe has such a rare blood type that there is a low chance of her finding a suitable heart in time. We have the same blood type. I carried her for nine months before giving birth to her. My heart is definitely suitable for her!\u201d\n \u201cIf I don\u2019t save her, no one can!\u201d\n Looking deeply into Song Ci\u2019s eyes, Du Tingting said, \u201cIn this world, no one else should have to sacrifice their own lives to save Qiu-er. If there has to be such a person... then let it be me.\u201d\n \u201cShe is my child.\u201d\n She was the one who should donate her heart, not some innocent young girl. Whether it was Song Fei or anyone else, they were all living, breathing creatures. They had no obligation to save Mu Qiu.\n Du Tingting would never just stand by and watch Mu Mian turn into a murderer. She would also never allow building her daughter\u2019s life upon the death of an innocent.\n Du Tingting\u2019s words moved Song Ci. She thought of her mother. Song Ci and Song Fei looked very much like their mother, Jiang Mengmeng, who was a very beautiful woman. She was strong and kind-hearted, and she loved Song Ci and Song Fei very much.\n Song Fei had a high IQ. She loved to research all sorts of bizarre topics. To some people, Song Fei\u2019s behavior was strange, but Jiang Mengmeng respected her a lot. No matter how others criticized Song Fei\u2019s behavior, she remained supportive of her weird research forays.\n Song Ci was not as smart as Song Fei, but she was very talented in terms of music. She could play the violin beautifully the first time she tried it. After Jiang Mengmeng discovered Song Ci\u2019s gift for music, she tried many ways to let her mentor under the famous violinist Chen Yu.\n Song Ci remembered the day she went to her teacher\u2019s house for a violin lesson. It was already dark by the time their lesson ended. Jiang Mengmeng went to fetch her home, and on their way back, they encountered a vicious murderer who was just fleeing from the scene of his crime.\n Song Ci was scared speechless. But the usually soft-spoken Jiang Mengmeng immediately pushed Song Ci behind her own body to shield her. With the ferocity of a mother protecting her child, Jiang Mengmeng ended up fighting with the murderer.\n By the time Song Ci\u2019s dad arrived at the scene, the murderer had stabbed Jiang Mengmeng in the abdomen.\n Song Ci put the memory aside and studied Du Tingting carefully. Du Tingting was also a mother like Jiang Mengmeng, brave, and fearless. Of course, they were also scared of pain and death, but they had to be strong because of their children.\n \u201cMother.\u201d Song Ci asked Du Tingting, \u201cDoes father know of your decision?\u201d\n Du Tingting shook her head somewhat sheepishly. \u201cI told him about this before. But he objected.\u201d\n Song Ci knew it would be like that.\n Mu Mian was vicious toward her and Song Fei but was utterly devoted to his wife. Mu Mian would never agree to take Du Tingting\u2019s heart for Mu Qiu.\n If one had to compare, Du Tingting was more important to Mu Mian than Mu Qiu.\n Song Ci added, \u201cMu Qiu will never agree either if she knew.\u201d\n Du Tingting replied resolutely without even thinking, \u201cI won\u2019t tell her.\u201d\n Song Ci gave a bitter smile. \u201cBut she will know, eventually. After the operation, Qiu-er will open her eyes to look for you. How terrible she will feel when she can\u2019t find you.\u201d\n Song Ci held Du Tingting\u2019s hand. \u201cI respect your decision, but mother, you should also respect Qiu-er. At the very least, listen to Qiu-er\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n \u201cIf I was the one who was ill and my mother went behind my back to sign an organ donation form, and I woke up from the operation to discover my mother is dead and the heart beating inside me now was hers...\u201d\n Song Ci bit her lips. She said vehemently, \u201cI would rather die. I won\u2019t go on living.\u201d\n Du Tingting was scared witless with Song Ci\u2019s last sentence.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t agree with Du Tingting\u2019s actions. In all honesty, Song Ci didn\u2019t think demon Mu Qiu was worthy of Du Tingting\u2019s sacrifice.\n Staring at the milk in front of Du Tingting, Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t want your own life anymore, are you also going to sacrifice the life of the child in your belly?\u201d\n \u201cYou...\u201d Du Tingting\u2019s face froze. She looked very flustered. Du Tingting cupped her hands helplessly around her glass of milk. The warm liquid helped Du Tingting to maintain some sense of calm.\n Song Ci knew she was pregnant?\n Song Ci had guessed correctly that Du Tingting was pregnant. Du Tingting had also gotten pregnant during this period in her previous life. But Du Tingting was so nervous and fretful during Mu Qiu\u2019s surgery that she suffered a miscarriage. It was only then did everyone realize she was pregnant.\n Everything was happening according to what had happened in her previous life.\n Du Tingting felt very uneasy. She asked Song Ci, \u201cHow did you know I am pregnant?\u201d\n The left corner of Song Ci\u2019s lips curled up slightly. She smiled in exasperation. \u201cMother, I am no longer a child. I can tell.\u201d With that, her expression dimmed. \u201cMu Qiu is also not a kid anymore. If I can tell, she can too.\u201d\n Du Tingting opened her mouth. But her throat felt parched and painful. She completely could not utter a single word.\n Staring at Du Tingting\u2019s dumbstruck manner, Song Ci heartlessly pointed out, \u201cMother, your so-called selfless sacrifice is very unfair to the child in your tummy. The world is so wonderful, but its mother has already sentenced it to death even before it can catch a glimpse of her.\u201d\n \u201cMother, you are too biased.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s concluding statement was so sharp and straight to the point that all color drained from Du Tingting\u2019s face.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "56": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-56\n\n Chapter 56: Brother Han, She Bullied Me  At this point, Song Ci already said whatever she needed to say. It was up to Du Tingting to make the final decision, and there was nothing Song Ci could do more.\n \u201cToday is my wedding day with Han Zhan. I\u2019m going to go out for dinner with him tonight and have to get going.\u201d Song Ci stood up and asked Du Tingting, \u201cMother, why don\u2019t I send you back first?\u201d\n Du Tingting shook her head in a daze. \u201cYou go ahead first. I\u2019ll sit here for a while more.\u201d Knowing that Du Tingting was in a foul mood, Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to leave her alone for the fear of any accidents. Thus, she called the Mu Family chauffeur and told him to come to the cafe to pick Du Tingting up at once.\n After she had hung up, Song Ci told Du Tingting, \u201cI called the chauffeur. He\u2019ll come and pick you up within half an hour. Mother, you just wait here. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d\n Du Tingting solemnly nodded her head.\n Song Ci left the cafe. Long Yu, who was standing at the door watching a live-stream video, hurriedly switched off his phone. Song Ci had a good hearing and heard the content of his live-stream video. After boarding the car, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019re watching Aoyu Number 1\u2019s live press conference?\u201d\n \u201cYup.\u201d Most men loved cars and Long Yu was no exception. Since he couldn\u2019t afford it, he could at least admire it.\n Song Ci asked, \u201cThe press conference hasn\u2019t ended?\u201d\n Long Yu replied, \u201cIt\u2019s almost ending already.\u201d\n \u201cHow\u2019s the online audience reaction?\u201d\n Long Yu said, \u201cFour words is enough to describe it.\u201d He intentionally paused for effect, waited for Song Ci to look up curiously at him, and said, \u201cWhole screen of damns.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cSeems like it\u2019s rather well-received.\u201d\n \u201cBut of course.\u201d Long Yu started the car and asked Song Ci, \u201cMiss Song, are we going home now or going elsewhere?\u201d\n Wanting to see Han Zhan, Song Ci said, \u201cGo to Crouching Dragon Building.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The Crouching Dragon Building was crowded that there were no parking lots available in the carpark. Song Ci thought after the press conference for the new car ended, there would be free spaces, but after going a few rounds around the carpark, Long Yu still couldn\u2019t find a lot to park.\n \u201cMiss Song, why don\u2019t you alight first and I\u2019ll drive the car to the basement carpark at the business square?\u201d Long Yu was getting impatient from driving in circles and had no choice but to trouble Song Ci to alight first.\n \u201cSure.\u201d Song Ci alighted and found a shady position to stand. She whipped out her phone and sent Han Zhan a message to inform him to come down and meet her.\n In the building, Li Li and Han Zhan walked side by side through an arc-shaped corridor. The press conference had just ended not too long ago. The staff had merged the comments and messages from the online audience watching the live-stream video and sent them over to Li Li.\n Li Li spent about ten minutes to finish reading the comments and messages. He shut down the iPad and said to Han Zhan beside him, \u201cThe press conference this time received much attention from the online audience. The total viewership of the press conference from various platforms had exceeded 5 million.\u201d\n \u201cEveryone\u2019s comments towards Aoyu Number 1 were all positive\u2014they all looked forward to its launch. I think the sales for Aoyu Number 1 when it launches will definitely be astonishing.\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded. This was already within his expectations.\n After talking about work, Li Li said, \u201cOh yes, Huiteng\u2019s general manager contacted me at the backstage just now to try to set up a meal with us.\u201d Not many people knew that Han Zhan was the boss behind Huiteng, only some. The top-management of Huiteng set up a dinner for them.\n Han Zhan only went back to the office to patrol once every season and handed the daily operations to the general manager of Huiteng. After meeting Han Zhan, everyone wanted to get into his good books.\n Han Zhan was about to agree when the phone against his thigh suddenly vibrated. \u201cGive me a moment.\u201d Han Zhan whipped out his phone and saw Song Ci\u2019s message. [ Brother Han, are you done with work yet? I\u2019m waiting for you at the square in front of the Crouching Dragon Building. ]\n Han Zhan\u2019s brows raised slightly.\n Song Ci was around?\n Han Zhan lifted his foot, changed his direction, and approached the window. He looked out and at the ground\u2014there were many people at the square below, but he found Song Ci easily.\n Song Ci was standing by the water fountain at the square, wearing an exaggerating hat to block off the sun. She was wearing a white lacy dress that exposed half of her nice shoulder. Although she was wearing a neck brace, she was still the most fashionable icon.\n Noticing Han Zhan\u2019s movement, Li Li also walked over and looked below the building. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\n Wherever Song Ci was, she was always the focus. Li Li also had good eyesight and immediately saw Song Ci, who was beside the water fountain.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that Miss Song...\u201d Li Li wanted to comment on this but didn\u2019t know what to say. He made a face at Han Zhan, smiled, and teased him, \u201cMiss Song is so aggressive in her pursuit. Mr. Han, will we be able to attend your and Miss Song\u2019s wedding at the end of the year?\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly stretched out his left hand and lifted it before Li Li.\n Li Li casually glanced and immediately saw the gold ring on Han Zhan\u2019s left ring finger.\n He widened his eyes, and a word slipped out of his mouth\u2014\n \u201cDamn!\u201d\n Han Zhan stuffed his left hand back into his pocket calmly. \u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss.\u201d\n Glancing at the stunned Li Li, Han Zhan was in a good mood. He said, \u201cAs you can see, I got married this morning.\u201d Saying that, he patted Li Li\u2019s shoulder in a friendly manner, and pretended to be solemn as he said, \u201cManager Li, you\u2019re also approaching your thirties soon\u2014you should take charge of your love life.\u201d\n Just because Han Zhan was a few years older than him, Li Li always made fun of the fact that Han Zhan was single. But now that Han Zhan had turned the tables around and finally got rid of his single status by marrying someone, he finally turned the joke back on Li Li.\n Li Li\u2019s lips twitched as he glanced at Han Zhan turning around and walking away in light steps, emitting an aura that seemed to say, \u2018I\u2019m already married, singles please do not disturb.\u2019 Li Li snapped out of his daze and shouted, \u201cAre you still going to the dinner tonight?\u201d\n \u201cNope, gonna accompany my wife.\u201d Han Zhan lifted his left hand and waved it at Li Li while back-facing him. Under the sunlight, that gold ring\u2019s glow was blinding.\n The public display of affection made Li Li slightly depressed.\n ...\n The water fountain was in the shape of a crown. A little girl wearing a princess dress ignored her mother\u2019s screams, ducked under the fountain, and stood in the middle of the crown. She struck a princess pose, and said confidently, \u201cHow dare you not kneel upon seeing the princess!\u201d\n With a little girl staring at her, Song Ci was speechless.\n She simmered with laughter as she bowed slightly towards the little girl. \u201cYour mighty highness, pleasant afternoon.\u201d\n The little girl stared at Song Ci\u2019s face and considered for a moment. She then seriously said, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty, so you don\u2019t have to greet me in the future.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing.\n When Han Zhan came over, he saw Song Ci laughing and shaking her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s voice, Song Ci turned around. She walked over, grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s hand to pull him to the water fountain. She pointed at that little girl, and complained pitifully, \u201cBrother Han, she bullied Cici.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n That little girl looked at Han Zhan and then looked back at Song Ci. She suddenly pouted, and ran to her mother crying and shouting, \u201cAh! Mother, that bad sister asked uncle to hit me!\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Brother Han is very steady.\u201d It even rhymed.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think I look so old that I look a generation more than you?\u201d Han Zhan asked in a depressed tone. The salesperson who sold nourishing teas to him said that drinking tea frequently would make one look ten years younger.\n Two years of drinking tea daily were a waste, if so.\n Salespeople always lied!\n Song Ci hurriedly said, \u201cNonsense, Brother Han is always 18 years old.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t trust Song Ci\u2019s words anymore. Her words were even more hypocritical than that of salespeople.\n He looked down and stared at Song Ci\u2019s little dress, his gaze landing on her snow-like fair skin. His family rules clearly stated that she wasn\u2019t allowed to wear clothes that were too revealing. This dress even showed Song Ci\u2019s shoulder and was indecent. Han Zhan said in a slightly low voice, \u201cWhy are you wearing this?\u201d\n Song Ci could tell the displeasure in Han Zhan\u2019s tone. She released him, stood before him, and hid her hands behind her back. She said, \u201cI\u2019m going on a date tonight and I look good wearing this.\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned slightly. \u201cOh, with who? You can\u2019t possibly fish for men on the first day of our marriage.\u201d\n Song Ci stretched out her right hand towards Han Zhan. \u201cHan Zhan, is the date on?\u201d\n Looking at that clean and slender arm of the young lady, Han Zhan\u2019s frown visibly relaxed. He reluctantly sent his left hand into Song Ci\u2019s hand and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like you to dress up like this outside.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay if we\u2019re at home?\u201d Song Ci understood what he had meant and pulled a naughty smile to tease Han Zhan. \u201cThey said that men like women who were demure, understanding, and gentle with clothes on, but were good in all sorts of positions after taking off their clothes. Does Brother Han agree with this?\u201d\n This statement was full of traps\u2014it would really be dumb of Han Zhan to answer. He changed the topic. \u201cIt\u2019s sunny outside, let\u2019s get into the car.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get into the car.\u201d Song Ci raised her brow. It was a vehicle, but Song Ci could make it sound like something else\u2014she was indeed talented.\n Han Zhan brought Song Ci into his car, drove out of the Crouching Dragon Building, and drove towards the Three Bridges District of Wangdong City. Only after joining the traffic did Han Zhan ask Song Ci, \u201cHow did you know I\u2019m at the Crouching Dragon Building?\u201d\n Song Ci acted mysteriously. \u201cI\u2019m not an ignorant fairy. I know all the secrets of your mortal world.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cOh really?\u201d He doubted it.\n Song Ci said proudly, \u201cBut of course.\u201d\n \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to test you.\u201d\n \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cHow many strands of hair do I have?\u201d\n Song Ci widened her eyes. What kind of question was that?\n Seeing that Song Ci was speechless, Han Zhan laughed joyfully. \u201cLook, even a fairy has her ignorant moments.\u201d\n It bummed Song Ci out. She pouted and felt slightly down.\n Han Zhan thought Song Ci was sleepy and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a thin blanket on the backseat. Be sure to cover yourself if you\u2019re going to sleep.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy.\u201d Song Ci shook her head and sat up straight. She said, \u201cNot only do I know that Huiteng Car Corporation is your asset, but I also know that Sheng Hui Technology Company, Jetta Hotel Chain, and Oriental Real Estate Group will all eventually be in your hands.\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brow and had a surprised look in his eyes but didn\u2019t deny her words.\n Song Ci pretended to sigh dramatically. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve married a rich husband. What should I do to capture his heart?\u201d\n Han Zhan heartlessly said, \u201cTo capture one\u2019s heart, you must first capture his appetite. Based on your culinary skills... fat hope.\u201d\n Song Ci was laughing from anger. \u201cLook for someone with good culinary skills then.\u201d She crossed her slender legs and boasted, \u201cIf someone has good culinary skills, she won\u2019t be better looking than me. If someone\u2019s better looking than me, she won\u2019t be more flirty than me.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at Song Ci\u2019s long legs and actually couldn\u2019t retort.\n Song Ci realized that Han Zhan was secretly looking at her legs. She pretended to casually straighten her spine. Her seductive figure from the side made it hard for one to resist the temptation.\n Song Ci was flaunting happily when Han Zhan suddenly retrieved the thin blanket from the back and threw it over her, covering her legs. Han Zhan was expressionless as he said, \u201cStop being slutty. You can sleep or shut up.\u201d\n Song Ci clenched the thin blanket and bared her teeth at him.\n The Three Bridges District was very packed. Han Zhan drove the car to an underground carpark of a shopping center where he parked his car. He then took the lift with Song Ci. Standing at the lobby of the shopping center\u2019s ground floor, Han Zhan stared at the myriad of branded skincare counters and looked down. He asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat do you want to have for dinner?\u201d\n Personally, Han Zhan rarely ate out and didn\u2019t know much about the restaurants near the Three Bridges District.\n However, Song Ci was a regular in the past. She knew of a popular French restaurant that was once one of the top 10 restaurants in Asia. However, it was slightly expensive.\n \u201cCan you accept spending 3,200 yuan on a dinner for two?\u201d Song Ci asked Han Zhan. She had reserved a dinner for two at 3,200 yuan, and thinking about Han Zhan\u2019s thrifty lifestyle, she wasn\u2019t sure if he will spend there.\n Hearing this, Han Zhan was left stunned at first. When he knew about Song Ci\u2019s reason behind asking this, his expression turned solemn as he told her, \u201cSong Ci, you don\u2019t have to give in to me. Remember, you\u2019re you first before being my wife. It\u2019s the most important that you be yourself.\u201d\n Song Ci heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go for dinner at Deep Alley tonight.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t disagree. He had also been to that restaurant before with a friend and remembered that the ambiance, service, and food were of the best quality over there.\n Song Ci looked at her wristwatch. It was not 5 P.M. yet. Since it had been a long time since Song Ci came over and her money seemed screaming to be spent, she said, \u201cMy reservation is at 6 P.M. and it isn\u2019t 5 P.M. yet. Let\u2019s shop around Broadwalk Street first?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n At this point, the huge screen on the tallest building on Broadwalk Street was playing a certain female singer\u2019s promotional video for her concert. Song Ci and many others stopped in their tracks and looked up at the woman in the video.\n In the video, a woman in an impressive figure was wearing a silver long dress and standing on the deck of a cruise. The sea breeze made her gorgeous curly hair dance as sunlight shone on her face. It was a beautiful scene with a gorgeous woman.\n The woman was holding a microphone framed with diamonds, and she was humming a tune. Along with the wind, her singing voice danced its way into everyone\u2019s ears. That voice was extremely penetrative\u2014like a siren sitting alone on a rock in the dark of the night, giving one goosebump upon hearing it.\n nd of November, Du Xueyan will see you at the Wangdong City concert\u2014be there or be square!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "58": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-58\n\n Chapter 58: He is Han Zhan, My Husband  Du Xueyan, 31 years old, was the first Chinese female singer nominated for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n Even being nominated alone was already very outstanding.\n \u201cIt\u2019s Du Xueyan!\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t conceal her surprised tone.\n Song Ci pulled Han Zhan\u2019s arm and spoke with excitement. \u201cBrother Han, it\u2019s Du Xueyan\u2014she\u2019s coming to Wangdong City for her concert! I wonder if I could lay my hands on a ticket.\u201d\n Only after hearing Song Ci making a big fuss, did Han Zhan raise his head to look at the publicity video that was playing on the screen. He reacted mildly and looked at the siren-like Du Xueyan\u2019s eyes like she was a normal person.\n He pulled Song Ci to somewhere with fewer crowds. When the surrounding sounds became gradually softer, Han Zhan suddenly asked Song Ci, \u201cYou like Du Xueyan?\u201d\n Song Ci was staring at a bubble tea shop ahead. Upon hearing Han Zhan\u2019s question, she nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of her work since 6 to 7 years ago and have bought every one of her albums.\u201d\n Song Ci pulled Han Zhan towards the bubble tea shop. As they walked, she asked, \u201cBrother Han, have you heard any of Du Xueyan\u2019s songs?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s tone was slightly cold. \u201cI haven\u2019t listened to them before on purpose, but somehow I always hear it everywhere.\u201d Du Xueyan was too famous, and many cafes and entertainment venues along the streets preferred to play her songs.\n \u201cThen how do you feel about her songs?\u201d\n Han Zhan commented earnestly, \u201cRather good.\u201d\n Song Ci pointed to above and said, \u201cI, Song Ci, only admit that Du Xueyan is prettier than me.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at the woman on the enormous screen, looked at Song Ci again, and then shook his head. \u201cNot really.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly pleased. \u201cOh, does Brother Han think I\u2019m prettier than Du Xueyan?\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly stared at Song Ci\u2019s facial features, which made Song Ci feel slightly uneasy. But she didn\u2019t avoid it and generously let Han Zhan size her up.\n Song Ci\u2019s looks were lovely and charming. With her slightly deep-set eyes, she looked slightly like a mixed-blood upon closer look. Her eyes were thin and long with hidden double eyelids\u2014any eye makeup could make her be the center of attention.\n She was born with superior looks with her prominent nose and red lips.\n \u201cYou\u2019re more good-looking than her.\u201d\n Song Ci was overjoyed hearing such praise from Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han has great taste. Let\u2019s give your Stepford wife a bubble tea treat!\u201d\n The bubble tea shop was very busy, and both only managed to buy bubble tea after queuing up for a rather long time. Han Zhan bought a room-temperature milk tea and passed it to Song Ci. \u201cYou can\u2019t take cold drinks now. I got you a room-temperature one.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t mind either. She received the milk tea and asked Han Zhan, \u201cYou\u2019re not drinking?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not used to drinking it.\u201d\n Song Ci muttered something along the lines of being old-fashioned before opening the milk tea and drinking it. She had drunk two mouthfuls before she excitedly took out her phone, took a photo, and uploaded it to her social media. After that, Song Ci passed the milk tea to Han Zhan. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d\n Han Zhan grabbed the cup that she passed over and was left slightly puzzled. He asked, \u201cHaven\u2019t you been grumbling that you wanted to drink milk tea? That\u2019s all you\u2019re having?\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her stomach and said, \u201cToo much of it makes me fat. I only need to pretend to drink it on social media.\u201d\n Han Zhan really couldn\u2019t understand young ladies\u2019 thoughts these days. Based on his non-wastage principle, Han Zhan finished the more than half cup of milk tea Song Ci left. Only after that did they go to the restaurant\u2014the timing was just right.\n Deep Alley restaurant had an excellent reputation and steep prices. Those who went there had no lack of cash to spare.\n The top debutante was a social butterfly with friends everywhere. Song Ci knew most of the notable personalities and wealthy people in Wangdong City. Once Song Ci and Han Zhan entered the restaurant, someone recognized them.\n \u201cMiss Song!\u201d A long-haired lady in a light blue tube dress called out to Song Ci, and she even waved.\n Han Zhan looked down and asked Song Ci, \u201cYou know her?\u201d\n Song Ci replied, \u201cYup. I already know three people in this restaurant alone.\u201d\n Holding Han Zhan\u2019s hand, Song Ci walked up to that girl and hugged her hypocritically. \u201cMiss Jin, what a coincidence\u2014are you guys also here for a meal today?\u201d Miss Jin was the eldest daughter of the Jin family. Her name was Jin Feng, and her background was comparable to that of the Mu Family.\n Miss Jin was above average-looking but paled compared to Song Ci.\n Women most of the time were jealous of others. On the surface, they were all friendly with Song Ci but spoke ill of her behind her back. However, since they had bumped into each other, they could only put up an act as they smiled and hugged each other in a laughable manner.\n \u201cYup. Dongfang said that this restaurant is not bad and brought me here to try it.\u201d Upon saying this, she exchanged flirty glances with a handsome man beside them.\n Song Ci saw everything.\n The rumors appeared to be true\u2014Miss Jin was involved with the Second Young Master Dongfang.\n Miss Jin touched Song Ci\u2019s neck brace and asked about her health. \u201cI heard that you were involved in an accident some time back. Hope it isn\u2019t serious. How much longer do you have to wear this neck brace for?\u201d\n \u201cStill gotta wear it for 2 to 3 weeks.\u201d Saying that Song Ci glanced over at Jin Feng\u2019s date once again.\n There was a saying that everyone was equal, but there were various grades. This was exceptionally true in Wangdong City.\n There was naturally no lack of rich people in the bustling Wangdong City, but even the rich had different levels. For example, it could be considered that the Mu and Jin families are third-grade families, while the Dongfang Family was a level higher, a second-grade family.\n The truly top-grade families were like the Cheng Family of the Chuan Dong Group, as well as the Zhong Family of Ming Tai International.\n The Second Young Master of the Dongfang Family was dressed smartly, and the watch on his wrist was worth as much as Han Zhan\u2019s Volvo. Seeing that Song Ci had glanced at him, the Dongfang Second Young Master nodded and said to Song Ci, \u201cMiss Song and Xiao-Feng are good friends, so why don\u2019t we join tables?\u201d\n Jin Feng turned sideways and looked at Song Ci. Her face was smiling, but her eyes said otherwise. This lady wasn\u2019t willing to join tables with Song Ci. She was fishing for a man, and Song Ci had no business to do here.\n Song Ci was a social expert and rejected the Dongfang Second Young Master gently. \u201cMaybe next time, I have a date with someone today.\u201d\n Hearing this, Jin Feng heaved a sigh of relief. However, the Dongfang Second Young Master shifted his glance to Han Zhan. He really couldn\u2019t match Han Zhan\u2019s face to any of those in the wealthy families that he knew. \u201cThis gentleman is?\u201d\n However, a man who could appear in a high-class restaurant with Song Ci couldn\u2019t be an ordinary man. Although the Dongfang Second Young Master didn\u2019t know Han Zhan, he wouldn\u2019t belittle him for the fear of offending some mysterious big boss.\n \u201cMiss Song, aren\u2019t you going to introduce to us this handsome man beside you?\u201d Miss Jin smiled radiantly at Song Ci.\n They were curious about Han Zhan\u2019s identity.\n Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm and introduced him proudly to Miss Jin. \u201cHe is Han Zhan, my husband.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s last statement caused a stir. The smile on Miss Jin\u2019s face disappeared, and the Dongfang Second Young Master\u2019s gaze was also stunned.\n \u201cHusband...\u201d Miss Jin said, stunned, \u201cSong Ci, you\u2019re married!\u201d She even stopped addressing her as \u2018Miss Song,\u2019 which showed just how shocked Miss Jin was.\n Miss Jin\u2019s shriek attracted all the customers\u2019 glances.\n This was exactly what Song Ci wanted.\n She raised her left hand, smiled slightly, and said, \u201cYup, I\u2019m married.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "59": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-59\n\n Chapter 59: A Year\u2019s Worth of Sleeping Funds  Leaning onto Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder, a blissful smile appeared on Song Ci\u2019s face. She lovingly said, \u201cI also didn\u2019t expect myself to get married so soon, but since I met the right one, I couldn\u2019t bear to give it a miss.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at the acting queen beside her. No one knew what she was thinking.\n Miss Jin tried her best to tidy up her expression and said rather awkwardly, \u201cMiss Song is right. It\u2019s tough to meet a good person, and it is a great fortune to meet one.\u201d As she spoke, she glanced lovingly at the Dongfang Second Young Master.\n However, the Dongfang Second Young Master didn\u2019t notice Miss Jin\u2019s glance. Instead, he smiled and asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhere is Mr. Han from? I\u2019ve never seen you before\u2014you must not be from Wangdong City.\u201d\n Han Zhan finally spoke. His voice was deep, casual yet dependable, and gave one goosebump. \u201cI\u2019m from Shunchen City, but work at Wangdong City.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d The Dongfang Second Young Master asked again, \u201cI wonder where Mr. Han is working at?\u201d His gaze towards Han Zhan deepened. Could this Han Zhan be a big boss over at Shunchen City?\n Han Zhan said in neither arrogant nor inferior manner, \u201cI\u2019m a staff of Zeus Airlines and work alongside Li Li.\u201d\n Zeus Airlines was the new enterprise with the most potential in Wangdong City. Li Li frequently appeared in public places, and everyone knew him. Han Zhan often appeared alongside Li Li and people also saw him, but they didn\u2019t know his identity.\n When Han Zhan said that he worked alongside Li Li, the Dongfang Second Young Master instinctively understood as him working for Li Li and was his subordinate.\n \u201cOh, Li Li...\u201d Once the Dongfang Second Young Master heard that he was a nobody working under Li Li, he looked at Han Zhan with less passion in his eyes and his tone also became slightly colder. However, he had concealed these changes well and ordinary people wouldn\u2019t be able to tell.\n However, Han Zhan had been through a lot and had eyes as sharp as an eagle. He saw how the Dongfang Second Young Master\u2019s attitude changed.\n As the second young master of the Dongfang Family, he was so short-sighted. It was no wonder that after developing in Wangdong City for a few decades, the Dongfang Family remained as a second-grade family and couldn\u2019t be compared to the Cheng Family.\n Han Zhan had also met the first young master of the Cheng Family, Cheng Yanmo. In comparison with the Dongfang\u2019s Second Young Master, in terms of both his words and actions and his horizon, Cheng Yanmo was far superior.\n Miss Jin thought along the same lines as the Dongfang Second Young Master and thought that Han Zhan was Li Li\u2019s subordinate. She looked at Song Ci with a strange glint.\n Song Ci was the top debutante, a well-known social butterfly of Wangdong City, and was an expert at social interactions. She seemed friendly but was arrogant. The few men close to Song Ci were all outstanding personalities, so how could such a woman who loved power marry a nobody?\n Since she couldn\u2019t make sense of it, Miss Jin assumed love blinded Song Ci.\n At this point, the waiter walked up to the table that Song Ci reserved. Seeing this, Song Ci said to Miss Jin, \u201cMiss Jin, excuse me.\u201d\n Miss Jin had yet to recover from the news of Song Ci\u2019s marriage and merely nodded upon hearing this. \u201cOkay, see you again.\u201d\n Song Ci pulled Han Zhan over to their seats and sat down.\n The waiter poured red wine for them. Han Zhan held the wineglass, took a whiff, and suddenly said, \u201cThere\u2019s a huge plot of land in my hometown. My grandfather planted grapes all over it. This year, they\u2019ve produced quite a lot of red wine and Grandpa got Uncle Zhong to send me a bottle.\u201d\n Saying that, Han Zhan took a sip of red wine, and with a disappointed look, he said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t as nice as our homemade.\u201d\n \u201cAre there many people who want to drink your grandfather\u2019s wine?\u201d Song Ci asked, even though she knew that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t exaggerating. Just how valuable was it to drink wine that Old Mr. Han produced?\n Han Zhan nodded in acknowledgment of Song Ci\u2019s words. He told her, \u201cIf you wish to drink it, go ahead.\u201d\n \u201cIt will be my honor.\u201d\n Song Ci knew that Han Zhan was a carnivore. In consideration that Han Zhan had a huge appetite, Song Ci ordered a Tomahawk steak set meal. The starter and French bread were delicious\u2014although Han Zhan only liked meat, he also ate a few pieces of bread.\n When they served the meat, Han Zhan cut a piece of the most tender part of the meat for Song Ci.\n \u201cIt\u2019s too much, I can\u2019t finish it,\u201d Song Ci said. Her image as an idol burdened her, and she was always afraid of putting on weight.\n Han Zhan gave her an overbearing gaze that didn\u2019t tolerate any rejection. Han Zhan looked at those slender arms and waist of Song Ci. He was afraid that he would easily crush her. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to have my baby?\u201d\n \u201cEat more and prepare to nourish my baby in advance. My baby will be like me and will have a big appetite.\u201d Han Zhan had a huge appetite\u2014for the same bowl of rice, Song Ci would be 70% full with half a bowl, but Han Zhan could eat 3 bowls.\n There was a reason for his tall height.\n From time to time, the other diners in the restaurant would glance over at Han Zhan and Song Ci. Seeing that Han Zhan had wolfed everything down and didn\u2019t even leave a crumb of bread on his plate, everyone frowned.\n What was someone with such a big appetite doing in a western restaurant? Shouldn\u2019t he just directly go for street food?\n Many Chinese people, especially those in the upper class, held the western culture in high regard. Somehow, they felt that western food was meant to be eaten slowly, that if one finished it to the last bit was embarrassing.\n However, they didn\u2019t understand the concept that each grain of rice resulted from hard labor and didn\u2019t agree with being proud of finishing all the food on one\u2019s plate.\n After finishing everything, Han Zhan was finally good. \u201cYou bought the ring. I\u2019ll treat this meal.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe next time\u2014I\u2019ve already paid during reservation.\u201d\n \u201c... alright then.\u201d\n As a man, the woman bought the wedding rings and also treated the meal on their first date. After leaving the restaurant, Han Zhan kept thinking about this and felt even more like a freeloader.\n He suddenly whipped out his wallet, took out a bank card, and passed it to Song Ci. \u201cThis is my supplementary card, you can use it.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t take it. She squinted at that card and asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s the credit limit?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cA billion yuan.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n She finally understood the joy of those young ladies looking for rich old men.\n However, she wasn\u2019t happy.\n \u201cI\u2019ll take the card.\u201d Song Ci pretended to be calm while accepting Han Zhan\u2019s card and said, \u201cAfter all, after I get pregnant, everything from prenatal checkups, giving birth, and buying stuff all needs money.\u201d\n Han Zhan corrected Song Ci\u2019s statement. \u201cThe money isn\u2019t for you to do prenatal checkups and for the baby.\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cThen what is it for?\u201d She worked up a smile and laughed mockingly, \u201cA year\u2019s worth of sleeping funds?\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan was first stunned, and then his face darkened. Song Ci saw that Han Zhan was unhappy and knew that her statement triggered him. She hurriedly shut up and didn\u2019t dare to be full of it anymore.\n The atmosphere between both suddenly turned awkward.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to look at Han Zhan, so she looked up at those dreamy lights on the buildings.\n Han Zhan was the first to apologize. \u201cSong Ci, I\u2019m not using money to humiliate you. If my action of giving you my bank card caused such a misunderstanding from you, I apologize for my action.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "60": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-60\n\n Chapter 60: Just Make Use of Me  Only after hearing Han Zhan\u2019s apology did Song Ci retract her gaze.\n She looked at Han Zhan\u2019s face and said, \u201cJust now when you gave me the card, my face felt hot, as if I\u2019d just been slapped by someone. I felt like burying myself in a hole.\u201d\n Han Zhan wanted to explain again, but Song Ci inched even closer to him. She placed her index finger on Han Zhan\u2019s lips and stopped his unspoken words.\n Han Zhan looked puzzled, not knowing what exactly Song Ci wanted to do.\n Song Ci started sizing Han Zhan up.\n Han Zhan had always had a clear conscience. When he was younger, he had served the army and his country. After that, he had founded Zeus Airlines, becoming the boss of a company and providing jobs with rather good incomes to a few thousand employees. Regardless of where and when, he was always doing something beneficial for the country and people, so he had always held his head high. On the other hand, while Song Ci looked famous on the surface, she felt extremely inferior.\n Instantly, Song Ci suddenly wanted to pour out her thoughts.\n Song Ci retracted her finger, looked straight at Han Zhan, and said, \u201cAs a woman, I played up to a man, seeking your protection and help\u2014this is already pathetic on its own. Han Zhan, I can hold my head up high in front of anyone, but before you, I can\u2019t be proud.\u201d\n From the time Song Ci used her biggest secret in exchange for Han Zhan\u2019s trust and being together with him, she had already placed all of her pride under Han Zhan for him to step on at will.\n Regardless of how unruly she acted in front of Han Zhan these days, she always respected and feared Han Zhan. She never dared to go against him and always obeyed him in everything\u2014from what she ate to what she wore.\n When Han Zhan heard these words that came from the bottom of Song Ci\u2019s heart, surprise was written all over him. The Song Ci that he saw was always chirpy, cheerful, someone who liked to tease him, and always chuckled when he appeared to be distressed. Han Zhan never knew that in their relationship, Song Ci placed herself at such a low position.\n Song Ci added, \u201cHan Zhan, if circumstances were different, and if I wasn\u2019t stuck in the mire and was just me\u2014that pretty, lovely, and lively Song Ci who many courted\u2014I\u2019ll not beg you to marry me.\u201d\n A dreamy look appeared on her porcelain fair skin as she smiled, She said, \u201cFor me, I\u2019ll be like every girl who seeks love courageously\u2014to get to know you openly, get hooked up with you, and have an equal love relationship with you. Instead of the way things are now where I\u2019m pretending to tease you without restraint, but fearing that you\u2019ll turn your back on me more than anything.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s smile became self-deprecating. \u201cHowever, I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m unable to protect my sister well. I can only hide her up. I can only stick onto you like a maggot and feast on your blood and flesh at will.\u201d\n She was like a parasite. Without Han Zhan, she would die in an instant.\n \u201cHan Zhan, I feel like I\u2019m treading on a thin line\u2014I can\u2019t turn back nor collapse. Once I collapse, Mu Mian will make sure I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not as strong as I appear to be. I\u2019m heartless. I\u2019m afraid of dying. I\u2019m afraid of you dumping me.\u201d\n \u201cI won\u2019t dump you, \u201d Han Zhan interrupted her. His tone was as serious as if he was making a promise.\n Song Ci was slightly stunned and moved.\n Since he was such a good person, she felt that she was even more inferior. Song Ci suddenly asked Han Zhan, \u201cHan Zhan, do you know what\u2019s an angelic bitch?\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned slightly and hesitated if he should answer this question.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI\u2019m an angelic bitch, a manipulative dog.\u201d\n Upon hearing Song Ci used such terms to describe herself, Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached slightly. \u201cSong Ci, don\u2019t demean yourself like this.\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan, do you want to know the real me?\u201d Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s left hand and placed it on her chest. She mustered up the courage, tore away her mask, revealed her hypocritical and pathetic side, and said,\n \u201cI was unhappy with that job you gave me\u2014it\u2019s overbearing and unreasonable! However, to get close to you, I had no choice but to give in.\n \u201cWhen we came back from our work trip in Shunchen City, I had purposely stood by the roadside and waited for you to fetch me. I left my car in the garage at the airport. I\u2019ve purposely plotted to seduce you.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t love you. However, to please you and make you happy so I can stabilize my position as Mrs. Han, I will keep telling you I love you without guilt.\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan, do you understand? From the first time I saw you in the interview room, I had ulterior motives towards you and wanted to make use of you to deal with Mu Mian!\u201d\n \u201cThis is the real me\u2014despicable, ugly, and selfish!\u201d\n Only after saying everything in one breath did Song Ci realize that she was so worked up that she was shivering.\n \u201cThis is how miserable I am.\u201d\n After saying that and seeing that Han Zhan had pursed his thin lips, Song Ci\u2019s heart pounded. Her legs were also slightly weak, yet she held onto Han Zhan\u2019s hand and didn\u2019t dare to let go.\n Learning that she was a scheming and cunning woman, did Han Zhan also detest her now? Song Ci looked down and didn\u2019t dare to look straight at Han Zhan. She felt very uneasy.\n \u201cHan Zhan, are you afraid of such a despicable me?\u201d Do you not want me anymore?\n A huge arm suddenly grabbed Song Ci. Shortly after, Han Zhan embraced her.\n Realizing that Han Zhan was hugging her, Song Ci was lost.\n Han Zhan\u2019s deep and violin-like voice rang gently from the top of her head. \u201cIf what you said is true, then you\u2019re a scheming bitch. However, you had to both put up a guard against Mu Mian and please me at the same time, it must have been hard on you.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n She secretly held onto Han Zhan\u2019s suit around his waist area and remained silent.\n \u201cSong Ci, how did you know I don\u2019t have any ulterior motives by keeping you too?\u201d A passionate and beautiful woman got close to a single thirty years old, and he was a handicapped man. Han Zhan wasn\u2019t any saint who could resist it.\n He had no control of his lower body.\n As he looked at Song Ci, he wanted to possess her.\n \u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty towards me. Please, just make use of me.\u201d Han Zhan kissed her hair and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid that I\u2019ll dump you. You\u2019re the woman who\u2019s written on my account. I, Han Zhan, will never abandon someone who belongs to me.\u201d\n \u201cEven if you don\u2019t love me, there\u2019s no need to lie to me. With frequent exposure, I won\u2019t be able to tell the lies from the truths either. You can just stay comfortably in your position as Mrs. Han. No one can take that away.\u201d\n Upon hearing Han Zhan\u2019s reply, Song Ci, who was on tenterhooks, heaved a sigh of relief and slumped weakly into Han Zhan\u2019s arms. \u201cBrother Han, let me lean onto you for a while, I can\u2019t feel my legs anymore.\u201d\n The shoulders of the woman in his arms were shaking. Realizing that Song Ci was crying, Han Zhan instinctively adjusted to protect her face well.\n Many people walked past them, but nobody knew that the top debutante was crying in his arms.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "61": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-61\n\n Chapter 61: A Serious Question  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes were slightly swollen by the time she got home. She was embarrassed to even look at Han Zhan. After all, she was an angelic bitch.\n Song Ci took a shower, changed her clothes, and put on a facial mask to reduce swelling.\n It was 9.30pm and Han Zhan was about to take a shower and sleep. He saw Song Ci lying in bed with her face covered with a facial mask and her eyes closed. Thinking that she couldn\u2019t see, he didn\u2019t hide away and directly took off his clothes to take a shower.\n Hearing the sound of water, Song Ci\u2019s face felt slightly warm under the mask.\n Was he going to shower just like that?\n As long as she opened her eyes, Song Ci would be able to see Han Zhan naked. Should I take a look? Song Ci wanted to look but felt that it was impolite. On second thought, she and Han Zhan would sleep together sooner or later. It would be the same, no matter if she looked at him earlier or later, but it would be a waste not to look!\n After thinking it through, Song Ci immediately opened her eyes and leaned against the bedside to admire Han Zhan.\n The steam rose from the bathroom and a thin layer of mist covered the transparent tea-colored glass. Han Zhan\u2019s legs were covered by the mist and she couldn\u2019t see clearly, but Song Ci knew that there were many big and small wounds on Han Zhan, and there was no chance to count them all.\n What did he do as a soldier in the past? With so many injuries, he was obviously no ordinary soldier.\n Song Ci fell into deep thought. By the time she snapped out of her trance, she saw that Han Zhan had already turned around. He was standing behind the glass, wiping away a part of the water mist in front of him. A pair of gray-blue eyes was staring straight at Song Ci through the transparent glass.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t expect Song Ci to be so lecherous as to peek at him bathing. Han Zhan was slightly surprised, upon catching her cheap shot.\n Having been discovered, Song Ci hurriedly got out of bed and ran into the toilet to wash off her facial mask.\n By the time she came out after completing her skincare routine, Han Zhan was already lying down on the bed in his pyjamas. \u201c9: 58 P.M.\u201d Han Zhan glanced at Song Ci and said, \u201cGet into bed, I\u2019m going to turn off the light.\u201d He didn\u2019t pursue the fact that she had peeked at him, allowing Song Ci to heave a sigh of relief.\n Song Ci hurriedly climbed into bed and laid down beside Han Zhan.\n Pa!\n The lights were off.\n The electric curtains covering the French windows started to close, making a sliding sound. The room was instantly plunged into complete darkness.\n Song Ci admired Han Zhan\u2019s good sleeping habits, as she couldn\u2019t fall asleep at all. Song Ci suddenly turned over and poked Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder with her index finger. \u201cBrother Han, are you asleep?\u201d\n Han Zhan opened his eyes and looked into the darkness.\n \u201cNot yet.\u201d There was a young lady lying beside him, and Han Zhan was no gentleman, so how could he fall asleep? This was especially so since this young lady was drooling over his body.\n Song Ci\u2019s fingers moved restlessly to Han Zhan\u2019s face and finally stopped at his rather high nose. Like making a glutinous rice ball, she rubbed Han Zhan\u2019s nose with her fingers. \u201cI have a question that I would like to seek guidance from you.\u201d\n Since she had already used the words \u2018to seek guidance\u2019, it must be something major.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cSpeak.\u201d His nose felt slightly itchy and he wanted to scratch it.\n Song Ci pointed out very seriously. \u201cYou said we have to go to bed at 10pm, right? Then, when are we going to have sex in the future? We can\u2019t always have sex before 10pm, right? What if it happens to be 10pm and we\u2019re still not done? What should we do? Turn off the lights and sleep? Or continue fighting after 6.30am the next morning?\u201d\n This was an especially serious question.\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Song Ci pouted again. \u201cThis is a big deal. It concerns the survival of your child.\u201d\n Han Zhan took Song Ci\u2019s index finger and clenched it tightly with his left hand. He then said, \u201cIt depends on the situation. We can delay our bedtime if you wish.\u201d\n Song Ci heaved a sigh of relief. \u201c...Oh, that\u2019s good.\u201d\n Song Ci had cried today and was slightly fatigued, so she fell asleep not long after laying beside Han Zhan. After she fell asleep, her index finger was not as stiff as before and it rested gently on Han Zhan\u2019s palm.\n Still holding that finger, Han Zhan thought in a daze, What\u2019s in this Song Ci\u2019s head?\n Song Ci was asleep and her soft snores were regular, but Han Zhan couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\n The next morning, Song Ci woke up the moment her alarm rang. She turned it off, got out of bed barefooted, went straight to the toilet, washed her face, and brought different bottles to Han Zhan\u2019s meeting room. She occupied his table and chair, and started putting on makeup.\n Downstairs, Han Zhan was leaning against the wall when his cell phone suddenly lit up.\n He supported himself with his right hand and picked up his cell phone with his left. Song Ci: Should we add a dressing table to our house?\n Han Zhan replied: Okay.\n After Song Ci finished putting on her makeup, she chose a red off shoulder dress from the clothes she brought over, and placed a black and white camellia brooch at her slender waist.\n Han Zhan was stir-frying rice in the kitchen. Hearing the sound of high heels, he turned off the stove and looked back at the stairs.\n Han Zhan was stunned when he saw Song Ci.\n Song Ci was dressed very flashily and beautifully today. Her 7cm high heels accentuated her tall and slender figure. Her short, burgundy hair was done in a simple style with a curler bar, and a pair of black gemstone earrings adorned her lovely earlobes.\n Why did she dress so nicely?\n Han Zhan looked away and placed the fried rice on two plates.\n He placed the fried rice on the dining table and turned around to see Song Ci holding her cell phone, as if she was taking a photo. Han Zhan was amused. \u201cTaking selfies again?\u201d Beautiful girls all seemed to love taking photos.\n Song Ci said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m taking a photo of you.\u201d\n Han Zhan, \u201cMmm?\u201d\n He walked over and snatched Song Ci\u2019s cell phone away. He looked down and saw that she had really taken a photo of him.\n Any photo taken of a good-looking person would be very eye-catching. Moreover, Han Zhan was tall and his figure was comparable to that of a supermodel. Song Ci\u2019s photo-taking skills were good to begin with, and in the photo she took, Han Zhan was handsome and charming.\n It had been a long time since Han Zhan had taken such a lively photo, causing him to be momentarily dazed. So I\u2019m like this in Song Ci\u2019s eyes?\n \u201cWhy are you taking photos of me?\u201d\n Song Ci snatched her phone back and asked Han Zhan politely, \u201cCan I post it on my Weibo?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that your male fans will be upset?\u201d Due to Li Li\u2019s constant chatter, Han Zhan knew that Song Ci was a major influencer with over 2,000,000 fans,male fans as many as female fans.\n Song Ci said nonchalantly, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? I\u2019ve already hooked up with Wangdong City\u2019s future richest man. Who cares about what others think?\u201d\n Hearing this straightforward statement, Han Zhan was momentarily surprised. Song Ci knew what Han Zhan was thinking and said, \u201cI am speaking from the bottom of my heart. I am just that realistic. Last night, you said that I can stop saying such hypocritical things.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Han Zhan was not angry. Instead, he patted Song Ci\u2019s head and said, \u201cVery good, be yourself.\u201d\n Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm. She looked up and met Han Zhan\u2019s accommodating eyes. Her heart suddenly thumped. \u201cHan Zhan, you\u2019re so good to me. If I really fall in love with you and refuse to leave you after a year, what should I do?\u201d\n Han Zhan thought for a moment and said, \u201cI\u2019m a luxury good. It depends on whether you have the capability to have me.\u201d\n Song Ci pursed her lips. \u201cLook at how smug you are. I am a frequent customer of luxury goods.\u201d Feeling that something was off about that statement, Song Ci was silent for a moment, before complaining softly. \u201cWhy does it sound like I am visiting a brothel?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s brows twitched. He felt like hitting someone.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

After breakfast, Han Zhan went to work. Song Ci walked into the kitchen with a glass in hand and instinctively opened the refrigerator to pour herself a glass of ice water. She thought of something, closed the refrigerator door, turned around, walked to the water dispenser, and took a glass of warm water.\n Holding the glass of warm water, she walked up to the French window and sat down cross-legged,, before opening the local forum.\n All this while, Song Ci had been the hottest topic on the forum. The moment she entered the forum, she saw three to four posts related to her. The headlines were all more sensational than the other.\n Shocking! Top socialite, Song Ci, is married and her husband is a handicapped man!\n Shocking news: Song Ci was married to neither the Chuan Dong Second Young Master nor the gossip target Yan Jiang, but...\n Logically speaking, why would the top socialite marry a nobody? Was it because of love or because of her looks?\n Song Ci stared at those posts and smiled.\n Every single one of them could be made up.\n Song Ci clicked on # Shocking! Top socialite Song Ci is married and her husband is a tenth-grade handicapped person! She started to read the # threads with interest.\n The person who posted it was called \u201cWorld\u2019s Edge Record\u201d. He had been in the discussion forums all year round. He was a very picky person and loved to dig up all sorts of absurd and ridiculous things that happened between the wealthy and famous ladies of Wangdong City. He was especially devoted to Song Ci and would release a post about her every now and then.\n Thanks to him, Song Ci was now the top debutante on the forum. It could be said that the reason why Song Ci could become Wangdong City\u2019s top socialite was because of \u2018World\u2019s Edge Record\u2019.\n The first time Song Ci saw \u2018World\u2019s Edge Record\u2019 expose her dirt, she was so angry that her lungs were about to explode. As \u2018World\u2019s Edge Record\u2019 had dirtied her too many times, Song Ci actually felt a sense of relief that said, \u201cOld friend, you really won\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d, now that she saw his post.\n This time, \u2018World\u2019s Edge Record\u2019 didn\u2019t disappoint her yet again. He was the first to jump out and dig up the details behind Song Ci\u2019s marriage.\n Although Song Ci was not in the entertainment circles, she was much more famous in Wangdong City than those celebrities. This post had already been pushed to the top of the forum by netizens, and there were thousands of comments below. Song Ci\u2019s popularity on the forum made the crowd green with envy and jealousy.\n On the first page of the post, there was a caption:\n Shocking!\n Top socialite Song Ci is actually married.\n Just last night, several people had seen Song Ci appear at Deep Alley restaurant holding the hand of a mysterious man. What was surprising was that she was wearing a wedding ring on her ring finger, and it matched with the ring on the ring finger of the man that was with her!\n Who did you think she married?\n Chuan Dong Big Boss? Chuan Dong Second Boss? Male celebrity YJ? Chao Yang\u2019s top management?\n Wrong, wrong! All wrong!\n Unexpectedly, Song Ci, with very high expectations, actually married a tenth-grade disabled person with the last name Han!\n Come, come, let me give everyone some information on this uncle. The reason why we call him uncle is that he is already 32 years old and 10 years older than our socialite!\n Uncle Han is 32 years old and one of the subordinates of the general manager of Zeus Airlines, Li Li. The young man in the middle was Li Li and the tall man standing behind him was Uncle Han.\n Although Uncle Han is a little old, he is really handsome. His blue-grey eyes are rather good looking. In my opinion, just based on looks alone, he can crush Chuan Dong the Second.\n Though this Uncle Han has a promising future working alongside Li Li, there is still a huge gap between him and Chuan Dong Second, who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\n Here comes the main point! Knock on the blackboard!\n After my personal investigation, I found out that this Uncle Han is actually handicapped!\n Everyone, look at the next few photos. Did you realize that in each photo, Uncle Han is wearing a glove on his right hand? Regardless of whether it was spring, summer, autumn, or winter, the glove would never leave his hand.\n Only after asking around, I found out the truth from an insider in their company. It turned out that this Uncle Han is handicapped and had two of his fingers amputated. He probably wore those gloves to cover up his ugliness.\n My humble self is puzzled. How did our socialite get married to a man who was 10 years older than her, had no power or influence, and was handicapped? What did she want from him? Was it really just because of his face?\n Can anyone clarify my doubts?\n Below the post, the comments online were very consistent:\n First page: Damn!\n Second page: Damn!\n Third page: Damn, Song Ci is marrying someone?\n ...\n After reaching the 30th page, the comments gradually returned to normal \u2014\n th page: I have to say, Brother World\u2019s Edge\u2019s revelations are very shocking. Song Ci is actually married, but not to the wealthy and powerful young masters from Chuan Dong, not the most handsome young man in the entertainment circle named YJ, but a nobody! What is she thinking?\n th page: This Uncle Han, does he have another identity? A mysterious big boss pretending to be weak? I feel that a woman like Song Ci wouldn\u2019t marry an ordinary man.\n st page: I know Zeus Airlines\u2019 Li Li. I have seen him a few times due to work-related issues. I have also seen this Uncle Han before. He is a very low-profile person and doesn\u2019t waste food at all. He brings his thermo flask wherever he goes and is very well-nourished, but he doesn\u2019t look like a big boss.\n nd pages: Uncle Han is indeed handsome, but I don\u2019t think he is compatible with Song Ci.\n rd page: Song Ci is a quiet person who does great things. She didn\u2019t disappoint me. Uncle Han is very lucky with women!\n th page: Uncle Han used up his luck from several lifetimes. Damn!\n Song Ci scrolled through over 200 replies but didn\u2019t see any particularly interesting ones. She was about to exit the forum when she saw a long comment at the bottom. The content caught her attention.\n 268th page: I roughly know this Uncle Han. If I\u2019m not mistaken, he should be from Shunchen City. He attended the same high school as me and was two grades above me. At that time, he was the school beau and his girlfriend was also the school belle. The school belle is now part of the entertainment industry, but I won\u2019t say who it is because she\u2019s too famous.Uncle Han\u2019s family background should be average. I didn\u2019t see him use any branded goods when he was still in school. His shoes and clothes are all from ordinary brands. I heard that he joined the army after graduating from high school and should be discharged from the military now. However, it is indeed shocking that Song Ci will fancy him.\n After reading the news, Song Ci couldn\u2019t help but feel curious about the identity of Han Zhan\u2019s high school girlfriend, who was currently in the entertainment industry.\n Who was it?\n Song Ci was prepared to find an opportunity to ask Han Zhan about it.\n Song Ci logged out of the forum and opened Weibo. Only 40 minutes had passed since she posted that post, but there were over 10,000 comments. Song Ci would post on Weibo every two days. She had over 2,000,000 fans, but only a few tens of thousands were really active.\n Each post had an average of 3,000 to 4,000 comments. It was very rare to see comments like the ones on today\u2019s post that had exceeded 10,000 in just 40 minutes.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t read the comments but she could guess what they said.\n Great, now the entire city knows that I\u2019m married.\n Mu Mian should know by now too.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "63": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-63\n\n Chapter 63: Blame  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n After finishing her cup, Song Ci got up to get another cup of water and make chrysanthemum tea. Just then, her cell phone rang.\n Song Ci saw the caller ID and sighed regretfully. It looked like she wouldn\u2019t be able to drink this cup of chrysanthemum tea today. She rinsed the cup and placed it in the cupboard, before answering the call.\n It was her adoptive father, Mu Mian.\n \u201cSong Ci, come to the office. I have something to ask you.\u201d Mu Mian\u2019s voice finally lost its gentlemanliness and was filled with anger from being deceived. Without giving Song Ci a chance to respond, Mu Mian hung up.\n Song Ci had already expected such a scene, so she specially found a domineering red dress and put on makeup for herself, after she woke up early in the morning. Actually, every time Song Ci faced Mu Mian, she would get goosebumps. After all, in her previous life, she and Song Fei both died in his hands.\n Song Ci was petrified of Mu Mian.\n Song Ci called Long Yu and waited for him to reach downstairs before going down.\n Only after Song Ci boarded the car, did Long Yu ask her, \u201cMiss...\u201d Realizing that Song Ci and Han Zhan were already married and it was no longer appropriate to call her Miss Song anymore, Long Yu hurriedly changed his words.\u201d Madam, where are you going? \u201d\n Song Ci was not used to this address, but she had to learn to be Mrs. Han. \u201cGo to Chao Yang Company.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Three Bridges was the commercial-financial district of Wangdong City. The central district was the shopping district, surrounded by companies of all sizes. Chao Yang Company, Chuan Dong Group and Zeus Airlines were all in that district.\n There were only two streets between Chao Yang Company and Zeus Airlines. It was past 9am and there were no traffic jams. The car arrived at Three Bridges after about 40 minutes.\n Seeing that Song Ci was in a daze, Long Yu had no choice but to remind her. \u201cMadam, we have arrived.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. She sat in the car and glanced at the Chao Yang Company\u2019s headquarters through the window. In her previous life, Song Ci had worked at Chao Yang Company for two years. After she got married at 24, she then stayed at home and became a lazy bum.\n Song Ci clenched her fists and told herself that she didn\u2019t need to be afraid anymore. In this life, she had already rejected Mu Mian\u2019s suggestion. She didn\u2019t enter Chao Yang and would eventually become a qualified pilot. She also didn\u2019t need to marry that fool Cheng Ziang. She was already Han Zhan\u2019s wife.\n She would never make the same mistake again!\n Thinking in this manner, Song Ci felt very energized. \u201cBrother Long, come with me.\u201d Song Ci was worried that Mu Mian would attack her in a fit of anger. She had no reason to willingly come over and get slapped by Mu Mian.\n Long Yu replied, \u201cAlright.\u201d\n ...\n Chao Yang Company.\n The secretary knocked on the door of Mu Mian\u2019s office.\n \u201cCEO Mu.\u201d\n Mu Mian had been using his computer to browse through all the gossip posts about Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s marriage on the forums. His expression was very bad. Hearing his secretary\u2019s voice, he looked up unhappily and asked her in an unfriendly tone, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n Everyone in Chao Yang Company knew about Song Ci\u2019s marriage. The secretary seldom saw such a scary expression on Mu Mian\u2019s face and was slightly afraid. She knew that Song Ci must have angered Mu Mian by making the decision to marry Han Zhan on her own, but the secretary mustered up the courage and said, \u201cYour daughter, Miss Song Ci, is here and she\u2019s waiting for you outside.\u201d\n Upon hearing that, Mu Mian\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cLet her in.\u201d\n The secretary hurriedly left. She closed the door, turned around, and said to Song Ci, who was standing in front of the counter, \u201cMs. Song, CEO Mu asked you to come in for a chat.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d\n Song Ci quietly took a deep breath, before entering the office with her head held high, with Long Yu following behind her. Under the puzzled gaze of the secretary, they entered the office together.\n Hearing the sound of high heels clicking on the floor, Mu Mian turned around to look at Song Ci. When he saw the short, plain-looking man behind Song Ci, Mu Mian suddenly frowned and looked even more displeased. \u201cI called you over. Why did you bring an outsider?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cAs I nearly lost my life in the previous accident, Han Zhan was worried that I would be traumatized from driving, so he hired a driver for me. He\u2019s my driver and also my bodyguard, so he naturally has to accompany me.\u201d\n Mu Mian sneered. \u201cHe treats you rather well.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled lightly and said without even blinking, \u201cIf he\u2019s not good to me, I won\u2019t marry him either.\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cYou really married him?\u201d Mu Mian stared at the gold ring on Song Ci\u2019s left hand, and found it an eyesore.\n It was indeed a major taboo for Mu Mian that Song Ci had secretly gotten married to Han Zhan behind his back. Mu Mian was not afraid of Song Ci being mischievous or causing trouble, but he would never allow her to betray him.\n Sneakily taking the household register to register her marriage with Han Zhan was betrayal!\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cWe registered our marriage yesterday.\u201d\n Mu Mian was so angry that he laughed. \u201cVery good, Song Ci. You have grown up and know how to steal the household register to get married!\u201d\n Too many things had happened in the past month. Mu Mian already suspected that Song Ci might have found out something a while back. This time, Song Ci secretly married Han Zhan without informing him, causing Mu Mian to be even more suspicious of her.\n What did she know? How much did she know?\n Mu Mian didn\u2019t dare to alert her. He said slowly, \u201cSong Ci, I brought you back to the Mu Family when you were 14 years old. Your mother and I have always treated you well. We have never treated you badly. Moreover, I even volunteered to pay for your elder sister\u2019s medical fees...\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you want to hurt me like this. Why didn\u2019t you tell me that you want to marry Han Zhan? Even if I don\u2019t agree, I won\u2019t stop you by force. It\u2019s no longer the era where parents dictate their children\u2019s marriages.\u201d\n Mu Mian purposely told her everything he had done for Song Ci, in order to see if she would get angry. If Song Ci knew what he had done, she would definitely think he was putting on an act after hearing his words, and would feel disgusted.\n But Song Ci looked guilty after hearing his words.\n Mu Mian couldn\u2019t help but be suspicious.\n She would still feel guilty?\n Song Ci said softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Father. I... I didn\u2019t dare to tell you because I heard...\u201d Song Ci\u2019s eyes flashed, as if she had her considerations.\n Mu Mian said, \u201cSpeak!\u201d\n Song Ci lifted her head and looked at Mu Mian\u2019s face. She said hesitantly, \u201cThey said that in order to strengthen your collaboration with Chuan Dong Group, you intend to marry me to Cheng Ziang so that we can be connected by marriage.\u201d\n Mu Mian asked her, \u201cWho said so?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI heard some rumors and also could tell myself.\u201d\n Mu Mian became silent and lit a cigarette. He sat on the sofa, pinched his eyes, and started sizing up Song Ci from the corner of his eyes. Song Ci was holding her purse with both hands and indignance filled her eyes, as if she was very hurt.\n Mu Mian asked her, \u201cIsn\u2019t Cheng Ziang good? That child is very considerate toward you. He has been wooing you for several months without giving up.\u201d\n Song Ci sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t you know how good he is, father?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Why did they suddenly stop contacting each other?\n What went wrong?\n Hearing the name Cheng Ziang made Song Ci unable to conceal her hatred and disgust, as her face revealed an annoyed expression.\n \u201cI heard some things and did some investigations. I discovered that Cheng Ziang is a Casanova. He pretended to be devoted and gentlemanly in front of me.\u201d\n \u201cLast year, he even impregnated a small model. That model refused to abort the child and Cheng Ziang actually caused her to fall down the stairs during her work, causing her to lose the child!\u201d Song Ci clenched the straps of her purse tightly. She said with a disgusted expression, \u201cHow vicious is a man who can even kill his own child? Father, you want me to go out with such a person? I feel disgusted.\u201d\n Mu Mian frowned.\n Cheng Ziang had been very careful when he did those things, so Mu Mian didn\u2019t know who had revealed these things to Song Ci. Actually, Song Ci had found out about these things in her previous life. The more she knew about Cheng Ziang, the more Song Ci felt disgusted and nauseous.\n After hearing her words, the doubts in Mu Mian\u2019s heart finally dissipated slightly. \u201cJust because of this, you married Han Zhan in a fit of anger, because you were angry with me?\u201d If that was all, there was still a way to save this matter.\n \u201cNo.\u201d This time, Song Ci denied it. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that I am angry at you, but marrying Han Zhan is not an act of spite.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s face revealed a gentle and blissful expression that only girls in love would have. She said shyly but firmly, \u201cBrother Han is a very worthy man. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t have much money or power, and can\u2019t give me a luxurious life, but he will respect and love me very much. He won\u2019t do anything ridiculous.\u201d\n \u201cI married Han Zhan willingly.\u201d\n Mu Mian took a deep breath to suppress his annoyance. \u201cSong Song, you are too stubborn.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cMother will never regret being obsessed with you forever.\u201d\n Mu Mian had a complex expression.\n \u201cThat year, when outsiders saw the two of you together, it was just like how you guys saw Brother Han and me.\u201d Song Ci smiled slightly. She said, \u201cIt was Mother who taught me that marrying right is better than marrying into a rich family. Father, you also used your life\u2019s experience to teach me never to underestimate a man\u2019s potential.\u201d\n \u201cI believe that Han Zhan is a man worthy of entrusting my entire life to. Just like how mother trusted father deeply back then.\u201d\n Perhaps he had been convinced by Song Ci, or perhaps he knew that there was no way to turn the situation around. In the end, Mu Mian didn\u2019t say anything harsh to Song Ci.\n However, the fact that Song Ci lied to him and secretly got married did enrage him. Mu Mian said in the end, \u201cSong Song, I won\u2019t agree to your marriage with Han Zhan. It\u2019s a betrayal to our family when you deceived your mother to get your household register. In the future...\u201d\n Mu Mian gave Song Ci a meaningful look before saying, \u201cYou are still my daughter. But you are already an adult and should be financially independent.\u201d\n This meant that from now on, Song Ci could no longer use a single cent from the Mu Family.\n Mu Mian wanted Song Ci to experience the life of an ordinary family. He felt that Song Ci, who was used to leading a luxurious life, would eventually get tired of leading a simple life.\n This punishment sounded very serious, but Song Ci had already made enough money to support herself and this was no longer a threat to her lifestyle. It was just that without the financial support of the Mu Family, Song Ci would definitely not be able to live as extravagantly as before.\n Song Ci had no objections to Mu Mian\u2019s decision. She said, \u201cNo matter what, I still have to thank Father for all his efforts towards me and my elder sister.\u201d It was an undeniable fact that Mu Mian had raised her and paid for Song Fei\u2019s medical fees.\n However, Song Ci would definitely seek revenge for all the sins that Mu Mian had committed against her and Song Fei.\n She put on a submissive expression. \u201cI will follow my father\u2019s decision.\u201d\n Mu Mian acknowledged it.\n Mu Mian said that he wanted to cut off Song Ci\u2019s financial resources, but he was indirectly cutting off his relationship with her daughter. Long Yu had thought Song Ci would be very upset, as after all, she had lived in the Mu Family for eight years.\n However, Song Ci looked happy and her footsteps were light. She didn\u2019t look sad at all.\n Long Yu was not a talkative person. After boarding the car, he was still worried about Song Ci. \u201cMadam, Mr. Mu is currently in a fit of anger. Once he cools down and accepts Mr. Han, everything will be fine.\u201d\n Song Ci knew that Long Yu was worried about her and her heart felt warm. She gave Long Yu a reassuring smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am very well now.\u201d I have never been better.\n Seeing that Song Ci was really unaffected, Long Yu was relieved. He said, \u201cThis is also close to Mr. Han\u2019s company. Do you want to meet Mr. Han?\u201d Zeus Airlines was two streets behind Chao Yang Company.\n Song Ci thought of those posts on the forums that were trying to dig up Han Zhan\u2019s identity. The employees of Zeus Airlines must also be talking about him now, so Song Ci was worried about Han Zhan\u2019s current situation.\n ]If not for her implicating him, Han Zhan\u2019s physical flaws wouldn\u2019t be known by the entire city.\n \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n In the end, she still couldn\u2019t let go.\n ...\n After work, Li Li knocked on the door of Han Zhan\u2019s office. \u201cMr. Han, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\n Han Zhan was reading a post related to him on the forum on his laptop. This was sent to him by Li Li half an hour ago. Only when Han Zhan saw those dozens of pages of replies, did he realize how highly regarded Song Ci was in Wangdong City.\n Closing the webpage, Han Zhan looked up and said to Li Li, \u201cIt\u2019s a foolish action to keep such a foul-mouthed person by your side.\u201d\n Li Li had also browsed the forum and naturally knew what Han Zhan was hinting at. \u201cThe employee who leaked your information has already been found out. I\u2019ve arranged to meet him this afternoon to discuss with him and I\u2019ll fire him.\u201d It was a major taboo to have a loose mouth and to speak ill of one\u2019s colleague.\n If he could sell his colleague\u2019s information today, he could sell the company\u2019s secrets tomorrow.\n Noticing that Han Zhan was still frowning, Li Li added, \u201cI will clarify the reason behind his resignation on his resume.\u201d As such, it would be very difficult for that employee to find another easy job.\n Only then was Han Zhan satisfied.\n He stood up, buttoned up his suit, and prepared to go for dinner.\n Li Li asked him, \u201cDo you need me to contact the staff at the forum to delete the post?\u201d\n \u201cNo need.\u201d Han Zhan looked at his gloved right hand and said, \u201cAs her man, I\u2019m prepared to be in the center of attention. You can delete the post but you can\u2019t close people\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n \u201cMoreover...\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression was calm as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not shameful to be handicapped. If you don\u2019t steal or rob, if you have a clear conscience, why would you delete it?\u201d\n Li Li smiled in relief. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

When Li Li pressed the lift button, he glanced at Han Zhan\u2019s right hand again.\n Recalling those nosy and disgusting comments about Han Zhan\u2019s right hand on the forum, Li Li felt slightly unhappy. He remained silent the entire time. Just as the lift was about to reach the ninth floor, he suddenly asked, \u201cMr. Han, your hand...\u201d\n Li Li couldn\u2019t continue.\n He carefully sized up Han Zhan\u2019s reaction. Han Zhan would never remove his glove in public, showing that his handicapped right hand would always be a pain in his heart. Li Li couldn\u2019t bear to poke at Han Zhan\u2019s wound.\n Hearing that Li Li only spoke a little before keeping quiet, Han Zhan glanced at him and saw that Li Li looked like he wanted to say something but hesitated, and looked very guilty. Han Zhan finished his sentence for him. \u201cYou want to ask, how did I lose my fingers?\u201d\n Li Li nodded hesitantly. \u201cCan I ask?\u201d\n A tragic scene flashed across Han Zhan\u2019s mind. He closed his eyes and said softly, \u201cDuring the earthquake in Bijiang City, roads, water, and electricity were all cut off. We were the closest batch of soldiers to the epicenter of the disaster.\u201d\n \u201cThe entire team was ordered to go to Bijiang City to rescue the victims who were trapped at the site of the earthquake. While trying to save someone, there was an aftershock and my right hand was hit by a concrete slab.\u201d After a pause, Han Zhan said expressionlessly, \u201c...It was crushed for 60 hours.\u201d\n For nearly three days, his right hand had been pressed under the concrete and the hand tissues had long been destroyed. In order to ensure that his right hand was not infected, the doctor sought Han Aoyu\u2019s approval and cut off two of Han Zhan\u2019s fingers. \u201cBy the time I woke up, my fingers had already been severed.\u201d\n When Han Zhan woke up and found out that his fingers had been amputated and that he would never be able to touch a gun or repay his country in this life, he felt like he had been struck by lightning. He had never felt so much pain and despair, even when the aftershock came and the building was leaning on him.\n It was the darkest moment of Han Zhan\u2019s life.\n After hearing this, Li Li\u2019s heart was filled with emotion. During the year of the Bijiang City earthquake, he was just an ordinary university student, but Mr. Han had already personally gone to the scene to rescue people.\n \u201cThen what did you do in the military previously?\u201d\n Perhaps it was because he had touched Han Zhan\u2019s greatest taboo, the man\u2019s bright and clear eyes dimmed visibly, and his usually calm face lost its smile.\n Li Li realized that he had said something wrong and felt very regretful. \u201cI said something wrong...\u201d\n The door opened and Han Zhan walked out of the lift. Li Li heard the words float into his ears \u2014\n \u201cA sniper.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s eyes widened.\n His feet were pinned to the lift and he couldn\u2019t move.\n A sniper!\n It was truly heartbreaking for a sniper to lose his index and middle finger!\n Not hearing Li Li\u2019s footsteps following behind him, Han Zhan turned around impatiently and asked him with raised brows, \u201cAre you still not following me? You like to take the lift so much?\u201d Taking advantage of the fact that the lift doors were not completely closed, Li Li hurriedly turned sideways, got out of the lift, and went to the cafeteria side by side with Han Zhan.\n Zeus Airlines\u2019 cafeteria was famous for its delicious food and beautiful surroundings, and had even been named as Wangdong City\u2019s No.1 Company cafeteria by an authoritative magazine. Although it was Zeus Airlines\u2019 cafeteria, it also served non-company customers.\n The cafeteria was divided into Chinese, Western, and Japanese restaurants. Li Li and Han Zhan planned to go to the Chinese restaurant for a meal. As they walked past the main hall of the canteen, they were stared at by many employees, as they gossiped.\n Noticing his subordinates\u2019 behavior, Li Li teased Han Zhan. \u201cLook, this is the daily routine after marrying the top socialite. You must get used to it.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan didn\u2019t comment and had a mild expression.\n Having just torn open Han Zhan\u2019s wound, Li Li felt guilty and wanted to do something to please Han Zhan. Han Zhan was about to reach for his plate when Li Li suddenly grabbed his arm. Han Zhan raised his brows at Li Li and asked, \u201cHmm?\u201d\n ]Li Li said ingratiatingly, \u201cGo and sit down. I\u2019ll get you some food.\u201d\n Knowing that Li Li was trying to cheer him up, Han Zhan didn\u2019t refuse. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n Han Zhan sat down at his usual seat.\n Apart from Li Li\u2019s team, no one in the entire company knew Han Zhan\u2019s true identity. After he sat down, the other senior management couldn\u2019t help but steal glances at him. After reading the news on the forum, they still couldn\u2019t believe that Song Ci would really marry Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan was the most handsome man in the company, but apart from his face, he didn\u2019t seem to have any other good points.\n Family background?\n Although he was not short of money, he was not rich either. His car was also an ordinary Volvo. Moreover, he was handicapped.\n What exactly did Song Ci want by marrying him?\n Everyone\u2019s eyes were scorching. Han Zhan was not blind and could definitely detect it. He took out his cell phone from his pocket and placed it on the table. Looking at his colleagues who had lowered their heads to pretend to be ostriches, Han Zhan said in an exceptionally calm tone, \u201cIt\u2019s just a handicap of the hand. It\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get married?\u201d He was a werewolf!\n There was silence in the cafeteria.\n Everyone was embarrassed as they did not expect Han Zhan to be so straightforward.\n This silence only lasted for three to four seconds, before being broken by a man. \u201cMr. Han, are you really married to Song Ci?\u201d The person who spoke was the assistant manager of Bei Zhan\u2019s department. He didn\u2019t know that Han Zhan was the boss of the company, but because Han Zhan was highly regarded by Manager Li, he had to respectfully address him as Mr. Han.\n Han Zhan nodded and admitted openly. \u201cYes.\u201d\n Everyone gasped at Han Zhan\u2019s admission.\n It was real! (italics)\n Song Ci was really married to Han Zhan! (italics)\n \u201cMr. Han, you\u2019re awesome.\u201d Someone gave Han Zhan a thumbs-up, feeling both envy and jealousy. \u201cThe Chuan Dong Second Young Master couldn\u2019t even get her after several months, but you actually managed to win her over! Mr. Han, you\u2019ve done our company proud.\u201d\n Although he said that, everyone was not convinced. In their eyes, apart from their looks, they were not inferior to Han Zhan in any way. How could such a gorgeous beauty like Song Ci marry Han Zhan? It was truly incomprehensible.\n A married middle-aged man also asked curiously, \u201cMr. Han, how did you manage to woo Song Ci? I heard that she is very difficult to woo, and there are many wealthy young masters who have wooed her before.\u201d\n Han Zhan pointed at his face and said humbly, \u201cNothing else. She said that I look like her type.\u201d\n Everyone was speechless.\n Chuan Dong Second Young Master would vomit blood if he heard this.\n [Han Zhan used his thick skin to control the situation, and everyone lowered their heads to eat.\n It was only a matter of time before his grandfather heard about his wedding, so Han Zhan decided to tell his grandfather about it. His grandfather, Han Aoyu, was a very interesting old man. His WeChat profile was very festive. It was a photo of him holding a basket of tomatoes with both hands and laughing at the camera.\n He was like an old farmer.\n Han Zhan found a photo of the uncle farmer on WeChat, typed a sentence, and sent it: Grandpa, I am married.\n Han Zhan was only satisfied after he dropped a bomb.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Coincidentally, Song Ci sent him another message. It was a voice message that lasted for three seconds.\n Han Zhan turned down the volume slightly, before tapping on the voice message.\n Song Ci: Brother Han, are you in the office? I am downstairs.\n Han Zhan hurriedly replied: Where?\n Song Ci replied: Basement.\n Han Zhan: Take the lift to the seventh floor. I will wait for you at the lift.\n After replying to her message, Han Zhan got up and walked out of the canteen. Only when Li Li returned with two plates of food, did he realize that Han Zhan was missing. He asked his colleagues, \u201cWhere is Mr. Han?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure. He suddenly left just now.\u201d\n Li Li thought that Han Zhan might have gone to the washroom. He put the plates down and started eating.\n ...\n When Han Zhan led Song Ci into the staff dining hall, the originally noisy restaurant instantly became quiet. Everyone\u2019s curious eyes were fixed on Song Ci\u2019s face.\n It was really Song Ci?\n Song Ci and Han Zhan had appeared together! This meant that the news on the forum was most likely true!\n Song Ci was wearing a neck brace, which was a little detrimental to her charm, but she was still beautiful. Someone whispered to a colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s Song Ci, right? Is it really Song Ci?\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s fair, tall, and beautiful. Who else could it be but Song Ci? I heard she got into a car accident a few days ago. One look and I can tell she hasn\u2019t recovered from her injuries.\u201d\n \u201cIt looks like everything on the forum is true. Song Ci and Han Zhan are really married.\u201d\n There was only one woman who was very intrigued. She poked at the steak in her bowl with her chopsticks, and said in a puzzled manner, \u201cThis really doesn\u2019t make sense. How can there be a woman who still looks so beautiful in a neck brace in this world?\u201d\n Song Ci could hear everyone\u2019s discussion.\n Song Ci saw from the corner of her eye that many people were looking at Han Zhan with curiosity and disdain. She suddenly felt uneasy.\n What is wrong with Han Zhan?\n What is so bad about him?\n Song Ci suddenly grabbed his left hand. Han Zhan paused, looked down, and asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Han Zhan thought Song Ci had something to tell him.\n Song Ci gave him a gentle and charming smile. \u201cI want to hold your hand and show off our love.\u201d Han Zhan seemed to have guessed the underlying meaning behind Song Ci\u2019s action and a hint of warmth surfaced in his eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Li Li saw Song Ci and Han Zhan walking in hand in hand, and was so shocked that he nearly choked. He swallowed the rice in his mouth with difficulty, raised his right hand, and waved to Song Ci. \u201cHi... Ms. Song.\u201d\n Song Ci was about to nod, when she suddenly heard Han Zhan say to Li Li in a very soft but domineering voice, \u201cWhat Ms. Song? You must call her sister-in-law.\u201d\n Song Ci blushed slightly. Who wouldn\u2019t be moved by her shy look?\n Li Li\u2019s tongue felt slightly numb but he still corrected himself awkwardly. \u201cSister-in-law.\u201d\n Song Ci acknowledged sheepishly and sat down beside Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan was very satisfied upon seeing this.\n \u201cThis is mine. You have it first. I will go get some rice for you.\u201d Han Zhan pushed the plate that Li Li prepared for himself in front of Song Ci. There were four dishes, two meat and two vegetable, soup, and a huge plate of... white rice. It was indeed Han Zhan\u2019s appetite.\n Song Ci stared at the pile of rice and thought of Han Zhan\u2019s standard of conduct. She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t finish it. It\u2019s a waste.\u201d\n \u201cWait a minute then.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned and walked towards the counter to get food. Shortly after, he returned with a plate of food. The dishes were all light and there were only two spoonfuls of rice. \u201cEat this.\u201d\n Han Zhan placed the plate in front of Song Ci. Seeing that Song Ci was staring at those two spoonfuls of rice in a daze, Han Zhan knew what she was thinking. His face darkened as he warned Song Ci. \u201cYou must finish it. You\u2019re not allowed to waste a single grain of rice.\u201d She was over 1.7 meters tall and couldn\u2019t even finish two spoonfuls of rice. What kind of nonsense was this?\n Song Ci quietly picked up her chopsticks and started eating.\n Li Li observed the way the two of them interacted, and felt that it was very rare. Mr. Han\u2019s manner of taking care of Ms. Song was just like how his mother took care of him when he was young...\n After a few mouthfuls of rice, Song Ci lifted her head to catch her breath. She met the gazes of several employees sitting diagonally opposite her at the dining table. Realizing that those people were sizing her and Han Zhan up, Song Ci could guess what they were thinking.\n Han Zhan was burying his face in his food when a piece of fragrant, crispy roasted duck meat suddenly appeared on his plate. It was the kind with lots of lean meat. Han Zhan looked up at Song Ci in confusion. Song Ci gave him a sweet smile and said in a soft, sweet voice, \u201cBrother Han, I gave you the biggest piece of duck meat. Brother Han, I\u2019m nice to you, right?\u201d\n Under Li Li\u2019s gaze that looked as if he had seen a ghost, Han Zhan nodded slightly and replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n After pondering for a moment, Han Zhan picked up the piece of meat and ate it.\n After eating it, Han Zhan noticed that Song Ci was still smiling at him. Puzzled, he thought for a moment, took a piece of cold beef from his plate, and handed it to Song Ci.\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d She grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s left hand and said, \u201cDo you know how to feed your wife? If not, I will teach you.\u201d\n Han Zhan watched as Song Ci grabbed his hand and placed the piece of meat into her mouth. Song Ci bit into the beef, but Han Zhan felt like Song Ci had bitten his heart. It didn\u2019t hurt, just slightly itchy.\n Han Zhan retrieved his chopsticks and heard Song Ci say, \u201cThe meat Brother Han fed me is so fragrant. I like it.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down slightly, not knowing how to respond to her teasing.\n Li Li was blinded by these two people who were openly flaunting their love. He could have eaten a few more bites, but he chose to put down his chopsticks. \u201cI am full. Enjoy.\u201d\n Li Li carried his plate and slipped away.\n Once Li Li left, Han Zhan secretly shot Song Ci a warning look. Afraid that Song Ci would do something naughty again, Han Zhan said in a low voice, \u201cEat. Otherwise, your rice will turn cold.\u201d\n \u201cBrother Han you really love me.\u201d Song Ci smiled in satisfaction, before lowering her head to continue eating.\n The two of them interacted very openly. All the colleagues saw the scene just now and felt very complicated about it. From the looks of it, Song Ci and Han Zhan indeed had a real relationship and it was not a scheme.\n Han Zhan finished his meal without leaving a single grain of rice.\n At the side, Song Ci was also full. Han Zhan saw that her plate was very clean and was rather pleased.\n Song Ci was also feeling rather smug, as if she had been publicly praised by a kindergarten teacher. At this moment, her cell phone screen lit up. Song Ci took it out and saw that it was a message from Mu Qiu.\n She frowned and opened her WeChat.\n Mu Qiu: Sister, I saw that many people on the forum are talking about you and Brother-in-law. Do you need to delete the post? I can contact my friends and think of a way to delete it.\n So kind-hearted?\n However, Song Ci didn\u2019t follow the script.\n Song Ci: No, I am getting married and not secretly dating anyone. There is nothing shady about it.\n Mu Qiu: ...\n Mu Qiu had been typing for some time, before she finally sent her message.\n Mu Qiu: I want to be discharged. I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my days in the hospital in vain. I still have many things that I want to do. I made a bucket list. I want to do everything I can before I die, so I won\u2019t leave with any regrets.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

What did the doctor say?\n Mu Qiu: What can the doctor do? Without a suitable heart, it\u2019s useless to stay in the hospital. After staying in the hospital for more than a month, I am about to become moldy, so I want to go out to take a look.\n Song Ci: Did father and mother agree?\n Mu Qiu: At this point, what\u2019s the point of them disagreeing?\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know how to persuade Mu Qiu.\n From Mu Qiu\u2019s point of view, Song Ci actually approved of Mu Qiu\u2019s way of doing things. Knowing that she was going to die, instead of staying in the hospital and waiting for death, why not get discharged and do whatever she wanted? Every matter done counted.\n Mu Qiu added: Sister, when are you getting married?\n Mu Qiu stood at the window of the ward, looking down at the youngsters chatting and laughing on the field below. She looked slightly despondent. Mu Qiu pushed open the window and let the hot wind in. The heat spread across the ground, and she felt the power of life.\n Her cell phone vibrated. Mu Qiu looked down and saw Song Ci\u2019s reply.\n Song Ci: Not confirmed yet, why?\n Mu Qiu rubbed her eyes and fought the urge to cry. She typed a message and sent it.\n Mu Qiu: I want to be your bridesmaid and accompany you into the wedding hall.\n Song Ci looked at the message and hesitated, but in the end, she still replied with a \u2018yes\u2019.\n ...\n After the meal, Han Zhan brought Song Ci back to his office.\n Han Zhan had a small bed in his office. It was 1.35m wide and Song Ci was resting on it alone, with a thin blanket covering her legs. Han Zhan didn\u2019t sleep, and sat on the sofa reading some documents.\n Song Ci heard the sound of paper flipping. She suddenly asked, \u201cAre we holding a wedding?\u201d\n Han Zhan smirked. \u201cOf course. Which couple doesn\u2019t hold a wedding?\u201d\n Song Ci instinctively said, \u201cBut we are going to get a divorce a year later. It won\u2019t be easy to clean up the mess then.\u201d\n The smile on Han Zhan\u2019s face suddenly disappeared. He shifted his gaze away from the document and looked at Song Ci. Song Ci\u2019s eyes were still closed. She didn\u2019t know that Han Zhan had already lifted his head and was staring at her with a profound gaze.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t hear anything. She thought Han Zhan was engrossed in reading documents, so he didn\u2019t speak.\n Han Zhan placed the document on the coffee table. He got up, walked to the side of the bed, and looked down at Song Ci. Song Ci finally felt that something was off. She opened her eyes and met Han Zhan\u2019s deep eyes.\n Shocked, Song Ci felt slightly fearful. \u201cHan Zhan...\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly asked her, \u201cWhen will your menstruation period end?\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Her expression changed slightly as she answered, \u201cIt ended the night before yesterday.\u201d She was due on the 15th and usually ended after five days. After answering, Song Ci felt slightly uneasy. She had a feeling that what Han Zhan was going to say next wouldn\u2019t be a good thing.\n Han Zhan nodded and said calmly, \u201cMake yourself free tomorrow night.\u201d\n They were both adults. How could Song Ci not understand what Han Zhan wanted to do, by telling her to make herself free? The smile on her face disappeared and she couldn\u2019t smile anymore. If Han Zhan really wanted to do something, he would do it even if she was wearing a ventilator, let alone a neck brace.\n Such a Han Zhan was rather heartless.\n \u201c...Okay.\u201d Song Ci had no right to refuse.\n Han Zhan suddenly added. \u201cWe need to change the content of the transaction.\u201d\n Song Ci asked in confusion, \u201cChange what?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cRemove the one year deadline.\u201d\n Song Ci looked up abruptly, only to hear Han Zhan say, \u201cIt will take 10 months to get pregnant, but the chances of getting pregnant within two months are not high. This way, the contract should only end when the baby is born.\u201d\n This suggestion was reasonable, but Song Ci felt slightly depressed.\n She could only agree. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After she said that, Han Zhan\u2019s expression turned even uglier.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know why Han Zhan was unhappy, but she also didn\u2019t feel good and couldn\u2019t explain why. Song Ci couldn\u2019t fall asleep anymore. She sat up in the bed and said to Han Zhan, \u201cYou still have work in the afternoon, I won\u2019t disturb you anymore. I\u2019ll go back first.\u201d\n Han Zhan watched as she stood up, put on her high heels, and walked out of the room calmly like a proud princess.\n Han Zhan tugged at his tie and suddenly called her. \u201cSong Ci.\u201d\n Song Ci stopped in her tracks but didn\u2019t turn back.\n Han Zhan looked at her skinny and stubborn back view. He said, \u201cI will invite someone to pick an auspicious day for our wedding. You can arrange the wedding according to your preferences. You can invite anyone you want.\u201d\n With her back facing Han Zhan, Song Ci gave a self-deprecating smile, turned back, and said to Han Zhan with her usual expression, \u201cI don\u2019t have many friends to invite. What about you?\u201d\n Top socialite Song Ci had a wide range of friends. She could meet several familiar faces at any high-class restaurant, yet she said she didn\u2019t have many friends to invite...\n Did she not have any friends to invite, or did she not want them to come? If it was the latter, why didn\u2019t she want them to come?\n Han Zhan instinctively glanced at his right hand. Song Ci was so young, beautiful, and popular. If not for the fact that she had no choice, why would she marry a handicap like me?\n Han Zhan felt very upset, but he hid his emotions well. He told Song Ci, \u201cI will invite my family over. You don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After Song Ci left, Han Zhan stared at the bedsheets that Song Ci had slept on and revealed a puzzled and hurt expression. Am I not good enough? Why is she always thinking about the divorce a year later? Yesterday, she clearly said that I was very good and she couldn\u2019t bear to leave me.\n As he laid down on the bed where Song Ci had laid, Han Zhan raised his right hand and placed it in front of him. He recalled some old memories from many years ago.\n \u201cAh Zhan, I am preparing to jump ship to a better entertainment company. They promised to tailor an album for me every year and will definitely hold a concert for me within the next three years.\u201d\n He laid in bed, looked at the beautiful woman, and listened to her talk about her work. He was sincerely happy for her and hoped that she could go further. After hearing that, he said happily to her, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\n However, the woman couldn\u2019t smile. She looked at the man on the bed, her eyes turning red.\n Her eyes were filled with reluctance, pity, pain and ruthlessness.\n That gaze made Han Zhan uneasy.\n \u201cThe new company\u2019s contract is rather stringent. They want me to not date for the next five years, and not to get married for the next eight years...\u201d The woman broke into tears.\n Under his incredulous gaze, she cried bitterly. \u201cAh Zhan, let\u2019s break up.\u201d\n After his fingers were broken and his wounds were still badly mangled, his lover, whom he had known for seven years and dated for five years, broke up with him without warning.\n Just because he lost two fingers, his future was ruined!\n Han Zhan took off his gloves, removed his fake fingers, and looked at the scars left behind by his amputation surgery. His expression was slightly defeated.\n He suddenly woke up..\n He was 32 years old and handicapped. Song Ci had already said clearly that she married him, only because he could provide her with a strong backing. There was no love between them.\n If not for my identity, how could Song Ci have fallen for me?\n I am a toad that doesn\u2019t have self-awareness.\n Han Zhan shook his head and smiled.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

He was curious if Song Ci had gotten into an argument with Mr. Han, but he also knew that this was not something he should ask.\n Song Ci was thinking about Han Zhan\u2019s unusual behavior today.\n Although Han Zhan was not a good person, he was also not a temperamental man. It was illogical for him to suddenly turn grim and say hurtful words, like what he did today.\n Song Ci recalled her conversation with Han Zhan in the office today. After thinking carefully for about 10 minutes, Song Ci suddenly widened her eyes.\n Han Zhan\u2019s mood suddenly turned sour after she said a sentence.\n What did I say?\n \u2014 But we will be getting a divorce in a year\u2019s time. Things will get ugly then.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n Was Han Zhan angry?\n Was it because I had subconsciously mentioned that we would get a divorce a year later?\n Song Ci\u2019s heart started to beat increasingly faster. What did this mean? If my analysis is correct, does it mean that Han Zhan doesn\u2019t want a divorce?\n Why isn\u2019t he willing to get a divorce?\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t figure it out. In the end, she dismissed it as Han Zhan was afraid of trouble and didn\u2019t wish to find another stepmother for her child. Besides, Song Ci was pretty good in all aspects and was a perfect spouse. The two of them got along very well.\n Who is he looking for to be his lover?\n He might as well let Song Ci be the mother. It would be better for the child to follow his biological mother than to follow his stepmother. Moreover, didn\u2019t Han Zhan say last night that the position of Mrs. Han would always be hers, for as long as Song Ci wanted?\n After thinking it through, Song Ci suddenly understood Han Zhan\u2019s previous coldness.\n She thought of all sorts of possibilities but managed to avoid the best answer.\n After hesitating for a moment, Song Ci took out her cell phone and sent Han Zhan a message.\n Song Ci: Brother Han, I don\u2019t wish to divorce you.\n Song Ci was speaking the truth. She really didn\u2019t want to divorce Han Zhan. It wasn\u2019t because she really fell in love with him, but because Han Zhan was indeed a mature, high-quality man. He knew how to tolerate and respect himself. Song Ci also admired Han Zhan.\n If they really had a child, Song Ci definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to bear to leave the child. Perhaps their love would grow over time.\n Besides...\n Song Ci recalled her previous life.\n Song Ci gave up being a pilot in her previous life. She joined Mu Mian\u2019s company and worked by his side for two years. After that, she married Cheng Ziang and stopped working. By the time they divorced, she was already 30 years old. It was already a ridiculous dream for her to be a pilot.\n Song Ci had learned the violin for 10 years. After the divorce, she became a composer and made a few songs for several movies. She was also the music arranger and instructor of the famous singer, Liang Bo, even winning a major music arrangement award.\n There was once when Song Ci went to a convalescent hospital for a charity performance and actually saw Han Zhan again. At that time, Han Zhan had already lost his sight and couldn\u2019t see anything, but he really liked to listen to Song Ci\u2019s songs.\n Han Zhan felt that he admired her work and invited her to perform at the convalescent hospital twice a month, which he would pay for.\n Only then did Song Ci know that that convalescent hospital was actually founded by Han Zhan. It was a charity hospital and specially took care of those who were physically handicapped but had no money to go for treatment.\n After a while, the two of them became good friends.\n Song Ci remembered seeing Han Zhan three days before her death. At that time, Han Zhan told her to come on time the next time she came, as he had a secret to tell her. She asked what secret it was and Han Zhan said, \u201cSince it\u2019s a secret, I definitely can\u2019t say it.\u201d\n Song Ci still didn\u2019t know what that secret was.\n Song Ci remembered grabbing a doctor\u2019s hand before she died, and asking them to give her cornea to Han Zhan.\n I wonder if Han Zhan had regained his sight...\n Song Ci had suffered terribly during that marriage with Cheng Ziang. She was actually a little afraid of marriage. If she really had to choose a husband, Song Ci felt that that person must be Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan was different. They were bound together in her previous life.\n ...\n Inside the office lounge.\n Han Zhan had just put on his fake fingers and was putting on his gloves, when he heard his cell phone vibrate. Han Zhan put on his gloves, before picking up his cell phone to unlock it.\n Song Ci: Brother Han, I don\u2019t wish to divorce you.\n Han Zhan stared at his cell phone. His first reaction was suspicion.\n What is she up to now?\n Unable to guess what the young ladies were thinking now, Han Zhan thought for a moment and felt that he should tell Song Ci what he was thinking. He was already a mature adult and knew that he should speak his mind instead of hiding it.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t have the ability to read minds. How could she understand, if he didn\u2019t tell her? It was impossible for that ingrate Song Ci to guess and understand his thoughts.\n Song Ci was lost in thought as she thought about her previous life. It was only when Han Zhan sent a new message, that she snapped out of her trance.\n She looked down and saw that Han Zhan had sent a very long message:\n [Before yesterday, my evaluation of myself was that I am a rational and stable man. Although I am occasionally frivolous, I will never do anything absurd. But yesterday, you dragged me to the Ministry of Civil Affairs to register our marriage. I knew that this was too impulsive, but I still did it with you. Thinking back, I am somewhat shocked. After considering carefully, I think I should have a good impression of you. Perhaps your boldness attracted me, or perhaps your looks attracted me. Perhaps the good impression is not at the level of love, but Song Ci, for so many years, you\u2019re the only one I have a good impression of.]\n Han Zhan was still typing.\n Moments later, a new message was sent.\n ]Han Zhan: I am 32 years old this year. Although I am well-to-do, I am handicapped and my love life has not been clean. I once said that I have been in a relationship for as long as five years. And Song Ci, although you have met many outstanding men, your love life has always been clean. In comparison, I don\u2019t think I am worthy of you.\n Song Ci was about to reply when Han Zhan sent another message.\n Han Zhan: I am 10 years older than you, physically handicapped, and had a failed relationship. I am not very confident when facing you. This morning, you were still saying that you can\u2019t bear to part with me after a year, and in the afternoon, you said in a flat tone that you will get a divorce after a year. I actually don\u2019t understand what you are thinking.\n Han Zhan: As a businessman, I am successful in many battles. As a man, I am a failure. Song Ci, I really want to try to get along with you, not as a collaborator, but as husband and wife.\n Han Zhan\u2019s chain of messages was finally over.\n After sending them, Han Zhan heaved a sigh of relief. He had always wanted to tell Song Ci these words. Now that he finally said them, Han Zhan felt a sense of relief.\n It was Song Ci\u2019s first time seeing Han Zhan explain their relationship this seriously. She couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly surprised. She had always thought that Han Zhan was just carrying out his end of their deal.\n But she had misunderstood him.\n Han Zhan was like warm water. Initially, he felt warm and comfortable, without any passion, but warm water would eventually become hot.\n Song Ci thought about it seriously before replying to Han Zhan: From today onwards, let\u2019s ditch that boring deal and try to embrace each other. Let\u2019s... fall in love!\n After sending this message, Song Ci felt slightly uneasy. She was afraid that Han Zhan would scold her for dreaming.\n Han Zhan\u2019s answer was surprising and concise: Okay.\n Song Ci\u2019s depressed mood was instantly soothed.\n Seeing that Madam was finally smiling, Long Yu raised his brows again.\n This woman\u2019s mood was like a traffic light\u2014 red light for a while, then green and followed by yellow.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

She got Long Yu to park the car beside a park, and she called Yan Jiang.\n \u201cAh Jiang, where are you?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s assistant answered the call. \u201cMs. Song, Brother Jiang has something on and is in a meeting. I will get him to call you back later.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci looked up and said to Long Yu, \u201cI am not going home. I am going to meet a friend.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Madam.\u201d\n About 20 minutes later, Yan Jiang called. Song Ci picked up and asked him with a smile, \u201cYou were in a meeting just now? Is there a new drama?\u201d\n Yan Jiang sneered. \u201cBullsh*t.\u201d His refined voice was especially interesting when he swore.\n \u201cThen what were you doing?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said in a low voice, \u201cA female singer is returning to develop her career and is going to film a music video. She wants me to be the male lead.\u201d With Yan Jiang\u2019s popularity, being able to invite him to film a music video meant just how famous this singer was.\n Song Ci asked curiously, \u201cWho is so capable?\u201d\n \u201cDu Xueyan.\u201d\n Song Ci was very surprised. \u201cOh my God, Du Xueyan, have you agreed?\u201d\n Yan Jiang replied, \u201cI am considering.\u201d Yan Jiang then asked Song Ci, \u201cOh yes, why did you call me at this time?\u201d\n \u201cI want to visit your cat.\u201d\n ]Yan Jiang turned to look at the group of executives beside him. He glanced at his watch and said to Song Ci, \u201cGo to the cafe outside my villa and wait for me. I will be back in an hour.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci finished her cup of coffee and refilled it, before seeing Yan Jiang return. She carried the mocha that she had packed earlier and boarded Yan Jiang\u2019s car.\n Long Yu sat in the car and watched as Song Ci boarded Yan Jiang\u2019s car. He felt very conflicted. Why did Madam board a stranger\u2019s car?\n Should I tell Master about it?\n Long Yu was very hesitant.\n Yan Jiang noticed a black Volvo parked at the side with a driver inside. He smiled and said, \u201cThis is Brother Han\u2019s car, right? Is that the driver? Brother Han cares a lot about you.\u201d\n \u201cOf course. My Brother Han is gentle, considerate and thrifty. There\u2019s no one better than him in Wangdong City.\u201d Song Ci bragged about Han Zhan without much thinking.\n Yan Jiang raised his brows. \u201cStop flaunting, I don\u2019t care.\u201d He added, \u201cThat driver of yours, Brother Long, looks like Brother Monkey.\u201d\n Song Ci exchanged glances with him and laughed heartily. \u201cI think so too. However, the bodyguard that Han Zhan found for me is definitely not as easy to bully as he looks.\u201d\n Yan Jiang agreed.\n \u201cLet me guess what your driver is thinking now.\u201d Yan Jiang had one hand on the steering wheel and the other on his coffee cup. He put on a conflicted expression and said in a distressed manner, \u201cWhy did Ms. Song get into the car of a pretty boy? Is something happening outside? Should I tell Mr. Han?\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t stop laughing at Yan Jiang\u2019s antics. \u201cShut up.\u201d\n Amidst their banter, the car arrived at Yan Jiang\u2019s doorstep. After parking the car, the two of them alighted.\n In the distance, the camera flashed and the scene of the two of them returning home side by side was captured by the reporters.\n After entering the house, Yan Jiang threw away the unfinished mocha. He changed his shoes and asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat do you want to drink? Coffee or tea?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink those. Is there a cold drink? Brother Han doesn\u2019t even allow me to drink cold water and beverages.\u201d Song Ci really wanted to drink some iced beverage. Han Zhan was good in all aspects, except for the fact that he liked to poke his nose into other people\u2019s business.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Yan Jiang made her a cup of kumquat lemonade with lots of ice. Song Ci took a few sips and smacked her lips in pleasure. She put down the cup and asked Yan Jiang impatiently, \u201cWhere did you hide my elder sister?\u201d\n A glint flashed across Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes as he stammered, unable to utter a complete sentence.\n Song Ci looked at him with a scrutinizing gaze. \u201cYan Jiang...\u201d Song Ci thought of a possibility. She shot Yan Jiang a death glare and hurried upstairs to Yan Jiang\u2019s master bedroom.\n Song Ci pushed open the door to the master bedroom and saw Song Fei in deep sleep on Yan Jiang\u2019s big bed.\n Song Fei was wearing a yellow dress and lying on the right side of Yan Jiang\u2019s bed. Her face looked slightly rosy; it looked like Yan Jiang had taken good care of her.\n There was an IV stand on the right side of the bed. It was used for daily transfusions of nutrients to Song Fei. Song Ci heard Yan Jiang\u2019s footsteps entering the room behind her. She turned and said fiercely to him, \u201cIf I see any bad marks on my elder sister\u2019s body, I will definitely kill you!\u201d\n Both of them knew very well what a bad mark was.\n \u201cTurn around, no peeking!\u201d Song Ci snapped at Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang turned around obediently, looking very aggrieved.\n Song Ci lifted Song Fei\u2019s skirt and checked her body. After confirming that there were no ambiguous marks, Song Ci heaved a sigh of relief.\n Yan Jiang explained softly from behind her. \u201cI am not being disrespectful to her. I am just... afraid.\u201d Yan Jiang turned to look at Song Fei\u2019s sleeping face. \u201cI will only feel at ease if she lies beside me and I can feel her heartbeat at night.\u201d\n ]Hearing this, Song Ci was stunned. She noticed that her elder sister\u2019s nails were neatly trimmed by Yan Jiang. Only then did she realize that her momentary agitation and suspecting that Yan Jiang\u2019s had ill intentions was hurtful toward him.\n Song Ci felt slightly guilty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Song Ci sat by the bed like a little kid who had done something wrong. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ah Jiang. I shouldn\u2019t have thought of you so badly. I just...\u201d\n I\u2019m just too afraid of my sister being harmed.\n Yan Jiang shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He walked over and grabbed Song Fei\u2019s slender arm. He said in a low voice, \u201cEvery night before I go to bed, I have to hold her arm and count the frequency of her pulses before I can fall asleep.\u201d\n \u201cYou might not know.\u201d\n \u201cHmm?\u201d Song Ci looked at Yan Jiang in confusion. \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cActually, I am very afraid of the dark. I always suffer from insomnia at night. All these years, I have never had a full night\u2019s sleep.\u201d As a result of insomnia, Yan Jiang always stayed up all night and would never go to bed to rest, until he could barely open his eyes.\n Song Ci always knew that Yan Jiang had a habit of suffering from insomnia. Thinking of his childhood, she couldn\u2019t help but frown. \u201cIs it because of Grandma Yan?\u201d That year, when Grandma Yan had a lung disease, she had hung herself from the beam of her room one night, in order not to burden Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang had woken up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet. He had been so petrified and hopelessly terrified by that scene.\n Yan Jiang nodded gently. His eyes were unfocused as he said, \u201cWhen the sky turns dark, I will always see Grandma hanging by the door. So many years have passed and I will never forget it.\u201d\n Night was long and unbearable for Yan Jiang.\n A hint of fragility appeared on Yan Jiang\u2019s handsome face, making Song Ci\u2019s heart ache. \u201cHave you considered going to see a psychiatrist?\u201d Song Ci felt that Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t continue like this. Perhaps a psychiatrist could counsel him.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

It didn\u2019t have much effect.\u201d\n Gazing tenderly at Song Fei\u2019s sleeping face, Yan Jiang said to Song Ci, as if talking to himself, \u201cSometimes when I stare at her, I have the feeling that she will open her eyes and look at me the next second. Song Song, do you have this feeling too?\u201d\n Song Ci gazed at Song Fei\u2019s face, which was as fair and rosy as a healthy girl\u2019s. She smiled bitterly. \u201cWhy not? All these years, I\u2019ve always thought that my elder sister would wake up tomorrow. I\u2019ve looked forward to it more than 2000 times and I\u2019ve also been disappointed more than 2000 times.\u201d\n Holding Song Fei\u2019s hand, Song Ci placed her cheek on Song Fei\u2019s palm. She nuzzled against it lovingly. \u201cAh Jiang, it\u2019s very cruel to wait for someone who is in a deep sleep to wake up. She gives you hope but also disappoints you. Over and over again, she will make you collapse sooner or later.\u201d\n Song Ci looked at Yan Jiang hesitantly, wanting to tell him not to have too much hope.\n However, Yan Jiang smiled. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty good. Even if I\u2019m disappointed thousands of times, hope is still there.\u201d He smiled calmly at Song Ci, with shocking determination in his smile. \u201cI will wait for her to wake up. I have yet to confess to her.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know how to answer him. \u201cYou are so stubborn!\u201d\n Song Ci stayed at Yan Jiang\u2019s place until it was dark, before standing up to leave. She had just stepped back home when Han Zhan returned. Song Ci turned around in shock when she heard the door open behind her.\n Song Ci was slightly surprised to see Han Zhan coming home with a briefcase. \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019re not working overtime tonight?\u201d\n \u201cNo need.\u201d Han Zhan leaned close to Song Ci and smelled a faint male perfume on her. Thinking of the news he saw on his phone about Song Ci and Yan Jiang being secretly photographed, Han Zhan felt slightly depressed. \u201cYou went to see Yan Jiang this afternoon?\u201d\n \u201cHow did you know?\u201d Song Ci looked at Han Zhan suspiciously and guessed. \u201cDid Brother Long tell on me?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not him.\u201d\n He poured himself a big glass of water, finished it, and put down the glass heavily. Only then did Han Zhan say, \u201cA reporter took a photo of you and Yan Jiang entering his house together.\u201d Han Zhan had a deep impression of Yan Jiang. At Song Ci\u2019s birthday party, the two of them had shown exceptional intimacy.\n Han Zhan turned to look at Song Ci, only to see her pouting and complaining. \u201cThis bunch of paparazzis love to take photos secretly. Why don\u2019t we see them taking photos of us?\u201d\n Hearing her mutter, Han Zhan\u2019s depressed mood suddenly lifted slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with Yan Jiang?\u201d As Song Ci\u2019s legal husband, Han Zhan had the right to ask this question.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t hide it from Han Zhan and told him honestly. \u201cWe were neighbors when we were young.\u201d\n Still neighbors, childhood sweethearts, compatible age, compatible looks...\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t seem to have much of a reaction. He just poured himself another glass of water. It was still ice-cold water.\n \u201cAre you very close?\u201d He was still boiling with anger, even after swallowing the cold water.\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cPretty close. Ah Jiang s four years older than me and was bullied all the time when we were young. As a result, he was quieter and more self-abased. At that time, I was the only one in our entire community who played with him.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThen you are very special to him.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t detect the sourness in Han Zhan\u2019s words. She stood in the living room and shook her head. \u201cSpecial? No matter how special I am, he doesn\u2019t like me. He likes my sister. I really couldn\u2019t tell that such a timid boy actually dared to like my sister.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly surprised and his tone lightened. \u201cYan Jiang likes Song Fei?\u201d\n \u201cYup.\u201d Seeing that Han Zhan was interested in the people around her for once, Song Ci walked over and stood beside him. She told Han Zhan, \u201cIn the earthquake eight years ago, Yan Jiang didn\u2019t eat or drink for three days and fought for every second to dig my sister out.\u201d\n \u201cIn my previous life, Yan Jiang didn\u2019t forget my elder sister even until my death. I went to his house today to visit her. Yan Jiang might look like a playboy, but he is a rare devoted lover.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled and said, \u201cNot bad.\u201d There was nothing bad about being devoted.\n \u201cRight? You also think that Yan Jiang is pretty good.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci looked at Han Zhan\u2019s empty glass and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAre you that thirsty? I\u2019ve already seen you drink two glasses of water.\u201d She touched Han Zhan\u2019s glass and found it very cold. \u201cDid you drink ice water just now?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Not only was he not thirsty, he felt like his stomach was about to burst from two glasses of ice water.\n Hearing this, Song Ci\u2019s expression was slightly strange. Where did that Brother Han who emphasized on nourishing one\u2019s health go? \u201cYou\u2019re not drinking your Wolfberry tea anymore?\u201d\n What nourishing tea? I\u2019m already full from drinking vinegar [1. Vinegar in Chinese shared the same character as jealousy, so the author played a pun here]. Han Zhan looked at Song Ci with a complicated expression. After a long while, he shook his head and said, \u201cYou are indeed troublesome.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly dazed. What did I do wrong again?\n \u201cWhat are we having for dinner?\u201d Song Ci rolled up her sleeves and looked like she was about to cook.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cLet\u2019s have takeout.\u201d\n Song Ci instead said, \u201cLet\u2019s cook together.\u201d The way Brother Han cooked was so sexy and alluring.\n \u201cNo, I still have work to do. Takeout will save time.\u201d After Han Zhan finished speaking, he heard Song Ci ask, \u201cYou still have work? Then why did you get off work so early?\u201d\n Han Zhan went silent suspiciously.\n Song Ci looked at his face that was even more handsome when he kept quiet She realized something and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cBrother Han, you didn\u2019t specially come back after seeing the news, right?\u201d\n Han Zhan kept a straight face and didn\u2019t say a word. He just walked past Song Ci, went into the living room, grabbed his laptop, and went upstairs.\n Song Ci stood there shaking her head and laughing.\n This cold, unfeeling man was actually jealous.\n In the end, it was still Song Ci who made the dinner. She felt that takeout was too oily and she was afraid of gaining weight.\n \u201cBrother Han, let\u2019s eat!\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci call for a meal, Han Zhan thought she was making a diet meal again. He went downstairs with a troubled expression and was rather surprised to see three dishes and a soup on the table.\n Song Ci made seaweed, egg, dried shrimp soup, a plate of steamed prawns, a plate of celery slices with meat, and a plate of broccoli. Han Zhan was a man who loved to eat meat and such dishes were rather bland to him. However, his wife was afraid of gaining weight, so it was already a lot of love from her to cook a plate of meat for him.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what you liked and just casually made some dishes.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI like them all.\u201d\n This was the first time a woman cooked for him.\n Song Ci smiled.\n Song Ci\u2019s culinary skills were just so-so, but the texture was light and not at all bad. Han Zhan finished three bowls of rice, put down his chopsticks, and was about to clear the table, when he heard Song Ci say, \u201cPack up first. Come upstairs to look for me after you\u2019re done.\u201d\n Han Zhan stacked the bowls together and held them and the chopsticks. He asked without raising his head, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ll know later.\u201d Song Ci turned and ran upstairs.\n Han Zhan tidied up the dining table, threw the cutlery, bowls, and ladles into the dishwasher, tidied up the stove, took off his gloves, and went upstairs. Han Zhan found Song Ci in his study room, holding a piece of paper in her hand and doing something.\n Han Zhan stood quietly at the door, sizing up the scene before him.\n The tall and slender Song Ci was wearing a dress and sat cross-legged on his pure black leather chair. She looked very fair and very small. Han Zhan suddenly felt warm in his heart. He liked the way Song Ci behaved in his territory.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Her eyes were sparkling as she opened and closed her mouth, revealing her pearly white teeth. \u201cI drew a table here. Write it down for me.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s gaze lingered on her red lips for a few more seconds before he took the paper and looked down.\n It read:\n Brother Han\u2019s likes:\n Food he likes:\n Food he dislikes:\n Interests and hobbies:\n Things he hates:\n ...\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cMust I write it?\u201d He had never written this before. Even when he was writing his alumni record after graduating from high school, it was not so detailed.\n \u201cYes.\u201d Song Ci said, \u201cWe are husband and wife now. I have to understand you.\u201d\n That\u2019s true.\n Han Zhan placed that piece of paper on the table. Due to his height, he could write easily just by bending over slightly. Meanwhile, Song Ci was also in Han Zhan\u2019s arms, along with her chair. She lowered her head slightly and rested it against Han Zhan\u2019s chest. At such a close distance, Song Ci felt slightly uneasy.\n However, Han Zhan\u2019s expression was calm. The tip of his pen circled the paper as he wrote beautifully. Song Ci felt Han Zhan\u2019s strong heartbeat coming from above her head. Her heartbeat also became chaotic and irregular.\n Song Ci tried her best to focus on the paper, but Han Zhan\u2019s presence was too strong and she couldn\u2019t ignore him at all. She could smell Han Zhan\u2019s cold aura, and if she lifted her head slightly, she could kiss Han Zhan\u2019s collarbone under the two buttons of his collar...\n Song Ci grabbed the chair with her fingers, feeling very restless.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t know how chaotic Song Ci was feeling. He wrote on a piece of paper:\n His favorite foods: meat, fermented beancurd parsley, chives, steamed eggs, cloves...\n Food he didn\u2019t like: pickled vegetables, bitter gourd, Japanese food.\n Interests and hobbies: Shooting, riding, racing, bamboo weaving...\n Things he hated: Wasting Food...\n The word \u201cwaste food\u201d had just been written when suddenly, a breath of hot air blew onto his face. Han Zhan\u2019s eyes shifted slightly as he looked down at Song Ci with much warning. \u201cDon\u2019t be mischievous.\u201d\n \u201cBrother Han, can you bring forward what we are going to do tomorrow night to tonight?\u201d Song Ci, who had been silent the entire time, spoke up and stunned Han Zhan.\n Ka!\n The tip of the pen was forcefully on the A4 paper.\n Han Zhan\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple was big and sexy. It was the toughest shield in front of his throat. At this point, that shield couldn\u2019t help but roll up and down. It wasn\u2019t protecting its owner\u2019s throat\u2014it was a metal door that locked the most ferocious wild beast.\n Song Ci knew what Han Zhan was worried about. She tugged at his collar gently with her right hand and said with a red face, \u201cWe are already husband and wife...\u201d\n \u201cNo regrets?\u201d Han Zhan pressed his nose against Song Ci\u2019s forehead. His restrained voice still couldn\u2019t conceal his desire.\n Song Ci\u2019s breath hitched as she nodded firmly. \u201cNo regrets.\u201d\n With that, Han Zhan released his left hand and the fountain pen landed on the table. Song Ci flew into the air and was pulled into Han Zhan\u2019s arms. She returned to the room. As the door locked, Song Ci had no room to retreat.\n ...\n At 12.30am, Han Zhan finally let Song Ci off. Her eyes were slightly red as she laid weakly on the sofa with the thin blanket covering her. She wasn\u2019t feeling well, not because of the pain, but because she felt like she was missing something.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly worried.\n Han Zhan was changing the bedsheets. He had already showered and there were a few scratches left by a girl\u2019s fingernails on his scarred back.\n After laying down the bedsheets, Han Zhan turned around. Although he didn\u2019t look burly, he was full of vigor. Song Ci was still sizing him up, her eyes fixed on him without any reservations.\n This was her husband and it wasn\u2019t a crime to look at him. Han Zhan didn\u2019t mind being looked at like this by Song Ci. He tightened the towel around his waist, walked over, lowered his head, and asked Song Ci, \u201cAre you going to sleep?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cSo tired...\u201d With that, Song Ci suddenly shut up. Is this still my voice? It is dry and raspy.\n Han Zhan considerately carried Song Ci up from the sofa, placed her on the bed, turned around, and left the room to do something.\n Song Ci was sweating profusely and her short hair was sticking to her neck. Her eyelids felt heavy as she laid on the bed. She felt like sleeping.\n At this moment, Han Zhan returned with a transparent glass filled with honey water. Han Zhan patted Song Ci\u2019s cheek. Song Ci woke up and was dazedly fed a few mouthfuls of honey water by Han Zhan.\n Her throat really did feel better.\n Han Zhan put down the cup and took off his towel to change into pyjamas. Song Ci suddenly thought of something and glanced at the clock on the wall. It was already past midnight and she smiled ambiguously.\n Han Zhan looked at her in confusion. \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d\n Song Ci pointed at the clock on the wall. She said in an intriguing manner, \u201cIt was a total of four hours from the foreplay to the end of the shower.\u201d\n Han Zhan also glanced at the clock.\n It was already 12.30am.\n Understanding Song Ci\u2019s hint, Han Zhan felt slightly embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know my limits.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s attraction to Han Zhan was deeper than he thought. He had lost control tonight and couldn\u2019t restrain himself.\n It was very difficult for a clean man in his thirties to control himself after suddenly tasting it.\n Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s lovely lips, thought carefully, and answered honestly, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult in front of you.\u201d\n Oh my god, what seductive words are those?\n I have been ambushed!\n Song Ci turned over and buried her face in the pillow, too embarrassed to look at Han Zhan.\n Previously, Song Ci complained that Han Zhan\u2019s leather glove was uncomfortable against her skin, so she told him to take it off. Han Zhan hesitated for a moment before cooperating with her to take off his glove. Now that Song Ci was going to sleep, Han Zhan sat on the other side of the bed and planned to put on his fake fingers himself.\n Song Ci suddenly reached out, snatched away his fake fingers, and placed them on the dresser. She said, \u201cWhat are you wearing so late at night? It\u2019s superfluous.\u201d\n Han Zhan wanted to say that he was afraid of scaring her. After a moment of silence, Han Zhan spoke the truth. \u201cIf you wake up in the morning and suddenly see a hand with only three fingers, you will be scared.\u201d\n Song Ci stared at Han Zhan\u2019s face with a complex gaze. Her lips moved a few times. Song Ci really wanted to tell Han Zhan that his hands were really not that ugly. \u201cThen I\u2019ll sleep outside while you sleep inside. This way, when I wake up, I\u2019ll see your left hand.\u201d\n Han Zhan added, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that my right hand will hug you involuntarily after I fall asleep.\u201d\n Song Ci wanted to roll her eyes again. She said unhappily, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just amputate it then?\u201d He\u2019s so wishy-washy and troublesome.\n Han Zhan knew that Song Ci was angry and didn\u2019t insist on it. He put down his fake fingers and laid down on the other side. After cohabiting with Song Ci, this was the first time Han Zhan took off his gloves to sleep, and it felt pretty good.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "72": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-73\n\n Chapter 72: Hero\u2019s Hand  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t quite fall asleep. She turned sideways to face Han Zhan, her fingers caressing around his beautiful eyes. Han Zhan opened his eyes and didn\u2019t stop her little action.\n Finally mustering up her courage, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, how did you lose your fingers?\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly glanced at her with a complex expression.\n \u201cCan\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Song Ci asked.\n Han Zhan shook his head and gave a rough explanation. \u201cI was pressed down by a concrete slab when I was trying to save someone. The hand was pressed for too long and my fingers are dead, so I had to amputate them.\u201d But he didn\u2019t say who he saved under what circumstances.\n Song Ci felt very uncomfortable hearing this. She had always thought that Han Zhan\u2019s finger had been cut off by an enemy. She didn\u2019t expect it to be for the sake of saving someone. She didn\u2019t question further as knowing the rough details were enough.\n Holding Han Zhan\u2019s right hand and placing it in front of her, Song Ci took a look and suddenly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not very nice, but I\u2019m not afraid. Brother Han, don\u2019t try to hide it from me in the future. This is the hand of a hero. If you cover it, it will be a denial of your honor and belief.\u201d\n She knew deep down that even though Han Zhan had already retired from the military and was a businessman, there was no way he could change those things in his bones.\n To Han Zhan, fighting for the country was an honor, and peace was a belief.\n When Han Zhan heard that, he felt an earthquake in his chest and a numbing sensation spread throughout his body. It was the first time a woman praised his ugly hands as the hands of a hero. It was not without reason that Song Ci was so attractive to him.\n It was getting late and Han Zhan still had work tomorrow. Song Ci couldn\u2019t continue to disturb him and said, \u201cI am going to bed.\u201d\n Han Zhan acknowledged. \u201cYou sleep, I\u2019ll watch.\u201d\n \u201cCute and coquettish.\u201d As Song Ci spoke, the corners of her lips curled up as she really closed her eyes. That scorching gaze lingered on her for a long time, before finally disappearing due to fatigue.\n ...\n Song Ci was still feeling unwell when she woke up early in the morning. She knew that this was normal and she would probably recover tomorrow. She sat on the bed for a while and realized that there were two sheets of paper on the dresser.\n Song Ci took it and looked at it. One was the paper she gave to Han Zhan last night, and the other was made by Han Zhan to record her preferences and dislikes. Song Ci put down her paper, picked up Han Zhan\u2019s answer sheet, and read it seriously. Han Zhan wrote \u2014\n Food he liked: meat, fermented beancurd, parsley...\n Food he disliked: vegetables, chicken, Japanese food.\n Interests and hobbies: Shooting, riding, racing, weaving bamboo, holding hands with Song Ci, kissing her, and doing everything with her.\n Things he hated: Wasting food. Hate Song Ci being too intimate with others.\n Song Ci put down the paper and fell into deep thought. Hate it when I\u2019m too intimate with others?\n I didn\u2019t expect Brother Han to be so jealous.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t intend to go out this morning, so she didn\u2019t change out of her pyjamas or put on makeup. Anyway, she looked good without makeup, and it wasn\u2019t like Han Zhan hadn\u2019t seen her before. Song Ci picked up her piece of paper and walked into the study in her pyjamas. She found a pen and seriously wrote down her preferences.\n Food she liked: spicy crayfish, stir-fried bamboo shoots with bacon, beef brisket with tomatoes, medium-well steak, durian.\n Food she disliked: Vegetable, all scaleless fish\n Interests and hobbies: Violin, aviation, collecting high heels.\n Things she hated: Domestic abuse, deceit...\n Song Ci filled in that form and went downstairs to find that Han Zhan had already left, but the kitchen\u2019s steamer was keeping her breakfast warm. Song Ci ate her breakfast as she watched today\u2019s headline news. Before she finished her meal, she received a call from Du Tingting.\n \u201cSong Song, you should persuade Qiu-er. She wants to be discharged, and said she doesn\u2019t want to waste her time in the hospital. But how can she be discharged with her current condition?\u201d\n Persuade? How?\n \u201cMother, Qiu-er is an adult now and you should respect her. She told me about this yesterday and I tried to persuade her, but I saw that Qiu-er had already made up her mind and there was no use in trying to convince her.\u201d Song Ci licked the soup dumpling juice on her fingers. Then, she realized she had lost her demeanor by doing so.\n How can the top socialite lick her fingers? She quickly took out a tissue to wipe them clean.\n Du Tingting sighed. \u201cSo you think that we should let Qiu-er do what she wants?\u201d\n \u201cMother, Qiu-er is also very depressed staying in the hospital. Why don\u2019t we let her do what she wants?\u201d\n Actually, Song Ci had never understood Mu Qiu. From their interactions during this period, Mu Qiu didn\u2019t seem like the kind of person who would sacrifice the lives of the two sisters in exchange for her own life. But in her previous life, Mu Qiu had personally placed her hand on Song Ci\u2019s chest and asked for her heart.\n Song Ci was curious as to why Mu Qiu suddenly requested to be discharged.\n In the end, Du Tingting allowed Mu Qiu to be discharged.\n Mu Qiu was discharged that day. She put on an energetic, light makeup, pink blush and a vibrant yellow dress.\n As they left the hospital, Mu Qiu opened her arms and took in a deep breath of warm air. A blissful smile finally broke out on her face. She opened her phone and glanced at her bucket list. She smiled again. From now on, she was going to live her life to its fullest.\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart ached as she gazed at her daughter\u2019s overly slender figure.\n ...\n After breakfast, Song Ci, who was still feeling unwell, laid down on the sofa and played with her cell phone. She searched online to see if there was any way to resolve her discomfort after her first sexual experience.\n The perfect answer: Change to a frail and delicate husband, and end the tiredness once and for all.\n Trash browsers were not reliable. I had spent so much effort to get Brother Han. How can I bear to change him? I\u2019ll never change him for the rest of my life.\n Song Ci logged out of the browser and sent Yan Jiang a message. [Ah Jiang, help me pick a violin. Send it to my house if you are free.]\n Yan Jiang replied: Come and take it yourself.\n Song Ci: Not feeling well.\n Yan Jiang: Are you sick?\n Song Ci: My heart is racing every night and I am feeling very unwell. Come and find me.\n Yan Jiang raised his brows. Heart racing every night...\n He shook his head and chuckled. He thought to himself that this girl\u2019s married life was truly blissful.\n Du Xueyan looked up in surprise, when she saw Yan Jiang smiling at a cell phone. She started sizing him up.\n Yan Jiang was dressed entirely in black. His purple and pink hair was paired with a pair of gold-framed glasses, and a silver chain hung around his neck. He sat lazily on the sofa with a cigarette dangling from his ear and a cell phone in his hand. It was unclear who he was talking to. His brows were raised and the smile on his lips was faint but very seductive.\n ]He was indeed very good-looking, as expected of the top beauty in the entertainment circles.\n Du Xueyan thought of her manager\u2019s words. Her manager\u2019s original words were: \u201cYan Jiang is the most popular celebrity in the country. He has debuted for so many years and has been involved in countless scandals. He also doesn\u2019t have a public image\u2014he smokes, is a fierce fan, fights with celebrities\u2014and has been doing whatever he wants. I have never seen him being afraid.\u201d\n \u201cBut the strange thing is that although he is very arrogant, his fans dote on him and he has many fans. You don\u2019t need to worry about anything if you collaborate with him.\u201d\n \u201cHe is the best partner to work with.\u201d\n This was the first time Du Xueyan met Yan Jiang. She realized that he was both beautiful and proud, but she couldn\u2019t understand something. In the entertainment circles, all celebrities had to put on an act and tread carefully. How could he live so carefreely?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Having lunch was the best opportunity for them to get to know each other better.\n Yan Jiang looked up and glanced at Du Xueyan. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n ...\n Du Xueyan treated Yan Jiang to a meal at a western restaurant. Although Du Xueyan was a singer, her figure management was not inferior to that of an actress. She ate very little. Yan Jiang, on the other hand, ate all the food on his plate.\n Du Xueyan was slightly taken aback. Yan Jiang was an actor. If he were to gain weight, it would affect the shooting. As they were both celebrities, Du Xueyan asked him frankly, \u201cMr. Yan, aren\u2019t you afraid of becoming fat?\u201d\n Yan Jiang smiled devilishly at Du Xueyan. \u201cI have no shows to shoot, so it doesn\u2019t matter if I get fat.\u201d\n Only then did Du Xueyan remember that although this person in front of her was very popular, he had indeed only acted in one film. All these years, he had relied on this face to stay in the industry.\n Yan Jiang added, \u201cActually, I can\u2019t get fat.\u201d As a child, he was malnourished and had always been very skinny. Although he ate a lot now, he didn\u2019t gain much weight.\n Du Xueyan was green with envy, upon hearing his words.\n After dinner, the two of them parted ways at the restaurant. Yan Jiang returned to his car and said to his assistant, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Moon and Star Zither Association.\u201d Arriving at the Zither Association, Yan Jiang chose an antique high-end violin for Song Ci and spent over 70,000 yuan on it.\n After buying the violin, Yan Jiang called Song Ci. \u201cI will come over for dinner tonight.\u201d\n Song Ci replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After ending the call with Yan Jiang, Song Ci called Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan was having a video conference with a German partner when his cell phone vibrated. Han Zhan guessed that it was Song Ci and hurriedly told the partner to wait a moment in German.\n The other party stopped and waited patiently.\n Han Zhan hung up and replied to a message, before continuing the meeting. After the video conference ended, Han Zhan hurriedly called Song Ci back.\n \u201cAre you done with your meeting?\u201d The phone rang and Song Ci answered it.\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Recalling how Song Ci kept calling him elder brother last night, Han Zhan instinctively opened the thermos and took a sip. The more he drank, the hotter his chest felt.\n Song Ci said to Han Zhan over the phone, \u201cYan Jiang is coming over for dinner tonight at our house. Is it convenient for you to come home for dinner?\u201d Yan Jiang was Song Ci\u2019s best friend and Song Ci wanted to introduce Han Zhan to her friend.\n The phrase \u201cour house\u201d pleased Han Zhan. He looked at his watch and said, \u201cWhat food do you need? I am getting off work now and will bring them back along the way.\u201d It was not that he was really free at work. It was just that considering Song Ci\u2019s culinary skills, it was not suitable for entertaining friends, so Han Zhan had to go back to cook.\n Song Ci smiled and said, \u201cAlright, how about you bring a bottle of coconut water when you return? Yan Jiang likes to drink that. Bring a big pork trotter too.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s ears twitched and he asked Song Ci, \u201cPork trotter?\u201d\n Song Ci acknowledged and asked Han Zhan, \u201cDon\u2019t you like pork trotters with sauce?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s lips curled up slightly. \u201cMmm, I like it.\u201d After hanging up, Han Zhan picked up his teacup and took another sip. He felt that the tea today was slightly sweet and soul-stirring.\n [fuzzy]Han Zhan packed up his things, grabbed his bag, and left. He bumped into Li Li, who just came back from a business trip, in the lift corridor. Li Li glanced at the briefcase in Han Zhan\u2019s hand. \u201cGetting off work so early?\u201d It was only 4pm, Han Zhan was brazenly skipping work.\n Han Zhan patted Li Li\u2019s arm and said, \u201cPlease understand. When you have a family in the future, you will understand me.\u201d\n Li Li grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm and asked in a sarcastic tone, \u201cSo you\u2019re not going to Elder Lin\u2019s party tonight?\u201d Elder Lin was a respected senior and also the vice-president of the Huaxia Chamber of Commerce.\n Han Zhan rubbed his glabella helplessly. Holding back his heartache, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll reward you with a Porsche for this year\u2019s bonus. How about that?\u201d\n Li Li immediately smiled radiantly. He let go of Han Zhan\u2019s arm and waved goodbye with a smile. \u201cTake care, Mr. Han. See you tomorrow.\u201d His face changed so quickly that it was astonishing.\n On the way home, Han Zhan came across a large vegetable market called Wang Jiangshan Market. It was a popular food market in Wangdong City, and one could buy seafood and expensive vegetables from all over the world from there.\n Han Zhan bought a big pork trotter. Passing by the fruit shop, he smelled the familiar scent of durian and quickened his steps. Just as he was about to reach the main entrance of the market, Song Ci called him again.\n \u201cBrother Han, can you bring a durian back for me?\u201d\n Han Zhan stopped in his tracks.\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n Song Ci nagged at him again. \u201cIt has to be mature, which is the kind that is soft and fragrant.\u201d\n Han Zhan walked back to the fruit shop, endured the nausea, walked up to the durian stand, pinched the durians, and chose a big and smelly durian. Along the way, Han Zhan smelled that stench several times and nearly vomited.\n ...\n Hearing the doorbell, Song Ci opened the door and welcomed Yan Jiang, who was carrying a violin and a bouquet of fresh flowers, into the house.\n Song Ci found a pair of Han Zhan\u2019s slippers that Han Zhan hadn\u2019t opened for Yan Jiang. \u201cIt\u2019s size 46 and slightly bigger than yours. Make do with it.\u201d Han Zhan was tall and big. The contrast between Song Ci\u2019s shoes and his was huge.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t mind and put on the slippers. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I wear size 44.\u201d\n Yan Jiang placed the violin case in Song Ci\u2019s arms. \u201cThis is the highest quality violin in that piano shop. You can use it first. I will buy a better one for you if I come across one.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d Song Ci placed the violin case in the living room, and went into the kitchen to pour a cup of freshly brewed coffee for Yan Jiang. Yan Jiang stood in the living room sizing up Han Zhan\u2019s house. Song Ci handed the coffee to him. \u201cI just brewed it.\u201d\n Yan Jiang took the coffee, and pointed at the French window at the end of the living room. He smiled at Song Ci. \u201cThis glass is quite big. It\u2019s easy to do things.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t think too much of it and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter...\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cLovey dovey every night...\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. They were indeed good friends. During the first time Song Ci followed Han Zhan home, those images also filled her mind when she saw the French window. She stared at the glass window and was somewhat expectant. \u201cI must try it someday.\u201d\n Yan Jiang raised his brows and smiled.\n Song Ci opened the box and took out her violin. She first sized it up. \u201cVery beautiful, I like it very much.\u201d Song Ci tried to tune the violin. After she finished, she said rather ruefully, \u201cThe previous violin was destroyed in Bijiang City. That violin was given to me by my mentor.\u201d\n Yan Jiang naturally knew that Song Ci had been learning how to play the violin by Du Junfei\u2019s side from a young age. He asked Song Ci, \u201cDid you visit Teacher Du all these years?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m too embarrassed to visit him.\u201d Touching her violin, Song Ci felt somewhat ashamed. She murmured, \u201cAfter the shock, my mental state hasn\u2019t been right. I tremble the moment I touch my violin and bow. I don\u2019t dare to see him.\u201d\n Actually, that time when Song Ci and her family went to Bijiang City, having a leisure holiday was out of convenience. Their real motive was to accompany Song Ci to Jiangdu City, which was next to Bijiang City, to participate in the national violin competition.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "74": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-75\n\n Chapter 74: Grandpa\u2019s Visit  Yan Jiang knew the entire situation and could understand Song Ci\u2019s timidity. He casually strummed the strings of the zither, producing an unpleasant sound.\n Song Ci quickly slapped Yan Jiang\u2019s hand away and lovingly touched her zither. She said to Yan Jiang, \u201cYou can\u2019t be so rude to a zither.\u201d\n Yan Jiang shrugged as he observed Song Ci treating the violin like her own baby. He suddenly said, \u201cGo and visit Teacher Shen when you are free. I think he will forgive you.\u201d\n Song Ci remained silent.\n Hugging her violin, she walked up to the French window and performed a well-known solo performance, \u201cThe Great Blessing of Liang\u201d. After the performance ended, Song Ci put down her violin and said with a slightly lonely expression, \u201cThe first song that teacher taught me was \u2018The Great Blessing of Liang\u2019.\u201d\n Song Ci was exceptionally talented in the field of music, especially in violin. She was only 4 years old when she became Teacher Shen Yubei\u2019s student. She was Shen Yubei\u2019s most beloved and only disciple.\n The first time Song Ci saw Shen Yubei, she had played \u2018The Great Blessing of Liang\u2019. Although she had played slowly then, she did not make a single mistake.\n Using Shen Yubei\u2019s exact words, Song Ci was born for the violin.\n Song Ci put away her violin and stopped talking about the past. \u201cI should go and cook now. Ah Jiang, come and help.\u201d\n \u201cComing.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s kitchen was open-aired and very spacious, with a table in the middle. Yan Jiang walked into the kitchen and was slightly surprised to see the ingredients on the table. \u201cSong Song, there\u2019s so much meat. Aren\u2019t you afraid of gaining weight?\u201d\n Song Ci pinched her slender waist and said worriedly, \u201cWhat to do? Brother Han likes to eat meat. I feel like my slender waist is about to become fat.\u201d What a sweet sorrow.\n Yan Jiang was totally flabbergasted. He said in a sour tone, \u201cI also like to eat meat. Why are you always so reluctant to order a plate of meat whenever we go out for a meal? It\u2019s so unfair, Songsong. Have you heard the saying that men are like clothes and women are like hands and feet? If this is used on us, it should be Han Zhan who is like clothes and I am your limbs.\u201d\n Song Ci said heartlessly, \u201cIt\u2019s true that you are my limbs, but Brother Han is my underwear. I\u2019d rather lose my limbs than be naked.\u201d\n Song Ci was heartless. Yan Jiang\u2019s heart felt like it was being stabbed. \u201cSong Song, you had a change of heart.\u201d\n \u201cMy heart has never been with you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang really wanted to go home now.\n \u201cCome, help me wash the baby cabbage.\u201d Song Ci tossed two baby cabbages to Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang rolled up his sleeves and helped without complaints. After washing the vegetables, Yan Jiang had a cigarette in his mouth as he leaned against the kitchen counter and played with his cell phone. He saw something and frowned slightly. He bit his cigarette and muttered. \u201cDamn, I am on the hot search again.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t even look up and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Taking off his cigarette with his slender fingers, Yan Jiang said mockingly, \u201cI had a meal with Du Xueyan this afternoon and we were photographed. They said we are in a relationship.\u201d Yan Jiang glanced at Song Ci and asked her, \u201cDo you think this is the trending topic that Du Xueyan bought?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cNo way. With Du Xueyan\u2019s fame, why would she need to hype things up with you?\u201d\n Yan Jiang smirked. \u201cDo you know why Du Xueyan came back to develop her career?\u201d\n Song Ci was only concerned about Du Xueyan\u2019s work, and not her personal life or career development, so she naturally didn\u2019t know anything. \u201cAny insider information? Tell me.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cIf the news is correct, Du Xueyan is going bankrupt overseas. She had an affair with someone and was discovered by his real wife. That real wife is a ruthless character. She warned Du Xueyan to get lost. If Du Xueyan doesn\u2019t, she will ruin her career.\u201d\n Song Ci was a fan of Du Xueyan\u2019s work. Hearing this, she couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly uncomfortable. \u201cThis rumor might not be accurate.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Yan Jiang pressed several buttons on his cell phone screen, before putting it away. He said, \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s true or not, no one will be able to create hype with me.\u201d\n On Weibo, the netizens were discussing the relationship between Du Xueyan and Yan Jiang. It was successfully trending.\n Du Xueyan was shocked to see this trending topic. Her manager said, \u201cThis is the power of a top celebrity. Look, this news has only been out for slightly more than 10 minutes and it\u2019s already the number one trending post. Xueyan, finding Yan Jiang to film a music video is the best way to promote yourself.\u201d\n Du Xueyan finally acknowledged her manager\u2019s foresight and believed that collaborating with Yan Jiang was indeed beneficial with no harm.\n \u201cShould we remove the top search?\u201d Du Xueyan asked her manager.\n The manager said, \u201cForget it, let it stay there. Anyway, it\u2019s a non-existent matter and we are not at fault.\u201d\n They didn\u2019t wish to withdraw, but Yan Jiang wouldn\u2019t give up so easily. Not long after, another trending topic rose from the bottom of the trending topics to third place. Du Xueyan scrolled through Weibo again and saw a trending topic called \u201cYan Jiang\u2019s Reply about His Relationship Status\u201d.\n \u201cYan Jiang responded?\u201d\n ]Du Xueyan opened the trending topic and saw that Yan Jiang had indeed replied.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s reply was very personal and rude. It matched his style of doing whatever he wanted.\n Yan Jiang: Talk my a*s! @ Visit Entertainment: Shocking news! The Diva Du Xueyan has been photographed entering and exiting the restaurant with Yan Jiang at the same time. The two of them behaved intimately, and are suspected to be in a relationship.\n It was indeed Yan Jiang\u2019s style.\n Du Xueyan was both angry and amused, as she dismissed her initial plan to create hype with Yan Jiang. This guy was like a bomb\u2014he would explode at anyone who provoked him.\n Song Ci cooked up three to four dishes. She took some time to look at the hottest topics on Weibo and also saw Yan Jiang\u2019s reply.\n Although she was already used to Yan Jiang\u2019s rough and straightforward manner, Song Ci was still slightly worried for him. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of offending others by saying this?\u201d After all, he was a famous person and Du Xueyan was not a nobody. Yan Jiang was too upright and would definitely offend someone.\n Yan Jiang had already seen through everything. He said expressionlessly, \u201cIf you are afraid of offending others, you will be used by others.\u201d He was extremely arrogant. \u201cI will never be used by others.\u201d\n Song Ci teased him. \u201cIf you had half your guts in front of my elder sister, I would have to look at you in a new light.\u201d\n Yan Jiang instantly shut his mouth.\n In front of Song Fei, Yan Jiang was like a quail, unable to even lift his head.\n Just then, the doorbell rang again.\n [fuzzy]Song Ci felt it was strange when she heard the doorbell. Yan Jiang snuffed out his cigarette, looked at the door and asked Song Ci, \u201cIs your Brother Han back?\u201d\n Song Ci was puzzled. \u201cNo way. Brother Han knows the password. There\u2019s no need to press the doorbell.\u201d\n \u201cIs that the delivery guy?\u201d Song Ci was a shopping maniac and loved online shopping. It was very likely that it was a delivery guy.\n \u201cProbably.\u201d\n The two of them chatted as they walked towards the main entrance.\n Song Ci opened the door, looked up and was stunned.\n Standing in front of her was an old man wearing a white long-sleeved shirt, black suit pants, a straw hat, and a pair of black leather shoes.\n In each hand was a snakeskin pocket.\n It was very down-to-earth!\n Song Ci took a deep breath when she guessed the elderly\u2019s identity.\n Oh my god, it\u2019s Brother Han\u2019s grandfather!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

She had on exquisite light makeup and her short burgundy hair was styled in a rather mischievous manner.\n At this point, Song Ci was wearing an apron and so was the man behind her. They looked like a couple at the peak of their love.\n This was not the most important thing.\n Most importantly...\n \u201cThis is my grandson\u2019s house. Who are you?!\u201d Han Aoyu stared at Yan Jiang with a dark gaze.\n At this point, Han Aoyu was thinking: Damn it! Han Zhan\u2019s wife was actually having an affair with a gigolo behind his back! She was already wearing a neck brace, but didn\u2019t forget to mess with a man\u2014outrageous!\n Hearing this, Yan Jiang suddenly had a bad feeling. What kind of frightening Asura Arena was this! Yan Jiang looked down at Song Ci and realized that she was not any better than him. He looked flustered.\n Yan Jiang smiled at Han Aoyu ,revealing his pearly white teeth, and said respectfully, \u201cHi, Grandpa, I am...\u201d Song Ci suddenly reached behind her and tugged at Yan Jiang\u2019s shirt, hinting for him to shut up.\n Yan Jiang immediately shut up.\n Song Ci composed herself and smiled sweetly at Old Master Han Aoyu. She placed her hands obediently by her sides and gave Han Aoyu a deep bow. Like a little kid seeing a police officer, she greeted him loudly. \u201cHello, Grandpa!\u201d\n Han Aoyu\u2019s eyes instantly widened.\n What a shameless woman! She was caught having an affair and still had the cheek to call me Grandpa\u2014where did this woman come from?!\n Song Ci straightened her back, pushed Yan Jiang, who was behind her, and said respectfully to Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, come in quickly. You must be tired from rushing over from Shunchen City. The air conditioning is on in the house. It\u2019s cooling, come in and sit down.\u201d\n Han Aoyu stood at the door, refusing to go in. \u201cMiss... this is my grandson\u2019s house, but the man behind you is not my grandson...\u201d Those shrewd eyes were filled with a terrifying pressure. Han Aoyu questioned Song Ci in a low voice.\u201d Why are you guys at my grandson\u2019s house?! \u201d\n His cold gaze brushed past Song Ci\u2019s face and then landed on the pretty boy behind her. \u201cYou guys have to give me a reasonable explanation.\u201d The old man had been through thick and thin all his life. His expression darkened slightly and he exuded a terrifying aura. Not to mention Song Ci, even Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t resist the urge to kneel down and call him grandfather.\n Song Ci\u2019s scalp went numb.\n Shit, he misunderstood us.\n How should I explain this? If I said that Yan Jiang was just my friend but I\u2019m alone at home with a male friend behind her husband\u2019s back, Grandpa would definitely make wild guesses and still think that I\u2019m a vixen bad woman.\n Song Ci was very anxious.\n At this moment, Han Zhan returned home with a bag of items. \u201cGrandpa?\u201d Han Zhan stared at the old man wearing a straw hat and carrying a snakeskin bag. He was pleasantly surprised.\n Han Aoyu turned and looked at his grandson expressionlessly. His eyes seemed to say: Look at you, kid. The hat on your head is glowing green1 and you still don\u2019t know anything. How embarrassing!\n Song Ci hurriedly said loudly to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, did you know that Grandpa is coming today? If you knew, you should have told me earlier! You didn\u2019t say anything and I didn\u2019t even have time to prepare food. If I had known earlier, I would have asked my brother to go to the supermarket to buy some vegetables!\u201d Song Ci sounded both angry and frustrated.\n Han Aoyu frowned and his expression changed slightly.\n Brother?\n Not the other party in the affair?\n Upon hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Han Zhan knew that Old Master had misunderstood. He glanced at Old Master and said helplessly, \u201cGrandpa, why didn\u2019t you call me in advance if you were coming?\u201d Saying that, he said to Yan Jiang, who was behind Song Ci, \u201cBrother, this is my grandfather. He lives in Shunchen City. After knowing that I got married, he specially came over to visit his granddaughter-in-law.\u201d\n It was the first time Yan Jiang saw Han Zhan in person, and he was somewhat stunned by Han Zhan addressing him as \u201cBrother.\u201d However, he was also a smart kid and immediately assumed the role of Song Ci\u2019s elder brother.\n Yan Jiang walked up to Song Ci and greeted Han Aoyu respectfully. \u201cHello, Grandpa. I am Song Ci\u2019s elder brother. Please come in, it is hot outside.\u201d\n Han Aoyu was already an old man and had seen all sorts of situations, but even he blushed after what had happened.\n So it turned out to be a misunderstanding.\n Gosh, it was my first time meeting my grand daughter-in-law, yet I\u2019ve already offended her and her brother. What should I do?\n Would this brother-in-law make things difficult for Zhanzhan?\n Han Aoyu sat on the sofa awkwardly, as he was respectfully invited into the house by his grand daughter-in-law and her elder brother. He looked at Song Ci and felt that this grand daughter-in-law was so beautiful. It was truly his grandson\u2019s blessing to have such a young and beautiful wife.\n Han Aoyu rubbed his hands on his thighs and chuckled awkwardly toward Song Ci. His face was red as he laughed. \u201cLass, your surname is Song, right?\u201d\n Song Ci also felt awkward and blushed.\n She nodded casually and acknowledged softly. \u201cGrandpa, my name is Song Ci.\u201d\n The way she addressed him softened Han Aoyu\u2019s heart. \u201cHey, Song Lass, don\u2019t blame Zhanzhan for not telling you that I\u2019m coming. I heard that he was getting married and suddenly came over on a whim. I wanted to give him a surprise but didn\u2019t inform him. Who knew...\u201d\n There was no surprise, but there was a lot of shock.\n Song Ci hurriedly shook her head, and said considerately, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Staring at the two bags of snakeskin on the floor, Song Ci said sincerely, \u201cBrother Han even told me a few days ago that Grandpa\u2019s tomatoes are ripe and we can have tomato sauce soon. He also said that the grapes are ripe and the wine Grandpa made is especially tasty.\u201d\n Seeing that Han Aoyu\u2019s eyes were obviously warming up, Song Ci continued to flatter him. \u201cI was just telling my brother to have a good taste of Grandpa\u2019s wine later.\u201d\n Old Han was overjoyed. He waved casually and humbly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as he makes it out to be. Don\u2019t listen to his nonsense.\u201d\n \u201cOf course not! Brother Han also always told me that he was brought up by Grandpa. Without Grandpa, he wouldn\u2019t have his current achievements. I still have to thank Grandpa for giving me such a perfect Brother Han.\u201d\n Song Ci covered her mouth as she giggled. Her sweet words made Han Aoyu grin from ear to ear. This was especially so when he heard Song Ci praise Han Zhan, causing him to feel even more proud and become very satisfied with Song Ci.\n \u201cI brought you guys tomato sauce this time. In that bag are some grapes that I plucked from the vines early this morning. I might have spoiled some, but they are still edible. I also brought some vegetables that I planted myself.\u201d\n \u201cOh yes.\u201d Han Aoyu glanced at his own grandson and winked at Song Ci. \u201cZhanzhan said you like bacon and sausages. I brought some too.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci was slightly surprised. I didn\u2019t expect Brother Han to be so considerate.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t participate in their conversation. He was squatting on the floor to untie the rope on the snakeskin bag. After untying the rope, Han Zhan sized up the fruits and vegetables in the bag. Seeing that they were still fresh, Han Zhan looked up and said to Song Ci, \u201cBaby Ci, go to the kitchen and get a fruit basket and vegetable basket.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "76": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-77\n\n Chapter 76: Grandpa Likes Girls who Could Eat  Ci Bao!\n What kind of adoring way to address me is this?\n Song Ci\u2019s heart was shot again.\n Blushing, she went to the kitchen to get a vegetable basket and a fruit basket. Han Aoyu was somewhat surprised to hear the special way his grandson addressed Song Ci. He didn\u2019t expect this boring guy to have such a romantic side.\n Not only did Old Master bring grapes, he also brought along lotus seed heads and plums. He had planted all of them himself.\n Song Ci\u2019s parents were orphans, and they didn\u2019t have any relatives. Although Song Ci and Song Fei didn\u2019t lack love, they didn\u2019t enjoy love from their grandparents either, so she was slightly envious of Han Zhan.\n Song Ci washed the fruits and placed them on the coffee table. \u201cBrother, accompany Grandpa. I will go and cook.\u201d It was Old Master Han\u2019s first visit and Song Ci was embarrassed to drag Han Zhan along to cook.\n Han Zhan was a meticulous person. He chose a few grapes from the basket and said to Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m going to help Song Ci cook.\u201d\n Han Aoyu waved nonchalantly. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n Han Zhan entered the kitchen and stuffed a big ripe grape into Song Ci\u2019s mouth, and she held it in her mouth. \u201cHow sweet.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at her lips stained with grape juice. Thinking of something else, his gaze deepened. \u201cMmm, it\u2019s quite sweet.\u201d\n Now that Old Master was here, Song Ci felt that she should add a few more dishes. However, Han Zhan said that there was no need to be extravagant\u2014just the right amount would do. \u201cMy grandfather hates wasting the most, you can just prepare a sufficient amount.\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, Song Ci also felt that he was thinking more considerately and followed the original menu. Han Zhan saw that Song Ci had cut all the vegetables and stir-fried three dishes. He put on his apron and said to Song Ci, \u201cI will stir-fry the rest of the dishes. Help me tie the knot.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci stood behind Han Zhan and helped him tie his apron. Han Zhan suddenly asked her, \u201cHow is your body? Are you feeling better?\u201d\n Startled, Song Ci hurriedly turned back to look at the living room. She only relaxed when saw that Old Master was talking to Yan Jiang and wasn\u2019t paying attention to them. \u201cI feel better.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s voice was exceptionally soft, afraid of being overheard.\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned on the fire, picked up the spatula, and said, \u201cYou go rest, I\u2019ll cook the rest.\u201d\n Song Ci leaned against him and said very obediently, \u201cI prefer to watch you cook. Brother Han looks so good when you\u2019re cooking.\u201d Song Ci was the best at sucking up to him.\n How could Han Zhan not know what Song Ci was afraid of? He smiled helplessly at her. \u201cMy grandfather isn\u2019t scary.\u201d\n \u201cHe looks quite scary to me, especially when he opened the door and saw me alone with Yan Jiang. That gaze...\u201d Song Ci stuck out her tongue and said fearfully,\u201d Luckily you came back. Otherwise...\u201d\n Han Zhan found it funny.\n He held the spatula in his left hand and stroked Song Ci\u2019s head with his gloved right. \u201cThen stay here.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cOh yes, the durian is in the bag. Take it far away. My grandfather will get dizzy just by smelling it.\u201d Like Han Zhan, Han Aoyu hated durians.\n Upon hearing this, Song Ci glanced at Han Zhan, and suddenly laughed when she saw that his expression was normal. \u201cDon\u2019t you hate durians too?\u201d Standing on tiptoe, she kissed Han Zhan\u2019s cheek and stole a look at her grandfather and the rest. Seeing that they didn\u2019t notice, Song Ci said to Han Zhan, \u201cThank you for your hard work. I will go and buy them myself next time.\u201d\n \u201cNo trouble at all.\u201d\n Han Zhan started the fire and cooked seriously, while Song Ci assisted him.\n Smelling the garlic, Han Aoyu, who was talking to Yan Jiang, suddenly stopped talking and turned to look at the kitchen. He felt more assured seeing his grandson and granddaughter-in-law behaving so intimately.\n They\u2019re quite close.\n Retracting his gaze, Han Aoyu asked Yan Jiang, \u201cKid, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dare to be careless, as he pulled himself together and replied respectfully, \u201cGrandpa, my name is Yan Jiang.\u201d\n \u201cYan Jiang, Song Yanjiang... How old are you compared to that lass?\u201d\n For some reason, Yan Jiang had followed Song Ci and taken on the surname Song, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it out loud. Once a lie was made, countless lies would be needed to smooth things over, and the results would always be the opposite. Yan Jiang thought for a moment and decided to be more honest. It was better to tell the Old Master the truth directly.\n After thinking it through, Yan Jiang said, \u201cGrandpa, my surname is not Song but Yan. I am indeed Song Ci\u2019s elder brother, but not biological, I am her neighbour. We grew up together when we were young and we have a very good relationship.\u201d\n Afraid that Han Aoyu would suspect that he had an ambiguous relationship with Song Ci, Yan Jiang hurriedly explained. \u201cDidn\u2019t Song Ci and Han Zhan just register their marriage two days ago? Today is also my first time visiting Han Zhan\u2019s house. When you arrived just now, Han Zhan happened to go out to buy pork knuckles, which caused that misunderstanding.\u201d\n After hearing this, Han Aoyu didn\u2019t doubt Yan Jiang and Song Ci\u2019s relationship anymore. Instead, he heaved a sigh of relief.\n Luckily, he isn\u2019t her biological brother. Otherwise, it would be awkward.\n Before coming, Han Aoyu didn\u2019t look up information on Song Ci in detail. He only knew that she was the adopted daughter of the Mu Family. The reason he didn\u2019t look up Song Ci\u2019s information was out of respect for his grandson. That was why Han Aoyu believed Han Zhan, when he called Yan Jiang \u201celder brother\u201d.\n After hearing Yan Jiang\u2019s explanation, Han Aoyu didn\u2019t doubt it. Instead of saying that he believed in Yan Jiang, it would be better to say that he believed in Han Zhan\u2019s judgment. His grandson\u2019s judgment of people was still accurate. If there was really something between Yan Jiang and Song Ci, Han Zhan would definitely know.\n Initially, he had made the wrong judgment in a fit of anger.\n However, Han Aoyu still felt pretty insecure to have such a good-looking, young, and single good friend by his grand daughter-in-law\u2019s side. He asked Han Aoyu with a smile, \u201cDoes Xiaoyan have a girlfriend?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was afraid that Han Aoyu\u2019s next sentence would be to introduce a girlfriend to him and hurriedly said, \u201cWe have a girlfriend now and we\u2019re cohabiting.\u201d\n Hearing that, Han Aoyu was completely relieved.\n \u201cGrandpa, Brother Jiang, it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d Han Zhan took off his apron and stood at the kitchen door to call them over for dinner.\n Hearing this, Yan Jiang felt very smug. He regretted not being able to use his cell phone to record Han Zhan\u2019s words.\n Han Zhan and Song Ci were busy setting up the table. Song Ci held the bowl and asked Han Zhan secretly, \u201cBrother Han, what kind of girl does Grandpa like? Tell me, I will try to leave a good impression on him.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cOne that can eat.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly stunned. One that can eat?\n How much must she eat?\n Han Zhan picked up the bottle of red wine and asked Yan Jiang, \u201cBrother Jiang, this is personally brewed by my grandfather. Do you want to try it?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Han Zhan poured a glass for Yan Jiang and another for Song Ci and himself. After that, he put down the bottle. Obviously, there was none for Han Aoyu.\n Han Aoyu coughed and knocked on the empty glass in front of him. Han Zhan glanced at Han Aoyu and said mercilessly, \u201cYou have high blood pressure. You can\u2019t drink.\u201d\n Han Aoyu felt that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t giving him face. Everyone at the table was drinking\u2014if he didn\u2019t drink, it would be so embarrassing. \u201cGive me a little, just a little.\u201d Han Aoyu tried to bargain with Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "77": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-78\n\n Chapter 77: The Han Family Men Won\u2019t Marry Twice.  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Hearing this conversation, Song Ci felt amused but didn\u2019t dare to really laugh.\n She picked up the red wine bottle on the table and said to Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t listen to Brother Han. I know that people with high blood pressure can drink a little bit of dry red wine. You just need to drink less than 50ml.\u201d\n Han Aoyu laughed. \u201cLittle Song is just so nice.\u201d He glanced at Han Zhan, who had a helpless expression beside Song Ci, and said in a sarcastic manner, \u201cNot like some people who are heartless. I\u2019ve raised you for more than 30 years in vain.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt wronged.\n Song Ci really only poured a little for Han Aoyu.\n Han Aoyu picked up the wine glass and took a whiff. A nostalgic expression appeared on his face. \u201cSpeaking of which, your grandmother brewed wine better, but I can\u2019t make it taste like hers.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s grandmother had passed away five years ago.\n Perhaps Old Master didn\u2019t miss that wine, but rather the person who brewed it. Song Ci said, \u201cIn Song Ci\u2019s eyes, Grandpa\u2019s wine is already very rich and wonderful. It\u2019s a pity that I didn\u2019t get the chance to taste Grandma\u2019s wine-making skills. If there\u2019s a chance, I must ask Grandpa about this wine brewing method.\u201d\n Han Aoyu laughed heartily and slapped his thigh. \u201cWhen the grapes ripe next year, come to my place and I\u2019ll teach you!\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s taste buds were stimulated by them. He took a sip of the wine and was instantly stunned. \u201cIt\u2019s so delicious. Grandpa, did you really brew this wine?\u201d\n Han Aoyu raised his head proudly. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n Yan Jiang gave a big round of applause and praised him, \u201cThis wine is very mellow and doesn\u2019t lose to those so-called famous French wines. Grandpa is awesome!\u201d Yan Jiang pointed at that red wine bottle and asked Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, can you prepare some for me later so that I can bring it back?\u201d\n Han Zhan, \u201d Okay.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, let\u2019s eat.\u201d With Han Aoyu\u2019s order, everyone picked up their chopsticks and started eating.\n At his old age, Han Aoyu had to control his appetite and not eat too much. He was basically full after just a few dishes, but he didn\u2019t leave the table and sat by the side to chat with the young man.\n Han Aoyu was slightly surprised to see Song Ci scoop another big bowl of rice after finishing it. He didn\u2019t expect this little girl to look so slender but have such a big appetite. It was a blessing to have such a big appetite.\n As Song Ci was putting the food into her bowl, she stole a glance at her grandfather. Seeing that he looked at her with satisfaction, she ate even more vigorously.\n Yan Jiang noticed that Song Ci had also finished her second bowl of rice. He was rather surprised but didn\u2019t say anything. Only Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were filled with amusement.\n After the meal, Han Zhan played chess with Old Master Han in the study. Song Ci had eaten too much and opened her drawer to take out a few slices of digestive biscuits. She then walked around the living room downstairs to digest her food.\n Yan Jiang sat on the sofa and ate the plums brought by Old Master. He complained to Song Ci. \u201cWhy did you eat so much?\u201d\n Song Ci said bitterly, \u201cGrandpa likes girls who can eat a lot.\u201d\n Yan Jiang blinked and pitied Song Ci very much. He glanced upstairs and asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat does Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather do?\u201d Although the old man was dressed like a farmer, his occasional casual glance had a murderous intent. It seemed like his identity was not simple.\n Song Ci said, \u201cSearch online, Han Aoyu.\u201d\n Yan Jiang followed her instructions.\n A moment later, Yan Jiang put down his cell phone in shock. He looked at Song Ci enviously and sighed. \u201cSong Song, you have married into a general\u2019s residence!\u201d\n Han Zhan was actually Han Aoyu\u2019s grandson! With such a background, Song Song would not be bullied ever again in her life.\n Yan Jiang was finally relieved. He got up and bid farewell. Before leaving, he didn\u2019t forget to carry the bag of fruits and the bottle of red wine personally brewed by Old Master Han.\n After sending Yan Jiang off, Song Ci sent Han Zhan a message. [Brother Han, where is Grandpa sleeping tonight?] There was only one bed in their house.\n Han Zhan saw the message and looked up to ask Old Master, \u201cGrandpa, where are you staying tonight?\u201d\n Han Aoyu stared at the chessboard and said, \u201cYour Uncle Zhong booked a room at the hotel. Just send me over later.\u201d\n \u201cNot going back to the residence?\u201d\n \u201cNo thanks. If others know that I am back, they will come and visit. It\u2019ll be so troublesome.\u201d Han Aoyu placed a chess piece down. \u201cSince I\u2019m retired, I\u2019ll do what a retired old man should do. Don\u2019t bother with what I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Han Aoyu\u2019s eyes saw through everything.\n Han Zhan admired his grandfather. Retiring after achieving success and staying out of worldly affairs was the most sensible thing to do.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cOh yes, the last time I saw your Grandpa Chen, he kept bragging about that chess set you gave him.\u201d The old master\u2019s tone was sour. What was this about? My own grandson had given a chess set to another old man, why didn\u2019t he give it to me? (italics)\n Han Zhan felt slightly helpless. He said, \u201cI went back to Shunchen on a work trip to visit Grandpa Chen. I couldn\u2019t possibly go empty-handed. That chess set was bought by Li Li. I have one too. I got it from the auction previously.\u201d\n Han Zhan got up and entered the small collection room in the study. Shortly after, he walked out holding a precious chess set.\n \u201cLittle Ye\u2019s red sandalwood chess, top-grade, the work of the great sculptor Song Shan.\u201d\n Han Zhan handed the chess set to Han Aoyu.\n Han Aoyu opened it and took a few glances, before feeling satisfied.\n Stroking the chess set, Han Aoyu started talking to Han Zhan about Song Ci. \u201cSong Ci, this little girl, is good with words and is a pretty good girl. She can match with you and her looks are rather compatible. As for her character, I don\u2019t know about it much, but I believe in your taste.\u201d\n Han Zhan listened quietly and didn\u2019t retort.\n Han Aoyu continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you two got married, but you must remember that there has never been a second marriage for the men of the Han Family. No matter if it\u2019s yours or not yours. Once it\u2019s by your side, it must be yours.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart shuddered as he understood Han Aoyu\u2019s warning.\n Han Aoyu was very smart, how could he not see the strangeness of this marriage between Han Zhan and Song Ci? But he wouldn\u2019t pursue the matter. He was trying to warn Han Zhan that Song Ci was not a bad girl. Since she had taken the initiative to send herself to him, regardless of whether she was hypocritical or sincere, she had to be by his side forever.\n There was no second marriage for the men of the Han Family.\n \u201cI understand, Grandpa.\u201d\n After 9pm, Old Master was about to leave. Song Ci and Han Zhan personally sent him back to the hotel. When they arrived, Song Ci saw a middle-aged man in the room. He had bronzed skin and a square face. He didn\u2019t look like a man of many words.\n \u201cZhanzhan.\u201d A smile appeared on Uncle Zhong\u2019s face when he saw Han Zhan. He stared at Song Ci, who was behind Han Zhan, and his smile became even warmer. \u201cIs this your lover?\u201d\n Han Zhan turned sideways and revealed Song Ci\u2019s full face to Uncle Zhong. \u201cUncle Zhong, this is my wife, Song Ci.\u201d Han Zhan introduced Song Ci again. \u201cSong Ci, this is Uncle Zhong. He watched me grow up and he takes care of my grandfather.\u201d\n \u201cHello, Uncle Zhong.\u201d\n \u201cHi.\u201d\n The couple chatted with Uncle Zhong for about 20 minutes, before taking their leave.\n Zhong Buhui watched as Han Zhan and his wife left. He closed the door and turned to enter the master bedroom. Seeing Han Aoyu unscrewing the medicine bottle, he hurriedly walked over to pour a glass of water for Han Aoyu and offered it to him.\n Han Aoyu picked up the cup and swallowed the medicine. He put down the cup and muttered. \u201cI keep thinking that Song Ci looks somewhat familiar. Buhui, do you feel the same way?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Hearing Mulan\u2019s name suddenly made Han Aoyu\u2019s chest ache and his expression sorrowful.\n Han Ao looked up at Zhong Buhui with a hesitant expression. \u201cDo they look alike?\u201d\n Zhong Buhui nodded. \u201cThey do look somewhat alike. Not in terms of skin, but in terms of bones. The charm between their brows is very similar.\u201d\n \u201cNo wonder...\u201d He knew that Song Ci looked familiar. On second thought, she did indeed look like his daughter Mulan.\n Han Aoyu sighed sadly and said, \u201cZhanzhan was already seven years old when Mulan left.\u201d A seven-year-old child already remembered things. Mulan\u2019s death had a huge impact on Han Zhan. Han Zhan seldom mentioned his deceased mother all these years, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t miss her.\n Han Aoyu already felt that Han Zhan suddenly getting married to a woman was too rushed and he felt strange about it. After discovering that Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s mother looked somewhat alike, Han Aoyu felt relieved instead.\n \u201cZhanzhan lost his mother when he was young. Perhaps he felt a sense of attachment when he saw Song Ci and chose her.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui also felt that this guess was very logical. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n ...\n The hotel wasn\u2019t far from Han Zhan\u2019s house and they could reach it within 10 minutes by car. It was already 10.30pm when Song Ci and Han Zhan came out of the hotel. Han Zhan was someone who was used to sleeping early, so the two of them didn\u2019t hang out outside and just drove home.\n Sitting in the passenger seat, Song Ci rubbed her stomach and asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhen is Grandpa going back?\u201d\n \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cLeaving tomorrow?\u201d Song Ci was slightly shocked. She sat up straight and said, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he staying for a few more days? I have nothing to do anyway. I can take care of him and accompany him on a walk around Wangdong City.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt\u2019s slightly troublesome.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s troublesome?\u201d\n Seeing that Song Ci didn\u2019t understand, Han Zhan explained. \u201cHe has a special identity. If anyone knows that he came to Wangdong City, there will definitely be people coming to visit. Grandpa said that after he retires, he won\u2019t ask about official matters anymore.\u201d\n Song Ci thought for a moment, before finally understanding why Han Aoyu was in such a hurry to go home. She couldn\u2019t help but sigh in admiration. \u201cGrandpa is indeed a person who has seen it all.\u201d\n The car stopped in the basement and the two of them took the lift up. Song Ci looked at the two figures reflected on the wall, thought of something, and hooked Han Zhan\u2019s left hand with her right hand. \u201cBrother Han.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Song Ci hinted to him. \u201cWho am I to you?\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly stunned.\n What kind of strange question is this?\n Somehow, Han Zhan felt that the answer should be a joke. He said with uncertainty, \u201cYou are my yo-yo?\u201d In the past few years, this joke had been very popular and Han Zhan had also heard of it.\n Song Ci\u2019s face froze and she nearly broke down. She laughed and pouted. \u201cNo, think again.\u201d He had called her so naturally just now and she had been touched for a long time.\n For a moment, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t think of anything, so he looked down and sized Song Ci up. Song Ci\u2019s lashes were very long. At this moment, her eyelids were slightly lowered, and her lashes cast a row of grayish-green shadows on the porcelain-white skin under her eyes. Her lashes quivered, and that shadow changed accordingly.\n She looked extremely mesmerizing.\n Han Zhan was enlightened. \u201cBaby Ci.\u201d The man\u2019s deep voice had a bewitching quality to it, which rung above Song Ci\u2019s head.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes widened with joy. \u201cHow did you think of this name?\u201d Song Ci was shocked to hear Han Zhan suddenly call her Baby Ci that night.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI just feel that it suits you quite well.\u201d She was many people\u2019s Song Ci, Song Song, but she was destined to only be his Baby Ci.\n Song Ci rubbed her earlobes awkwardly and muttered. \u201cAt least you have good taste.\u201d\n Walking out of the lift, Han Zhan kept staring at Song Ci\u2019s reddened ears. Returning home, Song Ci washed up first. Han Zhan sat by the bed and changed Song Ci\u2019s contact name to Baby Ci, as well as her Wechat name.\n Song Ci came out of the shower and applied moisturizing cream on her body. She wasn\u2019t wearing pyjamas and only had on a loose bathrobe. \u201cBrother Han, go take a shower.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n The newly-bought makeup table was already here. Song Ci was sitting at the table doing her skincare routine. When Han Zhan came out of the shower, he saw that Song Ci was still fiddling with her bottles. He raised his brows and felt that it was not easy for girls\u2014especially beautiful girls.\n Han Zhan looked at the time. It was 11.30pm.\n We have to sleep.\n He laid down on one side of the bed and left the other side for Song Ci. After applying the facial cream, Song Ci went into the cloakroom to change into pyjamas, got into bed, and squeezed under the blankets. The moment she got on the bed, Han Zhan could smell a faint scent on her. \u201cWhat moisturizer did you put on?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cGreen tea-flavored.\u201d She said, \u201cI am a green tea bitch.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled.\n He wanted to hug Song Ci to sleep but hesitated and didn\u2019t dare to reach out his hand. Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cThey said that men are born to kiss. When kissing, their Adam\u2019s apple will move up and down.\u201d\n Han Zhan opened his eyes and looked at her with a burning gaze. Not knowing what she meant, he asked, \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\n Song Ci flipped over and supported her head with her hand. Her seductive eyes were filled with all sorts of charm. Han Zhan felt goosebumps all over his body from her stare. Song Ci said, \u201cI want to see your Adam\u2019s apple bobble.\u201d\n If Han Zhan could endure it, he was not a man.\n ...\n The next morning.\n Han Zhan stood in the room, put on his tie and picked up his watch to glance at the time.\n .30am.\n This was the first time Han Zhan woke up late in so many years. He glanced at Song Ci, who was sleeping soundly on the bed, and his lips suddenly curled up in a self-deprecating manner. Han Zhan, oh, Han Zhan, you claim to be a gentleman with good sense, but in front of beauty, you\u2019re nothing.\n You should just be human.\n [fuzzy]When Han Zhan arrived at the office with his briefcase, Li Li couldn\u2019t help but shake his head when he saw him. \u201cTsk tsk tsk, Mr. Han, how rare. You\u2019re actually late.\u201d Han Zhan glanced at him mildly and entered the office without a word.\n How could Li Li understand the sweet sorrow of a married man?\n Li Li followed Han Zhan into the office. Once the door was closed, his smile faded and his expression turned serious. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to accompany you on this business trip.\u201d\n Aoyu Number 1 would be officially launched in the European and American markets tomorrow. There were many events that needed to be handled during the launch of the new product and this business trip would take up to a week. Li Li was supposed to accompany Han Zhan but something cropped up and he could not leave.\n As they were newlyweds, Han Zhan had just experienced the joys of being a married couple and didn\u2019t really want to be separated from Song Ci. He had originally planned to let Li Li go to America on a work trip alone, while he stayed home to accompany Song Ci. It looked like he couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\n Han Zhan took off his suit and hung it on the hanger, before unbuttoning his shirt. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Li Li rubbed his brows in frustration and said in a low voice, \u201cMy mother is going for a minor surgery and I need to accompany her.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly shocked and showed concern on his face. \u201cHasn\u2019t Auntie always been in good health? What surgery is she undergoing?\u201d\n Li Li said, \u201cIt\u2019s a uterine tumor. I need to be by her side to feel assured.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s no small surgery.\u201d It went without saying how important a uterus was to a woman.\n Han Zhan was not an unreasonable boss and immediately agreed.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

When it was time for lunch, Han Zhan went home early with the excuse of going on a work trip and had lunch with Song Ci.\n Song Ci had already helped him pack his luggage into two large suitcases. in the morning. She was very good at packing luggage, as she separated his work suit and banquet suits, even matching his cufflinks, collar pins, wristwatches and ties.\n Looking at the packed luggages, Han Zhan felt a sense of reluctance for the first time. Song Ci saw that Han Zhan was staring at the luggage frowning without speaking. She controlled her reluctance and reminded Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, you should go to the airport now. If you don\u2019t leave now, you might miss the flight.\u201d\n This business trip would involve transferring flights at many countries. The application process for a private jet overseas was very cumbersome. In order to save costs and time, Han Zhan wanted to board Zeus Airlines\u2019 airplane with his colleague.\n If he missed the boarding time, he could only wait for the next trip.\n Han Zhan glanced at Song Ci and suddenly said, \u201cDo you want to...\u201d But Han Zhan didn\u2019t speak again. Is it too clingy to bring my wife along on a work trip?\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cMmm?\u201d She asked Han Zhan, \u201cAre you asking me if I want you to bring a present back?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201c...Mmm.\u201d\n Song Ci shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t lack anything. But I like whatever Brother Han gives me.\u201d\n Han Zhan, \u201d Okay.\u201d\n Thinking of what happened at Li Li\u2019s side, Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cOh yes, Li Li\u2019s mother will undergo an operation tomorrow afternoon. It\u2019s a uterine tumor, so she needs to have her womb removed.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci hurriedly said, \u201cHow about this, I will go to the hospital for you tomorrow and accompany Li Li beside Auntie until she wakes up.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, thank you.\u201d\n Han Zhan kept feeling like he had forgotten to say something. He stared at Song Ci\u2019s face and the two of them faced each other in silence. After a while, Han Zhan said, \u201cNo stealing ice cream, no drinking ice water, drink more warm water, dry your hair before sleeping at night...\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci felt like rolling her eyes. She suggested sincerely, \u201cBrother Han, why are you so worried about me? Do you want to cast a spell on me to turn me into a keychain accessory, so you can hang me on your belt everywhere you go?\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled.\n He shut his mouth and thought for a moment, before reaching out to caress Song Ci\u2019s face gently. \u201cI wanted to say that I really can\u2019t bear to part with you.\u201d\n Song Ci, who was glib-tongued, suddenly felt slightly embarrassed. \u201cMmm, I-I can\u2019t bear to either.\u201d But immediately, a smile surfaced on Song Ci\u2019s face. She clenched her fists at Han Zhan and encouraged him. \u201cWork hard, earn more money, and earn enough money for your child to have milk powder and diapers.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart was filled with melancholy. She didn\u2019t love me. She only loved my handsome looks and my money-making skills...\n In the end, Han Zhan still went to the airport alone.\n ...\n After sending Han Zhan off, Song Ci got Long Yu to drive her back to the Mu Family residence.\n The relationship between Song Ci and the Mu Family was very awkward now. She was still the adopted daughter of the Mu Family in name, but in reality, Mu Mian had already kicked Song Ci out of the family. Song Ci made a quick calculation. Over the past eight years, the Mu Family had spent five to six million yuan on grooming her. Adding on Song Fei\u2019s medical fees, it was a total of 15 million yuan.\n Song Ci was thinking of earning some money as soon as possible to return the money that the Mu Family had spent on her and her sister. Song Ci would only have a clear conscience then.\n Hearing that Song Ci had come, Mu Qiu, who was tidying up her room, asked Auntie Zhang to inform Song Ci to come upstairs.\n Song Ci arrived on the second floor and knocked on Mu Qiu\u2019s door.\n \u201cCome in, elder sister.\u201d Mu Qiu sounded very happy and pleased.\n Song Ci pushed open the door and glanced inside. Mu Qiu\u2019s room was similar to Song Ci\u2019s, but the wallpaper was light blue and looked elegant. Mu Qiu was changing clothes in the cloakroom. Song Ci waited for a while before seeing her walk out.\n Song Ci felt slightly out of place at the sight of Mu Qiu\u2019s outfit. Mu Qiu was wearing a bike-style white t-shirt and a pair of tight denim shorts. Her long hair was in a high ponytail. She was holding onto a pair of strappy Roman sandals. She smiled mischievously and asked Song Ci, \u201cDoes this pair of shoes match this outfit?\u201d\n Mu Qiu usually dressed demurely and obediently. This was the first time Song Ci saw such a cool style on her.\n \u201cA pair of flat shoes would be more suitable.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d Mu Qiu turned around and entered the cloakroom. Shortly after, she walked out wearing flat canvas shoes.\n Song Ci sat on her bed and noticed a piece of white A4 paper on the dresser. On the top of the paper were the words \u201cBucket List\u201d. Song Ci asked Mu Qiu, \u201cCan I take a look at this?\u201d\n Mu Qiu pressed the paper against Song Ci\u2019s chest. \u201cThis is my bucket list. I will share it with you.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s chest was suddenly patted and she recalled some unhappy memory, causing her body to stiffen slightly. She slowly lowered her head and looked at that hand on her chest that was holding the bucket list. It was as if she had returned to the scene before her death in her previous life. That day, the 30-year-old Mu Qiu also pressed gently on Song Ci\u2019s chest like now, asking innocently if Song Ci could give her heart.\n A chill ran down Song Ci\u2019s spine as her muscles tensed up. She couldn\u2019t even maintain the smile on her face.\n Noticing Song Ci\u2019s odd expression, Mu Qiu thought that she was upset about her condition and comforted her instead. \u201cDon\u2019t put on such an expression. I am not dead yet. Moreover, death is not that scary.\u201d\n Song Ci acknowledged and opened the bucket list. It read:\n Bucket list before I die:\n Number one: Ride a motorcycle once.\n Number two: Attend a funeral.\n Number three: Help five poor children study.\n Number four: Tell the truth to someone.\n Number five: Meet my beloved idol, Du Xueyan.\n Number six: Choose a suitable grave for yourself.\n Number seven: Wear a wedding gown once to take a solo wedding photo.\n Number 8: Sleeping with a handsome single man.\n ...\n ]Song Ci finished reading the bucket list and felt very puzzled. Judging from this list, Mu Qiu\u2019s character was pure and kind, so what exactly caused Mu Qiu to become so mischievous?\n Mu Qiu picked up the black-red helmet on the dresser, held her small bag, and asked Song Ci, \u201cSister, do you want to ride the motorcycle with me?\u201d\n Song Ci returned the list to Mu Qiu and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mu Qiu had borrowed a cool-looking motorbike from a friend and found an abandoned old school road. Mu Qiu had only spent an hour learning from her friend, and had mastered the basics and knew how to balance the motorbike. Fortunately, the roads were flat and smooth, and there were no sharp turns. Mu Qiu drove rather happily.\n Song Ci only returned home after dinner with Mu Qiu.\n Song Ci arrived at the hospital at 7am the next day for Mother Li\u2019s surgery. At 8.40am, Song Ci and Li Li accompanied Mother Li into the operating theater. At the door of the operating theater, Mother Li held Li Li\u2019s hand tightly and gave him a meaningful look.\n Humans had a natural fear of surgeries. Mother Li was afraid that she would never be able to open her eyes again, after entering the operating theater. As a result, she wanted to engrave the child\u2019s face deeply in her mind.\n Of course Li Li understood his mother\u2019s fear. He stroked her slightly white hair and choked on his words. He said, \u201cI will wait for you to come out, mother.\u201d\n Only then did Mother Li release her grip and was pushed into the operating theater by the nurse.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "80": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-81\n\n Chapter 80: He Deserves To Be Rich All His Life  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Song Ci stood aside and watched the scene unfold, feeling rather upset. The two of them sat quietly in the waiting area for a few hours. Only at 1pm did the doctor inform Li Li to prepare to receive his mother.\n Mother Li was dazed and her eyes were darting around when she was pushed out. Only when Li Li grabbed her hand and she vaguely heard him call her mother, did Mother Li feel at ease and stopped moaning.\n After returning to the ward and settling Mother Li down, Li Li went to the toilet to secretly wipe his tears. Song Ci couldn\u2019t help but think of her own parents. Li Li was so fortunate to still be able to accompany her mother in her surgery and be filial to her, but she had already lost hers long ago.\n The last time Song Ci saw her mother, Jiang Mengmeng, and father, Song Tingyun, was at the site of the earthquake. Her parents\u2019 bodies were laid out alongside the bodies of many victims. The paramedics carried antiseptic sprayers and disinfected their bodies.\n Song Ci felt very lonely as she thought of her deceased parents and her sleeping elder sister.\n A moment later, Li Li came out with slightly reddened eyes. He smiled sheepishly at Song Ci and thanked her. \u201cThank you for accompanying me today, Sister-in-law.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly embarrassed. She was still not used to being called sister-in-law by a man who was five to six years older than her. Glancing at the half-asleep Mother Li, Song Ci said to Li Li, \u201cAuntie must be very proud to have such an outstanding son like you.\u201d\n Li Li thought of the past and rubbed his face. \u201cMy mother brought me up herself. When I was young, my father hit someone with his car and fled for his life. After he came home, my mother and I advised him to turn himself in. But he was a coward and just jumped out of the window in front of us...\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s tone was calm but Song Ci was stunned. She apologized in a low voice like a little kid who had done something wrong. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you apologizing? The person who should be apologizing is already dead.\u201d Li Li looked at his mother\u2019s aged face and said softly, \u201cI was only 12 years old the year my father died. All the money in the family went to compensate the victim\u2019s orphan. Because of my father, that lady lost her parents. She is the most pitiful one.\u201d\n \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any money at home. My mother, who has been a housewife all this while, had no choice but to come out to work. She sells fish at the market and works from dawn to dusk. She kills fish everyday and now her wrists and shoulders are hurting badly.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci stared at Mother Li\u2019s aged face and sighed. \u201cLuckily, Auntie\u2019s efforts were all worth it.\u201d\n Li Li smiled. \u201cI am her only hope. I cannot disappoint her.\u201d\n \u201cActually, at the beginning, her fish shop business was not good either. I was admitted to Wangdong High School in my third year of junior high school. At that time, my family was so poor that I couldn\u2019t even afford my school fees. I nearly dropped out of school to work. Later, I met a kind-hearted person who sponsored my studies. I successfully finished high school and entered Wangdong University\u2019s School of Economics and Management.\u201d\n After hearing Li Li\u2019s description, Song Ci also felt relieved and happy for him. \u201cYou are very lucky to meet such a good person.\u201d\n Li Li acknowledged and said in a low voice, \u201cMr. Han is a good person. Without him, there wouldn\u2019t be me.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that the kind person who sponsored your studies was Han Zhan?\u201d\n Li Li nodded.\n Li Li was amused by Song Ci\u2019s shock. \u201cMiss Song, what kind of person do you think Mr. Han is? Not only did he sponsor me, but he also sponsored many others. All the money he receives during the festive seasons is used to help those children who really needed help.\u201d\n \u201cI, Bei Zhan, and a few colleagues whom you haven\u2019t met before are all children who have received Mr. Han\u2019s sponsorship.\u201d And those children had now become the general managers and backbones of several major companies under Han Zhan.\n Song Ci was truly stunned. \u201cI see...\u201d She smiled awkwardly and said,\u201d He is rather far-sighted. All his investments have paid off, right? \u201d\n Li Li shook his head in disagreement. \u201cYou still don\u2019t know him well enough.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s expression turned serious. She asked Li Li, \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\n Li Li said, \u201cThere are at least 80 students under Mr. Han\u2019s sponsorship, if not a hundred. But we\u2019re the only ones who really work for him. The rest don\u2019t even know who helped them finish their studies.\u201d\n \u201cIf not for the fact that he was discharged from the army due to an injury and became a businessman instead, thus needing a group of loyal subordinates, all of us would never be able to meet Mr. Han.\u201d To the other people who benefitted from Mr. Han, he was just a mysterious and kind person.\n Li Li stared at Song Ci sternly. He said in a serious tone, \u201cMr. Han has always helped others without wanting anything in return.\u201d\n Song Ci got to know a different Han Zhan from Li Li. She was someone who only cared about profits, and thought that Han Zhan was like her, always minding his own personal gains and losses. However, she forgot that there were really people in this world who did good deeds without asking for anything in return.\n Han Zhan was such a person in his previous life. He organized a charity convalescent hospital, set up a charity foundation, fixed Hope Primary School, and set up a \u201cHomecoming\u201d to help those abducted women, children, and illegal workers find their homes and help their family reunite.\n Han Zhan deserves to be rich all his life!\n Thinking that such a kind Han Zhan had chosen her, Song Ci felt like a toad that had just eaten swan meat. She had to become better to be worthy of such an outstanding and sincere Han Zhan!\n Song Ci stayed in the hospital until it was almost dark, before returning home. After reaching home, she sent Han Zhan a message to inform him that Mother Li\u2019s surgery was successful and to reassure him.\n After sending the message, Song Ci entered the kitchen to prepare dinner. Han Zhan was not at home and Song Ci had her diet meal again. After dinner, she thought for a moment before opening her laptop and logging into QQ, which she had not logged in for a long time.\n Based on her memory, Song Ci searched for an unfamiliar QQ number and clicked add.\n Song Ci came out of the shower and saw that her QQ profile was flashing.\n She perked up. It\u2019s here!\n Song Ci opened the message and saw that it was a verified message. Song Ci had added a new friend with the online name \u201csuperstar\u201d. The person\u2019s avatar was a microphone with the words \u201csuperstar\u201d printed on it.\n This person\u2019s avatar and online name gave off a silly vibe.\n Song Ci opened the dialog box, thought for a moment, typed a message, and sent it over. She then turned off her laptop and went to bed.\n ...\n Meanwhile, a nameless artiste called Liang Bo was standing in the kitchen, preparing a steamed cake. Today, he had browsed Weibo and watched a popular video titled \u201cCakes can be made without ovens\u201d. He was in high spirits and wanted to experiment with it.\n As the most handsome member and lead singer of an 18th-tier male idol group, Liang Bo was so bored that he had to stay home and make cakes. One could imagine just how pathetic their male idol group was.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

They had only debuted for two years, yet they had already experienced a tragic ending.\n The first three months after the male band debuted, they were very popular and were in the limelight. But three months later, all sorts of scandals broke out one after another. The leader lied and caused his fans to get pregnant, and the lead dancer and a certain famous female actress were photographed \u201cpracticing eating bananas\u201d in the car late at night. The entire team was ruined.\n Just last week, the slightly more popular lead rapper took the initiative to leave the group and join another company to seek a better future. Another team member felt that the entertainment circle was too scary, and went home to inherit billions of assets.\n There were only three men left in the previous team of five. The other two were still involved in scandals, and only Liang Bo was upright. It was heart-wrenching.\n Liang Bo was now recuperating. His manager had gone to take care of some newbies and his boss had almost forgotten about him, the little prince of music. Liang Bo\u2019s savings were almost gone. In order to live, he had even worn a face mask to deliver takeout today. It was quite sad.\n Realizing that the QQ icon was vibrating, Liang Bo opened it.\n A long string of messages appeared before his eyes.\n [Hi, Liang Bo. I am Song Ci. You might have heard of me.\n Are you interested in doing something big with me?\n I know that your team is about to disband. You are not Chen Shuo and have no reputation to speak of. You are also not in Jiang Ducheng, who has billions to inherit. Once your team is completely disbanded, you won\u2019t have a way out. How about this? Do you want to collaborate with me? We will be partners. I will compose for you and you will be in charge of the lyrics and performance. I will give you the opportunity to perform on stage. I will only be your teammate behind the scenes. Our profits will be split 4:1, you can take 80% and I\u2019ll take 20%.\n I look forward to your reply.]\n The cash-strapped Song Ci turned her attention to Liang Bo.\n In her previous life, after Liang Bo\u2019s men\u2019s team was disbanded, he left the entertainment circle and went home to study acupuncture with his grandfather, who had been researching Traditional Chinese Medicine all his life. Many years later, he rose to fame with a video of him performing acupuncture on the streets to save a homeless man who suffered a heart attack.\n Due to that video, Liang Bo was coveted by the CEO of Yu Hua Company. He was poached by Yu Hua to sign a contract and repackaged to debut again. This time, Liang Bo shot to fame and embarked on the path to stardom.\n As for Song Ci, she was Liang Bo\u2019s most admired composer. Song Ci could come up with the most touching songs for him, and the two of them worked very well together. She helped him win the championship trophy and he helped her win the gold medal as a composer.\n In this life, Liang Bo was still a young lad, while Song Ci had the talent and experience of her previous life. Liang Bo would definitely favor her!\n After reading Song Ci\u2019s message, Liang Bo smiled ambiguously. \u201cAnother liar!\u201d Why would a fairy like Song Ci take the initiative to look for me?\n Liang Bo glanced at the steaming rice cooker and replied lazily: Who are you, bro? Of all people, why must you pretend to be Song Ci? Who are you to pretend to be my goddess?\n Liang Bo had the good fortune to meet Song Ci at a fashion dinner. The beautiful Song Ci had been standing beside that handsome Yan Jiang that night, so Liang Bo only dared to look at her from afar and didn\u2019t go up to greet her.\n The probability that Song Ci would take the initiative to look for him was like a pie dropping from the sky.\n After replying, Liang Bo thought that it was time for the cake to be cooked. He put down his laptop and opened the rice cooker. Lowering his head, Liang Bo cursed, \u201cF*ck! Those trash videos are bullying me!\u201d\n Liang Bo tore off a piece of the hard cake. It was shriveled and disgusting.\n Liang Bo poured the failed cake away and fell asleep. The next day, Liang Bo saw Song Ci\u2019s reply.\n Song Ci: Oh, so I am your goddess.\n Liang Bo pursed his lips. He thought to himself, \u2018this guy is quite dramatic\u2019.\n Liang Bo took a big gulp of water and replied to Song Ci in a teasing manner: [To be honest, Song Ci is not only my goddess but also my girlfriend. You have to keep this a secret.]\n Song Ci: [To be honest, my husband\u2019s surname is Han. I really don\u2019t know when I cheated with a man called Liang Bo.]\n Liang Bo was speechless. He thought to himself that this guy was rather dramatic.\n Liang Bo: [Since we\u2019re lovers, we must be discreet.]\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t be bothered to continue bantering with this dumbass. She directly sent a video request over. Liang Bo was momentarily stunned when he saw the request, before laughing in exasperation.\n Great. Even a conman is so arrogant these days.\n Did he think that I didn\u2019t dare to accept the call?\n Liang Bo accepted the call very calmly. The call went through and Liang Bo glanced at the other party with interest, wanting to see just where this fool came from. The other party was so thick-skinned and practically thought that he was invincible.\n However, when he saw the woman\u2019s face in the video, Liang Bo was stunned.\n \u201cDamn... damn!\u201d\n Liang Bo covered his mouth as his face turned red.\n She really is my goddess!\n Liang Bo looked down at his white singlet and flowery pants, feeling like he was going crazy. He quickly got up and hurriedly said, \u201cI have something on!\u201d, before disappearing from the computer like he was escaping from a desert.\n Liang Bo quickly opened the wardrobe and selected a light blue shirt and black pants. He even styled his hair.\n Taking a few deep breaths in front of the mirror, Liang Bo sat back down in front of the computer. He looked rather handsome in his weird form.\n Seeing that the woman on the other end of the screen had disappeared, Liang Bo tried to call out, \u201cGoddess?\u201d But he felt that this form of address was too inappropriate and hurriedly changed it. \u201cMiss Song, are you still there?\u201d\n Song Ci returned with a glass of warm water. She was wearing a conservative cotton dress and had yet to remove her neck brace, but it didn\u2019t affect her beauty.\n \u201cOh.\u201d Song Ci sized Liang Bo up and teased him. \u201cWhere are your flowery pants?\u201d\n Liang Bo blushed again. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me, Miss Song.\u201d Liang Bo felt utterly embarrassed.\n Song Ci coughed and said to Liang Bo, \u201cBack to the topic, have you considered my offer?\u201d\n After confirming that Song Ci was not joking, Liang Bo became serious.\n Liang Bo said, \u201cHow would I know if you have the capability?\u201d Although he was a minor nondescript singer, Liang Bo had his own pride. It was already a huge mistake for him to debut as a member of a male band. Now that he was finally going to regain his freedom, Liang Bo would never so rashly tie his future to an unfamiliar woman.\n Song Ci said, \u201cWait here.\u201d Song Ci sent Liang Bo an audio file and logged off.\n The moment she logged off, Song Ci received a call from Han Zhan.\n Song Ci was planning to visit Mother Li at the hospital, when she suddenly received a call from Han Zhan. Song Ci was slightly surprised. \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019re still awake?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI was asleep but I woke up again.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you suffering from insomnia?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cNo,\u201d and asked Song Ci, \u201cYou\u2019re on the internet? There was a lot of incoming and outgoing data at home just now. What are you doing?\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked.\n Damn, Brother Han is even monitoring the incoming and outgoing data at home?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

I know a singer and intend to collaborate with him. I will compose for him and he will give me 20% of the profits.\u201d\n Song Ci thought Han Zhan would ask her if the singer was male or female, but Han Zhan asked, \u201cAre you very short of money?\u201d\n \u201cMmm... I am short of money.\u201d Song Ci, who was short of money, was slightly shy.\n Han Zhan wanted to say that he could help her. But before he could say that, Han Zhan remembered that night by the side of the street, Song Ci had cried and confessed her feelings to him. In the end, Han Zhan decided not to interfere with Song Ci\u2019s decision.\n Song Ci had her pride and he decided to respect her decision.\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go to bed first.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n In the morning, Song Ci went to the hospital again. She was relieved to see that Mother Li was recovering well. When she returned home in the afternoon, Song Ci logged into QQ again and received Liang Bo\u2019s reply.\n Liang Bo: [Goddess, you are so awesome! I want to make it big with you!]\n Liang Bo: [But I am very curious, why did you choose me?]\n Liang Bo had already heard Song Ci\u2019s arrangement, and it was excellent. He had repeated the song the entire morning and improvised on it just now. In just 15 minutes, he had filled in the lyrics for Song Ci\u2019s arrangement.\n \u201cIn the past, you made me very happy. Now that I think about it, I feel very lonely. Love has turned me into the type of person I hate the most...\u201d Liang Bo hummed the lyrics. Together with Song Ci\u2019s melody, he felt that this song was going to be very popular.\n Song Ci stared at the second reply and smiled, before replying to Liang Bo: [I chose you because of your talent. What else did you think it was?]\n Liang Bo sent a shy emoticon. [Annoying, I thought you liked me.]\n Song Ci pursed her lips. She thought to herself that this guy indeed had a glib tongue.\n Song Ci: 18XXXX, this is my number. Call me if you need anything.\n Song Ci:[ I solemnly declare that I only love my Brother Han.] After sending the message, Song Ci logged off. She logged on to WeChat again and saw Mu Qiu\u2019s update.\n She said: [I went to attend an old stranger\u2019s funeral today. It was very quiet. No sorrowful sobs. No heart-wrenching nostalgia. Everyone bid farewell to the old man quietly as if they were chatting. I hope that after I die, no one will cry for me. I want to leave quietly.]\n Song Ci and Mu Qiu had several mutual good friends. She saw many people leaving messages to comfort Mu Qiu.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know what to say and pretended that she did not see it.\n The next day, Mu Qiu transferred all her savings to an educational charity organization. She picked five children who had no parents but were smart and eager to learn, saying that she was willing to use this money to fund their studies.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s every move was being monitored by Long Yu. He told Song Ci all the information he had gathered over the past few days in detail, over the phone.\n After hearing Long Yu\u2019s report and knowing that Mu Qiu had really used all her savings to help a stranger study, Song Ci\u2019s suspicions deepened. What exactly caused Mu Qiu to become like this?\n Song Ci was puzzled.\n Half an hour after ending the call with Long Yu, the doorbell rang again. Through the surveillance camera, Song Ci saw the girl in pink outside the door and her expression turned guarded.\n What is Mu Qiu doing here? Song Ci hesitated for a long while before opening the door.\n Mu Qiu was holding a few bottles of beer. She walked in, raised the bottles, and said to Song Ci with a smile, \u201cI heard Brother-in-law isn\u2019t at home. Big sister, let me drink with you.\u201d\n Both sisters knew how to drink. Last time in the Mu Family, under the starry sky during midsummer, the two sisters would also sit on the rooftop, drink beer bottles, and gossip about all sorts of things.\n Song Ci let Mu Qiu in.\n The two of them sat down on the floor in front of the French window. Song Ci looked at the bottles of beer and said, \u201cI\u2019ll make two side dishes?\u201d\n Mu Qiu tucked her long hair behind her ear. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci spent 20 minutes making cucumbers and stir-fried peanuts. She placed the dishes on a small table and sat down on the floor with Mu Qiu. Mu Qiu quickly opened the bottle cap and Song Ci warned her. \u201cYou are not suitable for drinking now.\u201d\n Mu Qiu smiled in relief. \u201cEvery day counts. Big sister, let me live a happier life.\u201d\n What else could Song Ci say?\n Mu Qiu took a sip of her drink and said, \u201cSchool has reopened and my dormitory mate asked me why I didn\u2019t go to school.\u201d Mu Qiu had been staying at school during her school days, and only came home during the holidays. Her dormitory mate saw that her bed was empty and thought she had moved out this semester.\n Mu Qiu shrugged and mocked herself. \u201cHow can I reply? Tell them that I am going to die, so I don\u2019t need to study anymore?\u201d\n Song Ci frowned at her but didn\u2019t respond to her mockery.\n Mu Qiu kept pouring the beer and finished three bottles very quickly, while Song Ci only finished one. Mu Qiu\u2019s alcohol tolerance was not as good as Song Ci\u2019s. After three bottles of beer, Mu Qiu\u2019s mind was actually somewhat groggy, but she was still conscious.\n She hugged the bottle and tilted her head to look at Song Ci.\n The setting sun shone through the French window and hit Song Ci\u2019s body. Her burgundy-colored short hair was covered in a layer of golden glow and her porcelain-white cheeks appeared even more exquisite and beautiful. Her tea-colored eyes were like a pair of pruning eyes and very beautiful. Even a girl like Mu Qiu would be charmed by them.\n \u201cYou\u2019re always like this,\u201d said Mu Qiu suddenly.\n Song Ci glanced sideways at her.\n Mu Qiu narrowed her eyes and said with a frown, \u201cSong Ci has the beauty of a rose, but the lofty and unyielding character of a winter plum. She is bewitching and not to be belittled. She is truly a regal flower.\u201d\n Song Ci sneered. \u201cWho said that? It\u2019s such an exaggeration.\u201d\n Mu Qiu chuckled. \u201cI had a crush on a senior in the past. He left this comment on your Weibo.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Mu Qiu reached out and stroked Song Ci\u2019s face, eyes, nose, and mouth. In the end, that hand pinched hard on Song Ci\u2019s cheek. \u201cDo you know how much I hate this face of yours?\u201d\n Song Ci slapped Mu Qiu\u2019s hand away and smiled coldly. \u201cI know now.\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook her head.\n She put down the bottle, leaned over, and hugged Song Ci. From afar, the two of them looked like sisters.\n Mu Qiu said to Song Ci, \u201cI hate you, Song Ci. From the first day you entered my house at the age of 13, I already hated you. Before you came, everyone praised me. They said I was smart and sensible and I would definitely make my parents proud in the future. But the moment you came, I became your accessory.\u201d\n \u201cI am pretty, but I am not as pretty as you.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, why did you come to my house?\u201d\n Why did I go to her house?\n I was there to be her heart supply! Song Ci felt very disgusted. She answered Mu Qiu expressionlessly. \u201cYou have to ask your father. He was the one who brought me back to the Mu Family.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was so angry that she cried. Her tears landed on Song Ci\u2019s shoulders and drenched her dress.\n After a long while, Mu Qiu released Song Ci\u2019s body. She looked at Song Ci\u2019s beautiful face with teary eyes and complained, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you die in that earthquake?\u201d\n They had completely fallen out.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

She told Mu Qiu quietly, \u201cBecause I have a tough life, so I can\u2019t die. Don\u2019t you find it infuriating?\u201d Even though she was later set up by Mu Qiu and Mu Mian and died an innocent death, she was still reborn.\n Her life was hard to claim and she was destined to stay around for an eternity.\n Mu Qiu wiped her tears. She opened another bottle and downed half of it, before lying weakly on the table as if she was drunk.\n Song Ci took the empty bottle from her hand and said, \u201cYou are drunk, Mu Qiu. I will call mother and get them to fetch you.\u201d\n Song Ci got up to get her cell phone. Before she walked far, she suddenly heard Mu Qiu mutter. \u201cI really wanted you dead, but when I heard you say that you were going to give me your heart, I actually felt touched and couldn\u2019t bear to...\u201d\n Song Ci stopped in her tracks. She turned back slowly and looked at the young lady hugging the bottle with a red face. \u201cMu Qiu, you are drunk.\u201d\n Mu Qiu remained silent and closed her eyes. She might have fallen asleep.\n Song Ci gave Du Tingting a call. Knowing that Mu Qiu was drunk at her place, Du Tingting said awkwardly, \u201cSong Song, your father went on a work trip and I am the only one at home. The driver has already knocked off. Can you let your sister stay over at your place tonight?\u201d\n Song Ci glanced at the sleeping Mu Qiu and could only agree.\n There was only one bed in the house, and there was no way Song Ci would let Mu Qiu sleep in her and Han Zhan\u2019s wedding room. She moved Mu Qiu onto the sofa and found a thin towel to cover her. Mu Qiu woke up once during the process and stared at Song Ci. After a look, she closed her eyes and fell asleep again.\n Song Ci returned to her room after Mu Qiu fell asleep.\n In the beginning, Song Ci couldn\u2019t fall asleep. She only felt slightly sleepy after midnight. After sleeping for an unknown period of time, she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her chest. Song Ci was awakened by that pain. She opened her eyes and saw a shocking scene \u2014\n A knife was stabbed into her chest. The silver knife was stained with some red blood. The hands holding the knife were slender like jade, and the wrists were slender and beautiful. The owner of those hands looked frail and thin, but at this moment, a vicious, cold expression appeared on her face.\n \u201cElder sister.\u201d Mu Qiu looked at Song Ci, who had awoken, and was slightly puzzled. \u201cHow did you wake up? I clearly put a large amount of knockout powder in your beer. You shouldn\u2019t have woken up.\u201d As she spoke, she twisted the knife in her hand.\n Her flesh was being stirred and the excruciating pain was indescribable. Song Ci was sweating profusely from the pain. She clenched the bedsheets and pleaded painfully, \u201cMu Qiu, can you let me go? Don\u2019t kill me. I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d\n Mu Qiu thought about it seriously, before shaking her head vehemently. \u201cNo way. You must give me your heart. Otherwise, I will die... I don\u2019t want to die either!\u201d She smiled mischievously and dug out Song Ci\u2019s heart!\n \u201cAh!\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly sat up straight. She instinctively reached out to touch her own chest but didn\u2019t feel any bloody hole. Her panicky emotions finally stabilized slightly.\n Placing her palm on her chest, Song Ci remained still and held her breath. Only when she felt her heart beating rhythmically did Song Ci heave a sigh of relief and recovered her senses.\n It turned out to be a dream.\n Song Ci was drenched in sweat from the nightmare. Her silk pyjamas were soaked, and even the bedsheets were moist. She touched her hair and realized that it was all wet. Afraid of catching a cold, Song Ci decided to change clothes before drying her hair.\n She got off the bed slowly. As soon as she stood up, her legs gave way and she sat down weakly on the floor. She leaned against the bed and waited for her body to recover, before getting up and entering the cloakroom.\n She put on another nightdress and was about to take a shower, when she suddenly thought of something and turned to leave the bedroom.\n Standing in the corridor on the second floor, Song Ci glanced down at the living room on the first floor.\n Where\u2019s Mu Qiu?\n There was only a neatly folded bedsheet on the black sofa, but Mu Qiu was nowhere to be seen. Song Ci went downstairs and touched the sofa\u2019s cushion. There was still some warmth left. \u201cQiu-er?\u201d Song Ci pushed open the toilet door but didn\u2019t see Mu Qiu inside.\n She left?\n Song Ci took out her cell phone and called Mu Qiu.\n ...\n In the darkness of the night, there were occasional night taxis cruising along the road.\n A slender figure was running on the sidewalk. She wiped her tears with the back of her hand as she ran. After more than 10 minutes, Mu Qiu finally stopped beside a dustbin.\n She tossed the silver dagger into the dustbin, as if she was throwing a piece of flint. Mu Qiu\u2019s hands were shaking as she looked at the dagger mixed in the litter. Her face was turning pale and her hands were trembling.\n At this point, the cell phone in her pocket suddenly rang. On this quiet night, the ringtone sounded piercing and eerie.\n Trembling, Mu Qiu took out her cell phone and saw that it was Song Ci calling. She answered the call mechanically and put it to her ear. Song Ci asked on the other end of the line, \u201cMu Qiu, where did you go so late at night!\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s lips moved but she didn\u2019t speak. Song Ci said, \u201cWhere are you? I am going to look for you.\u201d\n Mu Qiu clenched her fists. \u201cI can\u2019t fall asleep. I\u2019m going home first.\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cGo home?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cAre there taxis on the road?\u201d\n \u201cI drove here.\u201d\n \u201cNonsense! How can you drive when you are drunk!\u201d Song Ci\u2019s tone suddenly turned stern. \u201cStop the car by the side. You can either come back or call a cab.\u201d\n \u201cIn that case, I\u2019d better call a cab back.\u201d After hanging up the phone, Mu Qiu stood rooted to the ground, tears swimming in her eyes. Finally, Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t bear the fear anymore. She knelt on the ground beside the dustbin, covered her face with her hands, bent over, and cried bitterly.\n \u201cAhhh...\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s shoulders were shaking from her cries.\n What was I doing just now!\n I almost killed my elder sister!\n \u201cYoung lady.\u201d A clear, cold, and proud male voice rang out behind Mu Qiu, like water in a stream.\n Mu Qiu wiped her tears hastily. She knelt on the ground and slowly turned around. She saw a tall, muscular man standing behind her. He was wearing a black suit and black glasses. He looked very handsome and held a wad of tissues in his hand.\n A silver-gray sports car was parked beside him.\n \u201cWipe your tears?\u201d The man stretched out his hand with a piece of tissue in front of Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu took the tissue and said in a sobbing voice, \u201cThank you.\u201d After wiping her tears, Mu Qiu saw the man reach out his hand. He bent over and said to her, \u201cDo you need my help?\u201d\n Only then did Mu Qiu realize that she was still kneeling on the ground. Her face blushed as she placed her overly skinny, fair hand in the man\u2019s palm.\n The man helped Mu Qiu up and looked around before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get a cab nearby. Where are you staying? Let me send you back.\u201d\n Mu Qiu wanted to reject him, but hesitated when she saw his handsome face. \u201cPlease send me to the entrance of the Amethyst Gated Community.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "84": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-85\n\n Chapter 84: Cheng Yanmo  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Mu Qiu sat in the passenger seat. The man was driving personally. It was too quiet in the car and Mu Qiu felt awkward, so she took the initiative to start a conversation. She asked the man, \u201cWere you going home after work?\u201d\n \u201cKind of.\u201d After answering, perhaps the man felt that his brief reply would cause her to feel disregarded, so the man added. \u201cI just came back from a work trip.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d Mu Qiu occasionally glanced at the man beside her and felt that he looked somewhat familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere before, but she couldn\u2019t remember him at that moment. Mu Qiu felt uneasy and didn\u2019t speak much after that.\n After parking the car at the main entrance of the Amethyst Gated Community, the man spoke up to remind Mu Qiu who was in a daze. \u201cYoung lady, we have arrived.\u201d\n Mu Qiu snapped out of her trance and nodded at the man. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n \u201cNo need.\u201d\n Mu Qiu unfastened her seatbelt and alighted. She thanked the man again before entering the estate. Cheng Yanmo watched as Mu Qiu\u2019s frail figure disappeared at the end of the winding sidewalk, before he turned the car around and prepared to go home.\n Along the way, he received another call.\n Cheng Yanmo answered the call via bluetooth. \u201cHello?\u201d\n It was very noisy on the other end. After a long while, a man approached the phone and asked, \u201cHello, is this Master Cheng?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo glanced at the caller ID. It was Cheng Ziang.\n He understood what happened. \u201cMy brother is with you?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d The man on the other end said, \u201cSecond Young Master Cheng treated everyone to a drink tonight and opened a bottle of wine worth over 300,000 yuan. He is sound asleep now. Can I trouble you to come over and settle the bill for him?\u201d\n After a moment of silence, Cheng Yanmo acknowledged.\n Half an hour later, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s car stopped at the bar street. He alighted and walked into the bar. As he weaved through the crowd of hormonal drunkards, he exuded a cold, arrogant aura.\n ]Cheng Yanmo entered a private room, and saw Cheng Ziang collapsed on the sofa in a drunken stupor.\n Cheng Ziang\u2019s white suit was in disarray and he had a woman\u2019s lipstick mark on his face. The table was filled with expensive glass bottles and one or two used latex condoms.\n Cheng Yanmo stared at the dirty things on the table. He adjusted his glasses, turned back calmly, and handed a bank card to the bar owner behind him. \u201cI came to settle the bill. I\u2019ll take him away.\u201d\n The boss sized up the legendary \u2018Town\u2019s Most Handsome Man\u2019 Cheng Yanmo with curiosity and awe. Compared to this Casanova Cheng Ziang, Cheng Yanmo was like a dragon among men. One look at him and one could tell he was extraordinary.\n ]The boss took the bank card and was about to turn to leave, when he suddenly turned back to say to Cheng Yanmo, \u201cMaster Cheng, please tell your brother that this is a legal bar.\u201d He glanced at the condoms on the table and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do such things at my place in the future. It\u2019s too small for him.\u201d\n \u201cThere are so many hotels on the streets. Any one of them would be more luxurious and convenient than my private room.\u201d\n Of course Cheng Yanmo understood the boss\u2019s sarcasm. Instead of being angry, he apologized in a well-mannered manner. \u201cBoss, sorry to trouble you.\u201d With that, he bent down, helped Cheng Ziang up, and carried him out of the bar.\n Walking to the end of the street and standing beside a small fountain, Cheng Yanmo suddenly let go of Cheng Ziang. Suddenly losing his grip, Cheng Ziang\u2019s body swayed slightly. Without warning, Cheng Yanmo kicked the drunk Cheng Ziang into the fountain.\n \u201cAh!\u201d Lying in the water with his mouth and nose blocked by water, Cheng Ziang was instantly wide awake.\n He struggled a few times and realized that the water was not deep. Cheng Ziang scrambled to his knees. He coughed a few times, wiped the water off his face, looked up, and saw Cheng Yanmo standing in front of him.\n Cheng Ziang looked into Cheng Yanmo\u2019s emotionless eyes, which were filled with disgust and disdain. Cheng Ziang instantly snapped out of his trance. \u201cBig... big brother...\u201d Cheng Ziang stammered, feeling like a cat that had its tail caught.\n Cheng Yanmo turned and left.\n Cheng Ziang hurriedly stood up from the pool and jogged after him, leaving watermarks behind every step. \u201cBig brother, weren\u2019t you on a work trip? Why are you back so soon?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo ignored him. He opened the door, got in, started the car, and was about to leave. Cheng Ziang quickly got into the passenger seat and sat down. As soon as he closed the door, the car started moving.\n Cheng Ziang hurriedly fastened his seatbelt and asked Cheng Yanmo sheepishly, \u201cBrother, you were the one who brought me back from the bar?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo finally spoke. \u201cCan\u2019t you control yourself?\u201d Cheng Yanmo frowned and said in disdain, \u201cIf you want to do it, can\u2019t you find a hotel?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang knew that Cheng Yanmo was angry.\n Although they were born from the same parents, Cheng Ziang and Cheng Yanmo were on two extreme ends. The elder brother was outstanding and dazzling, while the younger brother was frivolous and led a carefree life.\n Faced with this over-achieving big brother, Cheng Ziang felt guilty and inferior. Hearing Cheng Yanmo\u2019s teachings, Cheng Ziang couldn\u2019t help feeling somewhat indignant. He said listlessly, \u201cI don\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo chuckled. \u201cHa!\u201d\n Cheng Ziang added. \u201cSong Ci is married.\u201d Previously, he had wooed Song Ci in such a high-profile manner, but she had never wavered. In the blink of an eye, Song Ci got married just like that, dealing a huge blow to Cheng Ziang\u2019s confidence.\n Thinking that Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t know about Song Ci\u2019s marriage, he hurriedly complained to Cheng Yanmo. \u201cSong Ci is married to a nobody and a handicapped person! I\u2019ve already investigated. That man called Han Zhan doesn\u2019t have a father or mother. He has no power or influence. He only has a lousy 200-square-meter house and a rotten car. He even bought the house with a loan.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand how Song Ci fell for him!\u201d The more he spoke, the angrier Cheng Ziang got.\n Cheng Ziang had been a laughing stock these few days, and everyone was laughing at him. \u201cSecond Young Master Cheng, Song Ci would rather marry a handicapped person than you. Your Second Young Master\u2019s charm is just so-so!\u201d Cheng Ziang had the urge to kill Song Ci\u2019s man, after hearing so many things.\n Cheng Yanmo couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He interrupted Cheng Ziang\u2019s incessant chatter. \u201cApart from not being surnamed Cheng, is he any worse than you?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang was stunned.\n As he was good at reincarnation and his surname was Cheng, Cheng Ziang was never short of money. He had many houses, cars, friends and banknotes, but Song Ci didn\u2019t choose him. Instead, his brother said that apart from not knowing how to reincarnate, that man was no worse than him.\n Being belittled by his elder brother to such an extent, Cheng Ziang felt very embarrassed and his face darkened. He said grimly, \u201cBrother, have you seen that man before? How do you know that he\u2019s better than me?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen him before.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "85": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-86\n\n Chapter 85: Is it Okay if I Buy You a Bag?  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Not expecting them to really know each other, Cheng Ziang was slightly shocked. He hurriedly asked Cheng Yanmo, \u201cHow is that person?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had only met Han Zhan twice. The first time was by chance, and the other time was at an official business meeting. That man called Han Zhan had attended the meeting with Li Li. Although he was Li Li\u2019s subordinate, Li Li didn\u2019t treat him like an ordinary subordinate.\n Cheng Yanmo also couldn\u2019t guess Han Zhan\u2019s true identity, but his intuition told him that this man called Han Zhan was not as mediocre as others thought.\n Although Cheng Yanmo wasn\u2019t familiar with Song Ci, they had met several times. Though Song Ci didn\u2019t cling to the rich and powerful, she had a proud and arrogant personality. How could a man she liked be a nobody?\n Cheng Yanmo could tell that Cheng Ziang was not convinced. He frowned and warned Cheng Ziang. \u201cIdiot, don\u2019t provoke Han Zhan. Be careful not to get yourself in trouble.\u201d\n \u201cHa...\u201d Cheng Ziang pretended not to hear him.\n Meanwhile, Song Ci went back to her room to dry her hair, after ending Mu Qiu\u2019s call.\n She sat by the bed and just couldn\u2019t fall asleep. As if they had telepathy, her WeChat suddenly lit up. Someone had sent a message. Song Ci opened it and saw that it was Han Zhan. He had sent her a video.\n Song Ci opened the video.\n Holding his cell phone, Han Zhan pointed the camera at the dazzling luxury goods stores in the extravagant departmental store. His deep, melodious voice rang out. \u201cBaby Ci, do you have anything you want? Make a list with me. I\u2019ll buy it for you.\u201d\n This was the first time Han Zhan took the time to shop during a work trip. After all, he already had a family and shouldn\u2019t return home empty-handed. Han Zhan didn\u2019t expect Song Ci to reply either. After all, 8 pm at his location was 3 am at Wangdong City.\n Li Li said that all girls liked bags, especially beautiful girls like Song Ci who pursued fashion. Han Zhan planned to pick a few nice-looking bags for her. He didn\u2019t know what kind of bags Song Ci liked, but it was definitely the right choice to buy the best-selling ones in the store.\n Little did he know that Song Ci was still awake.\n Song Ci directly gave Han Zhan a video call. Han Zhan had just entered a store, when he heard the video call request.\n He found it strange. Isn\u2019t Song Ci asleep?\n Han Zhan accepted the video.\n Song Ci leaned against the head of the bed. The lights were on in the room and she looked very drowsy. She called out softly, \u201cBrother Han.\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned as he looked at Song Ci\u2019s expression on the phone. \u201cDid you not sleep or did you wake up?\u201d He decided that after he returned, he would let Song Ci memorize and copy the Han Family residence rules a hundred times so that she could get used to sleeping and waking up early.\n Song Ci answered, \u201cYes, but I dreamed of you again. I woke up feeling empty, lonely, and hot. I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d\n Han Zhan instinctively said, \u201cWhy is it empty, lonely and hot? Shouldn\u2019t it be empty, lonely, and cold?\u201d He thought Song Ci had said something wrong.\n Song Ci shot him a coquettish look and said, \u201cI miss you so I feel hot, understand?\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n He instinctively looked left and right. After confirming that there were no Chinese around and that no one could understand him, the old man\u2019s agitated heart calmed down. \u201cDon\u2019t seduce me.\u201d This is too cruel.\n Song Ci sighed. Her face fell as she said listlessly, \u201cI had a nightmare.\u201d\n Han Zhan picked up a bag, and was about to show it to Song Ci when he heard this. He put down the bag and walked out of the store. He found a less crowded spot and stood there. Han Zhan studied Song Ci\u2019s face carefully and realized that she looked slightly pale.\n \u201cWhat did you dream of?\u201d Han Zhan sounded very concerned.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart warmed. She chuckled. \u201cI dreamt of what I kept thinking about in the day. It\u2019s just a small fuss over nothing.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened? Tell me.\u201d\n After a moment of silence, Song Ci told Han Zhan about her nightmare. \u201cMu Qiu came to look for me tonight and told me some truthful words. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t anything heartwarming.\u201d She gave a self-deprecating smile and said, \u201cShe got drunk tonight and slept on our sofa.\u201d\n \u201cIn the middle of the night, I had a dream. I dreamed that Mu Qiu had drugged my drink. I woke up in pain at night and actually saw Mu Qiu digging at my heart. I only realized that I was dreaming when I woke up.\u201d Song Ci recalled that dream and still felt a lingering fear.\n \u201cWhen I got up and went downstairs to look for Mu Qiu, I realized that Mu Qiu had left without even saying goodbye. I\u2019m really acting like once bitten twice shy, am I very useless?\u201d Song Ci was embarrassed to let Han Zhan know that she was so timid, just staying in the same house as Mu Qiu scared her to death.\n After hearing her story, Han Zhan didn\u2019t tease her. He said in a cajoling tone, \u201cBaby Ci, I\u2019ll buy you a bag. Can you sleep early?\u201d\n Song Ci raised her brows. \u201cBag?\u201d\n Actually, as a socialite, she would never mind having too many bags. But thinking of Old Master Han and Han Zhan\u2019s lifestyle, Song Ci hesitated again.\n Old Master Han was obviously a meritorious hero, but after retirement, he went home to farm and never asked about official matters again. Han Zhan was obviously wealthy, but he stayed in a duplex and drove a Volvo to help those who really needed help.\n A truly wealthy person was never rich in terms of money. Instead, they were rich in terms of spirit. Song Ci thought of how she had chased after luxury brands in the past and felt ashamed.\n She wanted to be like Old Master Han, someone with a heart of gold and silver.\n \u201cForget it, I don\u2019t lack bags.\u201d After thinking for a moment, Song Ci said, \u201cBrother Han, can you bring me a beautiful stone? In the future, whenever you go on a work trip to a new place, bring me back a beautiful stone.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt that this present was too shabby and it belittled Song Ci. He said, \u201cChange it.\u201d\n However, Song Ci said, \u201cThe gift might be small, but it\u2019s the meaning behind it that matters. How about this, you carve the word \u2018Baby Ci\u2019 on every stone. I can keep it forever.\u201d Every stone could be kept until the end of time.\n Song Ci hoped that Baby Ci could also act impudently in Han Zhan\u2019s heart for the rest of her life. This had nothing to do with love, but possessiveness instead. Song Ci was trying to defend herself.\n Han Zhan saw that Song Ci didn\u2019t seem to be joking and agreed.\n After chatting with Han Zhan for a while more, Song Ci completely relaxed. She hung up the video call, laid down on the bed, thought for a moment, rolled over to the side where Han Zhan usually laid down, and fell asleep not long after.\n Han Zhan returned to the hotel alone.\n After showering, he sat by the bed in his pajamas and opened his laptop to play a video. If Song Ci was here, she would definitely realize that this video was monitoring Han Zhan\u2019s master bedroom!\n The video that Han Zhan was watching was a surveillance footage from 11pm to 3am that night. In the footage, Song Ci was sound asleep under the thin blanket. Han Zhan dragged the progress bar until 2.40am, when he suddenly sat up straight.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "86": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-87\n\n Chapter 86: Brother Han Sitting in Economy Class  Han Zhan stared at the computer and saw a skinny woman gently push open the door and enter the room. It was Mu Qiu, the heiress of the Mu Family. Mu Qiu stepped barefoot on the wooden floor, and silently walked to the bed of the master bedroom. She stared at Song Ci for a while, her expression conflicted and hesitant.\n Suddenly, Mu Qiu drew out a small silver knife from her waist! Her hands were trembling badly, but she still raised the knife with both hands and stabbed the tip of the knife towards Song Ci\u2019s chest!\n Just as the tip of the knife was pressing against Song Ci\u2019s chest, Mu Qiu suddenly snapped out of her trance, like she had just woken up from a dream. She nimbly retrieved the dagger, grabbed it, turned around, and ran out of the room. Less than two minutes after she left, the sound asleep Song Ci suddenly twisted her body, clearly having a dream.\n After a while, Song Ci broke out of her dreamscape and sat up on the bed. She pressed her chest and touched her hair. She then sat down on the bed and panted heavily.\n After watching this video, Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were dark and stormy.\n This Mu Qiu...\n In the morning, Song Ci got out of bed and walked towards the cloakroom while taking off her pyjamas. She tossed her pyjamas into the laundry basket, and retrieved a loose white blouse and a pale pink skirt.\n ]She stood in front of the mirror to put on her clothes. As she was buttoning up her shirt, she caught a glimpse of the mark on her chest and her gaze froze.\n Song Ci thought she had seen wrongly. She approached the mirror, leaned close to ut, and carefully observed her own chest. She didn\u2019t see wrongly\u2014there was indeed a small wound there, as if something sharp had cut through her skin and caused blood to ooze out.\n What is this?\n Song Ci frowned bitterly. When she realized when the bloodstain was left, a chill ran down her spine.\n Mu Qiu did it!\n That dream last night might not have been a dream at all. It might have been a warning from her body in danger!\n Although she didn\u2019t know why Mu Qiu had let her off at the last minute last night, from the moment Mu Qiu had the thought of killing Song Ci, there was only one ending between Song Ci and Mu Qiu \u2014\n Either you die, or I die!\n Song Ci had two things to do now. First, she had to pay back the money Mu Mian used to bring her up and draw a clear line with the Mu Family. Second, she had to let Mu Mian and Mu Qiu to atone for their sins in her previous lifetime!\n As for how to take down Mu Mian...\n In her previous life, Song Ci had worked in Mu Mian\u2019s company for a period of time, and knew some secrets that others didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t as if Chao Yang Company had never been indebted to anyone in its development...\n Song Ci got dressed and walked into the master bedroom. Standing by the French window, she called Long Yu.\n \u201cBrother Long, can you help me check on someone?\u201d\n Long Yu was practicing boxing at home, when he received a call from Song Ci. He paused and replied, \u201cMadam, who do you want me to help you check?\u201d\n Song Ci gazed out the window at the busy traffic downstairs. She said a name softly. \u201cSu Buwang.\u201d\n Long Yu said, \u201cThere are too many people in our country with the same name and surname. Does Madam know any more details? The more, the better.\u201d\n After thinking for a moment, Song Ci said, \u201cSu Buwang, if he is still alive, he should be between 46 to 48 years old. He graduated in 95 from Wangdong University, majoring in computer science. I am not sure about the rest.\u201d\n Long Yu said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\n Sorry to trouble you, Brother Long. Let me know as soon as you find out anything about this person.\u201d After hanging up the phone, Song Ci\u2019s body started to tremble uncontrollably. She had never been a ruthless person. Only when she really wanted to take revenge on Mu Mian and his daughter did Song Ci realize that she was actually so excited and scared that she was shivering all over.\n Taking a deep breath, Song Ci turned to pour herself a glass of warm water. Only after drinking it did her shivering body calm down slightly.\n ...\n Han Zhan\u2019s flight arrived at the airport at 1pm. He dragged his luggage and followed the other passengers out of the passageway. Just like every other time, he headed straight for the exit.\n Sitting in the car sent by Li Li to fetch him, Han Zhan was about to instruct the driver to drive when his cell phone suddenly rang. When Han Zhan took out the phone and saw that it was Song Ci, his lips subconsciously curved up.\n \u201cBaby Ci.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s shout caused the driver to steal a peek behind.\n Han Zhan noticed the driver\u2019s gaze and glanced up at him. The driver hurriedly turned back, his eyes wide open.\n It was very noisy on Song Ci\u2019s end. Han Zhan heard Song Ci ask, \u201cBrother Han, why haven\u2019t you come out yet? I saw that they all came out, but I don\u2019t see you.\u201d Song Ci knew that Han Zhan was sitting in Zeus Airlines\u2019 passenger plane today. She stood at the exit of the VIP lane and waited for the last person to come out, but Han Zhan didn\u2019t come.\n Hearing this, Han Zhan was truly stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re at the airport?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYes, I came to fetch you. Where are you?\u201d\n Han Zhan supported his forehead with his hand and laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve already come out. Are you at the VIP exit? I\u2019m sitting in the economy class and missed you when I came out. Come to the main entrance, I\u2019ll come and fetch you.\u201d\n Song Ci was dumbstruck.\n Brother Han is indeed Brother Han. He actually sat in economy class!\n She hurriedly ran towards the exit and indeed saw Han Zhan there. Han Zhan was holding a black umbrella and wearing an azure shirt. The pattering raindrops fell around his body, making him look like a beautiful painting.\n Standing in the rain, other than the falling raindrops in his ash-blue eyes, they were filled with Song Ci\u2019s face.\n Song Ci ran over with big strides and hugged Han Zhan\u2019s waist. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much, Brother Han!\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled.\n His wife was so passionate and unrestrained that Han Zhan felt embarrassed, even if he didn\u2019t respond. \u201cMmm, I miss you too.\u201d\n Song Ci ducked under Han Zhan\u2019s arm and bent over. The two of them got into the car. During the entire process, the umbrella covered Song Ci. Other than her high heels and ankles getting wet, her clothes were still clean, but Han Zhan\u2019s right shoulder and pants were all drenched.\n Seeing that Mr. and Mrs. Han had both boarded the car and were hugging each other lovingly, the driver very conscientiously brought up the dividers. He heard Mrs. Han say to Mr. Han with a smile, \u201cBrother Han, this driver of yours is really something.\u201d\n The driver was speechless. He was glad that he had raised the divider and left a good impression on Mrs. Han.\n Han Zhan knew that Song Ci was just being frivolous. In reality, when it came to actual combat, she was timid and weak and would easily cry from being bullied. \u201cDon\u2019t bully him. It\u2019s not easy for a driver to work for money either.\u201d He guessed that the driver must be very tormented.\n Song Ci chuckled, feeling that Brother Han was indeed kind. \u201cCan you get the driver to stop the car by the road?\u201d\n Although he didn\u2019t know what Song Ci wanted to do, Han Zhan still told the driver to find a shelter from the rain and park the car. Song Ci alighted, her high heels stepping in the rain as she went around to the trunk of the car. She opened the luggage and found a set of clean clothes for Han Zhan.\n Carrying her clothes back to the car, Song Ci asked Han Zhan to take them off. \u201cChange into dry clothes. Don\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d\n Actually, Han Zhan was not so weak. When he was in the military, he had lurked in the swamp and baked in the desert. His physical fitness had always been very good. However, Han Zhan really enjoyed Song Ci\u2019s concern.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "87": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-88\n\n Chapter 87: Please be a Beast  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Han Zhan was too tall. Being nearly 1.9m tall, he felt very uncomfortable when he bent over to change clothes.\n The car was very cramped and Han Zhan\u2019s hands and feet would always touch Song Ci when he was moving. The two of them had been separated for a week and seeing each other again felt like a newlyweds\u2019 honeymoon. When Han Zhan\u2019s elbow touched Song Ci, both of them were silent.\n After changing clothes, Han Zhan tilted his head and saw Song Ci\u2019s gaze drifting down. He didn\u2019t know what she was looking at...\n \u201cCan you not look at me like that?\u201d Being stared at by Song Ci in that manner made Han Zhan feel like a beast.\n Song Ci also knew that she was intentionally provoking him. She rubbed her nose, and turned to look out of the window, counting the raindrops on the glass.\n After a long while, the car finally came to a stop. The drowsy Song Ci heard Han Zhan talking to the driver. She opened her eyes and looked out of the window, only to realize that the car had already stopped at the basement.\n Song Ci alighted and walked up to Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan thanked the driver and each hand pulled a luggage bag, as he entered the lift with Song Ci. After entering the lift, Song Ci was about to act coquettishly to Han Zhan, when someone entered.\n It was a young boy who looked like he was in high school. He was wearing a yellow polo shirt and carrying a basketball. He must have recognized Song Ci, and couldn\u2019t resist glancing at her after entering the lift.\n Song Ci was a very sensible person, and knew that the young man was looking at her. She suddenly hugged Han Zhan\u2019s arm, coughed lightly, and said to the young man, \u201cLittle Brother, don\u2019t miss me. There\u2019s no use.\u201d\n That young man\u2019s face turned red. Upon reaching the ninth floor, he hurriedly ducked out like a coward. Once he left, Han Zhan smiled. \u201cYou even bully little kids.\u201d\n \u201cHow is he little?\u201d Song Ci argued. \u201cHe is at most four to five years younger than me.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIf he\u2019s four to five years younger than you, isn\u2019t he just a little kid?\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly laughed.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t understand what she was laughing at. \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d\n Song Ci stared at Han Zhan\u2019s deep-set eyes and sneered. \u201cI am 10 years younger than you, but am I not also a little kid? Let me interview you, Mr. Han. Don\u2019t you feel guilty doing adult things with little kids? Don\u2019t you feel like you are worse than a beast?\u201d\n With the two accusations of having a bad reputation and being worse than a beast, Han Zhan was suddenly stumped and lost his ability to argue.\n Song Ci felt much better seeing Han Zhan awkward.\n [fuzzy]When they got out of the lift, Song Ci took the initiative to help Han Zhan with the luggage. The two of them dragged their luggage home. Han Zhan opened the door, and was about to move his luggage into the entryway when Song Ci hugged him from behind.\n Her long arms rested on Han Zhan\u2019s bluish-grey shirt. The contrast was stark. Song Ci rubbed her head against his back non-stop. \u201cBrother Han...\u201d She only called him Brother Han, but her hint was clear.\n Han Zhan very calmly pulled her hands away. He turned around, looked down at Song Ci\u2019s overly exquisite face, and said sternly, \u201cLittle kid, after hearing your condemnation, I just want to be a person now.\u201d\n Song Ci was momentarily dazed.\n When Song Ci understood that Han Zhan was talking about what happened in the lift, she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n This man is so petty.\n \u201cThen, I beg you to be a beast.\u201d Song Ci was shameless and took the initiative to apologize. Han Zhan tried to hold it in but couldn\u2019t. He leaned his forehead against Song Ci\u2019s and murmured softly to her, \u201cBaby Ci, why are you so unafraid of death?\u201d\n She is truly young and unrestrained.\n Song Ci was very arrogant. \u201cHow will I know if I don\u2019t try?\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows.\n Alright, let\u2019s give it a try.\n Outside the window, there was thunder and the sound of rain. The sky was dark and the room was dark and dangerous without the lights on. However, there was a frightening charm to it that could attract people to their deaths.\n The lightning had left several horrifying scratches on the edges of the city outside the French window, like tangled roots. The frightening light landed on the French window. Song Ci instinctively turned to look at that light, but Han Zhan covered her eyes with his hand.\n Rumble...\n The thunder was deafening.\n Amidst the deafening thunder, Song Ci heard Han Zhan\u2019s satisfied grunt.\n He had let her die and brought her back to life.\n ...\n Song Ci laid limply on the bed, her head resting on the pure black pillow. As she had cried, the corners of her eyes were red. Han Zhan was on the phone at the side, his voice calm and cold, completely different from the beast who kept pestering her to call him big brother.\n Song Ci glanced at the items in the dustbin and looked slightly puzzled. It was her ovulation period and the best time to get pregnant. Why did Han Zhan have to avoid pregnancy?\n Is she too ugly to bear the Han Family\u2019s baby?\n Song Ci\u2019s imagination ran wild as the person beside her finally hung up. Seeing that Song Ci was still awake, Han Zhan asked if she was not sleepy.\n Song Ci shook her head.\n \u201cI want to ask you a question.\u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s bass voice was lazy and strangely enticing.\n Song Ci turned over and looked at Han Zhan\u2019s side profile leaning against the head of the bed.\n No matter how I look at him, he is perfect.\n \u201cWhy is your surname Han?\u201d\n Once this question was asked, Song Ci saw that all the warmth on Han Zhan\u2019s face had completely disappeared. Instantly, Song Ci felt that the temperature in the house had dropped. She suddenly realized that Han Zhan was actually a very scary person. If he didn\u2019t intentionally conceal his aura, no one would dare to get close to him.\n Song Ci carefully poked Han Zhan\u2019s collarbone. \u201cBrother Han, don\u2019t scare me. You\u2019re quite scary like this.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s poke seemed to have cleared Han Zhan\u2019s acupoints, and he finally regained his composure. He shook his head slightly. He didn\u2019t wish to explain this but also didn\u2019t wish to lie to Song Ci. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to tell you. I\u2019ll tell you in the future.\u201d\n Song Ci quickly agreed.\n Since she had made Han Zhan unhappy just now, Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to say another word. She was still scared and couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\n She was shocked by Han Zhan\u2019s behavior just now.\n Realizing Song Ci\u2019s uneasiness, Han Zhan suddenly hugged her. \u201cDon\u2019t think too much, sleep.\u201d\n Song Ci closed her eyes and pretended to be asleep.\n As she pretended to be asleep, she really fell into a deep sleep, and even the thunder could not wake her up.\n ...\n When she woke up, it was already dark. Song Ci opened her eyes and turned on the lights. She put on her sleeping robe and went downstairs. She saw that the lights were on in the meeting room on the second floor, and she could hear the voices of strangers. Occasionally, Han Zhan would also say something in agreement.\n Song Ci decided to make dinner first.\n She opened the fridge and felt slightly awkward. When Han Zhan was not at home, the fridge was emptied by her. Song Ci found a sweet potato, some noodles, and three eggs.\n After Han Zhan finished his video conference and came downstairs, he saw dinner on the table and instantly frowned with a gloomy expression.\n Two roasted sweet potatoes, a bowl of egg noodles and two fried eggs. This was dinner...\n Song Ci acted like she was presenting a treasure. She pushed the bowl of egg noodles and a purple potato in front of Han Zhan, and said to him with a smile, \u201cBrother Han, you can have all the good stuff.\u201d She only kept two eggs for herself.\n Han Zhan walked over quietly and sat down. He glanced at the items on the table and said, \u201cGive them all to me. This is not enough.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "88": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-89\n\n Chapter 88: She was His Home  Song Ci was stunned.\n Give all to him?\n Then what do I eat?\n Song Ci still pushed all the food to Han Zhan. Seeing that Han Zhan really picked up his chopsticks and started eating heartily without any intention of giving her any, Song Ci felt slightly aggrieved, upset, and even felt like crying.\n She didn\u2019t know why she felt so aggrieved.\n She sat down on her stool and lowered her head. \u201cActually, I haven\u2019t eaten either. Can you give me some?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s reaction was very cold when he heard her. \u201cNo way, I can\u2019t even eat my fill.\u201d\n Song Ci looked up with reddened eyes. \u201cHan Zhan, previously in bed, you said I was your darling and you made me cry. So what if I want to have a piece of your sweet potato? Are you even human?\u201d\n Song Ci really cried as she watched Han Zhan reach for the remaining half of the sweet potato.\n She felt like she had been bullied. She had no parents, her elder sister was in a coma, her adoptive parents wanted her heart all the time, she even found a man who snatched her food! Song Ci felt that her life was truly miserable, even more miserable than the female lead in television dramas.\n In the end, Han Zhan still tossed the half-eaten sweet potato to Song Ci. Gritting her teeth, Song Ci wiped her tears and roared at Han Zhan. \u201cI don\u2019t want it\u201d\n Han Zhan knew that she was angry. Instead of comforting her, his face darkened.\n Seeing this, Song Ci was so angry that she laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve already eaten everything, so why can\u2019t I criticize you? You still dare to pull a black face at me?\u201d At this point, Song Ci only wanted to get a divorce.\n ]Han Zhan suddenly spoke up and said in a low voice, \u201cWhen I left, the ingredients in the fridge were only enough for you to eat for four days. In these seven days, you only ate three days worth of ingredients. Song Ci, is this how you take care of yourself?\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n She didn\u2019t expect Han Zhan to be angry at this.\n These few days, Song Ci frequently locked herself in her room to compose music. She was so focused on her work that she easily forgot the time, and only cooked something to eat when she was extremely hungry. As a result, she ate three days\u2019 worth of food in seven days.\n Yesterday, before she went to bed, she was still thinking of going to the supermarket to shop this morning. In the end, she woke up slightly late this morning, so she went straight to the airport to fetch Han Zhan. On the way back, it was pouring heavily and she forgot to shop for groceries.\n Realizing that Han Zhan was angry at her for not taking good care of herself, Song Ci lowered her head in silence. Her guilty look was pitiful.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart hardened as he watched Song Ci admit her mistake. He said, \u201cWhen I opened the fridge to prepare dinner and saw that it was empty, I guessed that you must not have eaten well these few days. I was really angry then.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, you are 22 years old, not 2 years old. You are already an adult, not a baby, you don\u2019t have to...\u201d He wanted to say that she shouldn\u2019t be so useless, but felt that he was being too harsh and couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it.\n Song Ci rubbed her eyes, snatched the half-eaten sweet potato, and chewed on it. She said, \u201cI have been composing a tune these few days and forgot to go to the supermarket to buy some food. But I promise I will never make such a mistake again.\u201d\n \u201cDo I want your promise?\u201d Han Zhan felt slightly helpless. He stared at Song Ci\u2019s obviously thinner body and sighed. \u201cI want a healthy Song Ci.\u201d\n \u201cYou will get sick after you starve yourself for one meal and eat too full for another.\u201d Han Zhan took a deep look at Song Ci and said, \u201cSong Ci, you are no longer alone. You are my wife and will be the mother of a child in the future. If you can\u2019t even take care of your own life, how are you going to take care of our child in the future?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s tone turned domineering. \u201cIf you really want to spend the rest of your life with me, please take good care of yourself. Only by being healthy can we grow old together.\u201d\n Song Ci heard his words and was silent, feeling extremely touched.\n Just then, the doorbell rang.\n Song Ci rubbed her eyes and was about to open the door, when Han Zhan said, \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a nightdress. I\u2019ll go.\u201d Song Ci looked down at her own nightdress. It was indeed very short and not suitable for anyone to see.\n After a while, Han Zhan came in carrying takeout. Song Ci\u2019s expression was especially complicated when she saw the takeout. \u201cBrother Han, you ordered takeout?\u201d\n Han Zhan placed the food in front of her and asked, \u201cOtherwise, who\u2019s going to compensate me if my wife starved herself to death?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled through her tears again. \u201cBrother Han, you are the best.\u201d Although he was slightly old, he was handsome and kind-hearted.\n Song Ci was really hungry. She opened the takeaway and started eating.\n Han Zhan looked at her eating and said, \u201cLet\u2019s find a reliable helper to cook for us.\u201d Glancing at Song Ci\u2019s thin arm, Han Zhan said in disdain, \u201cYou\u2019re too skinny. I don\u2019t even dare to pinch you.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n \u201cDon\u2019t pinch me.\u201d She thought for a moment and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not look for her first. Actually, I don\u2019t like strangers at home. When I\u2019m really pregnant and have a baby in the future, we will look for someone who knows how to properly take care of the baby.\u201d\n Han Zhan thought about it seriously and agreed.\n Song Ci gave the food that she couldn\u2019t finish to Han Zhan. After the meal, knowing that Han Zhan had no more work to do, Song Ci took out the two tunes that she had written these few days and showed them to Han Zhan.\n She narrated her inspiration when composing music scores, and wanted Han Zhan to praise her for being a genius. However, Han Zhan was disinterested. This was not because Song Ci\u2019s works were bad, but because Han Zhan totally didn\u2019t know anything about music. Han Zhan couldn\u2019t understand the two music scores in Song Ci\u2019s hands at all and naturally couldn\u2019t be interested.\n As she spoke, she noticed that Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were fixed on a certain area, clearly wavering. Song Ci knew that Han Zhan was distracted and probed. \u201cBrother Han, do you not understand the score?\u201d\n It was rare for Han Zhan to feel awkward. He nodded honestly. \u201cI didn\u2019t learn it before.\u201d Not only did Han Zhan not learn music, he didn\u2019t even know many songs. In the past, when he was in the military, he did learn a few. For example, \u201cThe Song of the Volunteer Army\u201d, \u201cThe Green Flower of the Army\u201d, \u201cMy Old Monitor\u201d...\n In popular music, the only song that Han Zhan could sing in its entirety was Li Yuchun\u2019s \u201cSame As You.\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan say this, Song Ci felt that it was rather rare. However, thinking of how Old Master Han had led a military life and was a tough man, it was understandable that Han Zhan, who was raised by him, didn\u2019t understand music.\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan curiously, \u201cWhat did you learn outside of class when you were young?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cCalligraphy, Go chess, Shooting.\u201d\n Song Ci gave Han Zhan a big thumbs-up. \u201cAs expected of a man who has been using guns since young. Brother Han is awesome.\u201d\n Han Zhan was amused by her exaggerated praise.\n Song Ci added. \u201cShall I hum it for you then?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Sitting by the French window, Song Ci closed her eyes and hummed her own tune softly. Behind her were skyscrapers and myriad lights. Han Zhan stared at Song Ci, taking in her appearance and the light shining behind her.\n Because of her, there was finally a light in this city that stayed for him.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

After Song Ci finished humming, she opened her eyes and was shocked by the five fingers in front of her.\n \u201cBrother Han, what are you doing?\u201d Song Ci stared at Han Zhan\u2019s slender, muscular left hand. She pushed his hand away and asked him in confusion, \u201cAre you trying to touch me secretly?\u201d\n Han Zhan instinctively retracted his left hand. He shook his head mildly and said, \u201cYour face is so small. I think it\u2019s only the size of my palm.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if my face is small, as long as my other parts are not small.\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned.\n He was despicable and couldn\u2019t control his fluttering eyes.\n Song Ci said considerately, \u201c34C.\u201d She snorted delightfully and said proudly, \u201cMy IQ is not as good as Song Fei\u2019s, but in terms of figure, it\u2019s definitely better than Song Ci\u2019s cardboard figure.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t know much about Song Ci\u2019s elder sister, Song Fei. From Song Ci\u2019s tone, it seemed like Song Fei was very smart. Han Zhan asked, \u201cIs your elder sister very smart?\u201d He felt that Song Ci was already a very smart and adorable girl, so he couldn\u2019t imagine what kind of wonderful person Song Fei was.\n In private, Song Ci and Song Fei were like frenemies and slandered each other. But deep down, Song Ci was very proud of Song Fei. Hearing Han Zhan ask about her elder sister, Song Ci said proudly, \u201cMy elder sister is a genius with an IQ of 182. She has been a smart kid to the teachers since she was young. Do you know Fu Hanshen?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIs it someone who can be found on Baidu?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n In front of Song Ci, Han Zhan checked on Fu Hanshen.\n Fu Hanshen, born in 1966. The director of the Military Medical Academy, a non-virus specialist.\n He was a big boss in the field of virology.\n Han Zhan logged out of the webpage and remained silent for a moment, before asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s his relationship with your elder sister?\u201d\n \u201cFu Hanshen is my elder sister\u2019s teacher. My elder sister has been learning from Teacher Fu since she was very young.\u201d Song Ci was both proud and ashamed. \u201cI\u2019m not that good.\u201d She spread out her hands and said despondently, \u201cApart from my beauty, I have no other good points.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes twinkled as he smiled at Song Ci. \u201cNo, you also have other strengths.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up, and she asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThick-skinned and narcissistic.\u201d\n Song Ci was so angry that she directly threw the score at Han Zhan\u2019s face. Han Zhan grabbed the score with one hand. Seeing that Song Ci was angry, he changed the topic. \u201cGrandpa got someone to check our birth characters and fixed our wedding date on 26 October.\u201d\n \u201c26th October?\u201d Song Ci heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cI am just worried that I\u2019ll have to wear a neck brace at the wedding, if our wedding date is too near. 26 is fine.\u201d\n \u201cWhere do you want to hold the wedding? Is there anywhere you like?\u201d There was only one wedding in one\u2019s lifetime, and Han Zhan wanted to respect Song Ci\u2019s wishes.\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cWhere?\u201d\n Song Ci said a place that Han Zhan had never heard of. \u201cCai Family Village.\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned. \u201cWhere is that?\u201d\n Song Ci moved over to Han Zhan\u2019s side and sat down. She turned on her cell phone, found a photo, and showed it to Han Zhan. Han Zhan took the photo and saw a huge, ancient maple tree. That maple tree grew by the side of a green lake. Its branches hung down, and its leaves were lush.\n In October, when the maple leaves turn red, this place will be beautiful.\n It was a beautiful place suitable for marriage.\n But...\n \u201cYou marrying me has already become the laughing stock of the entire city. Why did you choose such a remote place for your wedding? Aren\u2019t you afraid of being looked down upon?\u201d Han Zhan thought that Song Ci would choose an expensive hotel to hold an extremely lavish wedding.\n She was, after all, the top socialite. Only a lavish and luxurious wedding banquet was worthy of her status.\n Hearing this, Song Ci smiled nonchalantly. \u201cI don\u2019t care what others say about my life.\u201d It\u2019s my decision to choose the person I want to marry and to choose where I want to hold my wedding. Song Ci looked at Han Zhan with a deep meaning, and purposely teased him. \u201cThe important thing is not the wedding itself, but the person who married me.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled.\n She\u2019s beautiful and good with words. How can Song Ci be so adorable?\n Song Ci clicked on that photo and told Han Zhan, \u201cThis lake is called Xiaoqing Lake, in the Cai Family Village from the suburbs. This is where my parents got married.\u201d\n \u201cI see. So you want to hold a wedding at the place where your parents got married.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I still have a photo taken when they got married. Let me show you.\u201d Song Ci retrieved her cell phone and opened Baidu cloud\u2019s photo album. She scrolled down for a few seconds before finally finding that photo.\n \u201cIt\u2019s this one. Look, aren\u2019t my parents very compatible?\u201d Song Ci said proudly, \u201cI\u2019m not boasting, but my parents are so good-looking that even now, they are a force to be reckoned with.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at the photo.\n It was an old photo taken more than 20 years ago. It was very clear, but one could also tell that it was dated.\n In the photo, a man and a woman were standing hand in hand under a maple tree. The man was wearing a black suit and a pair of glasses. His lips were slightly curled up as he looked down at the woman beside him with a loving gaze.\n That woman was wearing a red halter-neck dress with a white pearl accessory at the collar. Her black hair was done up in a mid-length bun, with a simple hairpin.\n She only wore a pair of pearl earrings on her body Even without the dazzling jewelry, the woman was breathtakingly beautiful.\n Song Ci and her mother looked like they were carved out of the same mold, even their aura was very similar. Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s mother\u2019s photo, his thoughts drifting away as his expression gradually calmed down.\n He suddenly said, \u201cShe does look a little like...\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s comment, Song Ci felt slightly proud. \u201cHow is it slightly similar? It\u2019s obviously very similar, alright? How is it? I didn\u2019t lie, right? Is my father very handsome? My mother is also very beautiful, right? My looks are just like my mother\u2019s.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at the woman in the photo again, before returning the phone to Song Ci. \u201cShe is indeed very beautiful.\u201d\n Song Ci put down her cell phone and pinched her nose so hard that it looked like a pig\u2019s nose.\n Upon seeing this, Han Zhan looked slightly confused. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n Song Ci let go of her nose and said, \u201cThey all said that my nose was slightly corrected and didn\u2019t dare to believe that I was not born a natural beauty. Brother Han, let me tell you\u2014if you marry me, your future children and grandchildren will all be two whole levels prettier.\u201d\n She boasted shamelessly. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned big time.\u201d\n \u201cThen I will have to trouble you to help me with the Han Family\u2019s genes.\u201d Han Zhan played along with Song Ci\u2019s act.\n Song Ci blushed slightly.\n ]\u201dOh yes.\u201d Han Zhan said, \u201cI brought you a present. It\u2019s upstairs. I\u2019ll go get it. Wait a moment.\u201d Han Zhan went upstairs for a moment. When he came down, he was holding a cotton bag.\n He walked up to Song Ci and sat down cross-legged. He opened the bag and took out the present inside.\n As Song Ci had expected, Han Zhan brought back a stone. It was a natural blue agate stone that had been polished into a necklace. Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cI got someone to polish it and made it into a necklace. Your name is carved on the back of the stone.\u201d\n Song Ci took the necklace and flipped it over, seeing the words \u201cBaby Ci\u201d on the back of the stone.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

After a moment, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a little ugly.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes dimmed. He looked down and said, \u201cI usually have no problem writing with my left hand, but it\u2019s not as detailed as using a carving knife to carve with my right hand. If my handwriting is slightly ugly, you have to bear with it.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly stunned. \u201cYou carved it yourself?\u201d She instinctively looked at Han Zhan\u2019s hands.\n Han Zhan nodded and said, \u201cI had nothing to do on the plane, so I carved it.\u201d\n Knowing that Han Zhan had carved those two words, Song Ci felt that they were extremely beautiful. She hurriedly put the necklace around her neck, went to the mirror, and sized the necklace up. The more she looked at it, the more satisfied she was. She couldn\u2019t resist taking a photo and posting it on Weibo to publicly torture people who were single.\n Seeing that she liked it, Han Zhan heaved a sigh of relief.\n Seeing that Song Ci was boasting about that small stone to Yan Jiang on her phone, Han Zhan felt somewhat helpless. \u201cAlright, go to bed. Stop being smug.\u201d\n Song Ci was still unable to fall asleep and decided to watch a movie. She got up and headed upstairs. Realizing that Han Zhan didn\u2019t follow her, she turned back and asked him, \u201cBrother Han isn\u2019t going upstairs?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cYou go up first. I want to exercise and will come up to look for you later.\u201d\n \u201cWork out? Don\u2019t you always work out in the morning?\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at the takeaway box in the dustbin and said helplessly \u201cI\u2019ve been eating too much recently. I need to exercise more.\u201d\n Song Ci, who had caused Han Zhan to eat too much, didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of self-awareness. She stood up, patted her thigh, and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go upstairs first. Oh yes, I\u2019m meeting with Liang Bo tomorrow. I have to arrange a time with him.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci went upstairs, swaying her hips. Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s slender arms and legs, then glanced down at his own abdomen and legs. He didn\u2019t dare to imagine what would happen after he gained weight. An old, fat, handicapped man was not worthy of standing beside Song Ci.\n Thinking of this, Han Zhan hurriedly entered the gym.\n By the time Han Zhan finished his workout and returned to his room sweating profusely, Song Ci had already fallen asleep hugging her cell phone. Han Zhan took out her cell phone and placed it on the dresser to charge it, before going to take a shower.\n After a good night\u2019s sleep, Song Ci and Han Zhan left together the next morning.\n Han Zhan went to the office and Song Ci went to see Liang Bo. The two of them sat in the same car. At the entrance of the company, Han Zhan got out of the car and Song Ci alighted as well. Hearing movement behind him, Han Zhan turned and saw that Song Ci had also alighted. He asked, \u201cWhy did you get out of the car? Aren\u2019t you going to look for Liang Bo?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t answer but just hugged Han Zhan. It was rush hour now and there were many people around. Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s hug successfully attracted everyone\u2019s attention.\n Song Ci\u2019s red lips were by Han Zhan\u2019s ear as she said, \u201cHubby, focus on work and ignore the other little vixens.\u201d With that, Song Ci got into the car and let Long Yu drive away.\n Han Zhan stood there silently and waited for Long Yu to drive away, before turning to enter the company building. Along the way, many people gave Han Zhan ambiguous, kind smiles.\n Arriving at the office, Han Zhan saw Li Li standing at the door of his office with a cup of coffee. Li Li whistled at Han Zhan and said frivolously, \u201cMr. Han, you\u2019re quite fortunate to have a beauty by your side when you come to work.\u201d\n Han Zhan stopped in his tracks to size Li Li up.\n The area below Li Li\u2019s eyes was dark. He was obviously busy taking care of his sick mother and didn\u2019t have a good rest. Han Zhan asked him, \u201cHow is Auntie? I see that your eyebags are very heavy. Go back and rest today.\u201d\n Li Li shook his head. \u201cNo, I must attend an important meeting today.\u201d\n Nodding, Han Zhan asked again, \u201cIs Auntie feeling better?\u201d\n \u201cMuch better.\u201d Thinking of something, Li Li suddenly said, \u201cMy mother quite likes your wife. She said that sister-in-law is a kind-hearted person.\u201d\n Glancing at Han Zhan coldly, Li Li said in a strange tone, \u201cMr. Han, you\u2019re so fortunate. After my mother saw Sister-in-law, she has been urging me to find a girlfriend as soon as possible to get married...\u201d As he was being forced to marry for a few days, Li Li felt bitter whenever he saw the culprit, Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan gave an enigmatic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to find a girlfriend, but not necessarily someone as good as Song Ci.\u201d\n Li Li grinned and cursed.\n \u201cWhat are you muttering about?\u201d Han Zhan narrowed his eyes and asked.\n Li Li gritted his teeth and smiled. \u201cI said, I wish you and Sister-in-law a blissful, happy marriage. I hope you two grow old together, and have children soon!\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled amicably. \u201cYou have such a sweet tongue today.\u201d Changing the topic, Han Zhan added, \u201cNo matter how sweet you are, you won\u2019t be able to find a girlfriend!\u201d\n Li Li was enraged. \u201cWho said I don\u2019t have a girlfriend? I also have a girlfriend, alright? My girlfriend is very talented and is also an author.\u201d With that, Li Li\u2019s phone suddenly rang. He looked at the caller ID, stuffed a hand into his pocket, and left.\n Han Zhan laughed and shook his head, thinking that Li Li was just spouting nonsense.\n ...\n Liang Bo and Song Ci arranged to meet at a teahouse.\n It was time to meet my goddess. Liang Bo was dressed very handsomely in a three-piece suit that felt hot and uncomfortable, but Liang Bo still sat there obediently, looking forward to Song Ci\u2019s arrival.\n Song Ci arrived as scheduled.\n Entering the teahouse, Song Ci laughed out loud when she saw the handsome Liang Bo sitting at the table. In her previous life, Song Ci was way too familiar with Liang Bo. She knew that he was someone who would never wear a shirt or pants in private.\n It was really hard on him to be dressed like this today.\n Hearing the laughter, Liang Bo suddenly looked up. His face reddened at the sight of Song Ci.\n [fuzzy]Song Ci was wearing a black denim shirt and a pair of cream-colored high-waisted pants that was compatible with her aura. Liang Bo was too embarrassed to look at Song Ci. He lowered his head slightly and said in a low voice, \u201cMs. Song, you are here.\u201d\n Song Ci acknowledged and sat down opposite Liang Bo. She was feeling slightly warm, as she wound up her short hair and fanned herself with her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot wearing a neck brace.\u201d Song Ci was so annoyed by this neck brace that she just wanted to remove it as soon as possible.\n ]Hearing this, Liang Bo lifted his head and sized Song Ci up boldly. It was the first time he saw someone look so good even with a neck brace. \u201cHave you recovered from your car accident a while ago? When can you remove this thing from your neck?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s car accident caused a tsunami in Wangdong City. At that time, many people speculated whether someone had taken revenge on Song Ci.\n After all, she was too beautiful. A woman\u2019s beauty was an advantage, but it could also be a deadly weapon that harmed them.\n Song Ci replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing major. I can remove the neck brace in another week.\u201d\n In her previous life, when Song Ci got to know Liang Bo, he was already in his thirties. After all the ups and downs in life, he had already become a steady and determined man. At this point, Liang Bo\u2019s body was already beginning to glow, but he also looked slightly immature.\n This Liang Bo is like a newly sprouted bamboo shoot.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "91": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-92\n\n Chapter 91: She is Truly a Good Wife  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Song Ci felt rather unfamiliar with such a tender Liang Bo.\n After asking some questions about Liang Bo\u2019s male band, Liang Bo gradually relaxed and Song Ci also found some familiarity with him.\n After chatting for a while, Song Ci took out a voice recorder and placed it in front of Liang Bo. \u201cThis is a tune that I\u2019ve changed over the past few days. It doesn\u2019t have lyrics yet. Listen to it. Some people say that those who truly understand music and understand each other can tell the content and soul of the other party\u2019s work.\u201d\n Liang Bo opened the voice recorder and heard a pure piano demo. It was very similar to the song he heard previously, but Song Ci had edited it and it sounded even more perfect.\n The first time he heard it, Liang Bo was stunned.\n After hearing it for the second time, Liang Bo\u2019s expression gradually turned solemn.\n After listening for more than 20 minutes, Liang Bo heavily exhaled. He gripped the recorder tightly and said to Song Ci, \u201cThese two songs of yours were specially designed for me.\u201d Song Ci seemed to know him very well, as the two songs that she produced matched Liang Bo\u2019s style perfectly.\n Song Ci said, \u201cOf course. I am counting on them to make you famous.\u201d\n Hearing this, Liang Bo asked curiously, \u201cGoddess, do you... know me?\u201d He felt that Song Ci was very familiar with him, but he didn\u2019t remember seeing her before.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI am your hardcore fan.\u201d\n Liang Bo was stunned. \u201cReally?\u201d I actually have hardcore fans?\n Song Ci said, \u201cMmm, I am your little fan. I even know that there is a mole behind your waist.\u201d\n Liang Bo covered his mouth.\n \u201cHow did you know...\u201d He looked at Song Ci in shock, as if he was looking at a pervert.\n Upon seeing this, Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cIn the past, you posted a short video which accidentally revealed your lower back and was exposed by other fans. Many people know about this.\u201d\n Song Ci knew this not because of his fans, but because Liang Bo once said that the fortune-teller had said that the mole on his waist was a birthmark of blessing. He treated that mole as a treasure and frequently touched it.\n ]Liang Bo somewhat believed Song Ci\u2019s words. If she wasn\u2019t a hardcore fan, she wouldn\u2019t even remember that he had a mole on the back of his waist. \u201cMs. Song, I will accept the song. I will send it to you after I finish writing the lyrics.\u201d\n \u201cAlright.\u201d Song Ci put down her teacup and Liang Bo took the initiative to pour her a cup of tea. Song Ci looked at Liang Bo\u2019s face and suddenly said, \u201cHave you considered changing management companies?\u201d\n His action of pouring tea was paused.\n Liang Bo glanced at Song Ci.\n Song Ci said to him, \u201cThe dissolution of the M.A.I. Group is already set in stone. Liang Bo, if you continue to stay in your old employer\u2019s house, you will be completely forgotten. Why don\u2019t you take the initiative to terminate the contract and find a new entertainment company, while you are still young and have unlimited possibilities in the future?\u201d\n Liang Bo\u2019s gaze deepened. \u201cWhat does Ms. Song have in mind?\u201d\n Song Ci dipped her fingers into the water and wrote two words on the table:\n Yu Hua.\n Liang Bo stared at those two words and said upsettingly, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this company.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not strange, because this is an idle company. But I know that this company has a huge backer. Sign with them and let them see your capabilities. They definitely won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d\n Liang Bo asked, \u201cWhose their backer?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled slightly and said enigmatically, \u201cYou probably don\u2019t know that the person registered for the management company is Bei Zhan. You might not know Bei Zhan, but you must know Zeus Airlines. Bei Zhan is a high-level executive of Zeus Airlines.\u201d\n Liang Bo asked skeptically, \u201cYou\u2019re saying that this management company is the same as Zeus Airlines?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way. Bei Zhan is only working for Zeus Airlines, and Yu Hua Corporation is registered under Bei Zhan\u2019s name. Its true backer is the person behind Bei Zhan. I can\u2019t tell you who that person is, but we are partners now. I won\u2019t go against money or fame no matter what.\u201d\n \u201cDo consider my words carefully.\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t reveal more. She was such a virtuous wife to pull the most talented singer to join her husband\u2019s entertainment company!\n Song Ci\u2019s words to Liang Bo were all true. The registered boss of Yu Hua Company was indeed Bei Zhan, but the boss behind him was actually Han Zhan.\n ]A few years later, Yu Hua would become the emperor of the music empire. It was also one of the businesses under the richest man, Han Zhan. Since Song Ci wanted to earn big money, she had to find a reliable company. No company was more reliable than her husband\u2019s company.\n Song Ci was Han Zhan\u2019s pilot and could no longer sign with the management company. But since Yu Hua had signed his business partner, Liang Bo, Brother Han naturally would not treat Liang Bo badly on her account.\n Moreover, Liang Bo had potential and was worth investing in.\n In the afternoon, Han Zhan got the driver to buy some fruits and vitamins. After work, he planned to visit Mother Li, who was recuperating at home. He had a good relationship with her and since he couldn\u2019t accompany her during her surgery, he had to visit her after his work trip.\n Thinking that Mother Li liked Song Ci, Han Zhan called Song Ci again. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Han Zhan heard a stranger\u2019s voice on Song Ci\u2019s side, as well as the music.\n Song Ci told Han Zhan, \u201cI\u2019m shopping at the mall.\u201d\n \u201cI am going to visit Auntie Li tonight. Do you want to come with me?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Song Ci looked at her watch. It was 3pm. \u201cWhat time are you going?\u201d\n \u201cI will pick you up for dinner at 5.30pm. We will go after that.\u201d\n \u201cI will wait for you at the mall. There is a spicy crayfish restaurant nearby that is super delicious.\u201d Song Ci was drooling at the mention of spicy crayfish.\n Han Zhan chuckled and hung up.\n Song Ci put down the dark purple rose tie and said to the salesperson, \u201cPlease help me wrap this tie up.\u201d\n Han Zhan arrived at the mall at 5.40pm and saw Song Ci sitting on a soft chair in the main hall on the first level. She was wearing a hat, sunglasses, and a neck brace. Her style was slightly odd and could be recognized at a glance.\n Han Zhan walked over and knocked on her head. Song Ci hurriedly looked up and saw Han Zhan. She stuffed the cell phone back into her pocket, stood up, and held Han Zhan\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ve already reserved a table. It\u2019s just nice if we go over now.\u201d\n \u201cYou only bought this much in one afternoon?\u201d Noticing that Song Ci only had a small shopping bag in her other hand, many emotions flashed across Han Zhan\u2019s eyes. \u201cSong Ci, tell me honestly, are you short of money?\u201d\n Not long ago, he had caused Song Ci to cry because of money. At the mention of money again, Han Zhan sounded slightly hesitant and careful. \u201cIf you lack money, tell me. We are husband and wife. It is only right that you spend my money.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n After she understood why Han Zhan had such thoughts, she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cI\u2019m not short of money. I just didn\u2019t see anything that I especially wanted to buy for myself.\u201d As she talked, she handed the shopping bag to Han Zhan. \u201cThis is for you. See if you like it.\u201d\n It was his first time receiving a gift from Song Ci. Even if the box was filled with mud, Han Zhan had to find a container to put it away. How could he not like it?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Seeing the tie, Han Zhan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice. I have a dark brown striped suit and was worried about not having a suitable tie to match it.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci said, \u201cI noticed it the last time I packed your luggage. I specially chose this color because it suits your suit very well.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned to look at Song Ci and sighed. \u201cWhat more can I ask for from such a good wife?\u201d\n Song Ci felt very comfortable. \u201cLet\u2019s go and eat crayfish.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After a spicy crayfish meal, Song Ci\u2019s mouth was numb from the spiciness. Then, the two of them went to the Li Family together. Mother Li had recovered quite well. As they chatted, she couldn\u2019t help giving her single son a vicious glare, upon seeing Han Zhan and his wife behaving so lovingly without stopping.\n \u201cSong Ci is beautiful and kind-hearted. Mr. Han, you are so lucky. Unlike our Li Li, who is already 29 years old and doesn\u2019t even have a girlfriend. A few years ago, I can still see him occasionally taking calls from girls. But these two years, he hasn\u2019t even had a single call. After work, he only knows how to play with his cell phone. What\u2019s the point of playing with his cell phone? Can he even have a girlfriend on his cell phone?\u201d\n Mother Li\u2019s face was full of sorrow. The mention of Li Li\u2019s marriage distressed her. She looked at her big-sized son and asked worriedly, \u201cDo you think he will be single forever...\u201d\n Mother Li couldn\u2019t bear to think about it and her eyes turned red. She looked at Song Ci pleadingly and asked, \u201cSong Ci, do you know any suitable ladies for our Li Li?\u201d\n Song Ci looked embarrassed and didn\u2019t know how to reply.\n Seeing that something was off, Han Zhan hurriedly found an excuse to drag Song Ci away. Li Li also made an excuse to send Han Zhan off and slipped out of the house with the husband and wife.\n After entering the lift, Li Li rubbed his face in frustration before apologizing to Song Ci. \u201cSister-in-law, I apologize on behalf of my mother. She is too concerned about my relationship status.\u201d\n Song Ci naturally understood Mother Li\u2019s intentions. She looked at Li Li\u2019s plight sympathetically and said hesitantly, \u201cI do know many suitable girls. If you are interested, I can introduce you to...\u201d\n \u201cNo thanks.\u201d Li Li hurriedly rejected. \u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of intention for the time being.\u201d Li Li had his own capabilities, and there was no lack of outstanding women around him. It was just that he didn\u2019t want to get married for the time being, so he remained single.\n After sending them off downstairs, Li Li went back upstairs. Just as he was about to enter the lift, his cell phone suddenly lit up. Li Li took it out and saw that it was his online friend, Beibei. His gaze softened.\n Beibei: I sold my novel\u2019s rights today and made a killing. Here\u2019s your bonus!\n Beibei sent him a big red packet. Li Li smiled as he accepted the red packet. He asked [Last time, I said that I wanted to meet you. Have you considered that?]\n This time, the other party didn\u2019t reply.\n Li Li knew that Beibei must have read the message, but he was still feeling conflicted. He stopped, leaned against the wall of the lift lobby, and sent another message: [We live in the same city. Perhaps we have brushed shoulders before but don\u2019t know each other. You really don\u2019t want to know me?]\n Finally, a reply came.\n Beibei: [Ah Li, are you really an adult? I don\u2019t want to have an affair with an underage child.]\n Li Li chuckled. [How many times must I say this? I am already an adult and am approaching my thirties.]\n Su Beibei: [We can meet. I\u2019ll choose the time and location.]\n Li Li heaved a sigh of relief. [Okay.]\n Su Beibei was a famous author of mystery novels. One of her novels had been adapted into a movie and had achieved high box office sales. The other novel had also been sold for television rights. The viewership ratings would definitely not be bad.\n Li Li was originally a fan of Su Beibei\u2019s novel. But after spending so much money, he became Su Beibei\u2019s top fan. After that, the two of them added each other on WeChat. In two years, they went from friends on WeChat to online lovers.\n The fate between the two of them could be summarized in one sentence.\n We were not meant to be, but it\u2019s all thanks to my money.\n Li Li admired Su Beibei\u2019s literary and moral values, and deeply loved her profound and interesting soul. He wanted to meet Su Beibei. He didn\u2019t mind whether she was beautiful or ugly. As long as she matched his values, Li Li would consider furthering their relationship.\n He wanted to marry Su Beibei. Su Beibei was the real reason why Li Li was single and unwilling to give in.\n It was still early when they left the Li Family. Seeing that the newly-constructed Taihu Park was rather scenic, Han Zhan suggested taking a walk before going back. Song Ci agreed.\n The night sky was slightly chilly. Song Ci\u2019s dress was cooling and her arms were slightly cold.\n Han Zhan took off his suit and draped it over Song Ci\u2019s shoulder. He was nearly 1.9 meters tall and his suit was very wide. The suit made Song Ci look even thinner, when it was put on her slim figure..\n Han Zhan looked at Song Ci\u2019s skinny arms and waist under her suit jacket and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re so skinny.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cHow am I skinny? I weigh 51.5kg.\u201d\n Han Zhan smirked. \u201cA 1.7 meters tall lady only weighs 51.5 kg. How can that be?\u201d After thinking for a moment, Han Zhan said, \u201cAccording to your height and size, you should weigh at least 55 kg.\u201d\n \u201cThose female celebrities that are 1.7 meters tall only weigh around 45 kg.\u201d Song Ci complained. \u201cDon\u2019t all men feel that a woman is fat when they hear that she weighs more than 50kg? Are you still a man?\u201d\n Han Zhan sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t you know if I\u2019m a man?\u201d\n Song Ci choked. She opened her mouth slightly to retort when she heard Han Zhan say, \u201cWe will consider giving birth again when you are 55kg.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Who wants to have children with you?\n The two of them strolled side by side. After a while, Song Ci suddenly shook Han Zhan\u2019s arm. \u201cBrother Han, let me tell you something.\u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d\n \u201cHelp me make someone famous.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at her. Without waiting for Song Ci to elaborate, Han Zhan asked, \u201cLiang Bo?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Han Zhan remained silent. His deep, limpid eyes stared at Song Ci for a long while, before he asked in a strange tone, \u201cYou like him a lot?\u201d\n Is he jealous again?\n Song Ci answered very honestly. \u201cI like his talent. He can help me earn money.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan felt much better.\n He loved such a practical woman!\n \u201cHow do you want me to help you?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI intend to let him sign with Yu Hua. Isn\u2019t Yu Hua under your name?\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly confused. \u201cYu Hua?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to have any impression of it.\n Seeing this, Song Ci was slightly stunned. Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cIsn\u2019t Yu Hu your company?\u201d Could it be that Han Zhan acquired Yu Hu later on?\n Han Zhan said, \u201cWait a minute, let me make a call.\u201d\n In front of Song Ci, Han Zhan called Bei Zhan. \u201cBei Zhan, do I have an entertainment company called Yu Hua?\u201d Bei Zhan was a few years older than Li Li and was about the same age as Han Zhan. Before Han Zhan retired from the military, he had let Bei Zhan invest in entrepreneurship on his behalf.\n Bei Zhan thought for a moment before saying, \u201cThere is such a company. Eight years ago, you asked me to register for it. But after that, you placed all your focus on Zeus Airlines, so Yu Hua has been in a state of idleness.\u201d\n Up till now, Yu Hua was only an empty shell. There weren\u2019t even many employees.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "93": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-94\n\n Chapter 93: A fragile friendship  Hearing Bei Zhan mention about eight years ago, Han Zhan remembered the reason why he registered for Yu Hua then. Han Zhan\u2019s ex-girlfriend was a singer, he founded Yu Hua with the intention of creating a clean musical empire for his ex-girlfriend.\n However, before Yu Hua could even serve its purpose, Han Zhan was kicked aside by his ex-girlfriend, so the company was left in the lurch.\n Bei Zhan asked Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, what instructions do you have?\u201d\n ]Song Ci was secretly flirting with Han Zhan, causing him to feel a slight itch in his chest. He told Bei Zhan, \u201cFind a capable person to take over Yu Hua. This company can\u2019t continue to be idle. Oh yes, the M.A.I. Group is about to disband. Get someone to poach Liang Bo from their team. This person has good musical talent and is a promising talent. He must be heavily supported.\u201d\n Although Bei Zhan was shocked, he had always been supportive of Han Zhan\u2019s decision. \u201cAlright, I will do as you say.\u201d Who would have thought that just because of a few words from Han Zhan, a musical empire would rise up?\n Han Zhan hung up and received a sweet kiss from Song Ci. \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019re so handsome!\u201d Song Ci gave Han Zhan a big thumbs-up.\n Han Zhan felt very guilty, as he didn\u2019t dare to tell Song Ci that he started this company because of his ex-girlfriend.\n ...\n Song Ci was accompanying Song Fei at Yan Jiang\u2019s house, when she received a message from Liang Bo. In the message, Liang Bo informed Song Ci that he had terminated his contract with his original management company, and had successfully signed a contract with Yu Hua.\n After reading the message, Song Ci made a call and asked Liang Bo, \u201cWho is your manager?\u201d\n Liang Bo said excitedly, \u201cIt\u2019s the company\u2019s director. She\u2019s called Zhu Wen. Do you know her, goddess?\u201d\n How can I not know her?\n Zhu Wen was known as Demon King Zhu. She had a vicious tongue and a sharp eye.\n At the age of 22, Zhu Wen had stepped into this circle. She had climbed up step by step and eventually became the CEO of Yu Hua Company. But what impressed people the most was not her status as CEO of Yu Hua, but something else.\n After 14 years of hiding in the entertainment circles, she had secretly collected a \u201clist of 136 big bosses in the entertainment circles with criminal records and evidence\u201d. At the age of 36, she had reported everyone involved.\n During that time, the entertainment circle experienced an earthquake and tsunami. Countless big shots and famous people were jailed, and Zhu Wen became a name every household knew.\n On the day the big bosses were sentenced to prison, Zhu Wen stood in front of the camera and said one sentence: Mother, I have avenged you.\n Later on, someone dug deeper and found out that Zhu Wen\u2019s mother was actually the famous and beautiful actress, queen of the late nineties, Tang Sa.\n Before Tang Sa debuted, she was married and had a daughter with her husband. Unfortunately, her good luck didn\u2019t last. Three years after their marriage, her husband fell ill and passed away early. As a result, Tang Sa had to borrow some money from loan sharks to treat his husband and raise her daughter. Tang Sa was even introduced to acting.\n With her stunning beauty, Tang Sa quickly made a name for herself. But her fame also came with dirty deals. Beauty was a double-edged sword. When you were domineering enough, your beauty was an added bonus. If you had no power or influence, your beauty would bring you fatal danger.\n She was the most beautiful actress in her generation, but her body was nowhere to be found. Many people felt pity for her back then.\n But even after her death, the murderer was still at large. In order to find out the truth behind her mother\u2019s death and to completely change this sick entertainment industry, Zhu Wen had done many things that people wanted to do but failed to do so.\n However, because she was too ruthless back then, she was ostracized. In order not to implicate the company, she resigned from her position as Yu Hua\u2019s CEO.\n After leaving the entertainment industry, Zhu Ji chose to live incognito. Even after Song Ci died, she never came out again.\n Knowing that Zhu Wen was going to personally take care of Liang Bo, Song Ci warned him. \u201cZhu Wen is very capable. You will be famous if you follow her.\u201d Zhu Wen would definitely treat Liang Bo well. After all, they were a loving couple in their previous life.\n The two of them chatted for a while more before hanging up. Song Ci bathed Song Fei and changed her clothes. She felt that it was not convenient to take care of her hair, so she cut it for her.\n When Yan Jiang returned and saw Song Fei\u2019s cut hair, he was enraged.\n Yan Jiang grabbed Song Fei\u2019s short hair and ran down to the first level in a rage. He pulled Song Ci, who was about to go home, back and questioned her angrily. \u201cSong Ci, are you jealous that Song Fei is prettier than you, so you purposely cut her hair to vent your anger?\u201d\n Song Ci was dumbstruck.\n A buzzing sound echoed in her head before she snapped out of her trance. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Song Ci pushed Yan Jiang aside and scolded. \u201cAre you saying that Song Fei is prettier than me?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s voice was filled with disbelief.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a fact that she is prettier than you?\u201d\n Song Ci was so angry that she laughed. \u201cHow is Song Fei better looking than me? All year round, she only likes to wear denim jeans and a hoodie. She doesn\u2019t even buy many dresses and doesn\u2019t know how to dress herself up at all. How is she better looking than me? Love is truly blind!\u201d\n Although he knew that Song Ci was speaking the truth, Yan Jiang just couldn\u2019t stand anyone insulting Song Fei. He opened the door, pointed outside, and said to Song Ci expressionlessly, \u201cPlease get lost. I don\u2019t wish to argue with you.\u201d\n Song Ci kicked the wall and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go away then! You\u2019re just a coward who doesn\u2019t even dare to confess to Song Fei!\u201d\n Song Ci left. Their fragile friendship was finally broken.\n Yan Jiang was so angry that his chest heaved up and down. He took the hair and returned to his room. Crouching by the bed, Yan Jiang looked at Song Fei\u2019s pale face and short hair that looked like it had been bitten by a dog. He couldn\u2019t resist reaching out to stroke Song Fei\u2019s brows.\n \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. That little fool Song Ci is just jealous of your beauty. She cut her own hair short, so she can\u2019t stand seeing your beautiful hair.\u201d\n Song Fei had no reaction.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s finger gradually moved to Song Fei\u2019s lips.\n Under his fingers, Song Fei\u2019s lips were so soft, but Yan Jiang didn\u2019t have any romantic thoughts. Instead, he was filled with pain. \u201cJust now, I quarreled with your beloved sister and you didn\u2019t even wake up when she was bullied. Song Fei, even if you don\u2019t want me, don\u2019t you want Song Ci too?\u201d\n Only silence replied to him.\n After quarreling with Yan Jiang, Song Ci returned home in a huff. She walked into the living room and realized that something was amiss.\n She turned to look at the French window. There was originally nothing by the window. Occasionally, Song Ci would bring a cup of coffee to sit cross-legged on a cushion under the window. She would drink her coffee while looking at the bustling city scenery outside.\n But today, there were many things in that spacious corner. A sapphire blue grand piano, a brand-new violin, a brand-new computer, and a voice recorder.\n Song Ci looked up at the loft in shock. The lights were on in the master bedroom upstairs and Song Ci could hear the sound of water.\n Han Zhan was showering.\n Song Ci\u2019s heartbeat quickened slightly. She walked step by step towards those instruments and found two words on the sapphire blue piano cover:\n Baby Ci.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "94": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-95\n\n Chapter 94: Pervert, Old Pervert  Thinking of something, Song Ci checked both the violin and the microphone. As expected, each item had the words \u201cBaby Ci\u201d on it.\n Song Ci stroked the strings on the violin, feeling warm inside.\n She adjusted the sound of the violin and couldn\u2019t resist playing a tune.\n It was a melodious tune.\n After Song Ci was done, she looked up and saw that Han Zhan had already finished bathing and was leaning against the piano, drinking tea with a glass in his hand. The tea was filled with Scaphium affine.\n Nourishing big boss.\n Song Ci hugged the violin and asked Han Zhan, \u201cIt must have cost a lot of money, right?\u201d Song Ci knew about this sapphire blue piano. It was specially custom-made by Shi Tanwei to commemorate his 20th anniversary in Boston. There were only 20 of them in the world.\n This isn\u2019t a piano. It\u2019s a work of art.\n It definitely cost a lot to get this piano.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI will return the favor. This is my wedding gift to you.\u201d She gave him a tie, so he gave her a top-grade musical instrument.\n \u201cThen I have profited greatly.\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t reject Han Zhan\u2019s kind intentions and accepted this big gift.\n \u201cAish.\u201d Song Ci suddenly sighed.\n \u201cWhy are you sighing?\u201d Han Zhan asked her.\n Song Ci was slightly indignant. \u201cI really want to flaunt my wealth but I\u2019m afraid of exposing your identity.\u201d\n Han Zhan reached out and caressed her head. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to try the piano?\u201d\n Song Ci immediately perked up. She hung the violin on the wall, walked over to the piano, sat down, and said to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, let me play. You sing.\u201d\n Han Zhan sat down and remained silent.\n Song Ci asked him, \u201cWhat songs do you know?\u201d\n Han Zhan said hesitantly, \u201cMilitary songs.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly stunned. She then smiled radiantly and said ingratiatingly, \u201c...A national anthem is good. A national anthem is very inspiring.\u201d\n As a result, Song Ci played a song from the volunteer army. Han Zhan sang in a deep voice, as if he was singing in the army.\n After she finished playing the song, Song Ci suddenly waved her cell phone and said to Han Zhan, \u201cI\u2019ve recorded it.\u201d\n \u201cGive it to me.\u201d Han Zhan wanted to snatch the phone away, but Song Ci wasn\u2019t willing to return it. She quickly got up and ran to the sofa to sit down, without even putting on her slippers.\n Song Ci hurriedly opened her Weibo account and said, \u201cIt will be National Day soon. We will sing our national anthem in advance to bless our country and its people.\u201d\n Han Zhan also walked over. Hearing this, he actually stopped snatching her phone, turned around, walked back to the sofa, and sat down.\n Song Ci posted on Weibo. \u201cDone.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s fans\u2019 comments were all very interesting. Some praised Han Zhan for being manly, while others praised him for having a nice voice.\n ]\u201dBrother Han, someone said that you have the voice of a male idol and you\u2019re suitable to be a broadcaster.\u201d\n Not hearing Han Zhan\u2019s reply, Song Ci put down her cell phone and turned to stare at Han Zhan. Han Zhan sat on the sofa, eating the dried sweet potato that his grandfather sent him, while watching the international news on television.\n His Adam\u2019s apple kept moving up and down when he swallowed his food.\n Song Ci stared at Han Zhan\u2019s sexy collarbone. Thinking of how he had moved his Adam\u2019s apple on top of her head yesterday afternoon, she couldn\u2019t help but swallow, as she let out a low, magnetic sigh of satisfaction.\n Her thoughts were too exciting. Song Ci suddenly got up and walked towards the kitchen with quick steps.\n Han Zhan averted his eyes from the television and followed Song Ci\u2019s back view to the kitchen. His face darkened when he saw her pour herself a glass of ice water.\n Throwing the dried sweet potato away, Han Zhan got up, walked to the kitchen, and retrieved the ice water from Song Ci\u2019s hands. \u201cHow many times have I told you not to drink ice water?\u201d He poured the ice water into the pond.\n Song Ci turned around helplessly when her palm was empty. She stared at the empty glass in Han Zhan\u2019s hand with a complicated expression. \u201cI feel a little warm.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201c24 degree celsius. Why are you feeling hot?\u201d Did she think that I\u2019m a fool?\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t possibly tell Han Zhan that whenever she saw him and thought of certain things, she would feel hot all over.\n Glaring at Han Zhan, Song Ci scolded in a low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!\u201d Stomping her feet, Song Ci ran upstairs angrily. As expected of an old man, heat can only be found in the body but not his heart.\n Staring at Song Ci\u2019s swaying hips, Han Zhan was confused. How was it my fault? Unable to figure out how he had provoked Song Ci, Han Zhan still followed her upstairs, wanting to clarify things.\n Song Ci was already taking a shower. She had removed her neck brace and placed it at the corner of the bed. As Song Ci had just turned on the shower head, the steam had yet to dissipate and Han Zhan could see Song Ci\u2019s every movement behind the translucent glass wall.\n He turned around and waited quietly.\n Song Ci took a quick shower and came out with only a towel wrapped around her. She opened the door and was shocked to see Han Zhan. She patted her chest and asked unhappily, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n Han Zhan turned around and asked humbly, \u201cAre you angry?\u201d\n Song Ci replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cBut your expression tells me that you are angry.\u201d\n Song Ci decided to go all out. She said, \u201cYes, I am angry. I received a gift from you and I am very emotional. I just want to sleep with you, when I see you sitting beside me all prim and proper.\u201d\n \u201cI blame you, I blame you for being so manly and charming but not knowing it!\u201d Song Ci took off the towel that wrapped her wet hair and threw it into the arms of the shocked Han Zhan. She asked him angrily, \u201cAre you satisfied after hearing my explanation?\u201d\n Song Ci held her breath as she spoke. By the time she was done, she was panting so hard that her collarbones and neck were moving. Her face was also red from embarrassment, making her look like a fat little puffer fish.\n Han Zhan pinched that moist towel and said in a daze, \u201cOh, so you don\u2019t want ice water, but me.\u201d\n Han Zhan concluded very precisely.\n Song Ci said, \u201c... Were you a language class representative when you were in school? Your summary skills are so good.\u201d Her cheeks burned even more. She decided to ignore Han Zhan, as she walked past him to get her neck brace.\n As they brushed past each other, Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand.\n Song Ci glared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at her with a calm expression but said, \u201cTo be honest, I already thought about it when you were playing the piano previously. But I was afraid that you would think I was a pervert, so I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d\n When he saw the sapphire blue piano, he thought about how mesmerizing it would be to see a fair Song Ci lying on it. Just thinking about it made Han Zhan want to give up being a human.\n He just wanted to be a beast.\n Song Ci was slightly stunned.\n She stared at Han Zhan\u2019s pretentious calmness and was silent for a moment, before saying with a cold smile, \u201cYou\u2019re indeed a pervert.\u201d Feeling that it wasn\u2019t enough to vent her anger, she added. \u201cOld pervert.\u201d\n He was truly a pervert and truly old.\n Han Zhan felt somewhat helpless after being criticized as being old again. He picked up the neck brace and personally put it on for Song Ci. Song Ci stood obediently and accommodated him, without acting stubbornly. She recalled her scolding Han Zhan just now and felt that something was amiss.\n If Han Zhan is an old pervert, what am I?\n Song Ci was slightly embarrassed.\n After putting on the neck brace, Han Zhan didn\u2019t retract his hand. His left hand gently stroked the edge of Song Ci\u2019s collarbone. Song Ci\u2019s neck was actually very beautiful with beautiful lines. When she looked up, her collarbone and neck were very sexy. Han Zhan had never left his mark there before.\n Han Zhan suddenly asked Song Ci, \u201cWhen can you remove your neck brace?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Why?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt\u2019s a little in the way.\u201d Many positions are locked because of this damn neck brace.\n Song Ci obviously had the same thoughts as Han Zhan. She touched her collarbone and said something that was not reflective of her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ll wear it for another week then.\u201d The next day after saying this, Song Ci secretly went to the hospital to get an X-ray and asked if she could remove her neck brace.\n The doctor took a look at the results and told Song Ci that her cervical vertebrae had recovered and the neck brace could be removed. Song Ci was overjoyed. After leaving the hospital, she even specially went to the beauty salon to perform a full-body spa procedure on herself, especially on her neck.\n After she was done, Song Ci went to the salon and handed her cell phone to the hairdresser. \u201cHere, give me a short-haired model like Liu Shishi.\u201d\n ...\n After taking off that annoying thing on her neck and getting a new hairstyle, Song Ci felt like gloating. She quickly took a few selfies and posted them on Weibo to be praised by her fans. After browsing Weibo for a while, Song Ci felt very satisfied as she watched her fans compliment her.\n She was very vain.\n After logging out of Weibo, Song Ci had just placed her cell phone on the table when it suddenly lit up. A musical ringtone sounded. Song Ci glanced down at the caller ID \u2014\n Mu Qiu.\n The smile on Song Ci\u2019s face instantly disappeared at the sight of this name. She frowned and hesitated for two seconds, before answering the call. \u201cQiu-er?\u201d\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t speak. Song Ci heard the sound of a car engine.\n \u201cAre you driving?\u201d Song Ci asked.\n Mu Qiu put on her Bluetooth earphones, before answering Song Ci. \u201cYes, I am driving. Sister, what are you doing now?\u201d\n Song Ci had just posted on Weibo and exposed that she was drinking coffee at the cafe, and she did not know if Mu Qiu had seen it. \u201cNothing, I\u2019m drinking coffee.\u201d\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cI saw your Weibo post. You are at Time Cafe, right?\u201d\n She had indeed seen my Weibo post.\n Song Ci said, \u201cYes, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \u201cThe thing is.\u201d Mu Qiu told Song Ci over the phone. \u201cDu Xueyan came to our city today to attend a ribbon-cutting event. Sister, do you want to come with me to visit her?\u201d\n Du Xueyan?\n Song Ci said, \u201cI tried to fight for her concert tickets in November but I didn\u2019t manage to.\u201d She wanted to ask Yan Jiang if he had any tickets. Yan Jiang was going to film a music video with Du Xueyan, so he might have friendship tickets.\n Like Song Ci, Mu Qiu also liked Du Xueyan very much. Hearing this, she said, \u201cI try to buy it.\u201d She didn\u2019t know how much longer she could live. Even if she managed to snatch the ticket, she might die before the concert even started.\n Song Ci was naturally not foolish enough to ask her why she didn\u2019t buy the tickets. She recalled that Mu Qiu\u2019s bucket list had stated that she wanted to meet her idol, Du Xueyan, with her own eyes. Song Ci couldn\u2019t find a reason to refuse and agreed.\n After about 20 minutes, Mu Qiu arrived. Mu Qiu didn\u2019t get out of the car but sent Song Ci a message to ask her to come out. Song Ci sent Long Yu a message to inform him to follow behind Mu Qiu\u2019s car, before she got up, walked out of the cafe, and got into Mu Qiu\u2019s car.\n The two of them chatted like close sisters. \u201cYou took off your neck brace? Have you recovered?\u201d Mu Qiu asked.\n \u201cI just took it off today.\u201d Song Ci flicked the ends of her hair playfully. \u201cI went to get a haircut, after taking off my neck brace. How is it? Does it look good?\u201d\n \u201cOf course my elder sister is beautiful.\u201d Mu Qiu looked straight ahead and smiled normally.\n Hearing this, Song Ci secretly touched her chest.\n The small wound there had already formed a scab.\n Thinking of how Mu Qiu nearly killed her that night, Song Ci felt terrified. How strong must Mu Qiu be to be able to face her with such a calm expression?\n The north coast of Wangdong City was the new city zone. The Shengdai International Plaza was situated in the heart of the new city and it was officially open for business today. On the day of its opening, there would naturally be a formal and grand opening ceremony, which invited the diva Du Xueyan.\n By the time Mu Qiu and Song Ci arrived at the Shengdai International Plaza, it was already packed with people. They could only stay at the outermost area and sit on the hood of the car to see Du Xueyan sitting at the forefront of the crowd.\n On stage, the leaders were still giving speeches about the future. Finally, the speeches ended and it was time for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.\n Under the host\u2019s instructions, the invited guests and senior management all went on stage. Du Xueyan got up from her seat. As she stepped onto the stage, her hips swayed seductively under her tight silver dress.\n Du Xueyan was a rare, pretty singer in the music circle, even in the acting industry, she was considered exceptionally beautiful. Not to mention, she had a siren-like, seductive voice.\n Du Xueyan\u2019s appearance on stage caused a stir.\n Below the stage, everyone was holding their cell phones to take photos of her. Even Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist taking out her cell phone to take a video. Lowering her head, she used her left hand to block the sunlight while her right hand gripped her cell phone. She opened WeChat and sent the short video she had just taken to Brother Han.\n Song Ci: [I see Du Xueyan! She is so beautiful in person!] After sending the message, she heard Mu Qiu say, \u201cDu Xueyan\u2019s hair is indeed very beautiful. In the past, I thought it was just photoshopped when I saw her photo.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci looked up at Du Xueyan\u2019s head.\n Du Xueyan had waist-length, lovely hair and was named the long-haired princess by many fans. She was the global spokesperson for the international hair care brand, the Shihuahua shampoo. It had been so many years and she had never been replaced.\n Today, Du Xueyan\u2019s long hair was wavy and it draped lazily over her shoulders. She was wearing a champagne-colored halter dress. As she bent over to cut the ribbon, her smooth hair fell to the sides of her face, covering half of it and making her look even more beautiful and moving.\n \u201cShe is indeed rather pretty. After all, she is the spokesperson for Shihuahua.\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t help but stroke her short hair. Actually, her long hair previously wasn\u2019t inferior to Du Xueyan\u2019s.\n However, Han Zhan didn\u2019t like long hair.\n After the ribbon-cutting ceremony ended, Du Xueyan left discreetly under the escort of the security guard. Mu Qiu patted Song Ci\u2019s hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, elder sister. Come with me to see Du Xueyan.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. \u201cYou can see her?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, Father helped.\u201d Mu Qiu didn\u2019t have much time left. Knowing that she wanted to meet Du Xueyan while she was still alive, Mu Mian doted on his daughter dearly and personally called Du Xueyan\u2019s manager to make an appointment to meet her.\n Mu Qiu shrugged and said in a self-deprecating manner, \u201cEven if I want the moon in the sky now, he might consider buying a spaceship to take me to space.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d\n Thus, Mu Qiu brought Song Ci to a private tea room.\n \u201cDu Xueyan is inside. Let\u2019s alight.\u201d\n The two of them alighted and entered the tearoom. Under the guidance of the waiter, they entered a private room. The waiter opened the door and saw a skinny man dressed in black. Du Xueyan was nowhere to be seen.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

He was not very handsome, but was very pleasant to look at. The man had eyes that seemed to be able to see through one\u2019s soul, bright and watery. He looked clean and pure, and he was Du Xueyan\u2019s manager, Gu Shengyao.\n He was the one who single-handedly turned the nameless Du Xueyan into the queen of Chinese songs. This person was not just as pure and easy to bully as he looked.\n Upon seeing Song Ci, Gu Shengyao\u2019s eyes lit up slightly. As a top manager, he had sharp eyes. With just one look, he could tell that Song Ci was a promising talent.\n He quickly averted his gaze and asked Mu Qiu, \u201cAre you Miss Mu?\u201d\n ]Mu Qiu was slightly nervous to see her long-time idol. She grabbed Song Ci\u2019s arm and acknowledged softly. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook Song Ci\u2019s arm again and said to Gu Shengyao, \u201cThis is my elder sister, Song Ci.\u201d\n Wangdong City was a bustling metropolis and a major city. It was also the location of many entertainment companies. As the top socialite in Wangdong City, Song Ci was rather famous in the entertainment circle.\n Song Ci\u2019s wedding incident had been trending on Weibo a few days ago and Gu Shengyao had even gone to take a look. Of course he knew her.\n Gu Shengyao said to Song Ci, \u201cI\u2019ve long heard of Ms. Song\u2019s name. I\u2019ve finally met you in person today.\u201d\n \u201cHello, Mr. Gu.\u201d Song Ci gave a faint smile, appearing demure and gracious.\n As they chatted, the door behind them opened.\n All three of them turned to look at the door.\n Du Xueyan was standing at the door wearing a royal blue loose blouse and a pair of tight, light-colored jeans. She was not short and was about 1.67m tall. Standing there in flat shoes, she was a slender, sexy woman.\n As she was her idol, Song Ci felt that Du Xueyan looked good in anything.\n \u201cDu Xueyan...\u201d Mu Qiu let out a soft cry.\n Faced with Mu Qiu\u2019s loss of composure, Du Xueyan appeared very easy-going. She stretched out her right hand. \u201cHello, I am Du Xueyan. You must be Mu Qiu.\u201d\n Mu Qiu let go of Song Ci and wiped her right palm on her skirt, before shaking Du Xueyan\u2019s hand. \u201cYes, I am Mu Qiu.\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s face was red with excitement.\n Song Ci also reached out her hand and said to Du Xueyan, \u201cHello Miss Du, I am Mu Qiu\u2019s elder sister, Song Ci.\u201d\n Du Xueyan shifted her gaze to Song Ci\u2019s beautiful face, and was momentarily stunned by her beauty.\n After Du Xueyan became a famous singer in the Chinese music circle, she had been developing overseas for the past few years and was busy with work most of the time. As a result, she was not familiar with the young influencers, and had never heard of Song Ci before, so she naturally didn\u2019t know her.\n Regaining her senses, Du Xueyan shook hands with Song Ci without changing her expression. \u201cHello, Ms. Song.\u201d\n \u201cYou guys continue chatting. I will go out and wait.\u201d Gu Shengyao was very gentlemanly. He left the tearoom, leaving this place for Mu Qiu and the other two to chat.\n Du Xueyan knew about Mu Qiu\u2019s health condition. Looking at this pure and dainty lady in front of her, the thought of her dying made Du Xueyan feel some pity. \u201cI heard you like me a lot.\u201d\n Mu Qiu nodded with a red face. \u201cYes, I like you very much. I\u2019ve liked you for six years.\u201d Mu Qiu poked Song Ci\u2019s arm and said to Du Xueyan, \u201cMy elder sister is also your fan. The first time I heard your song was on my elder sister\u2019s computer.\u201d\n Meeting Du Xueyan\u2019s smiling eyes, Song Ci nodded slightly. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve liked you for many years too.\u201d\n \u201cIt is my honor to be liked by all of you for so many years.\u201d Du Xueyan smiled and said with a sigh, \u201cIn the first few years of my debut, I was not very popular. At that time, all I wanted to do was sing. I was already very satisfied to be able to attend the Spring Festival Gala at the television station.\u201d\n \u201cAfter that, when I went on stage to perform in the Grammy\u2019s, I suddenly remembered the first time I attended a provincial station\u2019s Spring Festival Gala. I suddenly realized that I am really famous now. The entire world knows about me now.\u201d\n Hearing Du Xueyan\u2019s words, Song Ci and Mu Qiu also felt emotional. Mu Qiu was still young then and couldn\u2019t remember many things, but Song Ci could.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI remember the first time I saw you on television. You happened to be participating in the recording of a variety show. At that time, you were still rather helpless when faced with the host\u2019s questions.\u201d\n ]\u201dBut now, you\u2019re someone who can joke around on stage at the Grammy Awards.\u201d\n Du Xueyan shook her head and laughed. \u201cYes. It is my greatest honor to be liked by so many people like you.\u201d\n Du Xueyan opened her bag and took out an album. The album in Du Xueyan\u2019s hand was her first album since her debut. It had since stopped production and couldn\u2019t be bought online anymore.\n Du Xueyan said apologetically to Song Ci, \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were two of you, so I only brought one album.\u201d\n Although Song Ci really wanted to keep that album, she wouldn\u2019t fight with Mu Qiu. \u201cGive it to Mu Qiu.\u201d\n Du Xueyan nodded. She looked at Mu Qiu and said, \u201cYour father said that you like me a lot. I thought it wouldn\u2019t be easy to meet me, so I couldn\u2019t possibly come empty-handed. I also didn\u2019t know what to give you, so I decided to give you my first album. It\u2019s my collection, one of a kind.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was so emotional that she felt like crying. \u201cThank you, I really like it.\u201d\n \u201cCan I give you an autograph?\u201d\n Mu Qiu hurriedly nodded. \u201cAlright, can I have you write for a recipient?\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d Du Xueyan opened her pen and asked Mu Qiu with a smile, \u201cDo you have anything you want me to write?\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook her head with reddened eyes. \u201cWhatever you write will do.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After thinking for a moment, Du Xueyan put down her pen and signed on the album\u2019s cover.\n To: Mu Qiu\n You have been to this world before, and I will always remember you.\n She handed the signed album to Mu Qiu. Du Xueyan said softly, \u201cMu Qiu, good luck. Life has unlimited possibilities.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was stunned. She looked down and saw the words on the album. Her heart suddenly ached and she nearly cried on the spot. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n ]The three of them chatted for more than an hour. At this moment, Gu Shengyao knocked on the door and entered. He tapped the watch on his wrist and told Du Xueyan, \u201cXueyan, you still have an appointment with CEO Lin. If you don\u2019t leave now, you will be late.\u201d\n Du Xueyan smiled apologetically at Mu Qiu and Song Ci. She bid them farewell gently. \u201cIn that case, I will take my leave first. Miss Mu, Miss Song, I am very happy to have a heart-to-heart talk with you two.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was slightly reluctant. She hesitated before mustering up the courage to ask, \u201cCan we take a photo with you, Miss Du?\u201d\n Du Xueyan agreed. \u201cAlright, come.\u201d\n Du Xueyan opened her arms and wrapped them around Song Ci and Mu Qiu\u2019s shoulders. Realizing that Song Ci was slightly taller than herself, Du Xueyan had no choice but to hold Song Ci\u2019s slender waist.\n After taking the photo, Du Xueyan glanced at Mu Qiu again. She said, \u201cI will get my assistant to send you two concert tickets. I hope that you two will come together for my concert.\u201d\n She was also encouraging Mu Qiu not to give up hope, as she wanted to see Mu Qiu at the concert.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Mu Qiu hugged the album and finally started crying. \u201cBig sister, I really want to accompany you to her concert.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyelids drooped as she gazed calmly at Mu Qiu. She pursed her lips tightly and didn\u2019t comfort her.\n After leaving the teahouse, Gu Shengyao and Du Xueyan boarded the car.\n Without a driver, Gu Shengyao personally drove.\n Du Xueyan sat in the backseat. She tilted her head and gazed at the bustling scene outside the window. Her eyes were flickering. No one knew what she was thinking.\n Gu Shengyao suddenly said, \u201cCEO Mu really dotes on this youngest daughter of his.\u201d In order to let Du Xueyan meet Mu Qiu, Mu Mian directly gave Du Xueyan the opportunity to be the spokesperson for his shopping website.\n Du Xueyan said, \u201cThat young lady is very cute. It\u2019s not hard to understand Mu Mian\u2019s love for his daughter.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Since he mentioned Mu Qiu, Gu Shengyao naturally thought of that adopted daughter of the Mu Family, Song Ci. \u201cWhat do you think of that Song Ci?\u201d\n Du Xueyan looked at Gu Shengyao strangely and said with understanding, \u201cYou want to sign her?\u201d\n Gu Shengyao had opened an entertainment company himself and signed with several actors. Song Ci had a gorgeous face and a perfect figure. She was indeed a woman suitable for the big screen.\n Song Ci had a good figure and was born to be a star.\n \u201cI do have that thought, but...\u201d Gu Shengyao shook his head and said in a slightly regretful tone,\u201d She is married. \u201d Why didn\u2019t she think things through at such a young age?\n \u201cShe\u2019s married?\u201d Du Xueyan was truly shocked.\n It was common for people to get married late, especially good-looking youngsters. It was rare to see a beautiful girl like Song Ci get married at such a young age.\n ong Ci\u2019s gorgeous face popped into Du Xueyan\u2019s mind. She asked hesitantly, \u201cHow old is that girl? She\u2019s just in her early twenties, right? And she\u2019s already married?\u201d\n Nodding, Gu Shengyao said, \u201cSong Ci is Wangdong City\u2019s top socialite. As you can see, she is very beautiful. I heard that she studied at the Civil Aviation University of China. She is a female pilot with a flight license. Almost all those wealthy young masters in Wangdong City are her friends.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s good-looking, talented, and capable. It\u2019s very easy to package her in the entertainment circle, but she\u2019s married. Last month, she suddenly got married to a man from an ordinary family.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a pity?\u201d\n Hearing this, Du Xueyan felt even more puzzled. The more wealthy a family was, the more they would value an equal social status. How could the Mu Family agree to let Song Ci marry an ordinary man?\n \u201cDid CEO Mu agree to her marriage?\u201d\n Gu Shengyao shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am not sure about that. I only know that she is married to a man with a handicapped hand. This matter was even trending on Weibo last month.\u201d\n Hearing that his hand was handicapped, Du Xueyan\u2019s gaze suddenly froze. She asked casually, \u201cHow did his handicapped hand come about?\u201d\n Gu Shengyao didn\u2019t notice Du Xueyan\u2019s unusual reaction and shook his head slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think he broke a few fingers.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n \u201cIs that so...\u201d\n Lowering her head, Du Xueyan opened Baidu and tried to search for Song Ci. As Gu Shengyao had said, Song Ci was indeed a rather famous beauty and there were many gossip reports about her on Baidu.\n Du Xueyan tried to search the forums in Wangdong City, and she really found the post about Song Ci\u2019s marriage. Du Xueyan continued reading, and her heart suddenly contracted, when she saw that the name of Song Ci\u2019s marriage partner was Han Zhan.\n Handicapped hand, ordinary family background, Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan...\n Du Xueyan suddenly shut her eyes and didn\u2019t look at her cell phone again. She didn\u2019t know if she was feeling bored or she was afraid to look at it.\n Gu Shengyao glanced at Du Xueyan through the rearview mirror. She had her eyes closed and he thought she was sleepy. \u201cAre you tired?\u201d\n Du Xueyan seemed to have fallen asleep and didn\u2019t speak.\n After a long while, Du Xueyan suddenly opened her eyes and looked down at her own face on the screen. In a daze, she seemed to have seen her young self. At that time, she was youthful and full of vigor, but still retained some naivety. Upon closer inspection, that innocent girl from back then had long been swallowed by time.\n Apart from her looks, there was no other trace of her previous shadow.\n \u201cSong Ci\u2019s partner is Han Zhan.\u201d\n Hearing Du Xueyan\u2019s words, Gu Shengyao felt that it was strange. Du Xueyan said \u201cit\u2019s Han Zhan\u201d instead of \u201cnamed Han Zhan\u201d\u2014there was a difference. It meant that they knew Han Zhan.\n \u201cHan Zhan?\u201d Gu Shengyao had no impression of this name. He searched his memory as he drove.\n Finally, he remembered!\n Eight years ago, Gu Shengyao was just a slightly famous manager under Opus Music Company. That year, he met Du Xueyan, who had just graduated from university and entered the music circle.\n Gu Shengyao had a good eye for talent. It was the first time he saw Du Xueyan performing on stage, and she was still young and immature. Gu Shengyao knew that this woman would definitely become the queen of songs after being meticulously groomed.\n There was no reason other than that her voice was very melodious.\n As one of the three largest entertainment companies in the country, Opus Entertainment was very strict in terms of managing its artists. One of the most important rules for signed artists was that they were not allowed to date.\n At that time, Du Xueyan already had a boyfriend called Han Zhan.\n When Gu Shengyao went to look for Du Xueyan and told her that he wanted to sign her and promised to do his best to groom her, Du Xueyan, as a rookie singer who yearned for success, was very moved. However, Du Xueyan couldn\u2019t bear to let go of her boyfriend and kept hesitating.\n But in this world, it was not easy to have the best of both worlds.\n At that time, there was a major earthquake in Bijiang City. Du Xueyan\u2019s boyfriend was ordered to rescue the victims at the site of the disaster. Unfortunately, he was unlucky and was crushed by the collapse of a building. Although he was successfully rescued, he lost two fingers.\n It was a disaster for a man, who touched guns, to lose his index finger and middle finger that held the trigger. Power and status were things that Han Zhan would never have in his life.\n Han Zhan\u2019s amputation crushed the last bit of hesitation in Du Xueyan\u2019s heart. Her desire to excel ultimately triumphed over that unreal love with no future.\n Shortly after the man\u2019s fingers were amputated, Du Xueyan broke up with him.\n Handicapped hand and ordinary family background...\n Everything matched!\n Gu Shengyao was shocked. He asked Du Xueyan uncertainly, \u201cIs this Han Zhan your ex-boyfriend?\u201d After asking, Gu Shengyao turned and glanced at Du Xueyan.\n Du Xueyan had been keeping silent as she stared at the car window. All these years, her black eyes, which had always been calm and steady, were now filled with tears.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Song Ci\u2019s husband was actually Han Zhan and she was a fan of Du Xueyan...\n Du Xueyan suddenly gave a bitter smile. \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d She laughed in a self-deprecating manner and said in a low voice, \u201cThree days after he got injured while trying to save someone and had to amputate his two fingers, I dumped him...\u201d Saying that, Du Xueyan gritted her teeth as her eyes reddened slightly.\n After knowing each other for seven years and being in a relationship for five years, Du Xueyan was not completely heartless.\n All these years, whenever she received even more applause and glory, stepped down from the stage and realized that she didn\u2019t even have someone to share her joy with, she would miss that person terribly.\n But thinking of Han Zhan, Du Xueyan felt very ashamed.\n If Du Xueyan felt guilty towards anyone in this life, it would be Han Zhan.\n Eight years ago, Han Zhan was the most highly regarded and respected sniper in the southwest. If everything went according to plan, Han Zhan would definitely become a national weapon that could shoot the enemy in the heart every time!\n But disaster found him.\n Du Xueyan knew that losing his right index and middle finger would be a devastating blow to an elite sniper. She also knew that if she were to break up, the man who was already struggling on the brink of despair would be sent to hell.\n But she still broke up with him. She was ambitious and wanted to have a bright future, and Han Zhan couldn\u2019t give her what she wanted.\n Seeing that Du Xueyan looked guilty as she reminisced, Gu Shengyao suddenly said, \u201cAre you guilty? If you are guilty, then you should maintain your good condition and continue to be popular.\u201d\n Gu Shengyao was heartless. If not, he would not be where he was today.\n He glanced at the dazed Du Xueyan and pointed out even more ruthlessly. \u201cOnly by standing in your position, you will not let down your heartless self from back then.\u201d\n That heartless statement was pinned to Du Xueyan\u2019s body and her lips trembled.\n Du Xueyan asked Gu Shengyao, \u201cAm I a bad woman?\u201d\n Gu Shengyao said coldly, \u201cYou are a perfect idol.\u201d As a manager, he didn\u2019t want a good woman. He wanted a good artiste.\n Du Xueyan smirked but didn\u2019t answer.\n Gu Shengyao knew what Du Xueyan was thinking. He said in a low voice, \u201cXueyan, you are not the kind of woman who is willing to lead a peaceful life.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s expression was slightly stunned. If not for the light makeup covering her original skin color, Gu Shengyao would have definitely seen Du Xueyan\u2019s face turn pale instantly.\n Some women yearned for a peaceful life and a happy family, but Du Xueyan was born to chase after the stars. She was born to sing.\n When she was struggling, she yearned for the blue sky and the blue clouds. It was not easy for her to touch the blue sky and see the wider world. How could she be willing to fall again?\n She might not be able to bear to part with that man, but she definitely wouldn\u2019t regret her actions.\n As they stopped the car and waited for the traffic light to turn green, Gu Shengyao turned back to look at Du Xueyan, whose eyes were sparkling. He said, \u201cThe thing you miss is the throbbing first love, and not that man. If you really loved him so much, you wouldn\u2019t have left him at that point in time.\u201d\n Gu Shengyao\u2019s every word was heart-rending and Du Xueyan\u2019s face was ashen.\n Gu Shengyao was right. After graduating from high school, Han Zhan enlisted in the military and Du Xueyan enrolled in the music academy. The two of them were separated by land and rarely saw each other in a year. Regardless of how strong their feelings were, they would gradually become thin and weak, after being separated for so long.\n Without that signed contract, there would also be other reasons for their breakup. But Du Xueyan had done the most cruel thing to Han Zhan at the most inappropriate time.\n There were many first loves who ended up breaking up, but it was rare to see such ugly results.\n Seeing Du Xueyan\u2019s remorseful look, a sharp glint flashed across Gu Shengyao\u2019s eyes. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that you still love him, but it\u2019s because the person you once loved belongs to another woman. Your possessiveness is acting up and you\u2019re just jealous.\u201d\n Gu Shengyao\u2019s words completely stripped Du Xueyan of her pretentious and beautiful facade. He exposed that selfish and self-righteous woman.\n Du Xueyan remained silent for a long while before sighing. \u201cYou are right.\u201d She was indeed a selfish, cold, and materialistic woman. She was too full of herself and thought that the man who once loved her should love her forever.\n She wasn\u2019t some cash cow. There was no need for Han Zhan to stand there foolishly and wait for her return.\n ...\n Han Zhan was very busy today and didn\u2019t have time to look at his cell phone. By the time he finished his work, the sky had already turned dark. Looking at the time, it was already 8pm.\n Han Zhan had not had dinner. He took out his cell phone and wanted to send Song Ci a video asking if she wanted to come out for dinner. Opening his WeChat, Han Zhan realized that Song Ci had sent him a video and a message at 2pm.\n Ci Bao: [I see Du Xueyan! She is so beautiful in person!]\n Upon seeing the name Du Xueyan, Han Zhan was still somewhat dazed.\n He snapped out of his trance and clicked on the video calmly. He saw Du Xueyan in a gown amidst the crowd, looking elegant and classy.\n Fame was good for nourishing people. Du Xueyan had been famous for so many years and was getting prettier by the day. Every move she made was like that of a superstar.\n She was indeed a beauty.\n But...\n Although a beauty was beautiful, there was no way she could affect his heart, even in the slightest way. Han Zhan exited the video, deleted the video expressionlessly, and video-called Song Ci.\n Song Ci quickly accepted the video call.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d\n Staring at the background behind Song Ci, Han Zhan asked her, \u201cAre you outside?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. She raised her cell phone and turned it so that Han Zhan could see her surroundings clearly. After that, the camera focused back on Song Ci\u2019s face. She told Han Zhan, \u201cI\u2019m having dinner outside with Mu Qiu.\u201d\n At this moment, Mu Qiu\u2019s face appeared on screen again.\n Mu Qiu looked up at the camera and greeted him obediently.\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan replied coldly. His attitude towards Mu Qiu was completely different from his attitude towards Song Ci.\n Mu Qiu naturally sensed her brother-in-law\u2019s coldness but she didn\u2019t care.\n Han Zhan picked up his briefcase, his jacket, and walked towards the lift while talking on the phone.\n Song Ci asked him, \u201cAre you still at work?\u201d\n \u201cI was about to leave.\u201d Just as he was about to enter the lift, Han Zhan suddenly stopped and looked down at Song Ci. \u201cHave you eaten? If not, wait for me.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cWait a moment, let me ask Mu Qiu.\u201d Song Ci turned and said to Mu Qiu, \u201cYour brother-in-law hasn\u2019t eaten yet, can I ask him to come over?\u201d\n Mu Qiu chuckled. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n Only then did Song Ci tell Han Zhan the restaurant\u2019s name.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Han Zhan hung up the video call and entered the lift.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

The two sisters were sitting in a small private room, chatting and waiting for Han Zhan.\n When Han Zhan pushed open the door and entered, a 1.9m tall man stood in the small private room. His presence was too strong and the room instantly felt slightly narrow.\n Mu Qiu was too embarrassed to openly size Han Zhan up, and only dared to glance at him from time to time. She thought regretfully in her heart: What a pity, such a handsome and tall man is a handicap.\n Since this was the first time Han Zhan met Mu Qiu, he had prepared a pearl brooch for her. It was not an expensive gift, but it was a very likable gift.\n Mu Qiu grinned as she placed the brooch on her chest. She looked up at Han Zhan and gave him a shy smile, thanking him for his gift. \u201cThank you Brother-in-law for spending so much money on me. The brooch is very nice. I like it a lot.\u201d\n Han Zhan placed a dumpling in Song Ci\u2019s bowl, before looking up at Mu Qiu. He replied in a cold and polite manner, \u201cIt\u2019s just a small gift. It\u2019s not expensive. Moreover, you\u2019re Song Ci\u2019s younger sister. I have to please you, right?\u201d\n Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s hand but stared straight at Mu Qiu. He said half-jokingly, \u201cI will remember and treat everyone who treats Song Ci well. Of course, to all the people who bully Song Ci, I\u2019ll pay back double of what they did.\u201d\n \u201cWhoever makes Song Ci bleed, I will make her pay with her life.\u201d\n ]This was supposed to be a funny sentence, but paired with Han Zhan\u2019s imposing manner and overly serious expression, it actually made one shudder in fear.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s expression remained unchanged, but her grip on her chopsticks tightened.\n What is Han Zhan hinting at?\n Did he discover something?\n Could it be...\n Mu Qiu felt a chill down her spine, as she thought of how she had nearly assassinated Song Ci that night at Han Zhan\u2019s house.\n Mu Qiu instinctively looked down, not daring to look at Han Zhan.\n At this point, Song Ci suddenly giggled. Mu Qiu looked up in surprise and saw Song Ci pinching Han Zhan\u2019s cheek.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, as she asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, are you watching dramas again? I asked you to learn romance from television, not to learn how to act cool from them.\u201d\n Han Zhan also smiled. He tilted his head and asked Song Ci, \u201cAren\u2019t my words just now romantic?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n Han Zhan took a sip of water and said humbly, \u201cLooks like I have to learn again.\u201d\n The confused Mu Qiu asked humbly, \u201cWhat... are you talking about?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled for a long time before finally stopping. She couldn\u2019t conceal the happiness and pride in her eyes. Song Ci told Mu Qiu, \u201cYour brother-in-law is already in his thirties and can\u2019t keep up with our young lives anymore. He doesn\u2019t even know how to sweet-talk.\u201d\n \u201cI detested the fact that he doesn\u2019t know how to speak sweet nothings, so I told him to learn from television shows. Just now, he intentionally said sweet nothings to me in front of you to cheer me up and to flaunt our love, but this fool...\u201d\n \u201cToo silly! Whoever makes Song Ci bleed, I will make her pay with her life...\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t help laughing again until her stomach hurt.\n Song Ci placed her palm on the back of Han Zhan\u2019s hand, and looked up into his deep blue eyes. She started to act coquettishly again. \u201cBrother Han, you must protect me well. Don\u2019t let me get hurt.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cMmm, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d\n ]Mu Qiu suddenly felt very dull. The dishes on the table in front of her all tasted like dog food.\n After the meal, Song Ci and Han Zhan bid farewell to Mu Qiu before leaving together.\n Han Zhan drove and Song Ci sat obediently in the passenger seat.\n After fastening her seatbelt, Song Ci gave Han Zhan a thumbs-up. \u201cGood job, Brother Han. You performed exceptionally well today. You deserve a reward.\u201d\n Thinking of Mu Qiu\u2019s terrified expression as she held her chopsticks tightly, Song Ci felt very good.\n Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s my reward?\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly stretched out his left hand and placed his palm on Song Ci\u2019s smooth, fair skin. Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s nearly transparent blood vessels and praised her. \u201cYour neck is very beautiful.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to look straight into Han Zhan\u2019s fiery eyes.\n She acknowledged softly. \u201cOf course. Which part of my body doesn\u2019t look good?\u201d\n Han Zhan really wanted to lean over and kiss that enticing neck\u2014he had indeed done so. However, before he could get close to Song Ci\u2019s skin, he heard her say in a cold voice, \u201cMy neck is so beautiful. When you strangle it, isn\u2019t it equally vicious?\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n He recalled how he had nearly broken Song Ci\u2019s neck on the day of her car accident. Han Zhan looked embarrassed, as he drew back and gently stroked Song Ci\u2019s neck through the leather glove on his right hand.\n Half a second later, Han Zhan suddenly sighed. \u201cYou can only blame your neck for being too thin.\u201d\n Song Ci was enraged. She took off her seatbelt on the spot, leaned over the handle of the car, and sat down directly on Han Zhan. Gritting her teeth, Song Ci reached out her hands and grabbed Han Zhan by the neck.\n She threatened him sternly. \u201cDo you believe that I\u2019ll strangle you to death?\u201d\n However, Han Zhan held her waist with both hands and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s voice instantly turned hoarse, sounding very seductive.\n If anything were to happen again, there was no guarantee that there would be an expos\u00e9 on Wangdong City\u2019s forum tomorrow: \u201cSong Ci and her husband are newlyweds, and they openly XX.\u201d\n Song Ci noticed the change in Han Zhan. She cursed under her breath and hurried back to her seat. Song Ci fastened her seatbelt and lowered the window to let the wind in, letting her red cheeks cool down slightly.\n Mu Qiu stood at the entrance of the restaurant from afar. Through the windshield of the car, she witnessed Song Ci flirting with her brother-in-law. Her eyes were filled with envy and yearning.\n What is love like?\n Mu Qiu also had a crush on guys in the past, but she didn\u2019t have any serious dating experience. She took out her bucket list and stared at the last three items in a daze.\n Number six: Choose a suitable grave for yourself.\n Number seven: Wear a wedding gown once to take a solo wedding photo.\n Number 8: Sleeping with a handsome single man.\n A man\u2019s image flashed across Mu Qiu\u2019s mind. She shook her head, folded the list, and stuffed it into her bag.\n A dying person had no right to fall in love.\n There was not much time left in her life. Mu Qiu didn\u2019t want to go home and sleep early, as she felt it was a waste of time. Standing on the hot and noisy streets, Mu Qiu suddenly felt an urge to find someone to accompany her.\n At 9.30pm, Mu Qiu stood at the entrance of the bar street and gazed at it.\n On both sides of the street were bars that opened one after another. Some of the bars were very famous and visitors from other places to Wangdong City would frequent there. They would specially visit those bars to get some drinks.\n After hesitating for a moment, Mu Qiu finally moved towards a bar called One-Station.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "100": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-101\n\n Chapter 100: Cheng Yanmo VS Mu Qiu  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n One-Station was Wangdong City\u2019s most unique bar.\n The bar was over 3,000 square meters in area. In the middle of the bar was a performance stage where celebrities, world-renowned DJs, and strippers frequently performed.\n Surrounding the stage was a circular dance floor. The dance floor was filled with people all the time, struggling to move along with the surging music. Outside the dance floor was a Harmony System high-speed train in the shape of a circle.\n Each carriage was divided into 18 booths and a bar counter was set up at the end of each carriage. The bartender would be waiting there for the guests who stayed out every night.\n The noisy dance floor and the silence of the Harmony System created a subtle but unique sense of mystery.\n Mu Qiu was not good at dancing and didn\u2019t have the energy to do so. She went straight into the 7th Carriage of the Harmony System, and observed the bar for a while before ordering a cocktail called \u201cNorthern Passenger\u201d under the bartender\u2019s recommendation.\n The wine was beautifully seasoned with a layer of orange-red liquid at the top, an ice crystal-like drink in the middle, and a dark blue liquid at the bottom. The rim of the glass was decorated with half an orange.\n Mu Qiu took a sip. The alcohol content was not high. For someone like Mu Qiu who could not hold her liquor well, such alcohol was the most suitable.\n Carrying her drink, Mu Qiu walked over to table 5 and sat down by the window. From here, the dance floor could be seen, as well as the stage. At this moment, the music had died down and a handsome young man walked onto the stage.\n The man sang a love song. It was a song Mu Qiu had never heard before. She happened to hear one line:\n [You used to make me very happy, but now I feel lonely just thinking about it. Love has made me the type of person that I hate the most...]\n This was a song Mu Qiu had never heard before. Hearing the lyrics, she was slightly stunned.\n Love has made me the type of person that I hate the most...\n Mu Qiu shook her head and thought that love had nothing to do with her. She was still a little virgin even until her death. Mu Qiu opened her cell phone and wanted to look for a scenic spot near Wangdong City, to find a grave for herself.\n Mu Qiu was so engrossed in her phone that she didn\u2019t notice that there were more and more people around her. In the end, only the seat beside her was empty. At 10.20pm, a dark blue figure sat down beside Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu stared at her cell phone. She reached for her drink and realized that it was empty.\n She finished her drink.\n Mu Qiu got up and was about to order another drink, when she saw a man in a suit sitting beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s you. Do you still remember me?\u201d Mu Qiu was pleasantly surprised to see Cheng Yanmo again after so many days.\n Hearing this, the man who was looking down at his cell phone looked up. Cheng Yanmo was also slightly surprised to see Mu Qiu. \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d\n It seems like he still remembers me.\n Mu Qiu sat down again and said to Cheng Yanmo, \u201cWhat do you want to drink? My treat. I haven\u2019t thanked you properly for sending me home the previous time.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had come to the bar to catch Cheng Ziang, but there were too many people at the bar and he couldn\u2019t find him. As he found it too noisy outside, Cheng Yanmo entered the Harmony System in order to avoid the sounds. He had wanted to just sit down and leave, but he bumped into Mu Qiu.\n Meeting Mu Qiu\u2019s smiling eyes, Cheng Yanmo instinctively said, \u201cSame as you.\u201d\n Mu Qiu pointed at her wine glass and said to Cheng Yanmo, \u201cI just drank a glass of \u2018Northern Passenger\u2019 and it\u2019s quite tasty. I want another glass.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll have one too then.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mu Qiu got up and left her seat. Soon, she returned with two glasses of wine. Cheng Yanmo quickly got up and let Mu Qiu sit by the window, while he sat down by the aisle.\n Cheng Yanmo took a sip of the wine expressionlessly. He didn\u2019t like the taste of this wine, but it was very popular with young girls.\n Staring at Mu Qiu, Cheng Yanmo hesitated.\n Mu Qiu could tell that Cheng Yanmo wanted to say something, so she asked him, \u201cDo you have something to tell me?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo frowned slightly. Staring at Mu Qiu\u2019s slender figure and that innocent and adorable face, he finally asked the question on his mind. \u201cLittle girl, are you an adult yet?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was stunned. She covered her mouth and laughed. \u201cDo I look like a minor?\u201d Cheng Yanmo couldn\u2019t be blamed for thinking this way, as Mu Qiu indeed looked like a high school student.\n Unlike her sexy elder sister, Song Ci, Mu Qiu didn\u2019t have a hot figure. Her chest was slightly puffed up and she was only cup size B at best. She was about 1.63m tall and had a sickly skinny frame. Wearing a baby-collared dress, she was indeed very small.\n Mu Qiu took out her identification card and placed it in front of Cheng Yanmo. She said cheekily, \u201c20 years old.\u201d\n Suspicious, Cheng Yanmo glanced down. Being born in April 1999 indeed meant that she was 20 years old. Cheng Yanmo\u2019s frown finally relaxed. He pushed his identification card toward Mu Qiu and said, \u201cYou are Mu Qiu.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Mu Qiu.\u201d Mu Qiu reached out to Cheng Yanmo. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was silent for a moment, before shaking hands with Mu Qiu and telling her his name. \u201cCheng Yanmo.\u201d\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cCheng Yanmo, hey, your name is the same as Master Cheng\u2019s!\u201d With that, she saw a mischievous glint flash across Cheng Yanmo\u2019s glasses. Mu Qiu was stunned. She hurriedly picked up her cell phone and searched for Cheng Yanmo\u2019s personal information.\n A photo popped up. It was the same facial features as the man beside her, except that he looked even colder and sharper in person.\n He\u2019s Cheng Yanmo? Cheng Ziang\u2019s elder brother? That Cheng Yanmo who is acclaimed as Wangdong City\u2019s number one young prodigy?\n Mu Qiu peeked at Cheng Yanmo\u2019s face.\n Cheng Yanmo asked her, amused, \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\n Mu Qiu said honestly, \u201cYou\u2019re quite good looking.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was stunned.\n He was not as outgoing and passionate as Cheng Ziang. From a young age, he had been steady and self-disciplined, and all his friends were steady and reliable. There were also celebrities and socialites who tried to curry favor with him by climbing into his bed, but none of them dared to praise him so openly.\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t know how to answer Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu had already lowered her head to drink her drink. She sat sideways with her back facing Cheng Yanmo, as she played with her cell phone. She was reading the gossip on Wangdong City\u2019s forum. She saw a post titled \u201cWangdong City Rankings of the Rich Young Masters\u201d.\n Mu Qiu opened the post and saw the original poster\u2019s comment:\n As a member of the Swimming Club, she had seen many young and powerful men from Wangdong City. As such, she compiled the rankings. Note: The ranking is real and reliable. No rebuttal accepted.\n Number one: Cheng Yanmo, 19.\n Second place: Dongfang Yu, 18;\n ...\n Mu Qiu stared at the words \u201c19\u201d at the back of Cheng Yanmo\u2019s name, feeling somewhat lost.\n Is 19 his age? Something doesn\u2019t seem right.\n Mu Qiu tapped her own head and read the content again. After understanding what the original poster meant by the rankings, her face suddenly blushed.\n From the corner of his eye, Cheng Yanmo saw Mu Qiu staring at her cell phone. For some reason, her fair and clean face suddenly turned red, as if she was drunk.\n He felt somewhat puzzled.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

However, as the wine entered her stomach, her throat started to feel hot again. Mu Qiu stole a glance at the man beside her, and couldn\u2019t help but look in the wrong direction.\n With just one look, Mu Qiu turned back guiltily.\n She picked up her glass again and finished the rest of her drink.\n Watching Mu Qiu\u2019s frantic actions, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s suspicions grew. What did she just see?\n \u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s face was as red as an apple. Cheng Yanmo was worried that Mu Qiu was drunk.\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s voice was so close to her, and his breath seemed to be right beside her ear. Mu Qiu\u2019s mind was filled with thoughts of 19. She shook her exploding brain and answered groggily, \u201cI think it\u2019s a little hot. Oh no, it\u2019s not hot. It\u2019s just that the wine is slightly hot...\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo saw that she was distracted and didn\u2019t probe further.\n He still had to go on a work trip tomorrow and was about to leave. \u201cLet\u2019s go together. It\u2019s not safe for a girl to be alone in a bar for too long.\u201d Cheng Yanmo stood up.\n \u201cAlright.\u201d Mu Qiu picked up her bag and stood up.\n The two of them walked one after another through the bustling crowd, and finally walked out of the bar. Standing at the door, Cheng Yanmo told Mu Qiu, \u201cI still have something on, so I can\u2019t send you back. Did you drive here yourself?\u201d\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cYes, I can go back myself.\u201d\n However, Cheng Yanmo shook his head. \u201cNo, you are drunk and can\u2019t drive.\u201d Cheng Yanmo was also worried about getting a designated driver to send Mu Qiu home. In his eyes, Mu Qiu was too petite and could easily be bullied.\n After pondering for a moment, Cheng Yanmo finally said, \u201cLet\u2019s take my car.\u201d\n Mu Qiu firmly rejected him this time. \u201cNo need, Mr. Cheng. You can go back first. My driver will come and fetch me.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t doubt the veracity of Mu Qiu\u2019s words. To be able to stay in the Amethyst Gated Community meant that Mu Qiu\u2019s family must be very wealthy. It was very normal for her to have a chauffeur. \u201cAlright then, go home early.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo got into his car and was in no hurry to drive off. He sat down and called Cheng Ziang.\n This time, Cheng Ziang actually answered.\n \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang stood on the noisy dance floor. He couldn\u2019t hear his brother\u2019s voice, but just the sight of his brother\u2019s name terrified him. \u201cWait!\u201d Cheng Ziang walked out of the bar holding his cell phone and stood under a tree to answer the call.\n \u201cBrother, I\u2019m at the bar. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had already seen Cheng Ziang standing at the door of a bar flirting with girls.\n He took a deep breath and hollered. \u201cGet over here!\u201d\n Cheng Ziang was stunned. He looked up suddenly and saw the black car at the end of the street. His expression changed slightly, as he gripped his cell phone tightly. \u201cRight away! I\u2019ll go and say \u2018bye\u2019 to my friends first.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang hung up the phone, turned around, entered the bar, found his friends, and bid them farewell. \u201cI\u2019ll get going first. Have a good time.\u201d Saying that, Cheng Ziang picked up the car keys he had placed on the sofa.\n A friend grabbed him and pouted at the DJ. \u201cAre you leaving just like that? Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to meet her?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang stared at the female DJ. She was dressed in a punk style, with a loose sweater and ripped jeans. Her dirty hair made her look like a hooligan but also very cool. Although she was dressed up in an exaggerated punk style, she was very pretty.\n Her name was Han Wangwang and she was the new girl that Cheng Ziang had been into recently. She was just 20 years old and very hot, but also very hot-tempered. Cheng Ziang had been flirting with her these past few nights and her attitude had been lukewarm. Cheng Ziang was losing his patience.\n Thinking of Cheng Yanmo, Cheng Ziang could only suppress the agitation in his heart. \u201cAnother day. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d Cheng Ziang sped away from the bar.\n Afraid that Cheng Yanmo would beat him up, he got into the backseat.\n \u201cBrother, why are you looking for me?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was 28 years old this year, and was the eldest young master of Chuan Dong Group in name. In reality, he was already the true power behind Chuan Dong Group. Their father had already decided to step down and officially let Cheng Yanmo take over the position.\n Cheng Yanmo was very busy every day. Cheng Ziang was surprised and slightly afraid that he came looking for him. Cheng Yanmo smelled the perfume scent on Cheng Ziang, and looked slightly gloomy. \u201cZiang.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang said, \u201cAh?\u201d He looked up at the driver\u2019s seat and saw Cheng Yanmo\u2019s exceptionally stern profile.\n Cheng Ziang felt uneasy seeing his brother like this.\n Cheng Ziang thought that Cheng Yanmo would scold him like usual, but after a long silence, he just sighed. \u201cZiang, you are already 25 years old and you\u2019ve reached the age where you can get married and have children.\u201d\n \u201cIs it fun to continue playing like this?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo felt slightly apologetic as he looked at his frivolous younger brother.\n From a young age, Cheng Yanmo had been groomed to be the successor of Chuan Dong Group. He had grown up abroad and received the cruelest and most elite education. His younger brother, Cheng Ziang, was the youngest. At that time, his mother couldn\u2019t bear for both children to leave the country, so she left him by her side to accompany and take care of her.\n When Cheng Ziang was 12 years old, Father Cheng had an affair with a female celebrity. In order to stir things up, Father Cheng brought the female celebrity home and fooled around in his wife\u2019s bed, and that female celebrity was Mother Cheng\u2019s best friend.\n When Cheng Ziang\u2019s mother came home and witnessed this scene, she was so angry that she stabbed her best friend to death and hurt Father Cheng, before hanging herself. When Cheng Ziang returned home from school and saw his mother hung up and covered in blood, he was utterly stunned.\n After Cheng Yanmo returned to China to attend his mother\u2019s funeral, he only spent half a month with Cheng Ziang, before returning to school due to a heavy workload. Meanwhile, Father Cheng was so terrified by the death of his wife and mistress, he had nightmares every night and even ended up moving out of that house.\n Meanwhile, Cheng Ziang stubbornly stayed in his mother\u2019s house and refused to move out with his father.\n Only when Cheng Yanmo returned to the country after completing his studies did he realize that his obedient and sensible little brother had already turned bad. His father had an affair and his mother had committed suicide. In the days when he was alone, Cheng Ziang had learned to smoke, go to bars, race cars, gamble, and play with women...\n An elder brother was like a father, so Cheng Yanmo also had a responsibility for how his brother turned out.\n After hearing Cheng Yanmo\u2019s words, Cheng Ziang couldn\u2019t help but laugh mockingly. \u201cWhat marriage? A playboy like me won\u2019t be loyal even if I get married. In the end, I might even end up being stabbed to death by my wife...\u201d\n He was mocking their father. However, Cheng Ziang didn\u2019t know that in his previous life, his devastated marriage with Song Ci indeed ended with him being stabbed in the gut.\n Hearing Cheng Ziang\u2019s words, Cheng Yanmo felt slightly upset. He really wanted to apologize to Cheng Ziang\u2014it was Cheng Yanmo who had neglected him\u2014but as the words reached the tip of his tongue, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s heart sank. He just couldn\u2019t open his mouth.\n \u201cI am worried that you will cause trouble if you continue playing like this.\u201d Cheng Ziang was a troublemaker. Cheng Yanmo could protect him once, but not forever.\n Cheng Ziang pouted. \u201cWhat could happen?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go back. I am sleepy.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo took off his glasses, rubbed his brows, and put them back on. Only then did he call the chauffeur in and asked him to drive them home.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

While she was showering, she washed her hair. She took off her hair towel and found an electric hairdryer to blow dry it. Pulling open the drawer, Mu Qiu reached out to take the electric hairdryer, but her eyes were attracted by the soft ruler beside it.\n Recalling the post she had seen previously, Mu Qiu took out the soft ruler and pulled it open to compare.\n Mu Qiu tossed the soft ruler aside as her heart thumped wildly.\n ...\n Song Ci had taken off her neck brace today. On the way home, Han Zhan kept glancing at Song Ci\u2019s neck while waiting at red lights. I can easily leave my marks on such a white neck...\n Han Zhan\u2019s gaze was too aggressive and Song Ci felt uneasy. She knew that it would definitely be midnight, before she could sleep tonight. Thinking of what was going to happen later, Song Ci was both afraid and expectant.\n Brother Han had good skills and good stamina. Song Ci liked to be close to Han Zhan, but it was not a good thing to have too good of a stamina.\n The car drove into the basement. Han Zhan and Song Ci unbuckled their seatbelts, alighted, and entered the lift one after the other silently. Song Ci stood near the lift door, while Han Zhan leaned back slightly.\n Song Ci stared at the reflective wall of the lift, and saw Han Zhan staring at her from behind, as if looking at his own possession, with a domineering and deep gaze. The lift slowly rose. Song Ci and Han Zhan still didn\u2019t speak, but there was an invisible flame burning and roasting inside the lift.\n The longer they remained silent, the more frightening the later explosion would be.\n The lift finally stopped in front of Han Zhan\u2019s house.\n The house that Han Zhan bought was a one-floor apartment. The lift connected directly to his house, and all the entrances that came out of the lift belonged to it. The two of them stepped out of the lift, with Song Ci in front and Han Zhan behind.\n Song Ci took out the keys from her bag to open the door. Just as she inserted the keys into the keyhole, a pair of strong arms wrapped around her waist. Han Zhan bit Song Ci\u2019s ear in his mouth.\n Stimulated, Song Ci\u2019s scalp went numb and her hands trembled slightly. Shivering, she unlocked the door and was just about to open it, when Han Zhan pushed her into the house from behind.\n Song Ci nearly fell but Han Zhan\u2019s long legs grabbed her by the waist. After a rush of dizziness, Song Ci\u2019s back was pressed against the wall. She looked up and met Han Zhan\u2019s lust-filled eyes, secretly shocking her.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d She instinctively swallowed and pointed to the second floor. Song Ci said, \u201cShall we go to the second floor?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly carried Song Ci up and brought her to the French window in front of the living room\u2019s camera. He placed Song Ci down and opened the curtains. The bustling night scene slowly appeared under their feet.\n Han Zhan said beside her, \u201cBaby Ci, I will definitely play with you tonight till your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci\u2019s legs went weak...\n Song Ci looked at the gorgeous night lights and felt her heart heat up slightly. She couldn\u2019t help thinking of the first day when she followed Han Zhan home and stood by the French window, teasing him like an old driver.\n At that time, Song Ci was confident that Han Zhan wouldn\u2019t really touch her, but now that it was time for a real fight, Song Ci was terrified.\n \u201cScared?\u201d Han Zhan purposely asked.\n Agitated by Han Zhan, Song Ci suddenly turned rebellious and said fiercely, \u201cWhoever\u2019s afraid is a dog!\u201d\n ...\n After a long while, her passion gradually subsided. Every bone in Song Ci\u2019s body exuded a lazy, weak aura. Her head laid on Han Zhan\u2019s pillow, and her ears were slightly red under her short hair.\n Han Zhan brought a cup of warm water and coaxed Song Ci to drink it. He teased her. \u201cDoggy Ci, drink some water.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n \u201cBefore you sleep with me, I am your Baby Ci. After you sleep with me, I am your Doggy Ci. Brother Han, you are too realistic.\u201d Song Ci glared fiercely at Han Zhan, before opening her mouth to take a big sip of water.\n After crying and shouting, her sore throat was moistened by the warm water and she felt much better.\n Han Zhan chuckled.\n Song Ci felt that her lips were slightly dry. She pouted and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my lip mask?\u201d\n Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhich one is it?\u201d\n Song Ci said with her eyes closed, \u201cThe most intricate one. It\u2019s dark green.\u201d\n \u201cLet me take a look.\u201d Han Zhan put down the glass and went to Song Ci\u2019s dressing table. He searched in the drawer and found two dark green jars. He said, \u201cThere are two of them. They are both dark green in color.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cOne is eye cream and the other is a lip mask.\u201d\n Han Zhan took both of them over. Song Ci opened her eyes and pointed at one of them. Han Zhan handed that one to her, but Song Ci stuffed the lip mask back into Han Zhan\u2019s right hand. She said, \u201cHelp me apply it.\u201d\n Han Zhan took off his gloves and prosthetic fingers. He could only pinch the lip mask with his thumb and his remaining two fingers. He glanced at Song Ci and agreed. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci laid directly on Han Zhan\u2019s lap. Still not satisfied, she said, \u201cYour muscles are too hard. It would be better if they were softer.\u201d\n Han Zhan told her, \u201cMany men, who don\u2019t focus on physical fitness and exercise, will start to gain weight after 30 years old. Do you like those who are slightly fatter?\u201d\n Song Ci thought about how Han Zhan would look after gaining weight.\n He\u2019s already tall, and if he becomes fat...\n If he sits in the car, the tires would probably buckle and break. If he crushes her, she would probably die.\n Song Ci quickly shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s better if you\u2019re sturdier.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled.\n He carefully dabbed Song Ci\u2019s lips with the lip mask. Although it was the first time he did this, his movements were not clumsy. After that, Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s lashes. Her eyes were closed and her curly lashes cast a fan-shaped shadow under her eyes.\n Han Zhan\u2019s fingers brushed past Song Ci\u2019s lashes.\n Song Ci said, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault. There\u2019s so many things you can dislike, yet you hate long hair. If my long hair is still here, it would be so much more comfortable to touch.\u201d Song Ci felt very stifled at the mention of hair.\n ]Han Zhan also knew that he was in the wrong. He didn\u2019t quarrel with Song Ci and praised her genuinely. \u201cYou look good like this too.\u201d\n Song Ci snorted proudly and said, \u201cOf course. I am Song Ci. From high school onwards, I was the school belle. A few years ago, the university had voted for the most beautiful school belle. I was always at the top.\u201d\n Han Zhan pretended to be shocked. \u201cOh? So strong?\u201d\n \u201cYes, Brother Han, you should be laughing in your sleep at the thought of marrying such a beautiful and young girl like me.\u201d\n Han Zhan was amused by Song Ci. \u201cYes, I am a toad that has eaten swan meat.\u201d\n Although she knew that Han Zhan was just teasing her, Song Ci felt uncomfortable hearing him belittle himself.\n Song Ci suddenly opened her eyes and looked at Han Zhan seriously. She touched Han Zhan\u2019s face but said, \u201cI am the one who is below your league.\u201d Song Ci knew very well what she was worth. With Han Zhan\u2019s status and wealth, how could Song Ci be worthy of him?\n It was only after she was reborn and knew Han Zhan\u2019s true identity that she intentionally tried to get close to him, which allowed her to get him before others. If not for her rebirth, Song Ci and Han Zhan would forever be strangers.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Otherwise, I would really be useless.\u201d\n Han Zhan knew that he had underestimated Song Ci. He didn\u2019t need to worry too much about her. Song Ci had the most beautiful and graceful appearance, as well as a rock-solid heart. She was a real tough rose.\n Song Ci flipped over and laid on Han Zhan\u2019s lap. She narrowed her eyes. \u201cI am going to sleep.\u201d\n Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s short hair gently, and said in a hesitant and solemn manner, \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to talk to you about.\u201d\n Song Ci was really sleepy. Her tone became lazy, as she asked in a low voice, \u201cCan\u2019t we talk tomorrow?\u201d\n Han Zhan was certain again. \u201cI want to tell you now.\u201d\n \u201cTell me then, I will listen.\u201d Song Ci forced herself to perk up and waited for him to continue.\n After pondering for a moment, Han Zhan spoke again about the same old topic. \u201cI dated once before.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Song Ci couldn\u2019t even be bothered to open her eyes. She shut her eyes and interrupted Han Zhan in a low voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve already said this before and I don\u2019t mind it. Moreover, I\u2019m not such a petty person. I can\u2019t control your past relationships.\u201d\n It would be too boring if she had to dig into Han Zhan\u2019s past.\n Who hadn\u2019t had an ex before? Song Ci had been courted by countless people, and in comparison, Song Ci had much more romantic gossip than Han Zhan.\n However, Han Zhan wasn\u2019t as relaxed as Song Ci. He said hesitantly, \u201cYou also know my first love.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci finally opened her eyes and looked at Han Zhan in astonishment. \u201cI know her?\u201d Song Ci compared all the women she knew with Han Zhan in her mind, but realized that she and Han Zhan didn\u2019t have any mutual female friends.\n There is one...\n Mu Qiu.\n However, Mu Qiu was too young and didn\u2019t know Han Zhan in the past, so she could be ruled out. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Song Ci really couldn\u2019t figure it out.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t have the courage to say that person\u2019s name. He said in a roundabout manner, \u201cYou saw her today.\u201d\n Song Ci looked even more puzzled. \u201cWe met today?\u201d\n Song Ci slowly got up and sat down. She tilted her head to lean on Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder and said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019ve been with Mu Qiu the whole day today, and only accompanied her to meet Du Xueyan. After meeting Du Xueyan, I didn\u2019t see any other friends...\u201d\n Returning to the main topic. \u201cWho is that person?\u201d\n \u201cDu Xueyan.\u201d This was Han Zhan\u2019s answer.\n Song Ci sat up straight in shock, her eyes wide open.\n \u201cDu Xueyan?\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t believe it and felt uneasy for some reason.\n How complicated was that feeling? It was one thing to know that Han Zhan had an ex-girlfriend, but another thing to know that Han Zhan\u2019s ex-girlfriend was Du Xueyan. After all, she treated Du Xueyan as her idol.\n Song Ci felt like a fish bone was stuck in her throat at the thought that her husband\u2019s ex-girlfriend was the female celebrity whom she had liked for so many years.\n Her idol was no longer impressive.\n A deep, magnetic male voice sounded beside Song Ci\u2019s ear. \u201cDu Xueyan and I were high school classmates. We started dating in our third year of high school. We dated for five years. When I was 22 years old, I amputated my fingers and destroyed my future. Coincidentally, her career was on the rise and for the sake of her future, she took the initiative to break up with me.\u201d\n At the age of 32, Han Zhan was sufficiently calm, when talking about his love and abandonment from his youth. \u201cI did love her. She was also the woman I wanted to marry, but not every relationship has a perfect ending.\u201d\n \u201cAfter breaking up, I was also sad and resentful. But time soothed my unhappiness and also diluted my feelings for her.\u201d\n Han Zhan had been taught by Han Aoyu to be very conscientious and devoted from a young age. He had also truly loved Du Xueyan when he was younger, and dated her with the intention of marrying her. But they still parted ways in the end.\n Meanwhile, Han Zhan was also a proud and decisive person. His pride didn\u2019t allow him to miss a woman who had kicked him into hell when he was at his lowest.\n From the moment Du Xueyan broke up with her, all the sweet memories between them vanished like smoke into thin air.\n All these years, seeing the dazzling Du Xueyan on television, Han Zhan had never thought of rekindling their relationship. In this life, Du Xueyan would only be his \u2018ex-girlfriend\u2019, a \u2018woman who once truly loved\u2019.\n When they were in love, Du Xueyan was Han Zhan\u2019s beloved queen. After their breakup, eight years later, Du Xueyan was just Du Xueyan, the same as Liu Xueyan and Su Xueyan, nothing special at all.\n Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and turned to look at her with a solemn expression. \u201cBaby Ci, I\u2019m telling you all this not to show off or to hurt you. I just want to be honest with you about my past. I see that you really like Du Xueyan, so I felt that I can\u2019t hide this from you. I have to tell you in detail.\u201d\n Telling Song Ci about Du Xueyan was a decision that Han Zhan made after careful consideration. When Zeus Corporation was established in the future, Han Zhan would have to step up from being the boss behind the scenes. Once his identity is exposed, his relationship with Du Xueyan would most likely be dug out.\n At that time, if Song Ci were to hear about the past between him and Du Xueyan from someone else, it would be a form of deception to her. Han Zhan would never lie to his wife\u2014this was his honesty toward marriage.\n From the moment Song Ci heard the name Du Xueyan, she had remained silent. No one could tell what she was thinking. Seeing this, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy.\n Pinching Song Ci\u2019s finger, Han Zhan said, \u201cYou are very right about one thing.\u201d\n Song Ci finally glanced at him. She raised her brows and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Leaning over to press Song Ci\u2019s forehead, Han Zhan said, \u201cShe is just my past, and you are my future and home.\u201d This was what Song Ci had said to him personally on the first day that Han Zhan brought Song Ci home to live together.\n Han Zhan kissed Song Ci\u2019s forehead and said very seriously, \u201cBaby Ci, the men of the Han Family will never remarry. We take marriage as seriously as our lives. Don\u2019t worry, Du Xueyan is really just an ex-girlfriend.\u201d\n He only had one life and one marriage. If he married Song Ci, she would be Han Zhan\u2019s Mrs. Han for life. From the start, Han Zhan agreed to date Song Ci not because he wanted to make a deal with her.\n Song Ci had a beautiful face and an interesting soul. The first time they met, Song Ci\u2019s words left a deep impression on Han Zhan. In order to get close to him, Song Ci had purposely played tricks. How could Han Zhan not see through that? Even so, he just felt that this person was interesting.\n Song Ci was just like a little kitten, thinking that she could fight the entire world with just her claws and paws. Little did she know that in front of this tiger, Han Zhan, her bared teeth looked funny and adorable.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "104": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-105\n\n Chapter 104: Only Han Zhan  Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\n Hearing Han Zhan say this, Song Ci\u2019s messy thoughts finally cleared up.\n Du Xueyan was something that happened before Han Zhan got to know Song Ci. Although she felt slightly uncomfortable, she couldn\u2019t be too calculative. Moreover, she knew better than anyone how harsh and ruthless Han Zhan was. Du Xueyan broke up with him during his most despondent period means that she had completely cut off all possible ties with Han Zhan.\n Even if Du Xueyan has feelings for Han Zhan again in the future, Han Zhan would never accept her again. The Han Family\u2019s style and Han Zhan\u2019s pride would never allow him to be so cheap.\n A traitor was a traitor.\n Since Han Zhan was already so honest, Song Ci decided to be more straightforward. Rubbing her nose, Song Ci said hesitantly, \u201cI also have something that I haven\u2019t told you.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at her in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cActually, I married someone in my previous life.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Come on, let\u2019s hurt each other!\n Song Ci revealed the most embarrassing stain in her life and secretly glanced up at Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyelids drooped slightly, as he gazed at the pattern on the thin blanket. At first glance, he looked calm and composed, but in reality, a vicious rage had already gathered in Han Zhan\u2019s heart.\n Song Ci was now his wife, and he had purposely left loving traces all over her body. Thinking of how she had once belonged to another man in her previous life and was also deeply in love with another man, and how that man had also done whatever he wanted with Song Ci, Han Zhan felt slightly...\n He wanted to find that man and cut him to pieces!\n Han Zhan asked very calmly, \u201cIs that so? Who is that man?\u201d\n Song Ci was very embarrassed. She said very softly, \u201cCheng Ziang.\u201d\n Han Zhan knew this person\u2014the legendary Chuan Dong Second Young Master who had been wooing Song Ci for a long time. Although he was rich, he was good-for-nothing. The fact that Song Ci would marry Cheng Ziang was very strange.\n \u201cHow did you fall for that good...\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t say the word \u2018good-for-nothing\u2019 for fear of hurting Song Ci\u2019s pride. No matter how useless that person was, he was still Song Ci\u2019s ex-husband. Calling Cheng Ziang a good-for-nothing was the same as calling Song Ci blind.\n Knowing what Han Zhan had wanted to say, Song Ci kindly added. \u201cHe is a good-for-nothing.\u201d\n Covering her face, Song Ci felt ashamed. \u201cI didn\u2019t marry Cheng Ziang on my own accord. It was Mu Mian\u2019s idea. At that time, something happened to Chao Yang Company and there was a shortage of funds. Mu Mian wanted me to marry into the Cheng Family. I didn\u2019t know the reason behind Song Fei\u2019s death then and was determined to repay Mu Mian\u2019s kindness in raising me, so I agreed.\u201d\n \u201cBut after we got married...\u201d Song Ci felt like a joke talking about that ridiculous marriage.\u201d For some reason, Cheng Ziang was impotent and had a bad temper. A month after we got married, he abused me. I argued with him for six years and finally stabbed him in the gut. The marriage was finally over. \u201d\n After hearing this, Han Zhan felt that Song Ci was really pitiful in her previous life. Her elder sister was murdered by her adoptive father, her husband was a violent and incapable man, and she ended up being murdered by her adoptive father. She was simply the standard female character in romance dramas.\n Song Ci had such a pitiful previous life because she was too stupid.\n Having been reborn, Han Zhan didn\u2019t know if Song Ci had become smarter or not, but her eyesight had definitely improved. Finding him to be her backer was probably the smartest thing Song Ci had done in her lifetime.\n \u201cWhy did you stab Cheng Ziang? Are you trying to perish together with him?\u201d Han Zhan felt that something was off. If Song Ci was really so pitiful, she would have stabbed someone long ago instead of waiting six years later.\n There must be a reason for Song Ci to stab someone with a knife.\n Song Ci was shocked. She thought to herself that Han Zhan was indeed worthy of being called so sharp. Shaking her head, Song Ci said, \u201cIt\u2019s because I discovered that Cheng Ziang did something disgusting.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\n Frowning deeply, Song Ci couldn\u2019t conceal the disdain and contempt on her face. She said, \u201cCheng Ziang is very perverted and knows many perverts. Those people developed a website and specially uploaded private videos of minors to seek excitement. After I discovered it, I reported all of them.\u201d\n She felt good when she reported them, but she was cremated after that.\n \u201cCheng Ziang guessed that I was the one who reported him and knew that he would be found by the police very soon. He hated me and wanted to take revenge on me...\u201d As for how he took revenge, Song Ci didn\u2019t elaborate.\u201d Anyway, his revenge didn\u2019t succeed and Cheng Ziang was stabbed by me. \u201d\n Cheng Ziang was hospitalized due to an injury. After he recovered, he was sent to jail.\n Song Ci had caused Cheng Yanmo\u2019s only brother to be jailed, so she had thought that Cheng Yanmo would skin her alive. But under Mu Qiu\u2019s persuasion, Cheng Yanmo only let her sign a divorce agreement and returned her freedom.\n At that time, Song Ci was very grateful to Mu Qiu. Now that she thought about it, she finally understood Mu Qiu\u2019s intentions. Mu Qiu probably already knew that her heart was failing. She didn\u2019t want Song Ci to have her freedom; she was afraid that if Song Ci was killed by Cheng Yanmo\u2019s revenge, she would never have a heart left!\n After saying all this, Song Ci mocked herself in a self-deprecating manner. She said, \u201cBrother Han, my experience has been turned into a drama\u2014is it even more popular than \u2018The Mute Bride\u2019? The story is full of twists and turns, filled with schemes and plots. I\u2019ve even thought of a name\u2014\u2019The Life of Idiot Song\u2019.\u201d\n Having been fooled and manipulated all her life, she was truly foolish. Shaking Han Zhan\u2019s arm, Song Ci asked him, \u201cYou invest in it and I\u2019ll film it, alright?\u201d\n It seemed like she had a rather good mentality to be able to find joy amidst bitterness.\n Han Zhan spread out his fingers and pressed them against Song Ci\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d\n Song Ci took his hand away and tilted her head in exasperation. \u201cBrother Han, to be honest, my experience is even more embarrassing than yours. You were dumped by your first love but I married such a jerk...\u201d Song Ci was too embarrassed to continue, so she just kept quiet and fell asleep.\n Song Ci used the thin blanket to cover her head. Han Zhan laid down as well. He stared at Song Ci\u2019s short black hair that was exposed outside the blanket and suddenly said, \u201cSix years of marriage must have been very tough.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t hear Song Ci speak and thought she was asleep. He was about to turn off the lights and sleep, when he heard a sob.\n Han Zhan was slightly stunned. He looked closely and realized that the person hiding under the blanket was crying. Song Ci\u2019s body was trembling slightly and her sobs were very suppressed.\n Song Ci bit down hard on her lower lip. Tears streamed down her face and onto the pillow, but she was too embarrassed to make a sound. After she stabbed Cheng Ziang, some people called her stupid, some said she was stubborn, some said she was throwing an egg at a rock, and some even hoped that she would be sued by the Cheng Family.\n It would be such an explosive news if the once wealthy and famous were all jailed!\n Only Han Zhan asked her if she had it tough. Living with a man she didn\u2019t love, being abused by him\u2014she had to endure her fear every single time and fight back with her frail and delicate body. How could it not be tough?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

But no matter how strong she was, she was still a girl. Although men and women were equal, in terms of physical strength, girls were naturally not as strong as men.\n Cheng Ziang was a violent man. When he couldn\u2019t find anything, he would punch her and kick her with the tips of his leather shoes. Sometimes, he would pick up a vase and throw it at her without even batting an eyelid. In those few years, Song Ci\u2019s beautiful dresses always hid countless scars...\n It was a life worse than a dog\u2019s.\n Song Ci was pulled into Han Zhan\u2019s arms along with the thin blanket. Song Ci bit her red lips even harder. She heard Han Zhan comforting her from behind. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Baby Ci. You\u2019re very safe now.\u201d\n Han Zhan finally understood why the money collected from Song Ci\u2019s birthday charity banquet had all been donated to the Anti-Domestic Violence Group. As she had been harmed in the past, she hoped that those who were suffering would be able to walk out of the abyss of despair.\n Song Ci wiped her tears and secretly pulled down the blanket covering her head, revealing a pair of moist eyes. At this point, those lovely eyes were filled with tears, making her look even more pitiful.\n Song Ci gazed at Han Zhan, making his heart soften.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cMmm?\u201d Han Zhan tried his best to shift his gaze away from Song Ci\u2019s eyes so that he wouldn\u2019t have any inappropriate thoughts. If not, he would really be a beast.\n Song Ci said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to hit me. If you do, I\u2019ll ignore you forever.\u201d\n Han Zhan hugged her even tighter and promised. \u201cAlright, I definitely won\u2019t hit you.\u201d\n ...\n The next morning, Han Zhan woke up at the crack of dawn. Song Ci heard his movements and turned over, burying her face in her pillow and continuing to pretend to be asleep.\n \u201cNot getting up?\u201d Han Zhan knew that Song Ci was feeling shy.\n Song Ci replied in a muffled voice, \u201cEmbarrassed. I have no face to face my parents in Jiangdong.\u201d Having cried last night, Song Ci was too ashamed to face Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan smiled and stroked her hair, before going downstairs to the gym alone.\n A few days ago, when Han Zhanchen woke up for training, Song Ci would also wake up for morning exercises. When he was gymming, Song Ci would sit on the bifurcation and when Han Zhan successfully pulled himself up, Song Ci would lower her head and kiss his forehead.\n The two of them had massacred all the single dogs in the world when they gymed!\n Han Zhan had thought that he would receive the same benefits this morning and was looking forward to it.\n What a pity.\n Once Han Zhan left, Song Ci got up.\n After Han Zhan finished exercising, he walked out of the gym and heard Song Ci\u2019s lazy footsteps. He looked up and saw Song Ci stretching lazily as she went down the stairs.\n As she stretched her back, the hem of her loose blouse was lifted. It was truly a glorious sight.\n Han Zhan stood rooted to the ground and stared at the fair skin around Song Ci\u2019s waist. All sorts of strange thoughts flashed across his mind.\n Song Ci had no idea that Han Zhan was fantasizing about her again. She hummed a tune as she walked up to Han Zhan, gave him a flirtatious look, and said, \u201cMorning, brother.\u201d\n The way she addressed him was like a falling star, smashing into a patch of dry grassland. Nothing was left alive.\n After igniting the fire, Song Ci wanted to escape.\n However, Han Zhan grabbed her wrist, clutched her arm, and pressed her against the door of the gym. His actions were gentle, but Song Ci still howled.\n \u201cPain!\u201d\n Han Zhan released his grip, leaned over, and asked Song Ci, \u201cWho are you putting on such beautiful makeup for so early in the morning?\u201d Song Ci had put on makeup upstairs just now. It was a very light and elegant look, but she purposely made her seductive eyes look even more mesmerizing.\n Song Ci squinted at him. \u201cFor you to see.\u201d\n \u201cYou think I can\u2019t do anything to you?\u201d Han Zhan looked at his watch and suddenly said, \u201cAlthough there isn\u2019t enough time, I am the boss. It\u2019s okay even if I am late once.\u201d\n With that, he pulled open the door to the gym and tossed the bewildered Song Ci inside.\n Song Ci felt like she was walking into a wolf\u2019s den, when she was thrown into the gym. Only then did she realize that her flirtatious behavior just now had been slightly excessive.\n Han Zhan was a meticulous person. Nearly every location was equipped with items that were needed at critical moments.\n Seeing that Han Zhan reached out and retrieved a familiar package from the shelf, Song Ci questioned Han Zhan soulfully, \u201cAre you so afraid of me getting pregnant? Brother Han, am I not worthy of bearing your Han Family\u2019s child? Am I ugly? Or am I of a lowly background and bloodline?\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at the pretentious Song Ci and said emotionlessly, \u201cYou are an ingrate who has yet to mature. When you get your revenge and have a child, won\u2019t you just kick me away?\u201d\n Song Ci was even more aggrieved. \u201cBrother Han, so in your eyes, I am actually so heartless! I can only use death to prove my innocence!\u201d Song Ci made a throat-cutting gesture.\n Han Zhan\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cAre you done acting?\u201d\n Song Ci knew when to stop.\n Only then did Han Zhan say in all seriousness, \u201cI am a handicapped person. It wasn\u2019t easy for a good-looking and blind lady to marry me. If I don\u2019t watch you closely and let you escape, who will compensate me with a wife?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cBrother Han, I really won\u2019t leave you.\u201d\n As if Han Zhan would believe her.\n After that, both Song Ci and Han Zhan went to take a shower and changed into fresh clothes. Song Ci was sweating profusely and felt that her makeup was smudged, so she took off her makeup. After tidying up, the two of them made breakfast together.\n Song Ci\u2019s breakfast was very light. Her cod porridge was in a small bowl, while Han Zhan\u2019s porridge was in a big bowl. Song Ci stared at the bowl in front of Han Zhan and threatened him. \u201cBe careful, if you continue eating like this, you will become a fat, greasy uncle in another two years.\u201d\n Han Zhan replied, \u201cNo, I need to exert my strength often, so I won\u2019t get fat.\u201d\n Understanding Han Zhan\u2019s hint, the smart Song Ci chose to remain silent.\n After finishing the last mouthful of porridge, Han Zhan put down his spoon and asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat are you planning to do today?\u201d She had put on makeup early in the morning, so she was definitely going out.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI have to go out in the morning to attend to something. Oh yes, I have recovered and can start working now. I can go on a work trip anytime.\u201d\n Recalling the change in their current status, Han Zhan took a deep look at Song Ci and asked with interest, \u201cWhat identity do you wish to assume? Wife or subordinate?\u201d\n ]Sitting sideways, she stuck out her chest and looked up. Song Ci\u2019s seductive eyes swept across Han Zhan in a natural manner. As usual, her answer didn\u2019t disappoint Han Zhan. Song Ci said, \u201cDuring working hours, I am your most loyal pilot. For the rest of the time, I will be whatever you want me to be.\u201d\n Blinking her eyes, Song Ci continued. \u201cDear, I can switch to any design that you want.\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows calmly and stared at the coquettish Song Ci. His tone was complex. \u201cYou are so unrestrained.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s brows twitched.\n Will I go to jail for abusing my husband?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

His joy was easily detected by Li Li. Li Li entered Han Zhan\u2019s office, and stared at Han Zhan\u2019s face carefully with his bright eyes.\n Han Zhan allowed the other party to size him up. After a moment, he asked, \u201cHave you seen enough? If you have, scram back to earn money for me.\u201d\n Li Li coughed and tapped his own earlobe with his index finger.\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Li Li said, \u201cIt has a lipstick mark.\u201d\n Mmm?\n Han Zhan took up his cell phone and used his black screen to reflect his image...\n There was nothing. Han Zhan glanced at Li Li mildly. \u201cIs it very interesting to tease me?\u201d\n Li Li clicked his tongue, shook his head, and sighed. \u201cYou were almost an hour late today. Is there a vixen at home keeping you from going to work?\u201d\n Han Zhan warned him. \u201cWhat vixen? It\u2019s your sister-in-law.\u201d\n Li Li suppressed his laughter and corrected herself. \u201cYes, yes, sister-in-law.\u201d\n Li Li was shocked as he gazed at the loving and blissful Han Zhan. In the past, he had always been worried that Han Zhan would remain single forever. Unexpectedly, he was a man who did great things in secret, as he fell in love and got married at will.\n It looked like a blissful marriage.\n He also felt like getting married.\n Han Zhan turned on his laptop and looked up to see Li Li still standing in front of his desk. He raised his brows and asked, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a banquet tonight. Can you attend it for me?\u201d This was Li Li\u2019s real motive.\n Han Zhan immediately shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\n \u201cI know you don\u2019t wish to attend such an event, but this company is yours to begin with. All the money earned will go to your pockets. I, Li Li, am a hardworking employee. It is your responsibility to attend such an important banquet.\u201d\n Li Li complained bitterly as he peeked at Han Zhan\u2019s reaction. However, Han Zhan maintained his cold but good-looking face and quietly watched Li Li act.\n Li Li realized that Han Zhan\u2019s heart was as hard as steel, and he had completely given up all hope. Li Li stopped acting and his expression changed. He said coldly, \u201cI have something on tonight and can\u2019t go.\u201d\n Seeing that Li Li had finished acting and was willing to speak normally, Han Zhan asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Li Li said, \u201cI have to take care of my mother.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Han Zhan immediately saw through Li Li\u2019s lie. \u201cDo you think I didn\u2019t know that you hired a nurse for Auntie? I\u2019ve never seen you so filial normally. Tell me, what shameful things do you have to do?\u201d\n It better not be committing murder, arson, or visitng a prostitute.\n Li Li\u2019s expression was slightly unnatural. He glanced outside the office and saw that everyone was focused on their work. Only then did he lean over to Han Zhan\u2019s ear and said, \u201cI have an appointment. I\u2019m going to meet someone.\u201d\n Han Zhan gave him a meaningful look. \u201cMatchmaking?\u201d\n Li Li actually felt slightly embarrassed. He said in a low voice, \u201cNo, I met an online lover.\u201d\n \u201cAn online lover?\u201d A hint of surprise crept onto Han Zhan\u2019s face. He looked at Li Li disapprovingly for a while, and couldn\u2019t help but knock Li Li on the head. \u201cLi Li, you\u2019re already 29 years old, not a 9 year old kid or a 19 year old blockhead. You\u2019re having an online romance at your age?\u201d\n To Han Zhan, only children would meet online friends. He remembered that a few years ago, Han Wangwang had bought a plane ticket to a faraway place to meet her online friends. But before she could meet them, her father had caught her and beat her up.\n It was a pity that Li Li was already an adult and his mother was bedridden. There was no way they could beat him up.\n Li Li rubbed his earlobes and retorted angrily. \u201cSo what if I met an online friend? Let me tell you, that the online friend of mine is very cute. I like cute girls the most. In today\u2019s society, women are all manly men who can hold a bottle of water with one shoulder. Adorable girls are very rare.\u201d\n Han Zhan smirked and gave him his blessings. \u201cI wish you success in your online romance and your online friend would be a 200 pound fatty.\u201d\n Li Li stomped his feet and turned to leave.\n ...\n Song Ci indeed had something to attend to today. Han Zhan had just left for work, when Song Ci left the house with her bag. She was going to meet Song Fei in the morning and an important person in the afternoon.\n Yan Jiang had been working over the past few days to film Du Xueyan\u2019s music video. Knowing that Song Ci was going to his house, he had specially set up a one-time password for the door lock. The two of them had just quarreled two days ago and were too embarrassed to face each other.\n Song Ci arrived at the Yan Jiang Residence alone and gave Song Fei a full-body massage. She then retrieved the book titled \u201cWar and Peace\u201d from the shelves along the corridor.\n Song Fei loved to read books in the past. The books she read were all unpopular and specific. \u201cWar and Peace\u201d was Song Fei\u2019s favorite novel. Song Ci had read this book to her when she visited her previously.\n Sitting cross-legged on the windowsill, Song Ci flipped directly to the page with the bookmark between her fingers and read softly. A light breeze blew in from the window and Song Ci\u2019s short hair swayed in the wind. On the bed, Song Fei\u2019s fringe also swayed along with the wind.\n As Song Ci read, Song Fei slept peacefully.\n \u201c...Everyone has their flaws, just like an apple that has been bitten by God. Some people have bigger flaws, and it is precisely because God especially likes his fragrance...\u201d Saying this, Song Ci suddenly closed her book, got up, and walked over to Song Fei\u2019s bed.\n Song Ci bent down, hugged Song Fei\u2019s frail shoulders, and rubbed her face lovingly. \u201cBig sister, God must be jealous of you for being too smart and outstanding, so he punished you to sleep a little longer. Will God let you wake up after you\u2019ve slept long enough?\u201d\n Staring at Song Fei\u2019s sleeping form, Song Ci desperately hoped that those tightly shut eyes would suddenly open; then, like in the past, Song Fei would lift her right hand and stroke Song Ci\u2019s hair in a boorish but not rough manner. Song Ci looked down on her coldly. \u201cLittle fool, you\u2019re already silly enough, but you still cry so much. So ugly.\u201d\n But Song Fei didn\u2019t do as she wished. She just slept peacefully, unable to hear Song Ci\u2019s voice or feel the heat of her tears.\n \u201cAre you refusing to wake up because Dad and Mum are gone and this world is boring to you?\u201d Song Ci wiped her tears and leaned over to kiss Song Fei\u2019s hair. She sobbed. \u201cBut Song Fei, if you don\u2019t want Song Ci anymore, she will really become an orphan.\u201d\n Actually, Song Ci knew very well that the chances of Song Fei waking up were very slim. Perhaps she would continue to sleep like this for the rest of her life until her energy was completely depleted, until she was as thin as a skeleton and take her last breath.\n But Song Ci would never give up on Song Fei until that day came!\n She grabbed Song Fei\u2019s hand tightly and said, \u201cSong Fei, you must wake up. Even if you don\u2019t do it for me, you must think of Ah Jiang. That fool really likes you...\u201d\n As she still had something on, she chatted with Song Fei for another half an hour before leaving.\n ...\n Long Yu had been waiting downstairs. Seeing Song Ci come out, he hurriedly opened the car door. Song Ci sat down and said to Long Yu, \u201cBrother Long, send me to see Su Beibei.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Madam.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "107": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-108\n\n Chapter 107: Su Beibei  The car followed the navigation instructions for nearly 40 minutes, before finally stopping in front of a gothic cafe.\n Song Ci sat in the car and sized up the cafe in front of her.\n Long Yu told Song Ci, \u201cAccording to Madam\u2019s information, I found out that Su Beibei, Su Buwang\u2019s deceased daughter, is currently a mystery fiction writer. She owns a cafe, which is this one and she usually lives here.\u201d\n Long Yu stared at the main door of the cafe and turned to ask Song Ci, \u201cDo you need me to go in with you?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cFollow me in and order a cup of coffee. I have something to discuss with Su Bei Bei.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Long Yu and Song Ci entered the cafe together.\n Business at the cafe was very good. Most of the customers were youngsters. Song Ci glanced at the customers in the main hall, before turning to look behind the bar counter. There was a woman in a long black dress standing there with her back facing Song Ci. She was reading a book with her head lowered.\n Song Ci asked the lady, \u201cHi, is your manager here?\u201d\n The lady was flipping through a book. Hearing this, she paused.\n She slowly put down the bookmark and closed the book. The lady turned around and said, \u201cI am.\u201d Only after she answered, did she look up. Upon seeing Song Ci\u2019s face, she was stunned.\n She recognized Song Ci.\n \u201cSong Ci?\u201d Staring at Song Ci, Su Beibei asked in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for me?\u201d I have never seen Song Ci before. What is she doing here?\n Song Ci was slightly shocked. \u201cYou are Ms. Su?\u201d\n Long Yu had shown Song Ci Su Beibei\u2019s information. Su Beibei was only 9 years old then. The little girl in the photo was a little cutie in a pink babydoll dress. And the person in front of her...\n The woman was tall and wore a black off-shoulder dress with a black collar around her neck. She had long, straight black hair with a princess-style fringe. Her face was covered in gothic makeup and she exuded a dark aura.\n \u201cI\u2019m Su Beibei.\u201d Su Beibei found it ridiculous. \u201cYou asked to meet me by name, yet you don\u2019t know me?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t answer directly, \u201d You changed too much and I couldn\u2019t guess your identity.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Su Beibei raised her brows slightly but didn\u2019t ask where the change came from.\n Song Ci looked around and felt that the first level was not a good place to talk. She asked Su Beibei, \u201cMiss Su, can we talk somewhere more private?\u201d\n Su Beibei thought for a moment, before looking up at a waiter with a braid. \u201cAh Kun, help me look after the shop. I have something on.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, Manager.\u201d\n Su Beibei walked out from behind the counter. As she got closer, Song Ci realized that she was slightly taller than her.\n She was such a mature lady.\n \u201cCome upstairs with me.\u201d With that, Su Beibei took a few steps ahead of Song Ci and walked towards the corridor entrance. Song Ci followed. She stared at Su Beibei\u2019s back view, as many images flashed across her mind.\n In her previous life, Song Ci had met Su Beibei. At that time, Su Bei was almost 30 years old and her dressing style was very different from now. The first time Song Ci met Su Beibei, she was wearing jeans and a blue blouse. She was a tall, elegant beauty.\n Su Beibei had come bearing a grudge, but was nearly murdered by Mu Mian. If not for Song Ci\u2019s kindness in sending Su Beibei away secretly, she might have died.\n Recalling the past, Song Ci suddenly snapped out of her trance and was standing in Su Beibei\u2019s open study on the second floor.\n Su Beibei\u2019s study is separated from the living room by a glass wall. The study was filled with books related to detective mystery novels and authoritative magazines. On the study table was a black laptop. Su Beibei stood in front of the desk, her head lowered as if she was looking for something.\n Song Ci stood to the side and looked down to see that Su Beibei was opening up a pack of Saleem brand ladies\u2019 cigarettes. This cigarette had a pungent flavor and was rather vigorous to smoke. It was different from ordinary ladies\u2019 cigarettes.\n Su Beibei took out a white cigarette from the pack. She used her long index and middle fingers to press the filter and brought it to her lips. She lit the cigarette like an old smoker, and took a drag before puffing out the smoke.\n After a mouthful, Su Beibei nodded at Song Ci. \u201cSit.\u201d\n Song Ci sat down on the black leather sofa behind her. She quietly waited for the cigarette to be halfway finished. Song Ci cleared her throat and said, \u201cMiss Su, I\u2019ve read your novel \u2018The Female Souls of the Golden Street\u2019. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n \u201cThe Female Souls of the Golden Street\u201d was published by Su Beibei four years ago and was her famous work. She was only 19 years old then.\n \u201cThe Female Soul of the Golden Street\u201d was about a beautiful but powerless woman, who risked everything, including her wealth, to pursue romance and a man. However, she was deceived by the man and then killed by him.\n The storyline was very clich\u00e9, but Su Beibei\u2019s writing was sharp. The entire story was very attractive.\n Su Beibei glanced sideways at Song Ci and said mildly, \u201cAn early creation isn\u2019t worth mentioning.\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cBut I feel that that book is different.\u201d\n \u201cHow is it different?\u201d Su Beibei said nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s just an ordinary suspense story. The plot lacks novelty and the ending is not exciting enough. Compared to the later works, it\u2019s not worth flaunting.\u201d\n But Song Ci said, \u201cBut I can only read hatred, fear and resentment in \u2018The Female Spirits of the Golden Street\u2019. This is something that can\u2019t be found in Miss Su\u2019s later works.\u201d Glancing at Su Beibei, Song Ci said meaningfully, \u201cThere must be an interesting story behind the book that prompted Miss Su to create \u2018The Female Spirits of the Golden Street\u2019. I wonder if I guessed it correctly?\u201d\n Su Beibei\u2019s face was hidden by the faint smoke and her expression was indecipherable. After a moment of silence, Su Bei finally spoke. She said, \u201cThere\u2019s no story behind it. It\u2019s just a work of imagination.\u201d\n Seeing that Su Beibei was unmoved, Song Ci finally made a move. She reached into her shoulder bag and took out a photo.\n Su Beibei glanced at her actions, her gaze still cold.\n \u201cI wonder if Miss Su knows this woman in my photo?\u201d Under Su Beibei\u2019s cold stare, Song Ci flipped the photo over. A beautiful, pitiful face barged into Su Bei\u2019s eyes.\n Su Beibei\u2019s pupils quivered slightly at the sight of the woman in the photo. The cigarette had somehow finished burning and had even reached Su Beibei\u2019s fingers. Her fingers were burned, so Su Beibei suddenly looked down to extinguish the cigarette.\n Song Ci said in a low voice, \u201cThe woman in the photo is called Xu Xiangxiang. She died in the autumn of 2005. Miss Su, the female lead in your \u2018The Female Spirits of the Golden Street\u2019, Shu Xiangsi, was created based on Xu Xiangxiang, right?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "108": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-109\n\n Chapter 108: Just a Face of a Human, But Heart of an Animal  Su Beibei looked down, her hand held the filter of her cigarette and her eyes unfathomable.\n Song Ci stood up and walked towards Su Beibei. She questioned her. \u201cMiss Su, why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d\n Su Beibei lifted her head and stared straight at Song Ci. She asked in an unfriendly tone, \u201cWhat are you doing, Miss Song? Are you treating me as a murderer? Xu Xiangxiang...\u201d For Song Ci to take out this photo and directly ask if she knew Xu Xiangxiang, it meant that she did know something.\n Su Beibei said half-jokingly, \u201cI was only 9 years old when Xu Xiangxiang died. I was just a little girl. Could I have killed her?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cOf course you won\u2019t kill her.\u201d Su Bei was about to say something when Song Ci said, \u201cBut you know why she was killed.\u201d\n Su Beibei\u2019s eyes twinkled.\n Song Ci had already walked up to Su Beibei. As she stared at the purposely calm face in front of her, Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear it. She paused and said, \u201cMs. Su was indeed still young then, but your parents were already adults. They witnessed the truth behind Xu Xiangxiang\u2019s death and were remembered for that. In the end, both husband and wife were murdered by that person...\u201d\n \u201cIn this world, other than the murderer, only Miss Su knows the real reason behind Xu Xiang\u2019s death. Only you know the real reason behind Su Buwang and his wife\u2019s death. Miss Su, am I right?\u201d\n Su Beibei closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She opened her eyes and gazed at that beautiful face. Su Beibei asked Song Ci, \u201cHow... how did you know?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cMiss Su, you don\u2019t need to know why I know all this. You just need to know that we have a common enemy. I can help you take revenge for your parents.\u201d\n Su Beibei didn\u2019t trust Song Ci easily. She took another cigarette, put it in her mouth, and quickly lit it.\n Taking a drag of her cigarette, Su Beibei glanced up at Song Ci and pretended not to know anything. She asked, \u201cWho is this \u2018he\u2019 you\u2019re talking about?\u201d Worried that Song Ci was setting a trap for herself, Su Beibei wouldn\u2019t easily believe her if she didn\u2019t hear that person\u2019s name from her.\n Song Ci\u2019s red lips moved and she spat out that person\u2019s name. \u201cMu Mian.\u201d\n Upon hearing the name Mu Mian, Su Beibei\u2019s clear eyes narrowed. She pinched the cigarette between her fingers, placed it on the edge of the study table, and tapped the cigarette with her index finger.\n Wisps of smoke landed on her dress.\n Su Beibei said, \u201cYou are his adopted daughter.\u201d Suspecting that Song Ci was trying to dig a hole for her, Su Beibei sneered. \u201cYou have been receiving the Mu Family\u2019s kindness and care, since you were 14 years old. What makes you think I will believe that you will sincerely work with me to deal with him?\u201d\n \u201cHow would I know if you want to work with me or with Mu Mian? Are you just trying to get information out of me?\u201d With that, Su Beibei bit her cigarette again.\n Song Ci knew that Su Beibei was not so easily convinced.\n Song Ci stood beside Su Bei and copied her, leaning against the study table.\n Song Ci pointed at the scars on her left arm. Noticing Song Ci\u2019s action, Su Beibei also stared at those pale pink scars. She frowned, not understanding what Song Ci was hinting at.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI got into an accident in August. You might know about this.\u201d\n Su Beibei had been keeping an eye on Mu Mian\u2019s movements, so she naturally knew that his adopted daughter \u2013 Song Ci \u2013 had escaped from an accident. Nodding, Su Beibei couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWas the accident not a true accident?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cMu Qiu.\u201d Song Ci turned to look at Su Beibei and said, \u201cYou should know of Mu Qiu too, right?\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d Su Beibei said, \u201cYour younger sister, Mu Mian\u2019s biological daughter.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Song Ci told Su Beibei, \u201cMu Qiu was hospitalized for a period of time after a heart attack. The doctor said that Mu Qiu needs a heart transplant or she will die very soon, but Mu Qiu has a rare blood type.\u201d\n It was not easy to get a heart with panda blood type. Upon hearing this, Su Beibei couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cMu Mian has committed so many evil deeds. Retribution has finally come.\u201d Retribution didn\u2019t fall on Mu Mian, but to his only daughter. Isn\u2019t this just funny?\n However, Su Beibei heard Song Ci say, \u201cCoincidentally, I happen to have panda\u2019s blood type, and my genetic antibody is coincidentally compatible with Mu Qiu\u2019s.\u201d\n Su Beibei\u2019s smile faded.\n Shocked, she turned and saw Song Ci\u2019s beautiful face filled with mockery. Su Beibei gasped and said in surprise, \u201cMu Mian was behind that accident?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cIn order to cover up the fact that he committed a crime, he dared to kill your parents. For the sake of his only daughter\u2019s life, he can also kill me. An adopted daughter is different from a biological daughter.\u201d\n But in her previous life, she only knew that Mu Mian was such a ruthless person at the brink of death.\n She was blind.\n Su Beibei also approved of Song Ci\u2019s evaluation of Mu Mian in her heart. No one knew better than Su Beibei just how vicious Mu Mian was. More than 10 years ago, Mu Mian had already committed the crime of forcing his fianc\u00e9e to death and murdering his partner. 10 years later, why can\u2019t he kill his adopted daughter to save his biological one?\n He just had a face of a human, but a heart of an animal.\n \u201cYou want to work with me,\u201d Su Beibei said firmly.\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n \u201cHow?\u201d\n Song Ci leaned close to Su Beibei. She tilted her head and whispered into her ear. \u201cMu Mian has a secret place. I don\u2019t know where that place is, but there must be a place like that.\u201d\n Su Beibei was shocked. \u201cYou think he would hide all that unfavorable evidence?\u201d Su Beibei had always thought that Mu Mian had destroyed all traces of his crimes. From what Song Ci said, Mu Mian seemed to have hidden all those evidence.\n Su Beibei said, \u201cI feel that the evidence will only be completely destroyed. That will be the most beneficial for the criminal.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s lips curled into a cold smile.\n \u201cIt may be so for others, but for Mu Mian, it\u2019s the exact opposite. Mu Mian was born into a poor family. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to rise to this position step by step. At the same time, he is also a very conceited person. Not only is he not afraid or guilty of the crimes he committed back then, he is also very proud of them. He has a strange fetish. He likes to gather evidence of his crimes, hide them, and admire them alone.\u201d\n Song Ci originally had no idea of this either. But in her previous life, Su Beibei had really found the place where Mu Mian hid the evidence and even stole the evidence that was enough to sentence him to death.\n Precisely because Mu Mian discovered that the evidence had been stolen, he quickly found out about Su Beibei\u2019s existence and wanted to kill her.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "109": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-110\n\n Chapter 109: Brother Han has a Family Member  Song Ci had inadvertently found out about this. At that time, she had been shocked by the fact that her father had killed someone, but she also didn\u2019t want him to commit another crime. As a result, she had secretly saved Su Beibei, who had nearly been poisoned to death by Mu Mian, when he wasn\u2019t looking.\n As a result, Song Ci was certain that Mu Mian hid his evidence somewhere!\n After hearing Song Ci\u2019s analysis, Su Beibei also felt that it made sense. \u201cI will go and look for it. If there is such a thing, I will inform you. If not, I will think of another way.\u201d She also finished her cigarette.\n Su Beibei wrapped the cigarette in a wet tissue and tossed it into the dustbin.\n Song Ci noticed her actions and couldn\u2019t help glancing at the wet tissues in the dustbin.\n Noticing Song Ci\u2019s gaze, Su Beibei suddenly said, \u201cWhen I was young, my rubbish bin caught fire for no reason and my family of three was nearly burned to death. From then on, I didn\u2019t dare to throw away any fire seeds.\u201d\n As Song Ci was smart, she could tell what she meant. \u201cWas that fire an accident or...\u201d\n Su Beibei smiled bitterly. \u201cThere is always a way for a person to make you die.\u201d Since setting fire didn\u2019t work, he would create a car accident. Humans only had one life, but there were countless ways to take it away.\n Song Ci was shocked.\n She couldn\u2019t help thinking of herself. She was so much like Su Beibei when she was young. She had survived the accident the other time, but Mu Mian wasn\u2019t someone who would give up so easily. He must have other tricks up his sleeve!\n Just then, Song Ci\u2019s cell phone suddenly rang. It was a message from WeChat.\n Song Ci took out her cell phone and glanced at it. After that, she smiled apologetically at Su Bei. \u201cI have something on, so I will take my leave first.\u201d\n Su Beibei also said, \u201cWhat a coincidence. I have something on too.\u201d\n \u201cIn that case, I look forward to our next meeting.\u201d\n \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n After Song Ci left, Su Beibei\u2019s WeChat suddenly rang. She opened it and saw that her online romance partner with the name \u2018Ah Li\u2019 had sent her a message. [Beibei, I got off work, and I\u2019m driving over to find you.]\n Today was the day that she had agreed to meet her online romance partner in real life.\n The person who had suggested meeting in real life was Ah Li. Su Beibei was very worried that Ah Li was still underage. Which adult would be interested in online romance and do such a thing?\n However, after Ah Li repeatedly stated that he was an adult, Su Beibei finally agreed to meet him offline. Knowing that they were in the same city, Su Beibei couldn\u2019t help feeling curious about Ah Li.\n She didn\u2019t know if this Ah Li was a handsome or ugly guy. As she gathered her thoughts, Su Beibei looked down at Ah Li\u2019s message. She thought for a moment and couldn\u2019t resist asking again [Are you really an adult?]\n Ah Li: [Almost 29 years old.]\n Su Beibei: [Don\u2019t lie to me. I won\u2019t sleep with a minor.]\n Noticing that Ah Li had stopped replying, Su Beibei packed up her things, grabbed her car keys, and prepared to leave.\n Li Li and Han Zhan arrived at the basement together. Standing beside the car, Han Zhan called out to Li Li, who was on the other side, and asked hesitantly, \u201cAre you really going to meet your online friend?\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s heart warmed at the thought of his online girlfriend, Beibei. \u201cMmm, yeah. Actually, she is not only my online girlfriend, she is also my favorite mystery novel author. We have known each other for two to three years.\u201d\n Han Zhan had wanted to advise Li Li not to meet his online friend. After all, online romance was risky and he needed to be cautious. Upon hearing Li Li say that the other party was a writer he liked, Han Zhan stopped this thought. If the other party was a writer, she probably wasn\u2019t a liar.\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d Han Zhan got into the backseat and the driver started the car.\n Only after seeing Han Zhan\u2019s car drive off did Li Li get into the driver\u2019s seat. After putting on his seatbelt, he was in no hurry to drive. Instead, he unhurriedly opened his cell phone and checked Beibei\u2019s reply.\n Li Li was stunned when he saw his girlfriend Beibei\u2019s reply: \u2018I\u2019 m not sleeping with a minor.\u2019\n I-is she going to sleep with me?\n Coming back to his senses, Li Li couldn\u2019t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. He had the feeling that he wasn\u2019t going to meet his female online friend but to send himself away.\n Downstairs, Song Ci called Long Yu, who was sitting under the air-conditioning, and left the cafe.\n After getting into the car, Song Ci hurriedly took out her cell phone to call Han Zhan. Just now, Han Zhan had texted her to ask if she had a gown. She didn\u2019t know why Han Zhan was asking about this\u2014she had to get to the bottom of it.\n Song Ci called Han Zhan. At that moment, Han Zhan crossed his legs and was looking down at the contract on his lap.\n The cell phone in his trouser pocket vibrated. Han Zhan felt it and took out his cell phone. Upon seeing the name \u201cBaby Ci\u201d, Han Zhan\u2019s eyes instantly turned gentle. Closing the document, Han Zhan accepted the call and placed the phone beside his ear. His voice subconsciously became gentler. \u201cBaby Ci.\u201d\n In front, the driver couldn\u2019t help pouting when he heard this affectionate greeting.\n My teeth hurt.\n Song Ci\u2019s alluring voice could be heard. \u201cBrother Han, you asked me if I have a gown. Are we going to attend a banquet?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a banquet, but a birthday party. Today is Old Madam Cheng\u2019s 80th birthday party. Li Li should be attending today\u2019s party, but he has something on at the last minute, so I have to go.\u201d After a pause, Han Zhan added, \u201cI already have a family, so of course I have to bring a family member.\u201d\n This was a very intriguing feeling. In the past, when he attended parties and saw others dragging their family members, Han Zhan only felt that they were boring and thought to himself that he would definitely separate work from his family in the future. But now...\n Ouch. My face hurts.\n Upon hearing it, Song Ci smiled. \u201cSure, this is your first time bringing me to a party.\u201d Thinking of something, Song Ci asked, \u201cWhich Cheng Family is Old Madam Cheng from?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cCheng Ziang\u2019s grandmother.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s smile instantly dimmed.\n Thinking that she might meet the jerk Cheng Ziang tonight, Song Ci\u2019s good mood was greatly ruined. \u201cOh right. I heard that the Cheng Family\u2019s Old Madam is holding a big party for her 80th birthday this year. Looks like it\u2019s true.\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Do you have a gown?\u201d\n Song Ci answered, \u201cI do have a gown, but it\u2019s at the Mu Family residence.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t keep those anymore. We will go and choose new ones again. I will send you the address and you can get Long Yu to send you to meet me.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After hanging up, Song Ci opened her WeChat and received Han Zhan\u2019s location. She opened her cell phone\u2019s location and turned up the volume of her voice message. \u201cSend me to this shop, Brother Long.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n By the time Song Ci and Long Yu arrived at the dress shop, it was already dusk. The sun was setting in the west and could fall into the darkness at any time.\n The clothing store was on the second floor, and Han Zhan was standing by the French window on the second floor, watching the sunset. From the corner of his eye, he saw a car coming downstairs. Han Zhan looked down and saw Song Ci bending over to alight from the car.\n She was wearing a pink and purple waist-length dress with golden high heels. Her waist was slender and sexy.\n Her short hair swayed in the wind and landed on her pink lips. Song Ci brushed her black hair away and looked up to see Han Zhan standing by the window on the second floor.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "110": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-111\n\n Chapter 110: Evil Rich Bitch  Song Ci smiled and gave Han Zhan a flying kiss with passion and vigor.\n Han Zhan was momentarily stunned, before a smile spread across his face.\n \u201cCome up,\u201d he mouthed.\n Song Ci understood him. She twirled the hair by her ear pretentiously, before striding into the building. Seeing Song Ci enter the building, Han Zhan turned around, walked up to the row of manequinns standing by the wall behind him, and chose tonight\u2019s suit.\n At this moment, a mature male voice with a hint of amusement sounded beside Han Zhan. \u201cZhanzhan.\u201d\n Hearing this voice, Han Zhan hurriedly looked up.\n Standing in front of Han Zhan was a man who looked to be in his thirties. He was wearing a dark green suit and had exquisitely styled hair that appeared slightly exaggerated. His wheat-colored skin made him look healthy and sexy.\n But in reality, he was already over 40 years old.\n The man was holding a white coffee cup in each hand. Seeing Han Zhan look over, he raised his right hand and smiled. \u201cI made you a cup of green tea according to your preferences.\u201d\n The cold expression on Han Zhan\u2019s face was gradually replaced by intimacy. He took the green tea and sipped it before saying, \u201cUncle Li\u2019s green tea is delicious.\u201d\n Li Yao replied in a mocking tone, \u201cOnly a good green tea bitch can brew high-grade green tea.\u201d\n Han Zhan could hear the hidden anger in Li Yao\u2019s words. He remained silent obediently. No matter what he said, he would be inviting trouble.\n Li Yao stirred the coffee in his hand and said mockingly, \u201cJust because a business partner sent me a flirtatious message, your godmother called me a green tea bitch. Hah...\u201d\n After taking a sip of coffee, Li Yao said mockingly, \u201cI am a green tea bitch, but what kind of bitch is she?\u201d With a pause, Li Yao\u2019s eyes turned slightly cold. \u201cEvil, rich bitch!\u201d\n Han Zhan remained silent.\n Han Zhan\u2019s godmother was called Mo Yao. She was Li Yao\u2019s lover.\n All these years, the two of them had led a lively life. The combination of Li Yao and Mo Yao was very much like \u201cThe Spy couple\u201d starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pit. One second they might still be flirting with each other, the next they would be holding knives at each other\u2019s necks.\n Knowing that Li Yao would definitely be enraged if he allowed Li Yao to continue, Han Zhan hurriedly changed the topic. \u201cWhen did Uncle Li come to Wangdong City? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n Li Yao had indeed forgotten about this. He said, \u201cI just arrived this afternoon and haven\u2019t been to this shop for a long time, so I came over to take a look.\u201d Actually, seeing the shop was fake and wanting to meet Han Zhan was real.\n Li Yao sized Han Zhan up from head to toe. In the end, his gaze landed on the ring finger of Han Zhan\u2019s left hand. \u201cYou\u2019re really married?\u201d Although the design of the gold ring on Han Zhan\u2019s left ring finger was simple, it was obviously a wedding ring.\n Li Yao had just heard about Han Zhan and Song Ci\u2019s marriage yesterday. He was very shocked and couldn\u2019t wait to fly over to Wangdong City to find out more.\n Although Song Ci was the top socialite in Wangdong City, as an internationally-renowned fashion designer, Li Yao didn\u2019t know her.\n He knew that Han Zhan got married through Jin Luolan. Jin Luolan was Han Zhan\u2019s other godmother and an internationally famous Chinese diplomat. However, she was still a loyal fan of Yan Jiang.\n Jin Luolan frequently paid attention to Yan Jiang, and naturally knew that Yan Jiang had a female friend called Song Ci. One night, Jin Luolan was bored out of her wits and found out that Song Ci was married. Jin Luolan went to Wangdong City\u2019s forum to see the post about Song Ci\u2019s marriage, but saw her godson Han Zhan!\n Jin Luolan was certainly dumbstruck.\n Knowing that Han Zhan and Song Ci were married, Jin Luolan told Li Yao immediately. Coincidentally, her lover, Mo Yao, was away on a work trip and Li Yao had nothing to do at home, so he flew over to Wangdong City to see what exactly was going on with Han Zhan.\n Li Yao was still very shocked to see Han Zhan\u2019s wedding ring.\n Why did he suddenly get married?\n Han Zhan was about to tell Li Yao that he was already married when he suddenly heard footsteps outside the door. Li Yao also heard it and raised his brows at Han Zhan. Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help but smile and said, \u201cUncle Li, my lover is here.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned around and met Song Ci\u2019s eyes.\n \u201cBaby Ci, come here.\u201d Han Zhan stretched out his left hand to Song Ci.\n Upon hearing the words \u201cBaby Ci\u201d, Li Yao shot Song Ci a meaningful look. Song Ci was wearing a pinkish-purple dress that accentuated her snow-like skin and her lovely eyes were filled with passion. She was indeed a wonderful person standing beside Han Zhan.\n \u201cUncle Li, this is my lover, Song Ci.\u201d\n As soon as Song Ci saw Li Yao, she felt that he was somewhat familiar but couldn\u2019t remember where she had seen him before. Han Zhan introduced Li Yao to her and said, \u201cBaby Ci, this is my Uncle Li, a fashion designer.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up.\n Li Yao!\n She finally remembered where she had seen Li Yao before. He had appeared on countless magazines and fashion websites.\n Twelve years ago, Li Yao had used a fashion show at the Paris Fashion Week to shine. At that time, the famous luxury brand C Family had given an invitation to Li Yao in hopes of hiring him as their chief designer.\n But Li Yao rejected it.\n The reason was that he liked China and wanted to spend the rest of his life with his lover, Mo Yao, there.\n So willful!\n But Li Yao had the right to be willful. This was because his lover was part of the earliest batch of strong female CEOs in China, the richest woman in Asia, Mo Yao!\n Recognizing Li Yao\u2019s identity, Song Ci was very emotional. Li Yao was the designer she respected the most.\n Li Yao was born in the I Nation in the South and received advanced education from the west. Although he was an Indian man, he didn\u2019t have the egotistical notion that men were born to be respected and women should serve men. Moreover, he didn\u2019t agree with the existence of the caste system. In order to overthrow it, Li Yao had put in a lot of effort.\n Perhaps because he was too influential and stubborn, he was once assassinated at the age of 28 and thrown into the sea.\n With the blessing of the Goddess of Luck, not only did Li Yao not die, he even got to know Mo Yao.\n Mo Yao rescued the dying Li Yao out of the sea, and gave him a new life.\n At that time, Song Ci was still young and didn\u2019t pay attention to such matters. But as she grew up and frequently came into contact with the fashion circle, Song Ci naturally heard about Li Yao\u2019s sensational past. Song Ci admired and respected Li Yao.\n Never did she expect to see Li Yao in person. Excited, Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist grabbing Han Zhan\u2019s arm and whispered to him. \u201cLi Yao! Brother Han, it\u2019s Li Yao! I see a living Li Yao!\u201d\n Han Zhan felt somewhat helpless.\n Li Yao had good hearing. Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, he couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cI\u2019m alive. Do you want to touch and see?\u201d Li Yao reached out his hand and handed it to Song Ci.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Only then did she realize that Han Zhan had used the word \u201cUncle Li\u201d to address Li Yao.\n Han Zhan actually knew Master Li Yao!\n \u201cY-yes, I want to shake hands!\u201d Overwhelmed, Song Ci reached out and grabbed Li Yao\u2019s hand. It was warm! Song Ci said excitedly, \u201cMaster Li Yao, I like you. No, I like the clothes you design. No, I also like your person...\u201d\n The more she spoke, the more confused she became. Song Ci\u2019s face burned and she started to stutter.\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He pulled Song Ci into his arms, and said to Li Yao, \u201cUncle Li, stop teasing her. She\u2019s shy.\u201d\n Song Ci heard Li Yao say, \u201cI am teasing her because she is cute. If she is not cute, I won\u2019t tease her either. Why are you so protective of your wife when I just teased her a little?\u201d It seems like it\u2019s just a matter of time before Han Zhan became her slave.\n Song Ci\u2019s face grew even hotter at the compliment.\n Li Yao was finally willing to let Song Ci off. \u201cAlright, I will bring you to see your gown.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan released Song Ci from his arms. Song Ci was too embarrassed to look at Li Yao, but she had some doubts.\n [fuzzy]As they walked, Li Yao explained to Song Ci. \u201cActually, Zhanzhan\u2019s godmother is Mo Yao. I am Mo Yao\u2019s lover, so Zhanzhan naturally has to call me Uncle.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Song Ci was slightly shocked.\n What?\n The richest woman in Asia, Mo Yao, is Han Zhan\u2019s godmother?\n Li Yao turned and saw that Song Ci\u2019s eyes were filled with shock. He stifled a smile. \u201cAre you very shocked? What to do then? From now on, Mo Yao is also your godmother.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart shuddered.\n The richest woman in Asia is my godmother!\n Song Ci felt that after she married Han Zhan, even poultry and dogs would rise to heaven.\n \u201cZhanzhan actually has three godmothers. The singer, Di Rongrong, and the diplomat, Jin Luolan, are all his godmothers.\u201d Li Yao winked at Song Ci and whispered to her privately. \u201cLet me tell you a secret. Di Rongrong especially likes it when people praise her for her beauty. Jin Luolan likes the gorgeous man Yan Jiang. The next time we meet, you must do what they like.\u201d\n Song Ci knew that Li Yao was trying to advise her on how to please Han Zhan\u2019s other two godmothers. She grabbed Li Yao\u2019s arm and thanked him sincerely. \u201cUncle Li, you\u2019re the best. I love you.\u201d\n Li Yao patted Song Ci\u2019s hand and said with a faint smile, \u201cJust love Zhanzhan.\u201d\n \u201cOf course. I truly love Brother Han.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s for the best.\u201d Li Yao sized up Song Ci\u2019s figure before saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that will definitely suit you very well. It\u2019s in my office. I\u2019ll go get it for you. You guys shop around first.\u201d\n Li Yao went to the office alone and left the entire place to Han Zhan and his wife.\n After Li Yao left, Song Ci released her true self. Due to her relationship with Han Zhan, Song Ci looked at Han Zhan with admiration. \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019re so mean. You never told me that the richest woman in Asia is your godmother.\u201d\n No wonder Han Zhan was so good at doing business\u2014he had a powerful backer.\n ]Han Zhan said, \u201cI planned to tell you when I have the chance in the future.\u201d Afraid that Song Ci would be unhappy, Han Zhan explained further. \u201cThese three godmothers of mine are my mother\u2019s good friends. We\u2019ve known each other since I was in junior high school. They treat me like their own children.\u201d\n \u201cI learned all my business tactics from my Godmother Mo Yao. Sheng Hui Technology, East Ying Real Estate Group were also started when I learned from my Godmother at a young age, so I built businesses to practice... I didn\u2019t expect them to be so well done.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s tone was rather puzzled. Song Ci was stunned. She sighed. \u201cAs expected of the richest woman in Asia. With just a wave of her hand, she brought up Wangdong City\u2019s richest man.\u201d\n It was rare for Han Zhan to be slightly embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s because Godmother Mo Yao is too awesome.\u201d\n Song Ci wanted to ask more questions, but Li Yao pushed over a model rack wearing a gorgeous gown. \u201cSong Ci, come and try this gown.\u201d\n Song Ci stared at the gown on the rack, her eyes full of astonishment and fondness.\n It was an asymmetrical purple gown with a deep V-neck collar that reached into her navel. Her breasts were designed in a pleated arc. The waist of the gown was embroidered with silver threads in a beautiful pattern. From the waist down to the hem, it was decorated with three-dimensional flower patterns.\n It was a bold and absolutely beautiful gown!\n Song Ci\u2019s heart was racing.\n Li Yao pulled her into the changing room.\n As a designer, Li Yao had seen many beauties\u2014men and women, both dressed and naked. But Song Ci was Han Zhan\u2019s wife, so Li Yao had to avoid her.\n He pulled up the curtain and said to Song Ci, \u201cYou can change yourself. Call me if you need any help.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci quickly took off her clothes and put the gown on. She needed Li Yao\u2019s help with the zipper on her back. \u201cUncle Li, can you help me with the zipper?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Li Yao was about to draw the curtains when Song Ci recalled the marks Han Zhan left on her body last night. She suddenly exclaimed and hurriedly said, \u201cUncle Li, can you just reach your hand in?\u201d\n \u201cAre you afraid that I will take advantage of you?\u201d Li Yao smiled teasingly, but he didn\u2019t open the curtain and just slipped his hand inside.\n Song Ci replied, \u201cNo way. It\u2019s just that there are some things that are not convenient to be seen.\u201d\n Li Yao raised his brows and smiled. \u201cVery loving.\u201d He didn\u2019t expect his godson to be so passionate.\n With Li Yao\u2019s help, Song Ci changed into a gown and walked out carefully with the hemline.\n Li Yao saw how careful she was, as if she was afraid of damaging the gown, and felt amused and comforted at the same time. \u201cWhy are you so nervous? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s some tattered fabric. It won\u2019t break so easily.\u201d\n However, Song Ci said, \u201cEveryone says that every piece of work is like the designer\u2019s child. Since Uncle Li made this child yourself, how can I not be more meticulous?\u201d Song Ci was not trying to flatter Li Yao. She really liked this dress. Such a beautiful piece of art should be treated with care.\n Hearing this, Li Yao looked at Song Ci differently. \u201cYou are the second person to treat my work like a child.\u201d\n \u201cWho was the first?\u201d Song Ci asked curiously.\n Li Yao said, \u201cMy lover.\u201d\n Song Ci was not surprised to hear this answer. She smiled and said, \u201cShe has good taste and found you. I have good taste and found Brother Han. It seems like I have something in common with the richest woman in Asia.\u201d\n Li Yao was once again tickled by Song Ci.\n \u201cYou are a good girl.\u201d Li Yao looked at the alluring and graceful beauty in the gown over his glasses. He continued, \u201cZhanzhan is also an outstanding child. Before his accident, he was also a boy who was sought after by girls. But later... To put it bluntly, even a fallen tiger will be bullied by dogs. Everyone is realistic.\u201d\n Upon hearing Li Yao\u2019s words, Song Ci said, \u201cThey don\u2019t even know what they have missed out on.\u201d Han Zhan had all the power, status, and money that all those people spent their entire lives pursuing, but they had willingly given up on it.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

He could see the possessiveness and scheming look on the young lady\u2019s face. Indeed, the top socialite was no fool.\n \u201cSong Ci, since you have decided to be Han Zhan\u2019s wife, I hope that you can support each other forever.\u201d Li Yao didn\u2019t care about the reason behind Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s marriage. He only cared about the outcome.\n He only hoped that Song Ci would treat Han Zhan well and never let him down.\n Song Ci turned around and looked at Li Yao seriously. She said with a stern expression, \u201cAs long as Han Zhan doesn\u2019t betray me, I will definitely not disappoint him.\u201d\n Li Yao was reassured by her words.\n After changing into the gown, Song Ci started styling herself in Li Yao\u2019s studio. When she was done, Li Yao looked at Song Ci with satisfaction and said, \u201cAlright, now you can show Zhanzhan your most beautiful side.\u201d\n Song Ci looked at herself in the mirror and looked forward to Han Zhan\u2019s reaction.\n ...\n Han Zhan was sitting at the coffee table in the main hall making a call. He was speaking in German and was probably discussing Zeus Number 1 with his German partner. Song Ci waited for him to finish speaking before coughing.\n Han Zhan turned around in surprise to see Song Ci standing behind him. \u201cAre you done?\u201d\n Song Ci circled her fingers around her collarbone. She stared at Han Zhan with sparkling eyes and asked Han Zhan expectantly and anxiously, \u201cBrother Han, how is it? Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s attention was on her gown.\n \u201cNot very nice.\u201d As if he didn\u2019t see the gloominess in Song Ci\u2019s eyes, Han Zhan lied blatantly. \u201cOld Madam Cheng\u2019s 80th birthday is a formal occasion. I think you should wear a more demure and conservative gown...\u201d\n Although his words were righteous, Han Zhan\u2019s gaze lingered between Song Ci\u2019s collarbone and her chest.\n After hearing this, Song Ci also felt that it made sense. She was about to nod when Li Yao, who was beside her, stared at Han Zhan as if he could see through everything and said expressionlessly, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Aren\u2019t you just worried that she will be remembered by others if she\u2019s too good-looking?\u201d\n Which man isn\u2019t possessive?\n Having his thoughts exposed, Han Zhan was embarrassed for once, but Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up. She tilted her head and asked Han Zhan, \u201cIs what Uncle Li said true?\u201d\n How could Han Zhan admit it?\n He said with a serious face, \u201cChange into another one. I think that one is quite good.\u201d Song Ci followed the direction of Han Zhan\u2019s finger and looked over. It was a red, slanted shoulder sleeve style fishtail dress. Not too revealing, and also very solemn.\n Deep down, Song Ci wanted to dress beautifully and flaunt her figure, but she still took into account Han Zhan\u2019s possessiveness and changed into that red fishtail dress.\n Before leaving, Han Zhan said to Li Yao, \u201cUncle Li, I want that purple gown too. Someone will come and get it later.\u201d\n Li Yao raised his brows and said angrily, \u201cHurry up and leave!\u201d\n Song Ci heard Han Zhan\u2019s words and was slightly stunned. How can this person be so capricious?\n Standing in the lift, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like that?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cYou look good in it.\u201d\n \u201cBut you don\u2019t allow me to wear it.\u201d Song Ci sounded slightly annoyed. At this point, the advantage of being single was shown\u2014being single meant that no one could control what she wanted to wear. But after marriage, Song Ci had to listen to Han Zhan and please him.\n Han Zhan knew that Song Ci was unhappy with his decision, and also knew that she was willing to change into a gown because she wanted to please him. He leaned over and whispered into Song Ci\u2019s ear. \u201cYou can wear it at home. I like it a lot.\u201d\n Song Ci thought of a hot scene and gave Han Zhan a meaningful look. She suddenly smiled and said, \u201cBrother Han, I am only 22 years old this year. You are already 32 years old. Although you are in the prime of your life and are very energetic, you can do whatever you want...\u201d\n Seeing that Han Zhan was attracted by her words, Song Ci had the urge to take revenge. She said in a coquettish manner, \u201cIt\u2019s said that a woman in her thirties is like a wolf and a woman in her forties is like a tiger.\u201d\n Patting Han Zhan\u2019s stomach, she could feel the vigorous strength hidden under the material of his shirt. Song Ci was thinking about how tough his muscles were, but she said something she didn\u2019t mean. \u201cBy then, I\u2019m afraid your muscles will become fat and you will turn from an uncle to become a grandfather. It will be problematic if your stamina can\u2019t keep up with us.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s brows twitched violently as he resisted the urge to beat Song Ci up.\n The lift reached the first level. Han Zhan strode out and suddenly turned back to stop Song Ci who was about to exit the lift.\n Song Ci looked up at him and saw Han Zhan\u2019s dark expression. \u201cBaby Ci is right, so I should use up all of your energy first. That way, you won\u2019t have the energy to play tricks when you\u2019re 30 years old.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n She felt her legs turn to jelly.\n ...\n On the way to the Cheng Family\u2019s villa, the two of them didn\u2019t speak, both harboring ulterior motives. Han Zhan\u2019s driver had left early and it was Long Yu who was driving now. Long Yu noticed the strange atmosphere in the car, but didn\u2019t dare to say anything, so he just drove quietly.\n The car arrived safely at the entrance of the Cheng Family\u2019s villa.\n Han Zhan averted his gaze from the window, and turned to see Song Ci staring at the Cheng Family residence in a daze. Her expression was dark, as if she had recalled something unhappy.\n Han Zhan suddenly said to Long Yu, \u201cBrother Long, find a place to rest first.\u201d\n Long Yu knew that Han Zhan had something to tell Song Ci and wanted to send him away. \u201cOkay.\u201d Long Yu got off the car and walked towards the main street, planning to find something to eat.\n There was no one in the car. Only then did Song Ci turn sideways to look at the Cheng Family villa\u2019s door. Her eyes were dark and insidious, and there was no smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in this villa for six years. The Cheng Family is wealthy and there are many people in the villa, but strangely, they just can\u2019t hear the cries of despair.\u201d\n It was not that Song Ci had not cried during the years, when she was beaten up by Cheng Ziang. However, when the servants downstairs heard it, they pretended not to hear it.\n Eyes and ears were like sensor tubes when you needed them. When you didn\u2019t, they were just decorative items. There were many people in this world whose hearts live a deaf and mute person.\n Song Ci pointed at the plaque above the main door. She stared at the words \u201cCheng Residence\u201d and said, \u201cThe first time I was beaten up by Cheng Ziang was at the main entrance.\u201d She created trouble for herself because she had smiled at the courier.\n \u201cWhen the servants saw it, they all lowered their heads and pretended to be blind.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached slightly. He grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and told her, \u201cYou are Mrs. Han now. No one would dare to hit you.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled at Han Zhan and suddenly changed the topic. \u201cDo you know how Cheng Ziang took revenge on me after I reported him in my previous life?\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned. He instinctively wanted to refuse to liste, but wanted to know more about Song Ci.\n Han Zhan remained silent as he heard Song Ci say calmly, \u201cHe hired a homeless person and told him that as long as he can cripple me, the man will get 500,000 yuan.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "113": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-114\n\n Chapter 113: Han Zhan, I\u2019ve Killed Someone Before  To a homeless person, 500,000 yuan was already a fatal temptation. Moreover, the target was a devastatingly beautiful woman.\n This was a win-win situation.\n A storm brewed in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes \u2013 dark and frightening. His muscles tensed up as he tightened his grip on Song Ci.\n Song Ci\u2019s arm was hurting from his grip, but she didn\u2019t stop Han Zhan. Luckily, she could still think clearly and felt rather calm. Song Ci said, \u201cThinking back on that day, it was really quite scary.\u201d\n A sense of violence welled up in Han Zhan\u2019s heart. He wanted to tear that Cheng Ziang apart to vent his anger.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes drifted away as if she had returned to that night. She continued to speak. \u201cIt was very painful and very hopeless. No matter how much I screamed, the people downstairs pretended not to hear me.\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly growled. \u201cEnough!\u201d But Song Ci didn\u2019t stop and said, \u201cHan Zhan, I\u2019ve killed someone before.\u201d\n Han Zhan took a deep breath.\n Song Ci closed her eyes as she recalled that dark day. Her lashes quivered uncontrollably, revealing the uneasiness and pain in her heart.\n There was a tinge of fear in her voice. \u201cThe knife was hidden under my bed sheets. I killed someone for the first time because I didn\u2019t have the experience and couldn\u2019t control my strength well. The knife went into that dirty man\u2019s neck. It was stabbed very deeply. When the arteries broke, blood flowed onto my face. It was the first time I knew that a person\u2019s blood could be so red, so hot, so... disgusting.\u201d\n \u201cThat man\u2019s clothes were in disarray when he died. He never expected me to kill him, before he even tasted anything.\u201d Song Ci sneered. She opened her eyes, her gaze cold and arrogant. \u201cLook at what kind of trash he is. Even if I, Song Ci, am stuck in a quagmire, even if I am covered in mud, I am not something he can touch!\u201d\n \u201cStop it!\u201d Han Zhan suddenly leaned over, grabbed Song Ci\u2019s chin, and kissed her fiercely.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes were closed and her muscles were tense from fear and anger; her entire person was just like a statue. Han Zhan\u2019s breath warmed Song Ci\u2019s entire body.\n Song Ci was like a fluttering flower that had found a foothold, and no longer had to worry about rain or wind. Her body gradually relaxed as she laid weakly in Han Zhan\u2019s arms. Tears finally streamed down her face and onto her neck.\n Realizing that Song Ci had finally relaxed, Han Zhan finally released her.\n Under the dim light, Han Zhan saw the fragile look on Song Ci\u2019s face. She fixed her eyes on Han Zhan, squeezed his arm tightly, and said hoarsely, \u201cHan Zhan, hug me.\u201d\n Wiping away Song Ci\u2019s tears, Han Zhan pulled her into his arms.\n Deep down, Han Zhan loved and doted on her. He couldn\u2019t resist kissing her hair and consoling her with a pained heart. \u201cSong Ci, we can settle the scores one by one, but you must promise me not to be blinded by hatred.\u201d\n Having suffered so much humiliation, Song Ci definitely wouldn\u2019t let Cheng Ziang off. Han Zhan also supported Song Ci\u2019s revenge, but he didn\u2019t allow her to lose herself in the path of revenge.\n Hearing this, Song Ci was shocked. She said, \u201cI thought you would tell me that everything is in the past and I am safe now, and that I should let go of the past and cherish the present.\u201d\n Han Zhan was silent for a few seconds before saying, \u201cNo, what I want to tell you is that all the hardships, injuries, and humiliation you\u2019ve suffered should all be repaid in double. There\u2019s no reason for me to urge you to forgive when you\u2019ve been hurt.\u201d\n He looked at Song Ci\u2019s teary eyes and sighed. \u201cIf I urge you to let go of your hatred, who will urge them to let you go?\u201d It was the duty of a saint to urge others to let go of their sins and hatred. Han Zhan didn\u2019t want to be Song Ci\u2019s god\u2014he just wanted to be her husband.\n When she was cold, he would help her put on more clothes.\n When she was hungry, he would cook for her.\n When she was humiliated, he would avenge her.\n Song Ci rested her head on Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder. Hearing his words, she finally felt at ease. After a moment, when she calmed down, Song Ci pushed Han Zhan away. She looked down and tidied her skirt. \u201cIf we still don\u2019t get off the car, we\u2019ll be late.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d\n The two of them alighted from the car and walked arm in arm toward the main entrance of the Cheng residence.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan arrived hand in hand. Their stunning beauty attracted the attention of the guests outside the main entrance.\n A well-known young lady who knew Song Ci walked over to greet her. \u201cSong Song, you are here too?\u201d The person who spoke was born in a scholarly family, and her name was Zheng Suyue.\n She was wearing a cream-colored embroidered dress and had long hair draped over her shoulders. She didn\u2019t look very pretty, but she looked demure and elegant.\n Song Ci smiled at her. \u201cSuyue, long time no see.\u201d\n Zheng Suyue naturally knew about Song Ci\u2019s marriage, but her good upbringing allowed her to maintain an elegant and gracious manner in front of the nobody Han Zhan. Zheng Suyue smiled slightly at Han Zhan and said to Song Ci, \u201cI believe this must be your husband, Mr. Han. I\u2019ve seen his photo.\u201d\n Everyone in Wangdong City knew that Song Ci had married a nobody. There was no need for Zheng Suyue to pretend not to know Han Zhan.\n Song Ci nodded and said to Han Zhan, \u201cMiss Zheng is my friend and also my high school classmate.\u201d Han Zhan nodded at Zheng Suyue and reached out his gloved right hand to shake hers, before quickly letting go.\n Noticing that Han Zhan was wearing a glove on his right hand, Zheng Suyue thought that the rumors were true \u2013 Song Ci\u2019s husband was really a handicapped man. Although she was puzzled as to why Song Ci would marry such a person, Zheng Suyue was not the type to worry easily, so she did not ask.\n \u201cShall we go in together?\u201d Zheng Suyue asked Song Ci.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n A security guard stood at the main entrance, carefully and respectfully checking the invitation cards of each guest. The three of them handed over the invitation cards and passed the security checks, before entering the Cheng Family\u2019s villa together.\n At the main entrance, greenery lined the walls. Two majestic stone lions were carved in vivid detail.\n The buildings in the Cheng Family residence were rather old and were filled with signs of age. However, these signs didn\u2019t seem old and weary at all. Instead, they gave off the feeling that the Cheng Family had a long history.\n The Cheng Family\u2019s villa was not big. One main building took up two-thirds of the area. Behind the main building were three rows of villas. Song Ci and Cheng Ziang had stayed in the villa on the left side in her previous life.\n The main building was three stories high and built into a cylindrical structure. The top of the castle was the main venue for gatherings and parties.\n Walking into the banquet hall, Zheng Suyue met a friend and parted ways with Song Ci. Once she left, Song Ci turned to Han Zhan and said, \u201cZheng Suyue\u2019s grandfather is the principal of Wangdong University.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI met her grandfather before. He\u2019s a writer.\u201d\n As she muttered to herself, Song Ci saw Mu Mian and Mu Qiu, but Du Tingting was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps her morning sickness was worsening and she was not suitable to attend such events.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "114": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-115\n\n Chapter 114: Just Jealous  Nominally, Song Ci was still the adopted daughter of the Mu Family. If she didn\u2019t put on an act in public, she would definitely be criticized. Mu Mian also saw Song Ci and walked over with his precious daughter, Mu Qiu.\n Upon seeing the father-daughter duo, Song Ci greeted respectfully yet distantly, \u201cFather, Qiu-er.\u201d Han Zhan was taking fruit wine and handed one glass to Song Ci, before following Song Ci to greet Mu Mian. \u201cFather.\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s brows twitched when he heard Han Zhan call him father. His facial expression control almost did not work.\n Song Ci\u2019s wedding had caused quite a stir. Today was the first time Song Ci had brought her husband to a formal event after her wedding. Many eyes were fixed on them, hoping to see a good show.\n Mu Mian had to suppress his unhappiness, as he didn\u2019t want to be the center of gossip due to the scrutiny of others. He grunted in reply, sort of answering Han Zhan.\n \u201cHello Brother-in-law.\u201d After greeting Han Zhan, Mu Qiu hugged Song Ci\u2019s arm and pulled her away from Mu Mian and Han Zhan.\n Arriving at a less crowded place, Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t conceal her excitement as she said to Song Ci, \u201cI heard them say that Du Xueyan will also be coming tonight.\u201d Mu Qiu didn\u2019t realize that after hearing this, Song Ci\u2019s expression suddenly stiffened.\n Song Ci instinctively glanced at Han Zhan who was not far away.\n Han Zhan pretended to be listening intently to someone else. He lowered his head slightly, but his eyes were extremely cold. For a big boss behind the scenes like him, listening to Mu Mian and the rest talking was like a university student listening to a primary school student answering a math question. It was boring and funny.\n Song Ci lowered her eyes and stared at the fruit wine, that was slightly green, in her glass.\n \u201cI have something on.\u201d With that, Song Ci pushed Mu Qiu aside and walked towards Han Zhan.\n Seeing Song Ci walk over, Han Zhan left Mu Mian\u2019s social circle and walked towards Song Ci. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Noticing that Song Ci seemed to have something to say, Han Zhan brought her to the semi-circular balcony outside the banquet hall.\n The birthday party had just started and there was no one on the balcony. The surroundings quietened down. Song Ci raised the fruit wine and asked Han Zhan, \u201cIs this wine nice?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t understand but answered honestly, \u201cYes.\u201d\n Song Ci asked again, \u201cWhat color is it?\u201d\n Han Zhan looked doubtful. After confirming that Song Ci was still the same Song Ci and not an imposter, Han Zhan said, \u201cGreen.\u201d\n Song Ci stroked her own hair. Her voice was slightly chilly as she said, \u201cI have a feeling that this green color will run all over my head later. It will be as wide as the Hurenbelle Grasslands.\u201d She could even race horses now.\n If Han Zhan still didn\u2019t understand Song Ci\u2019s hint, then he was being foolish.\n Song Ci was hinting that he will make her a cuckold[1].\n Han Zhan leaned closer to Song Ci and brought her glass of wine to his lips. He took the glass and drank it. Song Ci raised her brows and looked at him unhappily. \u201cI just took a sip.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled. \u201cDu Xueyan is coming.\u201d Han Zhan said with certainty.\n Song Ci suddenly looked up and glared at him. \u201cYou knew? You contacted her in private?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s tone was full of jealousy.\n Han Zhan suppressed his laughter and explained. \u201cI guessed it from your reaction.\u201d\n The Cheng Family had a wide range of businesses and one of them was an appliance company. Du Xueyan was the global spokesperson for their refrigerator. Since she happened to be in Wangdong City, it was not strange for her to attend Old Madam Cheng\u2019s birthday party.\n Song Ci sneered. \u201cYou must be very happy to see your old lover.\u201d\n This time, Han Zhan became glib-tongued. He retorted. \u201cWe\u2019re about to meet your ex-husband. How are you feeling?\u201d\n Song Ci was suddenly speechless. Only then did she realize that Du Xueyan was Han Zhan\u2019s ex, who kicked Han Zhan away, while Cheng Ziang was her ex-husband who had been stabbed by her. The two of them were of the same character. No one could blame the other.\n \u201cI am not jealous, I am just...\u201d Song Ci suddenly couldn\u2019t say what it was. Han Zhan looked down at her, encouraging her to continue explaining with his eyes. Song Ci couldn\u2019t explain and just admitted,\u201d Alright, I am just slightly jealous. \u201d\n Han Zhan nodded in satisfaction. \u201cGot it.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cWhat do you get...\u201d Song Ci glanced at Han Zhan, hoping that he would say something nice like \u2018you are my wife, Du Xueyan is just an ex-girlfriend\u2019 or \u2018you are the most important one\u2019.\n But Han Zhan didn\u2019t say it. Instead, he held her hand and returned to the banquet hall.\n When they returned to the banquet hall, they saw that the two young masters of the Cheng Family had appeared. Cheng Yanmo was dressed in a dark blue suit, reserved and steady. Wearing glasses, he looked even more unfathomable.\n Standing beside Cheng Yanmo was a handsome Cheng Ziang dressed in white. But his eyes were grim and he didn\u2019t look friendly at all.\n As the head of the wealthy young masters in Wangdong City, Cheng Yanmo was the center of attention wherever he went. Staring at Cheng Yanmo who was surrounded by a group of youngsters, Han Zhan lowered his head and said to Song Ci, \u201cIf that adoptive father of yours really treats you well, he should let you marry Cheng Yanmo, not that...\u201d\n Glancing at the handsome and elegant Cheng Ziang beside Cheng Yanmo, Han Zhan frowned slightly, as he thought of his ruthless heart behind his good-looking face. He said in disdain, \u201cTrash.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci also stared at Cheng Yanmo and Cheng Ziang.\n She had to admit that Han Zhan was right. Compared to Cheng Ziang, Cheng Yanmo was many times more outstanding. Although she and Mu Qiu were both Mu Mian\u2019s children, there was a difference in their relationship. The best man would naturally be reserved for his beloved daughter.\n Song Ci took another drink from the bartender\u2019s hand and downed it in one gulp. She felt increasingly upset.\n I must have been blind to have listened to Mu Mian back then.\n [fuzzy]Cheng Ziang left his brother\u2019s side and looked up to see Song Ci in the distance. Dressed in a red dress, Song Ci looked like a vibrant red cuckoo. She stood there quietly, like a beautiful painting.\n She was far superior to other women.\n Upon seeing Song Ci, Cheng Ziang couldn\u2019t conceal the astonishment in his eyes. But when he saw the tall man holding Song Ci\u2019s hand from the corner of his eye, the glint in Cheng Ziang\u2019s eyes instantly dimmed. Step by step, he walked over to Song Ci, stood in front of her, smiled slightly, and said elegantly, \u201cMs. Song, long time no see.\u201d\n Song Ci held Han Zhan\u2019s hand and smiled beautifully. \u201cLong time no see, Second Young Master Cheng. This is my husband, Han Zhan.\u201d\n He sized Han Zhan up. Although this person had outstanding looks and a pair of deep-set eyes, Cheng Ziang couldn\u2019t help feeling slightly indignant at the thought that a nobody with a handicap could actually marry Song Ci who didn\u2019t even care about him.\n His eyes were dark as he asked Han Zhan with a smile, \u201cI wonder which Han Family\u2019s young master is Mr. Han?\u201d\n [1] The direct translation of the phrase of being made a cuckold in Chinese would be \u2018wearing a green hat\u2019, so the author is making a connection between being a cuckold and the green liquid\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

There was also a wealthy Han Family in Wangdong City. However, there was only one young man in that Han Family called Han Qian. Although that Han Qian was a low-profile person, he was a well-known artist and had also appeared in public before.\n Obviously, Han Zhan was not from that Han Family.\n Knowing that Cheng Ziang was belittling Han Zhan using Han Zhan\u2019s background, Song Ci was enraged. She was about to defend Han Zhan when she heard Han Zhan say, \u201cShunchen City, Han Family.\u201d\n [fuzzy]Cheng Ziang thought for a moment.\n Shunchen City was also a major city, but none of the famous families in that city had the surname Han. Thinking of this, Cheng Ziang concluded that Han Zhan was a nobody. At that moment, his gaze became even more disdainful.\n \u201cMs. Song, I didn\u2019t know you liked such men. It\u2019s really surprising...\u201d Cheng Ziang glanced at Han Zhan\u2019s gloved right hand and said with an intriguing tone.\n Before Song Ci could say anything, Han Zhan spoke again. He looked at Song Ci and suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019ve long heard that my wife is extremely charming and has countless admirers, including Second Young Master Cheng. I didn\u2019t dare to believe that a nobody like me could compare to a wealthy young master like Second Young Master Cheng...\u201d\n \u201cNow that I see Second Young Master Cheng flying into a rage out of humiliation, I believe the rumors are true.\u201d Glancing apologetically at Cheng Ziang, Han Zhan used his steadiest and calmest tone to say the most provocative words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Second Young Master Cheng. I come from a humble background, but I can\u2019t resist being good-looking, lucky, and likable.\u201d\n Shameless!\n Even Song Ci felt ashamed for Han Zhan. She secretly stole a glance at Cheng Ziang. That grandson\u2019s face was as black as the bottom of a pot, and his eyes were filled with murderous icicles. \u201cSecond Young Master Cheng, don\u2019t listen to Han Zhan\u2019s nonsense. He only has one advantage\u2014 being thick skinned.\u201d\n Song Ci appeared to be insulting Han Zhan, but her tone was extremely loving.\n Witnessing this scene, Cheng Ziang felt very stifled. He had been wooing Song Ci for a few months now. Song Ci\u2019s attitude toward him was completely devoid of flattery and warmth, being thoroughly cold and polite. Yet she was very protective of Han Zhan.\n Comparing their treatments, Cheng Ziang disliked Han Zhan even more. Taking a deep breath, Cheng Ziang said to Han Zhan in a sinister manner, \u201cYou dog, don\u2019t be so arrogant.\u201d\n Han Zhan retorted, \u201cLittle brat, am I afraid of you?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang clenched his fists, gritted his teeth, and cursed. \u201cF*ck you, f*ck you!\u201d Cheng Ziang was so angry that he lost his senses and was going to step forward to hit Han Zhan. At this moment, a figure appeared behind Cheng Ziang and pressed one hand on his shoulder.\n \u201cZiang.\u201d\n Hearing Cheng Yanmo\u2019s voice, Cheng Ziang paused. His clenched fists hung limply by his sides.\n Cheng Yanmo leaned sideways to block Cheng Ziang\u2019s fist, so that no other guests could witness this scene. Cheng Yanmo lowered his head and warned Cheng Ziang. \u201cIt\u2019s Grandma\u2019s birthday today. What are you trying to do? Control yourself. If you hit a guest, everyone will laugh at you!\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s words snapped Cheng Ziang out of his trance, like a bat hitting Cheng Ziang\u2019s head.\n Cheng Ziang gradually relaxed his fists. He glared at Han Zhan, then glanced at Song Ci, who was completely biased toward Han Zhan, and sneered at her. \u201cA likable man will definitely be liked by others. Ms. Song, I wish you and your husband a blissful marriage.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang\u2019s first sentence was a curse, while his second sentence was sarcasm. Han Zhan said he was good-looking, lucky, and likable, which was why Song Ci married him. Cheng Ziang hinted to Song Ci that since Han Zhan could make her like him, he must also make other women like him.\n He wasn\u2019t blessing Song Ci and her husband. He just couldn\u2019t wait for their relationship to fall apart.\n Cheng Ziang cursed them before leaving indignantly.\n Cheng Yanmo walked up to Han Zhan. He saw that Han Zhan had a calm expression and looked as if nothing had happened, so he knew that this person was very cunning. His younger brother was no match for such an old fox.\n Everyone knew that Zeus Airlines\u2019 Li Li was a business genius. He had become the general manager of Zeus Airlines at such a young age and was truly an outstanding figure. However, the first time Cheng Yanmo saw Li Li, it was not in the business world but at a martial arts school.\n At that time, Cheng Yanmo still didn\u2019t know Li Li. When he saw Li Li, Li Li was lying on the ground moaning in pain from Han Zhan\u2019s beating.\n Later on, when they met at a business meeting, Cheng Yanmo formally befriended Li Li. He realized that the man who had beaten Li Li up so badly that he rolled on the floor was actually Li Li\u2019s subordinate. At that time, Cheng Yanmo felt that something was off.\n How will a subordinate dare to beat his superior up so badly?\n There were too many mysteries surrounding this Han Zhan, but Cheng Yanmo couldn\u2019t find out his real identity. Cheng Yanmo had always been polite to people whom he didn\u2019t know everything about, and wouldn\u2019t offend anyone if he could.\n Cheng Yanmo apologized to them. \u201cMr. Han, Mrs. Han, my brother is mischievous and ignorant. I apologize on his behalf.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Song Ci.\n However, the usually tolerant Han Zhan was very stubborn this time. He said, \u201cSince you know that your younger brother is mischievous and ignorant, Mr. Cheng, you should discipline him more. Don\u2019t let him cause too much trouble that he can\u2019t handle.\u201d\n Song Ci had said that when Cheng Ziang married her, he was already impotent. But as far as Han Zhan knew, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s younger brother was currently a famous teddy dog in Wangdong City. He was extremely domineering and was famous for his dragon-slaying stick.\n This meant that that something major must have happened in the following two years, causing Cheng Ziang to be impotent.\n Cheng Yanmo could protect Cheng Ziang for now, but he couldn\u2019t protect him forever.\n Han Zhan\u2019s dominance was slightly beyond Cheng Yanmo\u2019s expectations. However, Han Zhan\u2019s rebuke was also reasonable. Cheng Yanmo said, \u201cMr. Han is right. I will definitely strictly discipline my younger brother.\u201d\n As the successor of Chuan Dong Group, Cheng Yanmo was destined to be very busy tonight. After exchanging a few pleasantries with Han Zhan, Cheng Yanmo left. Then, Song Ci gave Han Zhan a thumbs-up. \u201cNot bad, Brother Han. You have an aura of 2.8 meters.\u201d\n Han Zhan accepted Song Ci\u2019s flattery.\n Right at this moment, a beautiful figure walked in from the main entrance. Someone casually turned to look at the door. After seeing that person\u2019s face clearly, he exclaimed in surprise, \u201cDu Xueyan is really here.\u201d\n Many people turned to look at the door.\n Du Xueyan had long hair draped over her shoulders. She was dressed in a golden, shoulder-length gown made of silk. The smooth material of the gown accentuated her elegant and graceful figure. She was not the only celebrity present today, but she was undoubtedly the most dazzling one.\n [fuzzy]Song Ci saw Du Xueyan and stared at her long hair. Thinking of Han Zhan\u2019s comment at the hospital before their wedding that he didn\u2019t like girls with long hair, she suddenly understood why. He was dumped by the long-haired princess, so he disliked all girls with long hair.\n Han Zhan only glanced at Du Xueyan before looking away. His gaze was as clear as water, without any fluctuations.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "116": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-117\n\n Chapter 116: Taking Abortion Pills  Noticing Han Zhan\u2019s reaction, Song Ci felt that it was too cold. She purposely pushed Han Zhan\u2019s arm and said sourly, \u201cDu Xueyan is here.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI saw her.\u201d\n Song Ci asked again, \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t understand what she meant and asked her, \u201cIn what way?\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cIs Du Xueyan pretty?\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at Du Xueyan again before saying, \u201cShe is indeed pretty.\u201d In high school, Du Xueyan was the prettiest girl in their school. All these years, she had been nourished by her fame and became even prettier.\n Song Ci asked again, \u201cAre you charmed?\u201d Song Ci realized that she was actually feeling slightly uneasy, afraid of hearing Han Zhan\u2019s answer.\n Han Zhan raised his brows and asked, \u201cWhy should I be attracted to a woman who kicked me away when I was at my lowest?\u201d Han Zhan felt puzzled and confused. \u201cDo I look like a masochist?\u201d\n Song Ci was stumped.\n She said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that a common situation on television? The female lead left the male lead when he was at his lowest point. The male lead hated the female lead but still loved her. Reuniting again, the male lead tormented the female lead and was charmed by her again...\u201d\n Song Ci had seen many such plots.\n Han Zhan was speechless. \u201cThat\u2019s not me.\u201d He looked at that beautiful figure in the crowd and said expressionlessly, \u201cI will never be moved by a woman, who has trampled on my dignity, for the second time.\u201d\n Song Ci secretly took a sip of wine. She knew very well that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t just referring to his relationship with Du Xueyan. He was also warning Song Ci. She was Han Zhan\u2019s treasure today, but if she did something unforgivable to him, she, Song Ci, would just be the woman Han Zhan once loved.\n Even if he still loved her, Han Zhan\u2019s dignity wouldn\u2019t allow him to turn back.\n The men of the Han Family would never remarry, but they could divorce and be single forever!\n One could say that Han Zhan was realistic, but this straightforward reality made him even more attractive.\n Being surrounded by people, Du Xueyan looked up inadvertently and saw the gorgeous Song Ci in the corner. She was naturally stunned.\n Song Ci had put on light makeup yesterday when they met. Although she was dressed fashionably, she didn\u2019t look flashy. But tonight, she was wearing a vibrant red dress that accentuated her gorgeous face. Standing silently in the quietest corner, Song Ci still attracted the attention of many.\n Even Du Xueyan had to admit that Song Ci was as beautiful as a flower\u2014even more so than she was.\n If Song Ci is here, then...\n Du Xueyan\u2019s heart tightened as she glanced sideways at the man beside Song Ci.\n Under the chandelier, Han Zhan, who was wearing a black striped suit, stood tall and slender. Under his suit was a pure white French collared shirt with a gold pin and a dark purple striped tie.\n Low-profile and elegant.\n Du Xueyan almost couldn\u2019t recognize Han Zhan anymore. With the suit on, he was handsome and totally different from the flamboyant youth who used to love wearing t-shirts. He looked energetic and lively, and when he spoke to his lovely wife beside him, he had a gentle expression and a smile on his face.\n It was a gentle side that Du Xueyan had never seen before.\n It turned out that this domineering and strong man who never changed his mind actually had such a tender side to him. Realizing this, Du Xueyan felt slightly sour and also slightly jealous of that young Miss Song whom Han Zhan treated so gently.\n It had been eight years since they last met. Du Xueyan had expected to reunite with Han Zhan, but never thought for it to happen so quickly and in such an awkward situation.\n Du Xueyan thought that after his fingers were broken, it would be very difficult for Han Zhan to stand up again. After all, he was so depressed then. Unexpectedly, not only did he successfully walk out of the shadows, but he even met a new girl, got married and started a family.\n He had also given all his gentleness to another woman.\n It is indeed Han Zhan...\n Du Xueyan looked down and her throat felt parched.\n Although Song Ci was talking to Han Zhan, her attention was focused on Du Xueyan. Seeing that Du Xueyan\u2019s expression changed slightly after seeing Han Zhan, she knew that Du Xueyan was still thinking about her Brother Han.\n Song Ci felt very uncomfortable.\n Yesterday, Song Ci liked Du Xueyan no matter how she looked at her. But now, just a casual glance made her heart flustered.\n At this point, the Old Madam of the Cheng Family came out. She was wearing a dark red dress, her white hair in a bun, and a pair of red diamond earrings. She had the grace and powerful aura of someone who had been through a lot.\n Mrs. Cheng was old. She went on stage to say a few words to lighten the mood, and then cut the cake with Cheng Yanmo\u2019s help. After just two bites, the old lady excused herself from the banquet hall, saying that she was old and needed more rest.\n Once she left, the banquet hall was once again left for the youths.\n Du Xueyan saw Mu Mian and walked over to him with a glass of wine. \u201cHello, Mr. Mu.\u201d\n Mu Mian turned around and saw that it was Du Xueyan. His smile was still polite and distant. He didn\u2019t reveal any flirtatious expression just because he saw a beautiful young woman, which made Du Xueyan feel very comfortable.\n Mu Mian\u2019s secretary had been in charge of negotiating with Du Xueyan for the meeting with Mu Qiu. This was the first time Mu Mian saw Du Xueyan in person. Thinking of what she did for Mu Qiu yesterday, Mu Mian smiled mildly and said to Du Xueyan, \u201cSorry, my naughty little girl had troubled you yesterday.\u201d\n Du Xueyan replied, \u201cMr. Mu is too kind. Miss Mu Qiu is a kind and lovely lady. I also believe that good people will be rewarded. I hope Miss Mu Qiu can recover soon.\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s smile remained unchanged, but his eyes dimmed. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n The cell phone in his pocket vibrated. Mu Mian took it out and glanced at it. Seeing that it was his housekeeper, Auntie Zhang, Mu Mian looked up at Du Xueyan. She nodded at him and said considerately, \u201cMr. Mu, I won\u2019t disturb you since you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n \u201cExcuse me.\u201d Mu Mian took his cell phone and went to the quiet corridor to answer the call.\n \u201cIt\u2019s me. Why?\u201d Mu Mian felt uneasy.\n [fuzzy]Auntie Zhang said anxiously over the phone, \u201cSir, come back quickly. Madam nearly took an abortion pill just now!\u201d With that, Auntie Zhang glanced upstairs helplessly, feeling somewhat uneasy.\n Sir had given her an additional sum of money to keep an eye on Madam, afraid that she would do something detrimental to the baby.\n [fuzzy]Hearing this, Mu Mian\u2019s expression changed drastically. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Mu Mian stuffed his cell phone back into his pocket and returned to the main entrance of the banquet hall. He looked up to search for Mu Qiu but couldn\u2019t find her. Mu Mian sent Mu Qiu a message and left in a hurry.\n Song Ci noticed that Mu Mian had left early in a hurry. There was something off about his expression. Her eyes flashed as she looked up at Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, I am going to the washroom.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Walking into the washroom, Song Ci sat on the toilet lid and opened the surveillance camera app on her cell phone. If Mu Qiu was there, she would definitely realize that Song Ci\u2019s surveillance footage was of the Mu Family!\n These were all from surveillance cameras left behind by Song Ci before she left the Mu Family.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "117": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-118\n\n Chapter 117: Master Cheng, Can You Accompany Me? (1)  Song Ci scrolled through the surveillance footage, and saw Auntie Zhang walking out of Du Tingting\u2019s room holding a small white medicine box. Du Tingting followed behind her and kept yelling at her. But Auntie Zhang ignored her and just hurried downstairs.\n Du Tingting stood at the door for a while, before returning to her room, even slamming the door shut.\n Song Ci paused the video and zoomed in on Auntie Zhang\u2019s image. She stared at the small bottle in Auntie Zhang\u2019s hand. The image was slightly blurry and she couldn\u2019t make out the words on it. She could only vaguely see a purplish-red streak on the white box.\n Song Ci frowned and thought for a while. She remembered something and hurriedly opened Baidu to search for \u201cmifepristone.\u201d She successfully found a photo that looked very much like Auntie Zhang\u2019s medicine box.\n Mifepristone.\n It was a well-known abortion pill.\n Song Ci turned off her cell phone with a complex expression. Is Mother planning to use the abortion pill and abort the baby?\n Song Ci knew very well why Du Tingting took abortion medicine. She wanted to have an abortion and donate her heart to Mu Qiu! After all, no hospital or organization would agree to a pregnant woman donating her organs!\n Song Ci felt very pathetic for Du Tingting. It was not worth it for Mu Qiu!\n Turning off the surveillance camera, Song Ci walked out of the washroom and was about to wash her hands, when she looked up and saw a white figure with her back facing her, standing in front of the sink to touch up her makeup. Song Ci didn\u2019t need to see the person in the mirror to recognize her.\n It was Mu Qiu.\n Song Ci smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re already so beautiful, why are you still putting on makeup?\u201d\n Mu Qiu looked up at the mirror and saw Song Ci standing behind her with a smile.\n Mu Qiu pursed her red lips. After confirming that she had applied the lipstick correctly, she turned to look at Song Ci and said, \u201cBig Sister, I intend to find a man to sleep with tonight.\u201d This was also on Mu Qiu\u2019s list of wishes.\n Song Ci\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n Mu Qiu nodded solemnly. \u201cYes, I am already an adult. For my remaining days, I want to do something that I didn\u2019t manage to do.\u201d Having never been in love, she wanted to experience the joy of being an adult before her death.\n Although she understood Mu Qiu\u2019s thoughts, deep down, Song Ci found it very difficult to agree with Mu Qiu\u2019s actions. She said, \u201cQiu-er, sex should be done with the person you love.\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes suddenly dimmed, and she murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t have the time to love someone.\u201d\n Song Ci was stumped by his words.\n Mu Qiu kept the lipstick in her purse and tidied her long hair. She gave Song Ci a playful smile and said mischievously, \u201cBig sister, my father has something on and left first. If he calls you to ask where I am going, tell him I am going to your place.\u201d\n With that, Mu Qiu turned and left.\n Song Ci stood there for a moment before leaving with a heavy heart.\n ...\n Mu Qiu stood in the grand banquet hall and watched a dazzling man from afar. She clenched her fists, took a deep breath, gathered up her courage, and walked over to him.\n \u201cMaster Cheng.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo turned and saw the young lady behind him. He didn\u2019t look surprised.\n The two of them had just met at the bar the night before, so he didn\u2019t find it strange to meet her again. \u201cMu Qiu... are you Mr. Mu Mian\u2019s youngest daughter?\u201d Cheng Yanmo had met Mu Mian before and naturally guessed his identity.\n Mu Qiu nodded slightly.\n He could tell that Mu Qiu was slightly nervous and seemed to have something to say, but for some reason, she found it difficult to say it. Cheng Yanmo said, \u201cYou have something to say to me?\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s heart was racing but she nodded vigorously. \u201cMaster Cheng, can we talk somewhere else?\u201d\n The banquet was ending soon and everyone had been greeted, so Cheng Yanmo had the time. He nodded and brought Mu Qiu to the circular balcony outside the banquet hall.\n Song Ci returned to the banquet hall, and saw Mu Qiu and Cheng Yanmo walking side by side towards the balcony. Recalling Mu Qiu\u2019s words in the washroom, how could Song Ci not understand why Mu Qiu was looking for Cheng Yanmo.\n In her previous life, Mu Qiu and Cheng Yanmo were husband and wife and the two of them were very close. The always distant and cold Cheng Yanmo was very protective of Mu Qiu. Looking at their back views, Song Ci suddenly realized that some things were destined.\n There was no one at the balcony. Even if someone wanted to come, they would stop upon seeing Cheng Yanmo standing there.\n Cheng Yanmo twirled his glass, and gazed at the moths dancing in the flames under the streetlights. He asked the young lady beside him, \u201cWhat do you want to tell me?\u201d Cheng Yanmo could already tell that Mu Qiu was getting restless.\n Mu Qiu stared at Cheng Yanmo\u2019s cold side profile. She mustered up the courage and walked closer to him. Smelling the girl\u2019s lily-scented perfume, Cheng Yanmo turned slightly and glanced at her.\n Tonight, Mu Qiu was wearing a white suspender long skirt with a translucent white mesh covering her long arms. Her long hair was slightly curled and her face was fair. Her slender figure made her look like a pure fairy.\n Cheng Yanmo really liked this type of girl. She looked clean and dainty.\n Mu Qiu poked Cheng Yanmo\u2019s arm.\n Cheng Yanmo snapped out of his trance and looked down at that slender, jade-like finger pressing against his arm. He asked her softly, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He had been in the business circles for several years, and had seen countless people fawning over him. It was not like he had never met a woman who was attracted to him. How could Cheng Yanmo not know what Mu Qiu was trying to say when she hesitated?\n Mu Qiu\u2019s right hand clutched her skirt tightly, but her expression was calm. She asked, \u201cMaster Cheng, do you think premarital sex is acceptable?\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s straightforwardness cheered Cheng Yanmo up. \u201cWhy? Has little Mu Qiu taken a fancy to me?\u201d Having seen so many hypocritical admirers, Cheng Yanmo suddenly saw a lady like Mu Qiu in a new light.\n Under Cheng Yanmo\u2019s profound gaze, Mu Qiu nodded seriously.\n At this, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s expression turned slightly more serious. \u201cMu Qiu, I am not the kind of person who will be responsible for you after a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d Cheng Yanmo was not a man with a pure heart and few desires. He had also been in several relationships, but he was not the kind of man who would be responsible for a woman after sleeping with her.\n His status gave him the right to do whatever he wanted.\n Hearing Cheng Yanmo\u2019s reply, Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Knowing that she didn\u2019t have much time left, Mu Qiu needed to find a rational but heartless man like Cheng Yanmo.\n Only then would Cheng Yanmo not be sad after her death.\n Seeing how satisfied Mu Qiu was with his answer, Cheng Yanmo was slightly taken aback.\n This is a contradictory young lady.\n Mu Qiu was bold and passionate. She gazed up at the tall and broad Cheng Yanmo. Holding her breath, she asked him, \u201cMaster Cheng, can you accompany me tonight?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had drunk some wine and was slightly tipsy. However, he was still rational and clear-minded. But looking at the girl\u2019s inviting and passionate eyes, he felt a stirring in his heart.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

He glanced sideways at Mu Qiu, who looked uneasy. \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n With that, Cheng Yanmo took the lead and walked towards the exit of the banquet hall. Mu Qiu gazed at the man\u2019s majestic and tall back profile. She thought for a moment before following him.\n In the crowd, Song Ci watched as Mu Qiu and Cheng Yanmo left one after the other. She felt slightly conflicted. Han Zhan looked in the direction Song Ci was looking at, and saw Mu Qiu chasing after Cheng Yanmo\u2019s figure as he left. A hint of contemplation flashed across his gray-blue eyes.\n \u201cBrother Han, let\u2019s go back too. It\u2019s getting late.\u201d It was already 9.30pm and Han Zhan needed to sleep at 10pm.\n Han Zhan nodded and left with Song Ci, hand in hand.\n Du Xueyan had already lifted the sides of her dress, and took two steps in the direction of Han Zhan and Song Ci. However, she saw the two of them suddenly walking hand in hand towards the main entrance. She stood there and thought for a few seconds. In the end, she turned around and walked over to the few big bosses.\n On the way home, Song Ci and Han Zhan were both using their phones. Han Zhan was worried about Li Li and his online friend, so Han Zhan sent him a message: [Have you seen your online girlfriend?]\n Li Li didn\u2019t reply. He might still be busy.\n ...\n At this moment, in a music bar supper shop, Li Li and Su Beibei were sitting opposite each other by the window. There was an air conditioner in the shop, and the barbequed meat on the table was sizzling, emitting a tempting fragrance.\n Su Beibei picked up her glass and took a sip of beer. As she tilted her head back to drink, she saw Li Li stealing glances at her. Su Beibei put her glass down and asked Li Li with a smile, \u201cWhy have you been stealing glances at me?\u201d\n Li Li was like a greenhorn, completely not at ease in somewhere that was not his workplace. He honestly said what he was thinking. \u201cBefore meeting you in person, I imagined you as a cute little girl.\u201d\n Before coming, Li Li had prepared a butterfly necklace for Su Beibei. But seeing Su Beibei in person, he realized that she was as slender as a supermodel. Her black clothes made her look elegant and classy, so he knew there was no way he could give her a butterfly necklace.\n A woman like Su Beibei was not compatible with a butterfly necklace.\n Su Beibei chuckled. She asked Li Li, \u201cDo you mind if I smoke?\u201d\n Li Li was slightly surprised but still nodded. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n Su Beibei started smoking. She had an experienced posture and looked like an old smoker. Li Li stole another look at her. It was the first time he realized that women could be so elegant and charming when smoking. However, smoking was harmful to health.\n Li Li wanted to urge Su Beibei to quit smoking, but felt that their relationship was not that intimate yet, so he controlled himself. Not daring to look at Su Beibei, Li Li secretly lowered his head and took a sip from his glass.\n The cold beer entered his stomach and suppressed his unbelievably fast heartbeat.\n Su Beibei held her cigarette and asked Li Li with a faint smile, \u201cAre you very disappointed in me now that you saw me in person?\u201d\n Li Li shook his head and said honestly, \u201cYou amaze me.\u201d Li Li had never come into contact with someone like Su Beibe before. She was obviously a woman with a unique way of thinking.\n Su Beibei suddenly said, \u201cDo you know what I think when I see you?\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s expression turned solemn as he put on a respectful expression.\n Su Beibei said, \u201cSilly boy.\u201d\n Li Li was speechless.\n Li Li\u2019s heart turned cold. He felt that this online romance was going to blow over. Li Li was already prepared to be broken up, but he heard Su Beibei say, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be silly; so easy to please and so funny.\u201d\n Li Li had hope again.\n He asked Su Beibei wrongfully, \u201cSo, am I still to your satisfaction?\u201d\n Su Beibei took one last drag of her cigarette, picked up her chopsticks, and flipped the pork belly over. Smelling the fragrance of the meat, Su Beibei noticed Li Li\u2019s anxious expression and her heart softened.\n Warmth flowed through Su Beibei\u2019s heart. She said, \u201cI have to try to see if I\u2019m satisfied or not.\u201d\n Li Li heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cI will satisfy you.\u201d\n These words were slightly ambiguous and both of them were stunned. Su Beibei smiled teasingly. She said, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to satisfy me without 40 minutes.\u201d This was a topic between adults. How could Li Li not understand?\n He didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about this.\u201d After a pause, Li Li said seriously, \u201cForty minutes is still okay.\u201d\n Su Beibei glanced at him and said with anticipation, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n After making a harmless adult joke, the awkwardness between the two of them lessened significantly. After dinner, Su Beibei suggested going dutch, but Li Li insisted on paying for it himself. \u201cYou can treat me next time.\u201d\n Su Beibei didn\u2019t argue with him.\n The two of them had driven here, so Li Li didn\u2019t even have the chance to send Su Beibei home. He looked at Su Beibei\u2019s red Porsche sports car and praised her. \u201cNice car.\u201d It looked like Su Beibei had made a lot of money writing these few years.\n But Su Beibei reached out her hand.\n Li Li was stunned.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t the present in your pocket meant for me?\u201d Su Bei had already noticed Li Li touching the box in his pocket many times, and guessed that Li Li had prepared a present for her.\n Li Li was slightly embarrassed. He said awkwardly, \u201cI prepared a gift for you, but I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t like it.\u201d\n \u201cLet me see.\u201d Su Beibei insisted.\n Li Li hesitated for a while. In the end, he handed the butterfly necklace to Su Beibei. \u201cI think I picked the wrong gift. You might not like it, so...\u201d Before Li Li could finish his sentence, Su Beibei opened the box.\n Inside the box was a butterfly necklace. The pale pink butterfly pendant was adorned with small diamonds that sparkled. It was exquisite and adorable, a gift suitable for little girls.\n Indeed, such a delicate little thing did not match Su Beibei\u2019s aura.\n \u201cThank you, I\u2019ll accept it.\u201d Su Beibei could tell that the present was not too expensive, so she accepted it. \u201cI also have a present for you.\u201d Su Beibei took out a rectangular form from her bag and handed it to Li Li.\n Li Li looked down and saw a stack of coupons from a cafe.\n Su Beibei said, \u201cIn the future, come to my cafe for coffee. I\u2019ll give you a discount.\u201d\n Li Li didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cAre you trying to pull business?\u201d\n Su Beibei shot Li Li a cold look. She said, \u201cMy shop doesn\u2019t lack business, but a male boss. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to come or not.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s heart was shot.\n \u201cI will definitely come.\u201d\n After saying goodbye to Su Bei, on the way home, Li Li couldn\u2019t help thinking about how the two of them interacted throughout the night. He had to admit that Su Beibei was an intelligent and sensible girl. They got along very well, and he liked her even more now that he had met her in person.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

He changed into slippers, while replying to Han Zhan\u2019s message. Hearing her cell phone vibrate, Song Ci glanced at the cell phone on the dresser, looked up, and shouted, \u201cBrother Han, there\u2019s a new message on your WeChat.\u201d Han Zhan was bathing, and Song Ci sat by the bed watching him bathe in the glass bathroom. The glass wall was covered in mist so she couldn\u2019t see the inside clearly. But Song Ci\u2019s imagination conjured up an extremely alluring image. Han Zhan used his hand to wipe off the mist, revealing his handsome face. He opened his mouth and said something to Song Ci. Although the bathroom door was closed, Song Ci could still hear Han Zhan\u2019s muffled voice. He said, \u201cHelp me take a look at it.\u201d Song Ci smiled and muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t let me see a flirtatious slut.\u201d Song Ci unlocked Han Zhan\u2019s cell phone and opened WeChat. She saw that it was a message from Li Li. Li Li: [Mr. Han, I met Beibei. She is very nice and cool. I am in love.] Only when Song Ci saw the message that Han Zhan sent did she know that Li Li had actually gone to meet his online friend. Staring at the name Beibei, some doubts flashed across Song Ci\u2019s mind. Could this Beibei be the Beibei I know? Without replying to Li Li, Song Ci turned off the cell phone. After Han Zhan finished bathing, Song Ci asked him, \u201cWho is that online friend of Li Li\u2019s?\u201d Han Zhan tossed the towel into Song Ci\u2019s hands. \u201cCan you help me dry my hair?\u201d Song Ci purposely played dirty. \u201cYou don\u2019t have hands?\u201d Han Zhan raised his right hand and said expressionlessly, \u201cI am handicapped.\u201d It was the first time Song Ci saw someone make use of their handicap status so perfectly. She was a beautiful and kind person. How could she bully a handicapped person? Song Ci patted her leg and said to Han Zhan, \u201cSit here.\u201d Song Ci nearly said the words \u2018move by yourself\u2019 but was afraid that Han Zhan would take it seriously, so she could only hold it in. Sometimes, one had to pay the price for their mouths with their bodies. Han Zhan was very obedient and bent over to sit on Song Ci\u2019s lap. Han Zhan didn\u2019t look burly usually, but his frame and muscles were very firm. His muscles were especially heavy when he exerted his strength. In bed, whenever Han Zhan was excited, he would hold his head up high and reveal his Adam\u2019s apple. Song Ci couldn\u2019t get tired of seeing his muscles tense up. Song Ci struggled to breathe as Han Zhan sat down. \u201cGet up, get up. You\u2019re so heavy.\u201d Han Zhan smiled and glanced at her. \u201cUseless.\u201d Seeing that Song Ci really couldn\u2019t stand his weight, Han Zhan got up and sat down beside her. Song Ci knelt behind Han Zhan to dry his hair with a towel. She asked, \u201cIs Li Li\u2019s female online friend called Beibei?\u201d \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan opened his eyes to look at Song Ci. Seeing that she was deep in thought, he felt that something was off and asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Do you know her?\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s tone was slightly odd, as he thought that the world wouldn\u2019t be that small. Song Ci said, \u201cI know a lady called Beibei. What does Li Li\u2019s girl friend do?\u201d Han Zhan hesitated. \u201cI heard she is the author of a mystery novel.\u201d \u201c...Most likely, Li Li\u2019s online girl friend is the Beibei I know.\u201d Song Ci stuffed the towel into Han Zhan\u2019s arms. Seeing that he was interested in this matter, Song Ci told him what she had done today. \u201cI went out today, didn\u2019t I? Actually, I went out to meet a woman. The person I met was called Su Beibei, a mystery novel author. There are many mystery novel authors, but not many of them called Beibei.\u201d Upon hearing this, Han Zhan was also bewildered. \u201cCould it be such a coincidence?\u201d Song Ci nodded and said in deep thought, \u201cSu Beibei\u2019s father is called Su Buwang. He was partners with Mu Mian when they started Chao Yang Company.\u201d Han Zhan was such a smart person. With just one sentence from Song Ci, Han Zhan thought of something else. \u201cSu Buwang died in a car accident with his wife in 2006.\u201d This was something that many people knew. \u201cCould there be something behind their deaths?\u201d \u201cThere is indeed an inside story.\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t elaborate. She just said, \u201cSu Beibei is their orphan.\u201d Hearing this, Han Zhan was momentarily stunned, before his thick brows furrowed slightly. Noticing that Han Zhan\u2019s expression was off, Song Ci was curious and asked him, \u201cBrother Han, is there anything wrong?\u201d Han Zhan sighed and said, \u201cLi Li doesn\u2019t have a father. He and his mother depend on each other for survival. His father was afraid of going to jail after killing someone with his car. As he was too agitated, he jumped off the building.\u201d Song Ci knew about this. She said, \u201cLi Li told me about this during Auntie\u2019s surgery. But what has this got to do with Su Beibei?\u201d Han Zhan shook his head and smiled bitterly. \u201cThe person who was knocked down by Li Li\u2019s father was Su Buwang and his wife.\u201d \u201cOh my god!\u201d Song Ci was shocked by this melodramatic life. Han Zhan felt that the situation between Li Li and the Su Beibei was not reliable. If the two of them continued to be close and discovered the entanglement from several years ago, it would be heart-rending. Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cShould I tell Li Li about this?\u201d Although he was asking Song Ci, Han Zhan already had an answer in his heart. It was the most sensible thing to strangle the budding flower, before their relationship blossomed. Song Ci saw through Han Zhan\u2019s intentions, but she shook her head and said to Han Zhan, \u201cIt\u2019s not as complicated as you think.\u201d \u201cHow so?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not Li Li\u2019s father\u2019s fault that Su Buwang and his wife died.\u201d Meeting Han Zhan\u2019s deep gaze, Song Ci said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s Mu Mian. Mu Mian drugged Su Buwang and his wife. On the way home, the knockout powder became effective and both of them fainted... Even without Li Li\u2019s father\u2019s collision, they would have fallen into the Great Dragon River.\u201d It could only be said that Li Li\u2019s father was too unlucky. \u201cIn my previous life, I died in the same way as Su Buwang and his wife. It was Mu Mian\u2019s usual trick to knock someone unconscious, stuff them into the car, and make the car drop over the cliff.\u201d Song Ci was terrified at the thought of this. She would never forget the fear she felt when she fell off the cliff with her car, as well as the pain of all her bones being broken. That night, she laid on a huge rock on a cliff, looking at the dark sea and listening to the waves. She only felt fear and despair. Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and realized that her palms were in cold sweat. \u201cBaby Ci, that was in your previous life. Everything is different now. You have me by your side.\u201d Han Zhan hurriedly pulled Song Ci into his arms and hugged her tightly. Han Zhan\u2019s scent and warmth gradually warmed Song Ci\u2019s body. Only when her fearful heart regained its composure did Song Ci burrow out of Han Zhan\u2019s arms. \u201cI went to see Su Beibei today to work with her and overthrow Mu Mian.\u201d After pondering for a moment, Han Zhan also told Song Ci, \u201cThat doctor from Newbridge is already under my control. You can make use of that doctor.\u201d Song Ci was overjoyed. \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cMmm.\u201d Song Ci rolled her eyes. One look and Han Zhan knew that she was up to no good.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI want to set up a trap.\u201dHan Zhan said, \u201cTell me about it.\u201dSong Ci put on a mysterious smile. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you. If I do, it won\u2019t be mysterious anymore.\u201dHan Zhan admired Song Ci\u2019s smart and playful manner. \u201cYou can choose not to tell me, but don\u2019t forget to make use of me whenever you need me.\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201d\u2026The next morning at the hotel.The sunlight shone on her face. After a long time, Mu Qiu finally opened her eyes as she felt the warmth of the sunlight.Mu Qiu had been too tired the night before and had fallen asleep on her pillow immediately. When she woke up, she was lying flat on her back with a thin blanket covering her entire body tightly.The person who had tucked her in must have put in a lot of effort.Staring at the sunlight streaming in through the French window, Mu Qiu was momentarily dazed before realizing where she was.Last night, she had given herself to a man.Where is Cheng Yanmo? Thinking of Cheng Yanmo, Mu Qiu hurriedly sat up. Only when she got up slightly more quickly did she realize that her entire body was weak, and especially uncomfortable after her first experience. Mu Qiu endured her discomfort and picked up the note on the bedside table.The note read: [The clean clothes are placed on the sofa. I have rented the room for the entire day. Have a good rest. I am going on a work trip today\u2014Mo.]Mu Qiu folded the note and placed it in her purse.She picked up the remote control and closed the electric curtains. Only then did she step barefoot on the soft carpet and walk to the mirror. Mu Qiu looked at the woman in the mirror. Her face turned slightly hot when she saw the marks on her body.Thinking of those hot scenes, Mu Qiu felt extremely embarrassed.She hurriedly changed into clean clothes and left the hotel.When Mu Qiu arrived home, it was time for lunch. The meal was ready but her mother, Du Tingting, was nowhere to be seen. Thinking of her mother\u2019s pregnancy, Mu Qiu guessed that she must have suffered from morning sickness, so she didn\u2019t come down for lunch. Mu Qiu didn\u2019t ask further.When Auntie Zhang saw that Mu Qiu had returned, she called out to her. \u201cMissy, where did you go last night?\u201dMu Qiu concealed her guilty conscience and spoke as calmly as she could. \u201cI went to stay with my elder sister.\u201dAuntie Zhang nodded. She wanted to say something but hesitated.\u201cAuntie Zhang, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dThere was no way to hide the fact that Du Tingting was pregnant from Mu Qiu. Auntie Zhang could tell that Mu Qiu had already discovered Du Tingting\u2019s pregnancy. After thinking for a moment, she still told Mu Qiu about what happened last night.\u201cMadam is pregnant, but she\u2026 doesn\u2019t want this baby.\u201dMu Qiu was slightly stunned. \u201cWhy?\u201dAuntie Zhang took a deep look at Mu Qiu, her eyes turning red. \u201cWhat else can it be? Madam wants to abort the child in her tummy and transplant her own heart to you, Missy!\u201dMu Qiu\u2019s body swayed as her face paled slightly.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dMu Qiu believed Auntie Zhang was telling the truth. Her mother loved her very much and she really could do such a thing. Thinking of how her father had left the banquet early last night, Mu Qiu hurriedly asked Auntie Zhang, \u201cDid my father come back early last night because something happened to my mother?\u201d\u201cYes, Madam nearly took an abortion pill last night. Luckily I saw her and stopped her in time.\u201d Looking upstairs worriedly, Auntie Zhang said upsettingly, \u201cAfter Sir came back, the two of them quarreled very fiercely upstairs. Madam didn\u2019t come downstairs today and is still resting upstairs.\u201d\u201cI am going to visit her.\u201d Mu Qiu went upstairs alone.The windows of Du Tingting\u2019s room were tightly shut and the curtains were all closed to block out the sunlight.Mu Qiu opened the door and stared at the bed.Du Tingting had lost a lot of weight. The constant nausea had made her extremely fatigued. Her face was also slightly sallow and not as glossy as before. Her hair was a little messy and her face was sunken into the soft pillow. Her eyes were closed, as if she had fallen asleep.Mu Qiu tiptoed over.Hearing the sound, Du Tingting thought it was Mu Mian. She didn\u2019t open her eyes and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to guard me like a criminal. Mu Mian, don\u2019t make me hate you.\u201d\u201cMother.\u201dDu Tingting\u2019s breathing halted when she heard Mu Qiu\u2019s voice. Du Tingting opened her eyes and looked at Mu Qiu. \u201cQiu-er\u2026\u201d The moment she called out Mu Qiu\u2019s name, all her grievances and pain welled up in her heart. Du Tingting burst into tears.She had cried so many times recently that her eyelids were slightly swollen.Mu Qiu also didn\u2019t feel good seeing Du Tingting like this.Lying down beside Du Tingting, Mu Qiu\u2019s hand burrowed into the blanket and rested on Du Tingting\u2019s abdomen. Du Tingting\u2019s eyes twinkled, as she felt slightly guilty and uncomfortable. \u201cQiu-er, I\u2026\u201dDu Tingting was too embarrassed to speak. She had a feeling that telling Mu Qiu she was pregnant would hurt her.Mu Qiu could understand Du Tingting\u2019s intentions. She gently stroked Du Tingting\u2019s still flat abdomen and suddenly said, \u201cHe\u2019s here to give you blessings, right?\u201dDu Tingting looked at her in shock. \u201cYou already know about it?\u201dMu Qiu found it funny. No matter how much Du Tingting tried to avoid her, the signs of her pregnancy would still be exposed. Mu Qiu was no fool and would definitely notice. \u201cI knew it when we were at the hospital.\u201dWorried that Mu Qiu would misunderstand, Du Tingting hurriedly explained. \u201cQiu-er, I don\u2019t want to get pregnant. This child was already in my tummy before your illness acted up. I really am not giving up on you. Qiu-er, believe me.\u201dDu Tingting\u2019s careful explanation made Mu Qiu\u2019s heart ache.\u201cMother, why would I doubt you?\u201d Hugging Du Tingting\u2019s waist, Mu Qiu felt a lump in her throat. She said softly, \u201cMother, you\u2019re someone who is willing to give her life to me. Why would I doubt your love for me?\u201d It was her bad luck that she didn\u2019t have the fate to continue being Du Tingting\u2019s daughter.\u201cThis child is a lucky star. He knows that his elder sister is leaving and that there will be no one to accompany Father and Mother in the future, so he came.\u201d Mu Qiu choked and continued, \u201cHe is here to accompany you on my behalf so Mother, don\u2019t hurt him.\u201dHearing this, Du Tingting finally burst into tears. \u201cQiu-er, I only want you! You are my darling, my darling whom I raised painstakingly for 20 years. I can\u2019t bear for you to leave!\u201dThis was the first time Du Tingting lost her composure in front of Mu Qiu. She was overwhelmed with grief. For the past two months, Du Tingting had been worried about Mu Qiu\u2019s health and the baby in her belly. She had been so troubled that she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.Mu Qiu also cried. \u201cMother, promise me that you will give birth to him.\u201d Even if she was no longer around, there would still be the little one by their side. They would be unhappy and sad, but a new life would always bring them joy and hope.As such, Mu Qiu could leave in peace.Du Tingting nodded tearfully. \u201cAlright, I promise you that I will give birth to him and never do anything foolish again\u2026\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

After going downstairs, Auntie Zhang called Mu Mian and told him what happened at home.Mu Mian didn\u2019t feel happy at all upon learning about the matter.His heart bled profusely at the thought that his darling daughter didn\u2019t have much time left. Mu Mian clicked on a website, muttered to himself for a moment, and suddenly searched for a question on Baidu.[How will you be sentenced for illegally buying organs?]There were many answers to this question. Mu Mian focused on reading them\u2026Mu Mian didn\u2019t know that the few computers under his name were all being monitored by the hackers. Almost as soon as Mu Mian finished browsing the information, Long Yu called Song Ci.\u201cMadam, we noticed that several suspicious browsers had appeared on Mu Mian\u2019s company computer.\u201dSong Ci was running in the gym. Hearing this, she stopped. Turning off the treadmill, Song Ci took her cell phone and walked into the kitchen. As she walked, she said, \u201cSend me his browsing history.\u201dLong Yu said, \u201cI\u2019ve already taken a screenshot and will send it to you immediately.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Song Ci poured herself a glass of warm water and received a screenshot from Long Yu. After reading the screenshot, her eyes lit up.It looked like Mu Mian had really reached the end of his rope. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to engage in illegal transactions online.Song Ci could totally just stand by and watch Mu Mian walk down the path of crime. She would wait until he committed a crime and then expose him. With concrete evidence, Mu Mian would definitely be charged.However, even if there was concrete evidence, the law would only sentence Mu Mian to a few years in jail. Song Fei\u2019s life and hers were not something that could be offset by a few years in jail!Moreover, Song Ci didn\u2019t believe that Mu Qiu was truly innocent. She would get involved in this matter sooner or later. In the past, Song Ci didn\u2019t know what exactly changed Mu Qiu\u2019s character. But after what happened last night, Song Ci finally understood.The thing that could change a woman\u2019s character the most was most probably love.Mu Qiu was a dying person. Before she died, she had tasted Cheng Yanmo\u2019s goodness and developed a bond with him. With her previous life\u2019s experience, Song Ci was sure that Mu Qiu would also fall in love with Cheng Yanmo in this life.When a woman developed love, she would definitely have lingering feelings for this world. Once Mu Qiu fell in love, she would definitely try her best to live on. What would happen then would definitely be very exciting.Thinking of this, Song Ci\u2019s lips curled up coldly.\u2026The bridal shop had already produced the wedding gown and outfits that Song Ci needed to wear on her wedding day. They were just waiting for Song Ci to go over to try them on and modify the details. Mu Qiu was Song Ci\u2019s bridesmaid at her wedding, so she also needed to choose her bridesmaid dress. Song Ci called and invited her along.Mu Qiu agreed happily.The two of them met below the clothing store. Mu Qiu alighted from the car, wearing a pair of simple denim shorts and a white silk blouse.It had only been a few days since they last met and Mu Qiu looked much better and rosy. \u201cElder sister!\u201d Mu Qiu waved at Song Ci who was under the tree with her car keys.Song Ci was standing under a tree with an umbrella. She smiled when she saw Mu Qiu. \u201cThe shop is just upstairs. Come over, don\u2019t stand under the sun.\u201dMu Qiu ran up to Song Ci and walked side by side with her into the building. The air-conditioned building was very cooling. Song Ci kept her umbrella and asked Mu Qiu, who was playing on her cell phone, \u201cYou didn\u2019t go back that night?\u201dMu Qiu turned off her cell phone and acknowledged softly.After entering the lift, Song Ci asked Mu Qiu, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d When she asked that, Song Ci noticed that Mu Qiu\u2019s ears were slightly red.What else did Song Ci not understand?She was obviously charmed.Mu Qiu\u2019s lips twitched as she said despondently, \u201cSo what if I feel good? It\u2019s not like I can go after him.\u201d Mu Qiu could feel her seemingly strong heartbeat, but felt uneasy at the thought that her heart might stop working at any time.\u201cI am someone who can die at any moment. No matter how good he is, I can\u2019t touch him anymore.\u201d Mu Qiu knew this very well. But at the thought that she and Cheng Yanmo could only be together in a one night stand, she felt very unhappy.Mu Qiu felt very jealous, thinking that Cheng Yanmo would marry another woman in the future and do the things he did to her that night.A man who was never content was like a snake trying to swallow an elephant. Who would be willing to let go after tasting the sweetness of love? Having provoked Cheng Yanmo, how could Mu Qiu be willing to let go? Mu Qiu rubbed her ears and said somewhat helplessly, \u201cElder sister, I seem to have fallen for someone.\u201dMu Qiu had a good impression of Cheng Yanmo not because of that night\u2019s indulgence. Long before that, when she saw Cheng Yanmo for the first time in the middle of the night near Han Zhan\u2019s house, Mu Qiu was already somewhat mesmerized by him.Song Ci\u2019s heart almost melted at the sight of Mu Mian\u2019s fragile state. But thinking of her previous life\u2019s pain, Song Ci could only steel her heart and tell herself not to pity Mu Qiu.Song Ci hit the nail on the head. \u201cActually, you shouldn\u2019t have gone to look for him that night.\u201dMu Qiu smiled bitterly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have touched him, but elder sister, I don\u2019t regret it. Even if I can\u2019t have him, I won\u2019t regret it either.\u201d At least that night, Cheng Yanmo belonged to me. (italics)\u201cCheng Yanmo is a man who can afford to fool around. He said before that he isn\u2019t the kind of man who will be responsible for a woman after sleeping with her. So even if I die and Cheng Yanmo hears the news, he will probably only say, \u2018Why did she die so young?\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s good.\u201dMu Qiu had her head down and Song Ci couldn\u2019t see her face clearly. But she could guess that Mu Qiu\u2019s expression must be very ugly. Although she said it was good, she must be feeling very terrible inside.\u201cQiu-er, don\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d Song Ci was warning Mu Qiu. However, it was not up to her to decide what Mu Qiu would do in the end.Mu Qiu forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m really fine!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and look at clothes!\u201dAfter the two of them entered the shop, Song Ci tried on the wedding gown and realized that it was slightly too big for her hips and needed some modifications. \u201cWe need to modify the design. Ms. Song, pay attention to your diet recently and try to maintain your current figure. This wedding gown of yours is a customized one. If you get fat, you won\u2019t be able to wear it then.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter the gown fitting ended, Song Ci and Mu Qiu chose the bridesmaid dresses before leaving.Leaving the bridal shop, Song Ci stood beside the car and asked Mu Qiu, \u201cWhat do you want to eat tonight? My treat.\u201d\u201cSister, do you still remember the barbeque at the entrance of the high school? I really want to eat at that barbeque place. Shall we go and get it?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dSong Ci got Long Yu to drive her and Mu Qiu to the high school. Mu Qiu looked at Long Yu and said to Song Ci, \u201cLooks like Brother-in-law really cares for you.\u201dHan Zhan was working hard alone in Wangdong City. Although he had bought a car and a house, he still had a mortgage to pay. It was not easy. Under such circumstances, he was still willing to spend money to hire a bodyguard for Song Ci, which showed just how much he liked Song Ci.Song Ci smiled shyly and blissfully. She lowered her head slightly and said, \u201cBrother Han is very good to me. I never regretted marrying him.\u201dMu Qiu said, \u201cI can tell.\u201d She could somewhat understand why her elder sister wanted to marry Han Zhan then.Compared to Cheng Ziang, Han Zhan was indeed much more reliable.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

The boss hadn\u2019t changed and the meat still tasted familiar. High school was already a distant memory to the reborn Song Ci, so she actually couldn\u2019t remember the last time she came to this restaurant.Distant memories to Song Ci were just things that happened two years ago to Mu Qiu. Mu Qiu talked non-stop about her high school days to Song Ci. Those funny stories that Mu Qiu thought were hilarious to her were unfamiliar to Song Ci.Song Ci picked up a piece of meat for Mu Qiu, put it in the sauce, dabbed at it, and sent it to Mu Qiu\u2019s bowl. \u201cMy memory is not very good, so I can\u2019t remember many things.\u201dMu Qiu was a person who didn\u2019t gain weight easily. She picked up the piece of meat and threw it into her mouth. Seeing that Song Ci had been eating vegetables and seldom ate meat, Mu Qiu shook her head and teased Song Ci. \u201cYou\u2019re already married, yet you still care so much about your figure?\u201dSong Ci said, \u201cI need to pay more attention to my figure after marriage. After all, Brother Han hugs and touches me every day.\u201dMu Qiu was speechless.She swallowed the meat and complained to Song Ci in a small voice. \u201cBig sister, you are corrupted after getting married.\u201d\u201cNo, I just awakened my power of a corrupted queen.\u201d The moment Song Ci met Han Zhan, she wanted to tease him and see him flustered. Over time, she became a female hooligan.Mu Qiu didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. But thinking of something else, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to smile. \u201cBig sister, Mother is pregnant.\u201d Mu Qiu wasn\u2019t sure if Song Ci knew about this.Song Ci put down her chopsticks, fixed her eyes on Mu Qiu, and said, \u201cI already knew. At the hospital, she suddenly felt nauseous and hid in the toilet. I guessed she was pregnant.\u201d\u201cI knew it! I also guessed it that day.\u201d Mu Qiu supported her head with one hand and smiled in relief. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s quite good to be pregnant now. At least they will have a child by their side after I leave.\u201dSong Ci looked at her with deep meaning and suddenly asked, \u201cAre you being sincere?\u201dMu Qiu was stunned. \u201cElder sister, why do you ask that?\u201dSong Ci pointed out sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t you hate them? Haven\u2019t you ever thought of them giving up on you just because they have a new baby?\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t believe that Mu Qiu was so magnanimous and considerate.Mu Qiu was slightly flustered. Her hands were trembling as she held the cup. \u201cElder sister, is this how you see me?\u201dMu Qiu\u2019s lips quivered a few times. Her tone was slightly indignant as she said, \u201cThat is my younger brother and sister, my blood-related family. When I knew of his existence, I felt slightly uncomfortable, but I looked forward to his safe arrival in this world. I hope that after my death, his arrival will bring my parents out of their grief.\u201d\u201cJust like how after you came to my house, you were beautiful and sensible. I was envious and jealous of you, but I still treated you as a family member and defended you. I also love the baby in my mother\u2019s tummy.\u201d Mu Qiu gripped the glass tightly and said sternly, \u201cEverything I said came from the bottom of my heart!\u201dSong Ci patted the back of Mu Qiu\u2019s hand and said with a smile, \u201cAre you angry? Don\u2019t be like this, I am just worried that you will be unhappy. After all, your health\u2026\u201d Song Ci stopped talking and took a sip of water.\u201d Qiu-er, have some barbeque. \u201dBut Mu Qiu was not in the mood to eat meat. All the flavors were gone. Song Ci picked up a piece of lettuce, wrapped it around the pork belly, rolled it up, and handed it to Mu Qiu. Mu Qiu accepted it and ate it like wax.The meal ended on a sour note and the sisters returned home.On the way home, Song Ci closed her eyes and leaned against the car seat. She recalled all the things that she didn\u2019t take to heart in her previous life.In her previous life, the baby in Du Tingting\u2019s tummy had not been saved, as Mu Qiu had coincidentally undergone surgery when Du Tingting was in the early stages of her pregnancy. Du Tingting had been so busy taking care of Mu Qiu that she didn\u2019t realize she was pregnant. With the sudden stop in her menstrual cycle, Du Tingting thought that it was because she was so worried about her daughter\u2019s health that she went into menopause early. It was only when she miscarriaged that Du Tingting realized she was pregnant.Due to her own carelessness, Du Tingting was still upset and blamed herself for not taking good care of the baby. In her previous life, that child was long gone. In this life, would he be able to arrive in this world safely?After talking to Mu Qiu yesterday, Du Tingting finally let it go. She also realized that it was impossible to save Mu Qiu with her own heart.Du Tingting finally decided to have this child.It was early autumn and the temperature difference was huge between night and day. It was so hot in the afternoon that she felt like taking a cold shower, but autumn winds blew strongly in the evening.Du Tingting put on a shawl and went downstairs. She went for a walk in the courtyard alone.After returning home, Mu Mian saw Du Tingting feeding the koi fish at the pond. His gloomy expression suddenly brightened. \u201cTingting.\u201d Mu Mian walked over to Du Tingting. As he got closer, he saw that Du Tingting\u2019s face was slightly rosy and finally felt relieved.Du Tingting stopped and looked up at Mu Mian.Without waiting for Mu Mian to speak, she spoke first. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I understand now. Using my life to exchange for Mu Qiu\u2019s is cruel to you. If I really do that, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t know how to face Mu Qiu in the future.\u201dMu Mian was shocked by Du Tingting\u2019s words but didn\u2019t retort to her.Actually, Du Tingting was right. Mu Mian would never allow that to happen. The thought that the heart beating inside Mu Qiu was the heart of his wife whom he had loved for so many years made it very difficult for Mu Mian to love Mu Qiu as much as before.As time passed, the father-daughter duo\u2019s relationship would develop into a rift.Du Tingting stuffed the fish food into Mu Mian\u2019s hands. She leaned against the railing. \u201cMu Qiu is my child. I understand her character very well. She is so kind-hearted, she will never accept my heart. I will bear this child and I\u2019ll also cherish the last few moments we have left together with Mu Qiu.\u201d\u201cHubby, don\u2019t worry about me anymore.\u201dHearing Du Tingting\u2019s words, Mu Mian finally felt relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you can accept it.\u201d With that, the relationship between the husband and wife turned for the better. The gloomy atmosphere of the Mu Family was finally lifted.The two of them stood by the pond to finish feeding the fish before returning to the house.Mu Qiu returned home after having some barbequed meat. She didn\u2019t see Du Tingting downstairs and thought she was still angry. She asked Auntie Zhang, \u201cAuntie Zhang, didn\u2019t my mother come down today?\u201dBut Auntie Zhang smiled. \u201cMadam went downstairs today and she thought it through. She decided to have the baby.\u201dHearing that, Mu Qiu was finally reassured. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Turning around, she headed upstairs. In a corner that Auntie Zhang couldn\u2019t see, the smile on Mu Qiu\u2019s face gradually faded. Song Ci\u2019s question at the dining table suddenly rang beside Mu Qiu\u2019s ear.[Don\u2019t you hate them? Haven\u2019t you ever thought of them giving up on you just because they have a new baby?]Mu Qiu\u2019s face suddenly lost all color.Do I not hate them?Mu Qiu gritted her teeth. She couldn\u2019t believe that she would hate her parents and be jealous of that unborn child\u2026\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

However, Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t feel the heat of the hot water.\n Her heart was cold.\n Staring at the clear water in the bathtub, Mu Qiu suddenly thought of dying to end everything.\n After death, there\u2019s no need to be afraid anymore. Anyway, they will soon have a healthy child. Even without me, they won\u2019t be lonely when they\u2019re old...\n Mu Qiu softened her body and allowed herself to slide into the bathtub. Gradually, the warm water engulfed her neck, mouth, and nose.\n She was wrapped in water and her mouth was filled with water. It was very uncomfortable for her to be choked by warm water as it entered her lungs. When the grim reaper really approached and her body was about to reach its limit, Mu Qiu suddenly felt fear.\n Crash...\n ]Mu Qiu suddenly emerged from the bathtub and laid by the side, coughing non-stop until her eyes were red.\n Knock knock.\n \u201cQiu-er, is it convenient for me to come in?\u201d Mu Mian\u2019s voice suddenly sounded from outside the door.\n Hearing the commotion, Mu Qiu panicked. \u201cCough cough!\u201d She couldn\u2019t help coughing again.\n But the bathroom was soundproof. Standing outside the room, Mu Mian didn\u2019t hear Mu Qiu coughing.\n [fuzzy]After waiting for a long time without hearing Mu Qiu\u2019s reply, Mu Mian felt uneasy. \u201cMu Qiu, what are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d As Mu Qiu had cut her own wrists to commit suicide once, Mu Mian was already on high alert. He was worried that Mu Qiu would commit suicide on the spot.\n The deafening sound of the door slamming scared Mu Qiu so much that she hurriedly stood up from the bathtub. She quickly put on her bathrobe, pressed down on her aching lungs, and shouted towards the door. \u201cFather, wait a moment. I am bathing.\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Mian stopped banging on the door.\n After standing at the door for three to four minutes, the door in front of Mu Mian was pulled open.\n He glanced down and saw Mu Qiu\u2019s pathetic state. Mu Qiu\u2019s hair was dripping wet and the water on her face had clearly been wiped off by a towel, but it was still wet.\n Her eyes seemed to have been washed by the cleanest water. At a glance, they were clear and bright, like the eyes of an angel who had fallen into the mortal world.\n \u201cAre you done bathing?\u201d Mu Mian stared at Mu Qiu\u2019s wet hair with his eyes dark.\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t dare to meet her father\u2019s eyes for fear of her lie being seen through. \u201cYes, I also washed my hair.\u201d\n Mu Mian chuckled. \u201cYou seldom wash your hair at night.\u201d Mu Qiu usually washed her hair early in the morning and then styled it.\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cI went to have barbeque with elder sister tonight. I smell like meat and won\u2019t be able to sleep until I wash my hair.\u201d\n Mu Mian seemed to believe her and didn\u2019t probe further. He strode into the room and closed the door behind him. Mu Qiu stared at the tightly shut door, feeling somewhat uneasy. Did Father detect something?\n \u201cWipe your hair.\u201d Mu Mian tossed a towel over Mu Qiu\u2019s head.\n Mu Qiu was filled with guilt and uneasiness, as she had almost commited suicie just now. She didn\u2019t even have the guts to face Mu Mian. She obediently held the towel and gently rubbed her wet hair.\n Mu Mian\u2019s eyes were filled with pain as he stared at his daughter\u2019s wavering figure. He could tell that Mu Qiu was lying and guessed what Mu Qiu had done in the bathroom. Mu Mian was very upset that he had nearly lost his daughter again.\n Recalling what he had learned today, he was even more determined to buy a healthy heart for Mu Qiu. \u201cMu Qiu, do you know of the Dark Web?\u201d Mu Mian suddenly asked.\n The room was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.\n The father-daughter duo exchanged glances. Mu Mian\u2019s eyes were dark, as if he was plotting something major. Mu Qiu\u2019s pupils quivered as a sense of uneasiness crept into her heart. \u201cFather, why are you asking about that?\u201d\n The so-called Dark Web was an illegal website for illegal transactions. The Dark Network was very deep and covered every corner of the Internet. It was like a vast ocean hidden under an iceberg, unfathomable.\n All those who had dealings with the Dark Net were people who had crossed their moral boundaries.\n \u201cFather, don\u2019t do illegal things.\u201d Mu Qiu didn\u2019t know what Mu Mian wanted to do, but his current state made her panic.\n Mu Mian licked his lips. He didn\u2019t dare to look straight into Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes. Instead, he gazed at the floor beneath him and said in a low voice, \u201cYou might not know this, but there are over a million people in our country who need an organ transplant every year. But only a small minority are willing to donate their organs after death. What do you think those who need an organ to save their lives should do?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was no longer a child. She was 20 years old and naturally knew that there were dark, dirty, and terrible deals hidden behind the beautiful society.\n She could guess what Mu Mian wanted to do. Her entire body swayed and her legs went weak. \u201cFather, that\u2019s not right. It\u2019s illegal. Once you\u2019re discovered, you will go to jail!\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s legs went soft as she knelt on the floor. Her knees rubbed against the floor as she moved to Mu Mian.\n Kneeling on the floor, Mu Qiu looked at Mu Mian with teary eyes. \u201cFather!\u201d Tears streamed down Mu Qiu\u2019s dainty face. She grabbed Mu Mian\u2019s cold hand as her heart clenched in pain.\n She begged Mu Mian. \u201cFather, I am begging you. Don\u2019t do that. I am not worth it!\u201d\n [fuzzy]Mu Mian\u2019s eyes were also red. He cupped Mu Qiu\u2019s cheeks and looked at his daughter\u2019s youthful and beautiful face. His heart ached. \u201cQiu-er, you are Father and Mother\u2019s baby. You are only 20 years old and your life has just reached its most brilliant stage. I cannot bear to see you die!\u201d\n \u201cYou are my darling. You are worthy of me doing anything for you!\u201d For her, Mu Mian could be a murderer or do anything illegal.\n He only wanted Mu Qiu to live!\n Mu Qiu shook her head vehemently. \u201cNo, no! I don\u2019t want you to do all this for me. Father, I\u2019d rather die than have you commit a crime for me!\u201d\n \u201cMu Qiu, listen to me. Father will be fine. I\u2019ve checked. Once this matter is exposed, I only need to be jailed for a few years. If a few years in prison can save your life, I feel it will be worth it!\u201d\n \u201cMoreover, I am still young. I will be healthy even after a few years in prison.\u201d Wiping away Mu Qiu\u2019s tears, Mu Mian kissed his daughter\u2019s head. His throat tightened as he choked. \u201cAs long as you can live on, everything will be worth it.\u201d\n Hearing that Mu Mian would only need to spend a few years in jail for that, Mu Qiu\u2019s tough heart suddenly sank.\n [fuzzy]She knew very well that she should advise Mu Mian not to continue making mistakes, but her urge to live was so strong. Who wants to die? I\u2019m only 20 years old and I had just met someone I liked. I wanted to get married and have a child with the person I loved.\n Mu Qiu was tempted.\n She hugged Mu Mian\u2019s waist gently and apologized tearfully. \u201cFather, I have harmed you. I\u2019m useless! Your daughter is unfilial...\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Qiu-er. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong!\u201d Mu Mian wiped his own tears and pushed Mu Qiu away. He stood up, took a deep breath, composed himself, and was about to leave Mu Qiu\u2019s room.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

He warned her. \u201cNo matter what, don\u2019t let your mother know about this.\u201d\n Mu Qiu answered tearfully, \u201c...Okay.\u201d\n Meanwhile, after parting ways with Mu Qiu, Song Ci was planning to head home directly. On the way, Song Ci received a call from Han Zhan.\n \u201cBrother Han, isn\u2019t there a dinner party? Why are you still free to call me?\u201d\n \u201cAs long as I want to, I can always spare the time.\u201d No matter how busy he was at work, it was impossible for him to be so busy that he didn\u2019t have time to make a call to greet her. It just depended on whether the other party took the person seriously.\n Han Zhan stood in front of the sink, stared at himself in the mirror, and told Song Ci, \u201cI\u2019ll be home around 9.30pm. If you\u2019re sleepy, go to bed first.\u201d Han Zhan knew that Song Ci was going to Li Yao\u2019s shop to try on a wedding dress today. He thought she would be home in the afternoon, but he heard the honking of a car on Song Ci\u2019s side. \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone back?\u201d\n Song Ci wound up the window before replying to Han Zhan. \u201cI had dinner with Mu Qiu tonight and I\u2019m heading home now.\u201d\n \u201cGo back early.\u201d Thinking of this, Han Zhan said, \u201cOh yes, I am going on a work trip tomorrow. Are you coming with me?\u201d Han Zhan looked forward to working together with Song Ci on overseas trips. It would definitely be very... exciting!\n Song Ci wanted to accompany Han Zhan on a work trip. She had recovered and it was time for her work to resume. \u201cOkay, how many days are you going for?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cFour days.\u201d\n \u201cGot it.\u201d\n After hanging up, Han Zhan turned off the tap and dried his hands, before leisurely returning to the meal. The meal was about to end and the group of people were all red-faced from drinking. They were almost unable to maintain their image as elite bosses.\n \u201cA new princess has arrived at the famous KTV. Shall we go take a look after the party ends?\u201d The person who spoke was a vice-president of the Aviation Administration called Du Shen. He was rather handsome and had a good figure. There was nothing wrong with his character\u2014he just loved beauty.\n Upon hearing this, all the men at the table smiled with an unspoken mutual understanding. \u201cManager Li, Mr. Han, shall we go and take a look together?\u201d Amongst these people, Han Zhan and Li Li were both considered young.\n Li Li hurriedly said, \u201cI won\u2019t join in the fun. My mother just had an operation and nearly lost her life. I have to go back and accompany her.\u201d Li Li had been using his mother as a shield recently.\n \u201cOh, what surgery did Manager Li\u2019s mother undergo? Was it successful?\u201d\n \u201cSigh, half of her uterus has been removed and she is in a bad mood. If I go back late, she will get angry.\u201d Everyone knew that Li Li was brought up by his single mother. Hearing his words, no one tried to force him.\n As a result, all the big shots turned to look at Han Zhan. \u201cMr. Han, what about you?\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled but didn\u2019t say anything. He put down his chopsticks and asked CEO Du with a smile, \u201cHow does the princess that CEO Du mentioned look like?\u201d Thinking that Han Zhan was moved, CEO Du Fu smiled mysteriously and said, \u201cOf course she\u2019s the best. I heard that she has a great figure.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan took out his cell phone at a steady pace. He found the photo of Song Ci being nominated as the nation\u2019s prettiest school belle the year before.\n Turning his cell phone so that the screen was facing out, Han Zhan raised it and showed it around the table. Everyone saw the stunning beauty on his cell phone screen.\n After confirming that everyone had seen Song Ci\u2019s photo, Han Zhan quickly placed his cell phone back on the table. He moved so quickly that it was as if he couldn\u2019t bear to let her be glanced at.\n Han Zhan looked up and asked, \u201cRegardless of how pretty she is, can she be as pretty as my wife?\u201d\n Everyone was speechless.\n How could a KTV princess compare with the top socialite\u2019s looks and outstanding charm?\n Han Zhan waved his gloved right hand in front of him and begged with a bitter smile. \u201cI am a handicap. It is not easy for me to marry such a beautiful wife. Everyone, please do me a favor and don\u2019t harm me.\u201d\n Since Han Zhan had already used his identity as a handicapped person, how could anyone bear to harm him? \u201cMr. Han must be joking.\u201d With such a gorgeous and beautiful wife like Song Ci at home, how could he still be interested in a prostitute?\n After the meal ended, Li Li and Han Zhan stood at the entrance of the restaurant to send off all the big shots. When everyone had left, Li Li raised his brows at Han Zhan and teased him. \u201cIs your wife controlling you too strictly?\u201d\n Not to be outdone, Han Zhan retorted. \u201cAre you a mommy\u2019s boy?\u201d\n The two men exchanged a meaningful smile.\n ...\n Song Ci walked out of the lift and noticed something amiss. There was a young lady sitting on the main seat of the lift!\n That girl was wearing a floral jacket, tight denim ripped jeans, shoes with doodles on them, and a black baseball cap with a light brown, dirty ponytail.\n It was a punk night club outfit.\n The girl crossed her legs, crossed her arms, leaned against the wall, lowered her head, and snored.\n Song Ci stared at the unfamiliar girl as many thoughts surfaced in her mind.\n Who is she?\n A little vixen who has a crush on Brother Han?\n Is it cooler to smash this woman awake with a bag or to kick her awake?\n All sorts of thoughts flashed across Song Ci\u2019s mind. Before she could even react, the girl who was dozing off suddenly lost her balance. Her body swayed and she nearly fell to the ground.\n The girl reacted quickly and grabbed the bench beneath her, so she didn\u2019t manage to fall.\n Seeing this, Song Ci felt rather regretful. She had already taken out her cell phone and was about to take a photo.\n The girl was completely jolted awake. Sensing that someone was standing in front of her, she adjusted her hat and looked up. Only when her face was revealed did Song Ci realize that this lady was not old\u2014at most 20 years old.\n She was even more tender than me.\n Could this person be Brother Han\u2019s relative?\n Song Ci, who had just wanted to throw the other party into the frying pan to fry, suddenly smiled sweetly. \u201cHello, little sister. Who are you looking for?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s face changed as if one was changing clothes.\n Song Ci\u2019s smile was devastatingly beautiful.\n In a daze, Han Wangwang suddenly saw a fairy-like face and was shocked. \u201cYou...\u201d Han Wangwang pointed at the door behind her and asked hesitantly,\u201d Is this Han Zhan\u2019s house? \u201d\n It was Han Wangwang\u2019s first time at Han Zhan\u2019s residence and she thought she had come to the wrong floor. This couldn\u2019t be Han Zhan\u2019s house\u2014I must have gotten the address wrong. It was impossible for Han Zhan\u2019s house to have such a gorgeous lady!\n She knew Han Zhan! She must be his relative!\n Song Ci smiled even more sweetly. She pointed at the main door and said, \u201cIt\u2019s Han Zhan\u2019s house. Little sister, who are you to Han Zhan?\u201d\n Han Wangwang suddenly went silent. She stared at Song Ci in shock and curiosity as to who exactly was Song Ci to Han Zhan. After a moment of awkward silence, Han Wangwang finally answered Song Ci. \u201cI am his niece. My name is Han Wangwang.\u201d\n Han Wangwang was indeed Han Zhan\u2019s niece. She was Han Zhan\u2019s cousin\u2019s daughter and also Han Zhan\u2019s mother\u2019s grandniece. Although his grandfather Han Aoyu didn\u2019t have any biological siblings, he still had a cousin called Han Wanglong in his family.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Han Aoyu\u2019s father fled to Hunan with Han Aoyu. Meanwhile, his elder uncle and his family went to Shunchen. Later, Han Aoyu joined the army to protect the country. After the country was stabilized, he went to look for his family.\n He was lucky and managed to find his only surviving family member\u2014his elder cousin Han Wanglong. Han Wanglong was just the captain of a steelmaking truck convoy in Shunchen City. However, his son \u2013 Han Dongliang \u2013 joined the military and achieved great results. In the end, he even became the director of the Army Engineering University.\n Meanwhile, Han Wangwang was Han Dongliang\u2019s eldest granddaughter.\n The Han Family was full of men but not many teenage girls.\n Han Wangwang was the apple of the Han Family\u2019s eye. Although she was dressed ridiculously, she was actually a very smart lady. Not only was she a member of the \u201cSecondary School Genius Plan\u201d, but she had also attended the world\u2019s top scientist conferences at the age of 15. She was exceptionally talented in mathematics.\n Most of the men in the Han Family had joined the military, even Han Zhan used to be an elite sniper. However, Han Wangwang\u2019s appearance would definitely add a female scientist to the Han Family. As a result, the Han Family doted on this beloved daughter of theirs.\n Song Ci knew that Han Zhan had a niece. It was said that she was only two years younger than her and was studying at Wangdong University. It seemed like she was this little girl.\n Han Wangwang looked at Song Ci in deep thought. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n A guess gradually formed in Han Wangwang\u2019s mind, but she was afraid that she might be overthinking things. The lady in front of me looked like myself. Little Uncle had always been steady, reliable, and upright. He wouldn\u2019t marry such a young wife... right?\n Song Ci smiled charmingly. \u201cHello Wangwang, my name is Song Ci. I am your Little Aunt.\u201d\n Han Wangwang widened her eyes as her thoughts came true.\n Indeed, men were true to themselves and would always love those who were 18 years old!\n My Little Uncle is also one of them...\n \u201cLittle... little auntie?\u201d Han Wangwang stared at her Little Auntie\u2019s overly exquisite and perfect face. Her heart thumped wildly as she asked somewhat suspiciously, \u201cAre you really my Little Uncle\u2019s wife? How old are you?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201c22.\u201d\n Just two years older than me!\n Han Wangwang cursed Han Zhan for being a beast and an animal in her heart. How could he lay his hand on a girl my age? However, upon seeing Song Ci\u2019s devastatingly beautiful face and soul-stirring eyes, Han Wangwang gave up on herself. Who wouldn\u2019t love such an obedient girl?\n \u201cCome in and sit down first. Han Zhan will be back soon.\u201d\n Seeing Song Ci take out the keys from her bag and successfully open the door to Han Zhan\u2019s house, Han Wangwang knew that this was true. Great-grandfather wasn\u2019t lying\u2014my little uncle is really married.\n Upon entering the house, Han Wangwang saw a woman\u2019s high heels in the cupboard, a woman\u2019s shawl on the sofa, and a navy blue grand piano by the French window. Han Wangwang looked down and thought to himself, \u201cLittle Uncle seems to dote on Little Auntie a lot.\u201d\n That\u2019s true. To be able to find such a beautiful wife at such an old age, Little Uncle must treat her better.\n \u201cDo you want coffee?\u201d Song Ci stood behind Han Wangwang and asked.\n Han Wangwang turned and took the coffee cup from Song Ci\u2019s hand. She said sheepishly, \u201cI don\u2019t think Little Uncle knows that I\u2019d be coming today. I went home last weekend and heard my grandfather mention that Little Uncle got married. I thought they were lying to me and wanted to come and see...\u201d\n Han Wangwang smiled in embarrassment. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be true. Little Uncle is really married.\u201d\n But Song Ci caught onto something. \u201cWhen did you arrive? Why didn\u2019t you call your Little Uncle?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve been here for more than an hour. Little Uncle\u2019s work is more important!\u201d\n Taking a peek at Song Ci\u2019s beautiful face, Han Wangwang asked her, \u201cLittle Auntie, are you a celebrity?\u201d\n Han Wangwang was from Shunchen City and didn\u2019t know much about the celebrities in Wangdong City. Naturally, she didn\u2019t know that Song Ci was Wangdong City\u2019s top socialite. This was the first time she saw someone as good-looking as Song Ci and thought she was a celebrity.\n Song Ci shrugged. \u201cI am a pilot.\u201d\n \u201cSo cool!\u201d\n Putting down her coffee cup, Han Wangwang sat down on the sofa. She asked Song Ci, \u201cAre you piloting a jet fighter or a passenger jet?\u201d\n Song Ci scratched her head sheepishly and said in a low voice, \u201cDriving a private jet\u2014I\u2019m your little uncle\u2019s private pilot.\u201d\n Han Wangwang clapped. \u201cSo cool!\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t this the beautiful wife and pilot of an overbearing CEO?\u201d Han Wangwang chuckled and said, \u201cWearing a uniform to fly in the sky, taking off the uniform to fly in bed, just the thought of it is exciting...\u201d\n With that, Han Wangwang met Song Ci\u2019s meaningful gaze and realized what she had said.\n She hurriedly covered her mouth and didn\u2019t dare to look at Song Ci.\n Did Little Auntie just discover my true horny appearance?\n Han Wangwang looked embarrassed.\n Song Ci calmly placed the teacup on the coffee table and said softly, \u201cActually, not taking it off is more exciting.\u201d\n Han Wangwang looked up in shock. The two ladies exchanged glances and both could tell that the other party was a kindred spirit. They smiled and felt a sense of mutual appreciation.\n Han Zhan walked out of the lift and heard the sound of impudent laughter coming from his own house. Han Zhan was stunned. Who came to my house? He opened the door pensively. Just as his hand touched the handle, the door was suddenly pulled open from inside.\n \u201cBrother Han!\u201d Song Ci was all smiles as she stood behind the door with someone hiding behind her. \u201cGuess who\u2019s here!\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at the person behind Song Ci. Although he couldn\u2019t see her face, he could see her little dirty braid. Han Zhan understood and said, \u201cWangwang Doggy, what are you hiding for?\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Wangwang Doggy?\n Han Wangwang, who was hiding behind Song Ci, suddenly jumped out like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.\n Standing beside Song Ci, Han Wangwang placed her hands on her hips and hollered at Han Zhan. \u201cLittle Uncle, I said you\u2019re not allowed to call me by my nickname!\u201d\n How can a beautiful and adorable little girl be called Wangwang Doggy?\n Han Zhan said, \u201cOh, I got it, Wangwang Doggy.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help and wanted to laugh, when Han Wangwang suddenly said, \u201cLittle Aunt, do you know what Little Uncle\u2019s nickname is?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed slightly as he shouted urgently, \u201cHan Wangwang!\u201d His tone was full of threat.\n Song Ci hurriedly walked up to Han Zhan, stood on tiptoe, covered his mouth, turned back, winked at Han Wangwang, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s Brother Han\u2019s nickname? Tell me so we can have fun together.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at Song Ci in disbelief*. Is this still my Baby Ci? How can she be so biased?*\n Han Wangwang snorted proudly at Han Zhan and said loudly, \u201cThree Fattie!\u201d\n Song Ci was momentarily stunned before bursting into laughter. Han Zhan\u2019s mouth was gagged, as he glared at Han Wangwang with dark eyes, as if wanting to bore holes into her body.\n Han Wangwang was not at all afraid of her little uncle\u2019s intimidation. She told Song Ci, \u201cLittle uncle was especially fat when he was young. He had a fat belly, a fat bum, and a fat chin. In short, he was three fattie! Great Grandpa still has many photos of him when he was young and fat!\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "126": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-127\n\n Chapter 126: A Slap In the Face will Never be Late  Relying on Song Ci\u2019s backing, Han Wangwang was fearless as she continued to smear Han Zhan\u2019s name. \u201cIs Little Uncle very self-disciplined and has to exercise every day? He\u2019s just afraid of gaining weight. He had a crush on the belle of his class when he was 12 years old, and was rejected when he confessed. The reason is that she doesn\u2019t like fat people.\u201d\n As Han Zhan\u2019s dark history was exposed one by one, Song Ci laughed so hard that her shoulders were shaking.\n Han Zhan had nothing left to live for. He just wanted to kill Han Wangwang. His tall, mighty, and handsome image in Song Ci\u2019s heart had finally collapsed.\n Only after Song Ci was done laughing did she finally bear to remove her hand from Han Zhan\u2019s mouth.\n Han Zhan could finally speak. His dangerous eyes stared straight at Han Wangwang as he said, \u201cWhat are you wearing? Did you go to a nightclub? I remember your father saying that he will break your legs if you go there again!\u201d\n As Han Zhan spoke, he took out his cell phone and pretended to take a photo of Han Wangwang. \u201cI\u2019ll send a photo to your father and let him see your wretched appearance. He will definitely send someone to beat you to death!\u201d\n Han Wangwang was most afraid of her father.\n Her father, Han Yueyun, was also a soldier when he was young. After that, he was discharged from the army due to an injury and was now the big boss of Shunchen City\u2019s political scene. Han Yueyun had a bad temper and hit his children regardless of gender. Han Wangwang had suffered countless beatings from her father.\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, Han Wangwang felt the flesh on her back hurting.\n Seizing the opportunity when Han Zhan was not looking, Han Wangwang suddenly reached out and hit the phone away from Han Zhan\u2019s hand. Taking advantage of the moment when Han Zhan lowered his head to pick up the phone, Han Wangwang quickly ran out of the main door.\n Standing in the lift lobby, Han Wangwang said loudly to Song Ci, \u201cLittle Aunt, I will come back another day to play with you!\u201d\n With that, Han Wangwang slipped away.\n Han Zhan picked up his cell phone and looked back at the empty lift. \u201cLittle dog!\u201d He closed the door and turned to meet Song Ci\u2019s half-smiling eyes.\n Mmm?\n Han Zhan said seriously, \u201cI am no longer a fatty.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. Her answer was very seductive. \u201cWhich part of Brother Han\u2019s body have I not seen before? I definitely know whether you are fat or not.\u201d\n Han Zhan heaved a sigh of relief, but seeing that Song Ci\u2019s expression was still so strange, he couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cThen why are you still looking at me like that?\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cHan Wangwang?\u201d\n Han Zhan thought she was asking about Han Wangwang\u2019s identity and hurriedly said, \u201cShe is my niece, the eldest daughter of my cousin Han Yueyun. Her great-grandfather is my grandfather\u2019s elder cousin.\u201d If this was any other family, there might not be much affection left, but the Han Family was different. Han Aoyu had weak descendants and he only had one daughter in this life, who had died young.\n As he had very few family members, Han Aoyu had always maintained a close relationship with his elder cousin\u2019s descendants.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI know. Wangwang has already explained it to me.\u201d\n Han Zhan realized that Song Ci\u2019s mocking smile was still on her face and was getting wider and wider. He felt even more lost. Like a guilty child, Han Zhan asked Song Ci softly, \u201cBaby Ci, what exactly are you trying to say?\u201d Did I do something wrong?\n Song Ci walked up to Han Zhan and sized him up. Brother Han looked righteous and upright but...\n Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cMy niece is only two years younger than you. I am not interested in little girls...\u201d\n Han Zhan felt that this sentence sounded somewhat familiar. Who said it before?\n Song Ci considerately answered Han Zhan\u2019s confusion. \u201cYou said it personally at the interview, when I met you for the first time. Brother Han, does your face hurt?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s face froze slightly.\n No wonder it sounded familiar, it came from my own mouth.\n After Song Ci purposely mentioned it, Han Zhan recalled what happened on the interview day and looked slightly embarrassed.\n Song Ci clenched her right fist and brought it to Han Zhan\u2019s lips. She smiled mischievously and asked Han Zhan, \u201cLet me interview you, Mr. Han Zhan. Don\u2019t you feel guilty sleeping with a young girl who is only two years older than your niece? Don\u2019t you feel ashamed?\u201d\n Han Zhan fidgeted for a few seconds before recovering his composure.\n He gazed deeply at Song Ci, making her cheeks heat up. She couldn\u2019t help but want to lower her head.\n ]Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cI also feel guilty sometimes, thinking of how I still deceived such a young and innocent girl at such an old age. What should I do? It\u2019s all because this young girl is too seductive, I can\u2019t control myself...\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s face was full of guilt, and his tone was very pained as he blamed himself.\n Even though she knew that Han Zhan was acting, Song Ci still couldn\u2019t help feeling soft-hearted.\n Brother Han is the real king of flirting. He can flirt with others without even realizing it. I can\u2019t win against him!\n Song Ci retracted her hand and said in a negative manner, \u201cForget it, forget it. I\u2019ll let you off this time! I\u2019m going to take a shower!\u201d\n After taking a shower, Song Ci played with her cell phone as she focused on maintaining her beauty. She changed Han Zhan\u2019s contact number from Brother Han to Brother Three Fattie. Song Ci couldn\u2019t help smiling as she stared at the name.\n Han Zhan had appeared behind her at some point. He looked down at his own name on Song Ci\u2019s cell phone and felt very conflicted. \u201cCan you not hurt me like this?\u201d Han Zhan acted very petty.\n Song Ci hurriedly kept her cell phone. Afraid that Han Zhan would secretly change her contact number, she said, \u201cI need to change my cell phone\u2019s unlocking sign.\u201d Saying that, she stood up from the dressing table, hurried to the bed, and jumped onto it.\n Hiding under the blanket, Song Ci changed the unlocking sign and heaved a sigh of relief. She put down her cell phone and saw Han Zhan sitting by the bed. He had no intention of snatching her cell phone. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d asked Song Ci.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI\u2019ll be busier at the end of the year. Baby Ci, how about we bring forward our honeymoon trip?\u201d\n Song Ci was pleasantly surprised. \u201cA honeymoon trip? Sure, where are we going for our honeymoon?\u201d\n Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d\n After thinking for a moment, Song Ci said, \u201cI want to go to Vienna.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly surprised. He said, \u201cI thought you would want to go to the Maldives or France.\u201d All the big shots that Han Zhan knew loved to go to the Maldives on their honeymoon trips. Han Zhan didn\u2019t think that there was anything fun about the seaside, but girls always yearned for the blue sky and the sea. He thought that Song Ci also wanted to go to the Maldives.\n Song Ci shook her head and explained. \u201cVienna is a city that every musician yearns for. My teacher...\u201d Seeing Han Zhan\u2019s shocked expression, Song Ci finally remembered that she had never told him about Shen Yubei.\n \u201cTeacher?\u201d Han Zhan asked, \u201cWhat teacher?\u201d\n Song Ci searched for Shen Yubei\u2019s entry on Baidu Encyclopedia. She placed the cell phone in Han Zhan\u2019s palm and told him, \u201cShen Yubei is my teacher. He is very capable and is a great violinist. He is famous worldwide.\u201d\n \u201cMy teacher was invited to perform in Vienna many times. Many years ago, I accompanied him.\u201d Song Ci recalled the \u201cpast\u201d of her youth and smiled a little despondently. \u201cAt that time, my biggest dream was to be like my teacher one day, standing in the Golden Hall and performing for the world.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "127": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-128\n\n Chapter 127: Song Fei Wakes Up  Han Zhan didn\u2019t know that Song Ci had such a brilliant past. Although Han Zhan didn\u2019t understand music, he knew how high Shen Yubei\u2019s position was in the music and arts circles. \u201cShen Yubei is very famous. I know him. Rongrong Godmother had collaborated with Teacher Shen Yubei before. I am also fortunate to have met him.\u201d\n As Shen Yubei\u2019s disciple, Song Ci must be very outstanding.\n Han Zhan had seen Song Ci play the violin at her birthday charity banquet. Song Ci, who played the violin, had an unspeakable allure.\n There was a question on Han Zhan\u2019s mind. He asked Song Ci, \u201cSince you like the violin so much, why did you become a pilot in the end?\u201d\n Song Ci felt very guilty. She lowered her head, looked at her own hands, and said despondently, \u201cWhen I was 14 years old, my parents and elder sister accompanied me to attend the National Violin Award for Adolescence. It was summer vacation then and we set off a few days in advance to travel around Bijiang City for a few days.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d encounter an earthquake...\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s face turned slightly pale as she thought of that dark period. \u201cAfter the earthquake, I suffered a serious psychological barrier and didn\u2019t dare to play the violin anymore. As long as I touched the violin, I would think of my bloodied parents and my unconscious sister. My hands would shake uncontrollably... I would never be able to play the violin again.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t expect such a dark past to lie behind Song Ci\u2019s abandonment of the violin.\n He grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hands. The right hand with broken fingers was slightly ugly on the back of Song Ci\u2019s fair hands. But at this moment, no one disliked it. Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cThen what made you pull yourself together again?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled sheepishly. \u201cIn my previous life, after my divorce with Cheng Ziang, I received some psychological treatment and gradually recovered.\u201d It was a blessing in disguise.\n Han Zhan frowned the moment he heard Cheng Ziang\u2019s name. He ignored the unhappiness in his heart and asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat made you want to be a pilot?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up with admiration. She lifted her head slightly and smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you before that I have a crush on someone?\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded silently and looked at her strangely.\n Song Ci glanced at Han Zhan carefully. Seeing that Han Zhan didn\u2019t mind her talking about her crush, she was relieved. Song Ci told Han Zhan, \u201cActually, my crush is part of the liberation army.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI see...\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cHe saved me and gave me a second life. He is my hero.\u201d\n \u201cHero?\u201d Han Zhan repeated this phrase with an indescribable complexity.\n Song Ci nodded vigorously. \u201cMmm, he is my hero, a true hero.\u201d Song Ci clutched her chest as her breathing became shallow. \u201cAfter the earthquake, I was trapped in the rubble for two days. It was that soldier from the People\u2019s Liberation Army who found me, but the God of Luck didn\u2019t look after us. Before he could rescue me, the aftershock happened. A dangerous building beside us collapsed and pinned both of us down.\u201d\n \u201cIn order to protect me, he used his body to protect me.\u201d\n \u201cDuring those few days when I was pinned down, he was the one who kept talking to me. He told me about his mother, his grandfather, and his dreams.\u201d Song Ci shook her head and smiled. She said, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t even get to see what he looked like. Under those circumstances, everyone was covered in soot and dirt. It would be strange if I could see his face clearly. But I just like him. He is especially warm and can sing for me, even though his singing is terrible.\u201d\n Han Zhan was strangely silent for a moment. Before Song Ci could speak again, Han Zhan suddenly asked her, \u201cDoes he sing very badly?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, I have never seen anyone with such a poor voice. Not a single sentence was sung correctly.\u201d Although he was her crush, Song Ci was merciless when it came to criticizing him.\n Han Zhan\u2019s face darkened. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that he can\u2019t sing a single sentence correctly.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cWhy would I lie to you? He\u2019s really tone-deaf.\u201d\n Han Zhan remained silent.\n Song Ci glanced at Han Zhan and asked, \u201cWhy are you suddenly silent? Are you jealous?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head with mixed feelings. \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d\n Han Zhan changed the subject and asked her, \u201cWhat has this got to do with you being a pilot?\u201d\n Song Ci pouted. \u201cThe brother from the People\u2019s Liberation Army told me that he thinks female military pilots are the most attractive. He said that his mother used to be a female pilot, the type who flew fighter planes. Since I liked him, I had to be the most attractive woman.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly shocked. \u201cJust because of this?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Song Ci was actually a very simple-minded and brainless person. After realizing that she couldn\u2019t play the violin anymore, she set her goal of becoming a female flight pilot.\n Unfortunately, due to her injuries from the earthquake and a long scar on her waist, she was rejected during the interview. To settle for the next best thing, she could only fly a private jet.\n Han Zhan stroked her hair and told her, \u201cIf that soldier knew that a little girl worked so hard for his words, he would be very heartened.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cReally.\u201d\n Song Ci was satisfied. She laid down on the pillow and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Austria for our honeymoon. Brother Han, will you accompany me to the Golden Hall to watch a performance?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n That night, the newlyweds were talking about their honeymoon arrangements.\n The young girl, who was nearing the end of her life, was drowning in guilt towards her father and her desire to live on.\n The man, who was afraid to sleep at night, was still working late at the set.\n In a certain corner of the city, on a spacious bed, a sleeping woman slowly opened her eyes that had been shut for eight years!\n The dim light shone into Song Fei\u2019s eyes.\n She gradually opened her eyes. After getting used to the brightness, she started to size up her surroundings.\n All around her was darkness, but she could make out some faint outlines of furniture.\n Song Fei was bewildered. Where am I?\n But Song Fei calmed down very quickly. She tried to get up but her body was so limp and weak that she couldn\u2019t even get up.\n Song Fei laid quietly for a while before propping herself up again. Gritting her teeth, she sat up. Slowly, she shifted her legs to the side of the bed and stepped on the wooden floor. She tried to stand up but failed the first time. She failed the second time. The third time, she stood up and collapsed to the floor.\n After struggling on the floor for a long time, Song Fei finally stood up with the help of the cupboard beside the bed. Her malnourished body kept trembling as she stood up. She took one shaky step and stood there for a while, before taking another.\n Pa!\n She turned on the lights.\n The blinding light entered her eyes and Song Fei suddenly shut her eyes. After a moment, she slowly opened them and observed her own room with a pair of cold eyes that were very similar to Song Ci\u2019s.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

The man was exceptionally handsome and gave Song Fei a familiar yet strange feeling.\n Song Fei stared at the poster on the wall, deep in thought. After guessing this man\u2019s identity, she was stunned.\n Since when did that coward in my memory become so good-looking?\n ...\n After the set ended, the assistant drove Yan Jiang home. Knowing that Yan Jiang hated the dark, the assistant turned to ask him, \u201cBrother Jiang, do you want me to accompany you into the house?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was sleeping.\n He was truly very sleepy, but only dared to close his eyes for a short rest when the car was lit up and someone was accompanying him.\n Hearing his assistant\u2019s words, Yan Jiang opened his eyes immediately.\n He shook his head slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. You should go back and rest early.\u201d With that, he pushed open the car door, stepped out of the car, and walked towards the main entrance of his house. Yan Jiang opened the main door of his courtyard and his tall and slender figure disappeared into the streetlights of his yard. The assistant started the car and drove away.\n The moment he entered the house, Yan Jiang turned on all the lights on the first level. The house was instantly lit up. Only then did Yan Jiang feel at ease.\n He went straight to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, found a bottle of cold water, and took a few sips. He went upstairs to the playroom, turned on the computer, turned up the volume to the maximum, and played a rock rap.\n Yan Jiang returned to his room as he listened to the rap. He walked over to the bed and gave Song Fei a nutritional injection, before removing his clothes and walking towards the bathroom door.\n The water flowed on Yan Jiang\u2019s body and swept away his sleepiness.\n After showering, he casually wiped his body and walked out. When he came out, Yan Jiang was naked and not wearing a bathrobe. He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to find a towel to cover his waist area.\n Anyway, he was the only one awake in this house. Without an audience, it didn\u2019t matter whether he wore it or not.\n Yan Jiang was humming a tune as he sat in the cloakroom, looking for the pyjamas he was going to wear tonight. His movements were bold and indecent. He didn\u2019t notice at all that a discreet gaze was fixed on him, taking in everything she should and shouldn\u2019t see.\n Yan Jiang put on his clothes and sat down on the bed. He bent down and placed his ear on Song Fei\u2019s chest to listen to her heartbeat. He was even counting the beats of her heart. \u201cKnock knock! Knock knock! Knock knock!\u201d\n Yan Jiang listened for a long while, before sitting up and speaking to Song Fei happily. \u201cWifey, your heartbeat is so strong today!\u201d\n Song Fei, who was pretending to be asleep, was speechless.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes were especially bright. He took out his notebook from the drawer of his dresser and jotted down today\u2019s observation. He wrote: [Today, my wife\u2019s heartbeat is slightly faster and more energetic than before. Is she going to wake up soon?]\n Yan Jiang pursed his lips in silence for a few seconds, before closing the notebook and putting it back.\n He sat on the bed for a long time. At 3am, Yan Jiang then went to the gaming room to turn off his laptop.\n The huge house was completely silent.\n Once the night fell silent, Yan Jiang felt uneasy. He hurried back to his room, burrowed under the blankets, hugged Song Fei\u2019s overly slender waist, buried his head in her neck, and sniffed. Only then did he not feel so scared.\n \u201cGood night, wifey.\u201d\n With that, Yan Jiang kissed Song Fei on the shoulder and closed his eyes to try to fall asleep. After about 30 minutes, Yan Jiang\u2019s breathing finally slowed down. He was still hugging Song Fei tightly like an insecure child.\n Even when he was asleep, Yan Jiang\u2019s room had a wall lamp on.\n Song Fei opened her eyes and turned slightly to look at the young head on her neck. She wanted to push Yan Jiang away with her head, but he was holding her like an octopus and she couldn\u2019t move at all.\n Wifey...\n To hell with him!\n Song Fei was still in a daze as she mulled over some matters. In her low spirits, she quickly fell asleep again.\n The next day, when Song Fei woke up, Yan Jiang was nowhere to be seen, as he must have gone to work. Song Fei took off the nutrition needles and poured them all into the toilet. Throughout the entire process, Song Fei\u2019s steps were unsteady. Every two steps she took, she would stop to rest.\n She was truly hungry and her stomach felt like it was on fire. Song Fei held onto the railing as she made her way downstairs. She went to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. She saw that it was filled with all sorts of drinks and fruits. She fell silent.\n There was actually nothing edible in such a huge refrigerator. How can it just be all drinks? Father was right. One would become foolish if they drank too many drinks. Yan Jiang was the best example.\n She would faint from hunger if she didn\u2019t eat soon.\n Song Fei returned upstairs and went into Yan Jiang\u2019s cloakroom. She found a black and white blouse to change into, as well as a pair of casual pants and a baseball cap. She changed into a pair of pants and rolled them up twice. She put on the baseball cap and smashed Yan Jiang\u2019s piggy bank. She then took Yan Jiang\u2019s bag and left home with the 200 yuan note.\n Walking along the bustling streets, Song Fei felt slightly uncomfortable.\n All these years in a vegetative state, Song Fei was actually conscious. She knew everything that the people around her said and did. But strangely, she just couldn\u2019t wake up.\n Song Fei knew that she had been in a coma for eight years. She knew that her parents were dead. She knew that Song Ci, that little fool, had been bullied. She knew that the person who bullied them was on the loose. She also knew that a gutsy little coward was calling her his wife and hugging her to sleep every night...\n Walking into a porridge shop, Song Fei glanced at the menu and stared at the numbers and words. After a moment of daze, she counted 18 coins from her black shoulder bag and tossed them onto the table in front of the boss.\n \u201cA bowl of porridge made from fish slices. Make it thinner and more mushy.\u201d Having not spoken for so many years, Song Fei was shocked herself. Her voice was slightly hoarse and chilly, like the snow at the North Pole.\n Most people nowadays loved to use Alipay and WeChat to scan their QR codes. Few people even used cash, let alone coins. The boss looked at Song Fei strangely and smiled. \u201cYou can also use WeChat to scan Alipay.\u201d\n Song Fei was stunned.\n Wechat Alipay?\n Song Fei became comatose in 2012. In 2012, her WeChat account was just created and the platform was far from being well-known. Meanwhile, Alipay was only used by Taobao users. Back then, on the streets, everyone used cash and most of the time, they used credit cards to buy expensive items. It was not like now, where they could just buy anything they wanted by scanning a code.\n \u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d Song Fei appeared very calm.\n The boss didn\u2019t say anything. He counted the coins and confirmed that there was no lack of money, before letting Song Fei into the house. \u201cCome in and sit for a while. It will be done soon.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

She could only eat the softest and most tender foods. After leisurely drinking half a bowl of porridge, Song Fei finally came to life.\n Leaving the breakfast shop, she entered a dark internet cafe.\n Turning on the browser, Song Fei remained silent for a moment, before placing her hand on the keyboard. Having not moved in so many years, she was still slightly unfamiliar with the keyboard. But very quickly, her fingers became nimble and fast.\n She entered a sentence on the webpage:\n How to use WeChat to pay?\n After spending a few minutes to figure out what Alipay and WeChat were, Song Fei didn\u2019t find out more. She stayed in the internet cafe for another hour and checked on some things before leaving.\n Returning home, Song Fei found a piece of white A4 paper and wrote down one name after another.\n Mu Mian, Mu Qiu, Du Tingting, Song Ci, Han Zhan, the doctor, Cheng Yanmo, Cheng Ziang, organ intermediary...\n Song Fei wrote many things on that piece of paper. After getting to the bottom of the situation, she came up with a bold and crazy plan.\n ...\n Han Zhan was going to Shenyang on this business trip.\n Song Ci flew alongside him. Due to the accident, she had been recuperating for some time. She went back to work today, but she was still sitting on the observer\u2019s seat.\n It had been a long time since Song Shiqing last saw Song Ci. Song Shiqing smiled and asked her, \u201cMiss Song...\u201d Thinking that Song Ci and Han Zhan were already married, Song Shiqing changed his words.\u201d Madam, are you better now? \u201d\n Song Ci blushed. \u201cCall me Song Ci, don\u2019t call me Madam.\u201d They were colleagues and it felt awkward to be addressed as Madam.\n Song Shiqing nodded. \u201cAlright, Song Ci.\u201d\n Only then did Song Ci answer Song Shiqing\u2019s previous question. Thank you for your concern, but my injuries have already recovered. I haven\u2019t thanked you seriously, as you and Brother Xiong had arrived timely to save me. When we reach Shenyang, I\u2019ll treat you guys to a meal.\u201d\n Song Ci later heard from Li Li that on the day of her accident, Xiong Jian was worried about her condition and specially called her before flying. Only then did he know about her accident.\n Song Shiqing waved his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so polite.\u201d\n Xiong Jian also suddenly turned around and stared at Song Ci. He warned her sternly. \u201cIn the future, you can\u2019t just look ahead while driving. You must also pay attention to the left and right sides of the road. Just because you drive in a civilized manner, it doesn\u2019t mean that others also drive in the same way. You only have one life and you must cherish it. Just take this as a lesson learnt.\u201d\n Xiong Jian and the rest didn\u2019t know that there was something fishy about Song Ci\u2019s accident, so they were really saying this for her own good.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart warmed slightly. She smiled sweetly at Xiong Jian. \u201cAlright, I will remember it.\u201d\n Being attacked by Song Ci\u2019s sweetness, Xiong Jian coughed unnaturally and turned to say to Song Shiqing, \u201cGet ready to take off.\u201d\n The plane took off very quickly. As it took off, Song Ci leaned against the seat behind her. She opened her eyes to look at the rays of the rising sun. Her limp body finally regained its strength.\n It was not even noon when they arrived at Shenyang.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan left together. In the car, Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d\n \u201cNot bad, I feel quite comfortable.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n The Jetta International Hotel also had a branch in Shenyang. The group of them stayed at the Jetta Shenyang branch. Song Ci and Han Zhan stayed in the presidential suite and ate lunch in the hotel cafeteria. After lunch, Song Ci went to bed, while Han Zhan brought a few colleagues to meet the representative of Shen Fei Group.\n Zeus Number 1 was a super high-tech product with over 6 million body parts. Zeus Airlines had very high standards for every single part. The company had entrusted the manufacturing of Zeus Number 1\u2019s parts to hundreds of manufacturers worldwide. Han Zhan had come to Shenyang this time to observe the manufacturing standards of the aircraft manufacturing plant and the character of their collaborators.\n There were only two things that Han Zhan valued the most when collaborating with others. The first was their technique, and the second was the image of the corporation. If one had good skills and had a bad image in the corporation, one would still be unqualified.\n Two men and a woman were in charge of welcoming Han Zhan. The woman was in her early thirties and had an upright and gracious manner. She was the deputy manager of Shen Fei Group called Liu Yun. Liu Yun brought Han Zhan to the factory and spent the entire afternoon there.\n At night, Liu Yun organized a dinner party and had dinner with Han Zhan and the rest. At the dinner party, the other party tried to sound out Han Zhan\u2019s thoughts and after confirming that he was not interested in the foot-washing related things, she personally sent Han Zhan back to the hotel.\n Arriving at the hotel, Liu Yun stopped the car. Seeing that Han Zhan was looking down and sending a message, she chuckled and reminded Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, we have already arrived at the hotel. I see that you are slightly drunk. Shall I send you up?\u201d At some point, Liu Yun\u2019s suit jacket had been undone, and her tight blouse accentuated her sexy and fit figure.\n Han Zhan looked up and inadvertently saw this scene. He quickly looked away as if he hadn\u2019t seen anything.\n Han Zhan spoke politely and coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s already very tiring for Manager Liu to send me back personally. The hotel staff has very good service and they will send me back to my room. I won\u2019t trouble you to continue rushing around.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Manager Liu, for your explanation today. It\u2019s getting late and you should go home early to rest.\u201d With that, Han Zhan opened the car door, bent over, got out of the car, and strode into the hotel without turning back.\n Liu Yun stared at Han Zhan\u2019s tall and elegant back view with dark eyes.\n Whether this Han Zhan was really as calm as still water and could resist temptation, or was he just as scheming, Liu Yun could see it clearly with her eyes. He was really not interested in the sex trade.\n No one liked to exchange their bodies for business. Liu Yun secretly heaved a sigh of relief as she avoided some trouble.\n ...\n Song Ci was having a good time staying alone in the presidential suite. She took a bath and had a full-body spa. When Han Zhan returned, Song Ci was lying in the king-sized bed watching a movie.\n Han Zhan glanced at the screen and saw that Song Ci was watching a minor German movie. \u201cWhat movie is this?\u201d Han Zhan understood German but didn\u2019t know much about German movies.\n \u201cHeidi and Grandpa.\u201d Song Ci patted the empty seat beside her and signaled for Han Zhan to sit down. Han Zhan walked over and sat beside her. He smelled her delicate fragrance and asked her, \u201cWhat shower gel did you use?\u201d\n \u201cI went for a spa this afternoon and used vanilla scented essential oils. Does it smell good?\u201d Song Ci pulled down her clothes, revealing her fair and smooth shoulders. \u201cLook, did my skin become smoother?\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that amazing.\u201d\n Song Ci pouted. \u201cThat lady said I am so fair that I glow.\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly thought of the sales lady who had deceived him into drinking nutritional tea. \u201cDon\u2019t believe them. They are all liars.\u201d\n Song Ci snorted. She smelled something and suddenly leaned over to Han Zhan\u2019s side. Song Ci\u2019s nose twitched on Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder and she suddenly said, \u201cPerfume. A woman\u2019s.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled. \u201cWere you born in the year of the dog?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "130": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-131\n\n Chapter 130: Call Her Sister Fei  Song Ci stopped staring at the movie. She poked Han Zhan\u2019s arm and asked him, \u201cDid they send you a woman?\u201d Song Ci grew up in the Mu Family and knew all sorts of dirty business dealings.\n Although she knew that this was normal, Song Ci still felt rather conflicted. She didn\u2019t mind Han Zhan\u2019s past, but she couldn\u2019t accept Han Zhan fooling around after marriage.\n Han Zhan looked at Song Ci rather sternly. Seeing his serious expression, Song Ci also calmed down. Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYou are my wife. I will never do anything to let my wife down.\u201d\n \u201cThey did send a woman but I didn\u2019t touch her. I didn\u2019t even look at her.\u201d What Han Zhan said was the truth. He also knew that it was hard for Song Ci to believe him without any evidence, but he had no choice and could only explain plainly.\n Song Ci gave him a meaningful look but didn\u2019t pursue the matter.\n She looked like she didn\u2019t care about this matter, but Han Zhan wasn\u2019t sure. He couldn\u2019t tell if Song Ci was really calm now or she was just pretending to be magnanimous. Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I always have a listening device on me when I go out in the future? You can listen to me anytime and I definitely won\u2019t take it off.\u201d\n For someone of Han Zhan\u2019s status to say such words meant that he really valued Song Ci.\n A smile finally spread across Song Ci\u2019s face. She suddenly said, \u201cI am not interested in eavesdropping on your business secrets. If you really want to reassure me, why don\u2019t I go to Taobao and customize a chastity lock for you?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression finally changed. \u201cSo ruthless?\u201d\n ]Song Ci just smiled but didn\u2019t make things difficult for him. She continued watching the movie and Han Zhan asked her again, \u201cWhat did you eat tonight?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cFruit salad.\u201d\n Han Zhan leaned over and sniffed at the side of Song Ci\u2019s mouth. He said, \u201cYou ate cherry tomatoes?\u201d Han Zhan was very sensitive to scent and could even tell if Song Ci had already brushed her teeth.\n Song Ci nodded.\n Han Zhan added, \u201cI want to eat it too.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll get the front desk to send some over.\u201d Saying that, she pretended to reach for the landline phone by the bed. Han Zhan suddenly grabbed her arm and pressed her onto the pillow. He looked down at her and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a ready-made one here. Why trouble the front desk?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cHmm?\u201d Before she could understand Han Zhan\u2019s meaning, her lips were kissed by him. The old hooligan savored the taste of the cherry tomatoes before letting go of Song Ci.\n He gazed at the blushing Song Ci and praised her sincerely. \u201cIt tastes pretty good.\u201d\n Song Ci wrapped her arms around his neck and breathed seductively onto his face. \u201cThere\u2019s something even better. Do you want to try it?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s thumb gently rubbed Song Ci\u2019s eyelids. He seemed to especially love her eyes and kept looking for an opportunity to touch them. \u201cIs this an invitation?\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s voice was hoarse and his gaze towards her was getting increasingly intense. He couldn\u2019t hide his desire.\n Song Ci pointed at the complete set of tools by the bed. \u201cThe hotel is so considerate. We can\u2019t waste them, right?\u201d\n \u201cMadam is right.\u201d\n After a passionate conclusion, Song Ci was reduced to a broken porcelain doll.\n She laid her head on Han Zhan\u2019s stomach and curled up her soft body slightly. Song Ci played with Han Zhan\u2019s right hand and carefully sized up the scars on his broken fingers. Having gotten used to seeing them, Song Ci didn\u2019t feel that those fingers were ugly anymore.\n Han Zhan also thought it through and didn\u2019t hide that hand anymore, allowing Song Ci to play with it as she wished. Song Ci gradually got sleepy and directly leaned on Han Zhan to sleep. Han Zhan adjusted her position and was also preparing to sleep.\n Like Song Ci, Han Zhan habitually turned his cell phone to silent mode before sleeping. He was about to unlock his cell phone when he saw an unread message.\n Who is it?\n Han Zhan opened his WeChat and realized that he suddenly had a friend called S.\n Who is this?\n Did my old friend change his WeChat name?\n S: [Is Song Ci by your side?]\n A glint flashed across Han Zhan\u2019s eyes.\n He asked: [You are?]\n The reply was concise but shocking: [Song Fei.]\n Han Zhan was stunned.\n Song Fei? She\u2019s awake!\n Song Fei sent another message: [Avoid that little fool, I have something to tell you.]\n Han Zhan suppressed the tumultuous waves in his heart. He turned back to look at Song Ci, who was snoring softly. Holding his cell phone, he quietly got out of bed and walked out of the master bedroom. Passing through the tearoom outside the master bedroom, he arrived at the office on the other end. Han Zhan shut the door properly before sitting down on the chair.\n He stared at his cell phone in a daze for a moment, before sending a message to Song Fei.\n [How can you prove that you are Song Fei?]\n Song Fei pursued speed and efficiency. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to explain and just made a call.\n Han Zhan was flustered to suddenly have to meet his wife\u2019s family. After stabilizing himself, Han Zhan finally accepted the video call. Once Song Fei\u2019s face appeared on screen, Han Zhan knew that this person was her.\n The two sisters looked very much like each other, except that their temperaments were very different. They had the same facial features, but Song Ci\u2019s eyes were filled with stars, making her look both charming and alluring. Meanwhile, Song Fei\u2019s eyes were like a world of ice and snow, making one shiver at the sight of her.\n Without waiting for Han Zhan to speak, Song Fei said, \u201cJust call me elder sister like that little fool.\u201d Feeling that calling her elder sister was too friendly, Song Fei added, \u201cCall me Sister Fei.\u201d Sister Fei was really not polite.\n The 32 year old Han Zhan stared at the 22 year old Song Fei and found it difficult to speak. But since Song Fei had spoken, Han Zhan didn\u2019t dare to disobey. He called out awkwardly, \u201cSister Fei.\u201d\n Song Fei nodded coldly. \u201cMmm.\u201d She stared at Han Zhan for a long while before suddenly commenting. \u201cAlthough you are slightly older, you look steady and reliable. You are also considered talented and compatible with that little fool.\u201d\n Barely acceptable...\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t dare to retort and just listened obediently.\n Song Fei had finally woken up after sleeping for so many years. If Song Ci knew of this, she would definitely be overjoyed. Song Fei was Song Ci\u2019s only family. He couldn\u2019t afford to offend Song Fei, as it would definitely not end well for him.\n Seeing that Han Zhan did not say much, Song Fei gave him the label of being a man of few words and was even more satisfied with him.\n Han Zhan finally found an opportunity to ask Song Fei, \u201cWhen did you wake up? Does Song Ci know about this?\u201d\n Song Fei shook her head. \u201cI just woke up yesterday morning and haven\u2019t told her yet.\u201d Song Fei suddenly fell silent. After a moment, she said, \u201cI have a plan that I need your help with, so it\u2019s temporarily not convenient for me to tell Song Ci that I\u2019ve woken up. I will tell her when she returns to Wangdong.\u201d\n Nodding, Han Zhan asked her again, \u201cWhat do you need my help for?\u201d\n Song Fei took a deep look at Han Zhan. That look was soul-piercing. Han Zhan sat still, his expression as calm as water, which was very reassuring.\n Song Fei finally looked away and started narrating her plan.\n The young and beautiful girl used her coldest and most composed voice to narrate a meticulous and cruel plan for revenge. Han Zhan listened silently. As Song Fei narrated, goosebumps rose on Han Zhan\u2019s back.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

She was far superior to that little girl Song Ci.\n Song Ci was right. Her elder sister, Song Fei, was very smart. Not only was she smart, she was also very good at reading people\u2019s hearts and strategizing. Han Zhan secretly felt fortunate that his Baby Ci was a little fool and didn\u2019t have such a sharp mind. Otherwise, life would definitely be very different.\n For a moment, Han Zhan even felt some pity for Yan Jiang. If he fell in love with such a beautiful snake, Yan Jiang might not have a good life in the future.\n Song Fei had just finished talking about her plan, when she heard the sound of Yan Jiang\u2019s car driving downstairs. Song Fei said to Han Zhan, \u201cI\u2019ll hang up first. I\u2019ll contact you again.\u201d Song Fei logged out of WeChat, wiped off her log-in from the computer, and returned to her room.\n After spending more than a week filming the MV scenes, Yan Jiang finally felt relaxed. He entered the house and turned on all the lights on the first floor. Yan Jiang entered the kitchen and took a bottle of beer from the fridge. He wanted to drink some alcohol to relax.\n Gripping the beer, Yan Jiang walked into the living room. He felt like something was missing. He returned to the kitchen and opened the bottom drawer of the refrigerator to prepare a fruit salad.\n Life required a ritual like salad with beer.\n He remembered that Ah Lun\u2019s assistant had sent strawberries over yesterday. Yan Jiang wanted to make a strawberry salad. Although he was over 1.8 meters tall, he loved strawberries deeply.\n Yan Jiang opened the drawer and reached for the strawberries. He was stunned when he reached inside.\n \u201cWhere are the strawberries?\u201d\n There were only a few lemons, oranges, and a box of cherry tomatoes in the drawer, but his milk strawberries had disappeared!\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n Returning to his senses, Yan Jiang hurriedly called his assistant. \u201cAh Lun, did you come over to my house yesterday morning and bought me a box of strawberries?\u201d\n Ah Lun looked dumbstruck but still answered honestly, \u201cYes, you said you wanted to eat milk strawberries. When I went to fetch you, I specially brought you the biggest box of milk strawberries.\u201d\n Not knowing what was happening at Yan Jiang\u2019s side, Ah Lun asked worriedly, \u201cBrother Jiang, what happened?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s expression was very ugly. He said grimly, \u201cThere might be thieves in my house!\u201d Robbers who stole strawberries!\n Thinking that a person was still hiding in his room, Yan Jiang hurried upstairs. His heart was racing and he was sweating profusely.\n Pushing open the door to the master bedroom, Yan Jiang felt like he had just survived a disaster, when he saw that Song Fei was still lying on the bed perfectly fine.Walking over to the bed, he knelt down and held Song Fei\u2019s warm hand. Yan Jiang sighed with a lingering fear. \u201cThank goodness you weren\u2019t stolen, wifey!\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Fei really wanted to knock Yan Jiang\u2019s head open and see how he grew up. There was a person lying in the bedroom at home. Shouldn\u2019t he have thought of the reason why he had lost something?\n Song Fei remained silent and played the role of a vegetable seriously.\n Yan Jiang chatted with Song Fei for a while, talking about all the trivial matters at work today. Song Fei felt drowsy listening to him and eventually fell asleep.\n After talking about his work experience today, Yan Jiang kissed Song Fei\u2019s finger before getting up to go to the study. As there was someone hiding at home, Yan Jiang was afraid that something would happen to Song Fei, so he installed surveillance cameras at home.\n Arriving at the study, Yan Jiang was about to turn on the surveillance screen when his cell phone suddenly rang. It was his manager, Brother Lan.\n Yan Jiang leaned against the table and answered the call. \u201cBrother Lan, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Brother Lan asked, \u201cAre you in a relationship?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was puzzled. \u201cWhat scandal did I get into with Du Xueyan again?\u201d Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t think of any other possibility and thought that he and Du Xueyan had been involved in another scandal. \u201cLet me tell you that I am in a purely collaborative relationship with Du Xueyan. There is no ambiguity at all.\u201d\n But Brother Lan said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with Du Xueyan.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was slightly taken aback. \u201cOh, what happened then?\u201d There were many gossips when one was popular. Yan Jiang was always involved in them and was always plagued by scandals.\n \u201cA reporter went to your doorstep today and took some photos...\u201d It was a long story. Lan Ling reminded Yan Jiang.\u201d Go and take a look yourself. Give me a call after you see it and explain everything to me. \u201cBrother Lan hung up.\n Facing the phone that had been hung up, Yan Jiang muttered. \u201cRidiculous. What kind of shady things can my house capture...\u201d With that, he opened Weibo. Once he entered the trending page, he saw the word \u2018Explosion\u2019 at the top.\n Yan Jiang was cohabiting with a mysterious woman!\n Yan Jiang\u2019s expression darkened slightly. He opened that trending topic. The first article he saw was the most widely discussed news article by netizens. There were photos, videos, and even detailed comments by reporters.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s heart stopped beating when he saw the woman in the photo wearing a black and white blouse and a hat.\n Yan Jiang suddenly locked the screen of his cell phone. He took a deep breath and glanced at the door of the study. He could hear his own thunderous heartbeat. His blood was racing from excitement.\n Yan Jiang looked down, unlocked his cell phone, opened the photo, and zoomed in.\n It was a woman wearing his shirt and entering his house. She was slender, had short hair that reached her ears, and wore a baseball cap. Her fair face was not fully captured on camera, but Yan Jiang could recognize her from just one side.\n How could he not know the person who had been by his side all day and night?\n Yan Jiang opened the video again. He stared at his cell phone screen as the woman who had stolen his clothes and carried his backpack strutted out of his house.\n She walked rather slowly, like a toddler who had just learned how to walk. She took each step carefully and even took several steps before resting her eyes on the wall.\n Under the revelations, the netizens were abuzz \u2014\n First post: Wearing Brother Jiang\u2019s clothes and pants, carrying Brother Jiang\u2019s bag, and wearing Brother Jiang\u2019s hat. If she isn\u2019t Brother Jiang\u2019s girlfriend, I will eat sh*t on a live-stream.\n Second post: Making a mountain out of a molehill. This is Brother Jiang\u2019s good friend, Ms. Song. As everyone knows, the two of them are very close.\n Third post: To be honest, this woman does resemble Song X. But here comes the question: Is it normal for a married woman to wear the pants of a friend of the opposite sex and walk out of her friend\u2019s house so early in the morning?\n Fourth comment: I pity Ms. Song\u2019s husband.\n Fifth comment: Are they really just friends?\n Sixth comment: But Song Ci is in Shenyang today. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can look at her profile page. She even posted a video of her in the tub.\n ...\n Unknowingly, Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes had turned red. He gripped the cell phone so tightly that his knuckles turned white.\n It isn\u2019t Song Ci at all. It is Song Fei!\n Yan Jiang had no idea how he got back to the master bedroom. He stood by the bed and gazed down at the motionless Song Fei, as if she was still in a comatose state.\n He clenched his fists before loosening them again repeatedly.\n Yan Jiang finally spoke after a while.\n \u201cYou woke up, right?\u201d Yan Jiang\u2019s voice was hoarse and one could clearly hear that he had cried.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Sitting down on the bed, Yan Jiang gazed at Song Fei\u2019s lovely face. \u201cSong Fei, when you left my house this morning, a reporter took a photo of you.\u201d\n After Yan Jiang said this, he saw Song Fei\u2019s lashes quiver. Seeing this, Yan Jiang suddenly became agitated. He grabbed Song Fei\u2019s hand and said hoarsely, \u201cIt\u2019s really you. You\u2019re awake, right, Song Fei?\u201d\n Song Fei couldn\u2019t pretend anymore. She slowly opened her eyes and saw a handsome face that looked like it was about to cry. Song Fei was in a daze. Eight years had passed and that coward didn\u2019t get much bolder. Instead, he\u2019s even more weepy.\n \u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d Song Fei scoffed in disdain. \u201cYou look so ugly when you cry.\u201d\n This was the first time Yan Jiang heard Song Fei\u2019s voice since she was an adult. It was as cold and piercing as snow.\n I love it!\n Yan Jiang suddenly pulled Song Fei into his arms and pressed her against his chest. He choked and said, \u201cYou are really awake. It\u2019s not an illusion. You are really awake!\u201d Only the real Song Fei would have such an arrogant and disdainful expression. She would always look at him with exasperation.\n Song Fei felt slightly displeased to suddenly be hugged by an adult man. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d Song Fei was not used to being close to others.\n Realizing what he had just done, Yan Jiang felt awkward and guilty. He let go of Song Fei and took a step back. His eyes kept flickering and he didn\u2019t dare to meet Song Fei\u2019s eyes.\n Song Fei stared at his handsome face and asked in confusion, \u201cDid you have plastic surgery?\u201d\n Yan Jiang hurriedly shook his head, his face flushed red. He quickly explained. \u201cNo plastic surgery, but I did my teeth.\u201d In the past, Yan Jiang\u2019s teeth looked a little messy, but after some adjustments, the shape of his mouth changed slightly and he looked more exquisite.\n Afraid that Song Fei wouldn\u2019t believe him, Yan Jiang took the initiative to grin, revealing a mouthful of neat, white teeth. \u201cLook, aren\u2019t my teeth a lot tidier now?\u201d\n Song Fei waved her hand in disdain. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d He\u2019s too dumb, I can\u2019t look at him straight in the eye.\n Yan Jiang sat quietly by the side, not daring to make a fuss.\n Song Fei leaned against the head of the bed and felt uncomfortable. She picked up the pillow and placed it behind her waist. Yan Jiang saw her frown and said considerately, \u201cIs it uncomfortable to lean against the bed? I will get someone to send over a leather bed tomorrow. The kind that you can adjust the back of the bed.\u201d\n Song Fei didn\u2019t speak, but just stared at him coldly. Yan Jiang felt very uneasy and didn\u2019t dare to speak anymore. In front of Song Fei, Yan Jiang would forever be that little coward who didn\u2019t even have the courage to fight back when bullied.\n Song Fei suddenly smiled and asked in a dangerous tone, \u201cWifey?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was slightly embarrassed. He corrected Song Fei sheepishly. \u201cI am a man. I should be H-hu... \u201d Yan Jiang didn\u2019t have the guts to say the word \u2018hubby\u2019 out loud as he was afraid of getting hammered.\n Song Fei was amused by Yan Jiang\u2019s innocent and adorable manner. \u201cAre you dreaming?\u201d\n Recalling how Yan Jiang had been hugging her and calling her his wife non-stop these past few days, Song Fei felt rather conflicted. She didn\u2019t expect this little coward to actually like her to the point of being paranoid and sick.\n Song Fei questioned Yan Jiang, \u201cWho gave you the courage to call me your wife?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s head exploded! He looked up in shock and stared at Song Fei in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019ve been pretending all along? When did you wake up?\u201d\n \u201cTwo mornings ago.\u201d Song Fei thought of something and glanced at Yan Jiang\u2019s well-dressed figure. She praised him. \u201cYou have a good figure, but it\u2019s not a good habit to not wear clothes.\u201d\n Not wear clothes?\n After thinking about it, Yan Jiang finally understood. He had indeed come out naked after taking a shower last night.\n \u201cYou peeked at me!\u201d But that was last night... Yan Jiang thought of something and looked at Song Fei with hurt eyes. \u201cYou woke up yesterday? Why didn\u2019t you tell me you woke up? Is it fun to play with me like this?\u201d\n Song Fei sneered. \u201cWhat about you sneaking a kiss on me?\u201d\n Yan Jiang covered his mouth.\n Song Fei said, \u201cI wonder if you did anything disrespectful to me when I was unconscious. I couldn\u2019t tell that not only are you a coward, you\u2019re also a pervert.\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s disdainful and displeased gaze agitated Yan Jiang. He lowered his head deeply, and a few strands of hair on his blue fur quivered. He looked rather adorable. Song Fei stared at those strands of hair and suppressed her urge to pinch them.\n However, Yan Jiang heaved a sigh of relief when Song Fei exposed his past despicable actions. He suddenly looked up and boldly stared straight at Song Fei. His eyes were as dark as ever.\n Song Fei was slightly surprised when she met Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes.\n Yan Jiang suddenly grabbed her hand.\n Song Fei looked at Yan Jiang in silence. She didn\u2019t say a word but didn\u2019t remove her hand either.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s handsome face was slightly red, but he looked very serious. He looked slightly reserved and uneasy. This kind of Yan Jiang exuded an addictive charm that made one want to treat him better.\n Song Fei actually felt slightly uneasy. She wanted to draw her hand away, but Yan Jiang sensed her intentions and tightened his grip.\n Song Fei stopped moving.\n Gazing into Song Fei\u2019s icy eyes, Yan Jiang said sincerely, \u201cIt has been eight years since we last met. Song Fei, I am Yan Jiang.\u201d\n Song Fei pouted. \u201cI can recognize you because you didn\u2019t undergo plastic surgery.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s bellyful of heartfelt words nearly bailed on him. He calmed down and composed himself before saying to Song Fei, \u201cThere\u2019s something I haven\u2019t told you.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cTell me then.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cDon\u2019t rush me.\u201d\n Song Fei replied, \u201cOk.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n He suddenly didn\u2019t know where to start.\n The ambiguous atmosphere that he had tried so hard to create was completely destroyed by Song Fei. Yan Jiang gave up on being romantic and said straightforwardly, \u201cEight years ago, on your 14th birthday, I was the one who sneaked a love letter into your bag.\u201d\n Song Fei thought for a moment before remembering something. She said mildly, \u201cThere were too many love letters. Which one is yours?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n He gritted his teeth and asked expressionlessly, \u201cToo many love letters?\u201d\n Song Fei nodded and put on the confident manner of an elder sister who had no shortage of admirers. \u201cMmm, you also know that I am smart, pretty and have many fans. Isn\u2019t it very normal for me to have many love letters?\u201d\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t believe her. He said, \u201cSong Ci said that you\u2019ve only received a love letter on that birthday.\u201d\n Song Fei couldn\u2019t quite control her expression. She sneered. \u201cWhat does that little fool know?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was starting to get suspicious. He said unhappily, \u201cThe very long two-page love letter, without a signature is mine.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "133": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-134\n\n Chapter 133: It\u2019s Brotherly Love  Song Fei\u2019s eyes darted around as she racked her brains for that distant and blurred memory. After a moment, she said, \u201cWas it that love letter that was as formal as an essay and used many ridiculous similes?\u201d\n Yan Jiang shot her a resentful look and softly asked, \u201cIs it very ridiculous?\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s expression was indecipherable. She started reciting. \u201cAh! Song Fei, you are like a lofty flower that can only be seen from afar but not touched! Ah, Song Fei, you are like the stars in the sky, lighting up the darkness in me! Ah! Song Fei...\u201d\n Song Fei vividly portrayed the scene in that love letter. Yan Jiang also felt very ashamed as he listened to her. His face was so red that it looked like blood would drip from it.\n He had just turned 18 when he wrote that love letter. As a science student, he was not good at writing essays. He had spent two days thinking before writing that love letter. He thought it was very moving, but Song Fei said it was ridiculous!\n Yan Jiang\u2019s heart shattered.\n \u201cSo you like me.\u201d Song Fei came to this conclusion.\n Yan Jiang nodded. \u201cYes, I like you.\u201d\n Song Fei gave him a teasing look. She suddenly leaned toward Yan Jiang, her nose almost touching his. Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dare to move. He saw Song Fei\u2019s long lashes quiver and his heart trembled.\n Song Fei looked at Yan Jiang with a mischievous smile and asked, \u201cI was only 14 years old then and still underage. Yan Jiang, are you a pervert?\u201d\n Yan Jiang felt even more uneasy now that he was being accused of being a pervert. Song Fei suddenly leaned back and said, \u201cAlright, I know you like me. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m going to bed now.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was very indignant, after he waited so long for this sentence.. \u201cWhat about you? How do you feel about me?\u201d Yan Jiang stubbornly waited for an answer.\n He heard Song Fei say, \u201cIt\u2019s brotherly love.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was thunderstruck!\n He had never expected her to treat him like a brother, when all he wanted was to be with her. He felt very despondent and defeated, as his heart ached terribly but he didn\u2019t know who to tell.\n Even if Song Fei only treated him as a brother, Yan Jiang still wanted to be together with her. He was like a rascal, sitting by the bed and refusing to leave. Song Fei didn\u2019t chase him away either. She just closed her eyes and looked like she was about to fall asleep.\n \u201cDoes Song Song know you are awake?\u201d Since there was no room for romance between the two of them, they could only talk about Song Ci.\n Song Fei replied lazily, \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll tell her now.\u201d\n Song Fei added. \u201cNo hurry. I will tell her when she comes back.\u201d\n Puzzled, Yan Jiang asked Song Fei, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell her now? You have no idea how much she wanted you to wake up. Song Song will definitely be very happy if she knows you\u2019re awake.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cI want to give her a surprise. A surprise, do you understand?\u201d\n Only then did Yan Jiang shut up.\n He found a blanket and laid it on the wooden floor beside the window. The weather was slightly chilly and there was no need to turn on the air conditioning at night, but he still had to cover himself with a thin blanket. Yan Jiang turned off the lights in the room and laid down without a word. He finally relaxed when Song Fei had not chased him away.\n Yan Jiang stared at the ceiling with his eyes wide open. He had never felt so relaxed before.\n Song Fei woke up.\n My Song Fei has woken up.\n How wonderful.\n Suddenly, Song Fei\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cAre you still afraid of the dark?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n Song Fei suddenly turned on one of the wall lights. \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid of the dark, just turn on the light. No one will laugh at you.\u201d Song Fei turned over and laid sideways. She faced Yan Jiang\u2019s room and closed her eyes.\n With the dim light of the wall lamp, Yan Jiang could see Song Fei\u2019s face. Her palm-sized cheeks were no longer unruly after she closed her eyes. Instead, she looked petite and adorable.\n Yan Jiang felt assured as he looked at Song Fei.\n He couldn\u2019t help but think of him when he was young and his grandmother had just passed away. Every evening when the sun set, he would feel anxious and flustered. To Yan Jiang, the dark night was like a monster with countless claws and teeth. As long as he closed his eyes, those monsters would trap him.\n His room was only a wall away from Song Fei\u2019s. At that time, the soundproofing system in the old district wasn\u2019t good. Knowing that he was afraid of the dark night, Song Fei would always make some noise next door. During the long night, sounds from Song Fei\u2019s room would always give Yan Jiang courage.\n Just brothers?\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t believe it. There was no such considerate brother. If there was, they would be gay.\n ...\n The trending topics related to Yan Jiang and Song Fei were quickly suppressed. By the time Song Ci woke up, the trending topics was already gone. As a result, Song Ci also missed the first opportunity to know that Song Fei was awake.\n Han Zhan stayed in Shenyang for three days. On the fourth day, he woke Song Ci up early in the morning. \u201cGet up. I don\u2019t have work today, so I\u2019ll bring you out to play.\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly sat up, took off her pyjamas, and changed into the clothes Han Zhan tossed to her. She noticed that Han Zhan had stuffed a thin sweater into his backpack. Song Ci felt strange and asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n \u201cChangbai Mountain.\u201d\n \u201cOh, a trip!\u201d Song Ci hurriedly put on her clothes, grabbed her bag, and went on a trip with Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan was already well-prepared and had already applied for flight approval. They boarded a private jet and arrived at the Changbai Mountain Airport. Thereafter, they booked a car and headed to Songjiang River Town. Apart from Song Ci and Han Zhan, there were also Song Shiqing, Xiong Jian, and one of Bei Zhan\u2019s capable subordinates on this trip. There were a total of five people.\n It was no longer suitable for hiking that day. They stayed at a local hot spring resort hotel. After dinner, Han Zhan and Song Ci took a walk for a while, before going to the outdoor swimming pool to swim.\n Song Ci touched the water. It was slightly cold and the temperature at the foot of the mountain was only 6-7 degrees at night in late September. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s quite cold. Are you sure you want to swim?\u201d Staring at Han Zhan\u2019s strong and healthy body, Song Ci wanted to urge him not to torture himself like this. An old man like him couldn\u2019t withstand such torture.\n Han Zhan was rather full tonight and was afraid of gaining weight, so he had to swim a few laps before he could feel at ease.\n Taking Song Ci\u2019s hesitant expression as concern, Han Zhan told her, \u201cI will also swim in cold water during winter. My grandfather will swim three times a week, no matter rain or shine.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s admiration for his grandfather deepened. \u201cGrandpa is an awesome person.\u201d She took her hand out of the water and stood by the shore to adjust her shawl. \u201cYou swim. I\u2019ll go to the hot springs.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan was slightly moved. He really wanted to go to the hot springs with Song Ci, but...\n No one could stop him from exercising and maintaining his figure, not even Song Ci! \u201cCan you wait for me for half an hour? After I finish swimming, I will accompany you to the hot springs.\u201d\n Since Han Zhan was already using a negotiating tone, how could Song Ci not listen?\n Song Ci agreed.\n As a result, Han Zhan was swimming in the pool while Song Ci was reading a book recommended by Han Zhan\u2014The Ordinary World. Coincidentally, this hotel had this book. After Han Zhan finished swimming, the two of them went to the hot springs together.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "134": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-135\n\n Chapter 134: Brother Han is Bad and Scheming  Han Zhan and Song Ci chose an individual hot spring pool. Song Ci wrapped herself in a towel and walked barefoot into the hot spring. The cold wind outside just now made it very comfortable to enter the warm spring. She couldn\u2019t help sighing in enjoyment.\n Han Zhan had just finished swimming in the cold water and couldn\u2019t immediately go to the hot spring, so he stood by the side of the spring and looked at Song Ci. Hearing her sigh, Han Zhan\u2019s face was expressionless, but his heart was blooming.\n \u201cDon\u2019t seduce me in public.\u201d Brother Han looked at Song Ci accusingly.\n Song Ci rolled her eyes and scolded him for having so many problems.\n She was completely hidden in the hot spring and the heat surrounded her, only revealing her face and short, wet hair above the water surface. Those lively brown eyes suddenly turned. Song Ci hooked her finger at Han Zhan and said, \u201cBrother Han, guess if I\u2019m wearing any clothes.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n He looked into the water inquisitively, but it was too hot and he couldn\u2019t see clearly. Thinking for a moment, Han Zhan answered with uncertainty, \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m wearing. For those with dirty minds, everything they see is weird. Brother Han is evil and dirty-minded.\u201d Song Ci stood up and her body was wrapped in a white towel.\n Han Zhan felt wronged.\n He also entered the hot spring and was about to approach Song Ci when she suddenly said, \u201cMy period is coming tomorrow.\u201d\n Calculating the time, it was about time for Song Ci\u2019s menstruation period. Upon hearing this, Han Zhan\u2019s reaction was mild. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, let it come. If your stomach hurts, I\u2019ll make brown sugar water for you.\u201d He still walked over to Song Ci\u2019s side and sat beside her.\n Song Ci rubbed her waist. \u201cI can finally be free for a few days.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan felt both smug and guilty. He was pleased that he was still \u2018vigorous despite being old\u2019, but he felt guilty as he did not know how to control himself. After thinking for a moment, Han Zhan said, \u201cIt should get better after some time.\u201d It was their wedding period now and they were in the honeymoon phase. There would be times when they couldn\u2019t control themselves.\n Maybe after a while, after the novelty wore off... maybe?\n Song Ci only hoped that the day would come earlier. Although it felt good to be intimate with Han Zhan, there had to be a limit.\n Han Zhan had something on his mind. He was quieter in the hot spring and rarely spoke. Song Ci swung her legs around in the water. Seeing that Han Zhan remained silent, she hooked her fair feet onto his calves.\n \u201cBrother Han, what are you thinking about?\u201d\n Brother Han grabbed her leg and said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t be so cruel.\u201d Knowing that her menstruation period was approaching, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t bear to bully her no matter what. At this point, Song Ci was slightly cruel and heartless.\n Song Ci knew when to stop. She wanted to draw back her leg, but Han Zhan grabbed her ankle. \u201cYour ankle is quite nice.\u201d He stared at that slender ankle and suddenly said, \u201cIt will look very nice on a red chain.\u201d\n Song Ci was momentarily stunned before asking with a smile, \u201cThen do you want to put your name on the rope?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes lit up. He felt that this was a very good idea.\n Seeing that he was interested, Song Ci hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t, I\u2019m not a dog.\u201d Song Ci was Song Ci. She was Han Zhan\u2019s wife but not his accessory.\n Although Song Ci was smiling, Han Zhan could see the conflict in her eyes.\n Han Zhan smiled gently and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for not thinking things through.\u201d He lifted Song Ci\u2019s ankle with his three missing fingers and splashed water down her calf with his right hand. Han Zhan was very happy to see the water droplets rolling on her fair skin.\n Just when Song Ci was about to fall asleep, she suddenly heard Han Zhan sigh.\n Song Ci opened her beautiful eyes and stared at Han Zhan in confusion.\n Han Zhan looked up and met her eyes. He couldn\u2019t help Song Fei hide the truth from her. Between Sister Fei and his wife, Han Zhan felt that he should be more honest with his wife. After thinking it through, Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cBaby Ci, there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d\n Song Ci could tell that Han Zhan was very serious. She was wide awake and sat up straight. \u201cSay it.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cSong Fei is awake.\u201d\n \u201c...\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s expression froze and her relaxed posture stiffened.\n Han Zhan could understand Song Ci\u2019s reaction now. She probably thought he was fooling her but also hoped that everything was true. Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached slightly for Song Ci. He placed his hand on Song Ci\u2019s shoulder, pinched her stiff muscles, and pulled her soul back.\n Song Ci took a shallow breath and looked down at the steaming water. She asked in a low voice, \u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s true. On the first night I came to Shenyang, your elder sister contacted me.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t speak but her eyes were filled with tears.\n Han Zhan observed Song Ci\u2019s reaction as he said, \u201cSong Fei told me that she was actually conscious all these years while she was in a coma. She actually knew what you told her and what Mu Mian did to her. She just couldn\u2019t wake up.\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei knew about what Mu Mian and his daughter did to you two. She wanted revenge and came up with a risky plan. She wanted to protect you and didn\u2019t want to implicate you. She didn\u2019t want me to tell you about this, but after thinking about it for a long time, I still feel that you should know. You two are sisters. I think it will be very difficult for you to let Song Fei take the risk alone.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled coldly and said rather sadly, \u201cEven you understand but she doesn\u2019t.\u201d Tears streamed down her face as she laughed. \u201cThat girl is just so annoying. Arrogant, rude, and nonchalant, thinking that everyone in the world is an idiot but she\u2019s so smart!\u201d\n Song Ci wiped her tears and cried. \u201cI will teach her a lesson when we get back!\u201d Song Ci was in no mood to take a bath. She desperately wanted to grow a pair of wings and fly back to Wangdong City.\n Han Zhan watched as Song Ci returned to her room. He picked up the cell phone on the tray and apologized to the \u201cSister Fei\u201d on WeChat.\n The next morning, when the sun rose, Han Zhan and the rest had already arrived at the foot of the West Slope Mountain and were preparing to climb up the hill. Song Ci was concerned about Song Fei and didn\u2019t have the mood to admire the scenery along the way. Instead, Han Zhan took a few photos for her.\n Han Zhan\u2019s photo-taking skills were barely passable. He didn\u2019t take a photo of Song Ci\u2019s 1.8m long legs, but he didn\u2019t make her look like a 1.3m tall dwarf either. His scenery photo-taking skills were very elegant and classy. Standing in the photo, Song Ci looked like a fairy.\n After taking a look at the photo, Song Ci selectively uploaded a few photos onto Weibo. After that, she saw an old fan commenting. The comments looked rather odd.\n First post: Look, Girly Ci is playing with her husband at the Changbai Mountains. Some blind people should be more careful and stop trying to ruin Girly Ci\u2019s reputation.\n Second post: I am sure that Yan Jiang\u2019s rumored girlfriend is not Song Ci!\n Song Ci was confused.\n She leaned against the railing and curiously went down to search for Yan Jiang on Weibo. Once the name Yan Jiang was mentioned, there were rows of trending search results. Song Ci clicked on the topic of Yan Jiang\u2019s relationship.\n Song Ci stood up straight when she saw that the reporter had secretly taken a photo of Song Fei.\n It\u2019s really Song Fei!\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t lie to me. Song Fei is really awake!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "135": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-136\n\n Chapter 135: Song Ci, Come Over to Sister  Song Ci\u2019s heart finally calmed down when she saw the photos of Song Fei entering and exiting Yan Jiang\u2019s house. Song Ci was indeed angry at Song Fei for keeping the fact that she had already regained consciousness from her. But the fact that Song Fei had already regained consciousness was exciting.\n Han Zhan snatched Song Ci\u2019s cell phone and placed it in his pocket. \u201cStop playing with your cell phone. We\u2019re almost at the top of the hill and will soon see the Heavenly Lake.\u201d\n Song Ci was so emotional that she felt like crying when her many years of anticipation finally came true. Thinking of how her elder sister could have survived in her previous life, but was murdered by that wretched Mu Mian, Song Ci\u2019s heart broke. In this life, Song Fei survived. Song Ci wanted to thank God and Han Zhan.\n Song Ci suddenly hugged Han Zhan and ignored the gazes of the others. She buried her face in Han Zhan\u2019s neck and said to him in a choked voice, \u201cYou are my lucky star, Brother Han!\u201d\n Han Zhan knew why Song Ci was thanking him. He stroked Song Ci\u2019s short hair gently and said, \u201cHave fun today. Go back and have a good chat with Song Fei.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s reach the top first. Since we\u2019re here, we should at least take a look at the Heavenly Lake.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Standing at the peak of the mountain with Han Zhan and the rest, Song Ci gazed at the spectacular lake. She was actually slightly scared and her legs were trembling slightly. She secretly pinched the sleeve of Han Zhan\u2019s jacket and he looked over in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\n Song Ci was especially terrified. As she looked at the landscape in front of her, said softly,\u201d I feel scared. I don\u2019t know when I started to become especially afraid of the deep sea. The Heavenly Lake looks very beautiful, but it makes me feel terrified and my scalp turns numb.\u201d\n Not noticing Han Zhan\u2019s worried expression, Song Ci rubbed the goosebumps on her arms and said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare to imagine how hopeless it would be if someone fell into this lake...\u201d\n As she spoke, Han Zhan suddenly hugged Song Ci.\n Seeing Han Zhan and Song Ci hugging, Song Shiqing and the other two very considerately walked further away so as not to disturb the two of them.\n Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cWere you afraid of the sea in the past?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cI used to board a yacht at sea, so I\u2019m not afraid of it.\u201d She had even dived into the water before.\n Han Zhan noticed that Song Ci\u2019s body was very tense. He patted her arm comfortingly and asked her, \u201cWhen did you start to be afraid of such things?\u201d\n After thinking carefully, Song Ci said, \u201cIn my previous life, when I was about to die, the car that carried me rolled onto the cliff of the Great Dragon River. The cliff was a slope and I was flung out by the car and smashed into a hard rock. My bones were all broken. I was in so much pain that I wanted to call for help but I couldn\u2019t. It was raining that night and the river was surging. One of my legs was in the water and the water kept washing over it. It was a terrible feeling.\u201d\n \u201cFrom then on, I got goosebumps whenever I see photos of the deep pond and the deep sea.\u201d Closing her eyes, Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s wrist tightly and sighed. \u201cI am too useless...\u201d\n Han Zhan rubbed his chin on Song Ci\u2019s head and hugged her even tighter. \u201cNonsense, you\u2019re great. It\u2019s already very amazing that you still have the courage to stand in front of Mu Mian.\u201d\n Due to Song Ci\u2019s phobia of the deep sea, Han Zhan and Song Ci went down the mountain early. That night, they boarded a private plane back to Wangdong City. By the time they arrived at Wangjiang Mountain Airport, it was already dark.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan walked out side by side from the passage. Once she looked up, she saw Song Fei.\n Song Fei was standing by a pillar outside the airport\u2019s main hall. She was wearing a black sports bra with a halter top. Her jade-like fair waist was exposed and she was wearing a loose black hoodie that covered her short hair.\n Song Fei\u2019s long legs were hidden under her army green work pants. She leaned lazily against the pillar, looking slightly listless and arrogant.\n Song Ci suddenly stopped in her tracks when she saw Song Fei.\n She was stunned and didn\u2019t dare to take another step forward.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t even bear to blink as she stared at that dispirited, arrogant, and unapproachable woman. She stared fixedly at Song Fei, afraid that she would disappear like a wisp of smoke in the blink of an eye.\n As if feeling something, Song Fei looked up.\n Song Fei\u2019s pupils quivered slightly when she saw Han Zhan and Song Ci. Song Fei instinctively straightened her body, lifted her hand to remove her hat, and looked at Song Ci with an uneasy expression.\n With her hat off, that gorgeous face hidden under her short hair was revealed. She had the same eyebrows and eyes as Song Ci, but with an air of arrogance and coldness.\n Song Ci stood there stubbornly and silently. She didn\u2019t speak or move forward, but her eyes were filled with tears.\n After several seconds of silence, Song Fei suddenly lifted her slender right arm. With her right palm facing up, she waved at Song Ci with her fingers curled up. Her cold voice sounded from between her slightly red lips. \u201cSong Ci, come over to your elder sister.\u201d\n Hearing Song Fei\u2019s words, Song Ci was like an arrow that missed its target. She ran away from Han Zhan and sprinted towards Song Fei. Song Ci fell onto Song Fei. Song Fei couldn\u2019t bear the impact of this quick little cannonball and her back hit the cylinder pillar.\n Song Fei grunted softly.\n Song Ci was too agitated and didn\u2019t notice her elder sister\u2019s painful grunt. She hugged Song Fei\u2019s neck tightly and bit her shoulder without saying a word.\n Song Fei sighed but didn\u2019t push Song Ci away.\n Song Ci\u2019s bite on Song Fei\u2019s shoulder was very forceful at first, making Song Fei feel as if her flesh and blood were about to be torn off. But very quickly, the force gradually weakened and some warm tears landed on Song Fei\u2019s shoulder.\n Realizing that it was Song Ci crying, the cold arrogance on Song Fei\u2019s face gradually faded.\n The coldness in her eyes melted and was replaced by a look of pity. \u201cLittle fool, why are you crying?\u201d Song Fei wanted to stroke Song Ci\u2019s head but realized that she was taller than her.\n Song Fei truly felt the passing of these eight years. The little imp who was slightly shorter than her in the past was now taller than her.\n Song Fei was very unhappy.\n \u201cElder sister...\u201d Song Ci hit Song Fei\u2019s fragile back and choked out her words.\u201d I thought you really didn\u2019t want me anymore...\u201d Song Ci\u2019s broken voice made Song Fei pity her even more.\n \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d Song Fei\u2019s comforting words were dry.\n Song Ci rubbed her head against Song Fei\u2019s neck, wiping her tears and snot all over her body.\n Song Fei felt slightly disgusted but didn\u2019t push Song Ci away. Song Fei heard Song Ci\u2019s sobs. \u201cSong Fei, Father and Mother have both left. Their bodies were collected together with the other victims. I only managed to obtain two urns of ashes. I buried them on the hill behind the Cai Family Village. The two of them were buried together.\u201d\n Song Ci told Song Fei about her parents\u2019 funeral in a casual manner, but didn\u2019t tell her how devastated she was when she personally buried her parents.\n Song Fei felt like a fishbone was stuck in her throat. She hugged her only sister as her eyes reddened. \u201cWell done, Song Ci. Father and Mother will be very happy to be buried together after death.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "136": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-137\n\n Chapter 136: Start from Looks, Loyal to Souls  Song Fei didn\u2019t dare to imagine how strong Song Ci must have been in order to deal with all these, after losing her parents and her only elder sister being in a coma.\n The little girl who had been pampered all her life had already grown up in a place where Song Fei couldn\u2019t see.\n But such a transformation was too cruel.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear to let go of Song Fei. She cried as she said, \u201cSong Fei, if you don\u2019t want me anymore, I will really be an orphan. Song Fei, don\u2019t ever leave me again. Never again!\u201d\n Song Fei finally placed her hand on the back of Song Ci\u2019s head and hugged her tightly. Song Fei said with determination, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The heart-wrenching scene of their reunion was broken by a male voice. \u201cSister Fei, Baby Ci, let\u2019s get into the car first.\u201d Han Zhan had already walked up to the sisters.\n Song Fei glanced at Han Zhan.\n The first time Song Fei saw her brother-in-law, she looked at him inquisitively. Han Zhan had seen all sorts of storms. No matter how arrogant and cold Song Fei was, Han Zhan was not afraid.\n Nodding calmly at Song Fei, Han Zhan said, \u201cWe\u2019ve already attracted the attention of others. Let\u2019s talk at home.\u201d\n Song Fei glanced around and saw that all the passengers were looking at them strangely. She released Song Ci. \u201cLet\u2019s go back and talk.\u201d With that, Song Fei turned and walked towards the car. Her movements were quick and smooth, without the slightest hesitation.\n Song Ci hurried after her like a little puppy.\n Han Zhan raised his brows at this scene. Is my wife being too obedient to her elder sister?\n It looks like I have to treat Song Fei better in the future.\n On the way home, Han Zhan sat in the passenger\u2019s seat beside the driver, while Song Ci and Song Fei sat in the backseat. This was the first time Han Zhan shared a car with Song Ci, but they sat separately in two rows. Observing Song Ci in the backseat from the front was rather unique.\n Inside the car, Song Ci\u2019s lips were like a tap that had been turned on, chattering non-stop. Song Fei spent most of the time listening and would only say something occasionally.\n Han Zhan sent Li Li a message to inform him that he wouldn\u2019t be going to the office today. Putting away his cell phone, Han Zhan looked up and saw Song Fei sizing him up in the rearview mirror. Han Zhan didn\u2019t turn back but nodded at the rearview mirror.\n Song Fei narrowed her eyes upon seeing that.\n At the side, Song Ci was talking about the demolition of the old house in the city area. \u201cThe area where we stayed has been demolished and a commercial square has been built. The compensation for the demolition of the house is more than 6 million yuan, as well as 500,000 yuan for every person. We were also compensated a house. I have saved all this money.\u201d\n Song Ci had never touched that money.\n Song Fei acknowledged. Recalling Song Ci\u2019s grumbling when she was unconscious, Song Fei suddenly said, \u201cSell the house for cash and return the compensation to Mu Mian.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned. \u201cBig sister, you already know?\u201d\n Song Fei nodded. \u201cI know everything that has happened to you all these years.\u201d Turning to look at Song Ci, Song Fei said, \u201cI agree with your way of doing things. The Mu Family has contributed a lot to us all these years. We must repay what we owe.\u201d After repaying their kindness, it was time to settle the scores.\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cThen the money is enough. I will make an appointment with the bank tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci was about to say something when Song Fei suddenly said, \u201cI am a little tired. Send me back to Little Coward... Yan Jiang\u2019s place.\u201d\n Little coward?\n Song Ci was slightly hesitant. She asked Song Fei, \u201cAre you planning to stay with Ah Jiang?\u201d\n Song Fei suddenly frowned and corrected Song Ci. \u201cHe is older than you. How can you call him Ah Jiang? Call him Brother Jiang.\u201d\n Song Ci seemed to have heard a joke. She rolled her eyes and rebuked Song Fei. \u201cForget it. You already called him a little coward. Why should I call him Brother Jiang? We are the same age.\u201d\n Song Fei sneered. \u201cHe is the man I will protect for my entire life. How dare you call him Ah Jiang?\u201d\n \u201cHow outrageous...\u201d Song Ci suddenly realized something and her eyes widened. She asked Song Fei in a stunned tone,\u201d What do you mean you want to protect him forever? \u201d\n Song Fei remained silent.\n Song Ci thought of something and was utterly shocked. \u201cSong Fei, you accepted him?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cNoisy.\u201d\n Song Ci shut her mouth, her expression blank.\n Han Zhan turned and glanced at the Song sisters. He took in his wife\u2019s adorable expression and Sister Fei\u2019s arrogant disdain. He pitied Yan Jiang slightly. Girls were more adorable and interesting like Baby Ci, and ordinary people couldn\u2019t appreciate someone like Song Fei.\n Yan Jiang was no ordinary person.\n The driver dropped Han Zhan and the rest off at Yan Jiang\u2019s villa. At Han Zhan\u2019s behest, he left the car alone.\n Standing by the roadside, Song Fei looked up and saw that the villa was brightly lit. The owner was obviously at home and not sleeping. Is he waiting for me?\n Song Fei\u2019s eyes flickered. Is he so sure that I would return?\n After pondering for a moment, Song Fei led Song Ci and her husband into Yan Jiang\u2019s house.\n After entering the house, Song Fei took off her black and white shoes and put on the bunny slippers that Yan Jiang had prepared for her. As Song Ci frequently came to Yan Jiang\u2019s house to play, Yan Jiang had already prepared a pair of slippers for her.\n After Song Ci changed into her own shoes, she found slippers for Han Zhan in the shoe rack. Yan Jiang\u2019s feet were 44-yard, and the biggest slippers were also 44-yard. Song Ci found a brand new pair of black slippers and handed them to Han Zhan. \u201cAh Jiang\u2019s feet are only 44-yard. You have to suffer a little, Brother Han.\u201d\n As soon as Song Ci said this, Song Fei, who was standing in front, suddenly turned and shot Song Ci a warning look. Song Ci caught Song Fei\u2019s gaze and blinked. She immediately changed her words. \u201cBrother Jiang\u2019s feet are small. Brother Han, you need to compromise.\u201d\n Only then did Song Fei look away.\n Han Zhan patted Song Ci\u2019s head sympathetically. He stuffed his big feet into the new slippers, exposing his heels completely.\n Song Ci stared at his heels and felt slightly embarrassed. Han Zhan smiled lovingly at her and comforted her instead. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not cold anyway.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist reaching out to hook Han Zhan\u2019s finger. Han Zhan hooked her little finger back and the two of them started flirting at the door.\n Song Fei turned and saw the couple\u2019s small action. She narrowed her long, narrow eyes. She leaned against the wall and asked Han Zhan, \u201cHow did the two of you get together?\u201d\n Song Ci and Han Zhan exchanged glances. Song Ci was about to tell Song Fei the truth when Han Zhan tugged at her hand, hinting at her not to speak.\n Han Zhan looked at Song Fei and answered, \u201cSong Ci is a pilot and my company is hiring pilots. She happened to be there for an interview. The first time I met her, I was mesmerized by her humorous side.\u201d\n \u201cAfter that, we got to know each other a lot at work and gradually developed a good impression of each other.\u201d Han Zhan thought for a moment and concluded with one sentence. \u201cMy feelings for Song Ci started from her looks, I was impressed by her talent, pleased by her character, and I\u2019m loyal to her soul.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "137": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-138\n\n Chapter 137: What Kind of Man If You just Say and Do Nothing?  It was true that Song Ci had ulterior motives for getting close to Han Zhan, but it was enough that Han Zhan knew this in his heart. There was no need to publicize it to a third party. In front of anyone, he had to give his Mrs. Han 100% respect.\n Han Zhan\u2019s brilliant words struck Song Ci\u2019s heart.\n Song Ci\u2019s face was red. She was in such a good mood that she felt like she was going to soar to the heavens!\n During the period when Song Fei was in a coma, she had already heard Song Ci tell her the real reason behind her marriage with Han Zhan. Under the premise that she knew the truth behind their marriage, she could still hear Han Zhan speaking up for Song Ci. Song Fei\u2019s attitude towards Han Zhan improved slightly, and the coldness in her eyes dimmed slightly.\n A man who would give face to his wife should have a good character.\n Song Fei glanced at the lovestruck Song Ci and said in an odd tone, \u201cFrom the looks, talent, character, and soul...\u201d Hearing her elder sister\u2019s teasing, Song Ci felt slightly embarrassed.\n Song Ci was about to say something humble when Song Fei suddenly sneered. She said mockingly, \u201cShe has those things?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s smile froze. She gritted her teeth and threatened Song Fei. \u201cSong Fei, do you want to fight again?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cYou can\u2019t win me.\u201d\n \u201cThat was in the past, but not now!\u201d Song Fei looked frail and weak, but one look at Song Ci and one could tell she was someone who could carry 50 catties of rice on her shoulders.\n If they really fought, the Song Fei now would never be able to win against Song Ci.\n Seeing that the sisters were about to start fighting, Han Zhan pulled Song Ci, whose eyes were ablaze, in time and reminded her in a low voice, \u201cSister Fei just woke up and is weak. Baby Ci, don\u2019t be angry.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s anger immediately subsided. She looked at Song Fei as if she was a newborn kitten, afraid of hurting her at all.\n Song Fei felt Song Ci\u2019s gaze was strangely mushy. She scolded. \u201cCoward!\u201d She turned and left after scolding her.\n Song Ci felt slightly aggrieved. She complained to Han Zhan. \u201cShe still dares to not admit that she had received a benefit from me!\u201d\n Han Zhan thought it was funny but didn\u2019t dare to laugh out loud for fear of hurting Song Ci\u2019s heart.\n Yan Jiang had been working out in the gym the entire time. Hearing the sisters bickering, he finally walked out of the gym. \u201cSong Fei, you are back.\u201d After greeting Song Fei, Yan Jiang nodded at Han Zhan. \u201cWelcome, Mr. Han.\u201d\n In the end, Yan Jiang\u2019s gaze landed on Song Ci. Not only did he ignore Song Ci\u2019s grievances, he even said, \u201cSong Song, don\u2019t bully your elder sister. She has just regained consciousness and is weak. You must dote on her.\u201d\n Before Song Ci could retort, Song Fei spoke up first. \u201cI am weak and in pain?\u201d Her tone was rather threatening.\n Yan Jiang risked his life to explain. \u201cYou just woke up and haven\u2019t recovered fully. I am just worried that you will suffer if you fight with Song Ci. If you really want to fight, why don\u2019t you wait until you recover before fighting?\u201d\n \u201cHmph.\u201d Song Fei couldn\u2019t be bothered with them and went to sit down on the sofa first.\n After Song Fei left, Song Ci walked up to Yan Jiang and mocked him in a low voice. \u201cLook at that disgusting face of yours. Didn\u2019t you say we will be good friends forever?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cIn front of love, friendship is nothing.\u201d Just like how cuteness was nothing in front of sex\u2014it was the same principle.\n Song Ci suffered a double blow from her elder sister and her good friend. She could only turn back and burrow into Brother Han\u2019s arms, feeling fortunate that Brother Han still loved her. Brother Han pulled her out of his arms, patted her head, and said mercilessly, \u201cAlright, stop fooling around. I know your mentality isn\u2019t that weak.\u201d\n Song Ci looked at Han Zhan bitterly and couldn\u2019t help complaining. \u201cYou don\u2019t love me anymore too...\u201d The dramatic Song Ci pretended to wipe her non-existent tears, turned around, and ran over to Song Fei.\n Just now, they looked like they were going to fight, but in the next second, they were stuck together. This was probably because they were biological sisters.\n Yan Jiang was in front of the cupboard unwrapping a cup of coffee beans, when Han Zhan walked over. Yan Jiang saw him approaching from the corner of his eye but didn\u2019t look up. He just lowered his head and said, \u201cSong Song said that Mr. Han is well-nourished and doesn\u2019t like to drink coffee and tea. I only have black tea here. Do you mind it?\u201d\n Yan Jiang took out a fresh can of black tea from the cupboard and waved it at Han Zhan. \u201cThis is specially prepared for you. It is finally put to good use today.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s very thoughtful of you. Black tea is not bad either.\u201d Han Zhan helped Yan Jiang open the seal outside the red tea can. He looked down and asked, \u201cMr. Yan, do you have an extra guest room at home?\u201d Song Ci and Song Fei had not gathered together for many years. There must be many things that they wanted to say tonight, so she would most likely stay over at Yan Jiang\u2019s house.\n Before they got married, Han Zhan didn\u2019t think there was a problem with living in a big house alone. But now that they were married, Han Zhan felt lonely at the thought of staying alone at home.\n Since Song Ci was staying over tonight, Han Zhan naturally had to stay over too.\n Yan Jiang understood what Han Zhan meant. He turned to look at the sisters chatting in the living room and smiled. \u201cActually, they have a pretty good relationship.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n It was one thing to beat someone up and another to scold them, but their relationship was very strong.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a guest room upstairs. Song Song will occasionally come over to stay the night. Mr. Han, you can stay here tonight. I\u2019ll go make the bedsheets.\u201d\n \u201cSorry for the trouble.\u201d\n Yan Jiang put down the coffee beans and walked out of the kitchen with Han Zhan. He said to Song Ci, \u201cSong Song, the newly bought coffee beans are here. If you want to drink coffee, brew it yourself. Oh yes, there\u2019s passionfruit in the fridge. Make it yourself if you want to drink it. Help me entertain Mr. Han. I will go upstairs to lay out the bedsheets.\u201d\n After Yan Jiang went upstairs, Song Ci poked Song Fei\u2019s slender waist and asked, \u201cShall I go get some water then?\u201d This was Song Fei\u2019s man\u2019s house. As a guest, how could Song Ci skip Song Fei, the future mistress, to receive a guest?\n Song Fei nodded and said to Song Ci, \u201cGive me a glass of water.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci went to the kitchen to boil water. Han Zhan sat down on the sofa. As his legs were too long and the coffee table was in the way, he could only cross his long legs.\n Song Fei had taken off her shoes and was sitting cross-legged on the sofa with a pillow in her arms. She leaned against the sofa and gazed lazily into the kitchen.\n Looking at Song Ci\u2019s busy figure, Song Fei thought of her deceased mother and felt somewhat despondent. Eight years had passed and the little fool had really grown up. She had long legs, a slender waist, and a big chest. She looked more and more like their mother.\n Suddenly, Song Fei heard Han Zhan say in a low voice, \u201cSister Fei, Song Ci is no longer a child. It\u2019s necessary to give her some respect and affirmation.\u201d\n Song Fei glanced sideways at Han Zhan and gave an ambiguous smile. \u201cYou do feel sorry for her.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s protective stance toward Song Ci actually made Song Fei feel better. \u201cIf you really feel sorry for her, why don\u2019t you go and boil some water for her? What kind of man are you if you just say without doing anything?\u201d\n Han Zhan became obedient due to Song Fei\u2019s words.\n After Song Ci boiled water, she poured a cup for Song Fei and brewed black tea for Han Zhan. Han Zhan came over just as she brewed the tea.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "138": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-139\n\n Chapter 138: Taking Brother-In-Law Down a Notch  Song Ci saw that he looked like he had been rejected by Song Fei and asked Han Zhan, \u201cIt\u2019s very boring to be alone with Song Fei, right?\u201d\n Han Zhan curved his lips and lied against his will. \u201cSister Fei is a pretty easygoing person. I just want to be with you.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. Do you think I don\u2019t know what kind of person she is?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t continue this topic and asked Song Ci, \u201cDoes your stomach hurt?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s menstrual cycle had come. Her abdomen felt slightly uncomfortable but not painful. She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good. Let me bring the tea over.\u201d Han Zhan handed Song Fei a cup of tea in the living room with a respectful attitude.\n Song Fei had no intention of reaching out for the tea. Her cold eyes stared straight into Han Zhan\u2019s. She suddenly asked, \u201cWhen Song Ci was 8 years old, she was bullied by a male classmate for the first time. How did I avenge her?\u201d\n Han Zhan quietly stared at Song Fei. He knew that Song Fei was trying to intimidate him\u2014this was also within Han Zhan\u2019s expectations. As if his curiosity was piqued by her words, Han Zhan lowered his head and asked, \u201cHow did you get back at him for Song Ci?\u201d\n Song Fei was expressionless but her words were rather frightening. \u201cI hid a snake in his bag. He was bitten and nearly amputated...\u201d\n Under Song Fei\u2019s cold gaze, Han Zhan praised her without a change in expression. \u201cSister Fei did a great job. Anyone who bullies Song Ci deserves retribution.\u201d Han Zhan felt that this was not enough and added. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t even be an exaggeration to say that they should be struck by lightning.\u201d\n Song Fei snorted. \u201cHan Zhan, I don\u2019t care who you are or what position you have. Since you married Song Ci, you must treat her with respect and love forever. If you dare to bully her...\u201d Song Fei accepted the tea but didn\u2019t drink it. Instead, she poured the tea into a potted plant on the table.\n She put down her teacup heavily and said, \u201cI won\u2019t splash you with water, I\u2019ll splash acid instead.\u201d\n Despite being intimidated by Song Fei\u2019s actions, Han Zhan\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He smiled slightly and turned to look at Song Ci behind him. Han Zhan even said with a gratified expression, \u201cOur Song Ci is fortunate to have such a loving elder sister.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Fei couldn\u2019t help but look up to Han Zhan.\n He\u2019s pretty capable.\n Song Ci, who had been quietly standing behind Han Zhan and listening to their conversation, secretly glanced up at Han Zhan, then looked at Song Fei who was leaning against the sofa like she had no bones. She suddenly turned and ran into the washroom.\n Hearing the sound of movement, Han Zhan turned to look. Seeing that the door to the washroom was closed, Han Zhan\u2019s eyes showed some helplessness.\n Song Fei pursed her lips and said insincerely, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up!\u201d\n Song Ci entered the washroom, turned on the tap, and burst into tears.\n This feeling of having a family to back me up is just too good.\n Song Ci came out with slightly reddened eyes. But Han Zhan was considerate and didn\u2019t ask her the reason to avoid embarrassing her. He just pushed the cup of passionfruit tea to Song Ci and said, \u201cThe tea is getting cold.\u201d\n Song Ci lowered her head and took a sip of sweet and sour fruit tea.\n At this moment, Yan Jiang came downstairs after laying out the bedsheets. He walked over to Song Fei\u2019s side and sat down. Yan Jiang\u2019s heart ached slightly when he saw the potted plant. It\u2019s my favorite potted plant!\n Song Fei noticed his pained expression and looked down on him. \u201cDoes your heart ache?\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked her, \u201cDid you splash it?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cMy hand was trembling and I was careless.\u201d\n You were shaking in such an accurate manner.\n Song Fei was in low spirits and wanted to rest. She stood up slowly and glanced at Song Ci who was drinking fruit tea beside Han Zhan. Without asking anyone\u2019s opinion, she said resolutely, \u201cSong Ci will sleep with me tonight.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t feel that there was anything wrong with Song Fei\u2019s arrangement. She put down her teacup and quickly stood up. \u201cSong Fei, it\u2019s tiring to go upstairs. Let me help you up.\u201d Song Ci supported Song Fei as the two of them slowly made their way upstairs, leaving Yan Jiang and Han Zhan in the living room looking at each other.\n Yan Jiang glanced at Han Zhan quietly and said, \u201cI only have one guest room at home...\u201d\n One of them was bound to sleep on the floor.\n Han Zhan also had a complicated expression. He looked up and scanned the surroundings of Yan Jiang\u2019s house. He couldn\u2019t resist complaining. \u201cSuch a spacious house with only two rooms. You\u2019re really extravagant.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI never thought that one day in my own home, I would need to fight with an adult male for the guest room.\u201d In other words, Han Zhan was the unexpected guest.\n Han Zhan was no pushover either. \u201cYou are Zeus Airlines\u2019 spokesperson and I\u2019m the boss of Zeus Airlines...\u201d He was hinting at something.\n I am your sugar daddy and the bed belongs to me.\n But Yan Jiang was no saint either. He said, \u201cSong Ci will listen to Song Fei, and Song Fei will be mine sooner or later.\u201d I\u2019m a man who can flirt with Song Fei!\n Han Zhan admitted defeat!\n The two of them refused to sleep on the floor. Yan Jiang and Han Zhan stared at each other. A moment later, Han Zhan relented. He spoke first. \u201cI\u2019m very obedient in bed. I don\u2019t kick people.\u201d\n Yan Jiang added. \u201cI don\u2019t snore either.\u201d\n \u201cAlright!\u201d\n The two of them went upstairs. After washing up briefly, Han Zhan and Yan Jiang slept separately on each side of the 1.8-meter bed.\n The two long-legged men were sleeping on the same bed and it looked rather cramped. Han Zhan shifted his head on the pillow and didn\u2019t hear any sounds from the master bedroom next door. He felt somewhat helpless. \u201cYour house\u2019s soundproofing system is quite good.\u201d I can\u2019t even eavesdrop.\n Yan Jiang wasn\u2019t sleeping either. He was playing with his cell phone. He naturally knew what Han Zhan was referring to. He said, \u201cIt has been many years since the two of them chatted. There will definitely be endless things to talk about tonight.\u201d\n Han Zhan acknowledged, but he wanted to know what they said and if they were talking about him...\n The happiest people on earth were Song Ci and Yan Jiang now that Song Fei was awake. \u201cSong Fei is awake. You have finally gotten what you wanted.\u201d\n Yan Jiang gave a bitter laugh. \u201cNo...\u201d Thinking of how Song Fei rejected him, Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t even bring himself to smile bitterly.\u201d I confessed to her but she rejected me and said that she treats me like a brother... There\u2019s still a long way to go. I have to slowly woo her. \u201d\n Han Zhan pitied Yan Jiang\u2019s plight. \u201cYou still have a long way to go.\u201d\n Yan Jiang wanted to cry.\n It was 10pm and it was time for Han Zhan to sleep. Han Zhan turned his cell phone to silent mode and said, \u201cI am going to bed.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cGood night.\u201d\n Han Zhan switched off the lights.\n The room suddenly turned dark. Yan Jiang\u2019s pupils constricted. He tried to suppress his fear but failed. He called out softly, \u201cMr. Han.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t open his eyes and asked, \u201cHmm?\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked, \u201cCan I turn on the lights?\u201d\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cIt\u2019s not good for the eyes to turn on the light when you sleep.\u201d The big boss of healthcare was very protective of his own health. He definitely couldn\u2019t have such a bad habit of leaving the light on at night.\n Yan Jiang was very embarrassed. \u201cI am afraid of the dark.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Indeed, any pot should be accompanied with its compatible cover. A coward like Yan Jiang had to be dealt with by someone as ruthless as Song Fei.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "139": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-140\n\n Chapter 139: What a Smart Child  Although deep down he despised Yan Jiang\u2019s cowardly actions, Han Zhan still turned on the lights. He turned over and fell asleep very quickly.\n Han Zhan was once in the military and could sleep in any harsh environment, but Yan Jiang was different. Apart from Song Fei, Yan Jiang had never slept with anyone else.\n Yan Jiang felt very uneasy to suddenly be in the same room as an unfamiliar man. He kept playing with his cell phone until his eyes hurt, and his cell phone hit his face several times. He finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and fell asleep.\n ...\n In the other room, Song Fei was whispering to Song Ci.\n Song Ci said to Song Fei, \u201cSong Fei, Ah Jiang...\u201d Realizing that she had addressed Yan Jiang wrongly again, Song Ci hurriedly corrected herself.\u201d Brother Jiang is the guy who wrote you a love letter on your birthday. Did you know that? \u201d\n Song Fei replied, \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci asked her again, \u201cI forgot to ask you. How did you feel when you received a love letter from a guy for the first time?\u201d\n Song Fei couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with Song Ci. She said in disdain, \u201cSleep.\u201d Song Fei turned off the lights.\n Pa!\n Song Ci turned on the lights again. She turned over and laid on her side, staring at Song Fei, who was pretending to be asleep with her eyes closed. She said with a knowing look, \u201cYou are shy.\u201d So Song Fei will also be shy.\n Song Fei remained silent, as if she had really fallen asleep.\n Song Ci reached out and tapped the tip of Song Fei\u2019s nose.\n Song Fei opened her eyes slightly and stared at Song Ci coldly. Song Ci retracted her hands and placed them under her head. She said, \u201cI was really shocked when I knew Brother Jiang liked you. Who would have thought that such a timid person would actually like you?\u201d\n Song Fei didn\u2019t like hearing that. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Am I a female boar or a demon with a green face and sharp fangs?\n Song Ci recalled all the major things that Song Fei had done. \u201cWhen you found out that the pervert in your class called you a monster behind your back, did you lock him up in the men\u2019s room and let him spend the entire night with a black-eyebrowed viper.\u201d\n \u201cAlso, when the hoodlum outside the school rode a motorbike to tail you, did you use a gun to pierce through his wheels and cause him to get into an accident?\u201d\n \u201cOh! Also, there\u2019s a gossipy woman downstairs who scolded our mother. Did you send a screenshot of her committing adultery to the entire neighborhood...\u201d\n Song Fei: \u201cShut up!\u201d\n Song Ci chuckled. \u201cFather and Mother were worried that no one would dare to woo you when you grew up. Who knew Brother Jiang would be so brave?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cDo you want me to tell Han Zhan that you secretly took a photo of a senior in high school when you were 13 years old and even made him a chocolate knitted scarf?\u201d\n \u201c... You\u2019re ruthless.\u201d\n The world suddenly fell silent.\n It had been too many years since they last spoke. No matter how frail Song Fei was, she couldn\u2019t bear to sleep.\n Song Ci was the same.\n Under the blanket, the sisters suddenly held each other\u2019s hands tightly.\n \u201cSong Ci, I am sorry to have troubled you all these years,\u201d Song Fei suddenly said.\n Tears welled up in Song Ci\u2019s eyes and her nose became sour. \u201cI should be the one apologizing, Song Fei. I\u2019m not as smart as you, nor as brave as you. You were the one who should have hidden in the toilet all those years ago.\u201d\n \u201cI was blind to recognize a rascal as my father. In the previous lifetime, your heart was dug out by Mu Mian and I still foolishly listened to him and respected him as someone close to me. Song Fei, I am useless. I didn\u2019t protect you well.\u201d\n Song Fei also felt terrible.\n There was one thing Song Fei didn\u2019t tell anyone. Actually, she also had memories of her previous life. In her previous life, when Mu Mian dug out her heart, she was actually conscious but she couldn\u2019t wake up.\n As she was in a vegetative state, Mu Mian didn\u2019t administer any anesthesia when he took her heart. As a result, Song Fei could feel the pain of having her heart taken away by a knife, but she couldn\u2019t even cry out.\n She couldn\u2019t tell Song Ci about this, as saying it would only deepen the pain in her heart.\n \u201cSong Ci, after all this nonsense is over, let\u2019s go pay our respects to our parents.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n ...\n The next day, Song Ci personally went to the intermediary to sell the house that was compensated by the government during the demolition period. The location of that house was good and it was near the subway station. A very famous foreign private elite school had been built nearby and many people visited the house within a day.\n On the third day, a wealthy family took a fancy to the house. The other party lowered the price again and again and finally negotiated and settled it at 8.3 million yuan. The other party was very straightforward, as they signed the contract within a day and paid Song Ci.\n All these years, Mu Mian had spent a total of 16 million yuan on behalf of Song Ci and her sister. Song Ci had used up her remaining savings, as well as the money from the demolition fees, the housing sales, and the headcount fees from the demolition. As a result, she only had 15 million yuan on hand.\n There were still hundreds of thousands to go.\n After thinking for a moment, Song Ci still borrowed money from Han Zhan.\n After Han Zhan got off work, he heard Song Ci mention that she wanted to borrow money. He was slightly happy but also slightly helpless. \u201cBorrow money? We are husband and wife, must you calculate the money so clearly with me? If you want it, I will give it to you.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYou can do whatever you want with other things, but not this. This is between us sisters and Mu Mian. Take this money as a loan from me. I will return it to you when Liang Bo earns some money.\u201d\n Han Zhan had no choice but to agree. \u201cAlright, but other than this, you can\u2019t be too calculative with me.\u201d Han Zhan stroked Song Ci\u2019s hair and said earnestly, \u201cBaby Ci, I like it when you get entangled with me.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Song Ci rubbed her stomach and asked Han Zhan, \u201cCan I have durian?\u201d\n Han Zhan agreed without hesitation. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci was puzzled. \u201cI thought you don\u2019t like that smell.\u201d\n Han Zhan said mysteriously, \u201cI was already prepared.\u201d Han Zhan walked to the kitchen, took out a gas mask from the cupboard, and put it on, covering his handsome face completely.\n Song Ci was in awe. She couldn\u2019t resist taking a photo of Han Zhan and posting it on Weibo to mock her Brother Han.\n Han Aoyu was a fashionable old man. He was very good at Weibo, WeChat and QQ. Ever since he found out that Song Ci was a major influencer on Weibo, he immediately followed her and even had her follow him back.\n Han Aoyu\u2019s Weibo name was\u2014Grandpa Farmer.\n After Han Aoyu saw Song Ci\u2019s update on Weibo, he couldn\u2019t help but shed bitter tears for his own grandson. He left a comment in Song Ci\u2019s comments: [What a quick-witted child.]\n Zhong Buhui entered the house with a basket. He saw Han Aoyu shaking his head and sighing at a cell phone. He asked Han Aoyu, \u201cOld Master, what are you looking at?\u201d\n Han Aoyu put down his phone and said with a sigh, \u201cZhanzhan is so smart. How did he think of using a gas mask to block the stink of durians?\u201d Han Aoyu patted his own head and was very upset. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that back then?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

In the past, when durians were cheap in the summer, Old Madam Han always stocked up some at home. When Han Aoyu smelled it, he couldn\u2019t even eat his food.\n Zhong Buhui didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cOf course.\u201d He looked at the old Han Aoyu and thought to himself, Old Master must be missing Madam a lot. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t stare at the durians in the fruit section in a daze, every time he went to the supermarket.\n \u201cSpeaking of which, Duanfang\u2019s death anniversary is coming soon. Call Zhanzhan and ask if he will be coming back to visit his grandmother this year.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui replied, \u201cWhen has Zhanzhan not returned?\u201d\n Han Aoyu shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s different this year. There are many things to do after getting married.\u201d\n \u201cLet me ask him then.\u201d\n ]Every year during his grandmother\u2019s death anniversary, Han Zhan would make time to return to Shunchen City. Sometimes, he was afraid that he would be busy with his work, so he would mark this on his calendar in advance. This morning, Han Zhan stared at the date mark on his calendar, deep in thought.\n In the afternoon, he received a call from Zhong Buhui. Over the phone, Uncle Zhong asked if he would be coming home on his grandmother\u2019s death anniversary. Han Zhan told him, \u201cI\u2019ll go back with Song Ci.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui was overjoyed. \u201cThen Old Master will definitely be happy.\u201d\n After hanging up, Han Zhan sent Song Ci a message to tell her that he would be returning to Shunchen City in two days to visit his grandmother. When she received the message, Song Ci and Song Fei were on the way to the Mu Family.\n After reading the message, Song Ci turned off her cell phone and asked Song Fei, \u201cSong Fei, it\u2019s my first time visiting Grandpa at Han Zhan\u2019s hometown. What should I give them?\u201d She couldn\u2019t possibly go empty-handed.\n Song Fei said, \u201cIn order to woo your senior in the past, didn\u2019t you learn how to knit a sweater? Coincidentally, it\u2019s getting cold soon, so you should knit a sweater for your grandfather. It\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d At Han Aoyu\u2019s position, he had seen all sorts of valuable things. Instead of giving those rare things, why not give him something sweet and considerate?\n Hearing that Song Fei was stirring up old scores again, Song Ci couldn\u2019t help warning her. \u201cYou can only tell me these things. When you\u2019re in front of Han Zhan, you\u2019re not allowed to tell him about me wooing my senior in the past. How old were we then?\u201d\n Song Ci had been a pretty puppy from a young age. When she was in junior high school, she had fallen in love with the school beau. In order to woo her senior, Song Ci had made chocolates for him and also knitted scarves. This was a treatment that Han Zhan had never enjoyed before. But at that time, liking someone was all new and innocent\u2014far from love.\n The first time Song Ci truly fell in love with someone was when she was 14 years old. As a vain puppy, she fell in love with a despondent soldier.\n Song Fei closed her eyes lazily and said fiercely, \u201cDon\u2019t provoke me. If you dare to provoke me, I will spill all your dirt to Han Zhan.\u201d This was her biological sister, the kind who would not hesitate to tear her apart.\n Song Ci glared at Song Fei. Before she knew it, the car had arrived in front of the Mu Family residence.\n \u201cMadam, we have arrived.\u201d Long Yu reminded the two sisters in the backseat.\n \u201cBrother Long, go back first and come back in the afternoon to fetch us.\u201d As Song Ci spoke to Long Yu, Song Fei also slowly opened her cold eyes. Her gaze was sharp and cold as she stared at the Mu Family residence and pursed her lips.\n \u201cSong Fei, get down.\u201d\n The two sisters alighted from the car. Long Yu was slightly worried. If Mr. Han asked about today\u2019s work situation, should I tell him that his wife had once wooed a senior high school senior, made chocolates for him, and knitted scarves for him?\n \u2013\n Before coming, Song Ci had already called Du Tingting and expressed her wish to meet Mu Mian personally to thank him for taking care of the two of them all these years.\n As a result, Mu Mian specially took leave to wait at home.\n Knowing that Song Fei had finally been found and that Song Ci would be bringing Song Fei home as a guest today, Mu Qiu also woke up early this day. She had dressed up and was waiting at home. Hearing the sound of a car, the family of three walked out of the house and saw Auntie Zhang leading the Song sisters in.\n Although they were twins, Song Ci and Song Fei were two beauties with completely different styles. Dressed in a British-style grey checkered suit paired with a V-neck knitted short-sleeved shirt, Song Ci looked dashing and cool in it.\n Meanwhile, Song Fei was wearing a loose black and white sweater. Her long, straight legs were bound under a pair of black pencil pants. She exuded a ruthless aura that said, I am very cool, don\u2019t be affected by me.\u2019\n The sleeping Song Fei looked harmless, but the awakened Song Fei was a leopard. She looked thin and frail, but whenever she moved, she would attack and cause the person to bleed profusely.\n Mu Qiu only dared to look at Song Fei from afar, without glancing at her for too long.\n \u201cMother, Father, Qiu-er.\u201d Song Ci pointed at Song Fei beside her and introduced the three of them. \u201cThis is Song Fei. I found her.\u201d\n Only then did Song Fei take off her sweater and white hat, revealing a head of short hair that reached her ears. She had the exact same face as Song Ci. The difference was that Song Ci\u2019s eyes were as bright as the stars, dazzling and alluring. But Song Fei\u2019s eyes were like snow on a high mountain, making one shiver just by looking at them.\n \u201cHello, I am Song Fei.\u201d Song Fei took a step back and bowed deeply to Mu Mian under everyone\u2019s stunned gazes.\n \u201cSong Fei, what are you doing...\u201d Du Tingting was shocked.\n Song Fei lowered her head, keeping her upper body above the ground at a perfect angle.\n Song Ci thanked Mu Mian sincerely. \u201cMr. Mu, I know very well what you have done for us all these years. I want to thank you for everything you have done for us. We will definitely repay your kindness!\u201d\n Mu Mian looked at the thin but unruly girl and actually forgot to reply. They were clearly words of gratitude, but hearing it made Mu Mian\u2019s heart race.\n Du Tingting quickly helped Song Fei up. \u201cSong Fei, don\u2019t give us such a big bow. We can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Thinking of how Mu Mian nearly killed Song Fei previously, Du Tingting felt uneasy and didn\u2019t dare to look Song Fei in the eye.\n Mu Mian finally snapped out of his trance. He suppressed the uneasiness in his heart and spoke in an ethereal voice. \u201cQuickly enter the house.\u201d\n The two sisters followed Mu Mian and the other two into the Mu Family residence.\n Before it was time for dinner, Du Tingting pulled the two sisters to the sofa and sat down. Du Tingting asked Song Fei many questions, but she was smart and considerate enough not to ask why she had left the convalescent hospital without informing them that night.\n Instead, it was Mu Qiu who asked, \u201cSister Fei, you left the convalescent hospital alone after waking up. Where did you go? We were all worried sick.\u201d\n Not sure if Mu Qiu\u2019s words displeased Song Fei, but Song Fei\u2019s face darkened as she looked at Mu Qiu expressionlessly. Mu Qiu\u2019s heart shuddered. Unable to resist Song Fei\u2019s stare, she slowly lowered her head.\n Seeing that Mu Qiu\u2019s scalp went numb, Song Fei then said coldly, \u201cMiss Mu Qiu, you should just call me Song Fei.\u201d Sister Fei or whatever, it sounded disgusting.\n The bastard who stole her heart was not worthy of calling her elder sister.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

A helpless expression appeared on her face as she obediently corrected herself. \u201cSong Fei.\u201d\n Song Ci saw Mu Qiu\u2019s aggrieved look from the corner of her eye and felt a rush of joy.\n Damn!\n Du Tingting could tell that Song Fei disliked Mu Qiu. Although she didn\u2019t know why Song Fei disliked her own daughter so much, as an elder, she didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate for her to ask about matters between juniors.\n Moreover, Song Fei was not Song Ci. She was still estranged from the Mu Family.\n Since Mu Qiu had already brought up that matter, Du Tingting didn\u2019t avoid it anymore. She asked Song Fei, \u201cSong Fei, can you tell Aunty why you left the convalescent hospital?\u201d\n Hearing Du Tingting\u2019s question, Song Fei explained. \u201cActually, when I just woke up, my mind was in a mess and I couldn\u2019t differentiate reality from illusion. I didn\u2019t even know when I left the convalescent hospital. Only when I recovered fully did I know that my parents are no longer around. In this world, I only have Song Ci as my family.\u201d\n ]\u201dI see. In that case, how did you survive this period? Where did you live?\u201d Du Tingting asked again.\n Song Fei said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either. I just wandered around in a daze.\u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart ached slightly for Song Fei. She grabbed her hand and looked at her lovingly. \u201cSong Ci calls me mother. If you don\u2019t mind, you can call me mother too. I will be your family in the future.\u201d\n Song Fei knew that Du Tingting had never participated in those schemes, but she was not Song Ci. She had never been raised by the Mu Family, so she definitely couldn\u2019t call Du Tingting mother.\n Song Fei pulled her hand back from Du Tingting\u2019s grip. \u201cMy memory is still stuck at the time of the Bijiang City earthquake. To me, my parents have just passed away a few days ago...\u201d\n \u201cI am sorry, I am unable to address anyone other than my mother as mother. Madam Du, please forgive me.\u201d\n Being rejected by Song Fei, Du Tingting didn\u2019t feel embarrassed at all. Instead, her heart ached even more for Song Fei*. How terrible must Song Fei feel to be forced to accept the news of her parents\u2019 deaths?*\n \u201cCall me Auntie Du then.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang walked over, leaned over to Mu Mian and said, \u201cSir, the food is ready.\u201d\n Mu Mian stood up and said to Song Fei and Song Ci, \u201cLet\u2019s eat first. We can chat after that.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The meal was rather lively. Auntie Zhang was very meticulous and made light dishes that were suitable for Song Fei. After the meal, Song Fei and Song Ci arranged to meet Mu Mian in the study to discuss something.\n Mu Qiu, Du Tingting and her daughter sat on the sofa downstairs. Mu Qiu turned to ask Du Tingting, \u201cMother, don\u2019t you think Song Fei is especially... scary?\u201d Mu Qiu had never seen such a cold glint in anyone\u2019s eyes.\n Recalling Song Fei\u2019s expression, Du Tingting said, \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating things. At most, she doesn\u2019t like to speak and is a little quiet.\u201d\n Mu Qiu frowned but didn\u2019t say anything.\n I just feel that there\u2019s something strange about Song Fei.\n In the study.\n Mu Mian stared at the cheque on the table, his lips curling into a mocking smile. He looked up at Song Ci, as if his heart had been chilled, his expression very malicious. \u201cJust because I objected to your marriage with that Han Zhan guy and cut off all ties with you, you really want to cut off all ties with my Mu Family?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head slightly and said respectfully, \u201cFather, this has nothing to do with my marriage.\u201d\n Mu Mian knocked on the cheque. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201d Song Fei, who was sitting on the sofa, spoke slowly. \u201cI was born two minutes before Song Ci, so I am her elder sister. An elder sister is like a mother and father. In the past, I was in a coma and Song Ci was homeless. Mr. Mu has taken good care of her. I am very grateful.\u201d\n \u201cBut now that I am awake, Song Ci is no longer a homeless orphan.\u201d Song Fei sat up straight and looked straight into Mu Mian\u2019s eyes. \u201cWherever I am, it will be Song Ci\u2019s home.\u201d\n Glancing at Song Ci, who was standing stiffly at the study table, Song Fei\u2019s heart ached as she thought of the hard times Song Ci had been through. She glanced at the cheque on the table and said to Mu Mian in a low voice, \u201cMr. Mu, I am here to fetch Song Ci home.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist turning to look at Song Fei.\n She sat there lazily like a small hill, making Song Ci feel at ease.\n Mu Mian pursed his lips as he gazed wordlessly at Song Fei, who was sitting on the sofa with a slender figure. Song Fei looked frail and fragile, but she exuded the aura of a majestic mountain.\n Mu Mian suddenly laughed in satisfaction, which attracted the attention of the Song sisters.\n Mu Mian pointed at Song Fei. \u201cSong Fei, if you were a man, you would definitely be the envy of the entire Wangdong City.\u201d\n Between Song Ci and Song Fei, if Mu Mian had to choose a child to adopt, he would be more willing to adopt Song Fei. Unlike Song Ci, who was beautiful but not smart, Song Fei was obviously someone with a unique personality. Such a person was unruly and difficult to control, but once controlled, she was a sharp weapon!\n What a pity.\n Faced with Mu Mian\u2019s praise, Song Fei didn\u2019t think much of it. She spoke in her most casual and arrogant tone. \u201cI am a woman and I will still impress them.\u201d\n Mu Mian was slightly taken aback by her words. His smile widened.\n \u201cHow charismatic!\u201d\n The sisters didn\u2019t stay long at the Mu Family residence before bidding Mu Mian farewell.\n After they left, Du Tingting hurried upstairs to the study to look for Mu Mian. She saw that Mu Mian\u2019s expression was slightly dark and couldn\u2019t help feeling uneasy. \u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d\n Mu Mian took out a piece of paper from the drawer and threw it on the table. Du Tingting picked it up and saw that it was a cheque with a value of 16 million yuan. She was slightly shocked. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d\n Mu Mian put on an enigmatic expression. He stared at the cheque and said mockingly, \u201cAll these years, Song Ci has been taking note of every single penny we spent on the Song sisters.\u201d\n When Song Ci first came to the Mu Family, she used the Mu Family\u2019s money for her school fees and living expenses. After that, she started earning her own money and almost never asked Mu Mian for money again.\n \u201cWhat kind of mentality do you think Song Ci had back then when she recorded her debts? 16.4 million yuan...\u201d Mu Mian stared at that number and sneered.\u201d You really can\u2019t get used to such ingrates. \u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart also ached slightly at those words. She doted on Song Ci like she was her biological daughter, but Song Ci never treated them as real family from the start to the end. If not for the fact that she was already prepared to leave, she wouldn\u2019t have recorded the bill.\n \u201cSo Song Song has completely cut off all ties with us?\u201d Du Tingting looked slightly sad.\n Mu Mian remained silent.\n Du Tingting felt despondent but also felt relieved.\n This is good too.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

He said, \u201cI know she is awake.\u201d Song Fei had already come to visit us. How can I not know that she\u2019s awake?\n Du Tingting gripped the corner of the study table tightly and said in a trembling voice, \u201cIf you had really given Song Fei\u2019s heart to Qiu-er then, you would be committing murder, hubby!\u201d\n Mu Mian was stunned.\n Feeling slightly guilty, he stammered. \u201cAt that time, Song Fei was in a coma for eight years. Even the doctor said that the chances of her waking up were close to zero. How could I have known that she would really wake up?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you feel guilty seeing that child Song Fei today?\u201d Du Tingting\u2019s forehead was covered in a thin layer of sweat.

The moment I look at her, I think of all the sins you nearly committed...\u201d\n Inside the room, the husband and wife were arguing in low voices. Outside the room, Mu Qiu overheard her parents\u2019 conversation. She looked bewildered and shocked. My father had nearly killed Song Fei to save me!\n In that case, Song Fei and her sister\u2019s hearts are truly compatible with mine?\n \u201cTingting, give me some peace and quiet for a while, alright?\u201d Mu Mian didn\u2019t wish to continue discussing this matter with Du Tingting. His head hurt. Du Tingting\u2019s gaze softened when she saw Mu Mian massaging his temples again.\n She instructed Mu Mian gently. \u201cHave a good rest then. I am going to take a nap.\u201d\n Du Tingting opened the door to the study and was about to return to her room, when she saw a skirt flash past the corner of the staircase.\n Du Tingting asked, \u201cQiu-er?\u201d\n Mu Qiu stepped back and stood on the platform. She looked down at Du Tingting. \u201cMother, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Seeing that Mu Qiu\u2019s expression was normal, Du Tingting guessed that she must not have heard her conversation with her husband. Only then did Du Tingting relax. \u201cDon\u2019t play with your cell phone in the afternoon. Get some rest.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll return to my room then.\u201d\n Outside the room, the mother-daughter duo had returned to their respective rooms. Inside the study, Mu Mian felt very troubled. He rubbed his aching head, opened his laptop, logged onto a website, and checked the meeting center.\n : [Hi, there are very few RH-negative hearts. We have yet to find a suitable heart for you. Please wait a little longer.]\n Mu Mian\u2019s head hurt even more at this reply.\n Is it really that rare?\n Mu Mian held onto a glimmer of hope as he replied: [I am rich. I can add more money, but my daughter doesn\u2019t have much time left. I really cannot continue wasting time. Can you think of a way?]\n The other party continued to type.\n After a few minutes, the message was sent.\n : [I can\u2019t kill for you.]\n : [Let\u2019s wait a little longer. We will try our best to find it.]\n Mu Mian seemed to see hope.\n After Song Ci and her sister left the Mu Family, they walked to the main entrance of the Amethyst Gated Community and waited for Long Yu. Song Ci felt rather sleepy and hugged a pillow to sleep when she boarded the car.\n Song Fei supported Song Ci\u2019s shoulder and pressed Song Ci\u2019s head against her own thigh. \u201cIt will be easier to sleep this way.\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her head against Song Fei\u2019s thigh and fell asleep. Song Fei also felt sleepy. She looked up and closed her eyes for her afternoon nap. Just when she was about to fall asleep, the pocket of her pants that was close to her thigh started vibrating.\n Song Fei took out her cell phone and received a message.\n : [S, I have replied according to your instructions.]\n Song Fei\u2019s fingers twitched as she replied: [You must kill off all of Mu Mian\u2019s hopes.]\n : [Got it.]\n Long Yu sent Song Fei to Yan Jiang\u2019s house first, before sending Song Ci back. Song Fei alighted and entered the house. After confirming that Yan Jiang was not at home, she went to Yan Jiang\u2019s study and turned on his laptop.\n ]Song Fei logged into her own WeChat account and entered a number that she memorized into the \u2018add friends\u2019 column. Through that number, Song Fei really managed to find Fu Hanshen\u2019s WeChat.\n Fu Hanshen\u2019s WeChat name was very simple: \u201cF\u201d. Song Fei clicked on the friend request, wrote one word, and sent it over.\n Fu Hanshen returned home that night, turned on his laptop, logged into WeChat habitually to check his messages, and saw a new friend request. He didn\u2019t think much of it, and just opened it to see the details.\n The person who added him was a stranger. His WeChat name was S. There was only one word on his friend request details:\n Teacher.\n Fu Hanshen was slightly stunned and his heartbeat quickened.\n Teacher...\n Although he had lectured classes in school before, those students all addressed him respectfully as Professor Fu. His students were all over the world, but there was only one person who was qualified to call him teacher.\n Song Fei, who was his only beloved disciple.\n But that child had fallen into a coma eight years ago.\n Is it her?\n Fu Hanshen hesitated for a moment before clicking on \u2018accept\u2019.\n Yan Jiang was rather busy at work and would only be home very late these few days. When it was time for dinner, he ordered a meal for Song Fei at Meituan Food Delivery. Song Fei ate the lean meat porridge that Yan Jiang had ordered for her and drank a bottle of rib soup with kelp, before returning to the study.\n Seeing that Fu Hanshen had already accepted her friend request, Song Ci hurriedly sat down.\n She sent a message to Fu Hanshen.\n Song Fei: [Teacher.]\n The other end replied very quickly: [You are?]\n Song Fei sent Fu Han a video call request.\n Fu Hanshen was still refusing to accept the video call, but Song Fei was in no hurry and allowed the video call to continue ringing. Just when the video was about to automatically end, Fu Hanshen accepted the call within the last few seconds.\n A fair and peerlessly beautiful face appeared in Fu Hanshen\u2019s line of sight. Looking at that face, Fu Hanshen knew that this was his beloved disciple, Song Fei. That world-weary, arrogant expression was something that no one else could imitate.\n Fu Hanshen couldn\u2019t believe that Song Fei had really awoken. He was slightly agitated and his lips quivered. \u201cXiao Fei...\u201d Once the words \u201d Xiao Fei \u201cleft his lips, Fu Hanshen was somewhat speechless.\n Song Fei looked at Fu Hanshen silently. After a moment, she pursed her lips and said in disdain, \u201cTeacher, you have white hair now.\u201d Eight years ago, Song Fei\u2019s voice was still that of a teenage girl. Hearing Song Fei\u2019s cold, unfamiliar voice, Fu Han\u2019s hand trembled and he suddenly hung up the video call.\n He got up and hurried over to the window, stepping over the mess of photocopies on the floor.\n Fu Hanshen leaned against the window sill, rested his hand on his forehead, closed his eyes, and composed himself. Fifteen minutes later, Fu Hanshen walked back to the study table, sat down, and took the initiative to send Song Fei a video.\n Song Fei had been sitting quietly in front of her computer, waiting for a reply. Once the video call rang, Song Fei accepted the call. Seeing that Fu Han had calmed down, Song Fei gave him a rare smile.\n She said, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m back.\u201d\n Frowning at his beloved disciple, Fu Hanzhen said emotionally, \u201cI\u2019ve waited eight years for you to say this.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "143": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-144\n\n Chapter 143: Cheng Ziang Knows Han Wangwang?  Eight years ago, on that night, Fu Hanshen had opened QQ software to exchange his latest research insights with his own student. He had sent the compiled document to Song Fei for her to look through and wanted to listen to her opinion.\n Fu Hanshen saw that Song Fei had accepted the document. Thinking that she should have finished reading it, he asked her for her opinion.\n The message was like a rock sinking into the ocean and there was no response.\n At that time, Fu Hanshen felt that it was strange and thought that Song Fei had fallen asleep from playing too much during the day, so he logged out of QQ and turned off his computer. He had just switched off his computer when he received a call from his good friend. His friend said, \u201cHanshen, did Song Fei go to Bijiang City with her family?\u201d\n Every time he mentioned Song Fei to his good friends, Fu Hanshen would feel very proud. Hearing the anxious tone in his friend\u2019s voice, Fu Hanshen felt it was strange. \u201cShe\u2019s in Bijiang City. Why?\u201d\n His good friend said, \u201cHanshen, there was a major earthquake in Bijiang City two minutes ago. The initial estimate is 7.9 magnitude!\u201d\n Fu Hanshen stood frozen on the spot, his feet seemingly nailed to the ground.\n All these years, Fu Hanshen had been waiting for Song Fei to say: Teacher, I am back.\n Today, she finally said it!\n Fu Hanshen\u2019s eyes reddened uncontrollably. He sized up his beloved disciple and saw that she was frail and fragile. His heart ached. \u201cYou\u2019re so skinny that you look like a ghost. Haven\u2019t you eaten?\u201d\n In front of this teacher who doted on her so much, Song Fei finally revealed the fragile side of a little girl. She shook her head with reddened eyes and said coquettishly, \u201cAfter eight years of nutrient fluids, it would be a wonder if I didn\u2019t lose weight.\u201d\n After a pause, Song Fei added, \u201cI want to eat Teacher\u2019s wife\u2019s fried fish.\u201d\n Fu Hanshen smiled through his tears. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my wife over to visit you and make you fried fish!\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n At the mention of meeting up, Song Fei hurriedly asked shamelessly, \u201cWhen will Teacher come to Wangdong City for a chat? I want to meet you.\u201d\n Fu Hanshen rolled his eyes at the sky and retorted. \u201cI am your teacher, shouldn\u2019t you come and visit me?\u201d He pouted and scolded, \u201cYou heartless girl!\u201d\n Song Fei pushed the extremes of shamelessness, as she said, \u201cI just woke up not long ago. I am weak and can\u2019t take much torture.\u201d\n Fu Hanshen\u2019s heart ached but he felt very angry at the same time. \u201cWait for two days. I have a project that is ending soon. I will go look for you after it ends.\u201d\n \u201cAlright Teacher, I will wait for you.\u201d\n After ending the video call, Fu Hanshen walked out of the study and went downstairs to make coffee. As he was very happy, he couldn\u2019t help humming a tune.\n \u201cAre you in a good mood?\u201d Fu Hanshen turned and looked at the person who had suddenly appeared behind him. The woman in front of him was wearing a pure white t-shirt and a pale blue denim jacket. Her hair reached her shoulders and her clear eyes were filled with wisdom and courage.\n This was Fu Hanshen\u2019s lover, Shen Zhiyi, a war correspondent.\n The husband and wife had been married for more than 10 years. Due to their personalities, they were very compatible with each other, so though they often went their separate ways, they were still very loving. \u201cWhat happened? You even started humming a song.\u201d\n Fu Han grabbed Shen Zhiyi\u2019s hand and said, \u201cTake a guess.\u201d\n Shen Zhiyi tried to guess the reason for the expression on Fu Hanshen\u2019s face.\n Fu Hanshen was usually a stable and reserved person. He seldom revealed his emotions. Seeing that he was glowing with vigor, Shen Zhiyi knew that something major must have happened. Otherwise, Fu Hanshen would not have lost his composure like this.\n Thinking for a moment, Shen Zhiyi asked uncertainly, \u201cHas someone finally developed the medicine to cure the Ebola virus?\u201d This was the only thing she could think of. All these years, Fu Hanshen had been researching the virus.\n Fu Hanshen felt rather helpless. He said, \u201cIf we really managed to develop it, I will definitely be as busy as a spinning top. I won\u2019t have the time to go home.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Shen Zhiyi couldn\u2019t think of an answer and decided not to ponder further. \u201cAre you willing to tell me or not?\u201d\n Fu Hanshen hugged Shen Zhiyi\u2019s waist and shared his greatest joy with her. \u201cSong Fei is awake.\u201d\n Hearing this, Shen Zhiyi was first stunned, then her face lit up with joy. \u201cReally?\u201d\n The two of them had been married for 10 years and didn\u2019t have any children, planning to be a dink family. Song Fei was Fu Hanshen\u2019s only student. She was smart and quick-witted. At a young age, she had already displayed astonishing talent in virology and chemistry. Even Shen Zhiyi liked Song Fei a lot.\n That year when Song Fei became a vegetable, Shen Zhiyi even cried a few times. In the past eight years, whenever Shen Zhiyi returned for vacation from her war zone, she would always find time to visit Song Fei in Wangdong City.\n Shen Zhiyi was pleasantly surprised to suddenly know that Song Fei was awake.\n Fu Hanshen nodded vigorously. \u201cShe\u2019s really awake. She even called me on WeChat just now. I\u2019ll go to Wangdong City to visit her in a few days.\u201d Fu Hanshen saw that Shen Zhiyi\u2019s eyes were bright and full of vigor, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me.\u201d\n Shen Zhiyi nodded in agreement. \u201cOf course. I still have seven days off. I can make it.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n ...\n After dropping Song Fei off at Yan Jiang\u2019s place, Song Ci got Long Yu to drive her to a wool shop. She took Song Fei\u2019s advice and decided to knit a sweater for Old Master.\n Song Ci went to take a bath before sitting down on the sofa to knit. She had just started, when Han Wangwang suddenly sent her a message.\n Song Ci opened her WeChat and saw Han Wangwang saying: [Little Aunt, give me your vote!] Curious, Song Ci opened the voting link sent by Han Wangwang.\n Only when she opened the link did she know that Han Wangwang had participated in the nationwide DJ Competition. Due to her good looks and incredible skills, Han Wangwang had even gotten second place.\n Han Wangwang told Song Ci: [The person in first place is an internet sensation. He has a huge fan base and I can\u2019t win against him. Little Aunt, you have a lot of fans. Quickly help me canvass for votes. Love you!] In order to express her gratitude, Han Wangwang immediately sent Song Ci 20 200 Yuan red packets.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t accept Han Wangwang\u2019s red packet but voted for her. She forwarded it to her Weibo account and asked her fans to vote for Han Wangwang. After that, Song Ci returned to WeChat and entered Han Wangwang\u2019s social media account to see what this little girl had been busy with recently.\n A few minutes ago, Han Wangwang had just posted on her social media account. She was sharing the link to her interview at the DJ competition.\n Han Zhan was the only mutual friend between Song Ci and Han Wangwang. She saw Han Zhan give Han Wangwang a Like, but to her surprise, there was someone whom Song Ci recognized on Han Wangwang\u2019s Weibo page.\n That person\u2019s profile picture was of a man in a white suit. His profile name was Cheng Ziang!\n Worried that she might have recognized the wrong person, Song Ci specially opened Cheng Ziang\u2019s profile photo. After seeing that his WeChat name was \u201cNot Returning Without Getting Drunk\u201d, she confirmed that this person was Cheng Ziang.\n Song Ci could not help but frown.\n How did Cheng Ziang know Han Wangwang?

    "144": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-145\n\n Chapter 144: Taking Song Ci to Work  One was a playboy and the other was a young and beautiful lady. Song Ci knew very well what Cheng Ziang was trying to do by getting close to Han Wangwang.\n Song Ci felt uneasy at the thought of Cheng Ziang\u2019s true character. She valued this very much and was worried that Han Wangwang would be deceived by Cheng Ziang. She hurriedly opened Han Wangwang\u2019s WeChat and asked: [You know Cheng Ziang?]\n Han Wangwang was probably busy and didn\u2019t reply to her.\n At this moment, Han Zhan returned, reeking of alcohol. When Song Ci was talking to him, she smelled alcohol and asked him, \u201cYou drank?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI\u2019ve rinsed my mouth, but you can still smell it?\u201d\n \u201cMy nose is very sensitive.\u201d Saying that, Song Ci pretended to look at Han Zhan warningly and said to him, \u201cIf you have someone else\u2019s perfume on you, I can smell it too.\u201d\n Han Zhan tapped her forehead. \u201cStop joking around.\u201d\n Seeing the ball of yarn on the sofa, Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cYou bought this?\u201d He stared at Song Ci\u2019s jade-like fair fingers, unable to conceal the astonishment in his eyes. \u201cYou even know how to knit?\u201d\n Song Ci lifted her chin, unable to conceal the pride on her face. She said proudly, \u201cI know how to knit both scarves and sweaters.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at the ball of yarn for a while before suddenly saying, \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold, it\u2019s time to wear a sweater.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYup, so I intend to knit a sweater for Grandpa.\u201d\n Han Zhan was strangely silent. \u201cFor Grandpa?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, my elder sister said that it would be better if we gave some handicrafts instead of those expensive gifts. Grandpa will be even happier when the present is sincere.\u201d Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat color does Grandpa like?\u201d\n ]Han Zhan had mixed feelings but still answered honestly, \u201cGrayish blue.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I will knit a grayish blue sweater then.\u201d Song Ci wasn\u2019t sure if her idea of knitting a sweater for his grandfather was reliable. She asked Han Zhan somewhat nervously, \u201cBrother Han, do you think Grandpa will like this gift?\u201d\n Han Zhan felt sour inside. \u201cOf course he likes it.\u201d Who wouldn\u2019t like a sweater personally knitted by Song Ci?\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt terrible and needed to go upstairs to calm down. He took off his jacket and was about to go upstairs, when Song Ci suddenly called him. \u201cBrother Han, let me ask you something.\u201d\n Han Zhan had already reached the third level of the staircase. Hearing this, he stopped, turned around, and looked down at Song Ci in the living room. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Song Ci told him, \u201cWang Wang is taking part in the national DJ competition.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I even voted for her. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d Thinking that Song Ci was concerned about Han Wangwang and worried that she would meet a pervert when she was a DJ, Han Zhan told her, \u201cWangwang has practiced taekwondo before, so ordinary people can\u2019t bully her. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head gently. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about this.\u201d She walked up to Han Zhan, looked up, and said, \u201cI saw an old friend in Wangwang\u2019s WeChat friend circle.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cWho?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cCheng Ziang.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cCheng Ziang?\u201d A hint of disgust and violence flashed across his eyes, but he quickly suppressed it. \u201cI will investigate this matter thoroughly.\u201d\n Song Ci was relieved to see that Han Zhan took this matter to heart. \u201cMmm, I just feel that this Cheng Ziang is unreliable and I\u2019m worried that he has ulterior motives for getting close to Wangwang, so I wanted to tell you about it.\u201d\n \u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d Rubbing Song Ci\u2019s hair, Han Zhan said, \u201cI\u2019ll go take a shower first. I still have some work to do and won\u2019t come down after bathing. I\u2019ll head straight to the study.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI will accompany you then.\u201d\n After taking a shower, Han Zhan worked in the study in his pyjamas. Song Ci was curled up in the armchair in the study, concentrating on knitting. Every now and then, Han Zhan would look up and see Song Ci struggling with the ball of yarn. His eyes would subconsciously turn gentle.\n He couldn\u2019t help but imagine that after a few decades, the two of them would be old. He would be wearing reading glasses to read books and Song Ci would be wearing reading glasses to knit. Things would be peaceful and they would grow old together.\n The two of them were busy with their own tasks. At 9.40pm, Han Zhan turned off his laptop and said to Song Ci, \u201cIt\u2019s almost 10pm. Time to sleep.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cWait a minute, I will finish these parts first.\u201d\n Han Zhan snatched the needle and thread from her hand, pulled Song Ci back to the master bedroom, and pinned her under the blankets. \u201cSleep. It\u2019s not good to sleep late.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci couldn\u2019t hold back her sarcasm. \u201cIt\u2019s only during my menstrual visit that you can sleep on time. How many days have you been sleeping on time usually?\u201d They had agreed to sleep on time at 10pm before their wedding, but over the past month, many nights had gone awry.\n Han Zhan suddenly turned deaf and mute. He didn\u2019t utter a single word even after hearing her complaints.\n Song Ci played with Han Zhan\u2019s hair for a while and was about to fall asleep. Just before she fell asleep, she seemed to hear Han Zhan mutter by her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold and I haven\u2019t bought a sweater this year...\u201d\n Song Ci thought to herself: Buy it then. Do you still lack money to buy a sweater?\n The next morning, Han Zhan pulled Song Ci out of bed and the two of them started their morning exercises in the gym.\n fter the training ended, Han Zhan took a shower and changed clothes while instructing Song Ci. \u201cNext Tuesday is my grandmother\u2019s death anniversary. This year, you will accompany me back to my hometown and we will proceed on Monday. We will stay at my hometown for a few days and then go for a honeymoon trip to Austria.\u201d\n \u201cI will be rather busy with work these few days, so I\u2019ll be back slightly later tonight. You must eat on time yourself.\u201d\n earing Han Zhan muttering non-stop, Song Ci casually complained. \u201cSince you\u2019re so worried, why don\u2019t you just bring me to the company and work with you?\u201d\n Han Zhan thought about it seriously and felt that Song Ci\u2019s suggestion was very sensible and considerate. Han Zhan hurriedly opened the wardrobe, took out a long-sleeved dress, and threw it to Song Ci. \u201cChange your clothes and come to work with me!\u201d\n Song Ci hugged her clothes and asked hesitantly, \u201c... Are you for real?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci complained to Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019ve changed. In the past, you looked down on employees who flirted during work hours the most.\u201d\n Han Zhan replied calmly, \u201cI am not an employee. I am the boss. The boss can date during office hours.\u201d\n \u201cYou are the boss. You have your reasons.\u201d\n Thus, this morning, Han Zhan carried a briefcase while Song Ci carried a tote bag containing knitting needles. Together with Han Zhan, they entered Zeus Airlines\u2019 headquarters.\n [fuzzy]Li Li arrived slightly later. He didn\u2019t find it strange at all when he heard from the secretarial office that Han Zhan had brought his wife to work today. Instead, he felt like this day had finally arrived.\n This morning, Li Li was going to personally receive an important overseas partner. Before they set off, Li Li specially came to Han Zhan\u2019s office to see what the two of them were up to.\n Li Li knocked on the door and kindly raised his voice to say to the people inside, \u201cI\u2019 m coming in!\u201d After waiting for a few seconds, he felt that the adulterous couple inside should have already put on their clothes. Only then did Li Li open the door and enter.\n To his disappointment, Han Zhan and Song Ci weren\u2019t doing anything embarrassing.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "145": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-146\n\n Chapter 145: He Just Wants to Woo Me  Song Ci sat elegantly on the sofa, knitting a sweater with two needles in her hands. She looked breathtakingly beautiful. Meanwhile, Han Zhan was sitting upright behind his desk, wearing glasses and was very focused on his work.\n Li Li was slightly disappointed.\n \u201cWhat nonsense are you thinking about again?\u201d Han Zhan glanced at Li Li with a faint smile and asked him, \u201cWhat do you wish to see when you push open the door?\u201d\n Li Li sensibly didn\u2019t answer this provocative question. He changed the topic and pointed at the already embryonic sweater on Song Ci\u2019s lap. With an envious expression, he said, \u201cMadam must have knitted this for Mr. Han. Mr. Han is so lucky and Madam is so virtuous.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan suddenly touched his glasses but didn\u2019t say anything.\n Li Li realized that something was off. If this was in the past, Han Zhan\u2019s tail would have been wagging vigorously.\n Song Ci turned and looked at the slightly jealous Han Zhan. She then looked down at the sweater on her lap and said with a smile, \u201cI am returning to his hometown in Shunchen City next week. This is for Grandpa. I will knit another one for Brother Han in two days.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan suddenly looked up at Song Ci and said, \u201cI like navy blue.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI feel that white is nicer and makes Brother Han look easygoing and warm. I like men who look gentle and dependable.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI also think white suits me.\u201d Han Zhan was like a fence-sitter; he would go wherever Song Ci\u2019s wind blew.\n Li Li regretted coming in to ask for trouble. \u201cPlease continue. My life is tough. I have to go out and accompany my business partners.\u201d Li Li hurriedly turned and left.\n After Li Li left, Song Ci turned back to look at Han Zhan. She saw that Han Zhan was drinking his nourishing tea and pitied Li Li\u2019s hard life in her heart. \u201cBrother Han is not kind. Manager Li is working so hard for the company, yet you are so carefree.\u201d\n Han Zhan put down the thermos cup and said expressionlessly, \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to care for the handicapped.\u201d\n Song Ci was so angry that she laughed.\n In the afternoon, Song Ci and Han Zhan went to the seventh floor for lunch. After returning to the office, Song Ci went into Han Zhan\u2019s room to take a nap. Han Zhan didn\u2019t sleep, as he sat in the office to handle some work.\n The line suddenly rang. Han Zhan picked up the phone and heard the young man at the front desk say in his clear voice, \u201cMr. Han, a lady with the last name Han is looking for you.\u201d\n Han Zhan hid the contract with the proposal and replied, \u201cLet her in.\u201d\n Shortly after, the door to the office was pulled open and Han Wangwang walked in wearing flat white shoes. She still had her hair in a ponytail and was wearing a dirty pink hat with a dirty pink hip-hop jacket.\n Han Wangwang was carrying a black leather shoulder bag and sat on the sofa that Song Ci had previously sat on. Once she sat down, she said \u201cLittle Uncle, the young man at the front desk of your company is very handsome. He looks quite like my boyfriend, Wang Junkai. He\u2019s very handsome. Pass me his WeChat number.\u201d\n Han Zhan rejected her mercilessly. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as selling yourself for honor in my employee contract.\u201d\n Han Wangwang stuck out her tongue. \u201cI will go get it myself later.\u201d Han Wangwang was slightly disappointed that she didn\u2019t manage to get his WeChat number. She leaned back on the sofa, her entire body laid out lazily like a salted fish with no ambition.\n Han Zhan suddenly knocked on the keyboard. Hearing the sound, Han Wangwang opened his eyes and looked at Han Zhan listlessly. She asked weakly, \u201cLittle Uncle, why did you call me over?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s grayish blue eyes shot Han Wangwang an unhappy look. He said unhappily, \u201cLower your voice when you speak.\u201d\n Han Wangwang was dazed. She looked around the office and didn\u2019t see a third person. She felt it was strange. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else around. Why are you afraid of being overheard?\u201d Han Wangwang\u2019s eyes instinctively drifted below Han Zhan\u2019s desk.\n \u201cLittle Uncle, is there someone hiding under your table...\u201d Han Wangwang saw all sorts of nonsense, and many dirty thoughts flashed across her mind.\n Han Zhan sneered and mocked her. \u201cYour aunt\u2019s newly bought detergent is very good at removing dirt. When you are free, come visit our house. I will get your aunt to help you wash your brains.\u201d\n Han Wangwang opened her mouth and muttered unhappily, \u201cLittle Aunt should be the first to be cleaned...\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows. He actually couldn\u2019t retort.\n My Baby Ci\u2019s brains are indeed rather dirty.\n Coughing uncomfortably, Han Zhan tilted his head and looked at the tightly shut door of the lounge. He then told Han Wangwang, \u201cYour little aunt is taking an afternoon nap inside.\u201d\n Han Wangwang was suddenly enlightened. She hurriedly nodded and said in a small voice, \u201cYes.\u201d She threw down her bag, got up, walked up to Han Zhan\u2019s desk, squatted down beside it, tilted her head, and looked at Han Zhan working.\n Her little uncle was so handsome when he was silent. The moment he spoke, his malicious face made one want to hit him.\n After admiring his handsome face for a while, Han Wangwang asked him again, \u201cLittle Uncle, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Han Zhan turned the computer around and aimed the screen at Han Wangwang. \u201cYou know this person, right?\u201d\n Han Wangwang glanced at the computer screen and saw a handsome but ruthless man. She nodded expressionlessly. \u201cI know him. His surname is Cheng. He has been bothering me recently.\u201d\n Han Wangwang didn\u2019t know why her uncle was asking about Cheng Ziang. She asked Han Zhan, puzzled, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this person? Is there a problem?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cHis name is Cheng Ziang, the Second Young Master of Chuan Dong Group.\u201d\n Han Wangwang nodded again. \u201cI know.\u201d\n \u201cIs he wooing you?\u201d Han Zhan asked again.\n Han Wangwang pouted. She knew her place. \u201cHe just wants to woo me.\u201d\n Han Zhan was very pleased to see that she knew just how attractive she was. \u201cIt seems you\u2019re not too stupid to know that he just wants to woo you.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Han Wangwang rolled his eyes at him.\n \u201cDon\u2019t glare at me. You have no manners.\u201d Han Zhan stretched out his left hand and placed his palm on Han Wangwang\u2019s forehead, turning her face to the other side.  Staring at Han Wangwang\u2019s profile, Han Zhan dropped the bait. \u201cDo me a favor. After this is over, I will persuade your father to let you study at the Southern Medical University.\u201d\n Han Wangwang slapped Han Zhan\u2019s hand away, looked up, stared at Han Zhan with shining eyes, and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cReall?!\u201d\n \u201cLower your voice.\u201d Han Zhan disliked how loud Han Wangwang was.\n The world was big, but a wife\u2019s sleep was the greatest.\n Han Wangwang hurriedly shut her mouth and made a zipping motion.\n Han Wangwang was very intelligent and talented in mathematics. Her father hoped that she could become a mathematician and a scientist in the future, but Han Wangwang\u2019s ambition was not this and she wanted to become a military doctor.\n Han Wangwang reached out and carefully tugged at Han Zhan\u2019s clothes in an ingratiating manner. \u201cLittle Uncle, tell me, what do you want me to do? As long as it\u2019s not murder or arson, I dare to do it!\u201d\n Like a loving elder, Han Zhan patted Han Wangwang\u2019s shoulder gently and said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2014between me and this man called Cheng Ziang, there\u2019s some enmity that needs to be settled. Wangwang, what about you do as I say...\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "146": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-147\n\n Chapter 146: The Reason I Hate Long Hair  After hearing Han Zhan\u2019s plan, Han Wangwang looked very serious.\n \u201cLittle Uncle, you are so inhumane.\u201d Han Wangwang rubbed the goosebumps on her arms and said fearfully, \u201cI didn\u2019t offend you, right?\u201d She was afraid that she would be betrayed by Han Zhan one day, without even knowing the inside story.\n Han Zhan snorted and ignored her.\n \u201cI will make this deal.\u201d Han Wangwang poked Han Zhan\u2019s arm and reminded him. \u201cBut you have to promise that you will definitely do a good job teaching my father.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Han Wangwang was satisfied.\n \u201cI\u2019ll get going then.\u201d Han Wangwang walked to the sofa, picked up her backpack, turned back, and said coquettishly to Han Zhan, \u201cLittle Uncle, I\u2019ve been short on cash recently. Can you lend a hand to your poor niece?\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at Han Wangwang without any warmth in his eyes and rejected her request cruelly. \u201cWangwang, your little uncle just got married and needs to support his family. He\u2019s very tight on cash.\u201d\n \u201cStingy!\u201d Han Wangwang stomped her feet, flicked her dirty braid, and hurried off.\n Song Ci was awoken by Han Wangwang\u2019s curse of \u2018stingy\u2019. She opened the door and walked out with her hair in disarray. \u201cWho came just now?\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at her slightly messy hair and thought it was rather cute. \u201cWangwang Doggy.\u201d\n \u201cYour niece?\u201d Song Ci asked him, \u201cYou told her about Cheng Ziang?\u201d\n \u201cI told her.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Aong Ci went to the washroom to tidy up her appearance, before sitting down on the sofa. She picked up the needle and thread and continued to work hard. She spent five days working overtime and finally finished making the sweater, before they returned to Shunchen City.\n After she finished knitting the sweater, Song Ci folded it up, put it in a beautiful gift box, and wrapped it up in her luggage.\n Song Ci had to get ready as she was returning to Shunchen tomorrow.\n Hearing that Han Zhan said that his grandfather lived in the countryside and this was his first time bringing his wife home, Song Ci thought of how gossipy and lively the women in the village were. She decided to dress up beautifully for Brother Han.\n As a result, Song Ci spent the entire day dressing up.\n When Han Zhan returned late at night, Song Ci was still awake and playing on her cell phone. Han Zhan saw that she was still awake and asked, \u201cAre you waiting for me?\u201d\n Nodding, Song Ci said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost 1am. Are you so busy with work?\u201d\n Han Zhan said as he took off his clothes, \u201cThere are too many things to settle and I have to make the necessary arrangements. Li Li and the rest all worked overtime with me tonight.\u201d He wanted to kiss Song Ci but felt that he had been fatigued the entire day, so he didn\u2019t smell good. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll go take a shower first.\u201d\n After taking a quick shower and brushing his teeth, Han Zhan didn\u2019t put on his pyjamas and burrowed into bed. Song Ci glanced at his exposed arm muscles and asked him with a smile, \u201cAre you being a hooligan?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cDon\u2019t you like me being a hooligan?\u201d\n Song Ci raised her brows.\n Han Zhan suddenly reached out and grabbed Song Ci\u2019s cell phone. Like a caring elder, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t just lie down and play with your cell phone. It\u2019s not good for your eyes. You\u2019re a pilot. You need to protect your eyes.\u201d\n Song Ci obediently handed the phone to Han Zhan.\n Only then did Han Zhan realize that Song Ci\u2019s hair had grown longer\u2014it was even wavy! \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your hair?\u201d Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s long hair and touched it curiously. He realized that it was exceptionally smooth and soft\u2014it should be real hair.\n Song Ci swept the ends of her hair over Han Zhan\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s growing.\u201d Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cDoes it look good?\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded. \u201cYes, but where did this hair come from...\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d Song Ci had cut all her hair at the hospital. After that, Song Ci got Li Li to buy a box for her and kept her hair inside it. \u201cThe hairdresser said that this can only be maintained for a period of time. I will go and cut it then.\u201d\n By that time, her own hair would also have grown longer and would reach her shoulders, even if she cut them.\n Han Zhan gazed at her long hair and thought of Song Ci\u2019s lovely long hair when he first met her. He couldn\u2019t help feeling slightly emotional. \u201cActually, your long hair is quite nice. It\u2019s a pity...\u201d But he didn\u2019t say what was a pity.\n Song Ci could understand Han Zhan\u2019s unspoken words. She asked him, \u201cYou don\u2019t like long hair because of Du Xueyan?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s heart welled up with jealousy at the mention of Du Xueyan.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cNot really. After I broke up with her, my grandfather saw that I didn\u2019t have any new love life and thought that I couldn\u2019t forget Du Xueyan. He was afraid that I would cling onto her forever, so he arranged many blind dates for me. Almost all of them were chosen according to Du Xueyan\u2019s image.\u201d\n \u201cI was forced to go on several blind dates and once met such a repulsive lady...\u201d\n Curious, Song Ci asked, \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t really want to say it, but couldn\u2019t stand Song Ci\u2019s coquettish manner. In the end, he still said it. \u201cAt the matchmaking site, the young man she was providing for ran over in a rage, splashed coffee on my face, and even called me a male vixen...\u201d Han Zhan looked slightly embarrassed.\n Song Ci was momentarily stunned before bursting into laughter. \u201cBlind dates are risky. Brother Han, it\u2019s not easy!\u201d\n Han Zhan also felt amused as he recalled that incident. \u201cI was quite angry then. After that, my grandfather never arranged a blind date for me again. Meanwhile, I have a fear of those beautiful girls with long hair.\u201d\n ]Meanwhile, the long-haired, seductive, and gorgeous Song Ci had become the type of woman that Han Zhan feared the most.\n After knowing that Han Zhan didn\u2019t hate long hair because of Du Xueyan, Song Ci felt slightly better. \u201cTime to sleep.\u201d She put on her eye mask and was about to fall asleep when she heard Han Zhan ask, \u201cHave you packed your things?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cHave you brought enough condoms?\u201d\n Song Ci opened her eyes. Instead of answering, she asked him with interest, \u201cHow much is enough?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n Song Ci turned off the lights. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep!\u201d\n Song Ci had a deep sleep and was awakened by Han Zhan in the morning. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get up. We need to set off for the airport.\u201d\n Mmm...\u201d Song Ci was carried up groggily by Han Zhan and stuffed into the washroom. When the cold towel landed on her face, Song Ci immediately woke up. She quickly washed her face, brushed her teeth, changed clothes, and spent some time putting on makeup.\n By the time she was done washing up, Han Zhan had already made breakfast. After breakfast, the two of them each carried a luggage bag and went out. Entering the lift, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cDidn\u2019t the driver come?\u201d\n \u201cWe will drive ourselves today and we\u2019ll leave the car at the airport. Long Yu will drive it back later.\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her hands and asked Han Zhan, \u201cCan I drive?\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at her and didn\u2019t agree or reject her. He looked slightly expectant. Song Ci stood on tiptoe and gave him a kiss. Han Zhan couldn\u2019t hold back his pretended cold expression anymore. He raised the keys and said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you drive below 60 km / h.\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d Song Ci snatched the keys away.\n Arriving at the basement, Song Ci got into the driver\u2019s seat while Han Zhan sat in the passenger\u2019s seat and fastened his seatbelt at the first instance.\n Upon seeing this, Song Ci teased him. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "147": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-148\n\n Chapter 147: Han Zhan: I am Cheap  Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. It\u2019s common sense to buckle up in a car.\u201d\n \u201cYou are a good boy.\u201d Song Ci fastened her seatbelt.\n Song Ci had not driven for a long time and was still feeling rather nervous as she started the car. The car slowly drove out of the underground carpark and onto the road, as Song Ci\u2019s muscles gradually relaxed.\n Seeing that Song Ci\u2019s car was driving steadily and her expression was more relaxed than he had expected, Han Zhan also felt relieved. He asked Song Ci, \u201cHow is it? Are you scared?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cA little.\u201d The accident had affected Song Ci greatly. She kept feeling that the car in front and behind her could lose control at any time and crash into her.\n Han Zhan saw that she kept looking at the rearview mirror to observe the cars behind, and he knew what Song Ci was afraid of. Han Zhan suddenly patted the back of her hand and said to her, \u201cYou can drive by yourself when I\u2019m by your side in the future.\u201d After a pause, Han Zhan added, \u201cIf there is really an emergency, I will be the only one in trouble. I will protect you.\u201d\n Song Ci felt very touched.\n On the way back to Shunchen City, Song Ci worked with Xiong Jian as the co-pilot. Meanwhile, Song Shiqing sat in the observation position. After the plane took off, Xiong Jian shared with Song Ci many experiences about reacting during an emergency in flight.\n Song Ci listened intently and was very energetic the entire journey.\n Arriving at Shunchen City, Xiong Jian and Song Shiqing followed Han Zhan\u2019s instructions and flew the plane back to Wangdong City. Han Zhan pulled Song Ci to the parking lot and brought her to board Aoyu Number 1.\n This was the first time in Song Ci\u2019s current life that she rode on Aoyu Number 1. When she arrived in front of the car, she realized that this car was slightly different from the photos on the official website.\n It should be custom-made.\n After boarding the car, Song Ci touched the leather seat beneath her and smiled. \u201cActually, in my previous life, I also bought this car, but I used the smart mode.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t mock Song Ci for being useless. He said, \u201cThe smart mode of this car is very safe and accurate. The research and development department is developing Aoyu Number 2 and it\u2019s expecting to be launched five years later.\u201d Thinking of Song Ci\u2019s difference, Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWas Aoyu Number 2 successfully launched?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cIt was listed. Not only was Aoyu Number Two successfully launched, your Zeus spaceship was also successfully developed. You opened up a space tourism industry that shocked the entire world. The year I died, you were already recognized as the richest man in Asia and ranked second on the wealthiest chart in the world.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart also warmed slightly at the mention of Han Zhan\u2019s final achievements. She sighed. \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019re really amazing.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cNo matter how capable I am, I\u2019m still your man.\u201d\n Song Ci felt very comforted by his words.\n Han Aoyu stayed in the countryside, so he needed to drive through many streets in Shunchen City, before returning home via the provincial road. Han Zhan chose human driving mode and steered Aoyu Number 1 towards Shunchen City with Song Ci.\n Along the way, Song Ci said, \u201cThis car looks different from what was posted on the official website. Is it custom-made?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cThere are only two of this Aoyu Number 1 model in the world. The one I\u2019m using is a gift for Grandpa.\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cWhat about the other one?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt should be sent to Wangdong City today. It\u2019s registered under your name.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly surprised. \u201cFor me?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Before Song Ci could say anything, Han Zhan said, \u201cI want to give the most special present to the most special person in my life.\u201d In this world, Han Aoyu and Song Ci held the greatest meaning in Han Zhan\u2019s life.\n Song Ci gazed at Han Zhan, her heart suddenly fluttering.\n She quietly averted her gaze and gazed out the window at the crowd. After a long while, she finally placed her hand on her chest.\n Just now, her heart was racing for Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan concentrated on driving and didn\u2019t notice anything unusual with Song Ci. But since Song Ci kept silent, Han Zhan thought she was sleepy. \u201cAre you still sleepy? Do you want to sleep?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cA little.\u201d\n They still had a long journey, and Han Zhan wanted Song Ci to chat with him for a while more. He found a topic to chat about. \u201cActually, this car is my birthday present to my grandfather.\u201d\n Han Zhan told Song Ci something else. \u201cActually, my grandmother\u2019s death anniversary is my grandfather\u2019s birthday. But ever since my grandmother passed away, my grandfather has never celebrated his birthday.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci also felt slightly sad. \u201cYour grandfather and grandmother must be very close. How did they meet?\u201d\n \u201cMy grandfather was born a boorish man, while my grandmother is a well-educated young lady from a wealthy family. Although my grandfather looks very knowledgeable now, it\u2019s all my grandmother\u2019s doing. In today\u2019s terms, my grandfather marrying my grandmother is like climbing up the social ladder.\u201d\n \u201cIn that era, they got together and had a new lease of life. My grandmother followed her father to the countryside and got to know my grandfather. She was 14 years old then and he was only 17 years old. He was born poor and came from a poor family. In order to have a bright future, he joined the military at the age of 20.\u201d\n \u201cGrandpa was already 30 years old when he returned in glory. My grandmother was 27 years old then, but she was single all this time and was waiting for my grandfather. My grandmother was a well-known old lady among the several nearby villages. Many people were waiting to see her make a fool of herself.\u201d\n \u201cLuckily, my grandmother\u2019s wait paid off. Grandpa returned with honor and married her. They spent their entire life together lovingly.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s face lit up as she listened to the real life story that was like a television drama. She said, \u201cIn that era, women who were 27 years old and still didn\u2019t get married would be criticized. Your grandmother was also very brave.\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d Han Zhan touched the steering wheel gently and suddenly said, \u201cMy mother is like my grandmother\u2014brave and devoted.\u201d\n It was rare to hear Han Zhan mention his mother. After being married for so long, Song Ci only knew that Mother Han passed away when Han Zhan was five years old, but she did not know how Mother Han died.\n Song Ci saw that Han Zhan didn\u2019t wish to talk about his biological mother, so she didn\u2019t pursue the matter. She was afraid of tearing apart the scar in Han Zhan\u2019s heart and she couldn\u2019t bear to see him in pain.\n Turning to look at the bustling streets outside the window, Song Ci ended this conversation that belonged to the older generation. She smiled. \u201cThe first time I came to Shunchen City, I was just a foreigner. The second time I\u2019m here, I\u2019m part of the Shunchen family. Fate is truly wonderful.\u201d\n Han Zhan recalled the first time he came to Shunchen City on a work trip with Song Ci. He sighed. \u201cAt that time, I felt that you were full of problems. You always wore short skirts and wasted food. You didn\u2019t eat coriander, smelly tofu, and even went to a bar...\u201d\n Song Ci complained. \u201cThen why did you still marry me?\u201d\n Han Zhan was silent for a long while before saying, \u201cBeing greedy for your beauty and your young, seductive body is my downfall.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n She was stunned by Brother Han\u2019s honesty. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to slander yourself like this.\u201d\n Han Zhan also found it funny.\n The car turned several corners on an unfamiliar street, before finally coming to a stop. Han Zhan woke up the drowsy Song Ci. \u201cBaby Ci, I\u2019ll treat you to some food.\u201d\n Song Ci reluctantly opened her eyes and looked out of the window. Once she saw the school gates of Shunchen High School, she instantly snapped out of her daze.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "148": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-149\n\n Chapter 148: I Kind of Like You Now  \u201cIs this your high school?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Han Zhan took off his seatbelt and said to Song Ci, \u201cThe pea starch jelly here is especially tasty. You will definitely like it.\u201d\n Song Ci followed Han Zhan out of the car and walked to a small stall on the left side of the school gates. She saw an old man setting up a stall. In front of his stall was a small bowl of starch jelly, which looked very clean and somewhat resembled translucent lychee meat.\n Han Zhan was too tall and had to squat down to speak to the old man. \u201cGrandpa, give me two bowls of jelly, one with parsley, and one without.\u201d\n Song Ci pulled up her skirt and squatted down like Han Zhan. She saw the old man slice the jelly into slices and sprinkle the secret garlic sauce on them.\n Song Ci actually felt slightly resistant when she smelled that fragrance. She didn\u2019t usually eat such heavy-flavored food and would always feel the garlic flavor in her mouth, after she finished it.\n The old man handed the bowl of jelly to Han Zhan. \u201cHere. It\u2019s originally priced at 8 yuan per serving, but since you bought two, I\u2019ll just charge you 15 yuan.\u201d\n Han Zhan took the starch jelly and said, \u201cThe price has increased. In the past, it was three yuan per serving.\u201d As he spoke, he took out his cell phone and scanned the WeChat.\n The old man was amused by Han Zhan\u2019s words. He rolled his eyes. \u201cI was still your uncle when it was three yuan a bowl. I\u2019m already your grandfather now.\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows. He felt that the old man\u2019s words made sense and didn\u2019t pursue the matter.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan sat under the umbrella to eat starch jelly. Han Zhan hadn\u2019t eaten this in a long time and was eating rather happily. Just when he reached the fifth piece, he suddenly heard Song Ci ask, \u201cDoes Du Xueyan like this too?\u201d\n The starch jelly was stuck in Han Zhan\u2019s throat.\n He swallowed the starch jelly with difficulty, and noticed that Song Ci didn\u2019t eat a single bite. He said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like it. She is burdened by her image as an idol and despises the garlic taste.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d Song Ci then put a piece of starch jelly into her mouth.\n Han Zhan sat stiffly on the stool, feeling slightly uneasy. Song Ci swallowed the starch jelly and commented. \u201cNot bad.\u201d She gracefully finished a bowl of starch jelly and stood up.\n Standing under the blazing sun, Song Ci called Han Zhan\u2019s name. \u201cHan Zhan.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked up and saw Song Ci\u2019s burgundy curly hair glowing in the sunlight. She was beautiful and alluring, but her expression was stubborn. Song Ci said, \u201cHan Zhan, I don\u2019t like to eat such food with heavy tastes either. But if you like it, I\u2019m willing to accompany you.\u201d\n After a pause, Song Ci added. \u201cYou must cherish it.\u201d With that, she turned around and walked into a small shop to buy a bottle of lemon water.\n After downing a mouthful of lemon water, Song Ci looked down and tightened the cap. She realized that the spokesperson for the lemon water was Du Xueyan, and her image was imprinted on the bottle. Song Ci had completely turned into a lemon drop under the lemon tree.\n Han Zhan strolled over, snatched away her lemon water, threw the bottle into the dustbin, and stuffed a sweet into her hand. Song Ci looked down at the toffee in her palm and remained silent.\n \u201cEat something sweet and don\u2019t drink anything sour,\u201d Han Zhan said.\n After a moment of silence, Song Ci unwrapped the toffee and stuffed it into her mouth.\n The tip of her tongue twirled the candy around in her mouth and a sweet taste filled it. Only then did Song Ci stand up and look at Han Zhan. Song Ci pointed at her own chest and said with drooping eyelids, \u201cHan Zhan, I feel terrible here. I still feel terrible after eating the candy.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed slightly.\n Tears welled up in Song Ci\u2019s eyes. \u201cI think I like you a little now.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s throat vibrated.\n Suddenly, he felt terrible, as if a hole had been torn in his heart and a hint of sweetness was pouring in. Han Zhan hugged Song Ci. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the past, Song Ci. I can change any flaws, but my past cannot be changed.\u201d\n Song Ci said in a low voice, \u201cI understand your reasoning, but I just don\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n Han Zhan really had no choice. Other than hugging Song Ci tightly, he did not know what else to do. After a while, Song Ci composed herself and wriggled out of Han Zhan\u2019s embrace. She reminded him, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go. Grandpa is still waiting for us to go back for lunch.\u201d\n Han Zhan was still worried and sized Song Ci up seriously for a moment. Seeing that she had really calmed down, he pulled her hand and sat back into the car.\n \u2013\n As the car drove into the suburbs, there were fewer vehicles and the farmland and three-story buildings became more and more commonplace. Song Ci lowered the window and stared at the endless green rice fields. She imagined Han Zhan pulling up his pants to plant rice and couldn\u2019t help laughing.\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cAre these season crop rice?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cWe can harvest it in another month.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s all harvesters now, right?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her hands in anticipation. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat ripe fruits does Grandpa\u2019s house have now?\u201d\n \u201cHawthorn, chestnuts, and dates are almost all ready to be harvested.\u201d\n Song Ci rolled up her sleeves. \u201cThen I will go and pick chestnuts for you to make roasted chestnut chicken.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The car turned around a corner and drove onto an asphalt road. Song Ci heard Han Zhan say, \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. It\u2019s the house hidden in the forest.\u201d\n Song Ci looked up and saw Han Zhan pointing at a villa built in a forest halfway up the hill. The villa was made of red and yellow tiles and was hidden in the forest. It was low-key and exuded a sense of luxury and mystery. This was completely different from what Song Ci had imagined.\n \u201cIt\u2019s actually a forest villa. I thought Grandpa\u2019s house was just an ordinary villa built in a rural area.\u201d\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cMy grandmother designed this herself when she was still alive.\u201d\n \u201cThis should be the most luxurious villa within a 10-mile radius.\u201d\n Han Zhan made a joke. \u201cAfter all, this is the hometown of the richest man.\u201d\n Song Ci had thought that after reaching her grandfather\u2019s house, she would be treated like a national treasure by the villagers. But after reaching her grandfather\u2019s house, Song Ci realized that there was no one at all within a kilometer of her.\n Most of the neighbors\u2019 houses were built along the road. Meanwhile, Han Aoyu\u2019s house was built halfway up the hill. A wall surrounded the villa for more than 300 meters. It was planned to be a garden, a court, a swimming pool, a school grounds and vegetable fields.\n At the entrance of the villa, the words \u201cHan Residence\u201d was written on a black metal door.\n With such a majestic aura, who would dare to come visit?\n Not only was Han Aoyu staying in this house, but his steward, Zhong Buhui, as well as the two officers in charge of protecting Old Master Han\u2019s life were also staying in the house. Seeing that Han Zhan had returned, the middle-aged man called Lin Chong\u2019an opened the door and stood aside to give Han Zhan a military salute.\n Han Zhan alighted and gave him a military salute.\n \u201cZhanzhan, long time no see. You brought your wife back to visit your grandpa?\u201d Lin Chong\u2019an glanced at Song Ci and his eyes lit up. Zhong Buhui wasn\u2019t lying. Zhanzhan\u2019s wife was indeed a great beauty.\n Han Zhan said helplessly, \u201cUncle Lin, I\u2019 m already over thirty years old. Don\u2019t call me Zhanzhan anymore.\u201d\n However, Lin Chong\u2019an said, \u201cSo what if you\u2019re in your thirties? I\u2019ll always be 10 years older than you. To me, you\u2019ll always be a child.\u201d\n Han Zhan gave up arguing.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Song Ci, this is Uncle Lin.\u201d Han Zhan introduced Lin Chong\u2019an to Song Ci.\n Song Ci had a glib tongue and hurriedly greeted him as \u2018Uncle Lin\u2019.\n Lin Chong\u2019an smiled so widely that his eyes narrowed into slits. \u201cHow obedient. Come, since it\u2019s our first time meeting, I prepared a red packet for you. Take it.\u201d Lin Chong\u2019an took out a red packet and handed it to Song Ci, who was sitting in the passenger seat.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t take it but looked at Han Zhan. After Han Zhan nodded, Song Ci accepted the red packet with both hands and thanked him politely.\n \u201cSorry for making you spend money, Uncle Lin.\u201d Han Zhan said.\n Lin Chong\u2019an waved his hand and sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve waited so many years for such an opportunity.\u201d We aren\u2019t afraid of giving out red packets, just afraid that we won\u2019t be able to.\n Han Zhan then said, \u201cI\u2019ll go visit Grandpa first, so I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, go ahead.\u201d\n Han Zhan drove towards the carpark. Song Ci held the red packet and smiled at him. \u201cZhanzhan?\u201d\n Han Zhan pretended to be deaf.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t open the red packet. She stuffed it into her bag and followed Han Zhan into the Han residence.\n Han Aoyu personally cooked, while Zhong Buhui assisted from the side. The other subordinate was arranging the training equipment at the school grounds. Hearing Han Zhan and Song Ci\u2019s talking, Han Aoyu turned off the stove, washed his hands, and rubbed them on his apron, before walking out slowly.\n \u201cLass Song, you guys are finally here! Come quickly, I made sausages and duck hotpot for you. We\u2019ll have hotpot with dried bamboo shoots later!\u201d Han Aoyu grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand. He was so anxious to show off his cooking that he ignored Han Zhan who was beside him.\n Han Aoyu pulled Song Ci into the kitchen.\n Song Ci saw that Han Aoyu was still busy in the kitchen even though he was already in his 80s, and felt very apologetic. She took off the apron on the hook and wanted to help. \u201cGrandpa, quickly rest. Let me make it.\u201d\n Han Aoyu hurriedly stopped her. \u201cGo away, go away. I\u2019ve cooked for his grandmother my entire life and am already used to it. With me, you won\u2019t have the chance to cook.\u201d Looking at Song Ci\u2019s fair and clean hands, Han Aoyu added, \u201cYour hands are so delicate and clean. Cooking is a waste.\u201d\n Song Ci looked helplessly at that tall figure outside the kitchen and hurriedly said, \u201cBrother Han, aren\u2019t you coming to help Grandpa cook?\u201d\n Han Zhan had no choice but to walk over.\n Before he even got close to the kitchen counter, Han Aoyu snatched the apron from Song Ci\u2019s arms and stuffed it into Han Zhan\u2019s hands. He ordered him, \u201cThe pork trotter is done but it hasn\u2019t been soaked in soup yet. You do it.\u201d\n Han Zhan complained as he put on the apron. \u201cGrandpa, the preferential treatment shouldn\u2019t be too obvious.\u201d\n Han Aoyu opened the lid of the steamer, took out a few sausages with his chopsticks, and offered them to Song Ci. \u201cHere, try this.\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly opened her mouth and bit off two pieces of sausage in one mouth. It was very tasty. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d\n Han Aoyu chuckled and said, \u201cI know you can eat a lot, so I\u2019ve specially made a lot for you. Eat as much as you want later. Don\u2019t be embarrassed.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n In order to satisfy Han Aoyu, Song Ci had set up a \u2018foodie\u2019 image for herself the first time they met in Wangdong City. Thinking of how she would have to eat to her heart\u2019s content these few days, Song Ci couldn\u2019t help feeling slightly worried.\n I\u2019m going to gain weight!\n Han Zhan glanced at Song Ci, saw her troubled look, and smiled very disloyally.\n Dinner was ready in no time. Han Aoyu ate without any reservations, and called Zhong Buhui and his two subordinates over. The other subordinate was called Fang Shen. He was just 40 years old and had dark skin and a burly figure. He looked rather dull but his eyes were fierce.\n But when faced with Song Ci, Fang Shen gave a reserved smile. That smile made him appear rather straightforward. \u201cLittle Song, I also prepared a red packet for you. Here, take it.\u201d Song Ci was 22 years old and very young, so everyone present could call her little girl.\n Song Ci accepted Fang Shen\u2019s red packet and said thank you.\n Following which, Zhong Buhui also took out a red packet and gave it to Song Ci.\n Song Ci accepted them all.\n Seeing that everyone had given Song Ci red packets, Han Aoyu was very satisfied. He said to Song Ci, \u201cRed packets are all common items. Grandpa has prepared something nice for you. I will bring you to see it after dinner!\u201d\n Song Ci was curious. \u201cWhat did Grandpa prepare for me?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not going to reveal it now.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI also prepared a gift for Grandpa. If you\u2019re willing to tell me your surprise, I will give it to you now.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re full of tricks!\u201d Han Aoyu rolled his eyes. In the end, he couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of receiving a gift and said in surprise, \u201cI\u2019ll give you some calligraphy and paintings I\u2019ve collected, and some of the jewelry left behind by Han Zhan\u2019s grandmother and his mother...\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to imagine how expensive those gifts were.\n She felt rather embarrassed when she retrieved the sweater from her luggage. Song Ci placed the gift box on the chair, opened it, retrieved the gray-blue sweater inside, and handed it to Han Aoyu.\n \u201cI knitted a sweater for Grandpa. It\u2019s my first time knitting a sweater and I\u2019m not very familiar with it. I might not have handled the details well.\u201d Song Ci was being humble. As the sweater was meant for Han Aoyu, Song Ci had handled every single thread meticulously, so this sweater was not inferior to the ones sold on the market.\n Han Aoyu accepted the sweater and stroked it lovingly for a moment before sighing. \u201cI really like this present. Song Lass, if your grandmother was still alive, she would definitely like you very much.\u201d\n Han Aoyu looked up at the portrait of Grandma Han hanging on the wall of the main hall and said despondently, \u201cDuanfang really likes to knit. Every winter, she will always knit a few pieces for me and Zhanzhan. That winter when Duanfang left, she would sit in front of the fireplace every day to knit. She was afraid that if she passed on, no one would knit for us anymore...\u201d\n Tears welled up in Han Aoyu\u2019s eyes. He said in a choked voice, \u201cGreat, now there are people who will continue to dote on Zhanzhan.\u201d As an old man who had been through thick and thin all his life, it was very easy to stir up emotions in him at the mention of the past, and his eyes reddened.\n Song Ci looked at Han Aoyu helplessly. She didn\u2019t know what to say to comfort him.\n Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and whispered into her ear. \u201cGrandpa is missing Grandma again.\u201d It was Grandma\u2019s death anniversary tomorrow and Han Aoyu couldn\u2019t help feeling sad.\n Han Zhan glanced at Zhong Buhui. Zhong Buhui received Han Zhan\u2019s hint and hurriedly said to Han Aoyu, \u201cOld Master, it\u2019s time to eat. Zhanzhan and that lass Song came all the way here and they\u2019re still hungry!\u201d\n Han Aoyu snapped out of his trance and hurriedly kept his sweater, indicating for everyone to eat.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to ruin her image. In order to show her fondness for Han Aoyu\u2019s culinary skills, she ate two bowls of rice and half of that plate of sausages. Seeing this, Han Aoyu was very satisfied. He felt that a lady who could eat well was very fortunate.\n After dinner, Song Ci sent out the small gifts that she had prepared for Zhong Buhui, Lin Chong\u2019an, and the rest. Only then did she bring her luggage back to their room with Han Zhan. Han Zhan\u2019s room was on the third level and had a huge French window.\n Instead of calling this a bedroom, it was more like a small suite. There was a master bedroom, a small living room, and a simple little kitchen with a refrigerator, television, and wine cabinet. The design of the master bedroom was very stylish. Between the bathroom and the bed was a carved screen made of wood.\n Song Ci laid on the light grey bedsheets and looked out the window at the shade of the trees. She sighed. \u201cBrother Han, when we\u2019re old, let\u2019s return here to enjoy our retirement.\u201d\n Han Zhan was pleased by her words. \u201cOkay, as long as you like it.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Han Aoyu gave her a precious painting of Qi Baishi\u2019s real melon with a bunch of grapes on it. Song Ci felt slightly dizzy when she received this extravagant gift.\n Although the jewelry left behind by Han Zhan\u2019s grandmother and mother were not collectible treasures, they were still very valuable antiques. Amongst them, his grandmother\u2019s platinum and emerald ring was the work of an international jewelry master.\n \u201cThis brooch is Zhanzhan\u2019s mother\u2019s favorite accessory. She wore it when she graduated from university.\u201d Han Aoyu stroked that gorgeous fish-shaped brooch gently. Thinking of his daughter\u2019s graduation day, he felt terrible.\n \u201cZhanzhan\u2019s mother is unfortunate and died early. If she were still alive, she would definitely be very satisfied with you. Lass Song, do keep all these things. Our family doesn\u2019t have any other female descendants. You\u2019re the only one. Wear it if you want to. Otherwise, keep it.\u201d\n Han Aoyu placed them in a jewelry box and handed it to Song Ci.\n Song Ci hugged them but didn\u2019t feel the joy of receiving gifts. Instead, she felt the pain. She stared at Old Master Han Aoyu\u2019s slightly stooped back and hesitated before asking carefully, \u201cGrandpa, how did Mother die?\u201d\n After asking this, Song Ci saw that Old Master was stunned.\n Song Ci immediately regretted asking.\n Han Aoyu didn\u2019t turn back. He stared at Han Mulan\u2019s graduation certificate on the shelf, and said in a low voice, \u201cI think it\u2019s better for Zhanzhan to tell you personally when the time is ripe, regarding Mulan.\u201d\n He turned back and smiled kindly at Song Ci. \u201cShe is Zhanzhan\u2019s mother after all. If he is willing to tell you, he will. If he is not willing to tell you, I will not tell you too.\u201d Although Han Aoyu was at an old fashioned age, he was a role model worthy of thousands of parents learning to respect their children.\n Song Ci hurriedly nodded. \u201cGrandpa is right, I understand.\u201d\n Song Ci carried the present back to the bedroom, but Han Zhan was still not in the room. After putting everything away, Song Ci heard Han Zhan\u2019s shout from downstairs. She walked up to the French window, looked down, and saw that Han Zhan had taken off his jacket and was sparring with Lin Chong\u2019an and Fang Shen in the school grounds.\n Song Ci stared at Han Zhan\u2019s vicious fighting moves. It was not hard to imagine how dashing he looked in the military. How many secrets is Brother Han hiding?\n Thinking of how Han Zhan said there was a chestnut tree on the hill behind, Song Ci wanted to pick chestnuts. She took off her skirt, changed into a pair of long pants, and went downstairs. Song Ci wanted to find a basket but didn\u2019t know where to find it.\n She found Zhong Buhui and asked him, \u201cUncle Zhong, do you have a basket at home? I want to go to the back of the mountain to pick chestnuts.\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d\n Zhong Buhui brought her to the storeroom and found a bamboo basket for her. Song Ci took the basket and sized it up carefully. She felt that the basket looked very unique and asked him, \u201cUncle Zhong, where did you buy this basket? I want to buy two and send them back to Wangdong City. In future, we will save on bags when buying groceries. It is environmentally friendly and we can save money too.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui did not reveal to her. \u201cGuess.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help pondering. Could this basket have been made up by Grandpa? \u201cIs this Grandpa\u2019s work?\u201d\n Zhong Buhui shook his head and revealed the truth. \u201cNo, Zhanzhan made it.\u201d\n \u201cAh?\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. Brother Han actually knows how to weave baskets?\n I think weaving was written under Han Zhan\u2019s likes column.\n \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. Zhanzhan is very good at weaving.\u201d Zhong Buhui opened a wooden cupboard which was filled with all sorts of decorative items. Zhong Buhui introduced them to her, \u201cThis big rooster, this rabbit, and this goose are all Zhanzhan\u2019s creations.\u201d\n Song Ci carried the bamboo rabbit lovingly. \u201cCan you give this to me?\u201d\n \u201cJust take it.\u201d\n Song Ci brought the rabbit upstairs, before carrying the basket and accompanying Zhong Buhui to the back of the mountain to pick some chestnuts. Zhong Buhui used a bamboo stick to hit a few chestnuts, and the ripe chestnuts fell off.\n Song Ci was wearing sports shoes. She used the sole of her shoes to soften the spikes on the chestnuts. Then, she used the screwdriver to pry open the chestnuts and took out the fruit inside. As it was her first time working, Song Ci was rather clumsy and stabbed her hand several times.\n After a while, Han Zhan also arrived.\n He had just fought with Fang Shen and the rest, and was covered in a layer of sweat. Heonly wore a short-sleeved sweatshirt without a jacket. The moment he arrived, Song Ci threw the screwdriver to Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, you peel the shell.\u201d\n Han Zhan received the screwdriver and lowered his head to remove the chestnut\u2019s shell. As he worked, he said, \u201cGrandpa heard that you came to pick chestnuts and he has already started to kill the chickens.\u201d Before Song Ci could reply, Han Zhan added, \u201cGrandpa said that you are too skinny and need to nourish yourself more.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s expression was slightly complicated. \u201cYesterday night, we just had duck hotpot and tonight we are having chestnuts stewed with chicken. It\u2019s too nourishing these days.\u201d Song Ci put down the basket in her hand and pinched her slender waist and legs. She felt that after staying in the countryside for a few days, she would gain several catties of meat.\n \u201cI am going to gain weight. Does Brother Han mind?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head first. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s quite nice to have lots of meat. It\u2019s very comfortable to hug.\u201d Han Zhan looked up at Song Ci and saw that she was worried. He said, \u201cWhy is your idol burden so heavy? Whether you\u2019re a little fat or skinny, you look very good.\u201d\n Song Ci immediately took out her cell phone and found a full-body photo of herself. She had photoshopped herself to look like a 150-odd pound fatty with double chin and thick legs. She handed the photo to Han Zhan and asked, \u201cDo I look good?\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at the photo for a long while before saying, \u201cYou look better now.\u201d\n \u201cHa!\u201d Song Ci sneered. \u201cA man\u2019s mouth is a lying ghost!\u201d\n The man started lying again. \u201cBut even if you gain weight, I will still like you.\u201d\n Song Ci was feeling rather happy inside, but she put on a doubtful expression. \u201cThe fats that you men like are the breasts, but not the waist. I know your gender very well.\u201d\n As a man, Han Zhan was guilty.\n At night, his grandfather really made chestnut chicken. Song Ci ate the meat and mixed it with soup. She was really feeling a little full. She pulled Han Zhan around the school grounds a few times and did some warm-up exercises. Then, she took the basketball and went to the court with Han Zhan to play basketball.\n To Han Zhan\u2019s surprise, Song Ci\u2019s basketball skills were not bad. Her skills in dribbling the ball made his eyes light up. She knew how to dribble the ball behind her, dribble the ball between her legs, and cross-step.\n \u201cBrother Han, let me perform a three-step basketball shot for you.\u201d After Song Ci said that, she controlled the basketball to run a few steps under the basketball board, jumped, and used one hand to shoot the basketball into the basket. Han Zhan, who originally thought that Song Ci was bragging, was somewhat shocked.\n \u201cNot bad.\u201d Han Zhan praised sincerely.\n Han Zhan took off his jacket and said to Song Ci, \u201cCome, let\u2019s have a match!\u201d\n Song Ci was ambitious and had a vicious look in her eyes. She steered the ball towards the basketball hoop. Han Zhan blocked her path and even wanted to reach out to snatch her ball. Song Ci protected her ball well and tried to break through.\n But Han Zhan was like a small hill blocking her way.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t find an opportunity and was slightly annoyed by Han Zhan. She suddenly grabbed the collar of Han Zhan\u2019s sweatshirt, pulled his head down, and kissed him fiercely.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "151": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-152\n\n Chapter 151: Han Zhan: You Bullied Me  Han Zhan was dazed.\n Taking advantage of him being in a trance, Song Ci released him and hurried over to his side. She raised her arms and threw the ball into the hoop.\n From afar, Han Aoyu roared. \u201cTwo points, good shot!\u201d\n Holding the basketball, Song Ci turned and raised her brows proudly at Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan raised his brows and wanted to say something, but he shut his mouth in the end. Han Aoyu walked over, looked at his grandson in disdain, and lectured him with a straight face. \u201cUseless! Your willpower is so little!\u201d\n Han Zhan accepted the scolding honestly and couldn\u2019t retort. Han Aoyu looked at the little fox Song Ci again and commented. \u201cAlthough you won, it was an unfair victory!\u201d\n Song Ci cursed in her heart. \u201cIt\u2019s good that I won. Who cares about the process?\u201d But she admitted her mistake honestly. \u201cGrandpa is right.\u201d\n \u201cI should sleep now. You guys sleep early too.\u201d After Han Aoyu left, Han Zhan glanced at Song Ci mildly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not nice.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cYou bullied me.\u201d\n Song Ci remained silent.\n Han Zhan added, \u201cYou seduced me.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s red lips curled up. \u201cYes, I seduced you. So what?\u201d She stuffed the basketball into Han Zhan\u2019s arms and asked him, \u201cAre you going to take the bait or ignore me?\u201d\n Han Zhan grabbed her waist and pulled Song Ci into his arms. Han Zhan suddenly carried Song Ci up horizontally and brought her upstairs with vigorous and hurried steps. The next morning, Song Ci woke up early in the morning and Han Zhan had already put on a nightdress for her. She lifted the blanket and went to the French window to see Han Zhan. He was wearing an old camouflage suit and was conducting a 400m obstacle course at the school grounds.\n This was the first time Song Ci saw Han Zhan in a camouflage uniform. The color of the uniform was slightly pale.\n Song Ci tidied herself up and went downstairs. Seeing that his grandfather was weeding in the vegetable garden, she walked over to the side of the garden and asked Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, are there any photos of Brother Han when he was in the military?\u201d\n Han Aoyu said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll get your Uncle Zhong to get it.\u201d Han Aoyu called Zhong Buhui over and gave a few instructions. Zhong Buhui entered the house and not long after, came out holding a photo album.\n \u201cSong Ci, there are photos of Zhanzhan in the military inside here.\u201d He handed the photo album to Song Ci.\n Song Ci took the photo album. \u201cThank you, Uncle Zhong.\u201d She carried the photo album and sat down on a wooden swing by the garden. She opened the photo album on her lap and started to flip through the first photo.\n This should be the family photo album of the Han Family. Not only was there a photo of Old Master Han Aoyu when he was younger, there was also a photo of Grandma Han. Song Ci had only seen Grandma Han\u2019s funeral photo before. Song Ci was stunned, when she saw the young grandmother in the photo.\n In the photo, his grandmother was in her twenties and wearing a green army uniform hat that was popular in the 1960s. She had shoulder-length hair and wore no makeup. Her eyes and teeth were exceptionally sharp.\n In that era, such looks were truly beautiful.\n Flipping back, she saw that grandma looked to be in her forties. It was in the late 1980s. Grandma was wearing a pure white collared blouse paired with a bright red A-line dress. Her hair was done up in a very western style with curly black hair. She had put on lipstick in the shape of a brow, making her look elegant and alluring.\n It could be seen that at this point in time, society was gradually becoming more open. Grandma had also become more fashionable and learned how to put on makeup.\n Further back was a photo of Han Aoyu when he was middle-aged. Due to the fact that he had joined the military, Han Aoyu had a righteous air about him and a pair of sharp eyes. One look and Song Ci could tell that he wasn\u2019t someone to be trifled with. After seeing his grandmother and grandfather in the photo, Song Ci felt that her grandfather was really lucky to have such a beautiful wife.\n After flipping through a few more pages, Song Ci finally saw her mother-in-law, Han Mulan. Han Mulan had been fair and chubby when she was young. Her face was flushed red as she sat on a bamboo chair, smiling so widely that her white teeth were exposed. She was very adorable.\n The last few photos were all of Han Mulan\u2019s childhood.\n Song Ci flipped the pages again. A beautiful face suddenly entered her line of sight. At first glance, Song Ci thought she saw her own mother. But when she focused and looked again, she realized that this woman didn\u2019t look like her mother at all. It was just that the expression on her face and the charm in her smile were very similar.\n This should be how Han Zhan\u2019s mother would look like when she was an adult.\n At this moment, Han Zhan walked over. He was sweating profusely and took off his camouflage jacket and vest. Seeing that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt, Song Ci teased him. \u201cBrother Han is being a hooligan again.\u201d\n Han Zhan casually received a clean towel from Uncle Zhong and wiped his sweaty hair and neck. He walked up to Song Ci and looked down to see her sizing up her mother\u2019s photo.\n A dark glint flashed across Han Zhan\u2019s eyes. He bent over, snatched the photo album from Song Ci\u2019s hands, and asked her with a smile, \u201cWhat are you looking at that\u2019s so captivating?\u201d\n Song Ci snatched the photo album back and placed it on her lap. \u201cLooking at your mother\u2019s photo.\u201d Song Ci pointed at the photo of her mother-in-law, Han Mulan, when she was younger. She teased Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, you don\u2019t look like your mother-in-law at all.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at his mother carefully and nodded. \u201cMmm, I don\u2019t look like her.\u201d I look like my father.\n ]Song Ci added, \u201cOn closer look, mother-in-law looks somewhat like me.\u201d Song Ci stroked her own cheek in satisfaction, tilted her head, and asked Han Zhan, \u201cDoes this count as our mother-in-law and daughter-in-law\u2019s face?\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s face for a while before saying, \u201cMmm, yes.\u201d\n Gazing at Han Mulan\u2019s face, Song Ci suddenly sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that your mother and my mother died too early. If they were still alive, they would have become good sisters.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Some people will believe that they are sisters.\u201d\n A question rolled out of Han Zhan\u2019s throat. \u201cDo they look alike?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, you haven\u2019t seen my mother when she was still alive. If you have, you will know how similar they look when they smile.\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t stare at her mother-in-law\u2019s photo for too long. She continued to flip through the photos, hoping to find the way Han Zhan looked in his military uniform.\n Han Zhan stood behind the swing and stared at the blooming rose in front of Song Ci in a daze.\n Song Ci\u2019s exclamation drew Han Zhan\u2019s attention back.\n \u201cBrother Han, you look so handsome in military uniform!\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan looked down and saw a photo of him when he was young. It was a photo of Han Zhan and Han Aoyu together. Han Zhan was wearing a military uniform and standing side by side with his grandfather in front of the military gates. They stood tall and straight like two large cypress trees.\n Han Zhan had seen and also worn many luxury haute couture outfits before, but what he loved the most in his life was that military uniform.\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cThis is a photo I took when Grandpa went to visit me at the army after I finished my recruit training.\u201d\n Song Ci touched Han Zhan\u2019s face in the photo and smiled. \u201cYou were so young then.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t indirectly mock me for being old. Regardless of how old I am, I am more than enough to satisfy you.\u201d Han Zhan lifted his long legs, flipped over the swing, and sat beside Song Ci.\n Song Ci pretended not to understand his dirty talk.\n She flipped to Han Zhan\u2019s graduation photo from high school.\n At this point, Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were still sharp and he didn\u2019t know how to control his gaze. Wearing a black t-shirt and having short hair, his deep features and those gray-blue eyes made him look like a sharp sword.\n Han Zhan glanced at the photo and saw a rope around his neck.\n Song Ci was about to observe Han Zhan\u2019s youthfulness, when Han Zhan suddenly stretched out his long arm and quickly took the photo album from Song Ci\u2019s hand. He closed the photo album and stood up. \u201cGo have breakfast. We are going up the mountain to pay respects to grandma later.\u201d\n Song Ci had yet to finish seeing the album and was feeling slightly disappointed. She wanted to flirt with Brother Han, so that she could finish reading the album, but hearing his words, she immediately gave up. She nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u201d\n As they walked into the dining room, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cTell me if there\u2019s anything I need to pay attention to when paying respects to the deceased.\u201d\n Han Zhan told Song Ci what to take note of.\n After breakfast, Zhong Buhui accompanied Han Aoyu to prepare the offerings, while Han Zhan went upstairs to change clothes. Meanwhile, Song Ci walked up to the television, opened the television cabinet, and retrieved the photo album that Han Zhan had stuffed in earlier.\n She turned back to look upstairs and felt that Han Zhan probably wouldn\u2019t come downstairs for the time being. Only then did she carry the photo album and sit down on the redwood sofa.\n Song Ci placed the photo album on her lap and hesitated for a long while before opening it.\n There\u2019s definitely something fishy about Brother Han suddenly taking away the photo album. Song Ci guessed that there must be a secret hidden in this photo album that Han Zhan didn\u2019t dare to let her know. Could it be a photo of him and Du Xueyan?\n Thinking of this, Song Ci flipped to the last few pages.\n Song Ci flipped to the photo of Han Zhan\u2019s class when he graduated. Han Zhan stood in the last row but she could not find Du Xueyan. It looked like Du Xueyan was in a different class from him.\n Song Ci continued browsing.\n Behind that class photo was a photo of Han Zhan and his brothers. From the start to the end, there was no sign of Du Xueyan at all. Song Ci couldn\u2019t help wondering if Han Zhan had taken out Du Xueyan\u2019s photo after they broke up because he detested her.\n Zhong Buhui walked over with the offerings. Seeing that Song Ci was still flipping through the photo album, he thought to himself: That was close! Luckily, I was meticulous and took out the photo of Zhan Zhan and Du Xueyan in advance.\n Actually, after Han Zhan stuffed these photos into the album that year, he didn\u2019t flip through them again. Perhaps he had already forgotten that there were still photos of him and Du Xueyan in the album. Otherwise, the moment he discovered that Song Ci was flipping through the album, he would have forcefully taken it away.\n He didn\u2019t look at them, but Zhong Buhui and Old Master Han would flip through them a few times a year, so he naturally remembered them. As Du Xueyan was Han Zhan\u2019s first girlfriend after all, even if Old Master wanted to throw away the photos of Du Xueyan and Han Zhan, he had to respect Han Zhan\u2019s opinion, so he didn\u2019t take it out.\n Previously, when he heard Song Ci say that she wanted to look at the photo album, Zhong Buhui was cautious and took out those two photos in advance.\n Seeing that Song Ci had reopened the photo album, Zhong Buhui secretly rejoiced at his quick wit.\n Song Ci flipped to the back and saw two photos of Han Zhan when he was 8 or 9 years old. At that time, Han Zhan was tall and strong with a round tummy and looked rather simple and honest.\n Song Ci hurriedly whipped out her cell phone and took a photo of Han Zhan.\n Finally, she flipped to the last page.\n In the last photo, Han Zhan, who was about 15 years old, was wearing only a pair of swimming trunks and standing beside a pond deep in the mountains. At this point, Han Zhan had already lost weight and his skeletal frame showed a slender, youthful frame.\n After taking a few more glances, Song Ci closed the album. She stood up with the album in her hands and was about to put it back.\n After taking two steps, Song Ci\u2019s eyes widened slightly. She stopped in her tracks and eagerly opened the photo album again. Her gaze landed on the last photo.\n In the photo, there was a black rope pendant hung around the youth\u2019s neck. On the pendant was a peace charm with high-grade flowers. On both sides of the buckle were several pure gold beads.\n This necklace was very familiar to Song Ci. It was lying in her wooden box and she had kept it for many years as a precious treasure!\n Song Ci stared fixedly at the necklace with tears shimmering in her beautiful eyes.\n At this point, Han Zhan\u2019s footsteps could be heard coming down the stairs.\n Song Ci hurriedly stuffed the photo album back into the television cabinet. She stood up and quickly turned back to see Han Zhan walking down from the corner platform on the second floor. Han Zhan was dressed entirely in black\u2014a black suit, a black shirt, black leather gloves, and black leather shoes. This made him look somewhat cold and stern.\n Han Zhan saw that there were tears in Song Ci\u2019s eyes and frowned. \u201cBaby Ci, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Han Zhan hurried over to Song Ci, lifted her face, and scrutinized it.\n Song Ci secretly pinched her own thigh. The pain helped her to maintain her composure. She smiled until her eyes were slightly red. She replied in a choked voice, \u201cI\u2019m fine. My toes kicked the TV cabinet just now. They hurt.\u201d\n Song Ci was wearing flat shoes with very soft leather. It was very easy to get injured if she accidentally kicked something.\n Han Zhan believed her. He looked down at Song Ci\u2019s shoes and saw that the leather was too soft. He said, \u201cWait!\u201d Han Zhan quickly went upstairs and came down with Song Ci\u2019s sports shoes in no time.\n \u201cWear this. We still need to climb the stone stairs up the mountain later. Don\u2019t kick it again.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci bent over to change shoes. Han Zhan turned and walked towards the kitchen. Only then did Song Ci dare to wipe her tears with her sleeves.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "153": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-154\n\n Chapter 153: I will Knit Sweaters for Brother Han for the Rest of His Life  Arriving at the kitchen, Han Zhan saw his grandfather staring at the sink in a daze. He asked in a low voice, \u201cGrandpa, are you coming with us?\u201d After his grandmother passed away, his grandfather only went to visit his grandmother\u2019s grave once and never went there again.\n Han Aoyu waved his hand and said, \u201cI won\u2019t be going. You go with that Song Lass.\u201d Seeing that cold graveyard, Han Aoyu didn\u2019t feel good. He was old and couldn\u2019t stand the thrill.\n \u201cAlright, I will go with Song Ci.\u201d\n Han Zhan walked over and patted his grandfather\u2019s back. He squeezed it tightly before leaving.\n The hill that Han Zhan\u2019s family lived on was all Han Aoyu\u2019s territory. His grandmother had not been cremated after her death and was buried directly at the top of the hill. There was a parking lot at the waist of the hill and all the cars were parked neatly.\n Everyone alighted and climbed up over a hundred stone stairs, before finally reaching his grandmother, Lin Duanfang\u2019s grave.\n This was a proper grave. On the right was Grandma\u2019s tombstone, and on the left was an empty plot of land. It was reserved for Han Aoyu\u2019s grave. The tombstone was very well-preserved and the pure black surface of the tombstone was carved with golden words.\n On the top right side of the tombstone was a photo of her grandmother in her old age. In the photo, her grandmother was wearing a light grey knitted cardigan with a blue floral skirt. She was wearing reading glasses and gazing quietly into the camera with grace and calmness.\n Zhong Buhui placed the square table in front of the tombstone. Han Zhan placed the dishes that Han Aoyu personally made on the table. The table was filled with dishes that his grandmother loved to eat when she was alive.\n \u201cGrandma, I am Zhanzhan.\u201d Han Zhan took a deep breath and placed a durian on the table. \u201cGrandpa asked me to bring you a durian. This year\u2019s durians are especially expensive. Grandpa laughed at you for being a gold digger and even causing his wallet to fly away even after you left.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci, Zhong Buhui, and the rest all smiled.\n Han Zhan lit three sticks of incense, walked up to the tombstone, knelt down, kowtowed, and placed the incense into the incense burner. Gazing at his grandmother\u2019s photo, Han Zhan told her, \u201cGrandma, I am married and brought my wife back today. Take a look at her.\u201d\n Turning back to look at Song Ci standing obediently behind him with her head slightly lowered, Han Zhan\u2019s heart melted. \u201cHer name is Song Ci. She is very beautiful and very capable. She knows how to knit, cook, and fly planes. She is the same as you\u2014 you both love durians.\u201d\n \u201cLike Grandpa, I also found myself a Gold-Devouring Beast.\u201d After a pause, Han Zhan said with a smile, \u201cGrandma, if you are alive in heaven, please bless Zhanzhan and Song Ci to be together forever.\u201d\n Song Ci stood aside and blushed at his words.\n Han Zhan gave three sticks of incense to Song Ci. \u201cBaby Ci, offer some incense to Grandma.\u201d\n Song Ci knelt down beside Han Zhan and lit the incense. Holding the three joss sticks, Song Ci looked at her grandmother, who had aged elegantly in the photo, and then looked up at Han Zhan\u2019s determined, handsome face beside her. Some distant memories surfaced in Song Ci\u2019s mind...\n Eight years ago, when the earthquake happened and Song Ci was thrown into the washroom by Song Fei, the house collapsed. Due to the great bearing power of the washroom, only a corner collapsed. Song Ci hid in the innermost corner. Her lower back was hit but her injuries were not serious.\n Song Ci was trapped under the rubble, unable to see the light, unable to eat or drink. After an indeterminate period of time, a ray of light finally shone in. She opened her heavy eyelids and slowly turned back. She could vaguely make out that it was a young soldier wearing camouflage clothing.\n His face was covered in dust, even his brows.\n Seeing that Song Ci had opened her eyes and was still alive, a gratified smile finally broke out on the man\u2019s taut, gray face. After seeing so many corpses, finally seeing a living person was a ray of hope.\n \u201cYoung lady, don\u2019t be afraid. I will save you now. You will be safe soon!\u201d He moved the concrete slab that was placed on her waist. He had just hugged her shoulders when the ground started to shake again.\n Instantly, the entire building collapsed and screams could be heard everywhere. As the building collapsed, that man stood behind her back and blocked her!\n My life was given to me by Han Zhan...\n Song Ci\u2019s vision blurred again.\n She raised the three joss sticks and gave her grandmother a deep kowtow, her forehead making dull thuds on the ground. Hearing this sound, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help but remind Song Ci. \u201cBaby Ci, don\u2019t use so much strength.\u201d\n Song Ci straightened her back and knocked down hard.\n Han Zhan frowned and thought for a moment but didn\u2019t stop her. After that, Song Ci said to Grandma, \u201cGrandma, don\u2019t worry. I, Song Ci, will dote on Han Zhan forever. In future, I will knit sweaters for Brother Han for the rest of his life.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart warmed at her words.\n On the way back, Song Ci pulled Han Zhan, who was about to board the car, and said, \u201cBrother Han, walk with me for a while. Anyway, it\u2019s not far and it\u2019s quite good to walk.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at her feet with concern in his eyes. \u201cYour toes don\u2019t hurt anymore?\u201d\n \u201cThey don\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d\n Han Zhan called out to Fang Shen. \u201cUncle Fang, drive my car down the hill. We\u2019ll walk for a while.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After all the vehicles had left, Song Ci and Han Zhan held hands as they headed down the hill along the asphalt road. Han Zhan grew up on this hill and was very familiar with all the vegetation on it.\n Walking to the turn of the road, Han Zhan pulled Song Ci to a thick tree. \u201cThis osmanthus tree is so big. I smelled osmanthus just now at the top of the hill.\u201d Song Ci opened her arms and tried to hug the tree, but she couldn\u2019t.\n Han Zhan walked up to her, opened his long arms, and touched Song Ci\u2019s fingertips. Together, they hugged the thick trunk of the osmanthus tree. Song Ci looked up at this towering tree. She said, \u201cIt must be even older than you and me combined.\u201d\n Han Zhan retracted his hand and walked over to Song Ci\u2019s side. He said, \u201cThis osmanthus tree is already 200 years old. When I was young, I often climbed up the tree to find eggs.\u201d\n Covering his eyes with his hands to block the strong sunlight, Han Zhan looked up at the top of the tree, narrowed his eyes to search for a few seconds, and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bird\u2019s nest there. I\u2019ll go and see if there are any bird eggs.\u201d\n Han Zhan took off his jacket and handed it to Song Ci. He rolled up his pants and gracefully climbed up the tree. Worried that he would fall down, Song Ci hurriedly advised him. \u201cBrother Han, step steadily. Don\u2019t step on the weak branches.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n Han Zhan was a tree-climbing expert and his movements were very steady.\n Song Ci observed his actions and complained. \u201cBrother Han, you look like a monkey climbing a tree.\u201d\n Han Zhan nearly missed a step.\n He roared. \u201cShut up!\u201d\n Song Ci quickly shut her mouth.\n Han Zhan squatted on a branch and looked into the nest. He saw three white eggs and said to Song Ci, \u201cThere are three eggs!\u201d\n Song Ci was overjoyed. \u201cTake them down!\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan wrapped his left arm around a tree branch above his head, stretched out his right hand towards the bird\u2019s nest, and easily retrieved three eggs. He put the eggs into his pants pocket and searched for other bird\u2019s nests, but couldn\u2019t find any.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no more here.\u201d\n Song Ci waved at Han Zhan. \u201cCome down then.\u201d\n Only then did Han Zhan come down from the tree. After landing, he handed the eggs to Song Ci as if presenting a treasure and said, \u201cThe eggs are all yours.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "154": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-155\n\n Chapter 154: Song Ci, You are Insulting a Soldier  Holding the three eggs, Song Ci smiled. \u201cDo I need to hatch them?\u201d\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cAre you willing?\u201d\n Song Ci looked at Han Zhan meaningfully and said, \u201cOf course I am willing. It depends on whether you are willing.\u201d She was no longer referring to hatching eggs but giving birth.\n Han Zhan hid the smile in his eyes and gave Song Ci a meaningful look before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s wait until the matter with the Mu Family is settled, before preparing for pregnancy.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t reply. She kept the eggs in her hands and walked along the white line of the asphalt road. There was a ditch at the edge and Han Zhan was worried that Song Ci would fall. He couldn\u2019t help but remind her. \u201cBe careful and don\u2019t fall.\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly stopped.\n Han Zhan stopped as well. He looked down at Song Ci and remained silent.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t turn back. She looked down at her toes and suddenly asked softly, \u201cBrother Han, do you regret it?\u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n Only then did Song Ci turn around. She held the egg in her left hand, grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm with her right, looked up at him, and said, \u201cYou told me that your hand was broken to save someone. All these years, thinking of those two lost fingers, as well as your dream that you could never achieve, do you regret saving that person back then?\u201d\n Han Zhan remained silent.\n Song Ci bit her red lower lip and waited for it to turn pale before saying, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t save that person, you wouldn\u2019t have lost your fingers. That person ruined your dreams.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression darkened.\n He looked at Song Ci disapprovingly with a solemn expression. \u201cSong Ci, you are insulting a soldier.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked and didn\u2019t dare to look straight at Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan continued. \u201cIn ancient times, there was a long line of defense against the foreign tribes. Today, there is a military soul protecting China. It is a soldier\u2019s duty to obey orders. It is a soldier\u2019s belief to protect our country. Even if I were to retire from the army, the military soul will never be extinguished. It will forever be carved into every single bone of mine. If you ask me if I regret...\u201d\n His scorching eyes stared at Song Ci\u2019s slightly trembling pupils. Han Zhan\u2019s sonorous voice carried an inviolable holiness. \u201cYou are insulting my character.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s body went limp.\n She hurriedly hugged Han Zhan\u2019s waist with one hand and buried her face in his chest. Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s slightly agitated heartbeat, Song Ci\u2019s heart ached slightly. \u201cBut Brother Han, my heart aches for you...\u201d\n When Song Ci was rescued that year, she had inquired about the whereabouts of that soldier from the People\u2019s Liberation Army. But the scene of the rescue was chaotic and everyone was busy saving people. Who would notice an ordinary soldier?\n Song Ci thought of how she would sometimes joke about Han Zhan\u2019s broken right hand after their marriage and felt like slapping herself! In order to save her, he had lost two fingers and she still dared to laugh at his incomplete hand!\n Song Ci, you are inhuman!\n \u201cHan Zhan, Han Zhan, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d I\u2019ve implicated you...\n Song Ci hugged Han Zhan tightly as tears streamed down her face.\n Seeing Song Ci cry, Han Zhan thought that his harsh words and fierce expression scared her. He sighed, placed his hand on Song Ci\u2019s back, and gently stroked it.\n \u201cBaby Ci, it\u2019s not a loss to exchange two fingers for a healthy person.\u201d He kissed Song Ci\u2019s hair and said, \u201cYou can feel sorry for me, but don\u2019t cry for me. I feel terrible seeing this.\u201d\n Song Ci wanted to stop her tears but she couldn\u2019t.\n After a long while, she straightened her back in embarrassment. Wiping her face with the back of her hand, she smiled through her tears and said jokingly, \u201cLuckily I didn\u2019t put on makeup this morning. Otherwise, I\u2019d definitely look terrible crying now.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at her tear-streaked face and asked thoughtfully, \u201cWhy are you suddenly thinking of these things?\u201d\n Due to all sorts of considerations, Song Ci wasn\u2019t willing to tell Han Zhan the truth. She raised an egg and said, \u201cSeeing you climb a tree and imagining your previous carefree manner, I felt sorry for your previous encounter.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ve already endured through the toughest times. There\u2019s nothing bad about my life now.\u201d Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s right hand and brought her down the mountain.\n After returning home, Song Ci had wanted to steam the egg but Han Aoyu said, \u201cThe weather is cool now. Let\u2019s have a barbeque tonight.\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her hands and said, \u201cThen we\u2019ll roast the eggs!\u201d\n Han Aoyu glanced at Han Zhan and said, \u201cBarbecue should be accompanied by beer!\u201d\n \u201cYes! Grandpa, do you like beer? Do you have it at home? If not, I\u2019ll go buy it!\u201d Song Ci had not had barbeque in a long time and was already drooling.\n Han Aoyu chuckled. \u201cWhy not? When I was young, I loved to drink cold beer. It was cheap and refreshing!\u201d\n Han Zhan splashed cold water on her face. \u201cWhat do you want to drink? You are not allowed to drink alcohol with high blood pressure.\u201d After a pause, Han Zhan was merciful and stared at Han Aoyu. \u201cBut you can have a glass of fruit juice.\u201d\n Han Aoyu fumed. \u201cWhere did this little bastard come from? He has no conscience at all!\u201d\n Han Zhan remained expressionless. \u201cNo drinking.\u201d\n Han Aoyu saw that Han Zhan didn\u2019t give him any face and couldn\u2019t help bickering with him. Song Ci stifled a smile as she watched the grandfather and grandson bicker. She felt that this scene was exceptionally heartwarming.\n At night, Han Zhan really set up a barbeque rack in the courtyard. The few of them were carnivores and all the ingredients they prepared were basically meat. Considering Song Ci\u2019s image as an idol, Han Zhan also prepared some vegetables.\n \u201cChives?\u201d Han Zhan held a metal skewer and placed a plate of sliced chives in front of her. He planned to make them into barbecue skewers.\n Song Ci said, \u201cYeah, just put it on a plate. When they are cooked later, put an egg in it. That will be delicious.\u201d\n \u201cAlright.\u201d Han Zhan threw down the metal skewer and went to the refrigerator to take out the meat-filled basket. Song Ci followed Han Zhan and asked from behind him, \u201cBrother Han, can I roast durian?\u201d\n Han Zhan, who was not wearing a gas mask, was silent for a moment before rejecting. \u201cGrandpa doesn\u2019t like durians. I get dizzy just from smelling them.\u201d It was definitely not wrong to make Grandpa the scapegoat for something.\n As expected, Song Ci immediately dismissed the idea after hearing that his grandfather didn\u2019t like durians.\n As Han Zhan was cold and heartless, Han Aoyu had only eaten a skewer of roasted mutton and beef that night. After drinking half a glass of watermelon juice, he got up to go for a walk to digest his food and was prepared to go to bed on time.\n Song Ci was focused on eating the beef kebabs that Han Zhan had made for her. Her cell phone rang for a long time before she noticed it.\n After a long while, Song Ci finally heard her cell phone ring.\n Song Ci took out her cell phone and saw that it was Song Fei calling. She hurriedly walked into the quiet garden with the kebabs and sat down on a wooden chair. Only then did Song Ci pick up the call. \u201cSong Fei.\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci chewing on her food, Song Fei asked her, \u201cWhat are you eating?\u201d\n \u201cDo you want some beef kebabs?\u201d\n Song Fei had been eating lightly recently. Her taste buds twitched at the mention of beef kebabs. \u201cI want to.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a pity you can\u2019t have it.\u201d Song Ci purposely teased Song Fei. \u201cMy Brother Han\u2019s beef kebabs are very tasty. I\u2019ll treat you another day.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe next year,\u201d Song Fei said.\n Hearing this reply, Song Ci was stunned. \u201cWhy do we have to wait until next year?\u201d Her voice subconsciously became strained.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "155": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-156\n\n Chapter 155: Steamed Buns with Chili Filling  Song Fei was silent for a moment before calling out Song Ci\u2019s name. \u201cSong Ci.\u201d\n Song Ci suppressed the uneasiness in her heart and said, \u201cSong Fei, don\u2019t call my name. Once you call my name, something major will definitely happen.\u201d The words Song Ci from Song Fei\u2019s mouth had already become a curse.\n Song Fei was silent again. But moments later, she spoke again. \u201cSong Ci, I am going to Africa with my teacher for at least a year.\u201d\n Song Ci heard her, but didn\u2019t say anything. The beef in her mouth instantly lost its flavor.\n Song Fei gave Song Ci a few minutes to digest this information. Song Ci placed the skewer in front of her and stared at it. She said unhappily, \u201cI can\u2019t persuade you, right?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cSong Ci, see you next year.\u201d\n \u201cWhich country are you going to?\u201d Song Ci was slightly angry and her tone turned anxious.\n Song Fei said, \u201cCongo.\u201d\n Song Ci took a deep breath and scolded Song Fei. \u201cDo you know how chaotic it is over there?! Song Fei, your life will be in danger! I won\u2019t allow you to go!\u201d Song Ci would never allow Song Fei to go to such a dangerous place, even if one said that she was unreasonable or cowardly.\n Seeing that Song Ci had lost her temper, Song Fei sighed. \u201cSong Ci.\u201d Without hearing Song Ci\u2019s reply, Song Fei continued, \u201cTeacher said that with my talent and capabilities, I shouldn\u2019t waste it. Until now, the Ebola virus has yet to develop an effective antidote. Teacher hopes that I can go with him. I want to go too.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, just like how violin is your life\u2019s pursuit, being a person like a teacher is also my pursuit.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, you must support me.\u201d\n It was rare to hear so many words from Song Fei. Song Ci had already been convinced by her. Song Ci knew that she should support Song Fei in realizing her dream, but she was also worried that Song Fei would be in danger.\n In the end, Song Ci asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cHave you told Brother Jiang about this?\u201d\n Song Fei was silent.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know if Song Fei was feeling guilty or just silently admitting it.\n Song Ci suddenly sneered. She said mockingly, \u201cSong Fei, Yan Jiang is so unlucky to have fallen in love with you.\u201d\n Song Fei remained silent. Even if Song Ci didn\u2019t say another word, she didn\u2019t hang up. This was Song Fei. She looked cold and heartless, but she would never take the initiative to hang up on someone important to.\n Seeing Han Zhan walk over, Song Ci spoke again. \u201cSong Fei, remember, I don\u2019t want you to be dazzling. I just want you to be safe and sound.\u201d\n Song Fei smiled. \u201cLittle fool, a scourge will live for a thousand years. I must live a long life.\u201d\n Song Ci snorted and hung up.\n Han Zhan sat down beside Song Ci and handed two mutton sticks to her. \u201cSong Fei\u2019s call?\u201d He had already heard Song Ci call out Song Fei\u2019s name just now.\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Song Ci told Han Zhan, \u201cSong Fei is going to Congo to study the virus with her teacher.\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned and said, \u201cThat place is slightly chaotic. I\u2019ve been there before and was ordered to rescue a batch of trapped volunteers. The environment there is terrible and society is messy. It\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, Song Ci felt even more anxious. \u201cSong Fei is very stubborn. Even I can\u2019t persuade her on something that she has already decided on.\u201d Song Ci sighed and said in a low voice, \u201cI just want her to be safe and sound. It\u2019s better for her to be mediocre forever.\u201d\n \u201cBut Baby Ci, everyone has their own goals. Song Fei is more mature than you, and you know it very well. She must have thought it through carefully before deciding to go to Congo. Since she told you, she hopes to obtain your understanding and support.\u201d Because they were both ambitious, Han Zhan could understand Song Fei.\n Song Ci also understood this reasoning. It was just that she cared too much about Song Fei and couldn\u2019t bear to see her go to such dangerous places.\n \u201cI hope everything will be well.\u201d\n ...\n After talking to Song Ci, Song Fei didn\u2019t look relaxed at all. Holding her cell phone, she leaned back against the sofa and sat down on the carpet. Glancing at the time, it was only 20 minutes or so before Yan Jiang returned home. She actually felt slightly nervous.\n Yan Jiang arrived home on time and saw that the house was pitch black. Thinking that Song Fei had not returned, he turned on all the lights in the house, carried his bag, and crossed the living room to go upstairs. Only when he passed by the sofa did he realize that Song Fei was actually at home.\n Seeing that Song Fei had fallen asleep on the carpet, Yan Jiang hurried over and lifted her up.\n Song Fei opened her eyes the moment he hugged her. \u201cWhy are you hugging me?\u201d Song Fei laid in his arms, staring at Yan Jiang coldly.\n Yan Jiang looked helpless but his arms were still strong and firm. He explained sheepishly. \u201cYou fell asleep. I was going to send you back to your room.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cYou can wake me up.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to hug you then.\u201d\n He was too straightforward and Song Fei couldn\u2019t bring herself to say anything else.\n \u201cPut me down.\u201d\n Like an obedient baby, Yan Jiang hurriedly put her down.\n Song Fei laid limply on the sofa. Rubbing her tummy, she glanced at Yan Jiang, who was standing beside her and staring at her intently. Ever since she exposed his wolfish ambition, Yan Jiang had been staring at her with such a piercing gaze.\n Unable to bear Yan Jiang\u2019s stare, Song Fei suddenly said, \u201cCan you treat me to barbeque?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cNow?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Before leaving, Yan Jiang put on a baseball cap but didn\u2019t wear any shades. With those shades, he felt like the world had turned dark. With Song Fei around, Yan Jiang only wanted to see the light.\n Song Fei was still wearing her hoodie. She instinctively put it on when she left the house. After boarding the car, Song Fei asked Yan Jiang, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of being photographed by the reporters?\u201d Afraid of causing trouble for Yan Jiang, Song Fei had to wear a hoodie every time she went out.\n Yan Jiang answered very honestly, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for everyone in the world to know about our scandal.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Fei fell silent.\n She took a deep look at Yan Jiang and mocked him. \u201cYou are quite bold to tease me.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI thought that being in love with you was enough to prove my guts.\u201d\n Song Fei gazed pensively at Yan Jiang. She felt that he looked unfamiliar but not detestable. She caught Yan Jiang secretly observing her reaction as he drove. She pouted and warned him. \u201cDrive safe.\u201d\n Yan Jiang hurriedly sat up straight and stared straight ahead.\n Song Fei suddenly said, \u201cYou were so cowardly in the past. How did you end up like this?\u201d Although the current Yan Jiang also cowered in front of Song Fei sometimes, he was brave and calm most of the time.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cWithout your protection, I have to grow up on my own.\u201d If I\u2019m not brave, how am I going to protect Song Fei and our child in the future? Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dare to say this but only dared to think about it in his heart.\n Song Fei felt like she didn\u2019t understand Yan Jiang anymore.\n In the past, Yan Jiang was innocent, easy to understand, and easy to bully. Bullying him was also a form of entertainment in Song Fei\u2019s boring life. Now, Yan Jiang looked like a meat bun. Song Fei could pinch and flatten him, but his bun hid chili peppers.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "156": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-157\n\n Chapter 156: He is Serious about Chasing His Wife  Song Fei remained silent and so did Yan Jiang.\n Only when they stopped the car did Yan Jiang tell Song Fei. \u201cWe have arrived.\u201d\n Song Fei looked up and saw the barbeque shop. She removed the seatbelt, alighted the car and entered the shop with Yan Jiang. The barbeque shop looked very high-class and didn\u2019t have a lot of customers. However, the air was filled with a tempting fragrance.\n Yan Jiang asked for a private room and brought Song Fei into it.\n Song Fei and Yan Jiang sat opposite each other. Yan Jiang ordered Song Fei\u2019s favorite food. Song Fei heard him say the names of the dishes and said, \u201cYou have a similar taste to me.\u201d\n \u201cWe are having a meal together. Of course I will order your favorite dishes.\u201d Meeting Song Fei\u2019s emotionless eyes, Yan Jiang said frankly, \u201cAfter all, I am wooing you.\u201d\n Song Fei was caught off-guard by his confession and felt a rush of warmth. Luckily, she was wearing a hat and no one could see her expression.\n Yan Jiang took off his baseball cap and saw that Song Fei was still wearing it. He said, \u201cTake off your cap. The air-conditioning is turned on in the house. Won\u2019t it be hot wearing a cap? Moreover, this is a private room. No one will notice us.\u201d\n Song Fei took off her hat in a swift manner.\n Realizing that Song Fei\u2019s ears were slightly red, Yan Jiang took a few more glances. Under the light, Song Fei\u2019s ears were so thin that they were translucent and very adorable.\n Song Fei felt slightly uneasy. She looked down and pretended to drink some water. After finishing it, she realized that Yan Jiang was still staring at her with a perverted look in his eyes. She flew into a rage out of humiliation and scolded him. \u201cWhat are you looking at? It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t seen me before.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said sincerely, \u201cI will never get tired of looking at you.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Song Fei pulled a long face to cover up her shyness. \u201cWhy are you so flirty? Are you itching for a beating?\u201d Song Fei\u2019s eyes turned visibly cold.\n Yan Jiang hurriedly looked down and stared at the grill.\n Song Fei\u2019s stomach needed proper nourishment. She couldn\u2019t eat too much barbeque\u2014 she could only taste it. Yan Jiang grilled some of each ingredient for her. He waited until Song Fei was full before roasting it for himself.\n Song Fei poured herself a glass of lemon water. She held the glass and took a sip occasionally. Looking at Yan Jiang\u2019s long silver hair, Song Fei\u2019s lips parted slightly before she shut them again.\n It was very strange that some words were stuck at the tip of her tongue. This was something Song Fei had never experienced before.\n Yan Jiang was full. He glanced at Song Fei, who was deep in thought. \u201cDo you have something to tell me?\u201d In this world, Song Ci and Yan Jiang knew Song Fei the best.\n Song Fei asked in surprise, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cYou always like to touch something repeatedly when you are troubled.\u201d Song Fei had already touched her glass dozens of times.\n Song Fei also knew her own habits.\n She put down the glass. \u201cYan Jiang.\u201d\n Since waking up, this was the first time Song Fei addressed Yan Jiang by his full name. Yan Jiang subconsciously sat up straight and swallowed hard, before giving a grunt of acknowledgment.\n Song Fei looked elsewhere and said, \u201cThe day after tomorrow, I will be setting off for Congo to do research with my teacher.\u201d Song Fei didn\u2019t feel relieved when she finally told him about this. Instead, she felt even more nervous.\n She somewhat detested this uncontrollable side of herself.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s expression froze as his smile faded.\n \u201cHow long will you be gone for?\u201d He spoke calmly, as if he had already accepted this fact.\n Song Fei said, \u201cAt least a year.\u201d\n Yan Jiang thought for a moment and suddenly asked, \u201cCan you wait for another two days?\u201d\n Song Fei asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Yan Jiang smiled at her and said, \u201cI have a lot of things to settle here. I have signed several endorsement contracts previously and it will be troublesome to cancel them at the last minute. Give me three days to settle them.\u201d\n Song Fei understood his underlying meaning.\n \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Song Fei suspected that she had misunderstood him.\n Yan Jiang smiled even more radiantly and brightly. Song Fei was shocked by the glow.\n \u201cI will go with you.\u201d Yan Jiang picked up the glass of lemon water and finished it in one gulp. He put down the glass and his eyes gradually turned determined. He said, \u201cI am serious about wooing you. Congo is such a chaotic place. I am worried about letting you go alone.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this...\u201d Yan Jiang interrupted Song Fei just as she started talking.\n He said, \u201cSong Fei, you are smarter than me and your future is more promising. What you are doing is for the good of all mankind. I cannot stop you from doing it. If I cannot stop you from giving up your dreams and I can\u2019t see you in danger alone, I can only go with you. As for work...\u201d\n Yan Jiang shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a difference whether I\u2019m in the entertainment circle or not. But I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d As he spoke, the eyes of that man who always looked soft and easy to bully burned with passion.\n Song Fei was slightly stunned.\n At this moment, she suddenly felt a sense of danger.\n All along, she had thought that she could control Yan Jiang. But at this moment, she suddenly realized that she might have reversed her position. Yan Jiang was no longer that weak and timid little coward who didn\u2019t even dare to fight back when he was bullied.\n In the years that she had been in a coma, that weak youth from back then had already become as strong as a leopard. He was as gentle and adorable as a cat in his sleep, but his eyes were filled with murderous intent!\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t inform Song Ci about his decision to leave the industry and follow Song Fei to Congo. This morning, Song Ci and Han Zhan arrived at Shunchen Airport with their luggage, preparing to take a flight to Haicheng and transfer to Vienna.\n ]In the VIP waiting room of the airport, Song Ci had nothing else to do and opened her Weibo account. As usual, she entered the hottest topics on Weibo, but was shocked by the huge number of # Yan Jiang Retires from the entertainment circles, # Yan Jiang Retires #, # Yan Jiang Entertainment #, # The World is Large, We\u2019ll Meet Him Again # Shocked\n Song Ci hurriedly clicked on the trending topic and saw Yan Jiang\u2019s statement not long ago. The statement had already broken 400,000 saves.\n The influence of a top-tier influencer was truly terrifying.\n At first, Song Ci thought it was just another rumor. But when she saw that statement, she realized it was true.\n In the announcement, Yan Jiang wrote:\n Yan Jiang:\n Good morning, everyone.\n In autumn five years ago, I officially stepped into the entertainment circles and debuted as an actor. Some people said that Yan Jiang was at the peak of his career, and he will succeed and fail because of his face. I agreed with this statement because being too handsome is indeed a crime.\n As an actor, it is my regret that I don\u2019t have more outstanding works. After five years of wasted time, I realize that I am not suitable for the entertainment industry. After thinking it over, I decided to retreat from the industry.\n I know that me leaving the entertainment circles would have all the seniors and juniors, who have been crushed by my popularity all these years, scheering. Here, I want to apologize to all of you: I am sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have been born so handsome and so likable, but I have no choice. Face is something that comes naturally from the womb. You can\u2019t be envious.\n I also wanted to tell some big bosses who have been coveting me for so many years and wanting to be her sugar mommy: I am sorry, I have retired from the entertainment circles. The next time I see you, I will still beat you up so badly that your parents won\u2019t recognize you.\n Finally, I want to thank all the outstanding fans who have been through thick and thin with me all these years. I want to say one thing: The world is huge. We will meet again if we are fated!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "157": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-158\n\n Chapter 157: Blind or have Bad Taste?  This retirement statement was very Yan Jiang-style. It was arrogant, funny, and straightforward.\n After reading this long post, Song Ci felt very conflicted. She could guess why Yan Jiang suddenly announced his retirement from the industry.\n In order to confirm her suspicions, Song Ci gave Yan Jiang a call. Thanks to that retirement statement, Yan Jiang\u2019s phone had already been ringing non-stop this morning. Song Ci\u2019s phone call kept indicating that the other party\u2019s phone was busy.\n In the end, Song Ci had no choice but to call Song Fei.\n Only Song Ci, her husband and Yan Jiang knew Song Fei\u2019s phone number. The call went through immediately. Song Fei picked up the phone and guessed what Song Ci was calling to ask. For a moment, she didn\u2019t speak.\n Song Ci asked bluntly, \u201cSong Fei, did Yan Jiang quit the industry because of... you?\u201d At the end of her sentence, Song Ci sounded hesitant.\n But Song Fei admitted it. \u201cYes.\u201d\n Indeed!\n \u201cYou asked for it?\u201d Although Song Ci was asking Song Fei, she guessed that Yan Jiang was the one being stubborn. A proud woman like Song Fei would never do such a thing.\n Song Fei said, \u201cIt was his own decision. I didn\u2019t expect him to make such a choice.\u201d\n I knew it!\n Song Ci was slightly angry and her tone became agitated. \u201cIs there something wrong with his head? Congo is such a dangerous place, why does he want to go there? Song Fei, why didn\u2019t you persuade him?\u201d\n Song Fei leaned against the wall as Song Ci\u2019s scolding voice echoed in her ears. She gazed at Yan Jiang, who was busy talking on the phone in the courtyard. A lost expression appeared on her beautiful face.\n Song Fei suddenly interrupted Song Ci. \u201cTell me, why is he so stubborn?\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Song Ci could hear the helplessness and confusion in Song Fei\u2019s voice and didn\u2019t know what to say. After a moment of silence, Song Fei heard Song Ci sigh. \u201cSong Fei, he really loves you. If not for true love, he wouldn\u2019t have gone so far.\u201d\n Song Fei was even more puzzled. She was very confused. \u201cSong Ci, what\u2019s so good about me? What does he love about me?\u201d Since a young age, this was the first time Song Fei was wooed by someone. She felt that boys should like girls like her sister Song Ci who was both sweet and salty.\n A cold, unromantic, unfeeling, unruly, spoiled, and vicious woman like her shouldn\u2019t be liked at all.\n Is Yan Jiang blind or does he have bad taste?\n Song Ci allowed herself to belittle Song Fei, but she couldn\u2019t accept Song Fei belittling herself like this. Song Ci was unconvinced and retorted self-righteously. \u201cHow are you bad? You are beautiful and smart. You are also Fu Hanshen\u2019s only disciple. You are intelligent, wise, and calm. You are glowing all over. Isn\u2019t it normal for someone to like you?\u201d\n It was the first time Song Ci praised Song Fei like this and goosebumps rose all over her body. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t spout nonsense.\u201d\n Song Ci knew when to stop.\n It was Song Ci\u2019s first time praising her elder sister in such a manner and she felt slightly awkward. She said, \u201cOf course, you\u2019re just slightly less beautiful than me...\u201d\n Song Fei didn\u2019t say a word.\n ]\u201dI won\u2019t talk to you for now. I will call Brother Jiang again.\u201d Song Ci hung up Song Fei\u2019s call and called Yan Jiang again. After three consecutive calls, the call finally connected.\n Yan Jiang had already received more than a dozen calls this morning and his mouth was already parched. He took a sip of tea brewed, accepted the call, and without waiting for Song Ci to speak, he sighed helplessly. \u201cI knew I would receive your call. The news is right, Song Song. I\u2019ve decided to retire from the entertainment circles and stop acting.\u201d\n Song Ci was silent.\n Yan Jiang thought she was angry and tried to please her. \u201cAre you angry? Are you angry that I didn\u2019t inform you in advance? I have been so busy settling the compensation for the contracts that I forgot about it. You are a magnanimous person, please understand me.\u201d\n Song Ci interrupted Yan Jiang\u2019s attempt to please her. \u201cAre you going to Congo with my elder sister?\u201d\n It was Yan Jiang\u2019s turn to remain silent.\n Song Ci sharply questioned him again and again. \u201cThat place is so dangerous. Can you protect yourself? You can\u2019t even protect yourself, yet you still want to protect Song Fei? Ah Jiang, think carefully.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was unconvinced. \u201cI am quite skilled and have practiced Taekwondo for several years.\u201d\n \u201cBut they have guns.\u201d What\u2019s the use of taekwondo in a chaotic place?\n \u201cIt\u2019s precisely because of this, so I want to go even more.\u201d Yan Jiang sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t let her go to that kind of place alone. I won\u2019t be at ease if I don\u2019t accompany her. Moreover, you know your elder sister very well. If I want to pursue her, a few roses won\u2019t be enough to move her.\u201d\n Gritting her teeth, Song Ci replied, \u201cSilly!\u201d She scolded Yan Jiang for being silly, but deep down, she approved of him. For a famous celebrity to quit acting just because of her elder sister, this courage was worthy of Song Ci\u2019s respect.\n ]\u201dWe are setting off for the airport. Let\u2019s not chat for now.\u201d Yan Jiang hung up the phone and waved at Song Fei who was sitting on the windowsill on the second floor. \u201cSong Fei, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n Song Fei came down very quickly. There were two suitcases by the door and she took the one that belonged to her.\n Song Fei stopped in front of Yan Jiang.\n Placing her hand on the luggage, Song Fei pursed her lips tightly as she glanced at Yan Jiang\u2019s short hair. The buzz cut accentuated Yan Jiang\u2019s exquisite and perfect face, making him appear even more stern and ruthless.\n But Song Fei felt that Yan Jiang still looked better in gorgeous outfits with long hair.\n He was born to live under the spotlight.\n \u201cYan Jiang, you can stay. I don\u2019t need your company.\u201d Song Fei\u2019s face was cold and her tone was stiff.\n Yan Jiang was momentarily stunned by Song Fei\u2019s words, but recovered very quickly. He took off the silver chain around his neck, opened the photo box hung on the chain, placed it on his palm, and handed it to Song Fei.\n Song Fei looked down and saw that it was her 14-year-old self.\n Staring at that photo, Song Fei\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n ]Yan Jiang smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t order me to stay. Song Fei, I have waited for too long in the same spot. I have waited long enough.\u201d For the past eight years, Yan Jiang had been frustrated and regretful. He regretted being so timid and fearful back then, not daring to express his feelings to Song Fei. \u201cThis time, I will accompany you wherever you go. Song Fei, I will never let you go to such a dangerous place alone again.\u201d\n Yan Jiang took out a platinum ring from his shirt pocket and put it on the silver chain. He put the necklace back on and patted the ring and photo box. He smiled at Song Fei. \u201cOne day, you will be willing to put this on for me.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was determined to win over Song Fei!\n After a while, Song Fei scolded. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d\n She pulled her luggage and left, her face slightly hot.\n \u201cWait for me!\u201d Yan Jiang hurriedly pulled his own luggage and chased after Song Fei.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "158": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-159\n\n Chapter 158: Han Zhan: My Wife is the Most Beautiful  Arriving at the airport, Yan Jiang greeted Fu Hanshen\u2019s team. Noticing that there was a man he knew in the same team, a suspicion flashed across his mind. \u201cMr. Long, why are you also here?\u201d The Mr. Long that Yan Jiang spoke of was none other than Long Yu.\n There were three men and a woman behind Long Yu. They were all in their thirties or forties and looked very ordinary. Long Yu smiled at Yan Jiang and explained. \u201cMadam is worried about Miss Song Fei and sent us along to protect her team.\u201d\n Yan Jiang gave Long Yu a meaningful look.\n Although Long Yu was Song Ci\u2019s bodyguard, he only obeyed Han Zhan. Only Han Zhan could mobilize them. Long Yu obviously didn\u2019t tell the truth just now. Knowing that Congo was in a mess did Han Zhan worry about Song Fei\u2019s safety, so he specifically sent Long Yu and the rest to Congo?\n Yan Jiang felt that there was something slightly off about this incident.\n At the same time, on the flight from Shunchen City to Haicheng, Han Zhan suddenly said to Song Ci, \u201cBrother Long has some matters to attend to at home. When we get back from our honeymoon, I will send you a new driver.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened to his family?\u201d\n \u201cHis grandfather is dying, so he needs to spend the elderly\u2019s last moments with him.\u201d Han Zhan silently apologized to Long Yu\u2019s grandfather who had passed away two years ago.\n \u201cThen he should go back and accompany his grandfather. I am fine. As long as it\u2019s someone you arrange by my side, I will be assured.\u201d Han Zhan would never send a weak driver to protect her.\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d It would take about two hours from Shunchen to Hai Cheng. Song Ci said, \u201cBrother Han, you do your own thing. I want to watch a movie.\u201d She found a Polish movie called 365dni and started watching it.\n Han Zhan retrieved a book from his luggage and placed it on the table. Song Ci glanced at the book cover and saw three words written with a brush:\n Virtue Scripture.\n Song Ci\u2019s expression changed slightly. She looked at Han Zhan\u2019s book and then looked at her own passionate movie. She suddenly felt that even Brother Han\u2019s soul had become sacred and interesting.\n Noticing Song Ci\u2019s gaze, Han Zhan smiled and asked her, \u201cWhat are you thinking about now?\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cHave you been studying philosophy recently?\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded. \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you studying this?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cActing cool.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned. She cupped her fists and praised Han Zhan. \u201cMr. Han is such a wonderful person.\u201d\n \u201cWatch your movie.\u201d Han Zhan opened the book to the bookmark page, looked down, and concentrated on reading.\n Only then did Song Ci put on her earphones and started the movie.\n Unknowingly, an hour had already passed. Han Zhan had been reading with his head lowered and his neck felt rather tired. He reached out to pinch the back of his neck, looked up, and shook his head.\n When he shook his head and saw the screen in front of Song Ci, his expression instantly changed to one of shock.\n Song Ci was actually watching one of the 18 forbidden erotic films on the plane!\n Seeing Han Zhan staring at the movie in front of her with a strange expression, Song Ci took off her earphones and asked considerately, \u201cBrother Han, do you want to watch it? I\u2019ll give you my earphones?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head with a complicated expression. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to watch it.\u201d It was not suitable to watch this on the plane.\n At this moment, a stewardess walked over with a tray. Han Zhan hurriedly covered the screen with a blanket, afraid of being discovered by the stewardess. After the stewardess left, Song Ci took off the towel and teased him. \u201cAre you so innocent, Brother Han?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression was serious. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to watch such a big-scale movie in public.\u201d\n \u201cIf I block it, others won\u2019t be able to see.\u201d Song Ci took up Han Zhan\u2019s book and blocked her screen.\n Han Zhan hurriedly snatched his book away and said, \u201cDon\u2019t ruin my Virtue Scripture.\u201d He even blew on the cover.\n Song Ci was amused by him and had no choice but to turn off the movie. After turning off the movie, Song Ci recalled the movie she had just watched. After a while, she came to a conclusion. \u201cThat man\u2019s figure is not as good as Brother Han\u2019s.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled. \u201cThank you for your affirmation.\u201d\n Around 9am, the plane landed in Haicheng. The two of them had lunch at the airport before boarding the flight back to Vienna at 1pm. After the plane took off, Song Ci chatted with Han Zhan for a while before dozing off.\n Song Ci had fallen asleep. Her lips were slightly parted, and on closer look, one could see a little bit of drool at the corner of her lips. Han Zhan felt that the way Song Ci looked when she was asleep was kind of cute and adorable. He couldn\u2019t resist taking a photo of her sleeping face with the digital camera.\n Thinking of how those big boss friends in the WeChat group would always share their feelings and pictures when taking their wives on a holiday, Han Zhan felt that his wife was the most beautiful sight. After alighting from the plane and reaching the hotel, Han Zhan posted on his social media.\n That night, all the big shots and elites who had added Han Zhan\u2019s WeChat friend circle saw that Han Zhan, who seldom updated his circle of friends, had posted:\n Han Zhan: My wife is so beautiful.jpg\n Song Ci was indeed very beautiful. Even when she was asleep, she was still very pretty. On Han Zhan\u2019s WeChat account, everyone commented that Mrs. Han was as beautiful as a flower and was a fairy herself.\n After taking a bath, Song Ci applied a layer of fragrant body lotion on herself. She changed into the sexy pyjamas that she had prepared in advance and walked out of the bathroom. Seeing Han Zhan sitting on the sofa playing with his cell phone, she purposely pulled down the collar of her pyjamas and quietly walked towards him.\n Standing behind Han Zhan, Song Ci bent down and wrapped her arms around him. Her hands slipped under that thin shirt.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d\n Biting Han Zhan\u2019s ear, Song Ci pretended to be unhappy. \u201cJust look at me. Why are you staring at your cell phone?\u201d\n Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s unruly hand and handed the screen to her. Like a child waiting to be praised, he said excitedly, \u201cBaby Ci, I\u2019ve posted you on my social media. My friends are all praising your good looks.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so? Let me see!\u201d\n Song Ci excitedly took the cell phone and looked down. She saw a photo of herself sleeping with messy hair and drooling mouth. She felt as if she had been struck by lightning. \u201cYou posted a photo of me drooling! Why didn\u2019t you photoshop it? Han Zhan, what feud do you have with me!\u201d\n Han Zhan was dumbstruck by Song Ci\u2019s scolding.\n He looked at the photo on his cell phone and then looked at Song Ci\u2019s true self in front of him. He felt slightly aggrieved. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, why are you still photoshopping? Only an indecent person would use photoshop...\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you know? Photoshopping is the most basic form of respect for a girl!\u201d Even if she was already stunning enough, photoshopping had already become a ritual.\n Han Zhan remembered this rule to heart and apologized with a good attitude. \u201cI will remember to photoshop in the future.\u201d\n There was no need to delete a photo that had already been seen by friends. Song Ci returned the phone to Han Zhan. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you this time.\u201d\n Han Zhan kept his cell phone and grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand. He ran his fingers along her fingertips, preparing to taste her beauty. At this moment, Song Ci suddenly pushed Han Zhan\u2019s head away. \u201cLater, I\u2019m going to the toilet!\u201d\n With that, she went into the toilet.\n Han Zhan thought that she was feeling unwell and took up his cell phone to download a photoshop software to study the tutorial.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "159": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-160\n\n Chapter 159: Song Ci, who will Seek Revenge for the Smallest Grievances  After entering the toilet, Song Ci sat on the toilet lid. She took her own cell phone, quickly typed a message, and sent it to her social media. Putting down her cell phone, Song Ci stared at herself in the mirror, opened her small makeup case, and took out a lace queen eye mask.\n Song Ci was preparing in the bathroom. Han Zhan stood at the door and asked Song Ci, \u201cBaby Ci, is Photoshop or Meitu Xiuxiu better?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cA newbie will use Meitu Xiuxiu.\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded and deleted Photoshop. He promised again. \u201cI will photoshop and make you even more beautiful in future.\u201d\n Han Zhan was curious as he didn\u2019t hear any movements inside. \u201cBaby Ci, what are you doing?\u201d\n Song Ci put down her eyeliner and pursed her red lips before saying, \u201cA surprise.\u201d\n \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned and walked towards the sofa. He had just sat down when he heard the sound of the toilet door turning. Han Zhan looked up and saw Song Ci standing at the door.\n She was wearing a pure black silk pyjamas with straps. Her lovely long curly hair was draped over her back and a lacy queen\u2019s eye mask was tied around her face. She had drawn her eyeliner and under that sexy, mysterious eye mask, her eyes were long, slender, and full of charm.\n Han Zhan held his breath and forgot what he wanted to say.\n Song Ci walked up to Han Zhan with bare feet. Only two extremely thin straps hung on her porcelain-white shoulders, as if they would snap at the slightest touch. Han Zhan reached out and hooked one of the straps, before asking her, \u201cWhen did you buy the pajamas? You look very good in them.\u201d\n \u201cI bought it at the mall on the day of the launch.\u201d Song Ci kissed Han Zhan\u2019s glabella and left a lipstick mark on it.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d Song Ci bent down and hooked Han Zhan\u2019s chin with her slender index finger. Lowering her eyes to look at Han Zhan\u2019s vibrating Adam\u2019s apple, Song Ci lifted her red lips and smiled rather domineeringly. \u201cWe can\u2019t waste time on the first night of our honeymoon, Brother Han...\u201d\n Han Zhan gave her a meaningful look and pulled her into his arms...\n ...\n It was deep into the night.\n Han Zhan was wearing a pair of long pants and stood on the balcony with a cup of warm tea in his hand. In the room, Song Ci had already fallen asleep. After being exhausted, she was sleeping in a very obedient position, her long hair scattered all over Han Zhan\u2019s pillow.\n Han Zhan leaned against the railing and gazed at Song Ci sleeping soundly on the bed. He suddenly thought of a phrase.\n Insatiable appetite.\n Ding-Dong.\n Han Zhan received a message from his grandfather.\n Calculating the time, it was already early in the morning in China. He wondered why his grandfather was looking for him so early in the morning. Han Zhan unlocked his cell phone, opened his chat with his grandfather, and opened the unread voice message.\n Han Zhan heard his grandfather say: [Haha, kid, why were you so fat in the past? Just now when I saw that photo of you on Lass Song\u2019s social media page, even I despised you!]\n Han Zhan: [Mmm? What post?] He replied to his grandfather with a voice message.\n Grandpa: [Didn\u2019t you see?]\n Han Zhan exited of the chat and found Song Ci, who was pinned to the top. After entering her social media page, he realized that Song Ci had updated a few hours ago.\n Song Ci: [Guess who this cute and honest little fatty is? Image.jpg.] Song Ci\u2019s attachment was a fat photo of Han Zhan when he was 12 years old. Song Ci had taken this photo on her cell phone a few days ago at Han Zhan\u2019s hometown.\n When Han Zhan saw that photo, he broke down slightly.\n Song Ci had so many friends on WeChat that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t sure how many people had seen her photo. Song Ci had posted it at 3am in the middle of the night. Calculating the time, she must have posted it while hiding in the toilet.\n Han Zhan could only pray that not many people saw the photo.\n He put down his glass and cell phone, returned to his room, found Song Ci\u2019s cell phone, and unlocked it with his fingerprint.\n Song Ci was sleeping like a pig and had no idea about this. Song Ci\u2019s friends didn\u2019t sleep at all in the middle of the night and were all active on various social media platforms. When Han Zhan opened Song Ci\u2019s WeChat account, he saw that the bottom row of the Discovery column displayed the number \u201c65.\u201d\n Han Zhan clicked on the status page and saw rows of likes and comments under Song Ci\u2019s status.\n Friend A: [Who is this? He is so fat and cute.]\n Friend B: [Look at the color of these eyes...]\n Friend C: [Could it be...]\n Friend D: [Your husband?]\n Han Wangwang: [Hahaha, Little Aunt, you must really love Little Uncle! Only true love can be so unscrupulous.]\n Han Zhan finally saw how vicious Song Ci\u2019s revenge was.\n A vengeful little rascal!\n He put down his cell phone and laid down on the other side of the bed. He pinched Song Ci\u2019s nose in retaliation. She instinctively slapped his hand away. \u201cStop it...\u201d She turned over and continued sleeping.\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cBaby Ci can\u2019t you be kinder to me?\u201d\n \u2013\n Early in the morning, Song Ci sat at the coffee table on the balcony, basking in the morning sun as she ate her breakfast and observed the various pedestrians downstairs. The weather was cooler here and she was wearing a long V-neck silk dress with a windbreaker to ward off the cold.\n Han Zhan pulled open the curtains and walked out bare-chested. He saw the low-cut dress under her windbreaker, frowned, and asked her, \u201cMust you wear this to spite me?\u201d She had forgotten the family rules.\n Song Ci took a sip of milk and licked the milk bubbles on her lips. \u201cHow many days have you slept at 10pm sharp? You can choose not to follow the rules, so can I.\u201d\n Han Zhan had already broken his own rules, and it was indeed unreasonable to expect Song Ci to follow them. However, Han Zhan felt slightly jealous to have his lover go out wearing such sexy clothes.\n \u201cCan\u2019t you just button up your windbreaker?\u201d This was Han Zhan\u2019s final offer.\n Song Ci put down the food in her hand, stood up, walked up to Han Zhan, opened her arms, and said, \u201cBrother Han, help me.\u201d Although she said this, her expression was as arrogant as a queen\u2019s.\n Han Zhan bent down and buttoned up all the buttons of her windbreaker without any complaints. \u201cWe will go to the Meiquan Palace in the morning, the Princess Ceci museum in the afternoon, and the Golden Hall at night. Put everything you need into your bag. I will help you carry it.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Only after Song Ci went to pack up did Han Zhan sit down to eat. After breakfast, Han Zhan made a call and within a short while, the hotel sent him a car. The driver accompanied him all day and had a good service attitude, waiting for his instructions at all times.\n They went to Meiquan Palace first. There were many people at the scenic area. Song Ci took a few photos of Han Zhan before putting her camera away. The two of them walked around Meiquan Palace before going to the next location. They shopped until evening before going for dinner.\n A funny thing happened during the meal. Han Zhan ordered expensive dishes for Song Ci, while he ordered large quantities of food for himself.\n Song Ci smiled at him. \u201cThe food you ordered isn\u2019t very tasty. Just give me some.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI will need to eat three servings of yours to be full.\u201d This restaurant was very expensive. Han Zhan didn\u2019t feel the pinch when spending money on Song Ci, but he couldn\u2019t bear to spend on himself.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "160": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-161\n\n Chapter 160: Zhan, His Name  Hearing this, Song Ci felt amused and pained at the same time. \u201cThen I\u2019ll give you some later to try.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan wasn\u2019t interested in wine, but he also opened a bottle of red wine. He liked seeing Song Ci taste wine elegantly. That bottle was not finished in the end and was brought back to the hotel by Song Ci.\n After returning to the hotel to change into formal wear, the two of them set off for the Golden Hall to watch the performance.\n There was a world-renowned pianist performing tonight. Han Zhan bought tickets in advance. He held Song Ci\u2019s hand, walked into the main hall, found their seats, and sat down.\n There were no empty seats and the atmosphere was very good.\n After sitting down, Song Ci tidied up her skirt that was scattered around her legs. She looked up at the first row, tilted her head, and whispered in Han Zhan\u2019s ear, \u201cWhen I came here the last time, I was sitting in the first row. At that time, my teacher was standing on stage.\u201d\n That was 10 years ago. Song Ci still remembered it vividly. She said, \u201cThat day, my teacher was the most outstanding man in the entire audience. Everyone was impressed by his performance. My teacher is the most wonderful musician I have ever seen.\u201d\n Song Ci looked slightly despondent at the mention of Shen Yubei. She missed her teacher but was too ashamed to meet him.\n Han Zhan tucked a stray strand of Song Ci\u2019s hair behind her ear. Before the performance started, he couldn\u2019t help kissing the side of Song Ci\u2019s face. The tip of Song Ci\u2019s nose was against his. He said, \u201cThe next time I come back, I will sit in the first row and look up at you on stage in the stars.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s lashes quivered.\n She couldn\u2019t help licking her lips as her heart thumped wildly. \u201cYou really think that day will come?\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s determined expression made Song Ci feel a surge of strength.\n She clutched her purse tightly and looked down. No one knew what she was thinking.\n The performance started and everyone quietened down to enjoy the music. After the performance ended, the audience left one by one. Song Ci stood up and heard Han Zhan say, \u201cI am going to the washroom, wait for me.\u201d\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n Song Ci waited for a while. When all the audience had left, she still didn\u2019t see Han Zhan.\n Standing alone in a foreign concert hall, Song Ci looked very small and lonely.\n Why isn\u2019t Han Zhan here yet?\n Song Ci felt slightly uneasy.\n She found her cell phone and was about to call Han Zhan when all the lights on stage suddenly lit up.\n A man\u2019s voice echoed throughout the entire golden hall from the microphone.\n \u201cNext, let\u2019s welcome the young violinist Song Ci to perform for us!\u201d\n It was Han Zhan\u2019s voice.\n Hearing this voice, Song Ci turned around in shock and saw Han Zhan walking out from the backstage.\n Han Zhan held a violin in his left hand and a bow in his right. He walked up to Song Ci and stuffed the violin solemnly into her hands. \u201cI secretly brought your violin over from China without your permission.\u201d\n This wasn\u2019t the violin that Yan Jiang had given Song Ci previously. Instead, it was the violin that Han Zhan had carved with the word \u201cBaby Ci\u201d. Song Ci felt that this scene was slightly absurd, but her heart was filled with waves of gratitude.\n She tugged at her hair helplessly and said with a red face, \u201cBrother Han, don\u2019t fool around. Not just anyone can be on this stage. I...\u201d\n A finger suddenly went up to Song Ci\u2019s lips, silencing her incessant chatter.\n Song Ci pursed her lips and looked up at Han Zhan. He said, \u201cSo what? No matter what, I will always be your loyal listener.\u201d\n Song Ci chuckled.\n Han Zhan urged her. \u201cGo up. I spent money to buy you a chance to perform on stage. You can\u2019t waste it.\u201d It was expensive.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t argue further. She carried the violin and walked up to the stage.\n There was only Han Zhan in the huge audience, but Song Ci felt like the entire world was listening to her. She closed her eyes slightly, lifted her bow, and started playing a violin tune that Han Zhan had never heard before.\n The sound of the violin echoed throughout the entire Golden Hall. Hearing the wailing sound of the violin, the staff behind the scenes in the Golden Hall stopped what they were doing and walked up to the stage in unison.\n They were either leaning against their seats or standing with their arms crossed, quietly listening to Song Ci\u2019s performance.\n Having worked at Golden Hall for so many years, even an illiterate person would have developed a good taste for music. They had never heard the piece Song Ci played, but they were all stunned.\n Music had a soul.\n They could hear a soul wailing in Song Ci\u2019s sorrowful tune. A bearded man suddenly rubbed his eyes. He had been moved by Song Ci\u2019s music.\n Song Ci had her eyes closed the entire time and didn\u2019t know the reactions of the audience.\n Her pretty face was originally filled with sorrow and silence. But in the next second, her gorgeous red lips suddenly curved into a brilliant smile. The sound of her violin also started to become like a refreshing spring breeze.\n It was as if a ray of light had burrowed into the darkness, and hope blossomed in her despondent soul.\n The sound of the violin became more and more diligent and lively. At one point, Song Ci suddenly opened her beautiful eyes. She hugged her violin and started to spin, her curly hair swaying seductively in the air.\n She was completely immersed in her own performance and had entered a mysterious independent world.\n Han Zhan stared at Song Ci, who was glowing all over. He suddenly understood the essence of the phrase \u201cGod grants rice\u201d.\n My Baby Ci is someone who was given food by God.\n After finishing the last note, Song Ci\u2019s swaying body remained still. She closed her eyes again and slowly calmed her racing heart. Only when her agitated heart finally calmed down did Song Ci put down her bow and open her eyes.\n Song Ci was slightly shocked to see more than 20 unfamiliar foreigners suddenly appearing behind Han Zhan.\n She blushed and felt somewhat helpless.\n \u201cGirl, you are such a genius!\u201d Someone whistled at her and gave her a thumbs-up.\n The crowd erupted in applause. Song Ci was momentarily stunned before she broke into a pure smile. She bowed and thanked him in German.\n Someone asked her, \u201cIs this your own creation? What is it called?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t understand German and looked to Han Zhan for help. Han Zhan translated that person\u2019s question into Chinese and told Song Ci, \u201cHe asked you if this is your own creation. What is the name of the work?\u201d\n Song Ci replied in Chinese, \u201cI improvised this work just now. I named it... Zhan.\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned.\n Someone nudged Han Zhan. \u201cSir, what did she say just now?\u201d Unable to understand Mandarin, they had no choice but to get Han Zhan to translate.\n Han Zhan snapped out of his trance and couldn\u2019t help but smile. He answered, \u201cThis was made on the spot by my wife. She said that the work is called Zhan.\u201d He said \u2018Zhan\u2019 in Chinese.\n The other party\u2019s eyes turned extremely puzzled. \u201cJian?\u201d The man tried to say the name of the song but the word \u201cZhan\u201d was changed to \u201cJian.\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head slightly, pointed at himself, and explained, \u201cZhan, my name.\u201d\n \u201cCool!\u201d Everyone finally understood.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "161": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-162\n\n Chapter 161: They Followed Each Other  Walking out of the Golden Hall, Song Ci\u2019s face was flushed red and she looked even more alluring.\n She carried the violin, held Han Zhan\u2019s arm, and walked side by side with him on the streets of Vienna. Han Zhan carried Song Ci\u2019s bag and said somewhat regretfully, \u201cI forgot to prepare flowers for you. I send flowers to celebrate your first successful performance.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t need any flowers. I am already very happy tonight.\u201d Song Ci released Han Zhan, grabbed the shoulder strap of the violin case with one hand, and twirled it in front of Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, I am so happy! I have not been so happy in a long time.\u201d\n Song Ci would remember this honeymoon for the rest of her life.\n She stopped and panted slightly as she said to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, if life in the future dulls the passion and romance between us, if we become short-tempered during our long vacation at home, remember to tell me what happened tonight from time to time. After I hear it, I will definitely hug your head and kiss your forehead to regain the feeling of being in love.\u201d\n Han Zhan remembered her words.\n Returning to the hotel, Song Ci was so excited that she couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Han Zhan was asleep and she was still playing with her cell phone.\n Tonight\u2019s incident reminded Song Ci of her teacher, Shen Yubei. She wondered if her teacher still remembered this disciple of hers.\n Like a guilty thief, Song Ci secretly searched for Shen Yubei\u2019s Weibo account in the middle of the night. She didn\u2019t find a Weibo name called Shen Yubei but saw many fans who named themselves after him.\n Song Ci scrolled for a while and saw a Weibo user with over 60,000 fans called \u201cShen Yaoyao\u201d. Her intuition told her that this person was most likely Shen Yubei.\n Song Ci entered the other party\u2019s Weibo page and saw that he only had five posts. The first post was a piano video posted three years ago. In the video, only a slender, beautiful man\u2019s hands appeared.\n The second video was released two years ago. This time, it showed a piano room with floor-to-ceiling windows, elegant gauze curtains, and a spacious room. Song Ci was familiar with everything in this video.\n Upon seeing this piano room, Song Ci was convinced of the other party\u2019s identity.\n It really is Teacher!\n Song Ci was all too familiar with her teacher\u2019s piano room. She still remembered how her teacher looked like when he stood by the French window of the piano room and played his violin.\n The last two Weibo posts were Shen Yubei\u2019s New Year\u2019s blessings. The last post was posted in August this year: [Those who survive a disaster will be blessed.]\n Song Ci\u2019s intuition told her that this Weibo message was referring to her. Her car accident had made the headlines in Wangdong City in August. Could Teacher have found out about the accident and specially made this post about me?\n Song Ci hesitated for a long while before finally clicking on it. After clicking on it, Song Ci thought she would see the words \u201calready noticed\u201d, but the words \u201cfollowed each other\u201d were displayed.\n Song Ci was stunned.\n When did Teacher start following me?\n Song Ci opened Shen Yubei\u2019s profile and saw that he was following over 30 people, and Song Ci was at the bottom, which was also Shen Yubei\u2019s first target...\n This discovery moved Song Ci. Song Ci thought that Shen Yubei was disappointed in her and didn\u2019t want to acknowledge her as his student. As a result, Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to meet Shen Yubei all these years.\n Shen Yubei was from Wangdong City. Sometimes, when she knew that Shen Yubei was going somewhere, Song Ci would instinctively avoid him. She had hidden away to be a snail, but Shen Yubei had been following her!\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes welled up and she cried on the spot. Afraid of waking Han Zhan up, Song Ci could only turn over and bury her face in the pillow. Having been in the special forces for so many years, Han Zhan had developed the habit of always being vigilant when sleeping. Song Ci\u2019s sobs were very soft, but Han Zhan still heard her.\n Han Zhan opened his eyes and realized that Song Ci was secretly crying. He hurriedly turned on the light. \u201cBaby Ci, why are you crying?\u201d Han Zhan hugged Song Ci\u2019s shoulder and released her face from the pillow.\n Han Zhan was shocked to see Song Ci\u2019s tear-streaked face. \u201cDid you have a nightmare?\u201d\n Song Ci hugged Han Zhan\u2019s neck tightly and cried as she told him, \u201cBrother Han, Teacher has been following my Weibo account for a long time. Say, when I go back this time, how about I apologize to him and invite him to our wedding?\u201d\n So that was the reason.\n Han Zhan heaved a sigh of relief. He also felt that Song Ci should settle the matter between her and Shen Yubei. \u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t dare to go alone, I will accompany you.\u201d\n Song Ci replied, \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u2013\n Song Ci and Han Zhan didn\u2019t stay in Vienna for long. The next day, they went to Gmunden City. It was a beautiful place with mountains and lakes. It was close to the Alps and was a good place for vacation.\n Lakeside Avenue was Song Ci\u2019s favorite place. She went there every day and saw all sorts of interesting sights.\n Many things happened in China during Song Ci\u2019s honeymoon.\n Firstly, Liang Bo debuted with Zhu Wen\u2019s help. The new song, \u201cIntoxication,\u201d was launched on various major music sites three days ago. With Zhu Wen\u2019s marketing strategy, \u201cIntoxication\u201d achieved pretty good results on its first day and took first place on the popularity rankings on the second day.\n Liang Bo\u2019s debut was considered a success.\n At the same time, Mu Qiu, who thought she would never have anything to do with Cheng Yanmo again, bumped into him at a Japanese restaurant.\n At that time, Mu Qiu was entertaining her dormitory mates.Her life was coming to an end and she wanted to bid them farewell seriously before dying. At the dinner, her roommates were all smiling beautifully and Mu Qiu hid the pain in her heart very well.\n After the meal, her friends had to rush back to school before the dormitory was locked. They hailed a cab and left. Mu Qiu settled the bill and sat alone in her seat, staring at the remains of her meal in a daze.\n This parting will be an eternal farewell...\n In another private room, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s assistant helped Cheng Yanmo send off the business partner. Cheng Yanmo sat alone in the room and poured himself another glass of rice wine. Just as he was about to drink it, he looked up and saw Mu Qiu passing by from the corridor outside.\n Looking at Mu Qiu\u2019s downcast face, Cheng Yanmo frowned slightly.\n That sorrowful expression was not suitable for Mu Qiu\u2019s clean and pure face. Cheng Yanmo put down his glass, took his things, got up, and walked out.\n \u201cMu Qiu.\u201d\n Mu Qiu halted.\n She turned around in surprise and saw that it was really Cheng Yanmo calling her. Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cMaster Cheng.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo strode up to her. He stared at Mu Qiu seriously for a moment before suddenly asking, \u201cCare to chat?\u201d\n \u201cAh...\u201d Mu Qiu didn\u2019t know what to say to Cheng Yanmo. Did he want to talk about how he felt that night? In the end, Mu Qiu still followed Cheng Yanmo out of the Japanese restaurant.\n Not seeing Mu Qiu\u2019s car at the door, Cheng Yanmo lowered his head and said, \u201cTake my car.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, sorry to trouble you.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "162": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-163\n\n Chapter 162: I Am About to Die  Cheng Yanmo drove Mu Qiu to the riverside square on the banks of the Yulong River. The two of them chose a wooden chair and sat down.\n Sitting there, they could see the Crouching Dragon Building. Mu Qiu stared at that domineering dragon head and asked Cheng Yanmo softly, \u201cMaster Cheng, what do you want to talk to me about?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo chuckled. \u201cYou called me Master Cheng?\u201d\n Mu Qiu instinctively explained. \u201cEveryone calls you that.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes dimmed slightly. He said, \u201cBut that night, you called me Brother Mo.\u201d Thinking of that crying and happy \u2018Brother Mo\u2019, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s chest warmed slightly.\n Mu Qiu blushed.\n She shot Cheng Yanmo a reproachful look, turned to look at her surroundings, and noticed that no one else heard Cheng Yanmo\u2019s words. Only then did Mu Qiu relax. \u201cMaster Cheng, you said before that you\u2019re not the kind of person who will be responsible for a woman after sleeping. In that case, let\u2019s not talk about the details of that night anymore.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was truly heartless.\n Mu Qiu was the most sensible girl Cheng Yanmo had ever met.\n \u201cIt was a pleasant night.\u201d Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t intend to change the subject.\n Mu Qiu felt slightly helpless. She didn\u2019t know whether it was a happy occasion or not, but it was deeply etched in her memory. \u201cIf you keep talking about this, I will think that you are still missing me, Master Cheng.\u201d Mu Qiu used her most innocent expression to say the most seductive words.\n Cheng Yanmo watched as her expression darkened.\n He didn\u2019t want to admit that he had been thinking of Mu Qiu all this time. She was clearly not the hottest girl in the room, and her skills... could be said to be lacklustre. But that innocent and natural reaction was what Cheng Yanmo loved.\n Cheng Yanmo took out his cell phone and looked at it for a while, before turning it off again.\n A gentle breeze blew past. Mu Qiu\u2019s hair swayed gently and a faint layer of sadness covered her face. This made Mu Qiu look even more fragile and beautiful. Cheng Yanmo\u2019s throat tightened. He reached out and hooked a strand of Mu Qiu\u2019s black hair in the wind.\n Mu Qiu stared at his actions, her brows slightly furrowed.\n \u201cMu Qiu.\u201d Cheng Yanmo invited her. \u201cI am resting tomorrow. Do you want to come to my house tonight?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was stunned.\n Coming back to her senses, she asked Cheng Yanmo, \u201cAre you addicted to me, Master Cheng?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo replied, \u201cI\u2019m not addicted, but I do miss you.\u201d\n Mu Qiu suddenly took off Cheng Yanmo\u2019s glasses. She leaned close to him and gazed into his pitch-black eyes. \u201cMaster Cheng, you\u2019ve made things very difficult for me...\u201d She was already prepared to never pester Cheng Yanmo again before her death, but he came to provoke her instead.\n Cheng Yanmo took back his glasses and put them on, before asking her, \u201cWhat\u2019s your answer?\u201d\n Her heart wavered for him and she couldn\u2019t say no. Mu Qiu nodded and agreed. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to your house.\u201d\n After a night of passion, Cheng Yanmo realized that not only was he not satisfied, he wanted more. The next morning, Mu Qiu woke up, saw Cheng Yanmo neatly dressed in the armchair, and greeted him.\n \u201cMorning.\u201d Cheng Yanmo nodded at her, his eyes still fixed on Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu could sense it. She pulled down her shirt and sat on the bed. She turned to ask Cheng Yanmo, \u201cMaster Cheng, do you have something to say to me?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo stood up slowly and walked over to the side of the bed. He exuded an air of nobility and arrogance. Mu Qiu was about to put on her slippers when the man suddenly said, \u201cLet\u2019s date and see how it goes.\u201d\n Mu Qiu widened her eyes.\n She looked up in shock and met Cheng Yanmo\u2019s gaze. He looked at her with a complex expression and said, \u201cMu Qiu, you\u2019re an adult and I\u2019m single. Let\u2019s date.\u201d\n This was a development that Mu Qiu never expected.\n \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you\u2019re not the kind of person who will take responsibility after a good night\u2019s sleep?\u201d Mu Qiu didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy... do you want to try it with me?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo said frankly, \u201cIt\u2019s rare for me to be infatuated with someone of the opposite sex. I want to get to know you better.\u201d\n To Cheng Yanmo\u2019s surprise, Mu Qiu didn\u2019t react joyfully or happily.\n Cheng Yanmo frowned. Could I have guessed wrongly? Mu Qiu didn\u2019t like me at all? That shouldn\u2019t be the case. Every now and then, this little girl would look at me with infatuation and love in her eyes.\n Mu Qiu clutched tightly at the fabric of her blouse. She bit her lips, her expression sorrowful.\n \u201cMaster Cheng, you might not know, but I...\u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was slightly annoyed by Mu Qiu\u2019s hesitation. \u201cYou\u2019re not willing?\u201d\n \u201cNot really.\u201d Mu Qiu got up and walked over to Cheng Yanmo\u2019s side. Standing beside him, Mu Qiu finally told him. \u201cI have a heart disease. Two months ago, my condition suddenly acted up. I have RH-negative blood. It\u2019s very difficult to find a suitable heart for a rare blood type with a rare blood type. I waited for more than two months but...\u201d\n A hint of shock flashed across Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes.\n \u201cSo you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI am going to die soon.\u201d Mu Qiu looked up with an extremely cold smile on her pale face. \u201cBrother Mo, I don\u2019t have much time left. Perhaps you will hear about the Mu family\u2019s daughter dying from a heart attack tomorrow. Perhaps the next time we meet will be my funeral...\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s fingers were almost tearing her blouse.\n She lowered her head to conceal her fragility so that Cheng Yanmo wouldn\u2019t see.\n Cheng Yanmo remained silent. He was somewhat stunned by this news.\n Cheng Yanmo was a very busy man. He naturally didn\u2019t know about the heart attack of the Mu Family\u2019s youngest daughter. As a result, after knowing Mu Qiu for so long, Cheng Yanmo actually didn\u2019t know that she had a heart attack and was even sentenced to death by the doctor.\n \u201cI\u2019ll go change first.\u201d Mu Qiu went to the dryer to get her own clothes. After changing, she returned to the room. She saw Cheng Yanmo returning to the window, quietly staring out, looking deeply shocked.\n Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t bear it and comforted Cheng Yanmo instead. \u201cAfter spending more than two months, I\u2019ve already accepted the fact that I\u2019m a patient. Brother Mo, you don\u2019t have to be sad for me. This is my destiny.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m leaving. See you next time.\u201d Mu Qiu picked up her bag, glanced at Cheng Yanmo reluctantly, and then left.\n Cheng Yanmo suddenly turned around and called out to Mu Qiu. \u201cI will help you search for your heart. Wait for my news.\u201d\n Mu Qiu turned and gave him a grateful smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d But Mu Qiu no longer held any hope.\n Mu Mian had already contacted someone from the underground market, but there was still no good news. This meant that it wasn\u2019t easy to find the heart source of RH-negative blood. If Mu Mian couldn\u2019t find it, so could Cheng Yanmo.\n ]Walking out of Cheng Yanmo\u2019s house, Mu Qiu\u2019s smile suddenly disappeared.\n Leaning against the wall in front of Cheng\u2019s family residence, she slowly slid to the ground, hugged her head, and started crying.\n Date and see...\n Mu Qiu\u2019s heart broke. How can I have the time to date Cheng Yanmo and see how it goes?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "163": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-164\n\n Chapter 163: Father Is Useless and Cannot Protect You  During lunch break, Mu Mian opened his chat with the intermediary again. The last time he contacted the intermediary was a week ago. After another week, Mu Mian lost his patience.\n He couldn\u2019t resist typing again.\n Mu Mian: [Hi, is there any news?]\n 1 was online all day. Mu Mian\u2019s message was only sent for about 40 seconds before he replied.\n : [This is not easy to handle. We can\u2019t find a suitable heart. I think I should return the deposit to you.] Mu Mian had already expected this outcome. But when he saw 1\u2019s reply, he still felt very despondent.\n Mu Mian was not willing to lose this last clear path. He humbly asked: [Sir, is there no other way?]\n : [What choice do I have? I can\u2019t possibly kill someone!]\n Mu Mian narrowed his eyes.\n He really dared to kill for Mu Qiu.\n Mu Mian was a little distracted at work in the afternoon. When it was time to knock off, he packed up and went home. Du Tingting went out for a walk and Auntie Zhang was the only one at home. Mu Mian instructed Auntie Zhang. \u201cMake some pickled pork knuckles tonight. Both the mother and daughter love them.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, Sir.\u201d\n Seeing that Mu Mian was going upstairs, Auntie Zhang said worriedly, \u201cSir, Miss came back in the afternoon.\u201d\n Last night, Mu Qiu had sent a message saying that she wanted to meet up with a friend and wouldn\u2019t return that night. His daughter had been very obedient and Mu Mian never doubted that Mu Qiu would lie. Hearing Auntie Zhang say that Mu Qiu was back, Mu Mian didn\u2019t take it to heart.\n Auntie Zhang added, \u201cMiss\u2019s mental state isn\u2019t right. Her eyes were slightly red and swollen when she came back. She must have cried.\u201d\n \u201cShe cried?\u201d\n Mu Mian frowned. \u201cGot it.\u201d He went upstairs.\n He knocked on Mu Qiu\u2019s door and entered without her permission.\n Mu Qiu was still awake. She was watching a Korean movie called \u201cThe Rubber in My Mind.\u201d As Mu Qiu watched, she dabbed at her tears and mucus with a tissue. She looked rather neurotic.\n Mu Mian turned off her iPad.\n ]Mu Qiu looked up with reddened eyes, silently protesting Mu Mian\u2019s overbearing behavior.\n Mu Mian said, \u201cThat person replied me today.\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes quivered.\n \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n Under Mu Qiu\u2019s expectant gaze, Mu Mian couldn\u2019t help shaking his head. Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes dimmed instantly, turning grey and lifeless. \u201cI see...\u201d\n Mu Qiu smiled bitterly and comforted herself. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Father. Don\u2019t feel guilty. You\u2019ve already done too much for me.\u201d\n Mu Mian was not comforted.\n Mu Mian\u2019s heart felt like it was being stabbed as he gazed at his daughter\u2019s beautiful face. \u201cQiu-er, I can\u2019t protect you anymore.\u201d With that, Mu Mian started crying. He supported his forehead with one hand and his tears and mucus fell onto his pants.\n \u201cQiu-er, father is useless and cannot protect you...\u201d\n \u201cFather is useless...\u201d\n The middle-aged man\u2019s tears burned Mu Qiu\u2019s heart.\n Mu Qiu hugged her father\u2019s shoulders tightly and said tearfully, \u201cFather, you are the best father in the world. I am already very satisfied to be able to bid you farewell and leave.\u201d\n Compared to those who had left in a hurry without even saying goodbye, Mu Qiu was already very fortunate.\n It was a good thing that Mu Qiu thought this way, but Mu Mian couldn\u2019t accept it. \u201cYou are my baby. I can\u2019t bear for you to leave.\u201d\n \u201cFather, don\u2019t be like this. I feel terrible...\u201d\n The father-daughter duo hugged each other and wailed in despair.\n At dinner that night, the father-daughter duo tacitly stopped talking about this matter and pretended to be relaxed. Du Tingting didn\u2019t notice the secret between the father-daughter duo. She told Mu Mian, \u201cSong Ci called me today.\u201d\n \u201cHer?\u201d Mu Mian didn\u2019t wish to bring up Song Ci and didn\u2019t ask further. Instead, Mu Qiu asked with concern, \u201cDid Elder Sister have a good time in Austria?\u201d\n \u201cOf course she\u2019s having fun. But she\u2019s very worried about Song Fei.\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei?\u201d Mu Qiu asked, \u201cWhat happened to Song Fei? Isn\u2019t she awake? Why is elder sister still worried about her?\u201d\n Mu Mian also looked at Du Tingting curiously.\n \u201cYou guys don\u2019t know, right?\u201d Du Tingting told them. \u201cThat child Song Fei actually went to Congo to study the virus there.\u201d Du Tingting shook her head and sighed. \u201cI heard that Congo is very chaotic, yet Song Fei went there. Of course Song Ci is worried.\u201d\n Mu Mian snorted coldly and said without any pity, \u201cIf anything really happens, she deserves it. If she knew that it was dangerous there, why did she still go!\u201d\n Mu Qiu frowned, slightly worried about Song Fei\u2019s condition. \u201cI also heard that the political situation in the Congo is very chaotic. A few days ago, I saw the news that there was a riot and someone died. What if something really happens to Song Fei...\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Mian stopped eating and stared at the bowl of soup in front of him in a daze.\n Song Fei was an opinionated person and Du Tingting didn\u2019t wish to speak too much about her matters. Thinking of something else, Du Tingting grabbed Mu Mian\u2019s hand and said, \u201cIt will be Father-in-law\u2019s death anniversary in two days. I won\u2019t be going with you to pay my respects this year.\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s father was an alcoholic. When Mu Mian graduated from university, Mu Mian\u2019s father went into a drunken fit and fell into the river. By the time his body was found, he was already dead.\n After his death, Father Mu was cremated and buried in the Great Hall of Peace.\n Du Tingting was slightly superstitious. She was pregnant and didn\u2019t wish to go to places like the Great Hall of Peace where there was so much Yin energy. Mu Mian naturally had no objections. He said, \u201cSince you are pregnant, you can\u2019t go there. Just stay home and recuperate.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Mu Mian asked Mu Qiu, \u201cWhat about you? Are you coming with me?\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going either.\u201d Anyway, she would be meeting her grandfather in the underworld soon and couldn\u2019t be bothered to make the trip.\n \u201cThen I\u2019ll go alone.\u201d\n ...\n The next day, Mu Mian got up early and changed into a pure black suit. He drove to the Great Hall of Peace to pay his respects to his late father.\n long the way, he stopped by a small shop and bought a bottle of Erguotou. Mu Mian\u2019s father was called Mu Congjun. He was an alcoholic when he was alive. Mu Mian didn\u2019t bring anything else with him when he came to visit his father. He only prepared a small bottle of wine for him.\n Mu Mian took out the Erguotou he had brought over last year and placed it in a small bag. He then placed the newly bought wine beside the urn.\n Staring at his father\u2019s photo in the urn, there was no nostalgia in Mu Mian\u2019s eyes. Instead, there was only coldness and mockery. \u201cFather, I\u2019ve brought you your favorite Erguotou.\u201d\n As he spoke, his lips curled into a mocking smile. \u201cEvery time you got drunk, you would hit my mother. In the end, she couldn\u2019t stand being bullied anymore and hung herself. I\u2019ve always wanted to ask you this\u2014when you woke up that morning and saw your dead wife hanging on your door, did you ever regret even for a second?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "164": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-165\n\n Chapter 164: The Drunk Father Mu  Mu Mian didn\u2019t expect a dead person to answer his question. He shook his head and laughed mockingly. \u201cNo matter how strong you are or how good you are at fighting, you will still turn into ashes when you die. You\u2019re still trapped by me in this box.\u201d\n In the photo, Mu Congjun actually looked very simple and honest. One look and one would think that he was a good and honest person, but one should never judge a book by its cover. Even a demon might put on the facade of an honest person.\n It was said that dragons gave birth to phoenixes, while mice gave birth to sons with holes. Mu Mian was most afraid of becoming an alcoholic as cruel as his father.\n Mu Mian stared at the photo in a daze. He heaved a long sigh and said, \u201cI am different from you. I love my wife and my children. I am different from you. I am not a beast who is worse than a dog.\u201d\n I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019ll come visit you again next year.\u201d\n Mu Mian walked out of the hall and narrowed his eyes as he saw the rising sun.\n He got into the car and drove to the office. At this moment, an ugly woman in a grey jacket walked out from behind the bushes. She took out her cell phone and called her employer.\n \u201cMiss Su, Mu Mian went to the Great Hall of Peace early this morning to pay respects to his late father.\u201d\n When Su Beibei received this call, she had just slept for less than three hours. Last night, she suddenly had the inspiration to stay up late writing. She had started writing on her computer and couldn\u2019t stop until 5am in the morning.\n She rubbed her throbbing temples and said, \u201cAlright, I got it.\u201d After hanging up, Su Beibei sat at the head of the bed letting her imagination run wild. Her mind was in a mess.\n She went to wash her face and made herself a sandwich with toasted bread. She had just taken a bite when she received a video call from Li Li.\n \u201cBeibei.\u201d Li Li was driving. He glanced at Su Beibei in the camera, then focused on the road ahead.\n Su Beibei reminded Li Li, \u201cJust drive. Don\u2019t look at me.\u201d Her cold voice flowed into Li Li\u2019s heart, dispelling the sleepiness.\n Li Li smiled and asked her, \u201cAre you free tonight? I want to meet you. I\u2019ll treat you to a meal at Deep Alley\u2019s western restaurant. We\u2019ll have dinner there.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive there.\u201d Su Beibei had been there once. The cost-effectiveness ratio was low, but the taste was pretty good. \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else. There\u2019s no need to go to such a high-class place.\u201d\n Li Li said, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday today.\u201d\n Su Beibei put down her sandwich and stared at Li Li. She asked him, \u201c29 years old or 30 years old?\u201d\n Li Li rubbed his nose and said sheepishly, \u201c29 years old.\u201d\n \u201cYou are already an old man.\u201d\n Li Li was shot in the heart and smiled bitterly. \u201cPlease show mercy to the birthday boy.\u201d\n Su Beibei stopped teasing him and asked Li Li, \u201cWhat present do you want?\u201d\n Li Li stole a glance at her and stared at her lips as she ate. His imagination ran wild, but he didn\u2019t dare to slack off while driving and quickly looked away.\n \u201cI want a kiss,\u201d Li Li said.\n Su Beibei chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll give you double.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d Li Li was somewhat expectant.\n \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you.\u201d Su Beibei took a bite of her sandwich and said, \u201cI\u2019m free tonight. I\u2019ll go to your office to look for you.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After hanging up, Su Beibei felt troubled. Although she was a writer and possessed bold and imaginative thinking, Su Beibei was not good at romance.\n She was not a romance fiction author\u2014she was a mystery fiction author! She knew how to dismember bodies without leaving any traces, but she didn\u2019t know what kind of gift to give to win her boyfriend\u2019s heart.\n Su Beibei thought of Song Ci\u2019s social skills as the top socialite, and hurriedly took out her cell phone to send Song Ci a message on WeChat. Su Beibei: Ms. Song, what present should I get for my boyfriend\u2019s birthday?]\n It was late at night in Austria. Song Ci was already asleep and her cell phone was turned to silent mode, so she did not see Su Beibei\u2019s message.\n Only when Song Ci didn\u2019t reply did Su Beibei realize that there was a 7-hour time difference between China and Austria. Song Ci must be sleeping. She pouted and decided to go shopping on her own.\n Su Beibei opened the wardrobe and saw that it was filled with dark outfits. She fell silent. It didn\u2019t seem very suitable to wear dark outfits on a date.\n I should go and buy some nice clothes.\n In the morning, Su Beibei bought clothes and a present for Li Li. She went home for a nap. In the afternoon, she drove alone to the resting hall mentioned by the private investigator.\n There were many resting halls in Wangdong City, but the one in front of her was considered the most luxurious. The main hall was glittering with gold and jade. If she didn\u2019t know this was the Great Hall of Peace, Su Beibei would have thought she had arrived at a hotel.\n She found Mu Congjun\u2019s ashes.\n Standing in front of Mu Congjun\u2019s urn, Su Beibei fell into a daze. Recently, she had been getting someone to tail and investigate Mu Mian. However, Mu Mian was a very clean and straightforward person. It would not be easy to catch him.\n But Su Beibei felt that Song Ci\u2019s deduction of Mu Mian was correct. It had not been easy for Mu Mian to grow from having nothing to being a billionaire. With his character, he would not easily destroy such important evidence. He enjoyed hiding from the police and secretly gloating.\n Where could he hide the evidence?\n Su Beibei had no idea.\n She had checked on Mu Mian\u2019s family background and found out that he was not a local. He was from Hai Cheng in the south. His mother had committed suicide when he was in his third year of junior high school. Although his father, Mu Congjun, was a small-time director of a state-owned enterprise and looked honest and honest, he was an alcoholic.\n According to the investigation, Mu Congjun had a very positive image in the company. He was honest, sincere and professional in his work, but his neighbors\u2019 opinions of him varied.\n Mu Congjun would occasionally hit his wife when he was drunk. After that, he would kneel down, hug his wife\u2019s waist, and apologize while sobbing profusely.\n His wife loved and hated him at the same time.\n After his wife hung herself and passed away, Mu Congjun didn\u2019t remarry. Instead, he became both the father and the mother, raising Mu Mian into an adult. Logically speaking, their father-son relationship shouldn\u2019t be bad. But after Mu Mian came to Wangdong City to attend university, he actually didn\u2019t return to his hometown in Hai Cheng for four years to visit his father.\n It was clear that there was a barrier between the father and son.\n After Mu Congjun\u2019s death, Mu Mian rushed back to Hai Cheng from Wangdong City and cremated Mu Congjun\u2019s body before bringing him back to the resting hall. Every year on Mu Congjun\u2019s death anniversary, Mu Mian would visit him and never return during the holidays.\n Su Beibei felt it was rather strange. Since Mu Mian hated his father, there was no need for him to pay respects every death anniversary. This was not Mu Mian\u2019s style.\n The golden urn in front of her was made into countless cubes. Su Beibei opened the door and saw an exquisite urn and a bottle of Erguotou inside.\n Su Beibei stared at that Erguotou as a strange feeling flashed across her heart. Mu Mian\u2019s father had fallen into the river when he was drunk. Yet after his father died, Mu Mian actually gives his father Erguotou every year. What does he mean?\n After confirming that there was nothing wrong with the hall, Su Beibei left.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

She then messaged Li Li: [I am at your office lobby.]\n After a while, Li Li replied: [Wait for me.]\n A few minutes later, Li Li came down.\n Dressed in a custom-made suit, Li Li exuded the aura of an elite CEO. As he walked out of the lift, many people greeted him respectfully. In front of his employees, Li Li had set up an image that he could only be seen from afar and not touched. As a result, he only nodded coldly at the greetings of these employees.\n When he saw Su Beibei sitting on the sofa in the waiting area, a faint smile finally appeared on CEO Li\u2019s cold face.\n \u201cBeibei!\u201d\n Li Li almost didn\u2019t recognize Su Beibei. She was wearing a dark red long-sleeved dress and a black felt hat. Her black hair reached her waist and her lips were fiery red. She exuded her usual aura.\n Every time they met, Su Beibei would bring a different kind of beauty to Li Li.\n \u201cAh Li.\u201d Su Beibei stood up and reached out her hand to Li Li.\n Li Li was very surprised and flattered. He grabbed Su Beibei\u2019s hand, his heart racing. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He pulled Su Beibei out and met Bei Zhan at the door.\n \u201cAiyo!\u201d Bei Zhan stared at Li Li and Su Bei holding hands. His eyes were sparkling with an ambiguous glow.\n \u201cGeneral Manager Li, your girlfriend is...?\u201d Bei Zhan was a few years older than Li Li. He was already married and had wanted to introduce a girlfriend to Li Li with his wife. Unexpectedly, Li Li finally managed to find himself a girlfriend.\n Bei Zhan glanced at Su Beibei, winked at Li Li, and said, \u201cWhere did you fool such a beauty?\u201d\n Li Li ignored Bei Zhan and said to Su Beibei, \u201cHe\u2019s a fool. Ignore him.\u201d\n Su Beibei could tell at a glance that the two of them were very close. She just smiled.\n Bei Zhan put away his joking expression and stretched out his right hand to Su Beibei. He introduced himself. \u201cHello beautiful lady, I am Bei Zhan, Li Li\u2019s friend and colleague.\u201d\n Su Beibei grabbed Bei Zhan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cHi, my name is Su Beibei.\u201d\n Looking at the anxious Li Li, Bei Zhan knew that Li Li cared a lot about this lady.\n That year, after Li Li\u2019s father killed someone in a car accident, the hit-and-run driver returned home. His family advised him to turn himself in, but he couldn\u2019t bear it and jumped out of the window. His father was a murderer who committed suicide by jumping off a building after a hit-and-run. As a result, Li Li was given the title of \u201cmurderer\u2019s son\u201d by his classmates.\n When Li Li was in high school, he was very introverted and couldn\u2019t even walk straight. After that, when he went to university, he took Han Zhan\u2019s money and worked for him. In order to not let down Mr. Han\u2019s trust, Li Li forced himself to be strong and brave.\n With the growth from his experience and the rise of his status, Li Li finally became CEO Li. He was very authoritative and seemed very powerful, but there was a place in his heart that still held that inferior young man.\n He still remembered that he was the son of a murderer.\n Li Li had also dated several times in the past, but they always ended in failure. This was also related to his lack of confidence.\n Bei Zhan saw that Li Li cared about Su Beibei a lot, and was worried that this relationship would end just like before. Bei Zhan blinked at Su Beibei and asked her, \u201cMiss Su, do you mind adding me on WeChat? If there is any news of Li Li being involved in scandals in the company, I will definitely report it to you immediately!\u201d\n Su Beibei guessed that Bei Zhan probably had something to tell her, so she added him on WeChat.\n Bei Zhan switched off his cell phone. \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t disturb your date then.\u201d Bei Zhan patted Li Li\u2019s shoulder and wished him well. \u201cHappy Birthday, Xiao Li.\u201d\n Li Li shot him a look and said, \u201cNo need for that. Where\u2019s the present?\u201d\n Bei Zhan immediately moved his hand away from Li Li\u2019s shoulder and walked into the office. As he walked, he said, \u201cYour sister-in-law just bought a bag two days ago and spent over 30,000 yuan. Your brother is very poor too. I will definitely prepare a big present for you next year...\u201d\n As he spoke, Bei Zhan left.\n Li Li said, \u201cStingy.\u201d\n Su Beibei said to Li Li, \u201cMy car is parked outside. Take my car today. Tomorrow morning, you can take a cab to the office.\u201d\n Li Li naturally had no objections. He said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to trouble you to send me home tonight.\u201d\n Su Beibei raised her brows. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going home tonight.\u201d\n \u201cWhat else...\u201d Li Li thought of something and widened his eyes. His gaze changed as he asked Su Beibei in a raspy voice,\u201d Am I really not going home? \u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cI brought all my clothes.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s heartbeat quickened. He lowered his head slightly, his ears slightly red. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a little too soon...\u201d\n Su Beibei looked at him with a faint smile. She shook her head and said, \u201cNot really.\u201d\n The girl had already taken the initiative. It was not right for Li Li to pretend to be pretentious.\n He suddenly said, \u201cA few days later, I\u2019ll bring you home to meet my mother on my off day.\u201d Li Li planned to bring Su Beibei back to meet his parents. He really wanted to marry Su Beibei and spend the rest of his life with her.\n Su Beibei was shocked.\n She could feel how serious Li Li was towards this relationship.\n Su Beibei suddenly asked Li Li, \u201cWhat if Aunty doesn\u2019t like me and doesn\u2019t want us to be together?\u201d\n Li Li gave a faint smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not marrying my mother. You\u2019re marrying me, so why will she care so much?\u201d\n Su Beibei mocked him. \u201cAre you still your mother\u2019s considerate son?\u201d\n \u201cI am the one earning money in my family. I have the final say in everything.\u201d A man in charge was full of confidence. Li Li said, \u201cIt is my freedom to marry whoever I want. My mother can\u2019t control me.\u201d\n His mother was not as observant as him. Otherwise, she would not have married his father.\n Walking to the side of the car, Su Beibei suddenly stopped and told Li Li, \u201cI bought a present for you. I placed it in my luggage. Do you want to take a look first?\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d Li Li instinctively walked towards the back of the car. After taking two steps, he suddenly slapped his own forehead and said, \u201cI forgot that your luggage is in front of the car.\u201d\n Li Li had never driven a sports car before and almost made a fool of himself. Su Bei shrugged and didn\u2019t look down on him. Instead, she said, \u201cThen let\u2019s change to a car with a trunk in the back.\u201d\n \u201cNo need.\u201d\n Opening the car hood, Li Li was stunned to see a huge bunch of gift boxes. \u201cSo many? All for me?\u201d\n \u201cAll for you.\u201d Su Beibei walked up to Li Li. She pointed at the gift boxes and said, \u201cInside that box is an iPhone. Save it for when your phone breaks down. Inside is a watch, a pair of cufflinks, a belt, a lighter, and a man\u2019s bracelet...\u201d\n Li Li was stunned. \u201cWhy did you buy so many?\u201d\n Su Beibei leaned against the hood of the car and said disconsolately, \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a relationship. I don\u2019t know what kind of gift to give my boyfriend. Coincidentally, I don\u2019t lack money, so I bought everything that suits you.\u201d\n This sounded very much like a sugar mommy\u2019s words. Li Li fell silent.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Don\u2019t be so extravagant in the future. I feel like I am being kept by you now.\u201d Li Li touched his nose sheepishly.\n u Beibei glanced at Li Li\u2019s expensive suit and sneered. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to feed you yet, CEO Li.\u201d As the general manager of Zeus Airlines, Li Li\u2019s annual expenses were not small. Just those custom-made suits alone cost a fortune.\n \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go eat.\u201d\n Su Beibei drove the car to Deep Alley Restaurant and had a romantic western meal with Li Li.\n After the meal, Li Li felt rather restless. He asked Su Beibei, \u201cWhich hotel do you want to stay in? Is there any place you prefer?\u201d Since they wanted to book a room, Li Li had to fork out the hotel money. This was his final stubborn streak.\n Su Beibei smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s not stay in a hotel. We\u2019ll stay in the mountains.\u201d\n \u201cAh?\u201d Li Li thought he heard wrongly. \u201cStay on the mountain?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll bring you to see the stars.\u201d\n The two of them rented an off-road vehicle and drove to the outskirts. Only then did Li Li understand that Su Bei said that she wasn\u2019t going home that night not because she wanted to check into a hotel and do something embarrassing. Instead, she wanted to go camping on the mountain and watch the stars.\n The car could only be parked halfway up the hill. They had to hike up to the top.\n Su Beibei changed into sportswear in the car and put on shoes. As they alighted, Li Li noticed that Su Beibei had wound up her hair in a rare display, revealing a face the size of a palm.\n A 23 year old little girl was extremely tender.\n \u201cYou look pretty good in sportswear.\u201d Li Li felt that Su Bei looked good in anything.\n Su Beibei snorted.\n As she hadn\u2019t informed Li Li beforehand, Li Li hadn\u2019t prepared any sportswear. He was wearing a suit and leather shoes, while Su Beibei and he each carried a small bag to hike.\n Arriving at the top of the hill and setting up her tent, Su Beibei took off her shoes. Under Li Li\u2019s shocked gaze, she nimbly climbed onto a large, thick tree. Sitting on the tree trunk, Su Beibei looked down and called out to Li Li, \u201cCome up, Ah Li. The stars are better here.\u201d\n Li Li took off his leather shoes and climbed up the tree in socks. He sat down with Su Beibei and looked up at the stars in the sky.\n Wangdong City was polluted by air. In a year, only a few stars could be seen in the night sky after heavy rain. But the air was fresh on the high mountains in the suburbs and visibility was high. One could see stars all over the sky just by looking up.\n Li Li cherished this moment.\n Su Beibei told Li Li, \u201cWhen I was young, my father would occasionally bring me up to the mountains to stargaze.\u201d Su Beibei pointed at the two brightest stars and told Li Li, \u201cThat\u2019s my father and that\u2019s my mother.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s grin was gone. \u201cYour parents...\u201d\n \u201cThey passed away.\u201d Su Beibei told Li Li, \u201cI was only 9 years old that year. My father said that people will turn into stars after they die. I brought you here today to meet my parents.\u201d\n Su Beibei gazed tenderly at the two stars in the night sky. She said to them, \u201cFather, Mother, I am in a relationship. The man beside me is my boyfriend. His name is Li Li. Today is his 29th birthday. I brought him to meet you.\u201d\n Su Beibei started singing a happy birthday song.\n \u201cHappy birthday to you...\u201d\n \u201cHappy birthday to you...\u201d\n Li Li watched Su Beibei sing and his heart melted.\n After Su Beibei finished singing, she turned to Li Li. \u201cYou can have your cake now.\u201d\n ]Li Li reached out and cupped Su Beibei\u2019s cheek. He gazed lovingly at her. \u201cWhere should I start eating?\u201d\n Su Beibei had already wiped off her lipstick. She tapped her red lips. \u201cHere.\u201d\n Li Li tasted it.\n Soft and sweet.\n \u201cSo sweet.\u201d It\u2019s really sweet.\n Su Beibei smiled and secretly told him, \u201cI put honey on it.\u201d\n Startled, Li Li bent down and kissed her again...\n ...\n A small boat was cruising along the surface of Gmunden Lake. Song Ci covered her face with her hat and laid flat on the boat, bathing in the warm autumn sunlight.\n Holding the fishing rod, Han Zhan sat there like an old monk in meditation.\n Song Ci put a white fishermen\u2019s hat on his head. The contrast between that white hat and his bronzed skin was stark.\n Song Ci\u2019s voice suddenly came from under her hat. \u201cLast night, Su Beibei sent me a message asking me what present she should get for Li Li\u2019s birthday today.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at the lake. Hearing this, he finally said, \u201cOh yes, today seems to be Li Li\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n \u201cTsk, you still say that you\u2019re his good brother. You don\u2019t even remember his birthday.\u201d Song Ci took off her hat and put it on. She sat up and crossed her legs as she looked at the blue sky. \u201cDid you catch a fish?\u201d\n \u201cThe fish here have turned into sperm.\u201d Only after Han Zhan gave them a sum of money did the management agree to let him fish. Several hours had already passed and the fish still hadn\u2019t taken the bait.\n He said, \u201cI suspect there\u2019s no fish in here. The money is wasted.\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t bother with the hook anymore. He picked up his cell phone and said,\u201d I\u2019ll transfer some money to Li Li so that he can buy cakes to eat.\u201d\n Han Zhan opened WeChat and transferred 10,000 yuan to Li Li. \u201cAlright, I transferred 10,000 yuan to him.\u201d\n Song Ci widened her eyes. \u201cSo much\u201d Song Ci was stunned. She hugged Han Zhan\u2019s arm and asked him, \u201cBrother Han, on my birthday next year, can you transfer some money to me so that I can buy cake?\u201d\n \u201cLook at you!\u201d Han Zhan tapped Song Ci\u2019s forehead and said, \u201cEven if you want the tallest building in Wangdong City, I can buy it for you to rent out, not to mention cakes.\u201d\n Song Ci loved the way Han Zhan doted on her. \u201cI love being a landlady.\u201d\n Song Ci picked up Han Zhan\u2019s cell phone and saw that Li Li still hadn\u2019t accepted the money. She cupped her chin and said, \u201cIt\u2019s only 10pm in the country now. CEO Li shouldn\u2019t be sleeping yet, right? Why didn\u2019t he accept your money? Did he feel that it was too much and didn\u2019t dare to accept it?\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s a greedy person and wouldn\u2019t mind that it\u2019s too much.\u201d Changing the topic, Han Zhan said, \u201cYou said that Su Beibei went to celebrate his birthday with him?\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u2018Han Zhan gave a profound smile and said, \u201cIf you want to sleep, when can you not? He\u2019s busy, you should lie down for a while more.\u201d\n Han Zhan had guessed correctly. At this point, Li Li and Su Bei were in the tent experiencing the joy of being adults. The tent was slightly small and appeared squeezy, but it didn\u2019t hinder the passion between the couple.\n \u2013\n Su Beibei was wearing Li Li\u2019s shirt. She was kneeling at the entrance of the tent, smoking. The breeze blew away the heat on her face. Li Li was lying beside her, his arms flat against his chest, his chin resting on his arm.\n He looked up at Su Bei smoking. The red glow on her face flickered. It was a dangerous and mesmerizing sight.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

It\u2019s not good for your health.\u201d\n Li Li had wanted to tell Su Beibei this the first time they met.\n Upon hearing this, Su Beibei said something that every old smoker would say, \u201cI will quit smoking tomorrow.\u201d When she said this, her tone was like a jerk promising to never cheat again.\n Li Li said, \u201cI think the possibility of that happening is very low.\u201d\n Su Beibei put out her cigarette and pressed it into the dirt. Only when she saw that it was completely extinguished did she open the box of sweets and throw it into her mouth to chew.\n ]\u201dI am really quitting smoking,\u201d she said again.\n Li Li didn\u2019t ruin her confidence this time. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d Li Li pulled Su Beibei down and covered her eyes.\n Su Beibei remained silent and pretended to sleep with him.\n After a while, Li Li took his hand away from Su Beibei\u2019s eyes.

She opened WeChat and read the private detective\u2019s message that afternoon.\n \u2014 Li Li was born in 1991 in Wangdong City. Father Li Yao died in March of 2006. Cause of death: As he hit and killed someone in a car accident, he committed suicide by jumping off a building. Mother Shu Yunmin, a normal fish vendor...\n Note: After investigation, we found that the couple that Li Yao killed was the employer\u2019s parents.]\n When she saw this message this afternoon, Su Beibei was stunned.\n She never expected Li Li to be that young man.\n ...\n It was early spring in 2006 and it was drizzling. The 9-year-old Su Beibei was still sleeping soundly when her grandmother rudely woke her up.\n Su Beibei opened her eyes and met her grandmother\u2019s bloodshot eyes. She was stunned. \u201cGrandma, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Grandma wiped her eyes and placed a winter jacket beside Su Beibei. She said, \u201cBeibei, put on this jacket. Grandma will bring you to meet your father and mother one last time.\u201d\n Su Beibei realized that something bad had happened.\n Her grandma shoved her into a cab and headed straight for the Imperial Dragon Bridge. Along the way, Grandma kept wiping her tears, her shoulders shaking uncontrollably. Su Beibei was so scared that she didn\u2019t dare to cry.\n She arrived at the Great Dragon Bridge and saw a group of uniformed police officers as well as a rescue team responsible for salvaging the bodies.\n A policewoman brought Su Beibei and her grandmother to their bodies, which were covered by two pieces of white cloth. When the remains were uncovered and she saw her son and daughter-in-law, her grandmother cried as she collapsed to the ground, wailing for her son and daughter-in-law.\n Su Beibei was momentarily stunned.\n Of course she knew what death was. She just didn\u2019t expect to see her parents dead. After a few seconds of stunned silence, she snapped out of her trance and started screaming.\n After some time, a handsome young man appeared in front of Su Beibei. He looked like he had been crying and his eyes were very red and swollen. His hands were trembling as he held a card.\n The people around them were pointing fingers at them. Su Beibei heard someone say,\n \u201cLook, that\u2019s the culprit\u2019s son. I heard that the murderer committed suicide by jumping off a building.\u201d\n \u201cAiyo, it\u2019s really a sin. He knocked into someone and jumped off the building, leaving his wife and son behind... what a coward!\u201d\n Su Beibei looked up at the youth with hatred in her eyes.\n The young man knelt down in front of Su Beibei.\n He knelt down and kowtowed hard in front of Su Beibei, apologizing as he did so.\n Su Beibei glared at him with hatred and remained silent.\n \u201cI am sorry. My father caused your parents\u2019 death and caused you to lose your family. I am sorry. I will apologize on behalf of my father!\u201d\n ]The young man raised his trembling hands and handed a bank card to Su Beibei. Tears streamed down his face as he gazed at Su Beibei\u2019s childish face. He said tearfully, \u201cThis is all of our savings. It\u2019s a total of 130,000 yuan. I\u2019ll give it all to you. Mother and I have decided to sell the house. We will also compensate you with the money from selling the house.\u201d\n \u201cLittle girl, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\n Su Beibei suddenly shoved the youngster hard.\n The young man fell backwards, his head hitting the ground. He grunted and didn\u2019t get up. Su Beibei pounced on him, grabbing and biting him as she shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t want your money. I just want my parents. I don\u2019t want your money. I just want my parents to live!\u201d\n \u201cReturn my parents to me!\u201d\n The young man laid on the ground and cried to her. \u201cI am sorry, I cannot return them to you...\u201d\n As if waking up from a dream, Su Beibei understood everything. My parents are really dead. They will never open their eyes again.\n \u201cI will never forgive you.\u201d Su Beibei shot the young man a hateful look before running off in tears.\n In the end, her grandmother still accepted the other party\u2019s compensation. A few days later, Su Beibei heard that the young man and his mother had sold their house. As the house was a murder house, the selling price was very low. The money from selling the house was also repaid to Su Beibei. From then on, the young man and his mother became homeless and nobody knew of their whereabouts.\n After her parents were buried, Su Beibei and her grandmother tidied up the house. She planned to follow her grandmother back to the county city to study. As they packed up, she and her grandmother discovered their father\u2019s notebook when he was alive.\n That notebook contained Mu Mian\u2019s earth-shattering secrets. Grandma vaguely guessed that the death of her son and daughter-in-law wasn\u2019t an accident. She took that diary and wanted to go to the police station to report Mu Mian.\n On the way to the police station, Grandma Su got into an accident and her notebook was stolen. Grandma Su was sent to the hospital but she never woke up.\n In just a month, Su Beibei had lost all her family members. She had gone silent and turned mute for a while. At this point, Mu Mian appeared. Using the excuse of taking care of his friend\u2019s daughter, he sent Su Beibei overseas to study.\n The 10-year-old Su Beibei had left her motherland. She had been living alone in England at a young age with only a nanny.\n Su Beibei had not had an easy time in the past few years with her isolation, language barrier, and being alone.\n In the first few years of her arrival in England, Mu Mian would still transfer money to her. Over time, when everyone else started to forget about Su Beibei, Mu Mian also forgot about her.\n Su Beibei had grown up in England thanks to the money that the young man had compensated her. At the age of 20, Su Beibei had secretly returned to the country and started to investigate Mu Mian in the dark. As the investigation progressed, Su Beibei came into contact with many shocking things.\n Using her connections, she saw the autopsy report of her parents after their accident. She discovered that there was a drug in their bodies.\n In other words, her parents were most likely unconscious during the accident!\n An unmanned car driving on the road would definitely be in trouble!\n Su Beibei realized that her parents\u2019 deaths were not the fault of the drunk driver but a scheme set up by Mu Mian! The drunk driver who had killed his parents was the greatest scapegoat!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

That handsome and proud young man\u2014had he grown up to be an outstanding man? Or had he been led astray by his life and dropped out of school early?\n Meeting the 29 year old Li Li again, Su Beibei could not recognize him anymore.\n The 29-year-old Li Li had grown up as if he had been reborn. He no longer had the bearing of a youth. He had suffered the most and underwent the greatest grievances, but the hardships of life didn\u2019t break his pride.\n He was like a bamboo shoot that broke through the earth and grew into a towering bamboo.\n Su Beibei couldn\u2019t resist reaching out to stroke Li Li\u2019s brows.

There were only about 10 days left until the wedding date and Song Ci was also very busy.\n Her wedding gown and evening dress had been altered. Song Ci found a time to go to the shop and finalized the makeup and style for her wedding day.\n The next day, Song Ci sent the wedding invitation to her close friends and family. At night, Song Ci sat on a chair in the dining room. She rested her chin on her hand and stared at the purple wedding invitation in a daze.\n As if she had finally made up her mind, Song Ci stood up, picked up the invitation card, and went upstairs. She stuffed it into her bag, took a shower, and went to bed early.\n Han Zhan returned after midnight. Seeing that Song Ci had fallen asleep, he didn\u2019t even take a shower and just laid down beside her to sleep.\n The next morning, Song Ci woke up amidst Han Zhan\u2019s shower sounds. She sat up, stared at Han Zhan in the bathroom, and openly peeked at him. Han Zhan finished washing up very quickly, walked out with a towel wrapped around his waist, and explained to her, \u201cI was afraid of waking you up yesterday night, so I didn\u2019t shower.\u201d\n Han Zhan took off his towel and put on his pants. \u201cI\u2019ve accumulated a lot of work and won\u2019t be having breakfast with you. Remember to eat on time.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Brother Han.\u201d\n Song Ci kissed Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan put on his shirt and vest. He suddenly said, \u201cThe temperature will drop drastically next month.\u201d\n Song Ci replied, \u201cYup.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to wear a sweater.\u201d He still couldn\u2019t forget Song Ci\u2019s handmade sweater.\n Song Ci smiled helplessly. \u201cI have to personally oversee the wedding these few days and am rather busy. After the wedding, I will knit a few sweaters for you, alright?\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Han Zhan got an early-morning kiss and went to work.\n Song Ci made herself a healthy green breakfast. After selecting a suitable outfit, she went out at 9am sharp.\n ...\n his was a spacious piano room located on the top floor. The piano room was surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows, and the gradually changing transparent gauze curtains fluttered in the wind. The piano room was very spacious and empty. There was only a simple triangular piano and an antique zither.\n Under the morning sun, in front of the French window on the north side of the city, a barefooted man in a pure white robe stood by the window. His slightly long black hair was pinned to his head by a black jade hairpin. His face was round and smooth, like jade, warm and beautiful.\n On closer look, one could see the faint traces left behind by the passage of time on this person\u2019s face. But that elegant and leisurely manner of his had dulled the ruthlessness of time.\n His left hand was holding a violin, and his fair right hand was holding a bow with the word \u201cBei\u201d engraved on it. The melodious sound of the violin cleansed one\u2019s soul.\n Birds chirped on the big trees outside the window.\n The sound of the violin, the wind, and the chirping of birds were all gathered together. It was the most joyous sound of nature.\n Song Ci sat in the car and looked up at the man standing by the window, her eyes slightly warm. \u201cTeacher...\u201d\n After the practice ended, Shen Yubei kept his violin and walked out of the piano room barefooted. He went downstairs and heard the butler say, \u201cMr. Shen, did you invite a friend over today?\u201d\n Shen Yubei took the coffee from the butler and walked towards the courtyard. As he walked, he said, \u201cNo. Why? Did someone call you?\u201d As the world\u2019s most famous violinist and famous musician, there was always a group of people who wanted to visit Shen Yubei.\n If one could gain Shen Yubei\u2019s favor and send their own child to be his student, it would be like smoke rising from the grave of his ancestors.\n The butler replied, \u201cNo, but I saw a car parked at the entrance and thought it was a friend of yours. That\u2019s why I asked.\u201d\n Hearing this, Shen Yubei suddenly changed his direction and walked out of the main door with his coffee. He passed through the small courtyard and arrived at the main entrance. Indeed, there was a car parked at the entrance.\n It was an Aoyu Number 1 smart electric car. Shen Yubei had also bought one, but it would only be delivered next week.\n Shen Yubei went near the car and said to the person inside, \u201cFriend.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s back tensed up at the sound of Shen Yubei\u2019s voice. She gripped the steering wheel tightly, not knowing what to do. Shen Yubei walked to the driver\u2019s seat and bent over slightly to look inside the car. \u201cThis is a private residence. You can\u2019t park the car...\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly looked up at Shen Yubei with a red face. \u201cTeacher...\u201d She called out softly.\n Seeing Song Ci\u2019s face, Shen Yubei suddenly fell silent.\n He took a deep look at Song Ci, suddenly straightened his back, and said expressionlessly, \u201cMiss, this is a private residence. Please move the car away.\u201d\n At this moment, the butler walked over. \u201cMr. Shen, what happened?\u201d\n Holding the cup of coffee, Shen Yubei turned to the butler. \u201cGet this lady to move the car away. This is not a parking lot.\u201d With that, he carried the coffee back into the house.\n The butler bent over and was about to ask Song Ci to move away when he looked down and saw Song Ci\u2019s face. The butler was stunned.\n \u201cYou are... Song Ci?\u201d Although it had been many years since they last met and Song Ci looked slightly different from her teenage years, Song Ci\u2019s name was very well-known in Wangdong City and the butler knew her.\n The butler knew very well how important Song Ci was to Mr. Shen. Mr. Shen loved Song Ci very much and he had been monitoring her condition all these years. He definitely hoped that she would come back to look for him.\n It was just that Mr. Shen was too prideful to admit his feelings for Song Ci.\n After all, Mr. Shen was utterly disappointed that Song Ci had taken the initiative to give up the violin.\n Song Ci greeted the butler. \u201cUncle Liang.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s really Song Lass!\u201d Housekeeper Liang turned to look at that white figure in the courtyard. He frowned awkwardly and said to Song Ci, \u201cSong Lass, your teacher is in a fit of anger. Look...\u201d\n \u201cUncle Liang, don\u2019t worry. I will handle this myself.\u201d Song Ci pushed open the car door, took her bag, and walked towards the main door.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Hearing footsteps, Shen Yubei asked Butler Liang without turning back, \u201cShe left?\u201d\n Housekeeper Liang said, \u201cSong lass is not leaving.\u201d\n Shen Yubei heaved an unnoticeable sigh of relief, but said, \u201cDoes she want to stick here and not leave?\u201d\n \u201cTeacher.\u201d Hearing Song Ci\u2019s voice, Shen Yubei turned to look at the main door.\n Song Ci was standing at the door in a long-sleeved shirt and long pants, holding a bag in her hand. She was gazing at Shen Yubei fearfully. Her timid manner made Shen Yubei frown.\n Shen Yubei spoke up, her tone cold. \u201cMs. Song, your relationship with me as teacher-mentor has already been severed eight years ago. I cannot bear the responsibility of being your teacher.\u201d\n Eight years ago, after Song Ci buried her parents, Shen Yubei went to look for her. That day, Song Ci told him that she had lost the violin in the earthquake and her family had also died in the earthquake. She would never be able to draw the bow again in this life.\n Shen Yubei\u2019s heart ached for her and he expressed his willingness to accompany her to see a psychiatrist. He just hoped that she wouldn\u2019t give up.\n But the despondent Song Ci rejected his suggestion. She said to Shen Yubei openly, \u201cTeacher, I won\u2019t play the violin anymore. I won\u2019t be your student either. I am no longer qualified.\u201d\n Shen Yubei had remembered these words for eight years.\n Song Ci saw the coldness in Shen Yubei\u2019s eyes and felt uneasy and remorseful. She lowered her head deeply and said in a low voice, \u201cTeacher, student Song Ci is here to apologize.\u201d\n Gazing at the gorgeous beauty, Shen Yubei said, \u201cNumber one socialiate Song Ci, peerlessly beautiful...\u201d With that, he sneered and asked Song Ci,\u201d Why, are you tired of being the number one socialite and want to play the violin again? \u201d\n Shen Yubei\u2019s mockery was enough to put Song Ci in an awkward position. He looked at Song Ci, wanting to see her reaction. Shen Yubei thought that Song Ci would fly into a rage out of humiliation and scold him. He thought that Song Ci would turn around and leave in a huff.\n But Song Ci knelt down.\n She knelt at the main door, straightened her spine, and said in a clear voice, \u201cTeacher, student Song Ci is here to seek forgiveness. Please forgive my young and ignorant actions!\u201d\n Shen Yubei was stunned.\n Song Ci was a proud girl. In the past, she would never kneel even if her mother scolded or hit her.\n Housekeeper Liang was shocked. He whispered to Shen Yubei. \u201cMr. Shen, that Song girl is already an adult. If she kneels at the door and anyone sees her, they will definitely mock her...\u201d\n Shen Yubei pretended not to hear it.\n \u201cKneel if you want to. You can\u2019t just kneel forever!\u201d Shen Yubei flicked his sleeves and left. He entered the building and poured himself another cup of coffee.\n Butler Liang saw that Shen Yubei was cold-hearted and felt very helpless. He walked to the main door and advised Song Ci. \u201cSong Ci, get up. It won\u2019t be too late for you to come another day when Mr. Shen has calmed down.\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head stubbornly. \u201cNo, I still have hope if Teacher doesn\u2019t chase me away.\u201d If Shen Yubei\u2019s heart was really as cold as iron, she would just chase her away and not just let her kneel.\n Seeing that he couldn\u2019t persuade Song Ci, Butler Liang sighed and returned to the house.\n This was a private residence and there were no residents around. Song Ci knelt at the entrance of the Shen Family residence for more than an hour but no one saw her. Shen Yubei finished his coffee and started a movie.\n He was very focused and didn\u2019t look sideways, but his posture kept changing. Butler Liang knew how distracted Shen Yubei was.\n The sun was rising higher and higher in Wangdong City. It was still very hot in October. Shen Yubei had already taken off his long-sleeved shirt and was only wearing a white shirt. Meanwhile, outside the door, Song Ci, who was being roasted by the sun, was already suffering from heatstroke.\n Butler Liang said, \u201cLittle Song is afraid of heat. If she gets heatstroke, you will be hurt, Mr. Shen.\u201d\n Shen Yubei smirked. \u201cI don\u2019t care what she does. She\u2019s not anyone to me.\u201d\n Butler Liang thought to himself: If she really isn\u2019t anyone to you, why are you so restless?\n \u2013\n Han Zhan had been very busy recently. He planned to merge all his assets by May next year to establish Zeus Corporation.\n In order to consolidate the merger of the companies, the managers of several companies would gather every few days for a meeting to discuss. Han Zhan sat at the top and listened to his trusted subordinates discuss the merger of the companies.\n Everyone wanted to show their most outstanding side to Han Zhan. Once Zeus Corporation was established, there were still several high and mighty positions that were vacant. Everyone wanted to take a seat.\n Han Zhan was very satisfied to see his trusted aides full of passion for work.\n At this moment, his cell phone screen lit up. Han Zhan glanced at it and saw that it was a message from Song Ci\u2019s new bodyguard. He opened his WeChat.\n Ah Song: Mr. Han, Madam has been kneeling in front of Mr. Shen Yubei\u2019s house for more than an hour.\n Han Zhan frowned.\n He tilted his head and gazed at the blazing sun outside the window, feeling somewhat distressed.\n Seeing that Mr. Han suddenly frowned and looked out of the window, the subordinates tacitly shut up. Li Li asked Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly asked, \u201cHow high is the temperature outside today?\u201d\n Bei Zhan said, \u201cThe highest temperature is 31 degrees Celsius, while the lowest is 24 degrees Celsius.\u201d Autumn days had already passed and the temperature had already dropped significantly, but it was still hot.\n It was nearly noon and the temperature outside was approaching 30 degrees Celsius. Song Ci had been kneeling in the sun for more than an hour. How much longer could she last?\n Han Zhan really wanted to run over to the Shen Family and take his wife away, but he couldn\u2019t do that.\n If Song Ci did something wrong, she had to apologize to Shen Yubei.\n Han Zhan had heard of Shen Yubei\u2019s character. He was very arrogant and cold. Many wealthy and powerful people wanted to have their children become his students, but they were all rejected on the spot.\n Shen Yubei was stubborn. If he didn\u2019t vent his anger and sincerely acknowledged Song Ci, she would never be forgiven by him.\n Han Zhan forced himself to be more ruthless.\n He picked up his cell phone and replied to Ah Song: [Prepare heat-dispelling medicine and soup. If Madam faints, send her to the hospital immediately.] After replying, Han Zhan put down his cell phone and looked up at Li Li and the rest. \u201cContinue.\u201d\n The meeting continued, but Han Zhan\u2019s heart was in turmoil.\n \u2013\n \u201cMr. Shen, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\n Shen Yubei turned off the projector, got up, walked to the dining room, sat down alone, and elegantly ate his lunch.\n After lunch, he went upstairs to practice his violin.\n He had just gone up the stairs when Housekeeper Liang reminded him. \u201cMr. Shen, it has already been more than three hours and that little Song is still kneeling!\u201d\n Shen Yubei turned to look at the clock on the wall. In the end, he still went upstairs.\n Butler Liang was shocked.\n Is Mr. Shen determined not to forgive Song?\n Butler Liang arrived at the main door and saw that Song Ci was still kneeling there. Her face was covered in sweat and her long-sleeved shirt was drenched. His heart ached slightly. \u201cSong Ci, you should get up. I think Mr. Shen will ignore you today.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s lips were dry.\n She suddenly heard the sound of a piano. She looked up at the piano room on the rooftop and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I can still persevere.\u201d\n If I gave up so easily, I\u2019m not Song Ci.\n \u201cYou\u2019re all stubborn!\u201d Housekeeper Liang stomped his feet and had no choice but to return to his room.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "170": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-171\n\n Chapter 170: Don\u2019t Be Proud because You\u2019re Doted On  At 1pm, the sun shone brightly on the ground. Song Ci felt dizzy and couldn\u2019t quite hold on. Her body swayed and just when she was about to fall, she suddenly held on.\n She straightened her back.\n Shen Yubei stood on the top floor and looked down. As he witnessed this scene, he couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for her. He suddenly turned and walked to the center of the piano room, picked up his violin, and walked out.\n Song Ci\u2019s vision started to blur. She felt dizzy and dizzy. Just then, a shadow covered her body and a pair of white leather shoes appeared in her vision.\n Song Ci blinked. After confirming that she was not hallucinating, she slowly looked up at Shen Yubei. Opening her dry lips, Song Ci called out hoarsely, \u201cTeacher.\u201d\n Sweat dripped from Song Ci\u2019s eyelids. Her fair cheeks were red.\n Shen Yubei handed the violin and bow to Song Ci.\n Song Ci looked at him in confusion.\n hen Yubei said, \u201cUse your violin skills to prove to me whether you are qualified to be my disciple!\u201d Eight years ago, they had truly broken off their relationship as teachers and students. Shen Yubei would never let Song Ci in using underhand methods. He wanted a musical genius, not a pretty, delicate vase.\n If Song Ci wanted to be his disciple, she had to show her true capabilities!\n Song Ci\u2019s legs were numb and she couldn\u2019t stand up. She knelt down and raised both hands to catch Shen Yubei\u2019s violin. Lowering her head, Song Ci gazed tenderly at it and couldn\u2019t resist stroking it.\n \u201cWe meet again, Fighting Soul.\u201d\n Shen Yubei\u2019s violin was called \u201cFighting Soul.\u201d\n It was the dream of many musicians to own a famous violin that belonged to them. But Shen Yubei was not obsessed with an antique violin. His violin was made by his grandfather in Cremona, Italy.\n His grandfather was a violinist and Fighting Soul was Grandpa Shen\u2019s last piece of work. He gave it to Shen Yubei. This violin had accompanied Shen Yubei for 25 years. Fighting Soul was his soul.\n The fighting soul completed Shen Yubei, and so did he.\n Nowadays, when music enthusiasts talked about the world famous violinist and violin, who wouldn\u2019t mention the name \u201cFighting Soul\u201d?\n Shen Yubei\u2019s greatest taboo was his violin Fighting Soul. In this world, the number of people who had the right to touch Fighting Soul could be counted with one hand.\n Song Ci cradled the soul, her lashes fluttering. Song Ci knew this was her last chance. She had to grasp it. \u201c...Okay teacher.\u201d\n If I can\u2019t stand up, I\u2019ll kneel down and play it!\n Song Ci held the violin with her left hand and the bow with her right. Once she touched the violin, Song Ci would enter a trance-like state. She pulled the strings and the mournful sound of the violin could be heard.\n One of them was kneeling while the other was standing, but their souls were communicating.\n Shen Yubei felt as if his bones were trembling along with the music, when he heard the sobbing sound of the violin.\n This is what I want to hear!\n Song Ci was even more talented than Shen Yubei in terms of the violin. With the same violin and the same tune, the feeling produced by Song Ci was totally different from others.\n Song Ci\u2019s music always captured all of Shen Yubei\u2019s senses and emotions.\n After Song Ci finished her performance, Shen Yubei also opened his eyes. Shen Yubei looked at Song Ci with withered lips. \u201cThis is your work? What is its name?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cZhan.\u201d\n \u201cZhan...\u201d Shen Yubei finally revealed his first smile since seeing Song Ci.\u201d Not bad. \u201d\n Song Ci hugged her teacher\u2019s violin and asked him, \u201cTeacher, are you still willing to accept me as your student?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s eyes were filled with expectations and stubbornness.\n Shen Yubei\u2019s deep gaze met Song Ci\u2019s stubborn one. For a moment, he didn\u2019t speak. Song Ci was anxious but didn\u2019t dare to make any more noise. After a long while, Shen Yubei spoke to Butler Liang behind her. \u201cHelp Song Ci into the house. She hasn\u2019t eaten yet.\u201d\n Overjoyed, Song Ci finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and collapsed to the ground. As she fell, she held Shen Yubei\u2019s Fighting Soul in her arms and didn\u2019t dare to break it.\n \u201cLittle Song!\u201d Housekeeper Liang was shocked.\n Hearing the commotion, Shen Yubei hurriedly turned around, knelt down, and carried Song Ci. Shen Yubei carried Song Ci and sprinted into the house. As he ran, he shouted, \u201cBring me the heat-dispelling soup!\u201d\n He knew that Butler Liang must have prepared some heat-dispelling soup.\n Butler Liang rushed into the kitchen and brought over a bowl of hot soup for Song Ci. She laid flat on the sofa, and felt slightly more awake, after drinking the soup.\n Having not been to the teacher\u2019s house for eight years, Song Ci discovered that the interior of the teacher\u2019s house had been changed to wood forest style. The wooden sofa and dining table seemed to have returned to the embrace of nature\u2019s mother.\n Song Ci drank another bowl of hot soup and came to her senses.\n Shen Yubei sat on a recliner for his afternoon nap. Music was playing in the room. Song Ci could tell it was Huo Zun\u2019s \u201cPink Ink.\u201d\n Song Ci listened carefully before standing up. She retrieved the wedding invitation from her bag and walked hesitantly toward Shen Yubei. Shen Yubei heard the commotion and opened his eyes to stare at Song Ci calmly.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Song Ci passed the invitation card that was hidden behind her waist to Shen Yubei. Shen Yubei\u2019s eyes finally changed as she stared at the words \u201cThe wedding invitation is for Teacher Shen to accept\u201d.\n He took the invitation and suddenly said, \u201cYou\u2019re only 22 years old.\u201d\n He was implying that she had gotten married too early.\n Song Ci glanced at Shen Yubei and said in a small voice, \u201cIt\u2019s not early to get married at 20 even if you meet the right person. It\u2019s also a waste to get married at 30 if you meet the wrong person.\u201d\n Shen Yubei mulled over her words carefully before saying, \u201cWhat you said makes sense.\u201d Patting the invitation card, Shen Yubei said in a self-depreciating manner, \u201cI\u2019m your teacher, but you got married even before I did.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci was very happy. \u201cTeacher, are you willing to acknowledge me as your student?\u201d\n Shen Yubei looked at Song Ci calmly and said, \u201cSong Ci, I will make an exception for you once. I will never make an exception a second time.\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly said, \u201cI will never give up the violin again, Teacher.\u201d\n \u201cHeh...\u201d Shen Yubei placed the invitation card on the tree stump coffee table. He waved.\u201d You can go first. I will come to the wedding. \u201cIt is the most important day of her life. How can I not attend?\n Song Ci turned to get her bag when Shen Yubei suddenly asked, \u201cHave you completely recovered from your habit of not playing the violin?\u201d\n Song Ci paused and acknowledged softly.\n As soon as Song Ci walked out of the Shen Family, she was hugged by a pair of strong, muscular arms.\n Song Ci was shocked that her body was suddenly in the air. She looked up and saw that it was Han Zhan. She relaxed and laid in his arms. \u201cBrother Han, why are you here?\u201d\n \u201cAh Song said you fainted. I was worried and came over to take a look.\u201d Han Zhan was truly worried about Song Ci. He had taken the time out of his busy schedule to visit her.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart warmed. She huddled in Han Zhan\u2019s arms and told him, \u201cBrother Han, I\u2019m so happy.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked her, \u201cYou guys made up?\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Teacher is still soft-hearted toward me.\u201d\n Placing Song Ci in the car, Han Zhan said, \u201cThere are many people who are soft-hearted toward you, but don\u2019t be arrogant just because you are pampered.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

I still have to go to the office and will come back earlier tonight to accompany you.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded obediently and watched as Han Zhan boarded his Volvo and left. Only then did Ah Song send her home.\n After they left, Housekeeper Liang walked up to Shen Yubei, bent over, and said, \u201cThe Song girl left. Han Zhan personally came to fetch her.\u201d\n Shen Yubei had been secretly observing Song Ci\u2019s life and knew that the man she married was called Han Zhan. Han Zhan\u2019s face flashed across Shen Yubei\u2019s mind and he felt that it was somewhat familiar.\n He suddenly said, \u201cGive me my phone.\u201d\n Butler Liang found Shen Yubei\u2019s cell phone and handed it to him. Shen Yubei found the singer\u2019s number in the contact list and called her.\n Di Rongrong answered the call and said, \u201cWhy did Mr. Shen bear to contact me today?\u201d Shen Yubei was a person who didn\u2019t like to make calls.\n \u201cMadam Di.\u201d Shen Yubei asked straightforwardly, \u201cYou have a godson called Han Zhan, right?\u201d\n The other party was silent for a moment before asking, \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d\n \u201cSeems like it\u2019s true.\u201d Three years ago, at Di Rongrong\u2019s concert, Shen Yubei had been invited to perform and had met Han Zhan once. As a result, when Butler Liang mentioned Han Zhan just now, Shen Yubei felt that he was somewhat familiar.\n Shen Yubei said, \u201cMy only disciple is getting married and the groom is called Han Zhan. I remember that this is the name of your godson, so I\u2019m asking about him.\u201d\n Hearing this, Di Rongrong asked, \u201cIs Song Ci your disciple?\u201d\n Shen Yubei replied, \u201cMmm, she has been my disciple for 18 years... my only disciple.\u201d Song Ci had already become Shen Yubei\u2019s disciple when she was 4 years old, and Shen Yubei treated her as his daughter.\n \u201cOh, so my god daughter-in-law is a talented girl!\u201d After knowing about Song Ci and Shen Yubei\u2019s relationship, Di Rongrong liked Song Ci even more.\n Isn\u2019t Shen Yubei\u2019s disciple a genius?\n Naturally, Shen Yubei could hear the joy and satisfaction in Di Rongrong\u2019s voice. He felt very proud and couldn\u2019t resist boasting. \u201cMy disciple is a musical genius. She is beautiful and sensible. Your godson is lucky to have married her.\u201d\n Di Rongrong didn\u2019t like hearing this. In her eyes, her godson Han Zhan was not bad at all. It was a cause for celebration to be able to marry the person you loved. But if one said that Han Zhan was lucky to be able to marry Song Ci, Di Rongrong would not be happy.\n Song Ci was very outstanding, but so is my godson.\n Not to be outdone, Di Rongrong decided to fight for Han Zhan. She said, \u201cMy godson was once an elite soldier!\u201d Her tone was full of pride.\n Shen Yubei said, \u201cYou also said that it was in the past...\u201d\n Di Rongrong was like a dolphin whose belly had been punctured. She was very angry. But she quickly regained her senses and said, \u201cMy godson is 1.89 meters tall and very handsome. He is also very talented.\u201d\n Shen Yubei added gently, \u201cA pity that he is handicapped.\u201d\n Di Rongrong was even angrier now! Her face darkened as she scolded him. \u201cThe one with the last name Shen, you can\u2019t bear a grudge just because I rejected your confession back then and chose Huo Jing-an.\u201d\n \u201cThat year, it was my fault for being blind and treating fish eyes like pearls. I\u2019m hanging up!\u201d As if he was sick of talking to her, Shen Yubei hung up.\n Di Rongrong stomped her feet in anger. \u201cThis Shen Yubei is so petty!\u201d She took the wedding invitation from the table and knocked on it. \u201cI will seduce you to death by dressing up beautifully that day!\u201d\n Placing the invitation card on the table, Di Rongrong had an arrogant look on her face as she came up with an idea.\n \u2013\n That afternoon, the bridal shop sent someone to deliver the bridesmaid\u2019s gown to Mu Qiu\u2019s house. Mu Qiu was on her afternoon nap when they arrived and Du Tingting had helped her sign the receipt.\n After Mu Qiu woke up, Du Tingting brought the clothes into Mu Qiu\u2019s room and said, \u201cYour elder sister got someone to bring the bridesmaid dress over. Try it on.\u201d\n Mu Qiu said listlessly, \u201cI tried it before. It fits.\u201d\n \u201cI want to see it.\u201d\n Mu Qiu had no choice but to take off her pyjamas and put on her bridesmaid dress.\n It was an ice-blue strapless shoulder-length gown. In order to facilitate movement, the gown reached just below her calves. Song Ci also sent over a pair of pure white high heels with a ring of pure white pearls around her ankles. This pair of shoes was a branded pair that was priced at over 7,000 yuan.\n Mu Qiu had changed into shoes and a dress. She stood in front of Du Tingting with her long hair draped over her shoulders. She was tall and slender, with a graceful posture. Her palm-sized face was accentuated by her elegant outfit.\n Du Tingting stared at Mu Qiu in a daze. She suddenly said, \u201cYou will definitely look even more beautiful in a wedding gown.\u201d With that, Du Tingting saw Mu Qiu\u2019s smile fade and realized just how cruel her words were.\n Du Tingting bit her lower lip in frustration.\n Mu Qiu looked at the mirror. She stared at the slender, elegant lady in the mirror, unable to conceal her loneliness. Mu Qiu suddenly smiled and said to Du Tingting, \u201cMother, will you accompany me to take my wedding photo?\u201d\n Du Tingting was stunned. \u201cWedding photo?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Mu Qiu turned in a circle, as a yearning look appeared on her face. She said, \u201cI want to take a photo of me in a wedding dress. If Mother wants to see it in the future, you can look at it.\u201d\n Du Tingting nodded with reddened eyes.\n That night, Du Tingting went on WeChat to ask her friends which bridal shop had the best wedding photos. Everyone thought she was looking for a wedding photo studio for her adopted daughter Song Ci and recommended several.\n The next morning, Du Tingting chose a few reputable bridal boutiques to visit personally. In the end, she chose a wedding photo studio called One-Life., One Love\n Du Tingting explained the reason to the boss, who expressed his willingness to let Mu Qiu cut the queue and take the photo first.\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t have Song Ci\u2019s voluptuous figure. Instead, she chose two princess-style, shoulder-length wedding gowns.\n After putting on the wedding gown, Mu Qiu got Du Tingting to help her take two photos. She casually edited the photo and posted it on her social media.\n On this day, Song Ci was selecting a rose from the flower market. She had already selected the rose type and contacted the designer of the wedding venue, before boarding the car home.\n In the car, she opened her social media page and saw that Mu Qiu had posted a status an hour ago.\n Mu Qiu wrote: [I put on a wedding gown for myself. Mu Qiu, you are really beautiful.] Under the caption column were three live wedding photos.\n [fuzzy]Mu Qiu\u2019s long hair was done up in a bun and draped lazily over her shoulders. She was wearing a lacy headdress and a shoulder-length wedding gown. Behind her was a long wooden fence covered in Chinese roses.\n Standing amongst the flowers, Mu Qiu was even more beautiful than them.\n Song Ci liked it and left a comment.\n At the same time, in the general manager\u2019s office at the headquarters of Chuan Dong Group, Cheng Yanmo paused all his work. He stood by the window and looked down at the girl in the white mesh dress on his cell phone with dark eyes.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

After Mu Qiu finished taking her final set of sunset wedding photos, it was finally time to end work. She carried her wedding gown and returned to the bridal shop with the staff. She was prepared to go back to change her clothes and go for dinner, before returning home to take a bath.\n Taking wedding photos was really tiring. Her face was stiff from smiling.\n Arriving at the bridal shop, Mu Qiu alighted from the car with the help of the staff. She held the hem of her gown with both hands and took two steps towards the main entrance of the shop. She suddenly stopped in her tracks when she saw someone from the corner of her eye.\n Standing at the same spot, Mu Qiu slowly turned and met Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes.\n For some reason, Mu Qiu felt flustered.\n Cheng Yanmo just looked at her from afar without any intention of approaching.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d The lady at the bridal shop asked Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu shook her head. \u201cNothing, I just met a friend.\u201d She bowed slightly to greet Cheng Yanmo before entering the bridal shop.\n Taking off her clothes and changing back into her own clothes, Mu Qiu used the makeup remover she had brought along to remove all her heavy makeup. She sprayed some moisturizing spray on her face, before carrying her bag and planning to leave.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s car was parked in the carpark of a nearby shopping mall. She walked into the mall in her flats and took the lift down to the basement carpark. Walking out of the lift, Mu Qiu felt like she was being watched.\n She instinctively reached into her bag.\n Just as she were about to reach the car, someone suddenly leaned close to her and grabbed her left arm. Mu Qiu hurriedly took out a bottle of pepper spray from her bag and sprayed it on the person behind her.\n \u201cPervert!\u201d\n Pfft...\n The pepper spray landed on Cheng Yanmo\u2019s glasses and nose bridge.\n Cheng Yanmo was silent.\n Mu Qiu was speechless.\n \u201cCough cough!\u201d\n \u201cCough cough!\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo started holding his throat and coughing.\n Mu Qiu was stunned. She hurriedly put down the pepper spray and stammered. \u201cM-master Cheng? Why is it you?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had his hand on the car door. He took off his glasses, opened his eyes, and stared at Mu Qiu in a daze. He wanted to say something but started coughing violently again.\n His face was very uncomfortable. It was hot and painful. Cheng Yanmo found it difficult to even breathe. He coughed for a while before saying weakly, \u201cMu Qiu, you...\u201d He looked like he didn\u2019t know what to say and just kept silent in the end.\n \u201cTake me to the hospital!\u201d\n Mu Qiu hurriedly drove Cheng Yanmo to the nearest hospital. The doctor treated him and he felt slightly better.\n He was slightly allergic and his face was slightly red. It was very itchy and he wanted to scratch it. Mu Qiu hurriedly pulled his arm and warned him. \u201cYou can\u2019t scratch it after applying medicine. It will get even redder if you scratch it.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had no choice but to give up.\n Mu Qiu glanced at Cheng Yanmo carefully, feeling very guilty. She asked him, \u201cAre you going to work tomorrow?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo glanced at Mu Qiu with a cold smile. \u201cThanks to you, I am resting tomorrow.\u201d Taking off his glasses, Mu Qiu realized that Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes were very cold when he looked at someone.\n She suspected that Cheng Yanmo wasn\u2019t wearing glasses because of his short-sightedness. Instead, he was pretending to be more approachable.\n Leaving the hospital, they returned to the car. Cheng Yanmo looked at his own face in the mirror and saw that it was red. He closed his eyes and leaned against the car.\n Mu Qiu asked him, \u201cWhy are you looking for me, Master Cheng?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo remained silent.\n Mu Qiu was not used to being alone with Cheng Yanmo. She was very nervous. Every time she faced Cheng Yanmo, she couldn\u2019t remain calm. After all, he was the man she liked and also her first man.\n \u201cI saw your wedding photo.\u201d Cheng Yanmo opened his eyes and turned to stare at Mu Qiu with an unreadable expression.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s heartbeat quickened.\n She pretended to be calm and asked Cheng Yanmo, \u201cOh, what do you think? Do I look good?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had long heard that the Mu Family had two outstanding daughters. Their adopted daughter, Song Ci, was a regal flower. Their youngest daughter, Mu Qiu, was lively, mischievous, and very likable.\n All the men in Wangdong City wanted to marry Song Ci. All the mothers-in-law in Wangdong City wanted their sons to marry Mu Qiu when she grew up.\n Cheng Yanmo had a taste of Song Ci, the top socialite. He admitted that Song Ci was indeed very attractive and could be considered the top debutante, but he preferred girls like Mu Qiu. She looked obedient and pure, and it was easy to get along with her.\n Mu Qiu asked again, \u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo heaved a long sigh.\n He said, \u201cI saw those photos and suddenly wanted to see you.\u201d\n \u201cMaster Cheng, don\u2019t come looking for me in the future.\u201d Mu Qiu didn\u2019t hide it from Cheng Yanmo and revealed her thoughts. \u201cI really like you, Master Cheng. I am about to lose control of my own heart.\u201d\n \u201cThe more you treat me well, the more indignant I am and the more afraid I am of death. Every time I see you, the reluctance in my heart deepens, Master Cheng. This is too cruel for a dying person.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t feel any joy or joy when he suddenly heard Mu Qiu\u2019s confession. He just felt sad.\n \u201cMu Qiu...\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo felt helpless.\n He was rich, powerful, good-looking, but he couldn\u2019t sentence someone to death or bring someone to life. This feeling of wanting to keep the other party but having to watch her die was too unbearable.\n \u201cMaster Cheng, I\u2019ll take it that you also have feelings for me.\u201d Mu Qiu smiled brightly at Cheng Yanmo. \u201cI\u2019m very honored to be able to obtain your love. But I can\u2019t continue to be entangled with you. It\u2019s too cruel for you and me.\u201d\n Mu Qiu alighted from the car and hailed a cab.\n After a long while, Cheng Yanmo called someone. \u201cWhat happened the last time I asked you to help me?\u201d\n \u201cMaster Cheng, if you lose your heart, you will lose your life. Unless you are at your wits\u2019 end, no one will be willing to make such a deal. There are very few people with RH-negative blood and even fewer people willing to donate their hearts. I am afraid I cannot help you with this.\u201d\n He had already guessed that this would be the outcome, but Cheng Yanmo still felt indignant after hearing it. But what could he do? He couldn\u2019t take the initiative to kill someone!\n \u201cAlright, I got it.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo closed his eyes and replayed Mu Qiu\u2019s stubborn smile in his mind. He suddenly regretted alighting from the car to meet Mu Qiu that night.\n \u2013\n Mu Qiu went home crying.\n Arriving at home, she locked herself in her room and cried her heart out. After that, Mu Qiu laid down and fell asleep.\n The next morning, Mu Qiu opened her eyes and took out her cell phone. She opened her browser and saw several news articles.\n There was an international news report stating that there had been another riot in Song Fei\u2019s country and many people had died. Those photos had been censored, but it was still a ghastly sight.\n After reading the news, Mu Qiu remained silent for a long time.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "173": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-174\n\n Chapter 173: The Richest Woman in Asia is Here  They had already been in Golden Sands for half a month.\n Yan Jiang realized that the situation here was not as serious as he had imagined. There were indeed riots, but not everywhere.\n After familiarizing himself with the environment here, Yan Jiang found a job as a forensic doctor. Yan Jiang studied forensics at Wangdong University and was a graduate student at Wangdong University. He had just graduated last year.\n In university, Yan Jiang was the proud student of his mentor. He had also followed his mentor to understand many murder cases. Those who were truly capable would be able to find jobs anywhere.\n Forensics was not an easy profession. There were many accidental deaths here. It was Yan Jiang\u2019s honor to be assigned a corpse on his first day of work. He was in charge of dissection and analysis.\n That day, Yan Jiang had washed his hands several times before returning home. He had quickly changed into a fresh set of clothes, before finally daring to appear before Song Fei.\n At that time, Song Fei was on the phone and didn\u2019t notice Yan Jiang approaching her. Yan Jiang heard her say, \u201cMaster Cheng? Cheng Yanmo? He\u2019s also asking about the heart? Ha... just say no. You can\u2019t help him with this.\u201d\n After Song Fei hung up, Yan Jiang asked, \u201cSong Fei, what did you do behind my back?\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s body tensed for a moment before she relaxed. She turned around and glanced at Yan Jiang. She sniffed the air and suddenly said, \u201cYou smell like a corpse.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was slightly upset. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve showered and changed my clothes. I dissected a corpse that looked like a giant today. That stench...\u201d Shaking his head, Yan Jiang asked Song Ci,\u201d You can still smell it? \u201d\n Song Fei nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not strong, but I can smell it.\u201d Hearing Yan Jiang mention giant, Song Fei asked, \u201cIs it that girl\u2019s body found in the ditch opposite? I heard she is only 9 years old.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, you heard about it too?\u201d The little girl was only nine years old and was homeless. Many people guessed that she had accidentally fallen into a small river and drowned. She was just a homeless child with no parents or power. After her body was sent to the police station, no one was willing to take charge of this case at all.\n Yan Jiang was a newbie, so the little girl case was now in his hands.\n Song Fei asked Yan Jiang, \u201cWas it suicide?\u201d\n Song Fei frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s only 9 years old.\u201d\n Yan Jiang remained silent. After a while, Yan Jiang suddenly said, \u201cSong Fei, if our child is a girl, we must make her learn kung fu.\u201d\n Song Fei glanced at him. \u201cOur child? Who wants to have a child with you?\u201d\n Yan Jiang walked over and wanted to hug her. He reached out his hand but retracted it hesitantly. Song Fei noticed his action and pursed her lips.\n \u201cI will definitely succeed in wooing you and have children with you.\u201d\n Song Fei remained silent.\n Yan Jiang asked her, \u201cWho were you talking to on the phone just now?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cA friend.\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei, are you planning something behind my back?\u201d Yan Jiang felt that Song Fei was doing something dangerous behind his back and suspected that it had something to do with Mu Qiu.\n Song Fei was not the kind of person who would swallow her pride after being bullied. She was the classic example of someone who would steal someone else\u2019s property and push the blame to someone else. After knowing what Mu Qiu and her father had done to her and her sister, Song Fei would never allow that father-daughter duo to continue to be at large.\n Song Fei glanced at him. \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei, no matter what you do, I won\u2019t stop you. I only have one request.\u201d Yan Jiang grabbed Song Fei\u2019s hand and squeezed it. \u201cI want you to be safe and sound.\u201d\n Song Fei was not used to such ambiguous situations. She drew back her hand and said, \u201cSleep early. You still have work tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n \u201cI am going to the research institute and won\u2019t be coming back tonight.\u201d Life here was dull and boring. Song Fei spent most of her time at the research institute.\n Yan Jiang suddenly broke into a smile. He approached Song Fei and lowered his head so that his nose was almost touching her forehead. Yan Jiang said, \u201cSince you haven\u2019t finished your work, why are you at home now?\u201d It would take about five to six minutes to drive from home to the research institute. \u201cAre you back to get your stuff... or are you here to see me?\u201d\n Song Fei shot Yan Jiang a cold look that sent chills down his spine. But Yan Jiang had a backbone and didn\u2019t back down. He said boldly, \u201cYou don\u2019t dare to answer me?\u201d\n Song Fei pushed Yan Jiang\u2019s head aside, picked up her bag, and walked towards the door.\n As she lowered her head to change shoes, she said without raising her head, \u201cI didn\u2019t take anything and I just came back to visit you.\u201d With that, she grabbed the door handle and was about to open the door.\n Yan Jiang suddenly shouted, \u201cSong Fei!\u201d\n Song Fei paused and waited for him to speak without turning back.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cYou are so considerate toward your brothers.\u201d\n Song Fei opened the door and slammed it shut.\n Yan Jiang shook his head and chuckled.\n \u2013\n It was finally October 25th.\n On this day, the richest woman in Asia, Mo Yao, boarded a private plane with her lover Li Yao. She appeared at Wangjiang Mountain Airport in a high-profile manner and stayed in the presidential suite of the Jetta International Hotel.\n On the same day, the national treasure singer, Di Rongrong, also finished her work overseas and hurried back to Wangdong City. At the same time, an old man carrying a leather bag boarded a high-speed train to Wangdong City with three middle-aged men.\n On this day, Wangdong City\u2019s social media account was flooded with short videos of the richest woman in Asia, Mo Yao. In the short videos, Mo Yao was sitting in a Maybach, wearing a bright red suit, and bending over to get out of the car.\n She had one hand in her pocket and took off her sunglasses with the other. She looked up and smiled at the camera. Her smile was so domineering and regal that the netizens all knelt down to greet her.\n No one knew why a big boss like Mo Yao had suddenly come to Wangdong City. Some guessed that she was going to do something big in Wangdong City, some guessed that she was here to meet friends, and some felt that she was just here for a holiday.\n \u201cHere for a wedding?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was shocked to receive this news. He asked his special assistant, \u201cWhose wedding is Moyao attending?\u201d He had never heard of anyone getting married in Wangdong City\u2019s upper-class society.\n The Special Assistant shook his head. \u201cWe haven\u2019t found out anything yet. I just heard that she is here to attend a mysterious wedding.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t know that there was someone in Wangdong City who maintained a close relationship with Mo Yao. \u201cWho is going to hold a wedding in Wangdong City recently?\u201d\n ]The executive assistant thought for a moment and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is... that\u2019s not right either. The Mu Family adopted daughter Song Ci\u2019s wedding will be held tomorrow.\u201d\n Song Ci?\n Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s wedding was set for tomorrow. Both parties only invited their most important friends and family. Although Cheng Yanmo knew them but didn\u2019t receive an invitation, he also knew that Song Ci and Han Zhan were getting married on October 26th.\n Everyone already knows Song Ci\u2019s background. But that groom...\n Han Zhan\u2019s face flashed across Cheng Yanmo\u2019s mind.\n Han Zhan...\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "174": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-175\n\n Chapter 174: Your Brother Zhanzhan  \u201cIs there anyone with the surname Han in Shunchen City?\u201d Cheng Yanmo had been to Shunchen City several times, but had never heard of anyone with the surname Han.\n The special assistant had already investigated Han Zhan. He looked down and said, \u201cI\u2019ve checked on Han Zhan. His family background is rather ordinary. His parents passed away early and he grew up with his grandfather.\u201d\n \u201cGrandpa...\u201d Cheng Yanmo asked the executive assistant,\u201d Have you checked on his grandfather? \u201d\n \u201cNo. I heard that he was an old farmer who planted crops, so I didn\u2019t check.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo felt that there was something strange going on. A farmer had groomed an unfathomable Han Zhan?\n How can that be?\n \u201cCEO Cheng, are we going back to the old residence or your residence tonight?\u201d The driver asked Cheng Yanmo.\n Thinking that Song Ci was getting married tomorrow and worried that his little brother would cause trouble due to loneliness, Cheng Yanmo suddenly changed his mind. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the old residence.\u201d\n He had to keep an eye on Cheng Ziang in case he caused trouble.\n Returning to the old residence, Cheng Yanmo alighted. Just as he was about to enter the house, he noticed that the lights in the villa at the end of the road were turned on. He called out to the butler and asked him, \u201cHas the owner of the villa returned?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had long heard that the villa was where Old General Han stayed. But Old General Han seldom came back after returning to his hometown in Shunchen.\n The butler looked at the lit villa. \u201cYes, Young Master. I think he came back this afternoon.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo asked the butler, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ziang?\u201d\n \u201cSecond Young Master is at home.\u201d\n \u201cKeep an eye on him. He is not allowed to leave the house without my permission tonight and tomorrow.\u201d With that, Cheng Yanmo took the coat from the butler\u2019s hands, put it on himself, and walked towards the villa alone.\n The villa had been built quite a few years ago. The red walls were covered in moss and surrounded by green trees. It looked simple and mysterious. As Cheng Yanmo approached the villa, he vaguely saw an old man walking along the corridor on the first level.\n Cheng Yanmo purposely made some noise.\n The old man was holding a watering can and turned to look at Cheng Yanmo. Upon seeing him, Han Aoyu thought for a moment before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re the little grandson of the Cheng Family?\u201d\n Seeing that the old man had guessed his identity, Cheng Yanmo hurriedly nodded and greeted him. \u201cGood evening, Old Master, I\u2019m Cheng Yanmo from the Cheng Family. I just got off work and saw that your house was lit up, so I came over to take a look.\u201d\n Staring at the old man\u2019s strong and healthy body, Cheng Yanmo said, \u201cOld Master still looks very healthy. I wonder if I will have the fortune to get a drink from the birthday boy on your 100th birthday?\u201d\n It was just that Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t like to speak, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t know how to speak. In front of a powerful old man, Cheng Yanmo could also turn a stone into a diamond with his words.\n Upon hearing this, Han Aoyu smiled broadly. \u201cThe last time I saw you, you were just a little kid who was good at driving toy cars. In the blink of an eye, you\u2019ve already grown up. Even your grandfather can\u2019t compare to your bootlicking skills!\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo just smiled.\n \u201cSit, why are you standing there!\u201d\n Only then did Cheng Yanmo sit down. Staring at the black pine in front of Old Master, Cheng Yanmo asked, \u201cOld Master, you brought this black pine from your hometown, right?\u201d A potted black pine that Old Master always carried wherever he went must mean a lot to him.\n Han Aoyu said, \u201cThis was planted before my wife passed away. I usually carry it with me so that I won\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n \u201cOld Master\u2019s genuine heart towards Old Madam is admirable.\u201d If he had heard these words in the past, Cheng Yanmo might have respected the other party, but he wouldn\u2019t have felt anything else. But hearing these words today, Cheng Yanmo felt slightly upset when he thought of how blissful it was to be able to grow old with the person he loved.\n How can such a young girl be so unfortunate?\n \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. You will understand when you get married in the future.\u201d Han Aoyu looked at Cheng Yanmo and thought of his own grandson Han Zhan. He couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cI also have a grandson. You might not remember that when you were young, he even used a bicycle to bring you around.\u201d\n Han Aoyu pointed at the river at the foot of the mountain. \u201cIn the past, that area was a wasteland with lots of fish and prawns. My grandson was very naughty. He placed you by the river and went fishing by himself. In the end, you fell into the ditch and nearly drowned. He saved you but didn\u2019t dare to tell us. Worried that he would be scolded, he even brought you out to the streets to buy a new set of clothes.\u201d\n \u201cIn the end, you caught a cold after returning home. You caught a fever at night and fell ill. After that, your grandfather didn\u2019t allow you to play with that hooligan grandson of mine anymore. You might not even remember this.\u201d\n It was true that Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t remember this. But when his grandfather was still alive, he told him that there was a mischievous child in that family halfway up the hill. He even said that he wondered what that fatty did when he grew up.\n Cheng Yanmo asked Han Aoyu, \u201cThen what is he doing now?\u201d\n \u201cLike you, he\u2019s doing business as well.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo wanted to get to know the young master of the Han Family. \u201cOh? I wonder what his name is. Perhaps I know him too.\u201d\n Han Aoyu had just started speaking and said, \u201cHan...\u201d when he recalled his grandson\u2019s low-profile character and stopped himself in time. \u201cAh! He\u2019s not worth mentioning. Anyway, he\u2019s not as good as you.\u201d\n Han Aoyu put down the watering can, looked at the clock, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, I need to rest. I can\u2019t delay tomorrow\u2019s important matters.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo immediately got up and bid Old Master Han farewell. \u201cGood night, Old Master Han. I won\u2019t disturb you anymore. I\u2019ll come visit another day.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I will be staying here for a longer period of time this time. Come visit my house more often when you are free. My cooking tastes pretty good. I will fry some small fish for you!\u201d The farm work at home was already done and they were just waiting for the potatoes to be planted in December. Since there was nothing to do back home, Han Aoyu decided to stay here for a few months.\n Cheng Yanmo expressed that he looked forward to it.\n After he left, Han Aoyu told Zhong Buhui to close the door and returned to his room to rest.\n Arriving home, Cheng Yanmo told the butler about the old master on the mountain. \u201cThat old master has a grandson?\u201d Cheng Yanmo asked the butler, \u201cWhen I was young, I went to the river with his grandson to fish?\u201d\n The butler frowned at the mention of this.\n He said, \u201cThat family\u2019s grandson is very mischievous. When he was young, he always brought you to do dangerous things. He brought you to the river to fish, but you ended up in the river. Not only did he not bring you back, but he was also afraid of being scolded. He even brought you to the streets to buy clothes, thinking that you would not be discovered if you came back wearing dry clothes...\u201d\n The butler shook his head and sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s too mischievous. I wonder how capable he is now. I don\u2019t think that the grandson of that old man is a pushover either.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo asked him, \u201cI heard from Old Master that his grandson is also in the business world. I might have seen him before. Do you remember his name?\u201d\n \u201cHis name is Zhanzhan. Everyone calls him Zhanzhan, but I don\u2019t know what his full name is.\u201d\n \u201cZhanzhan?\u201d Cheng Yanmo sounded shocked and doubtful.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

For some reason, Han Zhan\u2019s face suddenly popped into Cheng Yanmo\u2019s mind. He thought of Han Zhan\u2019s mixed-blood eyes and asked the butler, \u201cDoes that little brother have a pair of gray-blue eyes?\u201d\n \u201cUnexpectedly, the butler looked shocked and asked Cheng Yanmo, \u201cYoung Master, you still remember? How old were you then?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was speechless.\n He thought to himself, What a coincidence.\n Old Master Han\u2019s grandson was really Han Zhan! Didn\u2019t they say that Han Zhan only had one grandfather? Cheng Yanmo was afraid that he had misunderstood the relationship between Han Zhan and Old Master Han. He asked the butler, \u201cIs Zhanzhan Old Master Han\u2019s biological paternal grandson or maternal grandson?\u201d\n \u201cMaternal grandson, Old Master Han only has one daughter. She died young and Zhanzhan was only six or seven years old.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo waved his hand to dismiss the butler before returning to the study alone.\n Sitting on the sofa in the study, Cheng Yanmo recalled the few times he met Han Zhan and felt like he finally understood why Han Zhan dared to beat up his superior Li Li so badly at the martial arts school, and why Li Li had opened the door for Han Zhan in the tea house.\n The reason was simple\u2014Han Zhan is the real boss!\n How did Zeus Airlines manage to stabilize itself so quickly and carve out a path for itself among so many state-owned enterprises and private airlines? It is all because of Han Aoyu!\n Who is Han Aoyu?\n He is someone who could make the country lower its flag in respect after his death!\n All his doubts were answered.\n Cheng Yanmo couldn\u2019t help but reflect on what he had done to Han Zhan\u2014 Did I do anything wrong? I didn\u2019t offend Han Zhan, right? He felt that he shouldn\u2019t have offended Han Zhan, but thinking of that troublesome younger brother, Cheng Yanmo wasn\u2019t so sure.\n On the morning of the 26th, Cheng Ziang woke up early and sat at the dining table with a dark expression. Up until midnight last night, everyone in the WeChat group was still talking about Song Ci\u2019s wedding today. There were also many retards who wanted to interview Cheng Ziang.\n What mood could Cheng Ziang have?\n He wasn\u2019t the one getting married!\n Cheng Yanmo came downstairs. He saw that Cheng Ziang\u2019s face was dark and guessed why he was unhappy. He couldn\u2019t help warning him. \u201cStay home today and don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t really love Song Ci that much either. I\u2019m just angry and uncomfortable.\u201d Thinking about it, as the Second Young Master of Chuan Dong Group, how could he not be better than that Han Zhan?\n But Cheng Ziang only dared to say this in his heart. He didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud for fear of being glared at by his brother.\n ]Still worried about his brother, Cheng Yanmo thought for a moment and said, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me to the office today. Stay under my watch and don\u2019t go anywhere!\u201d\n Cheng Ziang was stunned. \u201cBrother, I am not a child!\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo looked at him coldly. His face darkened as he said, \u201cIf you were a child, I would have given you homework.\u201d Cheng Yanmo was the merciful one for not giving him homework.\n Cheng Ziang couldn\u2019t even finish his breakfast.\n Cheng Yanmo was a man of his words. Before leaving the house, he really carried Cheng Ziang into the car. Upon reaching the office, he stuffed Cheng Ziang into his own office and tossed him a laptop so that he could fend for himself.\n During the meeting, they had to set up a chair for his little brother in the meeting room. All the senior management thought that Cheng Yanmo was planning to groom Cheng Ziang into the company.\n ...\n Song Ci had nothing to do with how tough things were for the Cheng brothers. She was very busy today as she was getting married.\n Song Ci was born in the Cai Family Village. After the two sisters grew up, the family moved to the city to facilitate their studies.\n In the past, when her parents were still alive, they would return to their hometown for a period of time every year to renovate the house. After the earthquake, her parents passed away and her elder sister became comatose, so Song Ci didn\u2019t manage the old house anymore.\n As they were getting married, Song Ci had sent someone to renovate the old house in advance. The walls of the house had been rebuilt and new furniture had been bought.\n She had stayed here the night before.\n At 4am, there was the sound of a car coming from downstairs. It was the makeup artist\u2019s team. Song Ci had no choice but to get out of bed. She groggily made herself a glass of milk and was pressed onto the stool by the makeup artist to put on makeup and do her hair.\n It was already daytime when everything was ready.\n The wedding was set to be at 9am and Song Ci had an hour to herself. She placed her cell phone on the counter and gave Song Fei a video call.\n It was 1am in the middle of the night in Congo and Song Fei was already asleep. There was a double bed in the room and Song Fei was sleeping against the wall while Yan Jiang was sleeping by the window. Yan Jiang picked up the video call when he heard the cell phone ring.\n \u201cSong Song.\u201d\n Song Ci stared at Yan Jiang for several seconds before saying, \u201cHow long has it been? How did you become so tanned?\u201d\n The number one handsome man, Yan Jiang\u2019s skin used to be so fair and smooth. But in just a month, he had turned black. Noticing Song Ci\u2019s disdain, Yan Jiang shook his head and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m near the equator, what do you think?\u201d\n Song Ci asked him, \u201cYou\u2019re still sleeping in the same room as Song Fei?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cLook at how useless you are. When you climb into bed with Song Fei one day, remember to tell me and I will set off fireworks for you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said in a self-deprecating manner, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to do it. I can do it myself.\u201d\n After the joke ended, Yan Jiang\u2019s expression turned serious. He gazed at Song Ci quietly, saw her in a wedding gown, and said sincerely, \u201cSong Song, you are especially beautiful today.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly embarrassed by his compliment. She asked Yan Jiang, \u201cCompared to Song Fei?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cIn my eyes, even if Song Fei is covered in dirt, she is still prettier than you.\u201d\n Song Ci pretended to be despondent. \u201cOur friendship is over!\u201d\n Yan Jiang raised his brows. \u201cAlright then. I can save on the red packet.\u201d\n \u201cYou are still my good brother.\u201d Song Ci changed her face like how a woman changed her clothes.\n Yan Jiang smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ve prepared a wedding present for you. Ah Lun should be arriving soon. Look forward to it.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly surprised. \u201cYou are...\u201d\n She felt very touched.\n They had been chatting for so long and still hadn\u2019t heard Song Fei\u2019s voice. Song Ci knew that Song Fei must be very tired, that was why she was sleeping so soundly. \u201cIs Song Fei very tired?\u201d\n Yan Jiang focused the camera on Song Fei\u2019s sleeping face. His voice became gentler. \u201cBefore she fell asleep, she was still looking at the calendar and saying that its your wedding date. There have been quite a number of patients these two days and she didn\u2019t get much rest. Now that she is asleep, I can\u2019t bear to wake her up.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, let her sleep. When she wakes up, tell her to call me back.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n As she spoke, Song Ci heard the makeup artist say, \u201cSong Song, is that Yan Jiang\u2019s assistant, Ah Lun?\u201d The makeup artist was a friend of Song Ci\u2019s called Ai Lun. The two of them were very close and both called each other by name.\n Song Ci walked to the window and glanced downstairs. She saw Ah Lun. \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d Song Ci said to Yan Jiang, \u201cYour assistant is here. Let\u2019s not chat for now.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "176": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-177\n\n Chapter 176: The Pampered Baby Ci  After hanging up, Song Ci said to Ah Lun, \u201cAh Lun, come upstairs!\u201d\n Ah Lun waved at her before running upstairs to look for her. Holding two gift bags, Ah Lun entered the house and said to Song Ci, \u201cSong Song, before Brother Jiang left, he gave me the gift that he prepared for you for safekeeping. There are two gifts. One is Brother Jiang\u2019s and the other is Miss Song Fei\u2019s.\u201d\n Song Ci knew that it was impossible for Song Fei to not do anything for her wedding.\n \u201cThis is from Brother Jiang and this is from Miss Song Fei.\u201d The two gifts were of the same size.\n Ai Lun helped Song Ci open Song Fei\u2019s box. After seeing what was inside, he looked puzzled. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n Ah Lun shook his head and said honestly, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. It\u2019s a rock?\u201d\n Song Ci glanced inside the box. Inside was an egg-shaped rock the size of a child\u2019s fist. Song Ci\u2019s gaze turned gentle as she recalled something. \u201cIt\u2019s a dinosaur egg fossil.\u201d\n Ah Lun and Ai Lun widened their eyes. \u201cA dinosaur egg fossil?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Fei and Father Song had picked up this egg fossil at a quarry when they went sightseeing. Song Fei treated it like a treasure and couldn\u2019t bear for Song Ci to touch it.\n Worried that someone might steal this treasure, Song Fei even got Father Song to deposit it in the bank. Song Ci was enraged and scolded Song Fei for being so petty that she couldn\u2019t bear to let her touch it. Song Fei said, \u201cI will give it to you when you get married.\u201d\n Song Ci took it as Song Fei was bullshitting.\n She didn\u2019t expect Song Fei\u2019s casual words to be sincere. She had really given her darling dinosaur fossil to her.\n Song Ci suddenly felt like crying. She hurriedly said to Ai Lun, \u201cAi Lun, I am going to cry.\u201d\n \u201cAiyo, my little ancestor, you better hold it in!\u201d Ai Lun hurriedly found a cotton bud and dabbed at Song Ci\u2019s eyes. Song Ci held back her tears and got Ah Lun to open Yan Jiang\u2019s present.\n Ah Lun took out a dark green box from the gift bag, and it clearly looked very expensive. Ah Lun opened the box and saw what was inside. He exclaimed. \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s so beautiful! Song Song, it\u2019s a crown!\u201d\n Hearing this, Ai Lun also glanced into the box and his eyes lit up. \u201cSong Song, it\u2019s really a crown!\u201d\n Ai Lun took out the crown and showed it to Song Ci. It was a pearl crown with a green gem the size of a quail egg in the center.\n Song Ci recognized this emerald.\n Two years ago, Yan Jiang had once endorsed an international luxury jewelry brand. At that time, he had only accepted a million yuan endorsement fee from the brand and asked for a green gem.\n Song Ci knew about this and even mocked Yan Jiang for being silly. A gem is just a stone. How can it be pragmatic?\n Yan Jiang had a popsicle in his mouth then. He patted Song Ci on the head and comforted her. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. When you get married in the future, I will make it into a crown for you to wear. I will be your elder brother and give you face.\u201d\n Scenes of memories surfaced in her mind. All those words that she thought were just a joke turned out to be promises!\n If Song Ci could still hold back her tears, she was inhuman!\n Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. Ai Lun glanced at her and was too embarrassed to tell her not to cry. If this happened to him, he would also cry until his tears dried up.\n \u201cGo ahead and cry. There\u2019s still enough time anyway. I\u2019ll touch up your makeup after you\u2019re done crying.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci suddenly broke into a smile. \u201cHearing this, I can\u2019t cry anymore.\u201d\n \u201cThen I should have said so earlier.\u201d Ai Lun reapplied Song Ci\u2019s makeup before putting that emerald crown on her head. He sized her up and was very satisfied with her makeup today.\n \u201cSong Song, you are the most beautiful bride I have ever seen.\u201d\n Song Ci gave him a faint smile and said, \u201cYou made my beauty.\u201d\n At this moment, Mu Qiu and Du Tingting\u2019s car arrived downstairs. Du Tingting was very particular about today\u2019s occasion. She was dressed very formally, put on makeup, had her hair done, and even put on rare and valuable accessories.\n Mu Qiu was wearing a bridesmaid\u2019s outfit and went up to Song Ci\u2019s room with Du Tingting.\n \u201cSong Song.\u201d Du Tingting was charmed by Song Ci\u2019s beauty. She gazed at Song Ci and said, \u201cYou were even shorter than me when you first came to my house. Look at you now. You\u2019re already married.\u201d\n Song Ci patted the seat beside her and said to Du Tingting, \u201cMother, have a seat.\u201d\n Du Tingting sat down and glanced at Ah Lun and Ai Lun. The two of them were very smart and immediately found an excuse to leave the room. Instantly, there was only Du Tingting and her daughter in the room.\n Only then did Du Tingting hold Song Ci\u2019s hand and stuffed a bank card into it. Song Ci was shocked and wanted to push her hand away. \u201cMother, what are you doing?\u201d\n Du Tingting wiped her moist eyes and said in a choked voice, \u201cSong Song, I know there\u2019s a deep rift between you and your father. I also know that all these years, you\u2019ve returned all the money that we spent on you and your sister to your father.\u201d\n \u201cBut Song Song, you can calculate money but not relationships.\u201d\n Du Tingting stuffed the card into Song Ci\u2019s hand and held it, not allowing her to return it.\n She told Song Ci, \u201cThis is my private savings. You and I are mother and daughter, but I can\u2019t let you get married in a grand manner. You can keep this money. After you get married and have children, there are too many things to spend...\u201d\n Song Ci was very touched. All these years, Du Tingting\u2019s kindness towards her had been real. She was made of flesh and blood. Of course she could feel Du Tingting\u2019s efforts. That year, even until her death, Du Tingting still couldn\u2019t stop worrying about her and even urged her to get a divorce to be her true self.\n In the path of planning to take revenge on Mu Mian and Mu Qiu, Du Tingting was the greatest burden in Song Ci\u2019s heart. She clutched the bank card that Du Tingting had given her. Regardless of how much money was in the card, at this moment, she truly felt the love of a mother.\n \u201cMother...\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t help hugging Du Tingting.\u201d Mother, you must live a long life. I still have to be filial to you in future! \u201d\n In the previous lifetime, Du Tingting suddenly passed away three years later after a cerebral hemorrhage. Her death was unacceptable to everyone, and Mu Mian had to grovel for several months before finally accepting this reality.\n I wonder how Du Tingting would end up in this life...\n Mu Qiu saw Han Zhan\u2019s car driving over and quickly reminded Song Ci and Du Tingting. \u201cMother, Elder Sister, Brother-in-Law and the rest are here!\u201d\n Only then did Du Tingting stand up and wipe her tears. She said to Song Ci, \u201cKeep the card well. I will wait for you downstairs.\u201d\n \u201cThanks, Mom...\u201d\n Du Tingting went downstairs and bumped into Han Zhan at the corridor entrance. Han Zhan stopped and nodded at Du Tingting. \u201cMother, you\u2019re here.\u201d\n \u201cOh Han Zhan, Song Song is already dressed up. Go ahead.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, excuse me then.\u201d\n Han Zhan only brought along one groomsman, who was Li Li. The two of them arrived at the door to Song Ci\u2019s room. Han Zhan tidied his bow tie and knocked on the door. \u201cBaby Ci, I\u2019m here to pick you up.\u201d\n Mu Qiu stood behind the door and turned to ask Song Ci, \u201cBig Sister, do you want to block the door?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cNo, open the door.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t make things difficult for Han Zhan and just opened the door.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "177": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-178\n\n Chapter 177: The Most Beautiful Bride  Li Li stood behind Han Zhan, holding a black briefcase filled with red packets. Seeing that Mu Qiu didn\u2019t make things difficult for them and opened the door, Li Li hurriedly took out a red packet and gave it to her.\n \u201cYou are the most gentle and kindest bridesmaid I have ever met.\u201d\n This was not Li Li\u2019s first time being a best man. Every time he was a best man in the past, he would be taught a lesson.\n It was rare for things to go smoothly this time.\n Mu Qiu squeezed the red packet. She was very satisfied with its thickness. Mu Qiu smiled and moved aside. She said to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother-in-law, come in quickly.\u201d\n Han Zhan entered the house.\n This was the first time Han Zhan saw Song Ci in a wedding gown. She was even more beautiful and mesmerizing than he had imagined.\n Song Ci was wearing a white wedding gown made of lace and satin. It was designed to wrap around her waist and hips. The neckline of the gown reached deep into her chest, but Song Ci\u2019s perfect chest shape was completely concealed.\n Only then did Han Zhan feel assured. Uncle Li was still kind enough not to let Song Ci expose herself.\n Han Zhan walked towards Song Ci step by step, knelt down on one knee in front of her, raised the bouquet in his right hand to Song Ci, and asked very seriously, \u201cSong Ci, will you marry me?\u201d\n \u201cOf course I will.\u201d Song Ci accepted the bouquet with both hands and kissed Han Zhan\u2019s forehead. \u201cGroom Han, you must carry me downstairs and get into the car. You are not allowed to stop in the middle.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan carried Song Ci in a princess style. He carried her down the stairs and placed her in the car easily.\n The wedding was held on the hill behind. When they arrived, Han Zhan went to the wedding venue first. Song Ci changed into a wedding gown in the RV while Mu Qiu accompanied her.\n The wedding was set to take place at 10am. At 9.50am, Ai Lun started to check Song Ci\u2019s makeup, hairstyle, and accessories. After confirming that there were no issues, he asked Song Ci, \u201cHow are you feeling? Are you nervous?\u201d\n Holding the bouquet, Song Ci smiled sheepishly. \u201cAlthough it has been two months since we registered our marriage, I am still rather nervous on our wedding day.\u201d\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cYou are Song Ci. How can you be nervous?\u201d\n Song Ci twirled the bouquet in her hand and took a deep breath. \u201cYes, I am Song Ci. How can I have stage fright?\u201d\n Bei Zhan walked over and knocked on the car door. He said to Ai Lun, \u201cEverything is ready here. The bride can alight and wait for her turn to enter the venue.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Ai Lun and Mu Qiu helped Song Ci out of the car. The three of them stood beside the car. Mu Qiu had something on her mind and hadn\u2019t spoken much since she saw Song Ci. Song Ci asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What are you thinking about?\u201d\n Mu Qiu looked at Song Ci hesitantly.\n \u201cBig sister...\u201d Mu Qiu held the ring box in her hand. She ran her thumb back and forth across the surface of the box before saying,\u201d Father has something urgent to attend to at his company and is on a work trip. He might not be able to make it today...\u201d The more she spoke, the softer her voice became.\n Song Ci saw Du Tingting early in the morning but didn\u2019t see Mu Mian. She guessed that Mu Mian wouldn\u2019t be attending the wedding today. Hearing Mu Qiu\u2019s words, Song Ci knew that this was Mu Qiu\u2019s excuse for Mu Mian.\n Her expression was impassive as she said calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I will enter alone later.\u201d Instead of letting Mu Mian bring her in, Song Ci would rather walk the red carpet alone.\n ]At this moment, Shen Yubei walked over.\n He was wearing a black shirt that was rarely seen today. His suit was still white, with a pure black collar sewn with tiny golden stars.\n Shen Yubei looked like a wealthy young master who had just graduated from the Republic of China. His every movement was elegant and classy.\n Arriving in front of Song Ci, Shen Yubei sized her up and finally fixed his eyes on the crown on her head. \u201cThe emerald is very beautiful.\u201d\n Song Ci seemed jealous. She asked, \u201cIs the emerald the only thing that\u2019s beautiful?\u201d\n Shen Yubei was only 1.8 meters tall and Song Ci was wearing 10cm high heels. She didn\u2019t need to raise her head to look at him. Song Ci smiled helplessly and said, \u201cTeacher, is it so difficult to praise me for being beautiful?\u201d\n Shen Yubei tapped Song Ci\u2019s forehead and praised her. \u201cSong Ci, you are especially charming today.\u201d\n Hearing such a praise, Song Ci felt slightly embarrassed and her ears turned slightly red.\n She grabbed Shen Yubei\u2019s arm and said in a clear voice, \u201cThe first time I participated in a competition, it was Teacher who led me onto the stage. I wonder if I will have the honor of inviting Teacher to accompany me into the arena this time?\u201d\n Hearing this, Shen Yubei was slightly stunned. \u201cCan... I?\u201d He was neither Song Ci\u2019s father nor her relative and was not suitable for this.\n \u201cYou are my most respected teacher. Of course you can.\u201d Song Ci gazed at the wedding venue ahead. She could hear the guests talking. Song Ci told Shen Yubei, \u201cI am a little nervous, Teacher.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, I will accompany you.\u201d Recalling the past, Shen Yubei\u2019s expression softened. He said, \u201cDo you remember how we managed to overcome your nervousness the first time you went for a competition?\u201d\n Song Ci was only 6 years old when she went on stage for the first time. She couldn\u2019t remember the scene, but she remembered Shen Yubei teaching her that if she was nervous, she should look up at the blue sky...\n Point her middle finger!\n Song Ci suddenly reached out her right hand and raised her middle finger. \u201cI am the most beautiful girl in the world. I am not nervous at all!\u201d\n Shen Yubei also raised his middle finger. \u201cI am the most handsome man in the world. I am not nervous at all!\u201d\n Song Ci was really not nervous anymore.\n With the sound of a bell, Song Ci heard Bei Zhan shout. \u201cMay the bride enter the venue!\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go, Song Ci. I will accompany you. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Holding Shen Yubei\u2019s hand, Song Ci entered the wedding venue.\n The wedding venue was very meticulously decorated. The chairs at the venue were carved out of solid wood and polished smooth. The wedding stage was set under a red maple tree.\n Behind the tree was a pale green lake. To prevent any accidents, a wooden fence had been erected between the lake and the stage, and the fence was surrounded by roses.\n Han Zhan stood on the stage with his hands resting on his abdomen, quietly waiting for his bride to enter. The red maple leaves swayed gently in the breeze and landed on his shoulders.\n Han Zhan lowered his head to remove the maple leaves. He looked up and saw Song Ci under the floral arch. His blue-grey eyes were lit up with a tinge of red and were filled with astonishment and fondness.\n Song Ci was wearing a red halter dress instead of a popular white wedding dress. The red dress was as vibrant as the maple trees in late autumn and accentuated Song Ci\u2019s sexy, slender figure.\n Her long hair was in a simple bun, and she was wearing an emerald crown. Her skin was smooth and supple, and her features were radiant. The bride\u2019s beauty was one with the beauty of the forest. This scene was breathtakingly beautiful.\n At this moment, Han Zhan suddenly felt the exceptional charm of the top socialite.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Everyone held their breaths at the sight of the elegant and beautiful Song Ci. Han Zhan\u2019s godmothers all stared at Song Ci with satisfaction, their eyes filled with love and excitement.\n Song Ci\u2019s mind was in a mess. Her feet landed on the soft grass as if she was stepping on clouds. She gazed at Han Zhan on the stage of the wedding and was slightly embarrassed by his scorching gaze.\n Lowering her head slightly, Song Ci thought: Brother Han, can\u2019t you control your gaze?\n Shen Yubei brought Song Ci over to Han Zhan. This was the first time Shen Yubei saw Han Zhan in person and he felt an inexplicable sense of jealousy.\n This old guy had it easy!\n Han Zhan bent down and greeted respectfully, \u201cTeacher Shen.\u201d\n Shen Yubei acknowledged and placed Song Ci\u2019s hand on Han Zhan\u2019s palm. At the same time, Shen Yubei told Han Zhan, \u201cI watched Song Ci grow up. You can\u2019t bully her just because she has no parents.\u201d\n \u201cShe still has me.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart shuddered. He looked at Shen Yubei solemnly and promised. \u201cTeacher, don\u2019t worry. I will never let Song Ci down.\u201d\n \u201cYou must do what you say.\u201d Shen Yubei patted Song Ci\u2019s back and reminded her. \u201cGo on stage with him.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, teacher.\u201d\n Holding Han Zhan\u2019s hand, Song Ci walked up to the stage.\n The two of them stood facing each other, holding hands as they gazed at each other.\n The respected president of the Chamber of Commerce, Chen Shu, was their wedding witness.\n Chen Shu was a humorous old man. He poured two glasses of wine and said a classic saying. \u201cThe wine of love is sweet and bitter. If two people drink it, it will be sweet dew; if three people drink it, it will be sour vinegar; if you drink it casually, you will be poisoned.\u201d\n \u201cCome, drink this wine and don\u2019t drink it with anyone else in this life!\u201d As he spoke, Chen Shu gave Han Zhan a meaningful look, as if he was looking at a jerk.\n Han Zhan felt very helpless.\n Chen Shu handed the glasses to Song Ci and Han Zhan respectively. The two of them smiled at each other and drank the wine.\n Chen Shu\u2019s expression suddenly turned serious. He opened a certificate booklet and said in an elderly voice,\n \u201cThe marriage between the two families is a promise of eternal love and a compatibility of the same title. When one gets married, they would vow to stay by each other through thick or thin, in sickness or in health, till death do them apart.\u201d\n Chen Shu looked up and glanced at Han Zhan, before looking at the beautiful young bride, Song Ci. He asked Han Zhan, \u201cHan Zhan, are you willing to marry Song Ci and be together with her forever from now on?\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at Song Ci, making her blush. \u201cI do.\u201d\n Chen Shu asked Song Ci, \u201cSong Ci, are you willing to be married to Han Zhan, stay by his side for the rest of your life, and be together with him forever?\u201d\n \u201cI do.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, let\u2019s exchange tokens.\u201d\n Li Li took the ring box and walked behind Han Zhan. Han Zhan reached out his white-gloved right hand, retrieved the ring, and personally put it on for Song Ci.\n Han Zhan had custom-made the ring for Song Ci. On the claw-embellished gold holder was a glittering and luxurious diamond. The diamond was 6.2 carats high, FL, D, and 3EX perfectly cut.\n From size, purity, or cut, this was a rare and valuable diamond.\n Han Zhan had bought this diamond two months ago, on the day he and Song Ci registered their marriage.\n Mo Yao was a jewelry supplier and a jewel collector herself. Five years ago, Mo Yao had bought this diamond from an African jeweler at a high price of 4 million yuan. Since Han Zhan sincerely wanted to buy it, Mo Yao had sold it to him at its original price.\n The original cost of this diamond ring was just over 4 million yuan, but its market value was immeasurable. It could be sold for an astonishingly high price at any auction.\n With the diamond ring on Song Ci\u2019s slender fingers, she looked even more beautiful.\n The guests below couldn\u2019t resist taking out their phones to take photos.\n Compared to Song Ci\u2019s high-profile and luxurious diamond ring, Han Zhan\u2019s ring was much more low profile. His ring was just a simple ring with a black diamond in the center.\n Song Ci felt sorry for Han Zhan and decided to knit five sweaters for him after the wedding!\n After the exchange of love tokens, the two of them signed their names on the marriage certificate. Han Zhan, who had always been wild and unrestrained, had written the words in \u2018zheng kai\u2019 style on the certificate.\n Song Ci copied him and obediently wrote her own name.\n Han Zhan and Song Ci\u2019s names were side by side on the paper, and their fates would be tied together forever. Song Ci stared at the marriage certificate and suddenly felt like asking Han Zhan, In my previous life, you said you had a secret to tell me. What is it?\n It was a pity that Han Zhan didn\u2019t have the memories of his previous life.\n Chen Shu closed the marriage certificate and said loudly, \u201cThe ceremony is complete!\u201d\n Li Li suddenly pushed Han Zhan. Han Zhan was caught off guard and lunged towards Song Ci. Song Ci hurriedly hugged Han Zhan and the two of them staggered a few steps before stabilizing themselves.\n Below, the youngsters were cheering. \u201cKiss!\u201d\n After closing the door to the house, Han Zhan was like an old hooligan. However, outside the door, Han Zhan also felt somewhat uneasy with so many elders staring at them.\n Song Ci suddenly cupped Han Zhan\u2019s face, planted a kiss on his mouth, and kissed his forehead, leaving a lipstick mark.\n The commotion grew louder.\n Han Aoyu said to Chen Shu\u2019s wife, \u201cOur Zhanzhan is shy!\u201d\n Old Madam Chen smiled graciously. \u201cZhanzhan is really embarrassed.\u201d She looked at Song Ci and said, \u201cYour granddaughter-in-law is quite cute.\u201d\n Han Aoyu couldn\u2019t resist gloating. \u201cSong Ci is quite good. She is beautiful, kind, good with words, knows how to knit and fly airplanes. I heard that she also plays the violin very well. She can even eat...\u201d Han Aoyu shook his head and said happily,\u201dShe\u2019s good at everything. \u201d\n Old Madam Chen just smiled mildly.\n Han Zhan got married in his thirties. She could understand why the old man was so happy.\n After the wedding ended, everyone boarded the car to the hotel for dinner. Song Ci and Han Zhan took a set of wedding photos in the forest before heading to the hotel.\n They had a very happy meal and didn\u2019t drink crazily. As there were very few people, Song Ci only drank two glasses after the toast.\n There was still a party at the banquet. After dinner, the guests stayed in the hotel, playing cards and singing. Han Zhan greeted Song Ci\u2019s friends and played a few rounds of cards, before bringing her upstairs to officially meet his godmothers.\n All three godmothers were here.\n Dressed in a white v-neck suit, Mo Yao sat sideways on the sofa, her fair feet resting on Li Yao\u2019s lap. Li Yao used a feather to gently stroke the base of Mo Yao\u2019s foot. Mo Yao narrowed her eyes in enjoyment.\n Song Ci entered the house and saw this scene. Stunned, a phrase flashed across her mind:\n The domineering female CEO and her little sweetheart!\n Glancing at Li Yao\u2019s muscular and fit figure under his suit, Song Ci felt slightly embarrassed.\n This little sweetheart was not small at all.\n The singer, Di Rongrong, had taken off her gown and was wearing a negligee with straps. She knelt on the carpet beside the coffee table and looked down at her bag. As she searched for something, Di Rongrong said, \u201cCome play mahjong. Mo Yao, you have so much money. Are you afraid of losing it to me?\u201d\n Mo Yao narrowed her eyes and remained silent.\n The female diplomat, Jin Luolan, was staring at the television and watching the movie Titanic. She was staring at the face of the male lead, Xiao Li, without even blinking.\n Jin Luolan acted as if she was proud of being pretty, and that she was the perfect match for a handsome guy. It was very difficult to associate her with that vicious-tongued diplomat in front of the media, who would often rebuke the reporters from other countries until they didn\u2019t even dare to fart.\n Han Zhan coughed and said in a low voice, \u201cGodmother, I brought Song Ci over for you guys.\u201d Upon hearing this, the three godmothers looked up at Song Ci in unison. Their eyes were shining brightly, as if they were looking at a treasure.\n Song Ci\u2019s muscles tensed.\n Standing beside Han Zhan, she nodded slightly and greeted the three women. \u201cHello, Godmothers!\u201d\n Di Rongrong hurriedly stood up and pulled Song Ci to the sofa beside Mo Yao. \u201cSong Ci, I see that your friends all call you Song Song. Let\u2019s call you Song Song too.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, godmother.\u201d Thinking of Li Yao\u2019s previous instructions, Song Ci hurriedly flattered Di Rongrong. \u201cGodmother, what brand of foundation powder did you use? It\u2019s so compatible, and it looks like your skin has no pores at all, even better than mine!\u201d\n Li Yao glanced at Song Ci with a faint smile.\n Embarrassed, Di Rongrong touched her face and said shyly, \u201cHey, Song Song, you have such good eyesight. In terms of good skin, your other two godmothers can\u2019t compare to me. I am a skincare expert. I have been taking good care of myself since I was in my teens...\u201d\n At the mention of skincare tips, Di Rongrong went on and on.\n Song Ci listened patiently with a smile. There was no hint of impatience on her face.\n Han Zhan suppressed his laughter and glanced at Song Ci. Just as Di Rongrong was talking about how to wash her face so that she could better understand the pores on her body, Han Zhan finally interrupted her. \u201cGodmother Rongrong, why don\u2019t you write a skincare book and publish it? Give one to our Song Ci so that she can learn from your book?\u201d\n Di Rongrong\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou are right. Ah, Zhanzhan, you are so smart!\u201d\n Di Rongrong also stopped playing mahjong. She opened her laptop and got ready to write a book.\n Song Ci could tell that apart from the fact that this Di Rongrong sang really well, she was rather blur at other times. Song Ci had heard that her teacher had a crush on Di Rongrong and was rather surprised. She didn\u2019t expect her teacher to like such a silly and adorable girl.\n Only then did Song Ci take out Yan Jiang\u2019s photo from her handbag.\n She gave the photo to Jin Luolan. \u201cLuolan Godmother, Yan Jiang heard that you\u2019re a fan of his. Before going to Africa, he specially gave me his autograph and photo so that I can give it to you. He said that it\u2019s his honor to be liked by you.\u201d\n in Luolan accepted the photo and touched it lovingly. She carefully placed the book into her bag, looked up lovingly at Song Ci, touched her face, and praised her. \u201cSong Song, you are such a kind and considerate little girl.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled obediently.\n Who won\u2019t love me for pretending to be obedient?\n Seeing that Song Ci had easily won over Jin Luolan and Di Rongrong\u2019s hearts, Mo Yao was rather curious as to how Song Ci planned to win her favor.\n Only then did Song Ci walk up to Mo Yao. She couldn\u2019t quite resist Mo Yao\u2019s powerful aura. \u201cGodmother Mo Yao, I also prepared a gift for you.\u201d Song Ci tried her best to appear calm and composed. This was the hardest woman to deal with!\n Song Ci handed a notebook to Mo Yao.\n Mo Yao took the notebook and flipped through it several times, before suddenly closing it. She looked up and gazed deeply at Song Ci. \u201cWhere did you get this notebook from?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cMy father personally wrote this when he was still alive.\u201d\n Mo Yao looked at her inquisitively. \u201cYour father...\u201d She stared at the words on the title page and asked,\u201d What is your relationship with the Mo Family? \u201d\n Hearing this, Li Yao, who was playing with his cell phone, suddenly looked up and glanced at Mo Yao. He looked at Song Ci and saw that she looked very confused. Li Yao explained. \u201cThe Mo Family in Chuan City.\u201d\n Song Ci was still confused.\n Only then did Mo Yao speak. \u201cThe Mo Family of Chuan City, the number one legendary Traditional Chinese Medicine family. The Mo Family that is said to possess the art to chill bones and muscles, and the art of rebirth. What relationship do you have with the Mo Family?\u201d\n \u201cNothing.\u201d Song Ci had never heard of the Mo Family. She said, \u201cI never heard of them.\u201d\n Mo Yao looked at her suspiciously and glanced at her notebook. She placed it in Li Yao\u2019s arms and asked casually, \u201cIs your father a very good Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor? What is his name?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cHis name is Song Tingyun. He is quite capable. In the past, people, who were infertile, had sore muscles or backs and other difficult illnesses, would all come looking for him.\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s talent in medicine might be inherited from Song Tingyun.\n Hearing that, Li Yao shot Song Ci a bewildered look before looking down to flip through his notebook. After hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Mo Yao nodded and said, \u201cIf my wish comes true, Song Song, I will give you a company and you will be the lady boss.\u201d\n Song Ci thought to herself: The richest woman is indeed the richest woman. She just casually gave out a company.\n She made a joke. \u201cForget about the company. I don\u2019t have the capability to manage it well. If Godmother really likes me, you can give me a building and let me be a landlady.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mo Yao sat up and pointed to a small box beside the sofa. She said to Song Ci, \u201cIt\u2019s our first meeting and I have prepared a small gift. Take a look. Do you like it?\u201d\n Song Ci thanked her and pulled Han Zhan to the side of the box. Han Zhan opened it for her. Song Ci looked down and was instantly blinded by the flash. She saw a pile of gold bars!\n She\u2019s indeed the richest woman in Asia. This gift is so practical! Not only did she give me gold bars, she even gave me a box of them. How generous!\n As Mo Yao took out her present, Di Rongrong also got up from the side of the computer table and walked over with a gift box. She handed it to Song Ci. \u201cI am not as generous as your Godmother Mo Yao. My present is very shabby.\u201d\n Although it was said to be shabby, it was still a luxury brand bracelet that cost over 100,000 yuan. \u201cThank you, Godmother Rongrong. I like this gift very much.\u201d\n In terms of money, as a civil servant of the country, Jin Luolan was not as generous as Mo Yao and Di Rongrong. She had gifted Song Ci a painting of value.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan returned to their guest room, after greeting their godmothers and gaining their approval.\n Once she entered the room, Song Ci was paralyzed on the bed.\n She was so tired that she didn\u2019t want to move a single finger.\n Han Zhan placed Song Ci\u2019s head on his lap and lovingly massaged her shoulders.\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cIs the Mo Family very formidable?\u201d Mo Yao had only taken a look at her father\u2019s notebook and asked if she knew the Mo Family. Judging from Mo Yao\u2019s reaction at that time, this Mo Family seemed to have quite the background.\n \u201cThe Mo Family is one of the real thousand-year-old medical families in our country. How powerful is the current head of the Mo Family? To put it simply, there are over 1.3 billion people in our country and he only treats those at the top.\u201d\n Song Ci snapped her fingers. \u201cChief imperial physician?\u201d\n \u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n Song Ci laid on Han Zhan\u2019s lap and pointed at her back. \u201cGive me a massage.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cBrother Han, why do you think Godmother Mo Yao asked me if I know the Mo Family? Could it be that my father is related to the Mo Family?\u201d Song Ci was not a silly girl. She could tell that something was amiss just by thinking about it.\n Since Mo Yao asked this, there must be a reason.\n Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cSong Ci, how much effort do you think an orphan needs to put in? How hard do you think she needs to work to possess such astonishing talent like your parents?\u201d\n This question stumped Song Ci.\n Her father\u2019s excellent medical skills were not something that could be learned in just a few years in university. Not only was her mother proficient in many languages, she was also good at the four arts. She was a talented girl.\n She had never thought of this question. As orphans, they had no one to depend on. How did my parents study? At that time, the country had no compulsory education and the orphanage was not as organized as it was now.\n In that era, not to mention orphans, even children from ordinary families would rarely be proficient in foreign languages. Those with good family backgrounds would be considered highly cultured if they could speak English.\n Thinking of this, Song Ci understood the difference.\n ]Song Ci looked up at Han Zhan and asked him, \u201cBrother Han, have you investigated my parents?\u201d\n This was a difficult question to answer.\n After a slight hesitation, Han Zhan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve done a simple investigation on my parents-in-law.\u201d He lied out of goodwill. \u201cI saw that you don\u2019t have any relatives on your side during this wedding, so I wanted to check on your parents-in-law\u2019s background and see if they still have any.\u201d\n Song Ci asked urgently, \u201cWhat are the results?\u201d\n Only when he saw that Song Ci didn\u2019t seem to mind his private investigation of his parents-in-law did Han Zhan relax. Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cThere are many mysteries surrounding your parents. The information I found shows that your parents suddenly appeared in Wangdong City 35 years ago. Before that, there was no Jiang Mengmeng or Song Chengyun in this world...\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. She sat up and crossed her legs. She muttered in disbelief. \u201cHow is this possible? 35 years ago, my parents were already in their twenties. They couldn\u2019t have appeared out of thin air!\u201d\n Han Zhan knew that Song Ci must be filled with doubts. He squeezed her hand comfortingly and said calmly, \u201cI feel that their identities are fake. The names Jiang Mengmeng and Song Chengyun are fake.\u201d\n \u201cAs for their real names, I don\u2019t know either.\u201d\n Song Ci felt ridiculous. If my father isn\u2019t Song Tingyun, then who is he? And who is her mother, Jiang Mengmeng?\n Song Ci\u2019s heart was filled with question marks and she couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\n Song Fei finally woke up and gave Song Ci a video call.\n Song Ci accepted the call and brought her cell phone to the small living room. She placed her cell phone on the ashtray and leaned against the glass of water to steady it. Song Ci sat on the sofa and greeted Song Fei with a heavy heart. \u201cSong Fei, you are awake?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Seeing that Song Ci was wearing pyjamas, Song Fei asked, \u201cI am resting. Are you done with the wedding?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, there\u2019s a party tonight.\u201d Song Ci had been thinking about her parents and was somewhat distracted. She didn\u2019t speak much.\n \u201cIs something bothering you?\u201d Song Fei asked\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t hide her thoughts. She asked Song Fei, \u201cSong Fei, do you think Father and Mother will lie to us?\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s nonchalant expression gradually turned solemn. She stared at Song Ci and frowned. \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly uneasy. She said, \u201cBrother Han told me that our parents\u2019 names are fake. Our mother\u2019s original name isn\u2019t Jiang Mengmeng, and our father\u2019s name is also not Song Chengyun. It\u2019s very possible that they encountered something and hid in Wangdong City to live a life of hiding their identities.\u201d\n \u201cThe fact that they are orphans is highly likely to be false.\u201d After Song Ci spoke, she stared fixedly at Song Fei\u2019s face, not letting go of any minute reaction.\n Song Fei merely nodded coldly and said, \u201cCongratulations. You finally realize that all these years, you have been kept in the dark by your parents.\u201d There was a reason why she called Song Ci a fool.\n Gritting her teeth, Song Ci asked Song Fei, \u201cYou already knew?\u201d\n Song Fei asked, \u201cHow many orphans have you seen as outstanding as our parents?\u201d\n Song Ci realized how stupid she was. She asked Song Fei, \u201cWhat else do you know? Tell me everything, don\u2019t hide it from me.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cNothing else. Our parents are also keeping things from me.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t doubt Song Fei\u2019s words. She suddenly said, \u201cSong Fei, do you think it\u2019s possible that they are fugitives?\u201d Song Ci might not be good at other things, but she was quite imaginative.\n Song Fei was speechless.\n \u201cHave you watched too many police films recently?\u201d\n Song Ci also knew that she was overthinking things, but she just wanted to know what her parents were hiding from them.\n \u201cHappy marriage, Song Ci. I have to get back to work. Let\u2019s talk again next time.\u201d\n \u201c... Alright.\u201d\n Knowing how busy Song Fei was at work, Song Ci didn\u2019t disturb her and hung up.\n Song Fei returned to her room, opened her wardrobe, and found a loose t-shirt and jeans. After changing clothes, she went to the kitchen to cook a bowl of noodles for herself.\n Song Fei didn\u2019t know how to cook and her bowl of noodles was very bland. Staring at the boiling water and noodles, Song Fei murmured. \u201cLittle fool, it\u2019s enough that you\u2019re in charge of being a silly girl. There\u2019s no need to know so much.\u201d\n Even if Song Fei knew, she would never tell Song Ci.\n For example, our mother used to be entangled with a man. For example, we had a half-brother...\n ...\n As night fell, the banquet started.\n The gala was a world for the youngsters.\n Dressed in luxurious clothes, Song Ci and Han Zhan performed the opening dance under the watchful eyes of the crowd. Song Ci\u2019s dance posture was soft and domineering. She was wearing a pale purple dress and danced with Han Zhan on the dance floor in a waltz.\n Song Ci had specially learned dance from a professional teacher, while Han Zhan, this dabbler, didn\u2019t know how to dance at all. He had improvised and learned it for two days before the wedding. Luckily, Han Zhan wasn\u2019t stupid. Although he didn\u2019t dance well with a waltz, he didn\u2019t make a fool of himself.\n After dancing, Song Ci laid in Han Zhan\u2019s arms and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m so scared that you\u2019ll step on my feet.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly embarrassed. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you reward me?\u201d\n Song Ci told Han Zhan mysteriously, \u201cI\u2019ve prepared a surprise for you.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt that it might be more shock than surprise.\n By the time the guests finished their first dance, it was already 8.30pm. Song Ci went back to her room to change into a dance dress. When she returned to the dance hall wearing a golden bra and a gold fishtail skirt, everyone cheered!\n \u201cWow, Song Song, belly dancing?\u201d\n Han Zhan was drinking with Li Li and the rest. Hearing the commotion, he turned around in surprise and looked towards the entrance.\n Seeing Song Ci\u2019s bold outfit, Han Zhan\u2019s breathing paused.\n She\u2019s starting a rebellion!\n Song Ci\u2019s wavy hair fell over her shoulders, and her beautiful eyes were as bewitching as if she was drunk. She glanced at Han Zhan and purposely blinked at him. Han Zhan felt like he was being electrocuted.\n The dance dress she was wearing was very revealing. That slender waist that Han Zhan had seen and touched was openly revealed. It was hard not to attract attention.\n She was already stunning without wearing any accessories.\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were ablaze as he wanted to drag Song Ci away. But there were so many people at the scene and tonight was their wedding party. Han Zhan couldn\u2019t bear to ruin Song Ci\u2019s mood.\n Song Ci walked up to Han Zhan and reached out to hold him. \u201cBrother Han, you stand here.\u201d Song Ci chose the best position for Han Zhan so that he could enjoy the rest of the dance.\n ]Han Zhan crossed his arms and stood aside. He saw Song Ci tidying up her skirt and standing in the middle of the dance floor. She nodded at the drummer.\n The drummer also nodded at Song Ci. He then beat the leather drum with both hands, producing thumping, rhythmic music. Song Ci\u2019s perky bum quivered along with the beat.\n With this move, Han Zhan knew that she was an expert at belly dancing.\n Song Ci felt as if she had been possessed by a water snake. She stood rooted to the ground, but her waist, shoulders, and hips were moving crazily. She looked like she had no bones left.\n Han Zhan was the closest to Song Ci and could clearly feel her charm. His body even reacted.\n Song Ci spun around on her heels, as if she didn\u2019t know fatigue and didn\u2019t feel dizzy. Her skirt fluttered under her, brushing past Han Zhan\u2019s pants, stirring his heart.\n Han Zhan could feel Song Ci\u2019s charm. Likewise, others could also feel it. All the men and women at the scene were shouting Song Ci\u2019s name. There were even some girls who couldn\u2019t resist swaying their hips.\n Behind Han Zhan, Li Li and Bei Zhan were also shrieking.\n Han Zhan glanced at Li Li and Bei Zhan without any warmth in his eyes. The two of them met Han Zhan\u2019s gaze and hurriedly lowered their heads. They didn\u2019t speak nor shout anymore.\n Finally, Song Ci finished dancing.\n She felt slightly warm and her forehead was sweating profusely. Song Ci wiped her sweat and looked up to see Han Zhan striding over. As he got closer, Han Zhan quickly took off his suit and draped it over Song Ci.\n Han Zhan cupped Song Ci\u2019s cheek, lowered his head, and kissed her forehead. Before leaving, Song Ci heard Han Zhan warn her. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d\n Song Ci looked up and gave Han Zhan a clean, gorgeous smile.\n That smile made Han Zhan\u2019s heart quiver.\n Song Ci was pulled to the seat by Han Zhan. Song Ci leaned into his arms and asked him, \u201cBrother Han, am I good at dancing?\u201d\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t lie. \u201cYes.\u201d\n Song Ci was satisfied.\n Almost none of Han Zhan\u2019s elders were present at the banquet tonight. All of them were youngsters, and Song Ci\u2019s friends were from all walks of life\n When it was time for the friends\u2019 performance, Song Ci\u2019s friends all went on stage to perform. Some performed magic tricks while others danced. When it was Han Wangwang\u2019s turn to go on stage, she directly DJ-ed for her little aunt and uncle.\n Han Wangwang was very good at discs. The youngsters below the stage were all dancing crazily like they were in a bar.\n Han Zhan sat down on the sofa and placed his hands on the backrest of the sofa. That noisy DJ voice didn\u2019t affect his mood at all. He was like an old veteran, drinking water expressionlessly.\n Wearing Han Zhan\u2019s jacket, Song Ci stood in his arms and danced crazily. Her waist swayed so much that it made one\u2019s mouth go dry.\n Han Zhan looked up at Song Ci\u2019s frantic manner and swallowed hard. He finished the water in one gulp and signaled for the waiter. \u201cMay I trouble you to give me a glass of ice water?\u201d\n \u2013\n After Han Wangwang\u2019s performance, Liang Bo went on stage with the microphone.\n Liang Boxian sang \u201cMay One\u2019s Heart\u201d. He was one of the more popular new singers these days and everyone was very supportive. After he finished singing, there was thunderous applause.\n Liang Bo got off the stage and gave a toast to Song Ci and Han Zhan. He had a very sweet tongue and wished Song Ci and Han Zhan well. \u201cI wish goddess Song and Mr. Han a blissful marriage and may you two grow old together!\u201d\n Han Zhan finished his drink. After Liang Bo left, he beckoned to Bei Zhan. Bei Zhan walked over, leaned over, and asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mr. Han?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cInform Yu Hua to activate the God Creation Plan as soon as possible. I want to make Liang Bo the most dazzling celebrity. He will become the God of Songs.\u201d Such a glib-tongued child should be popular!\n Bei Zhan\u2019s lips twitched as he acknowledged.\n He stood up and gazed at Liang Bo, who was walking through the crowd with a wine glass in his hand. He felt slightly envious.\n Why is this child so lucky?\n Before the party ended, Han Zhan left with Song Ci.\n Song Ci had not partied enough. Han Zhan pulled her towards the lift. Her high heels dug into the carpet as she walked unsteadily.\n Song Ci had drunk a lot and her face was red. She tugged at Han Zhan\u2019s arm and said coquettishly, \u201cBrother Han, I haven\u2019t had my fill yet. Why are you so boring...\u201d\n Hearing her coquettish voice, Han Zhan\u2019s entire body went limp.\n \u201cDidn\u2019t have fun? It\u2019s okay, Brother Han will play with you.\u201d Han Zhan pulled Song Ci into lift number 6. This lift was only open to special personnel.\n Song Ci leaned on Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder and gave him a dubious look.\n She complained. \u201cBrother Han is like a blockhead. He doesn\u2019t know how to dance or move. What can you play with me...\u201d Hide-and-seek? Fight the Landlord?\n The lift door gradually closed. At the same time, the staff in the surveillance room received the order to cut off the surveillance cameras in the lift that Han Zhan was in.\n Song Ci was in a daze and didn\u2019t know what nonsense she was saying. Only when she was pushed down by Han Zhan and her back pressed against the wall did Song Ci wake up slightly.\n \u201cBrother Han... sob!\u201d\n With her lips sealed, Song Ci couldn\u2019t speak anymore.\n Outside lift no. 6, all the doors were boarded up with the sign that said lift maintenance. Inside lift no. 6, Song Ci was dragged into hell by Han Zhan, and then into the clouds...\n Drifting and sinking, lingering endlessly.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "179": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-180\n\n Chapter 179: Miscarriage  The party had finally ended.\n The guests who stayed nearby drove straight home, while the guests who came from afar stayed in the hotel. Mu Qiu was not used to staying in a hotel. Although the hotel was quite far from home, she still decided to go home.\n Her hair was slightly messy and Mu Qiu decided to just let it down. She drove into a beauty salon that was still open late at night and washed her hair.\n After washing her hair, Mu Qiu came to the side of the Yulong River alone.\n She stood by the riverbank with her arms crossed, recalling those touching moments at the wedding today. She would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t envious.\n How fortunate it is to be able to marry the person one loves deeply.\n At the age of 20, she had yet to embark on her journey of youth, when she was informed that she had arrived at the finishing point. Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t help feeling distressed. If possible, she also wanted to hold a grand wedding and marry the man she loved the most.\n Staring at the surging river water, for a moment, Mu Qiu felt like dying.\n But she was also afraid of dying.\n It was slightly cold by the river and Mu Qiu was wearing very little clothes. She rubbed her arms and turned to go home. Only when she turned did Mu Qiu realize that there was someone standing behind her.\n The black coat draped over Cheng Yanmo\u2019s shoulders made him look majestic and cold.\n She had no idea how long he had been here.\n Cheng Yanmo gazed at Mu Qiu with a complex expression. Looking at his cold expression closely, one could tell that he was slightly nervous, probably afraid that she would jump down from the river.\n After a short pause, Mu Qiu snapped out of her trance and smiled. \u201cMaster Cheng.\u201d\n Staring at the smile on Mu Qiu\u2019s face, Cheng Yanmo suddenly said, \u201cI thought you were going to jump.\u201d His cold, arrogant voice actually had a quiver to it.\n Under the night sky, Mu Qiu smiled stubbornly. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to leave this world, but I am also afraid of dying. I will live on until the last day.\u201d Staring at the cigarette in Cheng Yanmo\u2019s mouth, Mu Qiu asked him again, \u201cDo you smoke too, Master Cheng?\u201d\n Holding a cigarette between his fingers, Cheng Yanmo walked over to the railing. He bent over and leaned against the railing before saying, \u201cWhen I\u2019m very frustrated, I can\u2019t resist smoking one or two sticks.\u201d\n \u201cAre you troubled, Master Cheng?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Mu Qiu walked over to stand beside him. She asked Cheng Yanmo, \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t answer.\n He stared at the river in silence for a long time. When he finally finished his cigarette, he tossed it into the water. Only then did he stand up and turn to look at Mu Qiu. \u201cMu Qiu.\u201d He called her \u2018Mu Qiu\u2019 in a way that belied his love and hatred.\n \u201cHmm?\u201d Mu Qiu looked up slowly. \u201cWhy...\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo suddenly pulled Mu Qiu into his arms and lowered his head to kiss her. Mu Qiu didn\u2019t even struggle until Cheng Yanmo was willing to part with her. Only then did Mu Qiu take a deep breath.\n She was like a drowning person, breathing the air of freedom.\n \u201cMu Qiu.\u201d Cheng Yanmo wiped the corners of Mu Qiu\u2019s lips. \u201cLet me accompany you in your remaining days, alright?\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s heart was in turmoil, as two little villains were fighting inside her heart.\n The rational Mu Qiu said, You can\u2019t agree to him. You\u2019re someone who could die at any time. You will give him hope but also make him despair. You\u2019ll be a jerk!\n Mu Qiu\u2019s head of romance said, I like him and he likes me. We are both adults and we\u2019ll be responsible for every decision we make. I want to try it out with him. I can\u2019t bear to let him go!\n Cheng Yanmo saw through Mu Qiu\u2019s intentions. Taking advantage of the situation, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s cherish our remaining time and not think about anything else. Let\u2019s treat every single day as our last. Mu Qiu, alright?\u201d\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d She was a selfish, greedy bitch after all.\n It was late and Mu Qiu was very tired today. She just wanted to go home and take a bath. Cheng Yanmo saw that she looked exhausted and asked her, \u201cAre you very tired after being a bridesmaid for the entire day?\u201d\n \u201cMy heels are all sore.\u201d Mu Qiu usually wore flat shoes and sneakers. Today was Song Ci\u2019s wedding and she had been wearing high heels the entire time. Her feet and calves were slightly sore.\n She lifted her leg and rubbed her ankle. She said softly, \u201cI want to go home and rest tonight, is that okay?\u201d Her period had only started two days ago and her stomach was feeling slightly unwell.\n \u201cSure, but you are very tired, so don\u2019t drive. I will send you back.\u201d\n \u201cAlright.\u201d\n It was 1am by the time Cheng Yanmo sent Mu Qiu to the main entrance of the Amethyst Gated Community.\n \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Mu Qiu unbuckled her seatbelt and was about to alight when Cheng Yanmo suddenly asked, \u201cAre you really not letting me send you to your doorstep?\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook her head. \u201cNo way. If my father sees a man sending me home late at night, he will beat me to death!\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo felt slightly helpless. \u201cYou\u2019re already 20 years old. How could your father bear to hit you?\u201d\n \u201cMy father is very fierce when he hits people!\u201d Mu Qiu pushed open the car door. Before alighting, she turned back and gave Cheng Yanmo a quick kiss on the cheek before alighting. \u201cGoodnight, Brother Mo.\u201d\n Wearing high heels, Mu Qiu entered the community. Just as she was about to disappear at the end of the road, she turned around and waved at Cheng Yanmo. Under the night sky, the teenage girl\u2019s smile was gorgeous and radiant, making one feel uncontrollably happy.\n Cheng Yanmo smiled and waved at her. Only then did Mu Qiu turn and leave, her figure completely disappearing into the darkness.\n Without seeing Mu Qiu, the smile on Cheng Yanmo\u2019s face gradually disappeared. Thinking that Mu Qiu didn\u2019t have much time left, Cheng Yanmo couldn\u2019t smile anymore.\n The night watch guard at the community center had seen many rich people and was very good at reading people. Cheng Yanmo was the type of person who was obviously of high status. The guard nodded at him and greeted him respectfully.\n Cheng Yanmo tossed a pack of cigarettes to the security guard. \u201cHas anyone been selling houses in this district recently?\u201d\n The security guard glanced at the cigarette in his hand. It was a very good cigarette from Fuchun Mountain Residence.\n The security guard stuffed the cigarette into his pocket and told Cheng Yanmo, \u201cThe Lin Group is on the brink of bankruptcy. I heard that they are selling houses.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo turned the car around and left. Along the way, he called his assistant. \u201cCheck if the Lin Family of the Amethyst Gated Community is going to sell their house. If so, I want it.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Master Cheng.\u201d\n \u2013\n Mu Qiu returned home and changed into slippers. Afraid of disturbing her family, she carried her high heels and tiptoed upstairs.\n As he had a lot of work to do in the second half of the year, Mu Mian returned home early in the afternoon. After dinner, he worked in his study. In the middle of the night, he came out and bumped into Mu Qiu, who was sneakily heading upstairs.\n \u201cQiu-er.\u201d Mu Mian called out to her.\n Startled, Mu Qiu hurriedly turned to look at Mu Mian. \u201cFather, you are still awake?\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Mian stared at Mu Qiu\u2019s slightly red and swollen lips and frowned. He had been there before and knew the reason behind Mu Qiu\u2019s red and swollen lips. Mu Mian asked thoughtfully, \u201cQiu-er, are you dating?\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Qiu was scared witless. She pretended to be calm and said, \u201cNo, Father...\u201d Mu Qiu was not confident enough.\n Mu Mian immediately saw through Mu Qiu\u2019s lie. \u201cQiu-er, you...\u201d Mu Mian wanted to tell Mu Qiu that she was going to die and that she couldn\u2019t fall in love, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it.\n After a moment of silence, Mu Mian said, \u201cFather respects your every decision. I just want you to be happy.\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Qiu smiled sweetly and couldn\u2019t help but act coquettishly. \u201cThank you, Father. I love you the most.\u201d\n Mu Mian smiled lovingly as he watched Mu Qiu return to her room. Du Tingting was awakened by him. She turned on the light and asked Mu Mian, \u201cIs Qiu-er back?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Mu Mian laid down and hugged Du Tingting. He hesitated for a moment before telling her about Mu Qiu\u2019s relationship. \u201cQiu-er seems to be in a relationship.\u201d\n Du Tingting was shocked. She instinctively said, \u201cHow can she fall in love in this situation?\u201d\n Mu Mian sighed as his heart ached slightly. He said, \u201cQiu-er is already 20 years old and she\u2019s no longer a little girl. To be able to meet a guy that she likes, to be able to... fall in love before her death, it can be considered as one less regret.\u201d\n Du Tingting kept silent when she heard Mu Mian say that.\n But the thought of Mu Qiu\u2019s health made her worried. \u201cQiu-er\u2019s condition is so unfair to the boy.\u201d\n \u201cI am very selfish.\u201d Mu Mian hugged Du Tingting tightly. \u201cI just want Qiu-er to be happy.\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s life was reaching its limit. Du Tingting also hoped that Mu Qiu could spend the rest of her life happily and comfortably. \u201cForget it, let her be.\u201d\n Mu Mian didn\u2019t want Du Tingting to worry and changed the subject. \u201cOh yes, are you going for your prenatal checkup tomorrow? I won\u2019t be going to work in the morning and will go with you.\u201d\n As expected, upon hearing this, Du Tingting temporarily forgot about what happened just now. She replied, \u201cYes, I have to go for my prenatal checkup tomorrow. It will be better if you come with me. There are so many young ladies in the hospital. I am just a middle-aged woman with a big belly. I will be very embarrassed if I stand with them.\u201d\n Mu Mian chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re much prettier than them. They won\u2019t be as pretty as you in their forties.\u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart warmed at his words. \u201cYou have such a glib tongue! Go to bed now and get up early tomorrow morning for the prenatal check-up. Otherwise, there will be a long queue.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The next day, Du Tingting and Mu Mian got up early to queue up for the prenatal checkup.\n Mu Qiu came back late last night and took a bath. It was already 2am when she went to bed. According to her biological clock, she usually only woke up at 10am.\n But at 8.40am, Mu Qiu suddenly woke up.\n She was awoken by her physical discomfort.\n Opening her eyes suddenly, Mu Qiu placed her left hand on her chest. Inside her chest, her heart was beating like it was being hammered.\n Mu Qiu felt as if she was suffocating and her heart was racing wildly. Unable to catch her breath, Mu Qiu started to panic. In her panic, the helpless Mu Qiu called out to Du Tingting in fright. \u201cMother!\u201d\n \u201cMother!\u201d\n No one answered her!\n Panic and helplessness overwhelmed Mu Qiu.\n The doctor had told Mu Qiu that if she suffered from frequent arrhythmias, asphyxiation, or chest tightness, it would be a sign of rapid heart failure. Mu Qiu thought she was going to die and was so scared that tears streamed down her face.\n In a hurry, she opened her cell phone and sent a message:\n [Father, mother, I am leaving. Don\u2019t be sad for me. Brother Mo, I am sorry.] After composing this message, Mu Qiu\u2019s heartbeat gradually returned to normal. She sat on the bed sweating profusely and couldn\u2019t help touching her forehead.\n Mu Qiu felt sweat all over her hands.\n Mu Qiu truly knew that her days were numbered.\n Nothing happened to her body these two months, so Mu Qiu was so optimistic that she thought she could live a little longer. After all, even doctors made mistakes in their judgement sometimes, right? But this irregularity completely destroyed Mu Qiu\u2019s hopes and optimism.\n Mu Qiu was scared out of her wits. She laid in bed for a short rest before taking out her cell phone and sending Cheng Yanmo a message.\n [Brother Mo, can I go look for you?] At this moment, Mu Qiu suddenly wanted to be with Cheng Yanmo.\n Cheng Yanmo: [Come over.]\n Mu Qiu got up, washed her face, put on a facial mask, and applied light makeup on her pale face.\n She changed into a light yellow long-sleeved dress and put on a mischievous bun in her hair. Carrying her bag downstairs, she walked into the living room and met her parents who had just returned from their prenatal checkup.\n Mu Mian and Du Tingting were chatting happily. They were even happier to see Mu Qiu. Du Tingting walked up to Mu Qiu with a smile, held her hand, and handed her the ultrasound scan.\n \u201cQiu-er, come and look. This is the baby\u2019s ultrasound scan.\u201d Du Tingting was rather happy. She was so focused on the baby\u2019s ultrasound scan that she didn\u2019t notice Mu Qiu\u2019s fatigued expression.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s expression remained unchanged. She accepted the ultrasound scan and stared at the blurry image. She asked Du Tingting, \u201cWhere is the baby? I can\u2019t see clearly.\u201d\n Du Tingting pointed to a seat. \u201cRight here. It\u2019s still very small.\u201d\n Mu Qiu looked closely and saw a blurry outline of a child.\n Mu Qiu smiled. \u201cHe must be very healthy.\u201d\n \u201cThe doctor also said that the baby is very healthy. We can already hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat today.\u201d\n Mu Mian was also very happy. He took the ultrasound scan from Mu Qiu\u2019s hand and folded it. \u201cYou must keep this well. This is the child\u2019s first ultrasound scan.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n It had been 20 years until Mu Mian and Du Tingting were once again parents, so they couldn\u2019t help feeling somewhat emotional. They couldn\u2019t wait to leave behind all the medical reports for their child to see when he grew up.\n \u201cQiu-er, are you going out?\u201d Du Tingting noticed that Mu Qiu had changed and dressed up beautifully. She thought of her boyfriend.\n Is she going to meet her boyfriend?\n Mu Qiu nodded.\n But Mu Mian said, \u201cLet\u2019s have lunch first before going out. I will also be at home for lunch. After that, I still have to go to work.\u201d\n Thinking that it was also working hours for Cheng Yanmo, Mu Qiu agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s have lunch before I go out then.\u201d\n There was still one dish that was not cooked, so they still had to wait for a while before eating. Mu Qiu put down her bag and walked into the kitchen to get some water. She held her glass and looked at her happy parents in the living room. Her heart ached slightly.\n Auntie Zhang saw that Mu Qiu didn\u2019t look right and handed a plate of sliced dragon fruit to her. She said meaningfully, \u201cMiss, have some dragon fruit. I\u2019ve tried it, it\u2019s very sweet.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Auntie Zhang.\u201d Mu Qiu took a bite of the sweet fruit but her heart ached even more.\n \u201cMiss, cheer up. Don\u2019t think too much.\u201d Auntie Zhang had watched Mu Qiu grow up. How could Auntie Zhang not tell if she was happy?\n Holding back her tears, Mu Qiu glanced at Auntie Zhang and said softly, \u201cI am fine.\u201d She held back her tears and carried the dragon fruit to the living room.\n \u201cMother, have some fruit.\u201d Mu Qiu handed the fruit to Du Tingting.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Du Tingting took over the plate and stuffed a piece of dragon fruit into Mu Mian\u2019s mouth. She then took a piece for herself.\n Mu Qiu also took a piece. She had just taken a bite when she suddenly felt her lower body heat up. Her menstruation period had always been on time and it was definitely her period. \u201cI am going to the toilet.\u201d Mu Qiu threw down the dragonfruit and was about to go upstairs.\n Du Tingting said, \u201cWhy did you go upstairs? Isn\u2019t there a toilet downstairs?\u201d\n Mu Mian was standing by the side, so Mu Qiu mouthed to Du Tingting. \u201cI am on my period.\u201d\n Du Tingting understood what she meant. She remembered that she still had one bag in her room and told Mu Qiu. \u201cI have another bag in my room. You can have it. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Mu Qiu hurried upstairs.\n Mu Mian took another piece of fruit and said, \u201cHer tummy always hurts during her period. Why isn\u2019t it hurting this time?\u201d Mu Mian had a wife and daughter at home, so he knew all about women.\n Du Tingting said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always hurt.\u201d\n After a few minutes, Mu Qiu came down. She even took a few sanitary pads and stuffed them into her backpack.\n Auntie Zhang had prepared dinner and called them over.\n \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d Du Tingting\u2019s appetite had increased recently and she would get hungry easily.\n Mu Mian only ate a bowl of rice, before putting down his bowl and chopsticks. \u201cI am going to work now. See you tonight.\u201d He kissed Du Tingting, picked up his suit, draped it over his arm, and looked at Mu Qiu. \u201cCome back early tonight. You are not allowed to stay out.\u201d\n Knowing that Mu Qiu was in a relationship, Mu Mian would never allow her to stay out any longer.\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t even raise her head. She poked her chopsticks into her bowl before answering in a muffled voice. \u201cGot it.\u201d After Mu Mian left, Mu Qiu muttered softly. \u201cWhat era are we in now? He\u2019s still like this...\u201d\n When Du Tingting heard this, she gave Mu Qiu a meaningful look and pretended not to care. \u201cAre you going out to meet your boyfriend this afternoon?\u201d\n It would be strange if Du Tingting didn\u2019t know when Mu Mian knew about this. Mu Qiu didn\u2019t reply. She smiled mockingly. \u201cMother, are you trying to persuade me to break up with him?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was like a little hedgehog filled with thorns.\n She could tell that Mu Qiu was against it and clearly didn\u2019t want to discuss her relationship with her. Du Tingting didn\u2019t dare to agitate Mu Qiu. After all, her physical condition couldn\u2019t be affected.\n Shaking her head, Du Tingting said, \u201cNo, you are an adult now. You should know your limits.\u201d\n Limits...\n Mu Qiu\u2019s heart ached. She lowered her head and said, \u201cI know I am a dying person and have no right to be in a relationship. But Mother, I really like him a lot.\u201d She liked him so much that she lost all sense of propriety.\n Cheng Yanmo was outstanding, steady, and charismatic. A young and inexperienced girl like Mu Qiu would never be able to resist his allure.\n Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t bear for her to break up with Cheng Yanmo.\n \u201cThen...\u201d Du Tingting asked hesitantly,\u201d Does that child know about your physical condition? \u201d\n Mu Qiu nodded. \u201cHe knows. We talked about this before.\u201d\n Du Tingting frowned. She put down the spoon in her hand and asked hesitantly, \u201cThat child must be very outstanding, right?\u201d\n If hhe wasn\u2019t outstanding enough, Mu Qiu would never do such a foolish thing.\n Thinking of Cheng Yanmo, Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t help curling her lips. \u201cMmm, he\u2019s even more outstanding than father.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d In some ways, Du Tingting was Mu Mian\u2019s little fan. In her heart, Mu Mian was the most outstanding man.\n \u201cNever mind if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n Du Tingting suddenly stood up and said, \u201cWait a minute. I have a card with hundreds of thousands of dollars in it. You can spend it. It\u2019s very expensive to be in a relationship and you can\u2019t use too much money from boys.\u201d\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t refuse this time. She even pursed her lips in disdain and said in a low voice, \u201cA few hundred thousand yuan isn\u2019t enough. A simple meal at Deep Alley Restaurant costs several thousand yuan...\u201d\n Hearing that, Du Tingting didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. She scolded Mu Qiu jokingly. \u201cIt\u2019s already not bad if it\u2019s a few hundred thousand yuan, but you think it\u2019s too little! Do you have so much money that you can\u2019t use it all up? How can you go to Deep Alley for every meal?\u201d\n Even Du Tingting and Mu Mian would only go to Deep Alley for a meal on holidays and anniversaries. It wasn\u2019t that they couldn\u2019t afford it, but they just felt that a simple meal was not worth 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.\n Meanwhile, Mu Mian was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He had achieved his current position step by step and knew very well how difficult it was to make money. Although Mu Mian was not a stingy person, he was not the type to waste money.\n Mu Qiu smacked her lips and said, \u201cAlright, alright, my boyfriend and I will be having spicy hotpot every meal. We should be thrifty enough, right?\u201d\n Du Tingting was amused by Mu Qiu again. \u201cThe spicy soup is still not good enough. Eat KFC. I will go upstairs to get your card.\u201d Du Tingting went to the living room and took her bag along with the ultrasound picture.\n The incident that morning had disturbed Mu Qiu and made her lose her appetite. But as Du Tingting watched her, Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t just not eat. She was afraid that her mother would be worried.\n After Du Tingting left, Mu Qiu quickly pushed aside the bowl of rice and filled half a bowl with egg soup.\n The soup was very fresh. Mu Qiu took a few sips and looked up at Auntie Zhang who was eating in the kitchen. \u201cThis soup is good. Auntie Zhang, make this tomorrow again.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang smiled and replied, \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Mu Qiu added two spoonfuls of soup for herself. Just as she picked up the bowl and was about to bring it to her lips, she suddenly heard a shriek coming from the corridor.\n \u201cAh!!\u201d\n It was Du Tingting\u2019s shriek!\n Mu Qiu was so scared that her hands trembled. The bowl fell onto the table and soup splashed everywhere.\n In the kitchen, Auntie Zhang was the first to react. She threw down her cutlery and sprinted up the stairs. Her expression changed when she saw Du Tingting sprawled at the corner of the corridor. \u201cMadam, why did you fall? Are you alright?\u201d\n Hearing Auntie Zhang\u2019s words, Mu Qiu snapped out of her trance and hurried into the living room.\n Standing in the living room, Mu Qiu looked up and saw Du Tingting, who had fallen to the ground and had yet to get up. \u201cMother! How are you?\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s legs were slightly jelly and she forgot to go up to help Du Tingting.\n Du Tingting slowly lifted her head. She was still holding onto that bank card tightly. She frowned and was about to comfort Mu Qiu to say that she was fine when a warm current flowed out uncontrollably and drenched Du Tingting\u2019s legs.\n Thinking of something, Du Tingting\u2019s face turned pale. She reached out to touch her legs. When she raised her hand, both Mu Qiu and Auntie Zhang saw that her hand was blood-red!\n Mu Qiu covered her mouth.\n Du Tingting looked at her own blood-stained hands. She opened her mouth wide and only exclaimed after a long while. \u201cMy child!\u201d Du Tingting was so scared that she fainted. Meanwhile, her lower body was still bleeding profusely.\n \u201cMother!\u201d\n Mu Qiu hurriedly climbed up the stairs. In a moment of desperation, she even slipped and landed hard on her knees on the edge of the stairs. A sharp pain made Mu Qiu grunt.\n Mu Qiu ignored her knees. She got up and stumbled over to Du Tingting\u2019s side.\n Hugging Du Tingting, Mu Qiu didn\u2019t even dare to look at the blood under Du Tingting\u2019s body. With a pale face, she hollered at Auntie Zhang. \u201cAuntie Zhang, call the ambulance and my father!\u201d\n \u201cAlright, yes, yes!\u201d\n Auntie Zhang\u2019s hands were trembling as she called the ambulance.\n Annoyed that the hospital was taking too long, Mu Qiu got Auntie Zhang to carry Du Tingting into the car, while she drove Du Tingting to the hospital herself.\n Mu Qiu sped all the way. There were several times when she almost crashed into someone else\u2019s car, but she managed to avoid them safely. The car arrived at the bridge of the Great Dragon River before it encountered an ambulance.\n Mu Qiu stopped the car and asked the nurse to transfer Du Tingting to the ambulance. She followed Du Tingting into the car. Looking at Du Tingting\u2019s blood-stained lower body, Mu Qiu finally burst into tears.\n The doctor in the ambulance was trying his best to save Du Tingting. The nurse put on an oxygen mask for her and the doctor tried to stop her bleeding.\n Mu Qiu grabbed the nurse\u2019s pants tightly and begged her in tears. \u201cI beg you guys to save my mother. She is pregnant. Why is she bleeding so much? The blood just won\u2019t stop...\u201d\n The experienced nurse lowered her head and told Mu Qiu, \u201cYour mother is bleeding profusely. Young lady, be quiet. Don\u2019t cry. Your cries will disturb the doctor.\u201d\n Mu Qiu quickly covered her mouth with her bloodstained hand as tears streamed down her face.\n After a period of chaos, the ambulance finally arrived at the hospital. Du Tingting was immediately pushed into the emergency room.\n Mu Qiu was stopped outside the emergency room. She collapsed weakly against the wall, buried her head between her legs, and wept. Mu Mian hurried over and saw Mu Qiu sobbing bitterly. His head was buzzing.\n He took several deep breaths before walking up to Auntie Zhang, whose eyes were darting around. With a dark expression, he scolded her angrily. \u201cWhat happened?! Didn\u2019t I tell you to take good care of Madam?! How did you look after her?! How did Madam fall?!\u201d\n Mu Mian was enraged. Auntie Zhang was so scared that she didn\u2019t dare to speak.\n Mu Qiu wiped her tears and said weakly, \u201cFather.\u201d\n Mu Mian looked down at Mu Qiu and quickly suppressed his anger. He tried his best to speak to Mu Qiu amicably. \u201cQiu-er, tell me what happened.\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s lips quivered before she told Mu Mian, \u201cAfter you left, mother knew I was going on a date and was worried that I didn\u2019t have the money to use, so she went upstairs to get my bank card. Auntie Zhang and I were still eating when we suddenly heard mother scream and she rolled down the stairs.\u201d\n \u201cAuntie Zhang and I ran over and saw mother sprawled on the floor, bleeding profusely...\u201d\n \u201cNo one wants this to happen. Don\u2019t blame Auntie Zhang.\u201d\n That frightening scene surfaced in Mu Qiu\u2019s mind again. Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t hold back her tears anymore. She hurriedly wiped her tears and gazed worriedly at the emergency room. She clenched her fists and prayed for Du Tingting.\n Mu Mian scratched his head in frustration and squatted despondently at the door of the emergency room. His eyelids were twitching wildly.\n After a while, the doctor came out.\n Mu Mian and Mu Qiu rushed over immediately. Mu Mian grabbed the doctor\u2019s arm and asked, \u201cDoctor, how is my wife and child?\u201d\n The doctor shook his head and told Mu Mian, \u201cThe patient fell too hard and lost the baby on the spot. The patient bled profusely. Luckily, our hospital still has RH-negative blood in stock. Otherwise...\u201d Otherwise, he didn\u2019t dare to imagine the outcome.\n \u201cBut luckily, the patient is out of danger.\u201d The doctor patted Mu Mian\u2019s arm, took off his mask, and left.\n Mu Mian stood rooted to the ground like a wooden log.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s face turned even paler. She murmured. \u201cThe baby didn\u2019t survive...\u201d With Du Tingting in such a state, it would be strange if the baby could survive.\n However, Mu Qiu still felt somewhat sad when she heard the news.\n After a momentary daze, Mu Mian gradually regained his senses. He said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, as long as your mother is alright.\u201d\n He was also heartbroken that the child was gone, but Mu Mian was already satisfied that Du Tingting managed to stay alive.\n Mu Qiu nodded. She looked up at Mu Mian with teary eyes. \u201cFather, what should I tell Mother when she wakes up?\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s heart clenched painfully.\n He pulled Mu Qiu into his arms and said in a choked voice, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, your mother is alright. This is the greatest blessing. When she wakes up, I will tell her about the baby.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang\u2019s heart clenched as she watched from the side. She couldn\u2019t help feeling worried. If Madam woke up and knew that the child was gone, she would definitely be very upset.\n \u2013\n ]The Mu Family was in a mess, but Song Ci\u2019s side was peaceful.\n The wedding night was rather long and it was already past 11am by the time Song Ci woke up. She didn\u2019t see Han Zhan and calmly found her cell phone to call him.\n \u201cBrother Han, where are you? Don\u2019t tell me you went to work the day after getting married?\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled.\n That laughter was deep and melodious through the phone. Song Ci felt an itch at her ear.\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cSince you\u2019ve woken up, change your clothes and come down to the dining hall to have lunch with the elders. Godmothers and uncle will be leaving in the afternoon.\u201d\n As a result, this lunch was a family meal and also a thank-you meal.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Song Ci wanted to leave a good impression on her elders, so she changed into a lovely pink lacy dress. Looking at the gentle and lovely woman in the mirror, Song Ci broke into a smile and said to her, \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Mrs. Han.\u201d\n After being narcissistic, Song Ci went downstairs.\n She walked out of the lift and saw Han Zhan waiting for her in the corridor outside. \u201cYou\u2019re really good at sleeping.\u201d Han Zhan reached out, held Song Ci\u2019s hand, and pulled her into the private room.\n Song Ci shot Han Zhan an accusing look. \u201cWho are you blaming?\u201d\n \u201cYes, blame me for being too awesome.\u201d Han Zhan was rather shameless.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with him.\n The private room was very spacious. There was a huge dining table that was filled with 12 people. At the table, Han Zhan\u2019s godmother and Li Yao sat on the left side, while Song Ci\u2019s teacher, Shen Yubei, sat beside Di Rongrong.\n Dressed in a white qipao, Di Rongrong looked like a green lotus in the drizzle of June. She looked elegant and ethereal.\n Meanwhile, Shen Yubei was dressed in a light blue Chinese-style suit with a black jade hairpin fastened to his long hair. He looked very elegant, like a wealthy young master from the Republic of China.\n Shen Yubei was sitting there as Song Ci\u2019s family. Han Aoyu treated him the most kindly. He pulled him aside and chatted non-stop, asking all sorts of questions about Song Ci\u2019s childhood competitions.\n Shen Yubei answered them one by one with a respectful but fearless expression.\n With his calm and collected manner, no one would have expected a mischievous pair of high heels to be rubbing against his calves under the table.\n As that leg got increasingly unruly, Shen Yubei suddenly reached under the table with his right hand, grabbed that leg\u2019s owner\u2019s thigh, and squeezed.\n \u201cHiss!\u201d\n Di Rongrong suddenly took a deep breath, her expression twisted.\n Jin Luolan heard the commotion and turned to ask her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You look like you were bitten by a dog.\u201d\n Di Rongrong rubbed her own thigh and had no choice but to swallow her saliva. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I just kicked the table leg.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n Hearing this, a smile flashed across Shen Yubei\u2019s eyes.\n It was finally quiet under the table.\n On Han Aoyu\u2019s left was the Han Family members. Sitting beside Han Aoyu was an old man in his sixties. He was tall and strong, wearing glasses. He looked very righteous and majestic.\n This person was Han Aoyu\u2019s only nephew, Han Dongliang. He was also Han Wangwang\u2019s grandfather.\n Sitting beside Han Dongliang was a middle-aged man with the same features but much younger. He was Han Dongliang\u2019s son, Han Wanglong.\n He was Han Zhan\u2019s elder cousin, as well as Han Wangwang\u2019s father. He was the top political figure in Shunchen City.\n Han Wangwang and his brother Han Junjun were both there. The two juniors were playing with their phones. Han Wanglong hated seeing Han Wangwang\u2019s dirty pigtails the most. The day before yesterday, he had dragged Han Wangwang to Wangdong City\u2019s barbershop and straightened her dirty pigtails.\n The long-haired Han Wangwang looked much gentler and more obedient. However, no matter how well-dressed the young lady was, her soul was as hot as a little pepper.\n Han Wangwang\u2019s younger brother was called Han Junjun. He was only 17 years old and was a high school student.\n Han Junjun had short, clean hair. He was wearing a light grey, slim-fit shirt and had a face that was very similar to Han Wangwang\u2019s. He looked elegant and elegant, like a scholarly young master.\n Di Rongrong glanced at Han Junjun. \u201cJunjun is so handsome. He will definitely bring harm to many girls when he grows up.\u201d\n Han Junjun lowered his head in embarrassment.\n Shen Yubei sneered and said softly, \u201cMs. Di has such great taste. She will always love the young and handsome.\u201d That year, she couldn\u2019t resist flirting with the pure and adorable Shen Yubei at the concert, once she saw him.\n In the end, she stole Shen Yubei\u2019s heart, but she turned around and married Huo Jing-an.\n Shen Yubei naturally resented her.\n Di Rongrong was speechless.\n Han Aoyu could tell that the two of them seemed to have a personal grudge. He smiled and said, \u201cIn terms of being young and handsome, Yubei is the best amongst your peers.\u201d\n The 48-year-old Shen Yubei didn\u2019t look like an old man at all. Instead, he looked like an otherworldly fairy, and seemed very young.\n Shen Yubei felt slightly embarrassed at Han Aoyu\u2019s compliment.\n Di Rongrong looked at Shen Yubei\u2019s round, fair, and clean face. Her hand felt slightly itchy and she wanted to pinch it. But thinking of this person\u2019s vengeful personality, she gritted her teeth.\n Di Rongrong glanced at Shen Yubei\u2019s serious expression and said in a sarcastic manner, \u201cIn the past, I liked the younger ones. But now, I like the mature ones who are older than me.\u201d\n Shen Yubei put down her glass and retorted. \u201cIs that so? It\u2019s good to be mature, steady, energetic, understanding and devoted to women. You will always love 18-year-old young ladies.\u201d\n Apart from Jin Luolan, Mo Yao, and a few other insiders, everyone else was at a loss after hearing this. But they were no fools and could tell that Shen Yubei was mocking Di Rongrong.\n Many years ago, Shen Yubei had confessed to Di Rongrong, but she rejected him and chose Huo Jing-an, who was a year older than her.\n Huo Jing-an and his family worked in politics and were rather talented. They had all sorts of family backgrounds and knowledge. Most importantly, he knew women better than Shen Yubei. He knew how to fall in love and capture a woman\u2019s heart.\n After that, Di Rongrong and Huo Jing-an got married and had a daughter. But she wasn\u2019t very fortunate and she passed away during the confinement period. Due to the death of that daughter, their relationship broke down.\n In the fifth year after her daughter\u2019s death, Huo Jing-an had an affair with an 18-year-old young woman. As a result, Huo Jing-an was given the nickname \u201cHuo Eighteen\u201d by Mo Yao and the rest.\n Even so, out of consideration for the two families and their own reputations, the two of them maintained the relationship of husband and wife. Although they were husband and wife, their marriage relationship was only in name.\n Shen Yubei\u2019s move was so vicious that Di Rongrong\u2019s face turned pale.\n After saying that, Shen Yubei also felt slightly regretful. He was very frustrated but didn\u2019t know how to apologize. He just kept a straight face and continued drinking unhappily.\n As Han Zhan pulled Song Ci into the private room, he felt that something was off.\n He asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n Han Aoyu chuckled. \u201cI\u2019 m getting hungry waiting for you and Song Ci.\u201d\n Everyone laughed at Old Master\u2019s words.\n Yesterday, Han Zhan had already brought Song Ci to meet these elders. She also had a good memory and memorized their names and faces.\n Song Ci also felt that the atmosphere in the room was off. She quickly greeted everyone. \u201cHello, Grandpa, Uncle, Godmothers, Cousin, Teacher, Wangwang, Junjun...\u201d\n Song Ci admired herself.\n Song Ci would never lose to anyone in terms of who had the sweetest tongue.\n Please call me \u2014\n Sweetie Song!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "180": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-181\n\n Chapter 180: Go on a Date, Brother Han?  Everyone in the room looked at Song Ci with satisfaction and fondness.\n \u201cSong Song, sit down!\u201d Han Aoyu pointed at an empty chair. Han Zhan and Song Ci sat down together.\n Song Ci and the Mu Family had already drawn a line. As a result, no one from the Mu Family was at the table and no one would be foolish enough to bring this up. Everyone was present and the dishes were already served.\n The first dish was dessert and it was Song Ci\u2019s favorite coconut ball.\n Song Ci was about to pick up a coconut ball with chopsticks, when Shen Yubei reached out and fiddled with the rotating table. The coconut ball was transferred to Shen Yubei. Song Ci saw Shen Yubei pick up the roundest and most beautiful coconut ball and put it in his own bowl.\n Song Ci raised her brows.\n Doesn\u2019t Teacher hate sweet food the most? He said that he\u2019s sick of it.\n Han Zhan turned the plate of coconut balls to him. He took one and placed it in Song Ci\u2019s bowl. \u201cI specially ordered this for you. Our hotel\u2019s dessert is not bad. Try it.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci took a bite of coconut. It was indeed delicious. The coconut was fragrant, fragrant, soft, and not greasy. She ate one, looked up, and was about to take a second one when she saw Shen Yubei secretly placing the coconut on his plate onto Di Rongrong\u2019s plate while no one was looking.\n Meanwhile, Di Rongrong was scooping with her spoon and didn\u2019t notice Shen Yubei\u2019s petty actions.\n Song Ci was confused.\n Teacher is so cowardly!\n As Di Rongrong placed the steamed abalone on her plate, she noticed that a coconut ball had appeared on her clean, white plate.\n She stared at the coconut ball in a daze.\n She loved coconut balls the most, but it was too heaty and she was afraid of gaining weight. Moreover, Di Rongrong was a very strict person towards herself. She would only eat those once or twice a year.\n Not many people knew that she loved coconut balls. Apart from Mo Yao and Jin Luolan, there was only one... Shen Yubei.\n Di Rongrong glanced sideways at Shen Yubei.\n Shen Yubei had his head lowered as he ate his food with much focus, which made it even more suspicious. After much hesitation, Di Rongrong still ate the coconut ball.\n Shen Yubei secretly turned his head and saw that Di Rongrong had eaten his coconut ball. He was less upset and felt slightly better.\n After dinner, Mo Yao and Li Yao took their leave first. She still had to attend an international meeting overseas. After they left, Han Dongliang and his son chatted with Han Aoyu for a while before taking their leave.\n Jin Luolan was also very busy. Just as she was about to leave, Jin Luolan found Song Ci and asked her, \u201cYan Jiang went to Congo? Is this news accurate?\u201d\n Song Ci pursed her lips and nodded. She asked Jin Luolan in a small voice, \u201cGodmother, how is the situation over there now?\u201d\n Jin Luolan didn\u2019t hide it from Song Ci. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be chaotic for some time. But it\u2019s always like this over there. Tell Yan Jiang to be more careful.\u201d\n \u201cThank you Godmother.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll get going then.\u201d\n \u201cLet me send you off.\u201d Song Ci sent Jin Luolan off and returned to the dining room. She was about to push open the door and enter, when she saw her teacher and Di Rongrong sitting together. The two of them seemed to be talking and appeared rather intimate.\n Song Ci hurriedly turned and pulled Han Zhan away.\n Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cMy teacher is looking for a wife. Let\u2019s not be third wheels.\u201d\n \u201cA wife? Who?\u201d\n \u201cGodmother Rongrong!\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly shocked. I actually didn\u2019t know that Godmother Rongrong had an affair with Teacher Shen.\n Han Zhan brought Song Ci upstairs and found Han Aoyu. \u201cGrandpa, shall I send you back?\u201d\n Han Aoyu waved his hand and said, \u201cYou guys go ahead and play by yourselves. Don\u2019t worry about me. Your Uncle Zhong will send me back.\u201d\n Han Zhan agreed. He also had his own selfish motives. As newlyweds, he wanted to do something interesting with Song Ci.\n Pulling Song Ci out of Grandpa\u2019s room, Han Zhan hooked Song Ci\u2019s palm and said, \u201cDo you want to go on a date, Mrs. Han?\u201d\n This \u2018Mrs. Han\u2019 from Han Zhan was exceptionally seductive.\n Song Ci\u2019s heartbeat quickened slightly as she listened to him. She looked at Han Zhan with a faint smile, feeling very surprised. \u201cBrother Han, you actually know how to date?\u201d\n They had known each other for so long, registered their marriage certificate, held their wedding, and even had sex countless times. She had finally waited for the day when Han Zhan would initiate a date.\n How rare.\n Han Zhan felt slightly guilty. He admitted that he was unromantic and that his life was too boring, but he would learn to interact with the young Song Ci.\n Han Zhan hooked Song Ci\u2019s palm again and asked, \u201cSo, date?\u201d\n Song Ci tiptoed and hooked her arms around Han Zhan\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s a date!\u201d\n Song Ci was serious about her date.\n She even wrote down a set of dating tips.\n Handing the notebook to Han Zhan, Song Ci told him, \u201cBrother Han has not been in a relationship for so many years and probably doesn\u2019t know how youngsters like us date. Here, I\u2019ve written down all the details on the card. Brother Han, take a look carefully. If you act according to this, nothing will be missing.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down and read the contents of the card seriously.\n First Date Battle Tips:\n One: Wearing couple outfits with Song Ci.\n Two: Have ice cream with Song Ci.\n Three: Carry Song Ci for half an hour on the banks of the Yulong River.\n Four: Watch the sunset together with Song Ci and kiss under the setting sun.\n Five: Have a romantic dinner with Song Ci.\n Six: When watching a movie with Song Ci, you must buy bubble tea and popcorn.\n Han Zhan held the card and smiled as if a huge burden had been lifted from his shoulders. \u201cI was worried at first and didn\u2019t know what to do with you on a date. Baby Ci, I really like this dating strategy of yours.\u201d\n \u201cI am a considerate Baby Ci.\u201d\n After finalizing the details of the date, Song Ci changed into casual clothes and went out with Han Zhan. She wore black denim pencil pants and a red and black checkered long-sleeved shirt. With her long hair tied up, she looked very young.\n Han Zhan was originally dressed very casually. Seeing how young and beautiful Song Ci was, he quietly walked into the cloakroom and sized up his own clothes worriedly.\n With his age and status, Han Zhan\u2019s suit was in a low-profile elite style, while his casual clothes were mostly comfortable sportswear. He also had a few casual shirts, but he looked old and vigorous.\n For the first time, Han Zhan realized that it was time for him to buy clothes.\n Han Zhan searched through all the clothes in the wardrobe and finally found a gray, high-collared, thin sweater that didn\u2019t look that old. After changing, he stood in front of the mirror and stared at the man with a casual expression inside, feeling unfamiliar.\n Song Ci was downstairs drinking hot tea and eating nuts. Finally, she heard Brother Han\u2019s footsteps coming down the stairs. Song Ci turned her head and complained. \u201cMy Brother Han, you are finally done. You dragged for so long, I thought you were putting on makeup...\u201d\n After seeing Han Zhan\u2019s attire, Song Ci started whistling like a hooligan. \u201cNot bad, Senior Han.\u201d\n A pair of black jeans and a grey, loose-fitting sweater were draped over the 1.89m tall Han Zhan. He was still the mature, low-profile, and manly Han Zhan, but youthful vigor was added to this mature man.\n Like a senior who was well-educated and well-mannered in university.\n Han Zhan blushed slightly at this \u2018Senior Han\u2019. He walked up to Song Ci, touched his nose uncomfortably, and asked her, \u201cIsn\u2019t it strange to wear this?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not.\u201d Song Ci walked over and touched Han Zhan\u2019s chest, looking like a little fan girl with infatuated eyes. \u201cBrother Han is so handsome in this outfit. In the future, you must wear this whenever it\u2019s not working hours.\u201d\n With this dressing, even an old man would look like Brother Qiao.\n Han Zhan lifted his leg and said, \u201cIt has been a few years since I last wore jeans. I feel awkward.\u201d\n \u201cLooks good.\u201d Staring at Han Zhan\u2019s long, slender, and powerful legs, Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist touching them again. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d\n The two of them drove the Aoyu Number 1 to the first stop of their date \u2014\n Buying couple outfits!\n It was rather chilly to be wearing t-shirts in this season, and the clothing stores all put on long-sleeved outfits. In the end, Han Zhan chose two zip-up jackets, one red and one white. On it was written:\n Love China!\n Song Ci\u2019s expression froze for a few seconds when she received the couple outfit.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with it. He said, \u201cI looked at everything, and this set of couple outfits is the most proper. The other outfits all have rather stupid designs.\u201d Things like \u2018my wife is beautiful\u2019, \u2018my husband is handsome\u2019, \u2018left, my pig \u2018,\u2019right, a wealthy pig farmer\u2019...\n In Han Zhan\u2019s eyes, only a lunatic would wear those clothes.\n Song Ci took a deep breath and praised Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han is a righteous and socialist young man. Not bad.\u201d She took off her shirt and put on that red jacket. She also put on the white jacket for Han Zhan. Only then did the two of them leave the store.\n It was the first time Han Zhan was wearing a couple\u2019s outfit and he felt slightly embarrassed.\n Walking out of the store, his strides were especially big, as if he was afraid of being looked at. Song Ci chased after him. \u201cHan Zhan, you can\u2019t bully me just because your legs are long. Wait for me.\u201d\n Han Zhan stopped and held Song Ci\u2019s hand as they walked towards the ice cream shop. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up. Otherwise, these people will keep staring at us.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we are good looking. Every look counts.\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head and said helplessly, \u201cYou are so thick-skinned.\u201d\n A long queue formed at the entrance of the ice cream shop. Han Zhan pulled Song Ci to the back. Song Ci leaned on his arm and said, \u201cBrother Han, buy the biggest one. I like the big one.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cMmm, I know you like big ones.\u201d\n Song Ci blinked. She felt that there was something off with his words and decided not to say anything else. 20 minutes later, it was Han Zhan\u2019s turn. He said to the young man, \u201cGive me the smallest ice cream.\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly tugged at Han Zhan. \u201cThe biggest!\u201d\n \u201cSmallest, don\u2019t eat cold food.\u201d He was very determined. It was useless even if Song Ci whined.\n In the end, Han Zhan really bought the smallest ice cream. He handed it to Song Ci. \u201cHave it all.\u201d\n Song Ci stared at the ice cream that was only the size of a baby\u2019s fist and wanted to bite Han Zhan. \u201cHow can I eat it alone? We agreed to eat it together.\u201d\n Song Ci pulled Han Zhan over to a wooden chair and sat down. She couldn\u2019t bear to finish her ice cream in one bite, so she used a spoon to scrape it off bit by bit, as if she could eat this for a long time.\n Han Zhan was amused by her pitiful look. \u201cIs that really necessary? I\u2019ll give them all to you, alright?\u201d Han Zhan threw his spoon into the dustbin.\n Song Ci looked at Han Zhan and then at the ice cream. She tried to resist but couldn\u2019t. She took the ice cream and finished it in a few bites.\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes dimmed as he stared at the white foam at the corners of Song Ci\u2019s lips. Taking advantage of the moment when no one was looking, he hugged Song Ci\u2019s face and leaned over to lick the foam clean.\n Only when Han Zhan released her did Song Ci snap out of her trance. She asked leisurely, \u201cBrother Han, is it exciting to secretly kiss a teenage girl on the streets?\u201d\n Han Zhan savored the taste and nodded. \u201cExciting!\u201d\n \u201cOld hooligan!\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s cell phone suddenly rang. \u201cLet me take a call.\u201d\n She took out her cell phone and saw that it was Mu Qiu calling. \u201cIt\u2019s Mu Qiu.\u201d After informing Han Zhan, Song Ci answered the call in front of him.\n Amidst the commotion on the streets, Han Zhan didn\u2019t hear clearly what Mu Qiu said. Instead, he saw Song Ci\u2019s expression turn grave.\n After Song Ci hung up, Han Zhan reached out a finger and pushed Song Ci\u2019s shoulder. He asked worriedly, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n Song Ci slowly turned back, looked at Han Zhan in a daze, and said rather despondently, \u201cMother fell and suffered a major hemorrhage. She is still in the hospital and has not woken up...\u201d Just like in her previous life, Du Tingting\u2019s child was not saved in this life.\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan was not at all shocked. It was as if the entire Mu Family residence collapsing overnight after being struck by lightning was only natural, as the heavens were taking in demons.\n Han Zhan pulled Song Ci\u2019s hand and stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital to take a look. We will continue our date another day.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n It was already evening by the time the two of them arrived at the hospital. The smell of rice wafted along the corridor. The two of them found Du Tingting\u2019s ward and knocked on the door.\n Auntie Zhang opened the door and saw Song Ci and Han Zhan outside. She hurriedly closed the door, walked out, and said softly, \u201cMs. Song, Mr. Han, you guys are here.\u201d\n \u201cAuntie Zhang, how is my mother now?\u201d\n Auntie Zhang shook her head worriedly. She suppressed her voice and said, \u201cMadam just woke up and Sir has already told Madam about that child. Madam is feeling very upset now and is crying alone.\u201d\n \u201cFather is inside?\u201d Song Ci asked.\n Auntie Zhang nodded.\n Song Ci thought for a moment, grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s hand, and said to Auntie Zhang, \u201cLet\u2019s go downstairs and wait. After Father leaves, Auntie Zhang, inform me again, and I\u2019ll come up.\u201d\n Knowing that Song Ci and Mu Mian didn\u2019t get along, Auntie Zhang hurriedly said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci and her husband went downstairs and Auntie Zhang returned to the room. Seeing that Du Tingting\u2019s face was covered in tears and that some of her tears were even dripping down her neck, Auntie Zhang hurriedly fetched a basin of hot water.\n She wrung the towel dry and handed it to Mu Mian. Mu Mian nodded at her, took the towel, walked to the bed, and silently wiped Du Tingting\u2019s tears.\n \u201cTingting.\u201d Mu Mian returned the towel to Auntie Zhang. He held Du Tingting\u2019s hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be like this Tingting. It\u2019s not your fault that the child is gone. It\u2019s the greatest blessing that you are alright.\u201d\n Du Tingting bit her lips and suppressed her sobs.\n She held Mu Mian\u2019s hand tightly and continued sobbing. \u201cI just saw his first ultrasound image and he has already taken form. He is a human now. He was still in my tummy in the morning but in the blink of an eye... Hubby, I feel so terrible!\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s eyes reddened at her words.\n The husband and wife looked forward to the arrival of this child at an old age. Mu Mian also felt very pained that the child was gone just like that. But with Du Tingting\u2019s current situation, Mu Mian was not allowed to continue grieving over the child.\n \u201cTingting, you must pull yourself together.\u201d Unable to persuade Du Tingting, Mu Mian had no choice but to bring up Mu Qiu. \u201cTingting, you don\u2019t know how scared Qiu-er was after you fell. In order to save you, Qiu-er personally drove you to the hospital and ran all the way through the red lights. There were several times when she nearly crashed into someone.\u201d\n \u201cQiu-er cried so hard when she heard that you were successfully saved but lost the baby. She didn\u2019t dare to come and see you and felt that it was her fault that you fell. She told me that if you didn\u2019t go upstairs to get her a card, you wouldn\u2019t have fallen...\u201d\n Du Tingting listened in a daze. Her heart ached at the thought of Mu Qiu. \u201cHow could this be her fault?\u201d\n Knowing how fragile Mu Qiu was, Du Tingting quickly said to Mu Mian, \u201cWhere is that child now? Quickly get her to come.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I met her just now, she was crying quietly in the stairwell alone.\u201d\n Du Tingting pushed Mu Mian\u2019s arm and urged him. \u201cMu Qiu cannot be agitated and her emotions cannot be affected too much. Quickly go and call her over. Tell her I don\u2019t blame her.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mu Mian walked straight to the staircase landing.\n Mu Qiu was sitting on the staircase with her head lowered. She didn\u2019t say a word.\n \u201cQiu-er.\u201d\n Mu Qiu looked up at Mu Mian, her eyes swollen like peaches.\n Mu Mian walked over and stroked Mu Qiu\u2019s hair. \u201cYour mother asked you to come in. Go in and chat with her for a while.\u201d\n \u201c... Mm.\u201d\n Mu Qiu walked into the ward uneasily. She felt even more guilty when she saw the haggard Du Tingting. She pursed her lips before calling out hoarsely, \u201cMother...\u201d\n Du Tingting raised her weak hand and waved at her. \u201cCome over, Qiu-er. I am fine.\u201d In order to control Mu Qiu\u2019s emotions, Du Tingting had to suppress her sadness and put on a calm expression.\n Mu Qiu then jogged over and hugged Du Tingting. \u201cMother, it\u2019s all my fault. If not for me, nothing would have happened to you...\u201d\n Mu Qiu kept crying. She didn\u2019t dare to mention that child for fear of making Du Tingting sad.\n ]\u201dI don\u2019t blame you. How can I blame you?\u201d Du Tingting took out a few soft tissues from the cupboard beside the bed and wiped Mu Qiu\u2019s tears.\n Mu Qiu hung her head, feeling frustrated and upset.\n Du Tingting straightened her face and greeted Mu Qiu. \u201cMu Qiu.\u201d\n Mu Qiu wiped her eyes and looked at Du Tingting.\n \u201cQiu-er, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong today. Mother was careless. I knew I had to be careful going down the stairs but I still didn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n Du Tingting had a habit of climbing stairs. She liked to walk in the middle and not the sides. As a pregnant woman, she should have been very careful. She should have held onto the wall or the railing as she went up and down the stairs.\n \u201cI was careless. I accidentally stepped on air and fell. Qiu-er, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Don\u2019t feel sorry for me.\u201d\n Tugging at Mu Qiu\u2019s hand, Du Tingting felt that her fingers were cold and covered them with her own. \u201cI heard from your father that you nearly got into an accident while trying to save me. You saved my life, Qiu-er. I have to thank you.\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Qiu hurriedly shook her head. As a child, it was only right for her to do her best to save her mother when she was in trouble.\n \u201cMother, you scared me to death today. I thought I would lose you.\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s legs went weak at the thought of her mother covered in blood.\n Du Tingting saw that Mu Qiu was really scared. She smiled weakly and comforted Mu Qiu. \u201cLook, isn\u2019t Mother alright? I just bled too much and will recover after some rest.\u201d\n Under Du Tingting\u2019s comforting words, Mu Qiu finally calmed down and stopped beating around the bush.\n \u201cOh yes, Mother, Elder Sister and Brother-in-law are also here. They don\u2019t wish to meet Father and are waiting downstairs.\u201d Mu Qiu was the one who called Song Ci about Du Tingting\u2019s miscarriage. After Song Ci arrived at the hospital, she went to look for Mu Qiu.\n Du Tingting instinctively looked at Mu Mian.\n Mu Mian couldn\u2019t resist Du Tingting\u2019s teary eyes. \u201cAlright, I will go out.\u201d Mu Mian left without hesitation.\n After Mu Mian left, Du Tingting said to Mu Qiu, \u201cQiu-er, call your Elder Sister and the rest up.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mu Qiu took out her cell phone and called Song Ci to inform them to come up.\n Shortly after, Song Ci and Han Zhan arrived with many nutrients in their hands.\n Han Zhan put down the nutrients and walked to the side of the bed. He called Du Tingting \u201cMother\u201d and advised her to let it go, before leaving the ward.\n Only the three of them were left in the room. Song Ci sat down beside Mu Qiu. She saw that Du Tingting\u2019s face was pale and couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cMother, you\u2019ve suffered this time.\u201d\n Du Tingting almost cried again, but she held it in.\n \u201cIt\u2019s already very fortunate that I managed to survive. That child and I...\u201d Du Tingting touched her lower abdomen gently and choked.\u201d It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have the fortune and fate to be together. \u201d\n Song Ci comforted Du Tingting. \u201cThe little kid must have forgotten something and went back to get it. He will return after he finds it.\u201d\n Du Tingting forced a smile. \u201cI am no longer a young lady. How can I get pregnant just like that? Moreover, I don\u2019t wish to have another child. The arrival of this child was an accident.\u201d\n The existence of this child was already unfair to Mu Qiu. Now that she had an accidental miscarriage, Du Tingting would never have another child.\n Hearing Du Tingting\u2019s words, Mu Qiu said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting another one. You guys are old and need a child to accompany you for me to be at ease.\u201d\n Song Ci glanced at Mu Qiu out of the corner of her eye. Noticing her sincere expression, she remained silent.\n Du Tingting shook her head at Mu Qiu. \u201cNo, you are enough for us.\u201d\n \u201cBut I...\u201d Mu Qiu tilted her head and looked elsewhere. She sighed softly.\u201d How many more days can I accompany you guys? \u201cHer heart attack this morning was a wake-up call to remind her to finish her unfinished work as soon as possible and to leave without any regrets.\n Du Tingting was at a loss for words and felt very depressed.\n The atmosphere was tense and everyone remained silent.\n Song Ci was the first to break the silence. \u201cMother, you don\u2019t have any clothes to change into, right? Shall I go back and get you some clothes?\u201d\n Du Tingting suddenly suffered a major hemorrhage. Mu Qiu and Auntie Zhang were in a hurry to send Du Tingting to the emergency ward and didn\u2019t have time to get her clothes. She was still wearing the hospital\u2019s clothes.\n Du Tingting\u2019s body was very delicate and she was slightly allergic to the hospital\u2019s hospital gown, and would even get rashes. Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Du Tingting felt an itch all over her body.\n \u201cI just feel that this body is very itchy.\u201d Du Tingting scratched her shoulder and said to Song Ci, \u201cAlso, bring me a set of clean bedsheets and the mite remover at home. I am not used to sleeping with these bedsheets at the hospital.\u201d\n Du Tingting was already a little princess when she was still a girl in her maternal family. After marrying Mu Mian, she led a rather poor life for the first few years, but she was still carefree. After Mu Mian succeeded in life, Du Tingting rarely even entered the kitchen.\n It was understandable for a woman who had been pampered her entire life to be slightly pretentious.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci got up and was about to leave when Du Tingting suddenly looked at Mu Qiu. \u201cQiu-er, go back with Elder Sister. You need to rest and can\u2019t stay here tonight.\u201d\n Mu Qiu instinctively shook her head. \u201cNo!\u201d She was worried about Du Tingting and wanted to accompany her. \u201cI am fine. I want to stay here to accompany you and talk to you. It will be good for me to relieve my boredom.\u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s face darkened. \u201cListen to me!\u201d\n Mu Mian pushed open the door and entered. He overheard the mother-daughter duo\u2019s conversation and said to Mu Qiu, \u201cQiu-er, go back with your Elder Sister. Have a good rest tonight and don\u2019t come over again.\u201d\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t dare to go against Mu Mian\u2019s wishes. Although Mu Mian doted on her, Mu Qiu didn\u2019t dare to rebel when he gave the order.\n \u201cWhat about you, Father? Will you stay here to accompany Mother?\u201d\n \u201cOf course I will be here with your mother.\u201d\n Only then did Mu Qiu agree to go home.\n Song Ci and Mu Qiu walked out of the ward. She saw Han Zhan standing at the end of the corridor on the phone, waiting for him.\n Han Zhan turned around and saw Song Ci and Mu Qiu. He spoke a few words to the person on the other end of the call before hanging up. Han Zhan strode over and asked Song Ci, \u201cYou\u2019re out so soon? Why didn\u2019t you chat for a while more?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll go get some clothes for Mother.\u201d Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, are you sending me there?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll send you.\u201d\n On the way back, Han Zhan drove while Song Ci and Mu Qiu sat in the back. Mu Qiu\u2019s makeup was very light now, revealing her original pale skin.\n Song Ci noticed that she looked pale and asked, \u201cYou look very weak. Are you feeling unwell?\u201d\n Mu Qiu nodded hesitantly. \u201cI suddenly suffered a arrhythmia this morning. I don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d\n Song Ci had mixed feelings as she gazed at Mu Qiu\u2019s youthful face. For a moment, she thought of letting go of her hatred.\n \u201cI heard from Mom that Song Fei went to Congo.\u201d Mu Qiu suddenly mentioned Song Fei.\n Hearing this, all the pity in Song Ci\u2019s heart dissipated. She acknowledged and said, \u201cShe\u2019s been gone for more than a month.\u201d\n Mu Qiu added. \u201cIt must be very chaotic in Congo. I saw the news report that there are frequent instances of civil unrest there and many people have died.\u201d\n Song Ci narrowed her eyes. She didn\u2019t speak but just stared at Mu Qiu meaningfully. After a while, Song Ci looked away. She casually picked up the thermos and opened the cap.\n Taking a sip of hot water, Song Ci said, \u201cThat was Song Fei\u2019s own choice. Even if anything happens, it\u2019s her life.\u201d\n Mu Qiu turned to look at Song Ci. \u201cYou really think so? Aren\u2019t you worried about Song Fei?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cOf course I am worried. But Song Fei said that being a virus specialist is her dream. She is so smart and should be doing good for the country and mankind. I cannot stop her.\u201d\n Mu Qiu admired Song Fei slightly. She leaned against the glass window and sighed. \u201cI envy her so much. She is so unrestrained and can do whatever she wants.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be envious about? That job of hers is filled with danger and not so easy to do. Every time she faces a patient, she will be tightly wrapped up, warm and stuffy.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n Arriving at the Mu Family residence, Mu Qiu and Song Ci helped Du Tingting pack her clothes.\n \u201cWhere are the sheets? Which one should we take?\u201d Song Ci asked Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cThere\u2019s a set of pink daisies. Mother especially likes that set. I\u2019ll go look for it.\u201d Mu Qiu squatted down in front of the cupboard to search for the bedsheets, while Song Ci searched for the mite remover.\n She searched the cupboard beside the bed but couldn\u2019t find the dispenser. Song Ci asked Mu Qiu, \u201cI don\u2019t see the remover. Do you know where it is?\u201d\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t even look up. She said, \u201cIt might be in the toolbox downstairs. Auntie Zhang usually does the cleaning at home. She also uses the mite remover.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll go down and get it then.\u201d\n ]Song Ci went downstairs and found the mite remover in the cupboard by the door of the housekeeper\u2019s room. She took the remover upstairs, but wasn\u2019t paying attention as she was climbing up the stairs. She slipped and fell flat on her face.\n Song Ci slowly sat up and hugged her aching leg. She gritted her teeth and called out to Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, Brother Han, I fell and injured myself.\u201d\n Han Zhan was feeding the koi fish in the Mu Family courtyard. Hearing the commotion, he put down his plate, turned around, and ran into the house.\n Carrying Song Ci up and placing her on the sofa, Han Zhan pulled up Song Ci\u2019s jeans. Those little pants were too tight and the material squeezed onto Song Ci\u2019s wound during the process. She couldn\u2019t help but gasp.\n Han Zhan\u2019s actions were gentler, but he reprimanded her. \u201cWhy are you wearing such tight pants? Are you afraid that others won\u2019t know that your legs are long and thin?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head and didn\u2019t continue bantering with her.\n A purplish bruise appeared on Song Ci\u2019s calf, but it was not a big problem. She didn\u2019t hurt her bone. \u201cI will give you some ointment later. It won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll go upstairs to get some stuff. Wait for me here.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan arrived at the door of the master bedroom on the second floor and walked in without knocking. Mu Qiu had already packed her things. Thinking that it was Song Ci, she said without turning back, \u201cSister, everything is packed.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, let me take it.\u201d\n A man\u2019s voice suddenly sounded from behind, which shocked Mu Qiu. She turned around and stared at Han Zhan in astonishment. \u201cBrother-in-law, it\u2019s you. Where\u2019s my Elder Sister?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cShe accidentally knocked herself on the stairs and injured her calf. She\u2019s resting downstairs. Where is the stuff?\u201d\n Mu Qiu pointed at the two LV bags on the floor. \u201cTake both bags.\u201d\n Han Zhan bent down and easily lifted up two big bags with one hand. He carried the bags out and Mu Qiu followed behind him. She asked, \u201cIs Elder Sister alright?\u201d\n \u201cHer injuries aren\u2019t serious.\u201d\n Just when they were about to reach the staircase landing, Han Zhan suddenly stopped in his tracks.\n Mu Qiu kept walking with her head down and didn\u2019t notice that Han Zhan had stopped and her head bumped into his back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother-in-law.\u201d\n Mu Qiu rubbed her forehead and took a step back. She looked up at Han Zhan in front of her and didn\u2019t know why he suddenly stopped.\n Han Zhan walked to the corridor and stared at the wooden staircase. He suddenly said, \u201cYour staircase is rather smooth. Two people fell consecutively within a day.\u201d\n Mu Qiu looked at the corridor in confusion. \u201cReally? I did fall a few times in the past, but I paid more attention later and never fell again.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at her and said, \u201cThere will always be times when one is careless.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Downstairs, Han Zhan squatted down in front of Song Ci and faced her with his broad and muscular back. \u201cCome up.\u201d\n Song Ci saw that Han Zhan was carrying two bags and couldn\u2019t bear to push him down. \u201cI can walk myself.\u201d\n \u201cCarrying you is like carrying a toddler.\u201d Han Zhan put down his bag, grabbed Song Ci\u2019s legs, and carried her on his back. \u201cHold on tight.\u201d\n Han Zhan carried his bag with one hand and supported Song Ci\u2019s thigh with the other. He walked out of the main door.\n Song Ci wrapped her arms around Han Zhan\u2019s neck and wrapped her legs around his waist. \u201cHave I gained weight?\u201d\n Han Zhan replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Han Zhan suddenly apologized.\n Song Ci was puzzled. \u201cWhy are you apologizing to me?\u201d\n Han Zhan explained. \u201cI was supposed to have a perfect date with you today. I haven\u2019t carried you on a stroll by the river, watched the sunset together, had a romantic meal, watched a movie, and kissed you goodnight.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Song Ci rubbed her cheek against Han Zhan\u2019s short hair and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you carrying me now? It can be considered as completing the date of carrying me around.\u201d\n \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve wronged you.\u201d The first date had left Han Zhan with some regrets. He was thinking of finding another opportunity to make up for Song Ci\u2019s perfect date.\n When they were about to reach the car, Song Ci suddenly called out in a low voice. \u201cBrother Han.\u201d\n Han Zhan replied, \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with that staircase.\u201d\n Han Zhan paused slightly and didn\u2019t seem surprised. He acknowledged and continued walking towards the car.\n After putting Song Ci down, Han Zhan stuffed the items into the boot. He watched as Song Ci settled herself in the passenger seat and fastened her seatbelt. Only then did Han Zhan get into the driver\u2019s seat.\n The car drove out of the Mu Family villa and they could see the majestic gates of the Amethyst Gated Community. Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat did you discover?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cAuntie Zhang said that Mother accidentally fell down the stairs and didn\u2019t stop until she reached the corner platform.\u201d\n \u201cSo, Mother fell down on the stairs between the second and first level. I went up just now and purposely walked in the middle, and I fell.\u201d\n \u201cWalk in the middle?\u201d Han Zhan noticed something strange and asked, \u201cWhy did you walk in the middle?\u201d\n Song Ci gazed at the front of the car. She seemed to be shivering. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s because Mother always goes up and down the stairs in the middle.\u201d Only those closest to her would remember these details.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "181": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-182\n\n Chapter 181: The Truth Revealed a Scary Heart  Who is the person who knows Du Tingting the best? Who is the person who has the greatest reason to take the risk to hurt her?\n Without a doubt, it was Mu Qiu.\n Song Ci calmed down very quickly. She told Han Zhan, \u201cI installed surveillance cameras at the Mu Family residence. I will check the surveillance cameras again when we get back later. If my guess is right, the surveillance cameras will definitely have something that will shock us.\u201d\n Song Ci looked very calm, but her heart had already turned cold.\n She desperately hoped that her deduction was wrong. If it was, it meant that Mu Qiu still had some conscience. If her guess was confirmed, then Mu Qiu\u2019s intentions were too vicious.\n It was said that daughters were the apple of their parents\u2019 eyes, but there were sharp needles hidden inside!\n Only then did Han Zhan tell Song Ci, \u201cWhen I went downstairs just now, I tried to test Mu Qiu\u2019s reaction. But her reaction was too natural. It could be said to be watertight.\u201d\n At the mention of Mu Qiu, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help frowning. \u201cEither she is innocent, or she has a strong mental fortitude.\u201d\n How strong must one\u2019s mental fortitude be to be able to remain calm even after nearly killing one\u2019s own mother?\n \u201cVicious heart. Pft.\u201d\n Song Ci deeply approved of Han Zhan\u2019s malicious comments.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help recalling the scene before her death in her previous life. The beautiful and innocent Mu Qiu placed her hand on her chest, tilted her head, and said the most vicious and evil words in her most innocent voice. \u201cElder Sister, can you give me your heart?\u201d\n Song Ci felt a dull pain in her chest and couldn\u2019t catch her breath. Sensing Song Ci\u2019s abnormality, Han Zhan hurriedly supported her body and reminded her. \u201cTake a deep breath!\u201d\n Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm and took a deep breath. Only then did she feel slightly better.\n Seeing that Song Ci had finally caught her breath, Han Zhan joked. \u201cDon\u2019t think about those unhappy things. If you\u2019re in a bad mood, think about your Brother Han more.\u201d\n Song Ci turned to look at Brother Han\u2019s face and nodded. \u201cMmm, Brother Han is handsome, elegant, rich, and handsome. My world is lit up just by looking at you!\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n He chose to be deaf and focused on driving.\n After parking the car below the hospital, Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s hand and brought her to the inpatient ward to bring the bedsheets and clothes over to Du Tingting.\n \u201cSorry to trouble you guys.\u201d It had only taken Song Ci two hours from the time she left the hospital to the time she arrived at the Mu Family residence. They must have not eaten yet.\n Du Tingting said to Song Ci, \u201cYou guys haven\u2019t had dinner yet, right? I\u2019ll get your father to bring you guys out for dinner.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cLet Father stay here with you. Don\u2019t worry about us.\u201d Song Ci tucked Du Tingting in and patted her shoulder to comfort her. \u201cYou need to rest after losing too much blood. Mother, don\u2019t lose sleep again.\u201d\n \u201cI have a friend from Shandong. I asked her to send some gelatin over. I heard that the gelatin there is good for nourishing blood. I will send it over to you then.\u201d\n Gazing at Du Tingting\u2019s pale face, Song Ci couldn\u2019t help feeling sad for her. If today\u2019s incident wasn\u2019t just an accident but was caused by Mu Qiu, then as a mother, Du Tingting would be so pitiful!\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart warmed at his words. \u201cThat\u2019s very thoughtful of you.\u201d It was already past 7pm. Worried that Song Ci and Han Zhan would go hungry, Du Tingting said, \u201cYou guys go and eat. I have your father with me. It will be fine.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll get going then.\u201d\n It started to rain at some point.\n As the rain continued to fall, the car lights shone brightly on the drizzle, giving it a dreamy beauty. Song Ci and Han Zhan strolled through the drizzle.\n Song Ci suddenly stopped in her tracks and turned to look at Han Zhan. She felt like this scene was very familiar.\n Han Zhan was fishing for his car keys when he looked up and saw Song Ci staring at him lovingly. He was slightly stunned and asked her, \u201cWhy are you suddenly looking at me like that?\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cThe first time I met you was on such a rainy day.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were filled with shock.\n \u201cWhen?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled. \u201cWhen I was 24 years old.\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned.\n But he immediately realized that Song Ci was referring to her previous life. \u201cI haven\u2019t asked you. Do we know each other in our previous life?\u201d\n \u201cWe do.\u201d\n ]Han Zhan found it very intriguing. He thought that Song Ci knew him because of his status as the richest man in Dongcheng City. Now it seemed like he had guessed wrongly.\n \u201cHow\u2019s our relationship?\u201d\n Anticipation grew in Han Zhan\u2019s heart, but he didn\u2019t know what answer he wanted to hear.\n Song Ci smiled slightly and said, \u201cWhat can I do? You are the high and mighty Mr. Rich Man, and I am the wife of the useless Second Young Master of the Cheng Family. What can we do?\u201d\n Before that hijacking incident, Han Zhan and Song Ci had never interacted. It wouldn\u2019t be right to say that they had never interacted. Song Ci had actually seen Han Zhan before, but only from afar.\n It was a memory so distant that even Song Ci had nearly forgotten it.\n Song Ci said, \u201cWhen I was 24 years old, I had just married into the Cheng Family. One morning, I was having a morning jog at the hill behind the Cheng Family residence as usual.\u201d\n Han Zhan could guess where Song Ci had met him.\n ]As he guessed, Song Ci said, \u201cThere\u2019s a forest villa on the hill behind. It looks uninhabited. That morning, I passed by the villa and heard a man\u2019s voice. I stood at the villa\u2019s entrance and looked inside. I saw you through the gap of the metal door.\u201d\n Song Ci sank into that distant memory. She said in a low voice, \u201cThat morning, it was also raining lightly, just like now. You were wearing an azure shirt and standing in the yard with your back facing me. You were holding a bottle in one hand and a phone in the other.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, I felt that your back view was rather tall and handsome and couldn\u2019t resist taking a few more glances. But you noticed me. You turned your head and stared at me through the rain.\u201d\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t remember any of the things that Song Ci said. He was clearly the male lead in the story, but he felt like he was listening to a stranger and Song Ci\u2019s story.\n He asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat was my reaction then?\u201d\n Song Ci shrugged. \u201cWhat kind of reaction can you have? We don\u2019t know each other, so you treated me like a stranger and turned to enter the house.\u201d\n Han Zhan believed her.\n \u201cGet in the car, my hair is all wet.\u201d Song Ci urged Han Zhan into the car. She sat in the passenger seat and stared at the hazy drizzle in front of the car.\n She lied.\n Actually, Han Zhan had spoken to her the first time they met.\n Han Zhan hung up the call when he saw Song Ci standing outside the door. He strode over to the door and asked, \u201cAre you delivering milk?\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci, who was confident in her beauty, fell into a state of self-doubt. My skin is fair and beautiful, smooth and smooth. In what way did I look like I was delivering milk?\n After ending that ridiculous memory, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cDoes that villa on the hill behind the Cheng Family belong to you?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt\u2019s my grandfather\u2019s old residence.\u201d\n \u201cSo the person I saw was really you.\u201d\n \u201cIt should be me.\u201d Han Zhan pointed at his own eyes. \u201cAren\u2019t my eyes very recognizable?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d\n Their first meeting was so hurried that Song Ci couldn\u2019t even remember his face. Only when she saw Han Zhan standing tall and straight in the rain did Song Ci remember the past.\n Fate was truly wonderful.\n Thinking of how he had also met Song Ci in his previous life, Han Zhan felt a sense of joy. \u201cSo after that, we didn\u2019t interact anymore?\u201d Personally, Han Zhan hoped that Song Ci could have more interactions with him.\n Song Ci said, \u201cYes. After my divorce, I became Liang Bo\u2019s music arranger. One time, I took a plane to see his concert and met you on the plane.\u201d\n \u201cThat was the first time we really met. Someone plotted to hijack the plane and attacked the co-pilot and two children. You saved the two children but your eyes were also injured because of that. In the face of danger, I became the co-pilot and worked with the pilot to send everyone safely to our destination.\u201d\n \u201cAfter that, I went to a charity hospital to perform and met you again. We even became good friends.\u201d\n \u201cIn this life, I dared to seek your protection because you are my good friend.\u201d\n What Song Ci said sounded wonderful to Han Zhan, but at the same time, he felt regretful. \u201cIf only I could remember those things.\u201d\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t remember. In this life, we are closer than anyone else.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n The car stopped in front of a low-key restaurant. \u201cToday, I brought you here to try some chicken with a unique taste.\u201d Han Zhan pulled Song Ci into the restaurant and ordered their signature dish \u2014\n Dried steamed chicken.\n This dried steamed chicken was made from ground chicken and bacon. Together with pickled vegetables and tripe ginseng, it was made from a specially-made distilled drum made of clay.\n Han Zhan scooped a bowl of soup for Song Ci and offered it to her. \u201cTry it. It\u2019s definitely tasty.\u201d This chicken soup was slightly yellow and fragrant.\n Song Ci held the bowl with both hands and took a sip. The taste was indeed fresh and fragrant. It was not at all fishy. \u201cThis restaurant is located in a very remote location and doesn\u2019t have a grand entrance. If not for you bringing me here, I\u2019m afraid I will never know.\u201d\n \u201cWhen my grandmother was still alive, Grandpa often brought her here. I thought you might like it too, so I brought you here to try it.\u201d Seeing that Song Ci liked this dish, Han Zhan was slightly comforted. \u201cWe will come frequently in the future.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After dinner, he walked out of the restaurant. Seeing that the rain was getting heavier, Han Zhan took off his jacket and draped it over Song Ci\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019ll go get the car first. Wait for me here.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan drove the car to the entrance of the restaurant and Song Ci hurriedly got into the car. After boarding the car, she saw that Han Zhan was drenched but she herself was clean. At that instant, Song Ci\u2019s heart thumped.\n Song Ci knew that there was love at first sight in this world, but love at first sight was not suitable for her and Han Zhan. Han Zhan was mature and wise, but also controlled himself rationally. He also loved beauty, but was not someone who would be easily swayed by it.\n Song Ci also loved men, but she was not the type of woman who would fall for anyone.\n She fell in love with Han Zhan over time.\n But Song Ci didn\u2019t intend to tell Han Zhan.\n Whoever fell in love first would lose.\n Returning home, Song Ci hurriedly stuffed Han Zhan into the bathroom to take a shower. \u201cTake a shower first, I will get you some clothes.\u201d\n Han Zhan placed his hand on the door frame of the bathroom and gazed at Song Ci lovingly. \u201cI\u2019m not that delicate. In the past, during a mission, I hid in a swamp for an entire night and didn\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d\n Song Ci glared at him. \u201cYou were single then and now you are my husband. My heart will ache even if yours doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n Han Zhan gave her a meaningful look.\n Is the top socialite\u2019s mouth made of honey?\n Han Zhan showered and walked out naked. Song Ci threw him a soft white towel. \u201cWipe yourself dry. Don\u2019t be a hooligan.\u201d\n Han Zhan wiped his body and sighed. \u201cWhen we first cohabited, you would blush at the sight of me bathing. Now that I\u2019m standing before you naked, your heart is as still as water.\u201d\n Han Zhan tossed aside the towel and leisurely put on his shorts. As he put them on, he stared at Song Ci and questioned her soulfully. \u201cAm I not seductive anymore, or did you turn wild, Baby Ci?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s temples were throbbing when she heard that.\n \u201cDon\u2019t be coquettish.\u201d\n She picked up her laptop and was about to go downstairs when she saw Han Zhan in his clothes. \u201cI made you some cooling tea. Remember to drink it.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, thank you, my wife.\u201d\n Han Zhan got dressed and went downstairs.\n Song Ci placed her laptop on the coffee table and knelt down on the carpet. She held her mouse as she scrolled through the surveillance footage. \u201cGo and drink some tea.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Han Zhan went to the kitchen to pour himself some cold-dispelling tea.\n Song Ci opened the surveillance footage of the Mu Family and retrieved several surveillance footage. Each frame was playing a different image.\n Han Zhan walked over with the tea and sat behind Song Ci.\n Song Ci dragged the surveillance footage to 12pm. She said, \u201cAuntie Zhang said that mother fell during lunchtime. The Mu Family usually have lunch past 12.50pm. We will start watching from 12.00pm.\u201d\n Before Song Ci left the Mu Family residence, she had placed pinhole cameras everywhere in various hidden spots in the villa to monitor the movements of the Mu Family.\n In order not to attract too much attention, she had specially placed the surveillance camera in the stairwell above Du Tingting\u2019s personal photo frame. This surveillance camera was facing the staircase leading to the second level.\n Staring at the moving images on the computer screen, Han Zhan\u2019s lips curled up as he praised Song Ci. \u201cYou\u2019ve become smarter this time. You even know how to install surveillance cameras.\u201d\n Song Ci glanced sideways at Han Zhan and teased him. \u201cSomeone who can install surveillance cameras in his own bedroom and monitor the traffic flow at home is the scariest. Compared to me, you\u2019re not inferior either, Brother Han.\u201d\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cI met a spy in the past. Luckily, I discovered him in time and found him. After that, I installed surveillance cameras in my own house.\u201d\n As the top socialite, Song Ci had gotten to know many big shots. But a spy was still a distant concept to her. It was more like a career that only appeared on television and novels.\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cWas it a commercial spy or a spy from the enemy country?\u201d\n \u201cBoth. Due to my grandfather, I met spies from other countries. Later on, I founded my own company and Zeus Airlines\u2019 rise blocked many people\u2019s way of earning money, so many business rivals also sent spies to my side.\u201d\n Staring at Song Ci\u2019s beautiful and elegant profile, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help recalling the scene when he first met her. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was so angry the first time you accurately revealed my identity in the hospital. I thought you were a spy.\u201d\n Song Ci stuck out her tongue and stared at the surveillance footage. \u201cWhich spy looks as good as me?\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d Han Zhan gave a real example. \u201cDue to my family background, I know many children from major institutions. There\u2019s an elder brother who is eight years older than me. In his first marriage, he married a very beautiful wife. That wife is an artist, well-educated and perfect.\u201d\n \u201cThe two of them were very devoted to each other and envied everyone. But one day five years later, a group of people suddenly came and took his wife away. The reason was that his wife was an enemy spy.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. \u201cAll parties involved in marriage need to go through a political investigation, right? How did she avoid it?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s because her background and identity are all very clean. Even a court hearing wouldn\u2019t be able to find out.\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cActually, spies are also classified into different levels. Some people are very easy to find, while others are very well-hidden.\u201d\n \u201cThat big brother\u2019s wife is considered a top-class spy. She was adopted by a Chinese couple when she was just two years old. She ate the rice of our country and enjoyed the education of our country. The people who raised her were our citizens.\u201d\n \u201cBut she still betrayed our country.\u201d Rubbing Song Ci\u2019s porcelain-like face, Han Zhan concluded. \u201cSo, the most beautiful woman is the most potent poison.\u201d\n Song Ci felt the strength of Han Zhan\u2019s hand on her cheek and it hurt slightly.\n She slapped Han Zhan\u2019s hand away with a look of disdain. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to test me. If I were a spy, I wouldn\u2019t have married you.\u201d\n Meeting Han Zhan\u2019s puzzled gaze, Song Ci said, \u201cI\u2019ll be your little nanny directly. It\u2019s more valuable to get close to your grandfather than to get close to you.\u201d\n \u201cYou know, I have a sweet mouth and a gorgeous face. Girls like me are the most popular amongst the elderly.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s analysis was logical and reasonable, which made Han Zhan\u2019s eyelids twitch in fright. He hurriedly pressed down on Song Ci\u2019s head and turned her face to face the computer. \u201cLook at the surveillance cameras. Let\u2019s not talk about this anymore.\u201d\n Song Ci focused on the surveillance footage and remained silent.\n The surveillance footage showed Du Tingting carrying her bag and an ultrasound scan upstairs at 12.29pm. As she was pregnant, she was holding onto the railing as she walked up.\n The other surveillance footage showed Du Tingting walking out of the master bedroom at the 32 minute. She was holding a card in her hand.\n She sized up the card in her hand as she walked. As she was distracted, she habitually walked down the stairs in the middle.\n After taking three to four steps, Du Tingting\u2019s feet suddenly slipped on the edge of the stairs. She shrieked and reached out to grab the railing. But before she could reach it, she collapsed.\n Du Tingting rolled several times on the stairs until she landed on the platform at the corner. Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear to watch this scene. She turned her head and closed her eyes.\n Witnessing this scene, Han Zhan was also shocked. In the future, when Song Ci is pregnant, we have to move their rooms to the first level! But in this house that we are living in now, there is no room on the first level at all.\n We have to move house.\n After a while, Song Ci opened her eyes. She couldn\u2019t bear to look at the surveillance footage and saw Mu Qiu and Auntie Zhang carrying Du Tingting away.\n All that was left was a pool of blood.\n Staring at the bloodstains on the ground, Song Ci felt slightly uncomfortable.\n \u201cBrother Han, drag the time to 11.20pm and watch the surveillance footage from the beginning again. There must be some details that we didn\u2019t notice.\u201d Song Ci leaned against the sofa, closed her eyes, and stroked her chest in slow motion.\n Han Zhan saw that her face was pale and knew that she must have felt uncomfortable when she saw the surveillance footage. \u201cWait a minute, I remember there\u2019s still some toffee at home.\u201d Han Zhan got up, walked up to the television wall, bent over, and opened the television cabinet. He really found a few toffee.\n He took the candy and returned to Song Ci\u2019s side. He tore open a piece of candy and stuffed the toffee into Song Ci\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhen you are feeling unwell, you will feel better after taking a candy.\u201d\n Song Ci sucked on the sweet and stared at it with the tip of her tongue, feeling slightly jealous. \u201cWho did you learn this from? When you were coaxing Du Xueyan in the past?\u201d This was not the first time Han Zhan was using toffee to coax Song Ci.\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n Song Ci teased him. \u201cThen who is it for? That little class belle whom you had a crush on in the past?\u201d Han Wangwang had exposed this before. He said that Han Zhan had a crush on a class belle and even confessed to her before but was rejected by her. The reason was that he was too fat.\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t resist clarifying. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to Wangwang\u2019s nonsense. I don\u2019t have a crush on her. That class belle was my deskmate. At that time, I was the fattest boy in my class. When the fattest boy sat with the prettiest girl, they purposely made fun of us. My deskmate really thought I liked her and told me one day to give up. She didn\u2019t like fatties...\u201d\n Han Zhan, who had been rejected, felt very puzzled.\n \u201cMoreover, I didn\u2019t lose weight because of the belle. When I was young, my health wasn\u2019t good and I took a lot of hormonal drugs to make myself fat. After that, I gradually got rid of the drugs and exercised more. Naturally, I lost weight.\u201d\n Han Zhan wasn\u2019t the type to fall in love with anyone who was beautiful. Up till now, the only person Han Zhan truly fell in love with was the teenage Du Xueyan and the current Song Ci.\n Song Ci grasped the main point. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat condition requires hormonal medication?\u201d\n Han Zhan said mildly, \u201cSome minor ailments that have all been treated.\u201d He pursed his lips tightly, looking like he didn\u2019t wish to speak further.\n Song Ci saw that he was unwilling to speak further and didn\u2019t press him. She continued to watch the surveillance footage patiently.\n \u201cMy mother said that toffee is good when you\u2019re feeling upset. I\u2019ve tried it before and it\u2019s quite effective.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s voice suddenly sounded leisurely by Song Ci\u2019s ear.\n She turned her head slowly and looked at Han Zhan.\n The deep contours of his face gave him a determined look. No matter how much strong winds and tough snows he could survive, there were still times when he needed to comfort himself with toffee.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart ached slightly for Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan\u2019s past must have contained many stories. Those stories might be painful or sad. Song Ci wanted to listen to them all once, but Han Zhan was still unwilling to open that book called \u201cHan Zhan\u2019s Past\u201d to her.\n \u201cWhen you\u2019re free, Brother Han can tell me your story too?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThat day will come.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d\n She was waiting for the day when Han Zhan would completely open up to her.\n Han Zhan glanced at the surveillance footage and his expression changed slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201d\n Song Ci quickly turned back and glanced at the surveillance footage.\n She saw Mu Qiu.\n At 11.45pm, Mu Qiu hurried upstairs. As she walked, she placed her hand on her abdomen and rubbed it gently. As a woman herself, Song Ci knew very well what that action meant.\n Calculating the time, Mu Qiu\u2019s menstruation would have come these two days.\n Mu Qiu returned to her own room and only stayed for four to five minutes before leaving.\n When she came out, Mu Qiu was holding several sanitary pads in her hands. From the third floor to the second floor, Mu Qiu walked rather slowly. She also looked very hesitant, as if she was being troubled by something and wavered left and right.\n When she reached the staircase landing on the second level, Mu Qiu suddenly stopped in her tracks. She lowered her head and stared at the long staircase in a daze.\n As Mu Qiu had her head lowered, Song Ci couldn\u2019t see Mu Qiu\u2019s expression and gaze. When Song Ci gazed at Mu Qiu\u2019s thin and frail body, she felt an inexplicable sense of fear and uneasiness.\n Suddenly, Mu Qiu turned around and ran back up the stairs to her room.\n Upon seeing this, Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cGuess what she went back for?\u201d\n Song Ci frowned and remained silent. She just stared at the video, waiting anxiously.\n About a minute later, Mu Qiu came downstairs. This time, there was a small white jar in her other hand. After recognizing what it was, Song Ci suddenly sat up straight and her eyelids started twitching. She murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s facial cream...\u201d\n Mu Qiu loved to use LAMER\u2019s facial cream every time the seasons changed, and she had several bottles of them in her cupboard, so Song Ci would not recognize it wrongly.\n The surveillance footage was still flashing.\n Song Ci saw that Mu Qiu had taken three to four steps down the stairs on the second floor and stopped moving. She opened the small box and took out a thumb-sized tube of facial cream.\n Bending down, Mu Qiu applied the facial cream to the edge of the staircase as if she was massaging her face.\n Everyone knew that there were several characteristics to LAMER\u2019s facial cream \u2014\n Expensive!\n Smooth!\n After applying, it was transparent and colorless!\n \u201cNo...\u201d Song Ci wanted to wake Mu Qiu up and not do anything foolish. But the moment she opened her mouth, she realized that this was just a surveillance video, a replay of what had already happened!\n She had witnessed the entire incident, but she could only stand by and watch, unable to stop it.\n Song Ci covered her face with her hands. She felt cold all over.\n How can anyone be so heartless?\n That\u2019s her biological mother who had given birth to her and raised her! She is the person closest to her!\n Han Zhan retrieved the couple jacket and draped it over Song Ci. He said, \u201cGo upstairs and lie down for a while. I will save this video for later.\u201d\n Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s hand.\n Han Zhan\u2019s hand was extremely warm, like the weather in June.\n Song Ci finally felt more at ease. She shook Han Zhan\u2019s hand. \u201cThat was her mother who nearly died when she gave birth to her. How can she be so heartless?\u201d Song Ci was puzzled.\n Han Zhan covered Song Ci\u2019s eyes.\n His voice was deep and gentle, but his words were harsh. \u201cSong Ci, not every child is an angel. In this world, there are children who donated their kidneys to save their mothers, but there are also those who killed their mothers in a fit of anger.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci shuddered.\n \u201cSave the video. It will be very useful later!\u201d She wanted to show Mu Mian just how evil his daughter was!\n \u201cMmm, I understand. Quickly go upstairs and rest.\u201d Han Zhan ordered Song Ci to return to her room to rest. Song Ci didn\u2019t argue with him and went upstairs directly.\n Only after seeing her go upstairs did Han Zhan copy the video and put it in his study drawer.\n \u2013\n Recently, there had been some unrest in the city where Yan Jiang and the rest were staying.\n The reason for it was also related to Yan Jiang.\n About half a month ago, a woman\u2019s body was found on the east coast of the Congo River. She was naked when she was found and her body was already in the image of a giant. She was a homeless person with no power or influence. Although her cause of death was a mystery, no one was willing to investigate her.\n After all, it was a thankless task and they might not be able to catch the murderer.\n As a newcomer, Yan Jiang was naturally given this thankless task.\n Yan Jiang performed an autopsy on the girl and found traces of man\u2019s sperm and fluids under her fingernails. When he dissected her organs, he found a man\u2019s ring in her stomach.\n In Kinshasa, anyone who could afford silk clothing was either wealthy or affluent, so that ring was the best way to identify the person.\n The police listed out a batch of suspects. In the end, they pinpointed one of the local big shots. In the process of secretly investigating the suspect, they actually discovered five to six imprisoned women in that big boss\u2019s basement!\n The news of this incident spread like wildfire and incurred the wrath of the entire nation.\n The poor country was so chaotic and there were even several major civil wars a few years back. Once this incident was exposed and controlled by people with ulterior motives, it immediately caused a nationwide sensation.\n The city was about to go into turmoil.\n Recently, Song Fei and the rest of the staff from the research institute had been traveling together. They didn\u2019t dare to be alone for fear of danger. Yan Jiang knew that chaos was imminent and was worried about Song Fei\u2019s safety. He had to send her to the hospital everyday before going to work.\n Song Ci finished her bath and got dressed. She sat at the dressing table to apply skincare products. As she waited for her skincare products to be absorbed, she habitually took out her cell phone and searched for news about the Congo.\n This habit was formed after Song Fei and the rest went to Congo.\n Looking at the latest news, Song Ci couldn\u2019t help worrying about the safety of Song Fei and Yan Jiang.\n \u2013\n Deep into the night, Mu Mian stared at Du Tingting\u2019s pale and frail face as she slept. His heart ached terribly.\n The fetus in Du Tingting\u2019s womb represented hope. If Mu Qiu really left, the child in Du Tingting\u2019s womb would also be a source of hope for the two of them.\n But the child was gone...\n Mu Mian was terrified at the thought of Mu Qiu dying at any moment.\n Both he and Du Tingting could not bear the pain of losing Mu Qiu! Just the passing of a newly-formed fetus was already enough to make them so sad. Moreover, this was a lovely and lovely daughter who had accompanied them for 20 years.\n Mu Mian took out his cell phone and walked to the side of the bed. He logged into a secret link in his folder and opened his conversation with \u201c1.\u201d\n Mu Mian: [Hi, have you made any progress?]\n As usual, 1 replied promptly.\n : [Sir, we cannot do this business.]\n Mu Mian gave up completely.\n Mu Mian: [Deduct the service fee and return the rest of the money to me.]\n : [Alright, the money will be transferred to your account within two working days.]\n Mu Mian logged out of the chat and completely deleted that link.\n He stood by the window for a very, very long time.\n Downstairs, the hospital park was completely silent. Under the few night lights, a moth flew into the light like a flame. It lingered there, reluctant to leave.\n Mu Mian stared at those moths and felt a sense of pity.\n They knew full well that the flames were burning but they were still drawn to the flame. He knew that once he did something, he would be throwing himself into hell but he had no choice.\n Mu Mian opened up the world\u2019s dark web.\n The World\u2019s Dark Web was an underground network that could issue missions anonymously and commit all sorts of heinous crimes.\n On this day, a new mission appeared on the main page of the website:\n 2027: $3 USD for someone\u2019s life.\n Target details:\n Name: Song Fei.\n Age: 22 years old.\n Birthplace: Wangdong City of China.\n Current address: The capital of Congo, Golden Sands.\n Identity: Special student at the China Virus Research Institute.\n On the dark web, people from all over the world posted all sorts of missions everyday. After Mu Mian\u2019s mission was posted, it only stayed on the homepage for a few minutes before being suppressed by other news.\n But there were also many hired killers waiting to do business online. Mu Mian only waited for a few minutes before he received three replies.\n Staring at those replies, Mu Mian smiled.\n See, using criminal methods to gain benefits was always the most effective way. In this world, there was never a lack of vicious people committing crimes for money.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "182": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-183\n\n Chapter 182: Song Fei is Dead  Song Fei was curled up on the sofa as if she had no bones. She was playing Miracle Nuan Nuan. After putting on her costume, Song Fei clicked \u201csubmit\u201d and even used a critical immunity skill during the PK.\n In the end...\n She failed!\n Song Fei\u2019s lips twitched as she stared at the word failure. \u201cTrash game!\u201d It\u2019s time-consuming and wasted money!\n The doorknob of the main door suddenly turned. Song Fei heard a slight sound and hurriedly kept her cell phone. She looked up and saw Yan Jiang pushing the door open and walking in.\n Yan Jiang was carrying a bag. His clothes were wrinkled and he looked very fatigued.\n Yan Jiang had been very busy recently. He didn\u2019t expect the case he was in charge of to cause such a stir. He had worked overtime for two consecutive days and finally had half a day off today. He came back from work at noon.\n Walking into the house, Yan Jiang instinctively touched his own hair when he saw Song Fei in the living room. It had been a few days since he washed his hair and his short hair was sticking up in a greasy bun. This ruined his handsome image in Song Fei\u2019s heart.\n \u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d Yan Jiang grinned at Song Fei. Without the support of the stars, the once number one handsome man in the entertainment circles looked silly and innocent.\n Song Fei pinched her nose in disgust at the stench of sweat on Yan Jiang\u2019s body. \u201cYou stink.\u201d\n \u201cI will go take a shower now.\u201d Yan Jiang hurried into the toilet and took a quick shower. He even scrubbed his hair twice.\n He came out of the toilet wearing a t-shirt and shorts. When he saw Song Fei leaning against the wall, he instantly stopped moving.\n Song Fei snorted and tossed the pants on the bed to Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang quickly put on his pants and was embarrassed. He coughed and pretended to be calm as he walked up to Song Fei and stood beside her.\n \u201cWhat are you playing?\u201d Glancing at Song Fei\u2019s cell phone and seeing that she was playing Miracle Nuan Nuan, Yan Jiang felt somewhat helpless. \u201cYou\u2019re still playing this? You\u2019ve already charged 20,000 yuan, but I don\u2019t see any results.\u201d\n Song Fei was very unhappy with this game and couldn\u2019t help complaining. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this game designer\u2019s brain. He doesn\u2019t know how to appreciate aesthetics!\u201d Every set of mine is obviously very nice, but I kept failing. It\u2019s unfair!\n \u201cLet me help you.\u201d Yan Jiang took Song Fei\u2019s cell phone, looked at the PK theme, casually clicked on a few sets of equipment for Nuan Nuan, and submitted them.\n Very soon, the PK ended with Yan Jiang\u2019s complete victory.\n \u201cLook, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d Yan Jiang returned the phone to Song Fei.\n Song Fei looked down at the perfect score on the screen, her eyes turning cold. \u201cMy aesthetic standards has no problem.\u201d She would never admit that she didn\u2019t understand aesthetics.\n Yan Jiang replied, \u201cNo, there\u2019s something wrong with your taste.\u201d\n \u201cI dare you to say that again.\u201d Song Fei raised her brows and stared at Yan Jiang threateningly.\n Yan Jiang spoke as if he was facing death with equanimity. \u201cIf you really have no problem with your aesthetic standards, you would have agreed to be my girlfriend long ago. You don\u2019t even fancy such a good-looking person like me and even said that your aesthetic standards are good...\u201d\n Faced with the increasingly thick-skinned Yan Jiang, Song Fei chose to ignore him.\n She logged out of Miracle Nuan. After much hesitation, she still deleted this rubbish game.\n Song Fei felt refreshed after deleting the game.\n Yan Jiang heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Song Fei had finally deleted the money-sucking game. A person like Song Fei was not suited to play Miracle Nuan. She was suitable for Death Space instead.\n Bloody and violent\u2014this suited Song Fei\u2019s character perfectly.\n Without a game to play, Song Fei put on her hat and was about to go out, when Yan Jiang hurriedly asked her, \u201cAre you going out? Where are you going?\u201d\n \u201cJust wandering around.\u201d\n \u201cI will accompany you.\u201d After reaching this city, no one recognized Yan Jiang. He completely lost his image as an idol and couldn\u2019t even be bothered to put on his hat. Just like that, he followed Song Fei out of the house.\n The people here were all very tanned. The slender and fair-skinned Song Fei was very eye-catching among the crowd. Yan Jiang stared at the men around them, and saw that they were all secretly sizing up Song Fei. He felt very displeased.\n He hurried forward and grabbed Song Fei\u2019s hand. \u201cCan you hold your brother\u2019s hand?\u201d\n Song Fei shot him a look. She didn\u2019t agree but didn\u2019t remove her hand either.\n Having gotten used to Wangdong City\u2019s extravagant lifestyle, the Golden Sands life was very dull for Yan Jiang. He couldn\u2019t even find an entertainment project that interested him outside. Yan Jiang had wanted to take Song Fei on a boat tour, but someone had died in that river some time ago and he didn\u2019t want to take her there.\n \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Yan Jiang asked for Song Fei\u2019s opinion.\n It was indeed pointless to go around aimlessly. After thinking for a moment, Song Fei said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the zoo. Only the zoo here is interesting.\u201d The animals in this zoo were all wildlife from the African savanna. Song Fei had never seen any local wildlife in her life.\n \u201cLet\u2019s ride a bike there.\u201d\n Yan Jiang found a bicycle and drove Song Fei to the Zoo.\n Yan Jiang was sweating profusely by the time they arrived at the entrance of the zoo. He unbuttoned his collar to reveal his sexy collarbone.\n Song Fei suddenly leaned over and tidied his collar. She even lectured him. \u201cA beautiful boy should pay more attention to his image and protect himself well. You won\u2019t be classy wearing like this.\u201d\n Yan Jiang suspected that Song Fei was afraid of others coveting his beauty. He was overjoyed and purposely provoked her. \u201cMany people have seen my body.\u201d\n Song Fei frowned but remained silent.\n She turned and walked towards the entrance of the zoo alone, looking slightly annoyed. Yan Jiang chased after her and leaned against Song Fei\u2019s ear. \u201cBut you are the only one who can touch it.\u201d\n Song Fei snorted, but the coldness in her eyes dimmed considerably.\n The two of them entered the zoo and Song Fei went straight to the African Elephant Park. She stood outside the park and stared at those huge African elephants for a while, before taking out her cell phone to take a few photos.\n \u201cAh Jiang, stand there.\u201d Song Fei signaled for Yan Jiang to stand by the railing and take a photo with the elephant.\n Yan Jiang obediently walked over to take the photo. Just as Song Fei was about to press the button to take the photo, this man, who had appeared in VOGUE Magazine several times and was known as the Prince Charming in photos, raised his hand in a V sign and grinned like a little fool.\n After taking the photo, Song Fei looked down at it for a while before sending it to the private cloud photo album.\n Yan Jiang suddenly waved at her. \u201cYou come too. Let\u2019s take a photo together.\u201d\n Song Fei hesitated for a moment before walking over. She was half a head shorter than Yan Jiang and he had to bend over to match her height. Song Fei held her cell phone and counted down. \u201cThree, two, one!\u201d\n She had just finished counting when a kiss landed on her cheek. Song Fei\u2019s hand trembled as she pressed the button to take a photo.\n She slowly lifted her head and looked at Yan Jiang with those eyes that could freeze someone. \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d Song Fei\u2019s tone was so cold that icicles could freeze.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI like you. I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to kiss you just now. If I\u2019m guilty for being unable to control myself, you can beat me to death.\u201d Yan Jiang put on a deadpan expression.\n Song Fei didn\u2019t say anything. She just patted Yan Jiang\u2019s neck and left.\n Yan Jiang was in disbelief. Is she going to let me off just like that?\n Song Fei indeed dotes on me!\n Yan Jiang hurriedly chased after Song Fei. When he caught up to her, Yan Jiang saw that she was applying lipstick. He stared at her pink lips, his heart racing.\n At this moment, Yan Jiang suddenly felt an itchy sensation all over his body. He scratched himself once, and couldn\u2019t resist scratching himself again. \u201cSong Fei, don\u2019t you feel itchy?\u201d\n Yan Jiang stared at Song Fei\u2019s fair skin. He scratched his neck and collarbone. \u201cMy neck is so itchy. Are there fleas here?\u201d\n Song Fei smiled and ignored Yan Jiang. She continued looking at her giraffe.\n Yan Jiang was scratching himself so hard that his skin was about to break. He inadvertently saw Song Fei\u2019s smiling expression and realized something. He felt very ill.\n \u201cSong Fei, did you get something on your fingers when you touched my neck just now?\u201d Recently, Song Fei had been very lenient with Yan Jiang. Yan Jiang had almost forgotten just how vicious Song Fei was.\n She was a demoness who had dared to shoot her admirer from a young age!\n Song Fei smiled mockingly and said leisurely, \u201cYou are the first guinea pig to be tested on a newly developed toy. I call it cute and itchy.\u201d\n Cute my foot!\n Yan Jiang scratched his neck and collarbone vigorously. \u201cSong Fei, give me the antidote. My neck feels terrible.\u201d\n Song Fei shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked, \u201cReally?\u201d\n Song Fei nodded solemnly. \u201cI just developed a poison and have no time to develop an antidote.\u201d\n Yan Jiang whispered coquettishly. \u201cSong Fei, you are so vicious. Do you have to take revenge on me just like that after I secretly kissed you? You! I! I...\u201d\n \u201cHow are you?\u201d Song Fei looked at Yan Jiang calmly. She didn\u2019t believe that he would dare to hit her.\n Yan Jiang was a coward and didn\u2019t have the guts to lay a hand on her.\n Yan Jiang suddenly took a step forward, bent down, cupped Song Fei\u2019s cheek, and kissed her while she wasn\u2019t looking. Yan Jiang only let go of Song Fei when that patch of skin at his collarbone started to itch uncontrollably again.\n As he tickled her, he provoked Song Fei. \u201cNothing much, I just want to kiss!\u201d This little coward had long turned into a big bad wolf. Not only was he not afraid of her, he even wanted to devour her at all times.\n Song Fei was in a rare daze and didn\u2019t move at all.\n Yan Jiang felt much better now that he had won this round. He touched his own lips. The feeling of kissing Song Fei just now was wonderful, soft, and addictive.\n Yan Jiang wanted to kiss her again.\n But when he met Song Fei\u2019s chilly gaze, Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dare to offend her again. Song Fei had been caught off-guard when he kissed her just now. Now that she was alerted, Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t have his way anymore.\n It was as if looking at Yan Jiang one more time would dirty her eyes, Song Fei turned and left in quick footsteps.\n Yan Jiang chased after her in big strides. He walked alongside her and stubbornly said, \u201cI admit that it was my fault for kissing you without your permission. I am willing to be beaten and scolded, but I will do it again.\u201d\n Song Fei snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown capable.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cYou said before that boys should be braver. Crying and whining is annoying. I have become braver now. You can\u2019t despise me.\u201d\n \u201cHa...\u201d\n Song Fei quickened her steps.\n Yan Jiang followed her for a few steps and suddenly stopped when he realized something. He looked down at his neck and collarbone. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it itchy anymore?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s heartbeat quickened at the thought of something.\n Song Fei heard footsteps behind her but didn\u2019t slow down. Suddenly, someone grabbed her arm. Song Fei had no choice but to stop. She looked up and met Yan Jiang\u2019s smiling eyes.\n Although this person had turned black, he was still handsome and good-looking. Indeed, good-looking people didn\u2019t care about their skin color.\n \u201cI know where the antidote is.\u201d Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes were sparkling as he spoke excitedly.\n Song Fei said, \u201cThere\u2019s really no antidote.\u201d\n Yan Jiang suddenly leaned forward and kissed Song Fei again. This time, he kissed her very gently and carefully.\n After letting go of Song Fei, Yan Jiang leaned his forehead against hers and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cYou applied the antidote on your lips, right?\u201d What she applied previously was not lipstick, but the antidote for the itching powder.\n Within two seconds, Song Fei\u2019s face was completely red.\n Song Fei was still struggling. \u201cI really don\u2019t have it. That itching powder can only last for a few minutes. There\u2019s no antidote.\u201d She would never admit to having an antidote.\n an Jiang already knew that Song Fei didn\u2019t mean what she said. He didn\u2019t believe her explanation at all.\n Looking at Song Fei\u2019s flushed cheeks, Yan Jiang\u2019s heart felt like it was soaked in honey. \u201cSong Fei, you are too adorable.\u201d Song Fei was very vicious and also very adorable.\n Song Fei\u2019s gaze turned cold. \u201cShut up!\u201d\n Because of that kiss, Yan Jiang was in a state of excitement the entire afternoon.\n Returning home that night, seeing that Fu Hanshen and the rest were still not back, Yan Jiang called Song Fei into his room and told her mysteriously, \u201cI have something good here.\u201d\n Yan Jiang took out a packet of hotpot soup base from under his bed. He said mischievously, \u201cI only brought a few bags and left them for you. I couldn\u2019t bear to take them out until they were gone today.\u201d\n Song Fei stared at the hotpot soup packet in his hands. The ice in her eyes gradually melted, blooming like a blossoming peach tree.\n There were no ingredients at home except for some meat. Song Fei missed hotpot from her country. She said, \u201cI really want to eat fishballs and spinach.\u201d\n \u201cI will go and buy it for you tomorrow.\u201d He just didn\u2019t know if there were any spinach or fishballs available.\n The next morning, the two of them went out together. Yan Jiang sent Song Fei to the hospital and watched her enter, before returning to the station to work.\n In the afternoon, Yan Jiang compiled the analysis data into a report, before pushing a dissected body into the freezer and going for lunch.\n At this moment, the cell phone in his pocket started vibrating non-stop.\n Yan Jiang took off his gloves and washed his hands, before taking out his cell phone. He felt uneasy when he saw that it was Song Fei\u2019s teacher, Fu Hanshen.\n Teacher Fu seldom contacted me. What happened?\n Yan Jiang picked up the call. He had just placed the phone to his ear when he heard Fu Hanshen say in a very grave voice, \u201cYan Jiang, Song Fei is in trouble.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s pupils quivered slightly.\n \u201cWhat happened?\u201d His voice sounded very calm. If one listened closely, one could hear a slight quiver in his voice.\n \u201cYesterday, a batch of infected people were discovered in the Rimedes District. Their reactions were slightly different from the other patients, so I sent Song Fei over there to collect their blood for research. Unexpectedly, there was an explosion there, and several buildings were destroyed. The clinic that Song Fei went to was already in ruins...\u201d\n Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t hear anything else Fu Hanshen said.\n His head was buzzing.\n There was only one thought in his mind \u2014\n How can Song Fei die!\n How dare she die?\n How can she die?\n \u201cHey, Yan Jiang, are you still listening?\u201d Fu Hanshen\u2019s voice sounded choked.\n Yan Jiang suddenly chuckled. \u201cHehe, Teacher Fu, I am here.\u201d\n That laughter sent chills down Fu Hanshen\u2019s spine. \u201cYan Jiang...\u201d How could he smile?\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cTeacher Fu, don\u2019t joke around. I will go buy some fishballs and spinach later. Song Fei promised to have hotpot with me tonight. If you are free tonight, come back secretly. Don\u2019t let the other colleagues know.\u201d\n Golden Sands near the equator was hot all year round. But when Fu Hanshen heard Yan Jiang\u2019s words, he felt as if he had fallen into an icehouse. His entire body was ice-cold.\n Oh no, Yan Jiang has gone mad!\n \u201cYan Jiang.\u201d Fu Hanshen tried his best to remain calm. \u201cWait at the police station. I will drive over to pick you up. We will go and take a look at the scene of the explosion.\u201d\n Yan Jiang directly hung up.\n Fu Hanshen arrived at the entrance of the police station very quickly. Dressed in a white suit, Yan Jiang stood at the entrance of the police station. He was tall and slender, like an ice sculpture. He was the most beautiful sight in Golden Sands.\n Fu Hanshen sat in the car and sized up Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang was speaking to a colleague. As he spoke, there was a faint smile on his face, which was both demonic and mischievous. Staring at Yan Jiang\u2019s smiling face, Fu Han\u2019s heart clenched tightly.\n Fu Hanshen honked.\n Yan Jiang turned and saw Fu Hanshen. His eyes froze slightly. \u201cTeacher Fu.\u201d He greeted him with a smile and got into the car.\n Holding back his heartache, Fu Hanshen reminded him in a low voice. \u201cBuckle up your seatbelt. We\u2019re going to the Rimedia District.\u201d\n Yan Jiang obediently fastened his seatbelt.\n Along the way, Yan Jiang was very quiet and even played with his cell phone. Fu Hanshen\u2019s fingers gripped the steering wheel tightly. There were several times when he wanted to stop the car and shake Yan Jiang awake by his shoulders.\n Those who pretended to be asleep were the most pathetic.\n Finally, they arrived at the Rimedia District. Even from afar, Fu Hanshen could see the dirty, bloodied citizens crying on the streets.\n In the distance, the building that had been destroyed by the bomb was in ruins.\n Fu Hanshen didn\u2019t have the courage to go any deeper.\n He stopped the car and lifted a trembling hand to cover his face. He choked out, \u201cIt\u2019s right in front.\u201d\n Staring at the rubble in front of him, Yan Jiang\u2019s calm expression gradually turned grave. His chest rose and fell violently as his breathing quickened.\n \u201cShe will be fine.\u201d Yan Jiang comforted himself. \u201cThat year, when the entire Bijiang City collapsed, I dug her out. She will not die this time!\u201d\n Yan Jiang unbuckled his seatbelt and alighted.\n Everyone else was escaping from the scene, but he was alone, moving against the current.\n The rubble in front of him was still covered in dust. Yan Jiang coughed the moment he got close to the rubble. His eyes were red and painful from coughing, but he still straightened his back and went deep into the rubble.\n Amidst the debris, broken limbs were strewn everywhere. He also saw some body parts. Someone who was still alive grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s calf and said in the local language, \u201cSave me!\u201d\n Yan Jiang bent down and gently removed his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t save you.\u201d\n He stood up and walked forward. The floor was filled with patients struggling in pain. He looked straight ahead and walked towards the clinic.\n The clinic had already been reduced to rubble. The bodies lying on the ground were indistinguishable. Yan Jiang rummaged through the rubble and shouted, \u201cSong Fei!\u201d\n \u201cAh Fei!\u201d\n \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n No one answered him.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s legs started to tremble. He stumbled as he searched the bodies. This one isn\u2019t her, neither is this...\n Suddenly, his gaze froze.\n ]He saw a thin body. She was alone under the rubble, her small black backpack right beside her.\n ]Yan Jiang recognized that outfit. Song Fei was wearing this t-shirt when they left the house this morning.\n Song Fei was dead with an incomplete corpse.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s world collapsed instantly. He screamed in pain. \u201cSong Fei!\u201d\n Fu Hanshen ran over through the dust. Hearing this gut-wrenching cry of pain, he was stunned and his scalp went numb. Fu Hanshen just stood there, staring in shock at the scene before him.\n His heart was breaking.\n \u2013\n In China.\n International Headlines: [An explosion took place in the capital of Country J. Massive casualties and many dead. Our country\u2019s research expert on virus research, Ms. Song Fei, unfortunately perished...]\n This piece of news was just one of many. It originally didn\u2019t cause much of a stir, but a hidden hand controlled the public opinion and traffic, quietly pushing this topic to the front page of Sina Weibo.\n On this day, the elegant lady of the Zheng Family, Zheng Suyue, invited Song Ci to her birthday party. This lady called Zheng Suyue was the lady who met Song Ci and Han Zhan at Old Madam Cheng\u2019s birthday party.\n Zheng Suyue was a good friend of Song Ci\u2019s. Zheng Suyue was also invited to Song Ci\u2019s wedding, and she had given her an expensive wedding gift.\n Having received Zheng Suyue\u2019s birthday invitation, Song Ci naturally had to go.\n A few days ago, at Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s wedding, only their closest family and friends were invited. At the banquet, Zheng Suyue and the rest saw Mo Yao, Shen Yubei, Di Rongrong, and the diplomat Jin Luolan all sitting at the groom\u2019s family seats. They knew that Han Zhan was not as ordinary as he looked.\n What a joke. Can an ordinary person be family with Asia\u2019s richest woman, an international singer, and a well-known female diplomat?\n Obviously, Han Zhan is the mysterious big boss who concealed his identity!\n All of them were smart people and knew what to say and what not to say. As a result, several days had already passed since the wedding, but there was still no news about what happened at the wedding site.\n Apart from her closest friends, no one knew that Song Ci\u2019s Brother Han was a big boss!\n Ever since they got married, Song Ci rarely appeared in public. More than a month had passed since she attended Old Madam Cheng\u2019s birthday party.\n Those who weren\u2019t in the know would think that Song Ci had married an ordinary man and led a simple life. They thought that she must have lost all her glory.\n Everyone was curious as to how the top socialite was living now.\n As soon as Song Ci appeared, she was noticed. \u201cSong Ci is here.\u201d A soft voice attracted the attention of many as they turned to look at the main entrance.\n Song Ci walked leisurely into the Zheng Family\u2019s living room. She was wearing a pink strapless fishtail gown with her long hair in a bun, exposing her forehead and her peerlessly beautiful face.\n Song Ci was only wearing a pair of diamond earrings. Her slender, elegant neck was clean, her prominent collarbone sexy, and her slender waist alluring.\n She was dazzling, peerlessly gorgeous, and overshadowed all the beauties present.\n Upon seeing this, a beautiful woman pouted and muttered sourly, \u201cWhy is she still so beautiful? Didn\u2019t they say that a married woman would be reduced to an ugly duckling by the trifles of daily necessities?\u201d Why did this rule not work on Song Ci?\n After the lady finished muttering, she heard Song Ci\u2019s voice. \u201cWen Shu, what bad things are you saying about me?\u201d\n Wen Shu was stunned. She looked up in shock and saw Song Ci standing close to her, her beautiful eyes glowing. She blushed in embarrassment.\n Song Ci suddenly leaned close to Wen Shu and whispered into his ear. \u201cYou are wrong. Marriage will never make you ugly. Love \u00efs nourishing will make you even more beautiful and charming.\u201d\n Song Ci emphasized the word \u201cnourishing\u201d.\n Thinking of the interesting things that happened between adults, Wen Shu\u2019s face turned even redder. \u201cYou... why are you still so indecent?\u201d\n Song Ci spread out her hands and made a very helpless expression. \u201cI have no choice. In this day and age, serious women aren\u2019t wanted.\u201d\n \u201cShameless!\u201d\n Song Ci knew that Wen Shu didn\u2019t have any bad intentions and didn\u2019t tease her anymore. She turned and went to look for Zheng Suyue.\n She chose a pair of jade earrings for Zheng Suyue as her birthday present.\n Due to the influence of her family, Zheng Suyue didn\u2019t like gold and diamonds. She loved jade and gems. Upon receiving Song Ci\u2019s gift, Zheng Suyue was very happy. She immediately took off her ruby earrings and put Song Ci\u2019s ones on.\n \u201cSong Song, did you see today\u2019s Weibo post?\u201d\n \u201cNope, I\u2019ve been busy the entire time.\u201d Liang Bo had attended a popular singing contest and invited Song Ci to perform for him at the performance hall today.\n Song Ci had gone. Not wanting to expose herself, she had even put on a mask.\n It was already afternoon by the time they finished recording the show. After having a meal with Liang Bo, she went home to put on makeup and change into a new gown. Even now, she had yet to browse Weibo.\n Hearing Zheng Suyue\u2019s question, Song Ci opened her bag to find her phone and asked, \u201cWhat happened on Weibo again?\u201d\n Zheng Suyue looked at her actions and wanted to say something, but didn\u2019t dare to.\n Song Ci frowned at her expression. \u201cWhy? Is this related to me?\u201d\n But Zheng Suyue said, \u201cDid your elder sister Song Fei go to Africa to research the virus?\u201d\n Song Ci never expected Zheng Suyue to mention Song Fei.\n Anxious, she hurriedly said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. She went with Yan Jiang. What happened?\u201d\n Zheng Suyue\u2019s expression also turned grave. She couldn\u2019t bear to tell Song Ci the truth and gently reminded her. \u201cSong Song, you should look at your own Weibo.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyelids twitched.\n She opened her Weibo account and saw that there was a trending topic # Country J\u2019s Capital Explosion #. Behind this topic was the word \u201cFire\u201d.\n She forced herself to calm down and clicked on the hottest topic.\n International headline: [An explosion took place in the capital of Country J, Li Meide. Massive casualties. Our country\u2019s virus research specialist, Ms. Song Fei, unfortunately perished...]\n Song Ci\u2019s heart tightened when she saw the words \u201cVirus Specialist Ms. Song\u201d. \u201cHow could...\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t even hold her phone steady.\n Zheng Suyue quickly held her waist and whispered into her ear. \u201cSong Song, there is a detailed update on this Ms. Song in the comments section. Take a look and see if she is your sister. Don\u2019t get it wrong.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded frantically before opening the comments section.\n In the comments section, the comment with the most likes was:\n [According to sources, the deceased specialist with the surname Song is called Song Fei. She is the only disciple of our country\u2019s top expert in virology, Mr. Fu Hanshen. She is 22 years old.\n At the age of 6, Song Fei, who was only 10 years old, was tested to have an IQ of 182. She had a unique eidetic memory.\n Moreover, she also had astonishing talent in the field of chemistry and viruses. When she was 10 years old, Song Fei was personally invited to join the Mensa Club by the chairman of the highly-intelligent club...\u201d\n Under this comment, countless netizens knelt down and called her big boss.\n Song Ci stared at that long list of information and her mind went blank.\n How can this be?\n Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019ll get going first, Suyue. Let\u2019s meet again another day.\u201d\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n Song Ci staggered out of the Zheng Family\u2019s living room. She lost all her poise and composure, attracting the stares of many. After she left the house, she got into her own car.\n When the driver, Ah Song, saw that she had come out so quickly and her face was still pale, he thought that Song Ci had been bullied at the Zheng Family and asked fiercely, \u201cMadam, did someone bully you?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Song Ci called as she instructed Ah Song. \u201cSend me to Zeus!\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s hands were trembling as she made the call. Her fingers wavered on Song Fei\u2019s name for a long while, before she closed her eyes and pressed down hard.\n She couldn\u2019t get through the phone and was repeatedly reminded that the other party was not available. Song Ci\u2019s heart sank as her hands grew colder and colder, and cold sweat broke out on her back.\n She called Yan Jiang again, but his cell phone was switched off.\n Left with no choice, Song Ci called Fu Hanshen.\n The first time, Fu Hanshen didn\u2019t pick up. The second time, Fu Han finally answered the call. \u201cSong Ci.\u201d Fu Hanshen\u2019s tone was sorrowful and heavy, making Song Ci\u2019s heart race.\n \u201cTeacher Fu, where is my elder sister? Why can\u2019t I get through to her?\u201d Song Ci asked in a roundabout manner but didn\u2019t dare to ask him: Was the person who died my elder sister?\n Fu Hanshen rubbed his moist eyes and seemed to sob before saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Song Ci, I\u2019m useless. I lost your elder sister and I can\u2019t bring her home anymore!\u201d With that, Fu Hanshen started crying bitterly on the other end of the phone.\n Song Ci listened in shock, her heart numb with pain.\n Half a second later, the cell phone fell from Song Ci\u2019s hand to the bottom of the car. She bit the back of her hand and cried silently.\n Seeing Song Ci\u2019s tears, Ah Song was at a loss. Ah Song had a dumb mouth and didn\u2019t know how to comfort Song Ci. He stepped on the accelerator and sped up towards Zeus.\n The car stopped in front of Zeus Building. Song Ci alighted from the car with reddened eyes. She looked up and saw a tall figure standing in front of Zeus Building.\n Song Ci sprinted over and threw herself into Han Zhan\u2019s arms.\n \u201cHan Zhan!\u201d Song Ci cried as she slipped out of his arms. \u201cMy elder sister is dead. She\u2019s dead!\u201d\n ]Han Zhan held her arm and finally lost his calm voice. \u201cBaby Ci, get up.\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei is dead!\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei doesn\u2019t want me anymore!\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s dead\u2014\u201d\n Song Ci cried so bitterly that she nearly fainted in Han Zhan\u2019s arms.\n Han Zhan pulled her into his arms. \u201cSong Ci, calm down. You can\u2019t collapse!\u201d\n Song Ci was crying so hard that she couldn\u2019t hear Han Zhan at all. In the end, she still fainted in his arms and lost consciousness.\n Han Zhan carried Song Ci back to the office and placed her on the small bed.\n Li Li heard from the secretary that Mrs. Han had fainted and was carried back to the office by Mr. Han. Worried about Song Ci\u2019s health, Li Li hurried over to Han Zhan\u2019s office to greet her.\n Li Li looked at Song Ci lying unconscious on the bed with tears streaming down her face. He frowned. \u201cWhat happened to your wife?\u201d\n Han Zhan stood by the window with his hands on his hips. \u201cSong Fei is dead.\u201d\n Li Li paled. \u201cHow...\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s true. She died in an explosion.\u201d\n Hearing this, Li Li was stunned.\n Looking at Song Ci\u2019s tear-streaked face, Li Li couldn\u2019t help feeling worried. \u201cWhat should Madam do? She waited so long for her elder sister to wake up. It has only been a few months since the reunion and Song Fei is already dead...\u201d\n This is bringing her to heaven and then kicking her back to hell!\n It\u2019s too cruel!\n Han Zhan sat on the sofa in frustration and remained silent.\n Li Li was very worried about Song Ci, and advised Han Zhan not to come to work tomorrow. \u201cYou should spend more time with your wife. Don\u2019t let her be alone. I\u2019m afraid she might take things too hard.\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d Han Zhan couldn\u2019t just leave all his work behind. He said to Li Li, \u201cKT Consortium\u2019s Long Zhize will arrive at Wangdong tomorrow afternoon and will be visiting the Zeus spaceship research and development center. Li Li, you go receive him on my behalf.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci had been in a daze for several days after Song Fei\u2019s death.\n On this day, dark clouds covered the blue sky. The dark sky looked like it was going to fall at any moment, suffocating everyone.\n Song Ci sat by the French window and scrolled through her conversation with Song Fei. Although she didn\u2019t cry again, she looked very frail.\n Han Zhan draped a windbreaker over her and turned off her phone screen.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t move. She was like a wooden statue.\n \u201cBaby Ci.\u201d Han Zhan held her cold fingers and told her, \u201cToday is the day of the return of the overseas citizens of J Nation...\u201d Han Zhan saw Song Ci\u2019s eyes roll a few times and said,\u201d It\u2019s also the day of Song Fei\u2019s return. We have to fetch her. \u201d\n Song Ci nodded gently.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Today, a group of reporters had arrived at the airport and their cameras were all focused on the exit.\n Ten minutes later, the citizens of Country J were about to emerge. It was said that the ashes of the virus specialist, Ms. Song Fei, would also arrive today. The reporters all wanted to capture this heart-wrenching scene.\n Song Ci stood with all the family members, quietly gazing at the exit. Some of the reporters recognized Song Ci and felt that it was strange.\n Footsteps and voices suddenly sounded from the other side of the corridor. Everyone looked up and saw a group of people emerging. There were men and women, young and old.\n Returning to the country and stepping on Chinese soil, these Chinese citizens who had just experienced a life-and-death situation finally smiled in relief.\n After smiling, they felt like crying.\n What is a country?\n Their country was the father of 1.4 billion Chinese citizens. When one was faced with a storm outside, he would be your safe haven. With the country by one\u2019s side, one would never drift around without anyone to depend on.\n The family members found their families and ran up to hug them. Some were crying, some were cheering. The reporters were busy snapping photos. The happy scene was heartwarming.\n But soon, another group of people appeared and disrupted the peace. They were a group of doctors. The oldest among them was in his fifties or sixties, while the youngest was in his thirties.\n The man in the lead was the most outstanding virus specialist in China, Fu Hanshen.\n Fu Hanshen was holding a small black box.\n The reporters hurried forward to interview Fu Hanshen. He told them a few things and said, \u201cLet\u2019s end the interview today. We are very tired and want to go back and rest.\u201d\n \u201cMr. Fu, you guys have worked hard. After you return to the country, have a good rest.\u201d The reporters were all very sensible and hurriedly retreated in unison.\n Holding Song Fei\u2019s ashes in his hands, Fu Hanshen scanned the family area and finally fixed his eyes on the back of the crowd.\n There was a woman in a black coat weeping silently.\n On the day her parents were buried, Song Ci also dressed in black and buried them all by herself. From that day onwards, black became Song Ci\u2019s most hated color.\n Song Ci walked out from the back of the crowd and stood in front of Fu Hanshen. She stared at his haggard face and said, \u201cTeacher Fu, sorry to trouble you.\u201d\n She placed her hands on Song Fei\u2019s ashes and touched that cold container. Song Ci was heartbroken at the thought that the proud Song Fei had become ashes in this container.\n \u201cElder Sister, Teacher Fu brought you back to the country. Now, I will bring you home.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "183": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-184\n\n Chapter 183: Let Him Enter Vertically and Come Out Horizontally  Hearing Song Ci call her elder sister, the reporters who were still nearby were all shocked. The deceased virus specialist, Song Fei, is actually Song Ci\u2019s elder sister!\n They immediately turned around and aimed their cameras at Song Ci and Fu Hanshen. They saw Fu Hanshen lower his head towards Song Ci and sob sorrowfully.\n \u201cOh, Song Ci, I am sorry that I didn\u2019t manage to bring Ah Fei back safely...\u201d His tone was sorrowful and he didn\u2019t even have the face to look up at Song Ci.\n Song Ci\u2019s tears landed on the urn and blurred her vision. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, Teacher Fu. This was Song Fei\u2019s own choice.\u201d Song Fei was such a stubborn person. Who could stop her from doing whatever she wanted?\n It was all her destiny.\n Rubbing the urn, Song Ci comforted Song Fei like a newborn baby. \u201cSong Fei, don\u2019t be afraid. I will send you to our parents\u2019 side. You won\u2019t be alone...\u201d\n Song Fei wouldn\u2019t be alone, I would.\n Song Fei finally abandoned me.\n From then on, Song Ci is truly an orphan.\n Song Ci carried Song Fei\u2019s urn and walked out of the main hall. Han Zhan followed behind her quietly like a guardian angel.\n The reporters were slightly hesitant. They wanted to go up and interview Song Ci to understand her relationship with Song Fei, but they were also worried.\n Fu Hanshen read their thoughts and couldn\u2019t help feeling disappointed. \u201cEveryone, go back. Don\u2019t disturb the peace of the dead.\u201d\n Hearing that, the reporters turned and left.\n As she walked out of the airport, raindrops landed on Song Ci\u2019s face. She looked up at the pitter-patter of rain in the sky. Afraid that Song Fei would be cold, she hurriedly took off her windbreaker and wrapped the urn tightly.\n Seeing this, Han Zhan hurriedly took off his own clothes and put them on for Song Ci.\n Song Ci glanced at Han Zhan and forced a smile. \u201cBrother Han, I am not cold.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be cold.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t say anything else and obediently draped Han Zhan\u2019s jacket over her shoulders, allowing him to hold her shoulders as they walked towards the parking lot.\n Walking into the parking lot, Song Ci and Han Zhan both noticed that beside their car stood a despondent, unshaven man.\n Only a few days ago at the wedding did Song Ci video-call Yan Jiang. Although Yan Jiang had lost some weight in that video, his slender, exquisite eyes were glowing with vigor.\n Unlike now, when everything was dark and lifeless, he was like a soulless corpse.\n Yan Jiang was emaciated and looked like a malnourished patient with a dull face. Song Ci had never seen such a dispirited Yan Jiang. She stared at him in a daze, her heart aching like a million knives.\n \u201cAh Jiang...\u201d She didn\u2019t dare to imagine Yan Jiang\u2019s pain. He had lost the person he loved the most!\n Having not eaten for a few days, Yan Jiang\u2019s body couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Step by step, he walked towards Song Ci, dragging his heavy body leisurely. He looked like he could collapse at any time, but his empty eyes were fixed on the urn in Song Ci\u2019s arms.\n Finally, he arrived before Song Ci safely.\n Lowering his head to cover his moist eyes, Yan Jiang spoke in a low, raspy voice. \u201cSong Song, can you give me your elder sister\u2019s ashes?\u201d\n He knew that Song Ci was the one most qualified to deal with Song Fei\u2019s funeral, but he still overstepped his boundaries.\n \u201cAh Jiang, Song Fei is already dead. She is dead...\u201d Shocked, Song Ci instinctively hugged the urn tightly, her hoarse voice reminding Yan Jiang that Song Fei had already passed away.\n Although she couldn\u2019t bear to, Song Ci still wanted to shatter Yan Jiang\u2019s wishful thinking. \u201cOnce one dies, everything will be gone. What\u2019s the point of having this pile of ashes?\u201d\n Yan Jiang blinked his moist lashes.\n He gave a bitter laugh, a particularly ugly one. \u201cI know she\u2019s dead. I just want her to be by my side. With her by my side, I won\u2019t be afraid of the dark anymore.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n \u201cNo.\u201d Song Ci still rejected Yan Jiang. \u201cOne must look ahead. Ah Jiang, you cannot just stand at your original spot and not come out.\u201d\n Taking a step back, Song Ci tightened her grip on the urn. \u201cI won\u2019t give you my elder sister\u2019s urn. I believe she doesn\u2019t want to see you like this either. I will bury my elder sister beside my parents\u2019 tombstones. They will reunite underground.\u201d\n Hearing this, Yan Jiang looked like he was going to cry. But in the end, he didn\u2019t do anything but just turned and left in silence. The back view of him walking alone was heart-wrenching.\n Rejecting Yan Jiang didn\u2019t make Song Ci feel good either. Han Zhan hugged Song Ci and said, \u201cYou did the right thing. He can\u2019t take away Song Fei\u2019s ashes.\u201d One couldn\u2019t imagine what a person would do when he went crazy.\n Song Ci acknowledged.\n \u201cYan Jiang is in a daze now. Let\u2019s send him back.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The two of them followed Yan Jiang all the way and saw him boarding the car of his former assistant, Ah Lun. Song Ci hurriedly opened her WeChat and sent a message to Ah Lun, asking him to stay by Yan Jiang\u2019s side these few days and not leave him.\n Ah Lun also knew that there was something amiss with Yan Jiang\u2019s condition. Worried that Yan Jiang might act up, he promised Song Ci that he would never leave Yan Jiang\u2019s side.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan watched as Ah Lun sent Yan Jiang home and didn\u2019t come out again before leaving.\n Song Ci had wanted to choose a good day to bury Song Fei, but the never superstitious Han Zhan found a respectable old gentleman and chose a suitable day for Song Fei to be buried.\n The old gentleman calculated and said that the best time was to wait another 10 days.\n Song Ci felt that Song Fei\u2019s life was too tough in this life and hoped that she could live a more relaxed and happy life in the next. As such, she listened to Old Master\u2019s arrangements.\n Luckily, Song Fei\u2019s body had already been cremated and there was only ashes left. There was no need to worry about the rotting smell of her bones. Song Ci agreed.\n She had placed Song Fei\u2019s ashes in the resting hall and planned to bury her some time later.\n Knowing that Song Fei had passed away, Du Tingting wanted to accompany Song Ci. But she had not finished her confinement and couldn\u2019t go out, so she called Song Ci to comfort her.\n Song Ci chatted with Du Tingting for a long time and finally felt better.\n After hanging up, Du Tingting called Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu answered the call and greeted her. Du Tingting asked her, \u201cAre you upstairs or at home?\u201d\n \u201cUpstairs.\u201d\n \u201cCome to my room. I have something for you to do.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mu Qiu came down very quickly. She pushed open the door to the master bedroom and saw Du Tingting sitting by the bed, staring at a huge pile of things in a daze. Walking over, Mu Qiu realized that those were baby clothes that had been packed.\n Du Tingting and Mu Mian were very happy to have a child at such an old age. They had bought many clothes and toys for the baby. \u201cHelp me bring them to the donation box outside the community. Donate everything. It will be a waste to keep them.\u201d\n Du Tingting had completely let it go.\n She was not fated to have that child. It would be a waste to keep these things and might as well donate them to someone who truly needed them. It could also be considered accumulating good karma for that child.\n She wished that he could reincarnate and find a better family and a better mother.\n Mu Qiu opened the bag and took a look. She said, \u201cThey\u2019re all brand new. I\u2019ll just donate them to a charity organization. I\u2019 m afraid that someone will try to sell them again, if we place them in a donation box.\u201d\n \u201cAlright.\u201d\n There were quite a lot of things. Mu Qiu sent them downstairs in two trips and stuffed them into the boot. She drove out of the house and along the shaded asphalt road. Mu Qiu kept an eye on the pedestrians at the side of the road as she drove.\n Suddenly, a tall, straight male figure entered her line of sight.\n Brother Mo?\n Mu Qiu thought she had seen wrongly. She stopped the car, lowered the window, and stared at that person carefully.\n That man was wearing a mocha-colored casual suit. He had one hand on his hip as he stood at the entrance of the villa, talking on the phone. Just by looking at his back view, one could tell that he was very handsome.\n Mu Qiu alighted and walked toward that person. Standing behind the man, Mu Qiu asked hesitantly, \u201cBrother Mo?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo turned and saw Mu Qiu. He couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cPanda pajamas?\u201d He stared at Mu Qiu\u2019s light pink panda pajamas and couldn\u2019t resist reaching out to stroke Mu Qiu\u2019s panda ears on her head.\n Mu Qiu blushed slightly.\n It really is Cheng Yanmo.\n Mu Qiu turned and sized up the luggage on the floor, slightly surprised. \u201cI heard that the Lin family moved out the night before yesterday and sold their house to a mysterious person.\u201d Looking up at Cheng Yanmo\u2019s sharp, handsome face, Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cSo Brother Mo is that mysterious person.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo glanced behind him and said, \u201cThe house with two Arhat Roses planted at the door\u2014is that your house?\u201d\n Mu Qiu looked back and saw the two beautifully-trimmed Luohan Pines. She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s my house. We are so close to each other.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo replied, \u201cMmm, I want to be closer to you.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was stunned.\n A hint of loneliness flashed across her face, but was quickly replaced by joy. \u201cI\u2019ll come look for you later. I have something on now.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s car drove past the entrance of Cheng Yanmo\u2019s Family villa. He looked at the back of the car until it disappeared before turning back. He heard the butler say, \u201cDo you know Miss Mu, Young Master?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Thinking of Mu Qiu, Cheng Yanmo smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s a very cute girl.\u201d\n Seeing that the Young Master liked that lady from the Mu Family, the butler was slightly worried. \u201cBut I heard that this Miss Mu has heart disease and doesn\u2019t have much time left...\u201d\n As he spoke, he observed Cheng Yanmo\u2019s reaction very carefully.\n Cheng Yanmo looked displeased. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this.\u201d Why did everyone have to remind me that Mu Qiu didn\u2019t have much time left?\n Seeing that Cheng Yanmo\u2019s attitude changed so easily, the butler thought of something and mentioned, \u201cYesterday, I brought someone over to tidy up the house and heard that the Madam of the Mu Family suffered a miscarriage. Since you know this Miss Mu, you should go over and sit around when you\u2019re free.\u201d\n \u201cMrs. Mu suffered a miscarriage? When did this happen?\u201d\n \u201cAbout a week.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo suddenly remembered something. About a week ago, Mu Qiu had said that she wanted to visit him at his company. He waited for a long time but Mu Qiu didn\u2019t appear. He called her and heard that she was at the hospital with her mother and that Mrs. Mu was unwell.\n It must have been that day when Mrs. Mu miscarriaged.\n \u201cPrepare the gifts. I will visit the Mu Family later.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mu Qiu found the delivery company and sent the clothes. When she returned, she saw Cheng Yanmo carrying gifts to her doorstep.\n \u201cBrother Mo, are you visiting my house as a guest?\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s face was slightly red. Is this considered a visit to her parents?\n Cheng Yanmo signaled for Mu Qiu to open the door. He said, \u201cI just moved in. It\u2019s a courtesy to visit my neighbors.\u201d\n Mu Qiu opened the door and led him in. She smiled at Cheng Yanmo. \u201cThere are over 30 families in the Amethyst Gated Community. Have you visited all of them?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo glanced at her meaningfully before saying leisurely, \u201cThe other families don\u2019t have beautiful daughters.\u201d He had other motives.\n Mu Qiu lowered her head at his teasing.\n Du Tingting was drinking fruit juice in the kitchen when she heard someone talking in the courtyard. She drew the curtains and saw Mu Qiu walking backwards with her back facing the house. She was talking to a man. \u201cQiu-er, who are you talking to?\u201d\n A hint of panic flashed across Mu Qiu\u2019s face. She looked very much like a puppy who had been caught red-handed by her parents.\n Cheng Yanmo stared at the flustered Mu Qiu and thought to himself that she was indeed a young lady. She\u2019s so adorable when she\u2019s dating secretly.\n Mu Qiu pretended to be calm and composed. She turned and looked at Du Tingting. \u201cMother, this is our new neighbor. He specially came over to visit us.\u201d\n Du Tingting was very welcoming and hurriedly got Mu Qiu to bring Cheng Yanmo home. \u201cQuickly invite him in.\u201d She turned and said to Auntie Zhang, \u201cSister Zhang, bring the tea set to the living room. We have a guest.\u201d\n Mu Qiu and Cheng Yanmo entered the Mu Family\u2019s living room. Coincidentally, Du Tingting was walking out of the kitchen.\n Du Tingting stopped in her tracks. She looked up and sized up her new neighbor seriously. When she saw Cheng Yanmo\u2019s face clearly, Du Tingting\u2019s eyes widened slightly.\n \u201cAre you the eldest son of the Cheng Family? Cheng Yanmo?\u201d Cheng Yanmo was too famous in Wangdong City. Du Tingting and Mu Mian had met Cheng Yanmo at several business banquets.\n Although this child was young, he was much more scheming than the average person. Mu Mian had said before that he was no match for this person.\n ]The lens blocked those fierce eyes and put on a layer of gentle skin for Cheng Yanmo.\n He nodded slightly and stared at Mu Qiu\u2019s head with a smile. \u201cI just moved over today and happened to meet Mu Qiu outside. We are good friends and heard that Aunty has just been discharged from the hospital, so I specially came over to visit.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo placed those precious skincare products on the table.\n ]\u201dIt\u2019s good enough that you are here. There\u2019s no need to bring gifts. You are too polite.\u201d Du Tingting quickly made Cheng Yanmo sit down. \u201cYoung Master Cheng, have a seat.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo unbuttoned his suit and sat down. Mu Qiu sat on the other side, not daring to look at Cheng Yanmo the entire time.\n Du Tingting didn\u2019t doubt the relationship between Cheng Yanmo and Mu Qiu. After all, they were eight to nine years apart in age, and different in experience and status. Subconsciously, Du Tingting felt that they wouldn\u2019t have any other relationship.\n Du Tingting personally poured a cup of tea for Cheng Yanmo. \u201cYoung Master Cheng, have some tea.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo accepted it with both hands and bowed very low. \u201cThank you.\u201d His humble and polite manner made Du Tingting feel that he was very well-mannered and knowledgeable.\n \u201cQiu-er, when did you get to know Mr. Cheng? Why haven\u2019t I heard of him?\u201d Du Tingting asked casually.\n Du Tingting basically knew all of Mu Qiu\u2019s friends. It was unusual for her to be friends with Cheng Yanmo, who was several years older than her.\n Mu Qiu fidgeted uneasily. She felt like Du Tingting had seen through her relationship with Cheng Yanmo. Cheng Yanmo was amused by Mu Qiu\u2019s flustered manner.\n \u201cIt was during Grandma Cheng\u2019s birthday party the other time. Father brought me to the Cheng Family. I met Mr. Cheng that day.\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s ears burned as she thought of what happened that night at the hotel.\n \u201cOh I see.\u201d\n Under Du Tingting\u2019s urging, Cheng Yanmo had lunch at the Mu Family residence.\n During the meal, Cheng Yanmo had a naughty thought. He intentionally held Mu Qiu\u2019s little hand under the table and stroked her slender legs.\n Mu Qiu sat like she was sitting on needles, her mind elsewhere as she ate.\n Du Tingting saw Mu Qiu frowning and chewing on her chopsticks anxiously, and put down her chopsticks.\n \u201cQiu-er, do you have no appetite?\u201d Worried that Mu Qiu was unwell and had no appetite, Du Tingting said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I get Sister Zhang to make you some dessert?\u201d\n Mu Qiu hurriedly shook her head and chewed on the bland rice in her mouth. After finishing the rice, Mu Qiu replied, \u201cI am not feeling unwell. I just feel like there is a red lump on my leg. It is slightly itchy.\u201d\n \u201cIs it hives?\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s skin was delicate and tender. She would easily get hives if there were more catkins in season.\n ]Mu Qiu acknowledged. \u201cProbably.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s some ointment in the medical kit. Apply some ointment after dinner. Don\u2019t damage your skin.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s itchy again.\u201d With that, Mu Qiu looked down, grabbed the culprit\u2019s hand, and bit the back of Cheng Yanmo\u2019s hand.\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s back was stiff from the pain.\n He sat up straight and waited for Mu Qiu to let go, before shaking his bitten fist.\n After dinner, Cheng Yanmo got up to bid farewell. Du Tingting got Mu Qiu to send him off.\n Mu Qiu got up obediently and followed Cheng Yanmo to the main door.\n After exiting the courtyard, they arrived at a spot where Du Tingting couldn\u2019t see. Cheng Yanmo raised his left hand and waved it at Mu Qiu\u2019s face. \u201cWere you born in the year of the dog? Why did you bite so hard?\u201d\n Mu Qiu stared at the two rows of red bite marks and felt slightly guilty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my first time biting someone and I didn\u2019t control my strength well.\u201d\n \u201cYou still wish for a next time.\u201d Cheng Yanmo stared at Mu Qiu\u2019s pure and lovely face. Thinking of that sharp tooth of hers, he sighed. \u201cHow vicious.\u201d\n \u201cVicious...\u201d Mu Qiu chuckled.\u201d Yes, I am indeed vicious. \u201d\n Cheng Yanmo pointed at his own house and continued teasing Mu Qiu. \u201cYour mother asked you to send me home. We are not there yet. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n Mu Qiu had no choice but to accompany Cheng Yanmo on another journey. When they arrived at Cheng Yanmo\u2019s doorstep, Mu Qiu stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re here, I\u2019m going back.\u201d\n She turned to leave, but Cheng Yanmo grabbed her by the waist and pulled her into his new home.\n Closing the door, Cheng Yanmo glanced in the direction of the Mu Family residence. Glancing at the figure of the woman behind the window on the second floor, Cheng Yanmo suddenly pushed Mu Qiu behind the door and kissed her without giving her any time to prepare herself.\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s kiss was ferocious and suggestive.\n Mu Qiu was soon panting heavily.\n \u201cCome in with me, alright?\u201d\n Panting, Mu Qiu nodded.\n Cheng Yanmo carried Mu Qiu into the living room, sat down boldly, and placed Mu Qiu on his lap. Cheng Yanmo lifted up a corner of her pajamas. Mu Qiu sensed Cheng Yanmo\u2019s intentions and hurriedly placed her hand on his chest.\n The upper half of their bodies were separated by a distance, while the lower half of their bodies were pressed together. \u201cMy mother is still waiting for me at home...\u201d What will it be if I send someone back without returning.\n \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just say that you had a cup of coffee at my place.\u201d It would take at least half an hour to brew a cup of coffee and finish it.\n Mu Qiu was not very determined and was easily convinced by Cheng Yanmo.\n \u2013\n Mu Qiu was afraid of being detected if she went home. She specially took a shower in Cheng Yanmo\u2019s master bedroom, before putting on her panda pajamas to go home.\n Du Tingting had yet to take her afternoon nap when she arrived home. She yawned and hugged a pillow as she dozed off.\n Du Tingting glanced at her and saw that she was neatly dressed. She looked down and asked, \u201cWhy did you take so long?\u201d\n Mu Qiu followed Cheng Yanmo\u2019s instructions and lied calmly. \u201cI had a cup of coffee and visited Mr. Cheng\u2019s new house.\u201d\n Du Tingting didn\u2019t probe further. She said, \u201cSister Zhang made you red date papaya soup with milk. Eat it and take an afternoon nap.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Du Tingting returned to her room after Mu Qiu finished her dessert. She opened the window and looked at the villa ahead. She felt very conflicted as she thought of what she had just seen.\n That young master from the Cheng Family had pressed Mu Qiu against the door of the courtyard and kissed her. Their kiss was so passionate\u2014one look and one could tell they were experienced.\n They were both adults and Du Tingting didn\u2019t believe that Mu Qiu had gone to Cheng Yanmo\u2019s house for coffee. What was Cheng Yanmo thinking? Didn\u2019t he know that Mu Qiu doesn\u2019t have much time left?\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart was heavy and she felt uneasy the entire afternoon.\n When Mu Mian came back from work that night, Du Tingting told him about it. \u201cA new neighbor has moved in from the Lin Family next door. It\u2019s Chuan Dong Group\u2019s Young Master Cheng Mo.\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Mian was more surprised than shocked. \u201cIs that so?\u201d It was a good thing to be neighbors with Cheng Yanmo.\n \u201cHe came to visit our house today and I asked him to stay for lunch.\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Mian\u2019s thoughts started to turn. It looked like Young Master Cheng had a good impression of them. He thought that he could deepen his relationship with Young Master Cheng and maybe even have business dealings with him in the future.\n But Du Tingting\u2019s next sentence stunned Mu Mian. \u201cHe seems to be Qiu-er\u2019s boyfriend. I saw them kissing in the courtyard of the Lin Family residence.\u201d\n \u201cCheng Yanmo and Qiu-er?\u201d Mu Mian felt that this was a little unreal. \u201cHow is that possible? They are several years apart in age and don\u2019t interact much. Moreover, why would someone like Cheng Yanmo like girls like our Mu Qiu?\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t that there weren\u2019t any ambiguous partners around Cheng Yanmo. But which one of them isn\u2019t a woman with big boobs, a big bum, good looks, and a good family background?\n It wasn\u2019t that Mu Mian felt that his daughter was worse than everyone else. It was just that Mu Qiu and Cheng Yanmo\u2019s ex-boyfriends were completely different.\n Regardless of whether it was Cheng Yanmo\u2019s rich family background, his capabilities and business acumen, he was one in a million. Mu Mian should have been happy to see Mu Qiu date a man like Cheng Yanmo.\n But Mu Qiu\u2019s days are numbered...\n However, thinking of the progress of another matter, a smile finally appeared on Mu Mian\u2019s face. \u201cCheng Yanmo is a good man. Mu Qiu has good taste and found an outstanding man.\u201d\n Du Tingting was taken aback by Mu Mian\u2019s words. \u201cHubby, don\u2019t you think this is a problem? Qiu-er doesn\u2019t have long to live. What will happen to Young Master Cheng if she dies?\u201d\n Du Tingting felt guilty towards Master Cheng.\n \u201cThey are both adults and are willing parties.\u201d Mu Mian was very open-minded about this matter. Seeing that Du Tingting was depressed and worried, Mu Mian shared a piece of good news with her. \u201cThere is new news from the organ library. We seem to have found a suitable heart for Qiu-er.\u201d\n Joy crept up Du Tingting\u2019s thin face. She grabbed Mu Mian\u2019s arm tightly and asked in a trembling voice, \u201cIs it true?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, that donor is critically ill, but she\u2019s still alive. We have to wait a little longer.\u201d\n \u201cGreat, this is great. I hope it is compatible!\u201d Du Tingting didn\u2019t wish for anyone else to die, but she wished for her daughter to live.\n Du Tingting\u2019s eyes lit up at the thought that Mu Qiu might survive.\n \u201cDon\u2019t tell Qiu-er about this first. We will tell her when the news is confirmed.\u201d Mu Mian warned Du Tingting.\n Du Tingting quickly acknowledged.\n \u2013\n That morning, Song Ci received a call from Ah Lun. \u201cSong Song, Brother Jiang is not in a good state of mind. Do you want to come over and visit him?\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\n Ah Lun spoke hesitantly. \u201cBrother Jiang seems to be having some mental issues. He often talks to himself in the air and laughs at the same time. I feel goosebumps just by looking at him.\u201d\n The thing that worried her the most still happened.\n Song Ci hung up, hurriedly changed clothes, and went to Yan Jiang\u2019s house.\n She pressed the doorbell, expecting to see Ah Lun opening the door. Instead, it was Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang was dressed exquisitely in a white blouse, beige pants, and a short black Chanel top. He was also the most handsome man in the entertainment circles.\n Yan Jiang suddenly smiled when he saw Song Ci standing outside the door. He held Song Ci\u2019s hand and rubbed it. \u201cAh Fei, why aren\u2019t you wearing a jacket? It\u2019s quite cold outside today. Your hands look cold.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci felt like she had fallen into an icehouse.\n Coincidentally, the winds were strong today and she wasn\u2019t in the mood to dress up. She found a long-sleeved hoodie and put it on before driving over to meet Yan Jiang.\n Song Ci and Song Fei looked exactly the same. With a sweater and a ponytail, they looked even more alike.\n Yan Jiang pulled Song Ci into the house. Yan Jiang kept talking. \u201cYou said you would be back soon. Ah Lun made lunch and the food is getting cold.\u201d He pressed Song Ci down on the dining chair.\n Yan Jiang opened the food container and scooped a bowl of cod porridge for Song Ci. \u201cHere, have this.\u201d\n After looking at Yan Jiang for a moment, Song Ci picked up her spoon, scooped up a spoonful of cod porridge, and shoved it into her mouth. It tasted very fresh and tender. She took two bites and felt very upset.\n At the dining table, Yan Jiang was all smiles as he kept putting food into Song Ci\u2019s bowl. Song Ci ate everything. \u201cI am full.\u201d\n Yan Jiang then stopped putting food into her bowl.\n Noticing that Yan Jiang didn\u2019t eat anything, Song Ci purposely put on a cold expression and imitated Song Fei\u2019s tone. \u201cYou eat.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was indeed very obedient. He ate mouthful after mouthful of rice, but didn\u2019t put much other dishes into his mouth.\n Song Ci stared at him silently, feeling very upset. After dinner, Yan Jiang dragged Song Ci to the theater and found a French movie called \u201cThe Butterfly.\u201d\n \u201cYou mentioned that you wanted to watch this movie previously. I found it.\u201d This was something Song Fei had mentioned to Yan Jiang at Golden Sands.\n Song Ci sat down and watched the movie with Yan Jiang.\n The entire movie had beautiful scenery, a warm rhythm, and the interactions between the little girl and her grandfather were lively and interesting. This was supposed to be a movie that would make one happy, but Song Ci kept increasingly silent the more she watched.\n Finally, the movie ended.\n Yan Jiang was about to switch to a new movie when he heard Song Ci call his name. \u201cAh Jiang.\u201d Yan Jiang turned and gazed at Song Ci patiently and gently.\n Song Ci suddenly reached out her right hand and cupped Yan Jiang\u2019s much thinner face.\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n Song Ci lifted her head and leaned her cheek against Yan Jiang\u2019s.\n She looked like she was going to kiss him.\n Just as Song Ci\u2019s lips were about to touch Yan Jiang\u2019s, he suddenly turned away. \u201cDo you want to watch a maritime pianist in another movie?\u201d\n Song Ci sat back down.\n She pointed out calmly and mercilessly. \u201cYou know I am not her. Ah Jiang, are you still going to deceive yourself?\u201d\n Yan Jiang remained motionless.\n \u201cIf you really treated me like her, you wouldn\u2019t have reacted like this when I kissed you just now. How could you bear to reject Song Fei\u2019s initiative?\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear to see Yan Jiang\u2019s tightly pursed lips and downcast eyes. However, she had no choice but to tell him. \u201cYan Jiang, I am not her. You know that.\u201d\n Yan Jiang suddenly covered his face with his hands. His shoulders were shaking slightly and his throat was moving up and down. Hot tears were squeezed between his fingers.\n \u201cSong Song...\u201d Yan Jiang broke the silence. His voice was hoarse like a gauze cut by a sharp knife.\u201d She is dead...\u201d\n \u201cAh Fei is dead. Her body is incomplete!\u201d He cried so bitterly that he was momentarily speechless. Song Ci hurriedly got up, walked up to Yan Jiang, hugged his head, and pulled him into her arms.\n \u201cThere are broken limbs all over the floor. I searched everywhere for her head, but I couldn\u2019t find it. Song Song, I lost your sister...\u201d\n Yan Jiang had once heard that if a person didn\u2019t have a complete corpse, they wouldn\u2019t be able to enter hell after death. They would turn into wandering ghosts, wandering around the land of death day and night, searching for their bodies.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s heart ached like a million daggers at the thought of his Ah Fei being trapped in a foreign land forever.\n Like a little kid, Yan Jiang hugged Song Ci\u2019s waist tightly. His tears and mucus rubbed against Song Ci\u2019s sweater. That was the first time Yan Jiang cried in front of Song Ci. He had lost all face and image.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes were also red. She couldn\u2019t help crying bitterly alongside Yan Jiang.\n After some time, Song Ci finally realized that Yan Jiang had stopped talking. She felt very uneasy and thought that he must have fainted. She looked down and realized that he was just sleeping.\n She just hugged Yan Jiang, not daring to let go or move.\n After a while, Ah Lun entered.\n He saw that Yan Jiang had finally fallen asleep and told Song Ci the truth. \u201cBrother Jiang hasn\u2019t slept for the past few days. He doesn\u2019t seem to be tired at all. I am really worried that he will faint and never get up again. Song Song, thank you so much for coming today.\u201d\n \u201cYou should have called me over earlier.\u201d Song Ci had been living in a daze these few days and didn\u2019t consider the situation at Yan Jiang\u2019s side.\n She felt slightly guilty for neglecting Yan Jiang.\n In order to take care of Yan Jiang these few days, Ah Lun didn\u2019t have a good rest and he had eye bags. Song Ci told Ah Lun, \u201cCome over and help me, Ah Lun. Let\u2019s send him back to his room to sleep. You should also go and sleep. Don\u2019t tire yourself out.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was truly too fatigued. He didn\u2019t wake up no matter how Song Ci and Ah Lun rubbed and pinched him.\n After laying Yan Jiang down in the master bedroom, Song Ci turned on the wall lamp in case he was afraid of the dark when he woke up at night. \u201cAh Lun, quickly go and rest. I will go back now.\u201d\n Ah Lun really couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He yawned and returned to his guest bedroom to rest.\n Song Ci went downstairs to clean up the bottles and jars in the kitchen. She washed her hands before leaving.\n Instead of going home, she went to the Hall of Peace.\n Standing in the main hall of the Hall of Peace, Song Ci stared at Song Fei\u2019s ashes. She smiled bitterly and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cSong Fei, are you satisfied? Are you satisfied to see Ah Jiang going crazy over you?\u201d\n How could Song Fei answer her?\n She stroked the cold urn for a long time before leaning against the cupboard and crying. \u201cSong Fei, I miss you so much!\u201d\n But I will never see you again. (itallics)\n \u2013\n Song Ci walked out of the hall and saw Han Zhan.\n \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d After crying, Song Ci\u2019s voice sounded like a broken gong. It was strangely piercing.\n \u201cAh Song told me.\u201d Han Zhan walked over and covered Song Ci\u2019s eyes. \u201cGo home, you should go back and have a good sleep too.\u201d\n Han Zhan carried Song Ci and placed her in the car. Inside the car, Han Zhan was still carrying Song Ci like he was carrying a child.\n \u201cClose your eyes and don\u2019t open them.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s tone was domineering and irrefutable.\n Song Ci was also really tired. She closed her eyes and allowed herself to fall asleep in Han Zhan\u2019s arms. The car drove slowly and gently. Song Ci actually really fell asleep.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached slightly as he looked at Song Ci\u2019s face that had lost a lot of weight recently. Returning home, he carried Song Ci to the bed and was about to take a shower when his cell phone suddenly vibrated.\n A cold glint flashed across Han Zhan\u2019s eyes when he saw the words \u2018Newbridge Hospital\u2019s doctor\u2019.\n He picked up his cell phone and walked out of the master bedroom to the meeting room.\n \u201cMr. Han.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t respond.\n On the other end, the man spoke carefully. \u201cI\u2019ve already received that sum of money from you. Thank you, Mr. Han. As for the remaining 20 million...\u201d\n \u201cAfter everything is settled, I will transfer that sum of money to your child. With that money, it will be enough for him to finish high school and university. After he graduates, he will also be able to buy a decent house.\u201d If he was good at wealth management, he might even have enough money to get a wife.\n With nothing to worry about, the man finally felt at ease. \u201cThank you, Mr. Han. I will definitely do my best to carry out your instructions.\u201d\n Han Zhan interrupted him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do your best. I just want you to do it properly.\u201d\n \u201cIf this fails, Dr. Zhu, you will be jailed and dragged out horizontally.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s tone was rather casual, but his words sent chills down one\u2019s spine.\n Han Zhan steadily nailed an iron nail into the other party\u2019s heart, making him uneasy. \u201cI will definitely do it well!\u201d\n Han Zhan hung up the phone and unbuttoned his shirt impatiently. He cursed. \u201cSilly thing. You should be put in jail instead.\u201d\n After scolding him, Han Zhan resumed his calm and steady manner.\n \u2013\n Newbridge Hospital was a private hospital. It was established 30 years ago. The first director was Du Lengchuan, Du Tingting\u2019s father.\n After Du Lengchuan passed away, Newbridge Hospital became Du Tingting\u2019s property. All these years, Du Tingting had led a pampered life and was in no mood to manage her assets.\n As a result, although the hospital\u2019s chairman was Du Tingting in name, the person in charge was actually Mu Mian.\n Newbridge Hospital Building 2 was the inpatient department. Level 8 was the chairman\u2019s activity level. All medical staff, patients, and family members were not allowed to enter.\n Late at night, a lamp on the eighth floor lit up.\n Mu Mian walked in from outside. The lights along the corridor cast his shadow on the floor, elongating it into the shape of a demon.\n Mu Mian entered the ward and stared at the woman lying limply on the bed after being injected with sleeping pills. The girl was thin and frail, and her originally fair cheeks were deathly pale under the light.\n No one expected the cremated Song Fei to be lying on the eighth floor of Newbridge Hospital!\n Song Fei\u2019s hands and legs were tied to the four corners of the bed. She had lost all mobility and couldn\u2019t escape even if she had wings!\n Song Fei was already awake, but the effects of the medicine had yet to fade. Her voice was soft and she couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. She could only open them slightly.\n Mu Mian walked to the side of the bed and looked down at Song Fei. \u201cYou are awake.\u201d Mu Mian\u2019s tone was calm, without the slightest hint of uneasiness or panic that a murderer should have.\n Song Fei narrowed her eyes at Mu Mian. Her lips moved but she couldn\u2019t speak.\n Mu Mian suddenly said, \u201cActually, you must have regained consciousness that time.\u201d Mu Mian\u2019s words came out of nowhere but Song Fei understood what he said.\n Mu Mian said, \u201cAt the convalescent hospital, I took your blood and sent it to be tested for compatibility with Mu Qiu\u2019s blood. The next night, you went missing. You sensed danger and escaped when I wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s disappearance disrupted all of Mu Mian\u2019s plans, which troubled him for quite a while. \u201cSong Fei, you have really impressed me.\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s lips quivered as if she had something to say.\n Thinking that she was weak, Mu Mian bent down considerately and put on a listening expression. \u201cGo ahead, I\u2019m listening.\u201d With that, Mu Mian heard Song Fei say \u2014\n \u201cF*ck your mother.\u201d\n Then, Song Fei spat on Mu Mian\u2019s face.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "184": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-185\n\n Chapter 184: Finish Them Off in One Swoop  That mouthful of saliva landed on Mu Mian\u2019s face. Just as he reached out to wipe it off, it fell to the ground again.\n Mu Mian\u2019s face twitched. He took two deep breaths to suppress the strong urge to beat Song Fei up.\n \u201cYou sure are arrogant.\u201d Mu Mian gave a fake smile. He took out a few pieces of paper, crushed them into a ball, and shoved them into Song Fei\u2019s mouth roughly. \u201cYou only have two days left to live. Let\u2019s see how long you can continue being arrogant for.\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s face was full of disdain. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to look at him. Her eyes ached whenever she looked at Mu Mian.\n Song Fei\u2019s frivolous manner was really asking for a beating in Mu Mian\u2019s eyes. Worried that he would not be able to resist the urge to hit her if he stayed any longer, Mu Mian turned and left.\n The room was plunged into complete darkness.\n Song Fei quietly gazed into the darkness. She missed that guy who was afraid of the dark. I wonder what he\u2019s doing now...\n \u2013\n Walking out of Song Fei\u2019s ward, Mu Mian saw a black figure standing at the end of the corridor. He turned on his toes and walked towards that figure.\n \u201cWhen will it be better to hold the surgery?\u201d Mu Mian stood in a dark corner and spoke to the person in front of him.\n \u201cI\u2019ve already started preparing. The plan will be launched the day after tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Mu Mian patted the man\u2019s shoulder and sighed. \u201cHead of Department Zhu, do your best. If you succeed, I will make you the director.\u201d\n Zhu Yuanwen nodded slightly and said respectfully, \u201cI will do my best.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Walking out of the hospital, Mu Mian stood at the main entrance of Newbridge Hospital. He looked up at the pitch-black eighth floor, before quickly boarding the car.\n Sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, Mu Mian loosened his tie, feeling very frustrated.\n Actually, he was not as calm as he looked. This was murder\u2014murder for his own daughter! A living person!\n Unable to calm himself down, Mu Mian hurriedly switched on the light and searched the interior of the car. He finally found a pack of cigarettes. He took one out, lit it up quickly, and took a big drag.\n Smoking was a good thing. It could numb one\u2019s conscience.\n Under the comforts of the nicotine, Mu Mian gradually regained his composure. He waited for the cigarette to finish, before starting the car and driving away.\n Right after he left, a girl wearing a greyish-black hoodie appeared at the spot where he had parked his car. She paused for a moment before striding over to the main entrance of Newbridge Hospital.\n Standing at the main door, she lifted her head like how Mu Mian did before and looked upstairs. Staring at that pitch-black floor, Mu Qiu\u2019s gaze wavered slightly.\n What is hidden there?\n The dark and empty 8th floor was like the stomach of a monster, quietly swallowing up all strangers who stepped into its territory.\n Her flat shoes made dull thuds as she stepped on the floor tiles of the corridor. The weak green light of the fire exit shone on Mu Qiu\u2019s face. Her fair face was slightly green, like a demon that had just emerged from hell.\n From left to right, Mu Qiu tried to push open each door. After opening seven to eight doors in a row, she finally found the handle to open one.\n Mu Qiu grasped the handle and smiled.\n I found you!\n Click.\n The door opened.\n Inside the house, the person lying on the bed moved her limbs. The fabric of her clothes made a soft rubbing sound on the bed. In the darkness, a pair of ice-cold eyes stared at Mu Qiu with no emotion.\n Hearing the noise, Mu Qiu\u2019s lips curled up even more. She turned and faced the direction of the bed.\n Using the neon lights from the road outside the building, Mu Qiu saw a person tied to the bed. The light was dim, and the person was thin and indistinguishable from a male or female.\n Mu Qiu strode over to the bed and bent over slightly. She stared at the woman\u2019s face for a long while before saying with a smile, \u201cHello, Song Fei.\u201d\n She wasn\u2019t at all surprised, as if she had expected to see Song Fei here.\n Song Fei moved but didn\u2019t speak.\n \u201cSo your mouth is blocked.\u201d Mu Qiu reached out to take the ball of paper from Song Fei\u2019s mouth. As she did so, she complained unhappily about Mu Mian. \u201cWhy is Father so rough? It\u2019s so uncomfortable to keep your mouth shut.\u201d\n Song Fei regained the right to speak. \u201cYou have impressed me.\u201d Her words were more sarcastic than complimentary.\n Mu Qiu frowned slightly, as if she didn\u2019t understand Mu Qiu\u2019s words.\n \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know.\u201d Song Fei smirked. \u201cSo you are the big bad wolf hiding behind the scenes.\u201d\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t agree with Song Fei\u2019s comment. She spoke calmly and corrected Song Fei\u2019s statement. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. All of this was planned by my father. Unfortunately, you have the same blood as me and are compatible with my antibodies.\u201d\n As she spoke, Mu Qiu\u2019s expression was very innocent, as if she had suffered a great grievance.\n \u201cStop pretending to be innocent in front of me. I feel like puking just looking at you.\u201d Song Fei\u2019s voice was ice-cold, like the snow in the winter and the icy plains in the high mountains. It was also pleasant to hear such vulgarities in her voice.\n Song Fei stared at Mu Qiu\u2019s face and thought it was funny. \u201cYou are pure and holy, you are even purer than a glutinous rice ball. You are the only innocent person in the world.\u201d\n After being scolded, Mu Qiu remained silent. The grievance on her face disappeared and was replaced by a grim expression. \u201cYou are both sisters, but your tongue stinks a lot more than Song Ci\u2019s.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was speaking the truth and Song Fei didn\u2019t retort. Song Fei was curious about something. \u201cIf Mu Mian knows that the precious daughter he is trying so hard to save is a black-hearted venomous snake, I wonder if he will feel comforted or disappointed.\u201d\n Mu Qiu said firmly, \u201cHe won\u2019t know.\u201d No one would know Mu Qiu\u2019s true colors.\n Song Fei snorted again. \u201cYour father wants to kill me and dig out my heart to save you. What do you think of this?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do I think?\u201d Mu Qiu placed her slender fingers on Song Fei\u2019s chest and stroked it gently. She smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything. I only know that I was critically ill and in a coma. Coincidentally, someone who was compatible with my antibodies died in an accident.\u201d\n \u201cThat kind-hearted person gave me her heart. I will continue to live on with a grateful heart and her regrets.\u201d\n Hearing that, even Song Fei was stunned by Mu Qiu\u2019s shamelessness. \u201cDigging out a living person\u2019s heart to extend your own life? Mu Qiu, aren\u2019t you afraid of having nightmares?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was still smiling but her eyes had turned vicious. \u201cYou are wrong. That is a heart donated by a kind-hearted person. Why would I have a nightmare?\u201d\n \u201c...\u201d Damn it!\n Deep down, she was labeling Mu Qiu as shameless. Song Fei couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cA person like you deserves to live. It\u2019s a waste of talent if you died. It\u2019s up to you to protect Earth.\u201d\n Faced with Song Fei\u2019s mockery, not only was Mu Qiu not angry, she even smiled and said, \u201cThank you for thinking so highly of me. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t waste this heart of yours.\u201d They chatted with sincerity and warmth, as if they were good friends talking about the weather today and if it was suitable for fishing.\n Staring at Song Fei with a gentle gaze, Mu Qiu actually comforted her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Song Ci. I will treat her very well in the future. I will treat her like my biological sister.\u201d\n Treat Song Ci well?\n Song Fei felt that Mu Qiu\u2019s words were hypocritical and laughable at the thought of Song Ci\u2019s tragic plight in her previous life. \u201cIf your heart deteriorates again and you can\u2019t find a suitable heart, will you not let Song Ci off then?\u201d\n Hearing Song Fei\u2019s question, Mu Qiu was momentarily stunned and couldn\u2019t quite answer.\n \u201cLook, you keep saying that you will treat Song Ci as your biological sister but you will still kill her for your own wretched life.\u201d Song Fei saw through Mu Qiu\u2019s despicable soul. \u201cMu Qiu, you are really a jerk.\u201d\n \u201cWhat a waste of time!\u201d\n Song Fei was slightly impressed by Mu Qiu. This dog looked gentle and obedient, but actually had a black heart.\n Mu Qiu suddenly took out a few more pieces of paper, crushed them into a ball, and stuffed them into Song Fei\u2019s mouth. The entire world went silent. Mu Qiu\u2019s panicky heart finally calmed down.\n \u201cHave a good rest. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n After being attacked, Mu Qiu hurriedly left.\n \u2013\n Mu Mian returned home and saw that the living room was empty. He went upstairs to the third floor to speak to Mu Qiu.\n \u201cQiu-er, are you asleep?\u201d Mu Mian knocked on the door but there was no reply. He opened the door and realized that Mu Qiu was not at home.\n Where did she go?\n Mu Mian returned to the master bedroom on the second floor. Seeing that Du Tingting was still playing on her cell phone, he asked her, \u201cQiu-er isn\u2019t back yet?\u201d\n \u201cShe said she wanted to drink milk tea and went out to buy it.\u201d Du Tingting switched off her cell phone and curled up in bed. Her neck was completely hidden under the blanket, revealing only her face.\n Staring at Mu Mian\u2019s slightly messy tie, Du Tingting couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhere did you go? Your tie is all messed up.\u201d Thinking of a certain possibility, Du Tingting\u2019s face darkened slightly. She tried to intimidate Mu Mian. \u201cHubby, did you go fool around?\u201d\n It had been two to three months since she got pregnant and went into confinement, and they had not done anything passionate, so Du Tingting couldn\u2019t help overthinking things. Mu Mian had been very disciplined and doted on her all these years, but men were the most fickle creatures. He could do whatever he wanted with other women.\n Mu Mian felt wronged by Du Tingting\u2019s misunderstanding. \u201cNo way. I went to Newbridge Hospital to discuss Qiu-er\u2019s heart transplant with Head of Department Zhu.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d Du Tingting saw that Mu Mian didn\u2019t look like he was lying and felt slightly more at ease. \u201cLet me tell you, if you dare to find another woman outside, I won\u2019t want you anymore.\u201d\n Although Du Tingting was gentle and considerate, she was not the kind of weak wife who would allow her husband to fool around outside. Once she discovered that Mu Mian had someone else outside, she would cleanly kick him away.\n \u201cOf course it\u2019s true. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can call Head of Department Zhu.\u201d Mu Mian purposely put on a cold face and reprimanded Du Tingting. \u201cDon\u2019t you know whether I love you or not? If that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t say it again.\u201d\n Mu Mian was truly devoted to Du Tingting. From the day he met Du Tingting in university, there was no other woman in his eyes.\n Du Tingting finally believed Mu Mian\u2019s words. \u201cWhat did Head of Department Zhu say about the surgery?\u201d\n \u201cThis matter should be settled. That organ donor\u2019s health is deteriorating. She can only live for the next two days. Our Qiu-er should be undergoing surgery soon.\u201d\n \u201cThat would be great.\u201d\n Du Tingting calmed down and was about to go to bed when her cell phone suddenly rang. \u201cWho called so late at night?\u201d\n Puzzled, Du Tingting picked up her cell phone and saw Qiu-er\u2019s name. She muttered. \u201cIs this girl staying out tonight?\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Mian instinctively glanced over at Cheng Yanmo\u2019s house. Seeing that Cheng Yanmo\u2019s house was dark, Mu Mian\u2019s expression was also slightly unreadable.\n Are they having a secret rendezvous outside?\n Du Tingting answered the call. \u201cQiu-er, why aren\u2019t you back yet?\u201d\n \u201cHello!\u201d\n Unexpectedly, an unfamiliar male voice spoke from the other end of the call.\n Du Tingting\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cHi, where\u2019s my daughter?\u201d\n Du Tingting was worried that Mu Qiu might have encountered some evil person or pervert. After all, Mu Qiu was beautiful and it was night time now. As a mother, she couldn\u2019t help feeling uneasy.\n Mu Mian saw that Du Tingting\u2019s expression had changed. He quickly took her cell phone and placed it beside his ear.\n Mu Mian heard her say, \u201cYour daughter suddenly fainted from a heart attack at the roadside. We have already performed CPR on her and she is currently unconscious.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve already called an ambulance for her and are waiting for it. You must be this lady\u2019s mother. Hurry over!\u201d\n Mu Mian was stunned by this news. \u201cWhere is the address? We are coming over now!\u201d His heart was in turmoil and his voice was trembling.\n The other party said, \u201cBig Tree Street in the East Mountain District, at the bubble tea shop beside Walmart!\u201d\n After ending the call, Mu Mian grabbed Du Tingting\u2019s hand and said with a dark expression, \u201cTingting, it\u2019s like this. Qiu-er suffered a heart attack and was luckily saved by someone. She is currently in a coma.\u201d\n Du Tingting covered her mouth and nearly cried. \u201cWhy is it acting up again?!\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t cry first. Put on your jacket. We are going to the East Mountain District hospital now!\u201d\n Du Tingting nodded. With Mu Mian\u2019s help, she put on a jacket and ran downstairs with him. They boarded the car and headed straight for the East Mountain District.\n On the way, Mu Mian gave Zhu Yuanwen a call to inform him to send a car over to the East Mountain District Hospital to pick Mu Qiu up. Meanwhile, he and Du Tingting headed straight for Newbridge Hospital.\n It was already 11pm by the time they arrived at Newbridge Hospital.\n Mu Qiu was still undergoing her check-up and the two of them could only wait at the door. At 12.30am, Mu Qiu was sent back to the ward. Zhu Yuanwen came over with a bunch of Mu Qiu\u2019s medical reports.\n Zhu Yuanwen had already taken a look at Mu Qiu\u2019s medical report. His face was grave and his brows were tightly furrowed. He felt that things were getting tricky.\n \u201cHead of Department Zhu, how is it?\u201d Mu Mian didn\u2019t understand the medical report, but he could tell from Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s expression that things were getting serious.\n Zhu Yuanwen put down the medical report, looked at Mu Qiu lying on the bed, and said very softly, \u201cMiss Mu\u2019s heart failure has been speeding up recently. Look at this medical report, her BNP has increased by too much.\u201d\n \u201cMiss Mu is just 20 years old. Her BNP index should be less than 450pg / mL. But her BNP is 856pg / mL. Moreover, her lungs are slightly infected and her electrolytes are in disarray. Look at her lower limbs.\u201d\n Zhu Yuanwen pressed down on Mu Qiu\u2019s calf, creating a small hole. It took a long while before it disappeared. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to swell.\u201d\n Du Tingting imitated Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s actions and pressed down on Mu Qiu\u2019s calf. Indeed, a deep hole was formed. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Du Tingting\u2019s voice was filled with fear and her face was pale.\n Zhu Yuanwen stared at Mu Mian. \u201cThe surgery is imminent and cannot be delayed.\u201d\n Du Tingting grabbed Mu Mian\u2019s arm and said tearfully, \u201cHubby, didn\u2019t you say that the heart of a critically ill patient is suitable for Mu Qiu?\u201d\n Mu Mian nodded.\n Zhu Yuanwen glanced at Mu Mian but remained silent.\n Du Tingting felt as if she had just been reassured. She calmed down slightly.\n Turning around, Du Tingting grabbed Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s hand and begged him. \u201cHead of Department Zhu, can we wait another two days?\u201d\n Seeing that Mu Mian was nodding, Zhu Yuanwen said, \u201cAccording to Miss Mu\u2019s rate of deterioration, two to three days should be enough.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d\n Du Tingting looked at her daughter\u2019s pale face. For the first time, she was selfishly hoping that another innocent person would die soon. She also knew that it was not good to have such evil intentions, but as a mother, she couldn\u2019t help but have selfish motives.\n That night, no matter how much Mu Mian tried to persuade her, Du Tingting refused to leave the hospital and insisted on staying behind to accompany Mu Qiu. She was afraid that Mu Qiu would not be able to hold on. Every second that she could cherish now counted.\n The next morning, Mu Qiu woke up first.\n She was momentarily stunned to find herself in the hospital. Pain flashed across her eyes. She remembered the incident last night and thought that she would die on the spot.\n She didn\u2019t know if it was because she was hospitalized or because her heart was failing every second, but Mu Qiu felt a tightness in her chest. She stood up and looked out the window at the fallen leaves scattered all over the ground. She couldn\u2019t help thinking: Can I still see the tender green shoots next spring?\n \u201cQiu-er?\u201d Du Tingting also woke up. Seeing Mu Qiu standing by the window in a daze, she got up and walked over.\n Du Tingting glanced sideways at Mu Qiu and saw that she had regained some color. She said, \u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ll go get you some food.\u201d\n \u201cMother, can I hug you?\u201d\n Mu Qiu looked very helpless.\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart melted. She opened her arms. \u201cCome.\u201d\n Mu Qiu threw herself into Du Tingting\u2019s arms and hugged her very tightly. \u201cLast night, I almost thought I would die on the streets. I couldn\u2019t even see my parents one last time. I am very satisfied to see you again, Mother.\u201d\n \u201cMother.\u201d\n Du Tingting said, \u201cMmm?\u201d\n The fallen leaves of the garden downstairs reflected in Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes. It was bleak and lifeless. \u201cMother, do you still remember that cherry blossom forest we went to see in Tibet a few years ago?\u201d\n \u201cHow could I not remember? When you were in high school, your father specially put down his work and brought our family to Tibet to play.\u201d\n \u201cI remember that the peach forest was especially beautiful. You and Song Song even took a few photos inside.\u201d\n Recalling those happy memories, Du Tingting\u2019s eyes twinkled. That was such a blissful time. Mu Qiu was healthy and Songsong was like a family to them.\n How did everything change so quickly?\n \u201cI remember that place is very beautiful.\u201d Mu Qiu closed her eyes as tears streamed down her face, dripping onto Du Tingting\u2019s sweater. \u201cMother, I still want to visit the peach forest next year.\u201d\n I don\u2019t want to die!\n Du Tingting understood Mu Qiu\u2019s hint. She felt as if someone was grabbing her chest and suffocating her. \u201cQiu-er...\u201d Du Tingting was on the verge of breaking down. She had had enough of this torture.\n Du Tingting couldn\u2019t help but tell Mu Qiu, \u201cQiu-er, your father said that he has already found a suitable heart for you, but the other party is still ill and has not passed away. You still need to wait a few more days. After that person passes away, we will immediately perform a heart transplant for you.\u201d\n Hearing this, Mu Qiu\u2019s dead eyes were ablaze.\n Mu Qiu released Du Tingting and grabbed her arm. She asked in disbelief and joy. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n Du Tingting nodded tearfully. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Qiu-er. You\u2019re saved! Just wait a few more days. We will definitely save you!\u201d\n Mu Qiu was overjoyed. \u201cGreat, great!\u201d\n The mother-daughter duo hugged each other, crying and laughing at the same time.\n Knock knock.\n A sudden knock on the door jolted the mother-daughter duo out of their daze.\n The two of them separated and turned to look at the door of the ward.\n Song Ci stood there holding a breakfast box. She had flat shoes and skinny jeans that accentuated her sexy figure.\n It had only been a few days since they last met, and she had lost a lot of weight. Her body was slightly thin under her sweater, and that pretty face with light makeup also lost its dazzling smile.\n Song Ci, who had toned down, looked somewhat unfamiliar.\n Song Ci walked in and placed the food container on the dresser. She turned and stared at Mu Qiu and Du Tingting. \u201cMother, Qiu-er, why are you crying again?\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes flickered but she didn\u2019t respond.\n The joy on Du Tingting\u2019s face had yet to fade when she heard Song Ci\u2019s question. She grabbed Song Ci\u2019s slender, jade-like hand and shared her joy. \u201cSong Song, we finally found a suitable heart for Qiuqiu!\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n \u201cYou... you found it?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s breathing was labored. She was about to faint from anger.\n How can that be?\n How did Mu Qiu find a suitable heart?\n Song Ci felt like she was being played by the heavens.\n Why was it that even though those who committed all sorts of heinous crimes had been redeemed, those who were truly good didn\u2019t have a good ending? Thinking of her pitiful elder sister who had died and then looking at Mu Qiu, Song Ci felt extremely resentful.\n Du Tingting interpreted Song Ci\u2019s expression as shock and astonishment.\n \u201cAre you very surprised? Maybe she\u2019s lucky. A few days ago, someone with a suitable blood type and antibody for Qiu-er had an accident and is still in critical condition. Your father has already convinced the patient and his family to buy his heart.\u201d\n \u201cI know it\u2019s not legal to buy hearts, but they come from poor families and are willing to sell their hearts in exchange for money for their children.\u201d\n \u201cThis is the best of both worlds.\u201d\n Mu Mian was the one who told Du Tingting this. Du Tingting was just narrating the entire story to Song Ci.\n Song Ci forced a smile. \u201cIs that so?\u201d She turned to look at Mu Qiu, grabbed her hands, and congratulated her against her conscience. \u201cCongratulations, Qiu-er. You\u2019ve finally found a suitable heart.\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook Song Ci\u2019s hand with a faint smile. \u201cElder Sister, will you be by my side during my surgery?\u201d Mu Qiu stuck out her tongue uneasily like a mischievous fairy. \u201cI will feel more at ease with you by my side.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded absent-mindedly.\n Leaving the hospital, Song Ci was feeling very depressed. She went straight to Su Beibei\u2019s cafe. \u201cAh Kun, where\u2019s your manager?\u201d\n Ah Kun knew Song Ci and knew that she was a friend of the manager. \u201cThe boss is upstairs.\u201d\n Nodding, Song Ci hurried upstairs. She pushed open the glass door to the study room, walked up to Su Beibei\u2019s desk, and hit the desk hard with both hands.\n Su Beibei was shocked. She looked up and stared at Song Ci\u2019s enraged face. She raised her brows in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Who angered Beauty Song?\u201d\n Su Beibei had no inspiration. She had only written about 500 words after two hours on her computer and was not satisfied with the content. Seeing that Song Ci had come, Su Beibei shut down her computer.\n Song Ci sat on the sofa with her legs crossed and her arms crossed in front of her chest. Her angry face was somewhat frightening. She was truly enraged but didn\u2019t know where to start.\n Su Beibei went downstairs to get her a cup of coffee. \u201cMocha, try it.\u201d\n The mocha\u2019s surface was covered in black and white flowers. Song Ci stared at those exquisite flowers and finally spoke. \u201cThere is no such thing as fairness in this world.\u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cYou\u2019re here to teach me philosophy?\u201d\n Song Ci stirred the flower with a spoon. \u201cMu Mian has already found a suitable heart for Mu Qiu.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Su Beibei\u2019s smile faded. \u201cIndeed, there is no such thing as fairness.\u201d Her parents had died because of Mu Mian, and retribution had finally come to Mu Mian\u2019s child. She thought that it was finally his turn to suffer the consequences of his own actions, but instead he found a suitable heart for Mu Qiu.\n It is indeed unfair.\n \u201cYou still haven\u2019t found it?\u201d Song Ci had come today mainly to ask about Su Beibei\u2019s progress. Song Ci couldn\u2019t wait. She couldn\u2019t wait to send that old fogey Mu Mian to prison!\n He destroyed the old and destroyed the young.\n \u201cNot yet. Let me show you something.\u201d Su Beibei got up, walked to the bookshelf, and retrieved a Sherlock Holmes collection.\n She sat opposite Song Ci with her book.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You want to tell me a story?\u201d Song Ci stared at the book in her hand and wanted to get up and leave.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry?\u201d Su Beibei opened the book. Only then did Song Ci realize that it was empty. It was actually a fake collection box. Su Beibei took out the contents and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid of being discovered. That\u2019s the only way.\u201d\n \u201cAs expected of someone who writes mystery novels.\u201d This brain was indeed incomparable to a beautiful girl like her.\n Su Beibei threw a bunch of photos of small sizes in front of Song Ci. Song Ci picked them up and saw that the main characters were all Mu Mian.\n The photo recorded all of Mu Mian\u2019s movements over the past two months.\n Su Beibei told Song Ci, \u201cI paid a private detective to monitor Mu Mian 24 / 7. In the past two months, I\u2019ve checked all the places that Mu Mian has been to, but there were no problems.\u201d\n Thinking that Song Ci had lived with Mu Mian for a few years, perhaps Song Ci understood the deeper meaning behind Mu Mian\u2019s actions. Su Beibei wanted her to look at the photos and analyze them.\n After spending some time looking through all the photos, Song Ci put on an uninterested expression. \u201cAll normal. Nothing suspicious at all.\u201d\n Unwilling to give up, Song Ci flipped through the photos again. She suddenly said, \u201cMu Mian went to visit his father alone this year?\u201d\n Su Beibei nodded. \u201cMmm, his wife was pregnant then and didn\u2019t accompany him. I found out that Mu Mian and his father weren\u2019t on good terms. How much do you know about their relationship?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cNot just bad...\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s grandfather was most likely murdered by Mu Mian.\n n her previous life, Su Beibei had used the evidence to report Mu Mian. There were some suspicious points about his father\u2019s death. But due to the lack of evidence, she had not been able to charge Mu Mian with the crime of murdering his father.\n Of course, Song Ci couldn\u2019t just tell Su Beibei about this. It would make her suspicious.\n Song Ci briefly explained the relationship between Mu Mian and his father. \u201cMu Mian\u2019s father has violent tendencies. He was suppressed in the company and will vent his anger on his wife the moment he gets home.\u201d\n \u201cMu Mian has been living in the shadow of his father\u2019s violence since a young age. As a result, he detests his father very much and is most afraid of becoming someone like his father. As a result, after we got married, Mu Mian took very good care of my mother and seldom became angry in front of her.\u201d\n Su Beibei pouted. \u201cThe more you\u2019re afraid of something, the more you care.\u201d\n \u201cYes. Mu Mian wanted to get rid of his father\u2019s influence, so after his death, he rarely went to pay respects.\u201d Song Ci continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been living in the Mu Family for 7-8 years, and Mu Mian doesn\u2019t go to pay respects to his father every year. He will only go if Du Tingting insists.\u201d\n Song Ci took out a few photos of Mu Mian going to the hall and placed them in front of herself. She stared at those photos for a while and felt that something was off.\n Su Beibei said, \u201cSince he hates his father so much, why did he bring his father\u2019s ashes back to Wangdong after his father died?\u201d He should have just let it go.\n Song Ci was stunned.\n She had never considered this question.\n Su Beibei continued her analysis. \u201cFirstly, Mu Mian doesn\u2019t respect his own father, so there\u2019s no need for him to bring his ashes back to Wangdong City to pay his respects. Secondly, if he really wanted to bring them back, he should have brought his biological mother\u2019s ashes.\u201d\n Why did Mu Mian leave his beloved mother alone in his hometown but leave his detested father\u2019s ashes in his own city?\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t think of a reason. \u201cBeibei, you\u2019ve written so many detective novels. You\u2019re definitely smarter than me. You\u2019ll definitely be able to find the answer to this.\u201d\n Su Beibei sneered. She shot Song Ci a disdainful look at her good figure under her sweater and said, \u201cBig boobs but no brains.\u201d\n Song Ci was not angry at all. Instead, she sipped her coffee leisurely. \u201cMmm, your chest is small and your IQ is high. It\u2019s already decided by your intelligence, so I\u2019ll leave this brain-consuming task to you.\u201d Song Ci was right to admit that people with big breasts were brainless.\n Su Beibei chased her away angrily. \u201cGo go go go!\u201d\n Su Beibei chased Song Ci away angrily.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t go out today and just worked at the company. Song Ci planned to have lunch with him at noon. Ever since Song Fei passed away, Song Ci couldn\u2019t focus on anything. Liang Bo had written a new song, but Song Ci had never had the energy to compose for him.\n Knowing that Song Ci was very busy recently, Liang Bo didn\u2019t rush her.\n Last time at the wedding, Liang Bo saw Han Zhan\u2019s godmothers at the wedding venue. Smart as he was, he thought of something. It was very possible that Mr. Han was the real boss of Zeus Airlines and Yu Hua, and his partner, Song Ci, was the lady boss!\n The lady boss was not in the mood for work. As an employee, Liang Bo didn\u2019t dare to rush her. He couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t bear to.\n Song Ci called Liang Bo and told him that she wasn\u2019t suitable for work recently and asked him to hire another expert to compose a piece.\n Liang Bo smiled. \u201cNo hurry, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d\n Song Ci was both heartened and depressed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been in a bad mood recently and am not in the best condition.\u201d\n Knowing that Song Ci had just lost her elder sister, Liang Bo didn\u2019t blame her at all. \u201cYou need to pull yourself together. You need to move forward.\u201d\n Song Ci saw Han Zhan standing at the entrance of the company. \u201cMmm, let\u2019s stop talking first. I have something on.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, bye.\u201d\n fter alighting from the car, Song Ci walked up to Han Zhan, grabbed his arm, and looked up at him. \u201cBrother Han, why did you come down?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI have to work overtime tonight and will probably end very late. I won\u2019t be going home tonight. I\u2019ll go out for lunch with you.\u201d\n \u201cNot going home?\u201d Song Ci knew that Han Zhan was busy but didn\u2019t know that he was so busy. \u201cDo you want me to accompany you at the office?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t. Go home and get some rest. I won\u2019t be able to take care of you when I am busy. You will also be bored alone.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n n the afternoon, the two of them had a Thai meal outside. After lunch, Han Zhan got Ah Song to send Song Ci home. After sending Song Ci off, Han Zhan didn\u2019t go home but went to the basement.\n tanding beside his Volvo car was a short, middle-aged man in a leather jacket. His skin was rather dark, but his black eyes were very bright and gave off a very dangerous vibe.\n Seeing that Han Zhan had come over, Long Yu hurriedly put out the cigarette, took out a piece of chewing gum, and popped it into his mouth to freshen up. \u201cMr. Han.\u201d\n Long Yu opened the car door for Han Zhan and closed it after he got in.\n He sat in the driver\u2019s seat and said to Han Zhan, \u201cEverything is ready.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n \u2013\n Zhu Yuanwen sat in his own office, silently observing Mu Mian.\n Mu Mian pushed an envelope in front of Zhu Yuanwen. \u201cHead of Department Zhu, this is a bank card with 30 million yuan inside.\u201d\n Zhu Yuanwen stared at the envelope, his eyes glued to it. Mu Mian was very satisfied with Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s reaction. He wasn\u2019t afraid of people who were greedy, but he was afraid of people that weren\u2019t greedy.\n \u201cHead of Department Zhu, I\u2019ll have to trouble you with the rest of the matters!\u201d\n Zhu Yuanwen took the card and stuffed it into his wallet. He smiled and said to Mu Mian, \u201cDirector Mu, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely do what you asked me to do after I receive the money.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Zhu Yuanwen looked at the time and said, \u201cIt\u2019s 8pm now. The surgery is about to start.\u201d Zhu Yuanwen got up and was about to leave when he suddenly invited Mu Mian.\u201d Director Mu, since there\u2019s nothing else, why don\u2019t you come with me?\u201d\n After a slight hesitation, Mu Mian stood up. \u201cAlright.\u201d Only by watching with his own eyes could he ensure that nothing went wrong during the surgery.\n Late at night, on the 12th floor of Newbridge Hospital, a private surgery room was brightly lit.\n There were five people standing in the operating theater. They were the members of Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s trusted surgical team. From left to right, they were his first and second assistants, the anesthesiologist, and a nurse who worked odd jobs.\n With the help of a nurse, Zhu Yuanwen put on a surgical gown, gloves, and a surgical cap. Mu Mian followed Zhu Yuanwen into the operating theater.\n On the operating table, Song Fei had been changed into a new surgical gown and covered in a surgical gown. She had been injected with anesthetic and lost consciousness. She laid unmoving on the bed, like a fish waiting to be slaughtered.\n The vehicle beside the operating table was filled with all sorts of surgical instruments, including scalpels, rib shears, proliferators, and clamps...\n Under the light, the equipment glowed silver.\n The butcher in white coat approached the operating table, but Song Fei was completely oblivious.\n Zhu Yuanwen was the chief surgeon. With his status, he rarely did surgeries. Most of the time, he just needed to stand aside and preside over the progress of the surgery as well as to liven up the atmosphere.\n Instead, his first assistant was the busiest.\n The first assistant took the initiative to stand beside him. He heard Zhu Yuanwen say, \u201cGet ready to remove the superior and inferior vena cava, the pulmonary artery and the aorta from the sternum.\u201d\n The assistant was also an attending doctor. He received the scalpel from the scrub nurse.\n Cardiovascular surgery was very complicated. Even if it was just a simple cut of the sternum, there were still many steps. The surgeon would first cut open the skin, then cut open the subcutaneous tissue, and then cut the gap between the sternum and the sternum in a blunt manner. After that, the surgeon would have to perform an up-and-down surgery before finally cutting the sternum open with an electric knife.\n Nothing could go wrong during this process.\n This was the first time this doctor had done such an immoral thing. His hands shook as he held the knife, but an outstanding surgeon could not shake his hands. After calming down, the assistant nodded at Zhu Yuanwen.\n Zhu Yuanwen said, \u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d\n The first assistant aimed the knife at a spot 3cm above Song Fei\u2019s sternum. With just a little strength, the knife sliced open a small wound on her delicate skin.\n He was about to cut Song Fei\u2019s skin when he suddenly heard Zhu Yuanwen say, \u201cDirector Mu, are we really going to do this?\u201d\n Everyone lifted their heads and looked at Mu Mian. Even the first assistant stopped what he was doing and looked at Mu Mian silently.\n Mu Mian\u2019s temples throbbed a few times under the watchful eyes of so many people, but he quickly forced himself to calm down. Nodding vigorously, he instructed in a low voice. \u201cContinue.\u201d\n Zhu Yuanwen suddenly became very talkative. He said, \u201cDirector Mu, you should consider this carefully. She is alive. If you cut her open and take out her heart, she will die!\u201d\n Mu Mian frowned and shot Zhu Yuanwen an unhappy look. \u201cStop blabbering. Just do what you need to do after collecting money!\u201d\n hu Yuanwen sighed and said to his first assistant, \u201cLet\u2019s continue.\u201d\n The assistant nodded and had no choice but to continue cutting the skin.\n \u2013\n At this moment, in a hotel opposite Newbridge Hospital, Han Zhan heard a conversation through his earpiece. He suddenly raised his head and looked at Long Yu.\n Sensing Han Zhan\u2019s gaze, Long Yu looked up and asked, \u201cMr. Han, do you still want to wait?\u201d\n Han Zhan knocked his fingers on his thigh. \u201cWe can close the net now.\u201d\n Hearing this, Long Yu immediately took out his cell phone and dialed a number. \u201cCaptain Lin, the culprit is in Operating Theater 3 on the 12th floor. It\u2019s true. If you don\u2019t go now, someone will die.\u201d\n Captain Lin had received a call about 10 minutes ago. The person who called said that he had discovered a problem at Newbridge Hospital and suspected that someone had committed murder illegally! It was better to believe it than not for fear of the innocent being murdered.\n When Captain Lin received the call, he happened to be at the staircase landing between the 11th and 10th floors. Hearing Long Yu\u2019s words, he hesitated for a moment before leading his subordinates to rush into the corridor and directly kicked open the door to Operating Theater 3!\n With a loud thud, the door was pushed open from the outside!\n Mu Mian froze on the spot. He turned in shock and confusion to see a group of police officers in uniform.\n \u201cNobody move! Police!\u201d\n Upon hearing this, the first assistant\u2019s hands trembled and his legs went limp. He fell to the ground.\n Before Mu Mian could react, he was handcuffed. The cold, bone-chilling handcuffs pulled Mu Mian back to reality. He stared at the silver handcuffs as his mind raced. He quickly understood the problem.\n There\u2019s a traitor!\n Mu Mian turned to observe everyone\u2019s reaction.\n Everyone looked like mice seeing a cat when they saw the police. They all looked very scared. The two young nurses started crying. They apologized as they cried. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t our idea. Director Mu forced us!\u201d\n The first assistant sat down on the floor, holding a knife stained with blood. He muttered incoherently. \u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over...\u201d\n he second assistant\u2019s face was also pale. He sat by the corner of the operating table, not saying a word, his face deathly pale. The anesthetist, who was sitting at the side and playing with his cell phone in the most relaxed manner originally, actually threw his cell phone aside and crawled under the operating table. He hugged his head and kept apologizing while shouting, \u201cI was wrong!\u201d\n Only the leading doctor in the entire surgery, Zhu Yuanwen, reacted the most calmly.\n He was still standing beside the operating table, like a person watching a play as he quietly watched this comical scene. Realizing that Mu Mian was looking over, Zhu Yuanwen looked up and met his eyes.\n The moment he met Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s cold, steady eyes, Mu Mian understood everything. His expression darkened as a vicious glint flashed across his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Mu Mian gritted his teeth, wishing he could tear Zhu Yuanwen apart.\n Zhu Yuanwen smiled bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n \u201cF*ck your mother!\u201d Mu Mian struggled with all his might, wanting to rush over and beat up Zhu Yuanwen.\n Seeing that Mu Mian was resisting, Captain Lin smashed the baton into his abdomen. \u201cBehave! Do you still want to resist?!\u201d Captain Lin grabbed Mu Mian and roared. \u201cBehave yourselves! Take all of them away!\u201d\n With that, he personally dragged Mu Mian out who was behaving like a rabid dog.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "185": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-186\n\n Chapter 185: Beast!  Captain Lin led Mu Mian to the corridor and shoved him into the hands of one of his subordinates. \u201cBring them all to the car. There\u2019s a victim inside. I\u2019ll go take a look at her.\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d\n It was very hard not to cause a stir, when a group of police officers carrying six criminals walked out of the lift and appeared in the lobby on the first level of the hospital,\n Someone shouted, \u201cOh no, the police are here to catch a murderer!\u201d This shout could be heard throughout the entire building.\n All the patients\u2019 family members and nurses on duty ran to the window sill of the northern ward. They laid down on their tiptoes and looked down.\n Indeed, they saw a group of police officers as well as criminals who were being handcuffed and trying to cover their faces.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that Head of Department Zhu?\u201d They were both from the same hospital, and Zhu Yuanwen was a big shot in the Cardiovascular Department, so the medical staff immediately recognized him.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that Doctor Shen?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Liu!\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s Doctor Zhang from the Department of Anesthesiology!\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s a nurse from the operating theater of the Cardiovascular Department. I think her name is Zhang Jing...\u201d\n Recognizing the identities of these people, everyone had an exclamation mark in their hearts!\n What is going on?\n What crime did Head of Department Zhu and the rest commit?\n \u201cLook, there\u2019s another one behind them!\u201d The person being detained at the back of the group was a man of medium height wearing a black suit.\n As his back was facing the crowd, no one could see his face clearly, but his back view looked somewhat familiar.\n A resident doctor secretly said to his colleague beside him, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that the person at the back looks a little like our hospital\u2019s Director Mu?\u201d\n At first, she didn\u2019t think so. But after hearing his words, that colleague also felt that they rather similar. \u201cActually, he is quite similar.\u201d Everyone knew that the chairman\u2019s daughter had a heart attack and was admitted to Newbridge Hospital. Director Mu had indeed been in the hospital these few days.\n It would make sense if it were him.\n \u201cBut what crime did Director Mu and the rest commit? The police came with such fanfare. They must have concrete evidence to prove their crimes. That\u2019s why they dare to be so arrogant!\u201d Everyone looked at each other in fear and unknown excitement.\n \u201cWhat are you all looking at? Go back to your posts. This is a hospital, not a theater!\u201d The head nurse was a step too slow. She was no longer in a position to watch the drama.\n Since she couldn\u2019t see, everyone should stop looking.\n Seeing that the head nurse had lost her temper, the young nurses from the Cardiovascular Department quickly dispersed from the window and returned to their respective posts.\n At this moment, the sound of wheels grinding against the ground attracted the attention of the head nurse. She stopped in her tracks and looked up at the entrance to the corridor outside the Cardiovascular Department.\n The head nurse hurried over when she saw that it was a police officer. She looked at the unconscious girl lying on the bed in front of the police officer, looked up, and asked Captain Lin in confusion, \u201cOfficer, what happened? This patient is not from our department.\u201d\n Although the girl on the bed was not a patient from the Cardiovascular Department, she was wearing the sterile surgical gown of Newbridge Hospital. \u201cIs she a patient transferred from another department?\u201d\n Captain Lin shook his head. \u201cShe has been injected with a full-body anesthetic and has yet to regain consciousness. Please arrange a window for her and take good care of her. This person is extremely important and cannot be harmed at all.\u201d\n Of course, the head nurse wouldn\u2019t accept such a dubious patient. She asked Captain Lin boldly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the condition of this patient?\u201d\n She is a healthy and innocent victim who nearly had her heart removed by your hospital\u2019s Head of Department Zhu...\u201d Captain Lin\u2019s authoritative gaze swept across the head nurse\u2019s face.\u201d She is a victim. Do you understand the importance of this person? \u201d\n The head nurse was shocked!\n Head of Department Zhu and the rest actually planned to dissect the heart of a healthy girl!\n Is this even something a human would do?\n No wonder they were caught!\n They deserve it!\n The head nurse nodded solemnly and promised. \u201cMr. Policeman, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely take good care of the patient. Nothing will happen to the patient!\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n ]\u201dBed 45 is empty. I will send her to bed 45.\u201d\n \u2013\n Han Zhan and Long Yu stood side by side behind the window of the small hotel room. From here, they could see everything that happened at the main entrance of Newbridge Hospital.\n Long Yu snorted when he saw Mu Mian and the rest being dragged into the police car. He scolded. \u201cYou heartless beasts should be jailed until you die!\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThat\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n Long Yu looked at Han Zhan suspiciously and asked humbly, \u201cWhat should we do next?\u201d\n \u201cControl public opinion.\u201d Staring at Long Yu\u2019s tanned face, Han Zhan felt that he was quite pitiful. \u201cGo and rest well. I will handle the rest.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Public opinion was like a knife that could cut people to death.\n That night, a video was posted on Weibo and attracted a lot of attention. The video was posted by a female researcher from Fu Hanshen\u2019s research team called Qin Yue.\n Qin Yue missed her ex-colleague, Song Fei. When she had nothing better to do, she scrolled through her cell phone and saw a video of a team dinner.\n Qin Yue cut the video and posted it on her social media account.\n In the video, Fu Hanshen and his team were having a hotpot dinner at Golden Sand\u2019s rental house.\n The person taking the photo was Yan Jiang. Gripping his cell phone, he took the photo in silence. Due to his love for Song Fei, Song Fei appeared frequently on camera.\n In the video, Qin Yue asked Fu Hanshen, \u201cTeacher Fu, you and your lover have been separated for a long time. What if you miss each other?\u201d\n Virus specialists were also humans and had emotions.\n Fu Hanshen stuffed a piece of potato into his mouth and ate until his cheeks were bulging. After he swallowed the potato, Fu Hanshen said, \u201cMy right hand doesn\u2019t only know how to make test tubes. It also knows how to do something else.\u201d\n They were all adults and it was not at all offensive to make such a harmless joke. Hearing this, everyone burst into laughter and praised Teacher Fu for his talent.\n A male researcher noticed Song Fei eating quietly in the corner. He picked up his chopsticks and pointed them at Song Ci. \u201cLet\u2019s interview our research institute\u2019s youngest genius Song.\u201d\n Song Fei put down her chopsticks and looked up.\n Under her short black hair, the girl\u2019s face was beautiful and exquisite. Her eyes were as cold as snow and her lips were as pink as cherry blossoms. She looked at her male colleague quietly and said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n The male colleague coughed. \u201cLittle genius, I want to ask you, how does it feel to be a genius?\u201d\n Unexpectedly, Song Fei said, \u201cGeniuses are all lonely.\u201d\n Everyone quietened down.\n Fu Hanshen turned to Song Fei. \u201cYou also know how to be lonely?\u201d\n ong Fei nodded. \u201cOf course. When I was young, I loved to research all sorts of strange things. My neighbors in my neighborhood all called me a little monster behind my back. I didn\u2019t have any friends in the past.\u201d She picked up her drink and took a sip. \u201cBut now, I\u2019m very lucky to have met a group of like-minded colleagues.\u201d\n Fu Hanshen smiled, very satisfied with her answer.\n Qin Yue raised her hand and waited for Song Fei to notice her before saying, \u201cSong Fei, Teacher Fu said that you are also very talented in chemistry. Many big shots in the chemistry industry want to take you in as their disciple. Why did you reject them and choose virology?\u201d\n Song Fei put down her drink. \u201cMy father is a doctor, a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner.\u201d At the mention of her father, a rare tinge of tenderness surfaced on her cold face. \u201cMy father said that the most painful thing in this world is to watch someone die in pain, while he is helpless and can only watch.\u201d\n \u201cSave the dying and heal the injured. My father left me with the greatest inheritance.\u201d Song Fei seldom said such corny words, even her ears couldn\u2019t help turning red.\n The video ended there.\n At the end of the video was a caption personally typed by Qin Yue:\n [Save the dying and heal the injured. This is your greatest inheritance from your father. It is also the greatest inheritance you have left for us. Little sister Song Fei, there is no war in heaven. I hope you can rest in peace.]\n As the main character of the video was Song Fei, a young genius virology expert who had just passed away, the video was quickly noticed and reposted to fame.\n After dinner, the netizens had nothing to do and habitually opened Weibo to browse.\n After this video was uploaded, everyone felt that it was a pity for Song Fei\u2019s death. But there were also some people who focused their attention on Song Fei\u2019s heaven-defying looks.\n Kekejun: [What kind of goddess is she! Not only is she highly intelligent, she is also very good-looking! Us commoners can only kneel in admiration.]\n Second-grade youngster: [Oh my god, so beautiful, so young, and a genius with high intelligence! This is too much! Damn the war, causing us to lose such an outstanding virus specialist. May the world be peaceful and there be no war!]\n Broken glass: [Little miss looks familiar, don\u2019t you think so?]\n Yan Jiang Family\u2019s Little Nine: [This lady looks like Song Ci!]\n Yan Jiang\u2019s Big Water: [Yes! The person above said what I wanted to say. I also feel that Ms. Song Fei and Gorgeous Song Ci look very much alike. Not a little, but very much!]\n Zhanye: [Song Ci, Song Fei... both have the surname Song. Are they really family?]\n For some reason, the comments section was getting more and more off topic. Everyone was guessing if Song Ci was related to the deceased virus specialist, Song Fei.\n They looked so alike that it did not make sense if they weren\u2019t related. With the attitude of seeking verification, Song Ci\u2019s fans even specially messaged her to ask about this.\n Han Zhan had to work overtime at night and Song Ci had nothing to do at home. She also scrolled through Weibo on her cell phone. She opened her Weibo and saw that she had yet to read over 10,000 private messages. She decided to pick a few to reply to.\n She opened her private message and saw that many people were asking if she and Song Fei were relatives. Song Ci was slightly surprised. How did the netizens know that Song Fei and I are relatives?\n Song Ci followed the clues and found that video. When she saw Song Fei chatting happily with her colleague in the video, Song Ci\u2019s originally calm heart suddenly stirred as her heart ached.\n At 9.20pm that night, Song Ci, who hadn\u2019t posted anything for half a month, finally posted something.\n Song Ci: [Song Fei and I are biological sisters from the same womb. From a young age, she has shown extraordinary intelligence. I admire and respect her a lot, especially when I can only score over 80 marks after memorizing so much, while she can score full marks in any exam.\n Just like how it was impossible for there to be two identical leaves in this world, there was a world of difference between Song Fei and my character. She liked to be quiet, taciturn, mature and wise. I was noisy, talkative, childish and silly.\n But such a foolish me had been protected by Song Fei my entire life.\n I still remember 14 years ago in Bijiang City, when the earthquake struck, Song Fei gave up the opportunity to escape and pulled the still sleeping me along to run away. At the moment the house collapsed, she threw me into the toilet with greater endurance. Meanwhile, she fell into the rubble with the house and was injured to the point of being comatose for 8 years.\n My life was given to me by Song Fei.\n She always called me a little fool, a silly girl, a little coward, a stupid kid. When she looked at me, there was always disdain in her eyes. But in times of danger, the person who protected me was that Song Fei who loved to bully me.\n To this day, Song Fei\u2019s passing felt like a dream. I can\u2019t accept the fact that she had already passed away.\n But I have to wake up. I have to accept the fact that you have left. After you leave, I will be an orphan in this world. No one will call me a little fool, while protecting me like her own heart.\n Song Fei, there must be no war in heaven.\n You must be safe in heaven.]\n Song Ci was a popular celebrity on Weibo. Coincidentally, the other main character mentioned on this Weibo account was Song Fei, a virology expert who had recently attracted attention on Weibo.\n With the push of the mysterious public relations department, this Weibo post of hers was trending at the fastest speed.\n When Song Ci realized that she was once again trending, she was rather surprised. When did I become so popular?\n Song Ci turned off her cell phone and laid in bed trying to fall asleep. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t fall asleep. She was debating whether to get up and watch a movie when she suddenly heard the sound of the main door downstairs being opened.\n Song Ci was shocked.\n She hurriedly tiptoed out of bed, opened Han Zhan\u2019s safe, and took out a gun.\n This was prepared by Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan was a sensitive person and had met several killers before. He always kept a defensive weapon in unexpected places. Han Zhan specially warned Song Ci that if she really encountered danger at home, she could use it to save her own life.\n Han Aoyu had also said this to Song Ci.\n Song Ci clutched that cold, heavy gun, with her heart in her throat.\n Walking in the dark to the wall beside the door, Song Ci leaned against it and pulled open the safety catch like Han Zhan had taught her. She held the gun with both hands and placed her index finger on the trigger, ready to shoot.\n This was the first time Song Ci had done this. She was so nervous that her breathing became labored. The footsteps of the person were very heavy. Song Ci listened carefully, trying to discern the gender of the person from the footsteps.\n She had yet to figure out whether it was a man or a woman, but she felt that this person\u2019s footsteps and voice were somewhat familiar.\n That person unlocked the door and walked in. He was a 1.9m tall man.\n Seeing that there was no one in the room, Han Zhan narrowed his blue eyes slightly. He instinctively reached for his cell phone, wanting to call Song Ci and ask about her whereabouts.\n Just then, someone suddenly walked out from behind the door. That person raised her gun and before she could get close to Han Zhan, Han Zhan suddenly turned around, grabbed Song Ci\u2019s arm, and pinned her behind.\n Song Ci\u2019s arm went numb and the gun fell to the ground. \u201cOuch, it hurts, Brother Han!\u201d Song Ci\u2019s face was pale from the pain.\n Han Zhan pressed down on Song Ci\u2019s arm, leaned over, and said by her ear, \u201cWhen your Brother Han was playing with a gun, you were still playing with a bubble machine.\u201d\n Song Ci continued wailing. \u201cLet go of me, my arm is going to break!\u201d\n Han Zhan finally showed mercy and released Song Ci.\n Song Ci rubbed her aching arm muscles and gazed at Han Zhan with tears in her eyes. She couldn\u2019t help complaining. \u201cHow can you be so rough? You already guessed it was me, but you didn\u2019t even let me have some fun.\u201d\n \u201cI am already very gentle towards you.\u201d She had never seen him being so fierce. He was once hailed as the ravenous wolf of the southwest. Once he found a target, he would never let go.\n Han Zhan was famous for his ruthlessness in the southwest.\n Han Zhan bent down to pick up the gun on the floor and said to Song Ci, \u201cDon\u2019t touch this thing.\u201d After putting it back into the safe, Han Zhan turned and stared at Song Ci for a while before suddenly saying, \u201cTake off your nightdress.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned and instinctively said, \u201cYou want it?\u201d She was rather surprised. It was rare to see Han Zhan so straightforward.\n Hearing the words \u201cwant it\u201d, it was Han Zhan\u2019s turn to be shocked.\n Coming to his senses, even Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud. \u201cAre you trying to make me die of laughter?\u201d Han Zhan laughed for a while before saying, \u201cI asked you to take off your nightdress and change clothes. We are going out.\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t even clarify things in one sentence and purposely made people\u2019s imaginations run wild...\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t feel that her mind was dirty. If there was anyone to blame, it was Han Zhan who spoke halfway.\n After changing into casual wear, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat are we going out for? For supper?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re going out to meet someone.\u201d Han Zhan purposely acted mysterious and didn\u2019t say who that person was.\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cYou will know later.\u201d\n Han Zhan pulled Song Ci out of the house and into the lift. Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cAren\u2019t you very busy at work? Why are you suddenly back?\u201d\n \u201cBecause that person is very important and I have to bring you to meet that person, so I skipped work.\u201d\n \u201cWho on earth is so mysterious?\u201d Song Ci rolled her eyes and made a humorous joke. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you have an awesome godfather? The kind who is even more capable than Mo Yao.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n That\u2019s boring.\u201d\n Along the way, Song Ci didn\u2019t question who Han Zhan wanted to meet. With Han Zhan by her side, Song Ci felt at ease.\n \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d\n Song Ci was dozing off in the car. Hearing this, she opened her eyes and turned to look out the window. When she saw the words \u201cNewbridge Hospital\u201d hanging on the second level of the hospital building, her gaze froze.\n This was the place where Song Ci passed away in her previous life. She felt a sense of repulsion whenever she got close to this place. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She felt a dull ache in her chest and felt suffocated.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI said that I am here to meet someone important, someone whom you wish to meet the most.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly annoyed by Han Zhan\u2019s antics. \u201cI won\u2019t go up if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201d She hated the feeling of being teased repeatedly.\n Han Zhan turned off the engine and unbuckled his seatbelt. Through the windshield, he gazed at the 6th level diagonally above. \u201cSong Fei is upstairs. Do you still want to go up?\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci was stunned.\n She sat in the middle of the car, stunned. Her eyes were slightly wide open, filled with anger at being fooled by her beloved. \u201cHan Zhan, you can\u2019t lie to me!\u201d Song Ci\u2019s voice was very cold, but her expression was fragile.\n \u201cTonight at 9pm, someone reported that Director Zhu of Newbridge Hospital and Director Mu Mian conspired to dissect a living person illegally and steal a heart. The police are very concerned about this matter. They immediately sent someone to the scene to investigate and confirm that the report is true. Head of Department Zhu and Mu Mian have already been brought to the police station.\u201d\n Han Zhan wiped the hot tears from Song Ci\u2019s face and said, \u201cSong Ci, the person who was nearly murdered by Mu Mian was Song Fei.\u201d\n \u201cImpossible!\u201d Song Ci stared at Han Zhan with teary eyes. She cupped her mouth with both hands and cried. \u201cSong Fei is clearly dead and her ashes are still in the resting hall. I personally received them from Teacher Fu!\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan, you can\u2019t lie to me!\u201d\n He couldn\u2019t give her hope and make her sink into despair.\n \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you.\u201d Han Zhan tried to remove Song Ci\u2019s hands from his face. He held Song Ci\u2019s cold hands tightly and coaxed her like he was coaxing a child. \u201cBaby Ci, Song Fei is really still alive. She is in the ward upstairs. I will bring you to see her.\u201d\n Tears streamed down Song Ci\u2019s face as she nodded vigorously.\n Song Ci sprinted into the hospital building of Newbridge Hospital. As she went upstairs, she complained that the lift was slow and was so anxious that she kept stomping her feet.\n When the lift stopped on the 6th floor and the door opened, Song Ci ran out without a care. Song Ci sprinted along the corridor, looking for a bed. When she saw Bed 45, Song Ci suddenly stopped in her tracks.\n She strode to the door of the ward and placed her hand on the doorknob, but lost the courage to open the door.\n She was afraid of opening this door.\n What if there is no Song Fei inside and I was just happy for nothing?\n \u201cBaby Ci.\u201d Han Zhan placed his hand on the back of Song Ci\u2019s hand. He exerted some strength and opened the door. The door was opened slightly and the light from the ward streamed out. Song Ci slowly looked inside.\n As the door was completely pushed open, the entire ward was revealed to Song Ci.\n There were four beds in the room. A small bed was placed between the beds, and the patients\u2019 family members were dozing off on it. A woman laid alone on the bed by the window. She was wearing a sterile surgical gown.\n The woman had short hair that reached past her ears. Her face was overly thin and her cheekbones were prominent. Her skin was pallid and pale. She was in a coma and her breathing was light and slow. She had an air of innocence about her.\n Tears streamed down Song Ci\u2019s face as she stared at Song Fei.\n She sprinted to the bed by the window and hugged Song Fei\u2019s shoulders tightly. She buried her face in Song Fei\u2019s neck and cried bitterly. \u201cElder Sister...\u201d Song Ci broke down on the spot.\n Song Ci was so agitated that she woke up the two family members who were sound asleep. The family members sat up in a daze, looked at Song Ci who was crying bitterly, and then looked at the tall man behind her. They were slightly stunned.\n Han Zhan lowered his stance and apologized to these family members and patients. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lover was too agitated and disturbed everyone.\u201d\n They were all people who had been tormented by the pain of their illness to the point of being breathless, so they could understand Song Ci\u2019s loss of composure. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s human nature.\u201d\n A slightly plump male family member asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat\u2019s the relationship between the two of you and that little girl?\u201d They hadn\u2019t seen Song Fei\u2019s family accompanying her and thought she was an orphan.\n Having been in a vegetative state for eight years, Song Fei was skinny and thin. Her chest was not much bigger than her behind. As she laid there quietly, she looked like an underage high school girl. It was no wonder they called her a little girl.\n Song Ci had been crying with her head buried. No one could see her face clearly. If they could, they would be able to guess her relationship with the patient.\n \u201cThat is my lover\u2019s biological sister.\u201d Han Zhan leaned against the railing of Song Fei\u2019s bed. He told these family members, \u201cAlthough my sister-in-law is young and only 22 years old, she is a virologist!\u201d\n \u201cSome time ago, my sister-in-law went to Africa with our country\u2019s top virus specialist, Fu Hanshen, to research that Ebola virus. Unexpectedly, there was a war there and my eldest aunt unfortunately passed away.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned back to look at the comatose Song Fei on the bed. He shook his head and said with a complicated expression, \u201cMr. Fu brought her ashes back to the country and my wife personally placed them in the resting hall. We all thought that my sister-in-law was already dead, but who knew that she was actually alive!\u201d\n \u201cMy lover is crying so badly because she is too happy and surprised.\u201d Han Zhan looked like an upright and kind-hearted young man. Whatever he said was very convincing and unquestionable.\n A younger male patient suddenly said, \u201cOh my god, big brother, is your sister-in-law called Song Fei? The virus specialist Song Fei!\u201d\n This man was only in his early twenties and was also an internet bug. The death of the virus specialist Song Fei had attracted quite a bit of attention.\n He happened to see it.\n Before Han Zhan could reply, the man\u2019s mother turned and glanced at the hospitalization status. Upon seeing that name, she told her son, \u201cIt\u2019s Song Fei.\u201d\n The man exclaimed again. \u201cThere\u2019s actually such a thing!\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head and sighed. He said, \u201cSigh, we don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. Say, the person who was initially declared dead has already been cremated but is still alive. Isn\u2019t this strange?\u201d\n \u201cOf course we are also very happy and excited that our elder sister is alive. But for a person who was supposed to be researching viruses in Africa to suddenly die and then appear in our country, isn\u2019t this very strange? We are the closest people to her. We have the right to know the truth.\u201d\n Hearing this, the man suddenly glanced at the door. \u201cMother, go close the door.\u201d His mother obediently closed the door.\n The man told Han Zhan in a low voice, \u201cI was smoking in the stairwell just now and heard the doctors on duty say that the head of the Cardiovascular Department of our hospital accepted a bribe from the hospital\u2019s director and nearly dissected a living person\u2019s heart.\u201d\n \u201cLuckily someone detected their scheme and called the police in time to successfully stop this murder.\u201d\n \u201cPreviously, it was the police who personally escorted your sister-in-law to the ward. They all said that Miss Song is that unlucky person.\u201d This incident had already spread throughout the entire building in just an hour. Who in this building didn\u2019t know about the dirty affair between Head of Department Zhu and Director Mu?\n As a result, when the young man spoke about this matter, he spoke with a straight face, as if he knew everything and had personally witnessed it.\n \u201cThere\u2019s actually such a thing!\u201d Han Zhan was very angry. He punched the bed frame, gritted his teeth, and asked, \u201cWhy did they do this! Taking the risk of going to jail to dig out my sister-in-law\u2019s heart\u2014what exactly was the reason?\u201d\n A hesitant look appeared on the man\u2019s face. He said in a small voice, \u201cI heard that Director Mu\u2019s daughter suffered from a heart disease. Her blood type is special and she can\u2019t find a suitable heart. Your sister-in-law happened to be compatible with Director Mu\u2019s daughter\u2019s heart and nearly died under Head of Department Zhu\u2019s knife.\u201d\n Han Zhan purposely let people tell him these secrets. He was satisfied that any patient would know these.\n Han Zhan was very good at acting. After hearing the man\u2019s words, he was shocked. \u201cHow could...\u201d Han Zhan looked worriedly at Song Ci.\n Seeing that Song Ci had stopped crying and was listening intently to their conversation, a smile flashed across his eyes.\n Song Ci was no fool. After hearing so much from Han Zhan just now, Song Ci already knew what Han Zhan was up to. Upon seeing Han Zhan look over, Song Ci shook her head and her lips quivered. She looked very fragile.\n She murmured in disbelief. \u201cImpossible! This isn\u2019t real!\u201d\n Seeing that Song Ci didn\u2019t believe him, the young man said, \u201cWhy not? That Director Mu\u2019s daughter was sent to the hospital after a heart attack yesterday night and is still staying in the VIP ward upstairs!\u201d\n After hearing that man\u2019s words, Song Ci\u2019s body swayed, her eyes rolled back, and she was actually about to faint. Han Zhan was shocked and hurriedly supported Song Ci. \u201cBaby Ci\u201d\n Song Ci leaned into Han Zhan\u2019s arms and grabbed his collar as she cried. \u201cHan Zhan, how could Father treat me like this! Even if I am just an adopted daughter, I am still the child he raised for eight years! How can he be so heartless to kill my biological sister just to save his own daughter?\u201d\n \u201cYes, I admit that the Mu Family has indeed done us a great favor by raising me for eight years and paying for my elder sister\u2019s medical fees. But I have already repaid all the money that the Mu Family has spent on us over the past eight years! I know that we sisters should be grateful for the Mu Family\u2019s care, but we shouldn\u2019t sacrifice our lives for it!\u201d\n \u201cMu Qiu\u2019s life is noble, but my elder sister\u2019s life is cheap?\u201d\n \u201cA person who researched viruses far away in Africa can also be brought back to the country. Just how capable is he?!\u201d\n \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t manage to capture my sister, is he planning to kill me and steal my heart to save her biological daughter?\u201d\n Half of Song Ci\u2019s words were sincere, while the other half was deliberate and tear-jerking.\n Everyone in the ward was dumbstruck by this earth-shattering secret.\n What?\n In order to save his own daughter, that Director Mu actually dared to lay his hands on his adopted daughter\u2019s biological sister? Just like this lady said, if they didn\u2019t capture Song Fei, would he really be so heartless as to lay his hands on his own daughter who had been raised for eight years!\n Is he even human?\n Is he human?\n Even if he had taken care of this pair of sisters for eight years, they had already repaid their debts. Is there a need to sacrifice their lives?\n The life of a rich family\u2019s daughter is valuable, but the life of a virus specialist is not?\n Pui!\n The value of a virologist is much higher than that of a pampered young lady!\n The young man suddenly said, \u201cI heard that this isn\u2019t the only hospital under this Director Mu\u2019s name. That Chao Yang Company and Happy Color Shopping Centre are both his! Let\u2019s see if I don\u2019t expose him and ruin his reputation!\u201d\n Everyone could not stand being fanned. The young man was the first to express his dissatisfaction. The other patients and their families also joined in to condemn Mu Mian and Head of Department Zhu\u2019s sins.\n \u201cPui! Such a beast and an entrepreneur\u2014how embarrassing! That Dr. Zhu isn\u2019t human either. As a doctor, not only did he not save anyone, he even killed someone!\u201d\n \u201cThis young lady is a virus specialist! She is a great person who has truly helped mankind. How dare they disregard the law to harm her! They are totally inhuman!\u201d\n \u201cWe must expose this bunch of disgusting things and have the entire country denounce them! We must seek justice for this young lady!\u201d\n \u201cRight! If we blow this matter up, that Mu guy can forget about using money to settle this!\u201d\n Song Ci cried on and on, until she fainted. Worried about his beloved wife\u2019s health, Han Zhan hurriedly carried Song Ci to the doctor for treatment. He allowed this group of people to be filled with righteous indignation, as they took out their cell phones and started to expose everything.\n That night, a post titled [Chao Yang Company\u2019s chairman, Mu Mian, is inhumane and suspected of murdering the virus specialist Song Fei] appeared on various social media platforms.\n There was no lack of night owls in the middle of the night. Everyone\u2019s hands were trembling with anger when they saw this. They all reposted this piece of news in an attempt to hype it up so that more people could see Mu Mian\u2019s true colors.\n Zhihu netizens: [I\u2019ve always known that people are evil, but didn\u2019t know that they could be so evil! Such a wicked person is really detestable. I believe our country\u2019s laws can teach him what is called \u2018human\u2019!]\n Peasants: [Even a movie doesn\u2019t dare to write in such a way. This Mu Mian is really vicious. He is also an outstanding entrepreneur in Wangdong City! He looks like an upright and kind man, but why is his heart so black? Indeed, one can never judge a book by its cover.]\n Internet pal 1: [This is really the biggest shocking news of the year!]\n Internet pal 2: [How capable does Mu Mian have to be to be able to reach out to Golden Sands? Meanwhile, a group of doctors who were supposed to save the dying and the injured dared to take the heart of a living person just because they were bribed. The knife in their hands is not a surgical knife used to save the dying and the injured, but a butcher\u2019s knife used to kill people and turn them into demons.]\n Internet pal 3: [Your daughter\u2019s life is a life, but the lives of virologists are not? I heard long ago that Song Ci broke off all ties with the Mu Family. Now it seems like Song Ci has already detected Mu Mian\u2019s evil intentions. I am starting to wonder if Mu Mian adopted Song Ci and her sister out of kindness or if he has other motives.]\n Internet4: [The comment above is very scary. Everyone might not know but Song Ci and Song Fei are twins with the same blood type. Since Song Fei\u2019s HLA is suitable for the daughter of the Mu Family, so is Song Ci. Let me ask you, if Mu Mian doesn\u2019t manage to capture his elder sister Song Fei, will he target his adopted daughter Song Ci?]\n Internet pal 5: [Oh my god, after reading our analysis, I am starting to suspect the truth behind Mu Mian adopting Song Ci. Is he trying to be kind or is he already planning something?]\n Internet pal 6: [Would such a ruthless person do good deeds? I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t doing good, but paying for his evil deeds!]\n Internet pal 4: [Mu Mian is so scheming that it makes one\u2019s hair stand on end.]\n ...\n At dawn, # Chao Yang Chairman Mu Mian #, # Newbridge Hospital #, # Newbridge Hospital Head of Department Zhu #, # Virus Specialist Suspected To Be Murdered #, and so on were all the hottest topics on Weibo that day.\n Everyone scolded Mu Mian and Head of Department Zhu so badly that they nearly smashed their faces with eggs.\n Meanwhile, the pressure from the public opinion also put quite a bit of pressure on the police\u2019s investigations.\n \u201cThis incident has already attracted the attention of the entire nation. We have to investigate thoroughly!\u201d Director Chen, who was used to seeing all sorts of criminal techniques and motives, was also impressed by Mu Mian.\n Thinking of the phone call he received earlier, Director Chen\u2019s expression turned even colder. He reminded his subordinates. \u201cThis victim also has a special identity. I just found out that she is not only Mr. Fu\u2019s student, but also Old Mr. Han\u2019s relative.\u201d\n One of his subordinates couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhich Old Mr. Han?\u201d\n Director Chen glanced at the person who spoke and said unhappily, \u201cWhich Old Master Han do you think it is? Who else in Wangdong City can I call Old Mr. Han?\u201d\n Liu Anquan\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cThis...\u201d\n Although that Old Mr. Han had retired and no longer cared about anything, no one dared to belittle him. Even their boss had to be respectful toward Old Mr. Han.\n \u201cWe will definitely investigate this matter thoroughly and give the victim an explanation.\u201d\n \u2013\n Song Ci \u201cfainted\u201d and only woke up the next morning.\n Han Zhan bought warm porridge for her and put it in an insulated food container. After Song Ci woke up, she ate the porridge Han Zhan bought and listened to his report on the progress of the night.\n \u201cThe power of public opinion is enough to drown Mu Mian and his daughter. What we need to do now is to wait.\u201d Waiting for the police and court to sentence Mu Mian.\n Song Ci frowned, clearly uninterested. \u201cHe attempted murder and won\u2019t be sentenced for long. Public opinion is scary, but the law is the foundation.\u201d Song Ci was not resigned to just this step. A few years in prison would only benefit that bastard.\n \u201cIs my elder sister awake?\u201d Song Ci still worried about Song Fei the most.\n \u201cShe\u2019s awake.\u201d\n Song Ci lifted the blanket and was about to get off the bed to look for Song Fei, when Han Zhan held her down. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Yan Jiang is there. You can forget about seeing Song Fei even if you go.\u201d\n \u201cAh Jiang is here too?\u201d That made sense. After the commotion last night, Yan Jiang must have found out that Song Fei was still alive. Given how much Yan Jiang cared about Song Fei, he must have rushed over to the hospital that very night.\n \u201cHow did Yan Jiang react?\u201d He must be overjoyed to have regained what he lost.\n \u201cHis reaction seems rather calm.\u201d Han Zhan felt that Yan Jiang\u2019s reaction was abnormal. \u201cAt this point, the calmer his reaction, the more abnormal it is.\u201d\n \u201cGive him some time.\u201d Song Ci asked again, \u201cWhere is Mu Qiu?\u201d\n \u201cYesterday night, Mu Mian was taken away by the police. When Mu Qiu found out about it, she fainted from a heart attack. But Du Tingting had been watching over her. Realizing that something was off, she hurriedly called the doctor over. Mu Qiu was saved again.\u201d Han Zhan sounded rather regretful. He couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cThat sister of yours is like a cockroach\u2014rather tenacious.\u201d\n Song Ci sneered. \u201cScourge is always like this.\u201d\n \u201cI will go and scare her.\u201d Accompanied by Han Zhan, Song Ci arrived at the level of the VIP ward.\n The two of them walked out of the lift and saw that Mu Qiu\u2019s door was tightly shut. Meanwhile, a man in a navy blue suit was standing in front of her ward, hesitating to enter.\n Song Ci stopped and looked at that person.\n This was the second time Song Ci saw Cheng Yanmo in this lifetime. In Song Ci\u2019s impression, Cheng Yanmo had always been strong and independent.\n He was the true head of the Cheng Family. His words were like an imperial edict. In that big family of the Cheng Family, everyone followed his lead.\n This was the first time Song Ci saw hesitation and uneasiness on Cheng Yanmo\u2019s face.\n Cheng Yanmo hesitated between knocking on the door to enter the room or turning around to leave. In the end, he turned around and was about to leave, when he saw Song Ci and Han Zhan walking out of the lift.\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s pupils constricted slightly when he saw Han Zhan.\n His reaction didn\u2019t escape Han Zhan\u2019s scrutiny.\n Interesting, this guy is actually afraid of me. But Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t have such a reaction the last time we met. What made him treat me so differently?\n Han Zhan nodded at Cheng Yanmo, who also greeted him.\n Han Zhan patted Song Ci\u2019s shoulder gently. \u201cBaby Ci, go in first. I\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t leave after seeing Song Ci enter Mu Qiu\u2019s ward. Instead, he lifted his chin at Cheng Yanmo and invited her. \u201cShall we have a chat?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo gave him a meaningful look. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Between the inpatient building and the technology building, each level was connected by a spacious corridor. The morning breeze was chilly and there were not many people in the corridor.\n Han Zhan and Cheng Yanmo walked side by side at a distance of 70-80cm, and tacitly walked to a place with the fewest people. Under them was the small field of the hospital, and in the early morning, they could see the high school students in the nearby community practicing at the basketball court.\n As Han Zhan gazed at them, he couldn\u2019t help thinking of his high school days. At that time, he stayed in school and had to wake up early every day to jog around the field for 40 minutes.\n Only an early bird could see the most beautiful morning sun.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "186": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-187\n\n Chapter 186: Can\u2019t You be My Silly Sweetheart?  \u201cMr. Han.\u201d Cheng Yanmo broke the silence first.\n \u201cMr. Cheng, I feel like you have something to say to me.\u201d Han Zhan was good at manipulating people\u2019s hearts and was also good at reading people\u2019s expressions. Previously, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s gaze towards him clearly hid many doubts, as if he had something to say.\n Cheng Yanmo purposely didn\u2019t ask about Han Zhan and Han Aoyu\u2019s relationship, but instead said, \u201cSome time ago, the owner of the villa in the forest behind my house moved back.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked him, \u201cMy grandfather mentioned me to you?\u201d Han Zhan was indirectly admitting that he and Han Aoyu were grandfather and grandson.\n Cheng Yanmo wouldn\u2019t mention Grandpa for no reason. Since he had taken the initiative to mention it, he had already guessed his identity. There was no point in hiding it.\n After his guess was confirmed, Cheng Yanmo couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cSo Mr. Han is really that old gentleman\u2019s grandson.\u201d Cheng Yanmo shook his head and chuckled. \u201cMr. Han is truly a mysterious man.\u201d\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help thinking of the first time he met Cheng Yanmo at Old Madam Cheng\u2019s banquet. Cheng Yanmo was a person who didn\u2019t easily offend others or belittle others. \u201cMr. Cheng is also very secretive.\u201d\n For a moment, Cheng Yanmo couldn\u2019t tell if Han Zhan was praising him or mocking him.\n Standing up straight, Han Zhan tilted his head slightly and sized up Cheng Yanmo with his eyes. Cheng Yanmo was wearing silver-rimmed glasses and looked gentlemanly, with the elegance and nobility of a cultured man.\n But the moment one looked deep into the lens, those black eyes seemed like two old wells. They were calm but bottomless.\n Han Zhan sighed with emotion. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up.\u201d He lifted his hand and pointed at his own chest, recalling his childhood days. \u201cAt that time, you always ran behind me. You were much shorter than me and looked especially cowardly when you caught a cold and sniveled.\u201d\n It was rare for Cheng Yanmo to be embarrassed. \u201cI was still young then.\u201d\n ]Han Zhan shook his head. He wasn\u2019t interested in reminiscing with Cheng Yanmo.\n They were no longer children. They had grown up and had their own standpoints.\n \u201cI know you\u2019re investigating me.\u201d Han Zhan cut through the thin layer of mist and said openly to Cheng Yanmo, \u201cIf you want to persuade me to take a step back and let the Mu Family off, I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo felt troubled. \u201cIs there really no way to turn things around?\u201d He and Mu Qiu were lovers after all. He would do his best to help if he could.\n Han Zhan shook his finger. \u201cNo, Song Ci is my bottom line. The Mu Family\u2019s actions are too much.\u201d\n Patting Cheng Yanmo on the shoulder, Han Zhan warned him as an elder. \u201cLittle Mo Mo, if you don\u2019t wish to be drenched in mud, don\u2019t get involved in this messy situation of the Mu Family.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had wanted to plead on behalf of Mu Mian, hoping that Han Zhan would give him some face on account of the relationship between the two families. However, Han Zhan\u2019s \u201cLittle Mo Mo\u201d stunned Cheng Yanmo.\n After silently digesting this mushy way of addressing him, Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t give up. He asked again, \u201cAre you really not going to give in?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He pursed his thin lips and adopted a reluctant stance.\n Cheng Yanmo had no choice but to give up.\n Han Zhan still had to look for Song Ci and didn\u2019t have the energy to continue wasting time with Cheng Yanmo. \u201cExcuse me, let\u2019s chat again when we are free.\u201d\n As he stared at Han Zhan\u2019s back view, two pure black dots gradually gathered in Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes. In a daze, he seemed to have returned to that dream and saw the Han Zhan in his forties.\n In that dream, Han Zhan, who was in his 40s, had already become a legend in Wangdong City. He was the most revered and wealthy man. Not only was he wealthy enough to topple countries, he was also the most revered businessman in the business world.\n Due to that dream, Cheng Yanmo felt uneasy all day.\n The reason was...\n Yesterday, Cheng Yanmo was still overseas on a work trip.\n He heard that Mu Qiu had suddenly fainted from a heart attack and was admitted to the hospital. There was a high probability that she would undergo a heart transplant. Cheng Yanmo was worried about Mu Qiu and was also worried that there would be an accident during the surgery. He immediately left all his work to his subordinate and boarded the plane back to Wangdong City.\n The plane had encountered turbulence in the airspace above Tibet. The situation was urgent and uncontrollable. The air stewardess kept reminding them to put on life vests.\n Cheng Yanmo put on the life jacket and swayed along with the plane. In his daze, many unfamiliar but realistic images appeared in his mind.\n Cheng Yanmo saw many images. There was him, Mu Qiu, Song Ci, his younger brother Cheng Ziang, as well as that wealthy Han Zhan.\n It was a different future.\n In the future that he saw, Song Ci didn\u2019t marry Han Zhan but his good-for-nothing brother. The two of them beat each other up for several years. In the end, Song Ci stabbed Cheng Ziang in the gut. The marriage ended in a comical manner.\n Meanwhile, Mu Qiu had married him at 22 and had two children for him. One was a girl and the other was a boy. They were both smart and adorable.\n But the good times didn\u2019t last long. When she was 29 years old, Mu Qiu\u2019s heart suddenly suffered a heart defect and needed to be replaced. Coincidentally, the adopted daughter of the Mu Family, Song Ci, got into an accident and fell into the Great Dragon River. The rescue failed and she died.\n Song Ci had signed an organ donation agreement before she died. After her death, her heart was naturally donated to her closest family member, Mu Qiu.\n Moreover, Song Ci\u2019s lungs, kidneys, cornea, and well-preserved hands were all donated to those who truly needed them.\n She had once made a name for herself in Wangdong City with her astonishing beauty and musical talent. Even the most beautiful woman in the entire country had perished without a single body!\n It was a good thing that Mu Qiu had survived, but one bad thing after another followed. First, Mu Mian was accused of murdering his business partner, Su Buwang and his wife, as well as his first love when he was young.\n Mu Mian was sentenced to death in prison and the Mu Family collapsed completely.\n After that, the Cheng Family\u2019s businesses were suppressed and ostracized worldwide. Cheng Yanmo was in a passive position and was very busy. It took a long time before he finally found the mastermind targeting the Cheng family.\n Unexpectedly, that person was Wangdong City\u2019s richest man, Han Zhan!\n ]Cheng Yanmo felt that he didn\u2019t have any bad blood with Han Zhan. He had wanted to meet Han Zhan several times to discuss the details, but Han Zhan avoided him.\n He had been at odds with Han Zhan for six years and suffered defeat after defeat. In the end, Chuan Dong Group still lost to Zeus Corporation.\n On the night that Zeus Airlines bought over Chuan Dong International, Cheng Yanmo drove his car into Wangjiang Mountain City, ignoring the security guards.\n He found Han Zhan and questioned him angrily why he wanted to kill his family.\n Dressed in black, the man stood under the blooming magnolia tree in his backyard. He touched his eyes gently and said in a gentle voice, \u201cLook, the magnolia is blooming.\u201d He seemed to be whispering to his lover, his tone very light.\n Cheng Yanmo glanced at the magnolia tree. It was filled with hundreds of flowers and was indeed beautiful.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a pity she can\u2019t see.\u201d Han Zhan raised his hand and plucked a magnolia. He placed it under his nose and sniffed. \u201cShe said that she likes magnolias, so I planted magnolias all over the yard.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve been alone in this courtyard for six years, but I\u2019ll never be able to see its owner again.\u201d Han Zhan crushed the magnolia with two fingers on his left hand, causing white liquid to flow out.\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s brows twitched as he stared at the concoction. He heard Han Zhan say, \u201cCEO Cheng, go back and greet your wife on my behalf. Ask her if Song Ci\u2019s heart is still well?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was shocked.\n He never expected that the decline of the Cheng Family and Chuan Dong Group was because of a woman! A divorced woman!\n After Cheng Yanmo arrived home, he questioned Mu Qiu about Han Zhan\u2019s words. Helpless, Mu Qiu finally admitted her crime to him.\n Only then did Cheng Yanmo realize that top socialite Song Ci\u2019s death was not an accident. It was Mu Mian and his daughter conspiring to murder her and take her heart to continue Mu Qiu\u2019s life!\n Cheng Yanmo gazed at his wife, who was as beautiful and elegant as a teenage girl. He felt like he had been deceived. How could his wife, whom he loved so deeply, be such a heartless, murderous woman who would kill her own sister just to live?\n Due to this incident, the relationship between the two of them broke down. Although they didn\u2019t get a divorce, they were no longer husband and wife.\n In the second year, when Mu Qiu was crossing the road, she suddenly fainted from a cerebral hemorrhage and was crushed to death by a car that couldn\u2019t control its speed. Meanwhile, Cheng Yanmo was forced into a corner by the bank and his creditors. In the end, he perished.\n The future he saw was absurd and terrifying.\n Cheng Yanmo fell into a dream-like trance. At this moment, a child walked past Cheng Yanmo. He had accidentally crushed the balloon in his hand and it exploded.\n Cheng Yanmo seemed to have heard a gunshot and felt the pain of being shot in the throat and neck. He snapped out of his trance and saw that Han Zhan had just walked away.\n The 32-year-old Han Zhan and the 47-year-old Han Zhan\u2019s shadows overlapped. Cheng Yanmo snapped out of his trance and broke out in a cold sweat.\n Seeing that the child had scared Cheng Yanmo, the child\u2019s father quickly apologized. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this child is naughty. You must have been scared Sir.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo gazed at the broken balloon in front of the child. He had a nagging feeling that something had ruptured and exploded along with those balloons, never to recover.\n \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Shaking his head, Cheng Yanmo took the lift down from the technology building and left the hospital.\n He was a materialist and didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, gods, or Buddhas. He also didn\u2019t believe in previous and current lives, but the scenes in his dreams were too vivid and real. Even now, thinking about it, he still felt chills down his spine.\n Cheng Yanmo had no choice but to believe that this was a warning from the heavens. It was a warning to him not to provoke Song Ci and Han Zhan, to not get entangled with Mu Qiu, and to avoid the same mistake as in the dream world.\n The Cheng Family and Chuan Dong Group must not be destroyed in my hands!\n I can\u2019t be that sinner!\n \u2013\n Knock knock.\n Song Ci knocked on the door and waited patiently outside the ward.\n The person who opened the door was Du Tingting. She opened the door and saw Song Ci standing outside. Her face lit up in embarrassment.\n \u201cSong Song...\u201d Du Tingting called out to Song Ci shyly. After that, Du Tingting lowered her head. After what happened last night, Du Tingting no longer had the face to face Song Ci.\n Song Ci noticed Du Tingting\u2019s guilt and uneasiness. She was slightly moved. \u201cMother, you look very pale. Did you not rest yesterday night?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not.\u201d\n The two of them didn\u2019t mention Mu Mian at all. It was as if this would deny Mu Mian\u2019s attempt to harm Song Fei.\n Song Ci glanced behind Du Tingting and saw that Mu Qiu was still lying in bed unmoving. She asked, \u201cI heard that Mu Qiu suffered a heart attack yesterday night. Is she still unconscious?\u201d\n Noticing that Song Ci was addressing Mu Qiu by name and not affectionately addressing her as Qiu-er, Du Tingting immediately understood Song Ci\u2019s stance.\n Shaking her head, Du Tingting told her, \u201cHer heart has deteriorated very quickly. She started coughing and there was blood in her phlegm...\u201d\n Du Tingting didn\u2019t continue.\n Song Ci also understood Du Tingting\u2019s meaning.\n Since Mu Qiu was still unconscious, there was no need for her to go in. \u201cMother, you must take good care of yourself. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d She still had to go downstairs to visit Song Fei.\n Du Tingting suddenly grabbed Song Fei\u2019s wrist.\n Song Ci turned and looked at Du Tingting silently.\n Du Tingting looked at Song Ci with tears in her eyes. Her lips moved as if she had a lot to say. Song Ci could read the meaning in Du Tingting\u2019s eyes but pretended not to understand.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d She reached out to remove Du Tingting\u2019s hands.\n But Du Tingting held onto her tightly.\n Before Song Ci could shake her hands off, Du Tingting suddenly knelt down in front of her. Her hair was in disarray and she didn\u2019t look elegant at all.\n \u201cSong Song...\u201d Du Tingting lowered her head as tears streamed down her face.\n Song Ci stared at her expressionlessly, without saying a word.\n Du Tingting hugged Song Ci\u2019s hand and wailed. \u201cSong Song, Qiu-er is dying soon. Song Song, take pity on me. Don\u2019t let them take Mu Mian away, alright?\u201d\n Placing her right hand on Du Tingting\u2019s hands, Song Ci pried her fingers away one by one.\n Retracting her hand, she looked at Du Tingting coldly. Song Ci asked, \u201cYou advised me to leave Mu Mian for you, but who advised Mu Mian to leave Song Fei for me?\u201d\n As the wife of the victim, how could Du Tingting have the face to beg me, the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s forgiveness? If I can even forgive murder, what is the point of the law?\n \u201cMother, one person pays his debts. I won\u2019t pin Mu Mian\u2019s crime on you, but don\u2019t force me either.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s heart was as cold as iron. She said, \u201cI won\u2019t let Mu Mian off. Song Fei is my bottom line.\u201d\n Du Tingting knew that Song Ci would never forgive Mu Mian.\n Thinking of how close Song Ci and Mu Qiu were, she didn\u2019t give up and played the emotional card. \u201cSong Song, your father was blinded by greed and did such a foolish thing! But he had no choice. He did it for Mu Qiu. You and Mu Qiu are sisters. Can you really not let your father off? If Qiu-er sees her father in jail, she might die in a moment of panic!\u201d\n Du Tingting was not a ruthless person. She could be said to be a kind-hearted and weak woman, but this weak woman had put the familial relation knife to Song Ci\u2019s neck, forcing her to be magnanimous.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart turned cold. \u201cA biological daughter is indeed valuable. Someone else\u2019s daughter is cheap.\u201d She bent down and looked at Du Tingting straight in the eye.\n Looking at Du Tingting\u2019s tear-streaked face, Song Ci asked her, \u201cMother, from the start to the end, did you really not know of Mu Mian\u2019s actions?\u201d\n Du Tingting was speechless.\n \u201cTwo months ago, at the cafe when Mu Qiu was hospitalized for the first time, you asked me about Song Fei\u2019s whereabouts. At that time, you sensed Mu Mian\u2019s ill intentions towards Song Fei, right?\u201d\n \u201cMother, you are still on Mu Mian\u2019s side. You are actually helping him by hiding his despicable actions!\u201d\n Du Tingting was pinned to the ground the moment she heard the words \u201chiding his despicable actions\u201d. She couldn\u2019t move at all. Du Tingting\u2019s face was drained of all color as her lashes quivered wildly.\n She couldn\u2019t help thinking that if she had told Song Ci about this after discovering that Mu Mian had ill intentions towards Song Fei, the Song sisters might have kept a watch on Mu Mian and things wouldn\u2019t have happened like yesterday night.\n Du Tingting felt very guilty, realizing that her unknowing indulgence towards Mu Mian had indirectly caused this situation today.\n At this moment, Han Zhan walked over. Seeing Du Tingting kneeling and Song Ci squatting, he roughly understood what had happened. \u201cGet up.\u201d He grabbed Song Ci\u2019s arm and helped her up.\n Song Ci stood obediently beside Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan looked down at Du Tingting from above. Although he knew that this woman was not bad, her protectiveness towards Mu Mian still displeased Han Zhan.\n \u201cMrs. Mu.\u201d Han Zhan and Du Tingting didn\u2019t have any feelings for each other. Unlike Song Ci, he didn\u2019t have to think twice before speaking. He told Du Tingting, \u201cInstead of asking Song Ci to forgive Mu Mian here, why don\u2019t you ask your husband what other crimes he has committed?\u201d\n Glancing at Mu Qiu, who was sleeping soundly on the bed in the ward, Han Zhan said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wipe your eyes brighter so that you can see what kind of person your own daughter is?\u201d\n \u201cExcuse me.\u201d With that, Han Zhan pulled Song Ci away.\n Du Tingting felt even more uneasy after hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words. Her brows kept twitching. Could it be that Mu Mian had committed some other atrocities?\n No way!\n Hubby isn\u2019t such a vicious person.\n He had no choice but to target Song Fei this time because of Mu Qiu\u2019s condition! Moreover, I know my daughter very well.\n Han Zhan must be scaring me!\n Du Tingting could only comfort herself like this.\n Han Zhan pulled Song Ci along for a while. Only when Du Tingting was out of sight did he release Song Ci\u2019s wrist. \u201cWere you soft-hearted again just now? You couldn\u2019t bear it anymore?\u201d Han Zhan expected better from her and wanted to shake Song Ci\u2019s head to empty it.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI don\u2019t pity her, nor could I not bear to. I just feel that she is quite pitiful. After sleeping with her husband for more than 20 years, she actually doesn\u2019t know his true colors. Her daughter whom she brought up personally is also an ingrate.\u201d\n \u201cI just feel that it\u2019s quite pathetic for a woman to live like this.\u201d\n Han Zhan knew that Song Ci\u2019s heart had softened.\n \u201cAre you still going to visit Song Fei?\u201d\n \u201cI am going.\u201d\n Song Ci and Han Zhan arrived at Song Fei\u2019s ward.\n The hospital beds were very tight. Be it the VIP wards or the normal wards, there were no extra beds. Moreover, there were even people queuing up to be admitted.\n Song Fei was still in the ward from last night. She had already woken up and changed into light blue pyjamas. Yan Jiang sat quietly on the stool beside Song Fei\u2019s bed, staring at her without blinking.\n That serious expression was like an evil dragon staring at a gold jewel, afraid of it being stolen.\n From the time Song Fei woke up, Yan Jiang had been staring at her. Regardless of how strong Song Fei\u2019s mental fortitude was, she still felt goosebumps all over. \u201cCan you not look at me like that?\u201d There was a tinge of helplessness in Song Fei\u2019s cold voice.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t seem to hear her words and remained still.\n Song Fei suddenly asked him, \u201cHave you not slept or eaten these few days?\u201d In less than 10 days, Yan Jiang had lost weight and his eyes were bloodshot.\n Song Fei\u2019s heart ached slightly.\n She reached out hesitantly and touched Yan Jiang\u2019s cheek. It was not even fat and felt uncomfortable. \u201cToo skinny!\u201d\n Song Fei was about to retract her hand when Yan Jiang suddenly grabbed her elbow, pulled her up from the bed, and pulled her into his arms.\n Song Fei was caught off guard and fell into his arms.\n She lifted her head and scolded him angrily. \u201cWhat are you doing?! I am feeling dizzy...\u201d Song Fei was still feeling dizzy and nauseous after being given a full-body anesthesia. Now that Yan Jiang had tugged at her, her stomach felt very uncomfortable.\n The rest of her words disappeared from Yan Jiang\u2019s thin, red eyes.\n \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d Yan Jiang said in confusion.\n Song Fei understood what Yan Jiang meant and stopped struggling.\n Yan Jiang lifted his right hand and ran his fingertips carefully along Song Fei\u2019s brows and nose. Every inch of skin that his fingers touched was scorching hot.\n It is warm and alive.\n \u201cAh Fei.\u201d Yan Jiang lowered his head and rested his forehead against Song Fei\u2019s. He spoke softly as if he was in a dream. \u201cAh Fei, be good. Don\u2019t push me away in my dream.\u201d\n Song Fei was stunned.\n A rare hint of astonishment flashed across her ice-cold eyes.\n Dream?\n Yan Jiang actually thought he was dreaming!\n Song Fei realized that Yan Jiang was behaving strangely. She felt guilty and angry at the same time. Is this guy so vulnerable without me?\n But she couldn\u2019t bear to push Yan Jiang away.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan entered the ward and saw a man and a woman hugging by the window. Song Ci paused and hesitated, before turning around to hold Han Zhan\u2019s hand.\n Han Zhan understood what she meant.\n The two of them quietly left the ward. Standing in the corridor, Song Ci said, \u201cBrother Han, prepare the money. I think in just a year or so, my elder sister will get married.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled and stroked her hair. \u201cHow much are you going to give?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYou guys are on good terms. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n Han Zhan sharply detected the jealousy in Song Ci\u2019s words. He frowned and explained seriously, \u201cI don\u2019t have a good relationship with Song Fei. I\u2019m good to you and that\u2019s why I\u2019m good to her. I love you, so I love your family too.\u201d\n He liked Song Ci, but he did not like every pretty girl that looked like her.\n Song Ci snorted and mocked Han Zhan. \u201cIf you two are not on good terms, will you conspire together? Will you deceive me and Ah Jiang?\u201d\n Hearing this, a crack appeared on Han Zhan\u2019s handsome face. He felt very guilty but still maintained his posture and asked Song Ci, pretending to be puzzled, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t understand?\u201d Song Ci pointed at Song Fei\u2019s ward and questioned Han Zhan. \u201cYou dare to say that you weren\u2019t involved in Song Fei\u2019s kidnapping?\u201d\n Han Zhan was about to explain when Song Ci added. \u201cI won\u2019t say anything about others, but I still know how smart and scheming my elder sister is. She\u2019s so smart and cautious\u2014how could she have been so easily captured by Mu Mian? She must have purposely fallen into the trap and plotted to have Mu Mian jump into your trap to seek revenge on him.\u201d\n Han Zhan shuddered.\n He had belittled Song Ci. This girl is no fool. She knew everything clearly.\n Song Ci continued. \u201cMu Mian and Du Tingting lost a child and Mu Qiu became their sole hope. Mu Qiu doesn\u2019t have much time left and under such circumstances, Mu Mian is naturally willing to do whatever it takes to save his daughter\u2019s life.\u201d\n At this point, Song Fei and I will be in grave danger. But recently, I haven\u2019t had many bodyguards by my side. This means that you know very well that I won\u2019t be in danger. If I\u2019m not in danger, Song Fei will be in danger in a chaotic situation.\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei is in Africa. People frequently die there. Even if Song Fei were to die in Africa, there will be no reason to doubt it. Mu Mian just needs to spend some money to create the illusion that Song Fei is dead and then think of a way to secretly send Song Fei back to China. In this way, he can take Song Fei\u2019s heart and save Mu Qiu!\u201d\n Song Ci sneered as she looked at Han Zhan mockingly. \u201cBrother Han, you are so smart. You definitely can think of something that I can think of. You clearly know that Song Fei has already become Mu Mian\u2019s eyesore. How can you let Song Fei go to Golden Sands alone?\u201d\n Although Song Ci\u2019s analysis was logical, she actually wasn\u2019t sure if it was true.\n She was just guessing.\n ]But as she went deeper into her conjecture, she felt that her analysis was right. In the process, she also noticed some things that she had overlooked.\n Song Ci told Han Zhan again, \u201cYesterday afternoon, when I arrived at Zeus Building, I think I saw Long Yu. Long Yu went back to Wangdong City, right?\u201d\n ]Long Yu\u2019s return couldn\u2019t be hidden from Song Ci, so Han Zhan acknowledged.\n Song Ci\u2019s expression turned even colder. \u201cLong Yu\u2019s hometown is in the north, right? It\u2019s autumn now and the sun isn\u2019t as hot as in summer. If Long Yu went back to his hometown before returning to Wangdong City, why is he so tanned that he looks like an African...?\u201d\n Song Ci narrowed her lovely eyes and tried to intimidate Han Zhan. \u201cHan Zhan, did you send Long Yu to Golden Sands?\u201d\n The way Han Zhan looked at Song Ci finally changed.\n It was the first time he realized that Song Ci was also a smart girl.\n \u201cCan\u2019t you just obediently be my silly little Baby Ci?\u201d Han Zhan patted Song Ci\u2019s head, slightly troubled. \u201cWhy are you so smart?\u201d She could have depended on her looks for a living, but she chose to rely on her intelligence.\n He admitted it!\n Han Zhan and Song Fei had collaborated to plot this revenge. They had deceived Song Ci by keeping it a secret. Song Ci felt very wronged to be deceived by the two most important people beside her.\n Song Ci was filled with anger. She smacked Han Zhan\u2019s hand away mercilessly. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Song Ci turned and walked downstairs. Her back view was hurried, like a cat that had its tail stepped on.\n Han Zhan was slightly terrified.\n Song Ci was really angry this time\u2014the kind that was hard to please.\n Song Ci returned to the ward without a word. She packed her things and was about to be discharged.\n She had originally pretended to be ill to gain the sympathy of the crowd so that they could fan the flames on the Internet and create hype for Song Fei\u2019s incident. Now that Song Ci had achieved her goal, there was no need for her to stay in the hospital anymore.\n She tidied up her toiletries and went to the nurse\u2019s desk to settle the discharge procedures. Han Zhan stood there and saw her carrying a bag of toiletries over. He volunteered. \u201cLet me carry it.\u201d\n Song Ci treated him like air.\n Han Zhan looked embarrassed when he did not get a response.\n Song Ci quickly completed the discharge procedure. Han Zhan followed closely behind her, afraid that she would disappear the moment he closed his eyes.\n When Song Ci reached out to call for a cab, Han Zhan finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He rushed up, carried Song Ci in his arms, and walked towards his own car.\n Song Ci struggled in his arms. \u201cPut me down!\u201d\n ]Han Zhan said, \u201cStop fooling around. If you want, do it in the car.\u201d\n Han Zhan locked Song Ci into the car.\n The two of them sat in the backseat, each occupying a seat with a small baby\u2019s distance between them. Song Ci\u2019s eyes were red with grievance as she stubbornly looked out the window without turning back.\n Han Zhan had no choice. After thinking for a moment, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the fruit shop to buy a durian and I go home to kneel on it?\u201d This was the cruelest punishment that Han Zhan could think of.\n Song Ci almost smiled through her tears.\n She controlled her smile and turned to look at Han Zhan expressionlessly.\n Han Zhan knew that he was at fault for this. He lowered his stance and took the initiative to apologize sincerely. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Baby Ci. I did collaborate with Song Fei to deceive everyone. I know I was wrong, but if you give me another chance to choose, I will still do it.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart had softened at first, but she was enraged by his words. \u201cYou still think you didn\u2019t do anything wrong! How dare you act so self-righteously!\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei is more intelligent and resourceful than you. Actually, this was her idea.\u201d Han Zhan said calmly, \u201cYou can\u2019t compare to her for coming up with such a vicious plan. Only someone as vicious as Song Fei can complete such a risky revenge. Song Ci, compared to Song Fei, you are too kind and weak.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s accurate analysis left Song Ci speechless.\n Although she knew that Han Zhan was speaking the truth, she was still angry. \u201cThis incident is full of danger. Aren\u2019t you afraid that something will really happen to my sister?\u201d\n \u201cNo, everything is under our control. The person who transported Song Fei back to Wangdong City from Golden Sands was none other than Long Yu and the rest.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n She muttered, \u201cThat\u2019s why Mu Mian was the one who was tricked. He was doomed from the start.\u201d Song Fei was indeed a ruthless person to have thought of such a plan.\n \u201cYes.\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cWhen I heard Song Fei say this bold plan, I knew Mu Mian was done for.\u201d\n Anyone would lose to a maniac like Song Fei who dared to kill herself.\n Although this plan was very meticulous and successful, Song Ci still felt a lingering fear. \u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t forgive you easily.\u201d\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help feeling worried. \u201cThen what can I do to make you forgive me?\u201d\n It was also impossible for Song Ci to really fight it out with Han Zhan over this matter. Husband and wife fought at the head of the bed and reconciled at the end of it. Song Ci thought for a moment before fiercely telling Han Zhan, \u201cOne durian won\u2019t do, at least two.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Han Zhan still had work to do. After returning home, he stayed in the meeting room, turned on the television, and held a meeting with Li Li and the rest of the senior management.\n This was not the first time Han Zhan had a video conference with them, so everyone was familiar with his meeting room.\n Li Li stared at Han Zhan and suddenly said, \u201cMr. Han, you changed chairs?\u201d The Han Zhan in the video conference today seemed to be taller than usual.\n Han Zhan glanced at Li Li coldly. \u201cMmm.\u201d\n No one knew that the composed CEO Han was actually kneeling on a chair with a black keyboard placed between his knees.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear for Han Zhan to kneel on durians, but a keyboard was okay.\n Bei Zhan smiled. \u201cYour chair is too high. We still have to look up at you.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cYou guys have to get used to admiring me.\u201d After all, he was going to be the richest man in the future.\n Everyone was speechless.\n Han Zhan was having a meeting upstairs and Song Ci was sitting on the sofa talking on the phone.\n Su Beibei\u2019s voice drifted over to Song Ci. \u201cAfter thinking about it, I still feel that the relationship between Mu Mian and his father, Mu Congjun, is very interesting.\u201d\n There was no one downstairs. It was very quiet. Su Beibei\u2019s voice was amplified and echoed throughout the entire living room.\n Song Ci heard Su Bei honking and frowned. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n \u201cOutside.\u201d Song Ci thought Su Beibei was just wandering around outside, but she heard her say, \u201cOn the way to the Grand Resting Hall.\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you going to the hall?\u201d Song Ci sat up straight.\n Su Beibei said, \u201cI want to go and see Mu Congjun again. I keep feeling like I\u2019m missing something.\u201d Her sixth sense told her that Mu Congjun was the key point.\n Song Ci looked at the time and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\n Su Beibei looked at the navigation system and told Song Ci, \u201cI am near your house. I will come and fetch you.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci went upstairs and knocked on Han Zhan\u2019s door.\n Hearing the sound of the knocks, Han Zhan said to Li Li and the rest, \u201cOne moment.\u201d Han Zhan turned off the video first, before removing his legs from the keyboard.\n After kneeling for more than 20 minutes, his knees felt rather uncomfortable. Han Zhan rubbed his knees through the material of his suit pants, before getting up to open the door.\n Seeing that Song Ci was wearing a jacket and carrying a bag, obviously going out, Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n \u201cBeibei is near our house and asked me down to play.\u201d Song Ci hugged Han Zhan\u2019s cheek and gave him a kiss. She then waved. \u201cI am going out to have fun. Brother Han doesn\u2019t need to wait for me for lunch.\u201d\n Song Ci swayed her hips and left.\n Han Zhan instantly felt lonely.\n Since Song Ci was not at home, Han Zhan kept his laptop and went to work.\n Su Beibei\u2019s car was parked outside the district. It was a flashy Porsche sports car that was very easy to recognize. Song Ci sat in the passenger seat and sighed. \u201cThis car of yours isn\u2019t cheap, right? You guys earn quite a bit writing novels.\u201d\n Su Beibei replied, \u201cNot bad.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly impressed by Su Beibei. She said, \u201cI am not so smart. In the past, my essays were always off topic. I especially admire those who can write stories.\u201d\n Su Beibei looked at Song Ci\u2019s flawless skin and said, \u201cI envy those who are born beautiful.\u201d\n \u201cYou look good too.\u201d\n Su Beibei pointed at her own eyes. \u201cI made these double eyelids.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s quite natural.\u201d Song Ci leaned close to look at Su Bei\u2019s eyelids. \u201cI knew something was off. Your childhood photos were obviously monocular. I thought they grew out later. This hospital you found is not bad. It\u2019s done very well. Li Li definitely won\u2019t be able to tell.\u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cI did double eyelids because I think double eyelids are more suitable for me. Becoming beautiful is to please myself, not men.\u201d\n Song Ci applauded for her. \u201cWell said sister!\u201d\n The two of them chatted as they headed towards the Grand Resting Hall.\n Arriving at the entrance of the hall, Song Ci and Su Beibei fell silent. They sat in the car and weren\u2019t in a hurry to alight. Song Ci stared at the door. \u201cWhat if the items aren\u2019t here?\u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cThen we\u2019ll keep looking.\u201d\n The two of them alighted, fooled the guards at the door, and entered the hall. This hall was more luxurious than the one Song Ci had chosen for Song Fei. Song Ci thought she had entered a huge hotel.\n Su Beibei had been here once. She brought Song Ci over to Mu Congjun\u2019s cupboard.\n Su Beibei nodded at the cupboard door. \u201cThis is it.\u201d\n Only then did Song Ci see only an urn and a small bottle of Erguotou inside. Everything looked the same as the last time Su Beibei came.\n Song Ci took out the Erguotou bottle and fiddled with it. She sneered. \u201cMu Mian is making sure that his father can\u2019t die in peace.\u201d\n Isn\u2019t it ironic that a drunkard who had passed away unexpectedly due to drinking would be worshipped by his son year after year with alcohol?\n Su Beibei took Song Ci\u2019s hand. The odd feeling in her heart grew stronger.\n \u201cTake out the urn,\u201d Su Beibei said.\n Hearing this, Song Ci was slightly shocked. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Did this count as raiding someone\u2019s ancestral grave?\n \u201cScared?\u201d Su Beibei smiled in disdain. \u201cCoward, what a waste of such big breasts.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "187": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-188\n\n Chapter 187: Mu Mian: I Confess!  After mocking Song Ci, Su Beibei really reached out and took out that old porcelain urn.\n Song Ci looked around like a sentry. \u201cThe gatekeeper isn\u2019t around. Hurry up.\u201d\n Su Beibei picked up the urn and studied the bottom of it. She didn\u2019t notice anything unusual and turned the urn around. The urn had an image of a crane flying west. It was rather unique.\n No matter how she looked at it, this was just an ordinary urn. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with its exterior.\u201d Even if there was nothing wrong with its exterior, there was no telling what was inside.\n Su Beibei suddenly glanced at Song Ci and lifted her chin.\n \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Song Ci felt that Su Beibei\u2019s eyes harbored ill intentions.\n Su Beibei said, \u201cSong Ci, open it.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s mouth twitched. She quickly shook her head and rejected Su Beibei. \u201cUs beautiful young ladies never pry open someone\u2019s ashes.\u201d How wicked.\n Su Beibei glared at her. So what if she is a pretty girl? \u201cAlright then, only a vicious girl like me can do it.\u201d Su Beibei looked around and instructed Song Ci, \u201cKeep watch.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci scanned her surroundings, and was extremely careful if anyone was coming.\n Taking out someone\u2019s ashes was no different from digging up their grave. It was also the first time the vicious girl Su Beibei had done such an immoral thing. She was also feeling very cowardly.\n Su Beibei steeled herself and mustered up the courage to open the urn.\n Click.\n \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci didn\u2019t turn back. She was also afraid of looking back and seeing something scary. She stared elsewhere and asked Su Beibei, \u201cDid you see anything? Are there any bones?\u201d\n Without Su Beibei\u2019s reply, Song Ci felt like a cat was scratching at her heart. Unable to control her curiosity, she turned and leaned against Su Beibei\u2019s shoulder to look into the urn.\n Gray ashes mixed with bone dust. This was how a person would look after death.\n ]\u201dNo problem.\u201d Song Ci got Su Bei to close the lid. \u201cLet\u2019s go. No problem.\u201d\n \u201cWait.\u201d Su Beibei placed the urn back into the cupboard but didn\u2019t close it. Instead, she reached into her own bag and took out a transparent disposable glove.\n Just those free disposable gloves from KFC.\n Guessing what Su Beibei wanted to do, Song Ci\u2019s lips quivered. \u201cBeibei, are you serious?\u201d\n \u201cShh.\u201d Su Beibei put her hand to her mouth and signaled Song Ci to be quiet.\n Song Ci secretly swallowed her saliva and observed her surroundings fearfully.\n Su Beibei was just a mystery writer. She had portrayed many scary freaks, but she was not a real freak. It was also her first time touching someone\u2019s ashes and she felt rather scared.\n Suppressing her fear, Su Beibei reached in.\n No matter how one put it, that feeling was no different from touching ashes. It was just frightening. Su Bei continued to feel inside the urn. Her fingers reached under the urn and finally felt something different.\n \u201cFound it!\u201d Su Beibei couldn\u2019t conceal her excitement.\n Song Ci was shocked.\n There really is something?\n She turned to look at Su Beibei\u2019s hand and saw that she was holding a small flash drive. The design of the flash drive was very ordinary and pure black. One look and one could tell that it was an old thing from many years ago.\n Song Ci and Su Beibei looked at each other in surprise.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\n Song Ci followed Su Bei back to her living quarters above her cafe.\n Walking into the study and closing the door, Su Beibei immediately found a hairdryer and handed it to Song Ci. \u201cBlow away the dust on the flash drive.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t resist this time. She turned on the hairdryer and blew the ashes.\n Su Beibei sat on a stool and opened her laptop. After Song Ci had blown it clean, Su Beibei let her plug in the USB. Song Ci plugged in the USB and asked Su Beibei, \u201cCan it be used?\u201d\n \u201cYes, it\u2019s not broken.\u201d\n There were a total of three documents in this USB drive. The first was named \u201cXu Xiangxiang.\u201d\n \u201cOpen it.\u201d Song Ci urged Su Beibei.\n Su Beibei didn\u2019t hesitate and opened the document.\n Pages of photos popped into their view. They could see that these photos were taken by someone using a camera.\n The handwriting on the letter was elegant and the handwriting was the same. It was probably written by the same girl. Without a doubt, the owner of the letter must be Xu Xiangxiang.\n Su Beibei opened the first letter. It read:\n Ah Mian, today is the 20th day after you went to Wangdong University to study. How have you been? Are you used to everything in school?\n I found a textile factory with a monthly salary of 550 yuan. Food and housing are provided.\n The last time you said you wanted to buy a pair of sneakers, so I saved some money and bought you a pair of white sneakers. I heard they are branded and cost 150 yuan.\n I think you\u2019d look very handsome in those shoes playing basketball on the court.\u2019\n Your father didn\u2019t give you any allowance, right? I put 200 yuan in your shoes. Remember to take it out and save it for your own meals.\n Ah Mian, study hard. I will look for you after you graduate from university...\n I hope everything goes well for you.\n Xu Xiangxiang.\n 17 September 1995.\n After reading this letter, both Su Beibei and Song Ci felt rather upset.\n \u201cShe\u2019s so pitiful.\u201d Song Ci felt sorry for Xu Xiangxiang. \u201cShe spent 350 yuan on Mu Mian when her salary is 550 yuan a month. This beast is so vicious but so well-liked.\u201d\n Both Xu Xiangxiang and Du Tingting were infatuated with Mu Mian.\n What capabilities did he have?\n Su Beibei looked troubled and didn\u2019t respond. Su Beibei continued to flip through the photos. The two of them saw how devoted Xu Xiangxiang was to Mu Mian and were deeply moved.\n At the end of the letter, Xu Xiangxiang wrote:\n Ah Mian, long time no see.\n I heard that you are married to a gentle and beautiful lady from an affluent family. She comes from an wealthy family, has excellent grades and is even the belle of your art department!\n Over the past few years, you have been replying to my letters less and less frequently. I guessed that you might have already fallen in love with someone else. But I didn\u2019t expect that not only did you fall in love with someone else, you were also married to her and even had a child who is over a year old!\n Mu Mian, you spent so much effort to lie to me!\n We were in love with each other after all. It\u2019s a pity for us to end things so hastily.\n I am going to Wangdong City next week and I want to meet you. Even if we are to break up, we should make things clear in person.\n When you were wooing me, you gave me breakfast for a month without any issues. When we broke up, I also hope that you could tell me personally: Xu Xiangxiang, I don\u2019t love you anymore.\n A relationship had to have a beginning and an end.\n Xu Xiangxiang.\n April 9, 2002.\n This was the last letter that Xu Xiangxiang had written to Mu Mian. From the first letter to the last, it had taken more than seven years.\n They had been in a long-distance relationship for seven years. In the second year, Mu Mian met Du Tingting and started wooing her passionately.\n In other words, Mu Mian had been in love with Du Tingting, while keeping the other girl devoted to him by his side for six years!\n In terms of jerks, Mu Mian still ranked at the top.\n Xu Xiangxiang would never have imagined that Wangdong City would be her death journey! She would never believe that the man whom she had loved for 10 years since high school would actually kill her!\n \u201cWhat a pity. Mu Mian took the money from Xu Xiangxiang and wore the clothes and shoes that she sent to date Du Tingting. I really don\u2019t know if I should call him thick-skinned or shameless!\u201d\n \u201cHe got married and had a child, but he still refused to settle things with Xu Xiangxiang and continued to pester her. A woman\u2019s prime years were wasted on him.\u201d\n \u201cI feel bad for her.\u201d\n Song Ci cursed indignantly. \u201cMu Mian is such a jerk!\u201d She was so angry for Xu Xiangxiang that she gritted her teeth. She hated that she couldn\u2019t just kill Mu Mian to avenge Xu Xiangxiang.\n Su Beibei controlled herself and didn\u2019t scold him. Instead, she asked Song Ci, \u201cSay, why didn\u2019t Mu Mian break up with Xu Xiangxiang? Isn\u2019t he and Du Tingting truly in love? Why did he continue to keep Xu Xiangxiang hanging?\u201d\n True love was also rather cheap.\n If one wasn\u2019t involved, one could never guess. Song Ci shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I only know that Xu Xiangxiang is so pitiful.\u201d Du Tingting, who had been deceived by Mu Mian her entire life, was also very pitiful.\n \u201cThere\u2019s one more photo we haven\u2019t seen.\u201d Su Beibei opened the last photo. This photo was taken by Mu Mian from a news agency.\n Wangdong City Daily News: [Yesterday, a young lady committed suicide by jumping off a building at our city\u2019s Dieyi Building. After investigations, this lady is from Haicheng and is an orphan. She came to Wangdong City to work for a living and died from stress...]\n A love murder was so hastily defined as suicide.\n Su Beibei scrolled down the photos.\n As she clicked on the second document called \u201cRecording,\u201d Su Beibei said to Song Ci, \u201cMu Mian saved these photos to show that he enjoyed the entire crime. Especially after the crime ended, he didn\u2019t let the police find out the truth behind Xu Xiangxiang\u2019s suicide. He took these photos and reports to reminisce later.\u201d\n \u201cWe call such people perverted.\u201d They were extremely dangerous.\n As she spoke, Su Beibei had already opened the recording file. There was only a recorded voice. Opening it, a male voice pierced through the computer and magnified in the study.\n ]\u201dMu Mian! I saw everything that happened that day.\u201d Hearing this voice, Su Beibei was stunned. Her fingers that were holding the mouse trembled slightly.\n Song Ci guessed the reason and asked Su Beibei, \u201cIs this your father\u2019s voice?\u201d\n Su Beibei frowned and said in a low voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember Father\u2019s voice anymore.\u201d Although Su Beibei didn\u2019t remember, this voice sounded familiar to her.\n Her intuition told her that this voice belonged to her father, Su Buwang.\n In the recording, Mu Mian pretended to be calm and asked, \u201cWhich day? What did you see?\u201d\n Su Buwang said, \u201cFour years ago, on the night of your murder.\u201d With that, Su Buwang paused, expecting to see Mu Mian\u2019s fearful reaction.\n But not only was Mu Mian not afraid or guilty, after a short period of silence, he even asked with interest, \u201cOh? Which night did I kill? Who did I kill?\u201d\n He wouldn\u2019t confess without a fight. He had to hear the entire story from Su Buwang before he could make a decision on how to deal with this person.\n Su Buwang had no idea that a demon had already opened its jaws wide, waiting to devour him.\n \u201cFour years ago, we were in the early stages of our entrepreneurship. I was busy with work and didn\u2019t have the time to accompany your sister-in-law or Beibei. That night, your sister-in-law quarreled with me over the phone and even said she wanted a divorce when she got angry. I was very upset and wasn\u2019t in the mood to work overtime, so I went to the rooftop of the building to have a smoke.\u201d Su Buwang was probably recalling what happened that night. His tone was slightly slow and sounded like he was narrating a story.\n At that time, the management of the top floor of the skyscraper wasn\u2019t as strict as it was now. One could get in whenever they wanted.\n \u201cWhen I arrived at the building, I saw a young lady on the rooftop. I even spoke to her. She told me that her name is Xu Xiangxiang and she is from Haicheng. She came to Wangdong City to look for her boyfriend.\u201d\n \u201cHearing your footsteps, she said it was her boyfriend and so I went to the other side to smoke. To be honest, I was rather shocked to see that her boyfriend was you.\u201d\n \u201cTsk tsk.\u201d Su Buwang complimented Mu Mian in a sarcastic manner. \u201cMu Mian, oh Mu Mian, your acting skills are really good. It has been so many years, but I didn\u2019t realize that you were still a Chen Shimei [1. Chen Shimei is someone who is known to be flirtatious and uncommitted in China]!\u201d\n \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect you to have a wild flower outside, even though your wife is so beautiful and outstanding.\u201d Su Buwang\u2019s sarcastic comment didn\u2019t enrage Mu Mian.\n Still very composed, Mu Mian asked calmly, \u201cSo, what did you see?\u201d\n \u201cWhat did I see? I saw you arguing with that woman and she threatened you to lay your cards on the table with Du Tingting. You got angry and pretended to comfort her. You hugged her and pushed her off the building when she wasn\u2019t looking...\u201d\n Mu Mian fell silent upon hearing this.\n \u201cYou really saw it.\u201d He sounded puzzled.\n Su Mian chuckled. \u201cWhy? Ae you afraid?\u201d He said mockingly, \u201cMu Mian, if the Du Family, especially your beloved Mrs. Mu, finds out that you\u2019ve been involved with another woman for so many years and even killed someone... What do you think the Du Family will do to you? What will your wife think of you?\u201d\n It was these words that had caused the death of the Su couple.\n Mu Mian managed to keep his cool over the phone. \u201cYou can try.\u201d\n Su Buwang kept silent for a moment before sighing. \u201cMu Mian, you are so ruthless.\u201d\n \u201cHa...\u201d\n The conversation ended there.\n Mu Mian had obviously saved this recording for himself.\n At that time, the two of them had differing opinions about the future development of \u201cHappy\u201d shopping website. With that, their collaborative relationship started to deteriorate.\n At that point, the employees in the company were divided into two factions.\n Su Buwang wanted to chase Mu Mian away, but Mu Mian also wanted to chase him away so that he could be in charge of the company. Su Buwang\u2019s threat completely cut off all ties between him and Mu Mian.\n Killing intent rose in Mu Mian.\n The cause of Su Buwang\u2019s death was drowning after being hit by a car. In this incident, Mu Mian had removed all his suspicions. As a result, no one suspected Mu Mian.\n And that internal strife ended with Su Buwang\u2019s death.\n After hearing this conversation, Su Beibei felt uneasy. Song Ci could tell that she was not in a good state and said, \u201cGo sit aside. I will look at the next document.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Su Beibei sat aside, wanting to smoke.\n She opened the drawer, took out a cigarette, and tore open the packaging. She bit into it and was about to light up with her lighter, when she suddenly thought of Li Li.\n Damn, I promised Li Li to quit smoking.\n Su Beibei tossed the cigarette back into the drawer, got up, went to the fridge outside, and found an of old popsicles. In autumn, she stuffed a popsicle into her mouth and calmed down.\n Song Ci opened the third document and saw that it was a video. \u201cBeibei, this looks like a video taken by a car recorder!\u201d\n Hearing this, Su Beibei stood up with an old popsicle in her mouth and walked behind Song Ci. \u201cOpen it.\u201d She placed her chin on top of Song Ci\u2019s head and watched the video with her.\n Song Ci opened the video and the two of them watched it together.\n The camera captured the road conditions in front of the car. At night, the car drove very steadily. No one could be seen in the video, but the conversation between a man and a woman could be heard \u2014\n Su Buwang said, \u201cThis Mu Mian is getting more and more capable. He actually said that he wanted to make people loan for free from Green Tree.\u201d\n Mrs. Su asked, \u201cWhat is a free loan from Green Tree?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a form of loaning money. All users who use \u2018Happy\u2019 shopping website will be verified by their real names. Every month, they will be able to borrow some money from \u2018Happy\u2019 in advance to buy its products. By next month, the user will automatically repay the loan. If not, we will collect interest.\u201d\n Song Ci thought to herself: Isn\u2019t this a certain system now?\n Although Mu Mian was a bit of a scumbag and ruthless, he did have a brain for business. He was indeed a genius to be able to think of such a violent way to make money in that era.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that good?\u201d Mrs. Su said, \u201cPurchasing is also a desire. This kind of free loan can stimulate the purchasing desire of users, especially female users.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing bad about it originally.\u201d Su Buwang\u2019s tone was slightly unhappy. He pointed out. \u201cOnce this decision is approved, Mu Mian\u2019s prestige in the company will far exceed mine. I will become the second shareholder sooner or later.\u201d\n Even though they were both founders of Pleasure City, Su Buwang was unwilling to be inferior.\n But Mother Su was very open-minded. \u201cHubby, we only wanted a single candy at the start, but now we have a pack. But you are unhappy again and want a candy house. Everyone is greedy, but we should learn to be content.\u201d\n \u201cI feel that Mu Mian\u2019s decision is good for the company. As one of the company\u2019s major shareholders, you will also enjoy benefits. If we think of it this way, won\u2019t we be less angry?\u201d\n \u201cYou sure are open-minded.\u201d After a moment of silence in the car, Su Buwang suddenly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you feeling unwell or sleepy?\u201d\n Confused, Mrs. Su said, \u201cI took an afternoon nap. It\u2019s only 9pm. Why am I sleepy? But it\u2019s so strange. I feel so tired that I can\u2019t even open my eyes...\u201d With that, Mrs. Su\u2019s voice trailed off.\n Seeing that his wife had fallen asleep while talking, Su Buwang felt that something was off. \u201cWifey, did you catch a cold?\u201d\n No one answered.\n After a while, Su Buwang suddenly scolded. \u201cMu Mian, you are despicable. You actually drugged us!\u201d In a moment of desperation, Su Buwang wanted to stop the car but he fainted.\n In the camera, the car started to deviate from the original lane.\n Bang!\n There was a crash and the camera shook. The car fell into the Great Dragon River.\n The surveillance camera on the dash recorder sank into the river along with the car. The water enveloped the car and the people inside were slowly swallowed up by the water until they died...\n The camera was like a heartless killer silently recording this scene.\n Song Ci hurriedly turned off the video and turned to look at Su Beibei.\n Su Beibei\u2019s reaction was calmer than she had expected, but her face was slightly pale. Seeing Song Ci looking at her worriedly, Su Beibei forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But her heart was beating very quickly and her legs were slightly jelly.\n After Su Beibei recovered, Song Ci saved the USB flash drive, retrieved Mu Mian\u2019s USB, and handed it to Su Beibei. \u201cYou go and hand it to Captain Lin.\u201d\n Su Beibei held the USB stick and hesitated. \u201cIn these recordings and videos, Mu Mian only admitted that he killed Xu Xiangxiang but we can\u2019t confirm that he really harmed my parents.\u201d\n Everything was just Su Buwang\u2019s guess. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not enough to completely destroy him.\u201d\n \u201cWait.\u201d\n Song Ci called Han Zhan.\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s phone ring, Li Li and the rest stopped talking tacitly. Han Zhan nodded at them, took his phone, walked outside, and answered it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Baby Ci?\u201d\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cThat Zhu Yuanwen, what is his relationship with Mu Mian?\u201d Someone like Mu Mian was very thoughtful. If he wanted to find a partner, he would definitely look for someone who knew everything.\n Mu Mian must have something on Zhu Yuanwen.\n \u201cZhu Yuanwen?\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci everything he knew. \u201cZhu Yuanwen and Mu Mian are both from Haicheng City. They graduated from the same place. In university, Zhu Yuanwen studied medicine, while Mu Mian studied computer science.\u201d\n \u201cIn university, Zhu Yuanwen caused a classmate of his to die in a car accident, due to his carelessness. Coincidentally, Mu Mian, who came to hang with him, saw that scene. Mu Mian has something on Zhu Yuanwen, so he naturally has to obey his orders.\u201d\n Han Zhan had investigated for a long time before finding out all of this. After that, he had Long Yu threaten Zhu Yuanwen. That Zhu Yuanwen was a timid person and admitted everything after being scared by Long Yu.\n \u201cBrother Han, let me ask you. You said that Mu Mian wanted to kill someone. Is Zhu Yuanwen his most trusted partner?\u201d It was very easy for a doctor to kill someone.\n Han Zhan heard Song Ci\u2019s hint and couldn\u2019t help asking suspiciously, \u201cWhat are you and Su Beibei doing?\u201d These two people must be up to no good behind my back.\n Song Ci told Han Zhan, \u201cWe found evidence of Mu Mian murdering Xu Xiangxiang back then, as well as some clues to accuse Mu Mian of murdering Su Beibei\u2019s parents. We just need to investigate further. You go to work, Beibei and I are going to solve the case.\u201d\n After hanging up, Song Ci pulled Su Beibei up and took the USB flash drive. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the police station.\u201d\n After being hung up, Han Zhan was somewhat distracted. He returned to the office and glanced at Li Li, who didn\u2019t know anything. He asked him unhappily, \u201cDo you know what Su Beibei is doing?\u201d\n Li Li was stunned for a moment before saying, \u201cWriting a novel. Her novel is almost done. We won\u2019t be able to meet for the next two days.\u201d\n Han Zhan snorted.\n What novel? She\u2019s busy catching bad guys behind your back.\n \u2013\n Only when Song Ci and the rest arrived at the police station did they know that Zhu Yuanwen and Mu Mian had already been brought to the detention center. The two of them then drove to the detention center.\n It was a fact that Zhu Yuanwen had committed a crime. For now, he couldn\u2019t meet his family or friends. He could only meet his lawyer.\n Song Ci had no choice but to call her grandfather and have him open a back door for her. After obtaining permission, Song Ci brought Su Beibei into the detention center.\n Zhu Yuanwen was brought to the interrogation room. He had expected to see the interrogator, but instead saw two beautiful young ladies.\n Zhu Yuanwen narrowed his eyes at the sight of Song Ci.\n Song Ci stared at Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s face. Her heart thumped so hard that it nearly jumped out of her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Song Ci recognized Zhu Yuanwen. In her previous life, the last person she saw before she died was this Zhu Yuanwen.\n At that time, he was standing beside the operating theater, watching her coldly, waiting for her to take her heart the moment she breathed her last.\n Song Ci\u2019s face paled as she suddenly saw the person who killed her in her previous life. A layer of cold sweat covered her back.\n Zhu Yuanwen also knew Song Ci. He said, \u201cYou are quite lucky to have been taken away by someone last time.\u201d Zhu Yuanwen was referring to the time when Song Ci got into a car accident and was forcibly taken away by Han Zhan.\n Song Ci also recalled that incident. She looked at Zhu Yuanwen with a cold, emotionless gaze. \u201cAs a doctor, you turned a knife that was meant to save someone into a knife meant to kill. Head of Department Zhu, if you fall asleep at night, will you also have nightmares?\u201d\n Zhu Yuanwen shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many ruthless people. I\u2019m not afraid of nightmares anymore.\u201d\n \u201cNo wonder you are the head of department. You are so bold.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s tone was full of mockery.\n Su Beibei couldn\u2019t be bothered to listen to their sarcastic conversation.\n She grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and shook her head.\n Song Ci understood Su Beibei\u2019s hint. She quickly shut up and pretended to be dumb.\n Su Beibei stared at Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s slightly plump face and suddenly said, \u201cIn university, your mistake caused a classmate to die in a car accident. It\u2019s the greatest regret of your life.\u201d\n Noticing that Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s pupils suddenly quivered at her words, Su Beibei quietly inched closer to him.\n Staring fixedly at Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s uneasy eyes, Su Beibei said, \u201cI can\u2019t help thinking that if I hadn\u2019t accidentally killed him back then, I wouldn\u2019t have been threatened by that bastard Mu Mian time and time again. As for me, I will become a respected specialist in cardiovascular surgery. I will receive honor, glory, and respect.\u201d\n \u201cIf only that incident didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n After saying that, Su Beibei shut her mouth and observed Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s reaction. Multiple emotions flashed across his face: regret and hatred, regret and guilt.\n Song Ci secretly gave Su Beibei a big thumbs-up. It was still up to a dark girl like Su Beibei to play mind games.\n Zhu Yuanwen raised his hands and wiped his face vigorously. He narrowed his eyes and stared at Su Beibei\u2019s cold, beautiful face.\n His lips quivered several times before he asked hoarsely, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n Su Beibei took out her parents\u2019 photo and placed it in front of Zhu Yuanwen. He looked down and remained silent.\n Su Beibei tried to intimidate Zhu Yuanwen. \u201c14 years ago, you were threatened by Mu Mian and secretly drugged a couple\u2019s tea. As a result, they fell into a coma while driving. Apart from the car accident, both husband and wife fell into the Great Dragon River and drowned to death.\u201d\n The muscles on Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s face quivered slightly. He looked at Su Beibei and compared her age to that of the couple\u2019s child. His expression instantly changed.\n \u201cYou are that little girl?\u201d\n Zhu Yuanwen had met Su Beibei before.\n It was Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s first time killing someone. He felt very guilty and couldn\u2019t fall asleep the entire night. The next day, before dawn, he went to the side of the Imperial Dragon Bridge and hid in the dark to watch the progress of the salvation team.\n Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s legs went limp when he saw the rescue team scoop up the bodies of the Su Family couple. He nearly collapsed to the ground.\n It was drizzling that day when an old lady appeared beside the bodies of Su Shang and his wife, carrying a little girl in her arms. The little girl knelt between the two bodies, sobbing heartbreakingly.\n Zhu Yuanwen didn\u2019t have many nightmares in his life, but he often dreamed of that crying little girl. In his dreams, he was always chased by that little girl: Uncle, uncle, why did you kill my parents? Can you return them to me?\n Seeing the little girl who had haunted him for so many years in his dreams, the final wall in Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s heart finally collapsed.\n He lowered his head, took a deep breath, and said guiltily, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I really didn\u2019t want to kill them. But I had no choice. Mu Mian used my future to threaten me. If I didn\u2019t help him, he would have reported me.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, my child was just born. If I were to go to jail, what would happen to my child and my wife?!\u201d Zhu Yuanwen cried bitterly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill anyone, but I also wanted to lead a good life!\u201d\n Su Beibei and Song Ci looked at Zhu Yuanwen coldly. They didn\u2019t pity him, nor did they feel sorry for him. It was all his own choice. He deserved it and didn\u2019t deserve any pity.\n \u201cI\u2019ve kept the recording. It\u2019s done,\u201d Song Ci said.\n Su Beibei turned off the recorder and pulled Song Ci up by the arm. Zhu Yuanwen was still crying and apologizing profusely.\n Su Beibei stared at Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s slightly plump body and said expressionlessly, \u201cYour apology won\u2019t save my parents\u2019 lives. Stop crying. It\u2019s so fake and nauseating.\u201d\n The two of them left the interrogation room. When they came out, they bumped into Captain Lin, who was there to interrogate the suspect. Song Ci knew that Captain Lin was someone she could trust, so she handed the recorder and USB to him.\n Captain Lin took them and asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat is this, Miss Song?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cWe want to make a police report. We want to report that Mu Mian is involved in two murder cases. For the Su Family couple who passed away 14 years ago, as well as for the woman who committed suicide 18 years ago, Xu Xiangxiang. I hope you will clear their grievances!\u201d\n Captain Lin narrowed his eyes. \u201cGot it.\u201d\n \u2013\n For the sake of Mu Mian, Du Tingting had been running around trying to find connections to reduce his sentence.\n However, everyone who had a close relationship with them all shook their heads and sighed. \u201cSister-in-law, we can\u2019t interfere in this matter. You don\u2019t know how many eyes are on this matter now. This matter has already attracted the attention of the entire nation. If Brother Mu\u2019s sentence is light, it will cause social discontent.\u201d\n Of course Du Tingting knew this, but she couldn\u2019t just stand by and watch her husband go to jail. Mu Mian was no longer young. After a few years in prison, he would turn old.\n If he were to really go to jail, he might not even get to see Mu Qiu one last time.\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart ached at the thought of this.\n Du Tingting\u2019s search was fruitless. She just wanted to meet Mu Mian, but he was a severe criminal and was detained by the police at the detention center. Du Tingting had no right to visit him.\n She could only find out about Mu Mian\u2019s situation through a lawyer. As a result, Du Tingting had specially hired a top-grade lawyer.\n No lawyer was willing to take over her case.\n Few lawyers were willing to defend the very guilty party.\n Subsequently, Du Tingting increased the offer to hire a top lawyer to five million yuan. Only then was a top lawyer willing to take on this case. Today was the day that the lawyer went to see Mu Mian. After Du Tingting found out, she also went to the detention center after Mu Qiu fell asleep.\n Arriving at the detention center, the police indeed didn\u2019t allow Du Tingting to visit.\n Du Tingting could only wait in the main hall of the detention center. She waited for a long time before the lawyer came out. When the lawyer came out, his face was very grim.\n Du Tingting hurriedly stood up and asked the lawyer, \u201cLawyer Jin, how is it? How is my husband? What did you say?\u201d\n Jin Yun snapped at Du Tingting. \u201cI\u2019m not taking this case anymore!\u201d\n Du Tingting was shocked. \u201cWhy? Lawyer Jin, you accepted my money. Why aren\u2019t you taking this case?\u201d\n In her panic, Du Tingting opened her own bag and took out a bank card from her wallet. \u201cAre you complaining that you don\u2019t have enough money? I have more here. I can add more money!\u201d\n Du Tingting was so anxious that she was about to cry. She shoved the card into Lawyer Jin\u2019s hands. \u201cI still have two million yuan in my card. Lawyer Jin, you must help my husband, alright?\u201d\n Lawyer Jin pushed the card back without any hesitation.\n Lawyer Jin\u2019s tough stance made Du Tingting realize that something must have happened. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be so determined. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n Seeing that Du Tingting didn\u2019t know anything, Mr. Jin sighed deeply and stuffed the card back into her bag. He then told her, \u201cMrs. Mu, you don\u2019t know what your husband has done.\u201d\n Du Tingting was shocked. Could it be that Mu Mian had committed some heinous crime behind my back?\n Du Tingting tried her best to maintain her composure. She asked Lawyer Jin, \u201cWhat exactly did Mu Mian do?!\u201d\n Lawyer Jin shook his head and said, \u201cHe\u2019s so vicious, so vicious. You don\u2019t know that he has three lives on his back!\u201d\n \u201cYour husband killed someone 18 years ago. He murdered his first love who was in a relationship with him since high school! Not only that, he also murdered your old friend Su Buwang and his wife!\u201d\n \u201cTell me, which lawyer would be willing to defend such a ruthless person like your husband? A human will never go against his conscience to reduce your husband\u2019s sentence!\u201d\n Regardless of how much Jin Yun loved money, he didn\u2019t dare to take it. He was afraid that he would never be able to eat or sleep in peace again in this life. With that, Jin Yun hurried out of the detention center.\n Du Tingting\u2019s mind started buzzing as she suddenly heard this shocking truth. A golden glow appeared in front of her eyes as everything before her started to turn upside down.\n Bang!\n Du Tingting collapsed on the concrete floor at the entrance of the detention center as her lips twitched.\n \u201cSomeone fainted!\u201d\n \u201cCall an ambulance!\u201d\n Mu Mian heard the ruckus downstairs but didn\u2019t take it to heart. Only after a long while did he hear the sound of an ambulance arriving. After the ruckus, peace was restored outside.\n At this moment, Captain Lin walked over and stood in the corridor outside the door with his arms crossed. He stared at Mu Mian through the gap in the metal fence. Mu Mian looked so calm and composed that it seemed like nothing had happened. Captain Lin felt very sad.\n \u201cDo you know what happened downstairs just now?\u201d Captain Lin asked.\n Mu Mian stared at him and snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business.\u201d\n Captain Lin said, \u201cJust now, a lady fainted from a cerebral hemorrhage downstairs. She was dragged away by the ambulance and lost consciousness. She came with Lawyer Jin.\u201d Lawyer Jin was hired by Du Tingting for Mu Mian.\n Who would follow Lawyer Jin to the police station?\n The answer was self-evident.\n The previously calm Mu Mian suddenly stood up.\n Reaching the door of the detention room, Mu Mian gripped the metal railing and asked Captain Lin anxiously, \u201cHow is she now? Have you sent her to the hospital? She will die from cerebral hemorrhage!\u201d\n Only at this moment, looking at Mu Mian, who was so worried about Du Tingting, did Captain Lin feel like he was a human.\n \u201cAn acute cerebral hemorrhage is indeed fatal. Mu Mian, she had a stroke after hearing what you did.\u201d\n Staring at the suddenly quiet Mu Mian, the corners of Captain Lin\u2019s lips curled up coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Mu Mian. You harmed her.\u201d\n Mu Mian staggered back to the wall and sat down on the metal bed. He remained silent like a deflated balloon.\n As Captain Lin turned to leave, he suddenly heard Mu Mian say, \u201cI confess.\u201d\n Captain Lin halted.\n He shot his subordinates a look and the two of them dragged Mu Mian into the interrogation room.\n Inside the interrogation room, Mu Mian\u2019s first words were, \u201cI am willing to confess my crime, but I hope that you can let me meet my wife.\u201d\n This was Mu Mian\u2019s only request.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "188": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-189\n\n Chapter 188:  There Will be Retribution After All the Bad Things You Have Done\n Hearing Mu Mian\u2019s request, the two subordinates instinctively looked at Captain Lin.\n Captain Lin didn\u2019t agree to Mu Mian\u2019s request. \u201cIt depends on how cooperative you are.\u201d\n Mu Mian nodded and sat quietly in his chair. The handcuffs didn\u2019t affect his poise at all.\n Only then did Captain Lin seriously scrutinize Mu Mian.\n Mu Mian had a handsome and gentle look. Even though he was in his mid-forties, he still looked very young and calm. He was wearing the clothes that Du Tingting had asked someone to send over, which was a clean sweater and long pants. He was also wearing a vest that was given out by the detention center. He sat there quietly, giving off the wrong impression of benevolence.\n But such a person carried so many murder cases.\n Captain Lin, who was used to all sorts of criminal cases, once again thought of that saying when he saw Mu Mian in this state: one cannot judge a book by its cover.\n \u201cSuspect Mu Mian, are you going to confess to the attempted murder of Ms. Song Fei, of kidnapping Ms. Song across countries, of stealing her heart to save your own daughter?\u201d Captain Lin was in charge of the interrogation, while the recorder waited quietly for Mu Mian\u2019s reply.\n Mu Mian\u2019s eyelids drooped. He didn\u2019t have any strong reaction. He just replied coldly, \u201cI admit it.\u201d\n \u201cConfess your crime and motive.\u201d\n Like a storyteller, Mu Mian narrated the entire incident calmly and methodically. \u201cFrom the day Song Fei set off for Golden Sands, I had the thought of taking advantage of the chaos there to create the illusion that she was dead and secretly bringing her back to the country.\u201d\n \u201cThe real reason why I did this was because of my lover\u2019s miscarriage. My lover was depressed after the miscarriage, and I was afraid that after our only daughter passed away from a heart attack, she would also collapse. So, I decided to take the risk...\u201d\n Mu Mian narrated the crime expressionlessly. Captain Lin and the other two men frowned. \u201cSo you admit that you used money to extort Zhu Yuanwen, as well as Chen Kang, Huang Qianqian, and the rest to commit the crime together with you?\u201d\n After a moment of silence, Mu Mian nodded. \u201cI admit it.\u201d\n Captain Lin nodded and changed the topic. \u201c18 years ago, your friend, Xu Xiangxiang, jumped down from Dieyi Building in our city. Back then, her death was judged as suicide by jumping off a building. But recently, someone reported that Xu Xiangxiang didn\u2019t commit suicide by jumping off a building. Instead, because she was emotionally involved with you, you purposely pushed her down the building and she died.\u201d\n \u201cSuspect Mu Mian, do you admit to intentionally killing Xu Xiangxiang?\u201d\n Hearing the name Xu Xiangxiang, a slender figure surfaced in Mu Mian\u2019s mind, but he actually couldn\u2019t remember how she looked like.\n He was quite capable to dig up such old news.\n Mu Mian shook his head slightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d After answering, Mu Mian asked Captain Lin, \u201cWho reported the case? They made up a lie and are trying to frame me.\u201d He seemed rather indignant as he portrayed himself as an innocent victim.\n \u201cYou won\u2019t shed a tear until you see the coffin.\u201d Captain Lin sneered. He reached into his pocket and took out a sealed envelope containing a black USB drive.\n Pushing the USB drive in front of Mu Mian, Captain Lin knocked on the table. \u201cLook, doesn\u2019t this USB drive look very familiar?\u201d\n From the moment Captain Lin took out the USB drive, Mu Mian\u2019s calm expression disappeared. His brown eyes narrowed into two tiny dots.\n Staring at the USB drive, Mu Mian suddenly lost the ability to speak.\n Captain Lin asked again, \u201cSuspect Mu Mian, do you plead guilty to murdering Xu Xiangxiang?\u201d\n Mu Mian straightened his neck and stared at Captain Lin for a long while, before finally giving in and nodding. He said in a hoarse voice, \u201cI admit it.\u201d The USB flash drive contained the voice recordings of his conversation with Su Buwang. In the recordings, he had admitted to murdering Xu Xiang. There was no point in trying to argue.\n \u201cWhat is your motive?\u201d\n As if he was talking about an old friend whom he had not seen for many years, Mu Mian said calmly, \u201cShe is my first love. We have been together since high school. She didn\u2019t manage to get into a good university during the college entrance examination and quit school to work at a factory to become a clerk.\u201d\n \u201cAlthough we were separated, we didn\u2019t break up and maintained a long-distance relationship. At that time, phone calls weren\u2019t popular and phone fees were expensive. She and I relied on letters to contact each other.\u201d\n \u201cAfter that, when I was in my second year of university, I met my current lover. Only when I met my current lover did I understand what love is. Although I knew that it was wrong to be two-timing, I still couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with my wife.\u201d\n \u201cAfter graduating from university, I married my wife and had our daughter not long after. During this period, I kept my lover\u2019s existence from Xu Xiangxiang, as well as my wife\u2019s existence from her.\u201d\n Captain Lin frowned and asked Mu Mian, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you break up with Xu Xiangxiang? After so many years, you could\u2019ve always found the right opportunity.\u201d\n Mu Mian looked distressed. He said regretfully, \u201cXu Xiangxiang suffered a lot because of me. She is the kind of person who will spend 99 yuan on me if she had 100 yuan. She is very devoted to me. I...\u201d\n Mu Mian was slightly troubled. He murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to tell her about our breakup, so I kept dragging it out.\u201d\n \u201cSo you are nostalgic!\u201d Captain Lin felt it was ridiculous and mocked him. \u201cA person like you actually has moments of nostalgia.\u201d\n Mu Mian didn\u2019t retort.\n \u201cSince you are so nostalgic, how could you bear to kill her?\u201d In Captain Lin\u2019s eyes, Mu Mian was no good. If you don\u2019t love such a good girl, please don\u2019t hurt her.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to kill her at first. I wanted to compensate her for her loss of youth.\u201d At that time, Mu Mian thought that although he had never touched Xu Xiangxiang\u2019s body, he had also wasted a few years of her youth. He planned to compensate Xu Xiang with 100,000 yuan.\n However, Xu Xiangxiang disagreed.\n \u201cShe threatened to destroy my family.\u201d There was no warmth in Mu Mian\u2019s eyes. He said, \u201cI want to protect my family and my love. So, she can only die.\u201d\n With a brief description, Mu Mian determined Xu Xiangxiang\u2019s life and death.\n Captain Lin didn\u2019t see any hint of guilt on Mu Mian\u2019s face. He knew that this was a truly ruthless person.\n \u201cLet me ask you again. Are you going to plead guilty to threatening Zhu Yuanwen, instigating him to drug the Su Family\u2019s tea, causing them to lose consciousness while driving, resulting in them falling into the Great Dragon River in a car accident, and both drowning?\u201d\n After hearing Captain Lin accurately point out Zhu Yuanwen\u2019s role in the case, Mu Mian knew that they had investigated everything thoroughly.\n Mu Mian nodded expressionlessly. \u201cI admit.\u201d\n \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s reply nearly made Captain Lin fly into a rage. He said \u2014\n \u201cHe kept going against me and even used the death of Xu Xiangxiang to threaten me. I was unhappy and annoyed at him, so I killed him.\u201d\n What an infuriating answer!\n Two lives were lost just like that!\n Captain Lin was no longer willing to chat with someone like Mu Mian. He had already collected the necessary evidence and statement. He stood up and turned to leave.\n Captain Lin was about to leave.\n At this point, Mu Mian suddenly hit the table with both hands and asked urgently, \u201cYou promised to let me meet my wife! You can\u2019t go back on your word!\u201d\n Hearing this, Captain Lin stopped in his tracks.\n He turned half his head and saw Mu Mian\u2019s enraged expression from the corner of his eye. He smirked mockingly. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before. It depends on your performance, but I\u2019m very dissatisfied with your performance.\u201d\n Mu Mian was so angry that the veins on his neck were popping. \u201cYou lied to me!\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you.\u201d Captain Lin turned around completely. He looked at the exasperated Mu Mian and suddenly said, \u201cYou have failed Xu Xiangxiang and murdered Su Mao and his wife. You have committed all sorts of evil deeds. Do you really think that the heavens will not punish you?\u201d\n With a signal from Captain Lin, the people in the surveillance room turned off the surveillance cameras and listening devices.\n Captain Lin walked up to Mu Mian and smiled mockingly. \u201cYour daughter has been tormented by a disease at such a young age. Your wife is critically ill and can\u2019t even meet you. This is the retribution from the heavens.\u201d\n Isn\u2019t he deeply in love with his wife?\n Then Heaven would make sure he never got to see his wife for the last time!\n Isn\u2019t he trying to protect his family?\n Then God would make his daughter suffer from all sorts of illnesses!\n \u201cMu Mian, one will receive retribution for committing all sorts of evil deeds.\u201d Actually, in the field of police work, Captain Lin had seen too many examples of people committing all sorts of evil deeds, but still getting away scot-free and leading a good life.\n But Captain Lin still firmly believed that a person who committed evil deeds would never end well.\n After Captain Lin left, the two subordinates sent Mu Mian back to the detainment room. Mu Mian sat on the metal bed despondently as Captain Lin\u2019s words kept replaying in his mind.\n Is this really retribution?\n Mu Mian could only pray that Du Tingting could survive this ordeal.\n \u2013\n In the afternoon, Du Tingting suddenly fainted after a cerebral hemorrhage.\n The First Ward was located at the south end of the East Mountain District. It was 30 minutes away from the Third People\u2019s Hospital.\n As they waited for the ambulance to arrive, Du Tingting\u2019s mouth started spewing out vomit. It was a terrible sight.\n A police officer saw that the condition was serious and hurriedly called the doctor over. By the time the doctor arrived, Du Tingting had already stopped vomiting. If one listened closely, one could hear her snoring.\n The doctor could tell that Du Tingting was suffering from cerebral hemorrhage. \u201cQuick, lie her down on her side and open her mouth for me!\u201d\n The policeman opened Du Tingting\u2019s lips and saw her tongue lolling out. She was obviously suffocating.\n The doctor immediately used a handkerchief to remove the foreign object from Du Tingting\u2019s mouth. Seeing that she couldn\u2019t breathe, he hesitated for a moment before lowering his head and pressing his lips against hers to resuscitate her.\n The police officers all had different expressions as they watched this scene. They all admired the doctor.\n That was a patient who had just vomited.\n At least Du Tingting could breathe normally now.\n Only when the ambulance arrived did the doctor heave a sigh of relief. \u201cThe patient suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and vomited profusely. She also suffered from suffocation during the fall of her tongue. You must send her to the hospital as soon as possible.\u201d\n \u201cAlright!\u201d\n It was already 25 minutes later when Du Tingting was sent to the hospital. She was immediately pushed into the emergency room for a CT scan to confirm that she had a cerebral hemorrhage on her left side of the brain.\n As her condition was temporarily under control, the attending doctor decided to send her to the ward for observation first. She had to get the approval of the patient\u2019s family, before deciding whether to perform the surgery or to let her stay in the hospital for observation.\n After pushing Du Tingting into the ward, the attending doctor found the ambulance attendant and asked her about her identity.\n The female doctor told the attending doctor, \u201cWe went to fetch her from the First Detention Centre. We have just contacted the Detention Centre. They told me that the patient\u2019s name is Du Tingting and her husband is the chairman of Chao Yang Company, Mu Mian. He had been arrested for murder. Currently, the only family member we can contact is Du Tingting\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n \u201cThen contact her daughter as soon as possible.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u2013\n Mu Qiu woke up and realized that Du Tingting was not in the ward. She called Du Tingting but no one answered.\n After locating the nurse, Mu Qiu inquired about Du Tingting\u2019s whereabouts. The nurse told Mu Qiu, \u201cMadam Mu left the hospital at 1pm. She told us that she will be back around 5pm, but we\u2019re not sure where she went.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d\n Mu Qiu returned to her room alone and sat quietly by the bed.\n After waking up from her illness, she found out that Mu Mian\u2019s plan had failed and that he had been taken away by the police. As a result, Mu Qiu logged out of all chat apps.\n She held her own cell phone but didn\u2019t have the courage to open WeChat. Mu Qiu was afraid of seeing those old friends gossiping about the Mu Family, afraid of seeing them scold her father for being worse than a beast, and even more afraid of facing Cheng Yanmo.\n What will Brother Mo think of my family now that he knew what my father had done?\n She had completely turned into a cowardly turtle.\n After much hesitation, Mu Qiu opened the app and logged in. To her surprise, Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t send her a single message.\n Is he overseas on a work trip and didn\u2019t know what had happened to the Mu Family?\n Or...\n Or is it that after knowing about the Mu Family, he had completely lost all fondness for them and wanted to cut all ties with me?\n Mu Qiu bit down on her lower lip at the thought of this possibility.\n Beep beep.\n Beep beep.\n Her cell phone suddenly vibrated.\n Mu Qiu looked down in surprise and saw an unfamiliar number. She hesitated for a moment before finally answering the call.\n \u201c...Hi,\u201d Mu Qiu said hesitantly, thinking it was a marketing call.\n The other party asked, \u201cHi, is this Madam Du Tingting\u2019s daughter, Ms. Mu Qiu?\u201d\n Hearing her mother\u2019s name, Mu Qiu had a bad feeling. She frowned slightly and answered uneasily, \u201cI am Mu Qiu. May I know who you are?\u201d\n \u201cHi, this is Wangdong Third People\u2019s Hospital. Your mother suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage this afternoon and is currently being held at the hospital for observation. Is it convenient for you to come over now? The doctor has to discuss with you about your mother\u2019s condition...\u201d\n Hearing this grievous news, Mu Qiu\u2019s mind was in a mess. She changed clothes as quickly as she could and hailed a cab to the Third People\u2019s Hospital.\n The Third People\u2019s Hospital was on the south side of Wangdong City. Newbridge Hospital was on the north side of Wangdong City, close to Wangjiang City Airport. The entire Wangdong City was between the two hospitals.\n It was already dark by the time Mu Qiu arrived at the Third People\u2019s Hospital.\n Panic-stricken, she ran to the floor of the Neurology Department and asked the nurse about Du Tingting\u2019s ward. Only then did she find her bed.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s legs went limp when she saw Du Tingting\u2019s lips twitching on the bed.\n \u201cMother!\u201d\n Mu Qiu held onto the railing of Du Tingting\u2019s bed and knelt down. \u201cMother, can you hear me?\u201d Mu Qiu knelt down and grabbed Du Tingting\u2019s hand. Du Tingting was having a fever and her hand was very hot.\n Mu Qiu felt terrified.\n After confirming that Du Tingting couldn\u2019t hear her, Mu Qiu finally remembered to look for the doctor.\n She wiped her tears and went to look for the doctor. The doctor saw that she was very thin and her face was also very pale. Worried that she might collapse at any moment, he asked worriedly, \u201cMiss Mu, are you alright?\u201d\n The news that the head of the Cardiovascular Department of Newbridge Hospital, Zhu Yuanwen, and the chairman of Newbridge Hospital, Mu Mian, had done something to the virus specialist Song Fei had already spread throughout the country.\n As the head of the Neurology Department of the Third People\u2019s Hospital, Director Zhang naturally knew. Knowing that this lady in front of him had heart disease, Director Zhang was worried that she might collapse at any time.\n Mu Qiu shook her head. \u201cI am fine.\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s heart clenched tightly. She sat down on the empty chair beside the doctor and asked him anxiously about Du Tingting\u2019s condition. \u201cDoctor, how is my mother\u2019s condition? Can it be controlled? Can she be cured?\u201d\n \u201cYour mother\u2019s left cerebral hemorrhage is rather serious. My suggestion is to arrange for a surgery as soon as possible to prevent her cerebral hemorrhage from continuing. If there is another hemorrhage and the situation is uncontrollable, your mother is very likely to...\u201d\n The doctor shot Mu Qiu a meaningful look.\n Mu Qiu panicked.\n \u201cWill she die?\u201d\n The doctor nodded.\n Mu Qiu grabbed the doctor\u2019s hand and knelt down. \u201cDoctor, you must treat my mother. She... she didn\u2019t do anything bad. She must live a long, healthy life!\u201d\n Hearing Mu Qiu\u2019s words, Head of Department Zhang also sighed at Du Tingting\u2019s plight. It was obviously her husband\u2019s fault, but retribution had befallen her. \u201cMiss Mu, your mother suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and is in critical condition. You should consider whether she should undergo surgery or receive conservative treatment.\u201d\n Worried that Mu Qiu would not realize the severity of the problem, Head of Department Zhang added. \u201cConservative treatment might not be effective, and the surgery might not succeed. It will also have side effects.\u201d\n \u201cI... I will consider it.\u201d\n Mu Qiu used her cell phone to search for information regarding the aftereffects of the cerebral hemorrhage surgery. After reading the information online, Mu Qiu finally realized how serious her mother\u2019s condition was.\n She couldn\u2019t make up her mind but couldn\u2019t contact Mu Mian either. She was so anxious that she didn\u2019t know what to do. In the past, she could still call Song Ci to discuss but now, she didn\u2019t dare to call her!\n Mu Qiu leaned against the wall. Once again, she deeply experienced the feeling of helplessness.\n The doctor packed up his things and was about to knock off when he walked out of the office and saw Mu Qiu standing at the door. \u201cMiss Mu.\u201d The doctor stopped and looked at Mu Qiu gently, waiting for her to speak first.\n \u201cDoctor.\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s fingers tugged at the corners of her shirt. Her anxious manner was heart-wrenching. \u201cDoctor, I agree to the surgery for my mother.\u201d\n Even if Du Tingting was paralyzed and unable to speak after the surgery, at least she would still be alive.\n The doctor patted her shoulder and said, \u201cAlright then, come in with me to sign the surgery consent form.\u201d\n Mu Qiu signed the consent form before returning to the ward to accompany Du Tingting. She waited until 11pm, and the fatigued Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t help dozing off.\n After sleeping for some time, Mu Qiu suddenly heard a sound. She looked up and saw Du Tingting\u2019s lips twitching violently. Shortly after, she started convulsing.\n Mu Qiu was terrified.\n \u201cMother!\u201d\n \u201cMother!\u201d\n Mu Qiu pressed the button to call for help. She didn\u2019t know if the nurse didn\u2019t hear her or was busy, but she didn\u2019t pick up. Mu Qiu hurriedly ran out of the ward and stood in the corridor shouting at the nurse\u2019s desk. \u201cNurse, come and see what happened to my mother!\u201d\n The nurse and the doctor on night duty hurried over. Seeing that Du Tingting was twitching all over, they hurriedly pushed her into the emergency room.\n As he walked, the doctor said, \u201cSuspected of another intracranial hemorrhage. Prepare for a brain CT scan!\u201d\n \u201cInform Head of Department Zhang that the patient might need surgery!\u201d\n \u201cGo to the blood bank to get RH-negative blood!\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d\n Mu Qiu jogged behind them and arrived at the emergency room. The nurse shut the door and Mu Qiu was stopped outside. She waited for a while and saw the nurse running over with two to three blood bags.\n After another 10 minutes, Head of Department Zhang hurried over. Mu Qiu quickly stood up and knelt down before him.\n \u201cDoctor Zhang, you must save my mother! I beg you!\u201d\n Director Zhang calmly took Mu Qiu\u2019s hand and said, \u201cI will do my best. This is my responsibility.\u201d Doctor Zhang entered the operating theater and closed the door. He didn\u2019t open it for a long time.\n Mu Qiu was like a cat on a hot tin roof, as she paced anxiously in front of the operating theater.\n At 3am, the door to the operating theater was finally opened.\n Head of Department Zhang was the first to walk out.\n Mu Qiu was on high alert. She jumped up from her chair when she saw Head of Department Zhang. \u201cDoctor Zhang, my mother...\u201d\n Head of Department Zhang didn\u2019t speak. He took off his face mask and quietly observed Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu was so scared by those profound eyes that she forgot to speak.\n \u201cMiss Mu, I am very sorry. Your mother is suffering from cerebral hemorrhage and the surgery is not effective. She doesn\u2019t have much time left.\u201d\n Mu Qiu staggered two steps back and sat down on the ground. \u201cSurgery is not effective. Time is running out?\u201d Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t believe it.\n Hearing the sound of tires, Mu Qiu looked up and stared at the door of the operating theater. She saw the nurses pushing Du Tingting out of the operating theater. The bed was covered in blood. Du Tingting was lying on the bed with blood dripping from her head and her mouth trembling.\n Mu Qiu knelt down beside Du Tingting. She sobbed as she held Du Tingting\u2019s trembling hands. \u201cMother, I am Qiu-er. Can you hear me?\u201d\n Du Tingting\u2019s pupils quivered as she gazed at Mu Qiu\u2019s face. Her lips quivered as if she had something to say but lost the ability to speak.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s heart felt like it was being stabbed as she cried so hard that her shoulders collapsed.\n \u201cMother, is it very painful? Ah? Don\u2019t be afraid, Qiu-er is here with you!\u201d Mu Qiu cried as she reached out to wipe off the blood on Du Tingting\u2019s head, but she couldn\u2019t wipe it off.\n She panicked and her heart was in turmoil. She laid on Du Tingting\u2019s shoulder and cried bitterly.\n The nurse saw that Mu Qiu was crying so bitterly. Even though she was used to seeing death, she couldn\u2019t bear to see it happen.\n She advised Mu Qiu. \u201cMiss Mu, don\u2019t cry. Your mother doesn\u2019t have much time left. Think about what other family members you have. Call them over. Perhaps they can see your mother one last time.\u201d\n \u201cMy dad...\u201d Mu Qiu suddenly stood up and ran out of the hospital.\n \u2013\n At night, the detention center was completely silent. As they were in the suburbs, they could still hear the buzzing of insects in the grass.\n The policeman sitting in the guardhouse suddenly heard a flurry of footsteps. He looked up in surprise and saw a flustered, thin girl running to the door of the guardhouse.\n That girl ran up to the tall, strict iron door of the detention center and slammed her hands hard on it, making a startling sound in the middle of the night.\n Mu Qiu placed her hand on the metal door and screamed at the top of her lungs. \u201cFather! Father, come out, come out!\u201d\n \u201cFather! Quickly come out. Mother is dying. Come out and meet her for the last time with me, alright?!\u201d\n The police officer on duty snapped out of his trance and hurried over to Mu Qiu\u2019s side to stop her from screaming. \u201cMiss, this is a detention center. You are not allowed to do anything rash!\u201d\n Mu Qiu grabbed the police officer\u2019s hand and knelt down. \u201cPolice uncle! I beg of you, please let my father out and let me bring him to the hospital to see my mother!\u201d\n \u201cMy mother is dying soon. Can you please allow my father to see my mother one last time?\u201d\n During the shift change, the officer on duty had already heard about what happened that afternoon from his colleague. He knew that the wife of a criminal had suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and was admitted to the hospital.\n He asked, \u201cIs your father Mu Mian?\u201d\n Mu Qiu quickly nodded. \u201cYes, my father is Mu Mian.\u201d\n The police officer shook his head. He told Mu Qiu, \u201cMiss, if your father committed any other crimes, the higher-ups might be merciful and allow him to see your mother one last time.\u201d\n \u201cBut your father took so many lives and he\u2019s in the spotlight now. We will never let him go. Go back and accompany your mother.\u201d\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t know that Mu Mian had other murder cases. Hearing this news, Mu Qiu was slightly stunned. \u201cDid you say that my father had murdered other people before?\u201d\n \u201cYes, he has killed three people in the past.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was stunned. \u201cHow could...\u201d My father is such a kind-hearted person. How can he be a murderer?\n In Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes, Mu Mian was a good husband and father who doted on his wife and daughter. The worst thing he did was nearly killing Song Fei!\n How can he be a murderer!\n Seeing that Mu Qiu didn\u2019t believe him, the policeman had to say, \u201cWhy do you think your mother suddenly had a cerebral hemorrhage? She heard about this today and was anxious! Angry!\u201d\n \u201cHow could this be...\u201d Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t believe it was true. But she had never met this police officer before, so there was no need for him to lie to her.\n Her father\u2019s lofty image in Mu Qiu\u2019s heart instantly collapsed!\n he let go of the policeman\u2019s arm and pounded on the door while crying. \u201cMu Mian! Mu Mian, come out! Mother is dying. She is holding her breath and waiting for you to meet her!\u201d\n \u201cFather, come with me to visit her!\u201d\n Many people in the detention center were awoken by Mu Qiu\u2019s screams. No one made a sound. Firstly, the rules forbade them from talking in the middle of the night. Secondly, they wanted to hear some gossip. Thirdly, they felt that this lady was too pitiful.\n After returning to the detainment room from the interrogation room, Mu Mian kept thinking about Du Tingting\u2019s condition and couldn\u2019t fall asleep the entire night. Mu Mian heard Mu Qiu\u2019s first shout.\n He sprang up from the bed, leaned against the fence, and shouted out of the corridor. \u201cLet me out!\u201d\n \u201cMy daughter is outside. Let me out!\u201d\n \u201cCaptain Lin, you promised me that you would let me meet my lover!\u201d\n Captain Lin was a police officer at the police station. Unless it was a criminal, he would never come to the detention center. Captain Lin couldn\u2019t hear Mu Mian\u2019s screams at all.\n The commotion caused by Mu Mian was so great that it woke up the police officers on duty.\n Two police officers walked over and asked Mu Mian angrily, \u201cCriminal Mu Mian, why are you yelling? Don\u2019t you know you can\u2019t make a ruckus during bedtime?\u201d\n Mu Mian hurriedly said to the police officers, \u201cPolice officers, can you be kind and bring me to the hospital? My lover is dying and my daughter is calling for me outside. I must go and see her one last time!\u201d\n \u201cNo way! There\u2019s no such rule! You are not allowed to see your family members or go out before your sentence. You are not allowed to do so under any circumstances!\u201d\n Mu Mian was dumbstruck upon hearing this.\n It was very quiet in the detention center. Mu Qiu\u2019s voice echoed in Mu Mian\u2019s ears from several dozen meters away. Every sound was filled with despair.\n \u201cFather, Mother is about to die. Come with me to visit her. She loves you so much. She won\u2019t be able to rest in peace if she doesn\u2019t see you!\u201d\n Hearing Mu Qiu\u2019s words, Mu Mian grabbed onto the metal railing tightly. The muscles on his arms tightened and his neck felt stiff. The veins on his neck were throbbing wildly.\n \u201cMu Qiu!\u201d Mu Mian hollered. \u201cMu Qiu, I have let your mother down. I am too ashamed to face her!\u201d\n \u201cMu Qiu, go back. Go back quickly. Don\u2019t let her leave alone!\u201d\n Mu Qiu seemed to have heard Mu Mian\u2019s words and was momentarily stunned. She slid down the metal door and sat on the floor. The police officer on duty couldn\u2019t bear to watch any longer and advised her. \u201cYoung lady, go back. Your mother is still waiting for you.\u201d\n As if waking up from a dream, Mu Qiu snapped out of her trance. She supported herself against the metal door, stood up, stumbled into the cab, and left.\n \u2013\n In an isolated ward, Du Tingting\u2019s life was coming to an end. She could only breathe out but not breathe in. She stared at the ceiling with tears in her eyes.\n Her breathing was getting weaker and weaker, but she still held on and waited for someone who couldn\u2019t make it.\n Two nurses guarded her sickbed, observing her signs of life.\n Knock knock knock.\n As the footsteps got closer, the nurse looked up and saw Mu Qiu returning.\n Mu Qiu came to Du Tingting\u2019s bed and held her hand. \u201cMother, I went to look for Father. They won\u2019t let him out.\u201d\n The tears in Du Tingting\u2019s eyes grew brighter and brighter until they formed two teardrops that rolled down her cheeks.\n Mu Qiu wiped Du Tingting\u2019s tears away. \u201cMother, don\u2019t be afraid. Qiu-er will be by your side.\u201d\n Du Tingting suddenly struggled to raise her fingers.\n The nurses were all in disbelief. How can a dying person lift her own hand? They saw Du Tingting\u2019s hand pointing at the bag on the dresser.\n Du Tingting\u2019s lips quivered as if she wanted to say something, but she had lost the ability to speak and couldn\u2019t make a sound.\n As her eyelids grew heavier, Du Tingting suddenly stood up like a person who had worked for too long. She stretched her arms and sighed. \u201cHey!\u201d\n Du Tingting stopped breathing after that sigh.\n Mu Qiu was burying her head in her hands and crying. She didn\u2019t realize that Du Tingting had already left. The nurse saw her and reminded her. \u201cMiss Mu, Madam Du has already left.\u201d\n Mu Qiu stopped crying.\n She slowly looked up and saw that Du Tingting\u2019s mouth was slightly agape. She didn\u2019t give up and reached out to touch Du Tingting\u2019s nose.\n She really isn\u2019t breathing.\n Mu Qiu felt a dull ache in her heart. \u201cMother! Don\u2019t go!\u201d No matter how Mu Qiu screamed, Du Tingting would never respond to her. Even after death, she still had her eyes wide open, unable to rest in peace.\n Mu Qiu reached out to close Du Tingting\u2019s eyes, but Du Tingting just couldn\u2019t close them. Mu Qiu tried several times but couldn\u2019t close her mother\u2019s eyes. In the end, she broke down and laid on top of Du Tingting, tears streaming down her face.\n The young nurse asked the older nurse, \u201cWhat did Madam Du\u2019s hand sign mean just now?\u201d\n The older nurse walked around the end of the bed, went to the cupboard beside the bed, and opened Du Tingting\u2019s bag. The young nurse also walked over, and the two of them looked into the bag before pouring everything out.\n There was a makeup mirror, lipstick, BB cream, cell phone, keys, wallet... and a neatly folded A4 paper folder.\n \u201cCould it be this?\u201d The nurse opened the document curiously.\n As the paper was unfolded, rows of tiny black words appeared before the eyes of the two nurses.\n The form to willingly donate one\u2019s organs.\n Human organ donation is a noble act of saving other people\u2019s lives. It is an exemplary manifestation of the spirit of \u201chumanitarianism, love and devotion.\u201d I already know the basic principles and policy rules of human organ donation. I am willing to donate my organs for free after I leave...\n Personal information:\n Name: Du Tingting.\n Gender: Female.\n Birthday: 25 March 1977...\n \u201cMs. Du actually signed an organ donation form.\u201d The two nurses held this organ donation form as if a bottle of mixed emotions had been overturned in their hearts.\n Mu Qiu suddenly heard the nurses talking. She turned around groggily and looked at the documents in their hands. Guessing what they were, Mu Qiu suddenly stood up and snatched them away.\n After she finished reading the document, Mu Qiu looked at Du Tingting again. She suddenly hugged that document and squatted down to cry bitterly.\n \u201cMom, I\u2019 m sorry...\u201d\n No one knew why she apologized to Du Tingting.\n Mu Qiu cried so hard that she fainted. When she fainted, she was still clutching that donation form tightly, as if hugging a peerless treasure and not daring to let go.\n \u2013\n Song Ci found out about Du Tingting\u2019s death at 5.30am the next day.\n She sat up in shock, hurriedly pulled aside the blanket, got out of bed, and headed to the Third People\u2019s Hospital with Han Zhan.\n The two of them rushed to the hospital. They thought they would see Du Tingting\u2019s body, but the nurse informed them that she was in the operating theater. Song Ci felt strange and asked the nurse, \u201cMy mother has already passed away, why is she still going to the operating theater?\u201d\n Everyone in Wangdong City knew that Song Ci was adopted by the Mu Family. As Du Tingting\u2019s family, she had the right to know about Du Tingting\u2019s condition.\n The nurse told Song Ci, \u201cBefore Ms. Du died, she had voluntarily donated her organs. According to our country\u2019s organ donation policy, when a relative needs an organ, the organ of the deceased will be given to the relative first.\u201d\n \u201cMiss Mu suddenly fainted this morning due to a heart attack. She can\u2019t wait to undergo a heart transplant. The specialist from the Cardiovascular Department is performing a heart transplant for her.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci\u2019s body swayed.\n Han Zhan hurriedly helped Song Ci steady herself. \u201cLet\u2019s wait outside the operating theater.\u201d\n Han Zhan carried Song Ci to the operating theater. They waited for a long time before being told that Mu Qiu\u2019s heart transplant operation had ended successfully.\n Hearing this, Song Ci didn\u2019t say anything and just sat there quietly.\n Very soon, Du Tingting\u2019s body was pushed out. As she had signed the organ donation form, her kidney, lungs and cornea would be donated to those who truly needed them. Her body would also be donated to medical schools for medical research.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart suddenly ached when she saw Du Tingting\u2019s body covered by the white cloth.\n She knew that in her previous life, she had also been pushed out of the operating theater after her death. Her organs would also be donated to patients who needed them. Her body would be sent to medical school for embalming treatment and then soaked for a few years for medical students to observe and research...\n In her previous life, her ending was now Du Tingting\u2019s. Fate was truly a joke.\n Song Ci got up and walked over to Du Tingting\u2019s body. She suddenly knelt down and kowtowed three times to Du Tingting\u2019s body.\n There was nothing she could do to repay her kindness of raising her up.\n Only when the bed containing Du Tingting\u2019s body was sent away did Song Ci stand up with Han Zhan\u2019s help. She looked up at the operating theater and said to Han Zhan, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n Song Ci still hated Mu Qiu.\n Du Tingting\u2019s death and Mu Mian\u2019s capture both could not make Song Ci forgive Mu Qiu. Although Mu Qiu didn\u2019t kill her in this life, Mu Qiu\u2019s viciousness had planted a seed of hatred in Song Ci\u2019s heart.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "189": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-190\n\n Chapter 189: Brother Mo, Don\u2019t You Want Me Anymore?  On the way home, Song Ci kept silent and secretly wiped her tears. Passing by an ICBC, Song Ci thought of something and hurriedly said to Long Yu, \u201cBrother Long, stop the car by the side.\u201d\n Hearing this, Long Yu hurriedly stopped the car.\n Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n Song Ci took out her purse and said, \u201cI remember that on the day of our wedding, mother gave me a card to use as my dowry. I will go and check it out.\u201d\n \u201cI will accompany you.\u201d\n The two of them arrived at the ATM. Song Ci inserted the card and entered the password to check her balance.\n 18888888.00\n .88 million yuan.\n Song Ci stared at the long row of numbers in a daze as she recalled something.\n She vaguely remembered that at her 20th birthday party, someone had asked Du Tingting with a smile how much dowry she would prepare for her daughter when she got married.\n At that time, Du Tingting said, \u201cI love both daughters equally and will give them 18.88 million yuan each. Even if their marriage is not blissful in the future, with their dowry, they can get a divorce whenever they want. They won\u2019t have to worry about having no way out.\u201d\n Du Tingting was just a leisurely wealthy lady. No one would be surprised that she could fork out 18.88 million yuan for her biological daughter, but Song Ci was just an adopted daughter. They didn\u2019t believe that Du Tingting would be so generous to her adopted daughter.\n As a result, everyone just smiled upon hearing this. Even Song Ci herself didn\u2019t take it seriously.\n In her previous life, when Song Ci married Cheng Ziang, Chao Yang Company was in a financial crisis. Du Tingting gave all her savings to Mu Mian. As a result, Du Tingting only gave Song Ci 2 million yuan as dowry when she got married.\n In this life, when Song Ci got married, the Mu Family was not in financial straits and Du Tingting was still keeping her savings. Although Song Ci married an ordinary person, Du Tingting still gave her 18.88 million yuan!\n She was neither trying to save face nor curry favor with Song Ci\u2019s in-laws. She just wanted Song Ci to have more confidence in her future after marriage.\n Du Tingting meant every word she said to Song Ci. Song Ci looked at the row of digits and suddenly covered her mouth with her hand. She stood in front of the ATM crying bitterly...\n Han Zhan also didn\u2019t expect Du Tingting to give Song Ci so much money in the bank card. He was slightly surprised and at the same time respected Du Tingting even more.\n \u2013\n Du Tingting\u2019s heart had merged into Mu Qiu\u2019s body and it was very used to this new body. There was no obvious rejection. Du Tingting loved her daughter so much. How could she bear to let Mu Qiu suffer?\n After staying in the ICU for a few days, Mu Qiu was finally allowed into the general ward.\n Lying in bed, Mu Qiu quietly felt the power of that heart beating in her chest. Thinking of how this heart belonged to her mother, Mu Qiu didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of joy.\n She didn\u2019t know if it was because of Du Tingting\u2019s heart, but these few days, Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t help reflecting on all the foolish things she had done recently. The more she thought about it, the more she despised that evil and cruel self.\n How can I be so vicious?\n For the sake of my own life, how can I plot against the child in my mother\u2019s womb? I had even nearly caused my mother\u2019s death!\n Just because of jealousy and indignance, how can I stab Song Ci and nearly kill her?\n As I was afraid of death and wanted to live, how can I be so heartless as to hint countless times to her father to murder Song Fei?\n The more she thought about it, the more disappointed she felt.\n If her mother knew her true colors, she would probably be disappointed in her.\n Knock knock.\n Hearing the knock on the door, Mu Qiu stopped thinking and turned to look at the door.\n Mu Qiu was surprised to see Auntie Zhang carrying all sorts of shopping bags. Mu Qiu thought that Auntie Zhang had already resigned after the incident with the Mu Family. But seeing Auntie Zhang, Mu Qiu felt a sense of familiarity and her eyes welled up.\n \u201cAuntie Zhang, you haven\u2019t left?\u201d\n From the news, Mu Qiu saw that the management of Chao Yang Company had been in a mess recently. The arrest of chairman Mu Mian had severely tarnished the company\u2019s positive image that it had built up over many years. In addition, the company\u2019s stock prices had plummeted. The board of directors held a meeting and unanimously agreed to kick Mu Mian out of the board.\n Her mother was dead and her father was detained. The Mu Family was no longer the same as before. What is Auntie Zhang still doing at home? What is she after?\n \u201cMiss.\u201d Auntie Zhang placed the items down and held Mu Qiu\u2019s bony fingers. Her heart ached terribly. \u201cMiss, can I stay behind to take care of you?\u201d\n Mu Qiu gave a bitter smile. \u201cAuntie Zhang, you don\u2019t have to do this. My mother is dead and my father is bearing several life debts. I\u2019m afraid he will be sentenced to death...\u201d\n \u201cThis family is no longer around. Why are you still staying?\u201d Mu Qiu\u2019s eyes reddened as she spoke. But perhaps she had shed too many tears that night. No matter how upset she was now, she couldn\u2019t shed any tears.\n Auntie Zhang didn\u2019t know that in the case of Song Fei\u2019s murder, Mu Qiu was not innocent and that she was also a participant behind the scenes. In Auntie Zhang\u2019s eyes, Mu Qiu was just a sickly little girl who had just lost her mother.\n She had been in the Mu Family for more than a decade, and she had been taking care of Mu Qiu since she was a child. Now that Mu Qiu had just undergone surgery and didn\u2019t have anyone to take care of her, how could Auntie Zhang bear to leave Mu Qiu behind?\n \u201cI am worried about leaving you alone in the hospital. I will stay behind to take care of you. After you are discharged, I will look for another job.\u201d Auntie Zhang couldn\u2019t bear to leave just like that.\n Mu Qiu found warmth in Auntie Zhang.\n \u201cAuntie Zhang, my mother...\u201d These few days, no one told Mu Qiu about Du Tingting. Mu Qiu had no choice but to ask Auntie Zhang.\u201d Where is my mother now? \u201d\n Thinking of Madam\u2019s tragic ending, Auntie Zhang couldn\u2019t help feeling depressed. \u201cMadam\u2019s kidney was donated to a patient with uremia at Xiangjiang Hospital in the south. Her other organs and body were all taken away by the medical school...\u201d\n Although she was already prepared, Mu Qiu still felt very upset when she heard his words.\n But she couldn\u2019t cry.\n Auntie Zhang saw that Mu Qiu\u2019s ward was cold and cheerless. There was not a single bouquet of flowers or fruit. She asked, \u201cHas no one come to visit you?\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook her head. \u201cWho dares to visit me now?\u201d Who would dare to be friends with the daughter of a murderer?\n Auntie Zhang couldn\u2019t help feeling sad. \u201cBefore the incident at the Mu Family, Miss had so many friends. Why did everyone cut off all contact with you the moment something happened? These people are too cold...\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d Mu Qiu smiled faintly. \u201cIf it were me, I would also stay away from the murderer\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n \u201cWhat about Miss Song? Has she never come to visit you?\u201d Auntie Zhang sounded like she was blaming Song Ci for being too heartless.\n Even if Mr. Mu had nearly killed her elder sister, Madam and Young Mistress had never done anything wrong to her. She had really severed all ties with the Mu Family. Auntie Zhang was very unhappy and felt very bad for Du Tingting.\n Mu Qiu shook her head. \u201cNo. It would be better if she didn\u2019t come. If she\u2019s here, I don\u2019t know how to face her.\u201d\n Mu Qiu could not face Song Ci. Not only because of what Mu Mian had done to Song Fei, but also because she had once harbored evil intentions toward Song Ci.\n Hearing that, Auntie Zhang was on the verge of tears. She wiped her tears and comforted Mu Qiu. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I will accompany you, Miss!\u201d\n It was lunchtime and Auntie Zhang went downstairs to get lunch. She wanted to buy some chicken soup and porridge for Mu Qiu.\n Not long after Auntie Zhang left, there was another knock on the door.\n Mu Qiu turned back silently and looked at the door to the ward. The door was pushed open and a tall man carrying a bouquet of yellow roses walked in.\n After not seeing him for so many days, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s cold aura seemed to have deepened.\n Mu Qiu gazed at Cheng Yanmo. Her heart felt like it was being squeezed tightly by a hand. It was so painful that she couldn\u2019t breathe.\n \u201cBro...\u201d She almost called him Brother Mo, but thinking of how cold and distant Cheng Yanmo had been recently, Mu Qiu could guess his intentions.\n She changed her words and called out, \u201cMaster Cheng.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo stood at the doorway and gazed at her quietly.\n Mu Qiu had just undergone an operation and her face was pale and pallid. Her usually ethereal eyes were now dull and lifeless.\n It was very easy to pity her like this.\n Cheng Yanmo suppressed his sympathy for Mu Qiu. He strode over and placed the yellow rose on Mu Qiu\u2019s dresser.\n The empty room was decorated with several bouquets of yellow roses. It was suddenly very lively.\n Mu Qiu sniffed the fragrance of the yellow rose and praised. \u201cSmells good.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo sat down on the sofa and stared at Mu Qiu quietly. Ever since he entered the room, he hadn\u2019t said a single word. Mu Qiu felt uneasy under his stare and averted her eyes, not daring to look at Cheng Yanmo.\n As if muttering to himself, Cheng Yanmo said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot these days.\u201d\n Guessing what Cheng Yanmo had been thinking about these few days, Mu Qiu asked, \u201cDo you have an answer, Master Cheng?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s gaze was complex. He gazed at Mu Qiu\u2019s frail body, thought of Mu Qiu\u2019s lovely smile when she was beside him, thought of her sobbing softly in his arms as she called him Brother Mo, and his heart ached.\n \u201cI\u2019ve thought of it.\u201d His voice was deep.\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cI want to know your answer.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo suddenly stood up. His tall, muscular body blocked out the sunlight from the window and also took away a ray of light from Mu Qiu\u2019s life.\n Arriving at Mu Qiu\u2019s bedside, Cheng Yanmo suddenly bent down and kissed her forehead.\n Being kissed lovingly by Cheng Yanmo, Mu Qiu was like a guilty criminal waiting to be sentenced. She was so nervous that she grabbed the bedsheets with both hands, not daring to meet Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes.\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s kiss was light and gentle.\n \u201cMu Qiu,\u201d Cheng Yanmo said, \u201cThe Cheng family in Wangdong City is a century-old aristocratic family. Every family head has more or less made some mistakes, but they have protected the Cheng Family and the Chuan Dong Group very well.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo swallowed hard and paused.\n He stared at Mu Qiu\u2019s face, which had lost its last bit of color. Holding back his heartache, he spoke as calmly as he could. \u201cThe matriarch of the Cheng Family can be an ordinary woman, a strong woman, a teacher, or a female celebrity, but she cannot be the daughter of a murderer.\u201d\n Mu Qiu swallowed all her grievances.\n \u201cXiao Qiu, I cannot continue to meet you. The reputation, benefits, and status of the Cheng family and Chuan Dong Group cannot be destroyed in my hands.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019 m sorry.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo stood up and turned around. Mu Qiu grabbed his wrist. Without turning back, he heard Mu Qiu ask carefully, \u201cBrother Mo, don\u2019t you want me anymore?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo struggled internally. In the end, he turned back. His eyes met Mu Qiu\u2019s teary eyes and Cheng Yanmo\u2019s heart ached.\n He brushed off Mu Qiu\u2019s hand heartlessly and looked at the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t want you anymore.\u201d As if he had a wolf behind him, Cheng Yanmo fled the ward.\n After exiting the ward, Cheng Yanmo slowed down.\n As he walked towards the lift, the image of his previous life surfaced in his mind again and again.\n Mu Qiu had indeed done many ruthless things in order to survive, but she was devoted to Cheng Yanmo. The two of them had been married for eight years and were very much in love. They seldom quarreled.\n She was the mother of his two children, the wife who had taken a stab for him in times of danger. How could he not love her?\n But he couldn\u2019t afford to.\n The Cheng family and Chuan Dong Group couldn\u2019t be destroyed in his hands again.\n Cheng Yanmo entered the lift and met the curious gazes of the others. Only then did he raise his hand to touch his face. He was rather surprised that he could cry too\u2014for a woman.\n \u2013\n Auntie Zhang carried the food back to the ward. Just as she reached the door, she heard Mu Qiu\u2019s suppressed sobs. It was so pitiful and sad that it broke one\u2019s heart.\n Auntie Zhang stood at the door and waited for Mu Qiu to stop crying. Only then did she pretend not to hear anything and entered the ward.\n Auntie Zhang was slightly shocked when she saw the bouquet of yellow roses on the cupboard beside the bed. She asked Mu Qiu as she arranged the utensils. \u201cWho came over? They even sent flowers. Yellow roses are quite pretty.\u201d\n Mu Qiu stared at the bouquet of yellow roses in a daze. It was so beautiful, but its flower language was \u2018Apologize for Love\u2019. \u201cAuntie Zhang, throw it away.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang was stunned and instinctively said, \u201cNo, these flowers are quite pretty. It would be a pity to throw them away.\u201d\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cJust throw them away. I don\u2019t like yellow roses.\u201d\n \u201c...Alright.\u201d Seeing that Mu Qiu was in a bad mood, Auntie Zhang carried the yellow rose out. She felt it was a pity to throw it away and gave it to the nurses at the nurse\u2019s station.\n The nurses were very happy to receive the flowers. They quickly took out the roses and placed them in the folder.\n \u2013\n It was the day Song Fei was discharged from the hospital. Since Han Zhan had to go to work, Song Ci went to the hospital alone to fetch Song Fei.\n Song Ci still couldn\u2019t get over the fact that Song Fei and Han Zhan had teamed up to deceive her. After reaching the ward and seeing Song Fei, Song Ci treated her like air.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t speak and just quietly helped Song Fei pack her things. Song Fei didn\u2019t have many things, so she finished packing very quickly.\n Song Fei leaned against the wall, crossed her arms, and stared at Song Ci, who had purposely made a big scene. She felt somewhat helpless and didn\u2019t know how to apologize to Song Ci.\n Song Ci had packed up everything and was about to leave with her bag, when Song Fei reached out to stop her.\n Song Ci turned and sneered at Song Fei. \u201cMy jacket is a famous brand. It costs 20,000 to 30,000 yuan each. If you damage it, can you afford to pay me back with that lousy salary of yours?\u201d\n \u201cOh, I forgot that you are penniless now.\u201d\n Song Fei wasn\u2019t angry at Song Ci\u2019s mockery. She tugged at the corner of Song Ci\u2019s jacket and apologized humbly. \u201cSong Ci, I\u2019m sorry. I was wrong.\u201d\n It was indeed rare for Song Fei to apologize.\n But this time, Song Ci really had a backbone and didn\u2019t intend to forgive Song Fei easily. \u201cDon\u2019t. I can\u2019t bear the apology of a genius girl. I deserve it. I am foolish, I am timid, I deserve to be deceived by you guys.\u201d\n Song Fei felt a headache coming on. \u201cWhat must I do for you to forgive me?\u201d\n Coaxing my sister is so troublesome.\n But Song Fei had no choice. She only had this one sister.\n Song Ci said, \u201cDon\u2019t. I don\u2019t deserve your apology. Who am I to deserve it?\u201d Her words were dripping with sarcasm and pain.\n Song Fei gritted her teeth.\n She gave up on trying to be gentle and pulled Song Ci roughly into her arms. She pressed Song Ci\u2019s head against her shoulder, not allowing her to struggle.\n Song Ci refused to give in. She squirmed in Song Fei\u2019s arms and whined. \u201cWhy are you hugging me? Do you think I\u2019m a child? Do you think I won\u2019t be angry just because you hugged me? Song Fei, I\u2019m already an adult in my twenties. I won\u2019t fall for your tricks!\u201d\n Song Fei could only put on a pitiful act. \u201cDon\u2019t move. I am weak.\u201d\n Song Ci cursed under her breath but didn\u2019t move.\n Only after Song Ci calmed down did Song Fei tell her. \u201cSong Ci, actually in my previous life when my heart was dug out, I was conscious.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Song Ci was stunned.\n Song Fei said, \u201cI said that I was actually conscious all these years while I was in a coma. I know everything that you guys said and did to me. I remember everything from my previous life just like you.\u201d\n \u201cWhen Mu Mian dug out my heart, he thought I was in a vegetative state and didn\u2019t even give me any anesthetic. Song Ci, my heart was dug out alive. I can clearly feel the pain of my heart leaving my body.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just your problem to take revenge on Mu Mian. It\u2019s also my problem.\u201d Song Fei stroked Song Ci\u2019s hair. Hearing Song Ci\u2019s sharp intake of breath, she added, \u201cYou are my little sister. My parents have always told me to protect my little sister.\u201d\n \u201cIf I don\u2019t protect you, who will?\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, I am your elder sister. I should be the one to do the dangerous things. Just continue being your silly little girl.\u201d Men were chauvinistic while Song Fei was feminist.\n She had been an elder sister from a young age and was used to protecting the people around her.\n Song Ci was both angry and amused by Song Fei\u2019s words. \u201cGet lost, I am not a silly girl.\u201d She pushed Song Fei away and turned her back on her to wipe her tears.\n Song Fei knew that Song Ci had vented her anger.\n The sound of leather shoes approaching could be heard. Finally, they entered Song Fei\u2019s ward.\n Song Fei looked up and saw Yan Jiang. He was wearing a camel-colored windbreaker with a belt that accentuated his slim waist. His face was much sharper and he was wearing a pair of gentlemanly chain glasses.\n Behind his glasses, his eyes were as dark as the abyss. Being stared at by Yan Jiang made Song Fei feel like she was being stared at by a beast.\n What are you doing here?\u201d Song Fei asked calmly, thinking that she could control the situation.\n Yan Jiang remained silent as he strode over. He picked up his luggage from the bed, grabbed Song Fei\u2019s hand, and headed out.\n Song Fei felt very embarrassed and wanted to shake off Yan Jiang\u2019s hand. \u201cWalk properly. Why are you pulling me? I can walk myself.\u201d\n Yan Jiang suddenly glanced over with a dangerous glint in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going back with me?\u201d His tone was very cold.\n Song Fei said, \u201cWhat kind of relationship do we have? Must I go back with you?\u201d Having been controlled by Yan Jiang these few days, Song Fei was getting impatient and her words were harsh.\n Yan Jiang suddenly smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s our relationship?\u201d\n Yan Jiang released his grip and the luggage fell from his hands. He strode over to Song Fei, wrapped his arms around her waist, lowered his head, and bit her lips.\n That kiss was fierce and ruthless, like a wolf cub.\n Hearing the commotion, Song Ci turned around and saw the wild Yan Jiang. Her brows twitched.\n Damn, this guy is too bold!\n Realizing that this place was about to become a scene of carnage, Song Ci quickly slipped out without a word.\n After Song Ci left, Song Fei tried to push Yan Jiang away but to no avail. Gritting her teeth, Song Fei bit Yan Jiang\u2019s lips.\n \u201cHiss!\u201d\n Only then did Yan Jiang release her.\n Wiping the blood off the corners of his lips, Yan Jiang stared at Song Fei with a cold gaze. He suddenly smiled. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t bear to scold me in the past, but now you can even bear to bite me.\u201d\n Hearing Yan Jiang\u2019s accusations, Song Fei felt slightly guilty. She was about to apologize when Yan Jiang suddenly grabbed her wrist, pulled her over, and threw her onto the bed.\n Song Fei collapsed as Yan Jiang leaned over. He placed his palm on her cheek and suddenly inched closer to her face.\n Staring at Song Fei\u2019s thin face, Yan Jiang murmured in a daze. \u201cWill you be obedient and stay by my side once you\u2019ve completely belonged to me? Will you never abandon me again?\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Fei was stunned.\n Yan Jiang was suddenly enlightened. He said, \u201cYes, you are mine. You are mine to begin with. Once you completely belong to me, you won\u2019t play dead and leave me anymore.\u201d\n Yan Jiang kissed Song Fei again.\n Song Fei snapped out of her trance and tried to push Yan Jiang away. But she had been in a vegetative state for eight years and was no match for him in terms of physical fitness.\n After several unsuccessful attempts, Song Fei was getting anxious. She scolded Yan Jiang. \u201cIdiot! Are you crazy? I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d\n Yan Jiang ignored her and started kissing her neck.\n Realizing that Yan Jiang was acting strangely as if possessed, Song Fei suddenly said, \u201cAh Jiang, my head hurts...\u201d\n Yan Jiang suddenly stopped moving.\n He stood up and looked down at Song Fei. After a long while, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you to go for a check-up.\u201d\n Song Fei saw that his eyes were much clearer. She hurriedly sat up and tidied her clothes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt very much. I don\u2019t wish to stay in the hospital anymore. Take me home.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n Take her home...\n Song Fei grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThis hospital\u2019s bed is so hard. The disinfectant smells terrible and the food is terrible. It\u2019s also not convenient to take a bath...\u201d\n After complaining about all the hospital\u2019s shortcomings, Song Fei said to Yan Jiang, \u201cTake me home. I want to eat the porridge you cook.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s uneasy heart gradually calmed down under Song Fei\u2019s comforting words.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was holding something in one hand and grabbing Song Fei\u2019s hand tightly in the other.\n Song Fei followed Yan Jiang out of the ward. She looked up at his sharp profile and suddenly felt her heart ache. She knew that there was something wrong with Yan Jiang\u2019s mental state.\n I\u2019m the culprit.\n Song Ci hid in the ward next door and watched as Yan Jiang and Song Fei left hand in hand. She felt that this world was truly unreal. Who would have thought that such an arrogant and cold woman like Song Fei would actually be subdued by Yan Jiang?\n Staring at Yan Jiang\u2019s much thinner back, Song Ci felt bad for him and also felt happy for him. He had finally got his sweetheart.\n Upon hearing that Song Fei would be discharged today, the reporters rushed over after hearing the news. They all wanted to stop her at the hospital entrance and interview her. She was now a virus specialist that everyone in the country was concerned about. No one wanted to miss this opportunity to report about her.\n They waited for a while before seeing Song Fei come out.\n But...\n Is that man holding the hand of the talented Song Fei Yan Jiang? That Yan Jiang who had announced his retreat two months ago and then disappeared?\n Wait a minute, how did these two end up together?\n Discovering the reporters, Song Fei instinctively shook Yan Jiang\u2019s hand and said, \u201cGo wait in the car first.\u201d\n Yan Jiang would never let go of her.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? I didn\u2019t commit murder or arson. Am I that embarrassing?\u201d With that, he suddenly narrowed his eyes and stared at Song Fei thoughtfully.\n Song Fei asked, \u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked her in a sinister tone, \u201cDo you feel that I am useless, unworthy of you, and don\u2019t want anyone to discover our relationship?\u201d\n What\u2019s our relationship?\n We are clearly not related at all!\n But seeing Yan Jiang\u2019s dangerous and cold gaze, Song Fei had no choice but to comfort him. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. I just feel that you\u2019re a celebrity. Even though you\u2019ve stopped acting, you\u2019re still very popular. I\u2019m afraid that our matter will affect you, and your fans will be heartbroken.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cThis is nothing. In future, we will have sex and have a few adorable children. Their hearts will be broken countless times.\u201d\n Song Fei was speechless.\n This guy was too bold.\n If not for Yan Jiang\u2019s mental state, Song Fei would have slapped him awake.\n As they chatted, they arrived at the main entrance of the hospital.\n Song Fei was stopped by a bunch of microphones. She had no choice but to stop and put on a cool expression that only a genius girl would have.\n She was a genius. She was arrogant and overbearing. No one felt it was inappropriate.\n \u201cTeacher Song Fei, how is your recovery going?\u201d Everyone respected Song Fei. After all, she was a genius and a researcher at the Institute of Virology at such a young age. She deserved their respect.\n Song Fei\u2019s ears turned slightly red at the mention of \u2018Teacher Song Fei\u2019, but her short hair covered her ears. Apart from Yan Jiang, who was standing behind her, no one noticed that this talented young lady was blushing.\n \u201cMuch better. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Song Fei\u2019s reply was short.\n A reporter asked, \u201cDo you have anything to say about the actions of Mu Mian and the rest?\u201d\n Song Fei said sternly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I say. It depends on what the judge says. But I believe that our country\u2019s laws will give them the punishment they deserve.\u201d\n Song Fei kept her mouth shut, clearly not planning to speak again. She instinctively asked, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Everyone could tell that Ms. Song Fei was rather taciturn.\n After interviewing Song Fei a few more questions, they finally focused on the relationship between Song Fei and Yan Jiang. \u201cMs. Song Fei, do you mind telling us about your relationship with Mr. Yan Jiang?\u201d\n Song Fei was about to say that they were friends, when Yan Jiang raised their hands and said in a very cool manner, \u201cWe are holding hands now. In the future, we will be married.\u201d\n \u201cLet me introduce her to everyone. This is Song Fei, the woman I like.\u201d\n Having suffered a major setback, the reporters expressed that this interview was worth it.\n Song Fei was speechless as she boarded the car with Yan Jiang.\n How can there be such a shameless person?\n Before reaching home, Song Fei received a message from Song Ci.\n Song Fei: [?]\n Song Ci: [Take a look at it. My elder sister, you are famous.]\n Suspiciously, Song Fei opened the link and saw a video with a very frightening caption:\n [Yan Jiang confessed to Song Fei in public. Do you support this CP?]\n Song Fei opened the video and saw the scene that happened half an hour ago at the entrance of the hospital. From the perspective of a bystander, Song Fei felt ashamed.\n Song Fei kept her cell phone and said to Yan Jiang, \u201cCongratulations, you are trending again.\u201d\n After saying that, Song Fei turned her head in confusion when she didn\u2019t hear Yan Jiang\u2019s reply. Yan Jiang had fallen asleep. His head was against the pillow of the chair and his arms were crossed. He was frowning slightly.\n Over the past few days, Yan Jiang had never had a good night\u2019s sleep. His eyes were bluish-grey and filled with fatigue. It was unclear what he dreamed of, but he slept very restlessly.\n Only when Ah Lun noticed that Yan Jiang had fallen asleep did he speak softly to Song Fei. \u201cMiss Song Fei, after you died... during the days when you were kidnapped by Mu Mian, Brother Jiang didn\u2019t close his eyes for five days and five nights. It was only after Song Song came over to visit him that he cried until he was tired and took a nap.\u201d\n \u201cAfter knowing that you were still alive, he was so excited that he couldn\u2019t fall asleep. I was really worried that his body would collapse.\u201d\n Song Fei looked at Ah Lun and remained silent.\n Ah Lun was slightly afraid of Song Fei. This lady looked exactly like Song Ci, but her character was too strange and her eyes were too cold.\n Brother Jiang had a peculiar taste.\n \u201cHow many days has he not slept?\u201d Song Fei was most concerned about this.\n Ah Lun thought for a moment. \u201cAbout four days.\u201d\n Song Fei grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s face with one hand and placed his head on her shoulder. Yan Jiang was still moving when he heard Song Fei say, \u201cIt\u2019s me. Don\u2019t move.\u201d He suddenly stopped moving like a good boy.\n Ah Lun saw this and was very pleased.\n \u201cMiss Song Fei, I think Brother Jiang...\u201d Ah Lun thought for a moment and waited for Song Fei to look up before saying softly,\u201d He is mentally ill. \u201d\n Song Fei could tell that Yan Jiang had become much more stubborn and obstinate than before. \u201cHow so?\u201d\n Ah Lun said hesitantly, \u201cWhen I went over to fetch Brother Jiang this morning, I saw him...\u201d Thinking of what he saw this morning, Ah Lun felt a lingering fear.\n \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Song Fei\u2019s curiosity was aroused.\n Ah Lun was terrified and didn\u2019t even dare to look straight at Song Fei. \u201cHe prepared a huge cage at home, but Brother Jiang doesn\u2019t have any pets at home. I think... I think...\u201d\n Ah Lun kept repeating \u201cI think\u201d several times but didn\u2019t dare to finish his sentence.\n He felt that the cage was prepared for Song Fei.\n After hearing about this, Song Fei didn\u2019t feel that Yan Jiang was afraid. She only felt that she had committed a grave sin.\n Song Fei didn\u2019t expect Yan Jiang to be so obsessed with her. She had wanted to wait until this matter was over before apologizing to Yan Jiang, but Yan Jiang had already been driven mad by her. He was clearly being paranoid now.\n And she was the antidote to his paranoia.\n An apology might not be enough to appease him.\n Returning home, Song Fei woke Yan Jiang up and alighted from the car with him. Yan Jiang didn\u2019t let Ah Song in, but held Song Fei\u2019s hand as they walked into the house. Once they entered the main hall, he locked the main door.\n Hearing the sound of the door being locked, Song Fei turned and stared at the door. She asked Yan Jiang, \u201cAre you going to lock me up?\u201d\n Yan Jiang gave her a meaningful look before bringing her luggage upstairs.\n Song Fei noticed that the door to Yan Jiang\u2019s gym was closed. She glanced upstairs and confirmed that Yan Jiang wouldn\u2019t be coming down anytime soon. Only then did she walk toward the gym and open the door.\n There was a huge metal cage inside the spacious gym.\n No way!\n Song Fei turned and went upstairs to find Yan Jiang in the master bedroom. Yan Jiang was laying out the bedsheets with two pillows on the bed. Song Fei understood what he meant and asked him, \u201cAre you planning to sleep with me?\u201d\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t turn around.\n He bent over and meticulously smoothed out every single wrinkle on the bedsheets. His movements were so gentle that it seemed like he was caressing the hair of his lover.\n \u201cAh Fei.\u201d Yan Jiang stood by the bed and pointed at the bedsheets. \u201cWhat color do you like? I can change it to one that you like.\u201d\n Song Fei narrowed her eyes and remained silent.\n She remained silent for a long time. Yan Jiang\u2019s expression suddenly darkened. He stared at Song Fei intently. \u201cYou don\u2019t wish to be with me?\u201d\n Song Fei pouted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be with a lunatic.\u201d\n \u201cYou think I\u2019m crazy?\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Song Fei pointed at the door. \u201cThat cage downstairs is prepared for me, right? Are you going to lock me up if I\u2019m slightly disobedient?\u201d\n Yan Jiang remained silent and just looked at her stubbornly.\n Song Fei walked up to Yan Jiang and sat down beside the bed.\n She gazed up at Yan Jiang. \u201cYan Jiang, I don\u2019t belong to you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cYou are mine.\u201d\n \u201cI am not yours. I don\u2019t belong to anyone. I belong to myself.\u201d Song Fei told Yan Jiang. \u201cDo you think you can lock me up with just a lock? Yan Jiang, let me tell you. If I don\u2019t wish to stay, even if you lock all the doors and windows, I can still blow up a hole and walk out. You know very well that I have the capability.\u201d\n Yan Jiang frowned uneasily as he considered the possibilities.\n Song Fei added, \u201cDo you know why I\u2019m still willing to sit here and speak to you calmly?\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Song Fei suddenly reached out her right hand and grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s left. Yan Jiang looked down at their tightly held hands and heard Song Fei say, \u201cI won\u2019t leave you because I like you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s pupils quivered. Carefully, he asked in disbelief, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell that I like you?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s breathing quickened.\n Song Fei stood up and placed her finger on Yan Jiang\u2019s lips. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t like you, I wouldn\u2019t have applied the antidote on my lips and waited for you to kiss me.\u201d\n Yan Jiang recalled that they had kissed at Golden Sands.\n A tinge of sweetness blossomed in his heart. \u201cAh Fei, you like me.\u201d He was overjoyed as a heart-stirring smile spread across his face.\n Song Fei went along with Yan Jiang\u2019s words. \u201cYes, I like you.\u201d\n \u201cDo you want to date me?\u201d Song Fei suddenly asked.\n Yan Jiang nodded vigorously. \u201cYes!\u201d Feeling that this was not enough, he added. \u201cI want to sleep with you! I want to marry you and have children with you!\u201d\n Song Fei controlled her impulse to fly into a rage and cajoled Yan Jiang. \u201cIf you want to date me, go see a psychiatrist. We can continue our relationship after your mental state has stabilized.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s face suddenly turned cold.\n He pursed his lips. \u201cAre you trying to trick me into seeing a psychiatrist after saying so much? Do you think I am mentally ill?\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious that you are mentally unsound?\u201d Song Fei didn\u2019t continue to obey Yan Jiang. She wasn\u2019t born to be a caring little girl.\n Yan Jiang was about to turn black and go berserk. He wanted to pin her down and have children.\n At this moment, Song Fei suddenly added. \u201cI don\u2019t wish for my child to have a mentally ill father.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n What did Ah Fei say? She\u2019s willing to have children with me!\n \u201cI will go and see a psychiatrist.\u201d Yan Jiang stared at Song Fei worriedly and warned her. \u201cBut you cannot leave me.\u201d He leaned his forehead against Song Fei\u2019s and murmured to her. \u201cI will go crazy if I lose you.\u201d\n She believed him.\n She had already seen how crazy he was for her.\n \u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d\n Under Song Fei\u2019s persuasion, Yan Jiang agreed to see a psychiatrist.\n Song Ci came to look for Song Fei in private. She saw Song Fei reading a book titled Psychology and Life. She guessed the reason why Song Fei was reading this book and asked her, \u201cHow have you and Brother Jiang been?\u201d\n Song Fei nodded. \u201cJust like that, he is undergoing psychological treatment.\u201d\n Song Ci was relieved.\n She poured herself a cup of tea and took a sip. Song Fei asked in all seriousness, \u201cLittle fool, did it hurt the first time?\u201d\n Song Ci spat out a mouthful of tea on the coffee table.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "190": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-191\n\n Chapter 190: Han Zhan\u2019s Half-Brother with the Same Father, but Different Mother  Song Ci was shocked to hear this question from Song Fei. She quickly drew a tissue to wipe the tea clean and threw it into the bin with a sensor.\n She looked up and saw Song Fei staring at her in deep thought. Song Ci awkwardly wiped the corners of her lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to ask such a question.\u201d Is this still my cold, arrogant elder sister?\n Song Fei said, \u201cI am a human, not a nun.\u201d In other words, she also had emotions and desires. Song Fei didn\u2019t feel this was a shameful thing. She said openly, \u201cSometimes, seeing Yan Jiang\u2019s handsome face purposely swaying in front of me, I also feel somewhat restless.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n I didn\u2019t expect you to be such an indecent Song Fei.\n \u201cSo, what\u2019s the answer?\u201d Song Fei asked patiently again.\n Since Song Fei asked humbly, Song Ci naturally had to answer her doubts. Song Ci said, \u201cThat... that also depends on the technique and atmosphere.\u201d\n She stammered. \u201cYou... you have to try it yourself. Even if you ask me, I won\u2019t be able to give you an answer.\u201d\n Song Fei acknowledged and didn\u2019t continue.\n Song Ci\u2019s face was burning hot and she couldn\u2019t stay any longer. She was about to bid farewell when she heard Song Fei say, \u201cI went to Taobao yesterday to look for a beautiful dress and realized that none of them suit me.\u201d\n \u201cMy front and back are equally flat. It\u2019s useless to wear anything.\u201d Song Fei looked down at her own flat and smooth body, then stared at Song Ci\u2019s. She couldn\u2019t help feeling distressed. \u201cIs eating papaya really useful?\u201d\n Song Ci felt thunderstruck.\n Is viral research no longer attractive? Why has Song Fei become so strange recently?\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t stand the sight of Song Fei, after she changed Song Ci\u2019s impression of her repeatedly. Song Ci stood up and hurriedly said, \u201cI am going to record a song and will take my leave first.\u201d Walking behind the door, she turned back and said to Song Fei, \u201cIt might be useful to eat papayas, but you are already past puberty. It\u2019s better for you to stop wasting time.\u201d\n Walking out of Yan Jiang\u2019s house, Song Ci\u2019s face was hot.\n She really didn\u2019t expect Song Fei to be so bold and unrestrained despite being such a serious person.\n One couldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\n After Song Ci left, Song Fei got up and went to the kitchen. She stared at the box of papayas that she had just bought today in the fridge. After thinking for a moment, she took out her cell phone and sent Yan Jiang a short message: [Come back early. I made dinner.]\n In the psychological counseling room, Yan Jiang was being counseled by a psychologist.\n Yan Jiang felt very annoyed. Faced with his teacher\u2019s fierce face, he just wanted to end today\u2019s treatment and go home.\n That psychologist was still trying to persuade Yan Jiang patiently. \u201cMr. Yan, your way of thinking is very dangerous. Song Fei is a human, not a pet, not your private possession. Everyone has their own way of thinking. If you really want to keep Song Fei by your side, you must respect her and support her...\u201d\n Before he could finish speaking, Yan Jiang interrupted. \u201cHer dream is to research all the viruses in this world. She will fly all over the world. You want me to let her go?\u201d Yan Jiang\u2019s expression turned cold. \u201cYou want me to give up on her?\u201d\n The psychologist was speechless.\n He felt very helpless against such an aggressive patient.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t really want to be counseled.\n Left with no choice, the psychiatrist had no choice but to use his trump card. \u201cMs. Song Fei told me to give you a test form after the psychotherapy session ends. If you don\u2019t pass or make any progress, she won\u2019t be in a relationship or have children with you.\u201d\n These words were like a blow to the head, instantly waking Yan Jiang up.\n Yan Jiang suppressed the disgust and coldness in his eyes and pretended to be obedient. He said respectfully to the psychologist, \u201cYou are right. I should respect and support her. She is doing a good deed for the country and the people. I cannot hinder her progress.\u201d\n The psychologist was speechless.\n Please don\u2019t tell me anything against your will.\n Just as he was feeling troubled and didn\u2019t know where to start, Yan Jiang\u2019s cell phone suddenly rang. Yan Jiang had set up a special caller ID and message notification for Song Fei. Hearing this sound, he raised his palm at the psychologist. \u201cWait a moment, let me see a message.\u201d\n \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n Yan Jiang took out his cell phone and saw Song Fei\u2019s message. The frustration in his heart instantly disappeared. The psychiatrist saw that Yan Jiang\u2019s gloomy face instantly turned sunny and cheerful. He couldn\u2019t help asking curiously, \u201cIs the message from Song Fei?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Yan Jiang was like a little kid showing off his candy to his doctor. \u201cShe personally cooked today and asked me to go home for dinner. You have no idea, Song Fei doesn\u2019t know how to cook. This is her first time cooking and she gave her first time to me.\u201d\n This statement was very ambiguous, but the psychologist pretended not to hear it. He told Yan Jiang, \u201cLooks like Song Fei really likes you. She even gave you her first time cooking. This shows that you are unique to her.\u201d\n Yan Jiang felt very comforted by his words. \u201cYou are indeed the best psychologist in our city. Your analysis is very logical.\u201d He accidentally revealed the truth.\n The doctor smiled awkwardly.\n Half an hour later, the treatment ended. Yan Jiang put on his shades and left in a hurry to get home for dinner.\n After he left, the doctor picked up the phone and called Song Fei to report the situation. As Song Fei cooked, the doctor said, \u201cMiss Song Fei, I think that compared to my psychological guidance, your influence on Mr. Yan Jiang is more important.\u201d\n Song Fei put down the knife and stared at a corner of Yan Jiang\u2019s courtyard in a daze.\n \u201cJust like the previous time, Mr. Yan Jiang is still very resistant to my treatment of him. He always thinks that I am a troublemaker, not a good person, and the culprit behind your separation.\u201d A stubborn person would easily be jealous and hold grudges.\n Yan Jiang had already placed the psychologist as his enemy from the start. How could he possibly open his heart to the psychologist\u2019s counseling?\n \u201cBut after your message just now, Mr. Yan Jiang\u2019s mood instantly lifted. For the next half an hour, our progress has been rather smooth.\u201d After saying so much, the psychologist only had one thing to tell Song Fei. \u201cThe real antidote is you.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I understand.\u201d\n After hanging up, Song Fei thought for a moment and took out an onion from the refrigerator. She cut it into small cubes and prepared to fry it with eggs. Yan Jiang loved to eat scrambled eggs with onions. When his grandmother was still alive, she often cooked them for him.\n By the time Yan Jiang drove back, Song Fei\u2019s meal was almost ready.\n \u201cAh Fei.\u201d Yan Jiang hugged Song Fei\u2019s waist the moment he entered the house and said, \u201cI went to see a psychologist today and cooperated with him in his psychotherapy. The doctor praised my performance and my improvement.\u201d\n Song Fei would never believe him.\n \u201cWash your hands and prepare to eat.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes lit up. He washed his hands and excitedly reached out to remove the thermos flask lid. \u201cLet me see what you made...\u201d Yan Jiang stared at the dishes in the pan in a daze.\n Meat stuffed with papaya, stir-fried shredded papaya, papaya soup, papaya stewed with carp...\n Yan Jiang\u2019s expression changed slightly.\n Song Fei came over to serve the dishes. \u201cI bought some papayas. I can\u2019t finish them and I didn\u2019t want to waste them.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cIsn\u2019t papayas usually used for desserts?\u201d\n Song Fei narrowed her eyes and said in an unfriendly tone, \u201cSo what are you trying to say? That I don\u2019t know how to cook? That I cook sh*t cuisine?\u201d\n Yan Jiang immediately shook his head. \u201cNo, I want to say that Ah Fei is really awesome. She has invented so many new dishes.\u201d\n Song Fei felt slightly better. She patted Yan Jiang\u2019s arm and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the first person to eat the food I cooked.\u201d\n Just based on this statement, Yan Jiang could have finished all the papaya dishes.\n Yan Jiang was slightly stunned when he saw that there was a plate of stir-fried egg with onions at the bottom of the pot. The onions were slightly overcooked and the dish didn\u2019t look delicious. However, Yan Jiang\u2019s uneasy heart felt warm.\n ]\u201dDo you still remember that I like stir-fried egg with onions?\u201d Yan Jiang hugged Song Fei and said in a low voice, \u201cNo one has made this dish for me since Grandma passed away.\u201d\n Song Fei thought of the psychologist\u2019s advice and felt that she should give Yan Jiang some benefits. She said, \u201cI will make it frequently for you and our children in the future.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s heart was pounding wildly. He suddenly said, \u201cI am also going to see the psychologist tomorrow.\u201d\n Song Fei suddenly smiled. \u201cAlright.\u201d\n It was Song Fei\u2019s first time cooking and she had also come up with her own dishes, but the taste was not bad. She was indeed a genius, who could even cook. Yan Jiang had his fill and stared at Song Fei drinking milk. He suddenly said, \u201cOur Ah Fei is so smart and capable. Our future baby will be very capable too.\u201d\n Song Fei choked.\n Not wanting to dampen Yan Jiang\u2019s spirits, she said, \u201cMmm, she should look like you and have the same IQ as me.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was very satisfied.\n The next day, Song Fei woke up to find that the metal cage in the gym had disappeared. Coincidentally, Ah Lun came over with some groceries and Song Fei asked him, \u201cWhere did the cage go?\u201d\n Ah Lun smiled and said, \u201cBrother Jiang called me this morning and told me to get the movers to send the cage away.\u201d It looks like Brother Jiang\u2019s condition was slowly recovering under Miss Song Fei\u2019s influence.\n It would be a huge improvement to throw away the cage that Yan Jiang was obsessed with.\n \u201cI see.\u201d Even if he gave it away, I would feel gratified.\n As he spoke, Yan Jiang returned. He didn\u2019t come back alone. He was carrying a snow-white dog.\n Yan Jiang placed the dog cage in front of Song Fei. \u201cThis is our first child. Ah Fei, give him a name.\u201d\n Song Fei looked at Ah Lun, who looked at her with a complex expression.\n It looked like his condition had not improved.\n Song Fei asked Yan Jiang, \u201cYou really want to give it a name?\u201d\n Yan Jiang smiled and stroked Song Fei\u2019s head. He said, \u201cOf course. We will raise him like our child. This way, you won\u2019t abandon us father and son in the future casually.\u201d\n Song Fei looked at that snow-white puppy, thought for a moment, and said, \u201cSince it\u2019s your dog, let\u2019s call it Dog Yan. Its nickname is Dog.\u201d This name was unrestrained and casual.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cAlright, I will call you Dog Yan then.\u201d He felt like he was being scolded.\n Ah Lun suppressed his laughter and it was very uncomfortable.\n \u2013\n On this day, Song Ci accompanied Han Zhan on a work trip to Brunei.\n Han Zhan went out to discuss some matters with someone. Song Ci stayed alone in the hotel, wearing a long-sleeved dress and sitting on a sofa by the window, staring at the cars and women downstairs. Due to the influence of their religion, most of the girls in Brunei wore long sleeves and knee-length dresses, while others wore headscarves.\n Song Ci secretly took a photo and sent it to Song Fei. She complained to her: [I am in a country where it is not convenient to show my waist and long legs. So boring.]\n Song Fei was busy with something and ignored her.\n Song Ci opened Song Fei\u2019s social media account and realized that she and Yan Jiang had adopted a dog. The dog was only the size of two palms and had snow-white fur. It was very cute and adorable. Song Ci asked Song Fei: [You have adopted a dog. What\u2019s its name?]\n Before Song Fei could reply, Song Ci received a call from Shen Yubei.\n \u201cTeacher.\u201d Song Ci had gone to Liang Bo\u2019s recording studio the day before yesterday to record her original violin song, \u201cZhan\u201d. She had sent it to Shen Yubei to ask him for some advice. Song Ci asked him, \u201cTeacher, have you listened to the song?\u201d\n \u201cI have.\u201d He had heard it so many times, he already knew how to play it. \u201cThe tune is excellent. You didn\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s lips curled into a faint smile. \u201cOf course. You should know whose student I am.\u201d\n \u201cLet me tell you something.\u201d Shen Yubei told Song Ci. \u201cIn two months\u2019 time, the production team of \u2018Le Chi\u2019 will be coming to China for an audition and they will be selecting a role.\u201d\n Song Ci knew of the work Le Chi. In her previous life, this film had achieved great success at the International Film Festival. It had also won the Best Director Award, Best Photography Award, and Best Music Award. The male lead had also won the Best Actor Award. It was truly a glorious achievement.\n Song Ci asked Shen Yubei, \u201cWhat kind of character?\u201d\n Shen Yubei said, \u201cA violinist with handicapped legs.\u201d\n Song Ci guessed Shen Yubei\u2019s motive for bringing this up. \u201cTeacher, you want me to participate in the selection?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Shen Yubei told Song Ci, \u201cThe director of this movie is Du Junfei. Although he has a lot of shortcomings, his works are top-notch. I want you to attend Queen Elizabeth\u2019s International Music Competition three years later. You can go to Du Junfei\u2019s movie first to show your face. By then, you will have an advantage in the competition.\u201d\n Queen Elizabeth\u2019s International Music Competition was the world\u2019s most prestigious and high-profile violin competition. Shen Yubei was once the champion, so his disciple had to be the champion.\n After hearing Shen Yubei\u2019s words, Song Ci also burned with determination. \u201cI will do my best!\u201d\n \u201cAlright, get ready.\u201d\n Only after Shen Yubei hung up did Song Ci realize that Song Fei had replied to her message.\n Song Fei: [Yan Dog.]\n Song Ci was stunned for a moment and didn\u2019t understand what she was saying. Only after looking at the chat did Song Ci understand that Song Fei was talking about that dog\u2019s name.\n [You called that dog Yan Dog?] Song Ci looked confused. Who would name a dog like that?\n Song Fei: [Mmm.]\n Song Ci: [You guys really know how to name things.] I wonder who this name is scolding.\n That night, when Han Zhan returned, Song Ci told him about it. \u201cYan Jiang and Song Fei have a dog. Guess what its name is?\u201d\n Han Zhan thought for a moment and said, \u201cAh Huang?\u201d\n \u201cDog Yan.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless. There was nothing wrong with calling Yan Jiang\u2019s dog by this name. It had a first name and a last name, so it was quite a good name.\n Han Zhan walked over to the sofa and pulled Song Ci up.\n He sat down on the sofa and let Song Ci lean into his arms. \u201cWe will go back the day after tomorrow. I am very busy tomorrow and won\u2019t have time to play with you. Baby Ci, is there anywhere you wish to visit? I will get Long Yu to accompany you.\u201d\n \u201cI really want to visit the palace, but it\u2019s not the fasting month now and the palace is not open to the public.\u201d Song Ci felt rather regretful. She still looked forward to entering the palace and taking a look.\n \u201cThat will have to wait until next year. Do you want to go elsewhere to take a look?\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci. \u201cThe Jamie Mosque is one of their famous landmarks. Do you want to take a look?\u201d\n \u201cAlright.\u201d\n Noticing that Han Zhan\u2019s hands were starting to move, Song Ci grabbed his arm. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThe date of Mu Mian\u2019s first trial has been confirmed\u201420 days later.\u201d\n Song Ci was caught off-guard by the sudden change in topic. \u201cAnd then?\u201d\n \u201cAnd then...\u201d Han Zhan smiled and kissed her nose, hinting.\u201d Do you remember what I told you previously? \u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm and warned him. \u201cSpeak your mind, don\u2019t get physical.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at Song Ci with a teasing look in his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it when I get physical?\u201d\n Song Ci pretended not to hear.\n Han Zhan opened his arms and placed them on the armrest of the sofa. He then told Song Ci, \u201cI said that when this matter with the Mu Family is over, we can start preparing for pregnancy.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Song Ci especially liked children. Although she knew that giving birth might ruin a woman\u2019s figure and cause her to have pregnancy marks, she still wanted a child of her own. \u201cAlright then. Brother Han will work hard to earn money for your little friend\u2019s diapers.\u201d\n \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t put gold in his diapers, we\u2019ll still have enough money.\u201d Han Zhan hugged Song Ci\u2019s waist and asked her, \u201cBaby Ci, can you give me a Little Baby Ci?\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n The next day, Song Ci put on a long dress and prepared a veil in her bag. Only then did she arrive at Jamie Mosque accompanied by Long Yu. Along the way, she had read many travel guides, afraid of violating the temple\u2019s rules.\n The mosque was opened at a different time every day. Song Ci and the rest arrived at the entrance at the same time. Song Ci and Long Yu took off their shoes and changed into the black robe provided by the temple. She put on their headscarves and entered the temple with Long Yu.\n This temple was very famous in Brunei. The main hall was grand and majestic, the domed roof exquisite and gorgeous, emitting an air of wealth everywhere. Song Ci discovered that there were two worship rooms in the temple. The big one was the men\u2019s hall and the small one was the women\u2019s hall.\n Having grown up in a loving and respectful family environment, Song Ci hated it the most. She stood at the door of the worship room and thought for a moment but didn\u2019t enter.\n Long Yu went in for a tour and Song Ci strolled around alone until she came to a blue fountain.\n The water in the fountain was very clear. Looking up, one could see the blue sky and white clouds. Surrounding them was a picturesque garden. Song Ci had the urge to take a photo.\n But photography was prohibited in monasteries.\n Song Ci felt somewhat regretful.\n Kacha!\n Song Ci heard the sound of a camera.\n She turned around in surprise and saw a tall young man with blonde hair and blue eyes standing behind her. He was wearing a navy blue shirt and black pants that hugged his long, muscular legs.\n The young man looked to be in his early twenties and had a very handsome face. There was a tiny black mole between his lower lip and chin. It didn\u2019t make him look uglier, but rather unique instead.\n Seeing Song Ci look over, he shrugged, stuck out his tongue, quietly stuffed his cell phone back into his pocket, and made a \u201cshh\u201d sign at her.\n Song Ci tilted her head and looked at him with a faint smile.\n \u201cYou won\u2019t report me, right?\u201d The young man spoke in fluent Malay.\n Song Ci replied, \u201cI am Chinese.\u201d She spoke in English.\n The young man was slightly surprised. He walked up to Song Ci and stood beside her.\n \u201cVery few Chinese come to Brunei to play. Everyone is more willing to go to Thailand, New Zealand, or the Western Region.\u201d Unexpectedly, the young man spoke standard Chinese. Although his pronunciation was slightly odd, Song Ci could understand it.\n Song Ci smiled and told him, \u201cYou should go to China to take a look. After seeing the majestic mountains and rivers of China, you will realize that the places that Chinese people love to go the most will always be China.\u201d\n The young man was slightly stunned.\n \u201cYes, China is big and filled with many things. It\u2019s a good place.\u201d He reached out his hand to Song Ci. \u201cJack Abraham, may I know your name?\u201d His words were genteel and sounded funny and interesting.\n Song Ci shook his hand. \u201cRose Adkins.\u201d\n He said his name was Jack and she said her name was Ross. It was the name of the Titanic main characters. The young man was momentarily stunned. He knew that he had been fooled by Song Ci. He smiled and said, \u201cMiss, you are so funny.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled in agreement. \u201cMy name is Song Ci.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci? Tang Shi Song Ci?\u201d It looked like this young man had some understanding of Chinese culture and even knew of the Tang poems.\n Song Ci explained. \u201cSong Ci, porcelain\u2019s \u2018Ci\u2019.\u201d\n \u201cOh!\u201d The young man snapped his fingers. \u201cI know! An intricate porcelain item! I have Jingde Town\u2019s porcelain at home!\u201d\n Song Ci smiled and didn\u2019t deny it.\n From the corner of her eye, he saw a male figure quickly approaching. Only then did Aaron bid Song Ci farewell. \u201cBeautiful lady, we will meet again if fate wills it. I have to go and look for my friend.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll meet again if fate permits.\u201d\n As soon as Aaron Clooney left, Long Yu arrived.\n \u201cMadam, who is that?\u201d Long Yu frowned as he watched that person\u2019s departing back profile. His eyes flashed with caution.\n Song Ci told him, \u201cJack Abraham. He said his name was this, so I told him my name is Ross Adkins.\u201d Song Ci smiled coldly, stared at that person\u2019s back view, and said faintly, \u201cTell Han Zhan that I was noticed by a suspicious man.\u201d\n \u201cHow did Madam know there was something wrong with this person?\u201d Long Yu took a deep look at Song Ci and realized that Madam was smarter than he thought.\n Song Ci shot Long Yu a profound look. \u201cA woman\u2019s intuition is even more accurate than a detector.\u201d\n Long Yu shrugged. He felt that Madam had a point.\n At night, Han Zhan alighted from the car and saw Long Yu waiting at the entrance of the hotel. He walked over. \u201cWaiting for me?\u201d\n Long Yu said, \u201cI\u2019m addicted to smoking and wanted to find a place to smoke. But the entire country banned smoking.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled. \u201cJust quit smoking. Don\u2019t blacken your lungs.\u201d\n Long Yu remained silent and looked rather obedient.\n \u201cSomething noteworthy did happen today.\u201d Long Yu told Han Zhan about the existence of that man who called himself Jack.\n After hearing about this, Han Zhan appeared very concerned. As they walked towards the hotel lobby, Han Zhan asked Long Yu, \u201cWhat did that person look like?\u201d\n Long Yu said, \u201cI only saw his back view. He is rather tall. Madam said that the man is very young. His hair is golden and his eyes are blue. Oh yes, Madam also said that the man has a small black mole between his lips and chin.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan stopped in his tracks.\n Long Yu also stopped.\n Han Zhan turned around, his eyes suddenly turning cold. \u201cThat person, is he limping slightly?\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t notice that, but...\u201d Long Yu carefully recalled that person\u2019s walking posture and noticed a detail. He hurriedly told Han Zhan,\u201d He\u2019s walking very slowly, as if he\u2019s afraid of stepping on ants.\u201d\n \u201cGot it.\u201d\n On the way back to the room, Han Zhan didn\u2019t say another word.\n In the room, Song Ci was already asleep. Han Zhan wanted to tell her about it, but seeing that she was sleeping soundly, he gave up. The next afternoon, they set off for China.\n Song Ci was about to enter the cockpit like how she had come, when Han Zhan grabbed her wrist. \u201cSit with me today. I have something to tell you.\u201d\n Song Shiqing and Xiong Jian hurriedly shut the cockpit door, upon seeing this.\n Song Ci had no choice but to follow Han Zhan to his private lounge. Once the door was closed, Han Zhan took off his jacket.\n Song Ci sat on Han Zhan\u2019s little bed. Thinking of some movies she had watched before, she smiled mischievously and teased Han Zhan. \u201cOur actions will let the public have wild thoughts.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you thinking about? We are legally husband and wife\u2014up to them.\u201d Han Zhan laid down on the bed and crossed his legs comfortably.\n Song Ci laid down and rested her head on Han Zhan\u2019s arm. \u201cWhat do you want to tell me, Brother Han?\u201d\n \u201cI think I know the man who approached you yesterday.\u201d\n Song Ci lifted her head, stared at Han Zhan\u2019s face, frowned, and asked, \u201cYou guys really know each other? Could he be a spy? Or a killer?\u201d\n \u201cNeither.\u201d Han Zhan turned to look at the clear blue sky outside the window. He said in a muffled voice, \u201cHe\u2019s my younger brother.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n \u201cYour younger brother? How do you have a brother?\u201d Song Ci had never heard of Han Zhan having a brother. She thought for a moment and said, \u201cNot biological, right?\u201d\n \u201cKind of.\u201d Han Zhan added. \u201cSame father but different mother.\u201d\n \u201cAh?\u201d Thinking of that arrogant golden retriever, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cYour father is a foreigner?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Without waiting for Song Ci to speak again, Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cHe is an international drug lord.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Never would she have thought that Han Mulan, who was born into a wealthy family, would actually marry a major drug lord. Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to think too much into the details.\n \u201cWe have four siblings in total. I have an elder brother who is the most suitable and proud successor to my father. I also have a younger sister and a younger brother. The man you saw yesterday should be my younger brother. His name is Aaron.\u201d\n \u201cAaron Clooney.\u201d\n Han Zhan placed an arm over his eyes and sank into his memories. His narration gradually slowed down as if he was talking about a stranger. \u201cAaron is the youngest child. He was very timid and naive when he was young. Every child of ours has to go through a procedure on their fourth birthday...\u201d\n \u201cMurder.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked speechless.\n \u201cOn the day of Aaron\u2019s fourth birthday, his father chose a twelve-year-old little girl as a sacrifice. Ah Rang didn\u2019t dare to shoot and couldn\u2019t bear to. He begged his father to let her go and in a fit of anger, his father shot Aaron in the calf.\u201d\n \u201cAaron has a slight limp because of that.\u201d\n Song Ci shuddered. She never expected Han Zhan to live in such an environment when he was young.\n \u201cHe hates me.\u201d\n \u201cWhy does he hate you?\u201d Song Ci thought that Han Zhan had bullied Aaron before.\n Aaron hated Han Zhan not because Han Zhan had bullied him. The truth was heartbreaking.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cAaron was the closest to me when we were young. He looked forward to getting rid of our father together when we grew up and escaping from that abyss with me.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I was 7 years old, Grandpa came looking for me and brought me home. I had a new life and became a soldier protecting my country. Meanwhile, my father forced Aaron to become a ruthless bad guy, a wanted criminal.\u201d\n \u201cHe hates me, hates me for leaving him behind, hates me for leaving him in that hellish abyss, living like a walking corpse. I don\u2019t know when he noticed you, but Song Ci, Aaron is no longer the naive and kindhearted Aaron that I know. His time is precious and he never does anything that doesn\u2019t require much effort. If he took the initiative to approach you, he must have ulterior motives.\u201d\n \u201cOnce a strange and suspicious person appears by your side, you must tell me.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d The image of Aaron surfaced in Song Ci\u2019s mind. His smile was so radiant and she really didn\u2019t expect his hands to be covered in blood. \u201cThen Brother Han, mother-in-law is...\u201d\n \u201cShe is really dead. My father shot her in front of me.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned. \u201cThis, this...\u201d She gritted her teeth.\u201d Is he even human? He must be a beast! \u201cSuch a beast actually has four children. It was ridiculous.\n Some good men would have difficulties even marrying a wife, but he had so many lovers and so many children!\n \u201cHe\u2019s worse than a beast if he can even kill his own wife!\u201d At least a beast knew how to protect its spouse!\n \u201cYou are wrong.\u201d Han Zhan corrected Song Ci\u2019s words. \u201cMy mother is not his wife. She is just his lover.\u201d\n Song Ci was even more shocked.\n How could Han Aoyu\u2019s daughter be willing to be a man\u2019s mistress!\n \u201cMy father has only loved one woman in his life\u2014a woman he loved deeply but couldn\u2019t have. If he couldn\u2019t have that woman, he would never get married. Whether it was my mother or Aaron\u2019s mother, they were just replacements that he found. A bunch of replacements that were similar to his first love.\u201d\n \u201c...\u201d\n Should I praise Han Zhan\u2019s father for being devoted or scold him for being inferior to dogs and pigs?\n \u201cLuckily you are not like your father.\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly smiled. \u201cI am his son. His blood flows in my veins. There are some similarities between us.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s expression froze. \u201cDon\u2019t scare me.\u201d\n Seeing that he had scared Song Ci, Han Zhan finally smiled and said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t similar in anything else but our lust for beauty.\u201d\n Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and said, \u201cBefore meeting you, I didn\u2019t realize that I was actually a pervert.\u201d\n Song Ci was overjoyed. Brother Han was indirectly praising her good looks. \u201cErm, I know I am good looking. You should stop before going overboard. I will soar to the sky.\u201d\n Ever since she married Han Zhan, Song Ci had become more and more arrogant. She was afraid that she would get carried away and lose herself. \u201cAlright, I will take a nap and wake me up half an hour earlier.\u201d\n Song Ci fell asleep immediately.\n However, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Speaking of his childhood, he couldn\u2019t help recalling those dark memories.\n Childhood was cruel and heartless to Han Zhan. His father wanted to groom him into a drug-resistant entity and injected him with all sorts of drugs from a young age. As a result, when Han Aoyu found him, he was covered in needle wounds.\n Subsequently, he was brought home by his grandfather. Only after several years of continuous injections of the antidote to the hormone did things become normal. As a result, Han Zhan especially respected his grandfather. Without his grandfather, he would have become a more terrible and degenerate person.\n However, Han Zhan didn\u2019t intend to tell Song Ci about this. If she knew, she would definitely think of him as a pitiful little kid. Han Zhan didn\u2019t want to be a pitiful little kid for Song Ci\u2014he wanted to be her indomitable husband.\n \u2013\n Returning to Wangdong City, Han Zhan\u2019s work got busier and busier. Song Ci also didn\u2019t idle around during this period. It was a major event for Yu Hua Media Company to release their first album for Liang Bo. From composing and composing to music video, they put in a lot of effort.\n Liang Bo had a lot of trust in Song Ci and he insisted that she compose songs for him. Song Ci was flabbergasted by Liang Bo\u2019s praise.\n She agreed without hesitation when she felt overwhelmed.\n There were a total of seven songs on the first album. Now that Song Ci had something to do, she stayed home to compose everyday.\n Han Zhan came back one night and saw Song Ci sleeping on the piano. He thought that it was time to change to a bigger house and build Song Ci a spacious, luxurious, and professional musical instrument room.\n The next day, Han Zhan got Bei Zhan to help him contact an architect and hired him at a high price to design a new house for him. The new house was set at the top of the Great Dragon Mountain.\n The Great Dragon Mountains was situated beside the Great Dragon River. To the west was the Blue Water District and the Jin Mountain District. To the south was the Mountain Gaze. At the top of the Great Dragon Mountains was a strange stone. It was shaped like a dragon\u2019s head that looked down on the Great Dragon River. As a result, that mountain was named the Great Dragon Mountains.\n 33 years ago, Mo Yao, who was still in university, spent a fortune to buy this hill. She had originally planned to build a big mansion for the four sisters to live in together.\n But Han Mulan\u2019s death had become the eternal pain in the hearts of Mo Yao and the other two sisters, so there was no need to build that villa.\n After that, on Han Zhan\u2019s 18th birthday, Mo Yao gave this mountain to him.\n Han Zhan explained all the requirements to the architect in detail, and then allowed the architect to do whatever he wanted, quietly waiting for the results. Song Ci had a career heart and lived happily everyday, not knowing that Han Zhan was secretly building a luxurious villa behind her back.\n In the blink of an eye, it was time for Mu Mian\u2019s first trial.\n As the victim and the victim\u2019s family, Song Ci and Song Fei needed to be court-martialed. As the victim\u2019s daughter, Su Beibei should also attend the trial.\n Mu Mian was about to be punished by the law. Some had been looking forward to this day for more than a decade, while others were afraid of it.\n Mu Qiu had already been discharged from the hospital and returned home. Once upon a time, this house was filled with warmth and laughter. But now, some were dead, some were arrested, and late at night, it was eerily quiet.\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t dare to go upstairs to sleep. Every time she went up to the second floor, she felt like her mother would suddenly open the door to the master bedroom and walk out. She smiled and asked her, \u201cQiu-er, why are you only back now?\u201d\n Mu Qiu had a guilty conscience. She only dared to sleep in the guest room on the first floor.\n Auntie Zhang didn\u2019t know what Mu Qiu was thinking. She thought that she was weak and tired from going up and down the stairs.\n Tomorrow was the day of Mu Mian\u2019s trial. Auntie Zhang saw that Mu Qiu looked uneasy and asked her, \u201cMiss, are you worried about tomorrow?\u201d\n Mu Qiu nodded. \u201cAuntie Zhang, do you think my father will be sentenced to death?\u201d\n Auntie Zhang remained silent.\n It was obvious that Mu Mian had already become a major sinner with three lives killed and nearly killing Song Fei. It would be a wonder if he isn\u2019t sentenced to death!\n Regardless of how much Auntie Zhang sided with Mu Qiu, she felt that Mu Mian should be sentenced to death, but she couldn\u2019t say this in front of Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu shook her head with a bitter smile. \u201cIt will definitely be a death sentence, right? No one can change this outcome.\u201d Mu Qiu leaned against the sofa. Recalling how well her father treated her, she couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy would he kill someone?\u201d\n How can such a good father be a murderer?\n Auntie Zhang said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s in a person\u2019s heart. Some people may look kind and benevolent on the surface, but their hearts are black. A person can\u2019t be seen through just by his eyes. Even Madam only saw Sir\u2019s true colors at death\u2019s door, much less you, Miss.\u201d\n Unknowingly, Auntie Zhang\u2019s words hurt Mu Qiu. Mu Qiu suddenly stood up and said, \u201cI am going to rest. Auntie Zhang, rest early too.\u201d\n \u201cOh, alright.\u201d Auntie Zhang saw that Mu Qiu was angry but didn\u2019t know what she said wrong.\n Mu Qiu returned to the guest room and pulled the blanket over her. She placed her hand on her chest and felt her strong heartbeat.\n \u2014 It was hard to tell what kind of person one was. Some people looked kind on the surface, but their hearts were black.\n If Auntie Zhang knew my true colors, she would probably flee with her luggage.\n \u201cMother, if you knew what I did, would you still give me your heart?\u201d\n No one could answer Mu Qiu\u2019s question.\n \u2013\n The moon was shining brightly in the night sky.\n A woman in a black leather jacket and black denim pants sat cross-legged by the bank of the Great Dragon River. She looked up at the twinkling stars and smiled.\n \u201cMother, Father, Mu Mian will be undergoing a trial tomorrow. I will avenge you soon.\u201d Su Beibei looked sideways at the distant Imperial Dragon Bridge and thought of that morning 14 years ago.\n That morning, her parents\u2019 bodies laid alone in the rain. It was so cold that she couldn\u2019t wake them up, no matter how much she cried.\n 14 years had passed. Recalling the scene of her parents\u2019 deaths, Su Beibei no longer felt any heart-wrenching pain, but she still felt terrible and sad.\n Thinking of Li Li, Su Beibei felt slightly troubled. \u201cMother, should I tell him the truth?\u201d Su Beibei was hesitant, hoping that someone could point her in the right direction.\n At this moment, her cell phone suddenly rang.\n Su Beibei answered the call and heard Li Li say, \u201cBeibei, are you still writing tonight? I just got off work and miss you a little. I want to meet you. If it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll come and look for you.\u201d\n Hearing Li Li\u2019s amused voice, Su Beibei couldn\u2019t help curling her lips. \u201cCome look for me at the riverbank beside the Great Dragon Bridge.\u201d\n \u201cAh? It\u2019s so late. Are you there alone?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cWait there, I will come!\u201d\n The Three Bridges District was not far from the Imperial Dragon Bridge. He arrived in just 10 minutes. Li Li hurried over to the riverbank in the shortest time possible. From afar, he saw several bottles of beer beside Su Beibei.\n Li Li walked over and covered Su Beibei\u2019s eyes. He purposely lowered his voice to intimidate Su Beibei. \u201cWhere did this beautiful girl come from? I\u2019m going to take you away.\u201d\n Su Beibei reached out and touched the beer bottle beside her in the dark. She lifted the beer and said to Li Li, \u201cSir, do you want to drink a bottle to boost your courage?\u201d\n Li Li chuckled.\n He released Su Beibei\u2019s eyes and kissed her on the forehead. He took the beer and sat down beside her.\n \u201cWhy are you here alone? Is there something bothering you? Or do you not have inspiration?\u201d Li Li opened the cap of his beer and took a gulp.\n Su Beibei handed her own beer to Li Li. \u201cHelp me open it. I am a weak girl.\u201d A weak girl who could lift 40 catties of rice with one hand.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Opening the bottle with his teeth, Li Li handed the beer to Su Beibei but didn\u2019t let go. He hinted at Su Beibei. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you show some appreciation?\u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Su Beibei leaned close to Li Li. Just when Li Li thought that Su Beibei was going to kiss him, Su Beibei quickly reached out her hands and pinched Li Li\u2019s chest.\n \u201cHowl!\u201d Li Li\u2019s expression changed from the pain.\n Su Beibei snatched the beer back and took a big gulp. She smacked her lips as she savored the aftertaste. \u201cSong Ci didn\u2019t lie to me. You men are indeed afraid of pain.\u201d\n The smart Li Li grasped the main point.\n So Mr. Han had also been pinched by Song Ci?\n I couldn\u2019t tell that even though Mr. Han looks formidable and unyielding, he\u2019s also secretly a small ball of pity that is bullied by Song Ci.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "191": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-192\n\n Chapter 191: Mu Mian: Mu Qiu, You Are Not Human!  Li Li rubbed his chest and waited for the pain to subside, before grabbing the bottle again and toasting with Su Beibei.\n Su Beibei raised her beer bottle and downed half of it in one go. Li Li narrowed his pretty eyes and said firmly, \u201cBeibei, there\u2019s something bothering you.\u201d\n Su Beibei opened her mouth and let out a breath that reeked of alcohol. She then said, \u201cI have something to tell you, but I don\u2019t have the courage. I am hesitant, so I want to have a drink to give myself some courage.\u201d\n Hearing her say this, Li Li felt uneasy and uneasy. \u201cYou...\u201d Li Li\u2019s smile was somewhat forced, as he felt the beer in his hand start to taste bitter.\u201d Are you breaking up with me? \u201d\n Su Beibei shook her head. \u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing wrong with our relationship. Why must we break up?\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s anxious heart suddenly calmed down. \u201cThen what do you want to say? Tell me, I\u2019m okay .\u201d As long as we didn\u2019t break up, everything is fine.\n Su Beibei said, \u201cMu Mian will be tried tomorrow.\u201d\n Not expecting Su Beibei to suddenly mention Mu Mian, Li Li was momentarily stunned before nodding. \u201cYes, the news has already spread today. I believe the court will be very crowded tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cI will go too,\u201d Su Beibei said.\n Li Li asked her, \u201cDo you want to listen in on the happenings and accumulate material for your next book?\u201d Apart from this reason, he couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\n Su Beibei shook her head in denial. \u201cNo, I\u2019m going as the victim\u2019s family.\u201d\n Li Li was confused, not understanding what Su Beibei meant. \u201cHow can you be the victim\u2019s family? You...\u201d Li Li vaguely understood.\n One of the victims murdered by Mu Mian had the surname Su.\n And that person was the person who had fallen into the river after his father crashed into his car!\n Looking at Su Beibei, he saw her eyes glistening with tears. Li Li\u2019s expression turned increasingly odd. \u201cBeibei, don\u2019t tease me.\u201d His voice was trembling.\n Su Beibei\u2019s smile was uglier than her crying face. \u201cMy father is called Su Buwang.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s expression froze. Is Beibei really that person\u2019s daughter?\n \u201cHow can that be?\u201d\n \u201cLi Li, do you still remember that year when your father crashed into a car and it plunged into the Great Dragon River? The man was called Su Buwang and the woman was Jin Yunshu. They were the founders of the Happy shopping website.\u201d\n Looking into Li Li\u2019s shocked eyes, Su Beibei was on the verge of tears. \u201cThey are my parents. I am that little girl who you knelt down to apologize for your sins.\u201d\n Li Li was too stunned to speak. \u201cHow could...\u201d was all he could say.\n \u201cAh Li.\u201d Su Beibei\u2019s tears still streamed down her face. \u201cAh Li, your father did get drunk and hit a car, but he didn\u2019t kill my parents. Mu Mian is the real culprit.\u201d\n \u201cYour father is guilty, but his crime is not worth dying for.\u201d\n Su Beibei felt very sorry for Li Li. She was crying very bitterly. She covered her face with her hands and apologized to Li Li in tears. \u201cAh Li, I\u2019ve let you and your mother down. That year, you and your mother sold your house to compensate me. I caused you and your mother to be homeless. Ah Li, I\u2019ve let you down.\u201d\n Li Li was in a daze for a long while, before he finally digested this absurd fact. A big hand gently landed on Su Beibei\u2019s head and patted her gently.\n Su Beibei wiped her tears and looked up at Li Li.\n Li Li\u2019s lips curled into a faint smile. He told Su Beibei, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. My father was drunk and crashed into a car. He is guilty. Although he doesn\u2019t deserve death, he is not innocent either.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s father was responsible for the Su couple\u2019s death. \u201cHe can\u2019t blame anyone for his death. He can only blame himself for being cowardly and irresponsible.\u201d\n \u201cAs for me and my mother, our hardships are already over. You don\u2019t need to feel apologetic.\u201d\n \u201cAlso, I am very glad that my father is not the murderer who murdered your parents. I am glad that I am still qualified to continue staying by your side.\u201d\n Su Beibei was not an idiot who would lose her mind in love. But after hearing Li Li\u2019s words, she felt moved.\n \u201cI feel more at ease now that I\u2019ve said it.\u201d Su Beibei smiled sheepishly. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any inspiration in my writing these days, with something weighing my heart down.\u201d\n \u201cYou should have told me earlier.\u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cI didn\u2019t dare.\u201d\n Li Li was stunned. He then quietly held Su Beibei\u2019s hand.\n The wind by the river was very strong and their hands were cold. Su Beibei opened her jacket and said to Li Li, \u201cCome into my arms if you\u2019re cold.\u201d\n This boyfriend-powerful action and tone stunned Li Li.\n Li Li looked around and made sure no one was around, before shamelessly burrowing into Su Beibei\u2019s arms. \u201cYour arms are so warm.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cSo fragrant.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cSo soft.\u201d\n \u201cShut up!\u201d Su Beibei disliked Li Li\u2019s glib tongue.\n Li Li kept silent for a moment before suddenly saying, \u201cHow about coming over for a meal with me in two days\u2019 time? After my mother found out that I had a girlfriend, she kept asking me when I would bring my girlfriend home for a meal.\u201d\n His mother had recovered fully after the surgery and was in good spirits. She could eat and drink as much as she liked, and was always urging him to bring his girlfriend over for a meal.\n Although CEO Li appeared to be well-respected in the company, he was actually a pitiful single dog being urged to get married by his mother.\n Su Beibei was rather embarrassed. \u201cThis is my first time in a relationship and I\u2019m not familiar with this. I also don\u2019t know the rules when visiting your parents for the first time. Wait for me to go back and come up with a strategy to meet my mother-in-law. I\u2019ll come home with you then.\u201d\n Mystery author Su Beibei would never do anything she wasn\u2019t sure of.\n Li Li was momentarily stunned before bursting with joy. \u201cYou agree?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Su Beibei patted Li Li\u2019s head and added, \u201cYou\u2019ve already given me your innocence. I can\u2019t possibly not be responsible for you.\u201d\n Li Li was speechless.\n That night, Li Li followed Su Beibei like a puppy back to her house. His mother woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet. She was worried about her son when she realized that Li Li was not back yet.\n Due to Father Li\u2019s incident, Mother Li was traumatized by the accident. She didn\u2019t know if Li Li stayed over at the office or if an accident happened on the way home. After washing her hands in the toilet, she stood there and called Li Li.\n The call went through but no one picked up. Worried, Mrs. Li called again.\n Li Li went downstairs to buy supper. Exhausted, Su Beibei laid in bed and stared at the vibrating cell phone. She hesitated.\n Li Li\u2019s mother\u2019s call...\n Knowing that Mother Li was worried about Li Li, Su Beibei chose to pick up the call just a few seconds before it was going to quietly hang up.\n The moment the call went through, Li Li\u2019s mother asked worriedly, \u201cLi Li, are you sleeping at the office again tonight? Why didn\u2019t you call me when you weren\u2019t coming back? Are you purposely making me worried?\u201d\n Su Beibei said hesitantly, \u201cAuntie, Li Li went out to buy supper. He probably forgot to call you. Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s fine.\u201d\n Mrs. Li was speechless.\n Even though Su Beibei was on the phone, Mother Li felt like her daughter-in-law was standing right in front of her.\n She instinctively tidied her messy hair, wanting to leave a clean impression on her daughter-in-law. She looked up and saw herself in the mirror. Only then did she realize that she was at home and her daughter-in-law was on the other end of the phone!\n Mother Li asked Su Beibei cautiously, \u201cYou are Beibei?\u201d\n Li Li had indeed mentioned her to his mother. \u201cYes, Auntie.\u201d\n \u201cAiya, Li Li went to your house to play tonight. Hey, it\u2019s getting late, I won\u2019t disturb you guys anymore. Go and rest early.\u201d\n It was her first time talking to her daughter-in-law and Mother Li was also very nervous. After hanging up, she leaned against the sink and repeated what she had just said.\n Only after confirming that she didn\u2019t say anything wrong did Mother Li feel relieved.\n Li Li returned with barbeque. Su Beibei popped her head out of bed and told him, \u201cYour mother just called. It rang twice. I answered it for you.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d Li Li put down the barbeque and saw Su Beibei get up from the bed. She sat on the bed and said, \u201cWhen you go back, put in a good word for me in front of your mother. Whether the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is good depends on whether the son is good at his job.\u201d\n Li Li felt a heavy burden on his shoulders.\n His wife and mother were the two ancestors sitting on stilts. Li Li had to be impartial. Otherwise, it would be a disaster.\n In the blink of an eye, it was daytime.\n Su Beibei woke up early and changed into formal wear. She went to the breakfast shop next door with Li Li for breakfast, before parting ways with Li Li.\n Li Li drove towards Zeus while Su Beibei drove towards Wangdong High People\u2019s Court.\n There was still some time before the court hearing. She sat in the car and played with her cell phone. Song Ci and Song Fei soon arrived.\n It was Song Fei driving. Although she was skinny, she drove a mighty Hummer off-road vehicle.\n With a drift, the car stopped beside Su Beibei\u2019s car. There was no need to adjust the position. The car was parked right in the middle.\n Amazing!\n Su Beibei was dumbstruck. She thought to herself that this young lady was indeed a genius. Her driving skills were not something that ordinary women could compare to.\n Looking at Song Fei, and then at Song Ci, who was so big-chested and brainless that she could take an accelerator for a brake, Su Beibei couldn\u2019t help feeling puzzled. How can the same parents and the same egg create two sisters with so much difference in intelligence?\n Song Fei pushed open the car door, her long, skinny legs wrapped in a pair of pants. She bent over and got out, wearing a black hoodie and a baseball cap. She had been disguised as a low-profile street girl.\n This was the first time Su Beibei saw Song Fei in person. She felt that this person had the word \u2018cool\u2019 written all over her body. That cool gaze was not something that others could emulate.\n Song Ci also alighted. She was wearing high heels and a luxurious, high-end, embroidery dress. She looked like a peacock with its tail open.\n Su Beibei quickly glanced at Song Fei.\n \u201cHow long have you been here, Beibei?\u201d Song Ci walked over to Su Beibei\u2019s car. Hearing this, Song Fei also noticed Su Beibei.\n Is this the dark teenage girl who dared to play with ashes?\n Su Beibei alighted from the car. She was wearing a windbreaker, jeans, and a pair of reading glasses. She looked just like a proper female author.\n \u201cI just arrived not long ago.\u201d Su Bei lifted her chin at Song Fei and said to Song Ci, \u201cYour elder sister doesn\u2019t seem very talkative.\u201d\n Song Ci shrugged. \u201cAs long as she\u2019s ruthless.\u201d\n The three of them chatted. Most of the time, Song Ci was the one chattering away. Su Beibei asked and answered questions, while Song Fei listened coldly.\n Finally, the detention car arrived.\n The three of them stood up straight and stared at the car. Two police officers emerged from the van with Mu Mian and the rest.\n It had been more than a month since they last met. Mu Mian didn\u2019t know if it was because of the poor food at the detention center or Du Tingting\u2019s death. Mu Mian had lost a lot of weight and his cheekbones were protruding. His eyes were grey and dull. He no longer had the vigor of an old man but with a youthful mannerism.\n Mu Mian was being dragged into the court. Before he reached the top of the stairs, he turned and saw the Song sisters standing under a tree.\n Mu Mian\u2019s eyes glared at them with hatred and vengeance.\n Song Ci felt a chill run down her spine. Her lips quivered uneasily. Song Fei immediately covered Song Ci\u2019s eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t look, it\u2019ll dirty your eyes.\n Song Ci quickly shut her eyes.\n Mu Mian gazed deeply at Song Fei, who looked like she underestimated him.\n His intuition was right from the start. This Song Fei was indeed a dragon among men. She was patient, shrewd and fearless when it came to fighting.\n After staying in the detention center for such a long time, Mu Mian had thought countless times about how his meticulous plan had failed and which step had gone wrong.\n He was not stupid and quickly understood the problem.\n This Song Fei must have been pretending right from the start. She had purposely let me fall into the trap and pulled me into the pit she had dug for him. It was a pity that I was so confident and actually fell into Song Fei\u2019s trap right from the start!\n Women are truly ruthless.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\n The police officer tugged at Mu Mian. Mu Mian only had time to glance at Su Beibei, before being dragged into the court.\n Su Beibei popped a piece of chewing gum into her mouth. Ever since she quit smoking, chewing gum had become her reserve. She pouted in the direction where Mu Mian had disappeared. \u201cHis unrepentant manner is especially annoying.\u201d\n Song Ci gazed in the direction where Mu Mian disappeared with a complicated expression. She felt very sad.\n How can someone be so evil?\n \u2013\n At 9.40am, the trial officially began.\n The High People\u2019s Court only had this trial this morning. There were quite a few people at the scene\u2014the prosecutor, the witness, the defense attorney, the juror...\n All in all, there were over 20 people.\n Just when the interrogation was about to start, the main door was opened again and a frail-looking woman wearing a Chanel jacket walked in slowly.\n It was Mu Qiu, who had not appeared in public for a long time. She still looked thin but looked much more energetic. A good heart brought her health and vitality.\n Mu Qiu lowered her head slightly. She found a random seat and sat down quietly.\n Song Ci glanced at Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu detected Song Ci\u2019s gaze but didn\u2019t react. She was like a blind person, hiding in her own world and acting deaf and dumb.\n Many people recognized Mu Qiu and looked at her with complex expressions.\n Finally, the trial session began.\n \u201cBring the criminal Mu Mian.\u201d\n Mu Mian was brought in by the police. He was handcuffed at the wrists and ankles. After being brought to the court, he looked up and scanned the crowd.\n The calm expression on Mu Mian\u2019s face disappeared the moment he saw his daughter, Mu Qiu. His eyes flashed as his lips quivered slightly. Feeling guilty, he quickly turned around.\n He was too ashamed to face Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu also looked at Mu Mian. She saw that her father had lost a lot of weight and was even handcuffed. Her heart ached terribly. She couldn\u2019t tell if Du Tingting\u2019s heart was aching for him or she felt pain for him.\n One charge after another was placed on Mu Mian. As a professional, his lawyer had no choice but to give him a fair and reasonable defense.\n But the lawyer\u2019s testimony still didn\u2019t change the outcome of the trial.\n No one cheered or cried when they heard the verdict: \u201cCriminal Mu Mian will be sentenced to death immediately and deprived of political rights for life\u201d.\n They only heaved a sigh of relief, feeling a sense of gratification.\n After hearing the verdict, Mu Qiu just sat there in a daze, her ears buzzing non-stop.\n After Mu Mian was escorted out of the court, Mu Qiu snapped out of her trance and stood up. She opened the door and sprinted towards Mu Mian.\n \u201cFather!\u201d\n Mu Mian stopped in his tracks, when he heard Mu Qiu.\n The officers exchanged glances but didn\u2019t forcefully drag Mu Mian away. Mu Mian turned and looked at Mu Qiu standing in front of the court. His lips quivered as tears of regret and reluctance streamed down his face.\n \u201cQiu-er.\u201d Mu Mian told Mu Qiu with a trembling voice. \u201cQiu-er, you must live on well. Don\u2019t learn from me. You must live on with your mother\u2019s heart!\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s face was covered in tears. \u201cFather, what should I do? What should I do?\u201d My mother is dead and my father is going to be executed. Brother Mo doesn\u2019t want me anymore. What should I do?\n A myriad of emotions welled up in Mu Mian\u2019s heart as he watched his daughter cry helplessly. At that moment, he suddenly felt very regretful.\n If only everything could be redone!\n \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\n The police officers forcefully took Mu Mian away.\n Mu Mian was escorted into a car and sent to Wangdong First Prison to await further verification by the Supreme People\u2019s Court. But the impact of Mu Mian\u2019s incident was too great and he bore too many lives, so the Supreme People\u2019s Court\u2019s judgment should not change.\n Sitting in the car, Mu Mian tilted his head to look out the window. He couldn\u2019t help thinking of a question.\n If I could start all over again, would I really choose a different path?\n No, I would continue on the same path.\n A kind person would choose the path of kindness from the start. An evil person would always want to take the shortcut to commit a crime. If a tree\u2019s roots were destroyed, that tree would die sooner or later. It was the same for people.\n \u2013\n On the third day after Mu Mian was jailed, he was suddenly informed that someone had come to visit him.\n Mu Mian thought it was Mu Qiu. When he arrived at the meeting room and saw Song Ci, he instinctively narrowed his eyes in alarm. A weasel paying a New Year visit to a chicken?\n Song Ci was wearing a burgundy woolen windbreaker with cut-off ends and shoulder-length hair. She sat elegantly on a stool in the meeting room, her beauty striking.\n Mu Mian sat down quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Mu Mian said expressionlessly, \u201cAre you here to laugh at me?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cNo, I just wanted to visit you.\u201d\n Mu Mian replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about visiting me?\u201d\n \u201cOnce upon a time, Father was also very noble and handsome to me.\u201d Song Ci recalled the first time she met Mu Mian after the disaster. At that time, Mu Mian was also Song Ci\u2019s hero and a very kind-hearted person.\n \u201cI once respected and admired you. I even dreamed of marrying a kind and responsible man like you, Father.\u201d\n Song Ci was not mocking Mu Mian. She just wanted to say some heartfelt words to him before he died. She meant every word.\n Mu Mian couldn\u2019t tell if Song Ci was mocking him or if she just wanted to talk about the past. He kept silent rationally.\n \u201cFather, I couldn\u2019t believe it when I found out your true motive for adopting us. How could such a kind father be so vicious?\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s lips twitched but he remained silent.\n \u201cAfter that, I also thought it through. There is no such thing as a free lunch in this world. There is also no such thing as a benevolent person who will do good deeds without any consideration for rewards. Father, you\u2019re not a good person. It is just that I treated you as a good person. I was blind to have trusted the wrong person.\u201d\n After hearing so much from Song Ci, Mu Mian finally had the urge to speak. He recalled the joyous laughter that Song Ci brought to the house after she moved in and his expression softened.\n \u201cI never thought of touching you,\u201d Mu Mian said.\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cI believe you.\u201d You never wanted to kill me, but if you really had no choice, you would still kill me.\n \u201cYou are the child that I have raised for eight years. From the start, I did harbor ill intentions towards you until we got along day and night. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have any feelings for you. But Song Song, Mu Qiu is my real child. I cannot just stand by and watch her die.\u201d\n \u201cBetween her and your elder sister Song Fei, of course I have to choose my daughter.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t comment on his words. She only asked, \u201cIf, I mean if, without my elder sister, if only my heart is compatible with Mu Qiu, will you also lay your hands on me?\u201d\n Mu Mian narrowed his eyes and remained silent.\n He was admitting to it silently.\n \u201cI understand.\u201d Song Ci shook her head and laughed.\n Mu Mian sighed with emotion. He told Song Ci, \u201cSong Song, you must understand that adopted daughters are different from biological daughters.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled mockingly. \u201cOf course I understand.\u201d She suddenly said, \u201cFather, you hired someone to cause my accident, right?\u201d\n Mu Mian\u2019s brows twitched. He remained silent.\n \u201cBecause my elder sister went missing and you couldn\u2019t find a suitable heart, you attacked me. The doctor in the ambulance was Zhu Yuanwen, right? You planned it well but didn\u2019t expect Han Zhan to appear out of nowhere and ruin your meticulous plan.\u201d\n Now that his scheme had been seen through, Mu Mian couldn\u2019t be bothered to pretend anymore. \u201cYes, I did it.\u201d Since he had already been sentenced to death, there was no difference even if he added another crime of attempted murder.\n Since he admitted it openly, Song Ci didn\u2019t know how to scold him. It was pointless to rebuke someone like Mu Mian.\n At this moment, Mu Mian suddenly spoke up. \u201cThe person who woke up from the convalescent hospital in the middle of the night isn\u2019t Song Fei. It must be you.\u201d\n Song Ci glanced at Mu Mian mildly. She neither admitted nor retorted.\n \u201cLooks like I guessed correctly. Song Song, I am very curious.\u201d Mu Mian leaned forward, his face almost touching the glass.\n His dark eyes widened as he stared unblinkingly at Song Ci like a ravenous wolf. \u201cWhen did you discover my plan?\u201d This was a question that Mu Mian couldn\u2019t figure out.\n Naturally, Song Ci wouldn\u2019t tell Mu Mian about his rebirth.\n She said, \u201cInstinct.\u201d\n Mu Mian looked at her suspiciously. He didn\u2019t believe that intuition could be so heaven-defying. It seemed like Song Ci also had secrets that he didn\u2019t know.\n \u201cYou came to look for me today just to lay your cards on the table?\u201d Mu Mian took a step back and said tiredly, \u201cWe\u2019ve already spoken. You can leave now.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t just want to lay my cards on the table with you.\u201d Song Ci smiled enigmatically.\n Mu Mian felt uneasy as he stared at her smile.\n Mu Mian frowned when he saw Song Ci taking out a tablet from her bag. What is she doing? Knowing that I\u2019m about to die, she\u2019s going to play a small movie for me?\n \u201cFather, I hope you won\u2019t be too shocked after seeing this.\u201d Song Ci opened her laptop and played a video. She flipped it over and pointed it toward Mu Mian.\n There was a voice in Mu Mian\u2019s heart telling him: Don\u2019t look! You must not look!\n But everyone had their own curiosity, especially someone like Mu Mian who was full of schemes. He couldn\u2019t help but lift his eyes and watch the video.\n At a glance, Mu Mian recognized that the video was of his own home. He frowned. \u201cYou actually installed surveillance cameras in my house!\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cHow can I be at ease if I don\u2019t monitor you guys closely?\u201d\n Mu Mian looked at Song Ci with surprise and seriousness. \u201cSong Ci, I have underestimated you.\u201d He had always treated Song Ci as a silly little girl. He didn\u2019t expect this little girl to change his impression of her.\n The surveillance footage was rather long and Mu Mian couldn\u2019t tell what it was. He asked Song Ci impatiently, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise for you.\u201d\n Mu Mian glared fiercely at Song Ci before continuing to watch the video.\n Mu Mian\u2019s lashes quivered slightly when he saw his wife, Du Tingting. The whites of his eyes were slightly red. \u201cTing... Tingting...\u201d\n Thinking of Du Tingting, Mu Mian\u2019s heart suddenly ached.\n Du Tingting\u2019s death was a permanent pain in Mu Mian\u2019s heart.\n He saw that Du Tingting\u2019s clothes looked rather familiar. She would even stroke her own belly from time to time. Mu Mian seemed to realize something and murmured. \u201cThis is the day she fell and had a miscarriage?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Mu Mian focused on the video as various thoughts flashed across his mind.\n Song Ci would never let me see anything useless. She had specially edited the surveillance footage from the day of Tingting\u2019s miscarriage for me to see. This meant one thing:\n Tingting\u2019s miscarriage is most likely not an accident!\n With such a doubtful attitude, Mu Mian\u2019s heart thumped as he watched Du Tingting walk down the stairs.\n Mu Mian\u2019s entire body tensed up when he saw Mu Qiu applying the facial cream to the middle of the staircase.\n Mu Mian felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He clenched his fists so tightly that his eyes bulged. \u201cHow could it be her?\u201d\n Mu Mian broke down completely when he saw Du Tingting step onto the staircase that Mu Qiu had tampered with and fall down, bleeding profusely.\n \u201cImpossible!\u201d He pounded the table in front of him with both hands. Song Ci felt very comforted at the sight of his bloodshot eyes.\n Song Ci closed the laptop and stuffed it back into her bag.\n She calmly admired Mu Mian\u2019s reaction. At this point, he was like a mentally ill patient. His eyes were bloodshot as he repeated the same sentence over and over again:\n Impossible.\n Song Ci spoke softly, interrupting the lunatic\u2019s ravings. \u201cHow is that impossible?\u201d\n Mu Mian shut his mouth and slowly lifted his head to stare at Song Ci.\n Song Ci\u2019s expression was almost sorrowful. She said in a low voice, \u201cHow is that impossible? She has been your only daughter for 20 years and her days are numbered. The arrival of a new life now is a blow and betrayal to her.\u201d\n \u201cAs long as one is human, one will be jealous and unwilling. How can Mu Qiu tolerate that child\u2019s existence?\u201d\n \u201cIt is an instinct for a person to want to live. If Mu Qiu wants you to help her live, the only way is to make that child disappear so that she can once again be the apple of your eye.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, you will definitely commit a crime and kill to save her.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s lips twitched as a chill ran down her spine, as she was terrified by Mu Qiu\u2019s viciousness. \u201cFather, think about it. Did Mu Qiu hint at you to go after Song Fei?\u201d\n Mu Mian fell silent.\n Although he refused to believe that his kind-hearted daughter would harm her biological mother, Song Ci\u2019s words were very reasonable.\n With the video as evidence, Mu Mian was unable to clear Mu Qiu\u2019s name.\n In Mu Mian\u2019s eyes, Mu Qiu was pure, obedient, and kind. He always felt that his daughter had inherited his wife\u2019s kindness and purity.\n But he didn\u2019t realize that Mu Qiu still had the same despicable, vicious blood as him in her.\n I dared to kill my father back then and Mu Qiu dared to kill her mother!\n \u201cHow could this be?\u201d Mu Mian couldn\u2019t understand. I wanted to kill my father because he was never a good person. But how good was Tingting to Mu Qiu? She was willing to sacrifice her life for Mu Qiu!\n How can Mu Qiu bear to kill such a good mother!\n Mu Mian couldn\u2019t understand.\n He grabbed his own hair so hard that it fell off.\n [fuzzy]Song Ci suddenly added. \u201cIf Mother knew that the child\u2019s departure was not an accident but was planned by Mu Qiu, would she still be willing to give her heart to Mu Qiu?\u201d\n \u201cI really feel bad for mother.\u201d\n Song Ci stood up and gazed deeply into Mu Mian\u2019s eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t come visit you again. Father, rest in peace.\u201d\n Rest in peace. I wish you a happy family in your next life and I hope that you\u2019ll be an upright and kind person.\n After Song Ci left, Mu Mian remained silent for a long time.\n Twenty days later, the Supreme People\u2019s Court verified Mu Mian\u2019s case. The trial results did not change and the death penalty was carried out immediately.\n Mu Mian\u2019s execution date was set to be five days later. He would be executed by shooting.\n On the second day after the verdict, Mu Qiu was finally allowed to visit Mu Mian. Mu Qiu arrived at the meeting room and looked at Mu Mian with a smile that was even uglier than a crying face.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s heart ached as she looked at her father\u2019s pale hair and the sudden creases on his face. She wept bitterly.\n Mu Mian looked at the sobbing Mu Qiu and remained silent.\n Two months had passed since the operation and Mu Qiu had fully recovered. In his hurried glance just now, she looked rather rosy. Hearing his daughter\u2019s sobs, Mu Mian really wanted to ask Mu Qiu: Why did you do that to your mother?\n But he endured it.\n After crying for a while, Mu Qiu picked up the phone.\n Mu Mian also picked up the phone. Mu Qiu called out. \u201cFather.\u201d\n He nodded slightly.\n Mu Qiu suddenly didn\u2019t know what to say. She clearly had a lot to say but didn\u2019t know where to start.\n Mu Mian suddenly asked her, \u201cHow is your heart?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was stunned for a moment before nodding. \u201cAll good. No obvious rejection.\u201d\n \u201cThat is your mother\u2019s heart. Why would she reject you?\u201d Mu Mian looked at his daughter\u2019s face that looked like his wife, and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cI have hated many people in my life and harmed many others. But I have truly loved and protected your mother my entire life.\u201d\n Mu Qiu nodded. \u201cI know. I know that Father loves Mother the most.\u201d\n Mu Mian continued. \u201cIn my entire life, I have never hit your mother, not even once. In our 20 plus years of marriage, we only quarreled a few times during our first two years.\u201d\n Mu Qiu listened quietly as tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.\n \u201cWhen she gave birth to you, I couldn\u2019t bear for her to be in pain and specially brought her overseas for a painless delivery. She was Wangdong\u2019s first woman to have a painless delivery. Other women all said that your mother was too pretentious. Who doesn\u2019t experience pain during childbirth? But I know that although they said your mother was pretentious, they must be very envious of her.\u201d\n Mu Qiu didn\u2019t understand why Mu Mian suddenly brought this up. She listened in confusion and didn\u2019t dare to interrupt.\n Mu Qiu suddenly changed the topic. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to see your mother suffer at all, but you caused her to bleed profusely and you nearly took her life!\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s body stiffened as her face paled.\n Mu Mian tightened his grip on the phone and glared at Mu Qiu. He suddenly cursed. \u201cMu Qiu, you are inhuman! You are a beast! That is your mother! Your mother who couldn\u2019t fall asleep the entire night when she was pregnant with you and whose legs were so swollen that she couldn\u2019t walk during the third trimester! Your mother whose breast you bit while she was breastfeeding! How vicious are you to lay your hands on her!\u201d\n \u201cMu Qiu! I was wrong about you! I really regret doing all this for you! If your mother knew your true colors, she would definitely be bitterly disappointed. She would never leave her heart for you!\u201d\n \u201cMu Qiu, you beast! You animal!\u201d\n \u201cReturn your mother to me!\u201d\n Mu Mian went crazy and started scolding Mu Qiu.\n Mu Qiu was so scared that she didn\u2019t move. She was trembling.\n The prison guard heard the commotion and hurriedly opened the door. He rushed in and grabbed the agitated Mu Mian. \u201cCalm down! Mu Mian, calm down!\u201d\n Mu Mian totally couldn\u2019t hear what the prison guards were saying. He glared fiercely at the dazed Mu Qiu and cursed her. \u201cMu Qiu, I curse you to die a terrible death. You heartless thing. I really regret having you with your mother back then! You ingrate!\u201d\n Mu Mian was dragged away by the prison guards as he cursed.\n Mu Qiu stood there in a daze, Mu Mian\u2019s scolding still ringing in her ears. Mu Qiu was so scared that her heart was about to stop beating. She pressed her chest and thought fearfully, Is Mother angry?\n Mu Qiu returned to the car with unsteady steps. Her hands were trembling badly. She didn\u2019t dare to drive and just laid down on the car seat.\n After a long, long time, Mu Qiu finally calmed down.\n When she calmed down, she thought of a question.\n How did Father know about that?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "192": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-193\n\n Chapter 192: Song Ci VS Mu Qiu  Mu Qiu felt that she had done it secretly. Moreover, it had been so long. How did my father know the truth?\n Who told him?\n How did that person know?\n At this moment, the agent suddenly called and said that there was a buyer who wanted to see the house.\n The reason why she decided to sell the house was firstly because it was too luxurious to live in such a big house alone. Secondly, the house was too big and she needed to hire helpers to clean it, and it would be a necessary expense.\n Of course, Mu Qiu was not short of money. These were not the main reasons why she decided to sell the house. The real reason was that Mu Qiu was always ill at ease staying in this house. She would suffer from insomnia all night long and her body would not be able to take it in the long run. Moreover, because of her guilty conscience, she still did not dare to go up to the second floor.\n The Amethyst Gated Community was built 16 years ago and was considered an old villa community in Wangdong City. Although it had been around for a long time, due to its good geographical location and quiet environment, the design of the house was still in trend, so the house was still relatively easy to sell.\n A few days ago, Mu Qiu had asked a real estate agent to sell her house, and someone had already expressed interest today.\n After hanging up, Mu Qiu hurriedly drove home to personally receive the buyer.\n The buyer was a businessman who had just returned from overseas. He had taken a fancy to Mu Qiu\u2019s house, but had also heard of what had happened to the Mu Family during this period. He felt that it was a haunted house.\n Indeed, in just a few short months, the male protagonist was sentenced to death, the female protagonist suddenly died of cerebral hemorrhage, and her only daughter also suffered from a heart disease.\n No matter how one looked at it, this house was a haunted house.\n The villa in the Amethyst Gated Community was priced at least 40 million yuan. In the past, this villa of the Mu Family would have been priced at 60 million yuan. Mu Qiu also knew that it was not easy to sell her own villa and didn\u2019t put a high price. Instead, she priced it at 50 million yuan.\n The buyer told Mu Qiu, \u201cMiss Mu, your house is inauspicious. It has bad fengshui and is a haunted house. But I am a very lucky person and can handle a haunted house. Can you give me a few million yuan more discount?\u201d\n Mu Qiu\u2019s brows twitched. Who gave him the guts to ask her to give a discount of a few million yuan the moment he spoke?\n Mu Qiu could have opened the door to send him off, but...\n \u201c45 million yuan. It can\u2019t be any lower. If you don\u2019t want to buy it, forget it.\u201d Mu Qiu just wanted to sell this house as soon as possible, as long as the housing prices would not cause her a loss.\n \u201cDeal!\u201d\n Mu Qiu also had a house in the city area. She planned to move into that house. Mu Qiu would also continue to hire Auntie Zhang to cook and clean for her. Her salary was 10,000 yuan a month. It was slightly lower than her previous salary, but there was also less work to do.\n Since Auntie Zhang was nostalgic and couldn\u2019t bear to part with Mu Qiu, she agreed without any objections.\n After selling the villa at the real estate office, Mu Qiu and Auntie Zhang went home to pack up their belongings. All the antiques in the house had been sold off by Mu Qiu at the auction house. The rest were family photos.\n Mu Qiu told Auntie Zhang, \u201cAuntie Zhang, please help me put away my parents\u2019 wedding photos and art photos. We will bring them to our new home.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After going up and down several times, Auntie Zhang was almost done cleaning up. There was only one set left \u2014\n \u201cThat painting hung on the wall of the staircase landing is the most satisfactory artistic photo that Madam took when she was alive. You must bring it with you. I will go and bring it over. Miss, you can hold it for me from below.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang went to the tool shed to find a ladder and moved it to the corner platform in the stairwell.\n Mu Qiu stood at the bottom of the stairs, supporting herself on the spot where Du Tingting had laid that day. Mu Qiu couldn\u2019t help thinking of the day Du Tingting had a miscarriage. She felt like her feet were stepping on her mother\u2019s blood.\n Leaning against the ladder, Mu Qiu\u2019s face suddenly turned pale.\n Auntie Zhang was only focused on taking the photo and didn\u2019t notice anything unusual about Mu Qiu. She wiped the photo from the front and was about to put it into the box when she suddenly noticed a small object. She hurriedly waved at Mu Qiu. \u201cMiss, quickly come and see what this is?\u201d\n Mu Qiu leaned over and recognized what it was. Her face darkened. \u201cIt\u2019s a pinhole camera.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang\u2019s expression also changed drastically.\n Who was so immoral to install a surveillance camera in the house!\n Mu Qiu took off that camera and held it in her palm. Staring at the camera, Mu Qiu said to the person behind the camera, \u201cWho are you? If you don\u2019t contact me on your own accord, I will call the police.\u201d With that, Mu Qiu threw the pinhole camera to the ground and trampled on it.\n It was illegal to break into a house and install surveillance cameras to monitor someone\u2019s house.\n After transporting the items to her new home with Auntie Zhang, Mu Qiu returned to the Mu Family residence. Sitting alone in the empty living room with only the sofa, she felt that the house was very shady, as if someone was blowing cold air beside her ear.\n She had a guilty conscience and suspected that there was something else in this house other than her. Mu Qiu knew that she was scaring herself, but she still felt anxious.\n The night was silent. Mu Qiu suddenly heard a strange sound coming from upstairs. That tapping sound was especially similar to the sound of Du Tingting walking down the corridor in slippers.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s breathing was unstable.\n It\u2019s all fake. There are no ghosts in this world. Don\u2019t scare yourself. Mu Qiu comforted herself.\n Knock knock.\n The sudden knock on the door scared Mu Qiu.\n She turned to look at the main door. Realizing that it was the person she had been waiting for, Mu Qiu heaved a long sigh. \u201cPlease come in. The door isn\u2019t closed.\u201d Her voice was slightly flustered.\n The door was pushed open and the cold wind rushed into the house and into Mu Qiu\u2019s neck. Mu Qiu hunched her shoulders and narrowed her eyes as she stared at the door.\n It was Song Ci.\n It was a cold winter night and Song Ci was wearing a down jacket that was better than knee-length knee-length boots. That ginger-colored down jacket looked like a thick layer of cotton wool on others, but on Song Ci, it looked like a custom-made suit and was full of charm.\n She strode gracefully into the Mu Family residence.\n The sofa opposite Mu Qiu was empty. She pushed a cup of hot tea over and said to Song Ci, \u201cI guessed it was you. The hot tea is ready. Have a seat, Elder Sister.\u201d\n Song Ci walked in and sat down on the sofa. She looked down at the glass of water and suddenly asked, \u201cThere\u2019s no poison in here, right?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was pouring herself a cup of tea. Hearing this, her hand trembled and the tea splashed onto the table. She put down the teapot, picked up her own cup, took a sip, and said, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve already drunk it.\u201d\n Song Ci spread out her hands and said in an infuriating manner, \u201cYou have nothing to worry about anymore. So what if you die? I have a husband who dotes on me and an elder sister who protects me. It\u2019s not strange that you want to drag me down with you even in death. After all, you are a jealous woman.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was speechless.\n Song Ci was very satisfied to see that Mu Qiu was at a loss for words. She took out a small white thermos from the pocket of her down jacket.\n She opened the cup and shook it before saying, \u201cBrother Han made me chrysanthemum tea, so I won\u2019t drink yours.\u201d Saying that, she looked up and took a sip.\n Mu Qiu was amused by her antics. \u201cYou\u2019re so annoying. Your mouth stinks.\u201d\n Song Ci retorted. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have a foul mouth than a dark heart.\u201d\n \u201cElder Sister, don\u2019t talk about such nonsense. Let me ask you, when did you set up surveillance cameras at my house?\u201d This was what Mu Qiu was most concerned about. When she discovered those surveillance cameras in the day, Mu Qiu felt a chill run down her spine. Every time she thought of how her every action at home was being observed by others, she hated it to the core.\n At this point, there was nothing Song Ci couldn\u2019t say. \u201cAfter I cohabited with Brother Han, I came back to get something and took the opportunity to install it.\u201d\n Mu Qiu was shocked. \u201cYou already knew about my father\u2019s plan then? I thought...\u201d\n \u201cYou still thought that after you tried to kill me that night and let me off in a moment of weakness, I won\u2019t find another opportunity to monitor you two?\u201d Song Ci finished Mu Qiu\u2019s sentence.\n Mu Qiu nodded with uncertainty. \u201cSo you knew what happened that night.\u201d\n Song Ci sneered. \u201cAm I an idiot? How can I not notice a small scar on my chest?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s heart thumped as she recalled what happened that night.\n Mu Qiu took a sip of water. She gazed past the steam rising from the hot tea and looked at the calm and elegant Song Ci. She felt that Song Ci was quite a scary person. \u201cYou already knew that I wanted to kill you, but you still pretended to be close to me in the future. Elder Sister, you really surprised me.\u201d\n \u201cThis is nothing.\u201d Song Ci took out a flash drive and waved it in front of Mu Qiu. \u201cThe things inside will definitely shock you even more.\u201d\n Mu Qiu stared at the USB drive and guessed what was inside. She asked calmly, \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI can kill you. You know that very well.\u201d\n Mu Qiu said, \u201cWho do you think you are? Do you think you can just kill people like that?\u201d\n Song Ci waved the USB stick again and said slowly, \u201cI have video evidence of you murdering your mother and her child. Once I release this evidence, everyone will see the true colors of the Mu Family\u2019s daughter, especially your beloved Cheng Yanmo.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, the mentally ill Miss Mu will be discovered to have died in a car accident, taken poison, drowned, or even committed suicide by jumping off a building. In short, there are countless ways to die in this world. No one will suspect you if you died in any way.\u201d\n \u201cAfter all, in just two to three months, you have endured the pain of your mother\u2019s death, the pain of your father\u2019s death, as well as the pain of your own reputation being tarnished. It\u2019s very normal for such a young lady to seek death.\u201d\n \u201cDo you think my analysis makes sense, Mu Qiu?\u201d As she spoke, Song Ci\u2019s expression was sinister and sinister.\n This is a clear threat!\n After hearing Song Ci\u2019s threatening words, Mu Qiu\u2019s originally calm eyes were now filled with uneasiness. In the end, even her pupils started to tremble.\n Song Ci smiled like a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, her eyes narrowed into crescents. For the first time, Mu Qiu realized that this woman was not to be trifled with. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Since Song Ci was willing to meet her, she must have left a way out for her.\n Song Ci kept the flash drive.\n She looked around the house. After living in this house for eight years, Song Ci had poured all her love into this house. Thinking of the deceased Du Tingting and the 18.88 million yuan in her bank account, Song Ci\u2019s heart, which should have been as cold as iron, softened.\n \u201cI won\u2019t push you into a corner, but I won\u2019t let you be free and unrestrained either...\u201d After all, if Mu Qiu was too unrestrained, Song Ci would be very troubled. Changing the topic, Song Ci suddenly said,\u201d Mu Qiu, do as I say and I will destroy this video. \u201d\n Mu Qiu looked at her in confusion. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cFather will be executed tomorrow. I want you to go to the execution ground and personally send him off!\u201d\n \u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d Mu Qiu shot to her feet and glared at Song Ci in disbelief. She never expected Song Ci to make such a request. \u201cImpossible, I won\u2019t go!\u201d Mu Qiu would never agree to let her personally witness her father\u2019s execution.\n Song Ci glanced at her mildly and said, \u201cI said, I want you to observe Father being executed tomorrow.\u201d\n Mu Qiu instinctively shook her head. \u201cNo, no way! How can you let me witness my father\u2019s execution with my own two eyes? Song Ci, you are too vicious!\u201d Mu Qiu grabbed the cup of tea on the table and was about to splash it at Song Ci. Song Ci ducked and quickly picked up the cup of water in front of her and splashed it on Mu Qiu\u2019s face.\n The tea was cold and splashed on her face. Mu Qiu shuddered. She wiped the tea off her face and vaguely saw Song Ci walking towards her.\n Mu Qiu\u2019s chin was grabbed by Song Ci. She wiped her eyes again before looking at Song Ci\u2019s face. Song Ci\u2019s expression was cold and she looked at Mu Qiu with extreme disgust, as if she was looking at a smelly bug. \u201cI\u2019ve long wanted to do this. I wonder if this cup of tea has splashed you awake?\u201d\n Mu Qiu glared at her indignantly and remained silent.\n Song Ci suddenly dragged Mu Qiu towards the mirror hanging on the wall of the entryway. Song Ci was tall and she often exercised, so her arms were very strong. She was much more energetic than the sickly Mu Qiu. She easily dragged Mu Qiu to the mirror.\n Song Ci made Mu Qiu stare into the mirror.\n Mu Qiu looked up at the mirror and saw the pathetic her and the high and mighty Song Ci.\n Song Ci stared at Mu Qiu in the mirror. \u201cMu Qiu, look at yourself in the mirror. Look at how black your heart is! Look at how beautiful and pure you are, but your heart is the blackest thing I have ever seen!\u201d\n \u201cI really feel sorry for Mother.. She still loves you even in death and wants to give you her heart. But what about you? You can even harm your own mother. How can there be someone like you in this world!\u201d\n \u201cKeep an eye on the mirror and let yourself see just how black your heart is! Are you made of flesh or not?!\u201d\n Mu Qiu stared at her own reflection in the mirror in a daze. She realized that her eyes were flashing and she didn\u2019t dare to look straight at her reflection.\n As she watched, tears suddenly streamed down Mu Qiu\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t know if it was because she was scared by Song Ci or if it was because she regretted doing those foolish things.\n Song Ci released Mu Qiu and she sat down on the floor.\n \u201cMu Qiu, if you don\u2019t go to the execution grounds tomorrow, I will send this video to Cheng Yanmo, to our shared WeChat group, and to my homepage. I will let everyone see just how hypocritical, despicable, and disgusting this innocent young lady from the Mu Family is!\u201d\n Song Ci returned to the living room, picked up her white thermos, and left without looking back.\n Mu Qiu gazed at the beautiful young lady in the mirror. For the first time in her life, she felt like a stranger*. Since when did I become a person who will do anything just to live?*\n \u2013\n About 11pm on the night before the execution, Mu Mian was brought out of the cell. He was guarded by two armed police officers, a judiciary and a police officer. They chatted with him.\n This was the beauty before death.\n At this point, criminals were usually allowed to make requests. As long as they weren\u2019t too rude, they would be satisfied. But Mu Mian just sat quietly in his chair. He didn\u2019t cry or throw a tantrum. He was so calm that he didn\u2019t seem like a criminal about to be executed.\n The few public servants who were in charge of watching over him looked at each other. They all felt that this person was the most quiet and cooperative death row criminal they had ever seen in their lives.\n It was 2am at night and the staff were all feeling rather sleepy. They perked up and asked Mu Mian, \u201cIf you have any last words, you can tell us.\u201d\n Mu Mian glanced at them and shook his head.\n Last words?\n I didn\u2019t have that kind of thing.\n There\u2019s no one left in this world worthy of my final words. Although Mu Qiu was still alive, in Mu Mian\u2019s heart, his and Du Tingting\u2019s daughter were already dead.\n \u201cThen, is there anything you want to eat?\u201d\n Mu Mian was about to shake his head but suddenly stopped. He thought for a moment and said, \u201cI want a bowl of beef noodles.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, we will make it for you now!\u201d\n 20 minutes later, a bowl of fragrant beef noodles was placed on the table in front of Mu Mian. They even thoughtfully brought over a small bowl of chili sauce. \u201cIf you want to eat chili, add it yourself. The chef is worried that you won\u2019t eat spicy food.\u201d\n Mu Mian shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t eat spicy food.\u201d\n He stared at the bowl of noodles in silence for a while, before picking up his chopsticks and putting it into his mouth. As he chewed, Mu Mian\u2019s movements became slower and slower.\n Seeing that he didn\u2019t seem very satisfied, the staff was very patient. \u201cWhy? Does it not suit your taste? Shall we get another chef to cook for you?\u201d\n Tears suddenly welled up in Mu Mian\u2019s eyes. He gazed at the bowl of noodles, at the garlic fruit inside, and suddenly said softly, \u201cMy wife knows I don\u2019t like garlic. She never puts garlic in the beef noodles that she makes for me.\u201d\n Everyone in the room fell silent.\n Mu Mian still finished the bowl of noodles.\n After finishing his noodles, he remained silent and closed his eyes, as if he was about to fall asleep.\n Only when the sun rose did he open his eyes and stare fearfully at the dazzling rays of the morning sun outside the house. This was the last time he saw the rising sun in his life. It was beautiful, but not as spectacular as the sunrise he and Du Tingting had seen on their first trip to Mount Huang.\n At this moment, the armed police opened the door and walked in. They started tying Mu Mian up. They called this a \u201cexecution rope\u201d. After tying him up, they placed a wooden plaque on the back of Mu Mian\u2019s neck. On it was written \u201cExecute Murderer Mu Mian\u201d and a red cross.\n After the forensic doctor came over to verify Mu Mian\u2019s identity, Mu Mian was brought to the public trial. Once the trial ended, Mu Mian was brought to the execution grounds in a large van with a license plate.\n The car sped along the road with high alert.\n \u2013\n Mu Qiu, who had also not rested the entire night, looked very fatigued. Her skin also looked slightly dull and lusterless. She leaned against the head of the bed and stared at the white horizon outside the window. She was struggling internally.\n After thinking for a long while, Mu Qiu finally got out of bed. She opened the wardrobe and chose a black down jacket for herself.\n She decided to listen to Song Ci\u2019s threat and go to the execution grounds.\n Song Ci knew very well that although Mu Qiu and Cheng Yanmo had broken up, Cheng Yanmo was still the man that Mu Qiu loved the most. Mu Qiu was most afraid of letting Cheng Yanmo know of her evil deeds. Mu Qiu didn\u2019t want Cheng Yanmo to see her, Mu Qiu, as a vicious beast apart from being a murderer\u2019s daughter.\n Song Ci had truly seen through Mu Qiu and grasped her greatest weakness, forcing her to give in.\n Mu Qiu was stopped by Long Yu, who had been waiting downstairs for a long time. \u201cMiss Mu, Madam asked me to wait for you here and send you over.\u201d\n Mu Qiu recognized Long Yu. He was Song Ci\u2019s driver.\n As Mu Qiu was against Song Ci, she did not have a good attitude toward Long Yu either. Mu Qiu sneered at Long Yu. \u201cYou are such an obedient dog.\u201d With that, she got into the car.\n The good dog Long Yu drove the car out of the city area. Seeing that there weren\u2019t many cars, he started drifting. By the time the car stopped, Mu Qiu\u2019s face had already turned pale. She pushed open the car door, got out, and vomited.\n Long Yu alighted and glanced disdainfully at the disheveled Mu Qiu. He said, \u201cEven if I am a dog, I am a loyal dog that will never betray its owner. But you, Miss Mu, are a street rat that everyone hates.\u201d\n Mu Qiu vomited until there was nothing left but sour juice before finally stopping. She stood up slowly and mocked Long Yu. \u201cWho do you think you are!\u201d With that, she saw two people walk out of the execution grounds.\n ]She quickly shut her mouth and stared at the two of them uneasily.\n Long Yu said a few words to them and took out his identity card to show them. After confirming that Long Yu was the person Old Master Han specially approved to observe the execution process, they brought Long Yu and Mu Qiu into the execution grounds.\n Standing in the middle of a desolate plot of land, Mu Qiu shuddered at the thought of how many people had died here.\n It was nearly noon and Mu Qiu felt increasingly uneasy. About 10 minutes later, Mu Qiu heard the sound of a car approaching from afar.\n She hurriedly turned to look in the direction of the sound of the car and saw two cars driving rapidly towards the execution grounds. One was a large van with a plaque and the other was a van.\n Realizing that her father was sitting in that huge van and about to be shot, Mu Qiu\u2019s face paled.\n The car came to a stop at the entrance of the execution grounds. The escorts and the two shooters alighted and said to the officer-in-charge, \u201cThe murderer, Mu Mian, has been brought over. Wait for further instructions!\u201d\n The commander lifted a finger and pointed at the desolate land.\n The escort immediately dragged Mu Mian out of the car. Mu Qiu covered her lips when she saw Mu Mian tied up tightly. She said hoarsely, \u201cFather...\u201d\n Mu Mian seemed to have heard her. He looked over at Mu Qiu. Unexpectedly, he saw Mu Qiu at the execution grounds. Mu Mian\u2019s pupils constricted, but they were quickly replaced by indifference.\n Mu Mian was forced to his knees by them. The moment his knees touched the ground, Mu Mian truly felt the approach of the grim reaper. At that moment, Mu Mian suddenly felt somewhat afraid and started to tremble.\n Sensing the change in Mu Mian\u2019s mood, the escort hurriedly grabbed his shoulders tightly, not allowing him to move much.\n The commander asked, \u201cIs everything ready?\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d\n The commander waved the small flag and the sniper placed the rifle\u2019s tip on Mu Mian\u2019s chest. Seeing that all preparations were complete, the commander shouted \u201crelease\u201d and the shooter pulled the trigger!\n Bang!\n Mu Mian\u2019s eyes widened as his upper body collapsed to the ground. His head moved a few times before he stopped breathing. No one knew if he ever regretted his actions the moment the bullet pierced his body.\n From the time Mu Mian arrived at the execution grounds to the time he stopped breathing, the entire process took less than three minutes!\n So quick and heartless!\n The justice of heaven was long and unbreakable. Anyone who committed evil would be punished by the heavens. This was Mu Mian\u2019s ending.\n This was also Mu Qiu\u2019s first time seeing a living person die so quickly and so tragically in front of her. It was as if she had suffered a serious injury. Her body trembled violently and she was so scared that she peed her pants.\n Father is dead!\n I had indirectly caused his death!\n I was selfish and wanted to live on. I had purposely hinted at him to commit a crime and murder. That was why my father had been arrested! My mother had passed away in a fit of rage because my father had been arrested!\n I\u2019m the one who destroyed this family!\n Mu Qiu refused to accept this fact.\n Mu Qiu snapped out of her trance and fell to the ground. She stared at Mu Mian, who was sprawled on the ground, and finally broke down in tears.\n That person was her father! Her father who would place her on a horse\u2019s back when she was young. Her father who would bring her to the principal\u2019s office to seek justice after she was bullied by her classmates!\n Trembling, Mu Qiu crawled toward Mu Mian. No one stopped her.\n \u201cFather!\u201d Mu Qiu hugged Mu Mian\u2019s corpse and flipped him over.\n Mu Qiu was momentarily stunned, when she saw Mu Mian\u2019s twisted face and the bloody wound on his chest. She hurriedly pressed her hand against his chest to stop the blood. However, the blood kept gushing out like an out-of-control tap and quickly drenched Mu Qiu\u2019s hand.\n Mu Qiu was scared witless by this scene, which was similar to the one where Du Tingting bled profusely from her miscarriage.\n \u201cFather, Father! I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, Father!\u201d Mu Qiu laid her head on Mu Mian\u2019s shoulder and cried bitterly.\n Long Yu watched this scene coldly. He picked up his cell phone and sent Song Ci a message.\n It was noon and the sun was shining brightly. It was warm and comforting. Song Ci wasn\u2019t wearing a jacket. She was only wearing a long fur dress and leggings. She sat by the French window and gazed out at the distant suburbs.\n Song Fei, who was sitting on her sofa, glanced at the black clock on the wall. She suddenly said, \u201cIt\u2019s already noon.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart suddenly stopped beating.\n She stared at the sky in the suburbs, turned back, and said to Song Fei, \u201cHe\u2019s dead, Song Fei. We\u2019ve finally gotten our revenge.\u201d But she didn\u2019t feel the joy of getting her revenge.\n Song Fei got up and walked to the French window. She crossed her arms and looked at the bustling city bathed in the sunlight. After a long while, she finally gave a soft grunt. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cStrange, I don\u2019t feel any pleasure.\u201d\n Song Fei looked down at her and asked, \u201cAre you pitying him?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cI will never pity a murderer. I just feel rather emotional.\u201d Just then, Song Ci received a new message on her cell phone. She opened it.\n Song Fei asked her, \u201cWho is that?\u201d\n \u201cLong Yu.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n \u201cMu Mian has already been executed. Mu Qiu has broken down and is scared witless.\u201d\n Hearing Mu Qiu\u2019s name, Song Fei frowned in disgust. \u201cSong Ci, you are still not ruthless enough.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t retort.\n Song Fei told Song Ci, \u201cIf I were you, I would publicize Mu Qiu\u2019s actions. She will definitely die in my hands in the end.\u201d This was Song Fei. She was vengeful and petty. She would take revenge on anyone who bullied her.\n \u201cYes, I am soft-hearted.\u201d Song Ci also hated herself for being so soft-hearted. She said, \u201cI wanted to kill Mu Qiu, but Song Fei, whenever I think of Du Tingting, my heart softens.\u201d\n \u201cLittle fool, you\u2019ll be bullied for your kindness.\u201d\n Song Ci remained silent.\n Song Fei sighed. She stroked Song Ci\u2019s hair. Only when Song Ci was sitting like this would she stroke her hair.\n Being short was a hard wound.\n \u201cForget it, continue being stupid. I will protect you.\u201d I\u2019m your elder sister after all.\n Song Ci was exceptionally moved and decided to drink a beer.\n Song Ci happily took out her beer. Song Fei\u2019s gaze was cold. She snatched the beer away and said sternly, \u201cYou are preparing for pregnancy recently and drinking ice will reduce your chances of pregnancy.\u201d\n Song Ci widened her eyes. \u201cHow did you know I was preparing for pregnancy?\u201d\n Song Fei analyzed calmly. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing you these few days and you have hickeys all over your body. This means that the two of you have been having a lot of sex. If it\u2019s too frequent, you should be trying to make a baby.\u201d\n \u201cSo.\u201d Song Fei stuffed the ice-cold beer back into the fridge, leaned against it, and asked Song Ci, \u201cAre you guys creating a little person?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s ears turned red.\n There was nothing Song Fei didn\u2019t understand, upon seeing this.\n Song Fei told Song Ci, \u201cI\u2019ve done some research. The positions during pregnancy preparation are actually very important. I made a preconception position to adjust my watch and have already sent it to you. Take a look later and remember to follow the positions on it. It will definitely be easy to get pregnant.\u201d\n Song Ci was both embarrassed and angry. \u201cYou are unmarried. How can you research such things?\u201d\n \u201cTo be honest, I also wish to have a child.\u201d Song Fei felt that this elder sister of hers was a failure. \u201cI am lagging behind you in love, marriage and height. I definitely cannot lose to you in childbirth.\u201d\n Not only was Song Fei intelligent, she was also very competitive.\n Hearing this reason, Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cAre we still going to compete on this?\u201d\n \u201cOf course, I am your elder sister.\u201d\n After Song Fei left, Song Ci still felt that this was very unreal.\n \u2013\n After the news of Mu Mian being executed was released, the internet was abuzz.\n After the execution, Mu Mian\u2019s body was cremated and his ashes taken away by his daughter, Mu Qiu. Mu Qiu bought a grave and buried Mu Mian in a beautiful cemetery.\n Mu Mian\u2019s old friends cut all ties with him. No one came to mourn him at the funeral. It was a cold and cheerless funeral.\n The funeral ended in the morning but Mu Qiu only returned home despondently at night with a layer of white snow covering her shoulders.\n When Auntie Zhang saw that she had finally returned, she felt at ease. Realizing that Mu Qiu\u2019s hands were cold, Auntie Zhang was shocked. She hurriedly brought the ginger tea over and stuffed it into Mu Qiu\u2019s hands. \u201cMiss, drink this ginger tea quickly. Don\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d\n Mu Qiu picked up the bowl of ginger tea and finished it.\n Auntie Zhang brought the dishes back to the kitchen to wash them. \u201cMiss, who attended Sir\u2019s funeral?\u201d\n \u201cNo one.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang was momentarily dazed before sighing. \u201cNot a single person?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang knew that she should say something to comfort Mu Qiu now, but this was indeed too heart-wrenching and no amount of comforting was effective.\n Auntie Zhang wiped away the water in the bowl and placed it in the disinfectant cupboard. She took off her apron and went to the living room. She said to Mu Qiu, \u201cMiss, quickly get some rest. You have also been very tired these few days.\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook her head. \u201cAuntie Zhang, sit down. I have something to tell you.\u201d\n Puzzled, Auntie Zhang sat down.\n Mu Qiu suddenly opened her bag and took out a document. She handed it to Auntie Zhang. Auntie Zhang looked down and saw that it was a house ownership book and she was the beneficiary.\n Auntie Zhang was stunned. \u201cMiss!\u201d She raised her voice. \u201cMiss, what are you doing?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve decided to leave.\u201d Mu Qiu smiled at Auntie Zhang. \u201cI\u2019ve sold everything that I could, leaving this house. Auntie Zhang, I treat you as my family. Thank you for taking care of our family all these years. I don\u2019t have anything else to give you before I leave. I\u2019ll give this house to you.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t reject me. I know that your daughter is married and it\u2019s not convenient for you to live with your son-in-law and grandchild. You can just stay in this house. After you die, the house will be sold and the money from the sale will be donated to the charity foundation.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang was shocked. She asked Mu Qiu in a trembling voice, \u201cMiss, where are you going?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was also on the verge of tears.\n She said, \u201cAuntie Zhang, I can\u2019t stay in this city anymore. I am leaving. If I don\u2019t leave now, I will really go crazy. Once I close my eyes, I will see my mother lying in the stairwell covered in blood. I will also see my father struggling on the floor when he passed away.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang was utterly confused. \u201cMiss, were you frightened by Sir\u2019s death and Madam\u2019s miscarriage?\u201d\n Mu Qiu shook her head. \u201cNo, no, I am guilty! I am guilty!\u201d\n Auntie Zhang felt uneasy and instinctively lowered her voice. \u201cMiss, what nonsense are you talking about? What crime have you committed?\u201d\n Mu Qiu slid down from the sofa and knelt on the floor, her hands resting on Auntie Zhang\u2019s legs.\n Mu Qiu looked at Auntie Zhang with teary eyes. She couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and was about to go crazy. She decided to tell the dirtiest thing in her heart. \u201cAuntie Zhang, I harmed my mother and the child in her tummy. That day, I secretly applied some facial cream on the stairs and my mother stepped on it, causing her to slip and fall...\u201d\n \u201cI am guilty...\u201d\n Hearing that, Auntie Zhang was totally dumbstruck.\n She suspected that she was hearing things.\n How can such a pure and innocent lady do such a thing? \u201cMiss, you are joking, right? That is your mother, how could you do such a thing?\u201d Auntie Zhang couldn\u2019t believe it was true.\n Mu Qiu was still crying and confessing. \u201cIt\u2019s true. It\u2019s all true. I harmed that child. It\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\n \u201cThese few days, I have been plagued by nightmares every night. I keep dreaming of my mother asking me why I killed that child. After waking up, I often hear my father scolding me for being inhuman.\u201d\n \u201cAuntie Zhang, am I crazy?\u201d\n Auntie Zhang listened in a daze, momentarily unable to digest this news.\n In her eyes, Miss Mu Qiu had always been a lovely, innocent girl. Auntie Zhang still remembered the first time she saw Miss Mu after coming to the Mu Family.\n It was a summer day and it was raining cats and dogs. A group of ants was nibbling at a piece of bread. Worried that the ants might get trampled to death, Mu Qiu bent over and slowly moved the piece of bread and the group of ants to a corner.\n At that time, Auntie Zhang already felt that Mu Qiu was a kind-hearted young lady. After all, Mu Qiu was only six years old then and knew not to kill. Compared to Mu Qiu, her adopted daughter, Miss Song Ci, was a vicious and merciless person.\n It was also summertime. A group of ants was hiding in the corner of the Mu Family residence, trying their best to move a few grains of rice. Song Ci saw them when she got home. Without another word, she ran into the kitchen and boiled a pot of water. She brought the water to the corner and splashed it on the ants.\n Because of that incident, Auntie Zhang always looked down on Song Ci. She felt that Song Ci was vicious and heartless. As a result, Auntie Zhang always sided with Mu Qiu.\n Unexpectedly, the seemingly vicious Song Ci was actually a clean and upright person. Meanwhile, that Mu Qiu who would protect the ants and move house was a heartless lady who could kill the child in her mother\u2019s womb.\n Why are people so contradictory?\n Auntie Zhang looked down at the tear-streaked Mu Qiu and couldn\u2019t help feeling hurt.\n Hugging Mu Qiu\u2019s head, Auntie Zhang asked her in tears, \u201cMiss, why are you so foolish? Even if you don\u2019t like that child, you shouldn\u2019t be so silly as to do such a foolish thing!\u201d\n She was not possessed. It was just her nature to be so cruel. Although she didn\u2019t want to admit it, Mu Qiu saw the truth. She was indeed Mu Mian\u2019s biological daughter. She had the same selfish, vicious blood as Mu Mian.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Only when they were tired did they fall asleep.\n The next day, Auntie Zhang woke up to find that Mu Qiu had gone missing along with her important personal belongings. Guessing that Mu Qiu had left, Auntie Zhang couldn\u2019t help feeling distressed.\n Miss is all alone. Where can she go after leaving home?\n There was a magpie hill thirty miles away from Wangdong City, and a monastery halfway up the hill called the Moonlight Nunnery. It was the most famous Buddhist penitentiary within hundreds of miles.\n Early in the morning, the Moonlight Nunnery on Magpie Mountain was bathed in the first rays of sunlight. The snow-white ground was shining with a golden glow.\n The door to the Moonlight Nunnery opened and a gray-robed nun stepped out onto the white snow. A young girl was kneeling in the snow.\n The girl was wearing a green-grey down jacket. Her face was the size of a palm and she had a pair of spirited eyes.\n But her face was filled with pain.\n This was a despondent human who had been condemned by her conscience to the core.\n Master Huiru stared at that girl for a moment before stepping onto the snow and walking up to her. She asked calmly, \u201cFemale Patron, how can I help you?\u201d\n The girl looked up at Master Huiru, her clear eyes filled with helplessness and pain. She told Master Huiru, \u201cMaster, my name is Mu Qiu. I\u2019ve done many bad things. I have a kind and gentle mother and a father who kills people like flies. But they all died because of me.\u201d\n \u201cMaster, I am in a lot of pain. I can\u2019t fall asleep the entire night. Every time I do, I will dream of my mother lying on the ground covered in blood, asking me why I wanted to harm her. My father will scold me in my dreams every night, saying that I am inferior to pigs and that I will suffer the wrath of heaven. Master, can you redeem me?\u201d\n Mu Qiu grabbed Huiru\u2019s wrist tightly as if she was grabbing onto a life-saving straw. \u201cMaster, I really can\u2019t take it anymore. Tell me, is there any way to forget the pain? If I become a Buddhist and focus on cultivation, can I resolve this pain?\u201d\n Huiru didn\u2019t respond but asked her, \u201cWhat evil deeds have you committed?\u201d\n Tears of regret streamed down Mu Qiu\u2019s face as she told Huiru honestly. \u201cI nearly killed my elder sister. I caused the death of my mother\u2019s newly formed fetus. I even instigated my father to commit a crime for me. Because of me, my father was sentenced to death and my mother also died from a sudden cerebral hemorrhage.\u201d\n As Mu Qiu listed out her crimes one by one, Huiru\u2019s eyes widened in shock. How can such a girl, who looks so kind and beautiful, do such a cruel thing?\n Huiru had a pair of deep, intelligent eyes. She sized Mu Qiu up from head to toe for a long time before saying, \u201cIf you join our Buddhist school and cultivate wholeheartedly, you might be able to forget your pain. However, all Buddhist cultivators cultivate the heart. Female Patron, if you want me to bless you with Buddhism, you need to ask yourself if you are willing to let me bless you with Buddha?\u201d\n Mu Qiu was slightly stunned.\n Buddhism cultivation was all about cultivating the heart.\n This sentence made her cry. She wiped her tears and said sincerely, \u201cMaster, I am willing to become a Buddhist.\u201d\n Seeing that she sincerely wanted to join Buddhism, Master Huiru held Mu Qiu\u2019s hand. She gazed at the main door of the temple behind her and said, \u201cFollow me through this door and the mortal world will no longer have anything to do with you. Think carefully.\u201d\n Instantly, many images flashed across Mu Qiu\u2019s mind.\n The mother who loved her, doted on her, but was indirectly murdered by her, her father who doted on her for her entire life, but ended up saying that he regretted giving birth to her, Cheng Yanmo, who admired and loved her, but had no choice but to break up with her, and Song Ci, who could have killed her but let her live...\n Laughter and screams of pain echoed in Mu Qiu\u2019s mind. I\u2019m already so evil, but there is still someone willing to give her a way out. I should wake up!\n Placing her hand in Master Huiru\u2019s, Mu Qiu told her, \u201cI am willing to join the Buddhist school and accompany the Buddha forever, never to enter the mortal world.\u201d\n \u201cAmitabha, merciful Buddha, follow me in.\u201d\n Mu Qiu stood up and followed Huiru into the Moonlight Nunnery.\n From then on, the youngest daughter of the Mu Family, Mu Qiu, no longer existed in this world. However, there was now a female disciple of the Buddhist Sect named \u2018Forgetting Dust\u2019.\n \u2013\n Long Yu followed Han Zhan\u2019s instructions and had been monitoring Mu Qiu\u2019s movements.\n Long Yu had quickly informed Han Zhan about Mu Qiu going up to Magpie Mountain alone and becoming a Buddhist.\n At that moment, Han Zhan was standing on the top floor of the Imperial Dragon Building, gazing at the surging river in the distance.\n ]\u201dMr. Han, Mu Qiu has already become a Buddhist and is now staying at the Moonlight Nunnery. She has become Master Huiru\u2019s disciple and Master Huiru has named her Forgetting Dust as her Dharma name.\u201d\n Hearing this news, Han Zhan was slightly shocked. \u201cShe actually became a Buddhist.\u201d This is also good. Hopefully, a peaceful place like the Buddhist Sect can cleanse Mu Qiu\u2019s soul. \u201cI got it.\u201d\n After hanging up, Han Zhan gave Song Ci another call.\n Yesterday was supposed to be Song Ci\u2019s menstrual cycle. Noticing that her menstrual cycle had been delayed for a day, Song Ci excitedly went to buy a pregnancy test and planned to verify it in two days. When she received Han Zhan\u2019s call, Song Ci had just come out of the pharmacy.\n \u201cWhat are you doing, Baby Ci?\u201d\n Without a hidden enemy like Mu Mian, Song Ci now dared to drive out alone. She sat in Aoyu Number 1 and turned on its smart driving mode. She then laid down on the chair and spoke to Han Zhan. \u201cDriving.\u201d\n Han Zhan laughed and said, \u201cRetarded mode?\u201d Secretly, Han Zhan and Song Ci called their own car\u2019s\u2019 intelligent mode \u2018retarded mode.\n Song Ci clicked her tongue before saying, \u201cI went to buy a pregnancy test kit just now.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly stunned.\n \u201cYour menstrual cycle has been delayed?\u201d He was also secretly hoping that Song Ci would be pregnant.\n Song Ci nodded. Realizing that Han Zhan couldn\u2019t see her nod, she spoke again. \u201cIt was supposed to come yesterday, but it didn\u2019t. I just remembered and came to the pharmacy to buy a pregnancy test kit.\u201d\n \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t come in another two days, I will give it a try.\u201d It was too early to tell.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d At this point, he should say something nicer to please Song Ci. After thinking for a moment, Han Zhan suddenly asked, \u201cDo you want to come to the Imperial Dragon Building to admire the business we\u2019ve built?\u201d\n Recently, Song Ci had been so focused on the auditions for \u201cLe Chi\u201d and Mu Mian that she didn\u2019t ask about Han Zhan\u2019s progress. Hearing this, she asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhen will the new company be established?\u201d\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cThis month\u2019s Christmas.\u201d\n A month ago, Zeus Airlines had already released news of successful mergers and acquisitions of Sheng Hui Technology Company, Huiteng Car Corporation, East England Real Estate Company, Jetta International Hotel Company, and Yu Hua Management Company.\n When this news was released, it shocked the entire country.\n Whether it was Sheng Hui Technology Company, Huiteng Car Corporation, or Oriental Real Estate Corporation, they were all major corporations in the country. Amongst them, Huiteng Car Corporation\u2019s Aoyu Number 1, which had just been launched this year, astonished the world.\n If Zeus Airlines managed to merge such awesome companies, how formidable must Zeus Airlines be?\n The key point was that Zeus Airlines not alone merged with Huiteng Car Corporation. It also merged with three other similarly high-profile companies, as well as the recently emerging Yu Hua Management Company.\n Zeus Airlines had already become a massive entity. It had already stood at the top of the Chinese pyramid and had surpassed Chuan Dong Group.\n This company had only been established for less than 10 years!\n Everyone was very curious about Zeus Airlines and wondered who was its boss.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that the day after tomorrow?!\u201d Song Ci was slightly shocked. In her previous life, Zeus Corporation was established in 2021 and surpassed Chuan Dong Group and became Wangdong City\u2019s leading enterprise.\n Meanwhile, Han Zhan had also become Wangdong City\u2019s richest man.\n Those few years, Han Zhan was very popular in Wangdong City. He was rich, wealthy, handsome, and cool. Although he was slightly handicapped, he was rich!\n At that time, the unmarried girls wanted to marry Han Zhan, the married women wanted to get a divorce and marry Han Zhan, the older women wanted to marry their daughters to Han Zhan, and a bunch of men also wanted to lay their hands on Han Zhan.\n In short, Han Zhan was equivalent to RMB\u2014the kind that could speak.\n \u201cYes, the day after tomorrow.\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci. \u201cThere will be a grand gala the day after tomorrow night. At that time, all the business big shots in the country will attend and there will be many big shot celebrities coming to support. Song Ci, it\u2019s time for you to impress everyone.\u201d\n Song Ci giggled. \u201cBrother Han, I really like what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist taking out a small mirror from her bag and sizing up her own formidable beauty.\n She clicked her tongue twice and asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, oh Brother Han, who is the most beautiful woman in this world?\u201d\n Han Zhan acted alongside her. \u201cOf course it\u2019s the young, beautiful, sexy Song Ci.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYou have such a sweet tongue!\u201d\n Han Zhan was amused by her. After laughing, he suddenly said, \u201cMu Qiu has become a nun.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cAh? What?\u201d She thought she heard wrongly. \u201cMarried or became a nun1?\u201d\n \u201cBe a monk.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s smile faded. \u201cWhat a joke.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s true. She went to the Moonlight Nunnery and became a female disciple of a Buddhist sect.\u201d Knowing that Song Ci must be very puzzled, Han Zhan told her, \u201cI was worried about that woman and had Long Yu guard her 24 / 7. Long Yu saw Mu Qiu go to Magpie Mountain this morning and enter the Moonlight Nunnery. She shaved her hair and became a female disciple under Master Huiru.\u201d\n If Long Yu saw it with his own eyes, there was no way it could be fake.\n Song Ci was slow to react. After snapping out of her trance, she said, \u201c...Got it.\u201d\n \u201cI will wait for you at the Imperial Dragon Building then? There is a seafood restaurant nearby that is very tasty. Come over and I will bring you there.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. Seafood is cold and not good for the baby in my tummy.\u201d Song Ci was already playing the role of a mother even before she was pregnant.\n Han Zhan chuckled before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s have barbeque then.\u201d\n \u201cThat won\u2019t do either. I\u2019m prone to gain weight if I eat barbeque.\u201d\n \u201cBe a good girl. Eat meat and the child will grow up strong.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s words appeased Song Ci.\n \u201cAlright then, let\u2019s have some barbeque.\u201d After hanging up, Song Ci adjusted the steering wheel and sat in the car in a daze.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t wish for Du Tingting\u2019s heart to remain in the body of a naughty girl. She had purposely sent Mu Qiu to the execution grounds to observe Mu Mian\u2019s execution. She wanted to use Mu Mian\u2019s death to awaken Mu Qiu\u2019s final conscience and make her understand that evil deeds would eventually be punished.\n It was just as Song Ci had expected. Mu Qiu knew that she had to turn over a new leaf. But Song Ci didn\u2019t expect her to become a nun at the temple.\n Once she became a nun, she would cut off all possibilities of her relationship with Cheng Yanmo. How much courage did she have to do this?\n Mu Qiu was indeed a ruthless and harsh person.\n However, it was good that Mu Qiu had become a Buddhist. She would chant sutras and strike the wooden fish daily. Thanks to the influence of Buddhism, Song Ci hoped that Mu Qiu could do good and be a better person.\n \u2013\n After dropping Song Ci off at the foot of the Imperial Dragon Building, Aoyu Number 1 went to find an empty parking space. Curious, Song Ci followed behind the car. She was dumbstruck when she saw that Aoyu Number 1 had really parked itself accurately in the parking space.\n Damn, no wonder this car is the top-selling car in the world. Who wouldn\u2019t love such an intelligent car?\n The Imperial Dragon Building had already become Wangdong City\u2019s newly-established influencer location. The square was filled with tourists who came to take photos and check-in. Those hawkers selling balloons and hawthorn candies were very popular and couldn\u2019t stop smiling.\n Song Ci walked to the square in front of the skyscraper. She looked up and stared at the majestic words carved on the rooftop.\n Zeus Corporation.\n An air of nobility and dominance wafted over!\n A sense of pride welled up in her heart. This is my man\u2019s business! My man is so capable in all aspects.\n Han Zhan\u2019s office was situated on the east side of the top floor of the building, covering an area of about 200 square meters. Apart from his office area, the entire top floor was filled with all sorts of meeting rooms and conference rooms.\n The renovation style of Han Zhan\u2019s office was still black and white, making it appear stable and grand, yet low-key and luxurious. He seemed to love French windows a lot. Apart from the weight-bearing columns and the wall, the rest of the wall had been made into large French windows with electric curtains all drawn and bright lights shining in.\n Song Ci discovered that he had used half a wall to create an isolated space in the office. It was designed as a children\u2019s playground with a children\u2019s basketball hoop, a maritime pool, and a play area.\n Song Ci stared at the children\u2019s playground with a shocked expression. She couldn\u2019t help teasing Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, you prepared a playground in the office. Are you planning to be the director of a child care?\u201d\n Upon hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Han Zhan said, \u201cDon\u2019t joke around. This is prepared for our child.\u201d\n Song Ci had already guessed it.\n But she was curious. \u201cWhy did you prepare a children\u2019s playground in the office?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s convenient for us to bring the child over to play. If you go on a work trip or go out alone, you can also leave the child with me. I will take care of her.\u201d Han Zhan made clear arrangements for everything.\n Song Ci instinctively said, \u201cI really like children. I won\u2019t abandon him and go off on my own.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that.\u201d Han Zhan picked up a basketball from the ground and threw it into the small basket.\n He caught the ball and stared at the young and beautiful Song Ci. He said earnestly, \u201cI know you like children, but Baby Ci, you are not even 23 years old yet. You are still a playful child. Raising a child is much more difficult and dull than you think. If the child has a bad temper and makes you unhappy everyday, you will always feel like leaving the child to relax when you are depressed.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, I will be the only one to take care of the children.\u201d Thinking of these issues, Han Zhan specially got someone to prepare a children\u2019s playground in the office just in case.\n Song Ci knew that Han Zhan was right. It was one thing to like children, but it was another to be patient with them.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart warmed at Han Zhan\u2019s considerations. She felt very fortunate to have married a good man who doted on her.\n But she was a frivolous person. She looked at Han Zhan in amusement, shook her head, and clicked her tongue non-stop. \u201cThe once mature and steady overbearing CEO suddenly became a stay-at-home dad. Is this the distortion of humanity or the decline of morality?\u201d\n Han Zhan threw that basketball at Song Ci.\n Song Ci caught the basketball and heard Han Zhan say, \u201cIt\u2019s the power of love.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s gaze deepened. \u201cYou love me,\u201d she said with certainty.\n Han Zhan looked at her deeply and didn\u2019t deny it.\n Song Ci was overjoyed. It was such a sweet feeling to be able to feel a rush of excitement after several months of marriage. She crossed her arms and continued to size up the office. She noticed a leather bed behind a glass screen.\n Song Ci walked over to the double bed and sat down. She sat elegantly like a swan. \u201cI guess you prepared this bed for your little secretary.\u201d Song Ci purposely framed Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan took off his suit jacket as he strode towards Song Ci like a shooting star. Arriving in front of Song Ci, Han Zhan grabbed her chin with his left hand and lifted her face so that she could look up at him.\n Han Zhan\u2019s gloved thumb pressed on Song Ci\u2019s lips. He hinted. \u201cSecretary Song, it\u2019s time to fulfill your duty.\u201d\n This \u2018Secretary Song\u2019 made Song Ci shiver all over.\n Although \u2018Secretary Song\u2019 had stirred up a huge ruckus in Song Ci\u2019s heart, she maintained a calm expression. She batted her lashes seductively and placed her hands on Han Zhan\u2019s arm. \u201cHan Zhan, my salary is very high. Can you afford it?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI\u2019m giving my life to you. Is that enough?\u201d\n Song Ci pouted. \u201cYou won\u2019t have that chance.\u201d Saying that, Song Ci thought of how Han Zhan nearly died in the earthquake in order to save her. Her heart trembled, and she hurriedly corrected herself. \u201cWho cares about your life? I don\u2019t want you to give your life to me.\u201d\n What right did I have?\n Han Zhan added. \u201cThen, shall I give myself to you?\u201d\n \u201cI want this!\u201d\n \u2013\n After taking Han Zhan, Song Ci recalled the feeling just now and said with emotion, \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019re so gentle today.\u201d He totally treated her like a pigeon egg and didn\u2019t even dare to use any strength.\n Han Zhan hugged her waist and rested his chin on Song Ci\u2019s head. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare to mess around. I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re really pregnant.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled and fell asleep in Han Zhan\u2019s arms.\n After waking up, Han Zhan brought Song Ci to eat some barbequed meat. Song Ci ate the meat in big bites and felt guilty. \u201cI will become fat if I continue eating like this.\u201d\n \u201cYou can lose weight after giving birth.\u201d\n \u201c... Alright.\u201d\n Using the excuse of raising a child, Song Ci ate a plate of pork belly, a plate of fatted beef, and a plate of chives and eggs. After dinner, the two of them went to Li Yao\u2019s clothing store to get the clothes they were going to wear tomorrow.\n The next morning, Song Ci woke up and realized that her pants were dirty. Realizing that her period had come, Song Ci was slightly disappointed. She couldn\u2019t resist saying to Song Fei: [Song Fei, my period came and I am not pregnant.]\n Song Fei heaved a sigh of relief when she saw this.\n Song Fei: [Oh, is that so? What a pity.]\n Song Ci felt that Song Fei was just being perfunctory. Recalling Song Fei\u2019s boastful words that day, she asked her: [How far have you and Yan Jiang progressed?]\n Song Fei: [I want to take him down this afternoon.]\n Song Ci: [!]\n Song Ci\u2019s gossipy heart was aroused. She hurriedly sent a voice message to Song Fei: ]Song Fei, how do you plan to win him over? Tell me, I can help you analyze if its good enough.]\n Song Fei replied with a voice message: [I\u2019ve made three plans. The first plan is to force myself on him while he is still half-drunk. The second plan is to prepare a diamond ring and propose to him. While he is feeling touched, make the request to sleep with him. The third is to drug him directly.]\n Song Ci: [!] No wonder Father said Song Fei had an anti-social character. Is this even humanly possible?\n Song Fei humbly asked Song Ci: [Which plan do you think is more reliable?]\n Song Ci shed a few bitter tears for Yan Jiang before going against her conscience. \u201cThe\u2014the second plan.\u201d\n Song Fei: [I think so too.]\n Song Fei was busy preparing for the big battle of love this afternoon and didn\u2019t have the time to deal with Song Ci. After hanging up the video call, Song Fei put on a long down jacket and sports shoes before driving herself to the mall.\n Song Fei went straight to the jewelry store.\n The salesperson smiled and asked her, \u201cHello miss, do you want to see the necklace or the earrings?\u201d Girls who shopped at jewelry stores alone would usually look at these items.\n Song Fei walked up to the counter and glanced at the dazzling array of items inside.\n She had a phobia of deciding and decided not to choose. She said to the salesperson, \u201cTake out your men\u2019s rings for me to see.\u201d After a pause, she added, \u201cDon\u2019t show me the cheap ones.\u201d They aren\u2019t worthy of that little coward of mine.\n \u201cAlright, please wait a moment.\u201d\n The salesperson chose eight sets of male rings and placed them in front of Song Fei.\n Song Fei felt that each design was about the same. In any case, they were all rather pretty and she didn\u2019t know much about such things. She asked the salesperson, \u201cWhich design should I choose for my proposal?\u201d\n The receptionist was stunned. She asked Song Fei uncertainly, \u201cAre you proposing to your boyfriend, Miss?\u201d\n Song Fei nodded.\n In this day and age, men could propose to men, so what if women proposed to men? The receptionist asked Song Fei, \u201cWhat type of guy is your boyfriend, Miss?\u201d\n Noticing the man on the billboard, Song Fei lazily lifted a finger and pointed at it. \u201cJust like this.\u201d\n The salesperson\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cThis is our spokesperson, Mr. Yan Jiang. Is your boyfriend this type? Mr. Yan Jiang\u2019s personal aura is very compatible with our brand\u2019s products. If your boyfriend is also this type, I will recommend this design for you...\u201d\n The salesperson chose a platinum ring. There was a golden wavy line in the middle that looked like golden sand. It was simple and unique. Song Fei stared at the ring and imagined Yan Jiang wearing it. She thought it looked rather nice.\n \u201cThis one then.\u201d\n After buying the ring, Song Fei instantly became poor.\n On the way home, she passed by a flower shop. Song Fei parked the car and opened WeChat to look at the remaining 147 yuan in her wallet. One had to be generous to their own man!\n Song Fei alighted and entered the flower shop.\n The manager was a gentle girl who was tending to a basin of Bird of Paradise. When she saw Song Fei enter the house, she asked her with a watering can, \u201cWelcome, what would you like to buy?\u201d\n Song Fei was a practical person. She said, \u201cI only have 147 yuan and want to buy some roses. How much can I buy?\u201d\n The store manager was slightly stunned before continuing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a festive season now. Roses cost 10 yuan a rose. You can buy 11 roses and I will help you wrap them up beautifully.\u201d\n Song Fei nodded. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll have 11 then.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, give me a moment.\u201d\n Song Fei carried the roses into the car. After thinking for a moment, she sent Yan Jiang a message.\n After Yan Jiang returned to China, he was recommended by his university mentor to join Wangdong Police Station as an intern forensic doctor. That day, he was conducting research on a mutilated corpse when his cell phone suddenly rang.\n ]Knowing that it was Song Fei\u2019s message, Yan Jiang quickly took off his gloves and took out his cell phone to read the message.\n Song Fei: [Are you coming back this afternoon? I have something to discuss with you.]\n Song Fei was Yan Jiang\u2019s life. Of course he would go back.\n Yan Jiang: [I will be back.]\n He had a two-hour lunch break in the afternoon. Considering that it would take 40 minutes to drive back and forth, and that he didn\u2019t know what Song Fei wanted to talk to him about, Yan Jiang took an hour off from his superior.\n As he drove home, he could smell the fragrance of meat.\n Every time they returned home, Yan Jiang would hug Song Fei and suck on her neck like a baby addicted to milk, as Song Fei was his addiction.\n Yan Jiang tiptoed into the kitchen, hugged Song Fei, and took a deep breath. He looked up again and saw that Song Fei was frying ribs. The ribs were almost cooked and the fragrance was overwhelming.\n In just a few short days, Song Fei had already mastered a good set of culinary skills. She also cooked the beef ribs beautifully. Song Fei turned off the fire and placed the beef ribs on a western plate. She said to Yan Jiang, \u201cBring it over. I also made spaghetti. We\u2019ll eat later.\u201d\n Yan Jiang released her waist and took the plate. He asked her curiously, \u201cWhat day is it today?\u201d Cooking noodles was very time-consuming. Song Fei didn\u2019t like to eat it and didn\u2019t like to make it either. So what is the special occasion today?\n Song Fei said, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d\n Her cold expression while telling him that it was a secret was adorable and interesting to Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang sat at the dining table and waited. After a few minutes, Song Ci finished preparing the noodles and brought them out.\n Just when they were about to eat, Yan Jiang asked Song Ci, \u201cYou said on the phone that you had something to tell me. What is it?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s eat first and talk after that.\u201d If I say it now, the food will be wasted.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s curiosity was aroused and he ate quickly. Song Fei ate a few mouthfuls of spaghetti and two slices of beef before putting down her cutlery and standing up. \u201cI am full. Remember to wash the dishes.\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Okay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was also full. He threw away the remains, threw the cutlery into the dishwasher, and buried his head in the cupboard to look for the washing powder. He heard footsteps descending the stairs.\n Yan Jiang turned and asked Song Fei, \u201cAh Fei, where is the dishwashing powder?\u201d Turning back completely, Yan Jiang was stunned to see Song Fei in her new outfit.\n ong Fei was wearing a dress\u2014a sexy strapped dress!\n Two extremely thin straps hung over that pair of fair, thin shoulders, making her collarbone appear alluring. Sexy wasn\u2019t just round and smooth, there was also some sexiness that was the charm exuded from her eyes.\n When Song Fei stared at him with those ice-cold eyes, Yan Jiang felt as if his scalp was numb and his soul was being pierced.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t expect Song Fei to have such a side to her.\n He stared at Song Fei in her dress and the roses in her arms. His expression was one of shock and suspicion.\n What is Song Fei trying to do?\n Song Fei walked up to Yan Jiang in her flats.\n She handed the huge bouquet of roses to Yan Jiang. He looked down at the roses and felt suffocated. \u201cIs this for me?\u201d Yan Jiang\u2019s voice was so gentle that it was unbearable.\n Song Fei nodded lazily. \u201cFor you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang liked it very much. He reached out to take the rose when he heard Song Fei say, \u201cThere\u2019s a surprise inside. Accepting the rose means accepting that surprise. Once I give anything away, I won\u2019t take it back. Think about it carefully.\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s surprises were usually shocks, so Yan Jiang quickly retracted his hand.\n Yan Jiang really wanted that bouquet of roses, but he was also worried that there might be venomous snakes, itchy powder, or other bizarre things inside. Yan Jiang touched the back of his hand uneasily and asked Song Fei in a consulting tone, \u201cCan you tell me what the surprise you mentioned is?\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s tone was cool and mild. \u201cNo.\u201d\n Yan Jiang looked embarrassed.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t want it?\u201d Song Fei kept the bouquet and turned to walk out the door. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want it. It\u2019s not worth anything anyway.\u201d\n \u201cI want it!\u201d Yan Jiang dashed over, snatched the rose from her arms, and carried it over to the coffee table.\n This was Ah Fei\u2019s first time giving him flowers and they were red roses that represented love. Even if Yan Jiang was bitten to death by a venomous snake, he would still keep these flowers. He had already decided that when these flowers were about to wither, he would make them dry and store them for as long as possible.\n Yan Jiang sat on the carpet and stared at the rose. He couldn\u2019t guess what was so scary about it. \u201cThe surprise you mentioned\u2014it shouldn\u2019t be something that will make me itch and poison me the moment my skin comes into contact with it, right?\u201d Having been fooled by Song Fei once, Yan Jiang was already traumatized.\n Song Fei shrugged. \u201cWho knows?\u201d\n Yan Jiang hesitated for a moment before reaching out for the rose. Song Fei suddenly added. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Even if you are poisoned, I have the antidote.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n Yan Jiang, who was initially unafraid of death, suddenly felt terrified.\n Regardless of what the surprise was, Yan Jiang still wanted to see it.\n He started to tell Song Fei his will. \u201cMy bank password is the same. It\u2019s the last three digits of your birthday, plus 111. All the properties under my name are under your name. After I die, you will receive all my assets.\u201d\n Song Fei kicked his butt. \u201cIf you want to look, look. Otherwise, I\u2019ll throw it away. Stop dawdling!\u201d\n Yan Jiang finally calmed down after being kicked.\n Gritting his teeth, he reached out for the roses, looking for a surprise on tenterhooks. With caution, he opened each rose and saw a velvet box.\n At this point, Yan Jiang still hadn\u2019t realized what would happen next.\n He was still very certain that Song Fei had placed disgusting things like scorpions and eggs in the box. He picked up the box and shook it. When he didn\u2019t hear any sounds, he said, \u201cCould it be a cricket?\u201d\n With that, he narrowed his eyes warily and opened the box.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes were filled with shock when he saw the ring sitting quietly inside the box.\n Beside him, Song Fei crossed her arms and leaned against the sofa. \u201cThat cricket in your hand is worth 68,000 yuan.\u201d\n Yan Jiang stared at the crickets. His throat was burning and he couldn\u2019t think straight. \u201cThis is...\u201d Yan Jiang picked up the ring and looked up at Song Fei.\u201d Ah Fei, are you proposing to me? \u201d\n Song Fei tugged at her short hair awkwardly. She asked Yan Jiang, \u201cDo I still need to kneel down?\u201d Tsk, it was her first time proposing and she was not very familiar with it. Song Fei snatched the ring from Yan Jiang\u2019s hand and knelt down on one knee in front of him.\n Yan Jiang was shocked.\n Song Fei raised the ring and started proposing.\n \u201cI started protecting you when I was 8 years old.\u201d\n When she was 8 years old, Yan Jiang was 12 years old and was about to graduate from elementary school. That year, his father and mother abandoned him one after another, and he led an orphan-like life with his grandmother. That year, Yan Jiang was bullied and scolded at school. Who asked him to have such a twisted father?\n But it was also that year that he got to know that cold, intelligent girl from his neighbor\u2019s house. Knowing Song Fei was the only good thing in Yan Jiang\u2019s incomplete youth.\n It had been nearly two months since she came back to Wangdong City. Yan Jiang\u2019s skin had already returned to its original color. It was very fair and smooth. Song Fei stared at Yan Jiang\u2019s pleasant face. The ice in her eyes gradually melted.\n Song Fei said, \u201cFrom the age of 8 to 14, I have been protecting you for six years. One would be addicted to raising animals and would develop feelings for them, not to mention for a person.\u201d After a pause, Song Fei\u2019s eyes turned solemn and determined. She said to Yan Jiang, \u201cI still want to protect you forever. You better give me a chance.\u201d\n Yan Jiang instinctively asked Song Fei, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t give you this chance, what would you do?\u201d\n Song Fei frowned, her gaze ice-cold. \u201cI\u2019ll beat you to death.\u201d This reply was very typical of Song Fei.\n Yan Jiang smiled.\n \u201cAh Fei, I accept your proposal.\u201d He took the ring from Song Fei\u2019s hand and put it on his middle finger.\n Song Fei heaved a sigh of relief. She glanced at Yan Jiang\u2019s middle finger and felt that the ring suited him rather well. I didn\u2019t buy the wrong one.\n Yan Jiang also took off the necklace on his neck and the platinum ring. He knelt down and put the ring on Song Fei\u2019s finger in the same position.\n After putting on the ring, Yan Jiang said, \u201cAh Fei, I will try to set you free, but you are not allowed to lie to me again. You are not allowed to do anything foolish without telling me.\u201d The Golden Sands incident had left a deep impression on Yan Jiang.\n He hugged Song Fei. The girl in his arms was extremely skinny, as if she would shatter if he squeezed her hard.\n \u201cI love you very much, Song Fei. I have experienced the same pain twice with you.\u201d Eight years ago at the earthquake site, Yan Jiang thought that Song Fei was dead and dug her out for three days without eating or drinking.\n In Golden Sands, he thought that Song Fei had died again. He cried bitterly in the midst of the flames of war. For several consecutive days, he couldn\u2019t sleep at all.\n \u201cSong Fei, I am a little coward. If you scare me again, I will die.\u201d\n Song Fei had already realized just how wrong she had been. She felt very guilty. If she could turn back time, she would never hide it from Yan Jiang again. She had already tasted the feeling of heartache.\n \u201cAlright, I agree.\u201d\n Yan Jiang closed his eyes in relief and hugged her tightly, upon hearing this.\n But Song Fei nudged him.\n Yan Jiang was slightly puzzled at being pushed away. \u201cCan\u2019t you let me hug you for a while?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cNo, you only have 30 minutes to rest. You will be late if you don\u2019t hurry up. Hurry up, we will go upstairs to our room.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned. \u201cWhat are we going back to the bedroom for?\u201d He thought of some inappropriate scenes and felt his throat go dry.\n Song Fei pulled Yan Jiang to his feet. As they walked upstairs, she said, \u201cMaking babies! I am older than Song Ci. Our child cannot call Song Ci\u2019s children elder brother or sister.\u201d In certain aspects, Song Fei was frighteningly stubborn.\n Yan Jiang was dragged upstairs by Song Fei. He felt like everything was unreal. When they arrived at the room, Song Fei took off Yan Jiang\u2019s pretentious glasses and he sat on the bed, his face red and his heart racing.\n Everything was progressing smoothly. Just as they were about to engage in an in-depth interaction, Yan Jiang suddenly remembered something. He stopped and said with a disordered breath, \u201cOne moment, I have to call my boss and ask for leave. I won\u2019t be going to work in the afternoon.\u201d\n He got off the bed barefooted and found his cell phone in his pants to make a call.\n Song Fei sat on the bed, her clothes in disarray. She told Yan Jiang calmly, \u201cI\u2019ve checked. The average time for men in our country is 16 minutes. You still have 25 minutes to rest. After that, take a shower before going to work. You won\u2019t be late either.\u201d\n Yan Jiang shot Song Fei a meaningful look. \u201cAh Fei, sometimes research is not reliable.\u201d An average of 15 minutes? That was impossible. In the past, it would take Yan Jiang more than 10 minutes when he just imagined Song Fei, let alone now when they were doing it in person.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "194": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-195\n\n Chapter 194: Pursuing a Narrow Gain and Neglecting a Greater Danger  As he spoke, the call went through.\n Captain Lin had stayed up late last night to catch the culprits and returned to the station this afternoon. He had just finished a few mouthfuls of rice and was snoring away, when Yan Jiang\u2019s phone call woke him up.\n \u201cWho? What do you want?\u201d Captain Lin\u2019s voice sounded raspy and displeased.\n Yan Jiang wasn\u2019t afraid of Captain Lin waking up. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Yan Jiang. Captain Lin, I want to rest this afternoon.\u201d\n \u201cThe reason?\u201d\n Like a peacock spreading its tail, Yan Jiang said shamelessly, \u201cNothing else. My girlfriend proposed to me and I\u2019m not in the mood to go to work this afternoon.\u201d\n \u201c...\u201d\n At 32 years old, Captain Lin was still single and was so attacked that he couldn\u2019t even fall asleep.\n Under the publicity of Captain Lin\u2019s loud voice, in just a few minutes, the entire Public Security Bureau knew that Yan Jiang had been proposed to by his girlfriend and hadn\u2019t gone to work in the afternoon.\n Anyone with a brain would know what they were doing in the afternoon.\n At night, Song Ci stood by the French window playing the violin.\n After a long day at work, Han Zhan returned home feeling fatigued. He could vaguely hear the sound of a violin as he reached his doorstep.\n He gently pushed open the door and entered the living room. He saw Song Ci standing by the French window, her back facing him as she concentrated on playing the violin.\n The city outside was filled with neon lights outside the window and the person he liked was inside the house. Han Zhan\u2019s tired heart suddenly relaxed.\n After Song Ci finished her performance, Han Zhan walked over and hugged her waist. \u201cYou look so good playing the violin.\u201d It was very strange. Song Ci was usually like a little fool. Once she grasped the violin, she would enter a completely oblivious state.\n Song Ci rubbed her head against Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder and found a comfortable position.\n She looked down at this violin. It was a gift from Han Zhan and her name was carved on it.\n Song Ci told Han Zhan, \u201cDo you know that every outstanding violinist will name their own violin?\u201d\n ]\u201dMy teacher\u2019s violin is called \u2018Fighting Soul\u2019. But this one of mine...\u201d Song Ci frowned as she stared at the two words. She felt slightly helpless.\u201d Brother Han, you gave my violin a soft name. If I become famous worldwide in future, it will be very funny every time I appear on the news. \u201d\n Song Ci walked out of Han Zhan\u2019s arms and turned to face him. She opened her mouth and started a joke \u2014\n \u201cYesterday, the young violinist, Ms. Song Ci, brought her violin, Baby Ci, to a certain concert hall to perform beautifully for everyone...\u201d\n After Song Ci finished speaking, she glared at Han Zhan and asked him, \u201cHow is this appropriate?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cIt\u2019s just a name. There\u2019s no need to be angry. Moreover, the name Baby Ci is obviously very nice and not soft at all. It\u2019s especially imposing.\u201d\n \u201cWho will believe you?\u201d\n Song Ci handed the violin to Han Zhan and said, \u201cMy teacher\u2019s violin has only been touched by me. Only you and my teacher can touch my violin. Do you want to try?\u201d\n Han Zhan excitedly accepted the violin, held the bow with his fake fingers, and performed a sawed-off performance for Song Ci.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cAlright alright, don\u2019t insult my violin.\u201d\n Song Ci quickly snatched the violin back and meticulously maintained it, before putting it back into the box.\n During this period of time, Han Zhan had been so busy that he didn\u2019t have time to work out and his muscles were slightly soft. Since he didn\u2019t return too late today, Han Zhan entered the gym, after speaking to Song Ci.\n Song Ci had just gotten her period and didn\u2019t accompany Han Zhan to exercise.\n Before they got married, she had promised Han Zhan that she would knit three sweaters for him. But she had something on recently and couldn\u2019t knit three sweaters, so she tried her best to make one for Han Zhan.\n There were still a few needles left to complete the sweater. Song Ci quickly finished knitting it. She folded the sweater neatly and placed it in a gift box. She then placed it at the door of the gym.\n At this moment, her cell phone suddenly reminded her that her close friend Yan Jiang had posted something new.\n Song Ci opened her Weibo and saw an extremely arrogant sentence:\n Yan Jiang: [I\u2019m engaged. No one is allowed to love me anymore. Not even secretly. My fianc\u00e9e is very capable @ Your Sister Fei.]\n Your Sister Fei: [Don\u2019t love Yan Jiang. Your love for him will never come to fruition unless you are smarter than me.]\n 15 minutes later, Weibo was successfully paralyzed.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart was in turmoil when she saw this message. In the end, her family\u2019s overbearing flower still managed to devour the neighboring natal lily.\n Han Zhan finished his exercises, opened the door, walked out, and kicked something.\n Lowering his head in surprise, Han Zhan saw a gift box.\n Realizing that Song Ci had purposely left it there, a smile appeared in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes.\n He squatted down, opened the box, and retrieved the neatly folded white sweater with both hands.\n Opening the sweater, Han Zhan saw that the image on the front of the sweater was that of an honest-looking panda. Han Zhan felt somewhat helpless.\n He knew Song Ci wouldn\u2019t be so obedient.\n Han Zhan went back to his room to take a shower. He put on that sweater and walked up to the mirror in the changing room to size it up. Song Ci\u2019s sweater was beautifully knitted and was slightly loose in size. It was convenient for him to wear a thermos or blouse inside.\n Han Zhan felt even more handsome in a sweater.\n After Song Ci finished her watermelon, she opened WeChat and saw that Brother Han had updated his social media.\n Han Sanpang: [You should wear a sweater during winter. My wife is beautiful and has good hands. I won\u2019t accept any rebuttals.]\n Han Zhan also attached a selfie. It was his own selfie. Han Zhan\u2019s selfie was very manly, like he was standing in a military stance.\n In the photo, Han Zhan was wearing the white panda sweater that Song Ci had knitted for him. His tall, strong frame and handsome, mature face were very contrasting to that sweater.\n But if Han Zhan thought he looked good, how could others say he wasn\u2019t?\n Their mutual friends left comments:\n Li Li: [The sweater is very cute. Mr. Han is also very cute.]\n Bei Zhan: [Hahaha, hahaha!]\n Han Wangwang: [Little uncle, you are already so old, why are you still pretending to be young? However, little auntie\u2019s skills are really not bad. Can you let little auntie knit one for me?]\n Han Zhan replied Han Wangwang: [Who are you to her? Who gave you the cheek?]\n Han Wangwang: [Heartbroken!]\n Song Ci shook her head and chuckled.\n She got off the bed, pushed open the door to the cloakroom, walked in, and pulled up Han Zhan, who was sitting on the stool replying to messages on his social media. \u201cBrother Han, it\u2019s time to go to bed.\u201d\n Han Zhan stood up and followed her back to her room. When they arrived, he stood at the foot of the bed and opened his arms. \u201cHow is it? Does the sweater fit me?\u201d\n Song Ci took a look and said, \u201cVery suitable.\u201d\n Han Zhan was very satisfied.\n At night, he wanted to sleep in the sweater, but Song Ci felt hot for him. \u201cTake it off. The heater is on. Don\u2019t get heat rash.\u201d\n \u201cI just want to sleep with it on.\u201d With Song Ci\u2019s fierce urging, Han Zhan finally relented and took off his sweater.\n Rubbing the sweater lovingly, Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cFrom now on, you will knit a sweater for me every winter.\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s tone was slightly sorrowful. \u201cMy grandmother will knit a sweater for me every year...\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart softened and she agreed.\n As Zeus Corporation was going to be established tomorrow, both Song Ci and Han Zhan were rather agitated that night. They spoke for a long time before finally falling asleep.\n The next day, Han Zhan got up before dawn and went to the Imperial Dragon Building.\n Bei Zhan was a little superstitious. That year, when he hired an architect to design the Imperial Dragon Building, he had asked a geomancy expert to look at it.\n The Imperial Dragon Building was also named by the geomancer.\n On the day that the company was going to be officially established, Bei Zhan invited that Fengshui master over to pray for the company.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t believe in such things at first, but rebirth, which sounded like something out of a fantasy, had even happened. What\u2019s more, Feng Shui was a study.\n This morning, Han Zhan, Bei Zhan, and Li Li all obediently followed behind the geomancer, praying for blessings.\n Han Zhan felt rather tired after the entire ordeal.\n After that, Bei Zhan gave the Feng Shui master a huge red packet containing a check for two million yuan. The Feng Shui master accepted the red packet with a smile and left in satisfaction.\n After the blessing ceremony, it was time for the company\u2019s opening ceremony and ribbon-cutting ceremony.\n On this day, every reporter, who had received an invitation, arrived at the scene to witness the birth of Zeus Corporation.\n When they saw that singer Liang Bo had been invited onto the stage to stand alongside Bei Zhan, Li Li, and the rest to cut the ribbon, the reporters could detect a deeper meaning.\n It was very likely that this Liang Bo would become the big brother of Yu Hua Company.\n Think about it. The Yu Hua Corporation was backed by Zeus Airlines. Liang Bo had connections, resources, and was very capable. It would be difficult for him not to become popular!\n What kind of dog-shit luck was this!\n Han Zhan and Song Ci sat quietly below the stage.\n She saw Liang Bo walk up to the stage looking very flattered. He was holding a pair of scissors and smiled at her. Song Ci also gave him an encouraging sign.\n Taking advantage of Liang Bo lowering his head to cut the ribbon, Song Ci asked Han Zhan in a small voice, \u201cBrother Han, why did you arrange for Liang Bo to go up as well?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you wanted me to take good care of him? Moreover, the two of you are in a collaborative relationship. If Liang Bo becomes popular, he can eat meat while you drink soup. It won\u2019t be detrimental to you.\u201d\n Song Ci felt very sweet inside.\n She stared at Liang Bo and suddenly thought of something. \u201cBrother Han, did you set up this Yu Hua Management Company for Du Xueyan?\u201d\n On a sunny day, Han Zhan seemed to have heard the sound of thunder and his expression changed.\n Seeing that Han Zhan remained silent and looked slightly uneasy, there was nothing Song Ci didn\u2019t understand.\n \u201cI knew it. You are so good to her.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s tone was sour. \u201cYou even registered your company for her, but she just kicked you... If Du Xueyan knew about this, she would definitely be very regretful.\u201d\n Han Zhan that he let Song Ci down.\n \u201cBaby Ci, at that time, you didn\u2019t exist in my life. I thought Du Xueyan was my destiny. She wanted to be a singer, so I got Bei Zhan to register this company on my behalf. My motive was to establish a music kingdom for her that didn\u2019t involve any deception.\u201d\n \u201cI already guessed that you would definitely get angry if you knew the truth. That\u2019s why I never got the chance to tell you.\u201d\n \u201cI did intentionally hide it from you because I cherish you very much.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s words were very sincere. Song Ci was angry but didn\u2019t vent it.\n Because he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\n Song Ci felt slightly sour and felt slightly unfair for Han Zhan. It was not worth it.\n In her eyes, Han Zhan was good in every way. How could Du Xueyan bear to break up with him?\n Song Ci brought up that old topic again. \u201cBrother Han, if you didn\u2019t save that person back then, you wouldn\u2019t have been injured and Du Xueyan might not have broken up with you. In conclusion, your breakup with Du Xueyan was also related to that person...\u201d\n Song Ci remembered that the previous time she asked this question, Han Zhan had flown into a rage. But she just wanted to hear an accurate answer from Han Zhan.\n Song Ci tilted her head to size up Han Zhan. Seeing that Han Zhan only frowned slightly and didn\u2019t look like he was going to lose his temper, she mustered up the courage and asked him boldly, \u201cBrother Han, if you did it again, would you still do that? Would you still save that person?\u201d\n This was the second time Song Ci asked about this. Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help feeling puzzled.\n Song Ci stubbornly wanted to know the answer. Did she know something?\n Han Zhan turned to look at Song Ci and saw that the girl\u2019s face was filled with guilt and uneasiness.\n His heart skipped a beat.\n Did she already know about what happened back then?\n In order to verify his own guess, Han Zhan purposely said, \u201cThere\u2019s something I wanted to ask you a long time ago. Why did you steal my jade pendant?\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly looked up and instinctively explained herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t steal it. The chain broke on its own and fell into my arms...\u201d As she spoke, Song Ci suddenly realized that Han Zhan was trying to fish for information from her!\n Song Ci covered her mouth and looked at Han Zhan in shock.\n Seeing her reaction, there was nothing Han Zhan didn\u2019t understand.\n \u201cSo you do know.\u201d Han Zhan sounded very certain.\n Song Ci lowered her hand and didn\u2019t respond.\n It was time for the lucky draw. The first prize winner would get an Aoyu Number 1, the second prize winner would get a holographic helmet manufactured by Sheng Hui Technology, and the third prize winner would get a smart phone worth 20,000 yuan.\n The atmosphere was very lively. Everyone raised their hands to attract the host\u2019s attention.\n Amidst the din, Han Zhan said to Song Ci, \u201cIf time turns back, my choice won\u2019t change. I will still save you.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes twinkled like bright stars in the sky.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cA relationship that is already in danger cannot be compared to a life. Song Ci, even if it\u2019s not you but anyone else, I will do that.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty towards me. You\u2019ve never done anything wrong. You\u2019re not the one who let me down. Don\u2019t blame yourself for someone else\u2019s mistake. Song Ci, I don\u2019t like to be a good person.\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my fault. I just feel like I\u2019ve let you down.\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head.\n \u201cGod is fair.\u201d He grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and said, \u201cDu Xueyan left and you came. You are better than her. I like you more.\u201d\n Song Ci was overjoyed. Excited, she raised her voice. \u201cBrother Han, I also especially like you!\u201d\n At the same time, the first lucky audience member on stage was striking the golden egg with a hammer. The entire audience was silent, curious about what this person would hit.\n At this moment, a sexy voice suddenly rang out from below the stage.\n \u201cBrother Han, I also especially like you!\u201d\n All the guests: \u201c!\u201d\n Everyone stopped watching the lucky star smash the golden eggs, and turned to stare at Han Zhan and Song Ci sitting in the first row.\n Song Ci realized that everyone in the hall had heard her words. She couldn\u2019t help blushing like a drunkard.\n Han Zhan\u2019s smile widened. \u201cAlright, I got it.\u201d\n Han Zhan stood up and pulled Song Ci\u2019s head into his arms to hide her.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my wife is thin-skinned.\u201d Han Zhan nodded at everyone and fled with his thin-skinned wife in front of everyone.\n After entering the lift, Song Ci hurriedly wriggled out of Han Zhan\u2019s arms.\n \u201cThis is so embarrassing.\u201d\n Nodding, Han Zhan said, \u201cMmm, yes. This incident has probably been filmed by the director at the scene. It will be a classic scene at Zeus International\u2019s opening ceremony.\u201d\n Glancing at Song Ci in amusement, Han Zhan said, \u201cIn the future, during the company\u2019s anniversary celebrations, 10-year celebrations, and 20-year celebrations, I will remember to ask them to play this video.\u201d\n Song Ci was very embarrassed. \u201cBrother Han, shut up!\u201d\n \u201cOkay, okay, okay.\u201d\n Han Zhan brought Song Ci back to the office and accompanied her for an afternoon nap. At 3pm, Song Ci was taken away by the stylist, Ai Lun, to do her makeup for tonight\u2019s party.\n Li Li came upstairs to look for Han Zhan and teased him. \u201cBrother Han, I really, really like you!\u201d\n Han Zhan shot him a lukewarm glance and said, \u201cI refuse.\u201d\n Li Li snorted before putting away his frivolous expression. He walked up to Han Zhan and said, \u201cI heard something. The information is reliable.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at him silently.\n Li Li said, \u201cI heard that Chuan Dong Group\u2019s CEO Cheng is hospitalized today.\u201d\n \u201cHospitalized?\u201d\n As the leading corporation in Wangdong City, Chuan Dong Group\u2019s every move was closely watched by everyone. Old Man Cheng was hospitalized due to a serious illness, and everyone in the company was in a state of panic. Even the rival families who were eyeing them covetously would take the opportunity to take revenge.\n If this matter was not handled well, there would be unpredictable consequences.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation over at Chuan Dong?\u201d\n \u201cI heard that the eldest young master of Chuan Dong City, Cheng Yanmo, is rushing back to the country. I guess he is going to meet old CEO Cheng for the last time. However, regardless of whether CEO Cheng is alive or dead, the person who will take over Chuan Dong will definitely be Cheng Yanmo.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had been in Chuan Dong International for five years. Although he was the company\u2019s Deputy Manager in name, he was already the real CEO. In Chuan Dong International, the eldest young master\u2019s authority was already greater than that of old CEO Cheng.\n The changes in Chuan Dong Group couldn\u2019t affect Zeus Corporation. Han Zhan didn\u2019t take it to heart. But hearing the name Chuan Dong Group, he thought of another person...\n \u201cYou go get busy first. Remember to bring Su Beibei along to attend the party tonight. It\u2019s time for everyone to meet your girlfriend, so that they wouldn\u2019t want to introduce someone to you.\u201d With the establishment of the new company, Li Li and Bei Zhan were both vice-presidents. Since Bei Zhan already had a family, there were naturally fewer people targeting him and pushing women to his side. Meanwhile, Li Li became a hot potato.\n Han Zhan detested such disgusting behavior of \u201cgifting women\u201d in the business world the most. He knew very well that beauty was like a knife hanging over one\u2019s head. If you let down your guard slightly, this knife would fall off. If it was light, you would bleed profusely. If it was heavy, your family would be destroyed.\n Han Zhan wouldn\u2019t allow any potential danger to be by his side, nor would he allow any danger to be hidden beside his trusted subordinate.\n Li Li understood what Han Zhan meant and said, \u201cI\u2019 m going to fetch her. I\u2019ll get going first then.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n After Li Li left, Han Zhan picked up his cell phone and called Han Wangwang.\n \u201cLittle Uncle!\u201d\n Han Wangwang had just finished her lesson and was on the way back to her dormitory.\n Han Wangwang was surprised to receive Han Zhan\u2019s call. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Little Uncle? Are you inviting me to your company\u2019s celebration party to be the DJ?\u201d\n n the previous DJ competition, Han Wangwang had won second place. She was now a famous DJ and many nightclubs were inviting her to perform.\n Han Zhan sneered. \u201cInviting you to mess things up?\u201d\n Han Wangwang chuckled.\n She pushed open the dormitory door and grabbed her cell phone between her shoulder and her right cheek. She then tugged at her clothes.\n Over the phone, Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhen are you going to do what I told you previously?\u201d\n A glint flashed across Han Wangwang\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do it within these few days.\u201d She could feel that that person was losing his patience.\n \u201cDo it as soon as possible.\u201d\n \u201cLittle Uncle, what feud do you have with him?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that. Once this matter is settled, just wait for the start of spring to transfer schools.\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n After hanging up, Han Wangwang carried her clothes to take a shower.\n When she came out of the shower, Han Wangwang closed the curtains and started changing.\n Han Wangwang\u2019s long, slender legs and perky hips were accentuated by a pair of tight, low-waisted jeans.\n She felt that her figure was too voluptuous and couldn\u2019t resist performing a devilish dance in front of the mirror.\n Just as she was dancing happily, the door was suddenly pushed open from the outside.\n Opening the door, she saw a girl shaking her hips in front of a mirror. Jiang Bi was momentarily stunned. She couldn\u2019t help but notice Han Wangwang\u2019s waist peeking out from under her tight tee. It was so thin, so flat, and so fair.\n Han Wangwang heard the commotion and hurriedly stopped. She turned and saw her roommate, Jiang Bi. Han Wangwang felt slightly awkward.\n \u201cHi!\u201d Han Wangwang greeted Jiang Bi with a red face.\n Jiang Bi was two years older than Han Wangwang, but they were alumni from the same cohort. Jiang Bi was already 20 years old when she took the college entrance examination. Everyone found this strange, but no one dared to ask why.\n As Jiang Bi was more introverted and didn\u2019t speak much, the number of times Han Wangwang saw her in the dormitory during the first semester could be counted on one hand. Actually, Han Wangwang wasn\u2019t familiar with Jiang Bi.\n Jiang Bi glanced at Han Wangwang and walked past her without saying anything.\n Jiang Bi was very tall. She was more than half a head taller than Han Wangwang, who was 1.65m tall, and was nearly 1.8m tall. When she walked past Han Wangwang, she felt that the person\u2019s manner was so imposing that she didn\u2019t dare to size her up openly.\n There was no one else in the dormitory. Han Wangwang and Jiang Bi had nothing to say to each other. She sat quietly on a stool and made a temporary hair style with her curly hair stick.\n Putting away her curly hair stick, she opened her snack bar and stuffed two bags of pecan into her bag.\n After thinking for a moment, she took two more bags and walked over to the balcony, passing the pecan to Jiang Bi who was sleeping on the bed.\n Jiang Bi was listening to music with her earphones on, when she suddenly saw a fair hand reach over. She looked down and saw two purses of pecans. Her gaze then followed that hand to the owner.\n She saw a beautiful smiling face.\n \u201cJiang Bi, do you want some pecan?\u201d\n Jiang Bi stared at Han Wangwang\u2019s radiant smile. She reached out to receive the pecan and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d Jiang Bi was cold and arrogant, but her voice was especially pleasant to the ears.\n Han Wangwang smiled sweetly at her. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d\n Jiang Bi held the pecan and thought to herself, Why does she like to smile so much?\n Just then, the door was pushed open again and a girl with waist-length hair walked in. She was Han Wangwang\u2019s good friend and roommate, Su Weiyin.\n Su Weiyin saw that Han Wangwang was wearing a halter top and jeans. She immediately understood. \u201cYou are going to play discs again?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, one-station invited me to their Christmas party. The salary is rather high\u201410,000 yuan a night.\u201d\n Han Wangwang never showed off her wealth. The bags she carried and the clothes she wore were all worth hundreds of dollars. No one knew her family background.\n Seeing that Han Wangwang was going out to earn money again, Su Weiyin asked her, \u201cWangwang, are you very short of money?\u201d\n \u201cYup! I am so poor! I have taken a fancy to something good recently and am still short of a large sum of money.\u201d Han Wangwang was still short of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan to buy an Aoyu Number 1.\n But Su Weiyin interpreted her poverty as a real one. She said, \u201cHow much do you lack? I can lend you.\u201d\n \u201cYou are really my good friend.\u201d Han Wangwang hugged Su Weiyin and called her \u201cdarling\u201d a few times before letting go of her and rejecting her good intentions. \u201cI will slowly earn it myself. If I don\u2019t have enough money, I won\u2019t buy it first.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n Only then did Su Weiyin notice Jiang Bi on the bed. Her footsteps subconsciously became softer.\n Han Wangwang took up the down jacket and put it on. Just as she was about to leave, Su Weiyin suddenly called out to her. \u201cWangwang, bring me along to play too. It\u2019s Christmas night today. It must be very lively inside the one-station.\u201d\n Han Wangwang had always been loyal to her friends. Hearing that, she didn\u2019t think much of it and immediately agreed. \u201cOkay, come with me.\u201d Picking up her bag, Han Wangwang suddenly looked up at Jiang Bi who was lying on the bed opposite her.\n Jiang Bi was eating the pecan in small bites, like a hamster with bulging cheeks.\n \u201cJiang Bi.\u201d\n Jiang Bi looked down at Han Wangwang and remained silent.\n Han Wangwang tilted her head and smiled sweetly like an angel. \u201cJiang Bi, it\u2019s Christmas today. If you have nothing on, come with me to one-station.\u201d\n Afraid that Jiang Bi didn\u2019t know what one-station was, Jiang Bi explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a very famous bar. The drinks there are very tasty. I\u2019ll treat you to a drink!\u201d With that, Han Wangwang waited anxiously for Jiang Bi\u2019s answer.\n Su Weiyin tugged at Han Wangwang\u2019s clothes, trying to get her to stop calling her. Jiang Bi didn\u2019t seem like a sociable person at all. Su Weiyin felt that Jiang Bi would most likely humiliate Han Wangwang.\n Unexpectedly, Jiang Bi nodded.\n She flipped over and jumped off the bed. When she landed, her movements were suave. Han Wangwang was dumbstruck. She quickly gave Jiang Bi a thumbs-up. \u201cYou are so handsome!\u201d\n Jiang Bi stood up, glanced at Han Wangwang, took her cell phone, and went out to play with them.\n \u2013\n The three of them sat in the car and drove over the Imperial Dragon Bridge.\n Han Wangwang leaned against the window of the car, looked at the majestic and domineering building in the middle of the Great Dragon River, and cursed her awesome but petty uncle in her heart.\n Su Weiyin suddenly said, \u201cI heard that is Zeus Corporation\u2019s headquarters.\u201d\n Jiang Bi stared at the building. Although she didn\u2019t speak, she nodded slightly.\n Han Wangwang told Su Weiyin, \u201cSu Weiyin, let me tell you a secret.\u201d\n Su Weiyin pricked up her ears.\n Han Wangwang said, \u201cZeus Corporation\u2019s boss is my uncle.\u201d Her tone was calm and composed, hiding her achievements.\n Su Weiyin snorted. \u201cStop boasting. Zeus Corporation\u2019s boss is my husband!\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Han Wangwang shook his head and said, \u201cZeus Corporation\u2019s lady boss is a country-toppling beauty. You can\u2019t compare to her.\u201d\n Amidst their banter, the car arrived at the entrance of the nightclub.\n Han Wangwang brought them into the shop, arranged seats for them, and went upstairs to meet the manager. At 9pm, when the atmosphere was lively, Han Wangwang took off her down jacket and put on a baseball cap, and walked onto the stage.\n As soon as she went on stage, everyone was calling her name. A lovely name like \u201cHan Wangwang\u201d also sounded very grand.\n Han Wangwang placed her finger on her lips and shushed her. Her voice was magnified by the microphone.\n The crowd went silent and Han Wangwang was very satisfied.\n Han Wangwang started to play and her waist started to move. She was unrestrained and wild.\n Han Wangwang was exceptionally mesmerizing when she DJ-ed and captured the attention of everyone present. Jiang Bi had joined the dormitory\u2019s WeChat group. When Han Wangwang was participating in the DJ competition, she had contacted the group chat and asked them to vote for her.\n Jiang Bi had also voted for Han Wangwang before, but this was the first time Jiang Bi saw Han Wangwang play.\n How to put it? She is exceptionally mesmerizing, with a charm that made one unable to take their eyes off her.\n Many others also had the same thoughts.\n Under the performance stage was a circular dance floor surrounded by a Harmony System high-speed train.\n Cheng Ziang and a group of friends were sitting in a booth. They were staring at Han Wangwang through the window.\n Recently, Cheng Ziang had been wooing Han Wangwang and had not managed to get his hands on her even after more than two months. It was said that that woman was a tough nut to crack. Neither soft nor hard tactics worked on her. \u201cSecond Young Master Cheng, you still haven\u2019t settled that woman called Han Wangwang?\u201d\n Hearing this, Cheng Ziang pursed his lips in frustration. He placed the wine glass heavily on the table, stood up, and said, \u201cJust you wait. Tomorrow morning, she will definitely wake up crying in my bed.\u201d\n When they heard this, everyone had their own thoughts.\n Someone cheered him on. \u201cSecond Young Master Cheng, this is how it should be. Take her down if you are a man!\u201d\n But there was also a man who sincerely treated Cheng Ziang well and treated him as a brother. He grabbed Cheng Ziang\u2019s hand and warned him not to do anything foolish. \u201cSecond Young Master Cheng, you can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make him drink it. Don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang nodded nonchalantly. \u201cI am going out for a breather.\u201d\n After he left, everyone started to discuss the serious condition of Cheng Ziang\u2019s father. \u201cSecond Young Master Cheng\u2019s father is dying. Is this news accurate?\u201d The news of Father Cheng\u2019s illness had already spread and couldn\u2019t be concealed anymore.\n \u201cI heard so. Master Cheng is on his way back. I heard he will reach Wangdong at 11pm tonight.\u201d\n \u201cThen it must be very serious.\u201d\n \u201cI heard from an acquaintance at the hospital that Second Young Master Cheng\u2019s father won\u2019t make it past tonight.\u201d\n Everyone fell silent upon hearing this.\n After a long pause, someone spoke up to break the eerie silence.\n \u201cMaster Cheng is taking over Chuan Dong.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was a far cry from them, who only knew how to enjoy themselves and couldn\u2019t even manage any projects in the company.\n They couldn\u2019t afford to offend Cheng Yanmo.\n \u201cSecond Young Master Cheng is so fortunate to have such an elder brother.\u201d If not for Cheng Yanmo keeping an eye on Cheng Ziang, who knew how many times he would have died.\n Cheng Ziang was troubled, not just because of Han Wangwang.\n He stood in the escape route behind the washroom and smoked. It was quiet here and there was no fawning or mocking from his friends.\n As he squatted in the stairwell, he couldn\u2019t help thinking of what his elder brother had said to him on the phone several hours ago. He had said \u2014\n \u201cZiang, I know you hate father, but he is about to die. I don\u2019t ask you to forgive him. I just hope that you can visit him before he dies. It doesn\u2019t matter if you mock him or pity him. At least, let him see you.\u201d\n It had been a long time since Cheng Ziang last saw his father. He couldn\u2019t quite remember how his father looked like in his old age. But he clearly remembered how his mother looked like after she committed suicide by hanging herself! He remembered how that mistress had laid naked under the master bedroom door, covered in blood!\n Meet him?\n Cheng Ziang snorted and stood up.\n I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll become blind if I meet that person.\n Cheng Ziang walked out of the stairwell and saw a young girl standing in the corridor behind the toilet, pacing back and forth with a hesitant expression.\n \u201cLooking for me?\u201d Cheng Ziang stood behind the girl and stared at her back grimly.\n Su Weiyin was shocked.\n She quickly turned around and saw Cheng Ziang behind her. Su Weiyin stammered. \u201cMr.... Mr. Cheng, I have thought about what you told me previously.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang gave a knowing look.\n Su Weiyin asked Cheng Ziang, \u201cThen will you do what you promised me?\u201d Somehow, Cheng Ziang had gotten hold of the fact that Su Weiyin had an affair with the school leaders and used it to threaten Su Weiyin into helping him.\n Cheng Ziang acknowledged nonchalantly. \u201cThat will depend on your capabilities.\u201d\n Su Weiyin clenched her fists nervously. \u201cI... I will settle everything tonight. Mr. Cheng, it is room 2603 of the Jetta Hotel, right?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang glanced at her and nodded. \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cI understand.\u201d\n Su Weiyin turned and left. Cheng Ziang stared at the girl\u2019s back view without any warmth in his eyes.\n This kind of woman who can easily betray her friends is too disgusting!\n \u2013\n Han Wangwang alighted from the stage and returned to the booth. She saw Jiang Bi sitting there alone playing with her cell phone. She walked up to Jiang Bi and sat down, tapping her finger on the table in front of her.\n Hearing the noise, Jiang Bi turned to look at her.\n Han Wangwang smiled and asked her, \u201cWas I cool just now?\u201d\n Jiang Bi nodded. \u201cVery cool.\u201d\n Han Wangwang asked again, \u201cDo you feel like you\u2019re about to fall in love with me?\u201d\n Jiang Bi shook her head and said sternly, \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n Jiang Bi was being too serious and Han Wangwang felt rather embarrassed.\n She looked around and didn\u2019t see Su Weiyin. A hint of worry surfaced in her eyes. \u201cWhere is Weiyin? Have you seen her?\u201d\n Jiang Bi pointed at the exit. \u201cI saw her leave from there.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n Han Wangwang was about to get up to look for Su Weiyin, when she walked over with three glasses of wine.\n \u201cCome, Wangwang, Jiang Bi, I\u2019ve ordered a cup of \u2018Northern Passenger\u2019 for you guys. This alcohol is especially tasty.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s my treat.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d Han Wangwang took the drink from Su Weiyin\u2019s hand and handed it to Jiang Bi. Jiang Bi glanced at their drinks and noticed that the lemon slice on Han Wangwang\u2019s glass was smaller, while hers and Su Weiyin\u2019s slice was larger.\n Han Wangwang picked up her own glass and was about to drink, when Jiang Bi suddenly pointed at Han Wangwang\u2019s glass. She said, \u201cMy glass has more alcohol. You can have it. I don\u2019t drink much.\u201d\n Han Wangwang and Su Weiyin both blinked.\n [fuzzy]Han Wangwang looked at Su Weiyin and Jiang Bi beside her.\n Han Wangwang was no fool. She had been monitoring Cheng Ziang\u2019s every move and had long discovered that he had contacted Su Weiyin several times in private. Tonight, Su Weiyin had volunteered to come to the nightclub with her. Han Wangwang was giving Su Weiyin a chance to make her move.\n Han Wangwang\u2019s original plan was to take the initiative to fall into Su Weiyin\u2019s trap so that she could make use of this opportunity to achieve her goal.\n However, Jiang Bi\u2019s actions disrupted Han Wangwang\u2019s plans and also Su Weiyin\u2019s.\n Su Weiyin looked at Han Wangwang\u2019s wine and then at Jiang Bi\u2019s. She felt that it was the same. She looked at Jiang Bi anxiously, thinking that this woman might have discovered her plan.\n Holding back her guilt and panic, Su Weiyin said to Jiang Bi, \u201cSo Classmate Jiang Bi can\u2019t drink? Then don\u2019t drink anymore. Our Wangwang is a good drinker.\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d Han Wangwang nodded and smiled at Jiang Bi. \u201cIf you can\u2019t drink, give me your drink. I love this drink.\u201d\n Jiang Bi wanted to remind Han Wangwang that there was something wrong with the alcohol but at that moment, Jiang Bi suddenly noticed Han Wangwang kicking her calf under the table.\n Jiang Bi kept quiet.\n She quietly handed her drink to Han Wangwang.\n Han Wangwang accepted the drink from Jiang Bi. \u201cThank you, Jiang Bi. You are so beautiful and kind-hearted.\u201d Han Wangwang chatted with Su Weiyin and finished the drink.\n Seeing that Han Wangwang had finished the drink, Su Weiyin heaved a sigh of relief. She reached under the table and secretly messaged Cheng Ziang.\n Su Weiyin: [She has already drunk the alcohol.]\n Cheng Ziang had already arrived at the hotel. After reading the message, he started humming happily and went into the bathroom to take a shower.\n \u2013\n At 10pm at night, Han Wangwang suddenly felt dizzy. She said, \u201cI think I am drunk. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n Su Weiyin immediately said, \u201cI will send you back then.\u201d\n Jiang Bi got up and followed behind the two of them.\n Just as they were about to reach the entrance of the bar, Han Wangwang, who was supposed to be drunk, suddenly tugged at Jiang Bi\u2019s clothes. Jiang Bi looked at her silently, considering Han Wangwang\u2019s motive for doing this.\n Han Wangwang should have already discovered that there was something wrong with that glass of wine but still insisted on drinking it. This meant...\n Jiang Bi stared at Su Weiyin\u2019s profile.\n This fool thought she was a mantis preying on cicadas, but she didn\u2019t know that cicadas weren\u2019t cicadas\u2014they were orioles hiding behind their backs. Danger was lurking, but she only thought of the small benefits right in front of her.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "195": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-196\n\n Chapter 195: I Will Serve Justice On Behalf of Heaven!  Jiang Bi understood what Han Wangwang meant.\n After walking out of the bar, Jiang Bi suddenly stopped and called out to Su Weiyin. \u201cI am going to meet a friend. Su Weiyin, send Han Wangwang back to school.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Su Weiyin couldn\u2019t wait for the troublemaker Jiang Bi to get lost.\n Han Wangwang, who was drunk in Su Weiyin\u2019s arms, saw that Jiang Bi was so sensible and instantly felt that this person had a meticulous heart. She decided to be good friends with her in future.\n After Jiang Bi left, she turned a corner and hid herself. She watched as Su Weiyin shoved Han Wangwang into a cab and hailed a cab, following behind them at a steady pace.\n \u2013\n Han Wangwang got even more \u2018drunk\u2019 in the car.\n She started bragging wildly and muttered. \u201cWeiyin, I will only tell you this. My family is very impressive. My grandfather and father are both government officials. My little uncle runs several big companies. My great-grandfather is even more impressive. He can make Wangdong City tremble with just his feet!\u201d\n \u201cAs for me, I am a little princess who is loved and doted on by everyone!\u201d\n Su Weiyin felt very awkward and troubled.\n After the driver heard Han Wangwang\u2019s words, he couldn\u2019t help laughing softly. He turned back and said to Su Weiyin, \u201cThis friend of yours must be drunk. How dare she say that.\u201d Only when one was drunk would one possess wealth and silver.\n Su Weiyin covered Han Wangwang\u2019s mouth and said to the driver, \u201cShe likes to brag. Sorry for letting you see this joke.\u201d\n Han Wangwang slapped Su Weiyin\u2019s hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t cover my mouth, I\u2019m going to vomit!\u201d She shifted her butt, changed into a more comfortable position, and fell asleep.\n After a few minutes, Su Weiyin suddenly woke Han Wangwang up. \u201cWangwang, we are here.\u201d\n The groggy Han Wangwang was pulled out of the car by Su Weiyin and headed towards the hotel.\n Tonight, Zeus Airlines\u2019 celebration party was held at the Jetta International Hotel. It was already past 10pm and the party had already started to disperse. Many well-dressed people were walking out of the hotel in groups to go home.\n Han Wangwang saw that the people who brushed past her were all very well-dressed. She felt that something was off.\n Stopping in her tracks, Han Wangwang looked up and stared at the hotel sign. \u201cJetta International Hotel...\u201d She tugged at Su Weiyin and asked,\u201d Weiyin, why did you bring me to the hotel? \u201d\n Su Weiyin looked slightly uneasy. She said, \u201cThe dormitory is locked. We will stay outside tonight.\u201d\n \u201cThis hotel looks very high-class and expensive, right?\u201d Han Wangwang hugged Su Weiyin\u2019s waist and said, \u201cYou are the best!\u201d\n \u201cI am your best friend. Of course I am good to you.\u201d Su Weiyin brought Han Wangwang into the lift and pressed the button for level 23.\n Bei Zhan had already prepared rooms for the guests. Seeing that it was getting late, Han Zhan also decided to stay at the hotel tonight.\n Han Zhan went to get a room card from Bei Zhan and handed it to Song Ci. \u201cWe will stay at the hotel tonight, room 2206.\u201d\n Song Ci tossed the room card into her bag, held Han Zhan\u2019s hand, and left the banquet hall, preparing to go upstairs to rest.\n There were passenger elevators on both sides of every floor of the Jetta Hotel. There were four elevators on each side. Han Zhan and Song Ci held hands as they arrived at the elevator on the west side.\n Han Zhan pressed the button for all the elevators to go up.\n Seeing that lift number 2 had stopped first, Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s hand and entered lift number 2. Just when the lift was about to close, lift number 4 also opened its door.\n Song Ci glanced across and saw that the person inside the lift looked somewhat familiar. She seemed to know her.\n Wangwang?\n Song Ci was slightly stunned. She hurriedly said to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, look at that girl in the lift opposite. Doesn\u2019t she look like Wangwang?\u201d\n ]Han Zhan glanced across and shook his head. \u201cNot really.\u201d The lift door slowly closed and lift number four could no longer be seen. Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cWangwang is attending a party tonight at the One-Station Bar. It won\u2019t end until midnight.\u201d\n \u201cDid I see wrongly?\u201d\n \u201cI think so.\u201d\n \u201cAlright.\u201d\n Tonight\u2019s party was grand and formal. Ai Lun had specially selected an ice-blue deep V-line fishtail gown in the Lococo style for Song Ci. The gorgeous, exquisite transparent shawl covered Song Ci\u2019s shoulders and chest. Her fair, sexy shoulders were half-hidden and her hazy sexiness was suffocating.\n The dress was a fishtail design that hugged the waist and hips. Afraid that it would affect the effect of the dress, Aaron didn\u2019t allow Song Ci to eat anything for the entire afternoon.\n At the party, Song Ci only drank a little beverage in order to look good. Now that there was no one in the lift, Song Ci rubbed her stomach and asked Han Zhan without much hope, \u201cI\u2019m so hungry. Brother Han, is there anything I can eat?\u201d\n Han Zhan really took out two pieces of toffee from his pocket. \u201cOnly this.\u201d Who would have thought that the big boss of Zeus Corporation would always have two pieces of toffee in his suit pocket?\n At this point, there was no need for Song Ci to be picky. She peeled off the wrapper and popped it into her mouth. The sweet taste filled her mouth and Song Ci was revived.\n Returning to the hotel, the first thing Song Ci did was to get Han Zhan to help her zip down her dress and save herself from the tight-fitting gown.\n She put on the hotel bathrobe and walked towards the bathroom while saying to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, help me order some supper. I\u2019m going to go crazy if I don\u2019t eat anything soon!\u201d\n Han Zhan, \u201d Okay.\u201d\n After calling for two sets of midnight snacks, Han Zhan put down the phone, sat by the bed, looked up at the ceiling, and narrowed his eyes.\n ...\n In lift 4.\n Han Wangwang was still lying on top of Su Weiyin, her eyes narrowed and she looked very drunk. She was still talking nonsense. Su Weiyin listened intently and heard Han Wangwang say, \u201cWeiyin, do you know? I am a very vengeful person. Whoever bullies me will be bullied even more. So Weiyin, you must love me well and not do anything to let me down.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I get angry, I\u2019ll turn my back on you.\u201d\n As she was drunk, Han Wangwang\u2019s voice sounded weak and non-threatening.\n After hearing this, Su Weiyin suspected that Han Wangwang knew about her deal with Cheng Ziang and was warning her not to do anything stupid.\n But Su Weiyin felt that it was impossible. She had done this secretly and Han Wangwang should not have noticed.\n Perhaps Han Wangwang was a girl who loved to brag when she was drunk.\n Thinking of this, Su Weiyin quickly calmed down. She supported Han Wangwang and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will treat you well. You are my good friend.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, Wei Yin is the best.\u201d\n Han Wangwang\u2019s cell phone suddenly vibrated. She secretly took it out and saw that it was a message from her little uncle.\n Han Zhan: [You must protect yourself well.] Han Wangwang replied the other party with a puppy-dog look, kept her ll phone, leaned against Su Weiyin\u2019s shoulder, and continued to pretend to be drunk.\n Ding...\n The lift door opened and Su Weiyin helped Han Wangwang out.\n Their flat shoes made almost no sound on the soft fur carpet.\n Walking up to Room 2306, Su Weiyin took out her card, opened the door, and helped Han Wangwang inside.\n Han Wangwang was brought to the bed by Su Weiyin. She sat on the bed with her body tilted sideways, ready to fall asleep at any time. Su Weiyin grabbed Han Wangwang\u2019s arm and helped her take off her down jacket and short jacket before laying her down flat.\n Han Wangwang turned over and laid on the bed. \u201cI\u2019 m so sleepy. I\u2019 m going to bed.\u201d With that, Han Wangwang pressed a pillow over her head and fell into a deep sleep.\n Su Weiyin sat aside and waited for more than 10 minutes. After confirming that Han Wangwang had really fainted from the effects of the medicine, she stood up.\n Su Weiyin walked to another small bedroom in the suite and knocked on the door.\n The door was opened. Cheng Ziang, who was only wearing a bathrobe, stood behind the door. His eyes were dark as he stared at Su Weiyin. \u201cEverything is settled?\u201d\n Su Weiyin was slightly afraid of Cheng Ziang. She didn\u2019t even dare to look straight at him. She just lowered her head and said, \u201cWangwang has already fallen asleep.\u201d\n She looked up fearfully again and stared into Cheng Ziang\u2019s malicious eyes. Su Weiyin\u2019s heart shuddered, but she still mustered up the courage to ask Cheng Ziang, \u201cMr. Cheng, I have already done what you asked me to do. Can you return those photos to me?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang lifted his chin toward the inside of the room.\n Su Weiyin followed his gaze and looked inside. She saw a leather folder on the table.\n She hurried into the room, picked up the leather folder, opened the document, and checked the contents. Su Weiyin was slightly relieved to see that both the photo and the original USB flash drive were inside.\n She asked Cheng Ziang boldly, \u201cMr. Cheng, do you have a backup copy of these photos?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang sneered. \u201cDo I need a backup for you?\u201d\n The corners of Su Weiyin\u2019s eyes twitched. She hugged the leather folder and ran off.\n Walking into the living room, Su Weiyin stopped and turned to look at Han Wangwang. A look of pity and guilt flashed across her eyes, but she still carried the folder and left the suite quickly.\n Opposite the hotel was a small park built along the river. The park was nearly empty at night. Su Weiyin crossed the road to the park. She took out a lighter that she had already prepared and lit up a photo, preparing to destroy it.\n Halfway through burning the photos, a skinny but long-fingered hand suddenly reached out and grabbed the photo, pulling it away from Su Weiyin\u2019s palm.\n Su Weiyin looked up in shock and met a pair of cold, mocking eyes. She exclaimed. \u201cWhy is it you?\u201d\n Su Weiyin looked at Jiang Bi with a very pale face. \u201cDidn\u2019t you leave because of something...\u201d\n Jiang Bi used her foot to put out the fire in the photo. She bent down to pick it up and looked down to see two other people kissing in the photo.\n \u201cYou got together with the dean?\u201d Jiang Bi\u2019s pleasant voice was laced with sarcasm.\n Su Weiyin\u2019s face was pale.\n \u201cReturn the photo to me!\u201d She reached out her hands to snatch the photo back. Jiang Bi had already taken the photo and stood a meter away without much action.\n Flicking the photo in her hand, Jiang Bi said, \u201cSu Weiyin, someone like you is not worthy of having friends.\u201d\n Jiang Bi bent over to take the leather folder. How could Su Weiyin just stand by and watch Jiang Bi take it away? She had just escaped from Cheng Ziang\u2019s trap and could not fall into Jiang Bi\u2019s trap again.\n Su Weiyin reached out to stop her, but to her surprise, Jiang Bi lifted her right leg and kicked Su Weiyin.\n Su Weiyin fell to the ground, her chest hurting.\n Jiang Bi picked up the leather folder and stood up. She stood up straight and looked down. She asked Su Weiyin, \u201cWhich room is Han Wangwang in?\u201d\n Su Weiyin\u2019s pupils quivered slightly. She said in a small voice, \u201c2408.\u201d\n Jiang Bi said, \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d When a person was lying, their gaze would be different.\n Su Weiyin said, \u201cI\u2019m not. She\u2019s at 240...\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, Jiang Bi grabbed her chin. Jiang Bi\u2019s fingers looked very thin, but they were very strong.\n Su Weiyin\u2019s chin was nearly crushed by her.\n Jiang Bi\u2019s voice was frosty. \u201cRoom number!\u201d Her patience was wearing thin.\n Su Weiyin was so scared that she looked like she was about to cry. She said, \u201c2306!\u201d\n Only after confirming that Su Weiyin was not lying this time did Jiang Bi release her chin. She looked at Su Weiyin with disgust as if she was a maggot. Jiang Bi cursed. \u201cGet lost!\u201d\n Su Weiyin was scared by Jiang Bi\u2019s cold eyes. Trembling, she stood up, clutched her chest, turned, and ran away.\n \u2013\n In the hotel suite, Cheng Ziang came to the side of the bed. He stared at Han Wangwang\u2019s back for a while, before taking out the camera he had prepared long ago.\n Cheng Ziang placed the camera on the television cabinet and aimed it at the bed. He wanted to ensure that the camera panned out and captured everything that happened on the bed.\n Cheng Ziang took off his bathrobe, walked slowly to the bed, and knelt down beside Han Wangwang.\n He flipped Han Wangwang over.\n Han Wangwang was drooling from her sleep. She even burped when she was flipped over, completely unaware that danger was approaching.\n Cheng Ziang frowned slightly at the smell of alcohol.\n He waved his right hand in front of his nose before removing Han Wangwang\u2019s halter top.\n Her clothes were taken off and Han Wangwang\u2019s fair and smooth skin was exposed to the air. It was as flawless as milk and it was bewitching.\n A glint of astonishment flashed across Cheng Ziang\u2019s eyes.\n She\u2019s indeed a rare gem!\n My three months of pursuit are not in vain.\n Cheng Ziang unbuckled Han Wangwang\u2019s belt again and reached out to undo the buttons on her pants.\n As he placed his hands on the button, before he could undo it, the girl who should have been sound asleep suddenly spoke. \u201cMr. Cheng, I didn\u2019t know you were so shameless.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang was stunned.\n He looked up and saw that Han Wangwang had already awoken. Her eyes were open and clear. She didn\u2019t look drunk at all.\n What else did Cheng Ziang not understand? \u201cYou were pretending.\u201d He was slightly surprised that he had belittled this girl.\n Han Wangwang kicked Cheng Ziang.\n Cheng Ziang noticed it and was prepared, but Han Wangwang\u2019s kick still knocked him off the bed. As he rolled off the bed and sprawled on the floor, Cheng Ziang was still in a daze.\n Is Han Wangwang so strong?\n She clearly looks rather skinny, but why is she as strong as an ox?\n Cheng Ziang vaguely felt that something was off, but he couldn\u2019t figure it out.\n Han Wangwang stood up from the bed and looked down at the man on the floor. Her lips curled into a disdainful smile. \u201cCheng Ziang, have you heard of this saying? If you stand by the river frequently, your shoes will get wet.\u201d\n Han Wangwang got off the bed and grabbed the red wine on the cupboard. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve used such despicable means on a girl, right? Do you think I\u2019m as easy to bully as those girls?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang got up and stared coldly at the red wine bottle in Han Wangwang\u2019s hand. \u201cYou want to hit me?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang thought it was funny. \u201cWangwang, it\u2019s cute to be a little hot, but you will choke to death if you are too hot.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang revealed his identity that he was proud of and threatened Han Wangwang. \u201cI am the Second Young Master of Chuan Dong Group. That building in your school is built by my family using money. If you throw this bottle down, your studies and the rest of your life will be ruined.\u201d\n So Wangwang, be a good girl and put down the bottle. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to bear the consequences.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang was very adept at threatening others. It was clear that he frequently did so.\n It was not like he had never met a girl who was so stubborn, but they had no power or influence and couldn\u2019t afford to offend him. In the end, they all listened to him. Cheng Ziang was also sure that Han Wangwang would be intimidated by him and not dare to rebel.\n Cheng Ziang\u2019s threat made Han Wangwang laugh.\n \u201cChuan Dong Second Young Master...\u201d Han Wangwang smiled maliciously.\u201d Trying to use your status to bully me? \u201cHan Wangwang raised her wine bottle and knocked it hard on Cheng Ziang\u2019s head.\n Bang!\n The bottle broke and the sharp glass shards landed on the carpet.\n The floor of the hotel room was covered in carpet. It was very thick and soundproof. The glass bottle shattered on the floor but didn\u2019t make much noise.\n The red wine flowed down Cheng Ziang\u2019s face and across his chest.\n Cheng Ziang didn\u2019t expect Han Wangwang to be so ruthless after knowing his identity. He was caught off guard and was stunned by Han Wangwang\u2019s smash.\n Cheng Ziang\u2019s body swayed as he stumbled backwards. In the end, his right hand grabbed onto the table of the television cabinet to steady himself.\n As soon as he stabilized himself, Han Wangwang strode over and wrapped her arms tightly around Cheng Ziang\u2019s head. She then used her knee to knock hard against Cheng Ziang\u2019s stomach.\n Cheng Ziang didn\u2019t expect Han Wangwang to really dare to hit him. He snapped out of his trance and started to retaliate.\n He raised his right hand and was about to slap Han Wangwang. But before his hand could reach Han Wangwang\u2019s face, Han Wangwang caught it.\n After grabbing Cheng Ziang\u2019s wrist, Han Wangwang used her shoulder strength to pull the 1.8-meter-tall Cheng Ziang up, causing him to spin in the air before being mercilessly smashed to the ground!\n Bang!\n With that, the entire floor of the room trembled.\n Downstairs, Song Ci and Han Zhan were having supper. She peeled a quail egg and offered it to Han Zhan. \u201cHere, Brother Han, have a quail egg to nourish your protein.\u201d\n Han Zhan opened his mouth and bit the quail egg.\n Song Ci picked up another quail egg. Before she started to peel it, she suddenly heard a dull thud upstairs.\n The two of them exchanged glances and realized that something was off.\n The Jetta Hotel\u2019s soundproofing is excellent. What exactly happened upstairs to cause such a big commotion?!\n Han Wangwang tossed Cheng Ziang over her shoulder onto the floor. His back landed on the glass shards and his skin was instantly cut. Blood mixed with red wine and stained the carpet.\n All the bones in Cheng Ziang\u2019s body were about to fall apart as he grunted in pain.\n Han Wangwang turned again, lifted her right leg gracefully, and stepped hard on Cheng Ziang\u2019s weak spot.\n \u201cAh!\u201d Cheng Ziang\u2019s face turned pale from the pain.\n Han Wangwang maliciously stepped on Cheng Ziang a few times. Seeing that Cheng Ziang was in so much pain that his tendons were all standing up, Han Wangwang bent down and gave him a few tight slaps across the face.\n \u201cDo you really like to use your hands to hit people?\u201d Her uncle asked her to give Cheng Ziang a good beating, just like how men would beat up women.\n Tugging at Cheng Ziang\u2019s twisted cheeks, Han Wangwang smiled mischievously and said, \u201cYou are the Second Young Master of Chuan Dong. So what if you are rich? You can violate girls as and when you like?\u201d\n \u201cLet me tell you, today, this darling will uphold justice on behalf of the heavens and beat you to death, you dog!\u201d\n Han Wangwang clenched her right fist and punched Cheng Ziang\u2019s collarbone and chest. These were all places where the pain was sharp but not easy to leave scars.\n Cheng Ziang was like a fish being butchered on a chopping board. He was beaten to death and on the verge of death. Only then did Han Wangwang stop his unilateral attack.\n Their little uncle had said that they could beat someone till he wished he was rather dead than alive, but not to death. They were from the Han Family and would never do anything illegal.\n Han Wangwang shifted her feet away from Cheng Ziang and rubbed her feet against the carpet in disdain.\n She shot a disgusted look at Cheng Ziang, who was covering his sensitive area and wailing in pain. She said, \u201cTake this beating as revenge for those girls you bullied.\u201d\n With that, Han Wangwang entered the washroom to wash her hands and carefully disinfect them with antiseptic solution, before returning to her room to pick up her bag.\n Just as Han Wangwang was about to walk around Cheng Ziang and leave, she heard him curse weakly. \u201cHan Wangwang, I am going to kill you. I am going to put you in jail. You will get sued!\u201d\n Han Wangwang stopped in her tracks and looked down at Cheng Ziang arrogantly. \u201cIf you wish to fight a lawsuit, please get your lawyer to contact my father, Han Wanglong. My father and I will be waiting for your lawyer to hold us accountable!\u201d\n \u201cChuan Dong Second Young Master, I will await your arrival!\u201d With that, Han Wangwang slung her bag over her shoulder and left!\n Cheng Ziang was in so much pain that he was in a daze. The name \u201cHan Wanglong\u201d sounded familiar, but he couldn\u2019t remember where he had heard it before.\n Cheng Ziang got up and slowly crawled to the side of the bed. He reached for his cell phone and called the ambulance.\n After the call, Cheng Ziang noticed that the camera was still filming. He stared at the camera and threw it away angrily. The camera rolled off the television cabinet.\n \u2013\n Han Wangwang went downstairs but didn\u2019t feel relieved. Instead, she was furious.\n She rushed to the front desk and said to the young man there, \u201cHi, I want to report the guest in room 2306 of your hotel, Cheng Ziang. He drugged my drink and tried to rape me!\u201d\n \u201cHe even took a photo with his camera. It\u2019s in the hotel room. You can go and take a look if you don\u2019t believe me!\u201d\n Hearing this, all the hotel staff were shocked. The Jetta International Hotel was the cleanest hotel in the country. Violence was the most intolerable thing.\n The young man at the front desk immediately called the police and apologized to Han Wangwang. He said that it was the hotel management\u2019s fault and that they were willing to compensate Han Wangwang.\n Han Wangwang didn\u2019t make things difficult for them as she saw that the other party was very polite and was quick to call the police. She gave the excuse that she needed to go home to rest after being scared, and left her phone number and address.\n After she left, the young man at the front desk hurriedly called the manager and the night shift security officer over to take a look. A group of people arrived at the 23rd floor in a grandiose manner. Walking out of the lift, they bumped into Han Zhan and his wife.\n The manager knew Han Zhan and knew that his room was on the 22nd floor downstairs. The manager stopped in front of them and asked Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, may I know what\u2019s the matter? Your room is on the 22nd floor. Did you enter the wrong room?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head and told him, \u201cDid something happen to our guest upstairs? We heard a huge commotion in the room just now. It sounded like someone was thrown to the ground.\u201d\n The manager looked slightly hesitant as he considered whether to tell Han Zhan the truth. At this moment, Li Li and Su Beibei heard voices in the corridor. They opened the door to Room 2304 and walked out.\n Li Li was now Zeus Corporation\u2019s vice president. Upon seeing Li Li, the hotel manager hurriedly bowed respectfully to him. \u201cCEO Li, Miss Su, sorry to disturb you two.\u201d\n Li Li waved at the manager and looked at Han Zhan. \u201cMr. Han, why are you here?\u201d\n Han Zhan repeated his words.\n Li Li understood Han Zhan\u2019s thoughts the most. He knew that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t the kind of person to poke his nose into other people\u2019s business. If Mr. Han specially came over to watch the show, something major must have happened in Room 2306.\n It would be a waste not to watch!\n Li Li said to the manager, \u201cDon\u2019t let anything happen to the guest. Quick, go over and ask!\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The manager knocked on the door of room 2306 but no one answered.\n The manager was caught in a dilemma. The young man at the front desk said in a low voice, \u201cThat girl said she beat up Mr. Cheng. Could he have been beaten to death...\u201d\n Hearing that, the manager\u2019s face changed. \u201cQuick, open the door!\u201d\n The young man hurriedly took out his card and opened the door.\n A group of people filed in.\n Inside the room, Cheng Ziang was grabbing a white bedsheet and trying hard to cover his naked body with it. Before he could cover himself properly, the door was opened.\n Cheng Ziang looked up at the group of people at the door .\u201d...\u201d\n Recognizing that the disheveled man sitting by the bed was Cheng Ziang, Song Ci widened her eyes in shock. Han Zhan immediately covered Song Ci\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look, it\u2019ll dirty your eyes.\u201d\n Hearing this, Li Li quickly covered Su Beibei\u2019s eyes.\n When Cheng Ziang discovered that his old friend Song Ci was among the people who had barged in, he felt like dying.\n The manager snapped out of his trance and exclaimed. \u201cMr. Cheng, your head...\u201d Cheng Ziang\u2019s head was still bleeding profusely from the red wine bottle. It was a terrible sight.\n Cheng Ziang rubbed his head and felt the blood on his hand. His face twitched as he roared. \u201cFind that woman!\u201d\n After shouting, Cheng Ziang finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and fainted.\n ]Seeing this, Li Li said in a low voice to the manager, \u201cQuickly cover his body up for me!\u201d\n The manager and the receptionist covered Cheng Ziang\u2019s body with the bedsheets. Only then did Han Zhan and Li Li remove their hands from their lovers\u2019 faces.\n Song Ci stared at the red wine bottle on the floor, as well as the naked Cheng Ziang. What else could she not understand? One look and she knew that this was Cheng Ziang trying to force himself on a girl, but instead of doing so, he got beaten up instead.\n No wonder Cheng Ziang liked to hit women. He had been beaten up by women before.\n The ambulance arrived first.\n Cheng Ziang was seriously injured, especially at his lower body. A life was at stake and the hotel manager couldn\u2019t bear the crime of the Chuan Dong Group\u2019s Second Young Master dying at the Jetta International Hotel. He hurriedly got the ambulance to take Cheng Ziang away.\n After Cheng Ziang was dragged away by the ambulance, the police arrived.\n he manager handed the camera to the police and gave Han Wangwang\u2019s contact number to them. He said, \u201cPolice officers, you guys have to investigate this properly. You can\u2019t malign a good person.\u201d\n He had seen too many cases where money was used to pressure the guilty into turning the tables, clearing the guilty\u2019s name, and accusing the victim of being \u201cguilty\u201d. He was slightly worried for that girl.\n The police took the evidence and promised. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t wrong every good person or let every bad person off.\u201d With that, they left.\n Only after the police left did Song Ci and Han Zhan return to their rooms.\n Sitting by the bed, Song Ci said to Han Zhan, \u201cDid you hear what that doctor said just now? He said that Cheng Ziang\u2019s second son is seriously injured and is probably impotent now.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at her with a faint smile and asked, \u201cWhy? Are you feeling sorry?\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s tone was sour.\n Song Ci rolled her eyes at him. \u201cDon\u2019t malign me.\u201d Song Ci laid down on the bed and rested her head on her hands. She gazed at the ceiling and said with a sigh, \u201cI am very curious about who that heroine who beat up Cheng Ziang is. From today onwards, she is my idol!\u201d\n Beating Cheng Ziang up was Song Ci\u2019s ultimate dream. She couldn\u2019t do it and someone else did. Of course Song Ci admired that person.\n Only then did Han Zhan feel better. \u201cAlright, sleep early. This has nothing to do with us.\u201d His face was cold as if it really had nothing to do with him.\n Song Ci had never suspected that Han Zhan had anything to do with Cheng Ziang\u2019s injuries. Hearing this, she rolled into Han Zhan\u2019s arms and fell asleep.\n \u2013\n After Han Wangwang left the Jetta Hotel, she walked to a small park by the river opposite the hotel and sat down on a stone chair.\n She was in a very bad mood. In fact, she felt rather terrible.\n She knew very well that if not for the fact that she had already taken precautions against Cheng Ziang and sensed that he was secretly in contact with Su Weiyin, she would have ended up like those girls who had been hurt and deceived by Cheng Ziang.\n After beating up Cheng Ziang, it was time to settle this score with Su Weiyin.\n Han Wangwang stood up and walked to the side of the road to wait for a cab.\n After standing there for two minutes, a black figure suddenly approached her. Han Wangwang looked over warily and was shocked to see Jiang Bi.\n \u201cJiang Bi!\u201d Han Wangwang was shocked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you leave early for something?\u201d\n Jiang Bi\u2019s hand hung by her leg as she held a paper bag. Hearing this, she lifted the leather bag and handed it to Han Wangwang. \u201cI got it from Su Weiyin.\u201d\n Han Wangwang was stunned.\n She took the document, opened it, and took a few glances. She understood everything. So Cheng Ziang had used this to threaten Su Weiyin.\n Han Wangwang felt very pathetic for being betrayed by Su Weiyin so easily. Friendship was like a glass door that could be broken with a single knock.\n Han Wangwang looked at Jiang Bi meaningfully. She suddenly pursed her lips and laughed. \u201cYou are quite interesting.\u201d\n Not knowing what Han Wangwang was trying to say, Jiang Bi explained. \u201cI just felt that something was off tonight. I was worried that something would happen to you, so I followed you guys.\u201d\n \u201cIt is indeed abnormal.\u201d Not sure how much Jiang Bi knew, Han Wangwang asked her directly, \u201cYou went upstairs just now?\u201d\n Jiang Bi hesitated for a moment before nodding. \u201cMmm, I went. I heard you beating someone up until they cried for their parents while they were locked up.\u201d Perhaps she felt that the Han Wangwang who beat someone up was too different from her usual obedient and quiet self in the dormitory, Jiang Bi couldn\u2019t help laughing.\n Han Wangwang\u2019s heart wavered as she stared at Jiang Bi\u2019s smile. Before she could react, she said, \u201cYou look so good when you smile.\u201d\n Jiang Bi was stunned and looked puzzled. \u201cLike flowers in spring?\u201d\n Shaking her head sternly, Han Wangwang corrected Jiang Bi. \u201cNo, like a snow lotus on a tall mountain.\u201d\n Jiang Bi was slightly embarrassed by her compliments and her ears turned slightly red.\n \u201cYou still know how to be shy!\u201d Han Wangwang seemed to have discovered a new world. She leaned over, stood on tiptoe, and rubbed Jiang Bi\u2019s ear. Jiang Bi\u2019s body stiffened.\n Realizing that Jiang Bi was unable to release herself, her muscles tensed up slightly. Han Wangwang felt that she was exceptionally adorable. \u201cYou are so innocent, pure little sister?\u201d\n Jiang Bi stood there awkwardly, not moving at all. Only when Han Wangwang retreated did Jiang Bi feel her breathing stabilize.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go. We won\u2019t be going back to the dormitory tonight. I\u2019ll bring you to a room.\u201d Han Wangwang stuffed the bag into her backpack. She pulled Jiang Bi\u2019s hand and left, not noticing the strange look in her eyes.\n \u201cI\u2019 m inviting you to stay at the Greenhouse. I\u2019 m a member there and it\u2019s cheap with discounts.\u201d Han Wangwang pulled Jiang Bi along as they walked towards Greenhouse. Jiang Bi followed closely behind her. She looked like she wanted to say something but stopped in the end.\n Arriving at the hotel, Han Wangwang asked for a double room.\n Returning to her room, Han Wangwang chose a bed and sat down cross-legged. She took out the photo from the leather folder and admired it one by one. She clicked her tongue. \u201cThis dean is such a beast.\u201d\n \u201cHis wife just gave birth and is still in her confinement period. He and Su Weiyin must have gotten together a long time ago.\u201d Han Wangwang felt disgusted at the thought of the dean getting together with his female student behind his wife\u2019s back.\n She immediately opened the hotel\u2019s computer, inserted the USB flash drive, and copied the photos one by one onto the Wangdong University Forum.\n Han Wangwang\u2019s caption was very attractive \u2014\n [The dean of a certain law school cheated on his pregnant wife with a female student. How can such a person be a role model?]\n After the caption was written, Han Wangwang attached the photos as well. She even created an infuriating caption for each photo before sending it.\n After doing all of this, she was in a good mood and even felt very good while sleeping.\n Turning off the computer, she turned back to see that Jiang Bi had already fallen asleep. The sleeping Jiang Bi was in a very obedient position. Her hands were placed in front of her chest and her legs were crossed. It was a very standard sleeping position.\n Han Wangwang walked over to Jiang Bi\u2019s bed and bent over to hold her hand.\n Jiang Bi suddenly opened her eyes. A cold glint flashed across her eyes. Realizing that it was Han Wangwang, Jiang Bi was stunned. She asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n Her voice was not as melodious as before. Instead, it was slightly deeper.\n Like...\n Like a man?\n Han Wangwang didn\u2019t think too much of it. She just thought that Jiang Bi\u2019s throat was parched because she was sleeping and that her voice had changed slightly.\n She hurriedly explained. \u201cMy grandfather said not to put your hands on your chest when you\u2019re sleeping. You won\u2019t be able to catch your breath and will have nightmares easily. This is the reason why people always say that they have sleep paralysis.\u201d\n Jiang Bi took her hands off her chest and placed them by her sides.\n \u201cThank you.\u201d Her voice was back to its usual cadence, slightly slow and melodious.\n Han Wangwang nodded and laid down on her bed.\n Before going to bed, she didn\u2019t forget to send Han Zhan a message to inform him of the progress.\n \u2013\n Meanwhile, after Cheng Yanmo alighted from the plane, he hurried over to the hospital.\n In a certain ward on the VIP level, many of the board of directors and major shareholders of Chuan Dong Group were seated.\n On the bed, Old CEO Cheng looked like he was dying. He was wearing a ventilator and his eyes were slightly squinted. Occasionally, he would turn his head. No one knew what he was waiting for.\n Hearing the sound of leather shoes hitting the floor in the corridor, someone walked out to take a look and suddenly shouted in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s Eldest Young Master!\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo handed his coat to his subordinate. His tall frame squeezed into the ward, making it even more crowded. The crowd naturally parted to allow Cheng Yanmo to walk to the bed.\n Everyone\u2019s eyes changed when they saw him.\n With Old CEO Cheng\u2019s death, Chuan Dong Group would be under Cheng Yanmo\u2019s control from now on.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "196": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-197\n\n Chapter 196: Bear with It When You Must, Be Harsh When You Need To  Like stars surrounding the moon, Cheng Yanmo arrived beside Old CEO Cheng\u2019s bed. Lowering his eyes, he looked at his father, who was sitting on the sickbed, struggling to catch his breath. Cheng Yanmo\u2019s expression remained calm and composed.\n \u201cFather.\u201d\n Hearing his eldest son\u2019s voice, Cheng Zhanxiong widened his eyes.\n Cheng Zhanxiong realized that his eldest son was the only one by the bed, but his youngest son Cheng Ziang was nowhere to be seen. His eyes dimmed slightly. \u201cWhere... where is Ziang?\u201d In his weak state, Cheng Zhanxiong couldn\u2019t even say Cheng Ziang\u2019s name clearly.\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t answer his question. Instead, he glanced sideways at the directors and shareholders standing in the ward.\n Seeing Cheng Yanmo look over, everyone knew that this father-son duo had private matters to discuss and left the ward in unison. Cheng Yanmo\u2019s subordinates guarded the door of the ward, not allowing anyone to get close.\n Cheng Yanmo dragged a chair over and placed it beside the bed. He sat down and massaged his tired temples before answering Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s question. \u201cZiang has something on and can\u2019t make it.\u201d\n There was phlegm in Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s throat. He opened his mouth and made a sound, as if accusing Cheng Ziang of being unfilial.\n Cheng Yanmo gazed quietly at his dying father, who was still trying to act all high and mighty. His expression was impassive, as if he was watching a stranger struggling in pain.\n Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s agitated emotions gradually calmed down. His voice came out intermittently from under the ventilator. \u201cHe... hates me. He ... won\u2019t meet me. But I... I am his father. His father.\u201d\n How dare he not come and see me one last time?\n Hearing Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s words, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes were suddenly filled with mockery. \u201cYes, you are indeed our father. But you are also the murderer who murdered our mother.\u201d\n Cheng Zhanxiong was shocked to hear such rebellious words from Cheng Yanmo.\n All along, Cheng Yanmo had always appeared kind and polite in front of everyone. Although he didn\u2019t show much respect to his father, he wouldn\u2019t openly defy him either.\n This was the first time Cheng Yanmo spoke of his mother to Cheng Zhanxiong with such a resentful tone.\n Cheng Zhanxiong found it both laughable and pathetic. \u201cWhy? Even you hate me?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t answer Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s question. However, the pair of pitch-black eyes behind the monocle turned increasingly dark, like dark clouds in a stormy sky.\n Cheng Zhanxiong understood.\n He snorted and asked Cheng Yanmo, \u201cSince you hate me so much, why don\u2019t you seek revenge on me for your mother?\u201d\n Hearing this, Cheng Yanmo finally spoke up. His tone was as calm and cold as usual. \u201cI hate you because you made us brothers become motherless children. I won\u2019t take revenge on you because you\u2019re my father.\u201d\n That is all!\n If he wasn\u2019t Cheng Yanmo\u2019s mother, Cheng Zhanxiong would have already been cut into pieces.\n When his mother passed away, Cheng Yanmo was already in his teens.\n He was the elder brother. Cheng Ziang could do whatever he wanted, but not Cheng Yanmo. From a young age, his grandfather had told Cheng Yanmo that he would be the future successor of Chuan Dong Group and that he couldn\u2019t act on impulse.\n He would always remember his grandfather\u2019s words:\n He had to endure when necessary and be ruthless when needed.\n As a result, although he hated Cheng Zhanxiong to the core, before he gained full control of the corporation, Cheng Yanmo would never show any obvious displeasure or hatred towards him.\n Anyone who threw an egg at a rock was a fool.\n Cheng Zhanxiong had suffered a major blow from his eldest son.\n He had always thought that his eldest son respected and loved him. Little did he know that his eldest son\u2019s obedience was just a facade.\n Although Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s private life was messy when he was young, he only had two children\u2014Cheng Yanmo and Cheng Ziang. Even in death, his two sons still hated him. This made Cheng Zhanxiong feel like a failure.\n Cheng Yanmo suddenly looked down at his watch. It was already past midnight and the needle was pointing past 12. He suddenly said to Cheng Zhanxiong, \u201cWhen my mother passed away, it was after 5.07 in the afternoon.\u201d\n Hearing Cheng Yanmo\u2019s random words, Cheng Zhanxiong was puzzled. \u201cYou...\u201d He wanted to ask Cheng Yanmo, what did he mean by that? But he felt short of breath and found it difficult to speak.\n At this point, Cheng Yanmo slowly stood up and bowed deeply to Cheng Zhanxiong. He said, \u201cFather, the world is full of hardships. Rest in peace. I hope you can reunite with my mother in the netherworld.\u201d\n With that, under Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s terrified gaze, Cheng Yanmo reached out and took Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s ventilator away expressionlessly.\n Cheng Zhanxiong was already holding his breath. Without the ventilator\u2019s help, he could only exhale and not inhale.\n Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s eyes started to quiver as he stared at Cheng Yanmo. He lifted his trembling fingers as if he wanted to scold him but also wanted to curse him at the same time.\n Cheng Yanmo stood quietly by the side. Looking at Cheng Zhanxiong pointing at his chest, he smiled and said, \u201cFather, don\u2019t worry and leave. Don\u2019t miss the auspicious hour. I will manage the company very well. Rest in peace...\u201d\n Cheng Zhanxiong widened his eyes and muttered incoherently. \u201cYou... you are inhuman...\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo\u2019s expression remained unchanged. \u201cYou were the one who stopped being human first. You can\u2019t blame me for being inhumane.\u201d\n Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s fingers were trembling even more violently. He was so agitated that his eyes widened and he died on the spot! Cheng Yanmo watched helplessly as Cheng Zhanxiong took his last breath. He then glanced down at his watch.\n .07am.\n Very good.\n Lowering his eyes to stare at Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s body, Cheng Yanmo picked up the ventilator and put it on for him. He then gently closed Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s eyes. After doing all that, Cheng Yanmo turned and walked out.\n Pulling open the door, Cheng Yanmo bowed his head and walked out. His hands were clasped quietly in front of his chest, his expression solemn and silent.\n Everyone noticed that the eldest young master had come out and turned to look at Cheng Yanmo.\n From Cheng Yanmo\u2019s pained expression, they got some information.\n He\u2019s gone!\n An older director asked in a trembling voice, \u201cOld CEO Cheng is gone?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo looked up and stared at the familiar faces before him. He nodded and said in a clear, steady voice, \u201cMy father, Cheng Zhanxiong, passed away at 12.07am on 26 December 2020.\u201d\n Everyone fell silent when they heard this.\n Half a second later, someone questioned unhappily. \u201cEldest Young Master, what exactly is Second Young Master busy with? Why can\u2019t he even see Old Man Cheng for the last time? Even... even if he has hatred in his heart, it has been so many years. He should let it go.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo glanced at that person calmly. He smiled and opened his thin lips elegantly, but his words were cold.\n \u201cUncle Zhang, if your father has an affair in your house, messes around on his and your mother\u2019s wedding bed, and is seen by your mother at the scene... your mother kills the mistress in a fit of anger, stabs your father, and then hangs herself at your chandelier. When you return from school, push open the door, and see your mother hanging in the middle of the living room, the mistress lying dead on the floor, and your injured father dying...\u201d\n A cold glint flashed across Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf you can still be magnanimous and treat your father well after everything that has happened to you, I will really admire you. Really, rather than being a businessman, perhaps you should be a priest. After all, it has always been the duty of a priest to persuade people to let go of their hatred.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo had a smile on his face, but his words were harsh and sharp.\n The old man whom he had addressed as Uncle Zhang turned red with anger. \u201cCheng Yanmo, don\u2019t bully me! I am already so old, how can I tolerate your slander?\u201d Uncle Zhang was insulted by Cheng Yanmo\u2019s harsh words and his voice became unsteady.\n Cheng Yanmo gazed calmly at Director Zhang. He was as arrogant as ever. \u201cUncle Zhang, you have never experienced the pain of others. Don\u2019t try to persuade them to be magnanimous.\u201d\n Everyone could tell that after Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s death, Cheng Yanmo, who had become the absolute power behind Chuan Dong Group, had already become formidable. If the Cheng Yanmo of the past was a woodcutter with a sharp edge, now he was a sharp knife with a sharp edge. Who would dare to provoke him?\n Cheng Yanmo was good at business and was even more outstanding than his father, Cheng Zhanxiong. They were all in the same boat because of their own benefits and had to rely on Cheng Yanmo to bring them endless wealth.\n However reluctant they were to offend old CEO Cheng in the past, they were equally as unwilling to offend Cheng Yanmo.\n Not wanting to see Uncle Zhang enrage Cheng Yanmo, everyone quickly tried to mediate. \u201cOld Brother Zhang, don\u2019t lower yourself to Yanmo\u2019s level. Zhanxiong just left and Yanmo is just feeling very upset and spoke without thinking. Please understand him.\u201d\n He was lying through his teeth! Director Zhang glanced at Cheng Yanmo\u2019s calm face and didn\u2019t see any hint of sadness.\n Someone else advised Uncle Zhang. \u201cYes, yes. Everyone knows that the eldest young master and Zhanxiong are very close. If Zhan Xiong suddenly dies, the eldest young master might still be shocked, so his words might not be pleasant. Old Zhang, don\u2019t be angry at him.\u201d\n This group of people were fence sitters and recognized the situation. They seemed to want to follow Cheng Yanmo\u2019s lead.\n Uncle Zhang snorted and didn\u2019t say anything else.\n After confirming that no one was causing trouble, Cheng Yanmo was satisfied. He said to his subordinate, \u201cCall the funeral parlor over!\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s body was sent to the mortuary that very night and cremated at dawn. In the morning, Cheng Yanmo carried Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s ashes back to the Cheng Family residence for the funeral.\n Cheng Yanmo had been using work to numb himself recently. In addition, he had not slept at all the night before and was very fatigued. He even walked rather unsteadily.\n He went back to his room to sleep for two hours. When he woke up, Cheng Yanmo took a shower and felt much better. He changed into a black coat and arrived at Cheng Ziang\u2019s villa. He realized that Cheng Ziang was not at home.\n He stayed up all night again?\n Cheng Yanmo found the butler with a dark expression and asked him where Cheng Ziang went. \u201cDid he not come back last night?\u201d\n The butler nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d Staring at the white lantern hanging by the door, the butler sighed and said, \u201cSecond Young Master probably didn\u2019t want to attend Old Master\u2019s funeral and hid away.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo frowned. Walking under the hot sun, he took out his cell phone and called Cheng Ziang.\n The call went through for the first time, but no one picked up. Cheng Yanmo patiently dialed again. This time, the call was finally answered, but it was not Cheng Ziang.\n \u201cHi.\u201d It was a clear girl\u2019s voice.\n Stunned, Cheng Yanmo asked, \u201cWhere is Cheng Ziang?\u201d He thought this girl was Cheng Ziang\u2019s bedmate from last night and told her, \u201cPlease pass the phone to Cheng Ziang. I am his elder brother.\u201d\n The other party said, \u201cHello, Mr. Cheng. This is Wangdong City\u2019s Second People\u2019s Hospital. Your brother was hospitalized yesterday night and is still unconscious. Is it convenient for you to come over and pay his medical fees now?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was shocked. \u201cHow did he get injured?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Anyway, when he was sent to the hospital, there were many injuries to his soft tissues. Moreover...\u201d The other party was silent for two seconds before telling Cheng Yanmo a nightmare.\u201d Your brother will probably be impotent in the future. \u201d\n Cheng Yanmo widened his eyes.\n How can this be?\n Without even taking a bite of food, Cheng Yanmo rushed to the hospital.\n By the time he arrived, Cheng Ziang was already awake.\n Cheng Ziang could already feel the helplessness and abnormality beneath him. He asked the doctor and he was told the real reason. Knowing that he could never touch a woman again in this life, Cheng Ziang flew into a rage.\n When Cheng Yanmo arrived at the ward, it was a mess. There were bedsheets, cups, and all sorts of receipts scattered all over the floor. Meanwhile, Cheng Ziang, the instigator, was sitting on the bed, holding his forehead, unmoving.\n The skin on Cheng Ziang\u2019s head had been smashed by a wine bottle and the wound was very long. The nurse had shaved off all his hair the night before when they arrived at the hospital. Currently, Cheng Ziang\u2019s head was wrapped in white gauze and looked like a dumpling.\n Standing at the door, Cheng Yanmo looked at Cheng Ziang\u2019s bruised and battered appearance in a daze. In his previous life, Cheng Ziang had been harmed by someone during this period.\n Recently, he had been very busy and Mu Qiu\u2019s incident had somewhat affected his mood. He had actually forgotten about this.\n Cheng Yanmo was slightly frustrated. He couldn\u2019t help feeling regretful. He thought to himself that if he cared more about his younger brother and kept a close watch on him so that he wouldn\u2019t commit such atrocities, his younger brother would not have ended up in such a state.\n \u201cZiang.\u201d\n Hearing Cheng Yanmo\u2019s voice, Cheng Ziang froze.\n Cheng Ziang slowly looked up, revealing a pair of bloodshot eyes filled with pain, despair, and unwillingness. Looking at his elder brother standing under the door frame, Cheng Ziang\u2019s despair and anger turned into grievance.\n \u201cBrother...\u201d Cheng Ziang started to cry.\n Cheng Yanmo hurried over and placed his hand gently on Cheng Ziang\u2019s head. His heart ached at the thought of the wound under the gauze. He comforted Cheng Ziang softly. \u201cZiang, it\u2019s Brother. Brother is here.\u201d\n \u201cBrother...\u201d Cheng Ziang grabbed Cheng Yanmo\u2019s hand and said angrily,\u201d Brother, I want to kill that woman. I want to kill her! \u201d\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t agree to Cheng Ziang\u2019s request rashly. Some casual promises might be used against him.\n Cheng Ziang\u2019s expression was ferocious. He said to Cheng Yanmo, \u201cThat woman purposely set me up. She pretended to be drunk and hit me when I wasn\u2019t looking. Brother, you must avenge me. She caused my death! My entire life is ruined because of her!\u201d\n \u201cBrother, I have become a cripple!\u201d\n Cheng Ziang started sobbing maniacally.\n As Cheng Yanmo listened to his brother\u2019s sobs, images of what he had seen in that dream surfaced in his mind.\n In his previous life, Cheng Ziang had also been beaten up badly. At that time, Cheng Yanmo also wanted to seek justice for Cheng Ziang, but that girl had a very powerful background and was not someone the Cheng Family could afford to offend.\n In the end, the Cheng Family could only suffer in silence.\n After losing his manhood, Cheng Ziang became more and more ruthless. At home, he would beat up Song Ci whenever he was unhappy. Outside, he would seduce any girl he liked. If he failed, he would resort to despicable means.\n The inhumane him could always come up with all sorts of tricks to vent his anger on women.\n Not only that, he was also addicted to browsing perverted websites to enjoy videos of special crimes. Gradually, he became dissatisfied with this and boldly collaborated with others to create a private website that specialized in using minors for profit.\n After Song Ci discovered Cheng Ziang\u2019s actions, she reported all of them and sent them to prison.\n The year Cheng Yanmo died, Cheng Ziang was still serving his sentence in prison.\n As for what would happen to Cheng Ziang in the future, Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t even need to think to know. Because Mu Qiu had hurt Song Ci, that crazy Han Zhan even wanted to kill him, who was Mu Qiu\u2019s husband. What about Cheng Ziang, who had trampled on Song Ci for six years?\n In this life, Cheng Yanmo would never stand by and watch his brother continue to make mistakes!\n Cheng Yanmo patted Cheng Ziang\u2019s shoulder and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that girl\u2019s name?\u201d\n Cheng Ziang said, \u201cHan Wangwang.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo sighed and closed his eyes.\n It is indeed her!\n Han Wangwang was born into a military and political family. His father, Han Wanglong, was the top politician in Shunchen City. His grandfather, Han Dongliang, had an even higher status. Cheng Ziang had fallen to this woman in his previous life and this life. It was his own fault.\n \u201cZiang, we cannot afford to offend this person.\u201d\n Hearing this, Cheng Ziang was stunned. There was someone we couldn\u2019t afford to offend?\n Cheng Ziang recalled Han Wangwang\u2019s parting words last night and asked Cheng Yanmo, \u201cIsn\u2019t she just a girl from an ordinary family? Could she have some other background?\u201d\n Nodding, Cheng Yanmo spoke their names softly. \u201cHan Wanglong and Han Dongliang. One is Han Wangwang\u2019s father, while the other is Han Wangwang\u2019s grandfather.\u201d\n Firstly, Cheng Ziang didn\u2019t pay attention to politics, secondly, he didn\u2019t pay attention to military affairs, so he didn\u2019t know who these two people were. But hearing the name Han Wanglong sounded familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere before.\n Cheng Ziang took out his cell phone and checked the identities of Han Wanglong and Han Dongliang. After reading the information, Cheng Ziang finally knew who he had offended.\n Han Wangwang was indeed a pampered little princess.\n At this point, Cheng Ziang suddenly felt very fortunate. He was glad that he didn\u2019t really touch her. If he did, the entire Cheng Family and Chuan Dong Group would probably suffer from their revenge!\n But Cheng Ziang wasn\u2019t willing to let himself suffer in silence for the rest of his life. \u201cThen should I just endure it? To be bullied for nothing?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo knew what Cheng Ziang was thinking. He told him, \u201cI will arrange for you to go overseas to meet the best male doctor. The chances of you being cured are very high.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang saw hope. \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s true. There is a male doctor in the Netherlands who is very good at this. I will get someone to bring you to him.\u201d Cheng Yanmo hoped that the doctor could treat his brother\u2019s health. He hoped that the physically and mentally healthy Cheng Ziang would not make the same mistake again.\n Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t expect Cheng Ziang to become an outstanding person. He could just be a playboy who only knew how to enjoy life, as long as he didn\u2019t commit any crimes and didn\u2019t dig his own grave.\n Cheng Ziang knew that his brother would not lie to him. Hearing that, the malicious intent in his eyes dimmed. \u201cBrother, if it can really be cured...\u201d Cheng Ziang thought for a moment and said,\u201d I must turn over a new leaf in the future! \u201d\n Last night, he had sat alone on the carpet of the hotel, bleeding profusely but unable to get any help. Cheng Ziang regretted it slightly.\n He recalled his ridiculous first half of his life and felt rather despondent.\n Cheng Ziang couldn\u2019t help thinking of his elementary school days. At that time, he was also a smart kid who won the Best Student Award. One summer, he even jumped into a pond to save a classmate who nearly drowned and was praised by the principal in front of everyone.\n But since his mother\u2019s death...\n Cheng Ziang knew very well that he was ill because of his own heart. His mother\u2019s death was a thorn in his heart. He knew that he should release Cheng Zhanxiong and himself so that he could lead a more successful life.\n But he just couldn\u2019t let it go!\n At this point, being comforted in his brother\u2019s arms, Cheng Ziang\u2019s gradually cold heart finally felt a tinge of warmth. \u201cBrother, are you disappointed in me?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo said, \u201cDisappointed.\u201d\n Cheng Ziang\u2019s smile was slightly bitter. But his brother said, \u201cBut I still have hope for you.\u201d\n Hearing this, Cheng Ziang\u2019s eyes lit up. He suddenly felt that life was not as bad as before.\n \u2013\n Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s funeral was scheduled for the morning of December 28th.\n Cheng Zhanxiong was a beneficial entrepreneur. His death had also caused a wave of mourning on Weibo. Now that he was dead, the dirty deeds from his previous life were no longer important.\n Han Aoyu and the Cheng Family had a pretty good relationship. After Cheng Zhanxiong died, Han Aoyu also went to the Cheng Family\u2019s funeral to sit for a while.\n There were quite a number of people from the Cheng Family today. They were all youngsters and middle-aged men. Han Aoyu didn\u2019t have any old friends that he was familiar with. He felt it was pointless and just sat there for a while before greeting them and leaving.\n He returned home and saw a black Volvo parked in the yard.\n Knowing that it was Han Zhan and his wife who had come, Han Aoyu shouted as he walked in. \u201cLass Song, I will make potato cakes tonight. Do you want some?\u201d Knowing that Lass Song was a glutton, Han Aoyu always tried to make delicious food for her.\n Song Ci, who was taking small bites of grapefruit, couldn\u2019t help massaging her own stomach upon hearing her grandfather\u2019s shout. Every time she came to her grandfather\u2019s place for a meal, she would have to go home to eat digestive pills and exercise crazily to reduce her appetite.\n Song Ci ran out of the house with a grapefruit. She smiled sweetly and praised Han Aoyu when she saw her grandfather in high spirits. \u201cGrandpa is so handsome today. This Chinese tunic suit suits you very well! It makes you look strong and strong. You have a hidden aura!\u201d\n Han Aoyu knew that Song Ci was someone who could boast with her eyes closed, but he still liked Song Ci\u2019s sweet mouth. Compared to Han Zhan, who couldn\u2019t utter a single pleasant word no matter how hard he tried, Song Ci was much cuter.\n \u201cYou are so glib-tongued. I will make you another plate of marinated beef!\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci instinctively shut up.\n Han Zhan suddenly snorted.\n Han Aoyu harrumphed at Han Zhan, before entering the house to look for potatoes. He was going to fry them and make them into potato cakes. Han Zhan carried the watering can and watered that Luohan Pine. Seeing Song Ci\u2019s depressed expression, he couldn\u2019t help but tease her. \u201cWho told you to have such a sweet mouth? You can eat until you were full?\u201d\n Song Ci walked up to Han Zhan and stood beside him, her fingers pinching the pin leaves of the arhat pine. She suddenly said, \u201cI am going to attend the auditions for \u2018Le Chi\u2019 next week. If I get chosen, I might go to Europe to film with the production team.\u201d\n Han Zhan was shocked. \u201cYou are going to Europe? How long will it take?\u201d\n =Song Ci said, \u201cProbably a month.\u201d\n Han Zhan remained silent.\n It had been a few months since they got married and Han Zhan had gone for a few business trips. However, as it hadn\u2019t been long, he didn\u2019t feel too reluctant. Thinking that Song Ci might leave him for a month, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help feeling reluctant.\n \u201cBrother Han can\u2019t bear for me to leave?\u201d Song Ci tiptoed and bumped into Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder. She tilted her head and said to him, \u201cBrother Han, please act coquettishly. I won\u2019t go if you do.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t believe Song Ci\u2019s lies at all.\n You\u2019re lying to me.\u201d Han Zhan knew Song Ci better. \u201cYou told me this not to discuss with me or to listen to my suggestion. You\u2019re just informing me of your decision. How can I stop you from doing whatever you decide to do? Moreover...\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled and said, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to stop you either.\u201d She wanted to chase after her dreams and he couldn\u2019t stop her footsteps and tie up her wings.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart warmed. \u201cI knew Brother Han would understand me.\u201d\n There was a reason why Shen Yubei wanted her to act in this movie. \u201cLe Chi\u201d was indeed going to be a hit. All the minor roles in this movie would become major stars in the future. If Song Ci could get a role, she would definitely become famous globally. Three years later, she would have more confidence and capital to participate in Empress Elizabeth\u2019s international music competition.\n The violin was a dream that Song Ci couldn\u2019t fulfill in her previous life. In this life, Song Ci wanted to be the real Song Ci!\n \u201cBaby Ci, you must get this role. When the movie premieres, I will book the entire theater every day.\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Han Aoyu fiddled in the kitchen for two hours and made a table full of dishes. It was hard to refuse such a grand offer. Song Ci ate two bowls of rice and a lot of dishes. She only put down her bowl when she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n Han Aoyu asked Song Ci, \u201cHas Grandpa\u2019s culinary skills improved?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cIt seems to have improved slightly.\u201d\n \u201cLiar.\u201d Han Aoyu put down his chopsticks. Hearing the mournful music coming from the bottom of the hill, he recalled something and said to Han Zhan, \u201cYesterday, that lad Cheng Yanmo brought the geomancer to the top of the hill to pick a grave. When he passed by my house, he said something to me.\u201d\n Han Zhan ate without looking up.\n \u201cSay what?\u201d Song Ci asked.\n Han Aoyu relayed Cheng Yanmo\u2019s words to Han Zhan word for word. \u201cThat lad said: my brother has been taught a lesson for being rash and foolish. I will send him overseas to be remodeled and won\u2019t let him commit any more heinous crimes. I hope Mr. Han will be magnanimous and not lower yourself to his level.\u201d\n After repeating Cheng Yanmo\u2019s words, Han Aoyu narrowed his eyes and sized Han Zhan up. \u201cDid you bully his younger brother?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t deny nor admit to it.\n It looked like Cheng Yanmo had already investigated the Han Family thoroughly and even found out the relationship between him and Han Wangwang.\n Seeing that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t willing to talk about this matter, Han Aoyu didn\u2019t probe any further. Han Zhan was an adult in his thirties, and Han Aoyu had to learn to let go of him and stop asking about his juniors.\n \u201cI am old and can\u2019t sit for too long after eating. I am going out for a walk. When you guys return later, bring that roasted duck from the kitchen. Warm it up in the microwave tomorrow and it will be edible.\u201d This was said to Song Ci.\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cAlright, thank you, Grandpa.\u201d Song Ci got up and cleaned up the dishes with Han Zhan. After entering the kitchen, Song Ci pulled Han Zhan\u2019s arm and asked him, \u201cYou were the one who beat up Cheng Ziang?\u201d\n Han Zhan gazed at the greasy plate and remained silent, as if he had gone deaf.\n Song Ci thought it was funny. \u201cIf you did it, so be it. Stop pretending.\u201d\n Han Zhan admitted, \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cWhy did you do that? He didn\u2019t offend you!\u201d\n \u201cBecause he hurt you, and he even...\u201d He even married you. Han Zhan refused to admit that he was a petty, jealous, and possessive person. He also didn\u2019t want Song Ci to know his true colors, so he didn\u2019t finish his sentence.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart warmed. \u201cThank you, Brother Han. But from now on, don\u2019t do such things anymore. After all, it\u2019s not a legitimate method.\u201d\n Brother Han was such an upright and patriotic young man, but he had even started scheming against others because of her.\n She had tarnished the upright Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t bully anyone in the future.\u201d After thinking for a moment, he added. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n \u2013\n After Cheng Zhanxiong\u2019s funeral, Cheng Yanmo officially appeared as the chairman and executive chairman of Chuan Dong Group at an international major business meeting. Along with him was Li Li, who had recently been promoted to vice-president of Zeus International.\n Li Li and Cheng Yanmo met at the banquet after the meeting.\n The two of them met and Cheng Yanmo took the initiative to raise his glass to Li Li. \u201cCongratulations on your promotion, CEO Li.\u201d Cheng Yanmo truly admired Li Li, who was only a year older than him and had climbed to his current position with his own capabilities.\n Li Li smiled and gave his original words to Cheng Yanmo. \u201cCongratulations to Mr. Cheng for officially becoming CEO Cheng.\u201d\n The two of them smiled at each other.\n Li Li recalled the scene he saw at the hotel that night. He looked around and waited for no one to notice before asking Cheng Yanmo in a low voice, \u201cCEO Cheng, how is your brother\u2019s recovery?\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo heard from Cheng Ziang that on the night he was beaten up, Li Li and Han Zhan had also appeared at the scene.\n Knowing that Han Zhan must have something to do with Cheng Ziang being beaten up, and that Li Li had a close relationship with Han Zhan, Cheng Yanmo hid the truth and said, \u201cHis health is fine now, but I am planning to send him overseas to further his studies. It won\u2019t be good for him to continue wasting his time here.\u201d\n Knowing that \u201cadvanced studies\u201d was just a euphemistic way of putting it, Li Li praised Cheng Yanmo\u2019s actions. \u201cIt\u2019s time to study hard. He can\u2019t always turn misfortune into good luck.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n The two of them were outstanding youths and were quickly called away to socialize. Cheng Yanmo had drunk some wine and was slightly tipsy. He sat down on the sofa to take a nap. Not far away, a few business tycoons were smoking and chatting about the recent changes in Wangdong City.\n As they chatted, they inevitably started talking about the Mu Family. In the past, Mu Mian would never miss such a place. But now that he was no longer around, everyone sighed.\n Even now, those old friends who were on good terms with Mu Mian still couldn\u2019t believe that he was a murderer. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t tell that Mu Mian was such a person.\u201d\n \u201cI guess you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d\n \u201cSigh, the truly pitiful one is still Madam Mu.\u201d Madam Mu was a beautiful, elegant, and kind-hearted woman. The news of her sudden cerebral hemorrhage and death spread like wildfire and many people felt it was a great pity.\n One of the middle-aged men shook his head and sighed. \u201cI still remember that when Madam Mu was young, she was a top-class beauty in Wangdong City. To be honest, I once had a crush on her. But she didn\u2019t have a good taste and didn\u2019t like me. She liked Mu Mian.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one. That CEO of the Zhu Corporation is still obsessed with Madam Mu. He is the one who is deeply in love.\u201d Old CEO Zhu loved Du Tingting deeply and remained single all his life.\n In that case, Mu Mian was indeed so fortunate that it made one jealous.\n \u201cThe world is unpredictable!\u201d\n [fuzzy]Life was unpredictable and unknown. You never knew what would happen the next moment.\n Cheng Yanmo listened listlessly to their discussion about the Mu Family. He got up and was about to leave when he suddenly heard someone say, \u201cThat daughter of the Mu Family is called Mu Qiu, right?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. Her nickname is Qiu-er.\u201d\n \u201cOh, yes. I heard that Qiu-er has become a nun. A few days ago, the Dongfang Family\u2019s Madam brought the Young Mistress to Magpie Mountain to pray for blessings. She saw a young female nun who looked quite like Qiu-er from the Mu Family.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d Everyone was shocked. The youngest daughter of the Mu Family had become a monk?  Many of the uncles who had seen Mu Qiu felt that it was a pity. \u201cThat girl is not bad. She is lovely and kind. Our son wanted to marry her in the past. It would be a pity if she really became a monk...\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo listened in a daze, finding it absurd.\n Mu Qiu had become a nun?\n How could...\n A string in Cheng Yanmo\u2019s heart snapped.\n Now that she had become a nun, she had heartlessly severed all ties with him and their marriage. He was the one who had initiated the breakup, but now, his chest felt slightly stuffy and heavy.\n \u2013\n It was drizzling and snowing lightly.\n Holding an umbrella, the man climbed up the mountainside and stood in the square, looking up at the temple in front of him.\n The words \u201cMoonlight Nunnery\u201d were simple and formal.\n Only when the rain had drenched the tips of Cheng Yanmo\u2019s sneakers did he lift his leg and step into the small puddle on the cement floor. The temple was quiet and elegant, slow and peaceful, but it also made one feel at peace.\n Cheng Yanmo offered some incense and gave a sum of money for the incense burner. He went alone to the canteen. The rain had already ended and a female disciple dressed in a grey monk robe came to the courtyard with a broom to sweep away the fallen leaves and water.\n The female disciple\u2019s back view was tall and slender. She didn\u2019t appear vulgar even when sweeping the floor with a broom. She was wearing a cloth hat that revealed the clean back of her head, without a single strand of hair. Cheng Yanmo stared at that person\u2019s back view, his eyes fixed on it, and even his breathing became shallow.\n Carefully, Cheng Yanmo asked, \u201cXiao Qiu?\u201d\n ]The female disciple stopped sweeping.\n She turned slowly, holding a broom in her hand. Her dark eyes were clear and unprecedentedly clean. Cheng Yanmo stared at Mu Qiu\u2019s face, slightly agitated.\n \u201cXiao Qiu, it\u2019s really you!\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo hurried over to Mu Qiu. When he was just one meter away from her, Mu Qiu suddenly clasped her hands together and said in a clear voice, \u201cBenefactor, please stop.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo stopped in his tracks.\n He looked at Mu Qiu in shock, feeling very upset.\n Mu Qiu gazed at Cheng Yanmo calmly. There was no love or reluctance in her eyes. \u201cBenefactor, my name is Forgetting Dust.\u201d Noticing the shock in Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes, Mu Qiu added, \u201cI have already put aside the past. Benefactor, please put down the past as soon as possible and start a new life as soon as possible.\u201d\n With that, Mu Qiu turned and continued sweeping the floor.\n Cheng Yanmo just stood behind Mu Qiu. Even after Mu Qiu had swept the floor and left with her broom, she didn\u2019t look back at him.\n That day, Cheng Yanmo spent the entire day at the Moonlight Nunnery. He ate vegetarian meals and read scriptures. He did everything that Mu Qiu did. When he left, his eyes were bloodshot.\n Five days later, a piece of good news hit the headlines of all major newspapers in Wangdong City.\n Happy news! Chuan Dong Group\u2019s CEO Cheng Yanmo and the Southern Su Family\u2019s daughter, Su Qing, announced their relationship. The wedding will be held on the 28th of next month!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "197": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-198\n\n Chapter 197: Han Zhan, Long Time No See  This incident quickly went viral on her social media. Song Ci was momentarily stunned by the news.\n In this life, Cheng Yanmo and Mu Qiu\u2019s ending had changed.\n That day, the director of \u201cLe Chi\u201d, Du Junfei, arrived at Wangdong City with a low-profile team. Shen Yubei and Du Junfei were good friends and he stayed over at Shen Yubei\u2019s house that night.\n Once Du Junfei arrived, Shen Yubei called Song Ci.\n \u201cThe auditions will start tomorrow. The auditions will be held for two days on the 5th floor of the Jetta International Hotel. Song Ci, don\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d Teacher Shen explained the time and location to her in one sentence, and then hung up without giving Song Ci a chance to catch her breath.\n Song Ci really wanted to ask Teacher Shen: What if I am not chosen by Du Junfei?\n I would probably get beaten up!\n Song Ci opened all the closets in the cloakroom. She wanted to pick a beautiful dress for herself so that she could get bonus points for tomorrow\u2019s pre-selection. She had more red dresses in her wardrobe. Song Ci took out a red halter dress and changed into it. She stood in front of the mirror and twirled in circles as she mesmerized herself.\n At this moment, her cell phone rang again.\n It was still Shen Yubei. Song Ci answered the call with a frown. \u201cTeacher.\u201d\n \u201cI forgot to tell you not to wear red dresses.\u201d After a pause, Shen Yubei added, \u201cEspecially those that are very sexy.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Song Ci looked at the beautiful girl in the mirror and her heart nearly broke. He isn\u2019t allowing me to wear a beautiful red dress. How can he be so domineering?\n Shen Yubei smirked but didn\u2019t explain and he just said, \u201cI won\u2019t harm you.\u201d\n \u201cAlright.\u201d\n Song Ci was very nervous about tomorrow\u2019s auditions. She loved to do housework whenever she was nervous. Her family hired a part-time cleaner who would come to clean regularly every day, so Song Ci could only wipe the kitchen again with a cloth and had nothing else to do.\n She went back into the cloakroom, tidied up and hung up all the clothes.\n Realizing that her clothes were more than three times that of Han Zhan\u2019s, Song Ci instantly felt that she had been too harsh on her Brother Han and decided to buy some clothes for him.\n \u2013\n Every year, Han Zhan would spend three days at a nursing home to visit retired military personnel. Most of these elderly people had no children and lived in poverty and had no one to rely on in their later years. After this incident was exposed by the media and urged by the citizens, the country built a nursing home for them.\n There were already more than 200 such nursing homes in the country and more would be built in the future. Under Han Zhan\u2019s instructions, Sheng Hui Technology and the government came to an agreement and they would donate 80 smart televisions and 180 smart phones to each nursing home.\n Han Zhan firmly believed that only by continuously giving benefits to society would he gain more benefits.\n It was a gloomy day and the cold wind felt like a knife cutting into one\u2019s face. Han Zhan was wearing a thick military coat as he and Long Yu carried the boxes of donations out of the van.\n The director was a woman in her fifties. She was especially happy to see those boxes of supplies and smiled so widely that her eyes narrowed. \u201cBig guys, have a drink?\u201d The director personally made two glasses of brown sugar water and handed them to Han Zhan and Long Yu.\n Other than toffee, Han Zhan seldom drank sweet things. But he still accepted the warm brown sugar tea and finished it in one gulp.\n The director thought that Han Zhan and Long Yu were just porters sent over by Zeus Corporation. She stood beside the car and muttered to Han Zhan. \u201cSigh, there are so many good people in this world. Of all the companies in Wangdong City, only your company is sincere in doing good deeds. Every time you come, you always keep silent and just leave after giving something. Unlike other companies who bring reporters with them when they come, and they would only come for one year.\u201d\n Han Zhan said in a low voice, \u201cA day of good deeds is also good.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n Han Zhan saw the big gold chain around the director\u2019s neck. He didn\u2019t say anything but secretly committed this incident to memory. After moving everything, the two of them entered the nursing home to chat with a few familiar elderly people.\n In the living room, the television was playing the movie \u201cThe Twelve Beauties of Jinling\u201d. An old man with age spots on his face was holding Han Zhan\u2019s left hand. Seeing a wedding ring on his finger, he was momentarily stunned, then looked up in surprise and asked Han Zhan, \u201cLittle Han, you\u2019re married?\u201d\n Upon hearing this, the other elderly ladies who knew Han Zhan all gathered over and stared at Han Zhan\u2019s wedding ring with surprise and curiosity. \u201cThis is a wedding ring, right? Is it real?\u201d\n A faint smile appeared on Han Zhan\u2019s normally steady face. \u201cYes, I am married. This wedding ring is also real.\u201d\n Han Zhan took out his cell phone and found Song Ci\u2019s daily photo. With the mindset of showing off, he showed Song Ci\u2019s photo to the elderly. \u201cLook, this is my lover.\u201d\n Everyone looked at the phone and saw that the lady was very beautiful. They all suspected that Han Zhan was just boasting. \u201cNo way, Little Han. How can she be your wife? She is obviously a big star, the type that is popular on television.\u201d\n They didn\u2019t know any top debutante, but they knew that Song Ci was very pretty and felt that such a pretty lady must be a big star.\n Han Zhan felt very helpless and said again, \u201cThis is really my wife.\u201d\n Everyone looked at Han Zhan with different expressions.\n Han Zhan was wearing a dust-stained military coat. He didn\u2019t look regal at all and looked rather simple and honest. They admitted that Han Zhan was a pretty decent lad, but not outstanding enough to marry a big star.\n Long Yu was sitting beside Han Zhan. He couldn\u2019t help laughing at the way the old masters looked at Han Zhan.\n At this moment, Song Ci gave Han Zhan a video call. Han Zhan raised his brows and said to the group of old men, \u201cGrandpa, look, my wife is video-calling me.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly smug as he accepted the video.\n A lovely and beautiful face appeared on Han Zhan\u2019s screen. It was the same face as the lady he had just shared with everyone. The men were all shocked. \u201cOh my, she is really Little Han\u2019s wife!\u201d\n \u201cLittle Han, your wife is so beautiful!\u201d\n When Song Ci heard the chattering on Han Zhan\u2019s side, she calmed down to listen carefully. After hearing what those old men were saying, Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cHello, grandfathers. I am really Brother Han\u2019s wife!\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s greeting melted everyone\u2019s hearts.\n \u201cLittle Han, your wife is so sweet-tongued!\u201d\n Han Zhan remained silent, but his face was full of smiles and his eyes were filled with affection.\n Han Zhan noticed that Song Ci wasn\u2019t at home and saw that the scene behind her looked like it was at the mall. He asked Song Ci, \u201cYou\u2019re outside?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, I\u2019m shopping.\u201d Song Ci turned and walked into a men\u2019s clothing shop. She told Han Zhan, \u201cI\u2019m buying clothes for you.\u201d\n \u201cBuying for me?\u201d\n \u201cYes, I dote on you.\u201d\n Han Zhan realized that even he felt embarrassed when the bunch of old men started to wink at him. Han Zhan coughed and said to Song Ci, \u201cDon\u2019t forget yourself just because you\u2019re buying for me. Go ahead first, I\u2019ll go look for you later.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After hanging up the video call, Han Zhan kept his cell phone in his pocket.\n Meeting the old men\u2019s gossipy and curious gazes, Han Zhan said rather proudly, \u201cMy wife is beautiful, kind, and doesn\u2019t have any other hobbies. She just likes to buy some clothes for me and make something delicious.\u201d\n \u201cHow fortunate!\u201d\n \u201cYou are so lucky!\u201d\n Han Zhan only returned with Long Yu, after receiving a bunch of compliments from the old men.\n When they returned, the two of them were still in the van. Long Yu drove while Han Zhan sat in the passenger\u2019s seat. Long Yu told Han Zhan, \u201cI noticed that compared to last year, there are two fewer elders this year. I wonder how many will be left by next year.\u201d\n These veterans were getting fewer and fewer by the year. It was truly heart-wrenching.\n \u201cIt\u2019s very normal for people to die of old age.\u201d That was true, but thinking that his grandfather, who was over 80 years old, might not have many years left to live, Han Zhan felt slightly upset.\n \u201cOh yes, tell Sheng Hui\u2019s Zhang Ze to check on the people at the Finance Department. I suspect that the director of the Finance Department and the nursing home are guilty of embezzlement.\u201d Every year, Sheng Hui Technology would donate a sum of money to the nursing home, usually between 800,000 to 2,000,000 yuan. This sum of money was indeed not a lot, but Han Zhan could not tolerate his subordinates embezzling money.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u2013\n She bought Han Zhan two coats, a down jacket and a sweater. Only then did Song Ci enter a female shoe store. She needed a pair of beautiful flats to match her dress for tomorrow.\n Song Ci was a regular customer of this shop. Once she entered, the receptionist recognized her. \u201cMs. Song, you haven\u2019t been here for a long time. What have you been busy with recently?\u201d\n As she spoke, the salesperson took over the shopping bags from Song Ci and placed them on a sofa. She shot a look at the newly arrived salesperson to have her watch the items.\n Song Ci walked up to a rack and said to the salesperson, \u201cA lot of things have been happening around me recently. I don\u2019t have the time to shop.\u201d\n The incident at the Mu Family caused a huge stir. Everyone knew that Mu Mian nearly killed his adopted daughter Song Ci\u2019s elder sister just to steal her heart and save his own daughter who needed a heart transplant!\n The receptionist asked Song Ci, \u201cHow is your elder sister now?\u201d\n \u201cNot bad.\u201d\n Song Ci took a fancy to a pair of shoes.\n It was a pair of pointy shoes with heart-shaped pearls on them, very suitable for the dress that Song Ci would be wearing tomorrow. Song Ci took off her high-heeled shoes and tried them on. It was winter now and her feet, which had been slightly tanned by the summer sun, had regained their fair skin.\n The silver champagne-colored shoes looked especially classy on her feet.\n Song Ci stood in front of the mirror and took a closer look. The more she looked at it, the more she liked it. \u201cAre these shoes size 37?\u201d\n The salesperson shook her head awkwardly and glanced at the cashier counter. \u201cThe last pair of size 37 shoes has already been bought. If Miss Song wants them, you will have to wait another two days. How about this\u2014I will inform Miss Song to come and get them when the goods arrive? Or I can get someone to deliver them to you?\u201d\n Song Ci also glanced over at the cashier counter. She saw a girl turning her back to her, scanning the QR code for payment.\n A pair of shoes was placed in front of the girl. It was the same design as Song Ci\u2019s.\n The salesperson explained softly to Song Ci, \u201cThat girl seems to be Master Cheng\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Ms. Su. She came earlier than you and happened to have taken a fancy to this pair of shoes in your hand. She has already taken the last pair of size 37 shoes.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help stealing a few more glances at Cheng Yanmo\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Su Qingcheng.\n That girl was very young and was wearing a pale blue coat. Her curly hair was draped over her shoulders and she had a light grey butterfly knot on her head, making her look very gentle. The girl finished scanning the QR code and paid the bill. Holding the shoe box, she turned and saw Song Ci.\n She recognized Song Ci.\n Song Ci, Wangdong City\u2019s top debutante, had already spread throughout the entire country. Even in Su City in the south, Su Qingcheng had heard of her.\n Before coming to Wangdong City this time, she had specially memorized all the information regarding those wealthy heiresses. She had a deep impression of the gorgeous Song Ci.\n She didn\u2019t expect to meet the legendary top beauty Song Ci on the second day of her visit to Wangdong City. Su Qingcheng was both surprised and happy. \u201cAre you Song Ci?\u201d\n \u201cI am Song Ci and you are Miss Su?\u201d Song Ci approached Su Qingcheng. She stared at the girl\u2019s face and suddenly felt a strange feeling.\n This Su Qingcheng was indeed very beautiful. Her face was only the size of an adult\u2019s palm, and her black eyes were pure and pristine, as clear as spring water. She was beautiful, but she gave Song Ci a sense of familiarity.\n Song Ci understood why Su Qingcheng gave her a familiar feeling. It was because Su Qingcheng\u2019s charm was too similar to Mu Qiu\u2019s. Song Ci was very familiar with Mu Qiu. Others might not be able to tell, but Song Ci could tell at a glance.\n Song Ci felt somewhat sorry for Su Qingcheng. Did she know that she was just the shadow of another woman?\n Su Qingcheng stared at the shoes in Song Ci\u2019s hands and looked slightly shocked. \u201cYou also have your eyes on this pair of shoes, Ms. Song?\u201d Su Qingcheng lifted her shoe box and smiled. \u201cWhat a coincidence, we chose the same pair.\u201d\n Song Ci handed the shoes to the salesperson behind her and said to Su Qingcheng, \u201cIt\u2019s quite a coincidence, but I\u2019m not buying this pair of shoes.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Su Qingcheng stared at Song Ci\u2019s feet. \u201cMiss Song\u2019s feet will look very good in this pair of shoes. Don\u2019t you like it?\u201d Or could it be that Song Ci didn\u2019t like to have the same shoes as others?\n Song Ci smiled and told Su Qingcheng, \u201cYes, but you\u2019ve already picked the last pair of size 37 shoes. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s fate?\u201d\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d Su Qingcheng looked up at the dresser behind Song Ci and asked, \u201cIs this the only pair of size 37?\u201d\n The salesperson nodded and explained. \u201cThe other stocks will be arriving only the day after tomorrow. Ms. Song, why don\u2019t you look at the other models?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Shoes are not men. It isn\u2019t a must to have that particular design.\n Song Ci turned around and was about to choose another pair of shoes when Su Qingcheng suddenly called out to her. \u201cMs. Song, I have many designs that are similar to this pair of shoes. Why don\u2019t I give this pair to you?\u201d\n Worried that Song Ci wouldn\u2019t accept it, Su Qingcheng added. \u201cThe reason why I want to buy this pair of shoes is because I like to collect high heels. Actually, I won\u2019t wear many of the shoes even if I buy them back. If you really like them, I\u2019ll just give them to you. Let\u2019s just treat it as making friends?\u201d\n Su Qingcheng told Song Ci, \u201cI am new here and don\u2019t have any friends. Ms. Song, let\u2019s be friends, okay?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t detest Su Qingcheng. This girl was not shy or pretentious, and it was quite comfortable to talk to her. Su Qingcheng was going to be the lady of Chuan Dong Group, and Song Ci was happy to befriend her.\n \u201cThen I will have to thank Miss Su for your kindness.\u201d Song Ci told Su Qingcheng. \u201cTo be honest, I am going to attend an audition tomorrow and bought these shoes to match my dress. Miss Su, thank you very much.\u201d\n \u201cIn that case, you will need it even more.\u201d Su Qingcheng added Song Ci on WeChat and Song Ci transferred the money to her.\n Song Ci and Su Qingcheng found a cafe and sat down to have a chat. Coming from the south, Su Qingcheng had a gentle aura and her voice was gentle like a quiet stream, melodious and moving.\n Song Ci was an energetic person, but she didn\u2019t even dare to speak loudly to Su Qingcheng for fear of scaring her.\n Su Qingcheng told Song Ci, \u201cTo be honest, Miss Song, you are very famous in Su City. Many socialites and influencers love to learn from you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve tried to learn from you too.\u201d Su Qingcheng didn\u2019t lie. She had indeed tried Song Ci\u2019s fashion. \u201cLast year, you shared a set of clothes on Weibo. It was a red shirt paired with black jeans and you even had curly hair. I thought you looked great wearing it and specially went to the mall to buy the same design.\u201d\n Su Qingcheng smiled and said sheepishly, \u201cHow should I put it? Me wearing the same kind of clothes as you\u2014it\u2019s like a junior high school student stealing an elder sister\u2019s clothes. Ms. Song has a voluptuous figure, while I\u2019 m skinny\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have blindly imitated you.\u201d\n Su Qingcheng was very honest, and dared to mock and praise herself. Song Ci liked her very much.\n The two of them chatted for a long time until Han Zhan called. Song Ci smiled apologetically at Su Qingcheng. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to take this call.\u201d Song Ci picked up the phone and heard Han Zhan say, \u201cI\u2019m on the third floor, where are you?\u201d\n Song Ci pulled open the dark green curtains and looked outside. She easily recognized Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, I\u2019m at the cafe!\u201d Han Zhan, who was in the corridor opposite, heard this and looked over at the cafe.\n He had good eyesight and immediately saw Song Ci peeping at him through the window. Han Zhan waved at her. \u201cI see you.\u201d\n Song Ci also waved at him and said into her cell phone, \u201cBrother Han, come and find me.\u201d\n Su Qingcheng knew that it was Song Ci\u2019s husband calling. Seeing Song Ci waving at someone outside, Su Qingcheng also tilted her head to look out the window. There were many people walking along the corridor of the shopping mall, but only one person was waving at Song Ci \u2014\n It was a tall man in a military coat which was stained with some soot...\n Su Qingcheng held her breath.\n It was said that Song Ci married a man from an ordinary family, but isn\u2019t this too ordinary?!\n Su Qingcheng looked at Song Ci with eyes full of admiration. It was indeed Song Ci. She was so self-centered and had a unique taste for choosing a husband.\n Song Ci hung up and turned back. She saw the shock in Su Qingcheng\u2019s eyes and knew what she was thinking. She told her, \u201cThat\u2019s my husband. He went to the nursing home to deliver some goods today.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d But Su Qingcheng was thinking: Although Miss Song\u2019s husband is slightly ordinary, he has a kind heart. It seems like Miss Song loves her husband deeply.\n Han Zhan arrived very quickly. He didn\u2019t enter the cafe but stood along the corridor and knocked on the glass window.\n Song Ci stood up and bid farewell to Su Qingcheng. \u201cMy husband is here, so I\u2019ll get going first. Ms. Su, let\u2019s chat again next time.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci carried large and small bags out. Han Zhan helped her carry everything naturally. \u201cIs that your friend?\u201d Song Ci had too many friends. They had already been married for half a year and Han Zhan still couldn\u2019t recognize all her friends.\n Song Ci shook her head and said mysteriously, \u201cShe is a friend I just met today. Guess who she is. Her identity will definitely shock you.\u201d\n Han Zhan had just casually glanced at Su Qingcheng and didn\u2019t look closely. Hearing this, he thought for a moment and said somewhat uncertainly, \u201cCould it be Su Qingcheng?\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. \u201cHow did you know!\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cOver the past few days, Su Qingcheng has been mentioned the most frequently by everyone, so the woman whom you mentioned to me in such a mysterious tone is most likely her.\u201d\n \u201cAm I right?\u201d\n Song Ci truly admired Han Zhan\u2019s intelligence and couldn\u2019t help giving him a big thumbs-up. \u201cAmazing, you guessed correctly. It\u2019s Su Qingcheng.\u201d\n \u201cThe Su Family is a big shot corporation in the South. Their household appliances are famous all over the world. Cheng Yanmo married Su Qingcheng. It can be considered a strong collaboration.\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be friends with her, but don\u2019t be too close to her.\u201d\n \u201cI understand.\u201d Su Qingcheng looked obedient and pure, but Song Ci couldn\u2019t tell if her heart was black or red. In her previous life, she didn\u2019t know that Mu Mian had a black heart until her death. As a result, Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to believe the seemingly kind and gentle Su Qingcheng.\n \u201cMmm, I\u2019m just reminding you.\u201d\n Han Zhan realized that many people were looking at him. He frowned and asked Song Ci, \u201cAm I embarrassing you by wearing this?\u201d He looked at the reflection of his boorish self in the cupboard and the exquisitely beautiful Song Ci, and suddenly thought of a combination \u2014\n Beauty and the beast.\n Han Zhan glanced at the clothing bag in his hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to the toilet.\u201d\n Han Zhan entered the men\u2019s washroom, took off his military jacket, and put on the new clothes that Song Ci had bought for him. Song Ci had bought Han Zhan a dark grey long windbreaker that covered his knees.\n He was tall and his perfectly tailored windbreaker exuded an aura of 2.8 meters.\n When he came out, he looked like a completely different person. Instantly, he looked tall and regal.\n ong Ci saw that he had changed clothes and felt amused. \u201cBrother Han, you didn\u2019t take off the tag.\u201d\n Han Zhan bent down in front of Song Ci and asked her to remove the tag.\n \u201cThe clothes are not bad.\u201d Han Zhan took the tag from Song Ci\u2019s hand and glanced at the price. He instantly pouted. \u201cExtremely expensive.\u201d\n Song Ci covered her mouth and laughed. \u201cBrother Han, don\u2019t be so stingy. You are the richest man in town.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true. The richest man in town is treating you to seafood.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n Arriving at the seafood restaurant, Song Ci ordered many dishes. Han Zhan asked her, \u201cCan you finish so many dishes?\u201d\n \u201cIf I get pregnant this month, I won\u2019t be able to eat for a long time. I will eat my fill first.\u201d Song Ci swore to be pregnant this month.\n \u201cGood point.\u201d\n After dinner, it was already 8pm. Song Ci wanted to go for a walk in the forest park with Han Zhan, but as soon as they walked out of the restaurant, the chilly wind that blew towards them turned Song Ci into an ice sculpture.\n Song Ci hurriedly got into the car and turned on the heater. Han Zhan was in charge of driving while Song Ci chose a light tune and hummed along to it.\n \u201cAre you still nervous?\u201d Han Zhan suddenly asked.\n Song Ci looked at Han Zhan in astonishment.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cYou cleaned up the cloakroom this afternoon. You only do housework when you\u2019re feeling nervous.\u201d Song Ci usually didn\u2019t do any housework except cooking.\n Han Zhan had set up surveillance cameras in every corner of the house, so Song Ci didn\u2019t find it strange that he discovered this. She was just slightly curious. \u201cHow did you know about this little problem of mine, Brother Han?\u201d\n \u201cI could tell.\u201d Han Zhan paid more attention to Song Ci than she thought.\n Song Ci had no choice but to admit. \u201cYes, I am a little nervous.\u201d\n She told Han Zhan, \u201cActually, my side effects have yet to fully recover. Sometimes, when I hold the bow, my heart still beats very quickly. Last time in Vienna, my palms were all sweaty after the performance.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Le Chi\u2019 will be a huge success internationally. The supporting roles of this movie will all become famous stars in the future. If I can really be chosen by Director Du Fei, it will be very beneficial to my road to pursuing dreams.\u201d\n \u201cI want to be chosen.\u201d\n Song Ci was full of ambition. She said, \u201cI want to become famous and perform in Vienna. I want to become someone better than my teacher! I want my mother to see me succeed.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s mother had high hopes for Song Ci and hoped to groom her into an outstanding violinist. Song Ci had wasted so many years on the violin and now that she picked it up again, how could she not be timid?\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan told her, \u201cJust do it. It doesn\u2019t matter even if you fail. I have money and I will be your backup. You can have countless chances to fail.\u201d At this moment, Han Zhan\u2019s aura was 2.8 meters high.\n Song Ci was reassured by his words.\n After returning home, Han Zhan took out that military jacket from the bag and took out a jewelry box. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d Han Zhan gave the jewelry box to Song Ci.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Song Ci opened the box curiously and saw a pair of pink crystal earrings. \u201cThey look good!\u201d Song Ci took out the earrings and handed them to Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, help me put them on.\u201d\n It was the first time Han Zhan did such a thing and he was slightly nervous.\n He looked at the small hole on Song Ci\u2019s earlobe and asked worriedly, \u201cWon\u2019t it hurt and bleed if I just put it on?\u201d\n \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n His eyes widened as he carefully put the earring on for Song Ci. His left hand was shaking as he put it on. Han Zhan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that there was no blood at all. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d Song Ci hurriedly got up and ran to the washroom. She switched on the light and looked at herself in the mirror.\n The earrings suited her very well, making her appear obedient and charming. Song Ci ran out, hugged Han Zhan, kissed his ear, and told him, \u201cI will wear it to the audition tomorrow!\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci took a shower and practiced for half an hour, before finally falling asleep.\n The next morning, Song Ci woke up early for her morning exercises. After her morning exercises, she had a glass of milk and went upstairs to put on her makeup. Song Ci was very particular about today\u2019s selection and put more effort into her makeup and eye shadow than usual.\n After putting on makeup, Song Ci looked even more beautiful and charming. She looked even better than the celebrities on television dramas. Song Ci came downstairs after changing and was slightly surprised to see that Han Zhan was still at home.\n \u201cBrother Han, aren\u2019t you going to work today?\u201d\n \u201cI am resting today.\u201d Han Zhan turned sideways and stared at Song Ci. He saw that she was wearing a thick long down jacket with a skirt peeking out from under her knees. He asked Song Ci, \u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d\n \u201cA little, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The auditions will be held at the Jetta International Hotel. There\u2019s a heater there.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I will accompany you to the auditions today.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci was overjoyed. She hurriedly carried her violin, changed into flats, followed Han Zhan downstairs, and boarded the car to Jetta International Hotel.\n Arriving at the hotel, Song Ci and Han Zhan boarded the lift together. Han Zhan pressed the button for the fifth floor, took out two toffees from his pocket, and secretly stuffed them into Song Ci\u2019s hands. Song Ci grabbed the toffees. Even before eating them, she already felt that they were very sweet.\n The lift stopped on the fifth floor. Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you in the room upstairs. Don\u2019t be nervous.\u201d\n \u201cMmm!\u201d\n Song Ci took a deep breath. Once the door opened, she straightened her back and carried her violin out. Han Zhan followed the lift up.\n Han Zhan had his own private room in the hotel at 2206. He stepped out of the lift, his leather shoes making no sound on the soft carpet.\n After turning a corner, they arrived at Room 2206. Han Zhan took out his key card and was about to open the door when he saw from the corner of his eye that the door to Room 2209 was pulled open and three people walked out.\n Han Zhan casually glanced over and narrowed his eyes.\n At the door of Room 2209 stood three people\u2014two men and one woman. One of the men was wearing an elite suit, had a fair baby face, and a pair of gentlemanly black-framed glasses. The other man was wearing a down jacket. He was not tall, but he looked very smart.\n The woman standing in front of them was wearing a pure white high slit dress. The dress was very thin and she had draped a pink fur shawl over her shoulders. She was arranging her earrings with her head lowered. When she looked up, her lovely long curly hair drew a black line in the air.\n Her every action was like that of a superstar.\n But when she saw Han Zhan, Du Xueyan was stunned.\n Gu Shengyao saw that Du Xueyan was standing still and urged her. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go down, Xueyan. The director has a bad temper and hates people who are late the most.\u201d\n Du Xueyan didn\u2019t speak but just stared at the tall, mature man in front of her in a daze. It had been several months since they last met and Han Zhan was still as handsome as ever. However, his blue-grey eyes were still cold.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Gu Shengyao noticed Du Xueyan\u2019s unusual behavior. He walked up to her side and glanced at her. Seeing that Du Xueyan was in a daze as she looked at the person in front, Gu Shengyao also looked up at Han Zhan.\n Gu Shengyao recognized Han Zhan.\n This was the first time Gu Shengyao met Du Xueyan\u2019s first boyfriend.\n The photo would weaken a person\u2019s aura and sharpness. The Han Zhan in the photo looked like a tall, handsome man with long legs. But in real life, Han Zhan was domineering. When he fully released his aura, even Gu Shengyao, who had seen all sorts of big shots, had to avoid him.\n He was indeed worthy of being called an elite sniper.\n Du Xueyan snapped out of her trance. She lifted the sides of her dress and walked elegantly and calmly toward Han Zhan. She stopped a meter away from Han Zhan.\n \u201cHan Zhan, long time no see.\u201d Du Xueyan tried her best to sound calm and composed, but her trembling voice betrayed her flustered heart.\n Long time no see.\n It has really been a long time.\n Han Zhan turned around and looked straight at Du Xueyan. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d Unlike Du Xueyan\u2019s feigned calmness, Han Zhan was really calm. The way he looked at Du Xueyan was peaceful. There was no joy or sadness. It was like seeing an old acquaintance.\n Han Zhan\u2019s calm tone made Du Xueyan\u2019s heart sink.\n Staring at the dazzling Du Xueyan, Han Zhan smiled mildly. \u201cI heard that you won the Grammy Awards and brought glory to the Chinese. Congratulations.\u201d\n As if he couldn\u2019t see how awkward Du Xueyan\u2019s expression was, Han Zhan continued, \u201cNow it seems that you were right to choose to break up with me and to work hard for your career.\u201d\n Han Zhan wasn\u2019t blaming Du Xueyan but he really thought so. However, Du Xueyan\u2019s face turned deathly pale at his words.\n \u201cHan Zhan, are you blaming me?\u201d It was hard for Du Xueyan not to think so.\n \u201cHuh?\u201d Han Zhan recalled what he had just said and felt that it was easy for Du Xueyan to misunderstand.\n Han Zhan explained seriously, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you and I don\u2019t hate you anymore. Even if I did, time has already washed away that hatred. Moreover, I am already married and have a wife whom I truly love.\u201d\n Han Zhan took a deep look at Du Xueyan and sincerely wished her well. \u201cDu Xueyan, you sing very well. My wife is also your fan. All the best. I hope that more people will hear your songs and I wish you good luck.\u201d\n With that, Han Zhan opened the door and entered the room without turning back.\n The door closed in front of Du Xueyan. Du Xueyan gazed at the tightly shut door, her heart bleeding profusely.\n Gu Shengyao walked over and held Du Xueyan\u2019s arm. He reminded her. \u201cXueyan, if you don\u2019t go down now, you will be late.\u201d\n \u201cGu Shengyao, did you hear that? He wished me good luck and hoped that I\u2019ll be popular.\u201d Du Xueyan gazed at the dark pattern on the carpet, her vision gradually blurring.\n Gu Shengyao furrowed his brows in frustration. \u201cDu Xueyan, don\u2019t forget who you are and what you should do after seeing an old lover.\u201d Compared to such a Du Xueyan, Gu Shengyao admired the Du Xueyan who would give up everything just to succeed.\n Du Xueyan took a deep breath and closed her eyes.\n \u201cI\u2019 m ready.\u201d She gathered the shawl tighter around her shoulders, lifted her heels, and walked on like a proud peacock.\n I can only walk forward and not retreat!\n Du Xueyan\u2019s appearance at the waiting hall on the fifth floor stunned all the contestants. No one expected Du Xueyan to be involved in this audition. Director Du Junei\u2019s reputation was not to be underestimated.\n As soon as Du Xueyan and Gu Shengyao arrived, they knocked on the door of the interview room without waiting in line and entered alone.\n Song Ci walked out of the washroom and saw a white figure disappearing into the main entrance of the hall. She glanced at it casually before retracting her gaze and walking to her own stool to sit down.\n After Song Ci sat down, she heard her cell phone ring. It was a message from Han Zhan.\n Song Ci felt it was strange. Han Zhan usually contacted her via WeChat. Why did he text her this time?\n ong Ci took out her cell phone and opened the message box. Han Zhan said, [Baby Ci, I met Du Xueyan at the hotel corridor just now. She seems to be taking part in the auditions too. All the best!]\n Right after meeting Du Xueyan, Han Zhan told Song Ci about this. Han Zhan was well-versed in the ways of husband and wife and knew that as husband and wife, they should be more honest with each other to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.\n Upon receiving this message, Song Ci was more shocked than jealous.\n Du Xueyan is also participating in the pre-selection?\n Du Xueyan and Han Zhan met upstairs?\n Song Ci snapped out of her trance and felt slightly sour inside. It was so disgusting to see an old lover.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t reply to Han Zhan\u2019s message. She turned to look at the scene. She didn\u2019t see Du Xueyan but saw Gu Shengyao standing by the window making a call.\n It looked like the woman in the white dress whom she saw at the door of the interview room was Du Xueyan.\n Song Ci was originally not nervous. But after knowing that Du Xueyan was also a competitor, she suddenly felt slightly nervous.\n Song Ci hurriedly ate a piece of toffee to calm her nerves.\n \u2013\n About 10 minutes later, Du Xueyan came out. Once she came out, everyone looked up and stared at Du Xueyan.\n Du Xueyan ignored their stares. She walked toward Gu Shengyao and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d\n Gu Shengyao asked her, \u201cHow do you feel? Are you confident?\u201d\n Du Xueyan frowned and said, \u201cI\u2019 m not sure either. Let\u2019s wait for the notice.\u201d Du Xueyan was a singer, not an actress. She had come to this audition with the intention of giving it a try. Although it would be a pity if she couldn\u2019t be chosen, she wouldn\u2019t lose hope.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d\n The two of them were about to leave when Du Junfei\u2019s assistant opened the door and shouted. \u201cNext, Song Ci!\u201d\n A graceful figure stood up from the crowd. The girl was wearing a silver pink, pleated fairy-style dress. Her black hair was wound up in a bun and there was no jewelry on her elegant neck.\n She was only wearing a pair of pink crystal earrings, but the simple adornment was breathtakingly beautiful.\n Song Ci was wearing flats and holding a violin in her hand as she walked gracefully towards the main door. Just as she was about to enter, she suddenly turned around and looked up at Gu Shengyao and Du Xueyan.\n Du Xueyan narrowed her eyes. She also stared at Song Ci. The two of them stared at each other in silence.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "198": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-199\n\n Chapter 198: Brother Han has Nothing Else but Money  \u201cSong Ci, come in quickly!\u201d\n Hearing the assistant\u2019s urging, Song Ci looked away and entered the interview room with her head held high.\n Only after seeing Song Ci enter did Du Xueyan turn to Gu Shengyao beside her. \u201cWas that look in her eyes just now a provocation?\u201d Du Xueyan felt that it was unbelievable. In the past two years, very few people dared to be so arrogant in front of her.\n There was a hint of amusement in Gu Shengyao\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe is quite arrogant.\u201d As expected of a young woman, it was cute to be slightly arrogant.\n \u201cAt the end of the day, she\u2019s still young and full of vigor. Doesn\u2019t she know how to keep a low profile?\u201d With that, Du Xueyan turned and left.\n But Gu Shengyao knew exactly what Du Xueyan was thinking. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re jealous of her.\u201d\n Du Xueyan felt that Gu Shengyao\u2019s words were very ridiculous. I\u2019m a female singer who has won Grammy\u2019s recognition and all sorts of awards. How can I be jealous of Song Ci? \u201cTell me, what am I jealous of?\u201d\n Gu Shengyao\u2019s voice sounded calmly from behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous of Song Ci\u2019s youthful vigor and her unhesitating determination.\u201d Du Xueyan couldn\u2019t bring herself to disregard everyone\u2019s disdain and mockery for marrying Han Zhan, but Song Ci could.\n Du Xueyan suddenly stopped in her tracks. She turned and glared at Gu Shengyao. She scolded him angrily. \u201cGu Shengyao, you are so annoying.\u201d She hated Gu Shengyao\u2019s straightforwardness. There were some things that should be seen through but not exposed.\n Gu Shengyao shrugged. \u201cI was just speaking the truth.\u201d Du Xueyan was distracted today, so he had to say something harsh to wake her up.\n Du Xueyan was so angry that her neck felt slightly swollen. She glared fiercely at Gu Shengyao as if she had many things to say. But in the end, she didn\u2019t say anything and just turned to leave.\n I\u2019m not jealous of Song Ci!\n She\u2019s just a little girl who is arrogant just because of her good looks. She\u2019s still young and has never been beaten by society. She thought that possessing love meant possessing the entire world.\n She\u2019s just too young.\n \u2013\n Song Ci, who was too young, stared in astonishment at the two people seated at the judges\u2019 table.\n On the left was a middle-aged man in a casual suit. He was the world-renowned movie director, Du Junfei. On the right was an old man with a European face. He had white hair and was dressed in an unruly manner. His hooked nose gave him an unapproachable aura.\n After recognizing this old man, Song Ci\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n Coleman Brightman, the world-renowned father of piano and the greatest musical miracle of the 20th century!\n Coleman was born in 1950 in France. He was an autistic patient who refused to talk to anyone since a young age and locked himself in his own world, but this autistic patient was a piano genius. When he was 4 years old and saw a piano for the first time in a shopping mall, he started playing a soul-stirring melody on his own.\n After discovering her child\u2019s musical talent, Coleman\u2019s mother sent him to learn how to play the piano. Coleman, who didn\u2019t like to speak and couldn\u2019t even count up to a hundred, shocked the entire world with his piano talent.\n Two years ago, Coleman\u2019s elderly mother died of cancer. Before her death, she entrusted the Hollywood gold-plated screenwriter Vichya with her diary, which she had written about Coleman\u2019s daily life, to turn it into a movie. She hoped that they could turn it into a movie so that the world would know about the life of the legendary pianist Coleman.\n Le Chi was a relic left behind by his mother for Coleman.\n Rather than calling \u201cLe Chi\u201d a movie, it would be more accurate to call it a biography. Coleman was the main character.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t expect to see Coleman here and became even more nervous.\n Song Ci had met Du Junfei when she was young. At that time, she called him Second Master Du. But after so many years, Song Ci wasn\u2019t sure if Du Junfei still remembered her. She also didn\u2019t want Du Junfei to misunderstand that she was trying to use connections to get in through the back door, so she obediently said, \u201cHello, Director Du.\u201d\n Du Junfei stared at her for a while before smiling. \u201cWhy? It has only been nine years and you already don\u2019t recognize your Second Master?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled radiantly like a henchman, when she saw that Du Junfei was still treating her the same way she used to. \u201cSecond Master, it has been so many years since we last met. You are still as handsome as ever. How did you maintain your skin? I will learn from you later!\u201d\n Song Ci was lying through her teeth. She pretended not to see Du Junfei\u2019s wrinkles.\n Hearing this, warmth surfaced in Du Junfei\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh you, you are still the same old smooth-tongued, shameless person.\u201d Du Junfei felt that it was very rare. How could such a reticent Shen Yubei have such a glib disciple like Song Ci?\n Song Ci shot a questioning look at Du Junfei. \u201cDirector Du, is this old man beside you Coleman?\u201d Song Ci wasn\u2019t sure if she had recognized the wrong person, so she spoke to Du Junfei in Chinese.\n Du Junfei nodded and told Song Ci, \u201cIn this audition, Coleman will be the interviewer. Whether you can catch his eye will depend on your capabilities. So, don\u2019t try to bribe your Second Master. It\u2019s useless.\u201d\n Song Ci clicked her tongue and said, \u201cSecond Old Master, you are looking down on me. I am beautiful, kind, and talented. I will never bribe anyone.\u201d\n Du Junfei snorted.\n As an autistic patient, Coleman rarely took the initiative to speak to others. Sometimes, when others spoke to him, he would act like he was in a trance and ignore them.\n As a result, while Junfei and Song Ci were talking and smiling, Coleman was still staring at his watch in a daze, as if he was completely unmoved.\n Song Ci kept her smile and said to Du Junfei, \u201cDirector Du, I am ready.\u201d\n The director nodded. He turned slightly and said a few words to Coleman. Coleman didn\u2019t respond, but his light blue eyes looked at Song Ci. He stared at Song Ci\u2019s figure and manner for a full two minutes, until Song Ci felt uneasy and uncomfortable all over. Only then did Coleman retract his gaze.\n \u201cIs the violin your favorite instrument?\u201d Coleman spoke slowly but clearly.\n Song Ci tried her best to speak slowly. \u201cYes, I love the violin very much. It is my lifelong pursuit.\u201d\n Coleman\u2019s expression warmed slightly.\n His posture was still very upright. He pointed at the violin in Song Ci\u2019s hand and said to her, \u201cJust play any song.\u201d\n This was for Song Ci to choose her own song.\n Song Ci could choose any song that she was familiar with or play any famous song to please Coleman. Song Ci stared at his nervous posture for a while before finally taking action.\n She lifted her violin, placed the bow on the strings, and played a popular tune \u2014\n \u201cThe Blinking Little Star Variation\u201d.\n With a cheerful tune playing, Coleman suddenly glanced at Song Ci and gradually relaxed in his seat. He even raised his right hand and tapped his fingers gently in the air, as if he was playing the piano.\n As he increased the speed of his fingers, Song Ci also increased the rhythm. When he slowed down, Song Ci also slowed down. The two of them worked together just like that.\n fter the performance, Song Ci put down her violin and smiled sweetly at Coleman.\n Coleman stared at Song Ci\u2019s smile. He was momentarily stunned before turning to look elsewhere. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Coleman asked the first question since meeting her.\n Du Junfei glanced at Coleman in surprise. They had already interviewed five girls today and this was the first time he had asked about the interviewer\u2019s age. Even the previous singer, Du Xueyan, had not received any response from him.\n Song Ci thought it was a usual question and answered, \u201c23 years old.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, a glint suddenly dimmed in Coleman\u2019s eyes.\n Coleman stared at his watch in a daze.\n Autistic patients all behaved very strangely. They would suddenly become silent and sometimes even get angry and make a big fuss. People like Coleman, who would occasionally stare at an object in a daze, was already the best scenario.\n Song Ci and Du Junfei didn\u2019t disturb him.\n Half a minute later, Coleman lifted his head and looked at her with a gaze that Song Ci couldn\u2019t understand. He said, \u201cMike me smile[1].\u201d\n Hearing this request, Song Ci was slightly shocked and so was Du Junfei. The two of them exchanged glances. Only then did Junfei turn to Coleman. \u201cColeman, you should let her act according to the script instead.\u201d\n Coleman pretended not to hear him. He looked at Song Ci intently and said again, \u201cMike-meime, Please.\u201d\n Although she felt that this request was very strange, Coleman was the interviewer. Song Ci could only try her best to satisfy him.\n How to make a patient with autism smile?\n Just like how children liked candy and barbie dolls, Coleman also had his own likings.. He liked music, music that made people happy, and music that made them smile.\n Song Ci played...\n A lullaby!\n When she was young, whenever their mother played a lullaby to put them to bed, even Song Fei would smile when she was asleep, let alone Song Ci.\n Coleman was stunned by the sound of the lullaby. His body went limp as he leaned back against the chair and closed his eyes.\n The image of a young girl surfaced in Colleman\u2019s mind. She was wearing a red plaid skirt and carrying a violin. Her white leather shoes danced on the cobblestones like a fairy.\n The corners of Colleman\u2019s lips curled up as he thought of that girl. It was a faint smile, but it was filled with happiness.\n After Song Ci finished her performance, the room instantly fell silent. After a while, Coleman opened his eyes and looked straight at Song Ci. He said, \u201cRain.\u201d He turned and said to Du Fei, \u201cIt\u2019s her.\u201d\n Song Ci was utterly confused.\n Coleman got up and left the audition room with his personal butler. He didn\u2019t intend to continue interviewing anyone else.\n Song Ci and Du Junfei stared at each other. Worried that she might have misunderstood, Song Ci hurriedly asked Du Junfei, \u201cSecond Master, has Coleman chosen me?\u201d\n Du Junfei remained silent. He took a cigarette and started smoking it in front of Song Ci.\n After taking a puff, Du Junfei suddenly cursed. \u201cDamn, what kind of dog-shit luck is this!\u201d\n Song Ci was puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Du Junfei said, \u201cInitially, you guys were interviewing for the role of Coleman\u2019s junior, but Rain...\u201d Du Junfei held his cigarette and gazed at Song Ci through the smoke.\u201d She\u2019s his first love and is the true female lead in this movie. \u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. She clearly remembered that there was no female lead in this movie!\n Du Junfei shook his head and lamented that Song Ci was so lucky to have been possessed by a super-genius. \u201cWe have been preparing for this movie for a year but we have never been able to find an actress who fits the image of Rain in the eyes of Coleman. After discussion, we have unanimously decided to delete all of this character\u2019s scenes. Anyway, Rain only appeared for a short one year in Coleman\u2019s life and doesn\u2019t have many scenes.\u201d\n \u201cBecause of you, Le Chi has a female lead.\u201d\n Du Junfei tilted his head and chewed on his cigarette. He spread his hands and congratulated Song Ci with a faint smile. \u201cCongratulations, Song Ci. You have been Shen Yubei\u2019s disciple your entire life. It is finally your turn to be my female lead.\u201d\n Song Ci was dumbstruck by this pleasant surprise.\n She returned to the 22nd floor and stood at the door to the 2206th floor. She had forgotten to knock.\n Han Zhan sensed that there was someone at the door. He opened the door and saw the dazed Song Ci. Without saying anything, he pulled her into his arms.\n Placing Song Ci\u2019s little head on his chest, Han Zhan patted Song Ci\u2019s shoulder and comforted her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re not a professional actor. It\u2019s not embarrassing even if you\u2019re not chosen. If you really want to act, I\u2019ll go invest in a drama later. You can enjoy yourself there.\u201d\n Song Ci remained silent.\n Thinking that Song Ci was too upset, Han Zhan racked his brains to think of a way to cheer her up. At this moment, Song Ci suddenly stomped her feet excitedly in his arms. \u201cBrother Han!\u201d\n Song Ci broke free from Han Zhan\u2019s embrace. Carrying the violin on her back, she walked in circles along the corridor, her skirt fluttering in the wind. She was both beautiful and maniacal.\n Han Zhan thought to himself, Oh no, why is she so out of sorts?\n Song Ci stopped and grinned at Han Zhan. She told him, \u201cBrother Han, I\u2019ve been chosen. I\u2019m going to be the female lead in \u2018Le Chi\u2019!\u201d Song Ci was so worked up that her face was flushed red.\n At first, Han Zhan didn\u2019t believe her words and thought that she was just imagining things. At this moment, Shen Yubei called.\n Song Ci regained her composure and picked up the call. She turned on the speaker mode and Han Zhan heard Shen Yubei say, \u201cI heard from Du Junfei that you\u2019ve been selected by Coleman to be the female lead?\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly smug. She couldn\u2019t help but wag her non-existent tail and boast to her teacher. \u201cTeacher, did I make you proud? Please consider giving me a red packet.\u201d\n \u201cYou are already so old, why do you still need red packets!\u201d\n Shen Yubei hung up and turned to tell the butler. \u201cPack a big red packet and have it delivered to Song Ci\u2019s house.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, Sir.\u201d\n Only after hearing this news from Shen Yubei did Han Zhan finally believe that Song Ci had really been chosen by the crew of \u201cLe Chi\u201d.\n Female lead?\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were slightly dark.\n Du Xueyan had left me in order to pursue her singing career. What about Song Ci?\n Song Ci didn\u2019t notice Han Zhan\u2019s uneasiness and pulled him into the room.\n Walking into the room, Song Ci opened a bottle of red wine. \u201cLet\u2019s sneak a drink before I get pregnant.\u201d She poured two glasses and gave one to Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan asked calmly, \u201cAre we still going ahead with our plan to make babies?\u201d\n \u201cOf course we will continue!\u201d Song Ci felt that Han Zhan\u2019s question was strange and said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n Han Zhan said vaguely, \u201cBe it marriage or pregnancy, it will affect a young and beautiful actress.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci put down her glass solemnly.\n \u201cWait for me to ask.\u201d Saying so, Song Ci picked up her cell phone.\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cAsk what?\u201d\n Song Ci searched for the number on her cell phone as she explained to Han Zhan. \u201cMany investors have requested that the female lead of the movie isn\u2019t allowed to date, get married or have children, between the filming of the movie and the screening of the movie. I have to ask Second Old Master Gu about this. If this movie also has such a rule, then I should just reject it earlier.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. If his investor is really so domineering, I\u2019ll invest in it.\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t have anything but money and could invest in a movie.\n Song Ci felt more confident now.\n She called Du Junfei and clarified her concerns. \u201cSecond Master, I am already married and am preparing for pregnancy. If the investor really has such requests, I will not be acting in this movie.\u201d\n Du Junfei knew that Song Ci was married. He told her, \u201cThey can\u2019t care so much about my movie. The movie will officially start shooting in a month\u2019s time. Your scenes will only start shooting in the spring. If everything goes smoothly, you will finish filming within a month. Even if you get pregnant this month, your tummy won\u2019t show. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n Song Ci was relieved to hear that.\n \u201cOh yes, I will get my lawyer to prepare the contract as soon as possible. When you come over to sign the contract, bring the script back to familiarize yourself with it.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After waiting for Du Junfei to hang up, Song Ci put down her phone and realized that Han Zhan\u2019s expression was slightly strange, as if he was very touched. She still felt puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Brother Han? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d\n Han Zhan pulled Song Ci into his arms and said, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not willing to let you film a movie. I\u2019m afraid that after you\u2019ve tasted the benefits of fame and fortune, you\u2019ll want more. Gradually, I, Han Zhan, am nothing compared to those glories.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. \u201cWhy would you think that, Brother Han?\u201d\n Han Zhan also felt rather foolish. \u201cOnce bitten, twice shy. It\u2019s probably because I\u2019ve been abandoned before, so I\u2019m scared.\u201d\n Song Ci realized that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t very confident in his relationships probably not only because of Du Xueyan, but also because of his parents. When he was young, his father killed his mother in front of Han Zhan and planted a bomb in his heart, making him feel that relationships were not trustworthy.\n This was a wound caused by his own family, so it was very difficult to heal.\n \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019re both my lover and my family. To me, family is ultimately precious. I will never abandon my family.\u201d Her parents and elder sister had taught her the importance of family. Even if she had to sacrifice wealth and status, Song Ci would never abandon her own family.\n \u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d Not everyone was like Du Xueyan. Not everyone was as ruthless as his father. There were more good people in this world than bad people.\n \u2013\n ]The next night, Du Junfei sent the contract to Song Ci.\n Song Ci forwarded the contract to Han Zhan and asked him to get Manager Yan from the legal department to inspect it.\n Since the founding of Zeus Corporation, all the major and minor operations of the company had been handled by the two Vice Presidents Bei Zhan and Li Li. Meanwhile, the real big boss had never appeared in public before.\n The identity of the big boss was a mystery. All they knew was that the big boss\u2019s office was on the top level. Apart from the top leaders, no one else had the right to enter.\n Guessing who the real big boss was had already become the hottest topic of discussion among the company\u2019s employees. Everyone had a vague idea of who the big boss was, but since the news hadn\u2019t been verified, everyone pretended not to know.\n Manager Yan from the legal department perked up when he suddenly received the contract from Han Zhan!\n It\u2019s coming! It\u2019s coming!\n The big boss had finally noticed me. It\u2019s time for me to show my capabilities!\n Manager Yan took out his greatest patience and professionalism. He read through the contract, found two things that needed to be amended, and sent it to Han Zhan.\n After receiving the contract, Han Zhan opened it and read through it seriously. He felt that the other party was rather capable and managed to find all the details that he didn\u2019t notice. He casually mentioned to Li Li, \u201cThe newly-appointed Manager Yan of the legal department is rather meticulous. Which school did he graduate from?\u201d\n Li Li would also take better care of someone who could be remembered by Han Zhan. Hearing this, Li Li said, \u201cManager Yan graduated from the University of Law. In the past, he was the boss of a law firm. But later on, because he took the initiative to defend a murderer, his reputation deteriorated and the business of the law firm deteriorated. In the end, he couldn\u2019t make it and came to our company.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d Han Zhan asked curiously, \u201cWhy would he take the initiative to defend a murderer?\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s expression was slightly complicated. He said, \u201cThe murderer is his mother. About 15 years ago, his mother murdered and dismembered his father. Three years ago, someone built a house and dug up a foundation. They discovered the body of the victim and reported it to the police. Later on, the police solved the case and Manager Yan\u2019s mother was arrested and sentenced to death.\u201d\n \u201cManager Yan was brought up by his mother. He couldn\u2019t bear to see his own mother sentenced to death, so he used the loophole of the law to try to reduce his mother\u2019s sentence. In the end, she was sentenced to life imprisonment.\u201d\n \u201cBut this incident also attracted the attention of the rival law firm, so they purposely discredited Manager Yan. In the end, Manager Yan\u2019s reputation became tarnished, and the law firm couldn\u2019t be opened anymore. Bei Zhan then poached him over to our company.\u201d\n \u201cWhy? Are you going to promote him to be the head of the legal department?\u201d\n After thinking for a moment, Han Zhan shook his head and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll observe first and decide later.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, okay.\u201d\n The company had a heater and Han Zhan felt hot. He took off his tie and even unbuttoned two buttons of his shirt.\n Li Li noticed that there was a hickey near Han Zhan\u2019s collarbone under his neck. He gave him a suggestive smile. \u201cMr. Han, your married life has been very intense recently.\u201d As Li Li spoke, he pointed at his collarbone.\n Han Zhan saw Li Li\u2019s hint and realized something. He hurriedly got up, walked to the washroom, looked in the mirror, and found a hickey beside his collarbone.\n On the night she met Du Xueyan, Song Ci acted like a maniac, threatening to leave a mark on Han Zhan and purposely left a hickey. Unexpectedly, it had been two days and still hadn\u2019t faded.\n Han Zhan hurriedly buttoned up his shirt before returning to the office. He took off his tie and put it on. After he was done, Li Li suddenly placed an invitation on Han Zhan\u2019s desk.\n Han Zhan looked down and was instantly stunned.\n \u201cWedding? You and Su Beibei?\u201d A wedding invitation was placed on Han Zhan\u2019s table.\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you in such a hurry?\u201d Han Zhan was in disbelief. \u201cHow long have you two known each other?\u201d\n Li Li said, \u201cThe earlier we get married, the earlier we get to enjoy married life.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt that this sentence sounded strangely familiar.\n Li Li kindly reminded Han Zhan. \u201cThe first sentence was something you said to me personally when you first cohabited with Ms. Song. Mr. Han, you have a good memory. You must remember it.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n In terms of haste, there really weren\u2019t many couples who married as quickly as he and Song Ci.\n Li Li smiled sheepishly. He said, \u201cActually, we were planning to get married next spring but suddenly decided to change the date to December. The main reason is because Beibei is pregnant. I am almost thirty and Beibei also wants this child, so we pushed the date forward by three months.\u201d\n Hearing that Su Beibei was pregnant, Han Zhan was thunderstruck.\n \u201cPregnant?\u201d Song Ci and I aren\u2019t even pregnant and Su Beibei and Li Li were already pregnant?\n Li Li nodded. \u201cYes. We went to the hospital two days ago for a check-up and the baby is fine. We intend to have her. My mother is overjoyed to know about this.\u201d\n \u201cMr. Han, remember to come to the wedding banquet.\u201d Previously, he had always been stuffed with dog food by Han Zhan, while Li Li had always been snored by the sweetness. Thinking that in the future, Mr. Han\u2019s children would have to call their own children elder brothers or elder sister, Li Li felt very proud and elated. When he left the office, his steps were full of dominance.\n After Li Li left, Han Zhan picked up the invitation, took a photo, and sent it to Song Ci. He told her: [Su Beibei is pregnant.]\n Song Ci had just sent the revised version of the contract to Du Junfei when she saw Han Zhan\u2019s message.\n Song Ci was shocked.\n Su Beibei is pregnant?\n Song Ci didn\u2019t even look at the wedding invitation. She hurriedly sent a video to Su Beibei in order to verify this.\n It was late at night and Su Beibei was still writing. There was only a small light in the room. She logged into WeChat and accepted the video call. Su Beibei got up and turned on the light before pouring herself a glass of warm water.\n Su Beibei stood in her room and walked slowly. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here for two hours and my butt is hurting.\u201d\n Song Ci stared at Su Beibei\u2019s stomach enviously. \u201cI heard from Li Li that you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d\n Su Beibei nodded. \u201cYes, it has already been two months.\u201d\n Knowing that Song Ci and Han Zhan were also preparing for pregnancy, Su Beibei asked her, \u201cThere\u2019s still no news of you and Han Zhan?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n Song Ci laid down on the bed and focused the camera on her face and chest. Song Ci\u2019s pyjamas were slightly low-cut. As she laid there, the cleavage was very obvious. Su Beibei glanced at her and said, \u201cRaise the shirt higher. Don\u2019t let my child see any inappropriate images.\u201d\n Song Ci scolded her for being too troublesome but still tugged at her shirt.\n \u201cBeibei, I am not pregnant yet. Do you think there\u2019s something wrong with Brother Han\u2019s and my health?\u201d Last month, during her fertile period, they had tried to make babies everyday but to no avail. Song Ci had been thinking about something recently.\n Is there something wrong with one of them?\n Su Beibei said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re young and should be very easily pregnant. Moreover, Han Zhan is only 32 years old and at his prime. There\u2019s no such thing as pregnancy difficulties.\u201d\n \u201cThat might not be the case. What if my fallopian tube gets clogged?\u201d It was not impossible.\n \u201cIf you\u2019re really worried, go and check.\u201d\n \u201cLet me wait and see. If nothing happens in another two months, Brother Han and I will go for a fertility checkup.\u201d Technology was very advanced now. If worst came to worst, they could also do a IVF.\n \u201cAlright.\u201d\n \u201cOh yes, I am going to film a movie. It\u2019s written by the golden scriptwriter in Hollywood and will be directed by Du Junfei, and I will be the female lead.\u201d Although the movie would only last 30 minutes after editing, she was still be the female lead!\n Su Beibei was slightly shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the female lead?\u201d Su Beibei was in disbelief. \u201cWhat are you performing? Are you going to glare at me and act cute?\u201d Apart from that, Su Beibei couldn\u2019t imagine what else Song Ci could do.\n Song Ci hung up angrily.\n Du Junfei was going back to the United States tomorrow and had just moved back to the hotel from Shen Yubei\u2019s house the day before.\n Song Ci went to the hotel to look for him to sign the contract. She sat on a chaise longue in the hotel, no longer as arrogant and confident as before. She even looked like she had a lot on her mind. Knowing that she was purposely acting pitiful, Du Junfei said, \u201cAlright, stop pretending. What else do you want to say?\u201d\n \u201cSecond Master!\u201d Song Ci told Du Junfei her concerns. \u201cSecond Old Master, I know I am pretty and talented, but I have never acted in a movie before. Your production team and the main cast are both very strong. As a greenhorn with no acting experience, I am rather worried that I won\u2019t know anything in front of the camera.\u201d\n Du Junfei chuckled. \u201cWith your shamelessness, what else can you not do in front of the cameras?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t like hearing this. \u201cNo matter how thick-skinned I am, I will still be nervous when faced with several cameras.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you just need to be beautiful.\u201d Du Junfei told Song Ci. \u201cGo back and look at the script. The entire movie\u2019s description of Rain is very beautiful. She is unbelievably perfect.\u201d\n \u201cIn Coleman\u2019s eyes, Rain doesn\u2019t have any shortcomings. She is an angel, a woman who has been beautified to the point of being inhuman.\u201d Gazing at Song Ci\u2019s face, he continued. \u201cWith this face of yours, you are acting out your true colors.\u201d\n Song Ci found it strange and asked, \u201cIs Mr. Coleman\u2019s first love Asian?\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s Chinese.\u201d\n \u201cOh I see.\u201d\n After signing the contract, Song Ci left the hotel with the script for \u201cLe Chi.\u201d Arriving at the first level of the hotel, Song Ci saw the old man standing in the lobby.\n She stopped, hesitated, and started to walk toward Coleman. \u201cColeman.\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci calling him, Coleman turned around after a while.\n Upon recognizing Song Ci, Coleman didn\u2019t nod or speak as if he didn\u2019t see her.\n Over the past two days, Song Ci had also looked up information on many patients with autism. She knew that there was a huge portion of autism patients who wouldn\u2019t react even if you called them. As a result, Song Ci didn\u2019t find this reaction strange at all. She told Coleman, \u201cThe weather today is not bad. Mr. Coleman, you can go out for a walk. Wangdong City is actually quite beautiful.\u201d\n Coleman was still looking up at the oil painting on the wall.\n Realizing that Coleman might not have heard her at all, Song Ci felt awkward and wanted to leave. She had just taken two steps when she suddenly heard Coleman speak French. Due to her mother, Song Ci could understand some simple French but couldn\u2019t speak it.\n Song Ci understood what Coleman meant. He was saying \u2014\n \u201cAre you willing to take a walk with me?\u201d\n Song Ci turned around in shock and realized that Coleman was indeed looking at her.\n Song Ci asked in uncertain English, \u201cColeman, do you want me to take a walk with you?\u201d\n Coleman didn\u2019t like being asked questions or answering them in the same way. He looked elsewhere and said, \u201cAre you willing to walk with me?\u201d This time, he spoke English.\n Song Ci hesitated before agreeing. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci was very familiar with Wangdong City. She walked side by side with Coleman. The warm sunlight shone on Song Ci\u2019s cold white skin, which was covered in a layer of golden glow.\n Coleman gazed at her and suddenly spoke in French again. But this time, Song Ci didn\u2019t understand.\n They walked to the park on the banks of the Dragon River and sat down on a bench in front of a fountain. Song Ci was dressed rather thinly, while Coleman was dressed warmly. However, he didn\u2019t know how to be a gentleman and wouldn\u2019t give his jacket to Song Ci.\n Song Ci rubbed her hands together.\n Coleman didn\u2019t seem to notice Song Ci\u2019s action. He said, \u201cThis river is very beautiful.\u201d\n Song Ci was about to tell him the name of the river when Coleman added. \u201cThe buns this morning were very tasty.\u201d\n Only then did Song Ci realize that Coleman was chatting with her. It was just that his way of chatting was rather unique. Song Ci imitated his way of speaking and also said, \u201cI ate cereal this morning without sugar.\u201d\n Coleman nodded.\n Then they suddenly fell silent, as if they had nothing to say.\n A talkative person like Song Ci didn\u2019t like to interact with silent people, much less with autistic patients like Coleman.\n Song Ci looked at her watch and felt that it was time for her to leave. But she was worried about leaving Coleman alone outside, so she sent a message to Du Junfei to send someone to fetch him home.\n Just then, Coleman suddenly said, \u201cShe\u2019s missing.\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cWho?\u201d\n Coleman went on his own way. \u201cShe has been missing for 35 years. I miss her very much, everytime.\u201d\n Knowing that she couldn\u2019t pry any information out of Coleman, Song Ci remained silent and just listened quietly.\n \u201cRain is dead.\u201d Coleman pressed his hand to his heart.\u201d My heart has never beat for her again. I know she is dead. Dead somewhere I don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear it. She told Coleman, \u201cPerhaps she is still alive. You just lost contact with her.\u201d\n Coleman said nothing.\n Shortly after, Du Junfei\u2019s assistant brought Coleman\u2019s butler over to fetch him. Song Ci got up and bid farewell to him. As she turned around, she suddenly heard Coleman ask, \u201cChild, when did your mother die?\u201d\n Song Ci felt it was strange. How did Coleman know that my mother had passed away? Could it be that Du Junfei told him?\n Song Ci looked at Coleman with uncertainty. \u201cEight years ago.\u201d\n Coleman stopped talking again.\n After parting ways with Song Ci, Coleman returned to the hotel. He sat at the head of the bed, picked up his phone, and called the screenwriter of \u201cLe Chi.\u201d\n The screenwriter was very surprised to know that it was Coleman. This was the first time he had spoken to her.\n \u201cColeman? Hello, is there anything you wish to tell me?\u201d Recalling that Coleman didn\u2019t like to be questioned by others, the screenwriter changed her way of speaking and said, \u201cColeman, I am very happy to chat with you. You must have something to tell me.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Coleman told the screenwriter. \u201cRain is dead.\u201d\n The screenwriter was shocked. \u201cRain?\u201d Coleman\u2019s first girlfriend? The Rain who appeared briefly in his life for a year before suddenly disappearing?\n \u201cMy Rain is dead.\u201d\n \u201cMy Rain is dead.\u201d\n ...\n As if possessed, Coleman repeated the same sentence over and over again. The butler noticed that something was off with Coleman and hurried into the room to offer him a glass of water.\n \u201cColeman, you are just thirsty and want to drink some water. I brought you some water. You will recover after drinking some water.\u201d The butler was very good at comforting Coleman.\n Coleman drank the water and indeed felt much better.\n Under the butler\u2019s comforting, Coleman laid down. Unable to fall asleep, he opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling. He muttered to himself. \u201cI saw a child who looked exactly like Rain. That child also knows how to play the violin.\u201d\n \u201cRain is dead, my Rain is dead.\u201d\n I can never find my Jiang Shiyu again.\n [1] He meant \u2018make me smile\u2019\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "199": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-200\n\n Chapter 199: Han Zhan: I Want to be Your Life-Long Pursuit  Song Ci returned home with the script. She made herself a cup of strong coffee and moved the sofa to the French window. Once the ceremony was complete, Song Ci sat down on the sofa, picked up the coffee with one hand, and started reading the script.\n The script was written in pure English and Song Ci could understand it.\n The script was two-fingers thick. Song Ci had to calm down before she could read it seriously.\n Coleman\u2019s mother was called Vivian. When Coleman was two and a half years old, Vivian and her husband discovered that he was suffering from autism. At that time, World War II had just ended and the global economy had yet to recover. As a result, it was very bleak. Vivian\u2019s husband didn\u2019t approve of Vivian spending most of her time and money on Coleman. He advocated having another child.\n But Vivian couldn\u2019t bear to give up Coleman so cruelly. After several rounds of communication with her husband, the husband and wife decided to divorce.\n Vivian continued to take care of her autistic child, while Coleman\u2019s father married another woman and had a happy new family.\n Vivian was alone with her son, who was suffering from autism. She was a female shoemaker and managed a shoe shop while taking care of her child. Business was good and she led a decent life.\n When Coleman was 4 years old, Vivian discovered that he was extremely talented in the field of piano, so she made a bold decision to send him to learn piano!\n Piano learning was an extremely expensive art in that era. It was a high-end musical instrument that only the rich could afford. One could imagine how hard it must have been for Vivian to groom Coleman.\n For Coleman, Vivian had never remarried in her entire life. She was a strong and great mother who deserved everyone\u2019s respect.\n The script was edited by the editor via Vivian\u2019s diary. Song Ci was only reading this story as a bystander. She could also feel the helplessness and sadness of a normal person in the face of an autistic patient.\n She didn\u2019t dare to think too deeply about how much pain and struggle Vivian had gone through in her life.\n Song Ci spent the entire afternoon and dinner reading the entire story. After reading it, Song Ci felt very despondent. Not only was Coleman born with autism, he was also abandoned by his father when he was young and lost his first love when he was middle-aged.\n Why did the kind-hearted and outstanding Coleman have a life full of regrets?\n After reading the entire script, Song Ci still didn\u2019t have a clear impression of Coleman\u2019s first love, Rain. She only knew that Rain was 20 years younger than Coleman and they met at a concert. That year, Rain was only 19 years old.\n Rain was the younger sister of Lyme, a concert pianist. She was very talkative and had a melodious voice. Her laughter was melodious, like that of an oriole.\n Coleman, who was living in his own world, was also attracted by Rain\u2019s laughter. During his free time without the piano, he would occasionally secretly pay attention to her. Watching her laugh and making a scene made him feel that this world was also rather interesting.\n The young and lively Rain loved to tease people. Once, when Coleman came to the orchestra for a rehearsal, Rain secretly pasted a smiley face on his score. When Coleman finished his performance, he closed the score and noticed the smiley face pasted on the front page.\n He stared at that smiling face and smiled unconsciously.\n After the rehearsal, Coleman secretly took that smiley face with him when he left. In every performance after that, he would place that smiley face on the piano. From then on, that smiley face became Coleman\u2019s lucky charm.\n Coleman went to the orchestra more and more. Sometimes, he would just quietly sit below the stage and watch as Rain performed on stage.\n Rain had discovered Colleman\u2019s interest in her.\n Once, when Coleman passed under a tree, he saw Rain sitting on a branch, dangling her white legs. Staring at Rain, he thought she looked like a little bird about to fall from the sky at any moment and become bruised and broken.\n Thinking for a moment, Coleman quietly walked under the tree and stood there silently like a guardian angel.\n Suddenly, Rain called out to him. \u201cColeman.\u201d\n Coleman stared at the ants on the ground. He didn\u2019t look up.\n Rain suddenly said, \u201cI am going to jump down. You must catch me.\u201d\n Only then did Coleman look up and stare at the radiant young woman. He said nothing, but slowly lifted his arms.\n Rain jumped down from the tree and landed firmly in Coleman\u2019s arms. A 40 year old adult man hugging a 19 year old teenage girl was like embracing the sunlight of the world.\n Rain wrapped her arms around Coleman\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019 m sure you didn\u2019t kiss before, Coleman,\u201d she said.\n Coleman nodded. \u201cYes, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n Rain\u2019s feet hit the floor. She stared up at Coleman with a grin. \u201cColeman, I want to kiss you.\u201d\n Coleman said, \u201cYou can.\u201d\n And then they kissed.\n In the entire script, wherever Rain appeared, Coleman would be in a good mood. His eyes would always be able to see Rain. Song Ci could feel Coleman\u2019s fondness for Rain through his words. It was pure and clean.\n Subsequently, when Rain and his elder brother Lyme went out to sea for a holiday, the cruise ship unfortunately sank. Only his elder brother Lyme survived, while Rain disappeared into the sea. Some said that Rain was dead, while others said that Rain must still be alive somewhere in this world.\n Coleman didn\u2019t believe that Rain was already dead. With his love and expectations for Rain, he waited for 35 years without crying or making a fuss. Rain only appeared briefly in Coleman\u2019s life for a year, but stayed in his heart forever.\n Song Ci felt pity for the ending of this couple.\n When Han Zhan returned home and saw Song Ci crying silently while holding the script, he was slightly shocked. \u201cIs it that touching?\u201d Han Zhan snatched the script from Song Ci\u2019s hand. He looked down and saw the full English text, and instantly lost the desire to read it.\n After working for an entire day, Han Zhan felt his head ache when he saw the words, especially in English.\n Song Ci felt embarrassed and hurriedly wiped her tears. She said to Han Zhan, \u201cThis story is rather touching. Brother Han, I feel that humans are such wonderful creatures. Some people walk among the flowers and indulge in debauchery their entire lives. But some people love someone their entire lives.\u201d\n \u201cWe are all humans, but why is there such a huge difference?\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Han Zhan didn\u2019t comment further. He sat down on the floor, stared at the lights outside the window, and asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat does the script for \u2018Le Chi\u2019 say?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s about Coleman\u2019s life, but what moved me to tears was his feelings for Rain.\u201d Song Ci narrated the story of how Coleman and Rain met and fell in love.\n After hearing this, Han Zhan concluded. \u201cPiano and Rain are the lifelong pursuits of Coleman.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly smiled. \u201cAre all you musicians so romantic?\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her nose awkwardly. \u201cNot really. There are also many musicians who are wild and unrestrained in their relationships. They love one after another without resting.\u201d There was still a rest day every week.\n \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cHm? What about me?\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t understand what Han Zhan meant.\n Han Zhan suddenly looked up and stared at Song Ci, his deep blue eyes filled with love and gentleness. \u201cSong Ci, other than the violin, what else is your lifelong pursuit?\u201d Han Zhan raised his hand, pointed at his own chest, and asked her, \u201cAm I fortunate to be your lifelong pursuit?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heartbeat quickened.\n She turned to look elsewhere, her ears slightly red.\n Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s red ears with a smile in his eyes. \u201cI understand.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you understand?\u201d Song Ci turned to ask him.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cBaby Ci likes Brother Han.\u201d\n Song Ci pouted.\n Song Ci was unhappy that Han Zhan state his stance. She glared at him. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Her glare made Han Zhan\u2019s heart itch.\n Han Zhan pinched Song Ci\u2019s feet that were only wearing socks. He tugged at the little ball on the socks and nodded. \u201cMmm, Brother Han also likes Baby Ci.\u201d\n Song Ci felt that it was mushy. She wanted to draw back her feet but was pulled into Han Zhan\u2019s arms, so she slid from the sofa to the floor.\n Han Zhan hugged Song Ci\u2019s waist from behind and said, \u201cThis is our first New Year together. Is there anything you wish to do?\u201d\n After thinking for a moment, Song Ci said, \u201cI will bring you to meet my parents at the end of December.\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n From 16th December onwards, Li Li started preparing for the wedding on leave. Han Zhan and Bei Zhan\u2019s workload increased exponentially and they were extremely busy every day. However, no matter how busy they were, Han Zhan had to return home at night.\n On the 22nd day of the twelfth lunar month, Li Li and Su Beibei\u2019s wedding was held at the Jetta International Hotel as scheduled. As the vice-president of Zeus Corporation, Li Li was very popular in Wangdong City. There were 50 tables set up for the wedding and it was packed to the brim.\n Han Zhan and Song Ci sat at table 1, with Mother Li beside Song Ci. Having worked so hard for so many years, Mother Li\u2019s body was slightly stooped. She was only in her early fifties and already had wrinkles all over her face.\n Everyone was in high spirits at happy times. Mother Li had put on light makeup today and put on the peach-colored gown that Li Li and Su Beibei had chosen for her, and still had decent features, even as she sat beside Song Ci.\n Her son was getting married today and her daughter-in-law was tall, beautiful and talented. Mother Li was overjoyed.\n She grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and smiled at her. \u201cSong Ci, I am so happy today. Our Li Li is finally married. This huge rock that has been weighing on my heart has finally been lifted.\u201d\n It was not easy for Mother Li to raise her child alone. She had been worried that Li Li would never get married. But now, Li Li was married and her daughter-in-law was pregnant. It was understandable that Mother Li was crying with joy.\n Song Ci quickly took a tissue and carefully dabbed at Mrs. Li\u2019s tears. \u201cAuntie, don\u2019t cry. The wedding is about to start. It won\u2019t look good on camera if you cry.\u201d\n \u201cMoreover, marriage is a joyous occasion. You should smile. Stop crying.\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Mother Li stole a glance at the elegantly-dressed guests. Afraid of embarrassing the children, she could only hold back her tears.\n Shortly after, the wedding ceremony started.\n Su Beibei was wearing a white floor-length wedding gown with fresh flowers in her hands. She entered the venue accompanied by two little flower girls. It was the first time Song Ci saw Su Beibei wearing a white dress and she was stunned.\n She glanced at the groom, Li Li, on the stage. As she expected, Li Li also looked stunned.\n Su Beibei\u2019s usual style of dressing was dark, with either black or grey. Occasionally, there would be red, but she had never worn such pure white. Even Han Zhan was surprised to see Su Beibei in this state.\n He whispered to Song Ci. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Su Beibei would look so obedient in a white dress.\u201d She looked like an obedient little girl.\n \u201cClothes make the man.\u201d Song Ci was well-versed in this principle. As a result, she never wore a dress with a baby\u2019s collar because the baby\u2019s collar made her look like a weak and harmless daffodil.\n After the wedding ceremony, the emcee invited Mother Li onto the stage. Hearing Su Beibei call her mother, Mother Li impatiently took out the thick red packet she had prepared earlier and stuffed it into Su Beibei\u2019s hands.\n Song Ci stretched out her hand to compare. It was about the thickness of three of her fingers. She said to Han Zhan, \u201cThe fee that Auntie prepared for Beibei for calling her \u2018mother\u2019 should be at least 20,000 yuan, right?\u201d This money was earned by Mother Li after working hard to kill fish. It was all hard-earned money.\n \u201cProbably.\u201d Han Zhan looked at the harmonious family of three on stage and said, \u201cAunty is a very kind person and knows how to respect others. Su Beibei and Li Li will live peacefully after getting married.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n On the stage, Mrs. Li was invited to sit down on a red wooden chair, while Li Li was holding a piece of paper filled with gratitude.\n \u201cI am very honored that everyone has the time to attend my wedding with Su Beibei despite being so busy. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone present. I would also like to express my gratitude to all my friends who are unable to attend the wedding because of work. Thank you all for giving me your well wishes even if you didn\u2019t come.\u201d\n \u201cMy cell phone has already vibrated several times, even while I\u2019m reciting my thank you notes. I think someone is sending red packets to me!\u201d Li Li was very talkative and funny when he spoke. It made one burst out laughing.\n He grabbed Su Beibei\u2019s hand and recalled his fate with her. Still in disbelief, he said, \u201cI won\u2019t tell you in detail about my love affair with Ms. Su Beibei. It will take at least a day and a night.\u201d\n \u201cBut I have to tell everyone that I love my wife, Su Beibei, very much. Meeting her is the greatest blessing of my life. Beibei, thank you for being willing to appear in my life, fall in love with me, and give me a home that I\u2019ve dreamed of.\u201d\n \u201cThe best thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life was to open XX Bookstore on a sleepless night, see Colonel Beibei\u2019s book, and spend 50,000 yuan to become her fan. 50,000 yuan to bring home a wife\u2014this is a good deal!\u201d\n Upon hearing this, the guests couldn\u2019t help laughing. Even Su Beibei\u2019s shoulders were shaking from laughter. \u201cIn this special occasion, I must thank a mysterious kindhearted person. Without his years of sponsorship, there wouldn\u2019t be this outstanding Li Li in front of you.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, mysterious and kind-hearted person.\u201d\n The kind-hearted Han Zhan was sitting below the stage. Hearing this, he smiled but didn\u2019t say anything, hiding his achievements and fame.\n Only after thanking everyone did Li Li turn around and look at his mother who looked like she was in her early 50s.\n At this special moment, seeing this woman who had devoted half her life to him, even Li Li\u2019s cold and hard chest softened.\n \u201cEveryone only sees Li Li\u2019s excellence, but no one sees you, who has frostbite all over your hands on a snowy day and still has to smile as you kill fish for your guests. It is all thanks to you that I, Li Li, am able to be where I am today.\u201d\n \u201cMother.\u201d Li Li cupped Mother Li\u2019s hands.\n Those hands had black marks, as they were covered in frostbite all year round.\n Looking at his mother\u2019s bruised and battered hands, Li Li\u2019s vision suddenly blurred. \u201cMother, from today onwards, another woman will love me as much as you do. Mother, promise me that you will live the rest of your life for yourself. Our son has already grown up and can support you now.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Mrs. Li burst into tears.\n Li Li also smiled and leaned his forehead against the back of Mrs. Li\u2019s hand. He cried so hard that he couldn\u2019t stand straight.\n Su Beibei was also slightly moved when she saw this. She stood aside and wiped her tears. The emcee hurried onto the stage to persuade the comfort family. Once Li Li and Mother Li calmed down, the banquet officially started.\n As Su Beibei was pregnant, she would drink tea instead of wine.\n The first person they cheered to was Han Zhan\u2019s table. Su Beibei knew that Han Zhan was a kindhearted person who helped Li Li complete his studies and that he had played a major role in Li Li\u2019s success today.\n Su Beibei raised a cup of tea and said to Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, you are the great benefactor of Li Li. I should have given you a toast, but since I am pregnant, I will drink tea instead. Mr. Han, you are a kind person. Good things will always be rewarded, so the heavens sent Song Ci to your side.\u201d\n \u201cI wish you and Song Ci a happy life together!\u201d\n After saying that, Su Beibei took the initiative to drink the tea.\n Han Zhan enjoyed Su Beibei\u2019s blessings. He raised his glass with both hands and finished it. \u201cMs. Su, you\u2019re also very outstanding. It is Li Li\u2019s fortune to be able to marry you.\u201d\n \u201cIn future, if Li Li treats you badly, tell Song Ci. I will beat him up for you.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s eyelids twitched wildly. Did he think I\u2019m a little kid who needed a beating?\n Su Beibei giggled. \u201cThank you, Mr. Han.\u201d\n After the lively wedding ended, Song Ci and Han Zhan didn\u2019t attend the party that night. They drove back to the countryside, planning to visit Song Ci\u2019s parents\u2019 grave tomorrow morning.\n It had been a long time since they stayed in the old house and it was covered in dust. Han Zhan and Song Ci cleaned up the house themselves and laid down clean bedsheets. They then went to the villagers\u2019 house to buy some vegetables and bacon and made dinner for themselves.\n Just as dinner was prepared, there was a sudden knock on the door. Han Zhan put down the plate and asked Song Ci, \u201cWho could it be?\u201d\n Song Ci walked out from the dim light and gave Han Zhan a strange smile. \u201cMy parents are back.\u201d\n Han Zhan was confused.\n A chill ran down his spine.\n Song Ci suddenly smiled mischievously. \u201cIt\u2019s Song Fei.\u201d Song Fei had yet to visit her parents after waking up. \u201cShe knew we were going to visit her parents\u2019 grave and wanted to come with us.\u201d\n It was a false alarm. Han Zhan shook his head helplessly at Song Ci. \u201cDon\u2019t scare me in the future. I\u2019m afraid of ghosts.\u201d\n \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n \u201cReally.\u201d\n Although Han Zhan was tall and strong, he was a coward who was afraid of horror movies and ghost stories.\n When Han Zhan was 12 years old, small movie theater rooms could be seen everywhere on the streets. Once, Han Zhan was really curious and went into a small theater to tell his boss that he wanted to watch the most popular movie.\n As a result, the boss gave Han Zhan a movie about a village with old corpses, the kind that was pirated.\n Han Zhan was a very stubborn person. The more afraid he was, the more he wanted to understand. He was obviously scared to death of ghosts, but he was deeply attracted by the plot that followed and forced himself to sit in the screening room for two hours.\n After the movie ended, Han Zhan\u2019s legs went soft.\n That movie had left a deep psychological scar on Han Zhan, causing his imagination to run wild every time he spent the night at a remote suburb.\n \u201cI\u2019ll open the door!\u201d Song Ci crossed the yard to open the door.\n Outside the house, Song Fei had Yan Jiang\u2019s scarf wrapped around her neck. Her nose had turned red from the cold wind. Song Fei frowned when she saw Song Ci. \u201cYou are a snail. So slow!\u201d\n Song Ci also rolled her eyes impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s already not bad that I opened the door for you, yet you\u2019re complaining. Quickly come in.\u201d\n Song Fei stopped arguing with Song Ci and pulled Yan Jiang into the house.\n Han Zhan saw Song Fei and Yan Jiang enter the house. He instinctively glanced at the ground and saw their shadows. Only then did Han Zhan feel completely at ease.\n \u201cMr. Yan, Sister Fei.\u201d Ever since Song Fei plotted to kill Mu Mian, Han Zhan had to call her elder sister sincerely every time he saw her.\n Song Fei glanced at the table full of food and said, \u201cYan Jiang hasn\u2019t eaten yet.\u201d Song Fei was very calm as she betrayed her man.\n Yan Jiang, who was not hungry, touched his stomach. He looked at the food on the table and said to Han Zhan, \u201cI am so hungry. Mr. Han, do you mind giving us two bowls and chopsticks?\u201d\n Would I dare to say no?\n I...\n \u201cOf course not. I\u2019ll go get a bowl now.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Like Song Ci, Song Fei also liked bacon and sausages very much. The two dishes on the table were almost entirely eaten by the two sisters.\n Han Zhan and Yan Jiang stared at each other and didn\u2019t dare to say anything. After the meal, the two of them still had to roll up their sleeves and wash the dishes without complaints.\n In the living room, the two sisters were gathered together. Song Ci was muttering something to herself. Song Fei played with her cell phone and occasionally replied to Song Ci.\n Holding a cigarette in his mouth, Yan Jiang took a plate with his left hand and a rag with his right, quickly washing the dishes one by one. Hearing Song Ci\u2019s incessant chatter in the living room, Yan Jiang pitied Han Zhan quite a bit. \u201cThe one at your house has never stopped talking the entire day. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s noisy?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI like the atmosphere of the world. It\u2019s heartwarming to have someone to talk to at home.\u201d To be honest, Han Zhan liked Song Ci\u2019s enthusiasm for everything.\n Song Ci was always intrigued by small matters. Han Zhan could feel the beauty of life from her.\n Hearing this, Yan Jiang bit his filter and seemed to smile. He picked up another bowl and washed it twice. Yan Jiang suddenly turned to look at Han Zhan and asked him, \u201cWhy am I the only one scrubbing? Are you going to stand aside and be a human-shaped mold?\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his gloved right hand and shook it innocently. \u201cI am handicapped.\u201d\n Yan Jiang nearly laughed out of anger. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone speak so self-righteously about being handicapped.\u201d Alright, he had his reasons.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong. Recalling something, he asked Yan Jiang, \u201cI heard from Song Ci that you and Song Fei are planning to have a child?\u201d\n Yan Jiang stopped washing the dishes.\n He turned back to sneak a peek at Song Fei. Seeing that the two sisters weren\u2019t paying attention to the commotion in the kitchen, Yan Jiang then said softly to Han Zhan, \u201cShe\u2019s a competitive person who always hopes that our child will be born earlier than yours. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way around this.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei has been in a coma for too many years and is very weak. I went to ask the doctor and he advised her to recuperate for at least another three years before considering giving birth. It will be very detrimental to her health if she gives birth now.\u201d Yan Jiang would never let her have a frail body, as she would easily fall sick.\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d Han Zhan comforted Yan Jiang. \u201cYou guys are still young. It doesn\u2019t matter if you guys wait a few more years.\u201d\n Yan Jiang crushed the cigarette butt with his wet hand and threw it into the dustbin. \u201cOf course. I will only be 27 next month. What\u2019s the hurry? Unlike you, Mr. Han, who is already 33.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s chilly eyes shot straight at Yan Jiang\u2019s face.\n It didn\u2019t matter even if Yan Jiang saw it. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me. It\u2019s useless. My contract with your Aviation Company has expired. You are no longer my sugar daddy. I don\u2019t need to depend on you.\u201d Yan Jiang was beyond arrogant.\n Han Zhan was so angry that he wanted to hit someone, but he controlled himself.\n At night, when they were sleeping, the two of them stood beside their wives in tacit understanding. They were afraid that it would be like the previous time when Song Ci and her sister huddled together in bed to chat, and the two of them would squeeze together in bed to kick each other.\n Song Ci and Song Fei were no longer as intimate as they were during their first reunion. They naturally wouldn\u2019t sleep together at night. Seeing that it was getting late, they both returned to their rooms and went to sleep.\n Before going to bed, Han Zhan told Song Ci that Song Fei was weak and it was not easy for her to get pregnant early. Hearing this, Song Ci heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. She won me in everything when she was young. Now that she is older, the tables have turned.\u201d\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t understand why Song Ci and Song Fei liked to fight to the death.\n The winter nights in the countryside were especially quiet, unlike the chirping of insects in summer. Song Ci switched off the lights. Han Zhan suddenly turned around and pulled her into his arms. Han Zhan\u2019s body was hot, like a huge thermos flask. Song Ci was also very warm in his arms.\n \u201cBrother Han, are you afraid of ghosts?\u201d\n Han Zhan remained silent.\n Song Ci patted the back of Han Zhan\u2019s hand and teased him. \u201cWhat are you afraid of? There are no ghosts in this world.\u201d\n \u201cIf rebirth can happen, why isn\u2019t there a ghost?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s rebirth broke Han Zhan\u2019s worldview.\n Song Ci was speechless. \u201cAlright then, you won\u2019t be afraid if you hug me.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n They had a good night\u2019s sleep.\n The next morning, Song Ci woke up and realized that Han Zhan didn\u2019t go for his morning workout. Instead, he was playing with his cell phone under his blanket. It was cold in the winter and Han Zhan\u2019s breathing was all over the screen.\n When Song Ci woke up, Han Zhan was wiping the screen of his cell phone with the back of his hand.\n Song Ci asked him, \u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d\n \u201cOver 20 minutes.\u201d\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go for your morning exercises?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt\u2019s snowing.\u201d\n \u201cIs it heavy?\u201d Song Ci lifted the blanket and walked to the window. She pushed the window open and a gust of cold air rushed into the room. Han Zhan\u2019s neck quivered from the cold. Song Ci stared at the snow all over the floor and shouted in surprise at the room next door. \u201cSong Fei, get up and build a snowman!\u201d\n In the room next door, Song Fei immediately woke up.\n After waking up, she didn\u2019t even put on her jacket. Wearing her pyjamas, she walked over to the window. Seeing that the ground was covered in snow, Song Fei was also rather agitated. The two sisters loved to play in snow.\n As a result, early in the morning, the two sisters didn\u2019t even eat and just walked into the snow with a shovel. Song Ci didn\u2019t even put on her gloves and just pinched a small round snowball. She placed it on the ground and kept rolling it.\n The snowball got bigger and bigger until it was the head of a snowman.\n Meanwhile, Song Fei had already finished preparing the snowman\u2019s stomach with a metal shovel. Song Ci placed the snowman\u2019s head on the stomach, and an honest-looking snowman was formed. They made the snowman\u2019s eyes and nose, while Song Ci cut it into slices with carrots and made a carrot-colored mouth for it.\n There were four snowmen in total\u2014Song Ci, Song Fei, and their parents. Song Ci\u2019s father loved to wear glasses when he was alive, so Song Fei used a wooden stick to make glasses for him.\n Han Zhan and Yan Jiang finished preparing breakfast and stood under the roof drinking hot tea. Han Zhan looked at the four snowmen and suddenly said, \u201cWe are still short of two.\u201d\n Yan Jiang nodded. \u201cMmm, there are still two more.\u201d\n The two of them put down their drinks, walked up to Song Ci and the rest, took their shovels, and piled a boy on each side of the two little girls. Han Zhan was thoughtful and even let the boy hold the girl\u2019s hand, saying that they were a couple.\n Song Fei stared at the two snowmen holding hands and snorted disdainfully. She then said,\n \u201cSo coquettish.\u201d\n With that, Song Fei pulled Song Ci into the house for breakfast.\n Han Zhan stared at the snowman he made and didn\u2019t find it slutty at all. However, he couldn\u2019t refute his sister\u2019s claim.\n After breakfast, the four of them each carried a basket of offerings and went up the mountain to pay respects to Father Song and Mother Song. Their graves were close together and there were no photos on the tombstone. Their names were written on it.\n Jiang Mengmeng and Song Tingyun.\n ]Han Zhan stared at Jiang Mengmeng and Song Chengyun\u2019s names, his eyes flashing.\n Yan Jiang secretly told Han Zhan, \u201cAuntie Jiang is very beautiful. In the past, in our community, whether it was married or unmarried uncles and brothers, when they saw Auntie Jiang, they didn\u2019t dare to speak too loudly.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, Auntie Jiang was the public enemy of all the women in the neighborhood. But Auntie Jiang was especially good at socializing and treated everyone well. Knowing that she was very pretty, Auntie Jiang usually dressed very plainly. Only then did those women accommodate Auntie Jiang.\u201d\n \u201cWhen we were young, my mother always said that Auntie Jiang was a vixen and a femme fatale. Actually, I know very well that my mother was jealous of her.\u201d\n Han Zhan had never seen Jiang Mengmeng before, but from the way Song Ci and Song Fei behaved, he could tell that Jiang Mengmeng was definitely a very charming beauty.\n The grave had not been cleaned for a long time. The four of them worked together to clean up the area, burn paper money and ingots, and then kowtowed. Song Ci and Song Fei both knelt down. Yan Jiang, the lackey, also knelt down. He couldn\u2019t wait to call her mother.\n Han Zhan stared at Jiang Mengmeng\u2019s name and just stood there without kneeling.\n After Song Ci finished kowtowing, she turned around and saw Han Zhan still standing there, staring at her parents\u2019 tombstones in a daze. He didn\u2019t look like he was going to kneel down. Song Ci felt slightly unhappy. She thought to herself, I\u2019ve already knelt down to your grandmother, but you didn\u2019t kneel down to my parents. What kind of logic was this?\n Song Ci suppressed the unhappiness in her heart and asked Han Zhan calmly, \u201cBrother Han, aren\u2019t you going to kowtow to them? They are also your parents.\u201d After asking, there was a tinge of anger in her eyes but she didn\u2019t vent it out in public.\n Sensing the change in Song Ci\u2019s mood, Han Zhan felt slightly conflicted.\n Kneeling before Jiang Mengmeng...\n Han Zhan glanced at Song Ci. In the end, he still took a step forward and knelt down. Han Zhan kowtowed a few times to Song Chengyun before standing up. Seeing that Song Ci\u2019s eyes were still ablaze, Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cMy knee joint hurts.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned. \u201cWhy does your joints still ache?\u201d\n Han Zhan lied. \u201cIn the past, when I was in the military, I had to lie on the ground to train under the snow. Now that the weather is cold, my joints ache.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart ached slightly for Han Zhan, and she felt even more guilty for misunderstanding him just now. \u201cThen go back quickly. The house is warm.\u201d\n On the way home, Song Ci had to carefully hold on to Han Zhan when they encountered a downhill road, treating him like a fragile vase.\n Yan Jiang and Song Fei were walking in front. Seeing the two coquettish people behind them, he complained to Song Fei. \u201cLook at Han Zhan\u2019s pretentious manner. Isn\u2019t he a man?\u201d\n \u201cI am different. I can walk like...\u201d In order to show his strong physique, Yan Jiang lifted his leg and kicked ahead. But the snow under his feet was too slippery and he just sat down.\n \u201c...I\u2019m flying!\u201d\n He was running as fast as he could, but he had fallen.\n The way he fell was very comical. Song Fei couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. \u201cGet up.\u201d\n Yan Jiang remembered, but...\n He looked up and his face was slightly pale. He said to Song Fei, \u201cMy butt hurts so much and I can\u2019t get up. Wait for me to recover.\u201d\n Song Fei was speechless.\n Han Zhan and Song Ci caught up to him. Han Zhan looked down at the comical man on the ground and praised him. \u201cMr. Yan, your landing position is very handsome.\u201d\n Yan Jiang ignored Han Zhan completely.\n Only when Yan Jiang recovered did the four of them return home. Once they reached home, Yan Jiang had just stepped into the house when he heard Song Fei say, \u201cGo upstairs and take off your pants for me to see.\u201d\n Everyone in the room was shocked.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s face reddened. He asked Song Fei softly, \u201cAh Fei, why are you like this?\u201d He was not used to being so wild.\n Song Ci snapped out of her trance and looked down on Yan Jiang. \u201cBe more normal. Song Fei wanted you to go upstairs and take off your pants so that she can see your bruises.\u201d\n Yan Jiang felt even more embarrassed at her explanation.\n Yan Jiang followed Song Fei back to their room. She had taken off his pants and laid down on the bed. Song Fei looked at his buttocks. They were bruised. Song Fei pulled the blanket over Yan Jiang. She said, \u201cYou rest first. I will go to the neighbor\u2019s house to ask if there is any red flower oil.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After about 10 minutes, Song Fei returned to the room with a bottle of red flower oil. Yan Jiang had already fallen asleep. He woke up again the moment Song Fei lifted the blanket. \u201cHow did I fall asleep?\u201d Yan Jiang felt that something was off.\n Song Fei said, \u201cPerhaps my father despises you, so he manipulated the bed.\u201d As expected of biological sisters, they spoke the same language.\n However, Yan Jiang was not afraid of ghosts. The scariest ghost he had ever seen was his grandmother. All these years, he had often dreamed of his grandmother turning into a malicious ghost, so Yan Jiang was no longer afraid of other ghosts.\n He said, \u201cThe psychiatrist told me that there are no ghosts in this world. The grandmother I saw was just a scary memory.\u201d\n \u201cHa...\u201d\n Song Fei unscrewed the cap and smacked Yan Jiang\u2019s bottom.\n Only a massage could fully bring out the effects of the medicine. Song Fei used too much strength and Yan Jiang cried out in pain. Song Ci and Han Zhan heard Yan Jiang\u2019s screams downstairs and their scalps went numb.\n At this moment, the middle-aged woman next door knocked and asked Song Ci to tutor her grandson.\n \u201cMy son and his wife are still working in the city and will only be back on the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month. My grandson is staying here alone. He is doing a Mathematics paper today and discovered that he doesn\u2019t know how to do two of the questions. His grandfather and I are both boorish people and don\u2019t know how to do Mathematics questions. Since you are back, I would like to invite you over to help him with his homework.\u201d\n The middle-aged woman next door was very warm-hearted. Yesterday, when Song Ci had just returned, she had taken the initiative to send over sausages and bacon.\n Since Song Ci had nothing to do, she agreed.\n \u201cBrother Han, are you going?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t like to go to strangers\u2019 houses, much less to tutor unfamiliar children. He said, \u201cLet me send you there.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n Han Zhan sent Song Ci to the house next door. Upon seeing the other party\u2019s grandson, he greeted the child and returned. He gave the child an advanced red packet for the new year and went home.\n As he walked home through the thick snow, his feet made crunching sounds. Walking under a pine tree, Han Zhan suddenly stopped and squinted at the girl in the middle of the road ahead.\n The knitted cap was covering Song Fei\u2019s short hair, revealing a pair of beautiful, cold eyes. She looked at Han Zhan with an extremely cold expression. Han Zhan was somewhat surprised to see Song Fei here.\n Song Fei was truly the smartest and scariest woman Han Zhan had ever met. She was even more frightening than the female criminals he had encountered in the past.\n After pondering for a moment, Han Zhan walked up, stood in front of Song Fei, looked down at her, and called out, \u201cSister Fei.\u201d\n Song Fei looked up at Han Zhan.\n He\u2019s handsome and steady, a dependable and outstanding man. Song Ci and Han Zhan are a match made in heaven. At least, Song Fei had always thought so until this morning.\n But...\n \u201cHan Zhan, do you know my mother?\u201d Although she was asking, Song Fei\u2019s tone was full of certainty.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "201": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-202\n\n Chapter 201: Slapping Han Zhan  Han Zhan\u2019s pupils quivered slightly. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Although he had already guessed the reason why Song Fei was specially waiting here, Han Zhan was still slightly shocked to hear this from Song Fei.\n This person is really smart.\n Song Fei stared at Han Zhan\u2019s knee joint. She totally didn\u2019t believe what Han Zhan said to Song Ci this morning. \u201cArthralgia is just a reason for you to brush Song Ci off. You just won\u2019t kneel down and kowtow to my parents. Your eyes tell me that you really don\u2019t like our mother. You must know our mother.\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s insight was truly astonishing. Han Zhan thought of denying it and lying, but in the end, he still decided to treat Song Fei honestly. It was all because Song Fei was Song Ci\u2019s family.\n \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Fei\u2019s gaze on him deepened. \u201cHow did you know her?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sister Fei, I don\u2019t wish to lie to you, but I don\u2019t wish to speak of this for now.\u201d\n \u201cOh, you don\u2019t wish to say...\u201d Song Fei sized Han Zhan up with a scrutinizing gaze. Han Zhan allowed her to look at him as she wished, but his expression remained calm and composed, not looking like he had any ulterior motives.\n After a while, Song Fei looked away and took out a small black pill from her pocket.\n Song Fei played with that little pill like a little kid playing with marbles. Han Zhan stared at the black pill in Song Fei\u2019s hand and narrowed his eyes. His intuition told him that this pill was not something good.\n As they played, Song Fei said, \u201cAnyone who has seen my mother will know that we sisters look almost exactly the same as my mother. You hate my mother, but married Song Ci who looks just like my mother...\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan, what are your motives?\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned slightly and was about to explain, when he suddenly saw Song Fei raise her right hand and throw that black pill into her neighbor\u2019s chicken coop.\n Han Zhan turned to look and saw a plume of smoke rising from the spot where the pill had landed. Within seconds, three to four chickens had collapsed to the ground, struggling for their lives.\n Upon seeing this, Han Zhan\u2019s pupils constricted!\n Song Fei\u2019s cold voice reached Han Zhan\u2019s ear. \u201cHan Zhan, you\u2019re not allowed to harm my sister. If I find out that you have ulterior motives toward my sister, I don\u2019t care who your grandfather or your godmothers are\u2014I can make you a pile of ashes in a jar!\u201d\n Song Fei said that she would turn Han Zhan into ashes, so she really had the capability to do so.\n Look, weren\u2019t those chickens the best example?\n Suppressing the tumultuous waves in his heart, Han Zhan told Song Fei, \u201cI really don\u2019t have any ulterior motives towards Song Ci. I\u2019ve never thought of harming Song Ci. You don\u2019t have to worry about this, Song Fei.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s voice was soft, afraid of angering this dangerous person who would explode the society at the drop of a hat.\n Song Fei snorted. \u201cIt better be.\u201d She turned and left.\n Han Zhan stared at the few chickens lying on the floor in the chicken coop. He hesitated for a moment, before slowly walking back to Song Ci\u2019s house.\n Yan Jiang stood by the window upstairs and observed the scene on the snow just now. He felt puzzled. What was Ah Fei and Han Zhan talking about behind me and Song Ci\u2019s back? Why did Han Zhan anger Song Fei?\n At 11pm, Song Ci returned from her neighbor\u2019s house with a bag of farm produce. There was dried bacon, sausages, and salted duck eggs. Song Ci entered the house and placed the items on the table. She found two bags and planned to pack them up separately for Song Fei and Yan Jiang.\n Han Zhan had work and was working in a room upstairs. Song Fei didn\u2019t like to cook, so she sat on the sofa and read the latest literature thesis published in the Lancets Magazine. Meanwhile, Yan Jiang, who was once the most handsome man in the entertainment industry, could only enter the kitchen and put on an apron to cook.\n Song Ci said to Song Fei and Yan Jiang, \u201cIt\u2019s strange. A few chickens suddenly died in Auntie Zhu\u2019s house next door. Auntie Zhu was so scared that she thought they had contracted the plague and even called a vet over.\u201d\n Yan Jiang shot Song Fei a meaningful look.\n Song Fei didn\u2019t even look up. \u201cThey might have died from the cold.\u201d\n Song Ci was surprised. \u201cA chicken can die from the cold?\u201d\n Song Fei said expressionlessly, \u201cIf a person can die from the cold, why can\u2019t a chicken? Have you forgotten that the little girl selling matchsticks froze to death?\u201d\n Song Ci still didn\u2019t believe Song Fei. \u201cI think it might be the chicken plague.\u201d Song Ci packed the food and shouted upstairs. \u201cBrother Han, what do you want to eat? I\u2019ll make it for you.\u201d\n Han Zhan walked out of the bedroom, stood in the corridor, and replied, \u201cHot and sour shredded potato, slightly spicy.\u201d\n \u201cSo sour and spicy. Are you pregnant?\u201d Song Ci muttered but still went into the kitchen to make spicy shredded potato.\n Song Ci continued peeling the potato. Yan Jiang stared at the dried beef in the pan. He turned to look at Song Ci several times, but hesitated. He wanted to tell her what he saw today.\n But Song Fei purposely avoided Song Ci and Han Zhan meeting in private because she didn\u2019t want Song Ci to know about this. As a result, Yan Jiang was very conflicted. Should I tell Song Ci about this?\n \u201cWhy are you always looking at me?\u201d Song Ci turned and glanced at Yan Jiang. \u201cLook at your food and don\u2019t mess it up. If you keep staring at me, I\u2019ll tell Song Fei.\u201d\n Yan Jiang poured some water into the pot. The dried beef would taste even better after being cooked for a while longer.\n The last time Han Zhan and Song Fei conspired to harm Mu Mian, they had really deceived Yan Jiang. Yan Jiang could understand the feeling of being kept in the dark. Yan Jiang and Song Ci were brothers in distress and they were very close. In the end, Yan Jiang still felt that he should tell Song Ci.\n Yan Jiang turned and leaned against the counter. \u201cSong Song.\u201d\n Song Ci threw the potato into the pot, picked up the second peeled potato, and grunted without looking up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Yan Jiang decided to test Song Ci first and asked, \u201cIs Song Fei and Han Zhan hiding something from you?\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly stopped peeling the potato. She glanced back at Song Fei and saw that she was reading the thesis intently. She approached Yan Jiang and asked, \u201cYou also noticed it?\u201d\n Also?\n Yan Jiang was shocked. \u201cYou know? Hey, I thought you didn\u2019t know. I was hesitating over whether to tell you about this.\u201d Seeing that Song Ci knew, Yan Jiang didn\u2019t have to worry anymore and told her what he saw this morning.\n \u201cI only discovered it today. Didn\u2019t Han Zhan send you to tutor that little kid next door this afternoon? He was stopped by Ah Fei on the way home.\u201d\n Song Ci said calmly, \u201cI noticed long ago that they had secretly gathered together to speak. I was afraid that they were plotting something again. Did you hear what they said today?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what they said either. I just saw Ah Fei suddenly throw a poison pill at the chicken coop. Several chickens fell to the ground and died. Man, my heart nearly stopped beating when I saw that scene upstairs.\u201d\n Hearing that those chickens were poisoned to death by Song Fei, Song Ci was enraged. \u201cHow can Song Fei be like this! She poisoned someone else\u2019s chickens just like that, how can we face Auntie Zhu in future!\u201d\n Seeing that Song Ci was angry, Yan Jiang hurriedly said, \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t really angry, Ah Fei definitely wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u201d He asked Song Ci, \u201cDo you know how Han Zhan managed to provoke Ah Fei?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cHow would I know?\u201d\n \u201cI thought you knew...\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t realize anything. I was actually lying to you when I told you that I saw them talking privately.\u201d She didn\u2019t expect Yan Jiang to be so gullible.\n Previously, when Song Ci came back from Auntie Zhu\u2019s house, she saw the footprints of Han Zhan and Song Fei on the snow and knew that they had met privately. She was troubled over not knowing what those two had done in private, and Yan Jiang delivered the information himself.\n Realizing that Song Ci was purposely misleading him so that he could tell her everything, Yan Jiang once again realized how evil Song Ci was. \u201cSong Ci, you are too cunning. How could you lie to me!\u201d Yan Jiang regretted knowing this little liar.\n Song Ci snorted. \u201cIf a woman isn\u2019t cunning, how can she rule the world?\u201d With that, Song Ci tossed the potato aside and hurried into the living room.\n Song Ci crossed her arms and stood beside the sofa. She looked down at Song Fei. \u201cSong Fei, come out.\u201d\n Song Fei opened her eyes and glanced at Song Ci nonchalantly. Seeing that Song Ci looked like she was about to get angry, she slowly stood up and shuffled out after Song Ci.\n Yan Jiang felt a headache coming on upon seeing this. Afraid that the two sisters would start fighting outside, he hurriedly turned off the fire and ran out.\n Yan Jiang was hiding under the door and overheard their conversation.\n \u201cHow did Han Zhan offend you? Why are you scaring him like that?\u201d It was Song Ci\u2019s voice.\n Song Fei asked, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d After thinking for a moment, Song Fei guessed the crux of the matter. \u201cDid Yan Jiang tell you?\u201d My own man is siding with someone else\u2014he\u2019s asking for it.\n Song Ci was like an old hen protecting her cubs. She looked fiercely at Song Fei for an explanation. \u201cDon\u2019t care who told me. Just tell me, how did Han Zhan upset you? He is my man. It\u2019s fine if you bully me, but why did you bully my man? Song Fei, speak clearly. Don\u2019t bully him behind my back.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Fei scolded Song Ci. \u201cAre you an idiot?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYou always call me a little dumbass. Even the smartest person will be called dumb by you.\u201d\n Song Fei was speechless and helpless. \u201cIdiot, can\u2019t you tell that Han Zhan knows our mother?\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci asked her instead, \u201cWhy do you think Han Zhan knows our mother?\u201d\n Song Fei was disappointed at the ignorant Song Ci.\n How could I have such a stupid little sister? Eyes are such a good thing but she only used them to flirt.\n Song Fei told Song Ci, \u201cToday, when we went to our parents\u2019 grave, I noticed that Han Zhan looked at our mother\u2019s name with disgust and conflict. This means that Han Zhan very likely knows our mother. Even if he doesn\u2019t know him personally, he knows our mother! There should be some enmity between him and our mother!\u201d\n \u201cMoreover, we sisters look very much like our mother. Han Zhan obviously hates our mother very much but he married you. Don\u2019t you think this is suspicious?\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, don\u2019t you understand? I was afraid that he married you because he had ulterior motives. I was worried that he would hurt you, so I went behind your back to ask him for an explanation!\u201d But my good intentions were misinterpreted by Song Ci.\n This fool even came to seek justice for Han Zhan!\n What a silly girl!\n Love-struck fool!\n After hearing Song Fei\u2019s explanation, Song Ci didn\u2019t look shocked or surprised.\n Seeing this, Song Fei couldn\u2019t help stealing a few more glances at her. Thinking about why Song Ci was so calm, Song Fei\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t help turning solemn. \u201cDid you already know?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cYes. I noticed something was off long ago.\u201d\n Song Fei was slightly shocked. \u201cYou actually knew...\u201d Song Fei was in disbelief that Song Ci could discover this herself. She didn\u2019t know that Song Ci had brains.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI am not really blind. I can tell some things.\u201d This morning at her parents\u2019 grave, Song Ci noticed that Han Zhan\u2019s expression was slightly off when he looked at her mother\u2019s name.\n Song Ci also told Song Fei, \u201cActually, I already realized that there was a problem. The previous time I went back to Hunan with Han Zhan, I saw a photo of Han Zhan\u2019s mother. Sister, when Han Zhan\u2019s mother smiles, she looks especially like our mother. Is this a coincidence?\u201d\n Song Ci felt slightly uneasy. She asked Song Fei, \u201cElder sister, don\u2019t you think this matter is very strange?\u201d\n \u201cHow so?\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan told me that his father was a drug lord and his mother was just one of his father\u2019s lovers. He said that his father had a first love who couldn\u2019t be loved. As he couldn\u2019t get that woman, he found many other lovers who were similar to that woman... Today, when I saw Han Zhan looking at our mother\u2019s name on her grave, I thought...\u201d\n Song Ci stopped and stared at Song Fei uneasily. She bit her lips and said in a low voice, \u201cI was thinking if our mother is the first love of that drug lord!\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s that person\u2019s name? Han Zhan\u2019s father.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Song Ci shook her head and said, \u201cHan Zhan never told me his father\u2019s exact identity. I only know that he is a major drug lord. But this is just my guess. Only Han Zhan himself knows the truth.\u201d\n Song Fei frowned, feeling that Han Zhan was really troublesome. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have married him!\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t say that. In that situation, the only person who can help me and know my roots is Han Zhan. Moreover...\u201d Song Ci suddenly smiled and told Song Fei honestly,\u201d It\u2019s quite funny. I married him because I wanted to use him, but I seem to have really fallen in love with him. \u201d\n Song Fei gritted her teeth in exasperation.\n Hearing the sudden sound of footsteps in the house, those footsteps stopped after reaching the door. Song Fei smiled and asked Song Ci with a cold face, \u201cLittle fool, aren\u2019t you worried that Han Zhan has ulterior motives for marrying you? Aren\u2019t you afraid that he will harm you?\u201d\n After thinking for a moment, Song Ci said, \u201cI am afraid too.\u201d\n \u201cBut even if he had ulterior motives in marrying me, what he has done for me these few months is real. His love and concern for me are also genuine.\u201d Song Ci could tell whether Han Zhan was truly devoted to her.\n \u201cIf Han Zhan really wanted to make use of me and hurt me, I wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to join in and be used by him.\u201d Song Ci smiled openly, with a sense of ease and fearlessness. \u201cI, Song Ci, am not the kind of woman who can\u2019t live without a man. If Han Zhan betrays me, I can just give him up and live my single life?\u201d\n Mu Mian was already dead and Song Ci was no longer in danger. She really didn\u2019t feel any pressure now. \u201cActually, I\u2019m waiting for the day Han Zhan takes the initiative to tell me the truth.\u201d Song Ci had long seen through Han Zhan\u2019s many secrets. She was waiting for the day Han Zhan took the initiative to tell her.\n If she continued to wait, there would only be two outcomes. Either Han Zhan would come clean, or Song Ci would be disheartened.\n Song Fei asked again, \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t say anything?\u201d\n Song Ci narrowed her eyes and stared at the messy footprints in the snow. Her expression turned cold. \u201cWhat else do I want from a man who doesn\u2019t really care about me?\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s expression softened slightly. \u201cMmm, that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n Inside the house, Yan Jiang turned and saw Han Zhan standing behind him with a dark expression. He raised his brows in surprise. When did this guy come? Patting Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder, Yan Jiang asked him in a low voice, \u201cShall we go to the backyard for a chat?\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at the sisters on the roof, nodded, and followed Yan Jiang out of the living room to the backyard.\n Song Fei\u2019s ears twitched as she heard their footsteps fade into the distance. She told Song Ci, \u201cIt\u2019s cold outside, go in.\u201d After lying in bed for eight years, Song Fei was used to using her ears to listen to everything.\n Just now when she was talking to Song Ci, Song Fei noticed that Han Zhan had come downstairs. She purposely asked Song Ci those questions in front of Han Zhan so that she could give Han Zhan a wake-up call and let him hear Song Ci\u2019s heartfelt words.\n Luckily, Song Ci was also supportive and her words satisfied Song Fei. As for what choice Han Zhan would make, Song Fei didn\u2019t care.\n \u2013\n Arriving at the backyard, Yan Jiang took out his cigarette case and took out a cigarette from the side. Before Yan Jiang could bite that cigarette, Han Zhan dashed out and snatched it away.\n Yan Jiang glared at him.\n Han Zhan bit his cigarette and lit it. Before he could take a puff, he heard Yan Jiang say softly, \u201cAren\u2019t you guys preparing for pregnancy?\u201d Han Zhan was stunned for a moment, before hurriedly taking the cigarette away from his teeth and pinching it with his hands without smoking it.\n Yan Jiang was also smart. After hearing the conversation between the two sisters, he guessed that Han Zhan had many secrets.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t have the habit of prying into other people\u2019s secrets. He patted Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder and told him, \u201cMr. Han, listen to my advice. Be honest and speak your mind. Only then will your relationship last longer. Some secrets are like a thorn buried in your flesh. Even if it\u2019s absorbed by your flesh, there will still be a knot.\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned and remained silent.\n Yan Jiang added. \u201cI know Song Song very well. She is willing to give you a chance. When you take the initiative to confess, you must cherish it. You must understand that there is a limit to her waiting.\u201d\n There were almost no secrets between Yan Jiang and Song Ci. Yan Jiang also knew all the reasons and transactions between Han Zhan and Song Ci. He had to remind Han Zhan. \u201cMr. Han, don\u2019t forget that you and Song Ci still have a one-year promise.\u201d\n Han Zhan froze.\n His eyes widened slightly.\n Recalling Song Ci\u2019s words to Song Fei just now, Han Zhan felt a lingering fear. During this period, Song Ci had always called him Brother Han in a soft, sweet voice, made him laugh, fooled around with him, and cried unbridledly in front of him, so he felt like Song Ci had no choice but to marry him.\n In reality, how could Song Ci be that kind of weak little girl? She, Song Ci, had been fighting wits and courage with a domineering man for six years. A woman who dared to stab someone in the gut!\n She loved him and was willing to be the little woman in his arms. If her heart turned cold, he would never be able to touch her.\n Han Zhan was so scared that his eyelashes were trembling.\n Yan Jiang continued. \u201cDon\u2019t think that just because she wants to have a child with you, she really has to have you. Song Song is capable and talented. Even if she has your child in her womb, she will still have the guts to divorce you if something really happens to your relationship.\u201d\n \u201cShe is not a parasite attached to you. She can leave whenever she wants.\u201d Having said that, Yan Jiang stopped talking.\n After hearing Yan Jiang\u2019s words, Han Zhan imagined some more scenarios and broke out in a cold sweat. He suddenly came to his senses. It turned out that hiding or not telling the truth was also a form of hurt and distrust towards one\u2019s partner.\n \u201cI know what to do now.\u201d Han Zhan tilted his head and gave Yan Jiang\u2019s shoulder a hard knock. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang waved his hand. \u201cWe are family.\u201d\n \u201cYes, family.\u201d\n The two of them stood outside for a while, before turning to enter the house. All four of them had ulterior motives and pretended like nothing had happened. After dinner, they loaded their belongings into the car and prepared to return to the city.\n Worried that there would be ice on the roads after the snow, Han Zhan put chains on the tires. On the way back to the city, the car drove rather slowly. Song Ci occasionally chatted with Han Zhan, her usual tone no different from usual.\n Han Zhan suddenly realized that Song Ci was also good at pretending.\n It was already dark by the time they reached home.\n Han Zhan took the initiative to take over the responsibility of cooking and didn\u2019t allow Song Ci to enter the kitchen. He fiddled around in the kitchen for a while and made a home-cooked dinner. Song Ci ate Han Zhan\u2019s meal and seemed to be in a good mood.\n After dinner, Song Ci turned on the television and watched a television drama.\n She stared at the television, but her heart was racing.\n Song Ci only turned to look at Han Zhan, when the sofa beside her lunged and the scent of Han Zhan\u2019s cold wood perfume wafted into her nose. Seeing that his hair and cheeks were all wet, Song Ci said, \u201cYou washed your hair?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci bent over and retrieved the hairdryer from the television cabinet. Song Ci patted her own leg and said to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, bend over.\u201d\n Han Zhan bent over and let Song Ci dry his hair.\n Song Ci\u2019s fingers ran through Han Zhan\u2019s hair. Han Zhan\u2019s scalp went numb. He felt comfortable and at ease. After drying his hair, Han Zhan didn\u2019t sit up straight and just laid sideways on the sofa, resting his head on Song Ci\u2019s lap.\n Song Ci looked at the television and stroked Han Zhan\u2019s nose and eyes from time to time.\n \u201cSong Ci.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s voice sounded very serious, without the usual warmth and gentleness.\n Song Ci blinked and turned off the television. She looked down at Han Zhan\u2019s struggling and hesitating eyes. \u201cDo you have something to say to me?\u201d\n Han Zhan met her eyes, and his flickering gaze revealed his uneasiness. \u201cSong Ci, can I tell you my story?\u201d\n Song Ci leaned back against the sofa and gazed at the ceiling. Her throat moved. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan closed his eyes and sank into his memories. He spoke slowly and tirelessly \u2014\n \u201cMy mother gave birth to me as an unmarried woman. After giving birth to me, she left me at my grandmother\u2019s house. She returned to school to take the assessment and was determined to become an excellent military pilot. When I was 2 years old, I unfortunately went missing. My mother and grandfather searched for me for several years, but at that time, China was not like the current China. The surveillance system was far from perfect.\u201d\n \u201cThey searched for me for a long time but didn\u2019t manage to find me. I was still a toddler then and had already lost that memory. I also heard these things from grandma, but I still remember some of what happened after I was stolen.\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly asked, \u201cThe person who stole you is your father?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n My father\u2019s name is Edward Clooney. He is an Italian. You might not know his name, but you must have heard of the major crimes he committed.\u201d Han Zhan casually mentioned several major events. Song Ci was shocked to learn that those were all crimes she had seen on the news.\n Song Ci could already imagine how vicious and cunning Edward was.\n \u201cAfter I was taken away by my father, I was forced to undergo the same miserable and inhumane education in their family. In order to make me immune to all poisons, my father injected me with all sorts of poisons from a young age, turning me into a poisonous human. When I was four years old, I had to complete the family\u2019s baptismal ritual. I still remember how that boy whom I harmed looked like...\u201d\n Song Ci realized that Han Zhan, who was calm and composed in the face of any major incident, was actually trembling in fear at this moment.\n \u201cWe have a total of four brothers and sisters. I have an elder brother above me, and a younger sister and a younger brother below me. Among the four of us, only the eldest is the most doted on by Father. The eldest always calls him by his\u2019 son \u2018. To us, he just calls us by our names.\u201d\n The last time they came back from Brunei, Han Zhan had told Song Ci about his siblings on the plane. Hearing this, Song Ci made a bold guess. \u201cCould your elder brother be the child of your father\u2019s first love?\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly opened his eyes and nodded at Song Ci. \u201cYes.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear to think about how the other three children would react every time they saw their father looking at their eldest son with love and satisfaction, but showing no concern for them. They must be very disappointed, right? How could they not be? They are all children, but why are they being bullied like animals while the eldest son received all their father\u2019s love?\n \u201cWhen I found out that my little sister and brother and I were only the children of my father\u2019s mistresses, while big brother was the child of my father\u2019s first love, I hated big brother\u2019s mother very much. I strongly believe that the pain of us three brothers and sister were all caused by that woman.\u201d\n \u201cIf not for that woman, Father wouldn\u2019t have found so many stand-in lovers! If not for that stand-in lover, we wouldn\u2019t even exist and wouldn\u2019t have to endure all those hardships! At that time, I was only five or six years old and hated living. I always dreamed of dying so that I could leave.\u201d\n Song Ci was terrified.\n Her heart ached slightly for Han Zhan at that time.\n Han Zhan lifted his right hand and stroked Song Ci\u2019s cheek through the glove. His eyes gradually lost focus.\n Han Zhan\u2019s voice was intermittent. \u201cYou really look like her.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart quivered slightly. \u201cLike who?\u201d That ridiculous guess in her heart became clearer and clearer.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t answer Song Ci\u2019s question. Instead, he said, \u201cFather\u2019s room was filled with photos of that woman. There was her smiling face, her playing the piano, and her throwing a tantrum. I barged into Father\u2019s room by mistake and saw all sorts of photos of women in the room. I felt especially scared then. It was as if I had entered a secret room and was being stared at by countless identical faces\u2014some happy, some sad, some crying, some laughing. I was so scared that my hair stood on end!\u201d\n \u201cFather was very angry when he discovered that I had barged into his room. He gave me a good beating and that vicious beating left me lying on the bed for a week. Due to the deep pain, I had a very deep impression of that woman. It was only when I grew up that I found out her identity and her name.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it called?\u201d Song Ci asked impatiently.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cJiang Shiyu.\u201d\n Song Ci heaved a sigh of relief. She thought that her mother\u2019s name was Jiang Mengmeng and her previous guesses were all wrong.\n Han Zhan saw Song Ci\u2019s assured expression and frowned. \u201cSong Ci, do you know? Half a year ago, you went to Zeus for an interview. The first time I saw you, I felt that you were very familiar.\u201d\n Song Ci still remembered what happened on the interview day. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhy familiar? Could it be because I look like your mother?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Han Zhan shook his head and said, \u201cOn the way home, I kept thinking where exactly did I see you. After returning home, I vaguely guessed your identity and went to look for my mother\u2019s photo. Staring at my mother\u2019s appearance, I finally understand why you give me a sense of familiarity. It\u2019s because you...\u201d\n Han Zhan covered his eyes with his arm and sighed. \u201cYour face is the source of my pain.\u201d\n Song Ci felt as if she had been electrocuted and was losing consciousness.\n She gradually regained her senses and asked Han Zhan with a trembling voice, \u201cMy mother... My mother, Jiang Mengmeng, is your father\u2019s first love. Am I right?\u201d\n Instead of answering Song Ci directly, Han Zhan sat up and stared at the dark grey ground. He suddenly said, \u201cJiang Mengmeng, original name Jiang Shiyu, British Chinese. Her brother\u2019s name is Jiang Shifeng, current top pianist of the Angel Orchestra.\u201d\n Turning to stare at the stunned Song Ci, Han Zhan shattered all the hopes in Song Ci\u2019s heart. \u201cSong Ci, do you understand? Your mother, Jiang Mengmeng, is my father\u2019s first love! Because of her, my mother, and Aaron\u2019s mother have all become innocent scapegoats!\u201d\n Han Zhan clutched at his own hair in pain. He was like a wild beast that had fallen into a trap, unable to find an exit.\n Han Zhan murmured in pain. \u201cI know your mother didn\u2019t do anything wrong. My father should be the one being stabbed to death! But Song Ci, I hate your mother too much!\u201d\n \u201cDo you still remember? In the hospital, when I treated you as a spy and grabbed your neck, I really wanted to kill you! But when you begged me to collaborate with you and let me marry you, an evil thought surfaced in my mind...\u201d\n That thought was too despicable. Han Zhan was extremely ashamed and actually didn\u2019t have the courage to continue.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart was also in a mess. Hearing this, she suddenly roared. \u201cContinue! You dare to do it but don\u2019t dare to say it?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s spirits were agitated at Song Ci\u2019s shout.\n He looked at Song Ci uneasily and said in a small voice, \u201cI was thinking that I could marry you and treat you better, like boiling a frog with warm water, so that you could completely drown in my gentle arms.\u201d\n \u201cI will bring you to see my father when you are utterly in love with me. I want to show him that the woman he loves but cannot have\u2014she has already married another man and had a child with him! I want to show him that his life is a joke!\u201d\n Song Ci looked calm.\n Instead of being alarmed, she asked calmly, \u201cThen have you never thought that when I find out the truth, I will also be sad and upset? Have you never thought that your father might kill me in a fit of anger? And that little brother of yours called Aaron\u2014he wants to kill me more than anyone!\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s three questions rendered Han Zhan speechless.\n Song Ci thought of something else. She said, \u201cThat night after we registered our marriage, we went to a restaurant in Deep Alley for a meal. On the streets, I cried bitterly because I was feeling aggrieved. When you hugged me to comfort me, you said that you married me for another reason...\u201d\n Song Ci clearly remembered Han Zhan\u2019s original words. He said,\n [Song Ci, how did you know that you schemed to get close to me and I didn\u2019t have any ulterior motives for keeping you?]\n [Don\u2019t feel sorry for me. Please make good use of me.]\n \u201cActually, everything you said back then was true. However, you didn\u2019t want my looks and body. You wanted my face and my identity as Jiang Shiyu\u2019s daughter! You wanted me to make good use of you not because you were magnanimous, but because you were also making use of me!\u201d\n Unexpectedly, Song Ci even remembered this clearly. Han Zhan felt shocked and uneasy.\n \u201cI\u2019m asking you, is this true?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s face turned completely cold.\n Han Zhan replied, \u201c...Yes.\u201d\n Pa!\n Song Ci gave Han Zhan a tight slap.\n Han Zhan\u2019s left cheek was burning. He had been slapped so hard by Song Ci that his head turned sideways.\n Song Ci, who doted on him so much, actually slapped him...\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "202": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-203\n\n Chapter 202: Everytime I Treat You Well, I Can\u2019t Help It  Han Zhan had been kicked and punched before, but this was the first time he had been slapped.\n Han Zhan slowly turned back and looked at Song Ci. Song Ci was so agitated that her face was red. Her right hand, which had hit Han Zhan, was still trembling. He was the one who had been hit, but Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached for her.\n Han Zhan tried to reach out to pinch Song Ci\u2019s hand. Song Ci struggled but couldn\u2019t break free. Han Zhan touched Song Ci\u2019s reddened palm and looked down, covering the regret and guilt in his eyes. He asked Song Ci, \u201cBaby Ci, is it very painful?\u201d\n Song Ci looked at her own hand and then at Han Zhan\u2019s newly-formed left cheek, even breathing hurt.\n \u201cHan Zhan, the motive of our marriage was never pure. From the start, I needed your protection and used your identity to take revenge on Mu Mian. I used you, so of course you can also use me\u2014this is very fair. But Han Zhan, can\u2019t you be like me, using me openly? Must you be so despicable? Must you make me feel disgusted!\u201d\n When the word \u201cdisgusted\u201d escaped from Song Ci\u2019s lips, Han Zhan\u2019s heart was in turmoil. He grabbed Song Ci\u2019s wrist tightly and looked up at her, the whites of his gray-blue eyes bloodshot.\n \u201cSong Ci, let me finish.\u201d Han Zhan sounded very anxious, afraid that Song Ci would leave him behind.\n Song Ci suppressed the anger and resentment in her heart and struggled to maintain her calm. Gritting her teeth, she said, \u201cTell me. Tell me everything clearly.\u201d\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cInitially, I brought you over from the Mu Family to cohabit with me because I had ulterior motives. But on the first day we cohabited, I accidentally broke your precious box and discovered that the buckle that you treated like a treasure for eight years was the same buckle that I lost at the disaster site. I realized then that you were the young lady whom I risked my life to save back then.\u201d\n \u201cAt that moment, I felt very ashamed of my dirty thoughts. At that time, I was thinking that I had personally saved this little girl from the gates of hell. How could I hurt her?\u201d\n Song Ci also remembered what Han Zhan said.\n She remembered very clearly that in the garage downstairs, when Han Zhan was helping her take her things, he had accidentally dropped her precious wooden box on the floor. The buckle had fallen out and Song Ci was afraid that it would be broken. She hurriedly picked it up and held it for a long while, her heart still aching.\n Song Ci\u2019s ears felt slightly hot at the thought of how she would blow and stroke the pendant in front of the owner of the pendant.\n She was both angry and frustrated.\n Han Zhan told Song Ci again, \u201cThe day that I was truly attracted to you and decided to give up on using you to deal with my father was the day we registered our marriage.\u201d\n Song Ci tried to recall what happened that day, but she only remembered that they registered their marriage and went to the restaurant in Deep Alley for dinner. After dinner, they got into an argument for the first time because Han Zhan gave her a bank card.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t remember anything else.\n Han Zhan knew that Song Ci had forgotten, but he still remembered very clearly. As he recalled that day, he said, \u201cOn the way home after registering our marriage, we put on rings for each other, and you snatched my fake fingers over and personally put them on for me. At that time, you said...\u201d\n With Han Zhan\u2019s reminder, Song Ci suddenly remembered everything and said, \u201cBrother Han, from now on, you can only let me touch your right hand and your tie.\u201d I seemed to have said this then.\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Han Zhan\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYes! That\u2019s exactly what you said!\u201d Not a word more or less.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know how moved I was the moment I heard those words. My heart started racing. I knew then that I was attracted to you. As we got along, I slowly fell for you...\u201d\n Han Zhan looked up at Song Ci and resigned to fate. \u201cThat frog that was cooked in warm water wasn\u2019t you. It was me.\u201d The person who started the fire ended up being the frog that jumped into the warm water.\n \u201cWhen I found out that Aaron had noticed you, I was really scared that day. It was also at that moment that I realized that I couldn\u2019t push you into the fire pit my father had created. I was actually so scared that you would be hurt.\u201d\n \u201cFrom the moment I decided to confess Aaron\u2019s identity to you, I admitted defeat.\u201d\n For the first time, Han Zhan\u2019s back, which was always as straight as a pine tree, bent down in front of Song Ci. He leaned his forehead against the back of Song Ci\u2019s hand, and his shoulders trembled, as if...\n He\u2019s crying?\n Some tears fell on the back of Song Ci\u2019s hand, dripping down her fingers and onto the sofa.\n Song Ci was slightly stunned.\n Han Zhan cries too?\n Looking at Han Zhan crying so bitterly, Song Ci\u2019s anger was extinguished bit by bit. She couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for him again.\n Song Ci heard the pain in Han Zhan\u2019s voice. \u201cSong Ci, I know you and your mother are innocent, but I have a grudge in my heart. I once watched my father kill my mother and I hugged my dying mother. Do you know what my father said then? He said, \u2018Han Mulan, if not for your face, I would have made your life a living hell.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cLook at how ridiculous this is. She was already killed by him and she still has to thank him for being merciful and not torturing her...\u201d\n Song Ci wasn\u2019t Han Zhan and couldn\u2019t empathize with the pain he went through as a child. But after hearing these words, she also didn\u2019t feel good.\n Song Ci was very flustered and didn\u2019t wish to face Han Zhan now. She said, \u201cHan Zhan, let go of me.\u201d\n But Han Zhan thought that Song Ci was leaving him. He hurriedly hugged her waist and begged her to stay. \u201cSong Ci, don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t you want me anymore?\u201d\n Song Ci remained silent for a while before placing her hands on Han Zhan\u2019s head. \u201cHan Zhan, I won\u2019t leave you. I want to stay over at Yan Jiang\u2019s house tonight. Let me be alone for a while.\u201d\n If this went on, things would get very complicated.\n Hearing this, Han Zhan still refused. \u201cIf you want to be alone and calm down, just stay here. I\u2019ll leave.\u201d He would never allow Song Ci to leave this house. He was afraid that if she left, she would never return.\n Song Ci could sense that Han Zhan was too tense and didn\u2019t want to anger him, so she agreed. \u201cAlright then, you can leave.\u201d\n Han Zhan released her waist reluctantly. He put on his slippers and walked to the door. As he was changing his shoes, Han Zhan heard Song Ci call his name. \u201cHan Zhan!\u201d\n Han Zhan looked up in surprise, thinking that Song Ci wanted him to stay.\n Song Ci stood in the middle of the living room, her inquisitive eyes landing on Han Zhan.\n Song Ci\u2019s expression was like she was weeping and complaining. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cLet me ask you, in this half a year, you\u2019ve been treating me so well, doting on me, and taking care of me\u2014was it really all just to deceive me into loving you?\u201d\n Biting her red lips, Song Ci gazed at Han Zhan with tears in her eyes. She asked again, \u201cWere there times when you just wanted to be good to me?\u201d\n Pain flashed across Han Zhan\u2019s eyes. He said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you believe me or not. But Song Ci, every time I treat you well, I can\u2019t help it.\u201d With that, he opened the door and walked out.\n After Han Zhan disappeared from this house, Song Ci suddenly felt that this house was very big and very spacious.\n She turned and was about to head upstairs when she stopped in her tracks and glanced at the middle of the sofa. The black sofa was still wet.\n Song Ci stretched out her hands and looked at her fingers. She could still feel the warmth of Han Zhan\u2019s tears.\n She should hate Han Zhan, but her heart ached for him.\n She was hopeless.\n \u2013\n Han Zhan drove around this bustling city for a long time, before finally parking in front of the villa.\n No matter how much a person grew up, be it when they were young or old, when they were bullied or suffered grievances, the first place they would think of would always be home.\n ]Zhong Buhui heard the sound of a car. He hurriedly turned on the light in his room, got out of bed, walked to the window, and glanced down at the courtyard entrance.\n Seeing that it was Han Zhan\u2019s car, Zhong Buhui hurriedly put on his down jacket and went downstairs to open the door for him. \u201cZhanzhan, why are you here so late?\u201d\n Zhong Buhui reached out to hold Han Zhan\u2019s hand, only to realize that it was very cold. He hurriedly pulled Han Zhan into the house and into the main hall. Under the bright lights, Zhong Buhui realized that Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were red.\n Zhong Buhui\u2019s heart skipped a beat. As he poured hot water for Han Zhan, he asked probingly, \u201cDid you have a fight with that Song lass?\u201d Zhong Buhui turned and handed a cup to Han Zhan. \u201cHere, have some hot water.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Uncle Zhong.\u201d\n Han Zhan held the teacup with both hands and sat down on his grandfather\u2019s favorite armchair. Han Zhan just sipped his tea in silence, not intending to speak.\n Zhong Buhui stayed with him. As the night was cold, Zhong Buhui lit a fire in the living room.\n The room gradually warmed up. Zhong Buhui heard the sound of slow footsteps coming from upstairs. He glanced at Han Zhan and reminded him. \u201cOld Master must have come down.\u201d\n Only then did Han Zhan stand up and change seats.\n Han Aoyu draped a thick and warm pyjamas jacket over his shoulders and put on furry slippers. He supported himself against the railing as he slowly made his way downstairs. Standing behind the armchair, he stared at the handprint on Han Zhan\u2019s left cheek and slowly narrowed his vicious eyes.\n Han Aoyu sat down on his own chair. Zhong Buhui hurriedly handed a cup of hot water to Old Master Han.\n Old Master took a sip to moisten his throat before looking at Han Zhan.\n Gazing at the red and swollen palm print on Han Zhan\u2019s left cheek, Han Aoyu could imagine how angry Song Ci must have been when she slapped him. Han Aoyu suddenly said with a sigh, \u201cEveryone has to pay the price for their own mistakes. Han Zhan, have you ever tasted regret?\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan was slightly stunned. \u201cGrandpa, how did you know...\u201d\n Han Aoyu crossed his legs and leaned back against the armchair. He closed his eyes and said, \u201cThe first time I saw Song Ci, I already felt that she looked familiar. Your Uncle Zhong said that it might be because Song Ci looks a little like your mother. After returning home, I went to look at Mulan\u2019s photos when she was young and felt that something was off.\u201d\n \u201cOn the day of your wedding, Song Ci was wearing a red dress. As I stared at her, that familiar feeling grew stronger and stronger. After the wedding, when I returned to my room to rest, I suddenly thought of someone and understood why Song Ci gave me such a familiar feeling. It was because she looked so much like the first love whom Edward loved!\u201d\n \u201cI remember that woman. I think her name is Jiang Shiyu...\u201d Recalling Jiang Shiyu, Han Aoyu\u2019s expression was slightly complicated.\u201d The last time I saw Jiang Shiyu was 33 years ago. I rarely see that woman\u2019s intelligence, forbearance, and wit, so I have a very deep impression of her. \u201d\n As for how smart and patient Jiang Shiyu was, Han Aoyu didn\u2019t tell Han Zhan in detail.\n \u201cHan Zhan, a person who has suffered in pain will have a very deep memory. It\u2019s impossible that you don\u2019t know Jiang Shiyu. In that case, since I can detect the similarities between Song Ci and Jiang Shiyu, you can too.\u201d\n \u201cI am making a bold guess that the previously single you suddenly decided to marry Song Ci because of some unspeakable secret. I am thinking that you might want to use Song Ci to deal with Edward...\u201d\n Under Han Aoyu\u2019s sharp and experienced eyes, Han Zhan was shocked. It was his grandfather after all. Even though he was old, he was still an old fox. Han Zhan lowered his head in shame. He was like a transparent person who was seen through by Han Aoyu from the inside out.\n Han Aoyu snorted when he saw Han Zhan keeping his head down. \u201cIs my analysis correct?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s voice was as soft as a mosquito. \u201cGrandpa, you guessed correctly.\u201d\n \u201cAh! Han Zhan, oh Han Zhan, you are so foolish!\u201d Han Aoyu was so angry that he directly lifted his leg to step on Han Zhan\u2019s foot. Han Aoyu pressed down hard on Han Zhan\u2019s leather shoe, and Han Zhan frowned slightly from the pain, but didn\u2019t move his foot away.\n Zhong Buhui watched on coldly without saying anything to dissuade Han Aoyu. At this point, dissuading Han Aoyu would only make him angrier.\n Only after releasing his anger did Han Aoyu retract his leg.\n He mocked Han Zhan. \u201cHan Zhan, you are so stupid! Regardless of whether it\u2019s that Song girl or Jiang Shiyu, they are totally not at fault. The one at fault is that beast who took the initiative to provoke your mother!\u201d\n How could Han Zhan not understand this? He felt pained and said, \u201cI know Jiang Shiyu is innocent, but what happened when we were young made me want to hate her.\u201d Not only him, his younger siblings also detested Jiang Shiyu deeply.\n If not for that femme fatale Jiang Shiyu, they would not have been born and would not have suffered so much!\n Han Aoyu recalled how Han Zhan was covered in needle-like wounds when he first found him. His heart ached. He didn\u2019t dare to imagine how evil he would have been if he hadn\u2019t snatched Han Zhan back and placed him by his side to be raised. If he had been allowed to grow up by Edward\u2019s side, he would have been such a terrible and evil person.\n Han Aoyu looked at Han Zhan and shook his head. This outstanding child disappointed him for the first time. \u201cHan Zhan, you thought you could remain unmoved by that Song girl. You thought you could really be ruthless enough to use that Song girl to deal with Edward. But you didn\u2019t expect that the person who truly fell into the pit of love in the end was yourself.\u201d\n \u201cA person scheming against love will eventually be avenged by love. Han Zhan, you are too foolish!\u201d\n Those who scheme against love will eventually be avenged by love...\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan only smiled bitterly, the expression on his face showing rare fragility and helplessness. \u201cGrandpa, you are very experienced. Tell me, what should I do now?\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t know who to turn to for help and could only look for Grandpa.\n Grandpa glared at him angrily. \u201cWhat do you mean by experienced?\u201d\n Han Zhan said in a small voice, \u201cDidn\u2019t you always make grandma angry in the past and even slept in the study...\u201d Seeing that Han Aoyu\u2019s face was getting angrier and angrier, Han Zhan didn\u2019t dare to continue speaking.\n Han Aoyu really wanted to kick Han Zhan out.\n Although he was angry, he couldn\u2019t just brush aside his grandchild\u2019s marriage. Han Aoyu told Han Zhan, \u201cIn a few days, bring Song Ci to the villa for New Year and stay here for a few days.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t come?\u201d\n Han Aoyu rolled his eyes at Han Zhan. \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s just let her kick me aside and you can get back to being single. You\u2019ve already been single for 10 years\u2014what difference does it make if you\u2019re single for another few decades?\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n I must bring Song Ci to my grandfather\u2019s house for the new year.\n \u2013\n Early the next morning, Song Ci carried a trash bag and was about to go downstairs to dump the trash. The moment she opened the door, a black shadow fell in.\n Song Ci was shocked. She looked and saw that it was Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan held onto the door frame and stood up. After seeing Song Ci and the trash bag in her hand, he reached out to take the trash bag from her. \u201cAre you going to dump the trash? Let me do it.\u201d\n As their hands touched, Song Ci suddenly felt that Han Zhan\u2019s hands were as cold as ice.\n Last night\u2019s outdoor temperature was negative two degrees...\n \u201cHan Zhan, you were at the door the entire night?\u201d Song Ci had mixed feelings.\n Han Zhan took out a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his nose before nodding. \u201cI was afraid that you would look for me. I was afraid that if I went too far, you won\u2019t be able to find me, so I didn\u2019t dare to go too far.\u201d But Song Ci didn\u2019t even open this door last night.\n Song Ci instinctively said, \u201cI thought you went to the hotel...\u201d Meeting Han Zhan\u2019s aggrieved expression, Song Ci got angry and spoke without thinking.\u201d Han Zhan, is there something wrong with your brain? What if you catch a cold? Why, are you still trying to trick me into feeling sorry for you? \u201d\n Han Zhan stared at the enraged Song Ci. He was not angry, but rather happy.\n Han Zhan asked Song Ci softly, \u201cSong Ci, are you feeling sorry for me?\u201d\n Song Ci was amused. \u201cMy heart aches for you?! If you want to stay at the door, just stay at the door!\u201d Song Ci closed the door and left Han Zhan and the trash outside.\n Han Zhan rubbed his nose and obediently went downstairs to throw the rubbish.\n He was so cold that he felt slightly numb. As he walked, he felt like he would collapse to the ground the next second if he dragged his heavy body with his feet. After dumping the trash, Han Zhan returned to the lift, leaned against the wall, and wiped his nose.\n Ding...\n Han Zhan slowly walked out of the lift.\n His door had not been changed and was still locked. Han Zhan didn\u2019t take his keys when he came out last night. He walked up to the door and was about to knock when he realized that there was a gap.\n Staring at that crack in the door, Han Zhan\u2019s heart also cracked slightly as a ray of light shone in.\n Han Zhan stood at the door for a while, before pulling it open and entering the house. After entering, Han Zhan purposely made some noise while changing his shoes so that Song Ci would know he was back.\n Han Zhan was relieved that Song Ci didn\u2019t tell him to scram.\n Seeing that Song Ci was busy in the kitchen, Han Zhan thought that she was making breakfast. He boldly walked over and wanted to help her cook. The moment he entered the kitchen, he realized that Song Ci was not making breakfast but ginger tea.\n Han Zhan stared at that pot of ginger tea and felt sweet inside. \u201cBaby Ci, is this for me?\u201d\n Song Ci said expressionlessly, \u201cThere\u2019s a stray cat downstairs. I was worried they might catch a cold and cooked it for them.\u201d\n \u201cI know. That cat is called Han Zhan. I will help you send it over later.\u201d Han Zhan decided to be a cat from now on.\n Song Ci\u2019s lips curled up.\n She turned down the fire, pushed Han Zhan aside, and walked into the living room. When she turned around, Han Zhan suddenly hugged her.\n Han Zhan was tall and strong. His arms were long and powerful, so Song Ci couldn\u2019t break free at all.\n Song Ci sneered and mocked Han Zhan. \u201cWhat are you doing? Have you watched too many television dramas? After the fight, you also want to imitate the male and female leads, hugging and kissing each other on the bed, and then we\u2019ll just end up making up?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just feeling dizzy. Let me lean on you for a while.\u201d\n Realizing that the head pressing against her cheek was slightly hot, Song Ci realized that Han Zhan was having a fever. She cursed softly before pushing Han Zhan away. \u201cYou have a fever. Go sit on the sofa.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t know that he had a fever, but he still obediently went to sit on the sofa.\n Song Ci found a thermometer and measured Han Zhan\u2019s temperature. \u201c40 degrees.\u201d Song Ci scolded Han Zhan. \u201cAdd another two degrees and you will turn into a fool.\u201d\n But Han Zhan felt very cold.\n He shivered as he sat on the sofa. \u201cI can\u2019t be stupid. If I am, my wife will run away.\u201d\n Song Ci gave him a meaningful look before turning to go upstairs. When she went downstairs, she was carrying a thin blanket. \u201cCover yourself properly!\u201d Song Ci threw the blanket over Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan used a blanket to cover his chest and legs. He laid on the sofa, completely paralyzed. Song Ci went into the kitchen to pour a bowl of ginger tea and served it to Han Zhan before looking for medicine.\n After looking around the house, she didn\u2019t see any flu medicine. Song Ci had no choice but to take her car keys and go out to buy medicine.\n Han Zhan hurriedly sat up and said to her, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\n \u201cLie down properly, what are you running around for!\u201d With one look, Song Ci pinned Han Zhan onto the sofa.\n Song Ci quickly went downstairs and went to the pharmacy outside the district to buy some fever and flu medicine. She returned home and called Han Zhan. \u201cHan Zhan, take your medicine.\u201d\n Han Zhan seemed to be sleeping. He opened his mouth to breathe, but his body was trembling. This was very much like a seizure caused by a fever.\n Song Ci hurriedly put down the medicine, walked over, touched Han Zhan\u2019s forehead, and retracted her hand from the heat. \u201cHan Zhan!\u201d Song Ci panicked and pushed Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t react.\n Song Ci was terrified. She wanted to drag Han Zhan to the hospital, but he was too heavy and Song Ci couldn\u2019t move him at all.\n A few days ago, Song Ci noticed that someone finally moved into the house downstairs which had been empty the entire time. Song Ci planned to go downstairs and get someone to help.\n The privacy of their community was very good. Every owner\u2019s access card could only be used to access the lift to their own level. Song Ci couldn\u2019t take the lift down and could only use the fire escape stairs.\n Song Ci ran downstairs and politely knocked on the door of her neighbor\u2019s house. \u201cHello neighbor, are you at home? I am your neighbor upstairs. My name is Song Ci. My lover is sick and fainted. Can you help me carry him to the garage downstairs?\u201d\n Behind the door, a pair of brown eyes was staring at the person inside the surveillance camera, but was in no hurry to open the door.\n She picked up the phone and called the property management. After confirming that the female owner upstairs was called Song Ci, she opened the door slightly and said to Song Ci, \u201cWait a minute, let me put on a jacket.\u201d\n A deep, melodious voice drifted into Song Ci\u2019s ears. She couldn\u2019t tell the gender.\n Song Ci nodded. After a while, he opened the door again and walked out.\n Song Ci\u2019s new neighbor was a 1.8-meter-tall young man. She was wearing a leather jacket, casual work pants, and flat shoes. Her hair reached her shoulders and she had an indistinguishable beauty.\n Song Ci was stunned. She asked uncertainly, \u201cNeighbor?\u201d\n The neighbor said, \u201cHi, my name is Jiang Bi. I just moved in recently.\u201d\n The voice belonged to a girl.\n \u201cHi, sorry to trouble you.\u201d\n Jiang Bi closed the door and walked to the lift. She swiped her card and the lift door opened. Song Ci and Jiang Bi entered together.\n Song Ci swiped her own card and the lift automatically went up. Song Ci brought Jiang Bi home and said to her, \u201cMy lover is slightly heavy. Help me lift his legs as long as he doesn\u2019t fall.\u201d\n Jiang Bi stared at Han Zhan\u2019s size and said, \u201cLet me carry him.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. She instinctively said, \u201cHe weighs 1670 catties. You won\u2019t be able to carry him.\u201d Her new neighbor also looked rather skinny. Song Ci didn\u2019t think she could carry Han Zhan.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I am strong.\u201d Jiang Bi bent down in front of the sofa and said to Song Ci, \u201cHelp him up.\u201d\n ong Ci hurriedly helped Han Zhan up. Jiang Bi grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arms and really carried him up.\n After carrying Han Zhan, Jiang Bi didn\u2019t seem to have any difficulty walking. Song Ci was shocked and thought to herself that one really shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover. She looked like a rather skinny lady but was rather strong.\n With Jiang Bi\u2019s help, Song Ci and her stuffed Han Zhan into the car. Song Ci sat in the driver\u2019s seat and said to Jiang Bi, \u201cMiss Jiang, thank you so much this time!\u201d\n Jiang Bi shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n Jiang Bi turned and left.\n Song Ci drove towards the hospital, thinking that this new neighbor was so cold.\n \u2013\n For someone like Han Zhan who hadn\u2019t caught a cold for so many years, the moment he caught a cold, it would be especially serious. The doctor directly opened the hospitalization form for Han Zhan and told him to be hospitalized for treatment and to get an injection to reduce his fever as soon as possible.\n Han Zhan woke up with a syringe in the back of his hand. Song Ci was nowhere to be seen.\n Seeing that Han Zhan was awake, Long Yu hurried over to the bed. Knowing who Mr. Han was looking for, Long Yu told him, \u201cMadam went downstairs to buy you some toiletries. She didn\u2019t leave.\u201d\n Only then did Han Zhan feel assured.\n His cell phone was charging and he asked Long Yu to bring it over.\n Han Zhan turned on his cell phone and saw that there were many missed calls. He called each and every one of them. In the end, he called Li Li and Bei Zhan. On the phone, Han Zhan told them in a weak voice, \u201cI have a serious cold which caused a lung infection. I need to be hospitalized. I will have to trouble the two of you to work harder these few days before the new year...\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s weak and raspy voice scared the two of them. Bei Zhan hurriedly said, \u201cMr. Han, rest well. Don\u2019t worry about the company. Li Li and I will settle everything.\u201d\n \u201cThank you...\u201d\n After hanging up, Han Zhan tossed his cell phone onto the dresser, lifted the blanket, and stood up. He was no longer as weak as he was on the phone just now. Long Yu had a complicated look in his eyes as he thought that Bei Zhan and Li Li were so kind and gullible.\n Han Zhan walked around the room for a while. Thinking that Song Ci should be back soon, he laid down on the bed.\n Song Ci returned with some things and saw that Han Zhan was awake but looking very sickly and pitiful. Song Ci put the things down and told Han Zhan, \u201cYou had a fever and fainted. It was the neighbor downstairs who carried you downstairs.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked weakly, \u201cNeighbor downstairs? Jiang Bi?\u201d\n \u201cYou know him?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI remember the identity and appearance of all the people in this building. The neighbor downstairs is called Jiang Bi. She is Jiang Jiagang\u2019s child.\u201d\n \u201cThe Jiang family?\u201d There were several Jiang families in Wangdong City, but she didn\u2019t know which one. Song Ci asked curiously, \u201cWhich Jiang family?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThe Jiang Family of the Wonderful Medicine Group.\u201d\n Song Ci knew that person from the Jiang Family. She said, \u201cThat Chairman Jiang only has one daughter and a 13-year-old adopted son. What\u2019s up with this Jiang Bi?\u201d\n Han Zhan took a sip before speaking slowly. \u201c18 years ago, the 4 year-old twins of Jiang Weimin, the founder of Wonderful Medicine Group, were kidnapped and missing. All these years, the Jiang Family had been searching for those two children and finally found them last year. Unfortunately, Chairman Jiang\u2019s son has already passed away...\u201d\n \u201cSo Jiang Bi is the daughter that the Jiang family found outside last year?\u201d\n \u201cYes. Jiang Bi and her elder brother were the children of Jiang Weimin and his ex-wife. After the children went missing, Madam Jiang was very depressed and passed away 10 years ago. The current daughter of the Jiang Family was given birth by Director Jiang\u2019s second wife five years ago.\u201d\n \u201cI see. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n Thinking of Jiang Bi\u2019s strength, Song Ci felt slightly envious. \u201cOur neighbor is so strong. Really, you are so heavy for a man, but she actually carried you all the way downstairs without resting.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d Han Zhan remembered that Jiang Bi was a slender lady. He said, \u201cSome people might look skinny, but they are actually very strong. This isn\u2019t strange.\u201d\n \u201cWe will go and thank her properly after you are discharged. If not for Jiang Bi\u2019s help, you might have turned into a fool.\u201d\n \u201cYes, we should thank her.\u201d\n The two of them spoke calmly for a while, not talking about the argument last night. It was as if that incident never happened if they didn\u2019t bring it up. Han Zhan stayed in the hospital for two days. After his fever subsided and he recovered fully, he went home.\n It was 26th December when he got home.\n Song Ci went to a high-end fruit shop to buy some exquisite fruits and gave them to Jiang Bi with Han Zhan. Song Ci pressed the doorbell and waited for a while, before the door opened from the inside.\n Opening the door, Han Wangwang saw Song Ci standing outside. His eyes widened. \u201cLittle Aunt, why are you here?\u201d\n Song Ci was even more shocked than Han Wangwang. \u201cWangwang, why are you at Jiang Bi\u2019s house?\u201d Han Zhan, who was standing behind Song Ci, also asked Han Wangwang, \u201cIt\u2019s almost the new year, why haven\u2019t you returned to Shunchen?\u201d\n Han Wangwang explained. \u201cI will be flying tomorrow morning. Jiang Bi is my classmate. I will be staying at her house tonight.\u201d\n \u201cAre you two classmates?\u201d Song Ci remembered that Han Wangwang was a law student. \u201cIs Jiang Bi also a law student?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n At this moment, Jiang Bi walked over. She was still dressed casually and had a cold expression. Seeing that Han Wangwang was chatting with Song Ci and the rest, Jiang Bi asked Han Wangwang, \u201cYou know my neighbor upstairs?\u201d\n Han Wangwang nodded. She pointed at Han Zhan and told Jiang Bi, \u201cThis is my little uncle. This beauty is my little aunt.\u201d\n Jiang Bi nodded and glanced at Han Zhan. \u201cMr. Han, Mrs. Han, please come in.\u201d\n The two of them entered Jiang Bi\u2019s house carrying fruits.\n Jiang Bi\u2019s house was a high-quality, duplex-storey, and in a lavish style. Jiang Bi didn\u2019t speak much. She invited Song Ci and Han Zhan to sit down and made them a cup of tea. There was nothing else to say.\n Han Wangwang had already treated Jiang Bi\u2019s house as her own. She sat on the carpet, hugged Jiang Bi\u2019s waist, leaned against her shoulder, and said to Song Ci, \u201cJiang Bi is a very nice person. Auntie, since you\u2019re all neighbors. If you have anything good to eat or drink in future, remember my Little Jiang.\u201d\n Jiang Bi was thunderstruck by the term \u201cLittle Jiang\u201d.\n Han Zhan stared at Han Wangwang\u2019s sitting position, frowned unhappily, and scolded her. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any bones? Can\u2019t you just sit properly? Why do you lean on others all the time? What do you look like?\u201d\n Han Wangwang quickly sat up straight, after being reprimanded by Han Zhan.\n Song Ci said to Jiang Bi, \u201cJiang Bi, thank you so much for what happened last time. In future, if you need any help, just tell me.\u201d Saying so, Song Ci took out her cell phone and said to Jiang Bi, \u201cLet\u2019s add each other on WeChat so that we can take care of each other.\u201d\n Jiang Bi was still hesitating when Han Wangwang took away Jiang Bi\u2019s cell phone and sent Song Ci a message. Returning the cell phone to Jiang Bi, Han Wangwang said to Jiang Bi, \u201cIf you need anything, feel free to look for my little auntie. She is not only beautiful but also kind-hearted.\u201d\n Jiang Bi then nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The two of them sat at Jiang Bi\u2019s house for a while before returning. After returning home, Song Ci said to Han Zhan, \u201cWangwang and Jiang Bi are so close.\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned and said, \u201cWhy do I feel that the two of them are behaving strangely?\u201d But Han Zhan couldn\u2019t put his finger on it.\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cDoes Wangwang like boys or girls?\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n He broke out in cold sweat at Song Ci\u2019s question.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "203": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-204\n\n Chapter 203: Zeus International\u2019s CEO, Han Zhan!  After Song Ci and Han Zhan left, Jiang Bi got up and went to the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator and looked at the steak. Seeing that it had thawed, she asked Han Wangwang, \u201cDo you want the Wellington steak?\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Jiang Bi grilled the steak on both sides for a minute to seal the gravy. Han Wangwang was cutting onions at the side, crying as she cut. Jiang Bi couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and snatched the knife from her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll cut it, you go out and play games.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n Han Wangwang walked to the carpet in the living room and sat down. She leaned back against the sofa and was about to play chicken on her cell phone, when she saw a message from her little uncle.\n Han Wangwang opened the message.\n Little Uncle: [Have you had a boyfriend before?]\n Han Wangwang widened her eyes.\n What\u2019s going on?\n Why is little uncle concerned about my personal love life?\n Han Wangwang: [I am as beautiful as a flower. I can be a school bully and a school genius. What is a boyfriend? If I want something to waste my time, energy, and money on, I might as well play a few more games.]\n Han Zhan saw Han Wangwang\u2019s reply and thought to himself, Oh no, my niece doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in men.\n After hesitating for a moment, Han Zhan asked Han Wangwang: [What do you think of Jiang Bi?]\n Han Wangwang knew how vigilant Han Zhan was. He was the kind of person who would only feel at ease, if he investigated the information of the entire community before moving.\n Thinking that Han Zhan was suspicious of Jiang Bi and worried about her, Han Wangwang praised Jiang Bi. [Jiang Bi? Jiang Bi is a very nice person. She is very kind, caring and respectful. I love playing with her the most.]\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart turned slightly cold.\n There were some things that were rather difficult to say out loud. Han Zhan reminded Han Wangwang from the side: [Wangwang, you need to be careful when dating. You don\u2019t like someone just because you have a good impression of them.]\n Although she felt that her little uncle\u2019s words were rather strange, Han Wangwang still replied with an \u201cokay\u201d.\n Han Zhan saw that Han Wangwang had replied with the word \u201cokay\u201d and instantly felt that he might have been overthinking things. Han Wangwang was an upright young lady and no one in the family was indecent. Wangwang and Jiang Bi were both girls and it was normal for children to hug and lift each other up high.\n Han Wangwang played a round of games and the steak in the oven was ready. Jiang Bi took out the steak and let it cool for a while before cutting it and putting it on the plate. \u201cEat.\u201d Jiang Bi carried the food to the table.\n Han Wangwang tossed her cell phone aside and sat down at the table.\n Looking at the delicious food, Han Wangwang hugged Jiang Bi\u2019s shoulder and praised her. \u201cJiang Bi, you are a treasure. You are so awesome. Can I marry you in the future? You will cook for me forever!\u201d\n Jiang Bi smiled and handed the cutlery to Han Wangwang. \u201cEat.\u201d\n Han Wangwang took the cutlery and concentrated on eating. The two of them didn\u2019t speak much during the meal. After the meal, Han Wangwang pulled Jiang Bi to the center to play games.\n Han Wangwang wanted to get some beauty sleep at 10pm. \u201cI am going to bed now. You can send me to the airport tomorrow morning.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Jiang Bi and Han Wangwang went upstairs together.\n Jiang Bi opened the door to the master bedroom and entered. Only then did she realize that Han Wangwang had also followed her in. Jiang Bi fell silent suspiciously before saying to Han Wangwang, \u201cThere\u2019s a guest bedroom next door. The bedsheets are laid out.\u201d\n Han Wangwang hugged Jiang Bi\u2019s hand. She said, \u201cI am leaving tomorrow. I might have to transfer to the Southern Medical University next semester. It won\u2019t be easy to meet you in the future. Can I sleep with you tonight and talk?\u201d\n Jiang Bi thought about it and agreed.\n The bed was very wide and Jiang Bi slept at the side. The 1.8-meter bed was left for Han Wangwang at 1.4 meters. Afraid that Jiang Bi would fall off, Han Wangwang rolled to the middle of the bed and hugged Jiang Bi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy are you so far away? Sleep in a little more. I don\u2019t have any thorns on me!\u201d\n Jiang Bi\u2019s body stiffened at Han Wangwang\u2019s hug.\n After a while, Jiang Bi crossed her legs, turned over, and slept on her side. Han Wangwang murmured in her ear, talking a lot about her many years of winning prizes.\n Only when it was almost midnight did Han Wangwang finally fall asleep.\n After she fell asleep, Jiang Bi stared greedily at Han Wangwang\u2019s face for a long time.\n The next morning, Jiang Bi sent Han Wangwang to the airport.\n Arriving at the airport, Jiang Bi opened the boot and handed a huge bag of snacks to Han Wangwang. Han Wangwang looked at the bag and saw that it was filled with her favorite snacks. She was so moved that she hugged Jiang Bi. \u201cJiang Bi, I love you the most!\u201d\n Jiang Bi\u2019s lips curled into a smile. \u201cHurry up and go check your tickets. Don\u2019t miss your flight.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Jiang Bi watched as Han Wangwang went to inspect the tickets and entered the waiting hall, before driving back to the Jiang Family residence.\n \u2013\n It was 27th December and the festive season was getting more and more intense. A few days ago, Liang Bo moved into a new house and got into a new car. He invited his friends over and they had a lively meal together. On 27th, he officially invited Song Ci over for dinner.\n Song Ci brought the gifts she had prepared to Liang Bo\u2019s house. Seeing Liang Bo living alone in a 300-square-meter large house, Song Ci felt that it was very luxurious.\n Liang Bo was not a good cook, but to show his sincerity, he got up early in the morning and cooked a sumptuous meal for Song Ci. Before the meal, the two of them sat down at the table. Song Ci picked up her chopsticks and was about to eat when she thought of Han Zhan.\n She suddenly said to Liang Bo, \u201cLiang Bo, let\u2019s take a photo together and show everyone your culinary skills.\u201d\n \u201cAlright! Wait for me to go get my hair done.\u201d Liang Bo, who was troubled by the burden of being an idol, quickly ran to the toilet, styled his hair and tidied his collar. Only then did he return to the dining room to take a photo with Song Ci.\n After taking a few group photos, Song Ci edited her and Liang Bo\u2019s photos to perfection, before posting them on her social media. Song Ci: [Liang Ge\u2019s culinary skills are not bad. The future Mrs. Liang is very fortunate.]\n Song Ci\u2019s friends were all praising Liang Bo\u2019s culinary skills. His dishes were enticing and he was a good man. Whoever married him would be blessed.\n It was almost the new year and Zeus Corporation had also prepared red packets and New Year gifts for each and every one of their employees. Zeus Corporation was newly established this year and had packed very thick red packets with very practical gifts.\n Han Zhan and Bei Zhan arrived at the restaurant downstairs. Hearing that the employees were all talking about how rich the New Year\u2019s gift was and the many red packets, Han Zhan felt very happy.\n \u201cEh?\u201d Bei Zhan suddenly exclaimed.\n Han Zhan looked over at Bei Zhan and saw that he was still scrolling through his phone while eating. He lectured him. \u201cAs the vice-president of a major international corporation, do you think it\u2019s appropriate to play with your phone during mealtime?\u201d\n What about his image?\n Bei Zhan felt very aggrieved. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve already been so busy during work hours, why can\u2019t I look at my social media when I\u2019m eating?\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled at him. \u201cA middle-aged internet addict.\u201d\n Bei Zhan sneered and put down his cell phone. He looked at Han Zhan with some pity and said to him, \u201cMr. Han, I suggest you immediately take out your cell phone and look at your social media. You\u2019re having a meal with a man like me, while sister-in-law has the company of a gorgeous man. This difference...\u201d\n Some people looked all high and mighty on the surface, but in reality, their wives were about to cheat on them.\n Hearing this, Han Zhan frowned slightly. He hurriedly took out his cell phone and opened up his social media account. Looking around, he didn\u2019t see any updates from Song Ci. Han Zhan asked Bei Zhan, \u201cSong Ci updated her social media account?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right, didn\u2019t you see?\u201d Bei Zhan thought for a moment, and his expression suddenly became very interesting. \u201cMr. Han, could it be that sister-in-law blocked you?!\u201d There would come a day when someone blocked Han Zhan too!\n [fuzzy]Han Zhan\u2019s face darkened as he opened Song Ci\u2019s profile and entered her social media account. However, he realized that she no longer opened it to him.\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n He hurriedly took up Bei Zhan\u2019s cell phone and entered Song Ci\u2019s profile page. He saw that these few days, Song Ci had secretly updated three posts behind his back.\n The first status was a photo with the main leads being Song Ci and Liang Bo. The two of them were pressed their heads together and smiled annoyingly.\n In the second post, Song Ci held a fish in her left hand and a knife in her right. Someone stood aside and took a photo of her killing a fish. Song Ci captioned: [Domestic violence is against the law. Killing a fish is not against the law, right?]\n The third post was posted on the night he quarreled with Song Ci. Song Ci posted: [Love is straightforward and hatred is clear. I hate being used by others and being treated like a fool.]\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Bei Zhan asked in a low voice, \u201cSister-in-law really blocked you?\u201d\n \u201c...Mmm.\u201d Han Zhan only felt a sense of desolation as the food on his plate lost its flavor.\n Only after Bei Zhan had seen enough of Han Zhan\u2019s joke did his expression turn serious. He asked Han Zhan, \u201cYou and Song Ci have a conflict? Do you mind telling me?\u201d\n Han Zhan naturally couldn\u2019t tell Bei Zhan about his father. He said concisely, \u201cIt\u2019s like this. I did something wrong. I deceived and hid the truth from Song Ci. I intended to use her feelings for me to take revenge on someone.\u201d\n Bei Zhan thought that there was just a small conflict between Han Zhan and Song Ci. He didn\u2019t expect the problem to be so serious. \u201cWhat couples are most afraid of is lying about their feelings and exploiting them. You have done both. You should be thankful that she just blacklisted you from WeChat and not the household register.\u201d\n Han Zhan also knew that his initial thoughts were very despicable. These few days, he had been thinking of how to apologize to Song Ci, but he felt like he had fallen into a deep pit. Unable to find an exit, unable to think of a solution, he just kept dragging it out.\n Thinking that Bei Zhan was a father now and that he must be very experienced in dealing with conflicts between husband and wife, Han Zhan humbly asked him, \u201cBei Zhan, tell me, what should I do?\u201d\n Bei Zhan spread his hands. \u201cDo you know how your sister-in-law tried to make me stay after I found out that she used me as a substitute?\u201d\n Bei Zhan\u2019s wife was called Han Qingshen. She was the female CEO of the Empire Entertainment and controlled many entertainment companies in the country.\n Han Qingshen had once loved a man in university. Later on, that man broke up with her in order to pursue fame and fortune. He then traveled far and wide to travel to America and was now an internationally-renowned male celebrity.\n fBei Zhan was related to that man and they looked somewhat alike.\n The first time Han Qingshen met Bei Zhan was at a hotel. She got drunk and seduced him into bed. After that, Han Qingshen started wooing Bei Zhan. The female CEO was full of tricks and this innocent Bei Zhan was quickly conquered by Han Qingshen.\n The two of them quickly fell in love and were about to get married, when Hanqing\u2019s first love returned.\n During that time, the three of them were at odds with each other. Every day was a disaster. Later on, Bei Zhan discovered that he was just a substitute that Han Qingshen had found. In his despair, he broke up with Han Qingshen.\n Han Qingshen was scared out of her wits. She coaxed Bei Zhan for a long time, before finally coaxing him back to her side.\n The incident between Bei Zhan and his wife back then was rather serious. Han Zhan had also heard of it, but didn\u2019t know the details. Han Zhan hurriedly asked Bei Zhan, \u201cHow did Sister-in-law do it?\u201d\n Bei Zhan put down his chopsticks and crossed his arms over his chest. Leaning back in his chair, he said in a low voice, \u201cThe first step she did was to ask that first love of hers to a martial arts school and beat him up so badly that he collapsed to the ground crying bitterly. She even took a photo of her beating him up and sent it to me to prove that she no longer had any feelings for her first love.\u201d\n So ruthless?\n This first step stunned Han Zhan.\n \u201cThe second step she did was to hold a press conference to openly confess to me and propose to me at the press conference.\u201d\n Han Zhan still remembered this incident. At that time, Han Qingshen publicly declared her love for Bei Zhan and proposed to him at the press conference. It was widely known by the entire country.\n \u201cThirdly, she blocked my door with a watermelon in her left hand and a watermelon knife in her right...\u201d Bei Zhan rubbed his face and said with a numb and helpless expression,\u201d She cut that watermelon and handed me the knife stained with watermelon juice. She said to me, \u2018Bei Zhan, the knife is for you. If I have anything to do with Bei Tangzhi again, you will use this knife to kill me. \u201d\n \u201cTo this day, that knife is still on the table in our study.\u201d\n After hearing this, Han Zhan was completely stunned. \u201cS-Sister-in-law is so wild?\u201d\n Bei Zhan\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cSo what? I like wild things too.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t want to eat their public display of affection. \u201cEnjoy your meal. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d Han Qingshen was a girl who could do such a wild thing just to win back her beloved. Han Zhan felt that he should learn from Han Qingshen.\n \u2013\n Wangdong TV Station was holding a Spring Festival Gala tonight and Liang Bo was one of the singers invited.\n Liang Bo had been very popular over the past six months and had achieved very good results on his first album. He was now very famous and the gala program team had placed his performance third in line.\n Meanwhile, the first show was a large-scale singing and dancing opening for the new year. The second show was veteran Mr. Zhang Zhengwei performing \u201cHappy New Year\u201d with a hundred children. The third show was Liang Bo\u2019s individual performance. It could be seen just how much Wangdong TV Station valued and favored Liang Bo.\n It took some effort for Zhu Wen to get this line up.\n Every time he collaborated with Song Ci, Liang Bo\u2019s performance would always be spectacular. After obtaining the approval of the broadcasting station, Liang Bo decided to invite Song Ci to accompany him.\n After lunch, the two of them packed up and brought their outfits to the television station.\n Liang Bo had his own personal stylist team and Song Ci also trusted Ai Lun, so they each brought their own stylists. When Ai Lun knew that Song Ci was Liang Bo\u2019s personal composer, his eyes widened in shock.\n \u201cSong Song, is there anything you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n \u201cI won\u2019t pee while standing.\u201d Song Ci saw that there was no one around and made a joke.\n Ai Lun gave Song Ci a pat on the shoulder. \u201cHey, Song Song, why are you so naughty?\u201d\n Song Ci covered her mouth and laughed before saying, \u201cAlthough I am a pilot, music is something I have been learning since a young age. I am still talented in music.\u201d\n \u201cSong Song is so awesome.\u201d\n Ai Lun helped Song Ci put on makeup as he said, \u201cI heard that a mysterious big boss will be performing on stage tonight.\u201d\n Big boss?\n After thinking for a moment, Song Ci asked, \u201cWhich big boss?\u201d\n \u201cI am not sure about that. Isn\u2019t the epidemic very serious this year? So many people have died. I heard that there will be a memorial event tonight and a big boss from the business world will be performing a memorial service.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so? Who is it?\u201d\n \u201cThere are some rumors that it might be Chuan Dong\u2019s new CEO, Master Cheng.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo?\n Chuan Dong Group had always been a loving and patriotic corporation. During this year\u2019s epidemic, Chuan Dong Group had donated quite a bit of money and medical supplies. As a representative, Cheng Yanmo was suitable to perform the eulogy.\n After putting on her makeup, Song Ci picked up her cell phone and saw that Han Zhan had sent her a message a minute ago.\n Han Sanpang: [Baby Ci, where are you?]\n Song Ci: [I have something on tonight and am going on Wangdong TV Station\u2019s Spring Festival Gala with Liang Bo. I might not be home until midnight.] Although their relationship was strained, Song Ci still told Han Zhan her whereabouts obediently so that he wouldn\u2019t worry.\n Han Zhan: [I will wait for you then.]\n Song Ci thought that Han Zhan was waiting for her at home and thought it was funny: Where did that healthy man who used to sleep at least 10pm go?\n The party started at 8pm sharp.\n The stage was filled with vibrant colors and the audience was in high spirits. Liang Bo\u2019s show was ranked third and he was quickly brought to the backstage by the program team. Song Ci put on her mask and held her violin as she stood by another lift, waiting to go on stage.\n Tonight, Liang Bo was going to sing his album\u2019s leading song, \u201cLike the Wind\u201d. Song Ci was his only accompaniment.\n After the veteran Mr. Zhang went on stage, Song Ci and Liang Bo stood at the lift, ready to go on stage. Song Ci was actually rather nervous. The last time she performed in front of so many people was when she was 13 years old and participated in the National Violin Competition.\n She took a deep breath, lowered her head, and kissed the strings of the violin. She then got into position and closed her eyes to gather her emotions.\n The lift slowly rose. Song Ci could feel the dazzling light shining on her. She held the violin in her left hand, her thumb and index finger gently pinching the neck of the violin. Her entire being was one with the violin.\n She couldn\u2019t hear the applause or the din.\n Below the stage, countless eyes were fixed on the man and woman who were slowly ascending the stage.\n The young man was wearing a black, high-necked, cashmere sweater and a slim-fit suit jacket. He had an exaggerated diamond necklace around his neck and his curly hair was done in a lazy manner, making him look casual and charismatic.\n Liang Bo was sitting on a high stool with his left leg draped over it and his right leg resting at an angle. He was looking sideways at the girl in front of him.\n That girl had a voluptuous figure. She was round and smooth, with straight, white, sexy shoulders. She was wearing a black strapless bare-back dress, with shoulder-length hair that was half tied and half draped.\n Her red lips were extremely lovely and lovely. A thin white mask covered the top half of her face. The camera zoomed in on her gently shut eyes. Her lashes were long and curly with sparkling stars.\n Below the stage, many people were captivated by this girl\u2019s bearing and mannerism.\n Some people were whispering.\n \u201cWho is the girl on stage with Liang Bo?\u201d\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t she look familiar?\u201d\n \u201cA little.\u201d\n But no matter how they guessed, they couldn\u2019t guess that woman\u2019s identity.\n Below the stage, Han Zhan sat in the crowd in a low profile. His gaze pierced through the beautiful lights and landed on Song Ci. His heart started racing again. They had already cohabited for half a year, but time had not worn away his fondness for her. He would still be moved by the charm she inadvertently released.\n That\u2019s my girl!\n Han Zhan clenched the seat tightly with both hands. He had the urge to rush onto the stage and carry Song Ci away, but he had to endure it. Bear with it. Soon, everyone would know that she\u2019s mine.\n The low, sobbing sound of the violin echoed throughout the entire venue. The sound of the violin had a demonic quality to it. It soothed one\u2019s restless heart and calmed one down. Song Ci\u2019s violin and Liang Bo\u2019s singing intertwined like sobs.\n [Like wind and rain, you can reach out your hand but can\u2019t grasp it]\n [Like me and you, so close yet so far apart in a kiss.]\n Liang Bo\u2019s voice sounded like he was slightly tipsy and had tears streaming down his face after drinking. There was a tinge of pain, a hint of unwillingness, and a stubborn determination to die without giving up. Song Ci\u2019s violin was like a thin whip, snapping the last bit of hope in his voice.\n This was the first time Han Zhan heard this song. No matter how ignorant he was of music, he knew that this song was very outstanding. He secretly took out his cell phone and entered the lyrics of this song. Only then did he know that this song\u2019s name was \u201cLike the Wind\u201d.\n Han Zhan searched again and saw the song introduction:\n \u201cLike the Wind\u201d\n Singer: Liang Bo.\n Composer: Cherry.\n Composer: Cherry.\n Cherry was Song Ci\u2019s stage name.\n Han Zhan was slightly stunned. The lyrics of this song were written by Song Ci?\n \u2014 Like wind and rain, one could reach out but not grasp onto it. Like me and you, so close yet so far apart in a kiss.\n Everything written by a person was based on her own experiences. How did Song Ci write this song? Could it be that Song Ci had already noticed my own struggle and hesitation?\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t bear to think further.\n He looked up at the girl on stage in a daze, his eyes filled with pain and guilt.\n At some point, Song Ci had already opened her eyes. She strutted over to Liang Bo in her high heels. Standing in front of him, Song Ci placed the violin in one hand by her lap and rested her other hand on his shoulder.\n Liang Bo wrapped his arms around Song Ci\u2019s waist. The two of them danced a sad tango under the accompaniment.\n Han Zhan automatically turned Liang Bo into a blurry mess of mosaics. All he could see was Song Ci\u2019s dancing figure. He knew that Song Ci was a vixen. She was lovable and adorable when she was chatty, elegant and lovely when she was quiet. How could there be such a contradictory and alluring woman in this world?\n At this moment, Han Zhan suddenly understood his father\u2019s obsession with Jiang Shiyu.\n There was a kind of love that was hard to control.\n After Song Ci and Liang Bo got off the stage, they changed their outfits and went to find their seats to watch the rest of the show.\n Song Ci took off her gown and changed into a white, embroidered regal gown. She appeared in the audience in a low-profile manner. No one associated her with that mysterious violinist on stage.\n Song Ci sat down at her own seat. She took out her cell phone and glanced at it. Yan Jiang had sent her a message a few minutes ago.\n Yan Jiang said, [You were very outstanding tonight.]\n Song Ci: [You recognized me?]\n Yan Jiang: [I will recognize you even if you turn to ashes.]\n There were several hundred people in the audience. Song Ci couldn\u2019t find Yan Jiang. She asked him: [Where are you?]\n Yan Jiang: [I am preparing backstage. There is a show tonight.]\n Song Ci: [Didn\u2019t you agree to leave the industry?]\n Yan Jiang: [How can I really just give up everything?]\n Song Ci didn\u2019t waste Yan Jiang\u2019s time.\n Backstage.\n Yan Jiang was wearing a grey, high-cut suit with dark brown hair and light makeup. He was also the most handsome man in the entertainment circles.\n Ah Lun was no longer in the entertainment circles, after Yan Jiang left the scene. He took the money Yan Jiang gave him and opened a photography studio. Knowing that Yan Jiang was going on stage tonight, Ah Lun came running errands for him again.\n Gazing at Yan Jiang\u2019s face, Ah Lun sighed. \u201cBrother Jiang, it\u2019s a huge loss for the entertainment circles now that you\u2019ve retired.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cBullsh*t. For someone like me who can\u2019t sing well and has terrible acting skills, it will be an insult to the entertainment circles if I don\u2019t leave the scene.\u201d Yan Jiang knew his own capabilities very well.\n He stood up and stared at the man\u2019s face in the mirror for a long while before saying, \u201cApart from this face, I am actually useless.\u201d\n Ah Lun pursed his lips.\n \u201cOh yes, there was a sudden change in personnel for your show. It was originally planned to be recited together with a few celebrities. This afternoon, the production team suddenly changed their plans and replaced those celebrities. They said that they wanted to invite several well-known entrepreneurs from Wangdong City to recite it.\u201d\n \u201cSo later, the people working with you will turn from Jiang Quan and the rest to mysterious business moguls.\u201d\n Hearing this, Yan Jiang was slightly surprised but didn\u2019t have any other thoughts. The production team was the real father. Yan Jiang was already used to having someone replaced at the last minute.\n Picking up the lines, Yan Jiang saw that the lines were all in alphabetical order. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cThis Y is me?\u201d\n \u201cYes, Brother Jiang, the order of your recital hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s still those same poems.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d As long as his order remained the same, Yan Jiang had no objections. Yan Jiang stared at the other letters with the words \u201cC, H, J\u201d and asked Ah Lun, \u201cThese are the three mysterious big shots?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Ah Lun frowned. \u201cI heard that this C is very likely to be Chuan Dong Group\u2019s Cheng Yanmo, Master Cheng. This J seems to be the young master of the Jiang Family, Jiang Guchuan. As for this H, no one really knows.\u201d\n If this news got out, it\u2019s very likely true.\n As for this mysterious H...\n Yan Jiang closed the script and closed his eyes to rest. \u201cCall me when it\u2019s time. I\u2019ll take a nap.\u201d Being a forensic doctor was even more tiring than being a celebrity. He didn\u2019t even have enough time to sleep and slept even less with Song Fei.\n No way. I\u2019ll resign when the internship period expired. It\u2019s too tiring to be a forensic doctor, I should just go back to being a celebrity.\n Thinking of this, Yan Jiang actually fell asleep in his chair. Ever since he had Song Fei by his side, Yan Jiang\u2019s bad habit of being unable to fall asleep was almost cured.\n An hour had passed when Ah Lun woke him up.\n Yan Jiang woke up and instinctively wanted to rub his eyes. Ah Lun quickly stopped him. \u201cDon\u2019t rub. Every eyelash of yours is fixed. Don\u2019t ruin the shape.\u201d\n Yan Jiang clicked his tongue and impatiently put on his hat. Holding his speech with one hand, he walked out of the dressing room.\n Yan Jiang arrived at the back of the stage. From afar, he could see three men, each taller than the other.\n The man on the left was wearing a light blue suit. His hairstyle was very exquisite and his skin was rather fair. He shouldn\u2019t be too old. Ah Lun told Yan Jiang, \u201cThe man on the left is the young master of the Jiang Family.\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked, \u201cWhich Jiang family?\u201d\n \u201cThe Jiang Family of Wonderful Medicine Group.\u201d\n Yan Jiang nodded. \u201cThat adopted son of Jiang Weimin, right? Jiang Guchuan?\u201d This Jiang Guchuan was an old acquaintance of Yan Jiang. About three years ago, at a dinner party, a sugar mommy took a fancy to Yan Jiang and wanted to sponsor him. He threw the card in front of him and asked him if he was calculating by the days and the months.\n With Yan Jiang\u2019s bad temper, he was so angry that he pinned her to the ground and gave her a good beating. He then stuffed the card into that sugar mommy\u2019s mouth and said, \u201cI count with my fists.\u201d\n That sugar mommy was a good friend of Jiang Guchuan.\n To be friends with such trash, Jiang Guchuan must not be a good person either. Yan Jiang continued walking forward lazily.\n \u201cThe man in the middle is Master Cheng.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n ]Yan Jiang wasn\u2019t familiar with Cheng Yanmo, but he had a deep impression of his brother, Cheng Ziang. It was that guy who hurt Song Ci in her previous life. As that bastard\u2019s elder brother, Cheng Yanmo must be nothing.\n Amongst the three collaborators, Yan Jiang labeled two of them as \u201cbad guys.\u201d\n As for the last one...\n Ah Lun had a strange look on his face. \u201cAs for the last tallest one,\u201d he said.\u201d He\u2019s\u2014\u201d Before Ah Lun could finish, the tall man turned.\n A handsome face and a pair of unique, deep blue-gray eyes. Who else could it be but that old fogey from Song Ci\u2019s family?\n Yan Jiang stopped in his tracks and pouted. He said to Ah Lun, who was beside him, \u201cI know this person. He\u2019s my brother-in-law.\u201d\n The 32-year-old Han Zhan was speechless.\n Hearing Yan Jiang\u2019s voice, Cheng Yanmo and Jiang Guchuan turned at the same time. Nodding at Yan Jiang, they turned around and stared at the script in their hands.\n They looked down on celebrities.\n Yan Jiang walked up to Han Zhan and said, \u201cMr. Han, Master Cheng is the president of Chuan Dong International and Mr. Jiang is the young master of the Wonderful Medicine Group. What about you?\u201d\n Han Zhan had never shown himself in public. Since he had come to the venue of the Spring Festival Gala today, he must have some ulterior motives.\n Han Zhan glanced at Yan Jiang playfully without batting an eyelid. He said calmly, \u201cCEO of Zeus Corporation.\u201d\n Yan Jiang pursed his lips and remained silent.\n Hearing this, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s eyes darkened while Jiang Guchuan widened his eyes. Jiang Guchuan looked at Han Zhan in astonishment, unable to conceal the shock in his eyes.\n Yan Jiang nudged Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBrother-in-law, you scared Mr. Jiang.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at Jiang Guchuan but didn\u2019t intend to speak to him. He quickly looked away.\n With just a casual glance from Han Zhan, Jiang Guchuan\u2019s heart was in turmoil. This man called Han Zhan is actually Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO? That legendary elusive boss?\n No wonder...\n No wonder that woman Song Ci would marry a handicap. With such a handicap filled with diamonds, which woman wouldn\u2019t want to marry him?\n Below the stage, the four men had different thoughts and didn\u2019t speak. Only a few seconds before they were about to go on stage did Cheng Yanmo tilt his head and say to Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, happy collaboration.\u201d\n ]Han Zhan nodded with a slightly serious expression. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go on stage.\u201d\n On stage, the host went off script and said, \u201cSince ancient times, natural disasters and man-made disasters are the most heartless. This year, a virus has spread across the entire world, and the number of deaths due to the virus has already reached XX million. Our country has a total of XX deaths. This is not just a cold number, but behind it are many living creatures! And families that should have been happy and reunited one after another!\u201d\n \u201cOn this day that should be a family reunion, how many families will never be able to return to their families? How many children have lose their parents?\u201d\n \u201cDisasters are heartless, but people are compassionate. Tonight, we are gathered together to deeply mourn those compatriots who died in the disaster.\u201d\n \u201cNext, let\u2019s invite the vice president of the Wonderful Pharmaceutical Group, Mr. Jiang Guchuan, the president of Chuan Dong Group, Mr. Chuan Dong Group. CEO of Zeus International, Mr. Han Zhan, and our country\u2019s young actor, Mr. Yan Jiang, to recite \u2018Rest Assured\u2019 for us!\u201d\n Everyone was stunned by the host\u2019s words.\n What?\n What did we just hear?\n Who is Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO?\n Han Zhan?\n Is it the Han Zhan we know?\n Many people suspected that they had heard wrongly!\n Song Ci was also dumbstruck. She was already feeling drowsy, but now she was completely jolted awake.\n Song Ci sat up straight and looked up to see four handsome men with broad shoulders and narrow waists striding side by side towards the stage.\n Handsome men were everywhere, but Song Ci only had eyes for Han Zhan.\n The other three were all wearing high-quality men\u2019s clothing. Only Han Zhan was wearing the white sweater that Song Ci had knitted for him. But this old fogey Han Zhan had his own aura. Even though he was wearing the cute, simple, and honest national treasure panda sweater, his aura was still devastating!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "204": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-205\n\n Chapter 204: Zeus International\u2019s Lady Boss  From left to right of the stage stood Jiang Guchuan, Cheng Yanmo, Han Zhan, and Yan Jiang. Their positions determined the order of their recital.\n Jiang Guchuan was a very elegant young man who exuded a scholarly aura. His light blue suit made him look young and handsome. The microphone magnified his gentle, good voice as he recited the eulogy beautifully.\n The second person to recite was Cheng Yanmo. Under those silver-framed glasses, Cheng Yanmo looked like a low-profile and reserved person. Unlike Jiang Guchuan\u2019s gentle voice, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s voice was very cold, like cool spring water dripping on smooth stone, sonorous and cold.\n But tonight, Cheng Yanmo wasn\u2019t the focus of everyone\u2019s attention. The person that everyone was really focused on was the man standing at the third position. That man was nearly 1.9 meters tall and even with a white handmade sweater, he didn\u2019t seem to be able to conceal his dominance.\n After being discharged from the military for so many years, Han Zhan was still used to having a buzz cut. Under that buzz cut, his brows were high and sharp. Han Zhan had a pair of thick, black, straight brows. From afar, he looked very sharp, but he also had a pair of gentle blue eyes that were deep and tender when gazing into the camera.\n In terms of facial features and looks, the four people on stage all had their own style. But in the profile captured by the camera, Han Zhan\u2019s facial lines had a three-dimensional feel to them, which made him appear even more imposing.\n \u201cIt\u2019s late at night. Listen, which family\u2019s child is crying for their mother...\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s voice was deep and magnetic. The moment he spoke, a young girl excitedly covered her ears and thought to herself: My ears are getting pregnant.\n If her ears could get pregnant, Song Ci would have already given birth to a football team for Han Zhan.\n They had only heard Han Zhan\u2019s focused recital. Only she had heard him lean on her back in the dark of the night, sighing in satisfaction. Only she had heard his sobbing voice.\n Six minutes later, the four handsome men got off the stage in a low-profile manner. The audience was still whispering about Han Zhan\u2019s identity, looks, and voice.\n The party ended at 12.15am.\n Song Ci waited for everyone else to leave, before standing up with her bag.\n Turning around, Song Ci saw Han Zhan standing at the entrance. He was still wearing the panda sweater that she had knitted herself. When he looked at her, his eyes were gentle. After making a mistake, Han Zhan didn\u2019t even dare to look straight at Song Ci.\n He wanted to approach her but didn\u2019t have the courage to do so.\n Song Ci lifted the sides of her dress and walked up to Han Zhan. She was wearing high heels, but still had to tilt her head slightly to look straight into Han Zhan\u2019s eyes.\n Song Ci said, \u201cAfter tonight, everyone will know who you are.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s red lips and seductive eyes. He said, \u201cNo matter who I am, I am still your husband.\u201d He carefully reached out his right hand and gently grabbed Song Ci\u2019s left hand with his leather glove.\n Song Ci could shake off Han Zhan\u2019s left hand expressionlessly, but she would never be able to bear to do so.\n Han Zhan knew very well how much Song Ci loved him. He tried to get close to Song Ci, lowered his head slightly, leaned close to her ear, and said in a low voice, \u201cBaby Ci, the floor of the study is so hard. Tonight, I want to go back to my room to sleep.\u201d\n No one knew that the grand and domineering CEO Han was sleeping on the study floor every night.\n After a few days of cold war, Song Ci\u2019s anger had mostly subsided. She said, \u201cYou can sleep in the bed, but don\u2019t sleep with me.\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows, slightly disappointed, but quickly pulled himself together. \u201cOkay!\u201d\n The two of them held hands and walked out. Just as they were about to reach the exit, Han Zhan pulled Song Ci to basement one. \u201cThere might be reporters outside. Let\u2019s go to the underground carpark.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s performance tonight was equivalent to announcing his identity to everyone.\n Everyone could tell that Zeus Corporation was about to surpass Chuan Dong International and become the top corporation in the country. Meanwhile, Han Zhan was the center of attention. Many media outlets were mobilized tonight to interview Han Zhan.\n The two of them arrived at the underground carpark and got into Liang Bo\u2019s car.\n Liang Bo had already received the news that Mr. Han was taking his car to avoid the reporters.\n After Han Zhan and Song Ci boarded the car, Liang Bo immediately passed the message he had just received to Han Zhan. \u201cMr. Han, look at this photo. There is indeed a group of reporters blocking the door.\u201d\n Han Zhan casually glanced at Liang Bo\u2019s cell phone. That photo should have been taken by Liang Bo\u2019s manager. There were indeed more than 10 armed reporters crowded at the exit.\n Song Ci said, \u201cThat was close. Luckily we went to the basement.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n Liang Bo was sitting in the passenger seat and his assistant was in charge of driving. Han Zhan\u2019s eyes scanned Song Ci and Liang Bo repeatedly, but neither of them noticed Han Zhan\u2019s expression, as one was browsing Weibo and the other was dozing off.\n \u201cLiang Bo.\u201d\n The boy who was browsing Weibo suddenly heard Han Zhan call him. He turned and looked at Han Zhan, his curly hair covering his sparkling eyes. \u201cMr. Han, what instructions do you have?\u201d\n Han Zhan turned to look at Song Ci who was already asleep and asked softly, \u201cMr. Liang, our Song Ci is very beautiful, right?\u201d His voice sounded very soft and gentle, but his gray-blue eyes seemed to be covered in a layer of ice.\n Liang Bo was no longer that dumbass from before. Han Zhan\u2019s words sounded off, but he understood what Han Zhan meant. Liang Bo had a strong will to live. He nodded and said, \u201cOf course Mrs. Han is good-looking. She really matches Mr. Han very well.\u201d\n Seeing that Liang Bo understood his hint, Han Zhan\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look so gloomy anymore and turned slightly brighter.\n \u201cSince you know she is Mrs. Han, you should know how to avoid gossip in private.\u201d God knew how frustrated he felt when he saw Song Ci and Liang Bo leaning their heads against each other and smiling radiantly in Bei Zhan\u2019s photo.\n Liang Bo immediately thought of the photo they took this afternoon. He hurriedly raised his right hand and swore. \u201cMr. Han, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely avoid arousing suspicion in the future!\u201d\n [\u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t speak further.\n The journey was uneventful. When they arrived at the entrance of Han Zhan\u2019s estate, Liang Bo\u2019s assistant parked the car.\n Han Zhan alighted and stood beside the car to put on Yu Han\u2019s windbreaker. He then went to the other side and opened the door for Song Ci.\n Han Zhan bent over, picked up Song Ci\u2019s evening bag, stuffed that small and exquisite bag into the pocket of his wide windbreaker, and gently hugged Song Ci in his arms as they got out of the car.\n Liang Bo watched as Han Zhan carried Song Ci away. He said, \u201cHeng Heng, why do you think this man is so scary?\u201d\n The assistant rubbed Heng Heng\u2019s arms and said, \u201cBo-er, the muscles on my arms are all tensed up when I drove the whole way. This Mr. Han is so scary, but he doesn\u2019t look like a scary person at all.\u201d\n Liang Bo shook his head. \u201cWhat do you know? This is called aura. What is aura? It can kill without leaving a trace!\u201d\n Heng Heng hurriedly started the car and left this troublesome place.\n \u201cMr. Han, you\u2019re back so late?\u201d The security guard recognized Han Zhan and saw that he was carrying someone and couldn\u2019t open the door easily, so he took the initiative to open the door for Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan nodded and thanked the security officer, before carrying Song Ci back to their villa. Song Ci was in a deep sleep and didn\u2019t wake up at all on the way home. Han Zhan had no choice but to wake her up at the door because he had to open it.\n Song Ci woke up the moment Han Zhan placed her on the ground. She stood with her back against the wall, wearing a long black windbreaker. Her lazing hair and gorgeous red lips exuded a sense of \u201clust\u201d.\n Han Zhan stared at Song Ci for a while, before taking out his keys to open the door.\n Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cLet\u2019s change to another one. This kind of lock is still not convenient.\u201d\n Song Ci lifted her head lazily and glanced sideways at Han Zhan. She then looked down again, as if she didn\u2019t want to acknowledge him and even glanced at him with disdain.\n Han Zhan opened the door and turned on the lights before gesturing for Song Ci to enter.\n Song Ci entered the house holding her dress. Her high heels made thuds on the floor.\n She didn\u2019t change her shoes and the soles weren\u2019t dirty, so she just entered the living room.\n Han Zhan changed his shoes and looked up to see Song Ci standing in the middle of the living room removing her jacket.\n The black jacket slid off her fair shoulders and the hem of the jacket fell to the ground. She lifted her head slightly and let her long hair fall behind her shoulders. Under the light, Song Ci\u2019s skin was so fair that it glowed. Han Zhan stared at her and couldn\u2019t help but swallow several times.\n He looked down and hid his lustful eyes, afraid of scaring Song Ci.\n Han Zhan bent down to pick up Song Ci\u2019s jacket. He looked up and saw Song Ci staring at him with narrowed eyes. Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cHan Zhan.\u201d\n She lifted her head slightly and leaned close to Han Zhan\u2019s face. Her breath landed on Han Zhan\u2019s ear and it felt slightly itchy. Song Ci said, \u201cHave you ever thought that if we break up one day, not only will I have dinner with Liang Bo, I might also have dinner with Zhang Bo and Li Bo. Not only will we have dinner together, we will also kiss and...\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, Han Zhan grabbed her throat with his left hand.\n That hand was grabbing Song Ci\u2019s fair and slender throat. Just a little bit of strength and it would break.\n Han Zhan placed his thumb on Song Ci\u2019s chin and lifted her throat with his left hand. Song Ci was forced to look up at Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes had turned red at some point. He suddenly lowered his head and bit Song Ci. His actions were rough and his eyes were mischievous and stubborn.\n Song Ci stumbled backwards as Han Zhan pushed her. She leaned against the cold wall of the television.\n Song Ci saw a wolf-like ferocity in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes.\n Han Zhan lifted her legs and placed them on his lap.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart turned cold.\n She thought that if Han Zhan continued, she would never forgive him again. Just when Song Ci thought that Han Zhan would lose control completely, he suddenly stopped.\n Holding Song Ci\u2019s face with both hands, Han Zhan\u2019s thick left thumb pressed against the side of Song Ci\u2019s eyes. He lowered his head and leaned against Song Ci\u2019s forehead. Han Zhan apologized humbly. \u201cSong Ci, I apologize. I shouldn\u2019t have lied to you. I shouldn\u2019t be so despicable. You\u2019re right. Regardless of whether it\u2019s loving someone or using someone, I should be honest.\u201d\n \u201cBrother Han has disappointed you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n That \u201cBrother Han has disappointed you\u201d hit Song Ci\u2019s heart.\n Tears suddenly streamed down Song Ci\u2019s face.\n \u201cHan Zhan, do you know how good you are to me? I always thought that if there really was an angel in this world, that angel would definitely be the Han Zhan in my heart.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I knew of your despicable thoughts, the angel in my heart collapsed. Han Zhan, I admire you so much, how can you be so evil? You can clearly use me, but how can you be a man if you deceive my feelings!\u201d Han Zhan really disappointed Song Ci.\n Song Ci\u2019s words were like a hammer, pinning Han Zhan to the sofa, unable to move.\n His mind went blank.\n She said she treated him like an angel.\n But he personally destroyed that angel.\n \u201cHan Zhan!\u201d Song Ci grabbed the lapels of Han Zhan\u2019s sweater, buried her head in his arms, and cried. \u201cHan Zhan, can you return my angel to me?\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan\u2019s heart nearly broke.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Baby Ci. I\u2019m sorry. I was blinded by evil intentions. I swear I won\u2019t lie to you again.\u201d Han Zhan carried Song Ci to the sofa and sat down. He hugged her like he was carrying a child. \u201cCan you forgive this despicable me? Just give me this one chance, alright?\u201d\n Song Ci remained silent and upset in his arms.\n That night, Song Ci allowed Han Zhan to return to his room to sleep. Lying on the familiar bed that was filled with Song Ci\u2019s scent, Han Zhan\u2019s tense nerves finally relaxed.\n Han Zhan quickly fell asleep beside Song Ci.\n The next morning, Han Zhan woke up for his morning workout and was about to go to work when his cell phone suddenly rang. It was a message.\n A subordinate would never send Han Zhan a message. If there was anything to report, he would just call and say it directly. Han Zhan opened the message box and saw that the message was from Song Ci. He looked up at the second floor in shock. Song Ci might still be sleeping in her room and he didn\u2019t see her.\n Han Zhan opened the message box and saw Song Ci: [Whether I will forgive you depends on your performance.]\n Han Zhan\u2019s brows instantly curved.\n He went to the door of the master bedroom and knocked. Inside, Song Ci didn\u2019t make a sound, but Han Zhan knew that she was awake. He told her, \u201cI am going to work now and shouldn\u2019t be working overtime tonight. I cooked codfish and seaweed dumplings. Hurry up and eat them.\u201d\n After Han Zhan left, Song Ci hurriedly opened the door and went downstairs.\n There was indeed a bowl of dumplings on the kitchen stove. Song Ci carried the dumplings to the dining room and browsed Weibo as she ate.\n As expected, # Zeus International CEO Han Zhan had already become the hottest topic on Weibo. Song Ci\u2019s private message had exploded, and her fans and non-fans had all left messages asking her about the relationship between Han Zhan and Zeus International.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t even be bothered to explain. After thinking for a moment, she changed the introduction to her Weibo account. Originally, Song Ci\u2019s biography was: Fashion Guru, a consultant for Murphy\u2019s Style magazine.\n At 8am on the 28th of December, all the netizens who followed Song Ci discovered that she had updated her profile on Weibo with only nine words:\n Zeus International\u2019s Lady Boss, Song Ci.\n Those words were worth hundreds of millions.\n On this day, Song Ci\u2019s WeChat messages were being bombarded by her friends. Feeling that it was too noisy, she tossed her cell phone aside and stayed home to watch television the entire day.\n It was almost noon when someone suddenly knocked on the door.\n Song Ci peeked through the peephole and saw that it was Uncle Zhong. She hurriedly opened the door. \u201cUncle Zhong, it\u2019s you?\u201d She invited Zhong Buhui into the house and poured him some hot tea.\n \u201cUncle Zhong, why are you here today?\u201d\n Zhong Buhui told Song Ci, \u201cIt\u2019s like this, Song Ci. My son bought a new house two years ago and just moved into a new house this year. He brought me over to spend the new year with him. I haven\u2019t spent the new year with him for several years already. He just moved into a new house, so I want to spend the new year with him.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing!\u201d Since Uncle Zhong was going to spend the new year at his son\u2019s place, Grandpa would be alone. Song Ci understood Zhong Buhui\u2019s intentions. Without waiting for Zhong Buhui to tell her the reason, Song Ci said, \u201cUncle Zhong, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t worry about Grandpa. Brother Han and I are going to spend the new year at the villa.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui knew that Song Ci was an intelligent and good girl. Hearing her words, Zhong Buhui\u2019s smile widened.\n \u201cThat\u2019s great. Old Master originally wanted to invite you guys over for the new year, but was afraid that you youngsters would have your own plans, so he didn\u2019t call. But he bought meat early and specially reserved a small room for you to smoke bacon and sausages. You are in for a treat this year!\u201d\n Song Ci thought of how passionate Han Aoyu was when he fed her and felt slightly worried about her weight in the future.\n After sending Zhong Buhui off, the part-time helper also arrived on time to clean up the place.\n It was almost the new year and today was the last major cleanup before the new year. They had to go to the old town to welcome newbies and clean up the dirt. As workload was rather heavy today, the part-time helper brought her high school daughter along to help out.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t just sit there. She also put on a face mask and took a vacuum cleaner to clean up the mess. The cleaning took two hours. It was hard to imagine that a house that was cleaned every three days could actually be so dirty.\n Song Ci took off her face mask and washed her hands. She called out to the auntie and her daughter who were preparing to leave. \u201cAuntie Shu, wait a moment. I will prepare some fruit for you two. You can bring it back for your family to eat.\u201d\n The auntie and Song Ci were old friends. Knowing that Song Ci was kind and polite, Auntie Shu agreed.\n They would be returning to the villa in the afternoon the day after tomorrow. There were still many fruits in the fridge. Song Ci didn\u2019t want to waste them and gave them to Auntie Shu.\n \u201cHere, Auntie Shu.\u201d\n Auntie Shu was shocked. \u201cSo many?\u201d\n \u201cNot much. We are going to visit Grandpa for the new year this year. We have a lot of fruits at home and can\u2019t finish them all. Auntie Shu, take them back and don\u2019t waste them.\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Auntie Shu didn\u2019t continue to refuse.\n Song Ci took out another red packet from her bag and gave it to Auntie Zhong\u2019s daughter. \u201cYou\u2019re called Xiao Lan, right? It\u2019s almost the new year and I\u2019ve prepared a red packet for you. Take it. I hope you can take the college entrance examination next year and get into a good university.\u201d\n Xiaolan was slightly shocked. She didn\u2019t take the red packet but turned to look at Auntie Shu. Seeing that her mother nodded, Xiaolan accepted the red packet, thanked Song Ci, and left with her mother.\n Song Ci leaned against the door and watched as Auntie Shu and Xiao Lan left together. She suddenly thought of Du Tingting. Du Tingting had also given her a big red packet on her first year at the Mu Family residence.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart ached at the thought of Du Tingting. She really wanted to pay her respects to Du Tingting, but she didn\u2019t even have a tombstone after her death.\n \u2013\n Zeus Corporation only went on holiday on the 29th of December. Han Zhan turned off the lights in his office and walked down the stairs. Song Ci was waiting for him at the entrance of the building. Han Zhan didn\u2019t go to the underground carpark but walked out of the main hall on the first level.\n As he walked out of the lift lobby, all the employees stopped in their tracks and nodded respectfully at him. \u201cHappy New Year, CEO Han.\u201d\n \u201cCEO Han, you\u2019ve knocked off? Happy New Year!\u201d\n \u201cCEO Han, Happy New Year!\u201d\n Han Zhan was still not used to being called CEO Han by so many people all of a sudden, but he kept a straight face and looked calm and domineering. \u201cMmm, Happy New Year.\u201d He quickened his pace and walked towards the exit of the company.\n There was no need to search intentionally, as Han Zhan immediately saw Song Ci.\n Song Ci was wearing a white blouse paired with a black A-line skirt and a dark purple windbreaker. Her figure was graceful and sexy.\n She was wearing aviator shades and standing under the sunlight with her long legs crossed elegantly. Her 8cm high heels accentuated her long, slender legs. Song Ci was leaning against a red McLaren sports car, as beautiful as a movie star.\n Seeing that Han Zhan had come down, Song Ci took off her aviator glasses and patted them on her palms. She lifted her chin slightly and looked at Han Zhan. She asked him, \u201cHow is it? Do I have the aura of Zeus International\u2019s lady boss?\u201d In order to enhance her aura, she even specially took out her mysterious aviator shades.\n In front of Song Ci, CEO Han couldn\u2019t help feeling amused.\n He walked over to Song Ci, reached out his index finger, hooked away Song Ci\u2019s sunglasses, and put them on again. Staring at that beautiful porcelain-white face in his palm, Han Zhan suddenly bent down and kissed Song Ci on the lips.\n Knowing that Song Ci had put on lipstick, Han Zhan kissed her very gently. \u201cLady boss, you\u2019re so beautiful today.\u201d\n The lady boss blushed slightly after being kissed by the boss. Rubbing the sports car behind her, Song Ci gazed at the clear blue sky, cleared her throat, and said, \u201cWell, the car is not bad. I like it.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI specially chose it for you. How can the lady boss not have a standard sports car? The car plate is SC811. It\u2019s Song Ci and Song Ci\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help pursing her lips into a smile. \u201cNot bad, quite easy to remember.\u201d Her heart was already blooming with joy, but she still maintained a calm expression.\n \u201cAs long as you remember it well.\u201d Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cWho will drive?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI drove over. You can drive back.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The sports car was a two-seater. Han Zhan opened the door and was about to get into the car when he realized that a pair of flat sports shoes was placed at the foot of the driver\u2019s seat. He imagined Song Ci parking the car under the Imperial Dragon Building, hiding in the car, taking off her sports shoes and changing into high heels. A hint of a smile appeared in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to drive in heels. Just leave your sports shoes in the car. Remember to change your shoes when driving in the future.\u201d Han Zhan stroked Song Ci\u2019s soft black hair and couldn\u2019t help praising her. \u201cBaby Ci is so obedient.\u201d\n Song Ci slapped Han Zhan\u2019s hand away.\n It was said that after a fight, a married couple\u2019s relationship would improve. Song Ci could feel that Han Zhan seemed to dote on her even more than before. Whenever Song Ci took a second look at anything in the supermarket, Han Zhan would directly put it into the cart.\n In the end, they bought items that filled three trolleys and the staff even had to help them bring the items to the basement. The container for the sports car was too small and couldn\u2019t hold them all. In the end, Han Zhan called for an online taxi and specially got the driver to bring the items home.\n At night, Song Ci specially went downstairs and gave Jiang Bi some fruits and chocolates. She felt that girls should all like this. Jiang Bi accepted the gift and the next morning, Song Ci opened the door to see a box of... lots of yummy foods.\n Four words were written on the package:\n Thank you.\n Jiang Bi.\n Song Ci raised her brows. My neighbor is rather adorable.\n Yakult was a good drink, cheap and tasty.\n Song Ci brought the items into the house. She opened a can of Yakult and had just finished half of it, when Han Zhan reached out and snatched it away. \u201cWhy are you drinking something cold in the winter?\u201d Han Zhan threw the items into the dustbin. After a while, he walked over with a cup of warm water and stuffed it into Song Ci\u2019s hand.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t retort and just drank the bland warm water.\n Song Ci had not had warm water for a few days and actually missed this taste a lot.\n After breakfast, Han Zhan called Song Ci into the study. Before entering, Song Ci imagined many scenarios. She thought Han Zhan was going to give her a red packet for the new year or a New Year present. But when they arrived at the study, Han Zhan only handed her a piece of ink.\n \u201cBaby Ci, do you know how to grind ink?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s smile froze as she held that piece of ink. \u201cGrind ink?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n Song Ci stood by the table and started to grind the ink. Han Zhan spread out a piece of red paper, took out a brush, took off his glove on his right hand, took off his prosthetic fingers, and pinched the brush with his thumb and ring finger. He dabbed the tip of the brush in ink and wrote a sentence on the red paper:\n Peace and prosperity everywhere.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBrother Han\u2019s handwriting is so good.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cMy grandmother hired a teacher to teach me.\u201d\n \u201cBrother Han\u2019s teacher must be a great scholar.\u201d\n ]\u201dMmm, Master Cheng An is my calligraphy teacher.\u201d\n \u201cI know Master Cheng An. His calligraphy skills are indeed very good. I remember that five years ago, his calligraphy book was auctioned off for a high price of three million yuan.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that Old Master has already passed away and I didn\u2019t have the fortune to meet him.\u201d Song Ci was very good at writing with a fountain pen, especially with its slim golden body, but she was not good at calligraphy.\n \u201cTeacher left very peacefully. When one is old, one will eventually have to leave.\u201d Han Zhan was very open-minded. He told Song Ci, \u201cThere\u2019s a calligraphy expert beside you. If you want to learn, I can teach you.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Song Ci gave a cheeky smile. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll overtake you.\u201d\n \u201cThat will depend on your capabilities.\u201d\n As he spoke, Han Zhan placed the couplet aside and placed it on a rack to dry. He then wrote on another piece of paper, \u201cMay the weather be pleasant\u201d.\n Before writing the header, Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat should I write in the header?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled faintly. \u201cWhat else could it be? The country is prosperous and the people are safe.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, you have the most glib tongue. I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d\n Han Zhan wrote down the words \u201csafe and sound\u201d before putting down the brush. He started to put on his prosthetic fingers and said, \u201cBaby Ci, I\u2019ll leave our couplets to you. Take this pair to the villa halfway up the hill later.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci was not good at writing but she knew how to do it. Han Zhan stood aside and saw Song Ci writing on the first half:\n Mountains are good, water is fine and wives are excellent.\n He raised his brows but didn\u2019t stop Song Ci from performing. He thought to himself that Song Ci\u2019s handwriting looked rather decent.\n On the later half, Song Ci wrote:\n Have silver, have money and have treasures.\n Overhead \u2014\n Song Ci knew how to give birth.\n After reading it, Han Zhan applauded. \u201cWell written!\u201d\n Song Ci copied Han Zhan and placed the couplets on the bookshelf, and found something to hang them up to dry.\n After the couplets were completed, Song Ci eagerly pasted her own couplets on the door. She was so bold because she knew that no one else would see this house. If someone really came, Song Ci wouldn\u2019t have pasted them on the door.\n Without having lunch, she brought along the couplets and some daily necessities she had bought yesterday and went to the villa.\n At the Cheng Family residence on the road, Song Ci gazed out the window at the Cheng Family. The Lunar New Year in the Cheng Family was very grand and very disciplined. Song Ci had spent five to six years in the Cheng Family and none of them were happy or relaxed.\n Seeing that she was looking at the gates of the Cheng Family, Han Zhan freed up a hand to press down on Song Ci\u2019s head, straightened her face, and made her look at the forest ahead. \u201cWhy are you looking at other people\u2019s houses? Look at your own house.\u201d\n Song Ci stared at her villa and smiled.\n The Old Master woke up very early. Although Zhong Buhui had gone to visit his son for the new year, the two guards were still by his side. The yard of the villa was clean and red lanterns were hung under the eaves.\n ]The moment Song Ci alighted from the car, she could smell the fragrance of food.\n Hearing the sound of a car, Han Aoyu walked out of the house. He was wearing a green army coat and a winter hat. He looked no different from any old man in the village. Song Ci suspected that the Han Family operated a wholesale military coat factory, as Han Zhan also had several similar coats.\n Han Aoyu saw Han Zhan and said to him, \u201cI\u2019 m just waiting for your couplet.\u201d\n \u201cI brought it.\u201d\n Han Zhan and Song Ci pasted the couplets together. Han Aoyu stared at the words \u201cthe nation is prosperous and the people are safe\u201d and his eyes became nostalgic. They had experienced many tumultuous times in their lives and \u201cthe nation is prosperous and the people are safe\u201d was his lifelong dream.\n Some people died during tumultuous times, some survived tumultuous times, but some dreamed of orchestrating a disaster during peaceful times. Only those who had lived a wandering life would know the value of peace.\n Han Aoyu laughed out loud and patted Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder. He said, \u201cZhanzhan, the people of your generation haven\u2019t experienced our sufferings, but you must remember that everyone has a responsibility to rise and fall in this world! You are the high and mighty CEO today, but don\u2019t forget that you came from the village and your grandfather is the son of a farmer.\u201d\n \u201cYou need to understand something even more. The fact that China produced the richest man in the world and that the richest man in the world came from China has a totally different meaning. If you don\u2019t go into battle to protect the country, you should be a loyal supporter. If you bring the people to prosperity together, aren\u2019t you also a devoted supporter?\u201d\n Han Zhan listened humbly. He could understand his grandfather\u2019s good intentions. Staring at his grandfather\u2019s aging face, Han Zhan\u2019s heart softened. He told Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t worry. I will always remember that I am Chinese.\u201d\n Han Aoyu looked at his grandson who was half a head taller than him and nodded in satisfaction.\n \u201cAh, I still have pork trotters stewed in the pot. I\u2019ll go take a look. Song Lass, you and Zhanzhan come and help too.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Looking at her grandfather\u2019s back view, Song Ci frowned. She said, \u201cI heard from Uncle Zhong that Grandpa\u2019s sleep quality has deteriorated a lot this month.\u201d Once an old man started having insomnia, his health would be greatly affected.\n Han Aoyu was already over 80 years old and his life was about to come to an end. What he said today was also giving his final words.\n Zhong Buhui would regularly report to Han Zhan about the changes in Old Master\u2019s daily life and daily living arrangements. How could Han Zhan not know that Grandpa\u2019s health was no longer as good as before? \u201cLet\u2019s go and help him prepare the reunion meal.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n They had made a total of 12 dishes for this reunion dinner. Han Aoyu was a very particular old man. All the dishes he made were traditional Chinese New Year dishes. Song Ci stared at the table full of fish and meat, feeling very moved.\n She poured herself a cup of coconut juice and half a glass of red wine for Han Aoyu. \u201cHere, Grandpa. Song Ci wishes you a healthy year!\u201d\n Han Aoyu waved his hand. \u201cAnd I am dying.\u201d It was a taboo for an old man to say such things at the reunion dinner table, but Han Aoyu was an open-minded person. He pointed at Song Ci\u2019s stomach and said, \u201cI am looking forward to seeing your child this year!\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned and later smiled. \u201cI will fight for it!\u201d\n Han Aoyu laughed out loud.\n After the three of them had their reunion dinner, Han Aoyu gave Song Ci a set of car keys.\n Song Ci was dumbstruck. She thought that Grandpa was going to send her a car as a New Year\u2019s gift? As she thought so, she heard Han Aoyu say, \u201cLass Song, go and open the car. There\u2019s a surprise.\u201d\n Song Ci carried a sense of anticipation as she ran to the garage to open the trunk of Old Master Han\u2019s Aoyu Number 1. When she saw the contents of the trunk, Song Ci hurriedly called Han Zhan over.\n \u201cBrother Han, Brother Han, come quickly!\u201d\n Han Zhan thought that something had happened. He didn\u2019t even change his shoes and just ran to the garage in his slippers. Seeing the fireworks in the trunk, Han Zhan felt somewhat helpless. \u201cJust this?\u201d\n \u201cHow many years has it been since I last played? I haven\u2019t had it since the city banned fireworks.\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly asked Han Zhan to move the fireworks into the courtyard. They arranged them into a heart shape. Song Ci asked Han Zhan to draw the fuse. She held a lighter and walked up to light one.\n Song Ci was very brave. She lit one and went for the second. Han Zhan watched fearfully from the side, afraid that Song Ci would be hurt by the fireworks. But Song Ci had always been lucky. She didn\u2019t get hurt even when she lit all the fireworks.\n Song Ci ran to Han Zhan\u2019s side and watched the fireworks with him.\n Han Aoyu stood behind the window of his room, staring at his grandchild and his granddaughter-in-law in the courtyard with a very loving expression. Finally, Zhanzhan also has someone to love and dote on\u2014I can finally be at ease.\n This was the first time Song Ci and Han Zhan stayed over at the villa. The bedsheets were all new and the house was very quiet. However, Song Ci was still not used to it. She had spoken to Han Zhan for a long time and was still wide awake even after midnight.\n Han Zhan saw that Song Ci was in good spirits and asked her, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sleep?\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan suddenly turned over and pressed against her. \u201cYou said you wanted to have a daughter[1] today.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it good to have a daughter?\u201d\n \u201cNot bad...\u201d Han Zhan pressed a few times on Song Ci\u2019s shoulder.\u201d It\u2019s quite cold. \u201d\n \u2013\n On the morning of the first day of the new year, Song Ci got out of bed after a good night\u2019s sleep. She went downstairs and saw Han Zhan sitting on a small wooden stool in the courtyard, holding a knife in his hand and chopping bamboo. Song Ci went over to take a look but didn\u2019t see what Han Zhan was doing.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI have nothing to do and intend to make a crib.\u201d\n \u201cYou even know how to make a crib?\u201d\n \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be difficult.\u201d\n Han Zhan did as he said and spent the entire day on that thing. Song Ci had nothing to do, so she stayed in the study to read a book. She discovered that Han Zhan also used to read old Mr. Jin Yong\u2019s books. Song Ci flipped open a book with eight pages in the sky and saw a slightly yellowed piece of paper covering the first page. It recorded Han Zhan\u2019s personal views on this book.\n Han Zhan wrote:\n There was only one word to describe Duan Yu\u2014 jerk.\n He was the most unfaithful man I had ever met. He loved every woman he met. My grandmother could kill a bunch of men like him with a shovel.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help laughing.\n She didn\u2019t expect Han Zhan to be so adorable when he was young. She had completely lost interest in the novels on the shelves and was instead interested in Han Zhan\u2019s comments.\n Song Ci read several books in a row and couldn\u2019t stop laughing. In the end, her stomach hurt slightly.\n After reading six to seven comments in a row, Song Ci took out another book. She opened it and was shocked by the photo inside. To be precise, it was the child\u2019s eyes that scared Song Ci.\n The child\u2019s eyes were as malicious and cold as a venomous snake. Song Ci\u2019s blood ran cold at his dark stare.\n She took a deep breath before looking down at the child in the photo.\n It was a little boy without a shirt. The little boy was sitting on the bed. His arms were covered in needle holes, like ants sticking to them. Some even had scars.\n How much of a beast must he be to treat a child like this!\n There were several photos below the photo, all of which showed the same main character. Each photo showed the main character with scars. Song Ci could vaguely guess this person\u2019s identity and her heart ached terribly.\n Below the photo was the patient\u2019s information form. As it had been too long, there was a bug bite mark on the medical record.\n Patient: Han Zhan.\n Age: 6 +\n Illness: Due to frequent injections of toxins, the patient is mentally unstable, has poor physical development, has suicidal masochistic tendencies, and is initially diagnosed with severe depression and autism...\n Startled, Song Ci closed the medical record.\n [1] Song Ci wrote \u2018treasure\u2019 in the couplet, which had the same character as precious daughter in Chinese\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "205": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-206\n\n Chapter 205: How Huge Was Du Xueyan\u2019s Trauma?  Song Ci tossed the medical record onto the table, got up, walked to the windowsill of the study, and sat down.\n Song Ci drew the curtains and pushed open the glass window. Han Zhan heard the sound of the window being opened and glanced up.\n Seeing Song Ci sitting on the windowsill, Han Zhan raised his brows and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Baby Ci? You didn\u2019t find any book you liked?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head.\n Staring at Han Zhan\u2019s bright and handsome face, the face of that little boy in the photo surfaced in Song Ci\u2019s mind again. Song Ci\u2019s heart ached badly. She discreetly clenched her fists and smiled at Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, who do you think our daughter will look like in future?\u201d\n Han Zhan replied without thinking. \u201cLike you, of course.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re good-looking.\u201d Han Zhan was speaking the truth. He felt that girls should look like Song Ci.\n \u201cWhat about her character?\u201d\n Han Zhan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s good if she takes after you.\u201d\n Song Ci asked casually, \u201cWhat was your character like when you were young, Brother Han?\u201d\n Brother Han was using a short knife to smooth the thin bamboo. Hearing this, he said without raising his head, \u201cI was more mischievous. Boys are all like that.\u201d\n Actually, he totally didn\u2019t know what a normal little boy should be like. It was just that he always heard others say that boys were more mischievous. In order to reassure his grandfather, Han Zhan purposely did some naughty things to reassure him.\n Han Zhan was always able to stir up some trouble.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart bled at Han Zhan\u2019s nonchalant reply. If she hadn\u2019t seen that medical record, Song Ci would have really believed Han Zhan\u2019s words. But after seeing those photos, Song Ci could see that little boy\u2019s eyes were filled with despair and pain the moment she closed her eyes.\n Han Zhan\u2019s childhood must have been very difficult. That was why he hated his father and her mother so much.\n Han Zhan, who lived in hell, had tormented himself countless times. He was probably more willing to die than live. That was why he hated Jiang Shiyu. If not for Jiang Shiyu, Edward wouldn\u2019t have provoked Han Mulan and Han Zhan wouldn\u2019t exist in this world...\n Jiang Shiyu was the source of Han Zhan\u2019s pain.\n At this point, the knot in Song Ci\u2019s heart that had been tied tightly for so many days was suddenly untied.\n She closed the window and returned to her desk. She opened the medical record again and patiently finished reading the medical record.\n \u2013\n The sun was shining brightly in the courtyard. Han Aoyu brewed a pot of tea for himself and placed it on the table. He then sat down on a recliner with a thin blanket covering his body. He closed his eyes and basked in the sun.\n Song Ci\u2019s flats made a soft sound on the pavement.\n Han Aoyu narrowed his eyes slightly as he stared at Song Ci walking over from the end of the garden. Today, Song Ci was wearing a festive red turtleneck sweater and a pair of black jeans. She looked youthful and beautiful.\n Han Aoyu gazed at Song Ci as time flashed back to 33 years ago. In that year, the 23-year-old Jiang Shiyu also wore a red shirt and stood on the deck of the cruise ship. The bullet pierced through Jiang Shiyu\u2019s abdomen, and the blood dyed that red sweater dark red.\n \u201cGrandpa.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s pleasant, young voice brought Han Aoyu back to reality.\n Han Aoyu pointed to a wooden chair at the side and said to Song Ci, \u201cThe sun is pretty good today. Song Ci, accompany me to get some sunlight.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci sat down and bent over to pour herself a cup of tea. She took a whiff of the fragrance of the tea before taking a sip.\n Putting down her teacup, Song Ci\u2019s bright eyes landed on Han Aoyu. She suddenly said, \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ve already seen the medical record in the study.\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t believe that the medical record would just so happen to appear there.\n Han Aoyu opened his eyes completely.\n Han Aoyu stared at Song Ci in astonishment for a while before giving an enigmatic smile. \u201cLittle Song, you are indeed intelligent.\u201d Since she had already guessed it, Han Aoyu admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I put the medical record into the study.\u201d\n Song Ci thought to herself: Grandpa really did it...\n \u201cZhanzhan came back to look for me the night you quarreled with him.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know about this. Song Ci asked his grandfather, \u201cCould he be here to tell on me?\u201d She had a smile on her face and was joking.\n \u201cNo.\u201d Han Aoyu shook his head and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him so lost and helpless in so many years. When he came to see me, he was so cold that his limbs were like ice and his eyes were red. He looked like he had just cried. In my memory, the last time Han Zhan cried was when he found out that he lost two fingers.\u201d\n Song Ci pursed her lips and remained silent. She didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n Han Aoyu continued, \u201cAfter knowing what Zhanzhan did to you, I felt that he was very foolish and scolded him. He listened obediently and didn\u2019t dare to make a single sound.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled mildly but didn\u2019t comment on Han Aoyu\u2019s actions.\n \u201cZhanzhan asked me if there\u2019s any way to obtain your forgiveness.\u201d Han Aoyu looked at Song Ci meaningfully and said, \u201cActually, when I placed that medical record on the bookshelf, I was betting on your feelings for Zhanzhan.\u201d\n \u201cIf you really love him, after seeing those medical records, your heart will definitely ache for him. If you don\u2019t love him, even if you see that thing, it won\u2019t affect your mood.\u201d Han Aoyu pointed at Song Ci. \u201cJust by sitting here, it shows that you love him.\u201d\n In front of Han Aoyu, Song Ci was like a transparent person with no secrets.\n In terms of intelligence, even ten Song Cis were no match for Han Aoyu.\n Han Aoyu had seen all sorts of storms in his life. He knew exactly what Song Ci was thinking and why she came to look for him.\n The elegant smile on Song Ci\u2019s face finally turned into a bitter smile. \u201cGrandpa, you are really old but not old at heart.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d Han Aoyu noticed that the tea was cold and asked Song Ci to pour him a cup of hot tea. Song Ci stood up and bent over to pour a cup of hot tea for him.\n Holding a cup of hot tea with both hands, Song Ci heard Han Aoyu say, \u201cTell me, what do you want to ask me?\u201d\n Song Ci indeed had something to discuss with Han Aoyu.\n Sitting down again, Song Ci muttered to herself before asking Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, when you found Brother Han, what was he like? I want to know more.\u201d\n She wanted to understand Han Zhan thoroughly.\n Han Aoyu sighed. \u201cVery bad.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart sank. \u201cHow bad was it?\u201d\n \u201cThat child\u2019s eyes are as vicious as a wolf\u2019s. He looks at people aggressively.\u201d\n Han Aoyu held that cup of tea in his palm as he sank into his memories.\n He continued. \u201cWhen I found Han Zhan, he was covered in blood and kneeling on the ground while carrying his mother\u2019s corpse. My heart nearly broke when I saw his skinny frame and his arm covered in needle holes.\u201d\n \u201cI wanted to take Mulan\u2019s body away, but Han Zhan forbade me from touching her. I told him that I was his grandfather and had come to fetch him home. At that time, he looked at me very coldly and distrustfully. When I took out my photo with his mother, he glanced at me and asked me a question.\u201d\n Han Aoyu still remembered that statement very clearly.\n Song Ci had a feeling that those words would be heart-rending. She asked boldly, \u201cWhat words?\u201d\n Han Aoyu\u2019s wrinkled face started to tremble. He said, \u201cZhanzhan asked me: Old Mr. Han, where have you been all these years? Where were you when my mother died?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyelids quivered but she remained silent.\n \u201cI was very helpless at that time. I had never felt so guilty and upset. I wanted to hug him, but he avoided me like a poisonous snake. After I brought him back to Wangdong City by force, I arranged for the best virus specialist team in the country and a psychologist team to conduct psychological counseling for him.\u201d\n \u201cAfter entering the hospital, the doctor performed a physical examination on him and discovered that there were many knife scars on his body. Some of them were very deep, while others were very shallow. I thought they were wounds caused by that bastard Edward abusing him, but the doctor told me that Zhanzhan cut himself. Little Song, can you imagine how I felt then? I still remember how much your grandmother cried when she heard about this.\u201d\n Not only was grandma crying, even the unyielding Han Aoyu was crying beside Han Zhan\u2019s bed.\n Song Ci saw that Han Aoyu was slightly agitated and thought of his high blood pressure. She hurriedly comforted him. \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t be agitated. It\u2019s all in the past. Isn\u2019t Brother Han quite healthy now?\u201d\n Han Aoyu nodded and rubbed his slightly hot eyes. Only when he calmed down did he speak again. \u201cIn the first half a year after we returned to the country, Zhanzhan barely spoke. But after he fell asleep, he kept yelling for his mother. During that time, his grandmother and I had a very difficult time. Every night, our hearts bled when we heard our child call for his mother.\u201d\n His daughter had been murdered and his grandson was in a coma. During that period, Han Aoyu and his lover\u2019s hair had all turned white.\n \u201cBut luckily, the heavens don\u2019t disappoint those who are determined. After two years of psychological counseling, Zhanzhan\u2019s mental state improved and he was willing to speak to others. But during the treatment process, he took many hormonal drugs and became much fatter. But at that time, it was a good thing that the child was alive. So what if he was slightly fatter or thinner?\u201d\n \u201cGrandpa is right. Being alive is more important than anything.\u201d Song Ci felt a dull ache in her chest when she remembered how nonchalant Han Zhan was when he said that he was fat when he was young.\n Han Zhan was used to hiding all his pain.\n Taking a deep look at Song Ci and seeing how much Song Ci loved her grandson, Han Aoyu finally felt slightly better. \u201cSong Ci, Grandpa will apologize on behalf of Han Zhan.\u201d\n This apology was too heavy and Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to accept it. Her expression changed slightly as she hurriedly said, \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t say that. The one at fault is Han Zhan. Grandpa, you\u2019re hurting me by saying this.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, Zhanzhan is ridiculously wrong in this matter, but Grandpa is also selfish. I still hope that you can forgive Zhanzhan. Zhanzhan was forced to part with us when he was two years old and had such a miserable childhood. He even watched his father kill his own mother. Song Lass, your childhood was very blissful. You can\u2019t imagine how Zhanzhan survived it!\u201d\n \u201cZhanzhan made use of you in a moment of folly. But he has already turned over a new leaf and admitted his mistake to you. If he doesn\u2019t really like you, Zhanzhan will never tell you these things.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, confessing is his way of lowering his head towards love. Can you forgive him this time on account of the fact that it\u2019s Han Zhan\u2019s first offense?\u201d\n Han Aoyu was old and couldn\u2019t control the people and the world, but he still wanted to protect his family well. He couldn\u2019t bear to see Han Zhan and Song Ci in this stalemate, and he still hoped that the two of them could live happily.\n Firstly, Song Ci hadn\u2019t been seriously injured by Han Zhan. Secondly, she hadn\u2019t lost a single piece of flesh, and it was Han Zhan who had saved her life. She already didn\u2019t blame Han Zhan in her heart.\n Moreover, the old man had already lowered himself so much. Song Ci was not heartless and forgave Han Zhan. \u201cAlright, Grandpa will listen to you. I won\u2019t blame Brother Han anymore.\u201d\n Han Aoyu reached out and patted the back of Song Ci\u2019s hand. \u201cSorry to make you suffer this time, Song Lass.\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n She never wronged herself. If she didn\u2019t really forgive Han Zhan, Song Ci would never agree to Han Aoyu\u2019s request.\n At this moment, Han Zhan suddenly walked over. \u201cGrandpa, do you know how to make the support for a cradle?\u201d\n Han Aoyu slowly sat up. \u201cLet me teach you.\u201d\n The grandfather and grandson duo went off to have a showdown. Song Ci then went to the kitchen to make lunch.\n Han Zhan used three days to successfully make a crib. Every single bamboo vine was smoothened out. By that time, the crib could be used for sleeping once they placed a mattress on it.\n Song Ci looked at that brand new crib and felt rather blissful.\n She instinctively touched her own tummy. She couldn\u2019t wait for the baby to enter her tummy.\n On the fourth day of the New Year, Han Zhan brought Song Ci to Shunchen to visit Old Master Chen Shu.\n Old Master Han stayed in the courtyard beside the administration courtyard. Knowing that Han Zhan was bringing his wife over for the New Year, Chen Shu and his wife started preparing lunch early in the morning.\n Chen Shu\u2019s lover had excellent culinary skills and made the best sweet and sour fish. Song Ci didn\u2019t like sweet and sour fish in the past, but she ate a lot today.\n After they finished eating, Song Ci helped the elderly wash the dishes and asked her for instructions on how to make sweet and sour fish. Seeing that Song Ci liked her dishes so much, the elderly was very happy and taught Song Ci all of her signature dishes.\n After washing the dishes, Song Ci sat in the Chen Family residence drinking tea and jotting down all the cooking techniques in a notebook.\n When she finished recording, Song Ci looked up and saw a woman in a grey-green down jacket standing in front of the Chen Family residence.\n That woman had very long hair that was completely tied up, revealing a full, fair forehead. Her face was only the size of a palm, and her facial features were not very beautiful. But her eyes were gentle and moving, and she was a gentle and elegant lady.\n \u201cHello, are you looking for Old Master Chen?\u201d Song Ci got up, walked to the door, and called out to that girl.\n Chen Miaomiao looked at Song Ci\u2019s face curiously. As a girl, Chen Miaomiao felt slightly awkward and blushed when faced with such a gorgeous girl like Song Ci.\n Mrs. Chen happened to come out to feed the cat with cat food. She saw Song Ci standing at the door talking to someone and asked her, \u201cLittle Song, who\u2019s outside?\u201d\n Song Ci turned sideways and revealed Chen Miaomiao\u2019s figure.\n \u201cGrandma Chen, do you know this lady?\u201d\n Mrs. Chen smiled. \u201cOh, Miaomiao, come in quickly.\u201d\n Chen Miaomiao greeted Grandma Chen before striding into the Chen Family residence.\n Song Ci followed behind Chen Miaomiao. Being able to tell that this lady was Grandpa Chen\u2019s relative, she stopped paying attention to her.\n Mrs. Chen tugged at Chen Miaomiao\u2019s arm and said, \u201cMiaomiao, your Brother Zhanzhan brought his wife back for the New Year visit. This lady is your Brother Zhanzhan\u2019s wife, Song Ci.\u201d\n Chen Miaomiao was the blind date that Old Master Han had arranged for Han Zhan last year when he visited him.\n Chen Miaomiao was five years younger than Han Zhan and five years older than Song Ci. But in terms of seniority, even she had to greet Song Ci obediently. \u201cSister-in-law.\u201d\n Song Ci blushed slightly at this greeting. \u201cMmm, hello.\u201d\n At this moment, Han Zhan and Old Master Chen came out together. Old Master Chen supported himself with a crutch and carried a chess set in his arms. He was obviously bringing Han Zhan over to the administration building to play chess.  Seeing Chen Miaomiao, Old Master Chen said, \u201cMiaomiao, have you seen your sister-in-law?\u201d\n Chen Miaomiao turned to look at Old Master Chen, but noticed the tall and handsome Han Zhan standing behind him.\n Chen Miaomiao\u2019s eyes flashed slightly. She felt slightly upset and called out softly, \u201cBrother Zhan.\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded. He walked over, grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand, and said, \u201cThis is Miaomiao. Grandpa told you about her, right?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Grandpa said that when Han Zhan was first fetched back, he barely spoke, not even willing to look at adults. At that time, the Chen Family had a little Miaomiao who was only about a year old. Before she could speak, Han Zhan kept pushing little Miaomiao\u2019s stroller to get some sunlight in the yard.\n Staying with Song Ci and Han Zhan made Chen Miaomiao feel awkward, so she hurriedly bid farewell.\n Old Master Chen Shu called Han Zhan over to play chess and Song Ci chatted with Old Madam Chen. As they chatted, Old Madam asked how Song Ci and Han Zhan met.\n Song Ci said, \u201cWe met last summer. At that time, Brother Han\u2019s company was hiring pilots, so I went. We fell in love at first sight and got registered after only knowing each other for a month.\u201d\n \u201cNo wonder!\u201d Old Madam Chen suddenly laughed.\n Song Ci felt puzzled and asked Old Madam Chen, \u201cGrandma Chen, what\u2019s the matter? What are you laughing at?\u201d\n \u201cLass Song, you probably don\u2019t know. When Zhanzhan came to Shunchen City last year, he came by to visit your Grandpa Chen and I. At that time, we didn\u2019t know that you and Zhanzhan were in a relationship, so we took the liberty of introducing Miaomiao to Zhanzhan. In the end, Zhanzhan rejected our arrangement. At that time, we were still worried that Zhanzhan would never get married in this lifetime. It turns out that he already has someone by his side!\u201d\n Song Ci was all smiles as she cursed in her heart.\n What the hell?\n That Miaomiao and Brother Han had almost become a couple?\n At night, after having dinner at Old Master Chen\u2019s house, Song Ci returned to the hotel with Han Zhan.\n After taking a shower at the hotel, Han Zhan sat on a massage chair and played with his cell phone.\n Opening the group chat, she saw Li Li posting his child\u2019s photo.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached. He opened the photo and enlarged it, staring at the black blob on the ultrasound scan, feeling both jealousy and heartache.\n Those who got married after me were already pregnant!\n At this moment, Song Ci came out of the bathroom. She was only wearing a towel, exposing her long legs and sexy shoulders. It made one want to touch and kiss her.\n Han Zhan tossed his cell phone aside, got up, walked up to Song Ci, blocked her path, and said, \u201cBaby Ci, your fertile period is these few days.\u201d\n Song Ci tilted her head. \u201cSo?\u201d\n Han Zhan took the towel from Song Ci\u2019s hand, wrapped it around her wet hair, and rubbed it slightly vigorously. Song Ci stood still and waited for Han Zhan to wipe the water droplets off her hair before drying it with an electric fan.\n After tying up her hair, Han Zhan carried Song Ci and placed her in his arms. \u201cYou are going to film next month, right?\u201d\n \u201cMmm. When I called Second Old Master Gu to wish him a happy new year, he told me that the production crew will start filming on the second day of the month.\u201d There were only about 10 days left.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t want to be separated from Song Ci. He buried his head in her neck and took a deep breath. \u201cBaby Ci, can I have you?\u201d\n Song Ci looked at him with a faint smile but didn\u2019t nod.\n Han Zhan felt that Song Ci\u2019s expression was slightly dangerous and charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \u201cI heard that Miaomiao was your blind date?\u201d Song Ci started to find fault with him.\n Han Zhan frowned. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d\n \u201cGrandma Chen mentioned it accidentally.\u201d\n Han Zhan pinched his brows and sighed. \u201cBefore I met you, many people wanted to introduce me to someone. It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know that.\u201d Someone whom he once had a blind date with splashed coffee on Han Zhan.\n Song Ci pouted and said unhappily, \u201cBut Miaomiao and you were childhood sweethearts.\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense. Miaomiao and I are innocent.\u201d\n Song Ci felt very uncomfortable. She said, \u201cThis is not fair. In my entire life, apart from you and Cheng Ziang, I have never touched any other man\u2019s hand! But you\u2014you have so many blind dates.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t feel good either. \u201cI\u2019ve read your script. You have a kissing scene with the male lead.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cThat\u2019s just for show.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThat was before I met you.\u201d\n The two of them stared at each other. After a long while, they both surrendered.\n Han Zhan asked softly, \u201cCan you not do the kissing scene?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cAnything is possible if the investor allows for it.\u201d She had already hinted at everything.\n To be honest, Song Ci didn\u2019t really want to kiss strangers either, especially since she was already married.\n Song Ci was not a professional actress. She was not acting to make a name for herself in the entertainment circles, so she would mind if she acted in a kissing scene with someone else.\n Han Zhan understood what Song Ci meant and said, \u201cSend me the director\u2019s number. I will discuss this with him.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci immediately took out her cell phone and sent Du Junfei\u2019s number to Han Zhan. Han Zhan saved the number and said, \u201cI\u2019ll call him later.\u201d\n Putting down his cell phone, Han Zhan hooked up Song Ci\u2019s towel with his fingers, tugged gently, and released the towel.\n Staring at Song Ci\u2019s body, Han Zhan said, \u201cThe hotel bed is made of water. Shall we go and try?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cOkay, I haven\u2019t tried it yet.\u201d\n The next day, the two of them went to visit Han Zhan\u2019s uncle, Han Dongliang. They only returned to Wangdong City at noon on the seventh day of the Lunar New Year. Once they returned to Wangdong City, Han Zhan immersed himself in his work, while Song Ci accompanied Yan Jiang and Song Fei on a trip to Zhangjiajie.\n Recently, Song Fei had been trying to exercise to regain her strength and was still rather tired from climbing the 999th stair. Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t bear for her to be tired and expressed that he wanted to carry her up the mountain. But Song Fei felt very embarrassed and stubbornly climbed to the entrance of the Heaven Gate Mountain herself.\n Many years ago, the Song sisters had also come to Zhangjiajie with their parents. Compared to the past, Zhangjiajie now had a glass plankway.\n Song Fei wanted to play, so Song Ci and Yan Jiang accompanied her.\n Yan Jiang was afraid of heights. Standing on the glass walkway and looking at the sea of clouds beneath his feet, his legs were trembling slightly. Song Fei couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and asked him, \u201cAre you very scared?\u201d\n Yan Jiang admitted defeat. \u201cAh Fei, I really can\u2019t do this. You guys continue. I will wait for you guys.\u201d\n But Song Fei tugged at his arm. \u201cIf you\u2019re scared, just look at my face.\u201d\n Yan Jiang stared at Song Fei for a while, still feeling very terrified.\n \u201cNo, Ah Fei, I really can\u2019t do it.\u201d It was not easy to overcome a fear of heights. Yan Jiang would rather die than walk down that glass walkway.\n Song Ci took out her cell phone and took a short video. She uploaded the video of Yan Jiang having a fear of heights to her social media account. Very quickly, Yan Jiang\u2019s fans discovered it and they all said that they wanted to buy a ticket to meet their idol at Zhangjiajie.\n Song Ci kept her cell phone in her bag and said to Yan Jiang, \u201cIt will take at most 20 minutes for your fans to find you. Let\u2019s leave quickly.\u201d\n Yan Jiang glared at Song Ci. \u201cYou posted me on Weibo?\u201d\n Song Ci spread out her hands and raised her brows like a hooligan. She said, \u201cHave you forgotten who was the one who shared the video of me swimming on the floor after getting drunk on TikTok?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n =He was in the wrong.\n It was nearly dark by the time they left the Zhangjiajie. They had dinner at Xibu Street before returning to the Zishan Hotel.\n Arriving at the room, Song Ci soaked herself in the bathtub and video called Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan was still working overtime and his eyes dimmed slightly when he saw Song Ci bathing. \u201cDid you have fun today?\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d Song Ci told Han Zhan about the interesting things that happened today and the beautiful scenery that she had seen. After hearing Song Ci\u2019s description, Han Zhan had the illusion that he had also experienced the beautiful scenery.\n \u201cWhat did you have for dinner?\u201d\n \u201cChili pepper fish head, so spicy!\u201d Song Ci said worriedly. \u201cI wonder if there will be pimples on my face tomorrow.\u201d As Song Ci spoke, she suddenly stood up from the bathtub and took a neatly folded towel to wipe herself.\n Han Zhan stared at her actions.\n Knowing that Song Ci had done it on purpose, Han Zhan mustered up a lot of self-control before looking away from her.\n After a while, Song Ci finally got dressed and went to bed with her cell phone.\n Song Ci laid in bed and scrolled through Weibo. She thought of something and asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, don\u2019t you have Weibo?\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d In order to follow Song Ci\u2019s post on Weibo, he specially registered a Weibo account.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I will go and follow you.\u201d Song Ci excitedly searched for Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan remained silent for a few seconds before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t remember. Give me a moment, let me take a look.\u201d\n Han Zhan hurriedly logged into Weibo, opened the personal page of \u201cBaby Ci\u2019s Brother Zhan\u201d, and changed the Weibo name. After the change was successful, Han Zhan then said to Song Ci in all seriousness, \u201cI just took a look. My Weibo name is Han Han Han Han Hanzhan.\u201d\n ]Song Ci was stunned for a moment before saying, \u201cCouple name?\u201d\n Song Ci searched for Han Han Han Han Zhan. Indeed, she found this user. She looked at Han Zhan\u2019s profile and realized that it was very simple and crude \u2014\n Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO.\n Song Ci followed Han Zhan\u2019s Weibo account and realized that they were mutually following each other.\n Song Ci told Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, go and get a verified account. You don\u2019t know that ever since you revealed your identity, a large group of users called Han Zhan has appeared on Weibo.\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows and asked her, \u201cHow?\u201d\n \u201cAsk your assistant. He will definitely settle it for you.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After hanging up, Song Ci opened the book \u201cOrdinary World\u201d and continued reading.\n She had watched this television series a long time ago and felt somewhat out of place whenever she read the original novel. But thinking that this was Brother Han\u2019s collection of novels, Song Ci continued reading patiently.\n After a while, Song Ci felt drowsy.\n She thought that she was indeed not suited to read such literary novels.\n Song Ci closed her book, and habitually opened her Weibo account before going to bed to take another look. With this glance, she saw a trending topic called # Han Zhan Opening Weibo #.\n Han Zhan?\n Is it my Han Zhan?\n Curious, Song Ci clicked on that trending topic and saw that there was indeed a \u201cHan Han Han Han Han Han Zhan\u201d and an extra golden \u2018V\u2019 in front of his name. As expected of CEO Han, he was so efficient.\n Han Zhan posted a very torturous post on Weibo:\n [I was interviewed by a financial magazine the day before yesterday. The reporter asked me what was the most successful thing I have ever done in my life. Considering that it was a financial magazine, my answer might not be compatible with the magazine\u2019s style, so I skipped this topic.\n But I always had an answer to that question.\n The most successful thing I have ever done in my life was to marry Song Ci and make her my legal wife.\n Hello, beautiful Mrs. Han @ Song Ci.]\n After reading this message, Song Ci felt very sweet inside. She couldn\u2019t resist reposting it \u2014\n Song Song Song Song Ci: Hi, Mr. Han. @ / Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Zhan...\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t fall asleep from the sweetness. She tossed and turned in bed before finally falling asleep.\n \u2013\n On this day, Du Xueyan accepted an invitation from China\u2019s Vogue Magazine to shoot the front-page cover.\n The theme of this issue of the magazine was Night Elves. Du Xueyan transformed into a Night Elf and appeared at the roadside of the Three Bridges Business District in Wangdong City at night.\n Du Xueyan was breathtakingly beautiful in front of the camera.\n She was wearing a tight, halter top with her hips and long legs wrapped in a black, flowy silk skirt. Long, curly black hair fell over her shoulders, and her ears were done up to look like a fairy. Her dark purple eye shadow made Du Xueyan look both bewitching and alluring.\n Having reached her current position, Du Xueyan had already learned to handle all sorts of cameras with ease. She could always find the most perfect angle and put on the most charming pose.\n At 1am, the shoot finally ended. The assistant hurriedly put on a down jacket to keep Du Xueyan warm.\n The staff bought supper to reward their colleagues who had stayed up all night. The assistant gave Du Xueyan two egg tarts. \u201cSister Xue, you didn\u2019t have dinner. Have two egg tarts to fill your stomach.\u201d\n Du Xueyan only wanted one egg tart. \u201cI\u2019ll have one.\u201d Although she was not an actress, Du Xueyan was stricter about her figure than most actresses.\n She tightened her down jacket and sat in the van. She munched on her egg tart as she browsed Weibo.\n Reading Weibo was a habit that Du Xueyan had recently developed. In the United States, Du Xueyan preferred to browse instagram, however, she had to get used to using Weibo as the local celebrities and netizens used it.\n Du Xueyan opened Weibo and was shocked to see Han Zhan\u2019s name.\n Han Zhan?\n Which Han Zhan?\n With an expectant heart, Du Xueyan opened that trending topic. When she saw that Han Zhan had posted his love on Weibo three hours ago, Du Xueyan gradually pursed her lips.\n When did Han Zhan become such a high-profile person?\n He was clearly a very low-profile person in high school.\n Du Xueyan opened Han Zhan\u2019s Weibo page to see his other activities to torture herself.\n After entering Han Zhan\u2019s Weibo page, Du Xueyan was disappointed to find that there was only that post from three hours ago.\n She was about to log out when she noticed that the biography on Han Zhan\u2019s Weibo account:\n Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO.\n Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO?\n Du Xueyan\u2019s eyes widened!\n Du Xueyan suppressed the tumultuous waves in her heart and made all sorts of ridiculous guesses. She looked up at her assistant driving the car and asked Tong Xin, \u201cTong Xin, do you know about Zeus Corporation?\u201d\n Tong Xin hurriedly nodded. \u201cOf course I know. Zeus Corporation was founded by Zeus Airlines. Last December, several major international corporations were suddenly bought over and Zeus Corporation was rebuilt. I heard from them that Zeus Corporation has long surpassed Chuan Dong Group and has become Wangdong City\u2019s boss.\u201d\n The boss of Wangdong City was basically the boss of the entire country.\n Du Xueyan\u2019s heartbeat quickened.\n I had also heard about Zeus Corporation, but how could Han Zhan be Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO?\n Impossible. Han Zhan came from an ordinary family background. He was in the military eight years ago. How could he have single-handedly established a business empire in just eight short years?!\n Du Xueyan refused to believe it.\n She asked Tong Xin, \u201cDo you know who Zeus Corporation\u2019s boss is?\u201d\n \u201cSister Xue, don\u2019t you look at Weibo?\u201d Tong Xin told Du Xueyan. \u201cRecently, the news about Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO has been trending on Weibo. Zeus Corporation\u2019s boss is a man called Han Zhan. On the night of the 28th of December, Wangdong City hosted the Spring Festival Gala. Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO Han Zhan, Chuandong Group\u2019s CEO Cheng Yanmo, as well as the Young Master of Wonderful Pharmaceutical Group, Jiang Guchuan, performed a recital performance together. That\u2019s how his identity got exposed.\u201d\n \u201cI remember that this incident was posted all over Weibo. Sister Xue, didn\u2019t you see it?\u201d\n On the night of 28th December...\n Du Xueyan remembered. As she was going to attend the Spring Festival Gala, Du Xueyan had returned home early on the 28th of December to visit her father. That night, she chatted with her father for a long time. The next day, she went to visit her mother\u2019s grave with her father and didn\u2019t check Weibo.\n ]As a result, Du Xueyan had perfectly missed out on the big news.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t look at Weibo those few days.\u201d Du Xueyan\u2019s heart was in turmoil. She still felt that this was a dream, a ridiculous joke, and was unwilling to admit that Han Zhan was Zeus Corporation\u2019s boss.\n Du Xueyan opened the QQ app that she had not used in a long time. She logged in while invisible.\n After logging in, Du Xueyan entered the high school class group. Ever since WeChat became popular, there were fewer people using QQ and almost no one appeared in the class group for the entire year.\n However, when Du Xueyan opened the class group chat this time, she saw a 99+notification.\n She scrolled to the top page and saw that at about 11pm on the 28th of December, the publicity committee member who had the nickname \u201cBig Horn\u201d was the first to appear in the group chat.\n Big Horn: [Damn! What did I just see!]\n Big Horn: [Video.]\n Big Horn: [Isn\u2019t this our classmate Han Zhan! He is Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO?]\n Big [email\u00a0protected] All members.\n Big Horn: [Shocking news, everyone. Let me tell you something major. Our high school classmate, Han Zhan, that tall, handsome, blue-eyed Han Zhan, is actually the CEO of Zeus Corporation! I am at the party site and there is a video as a witness. Everyone, look!]\n Shortly after, a second student appeared. Then a third, a fourth...\n Towards the end, everyone started chatting away.\n Although Du Xueyan had never logged out of the class group chat, she had never appeared or logged into this account. As a result, the students thought that Du Xueyan had already logged out of her QQ account. Meanwhile, Han Zhan had never logged into the QQ group at all. These people started chatting without restraint in the group chat \u2014\n Classmate A: [If Han Zhan is Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO, then... please tell me how traumatized Du Xueyan is!]\n Classmate B: [No way. I remember Han Zhan and Song Ci got married. Does Song Ci know? Wangdong City\u2019s top socialite? I saw her at a cocktail party. She was tall and beautiful, so fair that she glowed. She was even more beautiful than Du Xueyan.]\n Classmate C: [I will quietly expose something. Everyone might not know, but when Du Xueyan broke up with Han Zhan, he was seriously injured and lost two fingers. It was said that he was still lying in bed. Du Xueyan took the initiative to break up with him.]\n Classmate C added: [At that time, everyone felt that Han Zhan wasn\u2019t worthy of Du Xueyan. But who would have thought that Han Zhan would be astonishing the moment he made his move! With just a casual wave of his hand, he was a king!]\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "206": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-207\n\n Chapter 206: Han Zhan: I Think Song Ci is Good  After seeing Student C\u2019s expos\u00e9, the other students all popped out: [Tsk tsk tsk, Du Xueyan abandoned Han Zhan in order to pursue fame and fortune. If she knew that Han Zhan had such capabilities now, Du Xueyan would be filled with regret.]\n [When they were dating back then, someone predicted that they wouldn\u2019t last long. It\u2019s obvious that Du Xueyan was admitted to the music academy because of her beauty and will definitely become a celebrity in the future. At that time, Han Zhan came from an ordinary family background. It would be strange if they could make it to the end.]\n [Come to think of it, Du Xueyan is indeed heartless to abandon Han Zhan when he is injured.]\n Below, everyone was laughing at Du Xueyan.\n People tended to guess the thoughts of others with the greatest maliciousness, especially when this \u201cother person\u201d was a beautiful woman with both fame and fortune.\n After more than a hundred comments, someone finally posted a pertinent comment.\n This spokesperson was called Li Zihuan and was a good friend of Du Xueyan from high school. They had maintained a good relationship in university, but as Du Xueyan went further and further away, their social circles changed and their friendship faded.\n Li Zihuan said, [Although Du Xueyan abandoned Han Zhan when he was injured and this is indeed very despicable, it is also not wrong for Du Xueyan to pursue her dreams. A woman can only be carefree and at ease if she has a career and enough money. It is not a long-term solution to depend on a man. Some women are willing to be the soft and fragrant jade in a man\u2019s arms, while others are willing to be their queen. Everyone, don\u2019t mock Du Xueyan just because of Han Zhan\u2019s glory and success. You can scold Du Xueyan for being heartless towards Han Zhan, but you should not mock a woman\u2019s ambition to carve out a beautiful future.]\n Du Xueyan\u2019s cold heart warmed slightly at Li Zihuan\u2019s words.\n She secretly clicked on Li Zihuan\u2019s QQ profile picture and wrote a sentence in the private chat: [Huanhuan, thank you for protecting me when everyone is hitting me when I am down.] After all, they were close friends for many years and even if they weren\u2019t close anymore, the loyalty still stayed.\n Li Zihuan was still awake.\n Du Xueyan was about to log out of QQ when she saw Li Zihuan reply.\n Li Zihuan: [It\u2019s only right. Just take a look at their words and don\u2019t take it to heart. Relationships are as common as water. They can\u2019t wait to see you make a fool of yourself.]\n Du Xueyan leaned back in her chair and asked Li Zihuan, [Why are you still awake?]\n Li Zihuan: [The child was hungry just now and I\u2019m breastfeeding her.]\n Du Xueyan was shocked. [You already have a child? You are married? With whom?]\n Li Zihuan: [Do you think I am the same as you, famous celebrity? I am 31 years old and many of my classmates have already given birth to their second child. I got a little princess last year and you also know the father...]\n Du Xueyan was shocked. She asked: [Could it be Du Yinsheng?]\n Li Zihuan: [I broke up with him after graduating from university. He wanted to gain a foothold in Wangdong City and married the daughter of a big company\u2019s boss. By the time I found out, the girl was already pregnant with his daughter. Things were quite ugly when we broke up. Now that I think of myself back then, I feel so stupid.]\n Du Xueyan was stunned by the change in Li Zihuan and Du Yinshen\u2019s relationship.\n In high school, Li Zihuan and Du Yinsheng were the most famous couple in school. Both of them were top students and both were good-looking. The fact that they were encouraging each other to attend Wangdong University was a beautiful story in high school.\n Unexpectedly, despite thinking that they would get married after graduating from university, they ended up breaking up.\n [Then your current husband is...]\n Li Zihuan sent an embarrassed emoticon before sending Du Xueyan a photo.\n Du Xueyan zoomed in on that photo and saw a man with bronzed skin, fierce eyes, and a strong figure carrying a baby girl. The contrast was adorable.\n Du Xueyan felt that this person looked somewhat familiar. She thought carefully before remembering who he was.\n Du Xueyan: [Could your husband be Zhou Meng?]\n Zhou Meng was nicknamed Brother Black. He had a very good relationship with Han Zhan in high school. At that time, Brother Black had a crush on Li Zihuan and did many silly things for her.\n Han Zhan had instigated Brother Black to confess to Li Zihuan several times. Brother Black didn\u2019t dare, as he felt that Li Zihuan was a good girl with good grades and would definitely attend a good university in the future. A jerk like him wasn\u2019t worthy of the other party.\n Unexpectedly, Zhou Meng was the one who ended up marrying Li Zihuan.\n Du Xueyan was deeply moved. She asked Li Zihuan: [Has Brother Black retired from the army?] Brother Black went to the military with Han Zhan, but they weren\u2019t in the same army.\n Li Zihuan: [He didn\u2019t. He went to the military academy for advanced studies and was promoted to major last year. He is doing pretty well.]\n Brother Hei has been promoted to major...\n Du Xueyan couldn\u2019t help thinking of Han Zhan. If Han Zhan hadn\u2019t been discharged from the army due to injuries, he would definitely have achieved a higher position than Brother Black.\n In her daze, Du Xueyan didn\u2019t notice that Li Zihuan had sent another message.\n Noticing that the red light had turned on, Tong Xin parked the car behind the pedestrian crossing. He looked at the time and said, \u201cSister Xue, we are reaching the hotel soon. Go to bed early tonight. I will pick you up at 9am tomorrow to visit your new home.\u201d\n Du Xueyan decided to return to China to develop her career, so her top priority now was to find a house.\n \u201cMmm. Okay.\u201d\n Du Xueyan looked down at her cell phone and realized that Li Zihuan had sent her a message two minutes ago.\n Li Zihuan: [Xueyan, I just want to ask you, back then... when you broke up with Han Zhan under those circumstances, have you ever regretted it?]\n Du Xueyan\u2019s fingers paused on the keyboard for a long while. In the end, she pretended not to see Li Zihuan\u2019s message and logged out of QQ.\n Returning to the hotel, Du Xueyan opened her laptop, logged into QQ, and entered her private photo album.\n Du Xueyan saw that the screen was filled with photos of her and Han Zhan. She opened the first photo.\n That was the photo she had secretly taken of Han Zhan. At that time, Han Zhan was already 1.83m tall, holding a ball, standing under the basketball hoop in a yellow uniform. Hearing her shout for him to turn back, he turned to look at her in a daze. After seeing Du Xueyan, a smile gradually appeared in Han Zhan\u2019s cold eyes.\n In her impression, the Han Zhan in his youth was actually a rather cold person. When he had someone by his side, he was also a cheerful and talkative youth. But whenever he was alone, there was always a sense of loneliness surrounding him.\n The first time Du Xueyan met Han Zhan was in Year 1.\n That day, Han Zhan stood on the side of the road beside the school and looked into the depths of the alley expressionlessly. Three or four hooligans were bullying a short-haired youth.\n Du Xueyan was waiting for the bus at that time. Seeing Han Zhan\u2019s indifferent manner, she thought to herself, This boy is so cold.\n But what the boy did next overturned Du Xueyan\u2019s original impression of him.\n Han Zhan casually walked behind that group of people, threw aside his school bag, and kicked that group of gangsters to the ground. Han Zhan grabbed that short youth\u2019s arm and forced him to fight back.\n The short youth had been crying the entire time, but under Han Zhan\u2019s pressure, he could only raise his fist and smash it into the hooligans\u2019 faces. With Han Zhan at the side, those hooligans didn\u2019t dare to fight back even if they were beaten up.\n Perhaps having tasted the pleasure of retaliating, the youth who had been bullied all this while suddenly erupted with a shocking hatred. Like a mad man, he landed his punches and kicks on the hooligans.\n As Du Xueyan approached the alley, she heard Han Zhan say to that youth, \u201cThose who get beaten are all spineless. Don\u2019t expect a savior to save you. Be your own savior. You won\u2019t be bullied by others.\u201d\n Du Xueyan stood at the entrance of the alley in a daze. Han Zhan picked up his bag and walked out. As he brushed past her, he glanced at her very coldly.\n In Han Zhan\u2019s eyes, Du Xueyan was just a decoration on their first meeting.\n Han Zhan was like a pool of ice, cold and indifferent.\n That year, it was actually Du Xueyan who took the initiative to woo Han Zhan for their entire first year of school.\n Han Zhan was a very difficult person to deal with. Du Xueyan had never met anyone harder to deal with than Han Zhan. She truly moved Han Zhan\u2019s heart on a snowy night.\n That night, Du Xueyan went to Han Zhan\u2019s rented apartment outside the school with a basketball signed by Yao Ming.\n At that time, Han Zhan refused to come down and Du Xueyan stood in the snow for three to four hours. The snow was very heavy that night and Du Xueyan was almost frozen solid. Only then did Han Zhan come down.\n A tall, cold youth stood in front of her, stared at her frozen face, and asked, \u201cDu Xueyan, why are you always bothering me?\u201d\n He thought of her \u2018like\u2019 as \u201cclingy.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was very angry and aggrieved back then.\n Hugging that ball, she threw a tantrum at Han Zhan for the first time. \u201cHan Zhan, you don\u2019t understand. I like you! I just like you. I didn\u2019t commit any heinous crimes. Must you ignore me like this?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with liking someone. If I could control my heart and not like you, would I be so cheap?\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at her for a long time before saying, \u201cDu Xueyan, think it through. You were the one who provoked me. If you want to play with me and leave after you\u2019re tired of me, I advise you to give up early...\u201d\n \u201cI hate people who are trick others and are manipulative. They disgust me.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was determined not to give up. She thought that a moment of fondness would result in a lifetime of chasing. She smiled and told Han Zhan, \u201cHan Zhan, I\u2019m exceptionally good at pestering people. If I like you, I\u2019ll pester you forever.\u201d\n That woman who said she would pester Han Zhan forever still chose to abandon him.\n u Xueyan selected all the photos and moved the mouse to the \u2018delete all\u2019 button. She hesitated for a long time before finally closing the laptop. She laid down on the bed, covered her eyes with her arms, and cried bitterly.\n \u2013\n The next morning, Han Zhan arrived at the office and bumped into Li Li in the garage.\n The moment Li Li saw Han Zhan, he asked him, \u201cMr. Han, have you seen my ultrasound photos?\u201d From the time they got married, Li Li had become a maniac.\n Han Zhan knew that Li Li was doing this on purpose. He acknowledged without changing his expression. \u201cMmm, I saw it. It\u2019s dark.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s lips twitched. He bent over and pressed the lift button.\n Only after Han Zhan entered did Li Li follow closely behind. He grabbed the railing of the lift and told Han Zhan, \u201cAll ultrasound scans are like this. The child is still young, so you can\u2019t see clearly. The next time we do a four-dimensional photo, you guys will be able to see my child.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at Li Li in a lukewarm manner. He said, \u201cIf you speak a few more words, I will send you to Europe. Let alone a four-dimensional photo, I will make you so busy that you won\u2019t even be able to return home the day the child is born.\u201d\n Li Li looked indignant. \u201cYou are threatening me!\u201d\n Han Zhan sneered. \u201cWhen you become my boss, you can also threaten me.\u201d\n \u201cI...\u201d Li Li said,\u201d I\u2019ll shut up. \u201d\n Only then was Han Zhan satisfied.\n In the morning, at the meeting, Bei Zhan mentioned Zeus Airlines\u2019 new spokesperson.\n \u201cMr. Yan Jiang has already retired from the entertainment circles and his contract with our company is about to expire. We have selected a few new spokespeople for his image. Mr. Han, would you like to take a look?\u201d\n Han Zhan reached out his hand to Bei Zhan.\n Bei Zhan handed the candidate list to Han Zhan.\n Knowing that Han Zhan didn\u2019t know much about celebrities in the entertainment circles, Bei Zhan had someone write down every artist\u2019s information clearly, including their dirts and glories.\n Han Zhan flipped open the album and carefully read through the information of all the characters.\n Bei Zhan saw that his expression was cold, as if he didn\u2019t have anyone in mind. \u201cMr. Han, are you not satisfied?\u201d\n Han Zhan asked Bei Zhan, \u201cWho is the suitable candidate in your hearts?\u201d\n \u201cTo be honest, we do have a suitable candidate.\u201d Bei Zhan pointed at the artist album and said, \u201cThe artist on page three is our most suitable candidate.\u201d\n Han Zhan flipped to the third page and stared at the beautiful woman with long hair in the photo. He didn\u2019t say anything.\n Bei Zhan added. \u201cDu Xueyan became famous seven years ago. Since then, her popularity has increased instead of decreasing. She won the most valuable Grammy Award once. Be it her talent or her looks, she is very suitable for being the spokesperson for our airline.\u201d\n These were all things that Bei Zhan liked about Du Xueyan.\n Then, seeing that Han Zhan\u2019s expression remained unchanged, Bei Zhan couldn\u2019t guess what he was thinking. \u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Han?\u201d\n \u201cDu Xueyan can\u2019t be it,\u201d Han Zhan said.\n Everyone was surprised upon hearing this.\n Li Li beat Bei Zhan to it. \u201cDu Xueyan is planning to join the film and television industry soon. I believe her popularity and influence will be greater. It is the best decision for us to use her.\u201d\n After hearing Li Li\u2019s words, Han Zhan still didn\u2019t change his decision. \u201cDu Xueyan can\u2019t make it, let\u2019s change to someone else.\u201d Thinking of someone, Han Zhan suddenly smiled and said, \u201cI think Song Ci is quite good.\u201d\n All the interviewers were speechless.\n The head of Zeus Airlines\u2019 publicity department was also present today. Hearing this, he couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cMr. Han, we all admit that Madam is outstanding and beautiful. But Madam is not an artist after all. Her influence is not as great as that of the singer Du Xueyan. I hope you can consider this carefully, Mr. Han.\u201d\n At this moment, Han Zhan had become the King You of Zhou in the eyes of everyone.\n Han Zhan suddenly asked, \u201cEveryone knows Du Junfei, right?\u201d\n Everyone nodded. \u201cI know. He\u2019s Chinese director who won the Oscar Award for Best Director.\u201d Anyone who paid attention to the entertainment circles would know that he was outstanding.\n Han Zhan was satisfied that everyone knew of his outstanding name. He finally dropped a bomb.\n \u201cSong Ci will be acting as the female lead in Du Junfei\u2019s new movie. She has already signed the contract and will be joining the filming crew in eight days.\u201d\n Although everyone was shocked, they didn\u2019t doubt that Han Zhan was lying as he would not dramatize things.\n In the end, it was Li Li who was bold enough to speak out everyone\u2019s thoughts. \u201cAre you planning to let Madam join the entertainment circle to play, Mr. Han?\u201d He implied that he wanted to ask Han Zhan if he was the one who sponsored Song Ci\u2019s role in Du Feijun\u2019s movie.\n Han Zhan sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t you guys know how stubborn Du Junfei is? For his movies, from a small side character to the main lead, if it isn\u2019t someone he chose, he wouldn\u2019t want them, even if they forced their way into his production team.\u201d\n Everyone remained silent when they heard this.\n The news about Du Junfei being picky during filming had long spread.\n Han Zhan added, \u201cI also have a reason for recommending Song Ci as the spokesperson. Number one, Song Ci graduated from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China. She won the title of the prettiest school belle in four consecutive years and is quite well-known. Number two, she has a flight permit and is an official pilot of our company. Number three, she is very beautiful and is Zeus Corporation\u2019s beautiful lady boss.\u201d\n Han Zhan knocked on the table and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a good publicity point for a beautiful young lady boss who can fly a plane and personally endorse her own airline?\u201d\n The head of the publicity department fell into deep thought. He was obviously moved.\n Li Li and Bei Zhan exchanged glances and didn\u2019t object.\n They were convinced by Song Ci\u2019s looks. They also acknowledged Song Ci\u2019s professional capabilities. Everything that Han Zhan said made sense. Even if some people felt it was inappropriate, it was useless.\n Zeus Corporation belonged to Han Zhan and his words carried weight. There was no point in objecting.\n After the meeting, Li Li and Bei Zhan remained in the meeting room.\n Bei Zhan looked at Han Zhan with a face full of understanding. He said, \u201cYou have something against that singer called Du Xueyan?\u201d Others might not feel it, but Bei Zhan and Han Zhan were so familiar with each other that it was impossible for him not to notice how cold Han Zhan\u2019s tone was when he spoke of Du Xueyan.\n Li Li\u2019s eyes turned gossipy. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you two are old friends? The kind who were once in love.\u201d\n Bei Zhan glanced at Li Li.\n Li Li shrugged. \u201cA man wouldn\u2019t hate a beautiful woman for no reason.\u201d\n Bei Zhan said, \u201cYou look very experienced. I wonder if sister-in-law knows how experienced you are.\u201d\n Li Li immediately shut up.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t really want to talk about the past, but his two good friends were both looking at him intently, waiting for him to give an explanation. Only then did Han Zhan say, \u201cYes, she is my first girlfriend, the kind whom I loved and broke up badly with. I didn\u2019t choose her as my spokesperson not because I still hate her, but...\u201d\n Thinking of Song Ci, Han Zhan\u2019s cold expression became slightly gentler. \u201cBut my Zeus Airlines definitely can\u2019t use my ex-girlfriend as our spokesperson. Where will my wife put her face then?\u201d\n Bei Zhan and Li Li were both stunned by this news.\n Although they really wanted to get to the bottom of it, they also knew that Han Zhan wouldn\u2019t tell them anything he didn\u2019t want to say.\n Han Zhan looked at his watch and suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019m resting in the afternoon, I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d\n With that, he walked out.\n Bei Zhan raised his voice. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n Han Zhan waved his gloved right hand with his back facing them. \u201cTo fetch my wife.\u201d\n \u201cTsk.\u201d\n It was drizzling in the warm weather. Song Ci was wearing a dark purple jacket with her hair in a high ponytail. She was wearing sneakers and carrying a small luggage bag as she walked out of the airport. She saw Han Zhan at the entrance of the airport.\n \u201cSong Fei, Brother Jiang, Han Zhan is here to fetch me. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d Song Ci bid Song Fei and Yan Jiang farewell, before dragging her luggage and walking briskly over to Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan took the initiative to take her luggage and placed it in the boot.\n Song Ci noticed that Han Zhan had changed into a black SUV. She recognized that this car was produced by the Rolls-Royce Corporation, Curinan. Song Ci was stunned. \u201cBrother Han, this nasty black car is yours?\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned by this adjective \u2018nasty black\u2019.\n He stared at his own car, sinking into self-doubt.\n \u201cWhy did you want to change cars?\u201d Song Ci had known Han Zhan for so long. Han Zhan had always driven his Volvo, which was a low-profile Volkswagen model. He didn\u2019t look like a CEO at all. Now that he had changed into a luxury car, Song Ci suddenly felt like she was married to a wealthy man.\n Han Zhan was amused by Song Ci\u2019s feigned shock. \u201cAlright, stop teasing me.\u201d\n Song Ci sat in the car and touched here and there, as if she was suddenly overwhelmed by something. Han Zhan felt very helpless as he watched her touch everywhere. He really couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and said, \u201cAlright, save some strength. If you want to touch, go back and touch me.\u201d\n Long Yu was speechless.\n Song Ci\u2019s ears turned red and stopped touching anything.\n The car stopped at the underground carpark and Long Yu left. Song Ci was still sitting in the car and refusing to leave. Han Zhan asked her, \u201cYou\u2019re not getting off?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled shyly. \u201cBrother Han, that...\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Like a teenage girl in heat, Song Ci grabbed the zipper of her jacket and bit her lips. She said sheepishly, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve tried everywhere except in the car...\u201d\n She looked up and winked at Han Zhan. \u201cJust give it a try.\u201d\n She looked as shy as she could, but her words were as unrestrained as they could get.\n Han Zhan was amused by her manner.\n \u201cLet\u2019s give it a try then.\u201d\n \u2013\n Forty minutes later, the two of them returned home. Song Ci felt uncomfortable and hurried into the bathroom to take a shower.\n After coming out of the shower, Song Ci laid down on the bed and said listlessly, \u201cI\u2019m so tired. I want to sleep.\u201d\n The car was not as comfortable as she had imagined, but it was exciting.\n After the excitement, Song Ci felt very tired and quickly fell asleep.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t go to work in the afternoon. He laid down beside Song Ci and said, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d Song Ci played with the remaining three fingers on Han Zhan\u2019s right hand and asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n After a moment of silence, Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cI want you to film a promotional video for Zeus Airlines.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up. She hurriedly sat up and turned sideways to ask Han Zhan, \u201cYou want me to be your spokesperson?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci stretched out her hands with her palms facing up. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cHow much is the endorsement fee?\u201d\n Han Zhan replied in all seriousness, \u201cThe endorsement fee will not be a single cent less. Back then, Yan Jiang\u2019s endorsement fee was five million yuan for two years. Every year, he will film a promotional clip for the company and put up 10 publicity posters. Every year, he will fly alongside the plane once...\u201d\n Song Ci interrupted Han Zhan\u2019s report. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of this.\u201d\n Han Zhan stopped.\n He looked at Song Ci in confusion. \u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d\n Song Ci smiled. \u201cJust give me a kiss.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly stunned.\n Song Ci bent her fingers and urged Han Zhan. \u201cHurry up, Brother Han, give me a kiss.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n He lowered his head and kissed Song Ci\u2019s palm.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "207": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-208\n\n Chapter 207: Meeting A Love Rival, Needle Hidden in Cotton  The lady boss was going to personally film a promotional video for the airline, so the publicity department had specially found a media company with the best reputation in the country to let them spend the shortest time to come up with the most perfect advertising proposals. After Song Ci finished filming her movie, she would return to film her promotional video.\n As they were about to part, Han Zhan started to feel slightly frustrated and couldn\u2019t even calm down at work.\n In the end, he simply brought Song Ci along and let her accompany him to work. Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. She thought to herself, \u201cI\u2019m only going away for slightly more than a month. It\u2019s not like I won\u2019t be coming back after going abroad. Do you have to be so irritable?\u201d\n On the night before Song Ci set off, Han Zhan acted as if he had eaten explosives and acted rather fiercely. Song Ci had completely turned into a broken porcelain doll and laid weakly on the bed.\n The next morning, Song Ci woke up to find that she had regained some strength but was feeling very hungry. As she walked out of her room, she could smell the fragrance of breakfast.\n Song Ci hurried to the dining room in small steps and saw that Han Zhan had made a variety of breakfasts for her. The eggs were specially made into heart-shaped ones. Song Ci looked at that egg, then looked at Han Zhan who was silently eating with his head lowered.\n She sat down, cut the egg open with a knife, took a pair of chopsticks, and started eating slowly. Han Zhan looked up, stared at Song Ci\u2019s gentlemanly eating manner, and suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019m going abroad. Don\u2019t be so refined when eating at the set. You can be more rough.\u201d\n Song Ci was confused.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Song Ci was totally confused. She didn\u2019t understand what Han Zhan meant.\n Han Zhan said with a displeased expression, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that the way you eat is especially alluring?\u201d\n Song Ci: What?\n Song Ci felt the need to let Han Zhan know the truth. \u201cBrother Han, in this world, you are the only one who finds me eating attractive. This is called beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Han Zhan shook his head worriedly. \u201cYou are already very charming.\u201d In Han Zhan\u2019s eyes, Song Ci was elegant when she ate, alluring when she walked, witty when she spoke, and radiant when she smiled. She was glowing all over.\n Song Ci felt very uncomfortable at Han Zhan\u2019s worried expression. She said, \u201cBrother Han, actually, I\u2019m not as outstanding as you think I am. It\u2019s true. As you can see, when there\u2019s no one else around, I don\u2019t stand or sit well. The top socialite is just an empty shell.\u201d\n \u201cThe best thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life is to deceive you. If I can\u2019t even handle one of you, how can I provoke anyone else?\u201d\n Han Zhan placed his chopsticks on the plate and said, \u201cAnyway, wear a longer dress and smile less at people.\u201d\n Song Ci was silent for a few seconds.\n She vaguely understood why Han Zhan was so uneasy. She looked very much like her mother, Jiang Shiyu. To be remembered by such a ruthless person like Edward for his entire life, it was enough to show just how charming her mother was.\n Moreover, she looked so similar to his mother. With Jiang Shiyu as an example, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t help feeling uneasy.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d She agreed.\n Although he was very reluctant to part ways with Song Ci, Han Zhan still obediently helped Song Ci move her luggage into the car and personally drove her to the airport. After reaching the airport, Han Zhan used his privileges to accompany Song Ci into the VIP lounge. The two of them sat side by side but didn\u2019t speak.\n Only when she heard the boarding call did Song Ci stand up. Han Zhan suddenly grabbed her hand.\n Song Ci looked down at Han Zhan and suddenly felt a sense of reluctance. \u201cBrother Han...\u201d She was really afraid that if Han Zhan begged her not to leave, her heart might really soften and she would stay.\n But Han Zhan just said, \u201cYou must take good care of yourself. I will finish what I am doing as soon as possible, and see if I can spare some time to visit you at work and accompany you for a few days.\u201d\n A vibrant smile spread across Song Ci\u2019s face. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan pursed his lips and said, \u201cDon\u2019t smile at people like that in future.\u201d Like a little sun, those with dark hearts were most easily attracted to girls with such smiles.\n Although Han Zhan looked upright and tall, he actually had a dirty side to him. He didn\u2019t want to admit that he was attracted by Song Ci\u2019s smile from the start.\n Hearing this, Song Ci quickly shut her mouth, said goodbye to him, and turned to leave.\n As he stared at Song Ci\u2019s departing back view, the warmth in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes dimmed bit by bit, before finally turning cold.\n \u2013\n Song Ci slept all the way to France.\n When she woke up, it was noon in Paris.\n Song Ci alighted from the plane and stood at the airport. She looked up at the bright sun, feeling somewhat lost as she didn\u2019t know where she was. Shaking her head, she sprayed some moisturizing water on her face. Her skin was momentarily stimulated by the cold water and she felt slightly energized.\n The car sent by Du Junfei had already arrived at the airport. Song Ci boarded the car with Long Yu and headed for the hotel. Along the way, that female assistant called Tao Tao had given Song Ci a list of the cast and crew so that she could familiarize herself with them in advance.\n Song Ci opened the list of actors and saw the male lead.\n The male lead was called Damien Bell. He had acted in a major fantasy movie and was slightly famous as the second male lead. However, he was far from being famous.\n Song Ci was never familiar with the names of foreigners. To make it easier for her to differentiate them, Song Ci added a \u201cDa Da\u201d under Damien\u2019s name.\n She followed this method and wrote down a memorable nickname for each actor.\n Turning to the third page, Song Ci saw a Chinese woman in the middle. That woman was wearing a white suit, her black hair dyed brown. It was actually Du Xueyan. Song Ci widened her eyes and asked Tao Tao, \u201cDu Xueyan is also going to be in this show?\u201d\n Tao Tao nodded.\n \u201cFang...\u201d Seeing that Du Xueyan was going to play the role of\u201d Fang \u201c, Song Ci asked Tao,\u201d Du Xueyan is going to play the male lead\u2019s junior? \u201cThis Fang was the female lead in Coleman\u2019s real life and also one of his admirers. However, Coleman was stubborn and only wanted Rain.\n This junior sister\u2019s love was destined to be one-sided.\n Tao Tao said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The last time we went to Wangdong City for the pre-selection, we wanted to choose this role. At that time, Director Du had already taken a fancy to Du Xueyan, and Coleman had taken a fancy to you as the female lead. It was a pleasant surprise to find you.\u201d\n Knowing that Song Ci was the disciple of a good friend of the director, Tao Tao wanted to please Song Ci and leave a good impression. As a result, he spoke in a nicer manner. But Song Ci\u2019s heart was filled with the words \u201cDu Xueyan\u201d and she didn\u2019t notice any of this.\n She felt very stifled. It was the same feeling she had when she ate the chili and discovered that half of the chili was in her chopsticks while the other half was already in her stomach.\n Long Yu felt that something was amiss and hurriedly whipped out his cell phone to send Han Zhan a message.\n He had just taken out his cell phone when he was stopped by a hand.\n Long Yu looked up in shock and saw Song Ci shaking her head at him. \u201cDon\u2019t bother Brother Han over this matter. I will settle it well.\u201d She didn\u2019t want Han Zhan to be involved with his ex anymore.\n Long Yu could only nod in agreement. \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t tell Mr. Han.\u201d\n Song Ci arrived at the hotel where the film crew was staying and rested for the night to adjust her jet lag. The next morning, she changed into casual clothes and drove with Long Yu to the film set. Han Zhan had already prepared a car for Song Ci and it was still his Aoyu Number 1.\n Along the way, Long Yu drove while Song Ci read her own script.\n Song Ci arrived slightly later and missed the opening ceremony. She went straight to the filming location.\n As soon as Du Junfei saw her, she asked the fashion consultant to bring Song Ci for a fitting. The female lead didn\u2019t have many scenes and would only have 20 minutes of screen time after the movie was edited. However, there were as many as 10 outfits and four of them were luxury, custom-made gowns.\n Those outfits were all tailored according to Song Ci\u2019s body size, and their style was very similar to Chanel\u2019s style in the 1980s. Song Ci asked the stylist, \u201cThese outfits are designed according to Chanel?\u201d\n The stylist said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an imitation. These were all collected by Chanel in the 1980s. This black dress in your hands was worn by the French supermodel INDRA-Fressange.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked.\n She stroked the fashion jewel in her hand and felt very emotional. Someone once said that Du Junfei\u2019s work was worthy of being called a work of art. Every frame and scene could be portrayed in a movie poster.\n It was indeed Du Junfei\u2019s work. Everything about it was lavish.\n Song Ci changed into every outfit. The stylist thought it was okay and ticked it.\n Song Ci had just changed into a black tube dress when she heard someone say, \u201cColeman is here!\u201d\n \u201cPerfect timing.\u201d The stylist pulled Song Ci out of the changing room. She called out to Coleman. \u201cColeman, I believe Song Ci will definitely be the perfect female lead.\u201d\n At the sound of Song Ci\u2019s name, Coleman lifted his head and looked over.\n Coleman\u2019s pupils quivered when he saw Song Ci in a Chanel black tube dress. His eyes then turned hazy. The stylist was dumbstruck, but Song Ci\u2019s heart ached for him.\n Coleman must have recalled his first love.\n Song Ci walked up to Coleman and said, \u201cColeman, do I meet your expectations?\u201d After asking the question, Song Ci remembered that Coleman didn\u2019t like being asked questions. She was about to say something else when Coleman said, \u201cYou are truly a gift from heaven.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Are all French men so romantic?\n Coleman rubbed his eyes and turned to leave.\n He had arrived suddenly and left in a hurry, as if he had specially come over just to look at Song Ci.\n Du Junfei saw Song Ci\u2019s expression and suddenly waved at her. \u201cSong Ci, go on stage. Wear this outfit and I will take some publicity photos for you.\u201d Song Ci walked over.\n The film crew was filming the scene of Coleman meeting his best friend, Lyme, on his first trip to the orchestra. Lyme was Rain\u2019s elder brother.\n After filming one scene, Du Junfei let the two actors rest first. He gave Song Ci a violin and let her go on stage to shoot the publicity photos. Song Ci carried the violin and stood on stage.\n Du Junfei personally took 10 publicity photos of Song Ci and handed them to his assistant Tao Tao so that she could pass them to the post-production artist. Song Ci handed the violin to the prop master and was about to step down from the stage, when she saw Du Xueyan entering the set with her assistant.\n Du Xueyan was wearing a camel grey coat today. Her lovely long curly hair was draped behind her head, and her 10cm high heels accentuated her tall, slender figure. She looked very imposing.\n Her assistant, Tong Xin, brought two people along and sent coffee to each of the colleagues present. Du Xueyan walked over to Du Junfei and apologized. \u201cDirector Du, I am sorry I\u2019m late because of an interview.\n Du Xueyan was so famous that even Du Junfei didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cGo and change clothes.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Du Xueyan turned to leave but was suddenly stopped by Du Junfei. \u201cWait, the female lead has already arrived. You also have two scenes with her in the movie. Do you want to get to know her first?\u201d\n In the movie, after Rain and Coleman got to know each other, Fang and Rain had two scenes together. The dialogue was like a needle hidden in silk.\n They could be considered love rivals.\n Du Xueyan was slightly shocked. \u201cThe female lead is here? Where?\u201d\n \u201cOn stage.\u201d\n Du Xueyan looked up at the stage.\n On stage, the prop crew was moving their instruments. It was a hurried scene, but Du Xueyan saw Song Ci at first glance. Song Ci was simply too dazzling. Standing on stage, she felt like everyone was just a background, while she was the main character under the lights.\n Du Xueyan had always known that Song Ci was very fair\u2014the kind of natural fairness that many actresses sought after. But wearing a black dress, Song Ci really looked like a top-grade Song Ci\u2014clean, delicate, and beautiful.\n Realizing that Song Ci was the female lead of the movie, Du Xueyan\u2019s expression was slightly complicated. She and Song Ci had gone for an interview on the day of the pre-selection, but the director had chosen Song Ci to be the female lead.\n She had lost to Song Ci.\n Song Ci lifted the sides of her dress and walked down the side steps to walk up to Du Xueyan. \u201cHello, Miss Du, we meet again.\u201d The last time they met was at the auditions of \u201cLe Chi.\u201d\n Du Xueyan quickly regained her composure and stretched out her right hand. \u201cHello, Ms. Song. I didn\u2019t expect that we would be able to work together and film a movie one day. Ms. Song, are you planning to make a name for yourself in the entertainment circles?\u201d\n Smiling, Du Xueyan said meaningfully, \u201cI heard that Ms. Song is already married. How could that person from your family bear to let you step into this huge vat of pollution?\u201d It was common knowledge that the entertainment circle was a huge vat of pollution.\n Du Xueyan had purposely mentioned that person in Song Ci\u2019s family. She was obviously trying to drag Han Zhan out to stir up trouble.\n Song Ci grabbed Du Xueyan\u2019s hand and said the most hurtful words with her most beautiful smile. \u201cMiss Du, you probably still don\u2019t understand. Han Zhan has never been a stumbling block in the pursuit of my dreams. He is the kind of person who, if I want to fly, he is willing to be my stepping stone and let me fly higher.\u201d\n Hearing that, Du Xueyan\u2019s peerlessly beautiful face changed slightly. \u201cIs... is that so? That Mr. Han is rather magnanimous.\u201d Du Xueyan smiled very far-fetchedly. Her smile was even uglier than her crying face.\n Song Ci went along with Du Xueyan\u2019s words. \u201cOf course my Brother Han is magnanimous.\u201d She looked at Du Xueyan playfully and said, \u201cAlthough he was once hurt by the famous Miss Du, he still supports my decision to act.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was deeply shocked to suddenly hear about the past between her and Han Zhan from Song Ci.\n It was the first time she lost her composure in front of a stranger. She asked Song Ci in a hoarse voice, \u201cYou know about Han Zhan and me?\u201d She thought that she was a secret that Han Zhan would never tell Song Ci.\n Song Ci smiled calmly and said, \u201cWho hasn\u2019t been in a few relationships before? You\u2019re the person Brother Han once openly liked. Of course he can mention you to me openly.\u201d\n \u201cIt is never a shameful thing to like someone. It is a shameful thing to abandon someone. Don\u2019t you agree, Miss Du?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "208": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-209\n\n Chapter 208: Song Ci: Someone Wants to Steal My Cat  Faced with Song Ci\u2019s question, Du Xueyan actually lost the ability to speak. Her long lashes quivered slightly and she actually didn\u2019t dare to meet Song Ci\u2019s penetrating gaze.\n \u201cHe told you everything...\u201d Du Xueyan was in disbelief.\u201d How can that be? \u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help feeling pleased at Du Xueyan\u2019s reaction. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n Song Ci took a step forward and leaned her head close to Du Xueyan\u2019s face. In a voice that only they could hear, she said to Du Xueyan, \u201cMiss Du, do you know what kind of situation is it that a person would calmly mention his ex to his current girlfriend?\u201d\n Du Xueyan bit her red lips and remained silent. She heard Song Ci say arrogantly, \u201cOnly when he has completely let go of his ex.\u201d\n Du Xueyan clenched her fists tightly.\n Right at this moment, Du Junfei\u2019s deep voice rang out from behind the two of them. \u201cDu Xueyan, Song Ci, what are you two doing? Go and change your clothes!\u201d Du Junfei saw that the two of them were already talking non-stop and lost his temper. He hollered. \u201cDo you want me to open a teahouse for you two and pour you a cup of tea for a chat?\u201d\n Song Ci looked up and winked at Du Junfei. She said mischievously, \u201cDirector Du, you should treat girls more gently. You are so fierce. No wonder you can\u2019t find a wife.\u201d\n Du Junfei\u2019s eyelids twitched and felt like hitting someone.\n Song Ci hurriedly turned and entered the changing room, before Du Junfei could lose her temper. Du Xueyan also pretended to be calm and apologized to Du Junfei, before entering her own changing room.\n After changing clothes, Du Xueyan sat on the chair and got the makeup artist to do her makeup.\n Tong Xin was tidying up Du Xueyan\u2019s belongings. She didn\u2019t know that Han Zhan was standing between Du Xueyan and Song Ci. She told Du Xueyan what she had observed. \u201cSister Xue, I heard that this Song Ci isn\u2019t an artiste but Wangdong City\u2019s top socialite. Oh yes, her husband is Zeus Corporation\u2019s boss.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci has never acted in a movie before. This is her first time acting in a movie and she can already be the female lead in a leading role in a movie. I think it\u2019s very likely that her lover spent a lot of money on the production team.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was distracted and didn\u2019t speak.\n Seeing that Du Xueyan didn\u2019t respond, Tong Xin mustered up the courage to continue complaining. \u201cSong Ci is so lucky to have married a rich husband. Everything she does is twice the result with half the effort. It has not been easy for you, Sister Xue, and you worked your way up. Song Ci cannot compare to you, Sister Xue.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s face suddenly darkened as she scolded Tong Xin. \u201cTong Xin, watch your words.\u201d\n Tong Xin was stunned. Seeing that Du Xueyan was displeased, he hurriedly shut his mouth. He looked at the makeup artist and saw that this Caucasian looked like he didn\u2019t understand anything. Only then was he relieved.\n After putting on her makeup, Du Xueyan got her assistant and makeup artist to leave.\n Du Xueyan sat alone in her chair, quietly staring at the flawless woman in the mirror. Song Ci\u2019s words kept replaying in Du Xueyan\u2019s mind.\n [Han Zhan has never been a stumbling block in my pursuit of my dreams. He is the type of person who is willing to be my stepping stone if I wish to fly, so that I can fly higher.]\n Du Xueyan was a very intelligent person. How could she not hear Song Ci\u2019s underlying meaning? Song Ci was telling Du Xueyan that a person, whom she had abandoned like a burden, would actually sacrifice himself to help her succeed.\n It was her fault for treating her backer like a burden and kicking him away.\n For someone like Song Ci, you could say that she was arrogant, domineering, and rude, abusing her beauty just because she was young and beautiful. But just because she got Han Zhan before anyone else, she won!\n Du Xueyan controlled her emotions and adopted the attitude of an actress. She devoted herself fully to the filming of the movie. This was her first movie as she moved from the music scene to the entertainment circles. She must not screw up her acting!\n Du Xueyan had originally thought that Song Ci would make things difficult for her or purposely go against her in the upcoming work. After all, she was Zeus Corporation\u2019s lady boss now. With her status, she could do anything to Du Xueyan.\n Unexpectedly, after that, Song Ci really treated Du Xueyan as an ordinary colleague. She never provoked or mocked her again.\n Du Xueyan had been on guard for a while now. Seeing that Song Ci was either practicing the piano or mulling over her scenes everyday, she was relieved.\n This was Song Ci\u2019s first time acting and she was truly a greenhorn with no acting experience. She didn\u2019t know how to walk or act. Moreover, as Rain had grown up in England, she spoke fluent London English while Song Ci spoke American English.\n After discovering Song Ci\u2019s language shortcomings, Du Junfei specially found a teacher who could speak English in a London accent for her. Song Ci followed the team the entire day and practiced her lines and pronunciations with the teacher whenever she wasn\u2019t filming, making her voice slightly hoarse.\n Luckily, Long Yu was well-prepared and made Song Ci tea everyday. Song Ci would drink it whenever she was thirsty and her throat was quite well protected.\n Like her, Du Xueyan also had the same problem.\n Not only was Song Ci a newbie, even Du Xueyan, who was acting in a movie for the first time, was no better than her. She also didn\u2019t speak British English, but Du Xueyan had experience filming MVs and variety shows. Although her acting skills were not good, she was good at finding the camera. In this aspect, she was better than Song Ci.\n On this day, when Du Xueyan was not filming, she held her script and practiced her lines with the teacher for more than an hour. After that, she opened the bottle of water and was about to drink it when a fair hand suddenly reached over.\n In that hand was a gray thermos flask.\n Du Xueyan turned to look at Song Ci beside her with a puzzled expression.\n Song Ci stuffed the thermos into Du Xueyan\u2019s hands and said expressionlessly, \u201cIt\u2019s good for the throat to drink tea. Don\u2019t let your throat get hoarse and affect the progress of the filming.\u201d\n Du Xueyan hesitated for a moment before grabbing the thermos flask. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cMy assistant bought the tea in your cup. Brother Han bought the one in my cup.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was speechless.\n She felt depressed but didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cWhy, are you showing off to me?\u201d Du Xueyan realized that Song Ci was a rather interesting person. Logically speaking, with their relationship, they should never interact with each other again, but Song Ci took the initiative to speak to her.\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cYes, it feels so good to flaunt my husband\u2019s love for me to my husband\u2019s first love.\u201d Song Ci purposely winked at Du Xueyan and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity you can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n Du Xueyan unscrewed the cap and took a sip. It was not tasty at all, but she didn\u2019t mind.\n \u201cSong Ci.\u201d Du Xueyan suddenly called out to her.\n Song Ci gazed down at Du Xueyan. \u201cYou have something to say?\u201d\n Du Xueyan said, \u201cSong Ci, I know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n \u201cTell me.\u201d\n Du Xueyan said with understanding, \u201cAfter Han Zhan\u2019s identity as Zeus International\u2019s CEO was revealed, you are worried that I will regret it if I know that he is doing very well now and turn back.\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her nose and remained silent.\n Seeing that Song Ci didn\u2019t object, Du Xueyan smiled instead. Her laughter was very mild, without mockery or insults. \u201cI indeed regret it.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s expression changed slightly.\n Indeed...\n Song Ci told Du Xueyan with an unfriendly expression. \u201cDu Xueyan, it\u2019s not that when you regret it and look back, that person will still be waiting for you at the same spot. Everyone will leave after growing legs. When you leave, others will too. It\u2019s useless even if you regret it.\u201d\n These words were truly hurtful. Du Xueyan\u2019s beautiful face also turned gray.\n She shook her head and said, \u201cI regret it now. Not because Han Zhan is so successful now, but because I regret abandoning him at the darkest point of his life.\u201d\n Du Xueyan already had money and fame. There was no difference between marrying a rich person and marrying an ordinary person. She was wealthy enough and was her own queen, so she didn\u2019t need to find another powerful backer.\n What Du Xueyan truly regretted was hurting Han Zhan in the past.\n \u201cThat year, I was the one who took the initiative to pursue Han Zhan. It was indeed my fault for breaking up with him under such circumstances. Song Ci, I can understand your hostility toward me.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s brows twitched. She sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re very capable then. You took the initiative to woo him, got him, and dumped him.\u201d Her heart ached especially for Brother Han.\n Du Xueyan just smiled at Song Ci\u2019s sarcasm.\n \u201cSong Ci, you don\u2019t have to be so hostile towards me. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t harass Han Zhan anymore. That year, when Han Zhan joined the military, I went to the music school alone to study. At that time, we were apart more than we were together, and our relationship was already in danger. Even if we didn\u2019t break up then, we would have broken up later. It\u2019s just that our breakup looked too ugly, so I can\u2019t help feeling guilty and regretful thinking about it.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s words were heartfelt. She thought that if she could redo it, she would definitely find a suitable opportunity to sit down and calmly break up with Han Zhan. That way, they might even be able to smile and wish each other well.\n Song Ci gave a stifled chuckle before turning to leave.\n After returning to the hotel that night, Song Ci mulled over Du Xueyan\u2019s words several times, but still couldn\u2019t trust her. Unable to fall asleep, Song Ci opened WeChat and contacted Song Fei.\n It was still dark at Song Fei\u2019s side and she was awoken by Song Ci. Song Ci was enveloped in a suffocating atmosphere and didn\u2019t speak. She just gazed at Song Ci expressionlessly.\n Song Ci coughed and pretended to be wronged as she complained to Song Fei. \u201cSister, I met Han Zhan\u2019s first love.\u201d\n Song Fei raised her brows. \u201cYou guys fought?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cWhat fight? We are all reputable people. It\u2019s too ugly to fight.\u201d\n \u201cFool.\u201d\n Song Ci was used to being scolded by Song Fei and didn\u2019t mind. Song Ci\u2019s eyes darted around and her mischievous look amused Song Fei. \u201cAlright, tell me, why are you looking for me?\u201d\n \u201cElder sister, do you know any hackers?\u201d\n Song Fei opened her eyes and glanced at Song Ci lazily. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cElder Sister, can you help me check Du Xueyan\u2019s webpage and social media browsing history for the past week?\u201d Du Xueyan said that she didn\u2019t love Han Zhan anymore, but Song Ci remained doubtful.\n Her Brother Han was handsome and charismatic\u2014anyone who came into contact with him would have their eyes on him. She didn\u2019t believe that Du Xueyan really didn\u2019t have any feelings for Han Zhan anymore.\n Song Fei resisted the urge to abuse her little sister. She said, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed!\u201d Then she hung up.\n Song Ci thought that Song Fei had rejected her request and even cursed Song Fei several times in her heart, before going to bed. The next morning, Song Ci promptly got up, packed up, and followed Long Yu to the set.\n On the way there, Song Ci finally had time to take out her cell phone.\n She opened her WeChat and saw more than 10 screenshots and messages from Song Fei. Song Ci was instantly energized.\n She opened the photo and saw that the screenshots were all related to Han Zhan. There were also a few screenshots of the QQ space photo album, which contained photos of Han Zhan in high school.\n Song Fei: [Congratulations, your man\u2019s ex still seems to be obsessed with your man. Look, she still has photos from high school and she looks at them repeatedly.]\n Song Fei: [Little fool, in such a situation, you can either generously give your man to the other party or kill her. Choose one of the two. Don\u2019t be merciful.] Song Fei was indeed Song Fei. She was straightforward and never sloppy.\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Du Xueyan\u2019s acting skills were not bad. If not for Song Ci\u2019s deep understanding of Brother Han\u2019s charm, she might really have believed Du Xueyan\u2019s lies yesterday!\n This time, Song Ci completely agreed with Song Fei\u2019s point of view. To deal with a love rival, one could either grant it or kill it.\n It was impossible for her to give Han Zhan to someone else. How could she, Song Ci, have her meat forcefully pried out of her mouth? Since she couldn\u2019t bear to give Han Zhan away, she could only kill Du Xueyan.\n Song Ci arrived at the set with an enigmatic expression and saw Du Xueyan.\n Du Xueyan had already changed into her costume. She smiled and waved the thermos in her hand at Song Ci. \u201cThank you for yesterday. After drinking the tea and sleeping yesterday, my throat feels much better today.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s elegant and friendly manner made Song Ci frown.\n Seeing Song Ci\u2019s cold and sickly expression, Du Xueyan thought she was ill. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you feeling unwell?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head and said, \u201cI raised a cat. That cat is especially lovable. I have someone by my side who claims to not like my cat, but is secretly scheming how to steal it...\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s sharp and profound eyes landed on Du Xueyan\u2019s slightly changed expression. She asked Du Xueyan, \u201cMiss Du, do you think I should give my cat to her? Or should I kill that cat thief?\u201d\n Du Xueyan was no fool. She understood Song Ci\u2019s hint. \u201cSong Ci, you still think I can\u2019t forget Han Zhan?\u201d The surrounding foreigners also didn\u2019t understand Chinese, so Du Xueyan spoke to Song Ci in a normal volume.\n Song Ci\u2019s face was cold. \u201cYou know what you are thinking.\u201d Song Ci poured the contents of her cup into the dustbin. She said, \u201cDu Xueyan, don\u2019t steal my man. You cannot afford the price.\u201d\n After that, Song Ci and Du Xueyan stopped talking.\n Song Ci was a chatterbox. There was no one on set who could chat with her, so Song Ci would play games whenever she had nothing to do. Song Fei had recently fallen in love with the game eating chicken. In the first few days, she even brought Song Ci along to fight for territory. But Song Ci was a black hole in the game. If she threw out an explosive package, it would blow both herself and Song Fei up.\n Song Fei was convinced and rejected bringing Song Ci along.\n After no one brought Song Ci to play games, Song Ci started to play the gluttonous snake herself. On this day, Song Ci posted a screenshot of herself playing the gluttonous snake on her social media.\n Han Zhan saw this message and could imagine how bored Song Ci must be over there. He looked at the calendar. It had been 18 days since Song Ci left.\n It was time to visit her.\n \u2013\n That afternoon, the setting sun hung high in the west sky, elongating the contours of the city and making this bustling city look lazy.\n The film crew arrived at the Paris Conservatory for filming today.\n Song Ci was wearing a bubble-sleeved blouse and a pair of denim shorts. She sat on a large tree in the academy, swaying her fair, well-proportioned calves. Damien, the actor playing Coleman, stared at the person in the tree with an infatuated expression.\n Du Junfei patted Damien\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStop looking. She has a husband.\u201d\n Damien rubbed his nose awkwardly. He stared at Song Ci\u2019s youthful and beautiful face. \u201cSong Ci looks very young. Is she 20 years old?\u201d\n \u201cAlmost 23.\u201d\n \u201cYou Chinese are just so young.\u201d\n Worried that Damien might have ulterior motives toward Song Ci, Du Junfei reminded him. \u201cHer husband is someone you can\u2019t afford to offend. Don\u2019t harbor any ill intentions.\u201d\n Since Du Junfei had already made it so clear, if Damien still didn\u2019t realize the seriousness of this matter, then he would be an artiste in vain. He suppressed the fluttering in his heart and said in a self-deceiving manner, \u201cI don\u2019t have any other thoughts. I just feel that she\u2019s very cute.\u201d\n Both of them bit their cigarettes and remained silent.\n \u201cAlright, filming is about to start.\u201d\n This confession scene was a very important one. All of them had to capture Song Ci from Coleman\u2019s point of view. In his eyes, Rain was a perfect angel with no flaws.\n As a result, this scene had to be shot perfectly.\n Du Junfei was best at shooting characters. He had to personally shoot this scene.\n Song Ci had already memorized the screenings in advance and had also discussed with Du Junfei about the positioning that she needed to take note of during the shoot. In the actual shoot, Song Ci\u2019s performance exceeded Du Junfei\u2019s expectations.\n The rays of the setting sun shone through the gaps in the leaves and landed on Song Fei\u2019s hair and body. She looked like an angel in her dreams. Song Ci tilted her head slightly and looked mischievously into the camera. Song Ci\u2019s eyes lit up as she saw her lover walking over.\n Du Junfei zoomed in on Song Ci\u2019s face. Song Ci\u2019s skin was porcelain smooth and supple. Her eyes were mesmerizing and captivating.\n Not to mention Damien, even Du Junfei was moved by this beautiful scene. Of course, his heart was moved from an artistic point of view and had nothing to do with love.\n \u201cCut!\u201d\n This was a one-time long shot.\n Next was the scene of Song Ci falling from a tree and being caught by Coleman. It was their first kiss scene.\n Before filming started, Han Zhan had invested quite a bit of money into the production team. He only had one request \u2014\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t have any kissing scenes.\n But Du Junfei had the guts to reject Han Zhan\u2019s request. He felt that this kiss scene was very important. If it was cut, it would lose the flavor of the movie. Faced with the stubborn Du Junfei, Han Zhan had no choice.\n ]When Han Zhan discreetly appeared at the set, Song Ci happened to be filming that kissing scene.\n In order to not affect Song Ci\u2019s performance during filming, Han Zhan squatted behind the production crew. As he gazed at Song Ci kissing a strange man under the setting sun, his heart welled up with jealousy.\n Du Xueyan had heard that Song Ci was going to shoot a kissing scene with Damien today and had specially stayed behind to watch the show. She sat beside Director Du Fei and watched Song Ci\u2019s performance. Seeing that Song Ci\u2019s face was still perfect in the camera, Du Xueyan couldn\u2019t help feeling that it was so good to be young and have such good skin.\n Song Ci never felt anything when kissing a stranger.\n The first take was an NG.\n NG meant that she would have to kiss Damien again, or even many more times. Song Ci felt slightly anxious. She couldn\u2019t find her bearings and her face was slightly red from anxiety.\n But Damien was very considerate and comforted her. \u201cSong, don\u2019t feel burdened. It\u2019s your first kiss scene, everyone will fail.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Song Ci turned and said to Du Junfei, \u201cDirector Du, can I make a call?\u201d\n Du Junfei raised his brows and smiled. \u201cFor your husband?\u201d\n Blushing, Song Ci quietly left the venue. Walking to a less crowded area, she took a deep breath before taking out her cell phone and calling Han Zhan.\n The call was picked up very quickly.\n \u201cBaby Ci.\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s intoxicating voice, Song Ci felt very wronged. \u201cBrother Han.\u201d Her voice sounded slightly nasal.\n Han Zhan stood at the back of the crowd and looked at the girl who was hiding away to make a call. He felt a tinge of pity for her. \u201cAre you crying?\u201d Han Zhan walked towards Song Ci step by step and asked softly, \u201cHave you suffered?\u201d\n Of course, Song Ci wouldn\u2019t tell Han Zhan about her problems and distract him from his work schedule. \u201cNo, I just encountered some problems during filming. I keep failing takes and want to hear Brother Han\u2019s voice to seek inspiration.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cHow?\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her nose. \u201cJust say whatever you want.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThen turn around. The inspiration is behind you.\u201d\n Song Ci was confused.\n She seemed to have heard Han Zhan\u2019s voice.\n \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you turning around?\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s voice sounded from behind Song Ci, followed by the voice through the phone.\n Holding her cell phone, Song Ci turned around in shock.\n She turned and fell into a strong, broad embrace.\n Song Ci smelled the familiar scent of a wood-paneled, cold perfume. She looked up in surprise, her bewildered eyes directly meeting those deep gray-blue eyes. Song Ci widened her eyes. \u201cBrother Han...\u201d\n Song Ci covered her mouth as tears welled up in her eyes.\n Han Zhan pulled her into his arms. \u201cShh, so many people are watching. Won\u2019t it be very embarrassing if you cry?\u201d\n Song Ci pulled away Han Zhan\u2019s coat with both hands, buried her little head in his arms, and secretly cried for half a minute. When she looked up again, Song Ci\u2019s face was still wet from her tears, but she was smiling.\n \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI arrived when you fell from the tree and was caught by that actor.\u201d\n Song Ci blushed slightly. \u201cYou also saw how I kissed him?\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan looked slightly displeased. He wiped Song Ci\u2019s lips vigorously before asking, \u201cCan\u2019t feel anything? Can\u2019t act in a kissing scene?\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Brother Han, I suddenly regret it. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have come to film at all.\u201d Song Ci complained slightly about Shen Yubei. She said, \u201cTeacher\u2019s idea might not be right. I am so capable. With my capabilities, I can still shine brightly at the violin international competition.\u201d\n But she couldn\u2019t go back on her words. After signing the contract, Song Ci had to finish filming this movie.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThis movie will be beneficial to you. Since it has already started, there is no way to give up halfway.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n \u201cHere, Brother Han will help you find a feel.\u201d Han Zhan directly cupped Song Ci\u2019s face, lowered his head, and very gently touched Song Ci\u2019s lips.\n After parting, Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cRemember, the person you are kissing is autistic. He is filled with fear and insecurity towards this world. Kissing is a foreign concept to him. It is a process to accept new things.\u201d\n \u201cGive him a light kiss to test his reaction.\u201d\n Song Ci listened intently and acknowledged.\n Han Zhan lowered his head again. This time, his kiss became slightly bolder. Then, their lips met...\n When they separated again, Song Ci\u2019s face was red and her heart was racing.\n She heard Han Zhan\u2019s gentle voice instructing her. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s love, it will make one\u2019s heart race. Coleman is autistic, but he is also human. When he kisses Rain, he will blush and his heart will race.\u201d\n \u201cTry to kiss someone like you\u2019re kissing your lover instead of thinking about completing your mission.\u201d\n Having said that, Han Zhan let Song Ci rest on the spot for a few minutes, while he went back to the remote corner of the set to continue squatting.\n Three minutes later, Song Ci returned. This time, her attitude had clearly changed. She even took the initiative to tell Du Junfei that she was ready.\n Du Junfei nodded and resumed the kissing scene.\n ]To be honest, Du Junfei didn\u2019t expect this to be a direct pass. But Song Ci suddenly felt like she had taken a magical pill. She knew how to act and also knew how to look for cameras.\n When she stood on tiptoe and carefully kissed Damien, Du Junfei felt as if he had traveled back in time and personally witnessed the scene of Coleman and Rain\u2019s first kiss under the tree 36 years ago.\n The entire set was silent. Only Damien\u2019s heartbeat was erratic and out of control.\n \u201cCut!\u201d\n Song Ci took half a step back and gave Damien a faint smile before turning to look for Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan pulled Song Ci\u2019s hand directly to the toilet. Like performing a magic trick, he took out a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush. \u201cBrush your teeth.\u201d Han Zhan considerately squeezed the toothpaste onto the toothbrush and handed it to Song Ci.\n Song Ci was dumbstruck.\n \u201cAre you so possessive, Brother Han?\u201d Song Ci cupped a handful of water and rinsed her mouth, before accepting the toothbrush and brushing it seriously. After brushing her teeth, Han Zhan used a wet tissue to wipe the water off the corners of Song Ci\u2019s lips.\n After throwing the tissues into the dustbin, Han Zhan suddenly cupped Song Ci\u2019s face and pressed her against the wall to kiss her.\n Knock knock knock.\n The sound of high heels clicking against the ground approached.\n Someone was coming.\n Song Ci frantically tried to push Han Zhan away, but he continued to press her against the wall and kiss her domineeringly. Song Ci immediately closed her eyes, as if if she closed them, no one else could see her.\n \u201cSister Xue, I couldn\u2019t tell that Song Ci\u2019s acting skills were not bad... Uh!\u201d Tong Xin suddenly stopped in her tracks, turned around, and whispered to Du Xueyan, \u201cSomeone is kissing in the toilet.\u201d\n Du Xueyan pushed her child aside and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. They are kissing and I am going to the toilet. We won\u2019t disturb each other.\u201d Du Xueyan walked in and saw a man pressing a woman against the wall beside the sink.\n The man was tall and the girl was not short. But in the arms of the man, she appeared especially petite.\n Du Xueyan felt that the girl\u2019s figure looked somewhat familiar. She took another look. At this moment, Song Ci turned around and closed her eyes to catch her breath.\n After seeing Song Ci\u2019s face clearly, Du Xueyan suddenly stopped in her tracks.\n The woman is Song Ci. Then...\n Du Xueyan slowly averted her eyes and stared at that tall, muscular man.\n That man was wearing a short jacket over a black down jacket. Under his slim suit pants hid a pair of long, strong legs. Han Zhan was slender and thin when he was young, but when he was an adult, he was more like a majestic lion, every muscle in his body full of strength.\n Du Xueyan felt terrible.\n It turned out that when Han Zhan and Song Ci kissed, they were so wild and unrestrained.\n Du Xueyan didn\u2019t feel good seeing her first boyfriend and his wife kissing here. Du Xueyan instinctively turned to flee, but at this moment, Han Zhan suddenly turned around. \u201cWho is it?\u201d His sharp brows were filled with the viciousness of someone who had just been disturbed.\n Du Xueyan quickened her pace.\n Song Ci opened her eyes and saw a figure hurriedly escaping. She said, \u201cI am going to the toilet. Brother Han, wait for me outside.\u201d\n \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d\n \u201cTwo minutes.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan let go of Song Ci and watched as she entered the female toilet. Only then did he throw Song Ci\u2019s toothbrush and toothpaste into the dustbin, turned, and walked out of the toilet.\n He narrowed his eyes as he stared at the fleeing figure.\n \u201cDu Xueyan?\u201d Han Zhan stopped her.\n Du Xueyan stopped in her tracks.\n She hesitated for a moment, but finally turned around and waved at Han Zhan, pretending to be calm. \u201cHan Zhan, are you here to visit?\u201d\n Han Zhan walked toward her and stood half a meter away from her. He looked down and asked, \u201cAre you free to chat?\u201d\n Du Xueyan nodded.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a cafe outside. Let\u2019s go there to talk.\u201d\n Hearing this, Du Xueyan glanced at the toilet. \u201cYou\u2019re not waiting for Song Ci?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll get my assistant to pick her up later.\u201d\n \u201c... Alright.\u201d\n The two of them walked out of the school.\n On the way, Han Zhan gave Song Ci a call. Du Xueyan heard Han Zhan speak to Song Ci in a gentle voice. \u201cBaby Ci, I met Du Xueyan and have something to talk to her about. Wait for me in the car with Long Yu later. I will go over to look for you after we are done talking.\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Okay.\u201d\n Han Zhan hung up and looked up to see the cafe. \u201cThis one then.\u201d\n Du Xueyan had no objections and entered the cafe with Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan asked Du Xueyan, \u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d\n Du Xueyan said, \u201cYou forgot that I only drink mocha.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan ordered a mocha and an iced American drink for himself. After the waiter left, Han Zhan said, \u201cIt has been so many years, I don\u2019t remember what kind of coffee you like anymore.\u201d Just like how he had long forgotten about him once liking Du Xueyan.\n Du Xueyan\u2019s expression was slightly ugly. She looked like she was about to cry but she held it in.\n The coffee was still not ready and Du Xueyan felt awkward. She took the initiative to chat with Han Zhan and said, \u201cSong Ci, isn\u2019t 23 yet, right? In that case, she is 10 years younger than you.\u201d\n ]\u201dMmm. Actually, I\u2019ve known Song Ci for a long time, before we broke up.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s expression suddenly froze. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d We broke up eight years ago. How old was Song Ci eight years ago? \u201cSong Ci was still underage then, right? Han Zhan, you...\u201d\n \u201cYou are overthinking.\u201d Han Zhan stopped Du Xueyan\u2019s wild imagination and said, \u201cI did know Song Ci before we broke up. The first time I met her was at Bijiang.\u201d\n Hearing the name Bijiang, Du Xueyan\u2019s rosy face paled slightly. Bijiang was a place where Han Zhan lost two fingers and his dreams.\n Han Zhan told Du Xueyan, \u201cMy fingers were broken by the cement when I was trying to save Song Ci.\u201d\n Du Xueyan asked in astonishment, \u201cSong Ci is the child you saved?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n The waiter served the coffee.\n Han Zhan held the iced Americano but didn\u2019t drink it. Having gotten used to drinking nourishing hot tea, Han Zhan was already not used to drinking coffee. He swirled the coffee and said, \u201cDu Xueyan, don\u2019t feel guilty towards me and don\u2019t have any old feelings for me.\u201d\n Ignoring Du Xueyan\u2019s broken expression, Han Zhan said coldly, \u201cI am doing very well now. There is also another person who loves me more than you back then.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s lips quivered. After a long while, she finally called out. \u201cHan Zhan...\u201d Her voice was filled with love, reluctance, and regret.\n \u201cHan Zhan, if...\u201d\n Du Xueyan stared at the coffee art on the mocha. She blushed in embarrassment and said softly, \u201cIf not for Song Ci\u2019s appearance and if I took the initiative to return to your side, would you still have accepted me?\u201d\n Han Zhan seemed to have guessed that she would ask such a silly question. His expression didn\u2019t change, and he maintained that cold, self-possessed manner. He said, \u201cDu Xueyan, you might have forgotten that on the night we confirmed our relationship, I once said that I hate people who fooled others and played with my emotions the most. It disgusts me.\u201d\n Gazing at Du Xueyan\u2019s peerlessly beautiful face, Han Zhan asked her coldly, \u201cAm I cheap or stupid? Why should I accept another woman who disgusts me? It\u2019s like a maggot\u2014you obviously disgust it, but you still pretend to love it\u2014that\u2019s going against yourself.\u201d\n Du Xueyan had always known that Han Zhan was a cold and heartless person. Back then, she had spent a year to gradually move his heart. Now that so many years had passed, Han Zhan\u2019s heart that had once softened for her had once again hardened.\n She was no longer the most special girl in Han Zhan\u2019s heart.\n Du Xueyan couldn\u2019t accept this reality.\n She was still that prideful girl. She deceived herself by thinking that Han Zhan would never forget her. After all, she was the publicly acknowledged male God reaper in the entertainment circles. Who knew how many men had fallen for her!\n Du Xueyan bit her lips and asked Han Zhan indignantly, \u201cSince you hate me so much and are so unwilling to see me, why did you still come to see me? Han Zhan, aren\u2019t you afraid that your little jealous lover will misunderstand if you see me privately?\u201d\n Not enraged by Du Xueyan\u2019s words, Han Zhan pushed the glass away. He placed his hands on the table and stared quietly at Du Xueyan.\n Being stared at by Han Zhan like this, Du Xueyan realized that her heart, which no longer fluttered easily for a man, suddenly went into turmoil. All these years, the only person who could make Du Xueyan\u2019s heart go into turmoil was Han Zhan.\n \u201cI came to see you to get something back from you,\u201d Han Zhan said.\n Du Xueyan instinctively asked, \u201cWhat... what do you want?\u201d She started calculating in her mind the things that Han Zhan had given her in the past\u2014they were actually not valuable items.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIn the past, when we were in love, I made a promise to you. I promised you that I will take care of you for life. No matter what you did wrong, as long as you apologize seriously, I will forgive you.\u201d\n Han Zhan leaned slightly forward and told Du Xueyan, \u201cNow, I want to take back that promise.\u201d\n No amount of exquisite makeup could conceal the paleness of Du Xueyan\u2019s face.\n Her hand that was holding the coffee cup started to tremble. She couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t agree?\u201d After asking, Du Xueyan saw that Han Zhan\u2019s gaze instantly turned cold, without the slightest warmth in it.\n Du Xueyan\u2019s heart sank.\n She heard Han Zhan say, \u201cThen I will use all the power I have to ban you from the world. Everything you care about and possess will be gone from you.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was still unconvinced. She glared at Han Zhan angrily and scolded him. \u201cHan Zhan, do you really think you can do whatever you want just because you have money?\u201d How could he treat me like this! He had clearly indulged me in the past!\n n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes, Du Xueyan\u2019s anger was just a bluff.\n Han Zhan pursed his lips, looking very cold.\n He spoke again in a cold tone. \u201cThe reason why you suddenly decided to act is not as pompous as what you said in the interview about wanting to try different new things. Instead, it is because you have throat cancer and need to undergo surgery as soon as possible. Once you undergo surgery, your vocal cords will definitely be affected. Since you can\u2019t sing anymore, of course you can only make the best use of your time to switch careers.\u201d\n \u201cThe movie that the director is directing now is the key to whether you will succeed in changing careers. You have no way out now. Du Xueyan, it will be even easier for me to kill you than to kill an ant.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure you want to fight me head-on?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "209": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-210\n\n Chapter 209: The Mysterious Big Boss  Han Zhan was never a good person. Being a patriotic Chinese who didn\u2019t challenge the law was a seed planted in Han Zhan\u2019s heart by his grandfather after more than 10 years.\n But Han Zhan was Edward\u2019s child. He was born cold and cruel. The kindness and evil that he had seen were unimaginable to Du Xueyan. It was easy for Han Zhan to pinpoint Du Xueyan\u2019s weak spot.\n Du Xueyan was so angry that her eyes were red.\n Gripping the coffee cup tightly with both hands, she gritted her teeth and asked Han Zhan, \u201cHan Zhan, just to reassure your lovely wife, you\u2019re going to kill me. We were in love once after all. Are you really so heartless?\u201d\n Du Xueyan didn\u2019t believe that Han Zhan was such a person.\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan seemed to have recalled the time when they were in love when they were young, and the coldness in his eyes softened slightly.\n Seeing this, Du Xueyan heaved a sigh of relief and struck while the iron was hot. She said, \u201cHan Zhan, you are already married. Even if I still have delusions about you, I won\u2019t do anything outrageous, and definitely won\u2019t take the initiative to make Song Ci unhappy. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to get to this point. I also love my own feathers very much.\u201d\n \u201cAs for that promise you mentioned, I will return it to you.\u201d She gave Han Zhan a heart-stopping smile, her eyes slightly curved when she smiled, and there was an alluring glow in her eyes. \u201cHan Zhan, even if we can\u2019t be lovers, we can still be friends.\u201d\n Han Zhan gazed at Du Xueyan\u2019s seductive smile. Not only did he not agree immediately, but his eyes also turned cold. He said, \u201cOnly old lovers who are still in love will be friends. There\u2019s no need for us to be friends anymore.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Du Xueyan\u2019s smile froze on her face.\n She watched as Han Zhan pushed aside his coffee cup and stood up. The moment he stood up, Du Xueyan suddenly realized how tall Han Zhan was, how broad his chest was, and how he gave one a sense of security.\n In a daze, Du Xueyan heard Han Zhan say again, \u201cDu Xueyan, don\u2019t provoke Song Ci and don\u2019t think of me. If you still want to be your big star, behave yourself. Don\u2019t think of me\u2014there\u2019s no outcome.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked through the window and nodded at the beautiful woman standing by the road outside the cafe. Du Xueyan slowly turned her head and saw Song Ci waving at Han Zhan under the night sky. In contrast to the neon lights, Song Ci looked even more alluring and charming than the night in Paris.\n Du Xueyan clutched her coffee cup tightly. From the corner of her eye, she saw Han Zhan striding out from beside her, walking straight and determinedly towards that girl called Song Ci. Only when their car was far away did Du Xueyan lower her head and look at the table in front of her, her eyes gradually turning hazy.\n It turned out that being stabbed in the heart by someone you liked was such a terrible thing.\n \u2013\n As soon as they got into the car, Song Ci asked Han Zhan directly, \u201cBrother Han, what did you tell Du Xueyan?\u201d She couldn\u2019t stand any nonsense and would ask clearly if she was curious about something.\n Han Zhan knew that Song Ci would pursue this matter.\n He opened the voice recording function on his cell phone and handed it to Song Ci. \u201cI\u2019ve recorded it. Listen to it yourself.\u201d Afraid that Song Ci would get suspicious, Han Zhan specially recorded it.\n Song Ci was slightly shocked.\n \u201cYou even recorded it?\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded and said, \u201cGoing behind your back to meet my ex-girlfriend and recording the conversation is good for both of us.\u201d Han Zhan couldn\u2019t bear the risk of Song Ci misunderstanding him and losing her.\n Song Ci gave him a meaningful look and suddenly said, \u201cHan Zhan, it\u2019s so terrible being your ex-girlfriend.\u201d Song Ci was indeed very happy that Han Zhan was so clear about Du Xueyan. But thinking of how Han Zhan could be so cold and heartless towards the person he loved in the past, Song Ci felt even more terrified.\n Knowing what Song Ci was afraid of, Han Zhan turned to her and said, \u201cSo, just be a good girl and be my current girlfriend.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded with mixed feelings.\n She took out her earphones and opened the recording file.\n After hearing Han Zhan and Du Xueyan\u2019s conversation, Song Ci felt both pleased and could not help but light a candle for Du Xueyan.\n What a pitiful ex.\n After dinner at an old restaurant with a good reputation, Song Ci and Han Zhan went shopping at the Empress Dowager Mall for over an hour.\n Song Ci was a fashion master. Every year, she would buy a large number of outfits and shoe bags with new designs. Many outfits would be of no use after wearing them several times. As a result, Song Ci specially opened up an account for herself. It was specially designed to be used for secondary sales of branded outfits and shoes.\n Han Zhan and Long Yu obediently followed behind Song Ci and held her items.\n Returning to the hotel, Song Ci sat on the carpet to clean up her loots. \u201cBrother Han, this is for you.\u201d Song Ci tossed an exquisite box to Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan grabbed the box and looked down. He was shocked. \u201cA watch?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Han Zhan opened the box and saw the watch inside. A look of fondness flashed across his eyes.\n Song Ci had selected a super thin spinning wheel watch from the Royal Oaks series. The dial was a smoky blue color and possessed a reserved, low-profile luxury. It suited Han Zhan\u2019s character very well.\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t wait to take out the watch and wear it on his wrist. He walked up to the mirror and sized it up carefully. He liked it so much that he couldn\u2019t bear to part with it. \u201cBaby Ci, it\u2019s very nice.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled. \u201cI chose it carefully. Of course it suits you.\u201d\n Song Ci tidied up her clothes and hung them in the cupboard. She put aside her clothes for tomorrow and went to take a shower. After her shower, Song Ci walked out of the bathroom in her meticulously-prepared pyjamas only to realize that Han Zhan had already fallen asleep on the bed.\n Song Ci tiptoed over to the bed and smoothed out Han Zhan\u2019s furrowed brows.\n In order to meet me, he must have been very busy these few days.\n In the middle of the night, Song Ci was in a daze and suddenly felt suffocated. She frowned and opened her eyes.\n No wonder she found it difficult to breathe.\n \u201cBrother Han, why are you awake?\u201d Song Ci turned on the lights.\n Han Zhan covered Song Ci\u2019s eyes with his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was too sleepy last night and fell asleep.\u201d Although he had fallen asleep, Han Zhan was still thinking about his little snack. After waking up in the middle of the night and seeing Song Ci sleeping beautifully beside him, Han Zhan decided to be a beast first.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes were covered. She hugged Han Zhan\u2019s arm and asked him, \u201cWhy are you covering my eyes?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cYour eyes are hazy. I feel like I\u2019m committing a crime.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Taking off Han Zhan\u2019s hand, Song Ci picked up her cell phone and looked at the time. It was already past midnight.\n Song Ci suddenly pushed Han Zhan away. \u201cWait, the ceremony is not good enough.\u201d\n Han Zhan was pushed onto the bed. He tilted his head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\n Song Ci stuck out her tongue mischievously at Han Zhan. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss the ceremony. Wait a minute.\u201d With that, Song Ci even turned off all the lights in the room.\n The room suddenly darkened again. Han Zhan was momentarily stunned before asking Song Ci curiously, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cBrother Han, you are not allowed to peek. I will tell you when I am ready.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, let me know when you are ready.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Song Ci walked out of the bedroom in the dark.\n Han Zhan heard the sound of the zipper closing. He wiggled his ears and asked Song Ci, \u201cStill not done?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll be done soon.\u201d\n Han Zhan acknowledged.\n After about two minutes, Han Zhan heard Song Ci say, \u201cAlright, Brother Han.\u201d Her voice became very soft, as if it came from a confined space.\n Han Zhan opened his eyes and turned on the lights. He didn\u2019t see Song Ci in the room.\n He went to the toilet first and opened the wardrobe, but there was no sign of Song Ci at all. Han Zhan frowned as he came to the small living room. The furnishings were simple, and Han Zhan saw everything in the room at a glance.\n In the end, his attention was snatched away by the luggage on the floor. This luggage was brought over by Han Zhan today. It was 32-inch and very big. Before Han Zhan squatted down, he coughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to open the luggage!\u201d\n Song Ci remained silent and pretended to be mysterious.\n Han Zhan found it funny. He slowly opened the zipper of the luggage, and a piece of black silk material fell out. Han Zhan tugged at Song Ci\u2019s skirt and said, \u201cLook, I caught a little mouse.\u201d\n Song Ci giggled.\n Only when he heard her voice did Han Zhan open the luggage fully.\n However, when he saw Song Ci\u2019s position in the box, his smile suddenly faded.\n Song Ci curled up her legs and laid pitifully at the bottom of the box. She was holding an A4 paper. On the paper was a sentence she had hastily written with a fountain pen. It read:\n I am willing to become a sweet to make up for the pain you suffered when you were young.\n May you be as brilliant as the Milky Way for the rest of your life.\n Han Zhan, Happy Birthday!\n Perhaps it was because he was getting older and older that one\u2019s heart was more and more easily moved. Just a few simple words had actually moved Han Zhan. Han Zhan\u2019s eyes turned slightly hot. He pressed his hand to his forehead and sighed somewhat helplessly. \u201cSong Ci, why are you so lovable?\u201d\n \u201cOtherwise, how can I be worthy of the nickname \u2018Baby Ci\u2019?\u201d Song Ci lifted her arms towards Han Zhan and said coquettishly, \u201cQuickly carry me up. It\u2019s uncomfortable like this.\u201d\n Han Zhan carried his present out of the luggage.\n Carrying Song Ci directly into the room, Han Zhan placed her on the bed and said, \u201cNow, I am going to open my present.\u201d This night, Han Zhan was exceptionally gentle when he wanted Song Ci, as gentle as the moonlight outside the window.\n After the initial warmth, Han Zhan hugged Song Ci\u2019s waist, stroked her abdomen with his right hand, and lightly tapped her abdomen with his fingertips. He asked Song Ci, \u201cHow did you know today is my birthday?\u201d\n Song Ci wiggled in his arms. \u201cI already knew. I went to the Department Store to buy you a watch the moment I arrived in Paris and sent it back. By right, it should have arrived today.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d Han Zhan said, \u201cMy cell phone has been switched off during the flight. The delivery company might have already called me.\u201d Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cWhere is the address written?\u201d\n \u201cYour company.\u201d\n \u201cLet me ask my assistant if she received it.\u201d\n It was 3.30pm in France and Wangdong City happened to be in the morning. Han Zhan called his assistant and told him that at 8.30am this morning, he had indeed helped Han Zhan sign a package and placed it in his office.\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan instructed his assistant. \u201cKeep that package well and don\u2019t lose it.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, Mr. Han.\u201d\n After hanging up, Han Zhan hugged Song Ci even more tightly. \u201cFrom now on, you must be by my side on every birthday, Baby Ci.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. She thought of something and said, \u201cI hope that on your birthday next year, there will be another person in our family. He will celebrate your birthday with me.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart thumped as he imagined that scene. \u201cAlright. If we have a child, regardless of gender, we will call him Ban Ban as his nickname, alright? Our partner [1. \u2018Ban ban\u2019 was a cute way of referring to one\u2019s partner]. I hope he will be safe and healthy and be by our side for the rest of our lives.\u201d\n Song Ci liked this nickname very much. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s call him Ban Ban.\u201d\n As the two of them chatted, sleepiness overwhelmed Song Ci and she fell asleep first.\n Hugging Song Ci, Han Zhan stared at her for a long time before finally falling asleep at daybreak.\n The next day, Song Ci applied for leave from the production team and accompanied Han Zhan to enjoy all the delicacies in Paris.\n On the third day, Song Ci had to work.\n When she went to film, Han Zhan was also openly by her side. This time, Han Zhan specially wore a custom-made black suit and tie, looking like a cold, noble, domineering CEO.\n The first time Damien saw Song Ci\u2019s husband, he was stunned by the intensity of her husband\u2019s aura. As a result, when they were filming, Damien couldn\u2019t quite get over that fact and he had NGs several times.\n Han Zhan was leaving tomorrow. Before leaving, Han Zhan invited all the main actors, directors, as well as the main crew members for a delicious dinner at ASPIC Restaurant.\n That meal was delicious and expensive. Everyone liked it.\n After he left, rumors of Mr. Han being a gentleman and doting on his wife continued to spread.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t have many scenes. After Han Zhan left, she stayed in Paris for another 20 days before her final scene. This final scene was about Song Ci falling into the sea.\n Du Junfei was a picky person. If he wanted to film at sea, he brought the entire crew to the Mediterranean Sea.\n In order to pursue a realistic film effect, Song Ci had to personally act out sinking in the sea. And because of her previous life\u2019s experience, Song Ci developed deep-sea phobia and was worried that she wouldn\u2019t be able to film this scene well.\n After Du Junfei found out about Song Ci\u2019s phobia, he decided to use a body double for her.\n Song Ci thought for a moment and rejected him. \u201cIf it were someone else in this scene, it wouldn\u2019t feel right. I still want to give it a try myself.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s give it a try then.\u201d Du Junfei agreed.\n Under the blue sky, the Mediterranean Sea was as beautiful as a blue jewel. A cruise ship cruised quietly on the surface of the sea.\n Coleman had also arrived for Song Ci\u2019s final scene. He was seated in the audience seats on the cruise ship.\n The filming site was very quiet. Dressed in a dark green tube dress, Song Ci stood on the deck performing with a violin in hand. The stars shone brightly on Song Ci\u2019s head, she was so beautiful that it was unreal.\n Coleman gazed at Song Ci in a daze, his eyes gradually turning dark...\n The boat started to sink. In the process, someone touched Song Ci and her back hit the railing. She fell into the sea. Song Ci was still holding onto her violin tightly.\n The script read:\n [As she was escaping, someone knocked into Rain. She was wearing high heels and lost her balance. She took a few steps back and her waist hit the railing. She rolled into the sea and everything happened in an instant. When she sank, she was still holding her violin.]\n The water was cold and she was gradually swallowed by it.\n Rain and her violin sink to the bottom of the sea, followed by the love that Coleman has devoted his entire life to.]\n Song Ci had held her breath when she fell into the water, but she was so terrified that she forgot how to swim. She knew that Du Junfei had arranged for a rescue team to hide in the water, and her life was not in danger.\n Her body was swallowed by the sea. Fear made her struggle non-stop. As she struggled, Song Ci forgot about Du Junfei\u2019s earlier advice. She opened her mouth and the sea water poured into her mouth.\n It was as if Song Ci had returned to the night of the car crash in her previous life. She laid alone by the side of the Yulong River, blood dripping from her eyes. She gazed at the dark waters, her body cold...\n Just then, Song Ci seemed to see someone pouncing towards her.\n They must be the lifeguards Director Du sent over.\n Song Ci lost consciousness and was brought to the deck of the boat next door.\n Someone was pressing on her chest for CPR. Song Ci heard someone cry in English, \u201cYou are not allowed to die, Rain!\u201d\n \u201cRain, please don\u2019t die.\u201d\n Seeing that the drowning girl was still unconscious, Coleman\u2019s wrinkled hands were trembling. \u201cJiang Shiyu, please, open your eyes and look at me.\u201d\n Jiang Shiyu...\n Jiang Shiyu?\n \u201cCough, cough!\u201d Song Ci suddenly opened her mouth and coughed out several mouthfuls of seawater.\n \u201cShe\u2019s awake!\u201d Du Junfei heaved a sigh of relief. Only then did he stop pressing on Song Ci\u2019s chest and helped her up.\n Song Ci leaned into Du Junfei\u2019s arms. She looked at Coleman and saw that his hands were trembling non-stop. He said repeatedly, \u201cJiang Shiyu, you are not allowed to die, you are not allowed to die...\u201d\n Understanding what happened to Coleman, Song Ci\u2019s gaze towards him suddenly turned extremely pitiful.\n Song Ci slowly raised her hand and grabbed Coleman\u2019s cold hand.\n Coleman was stunned by her grip. He stopped talking to himself and slowly looked up at Song Ci. His old eyes were filled with uneasiness, fear and tears.\n Song Ci lowered her head and kissed Coleman\u2019s fingers.\n \u201cColeman, I\u2019 m fine.\u201d\n Coleman stared at Song Ci for a very, very long time before finally calming down.\n He pulled his hand out of Song Ci\u2019s grip and stood up slowly. He turned and walked into the cabin. As he walked, he muttered to himself. \u201cRain is dead. Rain is dead. My Rain is dead. She is not Rain.\u201d\n Du Junfei told Song Ci, \u201cColeman\u2019s condition is acting up.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI am going to visit him.\u201d\n \u201cYou should go take a shower and change clothes first. Don\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Okay.\u201d\n \u2013\n The ship docked along the coast of Palermo, Sicily, Italy.\n Coleman stood beside the road that faced the sea and gazed at the pitch-black sea in the darkness. Hearing footsteps approaching, Coleman didn\u2019t turn back. His eyes were filled with nostalgia as he gazed at the sea.\n Song Ci stood beside Coleman. The sea breeze was strong. She wrapped her coat tightly around herself and quietly stood beside him.\n Coleman continued. \u201cAfter she fell into the sea, I came to the Mediterranean Sea. I drifted for a month on the sea but I couldn\u2019t find her. I couldn\u2019t even find her bones.\u201d\n To search for the bones of one\u2019s lover in the vast sea\u2014how hopeless was that?\n Song Ci turned to look at Coleman\u2019s aged face.\n She recalled the last time they met in Wangdong City, Coleman had asked him when her mother had passed away. At that time, he must have recognized her as Jiang Shiyu\u2019s daughter.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart ached slightly for Coleman.\n My mother is truly a femme fatale. Many outstanding men were infatuated with her. The reclusive genius pianist Coleman, the arrogant drug lord Edward, my pure and gentle father...\n \u201cColeman, she is dead.\u201d Although it was very cruel, Song Ci still had to let him know the truth. \u201cColeman, you can\u2019t wait for your Jiang Shiyu to return.\u201d\n Coleman\u2019s lips moved as if he were about to cry.\n \u201cYou look very much like your mother when she was young, especially when you played the violin.\u201d Coleman picked up the violin in front of him and handed it to Song Ci. \u201cI found your mother\u2019s violin at sea.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked.\n She looked down at the violin. Under the dim light of the street lamp, she saw the name engraved on it \u2014\n Rain.\n Song Ci\u2019s hands were trembling as she held that violin. She licked her lips and told Coleman, \u201cThank you for keeping this violin for my mother, Coleman.\u201d\n The night breeze ruffled Song Ci\u2019s long hair. Her porcelain face was covered in a layer of sadness. The silent Song Ci looked even more like the Rain in Coleman\u2019s memory. Coleman suddenly said, \u201cCan you play The-Rose for me?\u201d\n The-Rose was a song from an old 1979 movie, \u201cTears of Song\u201d. It was an English song that had been around for decades.\n Coleman told Song Ci, \u201cDuring my birthday, Rain performed this song for me. All these years, I can always remember that melody.\u201d Coleman started humming. He was very talented at piano, but his singing was terrible. The tune he hummed was not pleasant at all.\n Song Ci listened to Coleman\u2019s humming. In the dark, she lifted her violin with her left hand and held her bow with her right. She started to play that very popular song.\n Coleman felt like he was in a forest with the morning sun rising. Layers of faint mist gently caressed his face.\n The gentle and lingering sound of the violin brought Coleman back to that summer night 36 years ago. Rain stood in his yard, dressed in a white dress, and performed \u201cThe Rose\u201d. She plucked the rose from the yard, placed it on her ear, and said to him with a smile, \u201cColeman, you are my Rose.\u201d\n Roses represented love in the West.\n Jiang Shiyu said that Coleman was her love.\n Before he knew it, tears were streaming down Coleman\u2019s face.\n After the performance ended, Song Ci hugged the violin. She looked at the teary-faced Koleman and said softly, \u201cYou have protected this violin very well, Coleman. I will cherish it very much.\u201d\n Coleman said nothing.\n The autistic Coleman didn\u2019t like to be intimate with others. But after a moment of hesitation, he hugged Song Ci gently.\n Song Ci was stunned. She didn\u2019t resist but stretched out her arms and hugged Coleman gently.\n It was a farewell hug.\n Coleman released Song Ci and turned to leave without saying anything.\n The road wound along the coastline. Coleman walked down the winding road alone. Since his mother\u2019s death, he had never been willing to let anyone accompany him. For the rest of his life, he would live alone.\n The night was dark and the waves splashed against the reef. Coleman suddenly heard the sound of a violin.\n Twinkle, twinkle, little star.\n How I wonder what you are.\n Coleman stopped in his tracks. He slowly turned back to look at the young girl with the radiant smile on her face.\n Coleman suddenly smiled.\n He turned and continued to walk. As he walked, he sang: \u201cTwinkle-twinkle-little-starr, How-I-wonder-what-your-are...\u201d\n \u2013\n After sending Coleman off, Song Ci stayed by the sea alone for a while. She felt cold and turned to return to the hotel. Disgusted by her high heels, she took off her high heels, hugged them with one hand and carried the violin with the other, as she walked back to the hotel.\n In the cold night, there were very few pedestrians on the streets but quite a few vehicles.\n Song Ci walked for more than 10 minutes before returning to the hotel. Long Yu followed her at a distance. Seeing that Song Ci had returned to the hotel, he remembered that he had run out of cigarettes and went to buy one.\n Song Ci put on her shoes at the entrance of the hotel and entered the lobby. She turned a corner and entered the lift.\n The lift door opened. Song Ci entered and pressed the button to light up her own level. Song Ci looked down at the violin in her hand again. Previously, her vision was dim outside and she couldn\u2019t see the violin clearly.\n The lift was brightly lit. Only then did Song Ci realize that although this violin was old, it was very glossy. One look and one could tell that it was a treasure that had been carefully taken care of.\n Just then, Song Ci heard footsteps.\n The footsteps were regular and deep.\n Song Ci looked up curiously and saw five men in black walking over. There were two men in front and two men behind them. A tall, handsome man was in the middle. Han Zhan was considered the tallest man Song Ci had seen, but this man was slightly taller than Han Zhan.\n The man had broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and long legs. He was wearing a loose black-grey windbreaker and black-framed glasses. His eyes were cold but his gait was breezy.\n Song Ci had heard of the big bosses in Sicily, and her instincts told her that she had met one.\n Song Ci quietly took half a step back until her heels touched the lift. Only when there was no way out did Song Ci stop moving.\n The group of people saw that there was a woman inside the lift. They hesitated for a moment before entering. Song Ci noticed that even after entering the lift, the man in the windbreaker was still being protected by the other four people.\n Being alone in the lift with five well-built men, Song Ci was very tense and didn\u2019t dare to look away.\n They were speaking in Italian and Song Ci couldn\u2019t understand a single word.\n When the lift reached level 9, Song Ci realized that the group of people in front were also leaving. She waited for the big boss to leave, before following him out.\n Realizing that Song Ci had followed them out, the bespectacled man suddenly turned around and shot her a cold look.\n Song Ci, who had a strong will to live, hurriedly raised her hands and explained in a low voice. \u201cI live here.\u201d\n That man was still looking at her, frowned slightly as if he suspected her.\n Song Ci had no choice but to take out her room number and her own passport. She said in English, \u201cI am a customer of this shop. I am Chinese. Look, I have my own identity card and passport.\u201d\n Song Ci felt like she was about to be murdered and dumped at any moment. The joints of her hands that were holding the ID card were stiff.\n The man glanced at her again before turning to leave.\n Song Ci waited for them to leave before returning to her own room.\n After returning to her room, Song Ci hurriedly tucked herself into bed and hid under it for a long while, before feeling warm all over. Sicily is too scary. I have to buy a plane ticket and fly back home as soon as possible tomorrow.\n Song Ci called Long Yu.\n \u201cMadam?\u201d Long Yu bit his cigarette and squatted at the entrance of the hotel to smoke.\n Song Ci asked, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n Long Yu said, \u201cI\u2019m smoking downstairs.\u201d\n Song Ci told him, \u201cStop smoking and come up. You will sleep in the room next to mine tonight.\u201d\n Long Yu stood up and put out his cigarette. As he walked into the hotel, he asked Song Ci, \u201cMadam, what happened?\u201d\n Song Ci told Long Yu what she had just experienced. After hearing it, Long Yu told Song Ci, \u201cMadam, rest well. Don\u2019t listen to what you shouldn\u2019t hear or see what you shouldn\u2019t see. You will be fine.\u201d\n I\u2019ve already hidden herself under the blanket. What else is there for me to see and hear? \u201cI won\u2019t do anything rash. I will sleep now. Come back quickly.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Long Yu returned to level 9 and knocked on the door to Song Ci\u2019s room. \u201cMadam, I am back. I am sleeping right beside you. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s voice came from the room. \u201c...Okay.\u201d\n Song Ci thought to herself that the next time she went on a long trip, she must bring a female bodyguard with her. If she were to encounter such a situation again, she could sleep with the female bodyguard. But then again, such situations were very rare and would only happen once in her life.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t tell Han Zhan about this as she didn\u2019t want him to worry.\n The next morning, Song Ci went downstairs to have breakfast with Du Junfei and the rest. Her scenes were complete and she was returning home after breakfast.\n The heater was turned on in the hotel and Song Ci came downstairs in a dress. By the time she arrived at the restaurant, Du Junfei and the actor playing Lyme had already arrived.\n The three of them had breakfast together. Song Ci exchanged a few words with Lyme before approaching Du Junfei. She asked, \u201cSecond Master, how many points will you give me for my performance this time?\u201d\n Du Junfei pointed at the eggs on the plate.\n Song Ci raised her brows in anger. \u201cWhat do you mean? Zero points?\u201d\n Du Junfei placed his fork on the left side of the egg.\n Song Ci smiled radiantly. \u201cTen points?\u201d\n Du Fei acknowledged.\n After teasing Song Ci enough, Du Junfei asked her, \u201cWhat time is your flight?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201c11.30pm.\u201d\n \u201cOur flight is at 10pm. We can\u2019t travel together then.\u201d Du Junfei wiped his mouth with a napkin and said to Song Ci, \u201cYour husband is rich. The next time I return to the country, you must treat me to a meal at the most expensive restaurant.\u201d\n Song Ci patted her chest. \u201cNo problem!\u201d\n After parting ways with Du Junfei and the rest at the restaurant, Song Ci saw that it was still early and wanted to take a walk by the sea.\n Putting on her windbreaker, Song Ci arrived at the beach.\n Mondello Beach was very famous locally. The soft sand was very comfortable to step on. Some pretty ladies were not afraid of the cold and had already changed into bikinis to enjoy the sunlight on the beach.\n Song Ci stared at those girls\u2019 good figures and thought: Pardon me for being blunt, but everyone here is trash. Once I take off my clothes, your figures won\u2019t be enough.\n However, she just thought about it. Song Ci would never change into a bikini to compete with them.\n The sun was shining brightly and Song Ci also felt rather warm. She took off her jacket and shoes. Holding her jacket and shoes, she stepped on the soft white sand and walked along the coastline.\n Song Ci arrived at a desert with very few people. She saw some seashells on the ground and put down her clothes and shoes. She squatted on the beach and used her hands to search for seashells.\n She didn\u2019t intend to take them away either. She just felt that they were beautiful and wanted to find them to wash them clean and take a few photos as a memento.\n ]ong Ci had just dug up two or three shells, when she suddenly heard a magnetic male voice say from the top of her head, \u201cThe deep-sea shells are the most beautiful. These are all rubbish.\u201d This person spoke in Chinese. Although his accent was inaccurate, the pronunciation of each word was correct.\n Holding a shell, Song Ci turned around in shock to see a tall man standing behind her.\n The man was wearing only a pair of beach pants and a pair of shades that covered his eyes, revealing the contours of his handsome face. He had sexy bronze skin and every muscle in his body was filled with explosive power.\n Sexy, yet deadly.\n Upon seeing him, Song Ci\u2019s pupils suddenly narrowed.\n It\u2019s that man in the windbreaker from last night!\n A chill ran down Song Ci\u2019s spine. She slowly stood up and realized that she had just reached his chin. Song Ci took a step back and looked up at the man. \u201cYou followed me?\u201d\n The man said, \u201cThis beach is mine.\u201d\n The man pointed at a notice board not far away. Song Ci looked over and saw a paragraph of Italian.\n She was speechless.\n She couldn\u2019t understand Italian.\n Song Ci felt very apologetic for barging into someone else\u2019s private territory. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d Song Ci picked up her clothes and shoes and turned to leave. Just then, two men in black appeared out of nowhere.\n They blocked Song Ci\u2019s path.\n Song Ci instinctively wanted to call for help, but tried her best to remain calm. She tried her best to speak as calmly as possible. \u201cSir, my bodyguard is waiting for me by the roadside beside a car. I told him that I will only be out for half an hour.\u201d\n She looked at the diamond-studded watch on her wrist and said, \u201cThere\u2019s still 10 minutes to half an hour.\u201d Her heart was racing, but her expression remained calm and steady. \u201cMy husband is very influential in China. If anything happens to me here, he will definitely not let it go.\u201d\n The man crossed his arms as he watched her speak. After she finished speaking, he tapped his left index finger on his right arm a few times before smiling. \u201cLittle cutie, I won\u2019t eat you up.\u201d\n Song Ci had goosebumps all over at that \u201clittle cutie\u201d.\n Reaching out, he snatched the little shell from Song Ci\u2019s hand. With a gentle squeeze, the man crushed it into bits.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyelids twitched wildly. She felt like her bones were being crushed instead of her shell.\n \u201cDo you want to see the most beautiful shell?\u201d The man lowered his head and said to her, \u201cWait for me for 15 minutes.\u201d With that, he took off his sunglasses and changed into a pair of goggles. Without any diving equipment, he just jumped into the sea.\n Song Ci was stunned by the man\u2019s actions.\n With two burly men guarding her from both sides, there was no way Song Ci could leave. She hugged her clothes and stood tall and straight by the coast, gazing at the churning Mediterranean Sea.\n Song Ci looked down at her watch. 10 minutes had already passed and there was no sign of the man emerging from the sea. Song Ci felt that he might already be dead.\n She felt slightly uneasy and asked the burly man beside her in English, \u201cDid your boss drown in the sea?\u201d\n The two of them seemed to be deaf and kept silent.\n Song Ci pouted.\n Two more minutes passed. Just when Song Ci thought there was going to be another corpse in the Mediterranean, that person emerged.\n Is he even human? How did he manage to hold his breath in the sea for more than 10 minutes?\n Song Ci stared at this crazy man in shock and remained silent.\n The man took off his sunglasses and walked over to Song Ci amidst the waves. He held a large shell in his right hand and used his left palm to wipe the seawater off his face in a rather wild manner.\n Walking up to Song Ci, the man suddenly reached out a hand to the bodyguard.\n The bodyguard was like a worm in a man\u2019s stomach, knowing all his thoughts. He took out a knife and handed it to the man. The man held the knife with his right hand and in a few movements, he sliced off the meat inside the shell and threw it on the beach.\n He handed the cleaned shell to Song Ci. \u201cLittle cutie, this is for you.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n She looked down at the shell. Faint blue color could be seen on the back of the fan-shaped shell.\n It\u2019s indeed very pretty.\n The man added very considerately, \u201cI heard that China\u2019s customs are quite strict. I\u2019ve already cut off the meat inside the shell. You can bring this shell back to China.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci still didn\u2019t reach out to take the shell.\n Seeing that Song Ci didn\u2019t move, the man suddenly smiled. He played with the shell and suddenly said, \u201cHoff will be very happy to see my present for you.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly confused. \u201cHoff?\u201d It was the first time Song Ci heard this name and she said to the man, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know a man called Hoff.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I forgot. Ever since that old man fetched him, he changed his name.\u201d The man bent down and leaned close to Song Ci\u2019s face. His gray-blue eyes stared into Song Ci\u2019s brown ones. He said softly, \u201cHan Zhan, is that his name now?\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "210": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-211\n\n Chapter 210: Song Ci Is Pregnant  Song Ci didn\u2019t expect to hear Han Zhan\u2019s name from this mysterious big boss.\n Song Ci\u2019s mind went blank for a few seconds.\n She restarted the program and asked the man boldly, \u201cYou know Han Zhan? Who are you?\u201d\n \u201cIf he is willing to tell you, you will naturally know who I am.\u201d That man stuffed the shell into Song Ci\u2019s palm and said, \u201cSend my regards to Hoff on my behalf. Tell him that Sicilio really misses him.\u201d With that, he left with his two bodyguards.\n Carrying that shell, Song Ci fell into an icehouse under the hot spring sun.\n Once he left, Long Yu ran over in big strides. \u201cMadam, why did you walk so far alone?\u201d\n Long Yu stared at the few people who had left. He tilted his head and asked Song Ci, \u201cDo you know them, Madam?\u201d\n Song Ci raised the shell in her hand and told Long Yu, \u201cLong Yu, I was nearly murdered and dumped into the sea.\u201d\n Long Yu\u2019s expression turned slightly serious as he asked Song Ci, \u201cWho are those people?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d Song Ci stuffed the shell into Long Yu\u2019s hands. \u201cBut they know Han Zhan.\u201d\n Long Yu narrowed his eyes as his expression turned grave.\n Song Ci pointed at the noticeboard and asked Long Yu, \u201cDo you know Italian?\u201d\n Long Yu stared at the signboard, looked at it, shook his head, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Wait a minute, I have a friend who knows.\u201d\n Long Yu whipped out his cell phone, took a photo of the board, and sent it to a friend.\n She only waited a few seconds, before the other party replied to Long Yu\u2019s message.\n After reading the message, Long Yu kept his cell phone and said to Song Ci, \u201cMadam, that is a warning to be careful of drowning.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n He\u2019s indeed a big boss. Even when he\u2019s lying, his expression remains unchanged.\n And he said this was his private beach. Where is his sense of shame?\n His face is probably as big as a washbasin.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d\n On the way back, Song Ci had concocted a \u201clove-hate relationship\u201d script for Han Zhan and that man. But she got tired of thinking about it and fell asleep on the plane.\n When she woke up again, the plane had already flown into China\u2019s airspace.\n Song Ci went to the toilet to wash her face with cold water. She returned to her seat and fastened her seatbelt.\n The plane landed safely in Wangdong City.\n After being away for more than a month and meeting such a scary man in Balmore, Song Ci only felt assured when her feet were firmly planted on the soil of China.\n ...\n Sheng Hui Technology had recently launched a new high-tech holographic game cabin. It was officially launched today.\n When Song Ci landed, Sheng Hui Technology was holding a product launch.\n After the VR glasses were launched, they caused a global sensation. But after so many years, the technicians were still unable to solve the problem of the neural interface.\n Meanwhile, the holographic gaming cabin that Sheng Hui Technology launched today had successfully broken through the difficult problem of the \u201cneural interface\u201d, allowing the computer to connect directly with the brain. The brain could transmit instructions to the computer, and the computer could also block the connection between the human brain and the human body.\n This was a high-tech product developed by Sheng Hui Technology in eight years. It was the work of all the elites in Sheng Hui Technology.\n Over the past two years, the company\u2019s research and development personnel and leaders had repeatedly tested its capabilities countless times. After confirming that there were no problems, the company finally chose to officially make it available on April Fool\u2019s Day.\n Sheng Hui Technology had already collaborated with many gaming companies around the world. They had installed many of their best-selling games into the gaming cabins. As long as they had this cabin, the players would be able to dominate the game as if they were in a game.\n Today was the official launch day of the game cabin. Han Zhan was going to attend the product launch, and together with Li Li and Bei Zhan, he was going to show everyone how to use the cabin.\n After alighting from the plane, Song Ci and Long Yu boarded the car. She told Long Yu, \u201cTake me to the Imperial Dragon Building.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Madam.\u201d\n The press conference for the holographic gaming cabin would be broadcast live on the live-streaming platform, so that the netizens could better understand the products.\n Song Ci opened Zeus Corporation\u2019s official live-streaming platform and saw the technicians excitedly introducing their new products. Meanwhile, Han Zhan and the other two were already lying in the gaming cabin, the big screen enlarging the minute expressions of Han Zhan and the other two. They were playing an online game called \u201cdemonic cultivation\u201d. It was unknown if they had encountered some disgusting and cruel fighting scene, but Li Li kept frowning and looked very uncomfortable.\n Bei Zhan didn\u2019t look any better. He also looked pained.\n Only Han Zhan remained calm and his muscles didn\u2019t move at all.\n Li Li suddenly logged out of the game. He sat up in the game cabin, looking very uncomfortable, as if he was going to vomit.\n A reporter stood up and asked Li Li, \u201cCEO Li, how do you feel now? Is the holographic game\u2019s image too realistic and making you uncomfortable, or is the game cabin connected to your brain and making you feel unwell?\u201d\n Li Li smiled and stared at the reporter. \u201cIn future, when everyone is playing this demonic game, remember to add mosaic to the magical beasts. Really, they are too disgusting.\u201d\n Hearing this, everyone smiled kindly.\n But Li Li\u2019s words indirectly confirmed the authenticity of this game cabin.\n After a long time, Han Zhan finally exited the game cabin. Li Li and Bei Zhan hurriedly asked him, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n Han Zhan replied with two words. \u201cKO.\u201d\n Everyone was laughing again.\n The host had selected five lucky audience members to experience the fun of the gaming cabin. The five of them chose different games. Some chose games that were too bloody and violent and only managed to last for a few minutes. Some chose games that were too exquisite and mesmerizing. As a result, they were stuck in the game and couldn\u2019t bear to return to reality.\n At this moment, Han Zhan picked up the microphone and introduced. \u201cThe game is just a seasoning. You must never lose yourself in the game. In order to prevent internet addicts from developing, we specially set up an identity verification function for the gaming cabin.\u201d\n \u201cMinors under the age of 18 cannot use the game cabin for more than three hours a day. If the time limit is exceeded, all functions of the game cabin will automatically shut down that day and will only be rebooted after 24 hours. Adults above the age of 18 cannot use the cabin for more than five hours each time. If they exceed the time limit, they will be automatically exited and the game cabin will forcibly close.\u201d\n Han Zhan pulled a long face and stared at the camera with a very serious expression, like a school dean. He said earnestly, \u201cAfter all, a minor needs to study and listen to her mother. An adult needs to eat and work hard, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Everyone couldn\u2019t help laughing again.\n At this moment, someone raised his hand and asked, \u201cAccording to CEO Han, the game cabin must be verified. Then, let me ask CEO Han, will the game cabin recognize its owner?\u201d\n \u201cIt does indeed recognize its owner.\u201d As Han Zhan spoke, a product description appeared on the big screen behind him. Han Zhan said, \u201cEvery customer has to leave their identity information when buying a gaming cabin. Our company\u2019s programmer will personally verify each customer\u2019s identity and activate facial recognition functions.\u201d\n \u201cHowever, in consideration of the purchasing power of the players, we have considerately set up three family accounts for the gaming cabin. In other words, after obtaining the approval of the players, the players can authorize the use of the gaming cabin to the other three relatives. Of course, relatives also need to be verified by identity.\u201d\n ...\n \u201cWe have named the first-generation holographic gaming cabin the \u2018Accompanying Generation\u2019. Tonight at 8pm, the Accompanying Generation will officially be launched on Zeus International\u2019s official website. The first batch will be sold for 1,000 copies at 200,000 yuan. The pre-sales models will all be custom-made, with the names of the players and the autographs of our chief engineer. Although 200,000 yuan is expensive, it makes sense.\u201d\n Once the 200,000 yuan report was out, Song Ci saw that the entire screen was filled with people scolding Han Zhan for being a capitalist dog.\n Song Ci chose to block the message. She bought a cruise ship worth 10,000 yuan and posted it on the live-streaming platform.\n [Please save one for the lady boss, xoxo.]\n Li Li was looking at the live comments left by the audience on the live-streaming platform. Seeing a cruise ship drifting past, Li Li stared at the comments below the cruise ship and smiled. He looked up at Han Zhan and said jokingly, \u201cBoss Han, your lady boss asked you to save one for her.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, Han Zhan looked at the camera, a gentle smile suddenly appearing on his grave and stern face. He said, \u201cI am yours. What do you want?\u201d\n On the live-streaming platform, countless people were crazily streaming \u2014\n [Ahhh, CEO Han is abusing single people online!]\n [The CEO smiled devilishly and said: Woman, I am all yours, aren\u2019t you satisfied?]\n [What kind of dog-shit luck did Song Ci have to marry such a rich, handsome, and capable hunk!]\n After hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, the corners of Song Ci\u2019s lips curled up to her ears.\n Unable to reciprocate Han Zhan\u2019s love, Song Ci had no choice but to smash the cruise ship crazily. She smashed ten cruise ships in one go, making herself look very much like a lady boss. Only then did she give up.\n \u2013\n At 8pm, the holographic gaming cabin would officially be launched on Zeus International\u2019s official website. As Han Zhan had said, the first batch of games would only be pre-salesced for 1,000 sets, and the price would be as high as 200,000 yuan.\n This was something that only rich people could afford.\n However, despite the high prices, all the local tycoons managed to buy the products within a minute.\n Li Li looked at the real-time sales figures backstage and confirmed that the products were all sold out in less than a minute. He smiled slightly, crossed his arms, and said to Han Zhan beside him, \u201cBeautifully done. In less than 40 seconds, all the products have been sold out. Tonight\u2019s first pre-sales is the first battle of the holographic gaming cabin.\u201d\n Han Zhan was very satisfied with this result.\n Bei Zhan added. \u201cOur product has been tested thousands of times and personally used by technicians. Its performance is unquestionable. I believe that within a week, we will receive feedback and comments from the gamers. At that time, there will be waves of good reviews. With the adulation of tap water, the second pre-sales will definitely be better.\u201d\n \u201cAccording to this marketing strategy, before the product is officially launched next year, it will definitely become famous worldwide. By then, if we lower the price of the product and put it into the market, it will definitely become very popular.\u201d\n \u201cSheng Hui Technology is about to usher in its true golden age.\u201d\n Li Li nodded in agreement toward Bei Zhan\u2019s thinking.\n \u201cAs for the price...\u201d Li Li consulted Han Zhan.\u201d Mr. Han, how much do you think is the most suitable price? \u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cLet\u2019s discuss this again. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d Before leaving, Han Zhan looked at Bei Zhan and said, \u201cCall the person-in-charge at Sheng Hui\u2019s side and get him to send a gaming cabin to my house. Your lady boss doesn\u2019t have much gaming skills, but she is very interested.\u201d\n Bei Zhan smiled and said to Li Li, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a lady boss, this is a little ancestor.\u201d\n Li Li was reading a message. After reading it, he put away his cell phone and looked up at Bei Zhan. \u201cMy little ancestor wants to eat hotpot tonight. I\u2019 m leaving too.\u201d\n Bei Zhan\u2019s heart turned cold.\n He took out his cell phone and sent a message to his wife who was overseas on a work trip: [They all have wives who dote on them.] These short seven words were concise and comprehensive, fully expressing Bei Zhan\u2019s envy toward other people\u2019s wives and resentment towards his wife.\n Han Qingshen took some time out of her busy schedule to comfort her darling. She said: [Be a good boy. Wait for me to come back and I will bring you to surf. The watch that you took a fancy to has arrived. I have already retrieved it and will give it to you when I return.]\n Bei Zhan sank into a deep depression. [You don\u2019t love me. You just want my body.]\n Han Qing Shen: [Can you be more shameless? Don\u2019t go back on your conscience when you say things.]\n Bei Zhan shut his cell phone angrily. He didn\u2019t work overtime anymore and went home to carry his daughter out for a big meal.\n \u2013\n Han Zhan walked to the basement and saw his lady boss beside his car.\n The lady boss didn\u2019t put on any makeup today. She was bare-faced and wearing a pink, soft, sable fur skirt that barely covered her bum. She was wearing knee-length boots and leaning against the hood of the car. Her style was both seductive and seductive.\n Han Zhan stopped in his tracks and glanced at her from afar before approaching her with a smile. \u201cWhat did you take today? Why are you so slutty?\u201d\n Song Ci looked down and took out a pen from her bag. She held the pen and said to Han Zhan, \u201cCEO Han, I am considered an actress now. Shouldn\u2019t you get an autograph from me?\u201d\n Han Zhan cooperatively reached out his left palm. \u201cCome, Song Star, please give me your autograph.\u201d Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s fingers with her left hand and wrote down the name \u201cSong Ci\u201d with her right hand.\n Han Zhan stared at those two words and suddenly said, \u201cThis artistic signature isn\u2019t cool enough. We need to practice more.\u201d\n Song Ci pouted and kept her pen.\n Han Zhan suddenly got close to Song Ci and pressed her between his chest and the car. Lowering his head, Han Zhan sniffed at Song Ci\u2019s neck and smelled a faint fragrance. Han Zhan said, \u201cBaby Ci, you sprayed perfume.\u201d\n Song Ci admitted graciously. \u201cYes, if I want to meet a boyfriend, of course I have to spray perfume.\u201d\n Han Zhan corrected her. \u201cHubby.\u201d\n \u201cBoyfriend.\u201d\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with her anymore. He dragged Song Ci into the car, turned off the lights, and pressed her down on the car seat.\n It was past 8pm at night and many employees were still working overtime in the building. There were many cars parked in the basement. Han Zhan had his own personal parking space and was still quite a distance away from the employee parking lot.\n ...\n The passenger\u2019s seat was already laid down and Song Ci laid on it, utterly fatigued. She looked at Han Zhan gulping down large mouthfuls of water and suddenly said, \u201cHan Zhan, my menstruation has been delayed for seven days and never came.\u201d\n Han Zhan choked on the water.\n Han Zhan closed the thermos flask and placed it into the cup holder on the armrest. Only then did he lower his head and gazed deeply at Song Ci who was sweating profusely. He asked hoarsely, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cI am sure.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart shuddered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d\n Song Ci was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I was just happy for nothing.\u201d Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s hand and realized that it was slightly cold. \u201cHan Zhan, accompany me to the pharmacy.\u201d\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n As Han Zhan drove, his thin lips were pursed tightly without a word, his expression especially grave.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help touching her own abdomen. Her heart was racing.\n Arriving at the pharmacy, Han Zhan found a parking space and parked the car. He was about to get down from the car with Song Ci, when he turned and saw that she had already fallen asleep.\n Her clothes were slightly messy and her hands were still placed on her abdomen while she was asleep. Han Zhan picked up the suit from the backseat and covered Song Ci with it. He alighted alone and hurried into the pharmacy.\n The pharmacy was about to close and several female employees in white long gowns were mopping the floor. Seeing Han Zhan walk in, the manager smiled and walked toward him. \u201cSir, what medicine do you need?\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at the shelves and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cDo you have a pregnancy test kit?\u201d\n A kind smile spread across the manager\u2019s face. \u201cYes, sir. Over here.\u201d\n Han Zhan followed behind the manager and walked up to the shelves lined with pregnancy sticks. He looked at the different brands of pregnancy sticks and was also confused. \u201cHelp me pick a few. I want them to be accurate.\u201d\n \u201cSir, our products are generally fine.\u201d The manager asked Han Zhan, \u201cSir, how many do you want?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cFive.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The manager chose five pregnancy sticks for Han Zhan, all of which were the most expensive.\n Han Zhan carried a bag of pregnancy test kits back to the car. Song Ci was still sleeping. Han Zhan heard from Li Li that after getting pregnant, Su Beibei was especially drowsy. She slept in the mornings, in the afternoons, and in the evenings.\n Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s palm-sized face. The thought that this woman might be pregnant with his child made his heart race uncontrollably.\n He took another sip of warm water and waited for his emotions to calm down before driving home.\n Downstairs, Han Zhan had no choice but to wake Song Ci up.\n Song Ci sat up and rubbed her eyes. She wanted to get off the car but was stopped by Han Zhan. \u201cCough.\u201d Han Zhan pointed at Song Ci\u2019s legs and said, \u201cYou forgot to wear a skirt.\u201d She was only wearing a pair of thermal underwear.\n Song Ci blushed.\n She hurriedly found her skirt and put it on before alighting from the car.\n After entering the lift, Song Ci realized that she was holding a bag of pregnancy test kits. She complained. \u201cBrother Han, you\u2019ve been cheated. Two is enough.\u201d\n Taking the package from Han Zhan\u2019s hand, Song Ci opened the receipt inside and was amused by the price. \u201cTwo hundred for five pregnancy sticks?\u201d\n Song Ci was convinced.\n Han Zhan instinctively said, \u201cThe pharmacy seller said that this is imported.\u201d\n \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s imported or locally produced, the principle is the same.\u201d Song Ci looked up at Han Zhan\u2019s serious manner, fantasized some images, and couldn\u2019t help mocking Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, in the future, will you have to use imported food, drinks, and clothing for the children?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen. I\u2019ve been drinking locally-produced milk powder since I was young. Look at my intelligence and character\u2014which part of me is worse than that of foreigners?\u201d Han Mulan went to school after giving birth to Han Zhan. Han Zhan had been drinking locally-produced milk powder since he was young. At that time, he had been fair and fat.\n Han Zhan wasn\u2019t superstitious about imported goods. It was just that he didn\u2019t have enough brains tonight, so he listened to whatever others said.\n Returning home, Song Ci took off her high heels. Han Zhan stared at them and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t wear high heels when you\u2019re pregnant, right?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s usually like this, unless the situation is special. Look at those celebrities, don\u2019t they still wear high heels at events? Anyway, it\u2019s never wrong to pay more attention.\u201d Song Ci only wore high heels because she didn\u2019t have flat shoes in her luggage.\n Song Ci\u2019s menstruation period had always been very punctual. This time, her menstruation period was delayed for seven days. There was a high chance that she was really pregnant. Hearing her words, Han Zhan said, \u201cThen don\u2019t wear it in future.\u201d\n \u201cBut I like pretty shoes.\u201d High heels were generally nicer than flat shoes.\n Han Zhan added, \u201cThen I\u2019ll buy you flat shoes with diamonds.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci came out of the shower and saw Han Zhan sitting by the bed, holding a pregnancy test in his hand.\n Song Ci walked over and sat down beside Han Zhan. She asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to study about this?\u201d\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cThe instructions said that it would be best if the test was carried out early in the morning. That would be the most accurate time.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll do it again tomorrow morning.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Perhaps due to his excitement, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t fall asleep at night. He even went downstairs to work out for two hours in the middle of the night. After that, he got tired and took a shower before going to bed.\n When sleeping, Song Ci liked to close all the curtains at the French window. The curtains were very well-concealed and when they were closed, the day was as dark as night. Han Zhan opened his eyes and stared at the dark room, thinking that it was still dark.\n He looked at his cell phone and saw that it was already 8am. Han Zhan instantly sat up.\n He drew the curtains and the blinding sunlight shone on the wooden floor of the master bedroom.\n Han Zhan was slightly shocked. He actually overslept. The strange thing was that his cell phone never rang.\n Thinking that he was already late, he decided not to go to work in the morning. Han Zhan picked up his cell phone and sent his assistant a message to inform him that he wasn\u2019t going to work today.\n Only after putting down his phone did Han Zhan notice that there was a beautiful box on the dresser.\n He remembered that this was Song Ci\u2019s gown collection box. It had the logo of the Li Yao\u2019s clothing brand on it.\n There was a note on the box. Song Ci\u2019s skinny handwriting read:\n [Brother Han, I went to Song Fei\u2019s house and won\u2019t be home for lunch. Remember to open the box. There\u2019s a surprise inside.]\n Han Zhan vaguely guessed the reason why this box appeared on the cupboard by the bed. He took a deep breath and opened the box with both hands.\n Inside the box were five pregnancy sticks neatly placed. On each stick were two purplish-red lines.\n The instructions said that two purplish-red lines represented early pregnancy.\n Han Zhan slammed the box shut.\n Calmly, he went downstairs and calmly entered the kitchen. Calmly, he opened the refrigerator, poured himself a glass of ice water, and he calmly drank the entire glass.\n After that glass of ice water, Han Zhan\u2019s noisy mind finally calmed down.\n He sat on the sofa and didn\u2019t speak for a long time.\n The door to the house was suddenly opened. Han Zhan turned to look and saw that it was the cleaning lady, Auntie Zhang.\n \u201cMr. Han, are you resting at home today?\u201d Upon seeing Han Zhan, Auntie Zhang was slightly reserved and spoke respectfully.\n Han Zhan nodded and suddenly said, \u201cI am going to be a father.\u201d\n He was clearly sharing a joyous occasion, but Han Zhan\u2019s handsome face remained solemn.\n Auntie Zhang was momentarily stunned. She understood what Mr. Han meant and smiled happily.\n Auntie Zhang hurriedly congratulated Han Zhan. \u201cAiyo, Mr. Han, that is such a joyous occasion. Congratulations!\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded solemnly. \u201cMmm, thank you.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang felt that Mr. Han was really a person who didn\u2019t show his emotions and wasn\u2019t easy to get along with. It was still Mrs. Han who was kinder. Auntie Zhang didn\u2019t dare to speak to Han Zhan much and just buried herself in work.\n After tidying up for an hour, Auntie Zhang was prepared to leave.\n At this moment, Han Zhan suddenly stopped her and walked over to Auntie Zhang with a thick red packet. \u201cAuntie Zhang, I am very happy to have a new addition to our family. Please accept this red packet. Thank you for your blessings.\u201d\n This time, Auntie Zhang accepted the red packet without hesitation.\n Holding the red packet, Auntie Zhang said to Han Zhan, \u201cThe child in Madam\u2019s womb must be a healthy, smart, and lively darling. He will come to this happy family safe and sound. In the future, he will also become an outstanding person like Mr. Han.\u201d\n Auntie Zhang\u2019s words were like honey smeared on her lips. Every word she said tickled Han Zhan\u2019s heart.\n Han Zhan nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n After sending Auntie Zhang off, Han Zhan returned to his room and placed the five pregnancy sticks neatly on the dresser. He took a photo of them and sent them to his grandfather via WeChat.\n \u2013\n Han Aoyu sat in the yard, basking in the sun.\n Recently, he had been sleeping less and less at night, but he dozed off more and more during the day. When the weather was good, he would feel drowsy under the sun. The phone beside the table rang a few times. Hearing that it was a WeChat message, Han Aoyu\u2019s eyelids twitched before he opened his eyes.\n He picked up his cell phone and unlocked it with his fingerprint. Opening it, he saw that Han Zhan had sent a photo.\n Han Aoyu calmly picked up the reading glasses from the tea table and slowly put them on. Only then did he open the photo and look closer.\n What is this?\n As an old man in his 80s, how could Han Aoyu recognize a pregnancy test? He shouted into the house. \u201cBuhui, come and see what Zhanzhan sent.\u201d\n hong Buhui was making lunch.\n He cut the shredded melon into thin strips and threw them into a big bowl. He sprinkled a pinch of salt and rubbed the salt and shredded melon strips with his fingers. He planned to make a plate of garlic-flavored shredded melon.\n Hearing Han Aoyu\u2019s shout, Zhong Buhui took off his disposable kitchen gloves and strode out of the kitchen towards the garden. \u201cWhat? Let me take a look.\u201d\n Han Aoyu handed the phone to Zhong Buhui.\n Zhong Buhui glanced down casually and said, \u201cThis thing looks like a child\u2019s temperature detector. Let me zoom in and see.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui zoomed in on the photo and saw that each object had two poles. His expression changed slightly.\n Zhong Buhui looked at the bewildered Old Master, blinked, and said, \u201cThis looks like...\u201d A pregnancy test!\n Afraid that he had made a mistake, Zhong Buhui suddenly stopped mid-sentence.\n Han Aoyu was slightly impatient. He urged Zhong Buhui and asked him, \u201cWhat is it? Finish your sentence!\u201d\n Scared that he would be disappointed for nothing, Zhong Buhui added. \u201cOld Master, don\u2019t be anxious. Wait for me to check my cell phone!\u201d\n Although Zhong Buhui had never used this before, he had heard of it. He had watched a television show where the female lead used this before.\n Zhong Buhui opened Baidu and searched for what the pregnancy test kit looked like.\n The photo that popped up on the browser was exactly the same as the photo in his hand. There were two lines.\n After confirming that he was not mistaken, Zhong Buhui was over the moon. He chuckled and slapped his thigh. That movement scared Han Aoyu.\n \u201cWhy are you so agitated?\u201d Han Aoyu rolled his eyes at Zhong Buhui and lectured him earnestly. \u201cBuhui, you are already at the age of a grandfather, but you are still not mature enough.\u201d\n \u201cOld Master, great news!\u201d Zhong Buhui bent over and handed the phone to Old Master. He pointed at the photo and said with a smile, \u201cOld Master, this is a pregnancy test kit. Look, there are two lines on each stick. She is pregnant! Old Master, quick, call Zhanzhan and ask if Lass Song is pregnant!\u201d\n Han Aoyu widened his eyes. \u201cPregnant?\u201d He was instantly wide awake.\n Han Aoyu stood up and snatched the cell phone from Zhong Buhui\u2019s hand. He put on his reading glasses and looked at the photo again. The more he looked at it, the happier he felt. \u201cThere are two lines here. There\u2019s no mistake!\u201d\n Han Aoyu hurriedly made a video call to Han Zhan.\n After sending the photo, Han Zhan sat on the sofa drinking tea and watching television.\n Hearing the sound of a WeChat video, Han Zhan looked at his watch and thought to himself, \u201cOld Master\u2019s speed is not good. The video is called a few minutes later than I expected.\u201d\n Han Zhan accepted the video call and Han Aoyu\u2019s face appeared on the screen.\n Old Master leaned towards the camera and was about to speak when he heard Han Zhan say, \u201cGrandpa, your video call is a little slow. I thought you would be eager to call after seeing the photo.\u201d\n A rare look of embarrassment appeared on Han Aoyu\u2019s face as he mumbled in a low voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know what are pregnancy test kits...\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Han Aoyu stared at Han Zhan and didn\u2019t see Song Ci, so he said, \u201cSong Ci isn\u2019t at home?\u201d If Song Ci was at home and heard his video call, she would definitely run over and call him Grandpa sweetly.\n ]Han Zhan nodded. \u201cSong Ci went to her elder sister\u2019s house to play.\u201d\n Han Aoyu acknowledged and asked Han Zhan carefully, \u201cZhanzhan, is that lass Song really pregnant?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan stared at his grandfather\u2019s aged face and felt somewhat despondent. The old man\u2019s health was deteriorating day by day. Han Aoyu, who could still farm last year, was rapidly deteriorating this year. He was like an ancient towering tree that lost all its leaves in just one winter and gradually withered.\n \u201cGrandpa, you must take good care of yourself. Live a few more years and grow up with your great-grandson. It will be best if you can watch him continue with his kindergarten studies and get 100 marks in his exams. It doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t get 100 marks\u2014he can just pass.\u201d\n Hearing that, Han Aoyu\u2019s eyes welled up with tears.\n He rubbed his eyes and nodded with a smile. \u201cOf course. I still have to take a few photos with my great-grandson.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, Grandpa, you must keep your word.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, when you are free, bring Song Ci over to stay for a few days. She will start vomiting soon and won\u2019t be able to eat anything then. Bring her over to my place and Grandpa will treat her well.\u201d\n Han Aoyu\u2019s heart ached at the thought that Song Ci, who was so gluttonous, was about to enter hellish mode due to her pregnancy. As a result, he planned to make a few more delicious meals for her before she developed morning sickness.\n Han Zhan suppressed his laughter and nodded.\n After ending the call, Han Zhan got up and left for Yan Jiang\u2019s house.\n It was lunchtime when he arrived at Yan Jiang\u2019s house. Knowing that Song Ci was pregnant, Song Fei specially made chicken soup for her.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t call before coming, so Song Fei didn\u2019t cook his portion.\n Once Han Zhan sat down, Song Fei took out a box of frozen dumplings from the fridge and threw them on the table in front of him. \u201cCook them yourself.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t mind and took the dumplings to the kitchen.\n After the meal, Song Fei and Song Ci started discussing the names and surnames of the children. Song Fei asked Song Ci, \u201cHow many children do you plan to have?\u201d\n ]Song Ci answered without thinking. \u201cTwo.\u201d\n Song Ci and Song Fei had quarreled and grown up together. Although they disliked each other, they still took good care of each other. Having experienced the love between sisters, Song Ci hoped that her own child could also have siblings by his side.\n Song Fei nodded and said, \u201cThen the first child will take Han Zhan\u2019s surname, and the second child will take your surname. The Song Family can\u2019t afford to lose its descendants.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned. \u201cSong Fei, you still care about this? Does our Old Song family have a billion yuan inheritance or a crown?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cCould it be that the Han Family has billions of assets...\u201d Halfway through her sentence, Song Fei thought of Han Zhan\u2019s net worth and suddenly shut her mouth.\u201d Anyway, we can\u2019t afford to lose our family line. \u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cAlright, alright, alright. The second child\u2019s surname is Song.\u201d\n On the way home, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cDo you mind if the child shares my surname?\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Anyway, they are both our children and my surname is also Han like my mother.\u201d Han Zhan took a deep look at Song Ci and said, \u201cAs long as our blood flows in our children, it doesn\u2019t matter whether their surname is Han or Song.\u201d\n \u201cWill Grandpa mind?\u201d\n Han Zhan said something that would cause him to be struck by lightning and said, \u201cBy the time you have a second child, my grandfather won\u2019t be able to control you anymore.\u201d By then, the grass on the old man\u2019s grave would be at least two meters tall.\n Song Ci was speechless.\n \u201cOh yes, my grandfather asked me to bring you back to the villa to stay for a period of time. He said that you will start vomiting soon. Before that happens, he will make delicious food for you every day.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s expression changed slightly. She was against it but couldn\u2019t bear to reject the old man\u2019s kind offer. She nodded in agreement. \u201cThen let\u2019s stay for a period of time. It doesn\u2019t matter if we get fat from eating. Anyway, I will lose weight after puking for a period of time.\u201d\n Song Ci had given up.\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n After returning home, Song Ci went to brush her teeth while Han Zhan tidied up his clothes alone, preparing to bring Song Ci to stay at his grandfather\u2019s house for a short period of time tomorrow.\n Song Ci had yet to unpack her luggage from her trip back yesterday. Han Zhan opened that luggage, took out her clothes, and hung them in the cupboard.\n Only after taking out all his clothes did Han Zhan realize that there was a fan-shaped pale blue shell in the bottom of the box.\n Han Zhan felt that the shell was rather pretty and placed it on the black shelf in the bedroom.\n Song Ci came out of the washroom after brushing her teeth. Her eyes narrowed slightly when she saw that shell.\n \u201cGo and lie down. I will clean up the mess.\u201d Han Zhan kept the clothes that he needed into the luggage, one by one. He totally didn\u2019t notice how conflicted Song Ci looked.\n Song Ci walked up to the shelf and stood on tiptoe to remove the shell. She thought of the mysterious big boss she met in Palermo and felt a sense of uneasiness.\n Han Zhan closed the zipper of his luggage and looked up to see Song Ci hugging that shell in a daze.\n Han Zhan smiled and asked her, \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Did you buy that shell? It looks pretty good.\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan, I have something to tell you.\u201d Song Ci decided to tell Han Zhan about that person\u2019s appearance.\n Han Zhan raised his brows and stood up. He took the shell from Song Ci\u2019s hand and walked to the French window.\n Leaning against the French window, Han Zhan gazed down at Song Ci. \u201cWhat do you want to tell me?\u201d\n Unable to guess what Song Ci was going to say, Han Zhan started to let his imagination run wild.\n Song Ci walked up to Han Zhan, pointed at the shell in his hand, and told him, \u201cThis shell in your hand was forcefully stuffed to me by a man the day I stopped by Palermo.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed slightly.\n Another admirer of Song Ci? Why are there always people trying to steal my thunder?\n Han Zhan narrowed his eyes and asked in a cold voice, \u201cSomeone hit on you? And even gave you this?\u201d Han Zhan tossed the shell and accidentally dropped it to the ground, chipping a corner.\n Han Zhan apologized without any sincerity. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to break the love token your admirer gave you.\u201d His very insincere apology sounded very half-hearted and sour.\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cNo admirer. He\u2019s a lunatic.\u201d\n Gazing at Han Zhan\u2019s face, Song Ci asked probingly, \u201cHan Zhan, do you know Sicilio?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s pupils suddenly constricted into two black dots!\n \u201cWho did you say?\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s voice was cold and stiff.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "211": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-212\n\n Chapter 211: Fox Song Fei  Every minute change in Han Zhan\u2019s expression didn\u2019t escape Song Ci\u2019s notice. \u201cYou really do know him.\u201d They should be quite close too.\n Song Ci picked up the shell on the ground. She held the broken shell and told Han Zhan, \u201cThat man asked me to greet you. He said Sicilio misses you very much.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed again and again.\n Fear, hatred, envy, and fear were all mixed in those gray-blue eyes.\n Not knowing what scared him, Han Zhan suddenly hugged Song Ci. He hugged her tightly in his arms using all his strength, as if he was afraid that Song Ci would disappear the next second.\n \u201cHan Zhan, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d Although she felt slightly uncomfortable being hugged so tightly by Han Zhan that even her shoulder hurt slightly, Song Ci didn\u2019t struggle.\n Han Zhan placed his chin on top of Song Ci\u2019s head. He sighed deeply and said without rhyme or reason, \u201cSong Ci, I will definitely protect you well. Believe me.\u201d\n Song Ci sensed that Han Zhan\u2019s mentality was slightly affected.\n Who exactly is Sicilio? Why is his appearance so frightening to Han Zhan?\n Song Ci\u2019s face was hidden in Han Zhan\u2019s chest. Her voice was like a mosquito buzzing. \u201cBrother Han, who exactly is Sicilio? Why are you afraid of him?\u201d This was the first time Song Ci saw Han Zhan\u2019s tone and expression filled with fear at the mention of a person.\n He is the fearless Han Zhan who could protect her without batting an eyelid when an earthquake hit!\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t answer at first. After a long time, he released Song Ci, held her hand, and sat down by the window. The spring afternoon sunlight was very obedient. It quietly slipped into the master bedroom and gently covered Han Zhan\u2019s body.\n There was a blazing sun on his body, but his eyes were cold.\n Song Ci put down the shell and reached out to touch Han Zhan\u2019s hand. She realized that it was slightly cold. Song Ci used both hands to protect Han Zhan\u2019s hand and told him, \u201cHan Zhan, what are you afraid of? I am here with you.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced at Song Ci in a daze, turned over, pursed his lips, and looked out the window. The golden sun couldn\u2019t melt the coldness in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes.\n Han Zhan finally spoke. \u201cSnakes are actually not scary. Although they are poisonous, they are very thin and small. You can actually smash their heads with a hammer.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s words had no start and end to it, and Song Ci was very confused. She frowned slightly but didn\u2019t interrupt Han Zhan\u2019s muttering.\n \u201cThere is a saying that once bitten, twice shy. You have been hurt by something before and it has left a deep shadow in your heart. In this life, whenever you think of it, you will instinctively feel afraid.\u201d\n \u201cSame goes for if someone instills fear in your mind from a young age, you will never be able to shake off your fear and trepidation towards that person.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes quivered. He lowered his head and sighed softly. \u201cI am the person who was bitten by a snake. To me, Sicilio is that venomous snake.\u201d\n After hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, Song Ci\u2019s heart clenched. She rubbed Han Zhan\u2019s cold hands and asked him, \u201cSicilio, is he someone you knew when you were young? Could he be someone by your father\u2019s side?\u201d\n The fact that Han Zhan mentioned \u2018from a young age\u2019 meant that Sicilio and Han Zhan had known each other since they were young.\n Han Zhan shook his head.\n \u201cThen who exactly is he...\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly broke Song Ci\u2019s conjecture. \u201cSong Ci, Sicilio is Jiang Shiyu and Edward\u2019s child.\u201d\n \u201cWhat!\u201d Song Ci was stunned. She murmured in shock. \u201cMy mother and Edward\u2019s child. Isn\u2019t he my...\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t bring herself to call him elder brother.\n Han Zhan nodded with a cold expression. \u201cYes, he is your half-brother.\u201d He frowned and said, \u201cHe is also my half-brother.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned speechless by this truth.\n How can that person be my elder brother?\n He looked like a lunatic. He was unruly and arrogant, completely different from my mother.\n \u201cSicilio is the child Edward is most proud of. He has the same cold and cruel blood as Edward. From the time I remember, Sicilio has always been a very powerful child. At that time, we were all very afraid of him.\u201d\n Han Zhan still had a deep impression of his childhood.\n It was wrong to say that children had no memories. It could only be said that those memories were not unforgettable enough.\n Han Zhan recalled as he narrated. \u201cSicilio is only a year older than me, but he has been influenced by Edward since he was young. Under his influence, Sicilio has also become like Edward. When I hold the gun with trembling hands, he can kill someone with the gun without batting an eyelid. When we are facing Edward, we don\u2019t dare to look up, but he dares to openly resist him.\u201d\n \u201cIt is said that when Sicilio was 4 years old, Edward asked him to choose someone himself to be the target of his execution during the baptism. But do you know who Sicilio chose?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s tone was unpredictable and Song Ci felt uneasy.\n Song Ci thought about it seriously and asked in surprise, \u201cCould it be that he chose you?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cI am Edward\u2019s child after all. I am not among the offerings.\u201d\n Knowing that Song Ci couldn\u2019t guess the answer, Han Zhan told her frankly, \u201cSicilio chose his nanny.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHow can...\u201d Shouldn\u2019t his nanny be someone very close to Sicilio?\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cLess than three months after giving birth, Jiang Shiyu faked her death and escaped from Edward\u2019s side, leaving behind a three-month-old child to follow him. Sicilio doesn\u2019t like to drink milk powder, so Edward chose a healthy and gentle nanny for him. That nanny is Sicilio\u2019s closest person.\u201d\n After hearing Han Zhan\u2019s description, Song Ci was even more puzzled by Sicilio\u2019s actions. She raised her doubts. \u201cSince the nanny is the closest person to Sicilio, how can he bear to lay his hands on her?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s precisely because he couldn\u2019t bear it, so he had to make a move.\u201d Han Zhan saw that Song Ci still didn\u2019t understand why Sicilio killed the nanny. He sighed. \u201cBaby Ci, you are too kind-hearted. You really can\u2019t understand why Sicilio killed the nanny?\u201d\n Meeting Han Zhan\u2019s dark eyes, a hazy thought surfaced in Song Ci\u2019s mind.\n Her eyes widened bit by bit as she felt that it was unbelievable. Her voice was hoarse. \u201cIf he kills the person closest to him with his own hands, no one will be able to influence and threaten Sicilio. Is Sicilio cutting off his own ties?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n There was a reason why Edward liked Sicilio so much. He had inherited Edward\u2019s viciousness and unscrupulousness.\n \u201cIf I and Aaron are cold people, then Sicilio is the leader of the heartless people.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s expression was very complicated. There was admiration, disgust, and natural fear.\n He used one sentence to describe Sicilio \u2014\n \u201cSicilio was born for darkness.\u201d\n He was born to be Edward\u2019s perfect successor.\n Han Zhan\u2019s description of Sicilio completely overturned Song Ci\u2019s understanding of \u201cpeople.\u201d\n It turned out that there were really people in this world who had been born into the darkness. Morals and laws were useless to them.\n Song Ci suddenly understood why her mother had chosen to abandon her newborn child in order to escape from Edward. It seemed that Edward and Sicilio were the same kind of people\u2014cold and heartless to the core. Jiang Shiyu would either die or go crazy if she stayed with such a person day and night.\n Song Ci felt terrified at the thought of Sicilio.\n \u201cSicilio already knows about my relationship with you. Perhaps he also guessed my relationship with Jiang Shiyu.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s pupils quivered uneasily. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cAm I in danger?\u201d\n Song Ci finally understood why Han Zhan would hug her uneasily after hearing Sicilio\u2019s name and suddenly swear to protect her.\n Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand with a determined gaze. He swore to her. \u201cSong Ci, you will be fine. I will protect you well. You and the child will be safe and sound.\u201d\n Placing his head on Song Ci\u2019s forehead, Han Zhan said, \u201cMoreover, Sicilio doesn\u2019t have any deep hatred for you and me. He isn\u2019t an idiot and won\u2019t attack us rashly. No matter what, I am Han Aoyu\u2019s grandson and the young and outstanding entrepreneur of our country.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly comforted by Han Zhan\u2019s words.\n That made sense. My husband is Zeus Corporation\u2019s boss. We are not nameless people. No matter how arrogant Sicilio was, he had to weigh the pros and cons if he wanted to touch us.\n Successfully calming Song Ci\u2019s emotions, Han Zhan stared at the broken shell beside Song Ci\u2019s leg and slowly narrowed his eyes.\n There was something he didn\u2019t tell Song Ci. Although Sicilio wouldn\u2019t touch her, it didn\u2019t mean that Edward wouldn\u2019t.\n Once Edward discovered that Jiang Shiyu didn\u2019t die back then and had purposely faked her death to escape him, married his most trusted subordinate, and had a pair of outstanding daughters, Han Zhan was most afraid of what the jealous Edward would do.\n Sicilio purposely appeared and got Song Ci to pass that message to Han Zhan. He might not be threatening Han Zhan. It was also possible that he was reminding Han Zhan to be alert and protect Song Ci well, so that that old fogey Edward didn\u2019t discover her.\n Of course, this was very unlikely. After all, Sicilio was not a good person.\n After knowing about Sicilio, Song Ci couldn\u2019t even fall asleep in the afternoon.\n Lying in bed, Song Ci couldn\u2019t help thinking that if Sicilio hadn\u2019t been raised by Edward and instead grew up by his mother\u2019s side, he might have been a completely different person.\n Unable to fall asleep, Song Ci opened WeChat and told Song Fei about Sicilio.\n After knowing about this, Song Fei wasn\u2019t too shocked. She replied: [You guys actually met...]\n Song Ci was suspicious when she saw this reply. From Song Fei\u2019s words, it seemed like she already knew of Sicilio\u2019s existence.\n Song Ci asked Song Fei: [Song Fei, do you know about Sicilio?]\n Song Fei: Is Han Zhan by your side?\n Song Ci glanced at Han Zhan beside her and replied: [One moment.] Song Ci poked Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder. Han Zhan was not sleeping at all and was just resting with his eyes closed.\n Being poked by Song Ci, Han Zhan opened his eyes and looked at her silently.\n Song Ci said, \u201cBrother Han, I am slightly hungry. Can you grill a steak?\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re hungry?\u201d Song Ci had a bowl of chicken soup and half a chicken stew in the afternoon!\n Song Ci stuck out her tongue in embarrassment. \u201cPerhaps our child is too good at eating?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll go make steak for you.\u201d Han Zhan lifted the blanket, put on his jacket, and went downstairs to make steak for Song Ci.\n Only after Han Zhan left did Song Ci send a video call to Song Fei.\n Song Fei was practicing archery at the archery center. Her short hair was casually tied into a knot at the back of her head. As the weather warmed, Song Fei put on her wide David jacket again. She was wearing black tight pants with a quiver tied to her thigh.\n Although she was skinny, when she really drew the bow, there were actually some muscles on her arms.\n It looked like Song Fei had trained well these few months.\n Song Ci asked her, \u201cWhich archery hall?\u201d\n \u201cAK.\u201d\n Song Fei turned and glanced at Song Ci on her cell phone. She said, \u201cLittle fool, watch. This elder sister will perform an arrow piercing your heart!\u201d With that, she drew the bow to the maximum and suddenly released her fingers. The long arrow flicked on the bow, then hit the center of the target with a momentum that pierced through the clouds and rain!\n \u201cBeautiful!\u201d Song Ci clenched her fists in excitement. \u201cGreat job, Song Fei. It has been so many years, but your shooting is still so accurate!\u201d\n Song Fei glanced at Song Ci coldly. \u201cBow to me.\u201d\n Song Ci snorted.\n Song Fei took off her shooting equipment and walked to the resting area with her cell phone. She found an empty area and sat down. Song Fei crossed her legs on the bed and leaned back against the chair. She sat lazily and casually.\n All the men and women in the archery club stole glances at her from afar.\n Song Fei was the archer god of the archery club. Every arrow hit the nail on the head. Even the boss of the archery club had to call her Sister Fei. It was said that this Sister Fei was the virus specialist who had attracted the attention of the entire country recently, Song Fei. Everyone was filled with admiration and curiosity towards her.\n Song Fei just sat there lazily and had the aura of a low-profile big boss. Song Fei told Song Ci, \u201cI indeed know of Sicilio\u2019s existence, but I didn\u2019t expect our lives to intersect with his.\u201d\n After all, Sicilio had always lived in Italy.\n Song Ci had already guessed that Song Fei knew about Sicilio\u2019s existence. Hearing Song Fei admit it, Song Ci still felt unhappy that her biological sister had deceived her. \u201cIf you knew, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n Seeing that the little fool was really angry, Song Fei could only coax her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hide it from you.\u201d\n Song Fei opened the bottle of water and took a sip. She closed her eyes and said in a soft and slow voice, \u201cAbout nine years ago, I accidentally overheard our parents chatting late at night and found out that my mother was once involved with an Italian man and even had a child with him.\u201d\n Song Ci scolded Song Fei in her heart for being so unkind. She knew about this so early but didn\u2019t tell me.\n But Song Ci only dared to scold Song Fei in her heart. After that, Song Ci couldn\u2019t control her curiosity and asked Song Fei humbly, \u201cThen how did you find out Sicilio\u2019s identity?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cI went to check on the backgrounds of those big shots in Sicily. In the end, I found out that Edward had once been involved with a violinist and had a son who was 11 years older than us. My intuition tells me that Edward\u2019s child is our half-brother. To verify my guess, I cracked Edward\u2019s family doctor\u2019s computer and saw Sicilio\u2019s DNA...\u201d\n Song Fei compared her own DNA with Sicilio\u2019s and realized that they were biological siblings.\n But not long after this incident was discovered, Song Fei became comatose in the earthquake. Song Fei thought that they would never be involved with Sicilio in this life. Unexpectedly, this unlucky child Song Ci only went overseas to film a movie and provoked that guy.\n Song Ci was dumbfounded.\n So...\n \u201cSong Fei, are your computer skills very good?\u201d\n Song Fei didn\u2019t answer Song Ci\u2019s question directly. Instead, she said, \u201cSong Ci, go and check on the hacker, Fox. My code name is Fox. I am going to practice archery.\u201d Song Fei hung up the phone and got up to continue practicing.\n I heard that there was a bastard in the police station who coveted my dog Yan. If I didn\u2019t master archery, how could I kill everyone?\n F*ck!\n Even a young police officer dared to snatch my man!\n Song Fei was in a bad mood. She shot through the target, threw it aside, and walked out.\n \u2013\n After Song Fei hung up the video call, Song Ci checked up on Fox skeptically. Many discussion posts and worship posts about the hacker, Fox, appeared on her browser. The earliest post that Song Ci could find started 10 years ago.\n 10 years ago, Song Fei was only 12 years old!\n What a beast!\n They were both twins, but why is Song Fei so smart and I\u2019m so stupid?\n Only after reading a few posts did Song Ci know what position Fox had in the hackers. Song Ci deleted her browsing history, put on her slippers, and went downstairs.\n Han Zhan had just placed the marinated steak in the cast iron pot when he heard Song Ci\u2019s footsteps coming down the stairs. \u201cAre you very hungry? It\u2019ll be done in a few minutes?\u201d\n Song Ci walked into the kitchen, leaned against the cupboard, and asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, do you know Fox?\u201d\n Hearing the code name Fox, Han Zhan\u2019s gaze moved away from the steak in the pot and stopped on Song Ci\u2019s face. Han Zhan looked inquisitively and asked Song Ci, \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s series of reactions made Song Ci realize that Fox might really be very famous.\n Song Ci lied. \u201cA friend of mine who is writing a novel is about to write about a popular Esports competition in the city. The male lead is a top hacker, so he went to understand the rankings of hackers worldwide. He then discovered that a hacker called Fox is very capable.\u201d\n \u201cI saw them discussing that Fox in the group just now. They made it sound like he was a god, so I just wanted to ask you if you know this person.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d\n Han Zhan used a cooking clip to flip the steak over. The freshly fried steak was brownish brown and looked very delicious. Han Zhan threw a piece of rosemary into the pan before answering Song Ci\u2019s question.\n \u201cFox is a very mysterious hacker and also the president of the \u2018Little Poison Alliance\u2019. He is very good at hiding his identity and no one has been able to find out his identity all these years.\u201d\n \u201cAbout 10 years ago, under the leadership of Fox, the Little Poison Alliance broke through many firewalls on the computer and publicized their criminal evidence. Of course, these are all legends. I have never seen them before and don\u2019t know the truth.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Is Song Fei really that awesome?\n However, this was not the end. Han Zhan continued. \u201cNine years ago, Fox dug up the largest underground human trafficking organization in the world and released the information of the website\u2019s founder and all its members on the World Forum. The international police followed the information given by Fox and captured all the members of the organization at the first instance.\u201d\n \u201cThat was Fox\u2019s most famous battle. But after that, Fox suddenly went into hiding.\u201d\n There was a reason why he knew so much about this person, Fox. \u201cAt that time, I was not discharged from the military. I knew the boss of the Information Engineering Department. He was a senior fan of Fox. At that time, he taught us many things about Fox.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, there was a saying in the hacker world\u2014A Fox is comparable to a country\u2019s security. I heard that our National Security Department had always wanted to recruit Fox, but he disappeared and no one could contact him.\u201d\n Realizing that her elder sister had another formidable identity, Song Ci was in a daze. The deeply affected Song Ci said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the toilet.\u201d She hurriedly left the kitchen and turned to enter the toilet on the first floor.\n Song Ci stared at the beautiful and charming girl in the mirror and couldn\u2019t help scolding. \u201cSong Ci, oh Song Ci, you both grew up eating white rice. Why is it that Song Fei\u2019s nutrients are all absorbed into her brain, while you only have breasts and buttocks and no brains?\u201d\n Song Ci was puzzled.\n Knock knock.\n Han Zhan\u2019s voice sounded from outside the washroom. \u201cThe steak is ready. Baby Ci, come and eat quickly.\u201d\n Song Ci picked up her broken glass heart, washed her hands, and went to the dining room. She, who was not hungry, finished off that portion of beef under Han Zhan\u2019s loving gaze of \u2018hungry wife\u2019.\n Han Zhan stared at the clean steak plate and thought to himself, Grandpa is right. Pregnant women are indeed very gluttonous.\n \u2013\n Song Fei, who had left behind countless legends in the underworld, drove her Hummer and parked it at the entrance when it was about to end work.\n She alighted from the car.\n Knight boots, tight jeans, and a loose black sweater with an eye-catching white letter \u201cF\u201d. This outfit made Song Fei look wild and lazy.\n Song Fei sat down on the hood of the Hummer. A few strands of her short hair slipped out of her cap. She narrowed her eyes and stared at the main entrance, waiting for her dog to get off work.\n After the civil servants got off work, they walked out in groups, planning to go home together. The moment they arrived at the entrance of the police station, they saw that beautiful woman sitting on the hood of the Hummer. One look and one could tell that she was not to be trifled with.\n They couldn\u2019t help whispering.\n \u201cWho is this? Someone who dares to sit at the entrance of our police station is quite arrogant.\u201d\n \u201cI think it\u2019s Song Fei, the girlfriend of our forensics doctor, Dr. Yan.\u201d\n \u201cAh, that virus specialist?\u201d\n \u201cHow can she be so young? She looks to be in her twenties and also grew up eating rice like me, but why is she so outstanding?\u201d\n Somehow, they felt that Song Fei was up to no good. Some of the gossipy police officers didn\u2019t go home either. They got into the car, wound down the window, and looked curiously at Song Fei.\n They looked forward to seeing something exciting later.\n Song Fei had candy in her mouth. She chewed them all expressionlessly, as if she was biting the bones of some shameless woman.\n At 5.50pm, Dr. Yan took off his white coat, washed his hands, and walked gracefully towards the main entrance.\n As a former top celebrity, it had already become Yan Jiang\u2019s daily routine to infuse \u201celegance and nobility\u201d into his bones. Even after becoming a forensic doctor, Yan Jiang still had the glow of a former superstar.\n Yan Jiang had just walked into the courtyard, when he saw a beautiful girl waiting for him under the camphor tree.\n This girl was from the Internet Safety Department. Her name was Zhang Jingjing and she was said to be the boss of the Internet Surveillance Bureau. Although she was young, she was very good at computer skills. It was said that she was the daughter of their boss.\n Yan Jiang was flustered at the sight of her and instinctively turned to change the route to get off work.\n The pretty girl saw Yan Jiang and hurried over. She followed behind him and said, \u201cDr. Yan, I heard that your case has been solved. Captain Lin and the rest are going for a meal tonight. Aren\u2019t you going?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n Yan Jiang quickened his pace, wanting to get rid of this sticky candy as soon as possible.\n \u201cDr. Yan, can we take a photo together? I am your fan. I even went to the venue to visit you at your previous fan meet. I even gave you a panda doll. You should have some impression of me, right?\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing was Yan Jiang\u2019s fan and had been his fan for three years. She was also the vice-president of Yan Jiang\u2019s official fan club.\n Yan Jiang stopped in his tracks and looked down at Zhang Jingjing coldly. He told Zhang Jingjing sternly, \u201cCaptain Zhang, thank you for your many years of love, but I have already retired from the entertainment circle. The announcement is still clearly on the headlines of my Weibo.\u201d\n \u201cI am now a forensic doctor and I am a civil servant. I am no longer a celebrity who earns money from fans. Captain Zhang, I have no obligation to take a photo with you or to be entangled with you.\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing\u2019s expression changed slightly as she turned pale.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t soften his stance at all. He maintained his composure and warned Zhang Jingjing. \u201cAlso, I have a fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\n After work, Yan Jiang obediently put on his engagement ring on his left hand. He raised his left hand, showed his ring, and said to Zhang Jingjing, \u201cCaptain Zhang, don\u2019t text me again in the future. My fianc\u00e9e will misunderstand.\u201d\n With that, Yan Jiang turned and left.\n Zhang Jingjing jogged behind him. Seeing that Yan Jiang was getting further and further away, Zhang Jingjing\u2019s temper rose. She couldn\u2019t help but ask him loudly, \u201cYan Jiang, are you really letting us down by leaving the entertainment circle for that woman and abandoning us fans? You really disappoint us fans!\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes suddenly turned cold. He was about to say something when a round of applause sounded from behind.\n \u201cMarvelous! Marvelous!\u201d Yan Jiang was very familiar with this familiar, cold, mocking voice.\n Yan Jiang turned around in surprise and saw Song Fei jump off her Hummer. She walked leisurely to Yan Jiang\u2019s side and glanced at him nonchalantly. \u201cUseless. You don\u2019t even know how to resist when you\u2019re being pestered?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI was about to resist...\u201d\n \u201cTsk.\u201d Song Fei stood in front of Yan Jiang. She turned the brim of her baseball cap to the side of her head and looked up at the arrogant Zhang Jingjing standing on the stairs.\n Song Fei lifted her chin and asked, \u201cYou are Zhang Jingjing?\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing stared at her warily and remained silent. She had already recognized Song Fei and was still rather wary of this talented girl, who had become a member of the Virus Research Institute at such a young age.\n Song Fei sneered. \u201cAre you a fan of our Dr. Yan?\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing nodded confidently and proudly. \u201cYes! I\u2019ve been his fan for three years.\u201d\n Song Fei smiled mockingly. \u201cAre you a fan of his character? Or are you a fan who wants to sleep with his body? I\u2019m sorry, Captain Zhang. Our Dr. Yan doesn\u2019t sleep with fans.\u201d Her words hit the nail on the head, causing Zhang Jingjing to bleed profusely.\n Zhang Jingjing\u2019s face was red with embarrassment. \u201cDon\u2019t slander me. I don\u2019t have such thoughts!\u201d\n \u201cHa...\u201d\n \u201cThree days ago, who was the one who accidentally sent his sexy photo to our Dr. Yan\u2019s cell phone and pretended to send it wrongly to apologize? Who was the one who got drunk last night and asked the bar owner to call our Dr. Yan\u2019s cell phone so that he could fetch you?\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s words stunned those colleagues who had yet to drive away.\n So Zhang Jingjing is seducing Yan Jiang!\n Doesn\u2019t she know that Yan Jiang has a girlfriend?\n Zhang Jingjing was so embarrassed that her face was red. Realizing that everyone was looking at her, Zhang Jingjing just wanted to find a hole to hide in. She was about to cry, when she saw Yan Jiang standing behind Song Fei without any intention of speaking up for her. Zhang Jingjing suddenly felt angry.\n How could he ignore his own fans?\n Zhang Jingjing was also a girl who had been pampered by her family. She was enraged by Song Fei\u2019s public humiliation and spoke without thinking. \u201cSong Fei, I liked him for three years after all. What about you? The moment you woke up, you caused Yan Jiang to quit the industry and even abducted him to a dangerous place like Africa!\u201d\n \u201cDo you think you are so great just because you are a virus expert?\u201d\n \u201cYou are not worthy of Yan Jiang at all!\u201d\n This was a poisonous slander!\n Song Fei was here today to crush the mistress. Hearing this, she pursed her lips, stared at Zhang Jingjing\u2019s face, and suddenly said, \u201cYou are the vice-captain of the Internet Surveillance Bureau?\u201d\n Yes!\u201d She was only 27 years old and was already the vice-captain of the Internet Surveillance Bureau. This was not only because of her father, but also because she was a computer expert.\n Under her supervision, there were fewer cyber crimes in Wangdong City these few years.\n Song Fei sneered. \u201cIs being the vice-captain very awesome?\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing was speechless.\n Song Fei threw a bait at Zhang Jingjing and said, \u201cIn order to prove that I am very outstanding and worthy of your idol, let\u2019s have a competition.\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing frowned.\n Yan Jiang guessed what Song Fei wanted to do. He hurriedly grabbed her arm and told her in a low voice. \u201cAh Fei, don\u2019t be rash. Although this Zhang Jingjing is brainless, she is still quite capable in terms of computer skills.\u201d\n In Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes, Song Fei was just a smart girl, a member of the Virus Research Institute, and Fu Hanshen\u2019s disciple. As for a hacker expert? Yan Jiang didn\u2019t even dare to think in that direction.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Song Fei patted Yan Jiang\u2019s hand. She walked over to Zhang Jingjing and stood two meters away from her.\n Song Fei unwrapped the candy wrapper and said casually, \u201cHow about this? Didn\u2019t a senior management company expose a case of an underage adoptive daughter some time ago? I remember that the culprit in that case seemed to have used the Internet to send illegal businesses and became that young lady\u2019s adoptive father.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s have a competition to see who can find that illegal website hidden in the dark web in the shortest time possible.\u201d\n Hearing this, Zhang Jingjing was overjoyed. She smiled confidently and pretended to remind Song Fei. \u201cSong Fei, I am the vice-captain of the Internet Surveillance Bureau. My computer skills are among the top in our city. Are you sure you want to compete with me?\u201d\n In Zhang Jingjing\u2019s opinion, Song Fei was courting death.\n Song Fei played with the candy with the tip of her tongue and nodded nonchalantly. \u201cYes.\u201d As she spoke, she even took out her cell phone to play.\n Zhang Jingjing started to dig holes for Song Fei. \u201cWhat if you lose?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cIf I lose, I will break up with Yan Jiang and give you a chance to woo him. As for whether you can woo him, that will depend on your capabilities.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n \u201cSong Fei, what do you take me for?!\u201d Yan Jiang was enraged. He grabbed Song Fei\u2019s arm and was about to leave.\n Song Fei cupped Yan Jiang\u2019s face and leaned over to kiss him.\n Yan Jiang... Yan Jiang was very happy to be kissed by his girlfriend in public. All the spikes on his body became docile.\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t give you away.\u201d Song Fei patted Yan Jiang\u2019s chest, pointed at Zhang Jingjing, and said, \u201cBut if you lose, you will immediately resign from your position as the vice-captain of the Internet Surveillance Bureau! And promise never to appear in front of Yan Jiang and me again.\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing agreed without hesitation. \u201cAlright! Deal!\u201d\n ong Fei tossed her cell phone aside and smiled mockingly. \u201cThere\u2019s a recording as evidence. Zhang Jingjing, don\u2019t cry if you lose!\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing\u2019s eyes flashed.\n Song Fei\u2019s strategizing expression made Zhang Jingjing suspicious. What makes her so confident? Could it be that Song Fei also has computer skills?\n I don\u2019t believe it!\n This was real life, not a novel! Song Fei was already a member of the Virus Research Institute. How could she be a hacker expert?\n Does she really think that this is a drama?\n Thinking of this, Zhang Jingjing was filled with confidence again. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s compete. I won\u2019t lose.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll see...\u201d\n \u2013\n It was already dark. Wangdong City Public Security Bureau\u2019s Internet Surveillance Bureau\u2019s office was exceptionally lively tonight.\n All the police officers who had not knocked off yet were standing in a circle. In the middle of the circle were two compatible computers with two women sitting side by side in front of them.\n The girl on the left had short hair and a cold, unruly gaze. The woman on the right was wearing a police uniform and looked very arrogant.\n The captain of the Internet Surveillance Bureau team, Luo Wensheng, was holding a second watch. He counted to three, two to one, and pressed the second watch. The moment he pressed the second watch, two pairs of fair hands landed on the black keyboard at the same time. Their fingers danced rapidly on the keyboard, so fast that it was dazzling.\n If this hand speed was used in eSports, it would definitely crush all players.\n Song Fei used the shortest time possible to write a programming code and threw it into the sea of networks. This programming was very cunning and smart. It would track down any clues and help Song Fei catch the guilty head hidden under the iceberg.\n Yan Jiang stood behind Song Fei and stared at the flashing computer screen in a daze.\n Why is Ah Fei proficient in computer technology?\n She clearly didn\u2019t learn it...\n Luo Wensheng stood beside Yan Jiang. He stared at his subordinate for a while, before shifting his gaze to Song Fei. Staring at Song Fei\u2019s dancing hands on the keyboard, Luo Wensheng raised his brows in surprise.\n Perhaps outsiders might not be able to tell, but as an expert, Luo Wensheng could easily tell that Song Fei\u2019s hand speed was slightly faster than Zhang Jingjing\u2019s! Moreover, why did the tracking program she wrote look so much like...\n Thinking of a long-lost guru, Luo Wensheng\u2019s expression changed.\n She had actually succeeded in coding Fox\u2019s \u201cVanishing Step\u201d!\n That year, Fox had used the tracking programming of the Shadowstep to capture the largest underground network in the world. He had also successfully broken through the other party\u2019s firewall and leaked the website\u2019s founder and member information, allowing the international police to capture the criminal in one fell swoop!\n Who is this girl?\n What is her relationship with Fox?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "212": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-213\n\n Chapter 212: Don\u2019t Blame the Mistress for Having Bad Intentions, Just Blame Yan Jiang for Being Too Handsome  As the former fan of God Fox, Luo Wensheng would never mistake his Vanishing Step.\n Could Song Fei be Fox\u2019s disciple?\n Luo Wensheng was very agitated. He couldn\u2019t wait to ask Song Fei for the truth.\n But it was time for the competition and he couldn\u2019t disturb Song Fei\u2019s performance. Luo Wensheng crossed his arms and pinched his muscles with his fingernails. He used the pain to keep himself calm and warned himself not to be rash.\n There were countless criminals hiding under the dark web. Zhang Jingjing spent nearly 10 minutes to find the website address of that foster website, but she actually couldn\u2019t break through the firewall set up by the other party\u2019s hackers.\n Gradually, sweat broke out on Zhang Jingjing\u2019s forehead. She secretly glanced at Song Fei beside her and saw that she was still eating her candy leisurely. That calm and carefree aura made Zhang Jingjing feel uneasy.\n Is Song Fei pretending? Or is she really confident?\n Actually, two months ago, Luo Wensheng had already tracked down this website, but he was inferior and also couldn\u2019t crack this firewall set up by the other party. Zhang Jingjing thought that if even Captain Luo couldn\u2019t do it, Song Fei probably couldn\u2019t either...\n As this thought surfaced in her mind, Zhang Jingjing heard Song Fei say nonchalantly, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Zhang Jingjing looked over in shock and saw that Song Fei had successfully broken through the other party\u2019s firewall and knocked down a red fire fox on her computer. That fire fox was still shaking its butt at the other party\u2019s hacker. It looked especially annoying.\n A terrifying glint flashed across Luo Wensheng\u2019s eyes when he saw this fire fox. He suddenly grabbed the back of the chair behind Zhang Jingjing! Staring intently at that fire fox, Luo Wensheng murmured softly, \u201cFox...\u201d\n Yan Jiang heard this word clearly and felt slightly lost.\n Fox?\n Fox [1. He repeated in Chinese]?\n Who is that?\n Yan Jiang stared at Song Fei, who was sitting cross-legged on the chair with a calm expression. A bold guess gradually formed in his mind. Could... Ah Fei be Fox?\n Song Fei pushed away her keyboard and stood up.\n Glancing at Luo Wensheng mildly, Song Fei told him, \u201cCaptain Luo, that person\u2019s IP address shows that he\u2019s near Construction Bank in Feng City\u2019s Qufu Avenue. Do you want to inform the police in Feng City to arrest him?\u201d\n Luo Wensheng stared at Song Fei with a fanatical gaze. He couldn\u2019t conceal his excitement as he said, \u201cSong Fei, don\u2019t leave yet! Wait for me to come back after I finish my call. I have something to tell you!\u201d Luo Wensheng turned to make the call, his footsteps hurried, as if he was afraid that if he delayed any longer, Song Fei would leave.\n Song Fei pursed her lips and looked down at Zhang Jingjing, who was sitting in front of the computer in a daze.\n \u201cMiss Zhang, a person should keep her word. Please resign immediately and promise never to appear in front of Yan Jiang again.\u201d Song Fei held her cell phone with a truly arrogant and disdainful expression. \u201cYou can do everything yet you messed with my man.\u201d\n Don\u2019t you know that men and cars can\u2019t be lent?\n Hearing this, Zhang Jingjing\u2019s face was as pale as death as she sat unmoving on the chair. Yan Jiang\u2019s heart was thumping wildly from Song Fei\u2019s words of \u201cmy man\u201d.\n All the uniformed police officers watched this scene in a daze. They were all puzzled.\n How did Captain Zhang lose to Song Fei?\n \u2013\n After ending the call, Luo Wensheng hurried back to the competition hall. He opened the door and invited his colleagues out. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. Your family and children are still waiting for you to go home!\u201d\n Luo Wensheng was commanding them to leave, so his colleagues, who were watching the commotion, left reluctantly.\n Only Luo Wensheng, Song Fei, and the defeated Zhang Jingjing were left in the main hall.\n Only when Zhang Jingjing and the rest had all left did she stand up. She first glanced at Song Fei indignantly, and saw that her expression was cold and she had no intention of showing mercy to her. Even the most arrogant woman was on the verge of tears now.\n \u201cCaptain Luo.\u201d Zhang Jingjing clasped her hands in front of her abdomen and scratched her fingers uneasily.\n She bit her lips, her beautiful face filled with indignance and grievance, her eyes filled with a layer of hazy tears. \u201cCaptain Luo, I will hand over my resignation letter to you tomorrow morning. Please approve it.\u201d\n With that, tears streamed down Zhang Jingjing\u2019s face.\n Luo Wensheng was stunned. He had nearly forgotten that Zhang Jingjing had made a bet with Song Fei before the competition. Luo Wensheng instinctively looked at Song Fei, wanting to plead on behalf of Zhang Jingjing. \u201cMiss Song Fei, look...\u201d He had just opened his mouth when Song Fei interrupted him.\n Song Fei showed Luo Wensheng her palm and rejected him domineeringly. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for negotiation. Since you dote on your subordinates so much, Captain Luo, why don\u2019t you resign and give the position of Senior Captain to Zhang Jingjing?\u201d\n \u201cIf Captain Luo is willing to do it, I am also willing to give in.\u201d\n Song Fei was so domineering that she didn\u2019t even take soft or hard approaches. This made Luo Wensheng very troubled.\n After confirming that Song Fei wouldn\u2019t let her off, Zhang Jingjing turned to look at Yan Jiang eagerly. Although she didn\u2019t beg Yan Jiang to put in a good word for her, her resentful and pitiful eyes spoke more than a thousand words.\n Yan Jiang was determined to side with Song Fei. \u201cMiss Zhang, you must admit defeat. You are already an adult and should be able to afford to lose.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s words shattered all of Zhang Jingjing\u2019s hopes for him.\n Zhang Jingjing clenched her fists and said hoarsely to Luo Wensheng, \u201cGoodbye, Captain Luo. I will come and see you tomorrow morning with my resignation letter.\u201d With that, Zhang Jingjing picked up her bag and ran off while wiping her tears.\n Luo Wensheng stared at Zhang Jingjing\u2019s back for a while, before turning back worriedly. He patted Yan Jiang\u2019s shoulder and said sheepishly, \u201cZhang Jingjing\u2019s father is Boss Zhang.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? I have tens of millions of fans on Weibo. If he dares to threaten me, I will dare to threaten him.\u201d Yan Jiang was used to being arrogant. Many years ago, he could already do something like beating up a big boss. How could he be afraid of Zhang Jingjing\u2019s father?\n Luo Wensheng admired Yan Jiang\u2019s ruthlessness, but right now, Song Fei was the person that Luo Wensheng cared about the most. Luo Wensheng suddenly pulled Yan Jiang aside and squeezed himself between him and Song Fei.\n Luo Wensheng lowered his head and looked at Song Fei with sparkling eyes. He lowered his voice and asked Song Fei mysteriously, \u201cMiss Song Fei, do you know Fox?\u201d\n Hearing Fox\u2019s name again, Yan Jiang pricked up his ears.\n Song Fei nodded. \u201cShe is my teacher.\u201d\n \u201cIndeed, a great teacher produces a great disciple!\u201d This was the first time Luo Wensheng was so close to his idol. He was very agitated and asked obsequiously, \u201cHow is your mentor? Ever since he retired eight years ago, he has never appeared again. We all miss him very much.\u201d\n In everyone\u2019s eyes, Fox had always been a man.\n A powerful hacker should be a man! This was the consensus of almost everyone.\n Song Fei blinked and lied without hesitation. \u201cMy mentor is already dead.\u201d\n \u201cAh?\u201d Luo Wensheng was thunderstruck. \u201cHow could...\u201d\n \u201cMy mentor is not in good health. In the past, he got into a car accident. Although he managed to save his life, various organs in his body also suffered from problems. He passed away two years ago.\u201d As she spoke, Song Fei\u2019s face was filled with sincere sorrow.\n Luo Wensheng didn\u2019t doubt Song Fei\u2019s words at all. He was filled with emotion. \u201cF God is my belief. When I was still studying, F God was already a legendary existence. Wanting to meet F God has always been my obsession. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t meet him anymore.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cIt has been so many years. It\u2019s very nice that you still remember Mentor, Captain Luo.\u201d\n Although he couldn\u2019t meet F God, meeting his disciple made up for Luo Wensheng\u2019s regret.\n Song Fei was a talent. At the thought of such a talent being hidden by Yan Jiang at home, Luo Wensheng felt that it was a waste of God\u2019s gift. He asked Song Fei shamelessly, \u201cMiss Song Fei, you haven\u2019t been working at the research institute recently, right?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well, so I can\u2019t rush around. I won\u2019t be working this year.\u201d\n Hearing this, Luo Wensheng hurriedly offered an olive branch to Song Fei. He said eagerly, \u201cOur monitoring team is short of people now. Look, one will leave tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cMiss Song Fei, if you are willing, you can come to our supervisory team to work. Our benefits here are good\u2014insurance, money, and even weekends off! You don\u2019t need to do any hard work. Just sit down and surf the Internet.\u201d\n Song Fei felt like she had entered a pyramid scheme.\n \u201cThe salary is too low for me.\u201d Song Fei rejected him very straightforwardly.\n Thinking that Yan Jiang was still working at the police station, Song Fei didn\u2019t want to offend his colleagues so she said reluctantly, \u201cI can spare two days a week to give you technical guidance.\u201d\n As a student of Fox, Song Fei had the right to say such things.\n Luo Wensheng felt like he was sitting on a roller coaster, his mood fluctuating wildly. Luo Wensheng was very satisfied that Song Fei was willing to come and give technical guidance to their Internet Surveillance Bureau. \u201cThat\u2019s good! Miss Song Fei, we won\u2019t let you come for nothing. How about this, we will pay you per day!\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n That was settled.\n It was already past 9pm by the time Song Fei and Yan Jiang walked out of the Public Security Bureau building side by side. The two of them didn\u2019t speak as they arrived beside the Hummer.\n After boarding the car, Yan Jiang consciously sat in the passenger seat and fastened his seatbelt.\n Song Fei driving was the same as her personality\u2014unruly and wild. Yan Jiang had already developed the habit of wearing a seatbelt the first thing he did after boarding the car.\n Song Fei lowered her head and started the car. She suddenly heard Yan Jiang say, \u201cDon\u2019t say things like cursing yourself to death in the future.\u201d Luo Wensheng might believe Song Fei\u2019s ridiculous words, but Yan Jiang didn\u2019t.\n Song Fei was still unconscious two years ago. Where would this hacker mentor come from?\n Song Fei moved the car out of the parking lot and drove into the traffic on the road. She controlled the steering wheel and suddenly told Yan Jiang, \u201cAh Jiang, I am Fox.\u201d\n After the initial shock, Yan Jiang had already calmed down and could accept this fact calmly. Hearing Song Fei\u2019s confession, Yan Jiang nodded mildly. \u201cI already guessed it.\u201d\n Song Fei found Yan Jiang\u2019s reaction to be dull and not at all shocked. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not strange for anything to happen to you.\u201d Yan Jiang started to brag about Song Fei. \u201cYou have been smart since you were young and are a genius. If you tell me one day that you know how to nourish the heavens, I will also believe that you are Nuwa reincarnation.\u201d\n Song Fei was speechless.\n She freed up a hand and touched Yan Jiang\u2019s cheek. She thought of something and suddenly used some strength to slap Yan Jiang\u2019s cheek.\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n He turned his head in shock and questioned Song Fei indignantly, \u201cWhy did you hit me!\u201d\n Song Fei glanced at Yan Jiang\u2019s outfit today and pouted. \u201cWhy are you dressed so nicely at work? You look like a peacock. No wonder you\u2019re being coveted by your mistress. Can\u2019t you control yourself when you know you\u2019re very charming? Can\u2019t you keep a low profile?\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t blame the mistress for being evil. She could only blame Yan Jiang for being too handsome.\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n He looked down at his own clothes.\n Having been an artist for so many years, Yan Jiang\u2019s fashion sense was naturally top-notch. Even if he had to put on the forensic doctor\u2019s white coat every day at work, he had to wear it exquisitely and stylishly.\n For example, today, Yan Jiang was wearing a warm white turtleneck sweater paired with a light blue Chanel jacket. It had been a few months since he came back from Africa and Yan Jiang\u2019s hair had grown longer again. A few days ago, he had dyed his hair a light brown. With this dressing, he exuded the aura of a top celebrity.\n Yan Jiang actually smiled after being scolded by Song Fei.\n Song Fei frowned in confusion and asked him fiercely, \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d\n Yan Jiang placed his fist on his lips to block the corners of his lips that were about to curl up uncontrollably. When he stopped smiling, Yan Jiang said, \u201cSong Fei, you look so adorable when you\u2019re jealous.\u201d\n \u201cShut up!\u201d\n Song Fei pulled down the brim of her hat to cover her reddened ears.\n Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\n \u2013\n Considering that her grandfather\u2019s health was deteriorating, Song Ci decided to return to the villa for a long period of time. Han Zhan packed his things and drove back to the villa with Song Ci.\n At the entrance of the Cheng Family residence, Song Ci noticed that there were many luxury cars parked at the main entrance of the Cheng Family residence. She saw several familiar faces\u2014they were all distant relatives of the Cheng Family. Song Ci had seen them a few times in her previous life.\n Typically, only during major events or important holidays would these distant relatives come.\n With so many people and cars, Han Zhan slowed down slightly. Those distant relatives of the Cheng Family heard the sound of wheels and turned to look at Han Zhan\u2019s car. Seeing that it was a Volvo, they retracted their gazes.\n Han Zhan looked at the outline of the Cheng Family residence in the rearview mirror and was slightly puzzled. \u201cWhat happened to the Cheng Family?\u201d\n Song Ci touched her wedding ring and said calmly, \u201cI heard that Old Madam Cheng is dying. It will probably happen in the next two days.\u201d\n \u201cSo sudden?\u201d\n Old Madam Cheng was a year younger than Han Aoyu. Last year, the Cheng Family even held a birthday party for Old Madam Cheng. At that time, Old Madam Cheng\u2019s health was not good. She survived the winter, but collapsed in spring when everything was recovering.\n Thinking of Han Aoyu, Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cHan Zhan, before giving birth, let\u2019s stay at your grandfather\u2019s house for a long time.\u201d\n Han Zhan glanced sideways at Song Ci. This is Song Ci. She is not as smart and cunning as Song Fei, but she also had her cuteness.\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n Han Aoyu was overjoyed to know that Song Ci would always stay here during her pregnancy. He said, \u201cIf not for the fact that Song Ci is pregnant, I really want to renovate the house and decorate it like how you youngsters like it.\u201d\n \u201cForget it, Grandpa. It\u2019s quite good like this.\u201d Song Ci saw that Han Aoyu kept staring at her tummy, looking like he wanted to reach out and touch it but was also embarrassed. She smiled knowingly, reached out to hold Han Aoyu\u2019s hand, and gently placed it on her tummy.\n Han Aoyu was stunned.\n Placing his palm on Song Ci\u2019s flat tummy, Han Aoyu\u2019s heart melted at the thought that this tummy would give birth to a little life and he would cry loudly soon.\n \u201cLittle great-grandson, I am your great-grandfather!\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help laughing. She imitated the baby\u2019s tone and said to Han Aoyu, \u201cGreat Grandfather, how are you? I am Ban Ban.\u201d\n Han Aoyu chuckled. He pulled Song Ci to sit down and hinted at Han Zhan to pour tea for himself. Han Zhan poured tea for his grandfather and heard him suddenly say, \u201cI wonder if the child in Song Ci\u2019s stomach is a boy or a girl.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan hurriedly shot Song Ci a comforting look.\n Pregnant mothers hated hearing others discuss the gender of their children.\n Song Ci shook her head and smiled at him, indicating that she didn\u2019t mind.\n Only then did Han Zhan tell Han Aoyu sternly, \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t say such things in the future. I like both boys and girls.\u201d Han Zhan thought that Grandpa favored boys over girls and wanted Song Ci to have a boy.\n Knowing that Han Zhan had misunderstood him, Han Aoyu lifted his leg and stomped on Han Zhan. He scolded angrily, \u201cGet lost! Which ear of yours heard me despising girls?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201c...Your words sounded ambiguous.\u201d\n Han Aoyu chuckled. \u201cI am thinking of a name for my future great-grandson. How can I favor boys over girls? Your mother even climbed over my head to behave atrociously when she was young!\u201d\n Only then did Han Zhan remain silent.\n Instead, Song Ci smiled and asked Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, what nice name do you have? You can tell me.\u201d Song Ci respected Han Aoyu more. It was also an honor for Grandpa to give his child a name.\n Han Aoyu thought for a moment and said, \u201cI have high hopes for this child. I want to give him the word \u2018Yu\u2019 in my name. If it\u2019s a boy, how about Lingyu? Han Lingyu!\u201d\n Han Aoyu named the child in Song Ci\u2019s womb Han Lingyu because he hoped that the child would surpass him in the future.\n Song Ci said hesitantly, \u201cThis name is too big.\u201d\n \u201cJust give him another cheap nickname. Dog Egg, Iron Egg, Stewed Egg, Stupid Egg, Lion...\u201d Han Aoyu listed out more than 10 cheap names in one go.\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Han Zhan asked, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a girl?\u201d\n Han Aoyu pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cIf she\u2019s a girl, call her Han Jingyu.\u201d Han Aoyu tilted his head to look at Song Ci and asked her, \u201cSong Ci, what do you think? If you don\u2019t like it, just name the baby according to what you like.\u201d He was rather open-minded.\n After thinking for a moment, Song Ci said, \u201cI like the name Han Jingyu. As for Han Lingyu...\u201d Song Ci deliberated and said,\u201d I still think this name is too big. How about this? If he is a boy, we will name him Han Zhen. When he is at his youth, we will give him the name \u2018Lingyu\u2019. Grandpa, what do you think? \u201d\n Han Aoyu nodded in approval. \u201cHan Zhen is not bad. Let\u2019s do as you say.\u201d\n Since giving a secondary name was mentioned, Song Ci suddenly looked at Han Zhan. Han Zhan\u2019s grandmother was a well-educated scholar. When Han Zhan was 20 years old and in his prime, his grandmother might have also given him a secondary name.\n Song Ci asked Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, what is Brother Han\u2019s secondary name?\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s question, Han Zhan suddenly got up and left.\n Song Ci looked at Han Zhan\u2019s back view as he hurried upstairs. She was feeling puzzled when she heard Han Aoyu say, \u201cHan Zhan\u2019s secondary name is Zhenhua.\u201d\n Zhenhua?\n Song Ci was stunned as the name Lu Zhenhua subconsciously popped into her mind. In \u201cThe Mists of Love\u201d, the famous Yi Ping\u2019s father, Lu Zhenhua, had nine wives!\n No wonder Han Zhan slipped away so quickly. Hh was embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s a good name.\u201d Although Lu Zhenhua had already become a meme on the Internet, the word \u201cZhenhua\u201d was a wonderful name.\n It was getting late and Han Aoyu had to sleep. Song Ci watched as Han Aoyu returned to his room, before going upstairs to their room. Standing at the door, Song Ci raised her hand and was about to knock when she thought of something and suddenly stopped.\n Song Ci coughed into her hand before slamming the door.\n After Han Zhan finished showering, he walked out of the bathroom while drying his hair. He heard Song Ci\u2019s sharp voice outside the door, imitating Auntie Xue\u2019s scolding tone in the television drama \u201cThe Mists of Love\u201d. She scolded. \u201cHan Zhenhua! You have nine wives. Am I the only one who made you a cuckold?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s brows twitched wildly.\n He knew that Song Ci would never let him off.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "213": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-214\n\n Chapter 213: Old Master is the Most Powerful Boss  Inside the house, Han Zhan remained motionless, his expression unreadable.\n Outside the house, Song Ci was possessed and started improvising. She crossed her arms and mocked him arrogantly. \u201cHan Zhenhua! Open the door! You have the guts to look for a mistress, yet you don\u2019t have the guts to open the door?\u201d\n Han Zhan could only open the door and stare at Song Ci with a dark expression.\n Song Ci was in the midst of her performance, when the door was suddenly pulled open from the inside. A gust of water vapour rushed towards Song Ci. Song Ci shut her mouth and looked up to see Han Zhan, who had just taken a shower and was still dripping with water.\n Staring at the sexy old man in front of her, Song Ci smiled so widely that her eyes turned into crescents. She called out softly in a seductive voice, \u201cZhenhua, let me in.\u201d\n Han Zhenhua grabbed Song Ci\u2019s arm and pulled her into the house. Closing the door, Han Zhan said fiercely, \u201cShut up. You\u2019re not allowed to call me by this name in the future!\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly zipped her mouth. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t call you that anymore.\u201d\n Song Ci, who promised not to call him by his name again, changed Han Zhan\u2019s contact number from Han Sanpang to Han Zhenhua that night.\n Song Ci had been happy for a few days because of this name. She took the opportunity to call Han Zhan Zhenhua in private.\n It was already late at night when Han Zhan returned home from work.\n As the villa was located in a rather remote area, when Han Zhan worked overtime until late at night, the driver had to stay up late too. The road was winding and Song Ci was worried that it would be dangerous on the way home. She couldn\u2019t sleep peacefully without waiting for Han Zhan to come home every night.\n That night, Han Zhan alighted from the car. Seeing that the driver was also tired, he said, \u201cAh Song, stay on the first floor tonight and don\u2019t go back.\u201d Ah Song saw that it was already past midnight. If he drove back now, it would be beyond 1am by the time he reached home.\n Ah Song nodded. \u201cSorry for disturbing Madam and Old Master for the night then.\u201d\n Han Zhan walked in front and Ah Song followed behind. The two of them entered the house one after another. Han Zhan saw that Song Ci was still awake and was worried that she would call him Zhenhua in front of his subordinate. In the end, he saw Song Ci quickly put down her book, cover her mouth, and rush to the toilet.\n Han Zhan was slightly stunned. He understood that Song Ci might be having morning sickness. He threw down his suit jacket and followed Song Ci into the toilet.\n Song Ci closed the door.\n As Han Zhan approached the toilet door, he heard Song Ci vomiting violently inside.\n Han Zhan opened the door and saw Song Ci kneeling by the toilet bowl. After vomiting, her eyes were moist and red. This was the first time Song Ci vomited since she was pregnant and she couldn\u2019t stop.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached slightly for her. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cKind of.\u201d\n \u201cLet me get you a glass of water.\u201d\n Han Zhan poured cold water for Song Ci to rinse her mouth and half a cup of warm lemon water for her. After drinking the lemon water, Song Ci felt slightly better. Worried that she would vomit again, Song Ci hurriedly went upstairs and laid down on the bed.\n Han Zhan quickly washed up. When he came to the bed, Song Ci was already asleep.\n Only then did Han Zhan fall asleep in peace.\n However, yesterday\u2019s morning sickness was just a warning. The next morning, Song Ci started vomiting profusely. How badly did she vomit? She vomited almost every 10 minutes or so. Even if she didn\u2019t eat or drink, she couldn\u2019t help it.\n Han Aoyu thought of a way and prepared some light dishes for her. Song Ci used to love pickled peppers and carrots, so Han Aoyu brewed another jar for her. Song Ci ate two pieces and vomited after a while.\n Han Zhan returned home and saw Song Ci lying sickly on the sofa with a clean dustbin by her feet. Only then did he know that Song Ci had vomited dozens of times today.\n \u201cIs this normal?\u201d It was the first time Han Zhan was a father, and he turned to look at Han Aoyu.\n Han Aoyu thought for a moment and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not normal. When your mother and grandmother were pregnant, they only vomited about 10 times a day at the most. Unlike that Song Lass, who vomited yellow water the moment she did.\u201d\n Han Zhan was worried and specially stayed at home the next morning. He called an old obstetrician over. It was an elegant old lady. It was said that Han Zhan was delivered by this old lady.\n Half an hour after the old lady arrived at the Han Family residence, Song Ci vomited three times. She couldn\u2019t stop vomiting each time.\n Seeing this, the old lady said to Han Aoyu, \u201cLass Song\u2019s condition is called severe pregnancy vomiting. If it doesn\u2019t go well, it will mess up her electrolytes and cause malnutrition. You guys can observe for two days. If she still vomits like this, take her to the hospital to replenish her nutrients and electrolytes.\u201d\n Han Aoyu didn\u2019t understand either. He asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that pregnant women can\u2019t take medicine?\u201d\n \u201cOld Han, don\u2019t worry. This kind of treatment won\u2019t affect the fetus. My granddaughter was also in this condition last year when she got pregnant. She went to the hospital for a few days and recovered very quickly. Didn\u2019t she just give birth to a girl two months ago? The child is very healthy now.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Aoyu was relieved.\n Han Zhan had a charity speech at Shunchen tomorrow. The itinerary that he had already decided on couldn\u2019t be changed. The next day, he stayed at home with Song Ci for half a day. After lunch, Han Zhan boarded a private plane to Shunchen.\n On the plane, Han Zhan asked his assistant, \u201cWhat should I do if the pregnant lady vomits especially violently? Is there any way to reduce her morning sickness?\u201d\n The male assistant, who was still single, was stunned.\n He said awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either. When my mother was pregnant with me, I heard that she ate very well. Oh yes, isn\u2019t CEO Li\u2019s wife pregnant? Mr. Han, you can ask him.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked slightly displeased. \u201cI\u2019ve asked.\u201d Li Li\u2019s Su Beibei was the legendary woman who was as relaxed as laying eggs when she was pregnant. She was truly capable of eating and drinking. She had gained more than 10 pounds, when the fetus was less than six months old.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached especially at the thought that his Baby Ci was losing weight everyday and didn\u2019t have much meat on her face.\n After Han Zhan landed at Shunchen, he had lunch with the organizer. There was a charity speech at 2pm. After the speech, Han Zhan sat below the stage and took out his cell phone. He saw that Li Li had shared a Weibo link with him.\n There was a shocking headline on the link:\n [Top socialite Song Ci is suspected to be pregnant. She went to the hospital alone to protect the baby but nobody saw her husband? It seems like it\u2019s not easy to be a wealthy lady...]\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n His first reaction when he saw this headline was: Song Ci is hospitalized?\n His second reaction was: Bullshit! Reporters loved to spread rumors.\n Han Zhan opened the link and saw that the news reporter was from the New Daily News. He first made a mental note about the other party, before opening the content and reading it seriously.\n It turned out that Song Ci had gone to the hospital for treatment this afternoon. Only Long Yu and Han Aoyu were there with her. The reporters didn\u2019t manage to capture Han Zhan\u2019s figure and started spreading rumors that Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s marriage had changed, and that it was not easy to be a rich lady.\n The big boss on stage was still giving his speech plausibly, while Han Zhan was posting on Weibo with narrowed eyes.\n A few seconds later, Han Han Han Han Zhan posted on Weibo.\n Han Han Han Han Han Zhan V: [A brain is a good thing. Don\u2019t just leave it there and not use it. As a media person, you should have your own justification for your words. Who gave you the privilege to start rumors and create trouble? Suing @ New Daily News.]\n Han Zhan really meant it when he said sue them. Within a few minutes, Zeus Corporation\u2019s official Weibo account posted a screenshot of a document. On the screenshot was Zeus Corporation\u2019s legal department suing the New Daily newspaper for discrediting Han Zhan and his wife, and for damaging their reputation.\n As soon as Han Zhan posted on Weibo, the company immediately released the rights document. This efficiency was astonishing. After Han Zhan saw this document, he was very satisfied with his subordinates from the legal department and decided to increase their salary.\n Ever since Big Boss Han\u2019s identity was exposed, waves of Big Boss Han\u2019s fans appeared on Weibo. Seeing this, all the fans gloated and left comments under Han Zhan\u2019s Weibo:\n First post: [A moment of pleasure in spreading rumors, followed by a crematorium. New Daily News, deserves it!]\n Second post: [My CEO Han is even more capable!]\n Third post: [Congratulations, CEO Han, you\u2019re going to be a father. Shouldn\u2019t you give red packets?]\n Fourth post: [New Daily News: Who am I? Where am I? Why am I being sued?]\n As the other party involved, Song Ci was also looking at the melon on Weibo on her cell phone. After reading it, she just wanted to say that paparazzi were really everywhere. She had just been hospitalized today and the reporters already knew about it. Even a dog\u2019s nose wasn\u2019t so sharp.\n Han Aoyu planned to accompany Song Ci at the hospital and return at night. Seeing that Song Ci was looking at Weibo, Han Aoyu also put on his reading glasses and opened Weibo to look. It had been many days since he last looked at Weibo, as he had recently fallen in love with TikTok.\n Opening his Weibo, Han Aoyu saw his grandson Han Zhan\u2019s post an hour ago.\n The New Daily had already deleted the scandalous Weibo post. Only through screenshots of others did Han Aoyu understand what had happened.\n Old Master was rather angry.\n No, I can\u2019t let others continue misunderstanding him. I have to explain.\n As a result, Old Master turned on his keyboard and wrote word by word: [The unscrupulous media is spreading rumors. My granddaughter-in-law is hospitalized, but there is someone to accompany her. Han Zhan went on a work trip and couldn\u2019t come. I personally sent Song Lass to the hospital and am still accompanying her now. Please remove the word \u201calone\u201d @ New Daily.]\n After posting on Weibo, Old Master still felt that it was not enough to vent his anger. He took a photo of himself glaring at the camera, took a photo of Song Ci, and posted it on Weibo.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know what Grandpa had done behind her back. By the time she scrolled to his Weibo account, it had already exploded.\n That was because someone recognized Han Aoyu after seeing his selfie!\n Due to Han Aoyu tagging the new daily newspaper and admitting that he was Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather, his Weibo post was quickly discovered by others. More and more people commented on it and gradually attracted the attention of some military enthusiasts.\n Those who frequently watched military documentaries were all familiar with Han Aoyu\u2019s face. Although this old man had retired for many years, his iron-blooded legend was everywhere in the martial world!\n After recognizing Han Aoyu, the little guys immediately screamed on Han Aoyu\u2019s Weibo.\n Brother Ye: [Ahhh! Old Master! Is it Old Master Han? Oh my god! I can actually see Old Master Han\u2019s Weibo account in my lifetime. Oh my god, I actually left a message for Old Master Han.]\n The world is big but my heart is the greatest: [Oh my, Old Master, you actually know how to use Weibo?]\n Green vegetable: [Worship! This is the most powerful person!]\n These comments successfully attracted the attention of the crowd. Everyone was asking who Old Master Han was. Those military fans were not willing to explain who Old Master Han was and only asked them to search for Han Aoyu on Baidu.\n The netizens searched for Han Aoyu. After that, their hearts were racing.\n Coke [... This is a real big boss.]\n Yaoyao: [What a good life Song Ci has. Her elder sister is a big boss, husband is a big boss, and grandfather is the most powerful big boss!]\n Synchronized Monarch: [Song Ci is the female protagonist who is being pampered by all!]\n Sophie Maso: [Only someone like Han Zhan can be considered the true son of a general. Looking at Han Zhan, I think of XX. After all, real generals are usually low-key, humble, and cultured people.]\n Han Aoyu\u2019s alias had already been taken off, but he didn\u2019t know about it and he was still playing TikTok, occasionally laughing happily.\n Song Ci thought for a moment and decided not to remind Han Aoyu.\n Forget it, as long as the old man is happy.\n \u2013\n Du Xueyan had been rehearsing in the dance studio recently.\n As her vocal cords were about to undergo surgery, the company decided to hold a farewell concert for her before she was admitted to the hospital. This concert was the last one in Du Xueyan\u2019s singing career.\n Both the company and Du Xueyan valued this concert very much.\n In order to fully display her most perfect and amazing self on stage, Du Xueyan had been practicing her dance in the dance studio these few days. She was hardworking and professional.\n Gu Shengyao suddenly pushed open the door and called out to Du Xueyan. \u201cXueyan, all the costumes for the concert have been sent over. Go and try them on.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Du Xueyan followed Gu Shengyao to the fashion stylist. On the way, Gu Shengyao asked her, \u201cDid you see Weibo today?\u201d\n Du Xueyan had been practicing her dance since she woke up in the morning and didn\u2019t have the time to look at Weibo. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What scandal is it again?\u201d There seemed to be big news on Weibo everyday.\n Gu Shengyao shook his head. \u201cSong Ci is pregnant.\u201d Du Xueyan would find out about this sooner or later, so Gu Shengyao didn\u2019t hide it from her.\n Du Xueyan stopped, acknowledged and continued walking.\n Gu Shengyao\u2019s gaze was very deep. He looked at Du Xueyan and asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n Du Xueyan glanced at Gu Shengyao and suddenly said, \u201cYou purposely told me this to see me lose all hope and give up completely, right?\u201d\n Gu Shengyao nodded calmly. \u201cYes.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was slightly speechless.\n Before pushing open the door to enter the changing room, Du Xueyan suddenly turned around and said to Gu Shengyao, \u201cGu Shengyao, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t mess around. Han Zhan will never turn back. Even if I want to turn back and take the initiative to kiss him shamelessly, he won\u2019t accept me.\u201d\n Han Zhan was the most qualified ex.\n Gu Shengyao was slightly surprised. In this world, there were countless men who coveted Du Xueyan. She was a girl, a siren, a charm that men couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cCan he really reject you? Why don\u2019t I believe it?\u201d\n Du Xueyan suddenly pulled Gu Shengyao into the house.\n Du Xueyan pressed Gu Shengyao against the wall. Du Xueyan stood on tiptoe, leaned her head close to Gu Shengyao\u2019s face, and bit his earlobe.\n Gu Shengyao\u2019s reaction was very obvious and his eyes darkened.\n He was about to reach out to hug Du Xueyan, when she pushed him away heartlessly.\n Du Xueyan took a step back and looked at Gu Shengyao coldly. She said, \u201cLook, you will be infatuated with me, but he won\u2019t. When he looks at me, his eyes are upright and cold, like he\u2019s looking at a rock by the road.\u201d\n Gu Shengyao composed himself and remained silent.\n Du Xueyan turned on the lights in the changing room and turned to try on her clothes. At this moment, Gu Shengyao suddenly said in a hoarse voice, \u201cIf your mother didn\u2019t urgently need money to get a kidney transplant back then, Xueyan, would you still choose to come with me?\u201d\n Du Xueyan stopped in her tracks.\n She didn\u2019t turn back or answer Gu Shengyao\u2019s question directly. Instead, she said evasively, \u201cThere are no ifs.\u201d Those things had already happened and those choices had already been made. There was no need to discuss ifs.\n Du Xueyan reached out to take off a gown from the hanger. She took off her dance uniform in front of Gu Shengyao.\n Du Xueyan had just put on the gown when Gu Shengyao walked over, bent over, and helped her zip up her back.\n When the zipper sounded, Du Xueyan heard Gu Shengyao say from behind, \u201cXueyan, did you know that Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather is Han Aoyu?\u201d\n Du Xueyan asked in a daze, \u201cHan Aoyu? Is his identity very special?\u201d The image of Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather flashed across Du Xueyan\u2019s mind.\n Gu Shengyao explained Han Aoyu\u2019s identity to Du Xueyan.\n Du Xueyan was slightly stunned when she heard it.\n She said nothing.\n Gu Shengyao suddenly hugged her waist, rested his chin on Du Xueyan\u2019s shoulder, and said seductively in her ear, \u201cXueyan, you two have been in love for so many years, but he has never confessed his family background to you. Even when your mother was so ill, he never helped you...\u201d\n \u201cXueyan, his love for you is just so-so.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was trembling all over.\n Han Aoyu...\n She vaguely remembered that Han Zhan had also mentioned Han Aoyu to her before. About nine years ago, Han Zhan\u2019s grandmother had passed away and he had applied for leave from the military to attend his grandmother\u2019s funeral.\n After the funeral, Han Zhan had to rush back to the military. He boarded a plane and hurried to Wangdong City to meet Du Xueyan.\n Upon seeing her, Han Zhan hugged her tightly and said in a choked voice, \u201cXueyan, I don\u2019t have parents. I was raised by my grandfather and grandmother. Now, I don\u2019t even have a grandmother anymore.\u201d\n Du Xueyan remembered that this was her answer to Han Zhan. She said, \u201cHan Zhan, you still have me. I will dote on you.\u201d\n Han Zhan only stayed in Wangdong City for half an hour and was about to take the plane to the southwest. Before leaving, he suddenly said to Du Xueyan, \u201cXueyan, my grandfather is Han Aoyu. He\u2019s quite capable. I\u2019ll bring you to meet him the next time I come back.\u201d\n Bringing Du Xueyan to meet Grandpa was to bring his wife home. At that time, Du Xueyan was also looking forward to it, but she didn\u2019t expect that the next time they met, Han Zhan had broken his fingers.\n Du Xueyan had also seen Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather in the hospital ward.\n His grandfather was sitting on a chair in an ordinary grey shirt and loose pants. His head was lowered and his eyes were bloodshot. Perhaps he had received the news that his grandson was injured and was very anxious. Without even changing his clothes, he took a high-speed train from Shunchen City to Wangdong City.\n When Du Xueyan saw Han Aoyu, he was still wearing a pair of yellow rubber shoes with mud on them.\n Du Xueyan\u2019s mother was diagnosed with uremia in 2008 and had to undergo kidney dialysis regularly. Du Xueyan remembered very clearly that uremia was not considered a major disease at that time. It was not included in medical insurance and was only accepted by the country in 2013.\n After so many years of treating her mother, she had spent all her savings on her.\n In 2012, Du Xueyan\u2019s mother\u2019s health deteriorated and she faced the danger of dying if she didn\u2019t get a kidney transplant.\n A kidney transplant required a lot of money.\n When Du Xueyan saw Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather\u2019s simple peasant outfit in the hospital, her heart turned cold.\n I need money, a huge sum of money!\n I have to be successful and earn more money to make my life better\n Meanwhile, Han Zhan, who had lost his fingers, couldn\u2019t give me everything I needed!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "214": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-215\n\n Chapter 214: Yo, Twins  After three days of hesitation, Du Xueyan finally lowered her head to reality.\n She signed a contract with Gu Shengyao, broke up with Han Zhan, and got a sum of money to have a kidney transplant for her mother. But less than half a year after the kidney transplant, her mother passed away due to a strong organ rejection.\n Recalling those memories, Du Xueyan\u2019s eyes suddenly turned bloodshot.\n She felt aggrieved and indignant.\n She hated fate\u2019s manipulation and Han Zhan\u2019s concealment.\n Beside her ear, Gu Shengyao was still agitating her. \u201cXueyan, if he really loved you, he would have told you everything about his family background. Han Zhan might have indeed loved you, but he has always held back his love for you.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s totally inferior to me!\u201d With that, Gu Shengyao kissed Du Xueyan.\n No one knew that Gu Shengyao was not only Du Xueyan\u2019s manager, but also her only bedmate.\n He wanted his heart, but she only wanted a kidney from him.\n In the changing room, the emotional Du Xueyan grabbed Gu Shengyao\u2019s hair and vented all her hatred and resentment on him.\n Gu Shengyao\u2019s indifferent gaze disappeared and was replaced with ruthlessness.\n He couldn\u2019t wait for Han Zhan to be ruthless to Du Xueyan.\n Only when Han Zhan was ruthless would Du Xueyan know how gentle I am.\n \u2013\n After Song Ci was hospitalized, the doctor didn\u2019t allow her to eat anymore. She relied on nutritional fluids and vitamin B1 to protect her pregnancy everyday. Once Han Zhan arrived at Wangjiang Mountain Airport, he hurried over to the hospital.\n By the time he arrived, Song Ci had already gone to the ultrasound room for a check-up.\n Han Zhan and the other family members sat on the bench and waited patiently. After a few minutes, Song Ci walked out with a report.\n Song Ci had lost a lot of weight in just a few days after her morning sickness started. All the meat she had grown previously was gone.\n Han Zhan felt very upset when he looked at the skinny Song Ci.\n The moment she walked out of the ultrasound room and saw Han Zhan, Song Ci was slightly happy. However, for some reason, her eyes suddenly turned red.\n Han Zhan knew that she had suffered terribly. He walked up and gently held Song Ci\u2019s hand. \u201cBaby Ci, I am back.\u201d\n Song Ci stopped crying and handed the ultrasound scan to Han Zhan with a smile. \u201cLet me show you your child.\u201d\n Han Zhan first held Song Ci\u2019s hand and brought her back to the ward. He let her lie down first, before sitting down on the sofa and opening the report.\n The child had been conceived less than two months ago and there was no place for her in the ultrasound scan.\n After reading the medical report, Han Zhan saw that it said that she was 7 weeks pregnant. He could hear the echo of a pregnancy sac in her uterine cavity, but he didn\u2019t hear any heartbeat.\n Han Zhan frowned and asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I hear any heartbeat?\u201d\n Song Ci told Han Zhan, \u201cThe doctor who performed the checkup for me said that I need to be under observation for a few days. Some pregnancy sacs are delayed, so I might need to wait for a while before I can hear the heartbeat.\u201d\n Only then did Han Zhan relax. \u201cLet\u2019s wait a little longer then.\u201d\n After being hospitalized for four days, Song Ci\u2019s morning sickness was finally not as serious. She went through the discharge procedures and left the hospital. The doctor reminded her to check on the fetal heart a week later.\n Song Ci remembered the doctor\u2019s advice and tried her best to only eat light food when she got home.\n Old Master Han had put in a lot of effort to make some light and nutritious food for Song Ci. He was old and had nothing to do, so it was also a form of enjoyment to be able to take good care of his granddaughter-in-law.\n With Old Master Han by her side, Song Ci also found it very interesting to listen to him talk about how he met and fell in love with her grandmother when he was young, as well as his experiences in the military.\n On the fourth day after Song Ci returned home, Old Madam Cheng passed away.\n Early in the morning, three electronic fireworks woke Song Ci up.\n Song Ci woke up with a start. She opened her eyes and saw Han Zhan standing by the window, staring at the Cheng Family in a daze.\n \u201cOld Madam Cheng passed on?\u201d Song Ci asked.\n Han Zhan acknowledged and turned to retrieve a pair of binoculars from his bookshelf. He handed it to Song Ci. \u201cTake a look.\u201d\n Holding her binoculars, Song Ci saw many people standing at the entrance of the Cheng Family residence. They were all dressed in mourning clothes and had solemn expressions.\n \u201cEh?\u201d Song Ci stared at a black figure in the crowd and said in surprise, \u201cCheng Ziang has returned to the country?\u201d\n Han Zhan was enraged at the mention of Cheng Ziang\u2019s name.\n He snatched the binoculars and saw Cheng Ziang\u2019s face clearly. After not seeing him for a few months, Cheng Ziang\u2019s aura had calmed down a lot. He looked reserved and low-profile, and his face was no longer as arrogant and flamboyant as before.\n It looked like Han Wangwang\u2019s vicious beating had taught him a lesson.\n \u201cI heard that Cheng Yanmo found a good doctor for him. That thing didn\u2019t die as badly as it did in his previous life. It\u2019s a pity.\u201d\n Wangwang Doggy was still not ruthless enough.\n Song Ci retrieved her binoculars and said, \u201cI remember that in my previous life, the person who hit Cheng Ziang was also a woman. I heard that Cheng Ziang took a fancy to a lady with the surname Han in Shunchen City and mistook her for a weakling, so he drugged her and brought her to the hotel. But that lady\u2019s university roommate sensed that something was off and followed him to the hotel. After beating Cheng Ziang up badly, she even took his cell phone.\u201d\n \u201cIt was already the next day when Cheng Ziang was discovered by the hotel staff. As Cheng Ziang missed the best treatment time, he ended up in a terrible state.\u201d\n \u201cAfter that, Cheng Yanmo wanted to seek an explanation from Cheng Ziang, but realized that that girl was actually the precious daughter of a wealthy and powerful family in Shunchen City. As a result, the Cheng Family could only swallow their anger even when Cheng Ziang was beaten up.\u201d\n As she spoke, Song Ci saw Su Huanyan alighting from the car.\n The married Su Huanyan looked slightly different from before. It was a transformation from a young girl to a young married woman.\n Su Huanyan was wearing a black waist-length skirt. The weather was still cool and she was wearing a thin pair of black stockings. The black high heels made her look tall, slender, and elegant.\n Su Huanyan and Cheng Yanmo\u2019s wedding was very grand. Song Ci and Han Zhan had also attended it. At the wedding, Su Huanyan wore an embroidered cheongsam with black hair tied up in a bun, stunning all the guests at the table.\n Su Huanyan and Cheng Yanmo were in a business marriage and had no relationship foundation. After marriage, they treated each other respectfully. Song Ci didn\u2019t understand the meaning of such a life, but everyone had their own choices and she couldn\u2019t dictate others\u2019 lives.\n \u201cI\u2019m done looking.\u201d\n Han Zhan closed the window, took the binoculars from Song Ci\u2019s hand, and asked her, \u201cAre you going to sleep a little more, or are you coming downstairs with me?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping anymore.\u201d\n His grandfather\u2019s house was quite far from the company, so Han Zhan didn\u2019t have time to exercise in the morning. He could only find time in the afternoon to exercise in the company\u2019s gym.\n After having breakfast with his grandfather and Song Ci, Han Zhan went to work.\n When breakfast was over, Han Aoyu told Song Ci, \u201cI have to make a trip to the Cheng Family. That old woman was very close to your grandmother in the past. I\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d\n Song Ci was about to say that she would accompany him when Han Aoyu added. \u201cYou are pregnant. Don\u2019t go to the Cheng Family anymore. Just wait for me at home.\u201d\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n Song Ci read lazily at home for a long time. Old Master Cheng returned home in the afternoon and said, \u201cCheng Yanmo\u2019s wife is pregnant.\u201d\n \u201cAh? Su Huanyan is pregnant?\u201d\n \u201cI think that\u2019s her name.\u201d Old Master sat down, drank a cup of tea, felt slightly warm, and took off his jacket. He said to Song Ci, \u201cDuring the mourning period, that girl suddenly covered her mouth and ran away. Before she reached the toilet, she vomited.\u201d\n \u201cLuckily there was a dustbin. Otherwise...\u201d\n The old man shook his head gloatingly. He stared at Song Ci\u2019s stomach and said, \u201cOur child must be born before the Cheng Family and be their elder brother or elder sister.\u201d\n Song Ci felt that this sentence sounded strangely familiar.\n This sounded very much like Song Fei.\n Three days later, Old Madam Cheng was cremated and buried beside Old Master Cheng\u2019s grave.\n In the afternoon, Song Ci felt rather energized. She changed into comfortable sneakers and went for a walk.\n ]Walking under the osmanthus tree that Han Zhan had climbed previously, Song Ci was slightly tired. She stopped to rest but saw a person standing behind that osmanthus tree.\n Song Ci saw that person\u2019s light blue shirt.\n \u201cWho is there?\u201d Song Ci frowned warily.\n Only then did that person flash out from behind the tree.\n That person was wearing a light blue shirt that was tucked into a long white skirt. The thing that Song Ci saw previously was the bow on the woman\u2019s blouse.\n \u201cMiss Su?\u201d Song Ci only realized that she should change the way she addressed her once she said it. \u201cI should call you Madam Cheng instead.\u201d\n Su Huanyan smiled faintly. \u201cYou are 23 years old this year, right? I am already 25 years old. Call me Huanyan.\u201d\n Song Ci corrected herself. \u201cHuanyan.\u201d\n Noticing that Su Huanyan was wearing a pair of white flats today, Song Ci smiled. \u201cAre you really pregnant?\u201d\n \u201cHow did you know?\u201d Su Huanyan was slightly surprised. \u201cThis matter hasn\u2019t been made public yet.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cMy grandfather said so.\u201d Pointing at the villa in the distance, Song Ci said, \u201cThat is my grandfather\u2019s house. On the morning of the old lady\u2019s death, my grandfather went to your house to pay his respects.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d Su Huanyan also browsed Weibo and saw that Song Ci was pregnant a few days ago. Su Huanyan asked Song Ci, \u201cShall we go for a walk?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n There was a clea river at the foot of the mountain, and the two of them chatted as they walked there.\n There was a large, smooth rock by the river. Song Ci sat down on it and didn\u2019t mind being dirty. Seeing how casual she was, Su Huanyan hesitated slightly, before sitting down on the rock.\n Su Huanyan recalled a novel about Han Zhan and Song Ci that she had read a few days ago. She asked Song Ci, \u201cSong Ci, you graduated from Civil Aviation University, right? I heard that you and CEO Han met at Zeus Airlines\u2019 interview. Were you applying for the pilot position then?\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her nose sheepishly. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know, right? The details of you and CEO Han knowing each other and loving each other have been written as a serialized novel on the forum.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n The person who wrote the novel must be an employee of Zeus Airlines and someone close to Han Zhan. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t know the details of the interview day.\n Su Beibei\u2019s figure suddenly flashed across Song Ci\u2019s mind.\n It\u2019s definitely her!\n Bei Zhan was the interviewer on the day of the interview. He had a very close relationship with Li Li. After relaying those things to Su Beibei through Li Li, she could easily write a piece like \u201cThe Tyrant CEO Falls in Love with Me\u201d!\n \u201cIt seems like the novel is true!\u201d Su Huanyan felt that it was rather magical. She said, \u201cI thought that such domineering CEOs falling in love with beautiful pilots only existed in novels.\u201d\n \u201d You also read novels?\u201d Song Ci was rather surprised. She felt that a gentle and elegant Jiangnan beauty like Su Huanyan should read classic literature.\n Su Huanyan smiled. \u201cDo you know what major I studied in university?\u201d\n Song Ci tilted her head and gave her a confused look.\n Su Huanyan said, \u201cI studied the harp at the Milan Conservatory in Italy. Also, I majored in electronic music. I even performed some electronic dance songs with others.\u201d\n \u201cIn Italy, I was also the kind of girl who would put on curly hair, corduory pants and heavy makeup in a halter top.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. \u201cYou? Wearing corduroy pants?\u201d Song Ci felt that something was off and couldn\u2019t imagine how Su Huanyan looked like then.\n Su Huanyan shook her head and chuckled. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t have rebellious moments?\u201d\n As they were both music enthusiasts, Song Ci had an even better impression of Su Huanyan. \u201cYou studied in Italy?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Thinking of that lunatic Sicilio, Song Ci didn\u2019t have a good impression of Italy. \u201cWhat do you think of Italy?\u201d\n \u201cNot bad, the capital of fashion and romance.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you think of Italian men?\u201d\n Su Huanyan narrowed her eyes as her smile gradually faded. \u201cJust like that.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cMostly crazy.\u201d\n Su Huanyan actually agreed with Song Ci\u2019s evaluation. \u201cYes, super crazy.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s phone suddenly rang.\n Seeing that it was Han Aoyu calling, she said to Su Huanyan, \u201cGrandpa called to rush me. It might be time for us to eat dinner. Shall we go back?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u2013\n The next day, Zhong Buhui drove Song Ci and Han Aoyu to the hospital.\n Song Ci went for a check-up, while Han Aoyu sat in the waiting room and played with those children. He looked at the way these children ran around the room with their little butts up and thought of Han Zhan when he was over a year old.\n Han Zhan was fair and chubby when he was young. His mixed-blood face made him look like a doll. At that time, his grandmother had pushed him out to buy groceries and shop. Whoever saw him would say that this child was so adorable.\n But when they were two years old, they lost Han Zhan.\n When he saw Han Zhan again, his eyes had already lost their innocence and were as cold as still water.\n Han Aoyu thought too far ahead, and he only woke up after Song Ci finished her checkup and called out to him a few times with the report.\n Han Aoyu snapped out of his trance and looked at the report in Song Ci\u2019s hand. He saw that Song Ci\u2019s expression was slightly grave and thought that something had happened to the child. His heart skipped a beat.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Song Lass? Why is your expression so serious?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. Grandpa, let\u2019s go see the doctor first.\u201d\n \u201cOh, okay.\u201d\n Han Aoyu and Song Ci arrived at the doctor\u2019s office. Song Ci handed the medical report to the doctor and said, \u201cDoctor, look at this medical report. What does it mean?\u201d\n The doctor looked down at the report and explained to Song Ci. \u201cYoung lady, look. This is a hormonal sac, a fetus sprout, and two egg sacs. You can see the primitive heartbeat. This means that you have two children in your stomach!\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked.\n Han Aoyu also widened his eyes.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart was beating unbelievably fast. She stared at the report and asked, \u201cAre they twins from the same egg?\u201d\n \u201cYes. Twins from different eggs usually discovered early in the pregnancy, but it\u2019s slightly later for twins from the same egg. In the past, our hospital has also seen several rather special cases of twins from the same egg, but one showed signs of heartbeat and the other didn\u2019t hear it. The doctor and the pregnant mother both thought it was a single-child, but after more than four months of pregnancy, the mother came for an ultrasound and realized it was twins.\u201d\n \u201cCongratulations, you have suddenly gained two children.\u201d\n The doctor\u2019s words stunned Song Ci.\n Han Aoyu slapped his thigh on the spot, so agitated that his face was slightly red. \u201cSong Lass, this is great news!\u201d\n Thinking that he would be able to have two great-grandchildren in another seven months, Han Aoyu suddenly felt that he could live for a few more years.\n \u2013\n Zeus Corporation.\n The advertisement proposal written by Bei Zhan Advertising Company was brought to Han Zhan\u2019s office for him to look at.\n After Han Zhan finished reading the advertising proposal, he brought up what he felt needed improvement and rejected the original proposal, allowing them to continue modifying it.\n Bei Zhan clicked his tongue. \u201cI think this advertisement proposal is not bad. It\u2019s very novel, but this doesn\u2019t even catch your eye. What kind do you want?\u201d\n \u201cYou must be creative. The more creative an advertisement is, the more attractive it is.\u201d\n \u201cThen you should say something creative.\u201d\n Han Zhan sneered. \u201cIf I can think of something creative, why would I need an advertising company?\u201d\n Bei Zhan was speechless.\n That\u2019s right, he should at least leave a way out for the advertising company.\n Ding-Dong.\n \u201cOh, did sister-in-law send you another message?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t reply. He unlocked his cell phone and opened WeChat. He saw Song Ci sending the medical report over. Han Zhan opened the photo and stared at the report for a long time.\n Bei Zhan was slightly shocked to see that Han Zhan remained silent and seemed to be both happy and crazy. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Didn\u2019t sister-in-law go for a prenatal checkup today? Could there be a problem with the results?\u201d\n One embryo and two egg sacs...\n Han Zhan\u2019s heartbeat quickened slightly.\n Is this what it meant?\n At this moment, Song Ci sent another message: [Brother Han, it\u2019s twins!]\n Han Zhan took a deep breath.\n Bei Zhan saw that Han Zhan suddenly put down his cell phone, stood up, loosened his tie roughly, walked up to the French window, and stared at the majestic Great Dragon River outside the building. He didn\u2019t speak and just looked at it.\n Bei Zhan was terrified. He asked carefully, \u201cIs there really a problem with the results of the prenatal checkup?\u201d\n Only then did Han Zhan turn around.\n He placed his hands on his hips and smiled happily. \u201cBei Zhan, I am going to have a pair of children.\u201d\n A pair.\n Bei Zhan was shocked. \u201cSister-in-law is pregnant with twins?\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded vigorously.\n Bei Zhan couldn\u2019t help laughing. He was really happy for Han Zhan. \u201cNot bad, you\u2019re so efficient. Getting twice with one shot!\u201d\n Han Zhan was also slightly proud and self-satisfied.\n After Bei Zhan left, Han Zhan pressed the intercom and called his secretary in.\n The secretary walked in and stood respectfully in front of Han Zhan\u2019s desk. She asked respectfully, \u201cMr. Han, what instructions do you have?\u201d\n \u201cInform the finance department to give each employee a red packet. Inform Assistant Zhang that in the name of my wife and Song Ci, we should quickly establish a foundation to help newborn babies with difficult illnesses.\u201d\n \u201cThe name of the foundation is the Ban Ban Charity Foundation.\u201d\n The secretary memorized Han Zhan\u2019s instructions. Seeing that Han Zhan\u2019s smile was very wide, the secretary asked boldly, \u201cMr. Han, did something joyous happen?\u201d\n There had to be a reason for this sudden giving of red packets.\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t resist boasting. \u201cI am going to be a father.\u201d\n The paparazzi had already exposed Madam\u2019s pregnancy, so the secretary wasn\u2019t surprised.\n But if Mr. Han wanted to show off, she had to support him. \u201cThen I must congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Han. Both of you are so outstanding. Your children must be blessed by the heavens.\u201d\n Han Zhan pointed at the secretary and said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a big red packet. 800 yuan!\u201d\n The secretary thanked him happily and hurriedly returned to her post to write a document. After signing and stamping it for Han Zhan, she brought it to the finance department downstairs.\n That night, all the employees at Zeus International Headquarters received a 200 yuan red packet.\n \u2013\n On the way home, Han Zhan\u2019s lips kept curling up uncontrollably.\n After parking the car properly, Han Zhan alighted and saw his wife standing at the door of the house waiting for him to go home. Han Zhan\u2019s heart warmed.\n \u201cYou\u2019re back early tonight.\u201d Song Ci helped Han Zhan hold his briefcase.\n Han Zhan took off his suit jacket, tie, and unbuttoned two to three buttons of his shirt. He exuded a lazy aura that was charming and sexy without him knowing it.\n Han Zhan pulled Song Ci to the sofa, sat down, and pulled her into his arms.\n Holding Song Ci\u2019s slender waist with his right hand, Han Zhan placed his left hand on her abdomen.\n Under his palm, Song Ci\u2019s abdomen bulged slightly. Thinking of the existence of two little lives inside, Han Zhan\u2019s heart melted.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cLooks like I still have to find time to make another crib.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s palm landed on Han Zhan\u2019s buzz cut and stroked his hard hair from time to time. Song Ci said, \u201cI told Song Fei about the twins today. She was so angry that she hung up on me.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled. \u201cAs her younger sister, you got married and had children before her. You can\u2019t blame her for being angry.\u201d\n \u201cBut after she hung up, she transferred 50,000 yuan through Alipay for me to buy some good food for her nephew and niece.\u201d\n After all, they were biological sisters, so Song Fei was also concerned about Song Ci.\n At the mention of Song Fei, Song Ci recalled what Song Fei had said that day. \u201cPreviously, Song Fei said that one of our children will take your surname and the other will take mine. Now, there are two of them. When the child is born, we\u2019ll definitely not be able to get Grandpa\u2019s approval.\u201d\n \u201cLooks like my Old Song family\u2019s bloodline is going to die.\u201d Song Ci was joking and her voice was laced with laughter.\n Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhat do you think? If you want the child to take your surname, then she will take yours.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t really care. Actually, I want our children to have one surname\u2014 either Han or Song. Forget it, let Song Fei and Yan Jiang\u2019s child inherit the family line.\u201d\n Seeing that Song Ci really didn\u2019t care about this, Han Zhan said, \u201cThen let\u2019s have the surname Han.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cWhen will your stomach show?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious now, but it might bulge next month.\u201d Song Ci touched her own stomach and said disconsolately, \u201cI can only throw away my beautiful dress, my halter top, and my high heels...\u201d\n Han Zhan was amused by Song Ci\u2019s expression.\n \u201cLooks like we have to hurry up and film the commercial. It won\u2019t be easy to film it when your tummy shows.\u201d\n \u201cIs the advertising proposal done up yet?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019ve written a few, but I\u2019m not satisfied.\u201d Han Zhan thought of how Song Ci had many weird ideas and asked her, \u201cDo you have any ideas? You can tell me.\u201d\n Song Ci really did.\n \u201cI saw a perfume commercial some time ago. That commercial was especially interesting. A group of secret supermodels dressed up as angels descending from the sky and chased after a man. In the end, the scene changed. A few angels grabbed the man and leaned close to him, but they used their noses to smell his perfume.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan felt that this advertisement was interesting. \u201cThen what do you think?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cMy thoughts might be slightly immature.\u201d\n \u201cTell me about it.\u201d\n Song Ci excitedly shared her thoughts with Han Zhan, and his eyes lit up.\n He immediately picked up his cell phone and called Bei Zhan to tell him about Song Ci\u2019s idea.\n After hearing this, Bei Zhan was stunned for a few seconds before asking him, \u201cWho thought of this idea? What a genius.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cMy Mrs. Han.\u201d\n Bei Zhan said, \u201c...My sister-in-law is talented.\u201d\n With the advertisement idea, the head of Zeus Airlines\u2019 publicity department quickly found the most famous advertisement director in the country to shoot the advertisement.\n The advertisement was filmed for a week, and the post-production took more than a month. The advertisement was sent to the relevant departments for review for a period of time. By the time the advertisement was officially launched, it was already July.\n On the Chinese Valentine\u2019s Day, Zeus Airlines booked the LED screens of many shopping malls across the country to broadcast their new advertisements at all intervals.\n The sun was not high in the sky and it was slightly chilly. The citizens all walked out of their houses to shop or travel.\n On the LED screen of the tallest financial building on Three Bridges Street, an advertisement was playing. It was a shampoo advertisement shot by Du Xueyan.\n In the advertisement, Du Xueyan had beautiful black hair and was wearing a tight white dress. She looked like a fairy.\n Du Xueyan had just held a farewell concert some time ago. After the concert, she officially announced her temporary departure from the entertainment circle to undergo surgery to recuperate.\n This commercial was the last commercial that Du Xueyan took when she was a singer. In order to help Du Xueyan, her fans all had a bottle of this brand\u2019s shampoo.\n As soon as the shampoo commercial ended, a new commercial was shown.\n Amidst the clouds and mist of the celestial heavens, a little fairy in a yellow dress walked into a plum forest.\n The camera zoomed out and one could vaguely see a woman dressed in red lying on a plum tree sleeping. A cross-shaped red plum covered that woman\u2019s face and lips. One could vaguely see her porcelain-white skin and that curvy nose.\n Under the setting sun, her beautiful black hair hung in the forest of plum blossoms. Her red maple-like dress was like a burning flame. It was passionate and breathtaking.\n Little Xian\u2019e stood under the plum blossom tree and looked at the white wine bottles all over the ground. She looked up at the fairy on the tree and said softly, \u201cWeaving Maid Fairy, you drank again? Today is the Beggar Festival. You\u2019re only able to see Cowherd at this time once every year . It is already late and you have yet to set off. I am afraid I won\u2019t be able to see him this year.\u201d\n In the camera, a pair of curly black lashes quivered gently. Suddenly, those eyes opened. Those hazel eyes were as clear as spring water.\n The camera turned and the woman in the red dress suddenly sat up. Her gorgeous face was magnified in the camera.\n Although it was a close-up shot, the woman\u2019s skin was flawless. Her porcelain-white skin and gorgeous face were truly outstanding.\n \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d the fairy asked.\n Little Xian\u2019e said, \u201cIt\u2019s 5am. Fairy, it\u2019s already late. You won\u2019t be able to make it even if you fly over now.\u201d\n The fairy jumped down from the tree and took out her cell phone, as if she was performing a magic trick. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t panic. Zeus Airlines is the fastest and most stable. It will bring me to every corner of the world!\u201d\n The scene changed and the fairy was already sitting on the plane. She enjoyed the most comfortable and considerate service of the airline, and arrived at the rendezvous point in the shortest time possible.\n The fairy pounced into the arms of a tall, handsome man with gray-blue eyes.\n The camera zoomed out and the scene of the two of them hugging froze into a painting. A sentence appeared on the screen, followed by a deep, magnetic male voice.\n [Zeus Airlines, brings you to my side.]\n ...\n On the Chinese Valentine\u2019s Day, Zeus Airlines\u2019 publicity advertisement blew up!\n All the users on Weibo, Station B, and the internet reposted this advertisement.\n Zeus Airlines had shot the two-minute commercial to the level of a movie. The exquisite and meticulous setting and clothing, the quality of the movie, the extraordinarily beautiful advertising actor, and the voice-over benefits made it difficult for this commercial to not be popular!\n Many netizens commented on this advertisement on Weibo.\n With a beautiful heart: [Ah!!!! I let out a groundhog\u2019s shriek. Who can tell me if the male and female leads of Zeus Airlines\u2019 publicity film are Song Ci and Han Zhan? The lady boss and boss personally endorsed their own company. May I know which other company has such a high standard?]\n Eat Glass: [Oh my god, CEO Han is so handsome! CEO Han, I want to bear your child!]\n All the best duck: [I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t care. Mother, I want to have that little red-dressed lady. CEO Han is not kind. How can he have such a beautiful little fairy for himself?]\n Dazed Dragon: [Taking a deep drag of my cigarette, I tell myself that God is fair. While God gave others astonishing beauty, he also gave them a powerful identity. While God gave me ugly looks, he also gave me poverty that matched my looks.]\n Cabbage Chicken: [Oh my god, so sweet.]\n My Girl: [Let me secretly tell everyone that the last sentence was dubbed by CEO Han. Those babies who watched Wangdong TV Station\u2019s Spring Festival Gala, do you still remember CEO Han\u2019s lovely voice that can make one pregnant?]\n ...\n Thanks to this advertisement, there were obviously more passengers choosing Zeus Airlines during the summer vacation.\n Bei Zhan received a call from his subordinate, and was very pleased to know that the airline\u2019s sales had increased by 10% over the past two days.\n After hanging up, Bei Zhan looked at his sexy wife in a bikini beside him. He said, \u201cThe airline\u2019s new commercial is very good. It has only been aired for two days, but the airline\u2019s sales have increased by a large margin. With the bonus at the end of the year, we can buy a McLaren.\u201d\n Han Qingshen took off her sunglasses and tilted her head to ask him, \u201cYou want a McLaren? What color? I\u2019ll get it for you now.\u201d\n Bei Zhan was speechless.\n \u201cI want to buy it for you,\u201d he said.\n Han Qingshen was slightly stunned. Her domineering eyes were filled with tenderness. \u201cI like black.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll buy you a black one.\u201d\n At the side, the little packrat was wearing a beach hat and shorts as it piled up the beach castle. It suddenly raised the shovel in its hand, looked at Bei Zhan, and said, \u201cHarrow, I want a blue pumpkin car, the kind that looks like Cinderella.\u201d\n Cinderella was Bei Xiaobao\u2019s favorite fairy tale. She especially wanted a pumpkin carriage that Cinderella had sat in.\n Bei Zhan reached out and rubbed his daughter\u2019s head. \u201cAlright, Father will buy you a pumpkin car.\u201d\n Han Qingshen picked up the tablet and searched for Zeus Airlines\u2019 promotional video. After seeing it, Han Qingshen said, \u201cNot talking about anything else, Song Ci\u2019s looks are truly gorgeous.\u201d\n \u201cDo you know her?\u201d Han Qingshen was the CEO of Empire Entertainment, so she might really know Song Ci.\n Han Qingshen nodded.\n \u201cI do. When Song Ci was 17 years old, I took a fancy to her and wanted to sign her into my company. I intend to turn her into a celebrity.\u201d\n Bei Zhan didn\u2019t know about this.\n \u201cThe 17-year-old Song Ci is already a beauty. At that time, she was still very elegant and couldn\u2019t compare to her current flirtatious manner.\u201d Han Qingshen recalled Song Ci and was slightly impressed.\n \u201cThe conditions I set for her at that time were very tempting, but she rejected them very straightforwardly.\u201d\n Bei Zhan asked, \u201cWhy did she refuse?\u201d\n \u201cShe said that she wants to be a female soldier pilot and will protect the country with her combat power in the future. She\u2019s not interested in acting or singing.\u201d\n Han Qingshen frowned in confusion. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why she went to the Civil Aviation Company.\u201d\n Bei Zhan didn\u2019t know the inside story either. When he called Han Zhan that night, he casually told him about this.\n After hearing this, Han Zhan only said calmly that he got it and hung up.\n Han Zhan was on the way home when he received Bei Zhan\u2019s call.\n He turned his cell phone and looked out of the window, his mind in a mess.\n He was thinking if in her previous life, Song Ci had also felt despair and reluctance when she married Cheng Ziang.\n She clearly had a crush on someone in her heart. All because of that crush, she rejected the temptation of the entertainment circles and went to attend an aviation school. In the end, she married a playboy. How sad must she be...\n Han Zhan held his own heart and thought to himself: What right do I, Han Zhan, have to make you like me so much?\n Han Zhan returned home and saw Song Ci\u2019s smiling face. Thinking of all the grievances she had suffered, he couldn\u2019t resist hugging her.\n ong Ci squirmed in his arms and asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Can\u2019t hold it in anymore? Are you going to lose your legs at the sight of me?\u201d\n Ever since they discovered that she was pregnant, the two of them had never been intimate again. Not only Han Zhan, but Song Ci also held it in.\n Han Zhan shook his head and said, \u201cBaby Ci, when you decided to apply to be a pilot, didn\u2019t you think that you might never meet me again in this life?\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you suddenly asking this question?\u201d Song Ci was slightly surprised.\n Han Zhan remained silent and hugged Song Ci tightly.\n Song Ci placed her palm on the back of Han Zhan\u2019s hand. She looked down at the leather glove on Han Zhan\u2019s right hand and said, \u201cHan Zhan, do you know that I didn\u2019t intend to get married in the past?\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI originally wanted to work at Chao Yang Company for the rest of my life and work for my adoptive father for the rest of my life to take care of the vegetable Song Fei.\u201d\n \u201cIf I can\u2019t meet someone I like, I don\u2019t want to go on a blind date either. I also don\u2019t want to spend so much effort to please a stranger.\u201d\n \u201cSo.\u201d Song Ci looked up at Han Zhan\u2019s handsome face that was inches away from her. She said, \u201cThere was nothing I could do when I married Cheng Ziang, but I married you willingly.\u201d\n Initially, when she got close to Han Zhan, Song Ci really wanted to use his identity to seek shelter for herself and Song Fei.\n But she was willing to choose Han Zhan because of her previous life\u2019s experience.\n Song Ci had liked the Han Zhan in her previous life.\n That blind Han Zhan who held a thermos flask wherever he went, spoke gently and patiently.\n Actually, when she first got married to Han Zhan in this life, Song Ci had no love for him.\n he liked the mature and gentle 40-year-old Han Zhan, not the unpredictable 30-year-old Han Zhan.\n But after spending a long time together, Song Ci also discovered Han Zhan\u2019s strengths.\n Be it the mature and gentle Han Zhan in his forties, the paranoid Han Zhan in his thirties, or the hot-blooded young man in his twenties, Song Ci liked Han Zhan at every age.\n Song Ci suddenly tiptoed to ask the corners of Han Zhan\u2019s lips.\n Han Zhan thought that Song Ci just wanted to kiss him, but she turned around and unbuttoned his shirt.\n Han Zhan was shocked, his eyes filled with surprise. \u201cBaby Ci, you are pregnant with a child...\u201d\n Song Ci said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s already been six months. Just be careful.\u201d\n Han Zhan was already slightly agitated. After receiving Song Ci\u2019s approval, it was no longer human to refuse.\n He didn\u2019t dare to make a big fuss and had been very gentle.\n Having tasted some benefits, Han Zhan woke up the next morning feeling refreshed.\n \u2014-\n The corporation had opened up a new aviation travel company. A few months ago, they had already chosen the location of the headquarters in Wangdong City, Wan Yu County.\n Wanyu County was the district with the lowest economic development in Wangdong City. He had set the company\u2019s address here for many reasons.\n Firstly, Wangdong City\u2019s leader had personally visited Old Master Han and Han Zhan, begging him to build the company in Wanyu County. He hoped that this tourism industry would bring economic development to Wanyu County.\n Secondly, the economy of Wanyu County was relatively backward and the local demolition fees were relatively cheap. Han Zhan was also a businessman and naturally did whatever he could to save money.\n Thirdly, the topography of Wanyu County was relatively flat and it was easy to build a large airships station. In addition, the environment of this area was small and it was easy to build hotels and resorts later on.\n Han Zhan planned to turn Wanyu County into a tourist spot.\n Over the past few months, the local demolition work had already been completed. Tomorrow, they would officially start construction of an aviation tourism station.\n This was a major event and Han Zhan had to attend the ceremony personally.\n Early in the morning, Ah Song and Long Yu fetched Han Zhan away. Han Zhan would be gone for three to four days, so he wouldn\u2019t be back at night.\n Song Ci was at home giving prenatal education to the children. She practiced the piano in the morning, read books in the afternoon, and listened to music for the children at night.\n That night, when the music was playing, Du Xueyan\u2019s song automatically played on her cell phone.\n Song Ci thought that Du Xueyan\u2019s voice was nice and that the babies might like it, so she didn\u2019t change it.\n But the babies, who were initially still, suddenly started kicking her stomach after hearing Du Xueyan\u2019s voice.\n Song Ci clicked her tongue. \u201cAs expected of my children. Like me, you don\u2019t like this woman. Then Mother will delete all her songs, alright?\u201d\n Song Ci deleted Du Xueyan\u2019s song from the music app and felt refreshed.\n \u201cLet\u2019s listen to Uncle Liang Bo, okay?\u201d She played Liang Bo\u2019s song and the little guys turned over in her tummy and kicked gently.\n Holding back her laughter, Song Ci wrote down this interesting incident and sent it to Liang Bo.\n Liang Bo replied with a laughing emoticon.\n Liang Bo: [Goddess, have you seen Weibo?]\n Recently, Goddess Song had been very cultured and didn\u2019t look at Weibo much. She was afraid that the gossip on Weibo would dirty her eyes and lead her child astray.\n Song Ci: [No, what happened? Let me see now.]\n Liang Bo:[ Oh big news. This morning, Du Xueyan came back from her treatment. In the afternoon, a media company suddenly exposed Du Xueyan\u2019s past relationship history. They said...]\n Song Ci: [What did they say?]\n Liang Bo: [They said she is Mr. Han\u2019s first girlfriend.]\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Exposed by the media?\n She didn\u2019t believe it. Du Xueyan probably found someone to expose it herself.\n This dog, is she trying to cause trouble after recovering from her illness?\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "215": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-216\n\n Chapter 215: Grandpa Teaches Du Xueyan How to Live  Song Ci replied to Liang Bo: [I\u2019ll go take a look. She opened Weibo and browsed through today\u2019s trending topics.]\n After spending 10 minutes, Song Ci finally understood what the scandal today was about. This scandal was really not spread by Du Xueyan. Song Ci had wronged her.\n The reason for this was...\n A female classmate who had graduated from Shunchen High School and was in the same class as Du Xueyan had posted on Weibo and shaded the relationship between Du Xueyan and Han Zhan, after knowing that Han Zhan was Zeus Corporation\u2019s CEO.\n Her Weibo name was \u201cA Lowly, Smelly Bug.\u201d\n A Lowly, Smelly Bug wrote: [The goddess kicked the grassroots school prince in the past. Who knew that many years later, the grassroots school beau turned into the CEO of a major corporation? I just want to ask the goddess if she regrets it.]\n Her message was posted on New Year\u2019s Eve and she had only hundreds of fans, most of which were her colleagues and ex-classmates.\n After seeing this post, her friends who knew the inside story all left gloating comments under her Weibo account, but didn\u2019t name the goddess or the school beau.\n No one should have noticed this incident, but this morning, the video of Du Xueyan returning to the country after recovering from her illness attracted attention online. No one knew if this old classmate of hers had a grudge against Du Xueyan or if he just wanted to attract attention, but he published a huge piece of news and even openly tagged Du Xueyan and Han Zhan.\n She exposed them and wrote:\n [Thinking back, the campus goddess and the school prince were such an eye-catching couple. At that time, the goddess did her best to woo the male idol.]\n It was said that in order to woo her idol, the goddess had exhausted all means to get a personally signed basketball by Yao Ming. On a snowy night, she dressed up beautifully and went to confess her love to her idol below his house.\n The cold and unfeeling male idol actually hardened his heart and blocked the female protagonist outside the door, causing her to stand downstairs for three to four hours. Later on, the snow fell harder and harder, and the male idol was finally moved by the goddess and accepted her pursuit.\n In their third year of high school, the male idol and goddess were very loving. They went out together and was the envy of everyone\u2019s eyes.\n The goddess was a student in the arts class and had a pleasant voice. She was determined to get into the music academy and eventually did get into Wangdong Music Academy. Meanwhile, the male idol had an ordinary family background and was a top student in the science class. After graduating from high school, he didn\u2019t go to university but went to the military.\n At that time, everyone predicted that the male idol and goddess would definitely break up.\n But in the four years of university, the goddess actually didn\u2019t break up with the male idol. Just when everyone thought that the goddess and the male idol were close to getting married, they broke up!\n It was said that the goddess had initiated the breakup because her male idol was injured and had two fingers broken. Her male idol, who came from an ordinary family and was physically handicapped, couldn\u2019t give her the life she wanted.\n The goddess was ambitious and wanted fame and fortune. As a result, she abandoned her first boyfriend, whom she had chased after with all her might.\n I just want to ask the goddess, now that your singing career has reached the peak and you are in the limelight, seeing your poor male idol suddenly becoming the CEO of a major international corporation, you should also be tempted, right?\n @ Du Xueyan @ Han Zhan.]\n When this Weibo post was posted, it was trending in real-time.\n As the netizens looked at the trending Weibo posts, they naturally saw her post.\n Many people suspected that this blogger was spreading rumors.\n At this moment, the blogger released several old photos. There were a total of three people in the photos\u2014Han Zhan, Du Xueyan, and a girl.\n That woman was also very beautiful.\n The blogger posted another Weibo message: [That\u2019s right, I am the other girl in the photo. Don\u2019t ask me who I am. It\u2019s just that back then, I had a crush on my male idol but was locked up in the toilet by the girl. She pointed at my nose and scolded me, telling me that I was a lowly bug passerby.]\n A Lowly, Smelly Bug was her Weibo name. It was the name Du Xueyan had given her.\n With the photo as evidence, it added some authenticity to the news.\n This piece of news quickly climbed to the top of Weibo\u2019s trending topics. By the time Liang Bo discovered it, all the netizens in the country had already finished watching the show.\n By the time Song Ci discovered this, the popularity couldn\u2019t be suppressed anymore.\n Han Zhan must be very busy today and probably didn\u2019t have the time to look at Weibo. If he wasn\u2019t busy, he would have gotten the public relations department to come up with a solution the moment he discovered these revelations.\n Song Ci opened Du Xueyan\u2019s Weibo and saw that she had updated her Weibo status a minute ago.\n Du Xueyan V: [I once loved you. I was the one who took the initiative to pursue you and also the one who initiated the breakup. I didn\u2019t stir up any trouble. Not disturbing each other is the best form of respect for each other.]\n Song Ci was stunned.\n She admitted it so openly?\n This was not enough. Song Ci refreshed again and saw that Du Xueyan had updated her status.\n Du Xueyan V: [Lin Piaopiao, back then you were a smelly bug in my eyes. Now, you have leveled up, you have become a prancing clown.]\n Speaking of this Du Xueyan, even if she was annoying, she was really tough as a person when she got angry, as she openly quarreled with her love rival in high school on Weibo just like that.\n Song Ci decided to wait and see what would happen next.\n This was the entanglement between Han Zhan\u2019s ex and his admirer. As Han Zhan\u2019s official wife, Song Ci should be quiet and beautiful alone.\n Song Ci logged out of Weibo and was about to go to bed, when she received a new message.\n Song Ci opened WeChat and saw that Du Xueyan\u2019s profile photo had jumped to second place.\n As she had already pinned Han Zhan\u2019s chat on WeChat, anyone else who sent a message would always be second.\n Song Ci raised her brows and thought to herself, What is this girl\u2019s motive for sending me a message at this time? She opened the chat box and saw Du Xueyan asking, [Song Ci, are you there? Let\u2019s have a chat.]\n Song Ci: [...]\n She thought: What\u2019s there to chat about?\n Du Xueyan: [Have you seen tonight\u2019s revelations?]\n Song Ci: [.]\n Du Xueyan: [I didn\u2019t release the news. I won\u2019t shoot myself in the foot.]\n Song Ci: [Oh.]\n Song Ci\u2019s reply was not a full stop. It was just a simple \u201coh\u201d. Du Xueyan felt like she had punched cotton and was especially depressed.\n Song Ci saw that Du Xueyan stopped talking, so she was about to log out of WeChat. At this moment, Du Xueyan sent another message.\n Du Xueyan: [Are you angry?]\n Song Ci: [Shouldn\u2019t I be angry?]\n Song Ci: [As an ex, can\u2019t you just be quiet and beautiful alone? Why must you drag my man into the trending topics? Should I be happy that my man and his ex are trending?]\n Song Ci was like a little steel cannon with a straightforward and fiery character. Du Xueyan was impressed.\n A few months ago, after knowing the true identity of Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather from Gu Shengyao, Du Xueyan felt that she had been deceived by Han Zhan back then.\n If Han Zhan hadn\u2019t hidden his real family background from her, she wouldn\u2019t have been forced to break up with him and signed a contract with Gu Shengyao back then because she was desperate!\n Du Xueyan was also angry. She was angry at Han Zhan, who had reservations about her, and angry at herself when she was young and unwilling to confess her family\u2019s plight to Han Zhan.\n When a person was angry, she would easily do something wrong.\n On impulse, Du Xueyan sent Song Ci a provocative voice message.\n Song Ci opened the voice message and amplified it. She heard Du Xueyan say: [What should I do then, Song Ci? Who asked me to be Han Zhan\u2019s first love? Song Ci, not only did I pull him onto the trending topics, I even held his hand and kissed him in the past.]\n Song Ci was enraged!\n If Song Ci could still tolerate it, she was inhuman!\n Han Zhan\u2019s ex had already shot at her. How could she not throw a bomb back?\n Song Ci coughed and cleared her throat. She pretended to be cold and elegant, as she calmly replied to Du Xueyan\u2019s three voice messages.\n Du Xueyan clicked on the first voice message and Song Ci\u2019s lovely voice sounded from the speaker.\n [Du Xueyan, are you very smug? Is it so great that you held his hand? Is it so great that you kissed him? No matter how glorious and proud you are, you are just an ex. You can only hold his hand for a while, but I can hold his hand for the rest of my life. You have only kissed his mouth, but I can kiss every inch of his skin openly.]\n Du Xueyan\u2019s breathing became heavier.\n She opened the second voice message and Song Ci\u2019s tone was still calm.\n [Du Xueyan, have you seen him cry? You are just his first love, but I am his wife. The closest you are to him is just holding his hand and kissing him. As for me? I am the one who printed the word Song Ci on Han Zhan\u2019s family register!]\n The third message: [The person whom you looked down on and abandoned has become my husband, my treasure, and the father of my child. The person that you\u2019re not qualified to call Grandpa makes soup for me everyday and dotes on me like a little princess! Du Xueyan, apart from being his first love, what else do you have to show off?]\n Song Ci said those harsh words in her most casual tone.\n In the middle of the night, Du Xueyan\u2019s bedroom was very quiet. Song Ci\u2019s voice echoed in every corner of the room. After hearing that voice, Du Xueyan was both angry and agitated, her entire body trembling.\n She did not know that the seemingly innocent Song Ci was actually so glib-tongued and harsh with her words.\n Du Xueyan was furious. She smashed her cell phone hard against the wall, creating a hole.\n Still feeling that she had not vented enough, Du Xueyan turned around and wanted to smash the items on the table. She raised her arm and was about to swing it down, when she noticed that all the items on the table were her music trophies.\n This was her honor. She couldn\u2019t live without them.\n Du Xueyan stood rooted to the ground and panted heavily. After a moment, her entire body felt limp as she sat down on the wooden floor.\n She buried her head between her legs and felt like crying.\n \u2013\n After Song Ci sent that voice message, Du Xueyan didn\u2019t reply. Only then did she feel slightly better.\n Only you can?\n Only you know how to stab someone in the heart?\n It was so easy to stab someone. It all depended on whether you\u2019re willing to do so!\n Song Ci was still angry.\n She opened her laptop and wrote a long post, which she posted on her Weibo page for her husband to read.\n Song Song Song Song Ci: [There was once a little girl who fell in love with a wild cat. She coaxed and deceived the wild cat to bring it home. She told it, \u201cI like you. I only like you. Let\u2019s be family in the future.\u201d]\n The wild cat gradually accepted the little girl and treated her as family.\n But one day, the little girl saw an even more beautiful and expensive Persian cat. She was deeply impressed by its elegance and beauty and wanted to bring it home.\n The Persian cat told the little girl: I am of a noble breed and I hate wild cats the most. If you want me, you must throw away that ugly, cheap wild cat!\n After struggling for a few days, the little girl finally abandoned the little wild cat and brought the Persian cat home.\n Later on, the wild cat met another girl, B, and he was brought home by her. She took good care of him and he grew stronger and more handsome.\n Meanwhile, after losing the wild cat, the little girl realized that the Persian cat had a bad temper and was difficult to get along with. Gradually, she started to detest the cat.\n One day, the little girl happened to see the strong and handsome wild cat raised by Girl B.\n Realizing that it was the cat she had abandoned before, the little girl was jealous. She started crying to everyone. \u201cThe little wild cat was clearly mine. We were each other\u2019s one and only, but Girl B stole it!\u201d\n Just a bedtime story. I don\u2019t mean anything else. If you know, you know.]\n Turning off her laptop, Song Ci also turned off her cell phone. The entire world was quiet. Song Ci fell asleep immediately and had a good night\u2019s sleep.\n The next day, Song Ci woke up to find someone sitting on the sofa by the window.\n As the curtains were closed, that person\u2019s figure was especially blurry in the faint light, but also tall and strong.\n Song Ci sat up and rubbed her eyes. Only then did she see this person\u2019s face clearly. \u201cBrother Han?\u201d Song Ci was very surprised. \u201cBrother Han, why are you back?\u201d Han Zhan should have returned tonight.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t sleep the entire night. His voice was slightly hoarse. \u201cI was very busy yesterday. It was already late at night when I saw those revelations. I saw that Weibo post you posted. I called you, but I couldn\u2019t get through.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked up and gazed at Song Ci\u2019s slightly flushed face. He said, \u201cSong Ci, I care a lot about you. I was worried that you would sulk alone, so I rushed back overnight.\u201d\n When he rushed home and saw Song Ci sleeping soundly with the air conditioning turned on, he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n Song Ci pulled away the thin blanket on her body. She got up, walked up to Han Zhan, and squatted down.\n Placing her head on Han Zhan\u2019s knee, Song Ci looked up and saw the bluish-grey color under Han Zhan\u2019s eyes. She frowned slightly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep last night?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fall asleep on the plane. It was already 4am when I got home, so I decided not to sleep.\u201d\n \u201cYou...\u201d Initially, Song Ci was still slightly angry, but after waking up early in the morning and seeing the person she missed the most, all the anger in Song Ci\u2019s heart disappeared.\n \u201cBrother Han, don\u2019t worry. I am not so petty as to split hair. I will retort whoever I dislike. I will never mistreat myself.\u201d Song Ci had suffered too much in her previous life and decided to live a carefree life this time.\n Han Zhan stroked Song Ci\u2019s hair and said, \u201cYou are only 23 years old. People at this age are always impulsive. When I was your age, I was as stubborn as a furnace. Our leaders couldn\u2019t do anything to me.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m worried that you will do something irrational in a fit of anger. I won\u2019t be at ease if I don\u2019t come back to visit you.\u201d Han Zhan finally felt at ease, when he realized that Song Ci was sleeping soundly after he reached home.\n Song Ci stood up and sat in Han Zhan\u2019s arms.\n Hugging Han Zhan\u2019s neck, Song Ci asked him, \u201cAre you going back to Shunchen later?\u201d\n \u201cYes, I am going to inspect the construction site of the resort. I will be back slightly late tonight.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cThen you must sleep more on the way. If it\u2019s too late at night, stay over there for the night and come back tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cI will be back tonight. I am on leave tomorrow.\u201d Han Zhan had been working for more than 20 days and would collapse if he didn\u2019t rest soon.\n Only then was Song Ci satisfied.\n \u201cOh yes, I have already replied to what happened yesterday. You can look at my reply when you turn on your cell phone later. I am going to wash my face now. Accompany me downstairs for breakfast later. I will be leaving after breakfast.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan went to the toilet to wash his face. Only then did Song Ci turn on her cell phone. She directly entered Han Zhan\u2019s Weibo page and saw that Han Zhan had also posted a status at 1am last night.\n Han Han Han Han Zhan: [The wild cat is very lucky to meet Girl B. She used kindness and patience to reignite the cold heart of that abandoned wild cat. @ Song Song Song Song Song Ci, Baby Ci, you are my present and future.]\n Song Ci felt satisfied with Han Zhan\u2019s words.\n Six hours later, there were actually 60,000 comments under Han Zhan\u2019s Weibo account. Song Ci roughly browsed through the comments and was relieved, when she saw that everyone\u2019s comments were very neutral and not slanderous.\n Han Zhan washed his face and shaved, before walking out of the toilet. He called Song Ci down for breakfast.\n \u2013\n Han Aoyu was going to play Tai Chi this morning and Zhong Buhui made breakfast.\n Zhong Buhui didn\u2019t pay attention to those things on Weibo. Seeing Han Zhan and Song Ci coming down together, he even teased Han Zhan. \u201cAfter Zhanzhan got married, he became homesick. This morning, I saw your car parked outside and thought I saw wrongly.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui thought that Han Zhan rushed home that very night because he couldn\u2019t bear to part with Song Ci.\n Han Zhan and Song Ci smiled at each other. They didn\u2019t tell their families about the mess outside. \u201cAh, Uncle Zhong did you make beef noodles?\u201d\n Zhanzhan was a meat lover and loved Uncle Zhong\u2019s bowl of beef noodles.\n \u201cZhanzhan has been working very hard recently, so I had to make something that you like to reward you.\u201d Zhong Buhui pointed at the largest bowl of noodles and said, \u201cThat\u2019s yours.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t stand on ceremony. He sat down, picked up his chopsticks, and started eating.\n By the time Han Aoyu returned from his tai chi session, Han Zhan had already finished his meal and was wiping his mouth. Han Aoyu looked at Han Zhan and snorted coldly.\n Han Zhan felt puzzled. \u201cGrandpa... who made you angry?\u201d\n Han Aoyu sat down on the main seat beside Song Ci. He snorted in a sarcastic manner and said, \u201cSome people can\u2019t handle their own love life well. Don\u2019t affect our Song Lass\u2019s mood. If the child in her womb is also unhappy, I will settle the score with you.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt slightly helpless. \u201cGrandpa, you already know?\u201d\n Zhong Buhui looked confused. He asked Han Aoyu, \u201cOld Master, what happened?\u201d\n Han Aoyu glanced at Song Ci and saw that she looked calm. He then told Zhong Buhui, \u201cIt\u2019s that little girl who kicked Zhanzhan away in the past. She has been stirring up trouble recently and yesterday, someone even exposed Zhanzhan and that little girl\u2019s past.\u201d\n Han Aoyu patted the back of Song Ci\u2019s hand and said, \u201cSong Lass, don\u2019t worry. Han Zhan and that girl\u2019s relationship is a thing of the past. Han Zhan is still devoted to you.\u201d\n Song Ci suppressed her laughter and nodded. \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not angry.\u201d\n Han Zhan told Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ve already met Du Xueyan and told her about us very clearly.\u201d\n Knowing that Han Aoyu wanted his own stance, Han Zhan\u2019s expression turned serious. He said, \u201cIf Miss Du makes trouble again, I will take forceful measures.\u201d\n Han Aoyu acknowledged. \u201cRemember, the woman who trampled you into the dust back then is not worth your kindness\u201d\n \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n After breakfast, Han Zhan bid Song Ci farewell reluctantly and flew back to Shunchen\u2019s work.\n Song Ci had agreed with Su Huanyan yesterday that she would go shopping for baby products today. After dinner, she packed up briefly and got into the car to leave.\n Once Song Ci left, Han Aoyu called Zhong Buhui over.\n Han Aoyu had changed into a white t-shirt, black-grey suit pants, and black open-toed sandals. Zhong Buhui stood beside Han Aoyu with his head lowered. Upon seeing Old Master Han\u2019s attire, he bowed and asked, \u201cOld Master, are you going out?\u201d\n Old Master would only wear a t-shirt when he went out. At home, he usually wore a vest when the weather was hot.\n Han Aoyu pointed at the air and said, \u201cPrepare the car. Let\u2019s go meet that girl.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui looked hesitant. \u201cShould we inform Zhanzhan? This is their problem after all.\u201d\n \u201cNo need!\u201d\n Seeing that Han Aoyu insisted on going, Zhong Buhui personally drove Old Master Han out of the villa.\n \u2013\n Du Xueyan was going to attend a jewelry brand commercial event that she was endorsing today. She had a simple breakfast, before getting the stylist team to style her.\n Du Xueyan was wearing a black halter dress with highlights. She was wearing a pair of 10cm red high heels with a luxury jewelry brand around her neck and ears.\n Her lips were fiery red and her curly hair was coquettish. After dressing up, she looked radiant and bright.\n Her assistant, Tong Xin, looked at the time and said to Du Xueyan, \u201cSister Xue, I\u2019m afraid of traffic jams. We have to leave early.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Du Xueyan walked out of the house and was about to board the limousine, when she saw a male elder in a black suit walk over. That elder was in his early fifties and wasn\u2019t tall, but he was very burly. His eyes were as vicious as a hawk\u2019s.\n Tong Xin saw that man walking straight towards them. He instinctively stood in front of Du Xueyan and stared at that person warily.\n The man stood one meter away from Tong Xin. He stared at the beautiful woman behind Tong Xin and said gently, \u201cMiss Du Xueyan, my Old Master invites you over for a chat.\u201d\n Tong Xin frowned and said unhappily, \u201cWho is your Old Master? Do we have to go just because he wants to? Our Sister Xue still has work. Please move aside.\u201d\n But Du Xueyan grabbed Tong Xin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTong Xin, move aside.\u201d\n Tong Xin turned and glanced at Du Xueyan. Although she was worried, she still didn\u2019t dare to disobey Du Xueyan, so she could only stand aside and remain silent.\n Du Xueyan looked up slightly at Zhong Buhui and asked, \u201cSir, is the Old Master you\u2019re talking about Old Master Han?\u201d\n \u201cMiss Du is a sensible person.\u201d Zhong Buhui nodded at the black Aoyu Number 1 behind him. \u201cOur Old Master is sitting in the car. Miss Du, if it\u2019s convenient, we can go to the tearoom for a chat.\u201d\n Du Xueyan pondered for a moment, before saying to Tong Xin, \u201cCall Gu Shengyao and tell him that I have something on and can\u2019t attend today\u2019s event. Ask him to negotiate with the brands. If he can\u2019t, then compensate them.\u201d\n Tong Xin instinctively said, \u201cSister Xue, you don\u2019t even know who the other party is. It\u2019s not good to just abandon your work and leave!\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s face darkened. \u201cTong Xin, listen to me.\u201d\n Tong Xin had no choice but to shut up.\n Du Xueyan got into the car and followed Zhong Buhui.\n After parking the car at the entrance of a tearoom, Du Xueyan alighted and stood beside the car. She looked at the old man who alighted from the car.\n Many years ago, Du Xueyan had met the old man once. At that time, he was wearing rough hemp clothes and loose shoes with yellow mud under his fingernails.\n Who would dare to believe that the famous Han Aoyu, whose name alone could make the little ghosts of the foreign countries afraid, would actually roll up his pants and farm after retirement?\n Du Xueyan saw that the old man was looking at her. She bent over slightly and called out respectfully, \u201cOld Master Han.\u201d Faced with Han Aoyu, Du Xueyan had an uncontrollable urge to kneel down to him.\n This must be pressure.\n It was the aura of a high ranking leader who was used to giving orders.\n But she was blind. Eight years ago, when she first met Old Master, she was actually blinded by his overly simple outfit. She really thought he was a farmer.\n Han Aoyu raised his hand. \u201cDu Family girl, let\u2019s go in and chat.\u201d\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui led the way while Han Aoyu walked in the middle. Du Xueyan was two meters behind the old man and quietly followed behind them.\n Apart from the waiter, there was no one else in the tearoom today.\n Perhaps it was because it was still early or the venue had been cleared.\n Han Aoyu sat down at the table by the window. Du Xueyan stood obediently by the side and didn\u2019t dare to sit down without Han Aoyu\u2019s approval.\n But Han Aoyu didn\u2019t put on airs. He saw Du Xueyan standing and said kindly, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Sit down.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Du Xueyan gently pulled out a chair and sat down.\n The waiter walked over and asked Han Aoyu in a low voice if he needed her to make tea for them.\n Han Aoyu waved his hand and said, \u201cEveryone can go first. I will do it myself.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n All the bosses, managers, and waiters in the tearoom left.\n The main hall of the tearoom was silent. Du Xueyan listened to the sound of the tea brewing and felt uneasy. She didn\u2019t know why this old man was looking for her. Could it be that yesterday\u2019s incident had reached his ears?\n Or did Song Ci blow into the old man\u2019s ear?\n As if hearing Du Xueyan\u2019s thoughts, Han Aoyu, who was focused on brewing tea, suddenly said, \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. I came to look for you not because of Lass Song or Han Zhan.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s heart ached slightly when she saw Han Aoyu addressing Song Ci as \u201cLass Song\u201d, but she maintained a faint smile. She only put on thick makeup and her smile added charm and coy.\n Han Aoyu looked at Du Xueyan\u2019s face and said, \u201cYou look slightly different from in the photo.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was shocked. \u201cIn the photo?\u201d Du Xueyan quickly understood and asked in surprise, \u201cOld Master, you also watch entertainment news?\u201d\n Du Xueyan thought that Han Aoyu had seen her photo on the news.\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing bad about entertainment news. Only when the world is peaceful and happy will entertainment celebrities monopolize the headlines of major social media platforms.\u201d\n Han Aoyu smiled and said, \u201cThe development of the entertainment industry has also led to the development of our country\u2019s economy. I never felt that being a singer or actress is a profession that can\u2019t be shown on stage.\u201d\n \u201cAny occupation that exists is reasonable.\u201d\n Hearing Old Master\u2019s words, Du Xueyan felt a sense of admiration.\n She had met many big shots with high status, but those people all looked down on the people in the entertainment circles. She didn\u2019t expect the truly powerful Old Master Han to have such a view.\n Han Aoyu spoke again, interrupting Du Xueyan\u2019s thoughts. He said, \u201cI saw your photo 10 years ago.\u201d\n Seeing Du Xueyan look over in shock, Han Aoyu smiled at her and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Han Zhan once showed me and his grandmother your photo.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was stunned.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t know...\u201d She was slightly dazed.\n Han Aoyu said, \u201cAt that time, his grandmother was not in good health. During the new year, Han Zhan took a leave and came back. In order to make his grandmother happy, he showed her your photo.\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan told us that the girl in the photo is his girlfriend that he met in high school. He said that when your career stabilizes, he will marry you.\u201d\n Du Xueyan was shocked beyond words. \u201cHe never told me this...\u201d\n \u201cHe was very depressed at that time and kept everything to himself. He told us that you studied music and wanted to be a singer. He said that he wanted to wait a few more years for you to make a name for yourself before proposing to you. He felt that getting married too early would tie you down.\u201d\n Han Aoyu spoke of this past very calmly, but Du Xueyan felt like her heart was being stabbed.\n \u201cS-Sorry.\u201d Du Xueyan stared at the tolerant smile on Han Aoyu\u2019s lips and felt very ashamed. Thinking of the ruthless things she did when they broke up, Du Xueyan felt like crying.\n She held back her tears and decided to tell Han Aoyu the truth about their breakup back then. \u201cOld Master Han, it\u2019s my fault for breaking up with Han Zhan under such circumstances. But I also have my own difficulties that I can\u2019t speak of.\u201d\n Han Aoyu looked at Du Xueyan calmly and didn\u2019t interrupt her.\n Du Xueyan said, \u201cMy mother was diagnosed with uremia in my first year of university. She had to go for a blood transfusion every week. During the few years that we were treating her, all our savings were spent. Later, the doctor told us that my mother\u2019s condition worsened and she needed a kidney transplant.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, I was so anxious about my mother\u2019s condition. I had no money and had no way out. I wanted to tell Han Zhan about this, but he suddenly got injured. I rushed to the hospital after hearing the news and saw Grandpa...\u201d\n Du Xueyan stopped and stared at the old man opposite her who was not dressed extravagantly but was very clean. She said in a self-deprecating manner, \u201cI mistook Old Master Han for an old farmer. I thought that Han Zhan\u2019s family background was ordinary. Under those circumstances, I really couldn\u2019t open my mouth to borrow money from Han Zhan.\u201d\n \u201cCoincidentally, my management company found me at that time and wanted to sign me and promote me as a singer. The signing fee was very high and I needed money, so I steeled my heart and abandoned Han Zhan.\u201d\n Du Xueyan didn\u2019t exaggerate the truth or try to cover up for herself. She just wanted to tell the truth and salvage a good impression for herself from the old man\u2019s heart.\n After hearing her explanation, Han Aoyu actually said, \u201cIt\u2019s really like that...\u201d\n Hearing his words, Du Xueyan felt that something was off. She felt slightly puzzled and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cOld Master Han, could it be that you know about my family\u2019s situation then?\u201d\n Han Aoyu nodded in acknowledgment. \u201cYou heartlessly abandoned my grandson back then. I was so angry that I went to check on your family and found out about your mother.\u201d\n The tea was boiling.\n Han Aoyu poured hot water into the tea leaves. He watched as the concentrated dried tea leaves relaxed in the hot water and sprouted tender green shoots.\n \u201cAfter Han Zhan was discharged, I told him about what happened at your house. Han Zhan guessed the reason why you broke up with him and calmly accepted the truth.\u201d\n \u201cOn account that you two were in love, Han Zhan specially hired an outstanding medical team to perform the surgery for your mother.\u201d\n Du Xueyan exclaimed. She covered her mouth and muttered in shock, \u201cHow could this be...\u201d\n Han Aoyu asked Du Xueyan, \u201cDid the hospital tell you that that medical team just happened to be in Wangdong City and performed a kidney transplant on your mother?\u201d\n Du Xueyan hurriedly nodded. \u201cYes, I always thought it was just a coincidence and that my mother was lucky. In that case, that medical team was specially hired by Han Zhan?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Han Aoyu narrowed his eyes and looked at the blue sky outside the window. He sighed. \u201cOur Han Zhan is a very serious person when it comes to relationships. When he said that he liked you, he really liked you. Even if you broke up with him, he still helped your family.\u201d\n \u201cXueyan little girl.\u201d Han Aoyu\u2019s gaze suddenly turned sharp.\n Du Xueyan felt slightly uneasy.\n She heard Han Aoyu say, \u201cDuring your relationship, Han Zhan must have told you who his grandfather is.\u201d\n Du Xueyan nodded distractedly. \u201cYes, he mentioned you to me and your name, but I...\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just that you don\u2019t pay attention to military affairs or national matters. You don\u2019t know Han Aoyu.\u201d Han Aoyu continued to make up for Du Xueyan\u2019s words that she was too embarrassed to say.\n Du Xueyan lowered her head in shame.\n Han Aoyu added. \u201cFrom the start to the end, Han Zhan never hid his identity from you. Don\u2019t think that Han Zhan let you down. Our Han Zhan didn\u2019t let you down at all. He has already done all that he can.\u201d\n No matter how shameless Du Xueyan was, she wouldn\u2019t feel that Han Zhan had let her down.\n She was the one at fault!\n Han Zhan was already very kind to her!\n Han Aoyu handed a cup of tea to Du Xueyan. Du Xueyan reached out to hold it and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n Han Aoyu smiled but didn\u2019t say anything.\n He drank a cup of tea and suddenly asked Du Xueyan, \u201cOur Han Zhan still didn\u2019t contact you after knowing the real reason behind your breakup with him. Do you know why?\u201d\n Du Xueyan thought for a moment before saying, \u201cBecause Han Zhan also has his pride and dignity.\u201d\n \u201cYes. Han Zhan\u2019s pride won\u2019t allow him to do anything foolish like returning to his ex. He used nearly two years to forget you and spent six years alone in peace. Finally, he met someone else who moved him.\u201d\n Han Aoyu picked up the hot tea and took a small sip. He put down the cup and made a loud sound.\n The old man said, \u201cLife is like tea. The tea is cold when one is gone. Xueyan, you left him yourself. You have to bear the consequences yourself.\u201d\n \u201cThere is already a new person using their hands to warm that cooling tea. You can\u2019t selfishly want to snatch that tea back.\u201d\n \u201cPlease show mercy and let our Han Zhan off.\u201d\n This last sentence was Han Aoyu\u2019s motive for this trip.\n Regardless of whether what happened yesterday was a self-directed act by Du Xueyan, the matter between her and Han Zhan had already been exposed. The public opinion and attention would definitely drag Song Ci out.\n Meanwhile, Han Aoyu would never allow the outside world to criticize Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s relationship.\n Du Xueyan had to disappear from Han Zhan and Song Ci\u2019s lives.\n Han Aoyu even said \u201cplease\u201d. His words rendered Du Xueyan speechless. Du Xueyan\u2019s organs were hurting. At this moment, she deeply realized that she had really lost Han Zhan.\n Han Aoyu didn\u2019t speak again. He just held his tea and sipped it. He looked at the scenery outside the window, waiting for Du Xueyan\u2019s promise.\n Du Xueyan knew that the old man was waiting for her words.\n She knew very well that once she said those words, she and Han Zhan would really have nothing to do with each other anymore.\n Du Xueyan placed her hands under the table and clenched them tightly. She had already bitten her lower lip so hard that there was a deep cut.\n Han Aoyu was running out of patience.\n He put down his cup and pretended to stand up.\n Du Xueyan\u2019s heart suddenly tightened. At that moment, Du Xueyan realized that although Han Aoyu said \u201cplease\u201d, he was actually warning her to face reality!\n If she really let Han Aoyu leave just like that, her career and future would be gone.\n Du Xueyan grabbed the table and said hoarsely, \u201cI won\u2019t disturb his life again. I...\u201d Seeing Han Aoyu look over, Du Xueyan added,\u201d I will go to Hollywood to develop my career. \u201d\n Han Aoyu nodded in approval. \u201cMiss Du is a smart lady. You will definitely be able to make a name for yourself in Hollywood.\u201d\n With his words, Du Xueyan wouldn\u2019t have to worry about not having any resources when she arrived in Hollywood.\n Du Xueyan released the table in shock.\n Han Aoyu picked up his straw hat and was about to leave when Du Xueyan suddenly felt an urge.\n She said urgently and guiltily to Han Aoyu\u2019s back view, \u201cOld Master, please apologize to Han Zhan on my behalf.\u201d\n Han Aoyu didn\u2019t answer and just left.\n \u2013\n Song Ci and Su Huanyan shopped at the mother and baby store. They felt that they needed to buy everything. By the time she settled the bill, she already filled two trolleys.\n Their children were about the same size. Song Ci\u2019s due date was at the end of winter on the lunar calendar, while Su Huanyan\u2019s due date was in the middle of December.\n The two of them bought similar things.\n After settling the bill, Su Huanyan invited Song Ci to watch a movie.\n Coincidentally, the Titanic was screening again, so the two of them bought tickets to the movie. It was not noon yet and there were not many people at the theater. The two of them sat down and ate a fruit platter while watching a movie.\n After watching the movie, Su Huanyan told Song Ci, \u201cThe first time I watched this movie was when I was 14 years old. At that time, I felt that Jack and Rose were really too compatible and cried bitterly over their separation.\u201d\n It was the same for Song Ci.\n \u201cWhat about now?\u201d\n Su Huanyan smiled gently and said, \u201cNow that I look at it, I have come to a realization. This adulterous couple will never have a good ending.\u201d\n Song Ci suppressed her laughter. \u201cYou have a point.\u201d\n The Miss Su raised by the Su Family in the South was different from her appearance.\n She looked like a blooming flower, but there was a small cannonball hidden under its gentle skin. It was usually silent, but it would explode at the slightest trigger.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "216": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-217\n\n Chapter 216: May I Trouble You to Sign the Divorce Agreement  Just as they were about to leave the theater, Su Huanyan suddenly called out to Song Ci.\n \u201cSong Ci.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci turned to look at Su Huanyan. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Su Huanyan sized Song Ci up seriously. She was relieved to see that Song Ci didn\u2019t look sad or distressed. Instead, she looked like she was in a good mood.\n Su Huanyan said gently, \u201cSong Ci, just look and forget about those revelations on Weibo. Don\u2019t let it hurt your heart. Moreover, you are now Han Zhan\u2019s official partner. Even if she, Du Xueyan, wants to turn back, she will still be a mistress. You also saw what happened to her just now. She will drown in the sea.\u201d\n Song Ci had already gotten over what happened that day. Hearing Su Huanyan\u2019s words, she felt rather amused. She smiled and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never wronged myself. I will take revenge on whoever that offends me.\u201d\n With that, Song Ci thought of Su Huanyan and Cheng Yanmo.\n At the thought that Cheng Yanmo still had Mu Qiu in his heart, Song Ci felt slightly aggrieved for Su Huanyan. \u201cHuanyan, how are you and Mr. Cheng?\u201d\n Song Ci really treated Su Huanyan as a friend. She still hoped that Su Huanyan and Cheng Yanmo could really fall in love. Only then would Su Huanyan not feel lonely for the long years to come.\n Husband and wife had to walk hand in hand for the rest of their lives. If the two of them didn\u2019t have any feelings for each other, that life would be very difficult.\n \u201cUs?\u201d Su Huanyan and Cheng Yanmo had a business marriage to begin with. They each took what they needed, so there was no need to talk about it. They respected and understood each other, and they got along rather well.\n Su Huanyan saw that Song Ci was an exquisite lady and didn\u2019t avoid some things from her. She told Song Ci frankly, \u201cYanmo and I don\u2019t have any relationship foundation. We\u2019re just making do. Although Yanmo is slightly cold, he still respects me quite a bit. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\n She was rather open-minded.\n Hearing Su Huanyan\u2019s words, Song Ci understood that she didn\u2019t have any feelings for Cheng Yanmo and felt relieved instead. She was afraid that Su Huanyan might have feelings for Cheng Yanmo, but there was someone else in his heart.\n As Song Ci thought this, she heard Su Huanyan suddenly ask, \u201cSong Ci, do you know about Cheng Yanmo and Mu Qiu?\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n Unexpectedly, Su Huanyan even knew about Mu Qiu! As expected of a daughter from the Su Family, there was no such thing as an innocent person!\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to nod or shake her head, so she remained silent.\n Her silence made Su Huanyan understand everything. \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. I didn\u2019t mean anything else. I was just asking. Moreover, I can\u2019t control what happened to Yanmo before our wedding. As long as he doesn\u2019t mess around after the wedding and can give me the respect I deserve, I don\u2019t have any other requests.\u201d\n Song Ci walked to the metal chair in the square in front of the theater and sat down. She touched her cell phone awkwardly and asked Su Huanyan, \u201cHuanyan, how did you know about Mu Qiu and Mr. Cheng?\u201d\n Su Huanyan\u2019s answer was very mysterious. She said, \u201cIf you love someone, you can\u2019t hide your gaze. If you don\u2019t love someone, you can\u2019t fake your gaze either.\u201d\n On the night of their wedding, Cheng Yanmo hugged her lovingly. Later on, when he slept in a daze, Su Huanyan heard Xiao Qiu\u2019s name from his mouth.\n Su Huanyan secretly got someone to investigate that Xiao Qiu\u2019s identity.\n The reason why she wanted to investigate that Xiao Qiu\u2019s identity was not because she was jealous of Xiao Qiu and wanted to eliminate her completely. It was because she wanted to understand what kind of girl her husband used to love.\n The information she found shocked Su Huanyan. She didn\u2019t expect that Xiao Qiu was actually the youngest daughter of the Mu Family and Song Ci\u2019s younger sister, Mu Qiu.\n Su Huanyan also treated Song Ci as a friend. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have taken the initiative to ask about Mu Qiu and Cheng Yanmo.\n Su Huanyan told Song Ci, \u201cI also want that kind of love between you and Mr. Han, but Song Ci, love is not something you can have just because you want it. I am now looking forward to the safe birth of the child. In the future, I will bring him to see the world and seriously lead a good life for us.\u201d\n As she spoke, Su Huanyan\u2019s expression was as calm as water. Her heart was truly as still as water. She didn\u2019t have any expectations for love, but it could also be said that she had lost all expectations for love.\n Song Ci suddenly realized that Su Huanyan was also a person with a story. Her gentle but determined eyes hid her past and secrets that she refused to tell.\n \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go eat. It\u2019s time to go back for lunch.\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Okay.\u201d\n Song Ci brought Su Huanyan to the restaurant where she had lunch with Han Zhan previously.\n After lunch, the two of them bid each other farewell and returned home.\n The car stopped in the garage of the villa. Song Ci alighted and heard the sound of wheels turning.\n She looked up in surprise and saw Zhong Buhui driving Old Master home.\n After the car stopped steadily, Song Ci walked over, opened the car door, and helped Grandpa out.\n \u201cLass Song, did you have lunch outside?\u201d Han Aoyu was afraid that Song Ci hadn\u2019t eaten.\n Song Ci nodded and told Grandpa, \u201cI went to eat steamed chicken with Su Huanyan. What about you, Grandpa? Are you going out to play?\u201d\n [fuzzy]\u201dMmm, I went to meet someone.\u201d\n Han Aoyu alighted and put on a sunhat.\n Seeing that Song Ci wasn\u2019t wearing a hat or holding an umbrella, Han Aoyu placed the hat on Song Ci\u2019s head. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring an umbrella when you went out? It\u2019s such a big sun out there. Don\u2019t get tanned.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Grandpa!\u201d\n Song Ci helped Han Aoyu into the house.\n She had broken out in a sweat while strolling outside in the morning. After returning home, Song Ci took a shower and took an afternoon nap. When she woke up, she saw that Shen Yubei had sent her a message on WeChat.\n Shen Yubei: [Come over when you are free. I have created a new song. You have the right to hear it before anyone else does.]\n Song Ci stared at this message and felt that something was off.\n Why does this sound so arrogant?\n Song Ci felt like she had overlooked something.\n What is it?\n It was already 9pm by the time Han Zhan returned home that night. He had showered but didn\u2019t sleep. Instead, he was sitting at the head of the bed reading something on his cell phone.\n Song Ci saw that Han Zhan was playing with his cell phone and thought to herself, Could it be that there\u2019s a little lover living in his cell phone?\n Song Ci glanced at Han Zhan\u2019s cell phone screen and saw that he was looking at ladies\u2019 jewelry.\n \u201cBuying jewelry for me?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s eyes were sparkling.\n ]Han Zhan pulled Song Ci into his arms and asked, \u201cWhich one do you like?\u201d\n Song Ci loved those gorgeous things. Hearing this, she pointed at a set of blue Tanzanite jewelry and said, \u201cI like this.\u201d\n \u201cI knew you loved this.\u201d It was big, flashy, and exaggerated.\n Han Zhan immediately placed an order for that set of jewelry. The address was a villa halfway up the hill.\n Song Ci was overjoyed.\n \u201cMy Godmother Mo Yao is celebrating her birthday. She likes to collect jewelry and I am choosing a birthday present for her. Baby Ci, you have high standards. Tell me, what present should I give her?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI received an invitation to a jewelry auction a few days ago. It will be held the night after tomorrow. Shall we go and take a look?\u201d\n Han Zhan thought about it and nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan mention the word birthday, Song Ci felt like she had forgotten something. She thought for a moment and suddenly slapped Han Zhan\u2019s arm.\n Han Zhan was shocked.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \u201cMy teacher\u2019s birthday is tomorrow!\u201d Song Ci had actually forgotten Shen Yubei\u2019s birthday!\n Shen Yubei had specially sent that message to Song Ci today. He didn\u2019t want her to listen to his new song! He was arrogant and didn\u2019t mean what he said. He actually wanted to invite her to celebrate his birthday with him!\n \u201cTeacher Shen\u2019s birthday tomorrow?\u201d Han Zhan looked down and asked Song Ci, \u201cHave you prepared a birthday present for Teacher Shen?\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly embarrassed. \u201cI forgot. I only remembered it when you mentioned Godmother Mo Yao\u2019s birthday just now.\u201d Shen Yubei\u2019s birthday was tomorrow, and it was too late for Song Ci to choose a present for him now.\n Song Ci felt slightly anxious and guilty.\n How could I forget Teacher\u2019s birthday!\n \u201cHan Zhan, my teacher likes to collect lighters. The more unique the design, the more he likes it. Brother Han, can you help me get a strangely-shaped lighter?\u201d This was the first birthday of Shen Yubei, after Song Ci and Shen Yubei reconciled. Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to neglect it.\n \u201cA lighter?\u201d\n Han Zhan thought of someone and said, \u201cI remember that the director of Empire Entertainment also has a hobby of collecting lighters. Let me ask for you.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan saw that it was not 10pm yet and called Bei Zhan.\n Han Qingshen answered the call.\n \u201cBei Zhan is taking a shower. I\u2019ll get him to call you back later.\u201d Han Qingshen spoke as if she was working, straightforward and without any superfluous words.\n \u201cSister-in-law.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s greeting made Han Qingshen feel very comfortable.\n \u201cSister-in-law, I happen to have something to discuss with you.\u201d Han Zhan had called Bei Zhan with the intention of looking for Han Qingshen. Han Qingshen answered the call and it was exactly what Han Zhan wanted.\n Han Qingshen asked him, \u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt\u2019s like this. There\u2019s an elder whom I respect very much and his birthday is tomorrow. He has a unique hobby and loves to collect lighters. I heard that your company\u2019s Director Yan also has the same hobby, so I wanted to ask Sister-in-law if he is willing to part with it and sell me a lighter?\u201d\n Han Qingshen said, \u201cI will reply to you later.\u201d\n Han Qingshen quickly hung up without hesitation.\n Song Ci heard the beeping sound from the phone and smiled. \u201cManager Bei\u2019s wife is so efficient.\u201d\n \u201cShe is like this. She is decisive in everything.\u201d\n In less than three minutes, Han Qingshen used her own cell phone to call Han Zhan. \u201cYan Rufeng is overseas and can\u2019t come back. He said he will get someone to send the items to your house tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, sorry to trouble you, sister-in-law. Oh yes, have you asked how much the lighter costs?\u201d\n Han Qingshen said, \u201cHe said he would give it to you. Just treat it as making a friend.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I will remember this favor.\u201d\n After hanging up, Han Zhan said to Song Ci, \u201cAlright, you can be rest assured now.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s anxiety also faded.\n \u201cWho is this Yan Rufeng?\u201d At the mention of Empire Entertainment, everyone instinctively thought of the CEO of Empire Entertainment, Han Qingshen. Han Qingshen was famous, but the other senior management in the company didn\u2019t have much of a presence.\n Han Zhan told Song Ci a secret. \u201cThis Yan Rufeng is Han Qingshen\u2019s little father.\u201d\n Song Ci was confused.\n A father is a father, but what\u2019s a little father?\n \u201cLittle father means...\u201d\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cHan Qingshen\u2019s father is Han Chenyi, the founder of the Empire Entertainment. You should know this person. Han Chenyi was unmarried all his life but had a smart daughter. The public has deep guesses about Han Qingshen\u2019s mother\u2019s identity, but very few people know that Han Qingshen given birth to by a surrogate mother that Han Chenyi found.\u201d\n \u201cSurrogate? Han Qingshen must be at least in her thirties. Surrogacy was very rare in that era. Why did Han Chenyi find someone to be a surrogate?\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression was slightly strange. He asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n There were only two reasons why a man needed a surrogate. Firstly, his wife couldn\u2019t have children. Secondly, he didn\u2019t want to get married.\n As for the reasons why he didn\u2019t want to marry, there were two reasons. One was that he was a celibate, and the other was...\n Song Ci thought of a possibility and covered her mouth in shock. \u201cBrother Han, this Yan Rufeng and Han Chenyi can\u2019t be...\u201d Song Ci blurted out an English word softly.\n With that, seeing that Han Zhan really nodded in affirmation, Song Ci felt incredulous.\n \u201cHow exciting!\u201d\n Song Ci picked up her cell phone and said excitedly, \u201cI have to tell Su Beibei about this and get her to finish our novel, before writing another one with Han Chenyi\u2019s story.\u201d\n Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s hand and frowned. He asked in confusion, \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018our novel\u2019?\u201d\n Song Ci blinked and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that Su Beibei stopped writing mystery novels after she got pregnant? She used the two of us as the main characters and wrote about a domineering CEO and his little wife?\u201d\n Han Zhan was confused.\n Is this something a human should do?\n \u201cHas she posted it online? I\u2019ll go and take a look.\u201d Han Zhan was especially curious about what a novel with him and Song Ci as the main characters would be like.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI will send the link to your cell phone.\u201d\n After sending Han Zhan a link, Song Ci excitedly shared the story she heard tonight with Su Beibei.\n As expected, after hearing her story, Su Beibei immediately decided. \u201cJust wait. Your novel is about to end. I will try to write the story of Han Chenyi and the rest before giving birth!\u201d\n Song Ci was very satisfied. \u201cThen tell me after you publish it. I will go and make the list for you.\u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cOkay!\u201d\n After Song Ci got pregnant, she also developed the habit of sleeping and waking up early. Seeing that it was almost 10.30pm, Song Ci consciously turned off her cell phone and said to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, good night. I\u2019ll go to bed first.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan looked at his cell phone and answered without looking up.\n Song Ci laid down and saw that Han Zhan was focused on his cell phone. She asked him, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m reading a novel.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cThe one that Su Beibei wrote?\u201d\n \u201c...Mmm.\u201d As he spoke, Han Zhan opened a new chapter.\n \u201cIs it that interesting?\u201d\n Han Zhan was so engrossed that he didn\u2019t even want to speak to her.\n Song Ci fell asleep.\n In the middle of the night, Song Ci was awoken by the urge to pee. She opened her eyes and saw that there was a light on Han Zhan\u2019s side.\n Song Ci rubbed her eyes and looked over at Han Zhan. She realized that he was still reading the novel!\n Song Ci picked up her cell phone and looked at the time.\n It was 3am at night.\n A question mark slowly surfaced in Song Ci\u2019s mind. What happened to the big boss who slept and woke up early?\n Song Ci went to the toilet first. After returning to the bed, she snatched Han Zhan\u2019s cell phone away without a word.\n Han Zhan was already very sleepy. After his cell phone was taken away, he didn\u2019t intend to snatch it back.\n \u201cBrother Han, you used to be a good child who slept at 10pm.\u201d Song Ci locked Han Zhan\u2019s cell phone into the cupboard by the bed.\n As soon as she laid down, Han Zhan hugged her.\n Han Zhan closed his eyes and said, \u201cThis novel is going to make me die of laughter. It\u2019s filled with a thick sense of silliness. The words used in the novel are exaggerated, making one burst out laughing but also unable to resist chasing after it.\u201d\n \u201cHow can she be so talented?\u201d\n In the novel, Su Beibei had portrayed Han Zhan as a domineering CEO with a \u201cdemonic and wild\u201d character who could control the weather with just a twitch of his fingers. As for Song Ci, Su Beibei had portrayed her as a 34D woman with big breasts, a slender waist, and a sweet, mushy demoness.\n Han Zhan cursed in his heart as he read. He then continued reading.\n As if he was torturing himself.\n Song Ci said, \u201cExactly. I chase after her every day. I even ranked her on the charts.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled. \u201cA living treasure.\u201d\n The two of them chatted for a while before falling asleep.\n At 8.30am the next morning, a driver arrived at the villa and handed Zhong Buhui a gift box.\n Zhong Buhui entered the house with the gift box. Seeing that Song Ci was practicing the piano, he placed the gift box on the table and didn\u2019t disturb her.\n After Song Ci finished practicing, Zhong Buhui said, \u201cLass Song, just now, a driver helped a person called Yan Rufeng send a lighter over. Take a look.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci opened the box and saw the lighter. Her eyes lit up. She carried the lighter to the backyard and called Han Aoyu. \u201cGrandpa.\u201d\n Han Aoyu was wearing a hat and holding a small hoe, as he bent over to weed in the garden.\n Hearing Song Ci call him, Han Aoyu looked up and narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Song Ci?\u201d Seeing that Song Ci was dressed beautifully, he said, \u201cAre you going out?\u201d\n \u201cYes, it\u2019s Teacher Shen\u2019s birthday today. Brother Han and I are going to celebrate his birthday. We won\u2019t be back for lunch and dinner. You must take care of yourself and don\u2019t secretly drink.\u201d Song Ci had secretly caught Han Aoyu drinking several times.\n \u201cI\u2019m not drinking!\u201d His voice was loud and clear, but his eyes were slightly dreamy.\n Song Ci smiled helplessly. After entering the house, she instructed Zhong Buhui to watch Han Aoyu closely and not to allow him to drink, before she returned to her room to call Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan had stayed up late last night to read a novel and was too lazy to get up for his morning exercises. Song Ci pushed open the door and saw that there was no one on the bed. Instead, she heard water running in the bathroom.\n \u201cWhy are you bathing so early in the morning?\u201d After asking, Song Ci met Han Zhan\u2019s resentful eyes and finally understood something.\n Her eyes lit up as she asked Han Zhan in amusement, \u201cIt\u2019s so early in the morning and you\u2019re so hot-tempered, Brother Han.\u201d\n Han Zhan wiped his hair and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all Su Beibei\u2019s fault for portraying such a dirty novel. She even wrote something about a plane play. I was dreaming this morning when it was almost dawn.\u201d In his dreams, he did whatever he wanted to Song Ci on the plane.\n After waking up, Han Zhan could only take a shower.\n Song Ci walked over and hugged Han Zhan. She said beside his ear, \u201cIt\u2019s slightly late now. We have to go to Teacher\u2019s house. I will play with you tonight when we come back.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were dark and his breathing was slightly heavy.\n Only after using a lot of self-control did Han Zhan push Song Ci away heartlessly. \u201cHelp me pick out clothes. It\u2019s strangely hot today and I won\u2019t be wearing a suit.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Shen Yubei\u2019s birthday party was a family banquet and there were no outsiders around, so Han Zhan didn\u2019t need to wear formal clothes. Han Zhan liked to wear a Polo shirt, which was comfortable and loose.\n Song Ci walked into the cloakroom and chose a comfortable dark blue Polo shirt and a pair of grey suit pants for Han Zhan.\n The simplest design looked very manly on Han Zhan.\n Shen Yubei\u2019s house was located rather far away from the city. The two of them walked along the provincial road in the suburbs and didn\u2019t pass by the city. They only drove for 30 minutes, before reaching Shen Yubei\u2019s house.\n Han Zhan was parking the car, while Song Ci pressed the doorbell first.\n Ring...\n Song Ci pressed the doorbell and waited patiently.\n Han Zhan walked over with his car keys. Seeing that the door was not open, he asked her, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone opening the door?\u201d\n \u201cIs he not at home?\u201d\n Song Ci was about to press the doorbell again when the door opened from the inside.\n Shen Yubei personally opened the door.\n Today, Shen Yubei looked especially good. He was wearing a tight white short-sleeved shirt and a white silk blouse with lotus flowers printed on it. His long hair was tied into a bun and his clean face was slightly red.\n Song Ci thought that Shen Yubei was hot.\n She handed the present to Shen Yubei and congratulated him with a smile. \u201cTeacher, happy birthday!\u201d Shen Yubei was already in his forties or fifties, but because he was young, he looked as handsome and charismatic as a man in his thirties.\n He seemed slightly surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that you still remember my birthday.\u201d\n Song Ci suppressed her laughter and thought: If I really forgot, you would have chased me out of the house.\n In front of Song Ci, Shen Yubei opened the gift box.\n Seeing that it was a watch inside, Shen Yubei was disinterested. \u201cIt\u2019s a watch? Thank you.\u201d He was about to close the box when Song Ci hurriedly pressed his hand down. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a watch. It\u2019s a lighter!\u201d\n Hearing this, Shen Yubei\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cA lighter? I have never seen such a lighter. How do I light it?\u201d Shen Yubei was like a child who had just received a new toy. He was especially happy and his expression was pure and clean.\n Song Ci took out the watch-shaped lighter and put it on Shen Yubei\u2019s wrist.\n Shen Yubei asked her impatiently, \u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201d\n Song Ci pointed at the small hole on the surface of the dial. \u201cPush the button beside the dial and the flames will come out.\u201d With that, Song Ci pressed the time button beside the dial and a dark blue flame emerged from that hole.\n \u201cInteresting!\u201d Shen Yubei smiled radiantly. \u201cI like this gift.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cThis is a gift that Han Zhan found for you. He has good taste, right?\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows and smiled at Song Ci.\n Shen Yubei looked up and stared at Han Zhan for a few seconds, before looking down and saying, \u201cMmm, your taste is not bad. Your taste in choosing people and things is very good.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled and held Shen Yubei\u2019s hand. \u201cTeacher, I have also learned to cook now. I remember you like lotus-flavored pork ribs a lot. I will make it for you!\u201d\n Shen Yubei was slightly embarrassed. He said, \u201cMmm, okay...\u201d\n The three of them entered the house. The moment they entered the living room, Han Zhan heard someone singing in the kitchen.\n This song sounded strangely familiar.\n Han Zhan frowned as he looked into the kitchen and saw Di Rongrong.\n Di Rongrong was dressed like a peacock today. She was wearing a pink backless dress and had her hair draped over her shoulders. She was so perfect that she should have been standing on stage singing. But she was standing in the kitchen of Shen Yubei\u2019s house, holding a frying pan in one hand and a spatula in the other.\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Why is Godmother here?\n Di Rongrong smiled and turned to Shen Yubei. \u201cBeibei, was it the seafood that I ordered...\u201d\n Di Rongrong froze on the spot, when she saw her godson and god-daughter-in-law standing on each side of Shen Yubei. Recalling the coquettish tone she used when she spoke just now, Di Rongrong instantly blushed.\n Di Rongrong hurriedly threw away the spatula in her hand and turned off the stove. She turned around and lowered her head to wash her hands under the tap of the sink.\n She had embarrassed herself in front of her godson and was too ashamed to face anyone. She just wanted to throw herself into that frying pan to fry and cook.\n After a momentary daze, Song Ci finally snapped out of her trance. She smiled and said to Shen Yubei, \u201cTeacher, you even invited Rongrong\u2019s godmother over as a guest. Since you\u2019re having a party with your old friend, we juniors shouldn\u2019t participate.\u201d\n Song Ci tugged at Han Zhan\u2019s elbow and said, \u201cBrother Han, didn\u2019t we agree to go for a prenatal checkup with the doctor today? Shall we go over first?\u201d\n Han Zhan pretended not to hear Song Ci\u2019s words.\n Han Zhan took a deep breath and stared at the person in the kitchen. He said in a low voice, \u201cGodmother Rongrong, come out!\u201d\n Di Rongrong turned back as if she was facing death. She walked towards Han Zhan with tragic steps.\n Han Zhan stared at the fancy dress that was still slightly revealing on Di Rongrong\u2019s body and felt a surge of anger. \u201cFollow me.\u201d Han Zhan turned and walked out. Di Rongrong was like a child who had done something wrong and obediently followed behind Han Zhan.\n Song Ci saw that Shen Yubei was looking worriedly at Di Rongrong\u2019s back view. She touched her nose awkwardly and said, \u201cI am going to cook. Teacher, do you want to come with me?\u201d\n Shen Yubei acknowledged absent-mindedly.\n Shen Yubei seldom cooked and would occasionally make western food. His hands were fair and tender, and even washing vegetables felt like he had been wronged.\n Song Ci placed the ingredients that Di Rongrong had prepared into the pot. She stared at the steaming dishes and said, \u201cSo many years have passed and Godmother Rongrong is still as beautiful as ever.\u201d\n Shen Yubei placed the lettuce in the basket and said, \u201cSong Ci, are you slightly angry?\u201d\n Song Ci remained silent.\n Shen Yubei said, \u201cWe only started interacting recently. Nothing else happened between us.\u201d\n Song Ci heaved a sigh of relief.\n But immediately after, she frowned. \u201cTeacher.\u201d\n Song Ci turned off the fire and covered the dishes with the lid. Only then did she walk up to Shen Yubei.\n The two of them stood side by side. Song Ci tilted her head and looked at Shen Yubei. Thinking of how Shen Yubei had been in love with Di Rongrong for so many years and had never found another lover, Song Ci\u2019s heart ached slightly for Shen Yubei.\n Song Ci said earnestly, \u201cTeacher, Godmother Rongrong and Huo Jing-an are not divorced yet. You are now interfering in Godmother\u2019s marriage! Teacher, to put it nicely, you are pursuing true love. To put it bluntly, you are a mistress who is ruining someone else\u2019s marriage!\u201d\n Shen Yubei couldn\u2019t help but retort loudly. \u201cBut Huo Jing-an has already cheated with someone else. All these years, Rongrong has been living a strange life with him. They no longer have any feelings for each other.\u201d Shen Yubei lost his composure and his breathing became labored.\n Song Ci pointed out something sharply and calmly. \u201cBut she is still Mrs. Huo.\u201d\n Shen Yubei could not say anything more.\n Song Ci sighed. \u201cTeacher, you are so foolish!\u201d\n After a long while, Shen Yubei sighed hoarsely. \u201cIf you\u2019re not silly, it won\u2019t be called love.\u201d Loving someone was originally a muddle-headed, irrational, and uncontrollable thing.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t say anything else.\n They were both adults and Shen Yubei\u2019s experience and vision far exceeded Song Ci\u2019s. How could Shen Yubei not understand Song Ci\u2019s reasoning?\n He understood, but he was not rational. This was the helplessness of loving someone.\n \u2013\n Outside the house.\n There was an ancient tree outside the wall of Shen Yubei\u2019s house. Its branches stretched out and covered the sky.\n Han Zhan walked under that tree.\n The sunlight here was much weaker and the air was slightly chilly.\n Di Rongrong obediently followed behind Han Zhan. Seeing that Han Zhan stopped, Di Rongrong also stopped. As she walked, she was afraid of dirtying the sides of her skirt, so she always carried it.\n When Han Zhan turned back, Di Rongrong released the hem of her dress guiltily.\n She looked up guiltily and saw her godson\u2019s solemn expression. She knew that things were not looking good. Di Rongrong asked in a trembling voice, \u201cZhanzhan, are you angry?\u201d\n Not only was Zhanzhan angry, he was also furious!\n Han Zhan\u2019s gaze was solemn. He stared at Di Rongrong for a while before saying, \u201cI have to call Godmother Luolan and Godmother Mo Yao to let them wash your brains.\u201d\n Hearing this, Di Rongrong was shocked and hurriedly reached out to snatch Han Zhan\u2019s cell phone. As she did so, she shouted in a panic, \u201cZhanzhan, don\u2019t. I know my mistake!\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his cell phone high and didn\u2019t continue making the call, but also didn\u2019t put it back into his pocket. He looked down at Di Rongrong\u2019s flushed face and asked her, \u201cYou really know your mistake?\u201d\n Di Rongrong nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d\n \u201cTell me, what did you do wrong?\u201d\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have seduced Shen Yubei.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s brows twitched. \u201cYou seduced him?\u201d\n Han Zhan had always thought that Shen Yubei had seduced Di Rongrong. After all, Shen Yubei had liked her for too many years.\n Di Rongrong nodded uneasily.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t know what to say.\n \u201cIf you want to seduce him now, why didn\u2019t you do so earlier? That year, when he confessed to you, you didn\u2019t fancy him. Now that your marriage life is not satisfactory, you realize how good Shen Yubei is and turn back. Godmother Rongrong, I advise you to be a person.\u201d\n Di Rongrong was so ashamed that she couldn\u2019t lift her head. She said, \u201cI only discovered many of Huo Jing-an\u2019s flaws after we got married. We kept arguing and finally declared our relationship to be broken because he cheated on me. Huo Jing-an and I are no longer in love.\u201d\n \u201cZhanzhan, I didn\u2019t treat Shen Yubei as a spare tire. I just suddenly realized that he is so good. You don\u2019t know how adorable he is. He won\u2019t go overboard even if he blushed from my teasing. He is the cleanest and purest man I have ever met.\u201d\n \u201cI think I am attracted to him.\u201d\n It was funny. When she was young, Di Rongrong didn\u2019t fancy Shen Yubei and thought that he was naive, stubborn, and brainless. Unexpectedly, when she was middle-aged, she realized how good Shen Yubei was and actually shamelessly took the initiative to seduce him.\n Could this be considered as the wheel of fortune turning?\n Han Zhan was a cold-hearted person. After hearing Di Rongrong\u2019s heartfelt words, he was not moved by her \u2018true love theory\u2019.\n He said, \u201cGodmother, by doing this, you are going to consign Shen Yubei to eternal damnation!\u201d\n Di Rongrong was shocked. \u201cWhy would...\u201d\n \u201cWhy not? A world-renowned violinist fell in love with a married woman and became a mistress. Tell me, how will the outside world comment on Shen Yubei? Godmother Rongrong, you are harming Shen Yubei by doing this.\u201d\n Di Rongrong\u2019s eyes widened as they reddened slightly.\n \u201cI...\u201d Di Rongrong was speechless.\n Han Zhan saw that Di Rongrong was about to cry and couldn\u2019t bear to say more harsh words. He sighed silently in his heart and thought to himself: Why is this matter so worrisome?\n \u201cGodmother Rongrong, for you, Shen Yubei has never married or dated in his entire life. Compared to his love, your love is too insignificant.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s words were sharp and straightforward. Di Rongrong wanted to retort but couldn\u2019t find a way to.\n Yes, Shen Yubei was a dimwit. He liked someone for his entire life. If he couldn\u2019t get Di Rongrong, he would never get married or have children. This was a stubborn romance.\n If you really like him, you must show your determination and sincerity. Otherwise, your fondness for Teacher Shen will look like a joke.\u201d\n With that, Han Zhan refused to speak further and returned to the house.\n Shen Yubei saw Han Zhan enter the house. He hurriedly stood up and said to Han Zhan, \u201cYou scolded her?\u201d\n Han Zhan had mixed feelings.\n Shen Yubei really liked Godmother Rongrong!\n Han Zhan stood up straight and bowed deeply to Shen Yubei.\n Shen Yubei was stunned.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cTeacher Shen, Godmother Rongrong is foolish and does things based on her hot-headedness. These few days, Godmother Rongrong must have caused a lot of trouble for you, Teacher Shen. I apologize on her behalf. I\u2019ve already scolded her and she has already gone back.\u201d\n She went back?\n Shen Yubei was in a daze and didn\u2019t speak.\n She could come and go as she pleased. It had always been like this.\n Han Zhan knew that Shen Yubei had been utterly heartbroken by Godmother Rongrong. He added, \u201cTeacher Shen, why don\u2019t you give yourself a choice?\u201d\n Shen Yubei frowned slightly, not understanding what Han Zhan meant.\n Han Zhan said gently, \u201cGive yourself a choice. Tell yourself that if she can show her greatest sincerity and return to my side again, I will definitely let bygones be bygones and accept her confession. If she really leaves like this and never returns, that can only mean that her love is just a temporary play.\u201d\n In other words, if Di Rongrong really divorced Huo Jing-an for Shen Yubei and wooed him again, then she must have really fallen in love with Shen Yubei. If Di Rongrong didn\u2019t do anything after returning and just left like that, then she really wasn\u2019t worthy of Shen Yubei\u2019s lifelong love.\n After Shen Yubei understood Han Zhan\u2019s meaning, he didn\u2019t speak again.\n Outside the door, Di Rongrong was standing under the door. Hearing Han Zhan and Shen Yubei\u2019s conversation, she stopped in her tracks.\n Han Zhan\u2019s words were both for Shen Yubei and her.\n From the corner of his eye, Han Zhan saw that the pink figure at the door had turned and fled, but he pretended not to see it.\n This lunch was dull.\n After lunch, Shen Yubei sent Song Ci and Han Zhan away.\n After sending them off, Shen Yubei went to the top floor alone. He closed the curtains of the French window, hid in the dark room alone, and played the violin for the entire afternoon.\n Musicians could convey their feelings through their own instruments.\n Hearing Shen Yubei\u2019s music today, the butler knew that Sir must be feeling very flustered. He couldn\u2019t help sighing.\n ...\n The Huo Family was in charge of politics and Huo Jing-an was also respected in Wangdong City.\n He and Di Rongrong had been married for 22 years, but their blissful marriage had only lasted for two years before it was destroyed by an unforeseen event. After that, Huo Jing-an had secretly kept a lover outside. The lover was an actress with a gorgeous face that Di Rongrong couldn\u2019t compare to.\n But that face was somewhat similar to Di Rongrong\u2019s.\n Di Rongrong\u2019s parents were both revolutionary singers. She was also a Chinese female high note singer and a top actor in the country. She sang national music and was as ordinary as a celebrity on a variety show on the Spring Festival Gala.\n Di Rongrong was very famous in the country. She was also a singer who had once held a solo concert at the Golden Hall in Vienna.\n Di Rongrong had a positive image and a good family background. Although her relationship with Di Rongrong was broken, due to the two families, her image, and her career, Huo Jing-an and Di Rongrong had maintained a married relationship for so many years and never divorced.\n Huo Jing-an also thought that they would be husband and wife forever.\n But on this day, after he got off work and returned to his secret lover\u2019s villa, the two of them had just spent some time together and were still sweating profusely, when he unexpectedly received a call from Di Rongrong.\n \u201cHuo Jing-an, come back to the Huo Family. I have something to tell you.\u201d\n Di Rongrong seldom called Huo Jing-an. Huo Jing-an was surprised for a few seconds before getting out of bed, putting on his clothes, and preparing to go home.\n Little Sweetheart was slightly displeased to see that he was going home. \u201cYou\u2019re going back?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cThat woman managed to get you back with just a casual call, yet you said you doted on me.\u201d Little Sweetheart was jealous and her tone was filled with jealousy.\n Huo Jing-an was used to pretending to be himself and knew how to hide his emotions the best. He was angry, but Little Sweetheart didn\u2019t notice and even complained softly. \u201cYou promised to accompany me tonight. You have been so busy recently. I miss you so much.\u201d\n Huo Jing-an stared at her coldly and said, \u201cHave you forgotten that you are the third party and Rongrong is my wife? If you are the third party, you should do your part. Shouldn\u2019t I go back if she calls me?\u201d\n Huo Jing-an was a total jerk.\n Little Sweetheart was speechless.\n Since Huo Jing-an was angry, Little Sweetheart didn\u2019t dare to say anything else.\n Huo Jing-an drove home. Seeing that the house was brightly lit, he suddenly stopped the car. Sitting in the car, Huo Jing-an looked at this big house, and his eyelids twitched inexplicably.\n The phone rang again.\n Huo Jing\u2019an took out his cell phone and saw that it was a call from Di Rongrong. Huo Jing\u2019an answered the call and heard Di Rongrong say, \u201cCome in, what are you doing in the car?\u201d\n Huo Jingan alighted and extinguished the cigarette in his hand. Just as he was about to enter the house, he remembered that Di Rongrong didn\u2019t like the smell of cigarettes. He returned to the car and found an unopened bottle of chewing gum.\n In this year, this was the first time Di Rongrong had taken the initiative to call him. His chewing gum was about to expire before he could use it.\n Huo Jing-an quickly chewed on a few chewing gum before entering the house with steady footsteps.\n There were no servants in the main hall. As soon as Huo Jing-an entered the house, he saw Di Rongrong. Tonight, Di Rongrong was wearing a black halter dress and had put on makeup. Sitting under the chandelier, she was breathtakingly beautiful.\n Huo Jing-an suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked at her in a daze. So many years had passed and Di Rongrong was still the same as when she was young. She was breathtaking at first, but she still tingled his heart after a long time.\n Hearing this, Di Rongrong turned and glanced at Huo Jing-an coldly. She said calmly, \u201cSit, let\u2019s have a chat.\u201d\n The way Di Rongrong that looked at him was like he was a stranger, and it pained Huo Jing-an\u2019s heart. Before losing that child, she had also looked at him with love and admiration.\n Huo Jing-an walked step by step to the sofa and sat down. He saw a document on the coffee table. Huo Jing-an saw the black words \u201cDivorce Agreement\u201d on the paper and frowned.\n \u201cHuo Jing-an, I haven\u2019t troubled you in so many years. I have to make an exception today.\u201d Di Rongrong tossed him a pen and said calmly, \u201cMay I trouble you to please sign this?\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "217": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-218\n\n Chapter 217: You Want Your Empire and He Wants Me  Di Rongrong said, \u201cPlease sign.\u201d\n Hearing this, a dark cloud suddenly gathered in Huo Jing-an\u2019s eyes. A storm flashed across them, but the pair of eyes seemed to lose their temper and instantly softened, when they matched with Di Rongrong eyes that appeared as if they had seen through everything.\n \u201cWhy did you suddenly decide to get a divorce?\u201d His deep voice sounded very calm and steady.\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cI hated you so much back then because of the child\u2019s death. All these years, I\u2019ve never been willing to divorce you. Actually, I\u2019m not angry at you. I\u2019m angry at myself.\u201d\n Hearing Di Rongrong mention that child, Huo Jing-an\u2019s pupils quivered slightly.\n All these years, she had never mentioned that child. Did she really let go of all that pain and decided to abandon me suddenly by mentioning this sad past?\n Huo Jing-an felt very upset, as if he was about to lose the love of his life.\n Di Rongrong bent over and wrote her own name on the divorce agreement. As she wrote, she said, \u201cNow, I have decided to let myself off.\u201d She pushed the paper and pen in front of Huo Jing-an. Looking into Huo Jing-an\u2019s unfathomable eyes, Di Rongrong told him, \u201cHuo Jing-an, I will also let you off.\u201d\n Huo Jing-an could hear his own heart breaking.\n His fingers were trembling as he held his pen, unable to write down his name.\n Gazing at Di Rongrong\u2019s fair and beautiful face, Huo Jing-an suddenly asked in a small voice, \u201cRongrong, if Ruoruo hadn\u2019t been murdered because of me back then, would we have ended up like this?\u201d\n Hearing that little angel\u2019s name again, Di Rongrong\u2019s eyes reddened. She looked up at the dazzling chandelier and said hoarsely, \u201cThere are no ifs.\u201d\n Huo Jing-an\u2019s hands were trembling.\n His thoughts uncontrollably drifted back to 20 years ago...\n Wangdong City belonged to Mo\u2019an Province and was the provincial capital of it. In Mo\u2019an Province, other than Wangdong City, there were several other cities. Among them, Wei\u2019an City was steeper and had less soil. That summer 20 years ago, a rainstorm fell on Wei\u2019an City. The city area of Wei\u2019an City was flooded and mudslides happened in many villages. Hundreds of villagers were buried.\n It was a heart-wrenching natural disaster. At that time, the leaders of Weian City were dismissed, because they were unable to guide the rescue team after the disaster, so Huo Jing-an was ordered to go to Weian City to guide the team.\n Huo Jing-an, who was in the midst of a rapid rise in his career, spent all day and night at the disaster site guiding the reconstruction work. As a result, he neglected his family.\n At that time, Di Rongrong was still in confinement after giving birth.\n Knowing that Huo Jing-an was trying to save the country and the people, and knowing that he was working very hard, Di Rongrong also behaved very considerately. She was alone at home during her confinement period and had a nanny to help her cook, so she was not tired at all.\n But Huo Jing-an had too many enemies. He was at the front line directing the reconstruction of the disaster, but his enemies had secretly entered his house and kidnapped Di Rongrong and their child.\n The enemy asked Di Rongrong to call Huo Jing-an and get her to pass on a request: As long as Huo Jing-an was willing to resign and promise never to enter the government again, they would let Di Rongrong and their daughter Ruoruo off.\n But Huo Jing-an was very busy and didn\u2019t have the time to answer the call.\n Di Rongrong made five consecutive calls and Huo Jing-an finally picked up. But he didn\u2019t give her a chance to speak and told her, \u201cI have a leader inspecting my work here. Rongrong, I will call you tonight.\u201d\n Then, Huo Jing-an called.\n Di Rongrong waited for Huo Jing-an\u2019s call for 10 hours. The next morning, Huo Jing-an didn\u2019t return her call. He was so busy that he had long forgotten his promise to Di Rongrong that afternoon...\n By the time the Huo Family found Di Rongrong, she was already at her last breath. At that time, she was still carrying her dead and stiff daughter. Luckily, the medical team was capable enough to save Di Rongrong\u2019s life.\n When Huo Jing-an hurried back to Wangdong City and went to the hospital, he saw Di Rongrong\u2019s lifeless eyes and blamed himself bitterly. He knelt down in front of Di Rongrong\u2019s bed, slapped himself in tears, confessed in tears, and begged for her forgiveness.\n But Di Rongrong never looked at Huo Jing-an again.\n From then on, this loving couple became strangers.\n Huo Jing\u2019an looked at Di Rongrong and saw that her eyes were filled with tears. Thinking of their daughter, Huo Jing\u2019an couldn\u2019t help but tear up.\n He hesitated for a long time before suddenly slamming the pen on the table. He said hoarsely, \u201cRongrong, I\u2019ve let you and your daughter down.\u201d\n Di Rongrong looked up at the ceiling and ignored Huo Jing-an\u2019s apology.\n Huo Jing-an wanted to reach out and touch Di Rongrong\u2019s face, but halfway through, he retracted his hand, as if he had been scalded by magma.\n Huo Jing-an swallowed several times before asking humbly, \u201cCan we not get a divorce?\u201d\n Only then did Di Rongrong lower her head and look at Huo Jing-an coldly.\n \u201cNo.\u201d Di Rongrong was determined.\n Huo Jing-an couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cCan you tell me why you suddenly decided to get a divorce? It has been so many years and now you suddenly want a divorce. Why...\u201d\n Di Rongrong spoke up and interrupted Huo Jing-an gently. \u201cI have someone I like.\u201d\n Hearing this, Huo Jing-an felt like he had been struck by lightning.\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cI want to pursue him cleanly and innocently.\u201d\n The muscles on Huo Jing-an\u2019s face were trembling. He clenched his fists tightly and used a lot of self-control to suppress his anger and jealousy. He gritted his teeth and asked word by word, \u201cWho is it? Who is that man?!\u201d\n Di Rongrong knew that Huo Jing-an was angry, but she didn\u2019t understand what he was angry about.\n Di Rongrong said in a puzzled tone, \u201cWhy are you so angry? Anyway, our marriage is already in name only. Divorce will be a relief for both of us. Once we are divorced, you can bring your little lover into the Huo Family. I can naturally look for my Prince Charming.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m asking you, who is that person?\u201d Huo Jing-an only wanted to know the answer.\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cShen Yubei.\u201d\n Huo Jing-an suddenly stood up.\n \u201cShen Yubei!\u201d Huo Jing-an gritted his teeth, wishing he could crush these three words. He was so angry that his body was trembling slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you fell in love with Shen Yubei?\u201d He felt that it was ridiculous, as if he had been hit in the head.\n Di Rongrong frowned as she watched Huo Jing-an go crazy. She remained silent.\n \u201cDi Rongrong, are you trying to anger me?! Of all the people you can look for, why did you look for that inflexible, old-fashioned person!\u201d Huo Jing-an pursued fame and fortune, and yearned to be above others. He especially looked down on artists like Shen Yubei, who pursued art wholeheartedly and pretended to be noble and stubborn.\n Shen Yubei was five years younger than Huo Jing-an and two years younger than Di Rongrong. That guy was involved in music and spoke in a gentle manner, so Huo Jing-an always felt that Shen Yubei was a pretentious prick.\n That year, when Huo Jing-an was wooing Di Rongrong, Shen Yubei was like a fly. Shen Yubei would buzz wherever Huo Jing-an and Di Rongrong went. Luckily, Di Rongrong chose Huo Jing-an later on, which made Huo Jing-an feel proud and elated.\n After they got married, Huo Jing-an had also seen Shen Yubei, who was dressed like a fairy and looked like he could immediately ascend to immortality on the spot. He couldn\u2019t help mocking Shen Yubei.\n Huo Jing-an mocked Shen Yubei for being a loser in relationships.\n Meanwhile, Shen Yubei never retorted.\n It was only after Ruoruo\u2019s death that Huo Jing-an\u2019s character became much more restrained. When he saw Shen Yubei again, he didn\u2019t have the face to act high and mighty in front of Shen Yubei. Meanwhile, Shen Yubei also felt that his eyes were dirty, because Huo Jing-an had let down Di Rongrong and her daughter.\n If one were to ask who Huo Jing-an hated the most in his life, Shen Yubei would definitely be the person who ranked first.\n That year when he married Di Rongrong, Huo Jing-an had laughed wildly and arrogantly. But he didn\u2019t expect that he wasn\u2019t the one who had the last laugh. In the end, Shen Yubei still stole Di Rongrong\u2019s heart.\n Huo Jing-an was indignant.\n His eyes reddened as he asked Di Rongrong sternly, \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about Shen Yubei? That year, you already despised him for not being manly and looked down on him. Why do you have feelings for him now?\u201d\n Di Rongrong was not afraid of Huo Jing-an at all. She looked straight at him calmly and said nonchalantly, \u201cYes, he is indeed not as manly as you, not as domineering and overbearing as you, and doesn\u2019t have a shocking family background like yours, but he has me in his heart and his eyes are filled with me. His eyes light up the moment I appear.\u201d\n Di Rongrong stared at Huo Jing-an mockingly. She said, \u201cI am just a little woman. I just want to find a man whose heart is filled with me. Huo Jing-an, do you know the biggest difference between you and Shen Yubei?\u201d\n Huo Jing-an looked at her in shock. His lips moved but he couldn\u2019t speak.\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cYou want the empire, he wants Di Rongrong.\u201d\n Huo Jing-an was stunned.\n \u201cI\u2019ve already missed him for 22 years. I can\u2019t miss the rest of his life. Huo Jing-an, sign it. Don\u2019t delay my pursuit of my partner.\u201d Di Rongrong picked up that pen. She stood up, forcefully pried open Huo Jing-an\u2019s right hand, and stuffed the pen into his palm.\n Huo Jing-an\u2019s face was as red as a tomato, and he wanted to throw the pen away.\n Di Rongrong stared at Huo Jing-an\u2019s struggling right hand and suddenly sighed.\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cHuo Jing-an, why are you still struggling? I don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d\n Huo Jing-an\u2019s expression was very ugly. He stopped struggling and looked at Di Rongrong\u2019s cold and heartless face with his hurt eyes.\n Di Rongrong wrapped her arms around Huo Jing-an\u2019s hand and pulled it towards the divorce agreement. Under Di Rongrong\u2019s pressure, the tip of her black pen swayed as she wrote the word \u201cHuo\u201d on the paper.\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything. I don\u2019t want your fortune, your house, or all your unmovable assets.\u201d\n Huo Jing-an was still struggling, but Di Rongrongxia\u2019s next sentence completely made Huo Jing-an lose the strength to struggle.\n She said, \u201cI just want to take off my identity as Mrs. Huo.\u201d\n Huo Jing-an\u2019s entire body was drained by Di Rongrong\u2019s words. He allowed her to hold his hand and write the words \u201cHuo Jing-an\u201d on the divorce agreement.\n Di Rongrong kept the divorce agreement and placed them in her bag. She held her bag, glanced at the despondent Huo Jing-an, and took out her wedding ring.\n It was a purple gem ring that was six carats big. Huo Jing-an had spent some effort to get this ring back then.\n Di Rongrong placed the ring in Huo Jing-an\u2019s hand. She said, \u201cGo and sell it. With the money it costs, you can also buy an expensive set of jewelry for your little lover.\u201d\n With that, Di Rongrong carried her bag and walked out of the Huo Family residence on her heels.\n From then on, there would be no Mrs. Huo in this world.\n \u2013\n The night was dark and Shen Yubei seemed to hear the sound of wheels spinning.\n He opened his eyes and listened intently. He really heard the sound of tires.\n Shen Yubei sat up and got out of bed. He walked to the window and glanced at the door. He saw a car parked under his tree.\n Recognizing that it was Di Rongrong\u2019s car, Shen Yubei suddenly clenched the marble by the window.\n His breathing quickened and his heartbeat started beating rapidly in disbelief.\n Di Rongrong sat in the car for a while, before pushing open the door and striding over to the main entrance of the Shen Family residence. Di Rongrong stood at the entrance of Shen Yubei\u2019s house. Seeing that the Shen Family residence was pitch black, she crossed her arms and sat down on the gravel steps in front of the main entrance.\n At night, there were many mosquitoes and there were many trees around the Shen Family.\n Di Rongrong was bitten several times very quickly. She killed several mosquitoes and those mosquitoes left a few drops of blood on her pink dress, which looked like a cinnabar mole.\n Di Rongrong was about to lose her temper from being bitten by mosquitoes. At this moment, the door to the Shen Family behind her was suddenly pulled open.\n Di Rongrong froze and she suddenly stopped moving.\n Shen Yubei\u2019s voice sounded from behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s so late at night. What is Mrs. Huo trying to do?\u201d\n Di Rongrong slowly turned around and saw Shen Yubei standing behind her.\n He was wearing a white pyjamas and holding a handmade lantern. As it was long since he slept, his hair was draped over his shoulders, making him look like a painting.\n Di Rongrong slowly stood up. She grabbed her itchy arms, lowered her head, opened her bag, took out a document, and handed it to Shen Yubei. \u201cShen Yubei, from now on, my name is Di Rongrong.\u201d\n Shen Yubei was slightly stunned.\n His eyes changed several times, before he looked down and raised the lantern in his hand to see the words on the document clearly.\n Divorce agreement.\n It was as if millions of ants were crawling in Shen Yubei\u2019s throat. Shen Yubei didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t know what to say. He only knew that his heart was beating wildly, like soybeans sprinkled on a drum. It was dancing very joyfully.\n As Shen Yubei remained silent, Di Rongrong started to panic.\n She kept the divorce agreement and pretended to be calm and elegant. \u201cI just came to visit you. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d As Di Rongrong turned around, her wrist was suddenly grabbed by someone.\n he hand that held her was slightly cold, but the owner of this pair of cold hands had a passionate heart.\n Di Rongrong looked up at Shen Yubei and remained silent.\n Shen Yubei said, \u201cWhere can you go?\u201d\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cI...\u201d\n \u201cYour house is at Shunchen. Now that you and Huo Jing-an are divorced, do you still have anywhere to go?\u201d Di Rongrong didn\u2019t have a house outside, but had an apartment at Shunchen\u2019s side, which she had used all her money to invest in it.\n Di Rongrong could only go to the hotel.\n But at this point, she couldn\u2019t possibly say that she could go to the hotel.\n Di Rongrong walked down the slope with a pitiful expression. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I can go either. I can stay at Luolan\u2019s for the night...\u201d\n \u201cStay.\u201d\n Shen Yubei pulled her into the courtyard and turned to close the door.\n Afraid that he would regret it, Di Rongrong hurriedly took a few steps into the courtyard, stood behind Shen Yubei, and stared at him as he closed the door. Shen Yubei turned around with the lantern in hand. Seeing Di Rongrong\u2019s pitiful expression, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a guest bedroom on the second floor. I\u2019ll go make your bed.\u201d\n \u201cSorry to disturb you.\u201d\n Di Rongrong and Shen Yubei laid out the bedsheets together.\n Shen Yubei brought over a new set of toiletries that was specially made for men. \u201cThere are no females in the house. I prepared this set for myself. Make do with it.\u201d\n Di Rongrong took the wash towel and daily necessities.\n Shen Yubei gave her a meaningful look. Suppressing his ecstatic heart, he pretended to be cold and said goodnight to her. As Shen Yubei turned to leave, Di Rongrong grabbed his clothes again.\n \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Shen Yubei didn\u2019t turn back. His back was facing Di Rongrong.\n Di Rongrong bit her pink lips with her pearly white teeth. She was embarrassed but had no choice but to speak. She asked Shen Yubei, \u201cShen Yubei, can you lend me one of your pyjamas?\u201d\n Shen Yubei:!\n He said, \u201cI\u2019ll go get it.\u201d\n When Shen Yubei left Di Rongrong\u2019s room, he did it while walking with the same hand and same leg.\n He brought over a set of pyjamas. It was a silk set with long sleeves and pants. The room was air-conditioned, so it was not hot wearing long sleeves. Shen Yubei placed the pyjamas in a bag and hung it on the doorknob of Di Rongrong\u2019s room.\n \u201cThe pyjamas are hanging on the door lock. Come and get them yourself.\u201d Shen Yubei stood at the door for a while more before saying, \u201cGood night.\u201d\n Shen Yubei returned to his own room and was about to close the door, when he heard the door to the room next door open.\n Shen Yubei stared at the black doorknob and blinked gently.\n He laid in bed and heard the buzzing of insects outside the house. He felt slightly restless. What kind of beautiful scenery would Di Rongrong be wearing my pyjamas? Shen Yubei didn\u2019t know if the scenery was beautiful, but his heart burned.\n The butler woke up the next morning and cleaned the first floor with the servants. The servants started cooking, while the butler went upstairs to wake Shen Yubei up.\n Shen Yubei was going to attend a television program recording today. He had to leave for the airport after breakfast and couldn\u2019t be late. The butler walked up the stairs and saw a white figure on the corridor on the second floor.\n The butler didn\u2019t think much of it. He opened his mouth and said, \u201cSir, you are already up...\u201d As he spoke, the butler saw the person\u2019s face clearly and realized that it was a petite and curvy woman.\n She was wearing Sir\u2019s pyjamas. In addition, no woman had ever stayed over in this house, so the butler instinctively thought that this person was Sir.\n The butler stared at Di Rongrong\u2019s well-maintained face. Not only did she not look old, she looked very charming. He took a deep breath.\n \u201cMrs...\u201d The butler instinctively wanted to call Di Rongrong Madam Huo, but he was a smart person. In Sir\u2019s house, at the door to his master bedroom, he definitely couldn\u2019t call Di Rongrong Mrs Huo!\n The butler corrected himself. \u201cMadam Di, you are awake? Do you want to have Chinese breakfast or Western breakfast?\u201d\n As expected of the butler, he could remain calm no matter what absurd things he encountered.\n Di Rongrong blushed and said softly, \u201cI will eat whatever Shen Yubei eats.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I understand.\u201d\n The butler couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly happened between Di Rongrong and Shen Yubei last night. He thought that Di Rongrong had come out of Shen Yubei\u2019s room and was afraid that he would see something blinding if he went in. He said to Di Rongrong, \u201cPlease wake Sir up, Madam Di. Tell him that he should get up for breakfast and set off for the airport.\u201d\n Di Rongrong asked, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t performed recently, right?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a notice for work . A month ago, Sir promised to be a guest on a variety show. The show will start at 1pm today and we can\u2019t be late. Sorry to trouble you, Madam Di.\u201d With that, the butler quietly turned and went downstairs.\n Di Rongrong looked at Shen Yubei\u2019s door and couldn\u2019t help laughing.\n She could have just explained to the butler that she and Shen Yubei had slept separately last night, but the butler had misunderstood and Di Rongrong had allowed it to happen. She couldn\u2019t wait for the entire world to misunderstand.\n Di Rongrong stood at the door and thought: The butler asked me to wake Shen Yubei up on his behalf. I didn\u2019t barge in on my own accord.\n Thinking of this, Di Rongrong felt very confident and pushed open the door.\n Shen Yubei\u2019s house was renovated into a wood forest style. In his master bedroom, there was a simple wooden bed made of wood. The bed frame was bent into a natural shape and every bedpost was as thick as her calf.\n When Shen Yubei was sleeping, his posture was surprisingly adorable. His hands were obediently placed in front of his chest, his mouth slightly open as he snored softly.\n Di Rongrong stood by the bed and stared at Shen Yubei for a while, before reaching out to push him away.\n Shen Yubei thought it was the butler. He covered his head and face with a thin blanket and said, \u201cDon\u2019t wake me up. Sleep for another five minutes.\u201d\n Di Rongrong said, \u201cYou will be late if you continue sleeping.\u201d\n Shen Yubei realized that something was off.\n He pulled down the thin blanket and opened his eyes to see Di Rongrong\u2019s face. Shen Yubei blinked, suppressed the various emotions in his heart, sat up very calmly, and said, \u201cWhy are you in my room?\u201d\n Di Rongrong answered honestly, \u201cThe butler asked me to wake you up.\u201d\n Shen Yubei had just woken up and was still in a daze when he heard Di Rongrong say, \u201cHe thought we slept together last night.\u201d\n Shen Yubei blushed slightly.\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019m getting up.\u201d\n Shen Yubei entered the toilet to brush his teeth. As he brushed his teeth, he even secretly sized Di Rongrong up. Although Shen Yubei was not fat, a man\u2019s frame was naturally wider than a woman\u2019s. Shen Yubei\u2019s tight-fitting clothes looked wide on Di Rongrong.\n Di Rongrong\u2019s waist was very thin and Shen Yubei\u2019s pajama pants were wider. They looked like they were going to fall off her body, and Di Rongrong kept pulling them.\n Shen Yubei didn\u2019t dare to look further. He would react if he did.\n After breakfast, Di Rongrong got up and bid farewell. Before leaving, she purposely left her pair of earrings at Shen Yubei\u2019s house. If I didn\u2019t forget something, how could I have any reason to visit again?\n After Di Rongrong left, the servants went upstairs to tidy up the room.\n ]A moment later, the servant came down with a pair of exquisite lady earrings. She walked up to Shen Yubei and said, \u201cMr. Shen, Madam Di\u2019s earrings are on the bedside table.\u201d\n Shen Yubei said, \u201cPut it here.\u201d\n The servant placed that pair of earrings beside Shen Yubei.\n When Shen Yubei went upstairs to change clothes, he conveniently took that pair of earrings.\n Walking to the door of the master bedroom, Shen Yubei stopped in his tracks. He took out the earrings from his pocket, thought for a moment, walked into the guest room, and placed them on the bedside table.\n It was as if those earrings had always been there and had never been discovered.\n ...\n \u201cSong Song, how about this dress? I think it suits you very well.\u201d Aaron chose a peach pink long dress. The loose hem was very suitable for pregnant women, especially for six to seven months pregnant mothers like Song Ci.\n Song Ci was used to wearing vibrant reds and purples. She suddenly hesitated in the face of such a pink and tender dress. \u201cMy skin seems to have dimmed slightly recently. This color is probably not easy to pull off.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s all an illusion!\u201d Aaron stared at Song Ci\u2019s fair and beautiful face. He said, \u201cYour skin condition is very good. You\u2019ve gained some weight recently. Put your curly hair down and use your fringe to hide your face shape, and you\u2019ll be the most beautiful pregnant mother.\u201d\n Song Ci also knew that she had gained weight, but she was carrying two children and didn\u2019t dare to diet. She could only consider losing weight after giving birth.\n \u201cLet me try.\u201d\n Aaron called his female assistant to follow Song Ci into the changing room.\n As she was changing clothes, the female assistant noticed a hickey on Song Ci\u2019s back. She thought to herself: Mr. Han and Mrs. Han are really close. They are still so passionate even when she\u2019s pregnant.\n Last night, during their passion, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t resist leaving some marks on Song Ci\u2019s back. Han Zhan especially liked the feeling of Song Ci wearing beautiful clothes but his marks were hidden on her fair skin under her clothes.\n Just the thought of it made his entire body go numb and his body feel satisfied.\n As for Song Ci, she had long forgotten about Han Zhan\u2019s actions last night and didn\u2019t know that there were marks on her back. If she knew, she wouldn\u2019t have asked for help.\n After changing into the dress, Song Ci walked up to the mirror and sized it up. Seeing that she still looked pretty good in this dress, she said to Aaron, \u201cI will wear this tomorrow night.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Aaron stared at Song Ci for a few seconds and suddenly asked her, \u201cSong Song, do you have those exaggerated earrings? It\u2019d better be dark purple or blue.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYes, Han Zhan gave me a set of sapphire jewelry today.\u201d Song Ci had taken a photo of that set of jewelry previously and handed it to Aaron for him to take a look. Aaron said, \u201cThis is it. It\u2019s quite suitable.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, okay. I will come to your house tomorrow afternoon to put on makeup for you.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d\n Song Ci left Aaron\u2019s studio and called Song Fei. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cThe archery hall.\u201d\n Song Fei would go to the Internet Surveillance Bureau every Tuesday and Friday to teach them. On other days, she would usually either be at the archery center or at home.\n \u201cI\u2019ll go look for you.\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Okay.\u201d\n Song Ci drove to the AK Arrows Center and saw Song Fei practicing archery. Song Ci walked over and took down a composite bow. She pulled the bowstring and tested the strength, before taking the quiver and walking towards Song Fei.\n Song Fei took off her hat and turned to Song Ci. \u201cShall we have a match?\u201d\n Song Ci shrugged. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that I will torture you?\u201d\n Song Fei sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re only good at archery and violin.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cIt\u2019s enough to torture you.\u201d\n Song Fei raised her brows.\n She said, \u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201d\n Song Fei casually shot an arrow that hit the seventh ring. Song Fei pointed at the hole and said, \u201cIt has been so many years. Let me see if your archery skills have deteriorated.\u201d\n Song Ci held the bow in her left hand and the arrow in her right. She drew the bow, aimed, and fired!\n Swish!\n Song Fei narrowed her eyes and saw that the arrow that had shot out of Song Ci\u2019s hand had pierced through the hole she had just opened.\n Song Fei nodded and applauded. \u201cNot bad. You should have listened to Father\u2019s advice and participated in the archery competition at the Olympics. Why did you give up?\u201d Song Ci\u2019s results were not good, but she had inherited her mother\u2019s artistic talent and her father\u2019s archery talent.\n Meanwhile, Song Fei had inherited Song Chengyun\u2019s high IQ.\n Song Ci said, \u201cMother said that the violin is her dream that she couldn\u2019t fulfill. I want to fulfill Mother\u2019s dream.\u201d\n It had been a long time since she last practiced archery, so Song Ci\u2019s wrist was slightly numb from just one arrow. \u201cAfter I have given birth and recover my strength, I will fight you seriously.\u201d\n Song Fei nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d\n Song Ci placed the bow and quiver back.\n She sat on the sofa for a while. After Song Fei finished practicing her archery, she walked over to the small chair beside her and sat down.\n Song Fei crossed her legs, tore open a packet of candy, and popped it into her mouth. \u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cThere will be an auction tomorrow night. You will be very interested in something.\u201d\n Song Fei frowned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n \u201cA jade fox.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in jewelry.\u201d She was uninterested and closed her eyes to eat the candy.\n Song Ci told her, \u201cAt my wedding the previous time, I handed the Chinese medical notebook that Father had compiled to treat infertility to Han Zhan\u2019s godmother. His godmother Mo Yao has been infertile for many years. I feel that the notebook that Father had compiled can be of some help to her.\u201d\n Song Fei still had her eyes closed. She said, \u201cThat notebook is very valuable. When Mo Yao recovers, remember to take it back. Let your Han Zhan open a pharmaceutical company to specially develop medicine for infertility. It will definitely make money.\u201d\n Song Fei was realistic. Everything depended on money.\n Song Ci thought for a moment and felt that Song Fei\u2019s suggestion was not bad. \u201cNow that you mention it, I also feel that this is a way to make money. I will remember to take the notebook back next time.\u201d This was not what Song Ci wanted to tell Song Fei.\n \u201cWhen Godmother Mo Yao received this notebook, she asked my father if he was from the Mo Family. At that time, I felt it was strange. Later on, I asked Han Zhan about the Mo Family. Han Zhan told me that the Mo Family is a legendary Traditional Chinese Medicine family. With the Godly Doctor Mo Nanfeng holding the fort, they are the number one medical family in the world.\u201d\n Song Fei listened to Song Ci\u2019s explanation and finally felt slightly interested. She said, \u201cSong Tingyun was indeed a fake name by Father. I found out Father\u2019s original name was Mo Yibei.\u201d\n Song Fei and Song Ci exchanged glances, their eyes dark.\n Could Mo Yibei really be from the Mo Family?\n Song Ci added. \u201cAfter that, I went to look for Godmother Mo Yao and asked her about the Mo Family. Godmother Mo Yao doesn\u2019t know much about the Mo Family. She only knows that every five years, the Mo Family will release 200 jade foxes to the outside world. Those who have jade foxes can go to the Mo Family to take the examinations. After layers of strict tests, the final 10 people who win can enter the Mo Family to learn Traditional Chinese Medicine.\u201d\n Song Ci leaned close to Song Fei\u2019s ear and said in a low voice, \u201cThe current president of the Chinese Medical Association has studied at the Mo Family for three years.\u201d\n Song Fei pressed her hands together as her knuckles cracked.\n Can you get me another invitation to the auction?\u201d After asking, without waiting for Song Ci to answer, Song Fei added, \u201cIf you can\u2019t, I can only fake it myself.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Song Ci said, \u201cOf course.\u201d She looked at Song Fei worriedly, like an old father who cared for his child. \u201cSong Fei, we can\u2019t do anything illegal.\u201d\n Song Fei replied, \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci felt that Song Fei was just bullshitting.\n \u201cSee you tomorrow night then.\u201d Thinking of something, Song Ci didn\u2019t forget to remind Song Fei. \u201cThe auction requires you to wear a gown. It might not be a dress, but it must be a gown. Your sweater will never do.\u201d\n Song Fei looked down at her Ke Da duck short-sleeved sweater and felt slightly indignant. \u201cKe Da duck is so cute.\u201d\n \u201cSee if they let you in then.\u201d\n Song Ci got up and left, and Song Fei was in a difficult position.\n She didn\u2019t have a gown.\n Song Fei took out her cell phone and sent Yan Jiang a message. \u201cMan, it\u2019s time for you to perform.\u201d\n Yan Jiang replied with a question mark.\n Song Fei said, \u201cBuy me a gown.\u201d\n Yan Jiang slowly typed out an ellipsis.\n \u2013\n Song Ci went straight to Han Zhan\u2019s office in the afternoon, planning to play in his office for half a day before returning home with him at night.\n In the six months after Zeus Corporation was established, Han Zhan had been busy. Even if Song Ci went to the company, Han Zhan didn\u2019t have the time to accompany her. He was busy with meetings, answering phones, and welcoming overseas partners.\n Song Ci was good at finding fun for herself.\n Recently, for some reason, she had been obsessed with dubbing for radio dramas. She had accepted two screenplays specially for those coquettish female supporting roles. Song Ci sat on the sofa and read the script for dubbing, occasionally practicing on the spot.\n Outside Han Zhan\u2019s office was a wide and long corridor. In the middle of the corridor was a spacious open office. His assistants and the CEO\u2019s secretary were all working in this office.\n Next to the secretary\u2019s office were all sorts of meeting rooms.\n Han Zhan\u2019s office was very soundproof. Song Ci was not afraid of being overheard. She leaned against the sofa, held the script in her left hand, and spoke in a seductive and provocative voice. \u201cSister, you still don\u2019t know, right? I\u2019ve already slept in your and Wei Sheng\u2019s master bedroom several times. Not only have I slept in your bed, I\u2019ve also slept in your husband\u2019s!\u201d\n With that, Song Ci jumped to the next sentence. \u201cSister, you owe me all this! Wei Sheng is my boyfriend. You are the shameless one who snatched my love just because you are the daughter of the Su Family Group!\u201d\n \u201cLet me tell you, not only do I want to sleep with your husband and your bed, I also want your son to call me mother!\u201d\n Han Zhan returned to the office after the meeting and pushed open the office door. He heard Song Ci speaking in a sarcastic manner that only a vicious supporting actress deserved. Han Zhan shuddered and hurried over to snatch Song Ci\u2019s script.\n Song Ci was engrossed in her practice when the script was gone.\n She glared back and saw Han Zhan\u2019s face. Her brows immediately relaxed and she smiled. \u201cBrother Han, are you done with the meeting?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan flipped through the script of the radio drama in his hand and read a few lines from Song Ci. His head was filled with black lines. \u201cYou still have two little ones in your tummy. It\u2019s better to watch less of such unethical things.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to make a sound after being scolded.\n Han Zhan was right, but she still had to do the voice acting after the scolding.\n Han Zhan threw the notebook on the desk and asked Song Ci, \u201cPreviously, you said on the phone that you wanted to discuss the money-making avenue with me in detail. What do you mean?\u201d When he said the words \u201cmoney-making avenue\u201d, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t conceal the smile in his eyes.\n Song Ci told Han Zhan about Song Fei\u2019s idea.\n Han Zhan pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cIs Father-in-law\u2019s notebook really that effective?\u201d\n Song Ci looked very proud. She boasted. \u201cMy father was very famous in the Cai Family Village back then. All the women in the city went for him to take their pulses.\u201d\n \u201cIf Godmother can really get pregnant, then this matter can indeed be considered.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n The children were starting to kick her. Song Ci felt uncomfortable standing there, so she walked to the sofa and sat down. Han Zhan saw that she was massaging her stomach and knew that the children were kicking her again.\n Han Zhan walked over and sat beside Song Ci. He hugged her stomach and pressed his face against it.\n The little guy was very strong. He kicked a small bulge and Han Zhan\u2019s face collapsed. He smiled.\n \u201cI think it\u2019s the elder sister who kicked me.\u201d Through his connections, Han Zhan had already found out the gender of the two children. They were a pair of daughters and this made Han Zhan, as a man, slightly afraid.\n He had never brought up a little kid before, especially soft and adorable little princesses. He was slightly scared and looked forward to it.\n Song Ci said, \u201cPerhaps our little sister is even more mischievous.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s also possible. You can watch a movie or read a book. I still have something to do. I will get off work early today and will bring you to eat stone-pot fish tonight. Don\u2019t you want to eat that?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u2013\n At noon the next day, Aaron personally came to the villa to help Song Ci put on makeup.\n Although Aaron liked to make orchid-shaped fingers and looked like a little sissy, he also put on a suit in all seriousness and combed his hair neatly, when he knew that he was about to meet Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather.\n Arriving at the villa, Aaron started coaxing Han Aoyu. \u201cOld Master, you are so fortunate. You have two great-grandchildren in your arms, one on the left and one on the right. Everyone would have to praise you for your good fortune?\u201d\n Han Aoyu was all smiles. He felt that this young man had a glib tongue. When Aaron finished styling Song Ci and left, Han Aoyu even gave Aaron half a bottle of his precious wine.\n Aaron carried that wine into the car like Bodhisattva.\n At 5pm in the afternoon, Long Yu drove over to fetch Song Ci. They first went to the office to meet Han Zhan before going to the auction together.\n The auction tonight was very grand. The organizer was the number one luxury jewelry brand in the country, \u201cWedding for Love\u201d. He heard that the boss of \u201cWedding for Love\u201d jewelry brand, President Qiao, would also be present tonight. Han Zhan wanted to befriend him, so he specially moved aside his work to accompany Song Ci to the auction.\n They arrived at the main entrance of the hotel where the auction was held and waited for a while, before Yan Jiang and Song Fei arrived.\n Tonight, Song Fei and Yan Jiang were wearing couple outfits. Yan Jiang was wearing a white suit and Song Fei was wearing a black suit. The same design and different colors made them feel like their gender was reversed.\n \u201cHave you waited long?\u201d Yan Jiang asked Song Ci.\n Song Ci shook her head. She tiptoed and whispered into Yan Jiang\u2019s ear. \u201cI thought Song Fei would wear a dress.\u201d\n Yan Jiang shook his head regretfully. \u201cAh Fei said it\u2019s not convenient to wear a dress and can\u2019t use it.\u201d\n Unable to use it? Song Ci felt uneasy. \u201cWhat is she going to do?\u201d\n Yan Jiang touched his nose and said worriedly, \u201cI feel like she\u2019s going to rob someone.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s jaw dropped.\n After entering the auction hall, Song Ci tugged at Song Fei and said softly, \u201cSong Fei, did you bring money tonight?\u201d\n Song Fei shook her head. \u201cNo money.\u201d Song Fei was very poor.\n Song Ci asked her, \u201cThen how are you going to buy that jade fox?\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s gaze swept across the guests at the venue. Her answer was rather profound. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t have it, but others do.\u201d As long as the jade fox left this auction, who could say who would win in the end?\n Song Ci gasped. \u201cSong Fei, you are not allowed to cause trouble for me.\u201d\n Song Fei reached out her hand. \u201cLend me some money then.\u201d\n Song Ci clutched her handbag and asked her, \u201cWhen are you returning it?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cAfter your elder sister defeats all her competitors and returns from the Mo Family Medical Company to earn money, she will definitely return your money.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n I would probably have to wait until the end of time.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "218": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-219\n\n Chapter 218: Do You Hate Father?  Song Fei saw that Song Ci was silent and thought to herself that sisterhood was just so-so.\n \u201cWhy? You\u2019re not willing to lend it to me?\u201d Song Fei sneered. \u201cThat\u2019s how much you love me.\u201d\n Song Ci felt guilty and said softly, \u201cI don\u2019t have much money...\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cYour man is rich.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYan Jiang is also rich.\u201d\n \u201cI have hands and feet. Why should I use men\u2019s money!\u201d Song Fei was very burdened as an elder sister.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyelids twitched at her words. She rolled her eyes and retorted. \u201cYou have hands and feet, so you can\u2019t use a man\u2019s money. Did I lose my limbs?\u201d Song Ci glared at Song Fei fiercely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use Brother Han\u2019s money either.\u201d\n Song Fei sneered and told her, \u201cYou two are married. The marriage certificate states that your assets are shared. It\u2019s only right for you to use his money.\u201d\n Song Fei added. \u201cMoreover, I am not the only one involved in the matters of the Mo Family. Father is our common father. Since you want to investigate his relationship with the Mo Family, there is no reason for me to do this alone. You don\u2019t have the money or the strength to do so. Do you really think you are the wife of the richest man?\u201d\n Song Fei was usually a woman of few words, but she had a sharp tongue.\n Song Ci was in the wrong. She took out the bank card that she had prepared long ago and said, \u201cThere\u2019s 6 million yuan in here. It\u2019s the money that Liang Bo gave me and the endorsement fee that I earned for the airline. Song Fei, I\u2019ll give you the money. Don\u2019t cause trouble for me.\u201d\n Song Ci was constantly worried that Song Fei would commit a crime.\n Song Fei snatched the card away and placed the bank card into her own pocket without any reservations. She even asked Song Ci, \u201cIf you already prepared it, why didn\u2019t you take it out earlier?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a huge sum. I can\u2019t bear to part with it.\u201d Song Ci looked at the outline of the bank card in Song Fei\u2019s pants pocket, her heart bleeding.\n Song Fei was amused by Song Ci\u2019s pitiful gaze. She lifted her right hand and hugged Song Ci\u2019s arm. Like a jerk coaxing his girlfriend, she coaxed Song Ci. \u201cLittle fool, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely return the money to you.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t believe her at all. She was in the field of virus research and couldn\u2019t earn much money in her entire life. Song Ci had no intention of taking this money back.\n As Song Fei had said, it was not Song Fei\u2019s sole responsibility to investigate the matter between her father and the Mo Family. As Song Tingyun\u2019s daughter, Song Ci had the same obligation. It was only right for her to fork out money and help Song Fei.\n Han Zhan was in high demand now and would be surrounded wherever he went. Only when he saw Song Ci beside Song Fei did he feel at ease and started chatting with other people.\n After Yan Jiang entered the main hall, he saw many colleagues and good friends in the entertainment circles, and he was also pulled over to reminisce. The two sisters got a moment of silence, sat down on the sofa, opened the auction book, and started reading.\n \u201cSong Ci.\u201d Su Huanyan\u2019s gentle and clear voice sounded from behind Song Ci.\n Song Ci turned and saw a beautiful pregnant woman standing behind her. Su Huanyan\u2019s abdomen had also bulged and it didn\u2019t even fit her in a cheongsam. Today, Su Huanyan had abandoned her cheongsam and was wearing a cream-colored dress. The skirt was very wide and covered her pregnancy.\n \u201cHuanyan, come and sit here.\u201d Song Ci patted the empty seat beside her.\n Hearing the name Huanyan, Song Fei looked up at Su Huanyan and nodded coldly, before lowering her head and continued flipping through the book.\n Su Huanyan was handsome in a suit.\n After sitting down beside Song Ci, Su Huanyan secretly whispered into her ear. \u201cSong Ci, is this your elder sister, Song Fei? How magical. You two clearly look alike, but wearing different styles of clothes, you have two different temperaments.\u201d\n Song Ci asked in amusement, \u201cTell me, what is my aura and what is Song Fei\u2019s?\u201d\n Su Huanyan said, \u201cYou are noble and magnanimous.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled with narrowed eyes.\n Su Huanyan glanced at Song Fei and said even more softly, \u201cYour elder sister is a bandit and domineering.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s a good summary.\u201d Song Ci suppressed her laughter and nudged Song Fei\u2019s arm. \u201cCan you be more elegant in your sitting position? You\u2019re not demure at all.\u201d\n Song Fei was chewing on a piece of candy. She was wearing a black suit and a pair of black diamond-studded high heels. She sat on the sofa with her legs crossed and lifted her chin slightly to look at the brochure, just like that domineering CEO. She was indeed unladylike.\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Song Fei took it as she was bullshitting. A thousand people had all sorts of good looks, figure, and mannerism. She wanted to be that most unique woman.\n Song Ci and Su Huanyan were both girls of the same type and couldn\u2019t resist the allure of beautiful accessories. The two of them chattered about which set of accessories looked better and which pair of earrings suited the dress.\n [fuzzy]Song Fei was disinterested.\n She lifted her head and looked over at Yan Jiang. She saw a lady almost pressing herself against him. Song Fei got up, picked up her drink, and walked over step by step.\n There were a total of three people standing beside Yan Jiang. Two men and one woman. The men were all actors. They were all old friends who had worked with Yan Jiang in his famous work many years ago.\n At that time, they were still young and didn\u2019t understand the rules of the entertainment circles, so the friendship built then was rather pure. In addition, Yan Jiang\u2019s character was one to do whatever he wanted and he wasn\u2019t pretentious or pretentious. Everyone liked his true character.\n So many years had passed and they had maintained a good relationship. Every year, they would meet a few times, have a gathering, have a meal, and sing. When they met at parties, they would inevitably hold Yan Jiang back to reminisce about the past.\n Meanwhile, that tall girl wearing a dark purple tube dress was a famous model in the country who had shot fashion magazines with Yan Jiang.\n This lady had wooed Yan Jiang before, but Yan Jiang only had eyes for Song Fei and rejected her.\n What Song Fei saw just now happened to be that lady leaning close to Yan Jiang and asking, \u201cBrother Jiang, I heard that you are in a relationship. Did you bring your girlfriend?\u201d\n Yan Jiang instinctively took a step back and poked the girl\u2019s arm. He reminded her. \u201cWatch your distance when you speak. I\u2019m already engaged. If you get too close, you will be misunderstood.\u201d\n Hearing this, the girl looked slightly embarrassed.\n The two old friends pitied the female model when they saw how ruthless Yan Jiang was.\n The actor called Wei Lai asked Yan Jiang, \u201cOh yes, the last time you were interviewed, you publicly admitted that you\u2019ve been wooing Song Fei for many years. You said that you were engaged, but you didn\u2019t bring your fianc\u00e9e over?\u201d\n It was Yan Jiang\u2019s first time attending such a public event with Song Fei. He couldn\u2019t wait for everyone to know that he and Song Fei were a couple. \u201cShe\u2019s here too.\u201d\n Yan Jiang looked up at Song Fei\u2019s seat.\n Glancing over, he saw Song Fei get up and walk over. Yan Jiang nodded at her. \u201cThat\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\n Wei Lai and the female models turned around at the same time and looked in Song Fei\u2019s direction. They saw a girl wearing a white halter top and a black suit walking over.\n That girl\u2019s waist was not a waist but a deadly knife. It was thin and fair and no one dared to look at it.\n The girl was beautiful, but her eyes were as cold as spring water. She was obviously not someone to be trifled with.\n The actor called Zhong Xiangshou saw Song Fei\u2019s good looks and winked at Yan Jiang. \u201cYour fianc\u00e9e is very valiant.\u201d\n Yan Jiang gave a faint smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my little ancestor.\u201d\n Song Fei walked up to them and stared straight at the female model beside Yan Jiang with narrowed eyes.\n Glancing at the female model coldly, Song Fei walked up to Yan Jiang, raised her right hand, and gently patted Yan Jiang\u2019s right arm, as if cleaning up a virus, disgusted and filled with detest.\n There was no dust there. It was just swept by the female model\u2019s hair.\n Knowing that Song Fei must be angry, Yan Jiang was overjoyed. He maintained his expression and introduced Song Fei and her two friends. \u201cAh Fei, this is Wei Lai and Zhong Xiangshou. They are my friends in the circle.\u201d\n When it was time to introduce the girl, Yan Jiang\u2019s smile faded as he said coldly, \u201cThis is Mi Qi\u2019er, a female colleague whom I have worked with in the past.\u201d\n Song Fei greeted Wei Lai and the rest with a nod. She then glanced at Michele nonchalantly. She didn\u2019t react at all, as if she was looking at thin air.\n From the time Song Fei patted Yan Jiang\u2019s sleeves, Mi Qi\u2019er\u2019s expression had been very ugly. Now that she was once again ignored by Song Fei, no matter how thick-skinned Mi Qi\u2019er was, she couldn\u2019t stay any longer. She found an excuse and fled.\n Wei Lai and Zhong Shou exchanged excited glances.\n They could tell that the god of bar, Yan Jiang, had found a tyrant, Song Fei.\n One carrot and one pit. They were quite compatible.\n Wei Lai and the rest chatted with Yan Jiang and Song Fei. For Yan Jiang\u2019s sake, Song Fei was rather polite and kind to them. After the two of them left, Song Fei stared at Yan Jiang with an unreadable expression. \u201cBe more sensible in the future and don\u2019t fool around. Your body is mine. Don\u2019t let anyone touch you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was very happy.\n Song Fei looked so adorable when she was jealous.\n He hurriedly explained his innocence. \u201cI have nothing to do with her. She is greedy for my beauty and male body. As for me, I am only greedy for you.\u201d\n Song Fei snorted.\n Mushy!\n Song Fei said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s time to take a seat.\u201d With that, Song Fei strode forward. From behind, her ears looked red and translucent.\n Yan Jiang stared at Song Fei\u2019s ears with dark eyes.\n I want to bite them.\n He pinched his protruding collarbone, before following Song Fei to the venue.\n \u2013\n Above their heads was the chandelier shaped like a planet, and the crystal lights were dazzling. Men and women sat under the light, talking in low voices about tonight\u2019s auction.\n After the auction officially started, a tall, handsome man walked onto the stage.\n He had a pair of mesmerizing brown eyes and looked very gentle when he looked at people. Without a script, the man said, \u201cWelcome guests to the annual charity auction for Love. I am the boss of Love\u2019s Corona Jewelry brand, Qiao Sen.\u201d Boss Qiao\u2019s voice was also very pleasant.\n Qiao Sen came from Binjiang City. His status in Binjiang City was the same as Cheng Yanmo\u2019s status in Wangdong City. After he finished his self-introduction, the guests all gave him a round of applause.\n Song Ci applauded as she said to Han Zhan, \u201cThis President Qiao is rather handsome.\u201d\n Han Zhan told her, \u201cThis President Qiao already has a wife. Stop dreaming.\u201d\n Song Ci was wronged. She rolled her eyes at Han Zhan reproachfully, her eyes full of grievance. \u201cWhat are you saying, Brother Han? My heart is completely filled by you. How can I tolerate others?\u201d\n Han Zhan knew that she loved to joke around. Hearing this, he just smiled and didn\u2019t say anything else.\n After Qiao Sen finished his speech, he walked off the stage and sat in the middle of the first row. The host of the auction went on stage leisurely. Under her dainty mouth, every item seemed to have been given life and a legendary story, becoming precious and unique.\n The salesperson\u2019s mouth was frightening. Under the incitement of the host\u2019s glib tongue, the guests were like injected with stimulants as they scrambled to bid.\n Song Ci sighed. \u201cThere are so many rich people.\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows but remained silent.\n \u201cThe next item up for auction is Jade Carving Master Erza\u2019s new work, Lotus Harvest.\u201d The emcee walked up with a treasure in both hands. The emcee pulled open the cloth to reveal the jade carving inside.\n It was a jade carving. On a pure black stone plate stood a dragonfly lotus-picking statue. The lotus flower and even the petite dragonfly were carved to be very lifelike.\n The big screen displayed the details of this work. All the guests present were moved when they saw it.\n The host first explained the jade statue\u2019s selection and carving techniques to everyone before introducing the owner.\n \u201cThere is no need to mention Master Erza\u2019s fame in the jade carving industry. Every year, she will take out her most satisfactory work as a charity auction. Her work is also the most sought after treasure by jade enthusiasts in recent years. \u2018Lotus Picking Painting\u2019 will be auctioned at 500,000 yuan. The highest bidder will get it!\u201d\n Not only was Erza a jade sculptor, she was also the sister of the organizer tonight, Mr. Qiao Sen, the young mistress of the Fang Family, a wealthy family in Binjiang City. The guests were willing to bid for it not only because of the collection value of this piece, but also because they wanted to be friends with Qiao Sen and be connected to the young mistress of the Fang Family.\n Song Ci recognized Erza. They had met at several fashion parties, but they were a few years apart in age and had different social circles, so their relationship was average.\n Song Ci tilted her head and said to Han Zhan, \u201cHow about we buy this? It looks pretty good. I don\u2019t see any accessories on your desk. This is quite suitable.\u201d\n Han Zhan liked the jade\u2019s color and shape quite a bit, so he said, \u201cBuy.\u201d It was fine if Han Zhan didn\u2019t make a move, but once he did, the item would definitely be his. In the end, Han Zhan bid for the \u2018lotus\u2019 at 4 million yuan.\n After that, they bid for another gemstone necklace for Mo Yao and didn\u2019t attack again.\n From the start of the auction, Song Fei had never made a bid. She felt bored and even took out her cell phone to play Miracle Nuan Nuan. This thing had cost her tens of thousands of yuan. Song Fei swore to be Miracle Nuan\u2019s number one paywall player.\n Instead, Yan Jiang saw that one of the dark green bracelets was very beautiful and bid for it, planning to give it to Song Fei.\n Halfway through the auction, Han Qingshen finally arrived. She and Qiao Sen were old friends. Han Qingshen arrived at the venue and sat right beside Qiao Sen.\n Song Ci saw Han Qingshen\u2019s figure and asked Han Zhan, \u201cHan Qingshen is already here. Why isn\u2019t Manager Bei here?\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s working overtime to entertain Fox and the rest on my behalf.\u201d As Han Zhan was coming to attend the auction, Bei Zhan had no choice but to entertain the inspectors from England on Han Zhan\u2019s behalf.\n Song Ci pitied Bei Zhan slightly.\n Han Qingshen was very considerate of Qiao Sen. She sat down for less than 15 minutes and bid for two items. After bidding, she didn\u2019t raise her card again but lowered her head to discuss something with Qiao Sen. These two people probably treated the auction as a business meeting.\n After a few more minutes, that jade fox was finally placed on the table.\n The so-called jade fox was actually not a jade artifact but a small object carved from red agate. Due to the bright color and the jade-like glow, it was called a jade fox.\n The workmanship of that jade fox was rather exquisite, but it was not the work of a famous jewelry master. The material was also just ordinary onyx and the guests were not interested in it.\n The host introduced. \u201cThis is a fox carved from onyx. It comes from Chuandong District. This red fox improves endocrine and enhances blood circulation. Wearing it for a long time will be very beneficial to the body.\u201d\n Probably knowing that this thing was trash, the auction price set by the organizer was not high. It was only 10,000 yuan.\n Song Ci raised her card. \u201c50,000 yuan.\u201d\n Song Ci thought that no one would compete with her for this thing, but she heard a male voice ring out from the west side of the seats. \u201c100,000 yuan.\u201d It was a young man\u2019s voice in the midst of his puberty, slightly hoarse.\n Everyone thought: Is he stupid to buy such a thing for 100,000 yuan?\n Everyone looked towards the west curiously and recognized that this young man was the young master of Wangdong City\u2019s medical family, the Long Family. They all felt strange. Is this thing really that good? Is it worth the young master of the Long Family fighting with Zeus International\u2019s lady boss?\n Song Ci also looked at that youth.\n eeing Song Ci look over, the young master of the Long Family blushed. He mouthed to Song Ci. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n Song Ci felt very tired.\n This little guy used to run behind her and declare that he would marry her when he grew up.\n The love of youth was bullshit.\n Song Ci continued to raise her card. \u201c200,000 yuan.\u201d\n he young man added calmly, \u201c300,000 yuan.\u201d The Long Family had doctors, both Chinese and Western doctors, as well as people who concoct medicine and sell medicine. The young man was determined to get this agate fox.\n Song Ci got into a fight with the young man. The two of them continued to raise the price without batting an eyelid. They chased each other and actually raised the price of that useless thing to 2 million yuan.\n Song Ci wanted to give up.\n It was not worth it to spend millions on such a lousy thing. She couldn\u2019t help thinking about the probability of successfully snatching the red fox after knocking Young Master Long unconscious.\n Seeing that Song Ci had given up and was about to give up, Young Master Long heaved a sigh of relief.\n But before she could finish speaking, a woman in a black suit who looked 90% like Song Ci raised her bid. \u201c2.5 million!\u201d\n Young Master Long was enraged.\n Where did this jinx come from?\n Little Young Master Long was about to raise his card to continue bidding when his cell phone suddenly vibrated. Little Young Master opened his cell phone and saw that his good friend had sent a message asking for help.\n Brother Kun: [Long Long, I got into an accident!]\n his Brother Kun was the young master\u2019s best friend. Brother Kun would only reach adulthood next month, but he had already secretly been racing for a year and a half. Young Master Long had advised him several times to stop playing such dangerous games, but Brother Kun refused to listen.\n Look, something happened!\n After receiving this message, the young master didn\u2019t have any doubts. He stood up and left, not wanting that fox anymore.\n Everyone was stunned to see Little Master suddenly stand up and leave.\n Did he leave in a huff?\n A child was still a child, and he had poor tolerance.\n Little Young Master Long had taken the initiative to give up, so that agate fox naturally fell into Song Fei\u2019s hands.\n \u2013\n Little Young Master Long was called Long Gaogao, as in \u2018tall tall\u2019 in Chinese. This name was like a game.\n Long Gaogao ran out of the venue in one breath. He took out his cell phone and called Brother Kun as he walked towards the underground carpark. The call didn\u2019t go through and Long Gao thought that Brother Kun had fainted from his injuries.\n He was burning with anxiety.\n After boarding the car, Long Gaogao called Brother Kun again. This time, the call went through.\n Brother Kun answered the call and asked Long Gaogao in a loud voice, \u201cLong Long, what are you doing? Your brother is singing at the KTV. Are you coming?\u201d\n Long Gao was speechless.\n \u201cDidn\u2019t you get into a car accident?\u201d Long Gao gritted his teeth with a dark expression.\n Brother Kun was stunned. \u201cCar accident?\u201d\n Brother Kun looked at his bad friends and hung up. He video-called Long Gaogao on WeChat. Long Gaogao accepted the video and saw the energetic Brother Kun. He instantly knew that he had been fooled!\n Who could have controlled Brother Kun\u2019s WeChat to send me a message at that time?\n \u201cWho knows your WeChat password?\u201d Long Gao questioned Brother Kun.\n Brother Kun was confused but still answered obediently, \u201cYou.\u201d\n Long Gao hung up angrily.\n He threw his cell phone hard on the empty seat beside him and scolded. \u201cDamn hacker, screw me! I will catch you and throw you into the smelly ditch to feed the rats!\u201d\n At the venue, Song Fei suddenly sneezed.\n Yan Jiang asked her, \u201cIs the temperature too low?\u201d\n Song Fei rubbed her nose and said self-awarely, \u201cNo, someone is scolding me.\u201d\n Yan Jiang thought Song Fei was joking.\n Seeing that Song Ci and Han Zhan were standing behind them, Yan Jiang turned and asked them, \u201cSong Song, Mr. Han, are you going back now or later?\u201d\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan instead, \u201cBrother Han, are we leaving?\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at the time. It was 9.40pm. Pregnant women were always hungry. Han Zhan looked down and asked Song Ci, \u201cAre you hungry? If you are, let\u2019s go for supper.\u201d\n Song Ci salivated at the mention of supper.\n \u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d Song Ci asked Yan Jiang, \u201cBrother Jiang, is the barbeque restaurant we frequented still open?\u201d\n \u201cYes, let\u2019s go together?\u201d Yan Jiang was also slightly hungry.\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n The four of them walked out of the venue and walked through the corridor towards the lift entrance.\n As they were about to reach the lift, they met Han Qingshen. It was quieter here and Han Qingshen was leaning against the wall of the corridor, answering a call. Not far away, Song Ci heard Han Qingshen say, \u201cUncle Yan, have you arrived?\u201d\n Not knowing what the person on the other end said, Han Qingshen said, \u201cI will come down to look for you guys now.\u201d\n Han Qingshen hung up and looked up to see Song Ci and the rest. Han Qingshen and Han Zhan naturally recognized each other. She had also spoken to Yan Jiang at the movie awards party.\n They were all familiar faces. Han Qingshen asked them first, \u201cAre you not going to stay for a while more?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cSong Ci is tired, so we\u2019ll get going first. Sister-in-law, do you need me to call Bei Zhan to pick you up?\u201d\n Han Qingshen snorted and looked at Han Zhan without any warmth in her eyes. \u201cAs a boss, you\u2019re quite good at exploiting your subordinates. You came here to be carefree and left Bei Zhan alone in the company to be a slave!\u201d\n Han Qingshen\u2019s heart ached for Bei Zhan.\n She really wanted to capture Bei Zhan and make him a beautiful cage at home so that he could be her canary.\n But Bei Zhan didn\u2019t want to be a canary. He just wanted to be the Great King Kong.\n Song Ci thought that Han Zhan would feel guilty, but Han Zhan was too thick-skinned. After hearing Han Qingshen\u2019s accusation, he actually gave Han Qingshen a suggestion in all seriousness. He said, \u201cSister-in-law, you can acquire Zeus Corporation and let Bei Zhan be the CEO. I will be the assistant manager.\u201d\n \u201cI, Han Zhan, will definitely do my best if my boss has any instructions!\u201d\n Han Qingshen was speechless.\n If she could acquire Zeus Corporation, wouldn\u2019t she have done so long ago? But Zeus Corporation was a tough nut to crack. She couldn\u2019t chew it even if she wanted to.\n Han Qingshen sneered and walked away.\n Song Fei, who had been listening to the entire conversation, looked up and stared at Han Zhan with a faint smile. \u201cBrother-in-law has a vicious tongue.\u201d\n Brother-in-law Han dared to offend Han Qing, but didn\u2019t dare to offend Song Fei, so he pretended to be deaf.\n The four of them followed Han Qingshen into the lift. In the lift, Han Qingshen asked Song Ci, \u201cWhen are you giving birth, Song Ci?\u201d\n Song Ci respected Han Qingshen very much. After all, this woman was definitely a capable person to be able to hold the position of the CEO of the Empire Entertainment. Song Ci replied to Han Qingshen, \u201cThere\u2019s still more than three months left. It should be the end of the winter month.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s four years younger than our Little Treasure. I heard from Bei Zhan that they are a pair of daughters?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, I\u2019ve checked. They are indeed a pair of daughters.\u201d\n [fuzzy]\u201dCongratulations.\u201d\n As they spoke, the lift reached the first level. Han Qingshen turned and asked Yan Jiang, \u201cYour car is also parked outside?\u201d\n \u201cYes, in District B.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go together then.\u201d\n The five of them parked their cars in the parking lot of District B. They walked out from the left side of the restaurant. From afar, Song Ci saw a man standing in front of a Bentley.\n The man shouldn\u2019t be young anymore. There were a few faint wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. But those wrinkles didn\u2019t make him look old. Instead, they gave off a unique aura, like mellow wine that was fragrant the longer it was.\n The man was carrying a little girl. It was Bei Xiaobao.\n The August night of the lunar calendar was not very hot. Bei Xiaobao was wearing a bubble sleeve dress and his long hair was tied into a pair of small braids.\n Hearing footsteps, Bei Xiaobao looked up. Seeing Han Qingshen, Bei Xiaobao\u2019s round eyes suddenly lit up. She opened her arms and called sweetly, \u201cMother!\u201d\n Only after Yan Rufeng saw Han Qingshen did he put Bei Xiaobao down on the ground. Bei Xiaobao twisted her little butt and rushed over to Han Qingshen. Her movements were quick like a small cannonball.\n Bei Xiaobao hugged Han Qingshen\u2019s leg and looked up with a smile. \u201cMother, Little Grandpa and I have been waiting for you for a long time. Are you still bringing me to eat taro balls?\u201d\n Bei Xiaobao loved taro noodles. Han Qingshen had promised her the day before yesterday that she would bring her to her favorite beverage shop to eat taro noodles tonight.\n Han Qingshen looked skinny but easily carried the thirty-odd pound Bei Xiaobao. She stroked her nose and said, \u201cOf course I am going. Mommy is here now.\u201d\n Bei Xiaobao was overjoyed. She hurriedly turned to Yan Rufeng behind her and said, \u201cLittle Grandpa, Mother promised to bring me to eat taro balls. I\u2019ll give you two.\u201d\n Yan Rufeng remained silent and just stared blankly at Han Qingshen\u2019s back.\n To be precise, Yan Rufeng was looking at Yan Jiang, who was beside Song Fei.\n Under the night sky, Yan Jiang\u2019s white suit was very eye-catching. He was young and handsome. This made Yan Rufeng feel like he had traveled through time to see himself when he was young. In the blink of an eye, so many years had passed.\n Staring at Yan Rufeng, Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes were filled with uncertainty. So the director of Empire Entertainment was Yan Rufeng.\n No matter how many years had passed, Yan Jiang would never forget Yan Rufeng\u2019s face and his person.\n The person in front of him was the source of Yan Jiang\u2019s pain.\n Although Yan Rufeng was the director of the Empire Entertainment, he seldom appeared in public. He was low-key and mysterious and only lived in the rumors. Yan Jiang had also heard some things about Director Yan and knew that the CEO of the Empire Entertainment, Han Qingshen, was actually raised by Director Yan.\n He also knew that Director Yan had such an outrageous relationship with the founder of Empire Entertainment, Han Chenyi.\n Yan Jiang knew a lot about the Empire Entertainment\u2019s Director Yan, but he didn\u2019t know that Director Yan was called Yan Rufeng!\n Han Qingshen noticed Yan Rufeng\u2019s abnormality and asked in surprise, \u201cUncle Yan, what\u2019s the matter? Is there anyone you know here?\u201d Han Qingshen turned around and looked at Han Zhan and the rest.\n Upon seeing Yan Jiang, Han Qingshen thought of something and her expression changed slightly.\n Yan Rufeng, Yan Jiang...\n Han Qingshen was stunned by her own guess.\n Yan Rufeng walked up to Han Qing\u2019s side and looked at Yan Jiang calmly. After a long while, Yan Rufeng said, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up, Jiang Jiang.\u201d\n Han Qingshen widened her eyes slightly.\n Is Yan Jiang really that child?\n Hearing Yan Rufeng\u2019s words, Yan Jiang shot him an unfamiliar and disdainful look. Yan Jiang said coldly, \u201cWho are you? Do we know each other?\u201d\n Yan Rufeng could hear the hatred and deep resentment in the young man\u2019s words. Yan Rufeng frowned slightly and asked Yan Jiang, \u201cDo you hate Father?\u201d\n Father!\n Everyone except Yan Jiang changed their expressions.\n Song Fei sized up Yan Rufeng\u2019s face. It was very difficult to associate him with that uncle in casual clothes who always had a gloomy look on his face. Song Ci no longer remembered Yan Jiang\u2019s father\u2019s face, so hearing Yan Rufeng\u2019s words, she only felt that it was absurd and ridiculous.\n Are you kidding me?\n Yan Rufeng is actually Ah Jiang\u2019s father?\n Didn\u2019t they say that after Yan Rufeng eloped with that person, he left Wangdong City and disappeared without a trace?\n \u201cFather...\u201d Yan Jiang wasn\u2019t calling Yan Rufeng. Instead, he was playing with the word\u201d father \u201c.\n In other people\u2019s eyes, a father and a child should be one of the most intimate relationships in this world. But in Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes, a father was a disgusting term.\n \u201cSir, are you mistaken? My father has been dead for 14 years and the grass on his grave is already 30 feet tall.\u201d Yan Jiang pursed his lips indifferently and asked Yan Rufeng, \u201cHow can you be my father?\u201d\n Yan Rufeng was speechless.\n He was not angry. Instead, he sighed. \u201cJiang Jiang, your character is completely different from when you were young. I remember that you were very sensible and obedient when you were young.\u201d Unlike now, you\u2019re rebellious and speak aggressively.\n It was fine if Yan Rufeng didn\u2019t mention his childhood, but Yan Jiang felt it was ironic when he did.\n \u201cAre you even worthy of mentioning my childhood?\u201d Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes instantly reddened.\n Yan Jiang clenched his fists and really wanted to punch Yan Rufeng\u2019s face. But he saw the innocent little girl in Han Qingshen\u2019s arms and suppressed his urge.\n He couldn\u2019t beat up her grandfather in front of the little girl.\n Yan Jiang stiffened his neck and took a few deep breaths. When he calmed down, Yan Jiang carefully looked at Yan Rufeng and sized him up. Yan Jiang suddenly realized that the tall and strong man in his memory was actually two centimeters shorter than him.\n Yan Jiang sneered and said mockingly, \u201cYan Rufeng, you did such a despicable thing. Shouldn\u2019t I hate you?\u201d\n Yan Rufeng didn\u2019t retort. He just frowned and explained softly, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d Yan Jiang smiled. As he felt that it was ridiculous, tears welled up in his eyes.\n Holding back the tears that were about to fall at any moment, Yan Jiang said in a low voice, \u201cEveryone in that community knows that Old Madam Yan\u2019s son abandoned his filial wife, his elementary school son, and his elderly mother for a pervert!\u201d\n Yan Rufeng\u2019s eyes quivered but he remained silent.\n Yan Jiang suddenly strode towards Yan Rufeng and pretended to hit him.\n Han Zhan suddenly reached out his left hand and accurately grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s wrist. His deep voice was filled with oppression as he whispered into Yan Jiang\u2019s ear. \u201cYan Jiang, there are reporters nearby and children here. Don\u2019t be rash.\u201d\n At Han Zhan\u2019s reminder, Yan Jiang suddenly stopped in his tracks.\n He panted heavily. His chest heaved up and down due to his anger.\n From a distance, Yan Jiang stared fixedly at Yan Rufeng and scolded. \u201cThe one with the surname Han is a pervert, and you are also a pervert! Meanwhile, I have been called \u2018the son of a pervert\u2019 for many years!\u201d\n \u201cBecause of you, I was beaten up and bullied. I was bullied all over campus!\u201d\n \u201cBecause of you, I didn\u2019t have a father or mother to dote on me. I became an orphan and could only depend on my grandmother!\u201d\n \u201cBecause of you, Grandma couldn\u2019t stand the gossip and ended up hanging herself by the door frame of the room with a rope! As for me, I didn\u2019t dare to sleep day and night and was haunted by my grandmother\u2019s nightmare for more than 10 years!\u201d\n The veins on Yan Jiang\u2019s neck started popping. His face was red and his eyes were bloodshot as he questioned Yan Rufeng angrily. \u201cYan Rufeng, shouldn\u2019t I hate you? Am I not the person in this world who is most qualified to hate you?\u201d\n \u2014 In this world, am I not the most qualified person to hate you?\n Yan Rufeng\u2019s expression changed slightly.\n He looked at his son and felt bitter, aggrieved, and guilty.\n \u201cYou can hate me.\u201d Yan Rufeng\u2019s attitude was cold. He turned to look at the neon lights in the distance and murmured. \u201cYou are innocent. You can hate me.\u201d But who should I hate?\n Yan Jiang smiled disdainfully at Yan Rufeng. He said, \u201cYan Rufeng, you abandoned your own child and went to raise another person\u2019s child. You are really noble.\u201d\n an Rufeng remained silent.\n Yan Jiang glanced at Han Qingshen, who remained silent and didn\u2019t look too good. He was so jealous that he spoke in a sarcastic manner. \u201cCEO Han, you are so lucky.\u201d\n Han Qing frowned deeply. \u201cYan Jiang...\u201d\n Yan Jiang grabbed Song Fei\u2019s hand and said, \u201cAh Fei, let\u2019s go.\u201d Song Fei grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s hand and called Song Ci along.\n After Yan Jiang and the rest left, Yan Rufeng\u2019s tall back suddenly bent.\n Han Qingshen carried Little Treasure and walked up to Yan Rufeng. She looked at Yan Rufeng\u2019s lonely and confused face and said softly, \u201cUncle Yan, don\u2019t be angry. That child doesn\u2019t know the truth. It\u2019s not wrong for him to hate you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s words tonight were indeed vicious. Every word was meant to kill Yan Rufeng\u2019s heart. But Yan Jiang was right. After all, he was the most pitiful victim.\n Yan Rufeng slowly straightened up. He turned and looked at Yan Jiang, who had already walked to the side of the car. His eyes were slightly moist. Yan Rufeng said guiltily, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that his grandmother\u2019s death had cast such a deep shadow on him.\u201d\n Day and night, he was haunted by nightmares and didn\u2019t dare to sleep. Yan Jiang had been in such agony for more than 10 years. Yan Rufeng didn\u2019t dare to think too deeply about how cruel that was.\n He suddenly felt sorry for Yan Jiang and also slightly regretful.\n \u201cI owe this child too much.\u201d All these years, Yan Rufeng had also been keeping an eye on Yan Jiang\u2019s life. He knew that after Yan Jiang became an actor, he became very popular. He also knew that he retired from the entertainment circles and became a forensic doctor.\n Yan Jiang led a carefree and unrestrained life, doing whatever he wanted. He was completely different from the young Yan Rufeng.\n It was obviously his own child, but Yan Jiang\u2019s character was very similar to Han Chenyi\u2019s.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "219": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-220\n\n Chapter 219: The Younger Brother Appears Again \u2013 Dominating and Outstanding  No one expected to meet Yan Rufeng tonight.\n After Yan Jiang met Yan Rufeng, he suddenly became a rabid dog. After his emotional breakdown, he spoke without thinking and was very aggressive.\n Then, he pulled Song Fei away. When they got on the car, Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes were bloodshot.\n Song Fei drove very slowly this time and wound down all the windows. She held the steering wheel with her right hand and stretched her left hand out of the window.\n She knocked on the car door with her left hand and suddenly stopped the car by the side of the road.\n In front, Han Zhan saw that Song Fei had stopped the car and also found a seat nearby.\n Han Zhan and Song Ci sat in the car and waited quietly for them.\n Song Fei sent Song Ci a message: [I\u2019ll leave later.]\n Song Ci: [Okay.]\n Song Fei turned off her cell phone and tilted her head to look at Yan Jiang. Seeing that Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes were red, Song Fei felt terrible.\n No one knew better than Song Fei how much Yan Rufeng affected Yan Jiang. It could be said that Yan Rufeng was the source of Yan Jiang\u2019s pain.\n Being bullied by his classmates, being mocked by his neighbors, being discriminated against and insulted\u2014all because of that father who was called a \u201cpervert\u201d and \u201cMaster Rabbit\u201d.\n Song Fei would forever remember the night when Grandma Yan hung herself and passed away. Yan Jiang had knocked on their door in a panic, stumbled into the house, knelt weakly on the ground, and called out to her with a pale face, \u201cGrandma is dead.\u201d\n He was so helpless and scared that he was shivering and his mouth was trembling. But at that time, where was Yan Rufeng?\n Song Fei wanted Yan Jiang to be happy.\n She found a cigarette, took one out, and handed it to Yan Jiang. \u201cThey said that when you are feeling depressed, smoking can relieve your boredom.\u201d Song Fei stuffed the cigarette into Yan Jiang\u2019s hand. When Yan Jiang looked down, Song Fei told him, \u201cYan Jiang, I like how you are happy.\u201d\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t pinch the cigarette but held Song Fei\u2019s hand.\n Song Fei frowned but remained silent.\n Yan Jiang said hoarsely, \u201cI will be happy if you hug me.\u201d\n Song Fei took off her seatbelt, leaned over, and hugged Yan Jiang. At that moment, Song Fei suddenly recalled that night many years ago. That night, she had also hugged that young man who was trembling from fear like now.\n Yan Jiang hugged Song Fei\u2019s waist and said, \u201cI thought he was dead. I thought he went overseas. I didn\u2019t expect that he had been living in Wangdong City all these years and doing a job that dealt with my profession the most.\u201d\n Song Fei patted Yan Jiang\u2019s back gently but remained silent.\n Yan Jiang added. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the entertainment circles for four years and have collaborated countless times with celebrities from the Empire Entertainment. I even attended the celebratory party of the Empire Entertainment. I had so many chances to meet him, but I missed them all. Do you think he purposely avoided me? Or are we really not fated?\u201d\n Actually, Yan Jiang knew the truth.\n \u201cI am so famous and everyone in the entertainment circle knows my name. As the director of the Empire Entertainment, how can Yan Rufeng not know me? He knows me. He would rather hide in the dark and watch me than come out to meet me.\u201d\n \u201cAh Fei, my mother abandoned me, my grandmother abandoned me, and my father ignored me.\u201d\n Hugging Song Fei tightly, Yan Jiang\u2019s tears landed on her shoulder. He said, \u201cAh Fei, I am an orphan. I am not greedy. I just beg for you not to leave me.\u201d\n Song Fei felt especially terrible. How could she reject the fragile and sad Yan Jiang?\n Kissing Yan Jiang\u2019s side profile, Song Fei told him, \u201cDon\u2019t shed tears for someone unworthy.\u201d\n She wiped Yan Jiang\u2019s tears and ordered him domineeringly. \u201cRemember, your tears can only flow for me. The others are not worth your tears.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was comforted by Song Fei\u2019s dominating manner. \u201cI feel much better now. Let\u2019s go for supper.\u201d\n Song Fei released Yan Jiang and stared at his handsome face. Her heart clenched. \u201cCan you still eat?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d\n Seeing that Song Fei\u2019s car had started moving again, Han Zhan also started the car.\n Only when Song Fei\u2019s car left first did Han Zhan follow behind them at a steady pace.\n Han Zhan knew that it was not good to ask about other people\u2019s private matters, but he was also curious. Han Zhan couldn\u2019t resist asking Song Ci, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between Yan Jiang and Yan Rufeng?\u201d\n Song Ci asked, \u201cBrother Han, do you know Yan Rufeng well?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well, but I\u2019ve heard some things about him and Han Chenyi.\u201d\n \u201cWhat does everyone think of them?\u201d Song Ci asked.\n \u201cMore praise than slander.\u201d Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cI heard that Han Chenyi and Yan Rufeng knew each other since university. The two of them had a deep relationship. Han Qingshen was the child that Han Chenyi found a surrogate to bear after graduating from university. But for some reason, the two of them fell out and Yan Rufeng disappeared for 12 years.\u201d\n \u201cAfter that, Han Chenyi was diagnosed with leukemia and Yan Rufeng returned. Once he returned, he took over the Empire Entertainment and became the vice-president. After Han Chenyi died, Yan Rufeng replaced Han Chenyi as the CEO. He managed the Empire Entertainment for eight years alone. Only when Han Qingshen came from overseas 10 years ago did Yan Rufeng abdicate.\u201d\n Han Zhan recalled that someone had once commented on the relationship between Han Chenyi, Yan Rufeng, and Han Qingshen. He said, \u201cSome say that Yan Rufeng is the current Zhuge Liang, Han Chenyi is Liu Bei, and Han Qingshen is the proud Liu Chan.\u201d\n From Han Zhan\u2019s description, Song Ci saw a devoted Yan Rufeng. This was a completely different image from the man in her heart who abandoned his wife and son.\n As she was very close to Yan Jiang, Song Ci didn\u2019t have a good impression of Yan Rufeng. But she vaguely felt that there might be a reason for Yan Rufeng\u2019s departure back then.\n Han Qingshen was Han Chenyi\u2019s daughter in name, but in reality, she was also Yan Rufeng\u2019s daughter. Meanwhile, Yan Jiang was six years younger than Han Qingshen. In that case, Yan Jiang\u2019s mother was very likely to be a mistress!\n Song Ci was shocked by her own conjecture.\n If Yan Jiang\u2019s mother was the mistress, then Yan Jiang would be too miserable.\n Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat exactly happened between Yan Jiang and Yan Rufeng?\u201d\n Song Ci looked sickly as she said in a muffled voice, \u201cWhen Yan Jiang was 12 years old, Yan Rufeng abandoned Yan Jiang, his mother, and his grandmother. He fled from that house.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, everyone said that someone saw Yan Rufeng behaving intimately with a pervert at the entrance of the community. Yan Rufeng abandoned his family for a pervert, so he is also a pervert.\u201d\n \u201cBecause of Yan Rufeng, Yan Jiang has been criticized from a young age. At that time, his classmates all secretly called him a little pervert. Yan Jiang was always bullied when he was young, so he hated his father, Yan Rufeng.\u201d\n \u201cSo that\u2019s the reason.\u201d Han Zhan was very smart, and he could also think through what Song Ci had just thought of.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cYan Rufeng and Han Chenyi broke up and he disappeared for 12 years. There must be something else going on. No matter what, the child is innocent. Regardless of whether Yan Rufeng is guilty or not, his actions have indeed let Yan Jiang down.\u201d\n As they chatted, the car arrived at the bustling city.\n Song Ci smelled a fragrance. She hooked her nose and turned to look out the window. She saw a young man in a white singlet roasting durians by the roadside. Song Ci was so greedy.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s voice sounded especially soft and obedient.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart softened and he hurriedly acknowledged. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cCan you stop the car by the side?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you want to do? Go to the toilet?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Song Ci pointed behind. \u201cThere\u2019s a handsome guy roasting durians somewhere.\u201d\n For the first time, when Song Ci mentioned another man, Han Zhan\u2019s attention was not on the man who had distracted Song Ci.\n Han Zhan felt nauseous at the mention of durian.\n But he still parked the car by the roadside and alighted with Song Ci.\n The barbeque shop was nearby. Song Ci called Song Fei and told them to order at the barbeque shop first, while she pulled Han Zhan to the durian stall.\n Han Zhan felt terrible at the smell, but Song Ci was pregnant and he couldn\u2019t let her stand alone in front of the durian stall, afraid that she would be bumped into.\n It was especially hot near the durian stall. Song Ci, who was pregnant, was very afraid of heat. In less than two minutes, a layer of sweat covered her face. Han Zhan couldn\u2019t bear to see her suffer, so he said, \u201cGo to the car. There\u2019s air-conditioning in the car. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d\n Song Ci was especially touched. \u201cBrother Han, I really love you.\u201d Song Ci got into the car without any burden to cool down with the air-conditioning.\n Han Zhan was about to suffocate from the smell of roasted durians.\n After roasting the durian, Han Zhan and another customer split it in half. Han Zhan took the larger half.\n He got the shopkeeper to dig out the durian meat and put it in a sealed box. He carried the durian into the car and quickly drove the car to a nearby park.\n Han Zhan placed the durians and Song Ci on a chair in the park before returning to the car.\n He sat in the car and wound down the window to look at Song Ci.\n Song Ci finished her durian and boarded the car. Han Zhan handed her a bottle of carol gum.\n Song Ci obediently poured out two pieces of chewing gum and popped them into her mouth. She didn\u2019t dare to speak as she bit on the chewing gum, because she was afraid that Han Zhan would vomit from her breath that smelled like durians.\n It was already past 11pm by the time they finished the barbeque. It would be very late when they returned to the villa, so Han Zhan called Zhong Buhui to inform him of the situation and brought Song Ci back to their house.\n The moment they entered the house, Han Zhan hugged Song Ci and wanted to be intimate. But the moment he got close to Song Ci\u2019s lips and smelled that faint durian scent, Han Zhan instantly couldn\u2019t bring himself to kiss her.\n He had a strange expression on his face. He looked like he couldn\u2019t bear to let go of dessert but was afraid of gaining weight. Song Ci couldn\u2019t help covering her mouth and laughing.\n Song Ci pushed Han Zhan away and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to brush my teeth.\u201d\n Han Zhan sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really can\u2019t accept the smell of durians.\u201d\n \u201cI understand.\u201d\n Song Ci brushed her teeth and chewed a few chewing gum, before climbing into bed.\n Han Zhan hugged her and the two of them chatted for a while before falling asleep.\n The next morning, Song Ci opened her eyes and saw Han Zhan standing by the bed changing clothes. Ever since she was pregnant, Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to take advantage of Han Zhan anymore, as she was afraid that contractions triggered from over-excitement would be bad for the child.\n ong Ci could only look at such a beautiful scene but couldn\u2019t eat it. She felt slightly sad.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a changing room. Can\u2019t you change in the changing room?\u201d Why did he have to seduce me?\n Han Zhan replied in all seriousness, \u201cTo let your eyes have some thrill.\u201d\n \u201cYou are so cruel.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled. He pointed at the cell phone on the bedside table and said, \u201cGodmother called half an hour ago to look for you.\u201d\n \u201cLooking for me?\u201d Song Ci sat up and asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhy is she looking for me?\u201d\n \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me. Could it be a secret between you women?\u201d Han Zhan raised his brows, feeling slightly curious. What did Godmother want to tell Song Ci alone?\n \u201cI told her that you were still sleeping and told her to call you back after waking up. Remember to call Godmother later to ask.\u201d As he spoke, Han Zhan tossed the tie to Song Ci.\n Song Ci picked up her tie and stood up with her hand on the head of the bed. She bent down, wrapped the tie around Han Zhan\u2019s neck, and tied the knot carefully.\n As she was standing on the bed, Song Ci was much taller than Han Zhan. Han Zhan\u2019s chin was right beside Song Ci\u2019s big tummy. He placed his palm on Song Ci\u2019s tummy and said with a smile, \u201cI find it magical just thinking that our family is about to have two female cubs.\u201d\n Song Ci found it funny. \u201cOther men call their own daughters little princesses. Why are you calling them little female cubs?\u201d It was so unpleasant and without any fatherly love.\n Han Zhan raised his brows. \u201cAren\u2019t you my little princess?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heartbeat quickened slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t say such sweet nothings.\u201d\n After smoothing out her tie and smoothing out Han Zhan\u2019s suit jacket, Song Ci said in satisfaction, \u201cAlright, you can go to work now.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, see you tonight.\u201d\n \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d\n After Han Zhan left, Song Ci got up, went to the toilet, made herself a simple breakfast, and called Mo Yao.\n Mo Yao quickly accepted the call.\n \u201cGodmother, good morning.\u201d Song Ci had a sweet tongue and called her Godmother the moment she opened her mouth.\n Mo Yao said, \u201cI am in America. Song Ci, you should say good night to me.\u201d\n \u201cYou went to America? On a business trip?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Mo Yao was trying to be mysterious. She wanted Song Ci to guess what she was going to New York City for.\n Song Ci thought for a moment and said, \u201cAre you on a holiday with Uncle Li?\u201d\n \u201cYour Uncle Li is with me, but not on a holiday.\u201d\n \u201cI really can\u2019t guess.\u201d\n Mo Yao laughed happily.\n Something good must have happened to Mo Yao. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be so happy.\n \u201cSong Ci, your Uncle Li and I have successfully done IVF.\u201d Mo Yao\u2019s workload had decreased over the past six months and she placed all her focus on the IVF.\n Mo Yao was already 53 years old and not young anymore. When she was young, she had been poisoned and her ovulation period was in disarray. Moreover, her eggs were of poor quality. She had tried several IVFs and failed each time.\n Mo Yao told Song Ci, \u201cDidn\u2019t you give me a Traditional Chinese Medicine notebook written by your father last year? I found my symptoms in that notebook. I spent two to three months grabbing herbs according to your father\u2019s prescription. After three months of treatment, my ovulation period actually became normal.\u201d\n \u201cJust yesterday, the doctor told me that your Uncle Li and my IVF baby is finally successful.\u201d Mo Yao had finally gotten a child in her mid-forties. She, who was usually good at controlling her emotions, was also slightly agitated and her voice was choked.\n \u201cSong Ci, I really have to thank you.\u201d\n Li Yao saw that Mo Yao\u2019s eyes were red. He grabbed her hand and patted it. The two of them looked at each other and smiled again.\n After hearing Mo Yao\u2019s words, Song Ci was also truly happy for her. \u201cI am very happy to be able to help you, Godmother. Congratulations to Godmother and Uncle Li for being promoted to a prospective mother.\u201d\n Being congratulated by Song Ci, Mo Yao was still slightly embarrassed. She said, \u201cAs a godmother, I am quite embararassed that my child is actually half a year younger than your and Han Zhan\u2019s child.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. When your child is born, Han Zhan and I will still call him little brother or sister.\u201d\n Mo Yao laughed again.\n \u201cBut are you planning to have this child on her own or find a surrogate?\u201d Mo Yao was already over 50 years old and an advanced pregnant lady. If she gave birth now, it would be very dangerous for her body and the fetus.\n Mo Yao told Song Ci, \u201cWe have decided to use an artificial uterus as a surrogate.\u201d An artificial uterus was a newly developed technology that had only been developed in the past two years. It was very expensive, but Mo Yao was not short of money. An artificial uterus was indeed the most ideal surrogate tool.\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n After sharing this joy, Song Ci thought of Song Fei\u2019s suggestion last night and said to Mo Yao, \u201cSince you successfully got pregnant, which means that the notebook my father left behind is still useful. I discussed with Han Zhan and intend to donate this diary to the National Medicine Group so that the country can develop and promote it to avoid private companies bidding for it at exorbitant prices.\u201d\n Han Zhan knew very well how valuable Song Tingyun\u2019s notebook was. He was completely capable of starting a new pharmaceutical company and developing and producing it on his own. By then, the prices of the products would be set by him and he would definitely make a killing.\n But Han Zhan gave up on this path to wealth.\n He said that when he was young, he had done many wrong things under Edward\u2019s coercion. Later, when he joined the military, his hands were stained with too much blood. Han Zhan especially believed in karma. He wanted to donate the notebook to benefit more people so that he could accumulate blessings for his two children.\n Meanwhile, Song Ci was the kind of person who would be happy even if she only had a million yuan in savings. Even if she had 10 million yuan, she would still be able to live a carefree life. As long as she wasn\u2019t poor to the point of collapse, Song Ci didn\u2019t really care if she had more money or less.\n Song Ci agreed with Han Zhan\u2019s suggestion.\n After hearing Song Ci and Han Zhan\u2019s decision, Mo Yao remained silent for a moment before saying, \u201cYou guys decide on this matter yourselves. I will send someone to send you the notebook. Song Ci, I really have to thank you this time. The next time I go over to look for you to play, I will bring you a bag of diamonds. I have recently bought dozens of diamonds. There must be something you like!\u201d\n Mo Yao gave gold and diamonds without even thinking, which made Song Ci grin happily. \u201cThank you Godmother!\u201d\n After hanging up, Song Ci tidied up briefly. When Ah Song arrived, she followed him back to the villa.\n On the way back to the villa, Song Ci asked Ah Song, \u201cAh Song, why have you been picking me up these few days? Where is Brother Long?\u201d\n Ah Song smiled and said, \u201cBrother Long is in charge of fetching Mr. Han. We have been transferred.\u201d\n \u201cWhy did you suddenly change shifts?\u201d\n Ah Song said, \u201cIt will be like this frequently in the future.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n Song Ci felt that something was off.\n \u2013\n In the afternoon, after Han Zhan sent off the client team from England, he returned to the office.\n On the way, they passed by a dessert house and Han Zhan got Long Yu to stop the car by the side. He entered the house to buy some dessert and planned to bring them home for Song Ci after work.\n Carrying the desserts back to the office, Han Zhan placed them on the desk. He took off his jacket, sat down, and just opened his laptop, when there was a sudden thud on the French window opposite.\n Han Zhan looked up at the glass and saw a black bullet in the middle.\n Han Zhan\u2019s pupils constricted!\n Ka.\n The bulletproof glass was covered in cracks like a spiderweb.\n Han Zhan quickly got up and hid under the work table. He opened his cell phone and called Long Yu.\n The phone rang for two seconds before Long Yu answered.\n \u201cMr. Han, what do you have...\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a sniper on the commercial street north of the building!\u201d\n Long Yu, who was dozing off in the car, woke up the moment he heard Han Zhan\u2019s words.\n He instinctively put on the gun and started the car. As he drove, Long Yu asked Han Zhan about the details.\n Han Zhan told Long Yu, \u201cThe bulletproof glass window on the north side of my office was hit and didn\u2019t break. I\u2019m fine. The sniper should be hiding in the commercial street on the north side, in a building over 80 meters tall.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t hear any more gunshots. He was about to come out from under the table when there was another ding. The bulletproof glass finally shattered and landed on the floor of Han Zhan\u2019s office.\n A bullet spun into the office and landed on the table above Han Zhan\u2019s head.\n Han Zhan quickly got up from under the table and rolled into the lounge.\n Long Yu heard the commotion and cursed. He immediately roared. \u201cMr. Han, protect yourself well. I will go and catch that bastard now!\u201d\n Han Zhan hung up.\n He hid behind the screen for nearly two minutes, before grabbing the black pillow on the bed and throwing it at the desk.\n Pfft...\n Just as the pillow was about to land on the office table, a bullet accurately hit the pillow. The goose feathers scattered in the air and the scene was slightly beautiful.\n Han Zhan narrowed his eyes and stared at the pillow and the dessert box that had been shot.\n Han Zhan stood there for a full five minutes, before throwing another pillow over. This time, the pillow landed steadily on the table, safe and sound.\n After confirming that the sniper had already retreated, Han Zhan walked out from behind the screen.\n He stood beside his desk and stared at the broken bulletproof glass all over the floor, his eyes cold.\n Pressing the intercom, Han Zhan said to his secretary, \u201cGet CEO Li to come up.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, Mr. Han.\u201d\n Within three to four minutes, Li Li arrived.\n Li Li pushed open the door and entered. His eyelids twitched, when he saw the glass shards all over the floor in front of Han Zhan.\n That is bulletproof glass!\n \u201cMr. Han, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n Han Zhan held two bullets in his left hand.\n He turned around, lifted the bullets, and said to Li Li, \u201cInform someone to install this glass.\u201d\n Li Li stared at the bullet in Han Zhan\u2019s hand, his heart racing. He was an ordinary businessman and had never seen a bullet before.\n Li Li walked up to Han Zhan and carefully touched the two bullets.\n It was cold to the touch and exuded an eerie chill.\n Li Li frowned and asked Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, who did you offend?\u201d\n \u201cI have countless enemies.\u201d From minor characters to major international wanted criminals, there were countless people who wanted to take Han Zhan\u2019s life.\n Li Li complained in his heart: This answer is 100% pretentious.\n \u201cClean the glass first. Don\u2019t let anyone know about this.\u201d Han Zhan turned and walked to his desk, threw the bullet into the drawer, and threw the broken dessert into the dustbin.\n After doing all this, Han Zhan pressed the secretary\u2019s internal line and told the other party, \u201cOrder a takeout for me. I want a chestnut cake from Missu\u2019s house.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, Mr. Han.\u201d\n Li Li was already stunned by the scene in front of him, but Han Zhan was still thinking about the cake he bought for Song Ci. He was indeed a ruthless person.\n Li Li admired Han Zhan slightly.\n \u2013\n Long Yu and his men hurried to the commercial street on the north side and searched every corner carefully. In the end, Long Yu found traces of that sniper on the rooftop of a hotel chain.\n The sniper had taken everything away. There were only traces of him crawling on the ground, but there was a photo pinned to the ground by a rock.\n The photo was facing down and its back was facing up.\n Long Yu carefully took off the rock and turned over the photo. He saw a beautiful back view.\n The back view belonged to a woman. She was wearing a long black robe and had her hair draped over her shoulders. She was standing in front of a swimming pool. Although the woman had her back facing the person taking the photo, Long Yu still recognized her at a glance.\n It\u2019s Song Ci!\n Long Yu recognized the photo and Song Ci\u2019s clothes. It was the clothes she had worn at the temple the last time they went to Brunei.\n Long Yu was stunned.\n What did this person mean by leaving a photo of Madam here?\n Long Yu called Han Zhan in time to report the situation. \u201cMr. Han, we came late and the sniper has already left. He didn\u2019t leave any traces of his identity. However, that sniper left something behind.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n Long Yu hesitated before saying, \u201cA... photo of Madam when she was touring Brunei.\u201d\n Han Zhan suddenly clenched his fists.\n Long Yu guessed. \u201cMr. Han, I suspect that this person is very likely the man who hit on Madam at the Brunei temple.\u201d\n Han Zhan unclenched his fists and said, \u201cLong Yu, bring someone back and bring back the photo.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Long Yu returned to Han Zhan\u2019s office very quickly. He placed the photo on Han Zhan\u2019s desk and said, \u201cMr. Han, this is the photo.\u201d\n Han Zhan picked up that photo and looked at it carefully for a few seconds before saying, \u201cIt looks pretty good.\u201d\n Long Yu frowned and didn\u2019t dare to speak.\n Han Zhan kept the photo in the drawer and said to Long Yu, \u201cSend someone to protect Madam. Nothing must happen to her and the children in her womb.\u201d Han Zhan didn\u2019t notice that his hands were trembling.\n Long Yu stared at Han Zhan\u2019s hand for a few seconds before promising. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Han. As long as I\u2019m still breathing, Madam will be fine.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, thank you.\u201d\n After Long Yu left, Han Zhan was in no mood to continue working. He turned off his computer and just wanted to go home to hug Song Ci.\n After turning off the computer, Han Zhan took his charging cell phone, put on his suit, and left.\n Arriving at the basement, Han Zhan sat in the car to see if Song Ci had updated her social media or Weibo today.\n The moment he opened his WeChat, Han Zhan received a friend request.\n Han Zhan opened the friend review and saw that the other party was a pitch-black user. That person\u2019s WeChat name was very simple:\n A.\n Instinct told Han Zhan that A was Aaron, his half-brother.\n Han Zhan was in a daze for a while before accepting A\u2019s friend request.\n The other party kept typing but didn\u2019t send a single message.\n Han Zhan raised his brows and thought: What exactly are you typing? You haven\u2019t finished writing after so long. Are you writing a confession?\n A moment later, Ah Rang sent a voice message. It was three seconds long.\n Han Zhan turned on the voice message and heard Ah Rang say with a smile, \u201cLong time no see, Hoff. Did you receive my present for you?\u201d Ah Rang\u2019s Chinese pronunciation was very gorgeous and accurate.\n Han Zhan also replied with a voice message.\n Aaron turned on the voice message and heard Han Zhan ask in a low voice, \u201cSo you typed for a long time just now and realized that you can\u2019t speak Chinese, so you had no choice but to give up typing and change to voice message?\u201d\n Aaron, who had been completely guessed by Han Zhan, was speechless.\n Aaron chewed the lollipop in his mouth.\n Han Zhan is so annoying!\n Aaron kicked the streetlight pole beside him.\n At the side, the young man who was also waiting for a cab heard the commotion caused by Aaron He frowned and warned Aaron, \u201cThis gentleman, if you damage public goods, you will be fined if you are reported.\u201d\n Aaron turned back to reveal a stunningly handsome face.\n The young man was momentarily stunned and was speechless by his good looks.\n Aaron took out a lollipop from his pocket and handed it to the young man. \u201cI\u2019m bribing you. Don\u2019t report me, alright?\u201d\n The young man was speechless.\n The young man accepted Ah Rang\u2019s bribe, opened the package, took out the lollipop, stuffed it into his mouth, and tasted it. He said, \u201cThis lollipop is so delicious. What is this? I\u2019ve never eaten it before.\u201d\n Aaron said, \u201cKetamine.\u201d\n The young man was dumbstruck.\n Aaron stroked the other party\u2019s head, making his face red. He then casually said, \u201cSynthetic drugs.\u201d\n The young man was stunned and his face turned pale.\n Aaron sneered and said, \u201cI\u2019m lying to you, child!\u201d He thought of something and curled his lips. He said disdainfully, \u201cChildren are so gullible. They believe everything others say.\u201d\n We clearly agreed to escape together in the future, but someone left first.\n Aaron turned and left. He boarded a bus and sat down. Only then did he press the voice button and reply Han Zhan: [Hoff, please send my regards to the beautiful Cici. Just say that I miss her very much.]\n Han Zhan\u2019s fingertips were cold when he heard Aaron\u2019s voice.\n After sending the message, Aaron covered half of his face with his hat and closed his eyes to sleep.\n It was his first time in China and everything was new to him. Even the crowded bus had become an interesting toy in his eyes.\n \u2013\n ]The bus stopped at the stop. Seeing that no one was coming up, the driver started the car and closed the door. At this moment, an auntie holding an umbrella ran over cursing.\n The driver saw that the person had been chasing after the bus and stopped it.\n The moment the door opened, the auntie hurriedly boarded the bus. She glared fiercely at the driver and used the umbrella in her hand to hit the coin dispenser beside the driver.\n After knocking, the middle-aged woman scolded. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see that someone is getting on the bus? So what if you drive a public bus? Do you really think a public bus is your car?\u201d\n \u201cI paid for the ride. Do you have the right to stop me from getting on?\u201d\n The driver couldn\u2019t resist arguing. \u201cAuntie, you\u2019re late and I have already passed the station.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re still in the right when you rejected a passenger, is it?!\u201d The middle-aged woman opened her small wallet and rummaged through it. She found two fifty-cent coins and threw them into the coin dispenser.\n She scolded the driver again before looking for a seat with the umbrella.\n However, when she turned around, she saw that all the seats in the car were filled and there was no empty seat. The middle-aged woman\u2019s face darkened as she walked straight to a skinny boy wearing a loose t-shirt.\n The auntie pushed the boy hard and scolded. \u201cWhere are you sitting at such a young age! Don\u2019t you know how to give up your seat for an old lady? Are you blind?\u201d\n Everyone in the car frowned and looked at the middle-aged woman in disgust.\n Seeing that the boy didn\u2019t react, the auntie was enraged. She chuckled and pushed the boy again.\n As he was in a daze, someone suddenly shook Aaron awake. He opened his eyes unhappily.\n Just as he was about to pull up his hat, Ah Rang heard an auntie scold him in a shrill voice. \u201cStill pretending to be asleep? Do you have any moral conscience?!\u201d\n \u201cGet up!\u201d\n Aaron was confused.\n What the hell?\n He took off his hat and looked up at the middle-aged woman beside him.\n The middle-aged woman looked to be in her fifties. She held an umbrella in her left hand and a bag of groceries in her right.\n The middle-aged woman was stunned when she saw Ah Rang look up and reveal a European face. She scolded. \u201cSo you are a foreigner. No wonder you don\u2019t know the rules!\u201d\n The lady knocked on the chair under Aaron\u2019s butt with the umbrella in her hand and said fiercely, \u201cMake way for me, my legs hurt!\u201d\n Aaron lowered his hat again.\n He lowered his head, revealing only his beautiful jawline. \u201cYou want me to give up my seat?\u201d The young man\u2019s voice was very gorgeous, like a medieval duke giving a speech.\n The lady said, \u201cI am already old. Shouldn\u2019t you give up your seat for me?\u201d The lady was used to being unreasonable and had an arrogant attitude.\n Aaron suddenly giggled. His laughter was spine-chilling.\n But the middle-aged woman didn\u2019t notice anything amiss. She knocked on the chair under Aaron and urged him. \u201cGet up quickly!\u201d\n aaronA tilted his head and glanced at the promotional slogan stuck to the window. After recognizing the meaning of the words in the row, Ah Rang said, \u201cOn the bus, we should be polite to the old, the weak, the sick, and the disabled.\u201d\n Aaron looked up slightly and gave the auntie a cunning smile.\n That smile scared the middle-aged woman.\n Aaron slowly stood up. As he got up, he said, \u201cI see that you are not old, nor are you a child, much less pregnant...\u201d\n The corners of Aaron\u2019s lips curled up to his ears. He said, \u201cSo you are handicapped?\u201d\n The middle-aged woman realized that this young man was scolding her. She spat and shouted. \u201cYou are the handicapped one! Your entire family is handicapped! Look at how young you are. You are so vicious!\u201d\n Aaron found her noisy and annoying. He stretched out his right leg and kicked the auntie\u2019s knee hard.\n The middle-aged woman\u2019s knees felt like they had been hit by a hammer. She instantly knelt down uncontrollably!\n \u201cAh!\u201d\n The passengers were all frightened.\n Aaron stepped on the auntie\u2019s knees. With a smile on his face, he pressed down hard.\n Hearing the sound of her own bones breaking, the middle-aged woman wailed in grief. \u201cOh no, the foreigners are hitting the Chinese!\u201d\n All the passengers in the car were shocked by Aaron. In addition, the middle-aged woman was indeed hated, but no one helped her. Even the driver only parked the car by the side of the road and forgot to react.\n Using one hand, Aaron pulled the crying auntie up and said respectfully, \u201cAuntie, your legs are handicapped and it\u2019s not convenient for you to move. Please sit.\u201d Saying that, Aaron even considerately arranged the auntie\u2019s crippled legs properly and hung them in front of her seat.\n The middle-aged woman was terrified by Ah Rong\u2019s polite manner after being injured. She was sweating profusely from the pain but didn\u2019t dare to scold him anymore.\n This is a lunatic!\n Aaron walked to the driver\u2019s seat of the bus. He lowered his hat and smiled at the driver. He praised him. \u201cSir, your driving skills are not bad. It\u2019s very stable and deserves a five-star rating.\u201d\n With that, he pressed the button to open the door and alighted just like that, leaving the car full of stunned passengers and the wailing auntie.\n ...\n When Han Zhan returned home, Song Ci was watching a video on her cell phone.\n Han Zhan vaguely heard a man say on the phone, \u201cLook, it\u2019s this young man wearing a hat. He has been sleeping since he boarded the car. What about this auntie? She started scolding people the moment she boarded the car.\u201d\n \u201cThe lady woke the young man up and asked him to give up his seat. Her words were rather harsh and unpleasant. The young man crippled her right knee and invited her to sit down. As the young man had been wearing a hat and didn\u2019t show his face, it was rather difficult to find out his identity.\u201d\n Han Zhan walked up to Song Ci and sat down. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\n Song Ci handed the cell phone to Han Zhan and told him concisely, \u201cAn old lady was too unreasonable and asked a young man to give up his seat for her. In the end, that young man actually broke her leg and gave up his seat.\u201d\n That young man had really managed to \u201cbe civilized and give way to the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled\u201d.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIs that so? There\u2019s such a talent?\u201d\n Han Zhan played the video again. In the video, the head covered almost all of the young man\u2019s face, only revealing his chin and nose.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t recognize this person. He returned the cell phone to Song Ci and said, \u201cVicious people will be taken in by others.\u201d\n This middle-aged lady would never dare to flaunt her seniority again.\n At this moment, Han Zhan\u2019s WeChat rang again.\n Han Zhan opened WeChat and saw Aaron say: [So the input method also supports handwriting.]\n Han Zhan was confused.\n Aaron sent another message: [Brother, I seem to have become a new internet celebrity because I beat someone up on the bus.]\n Han Zhan felt slightly tired. This troublemaker, why is he so restless everywhere he goes!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "220": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-221\n\n Chapter 220: Edward: Useless!  Song Ci looked at the time and saw that it was only 4pm.\n Usually at this time, Han Zhan would still be working hard in the company. Why did he come back so early today? Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, are you done with work today?\u201d\n Han Zhan wanted to tell Song Ci what happened at the office today, but when he looked down and saw Song Ci\u2019s big tummy, Han Zhan smiled again and said, \u201cI just remembered that I haven\u2019t had a good meal with you for a long time. I heard from Li Li that pregnant women need to be coaxed, so I specially went home early today to prepare dinner for you.\u201d\n Han Zhan took out a box of desserts from his suit jacket. \u201cLook, it\u2019s your favorite chestnut cake.\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly smiled in a very clean and happy manner. With a smile, the stars in the sky were all reflected in her eyes. Han Zhan was slightly mesmerized by her smile and instinctively reached out to touch Song Ci\u2019s eyes.\n Song Ci\u2019s smile faded slightly. She didn\u2019t speak and even tilted her head to rub her face under Han Zhan\u2019s thumb.\n Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cBaby Ci, I love you.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n After being married for so long, this seemed to be the first time Han Zhan said that he loved her.\n The moment she heard this, Song Ci was not touched or secretly happy, but puzzled. \u201cHan Zhan, tell me, what happened.\u201d Song Ci looked clumsy, but was actually very meticulous. Han Zhan is really strange today. He must have encountered something today.\n A man who never spoke of love suddenly confessed. He must have been agitated.\n Han Zhan smiled. \u201cWhy can\u2019t anything escape your eyes?\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly proud. \u201cI can read minds. Tell me, what happened today?\u201d\n Han Zhan muttered to himself for a moment before finally deciding to tell the truth. \u201cI met with a shooting today.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s tone was rather calm and his eyes didn\u2019t waver at all.\n But when Song Ci heard the word \u201cshooting\u201d, her rosy cheeks instantly paled.\n \u201cShooting?\u201d Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm and anxiously sized him up carefully. After confirming that there was no blood on Han Zhan\u2019s body and no signs of wounds or bandages, Song Ci\u2019s heart that was in her throat instantly relaxed.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not injured.\u201d She looked terrified.\n A smile appeared in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Pulling Song Ci into his arms, Han Zhan told her, \u201cA piece of the bulletproof glass in the office broke and I escaped a disaster. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n \u201cHave you caught the murderer?\u201d Song Ci wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep peacefully if she didn\u2019t catch the murderer.\n \u201cDo you still remember that young man you met at Brunei?\u201d Han Zhan stroked Song Ci\u2019s belly and said, \u201cHe was also the one who came to kill me today.\u201d\n How could Song Ci not remember!\n \u201cIt\u2019s Aaron? Your half-brother?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know how much Aaron hated Han Zhan. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhy did Aaron suddenly attack you? He hasn\u2019t bothered you for so many years. It\u2019s too sudden for him to do this today.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n Han Zhan pointed at Song Ci\u2019s hand on the sofa and said, \u201cThe young man wearing a hat in the video you were watching just now was Aaron.\u201d\n \u201cAh?\u201d\n Song Ci picked up her cell phone and watched the video again. After Han Zhan\u2019s reminder and looking at the young man in the video, Song Ci also felt that the young man\u2019s figure indeed resembled that of the man in Brunei.\n \u201cCan\u2019t you catch him?\u201d Song Ci hoped that Han Zhan could catch Aaron to prevent future trouble.\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cAaron was trained by Edward. It won\u2019t be easy to capture him.\u201d\n Han Zhan saw that Song Ci\u2019s frown was so deep that it could kill a mosquito. He cupped Song Ci\u2019s face and smoothed out her wrinkles. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I have an iron wall. I will be fine.\u201d\n \u201cYou, on the other hand, should take good care of yourself and don\u2019t run around nowadays.\u201d Han Zhan kissed Song Ci\u2019s lips and sighed. \u201cSong Ci, I will only be at ease if the three of you are safe and sound.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I promise you that I won\u2019t go out for the time being.\u201d Song Ci was the best at judging the situation and knew that Aaron was watching from the shadows, so she would never go out.\n It was definitely the safest to be with Grandpa.\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Han Zhan stood up and patted his wrinkled pants. \u201cWhat do you want to eat? I\u2019ll make it for you.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s see what other ingredients are in the fridge.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan was preparing dinner and the sun was about to set. The afterglow of the sunset shone through the gaps of the leaves of the forest. The villa was hidden in the mottled forest with smoke curling around it, filled with the atmosphere of the mortal world.\n Han Zhan placed the table in the small garden, served the dishes, set up the cutlery, took off his apron, and shouted at Han Aoyu, who was squatting in the vegetable garden planting cabbages. \u201cGrandpa, it\u2019s time to eat!\u201d\n Following that, he shouted into the house. \u201cBaby Ci, Uncle Zhong, it\u2019s time to eat!\u201d\n Han Aoyu took the hoe back into the house, washed his face, and scrubbed his hands clean with soap before coming to the table. Seeing the table full of dishes, Han Aoyu chuckled and said, \u201cThe sun rose from the west today. Kid, you also know how to cook.\u201d\n Only after escaping death today did Han Zhan realize that he had neglected his family because he was busy with work, be it the pregnant Song Ci or his grandfather who was getting weaker by the day.\n Han Zhan scooped half a bowl of rice for Han Aoyu. He said, \u201cFrom now on, I will rest on weekends.\u201d\n \u201cYo.\u201d Han Aoyu glanced at him and mocked him in a sarcastic manner. \u201cAren\u2019t you usually busier than the country\u2019s president? Why are you so free now?\u201d Han Aoyu\u2019s every gaze and every word was filled with dissatisfaction towards Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan knew that he was in the wrong and didn\u2019t retort.\n He poured himself a glass of water, picked it up, and raised it to apologize to Han Aoyu. \u201cI am unfilial. I only know how to earn money and neglected my family. I will punish myself with a glass.\u201d With that, Han Zhan finished the glass of water.\n Han Aoyu turned proudly and said proudly, \u201cI can forgive you...\u201d Rubbing his hands together, Han Aoyu was eager to try. He said,\u201d Give me a mouthful! \u201d\n Han Zhan put down his teacup and said, \u201cThen don\u2019t forgive me.\u201d\n Han Aoyu chuckled and muttered a few more bad things about Han Zhan.\n Song Ci observed the interaction between Han Zhan and Han Aoyu with a faint smile on her face, but she knew why he had done what he did tonight. As he had survived a disaster and was facing the threat of death, he thought of his family. Perhaps he felt guilty and reluctant, so he made a table full of dishes to accompany her and Old Master.\n Song Ci filled a cup with chicken soup and said to Han Zhan, \u201cCome, Brother Han, let\u2019s have a toast.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Seeing that they were all toasting, Zhong Buhui poured himself a glass of water and clinked glasses with Han Zhan.\n After dinner, Han Zhan and Han Aoyu laid side by side on the recliner in the garden. There were still mosquitoes in this season, and Han Aoyu and Han Zhan each lit a mosquito extinguishing lamp. But Han Zhan was born with the love of attracting mosquitoes, so he still had a few big bites.\n He sat up and kept swatting at the mosquitoes, scratching them.\n Han Aoyu suddenly said, \u201cI heard that you encountered a shooting today.\u201d\n Han Zhan used his hard nails to press the mosquito bun on his arm. Hearing this, he said without looking up, \u201cYou know?\u201d He thought he could hide it from Han Aoyu.\n Han Aoyu snorted. \u201cIt would be strange if I didn\u2019t know.\u201d It was very easy for Han Aoyu to know something.\n Han Zhan acknowledged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s Aaron.\u201d\n Aaron?\u201d It was the first time Han Aoyu heard this name and felt it was unfamiliar, so he asked Han Zhan, \u201cWho is Aaron?\u201d From Han Zhan\u2019s words, the person who wanted to kill him was an acquaintance.\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression was cold as he said, \u201cEdward\u2019s other child always followed behind me when I was young. He was very good-looking but very timid. Grandpa, do you still remember?\u201d\n Han Aoyu thought for a moment before asking, \u201cIs it that little boy who stood far away and observed me secretly?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Han Aoyu already couldn\u2019t remember that child\u2019s looks and didn\u2019t know what his relationship with Han Zhan was, so he asked him, \u201cYou two didn\u2019t get along when you were young?\u201d\n \u201cWe were on very good terms then. We agreed that when we were of age and strong enough, we would escape from that cage. But I was lucky to meet you, Grandpa. Aaron had no one to back him up, no one to think of him, no one to bring him out of his misery, so he ended up like this.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Aoyu didn\u2019t continue to discuss this matter. He closed his eyes and started humming a Beijing Opera. Old Master Han\u2019s voice was incomplete and a classic tune came out of his mouth. It was completely different and Han Zhan couldn\u2019t tell what he was singing.\n Han Zhan hurriedly slipped away.\n Sooner or later, the weather would start to turn cold and many of Song Ci\u2019s clothes were still in the duplex. The next day, before Han Zhan got off work, Song Ci called him and asked him to go back and get a few pairs of flats and early autumn clothes for her.\n Han Zhan got Long Yu to drive the car into the community. He pushed open the door, entered the house, and went straight upstairs. Han Zhan found a luggage bag and put away the beautiful single shoes that Song Ci had asked for. He also retrieved five to six autumn outfits, folded them, and placed them in the luggage.\n He carried his luggage and was about to enter the room.\n Gripping the door handle, Han Zhan had just pressed it when there was a slight movement behind him. Han Zhan quickly turned around, raised his left foot, and kicked violently behind him!\n That kick landed on a firm chest.\n \u201cHmph!\u201d A grunt followed.\n Han Zhan looked over and saw a gray shadow hurriedly take two steps back. His calf knocked against the bedpost, and only then did he stabilize himself.\n That person touched the corners of his lips and stood up.\n He suddenly looked up and his gray-blue eyes met Han Zhan\u2019s. The two of them looked exactly the same. The man had blonde hair and blue eyes. There was a small mole between his lips and chin, making him look bewitching.\n That man grinned at Han Zhan and said in a strange tone, \u201cI thought you had become a weak husband after being discharged from the military. I didn\u2019t expect you to be quite resistant.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at the young man and remained silent.\n After more than 20 years, this was the first time Han Zhan saw Aaron. The skinny little boy in his memory had really grown up. He was tall and handsome, and there was almost no familiar feeling from his childhood.\n Only that little black mole remained the same.\n Han Zhan released the luggage and frowned. \u201cAaron, long time no see.\u201d\n Hearing this long-lost call of Aaron, Aaron was momentarily stunned, before a look of embarrassment and anger appeared on his face. \u201cI am not here to reminisce with you!\u201d Aaron raised his fist again and sprinted towards Han Zhan at the speed of light.\n He was coming at him fiercely!\n Aaron\u2019s fighting style was very messy. He had never learned orthodox martial arts and his fighting style was a technique he had learned in actual combat. Every move and every move was a move that took a person\u2019s life!\n Aaron\u2019s fist went straight for Han Zhan\u2019s heart.\n If that punch landed, Han Zhan\u2019s heart would not shatter but would tremble several times.\n Han Zhan placed his palm on his chest and took the blow with difficulty. His expression changed slightly. His other hand grabbed hold of Aaron\u2019s arm tightly, used his head as a weapon, and knocked hard at Aaron\u2019s head.\n Aaron wanted to let go of Han Zhan, but Han Zhan\u2019s hand was like an iron clamp, grabbing onto Aaron and not letting go.\n In battle, Han Zhan would never let any enemy off. He would always find the enemy\u2019s most fatal weakness in the shortest time possible.\n And Aaron\u2019s flaws...\n When Han Zhan\u2019s head hit Aaron\u2019s nose, he quickly lifted his right leg and kicked Ah Rang\u2019s left calf.\n Releasing Ah Rang\u2019s arm, Han Zhan grabbed Ah Rang\u2019s short hair, pulled his hair back forcefully, and hit the wall several times.\n After four to five consecutive knocks, Han Zhan grabbed Aaron\u2019s hair and made him look up at himself.\n Aaron\u2019s forehead was bleeding, but he had a sinister smile on his face.\n Aaron\u2019s smile made Han Zhan very uncomfortable.\n Han Zhan pressed Aaron onto the windowsill again. He grabbed Aaron\u2019s wrists with both hands and pressed his right knee against his waist, completely restricting his movements.\n Suppressing Aaron, Han Zhan used his right hand to press Aaron\u2019s face against the window sill. He leaned over, lowered his head, and said in Aaron\u2019s ear, \u201cYou really think I don\u2019t know anything about your infiltration? Didn\u2019t you realize that my house is filled with surveillance cameras?\u201d\n Aaron scolded. \u201cAre you a pervert? You even install surveillance cameras in the room!\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled and said, \u201cWhich one of us isn\u2019t a pervert?\u201d\n Aaron remained silent.\n Han Zhan stared at Aaron\u2019s face and hesitated over whether to kill him.\n Aaron could see the murderous intent and hesitation in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes, but he was like a maniac, purposely provoking Han Zhan. \u201cHoff, if you don\u2019t kill me, I will definitely kill that bitch Song Ci in the future! Don\u2019t forget that she still has two little ones in her tummy!\u201d\n \u201cIf I make a move, I will have three lives. I have profited!\u201d\n The little boy who would vomit at night after waking up from his sleep, because he had injured someone had actually turned into a murderous demon when he grew up.\n Aaron\u2019s words made Han Zhan want to kill him.\n Han Zhan took out the dagger from his pocket and was about to stab it into Aaron\u2019s throat when he suddenly felt something under his knees. Han Zhan looked at Aaron\u2019s waist in confusion. Through the thin fabric of his clothes, Han Zhan saw the outline of a pistol.\n Aaron was still scolding Han Zhan fiercely. \u201cCome on! Just stab me to death! That year, you abandoned me and went to live in luxury alone. You can definitely kill me now! Why are you still hesitating? Just stab me!\u201d\n \u201cSuch pretentiousness is disgusting!\u201d\n Aaron lifted his neck and told Han Zhan considerately, \u201cCome, stab my neck. Just stab the aorta here and let me die the fastest!\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at Aaron\u2019s angry face. After a while, he suddenly retracted his knife and let go of Aaron. Han Zhan took a step back, leaned against the wall, and looked at Aaron with a complicated gaze.\n Seeing that Han Zhan suddenly stopped, Aaron was momentarily stunned. He cursed as he stood up, sat on the windowsill, and asked Han Zhan with a cold smile, \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t dare to kill me? You\u2019re so cowardly.\u201d\n ]Han Zhan played with the knife in his hand. He said in a low voice, \u201cYou didn\u2019t shoot me.\u201d\n Aaron\u2019s treacherous smile froze on his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d Aaron pretended not to understand.\n Han Zhan glanced at Aaron\u2019s waist and reminded him. \u201cYou have a gun. Why didn\u2019t you shoot me?\u201d\n Aaron\u2019s expression changed to one of arrogance and disdain. He said, \u201cYou are not worth my gun!\u201d\n Aaron\u2019s expression was hateful and fierce. This made Han Zhan think of that cat that Old Master Chen had raised many years ago. It looked mighty and domineering, but once you poked its stomach, it would immediately want one to hug and lift it up.\n Han Zhan suddenly smiled. \u201cAaron, you are a good child.\u201d\n Having been teased, Aaron started scolding again. \u201cSon of a bitch Hoff, XX...\u201d Ah Rang scolded from English to Italian and then to German. He then said in Chinese,\u201d I am 32 years old. Good your mother!\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled. \u201cYou were very boring when you were young, but now you are so sharp-tongued.\u201d\n Aaron kept quiet.\n Han Zhan looked down and saw that Aaron\u2019s left leg was twitching unconsciously. But even though his calf was already hurting, Aaron\u2019s expression was very calm, as if he had never been injured.\n He had already learned to endure and to clench his teeth through everything.\n Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cAaron, leave Italy and live with me.\u201d\n Aaron stared at Han Zhan in a daze, his eyes slightly red.\n He rubbed his nose and turned to look at the scenery outside the window. A few seconds later, he said in a low voice, \u201cHoff, a person with broken bones is completely incurable.\u201d Even if he managed to survive by cutting his own flesh, that rotten bone was still missing and would never grow back.\n He had already become one with hell. He was living a ghost in hell, and he would become a pile of ashes in hell when he\u2019s dead.\n He couldn\u2019t leave.\n He was already rotting there.\n Hearing Aaron\u2019s reply, Han Zhan didn\u2019t feel good. He was once again very grateful that Han Aoyu had found him back then, brought him back, and taught him meticulously. Otherwise, Han Zhan would definitely grow to be even more twisted and evil than Ah Rang.\n Han Zhan raised his hand and wanted to touch the hair on Aaron\u2019s hand. He reached out halfway but retracted his hand in the end.\n Noticing that Han Zhan had placed his hand down, Aaron\u2019s shoulders dropped and he remained silent.\n Han Zhan suddenly asked Aaron, \u201cAaron, do you want to visit your mother?\u201d\n This topic jumped a little too quickly and Aaron couldn\u2019t keep up with Han Zhan\u2019s pace. Blinking his eyes, Aaron was confused and asked, \u201cMy mother?\u201d\n Seeing that Ah Rang was stunned, Han Zhan smiled and said, \u201cMany years ago, I already investigated your mother\u2019s identity. Two years ago, I finally found out.\u201d Han Zhan told Ah Rang, \u201cThe information is in my study. I will go and get it for you.\u201d\n \u201cWho wants it?\u201d Ah Rang rejected immediately, but his bottom seemed to have been smeared with glue and stuck to the windowsill, unable to get down.\n Han Zhan turned and went to the study to find the document.\n The study opened a crack and Han Zhan threw the document out. He closed the door and stood behind it, listening intently. Shortly after, he heard footsteps coming out of his master bedroom.\n The footsteps stopped at the door of the study and went downstairs.\n After a while, Han Zhan opened the door and saw that the floor was clean but the document had disappeared.\n \u2013\n Aaron returned to the hotel with the document.\n After taking a shower and drinking a glass of red wine, he calmed down and opened the document.\n Gao Yunyun...\n Female, born in 1969, currently residing in Qingshui Town.\n Thirty years ago, she became a female singer in Hong Kong. After debuting for five years, she retired from the industry in a low-profile manner. Now, she was married and had a daughter under her name.\n After investigation, Gao Yunyun became a female singer at 18 years old. At 19 years old, she was given to her business partner, Edward, at a dinner party. The two of them spent three days and two nights together. In 1988, Gao Yunyun gave birth secretly. Before she finished her confinement, the child was taken away by Edward...\n After reading this document, Ah Rang tightened his bathrobe, laid down on the sofa, and fell asleep uneasily.\n ...\n It was raining in Jiangnan River Delta in August and the mist caused it to be hazy, like a paradise trapped in the human world.\n Aaron was wearing an azure silk shirt and holding a handmade black oil-paper umbrella with a crane drawn on it. He had blonde hair and blue eyes. His facial features were deep and handsome. His thin, handsome figure moved along the smooth stone road, breaking the silence of Jiangnan Town.\n The news of a handsome man suddenly appearing in this peaceful and beautiful town very quickly spread far and wide.\n That afternoon, the third-year tuition class at Qingshui City High School was on holiday.\n Zhong Ling\u2019er ended school and walked to the entrance, where she saw her parents standing beside the car, waiting for her to finish school. She ran up to her mother in small steps and hugged her. She said coquettishly, \u201cMother, I miss you so much.\u201d\n Her mother, Gao Yunyun, was about to laugh when she heard her daughter, Zhong Ling\u2019er, say, \u201cI really want to eat your cola chicken wings and fried rice cakes!\u201d\n Gao Yunyun shook her head helplessly and held Zhong Ling\u2019er\u2019s hand as they got into the car. Father Zhong followed behind the mother-daughter duo with a smile, looking righteous and talkative. In the distance, a handsome young man stood under a tree and watched the car drive away from afar. In his eyes, the green mountains and clear waters of Jiangnan Town surfaced \u2013 hazy and sparkling.\n Zhong Ling\u2019er sat in the car and said to Gao Yunyun, \u201cMother, they said that a handsome guy came to our town. He looks like a European celebrity. Have you guys seen him? I will go to town to take a look tomorrow during the holidays.\u201d\n Father Zhong panicked at the mention of handsome men. My daughter is still so young. How could she be in a relationship? \u201cYou are going to be promoted to Year Three soon. It is more important to study hard. Why are you looking at handsome men?\u201d\n Sticking out her tongue at her stern, old-fashioned father, Zhong Ling\u2019er held her mother\u2019s hand again and said, \u201cDo you allow me to go and see handsome men, Mother? I\u2019ll go and take a look and secretly take a photo. Later on, he\u2019ll encourage me to study hard and be worthy of being a super handsome man in the future.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re so full of twisted logic.\u201d\n After returning home and waiting for Zhong Ling\u2019er to fall asleep, Gao Yunyun took a shower and threw her clothes into the washing machine. She went to the living room to get a glass of water and walked to the window to drink it. She looked down and saw a tall young man standing in the courtyard.\n The moon shone brightly and darkness covered the ground behind that person.\n The young man stood under the moonlight. He was as beautiful as a jade crown, but he was covered in sorrow.\n Gao Yunyun was shocked.\n The houses here were all old-fashioned and were exclusive, so the yards were all in the courtyard.\n The young man had climbed over the wall to get in.\n But the strange thing was that Gao Yunyun only calmed down after the initial shock. Through the moonlight, Gao Yunyun and the young man looked at each other from afar. By the time she snapped out of her trance, the young man had already left, and for some reason, she was covered in tears.\n The next morning, Gao Yunyun woke up early and went to buy beancurd from the town\u2019s Old Master Wang with a thermos flask. She was wearing a white cheongsam with embroidered shoes. Her waist was very narrow and she walked elegantly. Many men were stealing glances at her.\n She was already in her fifties but still had an elegant aura and a delicate figure. Old Zhong was really fortunate.\n Gao Yunyun walked up to Uncle Wang\u2019s stall and said, \u201cPack three servings of tofu pudding.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, Yunyun, do you still want fried dough sticks and sesame seeds?\u201d\n \u201cThree.\u201d After a pause, Gao Yunyun added. \u201cGive me some more rice cakes. I will stir-fry them myself when I get home.\u201d\n \u201cAlright!\u201d\n Uncle Wang was quick and rapidly prepared what Gao Yunyun needed.\n Gao Yunyun carried her things and saw that it was drizzling again. She opened an oil-paper umbrella and walked along the narrow and long alley. After walking for a while, Gao Yunyun saw a young man in white walking over.\n Staring at the young man\u2019s facial features, Gao Yunyun stood rooted to the ground in panic.\n \u201cBe careful.\u201d The young man caught the rice cake that had nearly fallen to the ground.\n Gao Yunyun snapped out of her trance and thanked him. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n The young man walked past her.\n After the young man took five to six steps, Gao Yunyun suddenly turned and called him. \u201cWait a minute, Sir.\u201d\n Aaron stopped in his tracks and slowly turned to look at Gao Yunyun.\n \u201cSir, have you been following me these few days?\u201d Gao Yunyun had already discovered the young man\u2019s existence. He had been appearing by her side inadvertently these few days and couldn\u2019t be ignored.\n Ah Rang suddenly took out a handkerchief from his pocket. He had bought it at an embroidery shop in town with a proud red plum embroidered on it. Aaron handed the handkerchief to Gao Yunyun and asked sheepishly, \u201cAre you Gao Yunyun?\u201d\n Gao Yunyun nodded. \u201cI am.\u201d\n Aaron smiled and told Gao Yunyun, \u201cHello, I am your fan. I especially like your \u2018Yesterday Won\u2019t Come\u2019.\u201d Ah Rang hummed a few lines of it and asked politely under Gao Yunyun\u2019s stunned gaze, \u201cCan you give me an autograph?\u201d\n Gao Yunyun was stunned. \u201cYou are my fan?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n When Gao Yunyun was young, she was a small singer. After that, she didn\u2019t make a name for herself and quit the industry to get married.\n Gao Yunyun was very flattered that she could still meet her fan after so many years and he was even a young and handsome foreign man. She had a fountain pen in her bag. Gao Yunyun took the handkerchief from Aaron and signed her name on the counter of a small shop nearby.\n Aaron looked at her signature and focused expression, as he slowly lowered his head.\n \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d Gao Yunyun handed the handkerchief to Ah Lan.\n Aaron looked down and saw that the handkerchief read:\n I hope that you will live peacefully and happily forever\u2014Gao Yunyun.\n This really didn\u2019t look like a signature blessing from an idol.\n Aaron took the handkerchief with both hands and was in no hurry to fold it. Instead, he waited for its handwriting to dry. Gao Yunyun looked at him for a while and suddenly said, \u201cIt\u2019s fate that we meet again. Sir, let me treat you to breakfast.\u201d\n Aaron looked at her with a complicated expression.\n Gao Yunyun explained. \u201cI have already retired from the entertainment circles for many years. It is my honor that someone still remembers me. Sir, I want to treat you to breakfast. Are you willing to do so?\u201d\n Somehow, Aaron nodded.\n They were sitting in a breakfast shop.\n The soup dumplings in the drawer were round, clean, adorable, and tasty.\n Gao Yunyun used a pair of clean chopsticks to pick up a soup dumpling and placed it on the plate in front of Aaron. \u201cSir, this soup dumpling tastes very fresh and delicious. It will be even more delicious with some sauce.\u201d\n Aaron stared at the soup dumplings. After a while, he picked up the soup dumpling, dipped it in some sauce, and stuffed it into his mouth.\n The strong smell of onions and meat filled his mouth.\n Aaron chewed on his soup dumplings as his eyes suddenly blurred.\n Gao Yunyun stared at the handsome man with slightly reddened eyes. Eight of the soup dumplings went into Aaron\u2019s stomach. After finishing the soup dumplings, Aaron put down his chopsticks and elegantly wiped his lips with a tissue. Only then did he stand up slowly and bent over to bid farewell.\n \u201cThank you for your hospitality. The soup dumplings are very delicious.\u201d\n Aaron\u2019s lashes quivered before he said, \u201cIn that case, Madam Gao Yunyun, I will take my leave.\u201d\n Aaron was about to leave, when Gao Yunyun suddenly grabbed his wrist emotionally.\n Aaron was stunned.\n He looked down at Gao Yunyun and remained silent.\n Gao Yunyun realized that she was being rude and hurriedly said, \u201cI still have a present for you.\u201d\n Aaron asked softly, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n Gao Yunyun opened her handbag and took out a jade pendant. She placed it in Aaron\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThis is a peace pendant. It\u2019s not worth much. I went to the temple to ask for it. It\u2019s fate that we met here. I don\u2019t have anything else to give you, so just take this jade pendant.\u201d\n Gao Yunyun took another deep look at Ah Rang before carrying her bag and leisurely walking out of the breakfast shop.\n After watching Gao Yunyun disappear behind the breakfast shop, Ah Rang opened his palm and looked down at the little dragon pendant.\n Aaron suddenly took out his cell phone and searched for a question on Baidu.\n What is the zodiac of someone born in August 1988?\n The answer: Dragon.\n Holding the jade pendant, Aaron\u2019s eyes suddenly blurred.\n ]He folded the handkerchief, put it in his pocket, and hung the jade pendant around his neck. Only then did he return to his homestay, check out from the room, and leave China. At the airport, Aaron took his cell phone, sent Han Zhan a message, and left.\n There was a sea of people at the Naples International Airport. Aaron carried a small bag and boarded an off-road vehicle.\n The car drove around the city for more than 40 minutes, before finally stopping in front of a luxurious house. He alighted, placed his hands in his pockets, and entered the house.\n Passing by the pool, he saw a man practicing in the middle of the pool. Aaron stopped in his tracks and respectfully called out to the pool. \u201cSicilio, where is Father?\u201d\n Sicilio emerged from the pool wearing only a pair of swimming trunks. His chest muscles were very defined and he had two bullet scars on them. He flicked his hair and water droplets splashed everywhere. He looked very manly.\n Staring at Aaron intently, Sicilio suddenly asked, \u201cAaron, who did you meet?\u201d\n Sicilio\u2019s eyes were as sharp as an eagle\u2019s. With just one look, he noticed the change in Aaron.\n There were some unclear emotions in him. Those were emotions that they absolutely shouldn\u2019t have!\n ]Aaron\u2019s heart shuddered as he answered without revealing anything. \u201cThe mission failed.\u201d\n Sicilio raised his brows and said expressionlessly, \u201cGo and receive your punishment yourself.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Neapolis was in the south of Italy and close to the Mediterranean. The houses here were all built in the standard Mediterranean style. Aaron walked into a small building with white walls and red bricks. He heard the commotion and took off his shoes, stepping on the wooden floor to the second floor.\n A bare-chested man was sitting on the sofa in the hall on the second floor with his back facing Aaron. He was maintaining his gun. Beside him, a sexy lady was kneeling on the floor pouring him a bottle of whiskey.\n ]He assembled the gun and placed the muzzle under the lady\u2019s chin.\n The woman gave him a coquettish look, opened her mouth, and took the initiative to bite the gun.\n ]The man sneered and pushed her down.\n Aaron stood there and watched them fool around.\n After everything was over, the woman dragged her weak body away. Only then did the man pick up his bathrobe and put it on.\n He stood up and turned around, revealing a pair of stern, cold, and handsome faces. He was nearly 60 years old, but there were no signs of age on his face. In addition to his self-discipline, his figure and mental appearance were like that of a 40-year-old in his prime.\n Squinting his gray-blue eyes, Edward poured a glass of wine and handed it to Aaron.\n Aaron accepted the wine with both hands but didn\u2019t dare to drink it.\n \u201cI heard that your mission this time failed?\u201d Edward was obviously expressionless, but Aaron\u2019s hand that was holding the wine glass was trembling slightly. He nodded slightly and acknowledged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father. I failed my duty.\u201d\n Edward asked, \u201cWhy did you fail?\u201d\n Aaron was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cLone Wolf, it\u2019s Hoff.\u201d\n \u201cThat little bastard!\u201d Edward snorted. He took the wine from Aaron\u2019s hand and placed it on the table. Touching the rim of the glass, Edward suddenly turned around, raised the gun in his hand, and shot at Aaron!\n The bullet dug into his abdomen and tore through his intestines.\n Aaron instantly knelt down. He didn\u2019t dare to make a sound or cover his wound with his hand.\n Adhua walked over with the wine and splashed that glass of whiskey on Aaron\u2019s wound. The wound was washed by the wine and the excruciating pain was suffocating.\n Aaron\u2019s face was twisted in pain and his forehead was covered in sweat. His face was as pale as a corpse in a funeral parlor, but he still had to apologize respectfully. \u201c...I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m useless.\u201d\n \u201cTrash!\u201d\n Edward lifted his leg and walked past the pool of blood on the ground.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "221": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-222\n\n Chapter 221: In the Whole World, Only He Treats Me Well  Aaron knelt on the ground and stared at the pool of blood that had been burnt by alcohol and was foaming, but he didn\u2019t make a sound.\n Only when Edward went downstairs and there were no more footsteps could be heard did Aaron hold the sofa and slowly got up. As he moved, his wound was agitated and more blood flowed out. Aaron finally couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and moaned in pain.\n When Aaron looked up to leave, he realized that Sicilio had arrived at the entrance of the main hall on the second floor.\n His tall figure stood under the door, crossed his arms, and looked at Aaron coldly.\n Aaron\u2019s lips quivered a few times. In the end, he didn\u2019t say a word and dragged his aching body downstairs. As he brushed past Sicilio, Aaron\u2019s arm was grabbed by Sicilio.\n Aaron didn\u2019t move.\n Sicilio took out his cell phone and made a call. In Italian, he informed the doctor to come and get the bullet for Aaron. He hung up and grabbed Aaron\u2019s chin with one hand, forcing him to look up.\n Aaron was frail and his face was pale, but his gray-blue eyes were filled with pride and unwillingness to admit defeat.\n Sicilio lowered his head and he was so close that he was about to kiss Aaron. He told him expressionlessly, \u201cHe abandoned you. He has a new identity and has become a Chinese soldier. He is respected and will be upright wherever he goes... What about you?\u201d\n Aaron\u2019s eyelids quivered slightly but he didn\u2019t answer.\n Sicilio said, \u201cYou are a rat in hell. Your name is still on the list of wanted criminals worldwide. He is the moon high in the sky and you are the mud on the ground. Why bother?\u201d\n Tears welled up in Aaron\u2019s eyes. He looked into Sicilio\u2019s cold, sharp eyes and said, \u201cSicilio, you have been respected and loved since you were young.\u201d Aaron smiled slightly, a very bleak and satisfied smile. He said, \u201cThere are more than 6 billion people in this world, but only he treats me well.\u201d\n Sicilio frowned slightly and released Aaron.\n Step by step, Aaron walked down the stairs. Suddenly, everything went black and he lost consciousness.\n In his daze, he seemed to see Sicilio running over. He thought to himself: Sicilio is my father\u2019s most satisfactory successor. His heart is as cold as a venomous snake. Why would he be worried about me?\n \u2013\n On the day Aaron left China, he sent Han Zhan a message.\n The message said: [Hoff, I am going back. Take good care of your beautiful Song Ci. I will still visit her.]\n Han Zhan deleted this message and told Song Ci, \u201cAaron left.\u201d\n At that moment, Song Ci was folding the babies\u2019 clothes. Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, Song Ci felt relieved. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d With Aaron gone, Han Zhan was no longer in danger.\n Song Ci said to Han Zhan, \u201cBeibei fell yesterday and suffered a major hemorrhage. Isn\u2019t she hospitalized? I intend to visit her. Brother Han, will you come with me?\u201d\n Li Li had laid the floor tiles in the living room. When Su Beibei was awake during the day, Mother Li didn\u2019t dare to mop the floor, afraid that Su Beibei would slip and fall. Last night, before sleeping, Li Li\u2019s mother had mopped the entire living room as usual. Perhaps she was tired and went to bed without drying it.\n Su Beibei went to the kitchen to drink some water out of thirst, but unfortunately slipped.\n Hearing Su Beibei\u2019s shout, Mother Li woke up in shock and hurried to the living room to take a look. Seeing Su Beibei lying on the floor with blood dripping from her lower body, Mother Li nearly fainted on the spot.\n Su Beibei was the calmest. She calmly instructed Mother Li to call the ambulance. Luckily, there was a Traditional Chinese Medicine hospital nearby. Su Beibei arrived at the hospital in time. After emergency treatment, she successfully stopped the bleeding and saved herself and the child.\n However, Su Beibei had to rest in bed for a week. After she was discharged and returned home, she had to rest in bed for a period of time. The doctor said that in her condition, she was afraid of her giving birth prematurely. If the child could stay in her mother\u2019s tummy for one more day, then so be it.\n Li Li had gone to Japan on a work trip the day before yesterday and was rushing home today. He still needed two hours to get home. Due to Aaron, Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to go out. Hearing that Aaron had gone back, Song Ci naturally had to go to the hospital to visit Su Beibei.\n Of course Han Zhan wanted to go along. \u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201d\n Without dinner, Han Zhan brought Song Ci to the hospital.\n When they arrived, Su Beibei was alone in bed. She had already fallen asleep.\n After a near-death experience last night, Su Beibei\u2019s face was pale and she looked very haggard. Hearing the commotion, the light sleeper Su Beibei woke up.\n Seeing that it was Song Ci and Han Zhan, Su Beibei smiled reassuringly at Song Ci. Without waiting for Song Ci to comfort her, she smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the child is saved and I am fine.\u201d\n As a mother, Song Ci felt rather upset when she heard Su Beibei\u2019s words.\n She walked over to the bed and sat down. She grabbed Su Beibei\u2019s hand. Perhaps it was because she had lost too much blood, but Su Beibei\u2019s hand was cold. Song Ci shielded her hands in her own. She said, \u201cYou have suffered.\u201d\n Su Beibei shook her head. \u201cI was too careless.\u201d\n \u201cSigh, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault.\u201d Not seeing Mother Li, Song Ci asked Su Beibei, \u201cWhere\u2019s Auntie?\u201d\n ]\u201dMother was shocked last night. I asked her to go back and rest in the afternoon. Anyway, Li Li will be back soon.\u201d Mother Li had just undergone an operation last year. Although she was recovering well, she was not as good as before the operation.\n Last night, Su Beibei bled profusely and nearly lost her child. Mother Li blamed herself and felt guilty. Today, she had been wiping her tears and her eyes were red. Worried that her mother-in-law would cry her eyes out, Su Beibei scolded her and sent her home to rest.\n \u201cShe should go back and rest more.\u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my psychological effect or if I scared the child last night, but he doesn\u2019t move much today.\u201d Su Beibei had a fetal heart monitor beside her. She said, \u201cIf not for the fact that everything is normal with the fetal heart monitor, I would really be worried about the child...\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly said, \u201cThe child is doing well. He knows that you are feeling terrible and wants to be more obedient. He can\u2019t bear to torture you.\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci, your words are so nice.\u201d\n Su Beibei and Song Ci were chatting. Han Zhan couldn\u2019t interrupt them alone, so he walked alone to the corridor of the hospital and stood there. Before long, he saw Li Li rushing over.\n Li Li\u2019s clothes were wrinkled and he even had a beard. It was obvious that after receiving the news, he immediately arranged his work and flew back to China.\n Seeing Han Zhan by the corridor, Li Li greeted him with a nod and hurried to the ward.\n Han Zhan also entered the ward and saw that Li Li and Su Beibei had reunited after a disaster. They were obviously going to hug and kiss.\n Han Zhan pulled Song Ci\u2019s hand and said to Su Beibei, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. Song Ci and I will go back first. Beibei, have a good rest. We will come visit you another day.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, drive safely.\u201d\n Han Zhan brought Song Ci home.\n The next morning, Song Ci was still sleeping when she heard the sound of a truck downstairs. Song Ci woke up and walked to the window in surprise. She looked downstairs and saw several workers carrying things.\n Zhong Buhui and Grandpa were standing in front of the van, talking to the workers.\n Song Ci took off her pyjamas, changed into casual clothes, and went downstairs. She went to the front yard, walked up to Han Aoyu, and asked him, \u201cGrandpa, what are you doing?\u201d\n Han Aoyu hurriedly took off his hat and put it on for Song Ci. He said, \u201cThese masters are here to put up wooden floors.\u201d\n \u201cWooden flooring?\u201d Han Aoyu\u2019s house had been around for many years. In that era, he loved to stick those fancy patterned floor tiles. It felt very western.\n Han Zhan suddenly decided to change the wooden floor. He must have been shocked by Su Beibei\u2019s fall.\n Six to seven renovation workers arrived. In just half a day, they had covered every corner of the room with solid wood flooring. The floor was the best brand and they were not worried that formaldehyde would exceed the limit.\n The house was pasted with wooden floors and one could use vacuum cleaners for mopping the floor. Old Master was used to using mops and was not used to using vacuum cleaners. He got a new vacuum cleaner and played with it for half an hour on the dust-free floor. He even got Song Ci to record it for him.\n It was said that old children were old. Even a person like Han Aoyu would have such a childish side when he was old.\n Song Ci took a video of Old Master mopping the floor.\n After getting sick of studying new things, Han Aoyu suddenly said to Song Ci, \u201cLass Song, call your elder sister and the rest and ask if they are free to come over for dinner tonight.\u201d\n \u201cMmm? Is today some special day, Grandpa?\u201d Song Ci asked.\n Old Master said, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. As your in-laws, we still have to invite your maternal family over for a meal occasionally. It happens to be Friday today and Yan Jiang should be on vacation tomorrow. It won\u2019t affect his work if he comes over tonight.\u201d\n Since the old man had already spoken, Song Ci naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse. \u201cGrandpa, wait a minute, I\u2019ll call and ask.\u201d\n Song Ci called Yan Jiang and told him about this.\n Yan Jiang was about to knock off when he received a call from Song Ci. How could he refuse? \u201cTell Old Master that Song Fei and I will definitely be there on time.\u201d Just as he was about to hang up, Yan Jiang asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat does Grandpa like to eat? Or something he likes to eat? I can\u2019t possibly go empty-handed.\u201d\n Song Ci thought for a moment before saying, \u201cCan you get loaches? Grandpa said he wants to drink loach soup.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll think of a way.\u201d\n After hanging up, Song Ci told Han Aoyu, \u201cMy elder sister and Yan Jiang are both free. He will fetch my elder sister over after work.\u201d Song Ci walked into the kitchen and saw that there were still many ingredients at home. She rolled up her sleeves and prepared dinner with Zhong Buhui.\n Old Master also joined in and prepared to make a few of his best dishes, so that he could show off in front of Song Ci\u2019s family.\n When Han Zhan returned from work, he happened to bump into Yan Jiang\u2019s car at the foot of the hill.\n Song Fei was driving.\n Seeing Han Zhan\u2019s car, Song Fei honked at Han Zhan, stepped on the accelerator, and sped off like a rocket. Han Zhan stared at the Hummer that disappeared in a flash, his heart very calm. As a prospective father, Han Zhan disdained to participate in Song Fei\u2019s game.\n By the time Han Zhan arrived at the villa, Song Fei was already chatting with Old Master.\n Han Zhan alighted and complained to Song Ci. \u201cBaby Ci, Sister Fei is racing.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci widened her eyes and turned to educate Song Fei. \u201cSong Fei, you promised me not to race! Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s very dangerous to drive too fast? This is a mountain road. If anything happens to you, what will we do?!\u201d\n Song Fei didn\u2019t retort or admit her mistake. She obediently accepted the scolding like a block of wood.\n Song Ci\u2019s mouth was already dry from talking. Seeing that Song Fei still had that lazy expression on her face, she felt as if her hot blood had hit cotton and instantly felt slightly discouraged. \u201cForget it, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t listen to me.\u201d\n At the side, Yan Jiang had yet to recover from his motion sickness. He was holding a glass of water and sitting on a wooden chair, resting his forehead on his hand.\n Looking at Yan Jiang\u2019s half-dead manner, Song Ci felt that he was very pitiful.\n Song Ci pointed at Yan Jiang and said to Song Fei, \u201cLook at Ah Jiang. He is so dizzy. Do you love him or not? If you love him, how can you bear to let him suffer?\u201d\n Only then did Song Fei glance at Yan Jiang.\n Only when she saw that Yan Jiang was holding his forehead and looking very uncomfortable did she realize that he was actually carsick. Song Fei said guiltily, \u201cI thought he felt that it was exciting and fun...\u201d\n Yan Jiang was also speechless when he heard this. He looked up and revealed a pale face. He asked Song Fei weakly, \u201cDo I look like I find it exciting and fun?\u201d\n Song Fei was speechless.\n After a moment, she admitted her mistake. \u201cI won\u2019t drive fast in the future.\u201d\n \u201cIt better be!\u201d\n That night, Han Aoyu made a pot of loach soup and cooked it for a long time with tofu. It was delicious and so was the soup.\n Song Ci drank a bowl of soup and saw that Song Fei was staring at her. She put down the bowl and bragged to Song Fei proudly. \u201cSong Fei, are you very envious of me?\u201d\n Envious that I have a good grandfather who can cook.\n Song Fei stroked her chin and said, \u201cSong Ci, have you weighed yourself recently?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s expression froze slightly.\n Song Fei said, \u201cYou already have a double chin.\u201d\n Song Ci felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She suddenly felt that the food in front of her was no longer fragrant.\n Han Aoyu acknowledged Song Fei and said, \u201cSong Fei, you\u2019re wrong. Song Ci isn\u2019t eating alone. Her food and nutrients are all for the two in her tummy.\u201d\n \u201cYou, on the other hand.\u201d Han Aoyu picked up a piece of pork trotter and placed it in Song Fei\u2019s bowl. He scolded her. \u201cDo you not like to eat? Are you very picky? Look at you. Your arms are so skinny that I can break one of them.\u201d\n \u201cEat more. You\u2019ll look better if you gain some weight.\u201d\n Song Fei dared to be arrogant to anyone, but in front of Han Aoyu, she had to tuck her tail between her legs.\n Song Fei finished that pork trotter and was full.\n But Han Aoyu seemed to really like Song Fei. He kept putting food into her bowl with the chopsticks and said, \u201cLass Song said you like meat. Grandpa specially made a lot of meat for you today. Try them all.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Fei, who didn\u2019t like meat, secretly stretched out her leg and kicked Song Ci.\n Zhong Buhui suddenly put down his bowl and asked in a daze, \u201cWho kicked me?\u201d\n Song Fei was speechless.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle Zhong. I accidentally kicked you just now.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang tugged at Song Fei\u2019s sleeve to calm her down. He didn\u2019t want Han Aoyu to feel that Song Ci\u2019s family was unreliable.\n After dinner, Han Aoyu invited Song Fei and the rest to stay over.\n Thinking that they had nothing to do tomorrow, Song Fei and Yan Jiang stayed behind. At night, Han Aoyu, Han Zhan, Song Ci, Song Fei, and Yan Jiang sat on the wooden floor and played cards.\n Not only was Han Aoyu good at fighting wars, he was also an expert at playing Fight the Landlord.\n But no matter how good an expert was, if he met Song Fei who knew how to play cards, he could only admit defeat. Han Aoyu played a few rounds and felt embarrassed, so he returned to his room to sleep.\n With Old Master\u2019s departure, the four of them had gone overboard.\n The four of them didn\u2019t have any cash and opened WeChat. The winners and losers all transferred their money via Wechat.\n Song Fei didn\u2019t have good cards, but she had a good memory and could always accurately grasp the opponent\u2019s cards at the last few steps.\n So every time Song Fei was the landlord, she would win.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t have a good memory, but he was very good at playing cards and could often kill the other three.\n They played until 12.30pm. Song Ci was really sleepy. She threw down the last card in her hand and said, \u201cI have to go to bed. The three of you play.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan and the other two played until past 3am. When they were hungry, Han Zhan went to the kitchen to cook another pot of noodles. The three of them ate before returning to their respective rooms to rest.\n The next morning, the four of them slept until late in the morning.\n After having lunch at the villa, Yan Jiang and Song Fei bid farewell.\n On the way, Song Fei received a call from Fu Hanshen.\n \u201cSong Fei, are you free recently?\u201d Fu Hanshen had just returned from Africa and hadn\u2019t rested since returning. His voice sounded very fatigued.\n \u201cYes, Teacher. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Fu Hanshen said, \u201cI brought back a few special samples of the Ebola virus this time. Can you come over and collaborate with the teacher to study them? I have a feeling that we are very likely to conquer this virus this time!\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s heartbeat quickened. \u201cTeacher, are you very confident?\u201d\n \u201cSome time ago, a local town suffered from a plague. At that time, we happened to be there and helped to control the plague. The research institute brought back several samples of mice. Our preliminary examination revealed that among those mice, there were actually five mice that carried an unknown virus that was very similar to the structure of the Ebola virus.\u201d\n \u201cSo I reasonably suspect that the Ebola virus is very likely to be infected from the mice. So I hope you can come.\u201d\n \u201cI need you.\u201d\n Fu Hanshen had to admit that talent was something that could only be chanced upon by luck. Song Fei was someone who could always surprise Fu Hanshen. Fu Hanshen felt that with Song Fei around, the research would definitely achieve results sooner.\n Song Fei and Fu Hanshen had been researching this virus together for so many years. How could she bear to abandon it? After hearing Fu Hanshen\u2019s description, Song Fei\u2019s heartbeat quickened.\n If he could really find the connection between the rat virus and the Ebola virus, he could use their connection as an entry point to research the antidote to the virus.\n All these years, everyone had been like a headless fly, helpless against the Ebola virus. The mortality rate of people infected with this virus was as high as 90%. How many people died in the end because they missed the best treatment time?\n If they could successfully develop the antidote, how many patients would they save?\n In the past, Song Fei would have agreed to Fu Hanshen\u2019s request, grabbed her bag, and sprinted towards the city where he was. But now, she was no longer alone.\n \u201cTeacher, I will reply to you later.\u201d\n Fu Hanshen was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cSong Fei, don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d\n Song Fei hung up.\n Yan Jiang knew that Song Fei was looking at him. He had also heard Fu Hanshen\u2019s words just now. Yan Jiang suddenly stopped the car and turned to look at Song Fei, who was hesitating to speak.\n \u201cYou are very smart,\u201d Yan Jiang said.\n Song Fei frowned but didn\u2019t answer.\n Yan Jiang added. \u201cAh Fei, you\u2019re so smart. You can\u2019t be hidden by me at home. I... I still refuse to let you leave Wangdong City and somewhere that I can\u2019t see. But...\u201d\n Yan Jiang grabbed Song Fei\u2019s hand and smiled at her in relief. \u201cThe person I love has always been the carefree and unrestrained Song Fei. The Song Fei who is locked up by my side is the incomplete Song Fei who has lost her dreams and pursuits. So...\u201d\n Yan Jiang lowered his head and kissed Song Fei\u2019s fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll let you go.\u201d\n \u201cBut you must come back.\u201d\n A mesmerizing smile appeared on Song Fei\u2019s cold and beautiful face. She pulled her hand out of Yan Jiang\u2019s grasp, hugged his neck, pulled his face to her, and kissed him.\n There was no hint of lust in this kiss.\n \u201cYan Jiang, thank you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang clenched his fists before loosening them.\n He had to try to let Song Fei go. The psychologist said that loving someone meant helping her soar, not trapping her there.\n Song Fei packed up and went to the airport that afternoon. Yan Jiang personally sent her there.\n Since Yan Jiang had nothing to do during the weekend, he returned to the police station to work.\n That night, after he got off work, he called Song Fei. The two of them chatted for more than 10 minutes before Song Fei hung up and returned to work.\n Yan Jiang was playing games alone at home.\n Without Song Fei around, Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t fall asleep again.\n Wei Lai suddenly sent Yan Jiang a WeChat video. Yan Jiang accepted the video and stared at the laser television with his fingers on the controller\u2019s game controller. He didn\u2019t even have the time to look at Wei Lai.\n There was also someone talking on Wei Lai\u2019s end. He walked to a quieter spot and asked Yan Jiang, \u201cAre you playing games?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Yan Jiang lost a head and heard Wei Lai say, \u201cWe are short of one person in the Great Wall. Are you coming?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was about to reject him, when he remembered that Song Fei was not at home. He looked away from the game, picked up his cell phone, and stared at Wei Lai\u2019s background for a while before saying, \u201cYou are in the AK Card Room?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, Zhong Xiangshou, Xu Yi, and Liu Zhouyang are all here waiting for you.\u201d These were all Yan Jiang\u2019s old friends.\n Hearing that Liu Zhouyang was also there, Yan Jiang said, \u201cWait, I will come.\u201d\n Yan Jiang changed his clothes and drove to the AK Card Room.\n The AK Card Room, AK Shooting Club, and AK Music Hall were all in the same building. It was an entertainment venue owned by the same boss.\n The card room was on the sixth floor. Yan Jiang went straight to the sixth floor via the side door.\n He walked out of the lift. He was wearing a black, white blouse inside a light grey suit. He was wearing chain glasses and his long hair that reached past his ears was casually grabbed at the back and tied casually with a disposable rubber band.\n Along the way, those female players were all staring at him.\n A man bit his cigarette and stared at Yan Jiang\u2019s tall and handsome figure. He sounded rather resigned. \u201cDamn, why is Brotheer Beautiful here? This person has retired from the entertainment circles. Why is he still so handsome? How can we accept this?\u201d\n \u201cI heard that he went to be a forensic doctor and deals with dead people everyday.\u201d A woman rubbed her arms in admiration and fear. \u201cHe\u2019s a ruthless person.\u201d\n Vicious Yan Jiang circled outside and successfully attracted the attention of all his friends, before entering the private room.\n Wei Lai and the rest had been waiting for a long time and started shuffling the cards the moment he arrived.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you. Sit!\u201d\n Yan Jiang sat down boldly, crossed his legs, and started arranging the mahjong tiles.\n Yan Jiang casually played his cards as well. He stared at Liu Zhouyang and said, \u201cYangyang, the CEO of Empire Entertainment looks younger than I expected.\u201d\n Liu Zhouyang was slightly surprised. He asked Yan Jiang, \u201cYou\u2019ve met our CEO Yan?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, we met once some time ago.\u201d\n Liu Zhouyang said, \u201cOur CEO Yan is preparing to step down and retire. I heard he\u2019s not feeling well. He hasn\u2019t appeared much in recent years. I\u2019ve been in the company for so many years and have only seen him once at the annual party.\u201d\n Liu Zhouyang said proudly, \u201cWhen our CEO Yan was young, he would definitely beat Brother Guanxi up.\u201d\n Yan Jiang smiled noncommittally.\n \u201cWhat happened to CEO Yan\u2019s health?\u201d Yan Jiang asked casually.\n Liu Zhouyang shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Someone said that our Director Yan seems to be seriously ill and needs treatment.\u201d\n Yan Jiang panicked for a moment before asking, \u201cDo you know what illness it is?\u201d\n \u201cThey definitely have to keep this a secret.\u201d\n Yan Jiang acknowledged.\n After one round, Yan Jiang took a cigarette from the cigarette box in front of Wei Lai. Just as he bit it, Zhong Xiangshou lit his lighter and leaned over to light Yan Jiang\u2019s cigarette.\n He was attentive and flattering.\n Yan Jiang took a drag of his cigarette and glanced sideways. He smiled at Zhong Xiangshou. \u201cDon\u2019t light a fire for me. You don\u2019t have the right to extinguish it for me.\u201d\n Zhong Xiangshou didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cWhy are you still talking dirty? Does your fianc\u00e9e know your true colors?\u201d\n In front of Song Fei, Yan Jiang was a coward. He didn\u2019t dare to speak dirty in front of her.\n \u201cOh yes, Yangyang, if Director Yan abdicates, who is the new director of your company?\u201d\n \u201cHis surname is Chen and he looks rather young. I heard he has some capabilities.\u201d\n Zhong Xiangshou threw out a seven cylinder and said mischievously, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have any skills, you can\u2019t sit in that position.\u201d\n \u201cHeh...\u201d Yan Jiang arranged his cards and said,\u201d Someone told me that Director Yan and the late CEO Han have a close relationship? Is this reliable? \u201d\n Hearing this, everyone stopped and looked at him gloomily.\n Yan Jiang looked confused. \u201cWhy are you all looking at me?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d Wei Lai said, \u201cYan Rufeng and Han Chenyi registered their marriage overseas back then. I heard that the current CEO Xiaohan is the child after they registered their marriage.\u201d\n \u201cAt that time, the IVF technique was still not very mature and very expensive. The two of them worked very hard for a long time before finally getting one Han Qingshen.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned. \u201cIs... is that so?\u201d\n Seeing that Yan Jiang\u2019s expression was off, Wei Lai smiled and said, \u201cI thought you knew about this.\u201d This news had already spread throughout the entertainment circles.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI don\u2019t pay much attention to these things.\u201d\n If he loved gossip and listened to them, he wouldn\u2019t have only known that the director of Empire Entertainment was Yan Rufeng that night.\n Yan Jiang took a sip of water to moisten his dry throat before saying, \u201cSo, Director Yan and Hanyi registered their marriage 30 years ago?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Yan Jiang looked down and remained silent.\n No one knew how shocked he was at this moment.\n After playing a few more rounds, Yan Jiang suddenly stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019m a little tired. I\u2019ve recently encountered a major case and haven\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in order to solve it. You guys continue playing. I\u2019ll treat you guys tonight. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was now a forensic doctor and it was not unusual for him to stay up late for work. Hearing his words, Wei Lai and the rest didn\u2019t urge him to stay.\n \u201cLet me send you off.\u201d\n Wei Lai sent Yan Jiang off.\n After entering the lift and seeing that there was no one around, Wei Lai said, \u201cWhat happened between you and Yan Rufeng?\u201d It was too strange for Yan Jiang to frequently mention Yan Rufeng tonight.\n Yan Rufeng and Wei Lai were considered good friends, but he didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about the terrible things that happened between them.\n Moreover, Yan Rufeng didn\u2019t like him. If this matter was passed down, Yan Rufeng might think that he was trying to pull strings with him.\n Yan Jiang shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just seldom see my family name. I happened to meet them that day and realized that Director Yan is also very handsome. I thought that our Yan Family\u2019s genes are really good and that we are all handsome and good looking. Now that I see Liu Zhouyang, I can\u2019t help but ask him a few questions.\u201d\n Weilei was speechless.\n \u201cI finally understand your secret to being able to thrive in the entertainment circles.\u201d Wei Lai put on a mysterious expression.\n Yan Jiang lifted his chin. \u201cTell me, why?\u201d\n Wei Lai said, \u201cYour skin is thick.\u201d\n \u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d\n The lift reached the first floor. Yan Jiang patted Wei Lai\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGo up and play. I am fine. Let\u2019s meet again next time.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n After Wei Lai entered the lift, the smile on Yan Jiang\u2019s face suddenly disappeared.\n Yan Rufeng and the late CEO Han had registered their marriage 30 years ago. Although they got married overseas and weren\u2019t protected by the law, they were soul mates.\n Then what is my mother?\n What am I?\n An illegitimate child?\n Or...\n A child born out of a wedlock that was even more intolerable than an illegitimate child?\n Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t calm down. He didn\u2019t dare to drive as he was afraid of accidents, so he called Ah Lun over. When Ah Lun arrived, Yan Jiang had already fallen asleep in the car. He turned on all the lights and his brows were tightly furrowed as he slept.\n The car door was unlocked. Ah Lun opened the door and sat inside, sending Yan Jiang home.\n The car stopped in the garage in the courtyard. Ah Lun woke Yan Jiang up. \u201cBrother Jiang, you are home.\u201d\n Yan Jiang acknowledged before opening his eyes.\n Perhaps it was an illusion, but Ah Lun seemed to see confusion in Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes.\n Yan Jiang alighted and turned to say to Ah Lun, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. You should sleep here tonight.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Ah Lun woke up and made breakfast. He went upstairs to wake Yan Jiang up and realized that he was not in his room! He ran into the courtyard and realized that an Audi was missing.\n Ah Lun hurriedly called Yan Jiang.\n \u201cBrother Jiang, where are you?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s car was already on the highway. He said, \u201cAh Lun, I am on the way to Feng City. Remember to lock the door when you leave after breakfast.\u201d\n With that, Yan Jiang took off his Bluetooth headset and hung up.\n Seeing that he had driven out of Feng City\u2019s expressway, Yan Jiang changed the lane ahead of time and drove out of the expressway.\n \u2013\n The night in Feng City was slightly chilly. Yan Jiang alighted from the car in a short t-shirt and shivered in the cold. He hurriedly took out his jacket from his bag and put it on. After thinking for a moment, he took out a mask and put it on.\n Yan Jiang entered a shopping mall and asked the security officer to meet their manager. The security officer didn\u2019t agree at first, but Yan Jiang had no choice but to take off his mask. \u201cI am Yan Jiang.\u201d\n Yan Jiang pointed at the promotional photos on the cupboard of a luxury makeup shop on the first level of the mall. He told the security guard, \u201cI am the global spokesperson for Company A\u2019s cosmetics brand.\u201d\n The security guard recognized Yan Jiang.\n Seeing that it was a famous celebrity, the security guard hurriedly took out the walkie-talkie behind his waist and called the manager. Moments later, the manager hurried to the main entrance and invited Yan Jiang to the office upstairs.\n Entering the office, the manager asked Yan Jiang with a smile, \u201cMr. Yan, why are you looking for me?\u201d\n \u201cI am looking for someone.\u201d\n \u201cOh? Who are you looking for?\u201d\n Yan Jiang took out an old photo and handed it to the manager. \u201cIs Nan Yiyi the boss of this mall?\u201d\n The manager stared at the woman in the photo.\n Although the woman in the photo was wearing a simple white dress and had no makeup on, the manager recognized her as his boss, Nan Yiyi.\n The manager nodded. \u201cOur lady boss is indeed called Nan Yiyi. As for whether she is the lady in your photo, I am not sure.\u201d\n Yan Jiang nodded.\n He crossed his arms and leaned back slightly. He closed his eyes and said gently, \u201cManager, please help me contact your boss. Tell her that Yan Jiang wants to meet her.\u201d\n The manager thought for a moment, picked up the phone, and called the boss. \u201cCEO Nan, I have an artist who wants to meet you.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was in the hospital. She wiped the youth\u2019s face with her hand and asked impatiently, \u201cNo! Didn\u2019t I say that I\u2019m not free these few days?\u201d\n The manager was very embarrassed. He looked at Yan Jiang awkwardly. Before he could explain, Yan Jiang said, \u201cTell her that Yan Jiang wants to see her.\u201d\n The manager mustered up the courage and called out to CEO Nan again. \u201cCEO Nan, it\u2019s an actor called Yan Jiang. He specifically asked to meet you.\u201d\n Hearing the name Yan Jiang, Nan Yiyi was stunned.\n \u201cWho... did you say?\u201d Nan Yiyi clutched the cold towel tightly as her eyes quivered slightly.\n The manager said, \u201cYan Jiang.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi closed her eyes.\n \u201cTell him that I will meet him. Help me treat him well first.\u201d\n The manager treated Yan Jiang like a living Buddha and invited him to the meeting room..\n He drank his tea and played with his cell phone, as he waited for an hour. Just as the hour hand was about to turn to 11, Nan Yiyi stood outside the door and knocked on it.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cPlease come in.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi pushed open the door and entered.\n Wearing a blue dress, Nan Yiyi exuded the aura of a successful career woman. But no matter how strong and domineering she was, her face paled at the sight of the handsome young man in front of her.\n Nan Yiyi held the door frame and looked at Yan Jiang\u2019s face. She muttered, \u201cJiang Jiang...\u201d\n Special Note: A few settings have been changed. Firstly, the female protagonist is pregnant with a pair of daughters. Secondly, Ah Rang\u2019s name is unified as Aaron so that it\u2019s convenient for everyone to read. Thirdly, Aaron and Han Zhan are both in 1988.

    "222": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-223\n\n Chapter 222: I Want Your Handsome Face  Yan Jiang slowly looked up and gazed through the light at the woman behind the door.\n Yan Jiang felt slightly dazed.\n In his memory, Nan Yiyi had always been a simple and low-profile woman. She loved to wear white dresses at home and black pants in winter.\n He rarely saw Nan Yiyi dressed up so gorgeously.\n The beautiful and elegant suit made Nan Yiyi look even more charming in it. She must have been a famous beauty when she was younger.\n That made sense. An ugly parent would never have such a handsome man like him.\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart ached when she saw the coldness in Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes.\n This child still hates me.\n Closing the door gently, Nan Yiyi walked up to Yan Jiang slowly, not daring to sit down. Yan Jiang poured a cup of tea for Nan Yiyi and pushed it across the table. Only then did he look up and say to Nan Yiyi, \u201cSit, Ms. Nan. This is your territory.\u201d\n This greeting made Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart break and her expression turn ugly.\n But she didn\u2019t dare to say anything.\n Nan Yiyi still sat down. She sat very upright and straight, like a good student facing the dean.\n Only in front of Yan Jiang would Nan Yiyi be so ashamed that she couldn\u2019t lift her head.\n Picking up the cup of hot tea, Nan Yiyi\u2019s fingers gradually regained their warmth. She took a sip of tea, before calling Yan Jiang\u2019s name anxiously. \u201cJiang Jiang.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Seeing that Yan Jiang was still willing to pay attention to her, Nan Yiyi\u2019s uneasy heart finally relaxed slightly.\n Nan Yiyi gazed greedily at Yan Jiang\u2019s face. Although she had seen this face on computers, cell phones, advertisement posters, and television, seeing her own child up close still felt different.\n She just couldn\u2019t get enough of it.\n Nan Yiyi smiled slightly, looking kind of uneasy. She said, \u201cJiang Jiang, you look even better than when you were young.\u201d\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t want to act out his mother-son relationship with Nan Yiyi.\n His lips curled into a mocking smile as he said curiously to Nan Yiyi, \u201cMs. Nan, I have a question for you.\u201d\n Although the way he addressed her was uncomfortable, Nan Yiyi was very happy that her son was willing to meet her.\n Nan Yiyi maintained her elegant and calm smile as she told Yan Jiang, \u201cYou can ask me anything.\u201d\n Yan Jiang put down the teacup in his hand and looked up. He stared at Nan Yiyi with his mesmerizing peach blossom eyes and said with a faint smile, \u201cSince you mentioned my childhood, let me ask you, Ms. Nan, do you still remember what I looked like when I was young?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was stunned and slightly embarrassed.\n This child was beautiful, but he had long, thin, and sharp thorns.\n Every prick was aimed at her.\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart ached slightly. Her mouth felt like it had been sewn together by needles and she couldn\u2019t open her mouth to answer Yan Jiang\u2019s question.\n Yan Jiang crossed his legs and leaned back in his chair. His gaze landed on Nan Yiyi\u2019s pale lips. Yan Jiang felt grief and indignation. He said, \u201cWhen you left me, I was only 12 years old and a child who had yet to graduate from elementary school. Now, I am almost 27 years old. I am at the age where I can discuss marriage with others.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi bit her lip with her pearly white teeth, unable to retort Yan Jiang\u2019s words.\n He added. \u201cMy father abandoned me, you also abandoned me, and then Grandma also abandoned me. Why doesn\u2019t anyone want me?\u201d\n Somehow, Yan Jiang\u2019s words hit Nan Yiyi\u2019s sore spot. She suddenly broke down and cried.\n \u201cJiang Jiang!\u201d As Nan Yiyi cried, her mucus fell and dirtied her makeup.\n She covered her face with her hands and said to Yan Jiang in tears, \u201cJiang Jiang, I am sorry, but I have no choice. You don\u2019t know that after your father abandoned us, those strangers will gossip about me even when I go out to buy groceries.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi imitated those people\u2019s tone and said in a sarcastic manner, \u201cLook, that woman is the Yan Family\u2019s wife. Her husband abandoned his wife and child and ran off with a pervert!\u201d\n \u201cShe can\u2019t even look after her own husband and was snatched away by a pervert. What a joke.\u201d\n \u201cSo he\u2019d rather find a pervert than spend my life with her...\u201d\n Nan Yiyi looked up and wiped her tears.\n She looked very pained. She pressed her chest and said tearfully, \u201cDuring that period, I would be scolded no matter where I went. The person who did something wrong was your father, but I was the one who was hurt by words!\u201d\n \u201cI really can\u2019t stand it anymore. That place is like a cage to me, a stage, and I am the clown being mocked on the stage!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was pressured by life and couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. As a result, she could only flee from reality.\n Yan Jiang smiled bitterly and asked Nan Yiyi, \u201cYou can escape if you want to. What about me?\u201d\n Those peach blossom eyes gradually turned red as tears shimmered in them. Yan Jiang said, \u201cYou are the wife who was abandoned by your husband, while I am the pervert\u2019s son. You are gone and you are free, but I still have to bear the crime of being a \u2018child whose mother doesn\u2019t even want him\u2019.\u201d\n \u201cYou can escape, but you are free. What about me? Where can I escape to?\u201d\n The more Yan Jiang spoke, the more agitated he became. He gritted his teeth tightly and tightened his muscles, not allowing himself to cry in front of Nan Yiyi.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes were deep and dark. He said, \u201cMother, if I had known that I would be abandoned all my life, I really wish that you two didn\u2019t have me from the start.\u201d\n \u201cI am like a lonely ghost.\u201d My parents are still alive, but no one doted on me.\n Nan Yiyi was sobbing so hard that she was out of breath and unable to speak. Guilt and remorse weighed heavily on her back as she bent over.\n Covering her face, Nan Yiyi apologized tearfully. \u201cJiang Jiang, I am sorry!\u201d\n Yan Jiang remained unmoved by Nan Yiyi\u2019s apology.\n After so many years of being mocked and ridiculed how could he let it all go with just Nan Yiyi\u2019s apology?\n Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t forgive Nan Yiyi. Looking at his tear-streaked mother, Yan Jiang finally asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring me along? Did you think I was a burden and would hinder you from marrying someone else?\u201d\n Hearing this, Nan Yiyi shook her head.\n She cried as she said, \u201cNo, Jiang Jiang. You were never a burden. I was just afraid that you wouldn\u2019t live well with me. At that time, I was a housewife and I couldn\u2019t even support myself. How could I dare to bring you along? I can\u2019t let you suffer with me!\u201d\n Yan Jiang shook his head. \u201cYou will never understand what I want.\u201d\n He was not afraid of suffering. He was afraid of becoming an orphan and being loved by no one!\n He was afraid of being alone!\n Yan Jiang asked again, \u201cIt\u2019s tough being with you. Am I not going to suffer following an old woman who has bad eyesight and needs a walking stick?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was stumped by Yan Jiang\u2019s words.\n \u201cIn the end, you still despise me.\u201d Yan Jiang knew all of this very well.\n ]Nan Yiyi blushed in embarrassment.\n Yan Jiang suddenly added. \u201cI was awake the night you escaped.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi looked up in shock and instinctively said, \u201cHow can that be? I clearly gave you sleeping pills...\u201d Realizing how rebellious her next words were for a mother, Nan Yiyi hurriedly covered her mouth and was too embarrassed to continue.\n Yan Jiang sneered. \u201cSleeping pills?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s face was deathly pale. Even her tears were forced back.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI saw it.\u201d\n \u201cWhat...\u201d Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t understand what Yan Jiang meant and asked,\u201d What did you see? \u201d\n Yan Jiang narrated expressionlessly. \u201cI saw you hiding in the kitchen and secretly pouring sleeping pills into my bowl. You held a pair of chopsticks and mixed them evenly...\u201d\n Nan Yiyi listened in a daze, as if she was stunned.\n \u201cI ate that bowl of rice so that you can rest assured. While you were washing the dishes, I turned around and went to the toilet to urge myself to vomit.\u201d\n Yan Jiang recalled that night carefully. As it had been so many years, Yan Jiang\u2019s memory was not very clear.\n He slowly told her what he remembered.\n \u201cThat night, I laid in my own room with my eyes closed and listened to you quietly packing up in the room next door. I heard you open the door and go to the living room, as if you were rummaging through something. I got up and hid in the dark room. Through the gap of the door, I saw you rummaging through the television cabinet in the living room for banknotes.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was stunned.\n What Yan Jiang said was exactly the same as what I did that night!\n He really saw it!\n A child was hiding in the dark, secretly observing his own mother packing her luggage and searching for her passbook to run away from home. How despondent and angry he must be!\n Nan Yiyi started to feel uneasy and felt too ashamed to face Yan Jiang.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know, right?\u201d Yan Jiang saw how Nan Yiyi looked like she was sitting on a carpet of needles. He grinned mischievously with a cunning smile. \u201cI was the one who hid the passbook.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was slightly surprised.\n That night, when she couldn\u2019t find the passbook, Nan Yiyi thought that her mother-in-law had kept it.\n So it was Yan Jiang.\n \u201cWhen my father ran away, he even knew to throw some money at home. You are even more ruthless than him. You want to steal the money.\u201d\n As he reminisced about the past, Yan Jiang felt that he had a tragic background and could come up with a tragic novel.\n He took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it in his mouth, and puffed in front of Nan Yiyi.\n In the smoke, Yan Jiang\u2019s face was extremely beautiful, but it was filled with sorrow.\n He just looked up slightly and glanced at Nan Yiyi arrogantly. There was mockery, disdain, and contempt in his eyes.\n Nan Yiyi was utterly embarrassed in front of Yan Jiang.\n ]Her hands intertwined uneasily as she defended herself softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to take all the money. I just want to take some travel and living expenses.\u201d\n \u201cStop lying. You clearly want to steal all our assets.\u201d Yan Jiang knew very well that a woman who could abandon her son would naturally do the same thing.\n Nan Yiyi raised her voice. \u201cI really didn\u2019t have such thoughts!\u201d\n \u201cMother, can you stop lying to yourself? It\u2019s not so difficult to admit that you are a selfish woman.\u201d All these years, Yan Jiang had already seen through Nan Yiyi\u2019s true colors.\n Nan Yiyi still felt indignant. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed my fault for abandoning you, but I\u2019m not really indifferent to you. When you were in junior high school and high school, I also sent you some money!\u201d\n Sending money to Yan Jiang was Nan Yiyi\u2019s consolation to herself.\n She said, \u201cMy heart still dotes on you, Jiang Jiang!\u201d\n Yan Jiang sneered. \u201cYes, you sent me a total of 50,000 yuan. Now, it\u2019s still buried in the cenotaph I erected for you.\u201d Yan Jiang bit his cigarette and reached out his hands. He opened them and measured the thickness. \u201c50,000 yuan is really a lot. It\u2019s about the thickness of two tofu.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said exaggeratedly, \u201cReally. I have never seen more than 50,000 yuan in my life.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was shocked by Yan Jiang\u2019s rebellious words.\n \u201cA... a cenotaph?\u201d Nan Yiyi\u2019s voice was much higher, perhaps due to anger or fear. It was sharp and piercing. \u201cI am not dead yet, why did you make a cenotaph for me!\u201d\n Yan Jiang sneered.\n \u201cIn my heart, Yan Rufeng and Nan Yiyi died in 2006. After all, we are family. How can I not erect a tomb for my parents? If I can\u2019t find their bodies, there should be a cenotaph.\u201d\n Looking at Nan Yiyi in amusement, Yan Jiang asked her, \u201cDon\u2019t you think so?\u201d\n These words sent chills down Nan Yiyi\u2019s spine.\n She was so angry that her neck had become thicker. She looked like she wanted to scold Yan Jiang, but she held it in as she was afraid of something unknown.\n Nan Yiyi drank the tea to calm her racing heart.\n Nan Yiyi spoke again in that gentle tone. \u201cJiang Jiang, blame your father. He forced me!\u201d Nan Yiyi hated Yan Rufeng even more than the surging river.\n It was definitely right to push all the blame onto Yan Rufeng.\n Yan Jiang remained silent.\n Nan Yiyi suddenly smiled and said affectionately, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for you to come to Feng City and it\u2019s getting late, Jiang Jiang. Look, let\u2019s stay at my house tonight. Stay for a few more days. I haven\u2019t seen you in so many years and want to accompany you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang rejected immediately. \u201cI booked a room at the hotel.\u201d\n \u201cThen...\u201d Nan Yiyi glanced at Yan Jiang fearfully. Seeing that he was still rather calm, Nan Yiyi boldly invited him.\u201d How about this? Can you come to my house for a meal tomorrow? \u201d\n \u201cI remember that you loved to eat Mother\u2019s food when you were young. I will make a meal for you tomorrow. Just treat it as fulfilling my wish, alright?\u201d\n Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t bear to harshly reject Nan Yiyi\u2019s cautious manner.\n This person was still his mother.\n She was guilty, but she gave birth to him and raised him for 12 years.\n He couldn\u2019t ignore the kindness of raising him.\n Moreover, if not for Yan Rufeng\u2019s earth-shattering behavior that made Nan Yiyi utterly disappointed, their relationship as mother and son wouldn\u2019t be as ugly as it was now.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n But Nan Yiyi tacitly took it as Yan Jiang had agreed and was overjoyed.\n The next morning, Nan Yiyi woke up early and went to the seafood market to buy a lot of seafood and chicken feet. When he was young, Yan Jiang loved to eat braised chicken feet and scrambled eggs made by Nan Yiyi.\n Returning home, Nan Yiyi took a photo of the chicken feet and sent it to Yan Jiang in a message. She said: [Jiang Jiang, don\u2019t you like my braised chicken feet the most? I bought half a kilogram of chicken feet. Come over for lunch today, alright?]\n She sent another message with her address.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t sleep well that night and woke up early. After receiving Nan Yiyi\u2019s message, he hesitated for a long time. In the end, he changed his clothes and put on a face mask before going to Nan Yiyi\u2019s house.\n Hearing the doorbell, Nan Yiyi hurriedly took off her gloves and ran over to open the door in surprise. Seeing that it was really Yan Jiang standing outside the door, a sincere and happy smile spread across Nan Yiyi\u2019s face.\n \u201cJiang Jiang, come in quickly.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi pulled Yan Jiang into the house and realized that there was a beautifully wrapped bouquet of carnations by the corner of the door.\n Nan Yiyi glanced at Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s ears were red as he lowered his head to change shoes.\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart warmed. She walked out of the door, bent over, picked up the carnations on the floor, and entered the house. Yan Jiang put on his shoes and looked up. He saw Nan Yiyi carrying a bouquet of carnations and smiling at him, looking very touched.\n Yan Jiang tried to cover it up. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy it. I wonder who placed it at the door.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi suppressed her laughter and nodded. \u201cMmm, maybe the property management is sending warmth.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Yan Jiang entered Nan Yiyi\u2019s house and saw that she was staying in a three-bedroom apartment. The house was very clean and there were no signs of a man living there. He couldn\u2019t help feeling puzzled.\n Is she not married?\n Yan Jiang had never investigated Nan Yiyi and didn\u2019t know what kind of life she was living now.\n In high school, Nan Yiyi had once written a letter to Yan Jiang, sent him money, and told him her family address. Nan Yiyi had no face to meet Yan Jiang again, but she told him about her home, hoping that he would take the initiative to meet her one day.\n Yan Jiang stared at the overly clean house and asked Nan Yiyi in surprise, \u201cHave you never gotten married all these years?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi said, \u201cIt\u2019s boring. Marriage is tiring.\u201d\n It must be because that marriage back then had hurt Nan Yiyi all over, so she didn\u2019t dare to touch the marriage again easily. Yan Jiang didn\u2019t ask further about this.\n After entering the house, Yan Jiang sat on the sofa. Nan Yiyi turned on the television for him and eagerly brought him a plate of cut fruits.\n Everything was fine and she was very polite, as if she was treating him as an important guest.\n And they were actually mother and son.\n \u201cThe food is ready. I will go and bring it out now.\u201d Nan Yiyi placed the dishes on the table, took off her apron, and waved at Yan Jiang. \u201cJiang Jiang, come over and eat.\u201d\n Yan Jiang turned off the television, got up, and walked to the dining room.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes burned slightly when he saw the table full of his favorite dishes.\n He sat down and picked up the bowl. Nan Yiyi eagerly picked up a chicken claw for him. \u201cThis is your favorite. I put pepper and chili in it. Try it.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, thank you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang took a bite of the braised chicken feet. The spicy and fragrant braised chicken feet were so delicious that he felt like crying.\n \u201cHow is it? Are my culinary skills alright?\u201d Nan Yiyi asked him expectantly.\n Yan Jiang looked down and said in a low voice, \u201cI don\u2019t remember what the chicken feet tasted like in the past.\u201d It had been more than 10 years and his taste buds had long forgotten about that delicacy.\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s smile froze.\n She sat down awkwardly and occasionally glanced at Yan Jiang with an uneasy expression, like a child who had said something wrong.\n Yan Jiang ate quietly and didn\u2019t say anything.\n Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t bear to waste every minute and second she spent with Yan Jiang. She searched for another topic. \u201cI see that you are wearing a ring. Are you engaged?\u201d\n Yan Jiang glanced at the ring on his finger and acknowledged. \u201cI am engaged.\u201d\n \u201cFiancee, is that the female virus specialist who went on Weibo with you previously? Is her name... Song Fei?\u201d Nan Yiyi had been paying attention to Yan Jiang all the time. Nan Yiyi knew all about some major things that happened to Yan Jiang last year.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s high-profile pursuit of the virus specialist Song Fei had also caused a stir.\n Yan Jiang finally looked up at Nan Yiyi. \u201cYou know her?\u201d\n Seeing that her son\u2019s eyes lit up at the mention of Song Fei, Nan Yiyi suppressed her laughter and said, \u201cHow could I not know? Last year, the incident between Song Fei and the chairman of Chao Yang Company caused quite a stir. Everyone in Feng City was talking about it.\u201d\n \u201cOh I see.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi felt that Song Fei\u2019s name sounded familiar. She thought for a moment and asked Yan Jiang uncertainly, \u201cThis lady Song Fei...\u201d\n Yan Jiang looked up at her in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Thinking that Nan Yiyi was not satisfied with Song Fei, Yan Jiang\u2019s voice turned several degrees colder.\n Nan Yiyi could tell that Yan Jiang was displeased and knew that he had misunderstood.\n Nan Yiyi hurriedly explained. \u201cI don\u2019t mean anything else. I also like the girl you like. I just wanted to ask you, is Song Fei the girl who stayed next door to our house back then? Isn\u2019t there an exceptionally smart and solitary girl among those twin girls? Is her name Song Fei? Hey, is Song Fei the elder or younger sister?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s expression softened slightly. \u201cThe elder sister is Song Fei and the younger sister is Song Ci.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t really know their names. I remember that you two didn\u2019t speak much when you were young. Now you two are a couple.\u201d Nan Yiyi\u2019s face was filled with a mocking smile. \u201cWhen did you fall for that lady?\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s face turned red. He said in a low voice, \u201cAfter Grandma passed away, my relationship with the neighbor next door became intimate. Song Fei is a very good person and isn\u2019t solitary at all. She often helped me then.\u201d\n Hearing Yan Jiang\u2019s protective intentions towards Song Fei, Nan Yiyi smiled ambiguously and said, \u201cI am relieved.\u201d\n After dinner, Nan Yiyi urged Yan Jiang to stay for dinner.\n Yan Jiang took three days off this time and had nothing to do, so he stayed behind.\n Actually, he couldn\u2019t bear to leave. Even if Nan Yiyi had abandoned him back then and he hated her, he still loved her at the same time.\n No child could bear to reject their mother\u2019s invitation.\n Sitting on the sofa, Nan Yiyi asked Yan Jiang about his current job. \u201cWhat is your current job?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m a forensic doctor.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good. I remember you learned this in university.\u201d\n \u201cYou know?\u201d Yan Jiang asked.\n Nan Yiyi acknowledged sheepishly. \u201cOf course I know. I also secretly went back to visit you a few times.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s expression was nonchalant, but he was very happy.\n It turned out that Nan Yiyi still had him in her own heart.\n This realization warmed Yan Jiang\u2019s heart slightly.\n Song Fei knew that Yan Jiang was going to Nan Yiyi\u2019s house for dinner today. Worried about the situation there, she sent Yan Jiang a message during her break.\n Ah Fei: [How\u2019s the progress?]\n Yan Jiang glanced at Nan Yiyi, who was washing fruits in the kitchen. He told Song Fei: [Not bad. We had lunch and chatted. She asked me to stay for dinner.]\n Song Fei: [Go have dinner then. It\u2019s not easy to meet her.]\n Yan Jiang: [Okay.]\n Nan Yiyi brought over the freshly washed crystal grapes. Seeing Yan Jiang\u2019s gentle gaze on his cell phone and his fingers typing rapidly on the screen, she understood. \u201cYou must be chatting with Song Fei.\u201d\n Yan Jiang kept his cell phone and acknowledged.\n \u201cI want to sleep for a while.\u201d Yan Jiang had recently developed the habit of taking an afternoon nap. He just needed to sleep for 15 minutes.\n Nan Yiyi said, \u201cI have a guest room at home with bedsheets laid out. Come, I will bring you there.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi brought Yan Jiang to the guest room.\n The bedsheets were navy blue.\n When Yan Jiang was young, he loved a navy blue sailboat bedsheet. He slept on it for several years and washed it too many times, before changing it when it turned white.\n Yan Jiang felt a lump in his throat as he looked at the dark blue bedsheets.\n \u201cI am going to bed. You should rest too.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After Nan Yiyi left, Yan Jiang laid down on the bed and successfully fell asleep.\n Yan Jiang woke up and realized that Nan Yiyi was not in the living room. Thinking that she was sleeping in the master bedroom, he turned on the television and watched an interesting movie.\n ]Just as the movie was about to end, the door was suddenly opened from the outside.\n Yan Jiang turned around in shock. He was slightly shocked to see that it was Nan Yiyi. \u201cYou went out?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi put down the bream and said, \u201cYes, I thought you wanted to sleep a little longer, so I went out to buy groceries.\u201d\n \u201cI only take an afternoon nap for half an hour.\u201d\n Yan Jiang continued to watch television while Nan Yiyi cooked braised fish in the kitchen.\n Smelling that sweet and sour fragrance, Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t help turning to stare at the kitchen.\n Nan Yiyi was very serious when she cooked. She cut every side dish beautifully and the dishes she made were very delicate and delicious.\n Yan Jiang looked away and popped a grape into his mouth. He thought to himself, Is this how it feels to be taken care of by my mother?\n After dinner, Yan Jiang bid farewell and left.\n Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t bear for him to leave and personally sent him downstairs. She watched as Yan Jiang drove off, before reluctantly entering the building and returning home.\n Yan Jiang was unfamiliar with the roads nearby and was used to using his cell phone to navigate. In the end, he searched his entire body but couldn\u2019t find his cell phone.\n Realizing that his cell phone might have been left in Nan Yiyi\u2019s house, Yan Jiang had no choice but to turn back to her house to get it.\n Yan Jiang pressed the doorbell and waited for Nan Yiyi to open the door.\n A look of surprise surfaced on Nan Yiyi\u2019s face when she saw Yan Jiang returning. \u201cJiang Jiang, why are you back?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI might have left my phone in your house. Let me look for it.\u201d\n \u201cOh, okay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang searched around the sofa but couldn\u2019t find it. After thinking for a moment, he went to the guest room. He remembered that he had placed his cell phone on the bedside table before sleeping.\n Could it have fallen to the ground?\n Yan Jiang knelt on the wooden floor and looked down at the bottom of the bed. He really saw his cell phone. But at the same time, he also saw a pair of male AJ shoes.\n Yan Jiang reached out to pick up his cell phone. He stared at those shoes for a while, before quietly getting up and walking out of the room.\n Leaving the room, Yan Jiang stuffed his cell phone into his pocket.\n Nan Yiyi saw his actions and asked him, \u201cWhere did you drop your cell phone?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI placed it under the pillow.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s good that you found it.\u201d\n It was already 8.30pm at night, so Nan Yiyi invited Yan Jiang to stay over. \u201cJiang Jiang, why don\u2019t you stay over at Mother\u2019s tonight?\u201d\n \u201cNo thanks.\u201d Yan Jiang rejected immediately.\n Nan Yiyi was stunned by Yan Jiang\u2019s merciless rejection. Disappointment gradually filled her eyes.\n She looked down listlessly and acknowledged in defeat.\n Yan Jiang glanced at her before turning to leave.\n Returning to the car, Yan Jiang touched the steering wheel with his fingers. He suddenly sent a message to a colleague in charge of intelligence.\n Yan Jiang: [ Jun, can you help me investigate someone?]\n Brother Jun: [Who?]\n Yan Jiang: [My mother, Nan Yiyi, is currently staying in Feng City. Mainly investigate her love life and family situation.]\n Those AJ male shoes were the favorite shoes of young boys.\n Yan Jiang suspected that Nan Yiyi had lied to him. She didn\u2019t live alone at all. There was someone hiding in her house. Knowing that Yan Jiang was coming, she had specially made preparations in advance to create the illusion of living alone.\n Why did Nan Yiyi do this?\n If he didn\u2019t investigate thoroughly, Yan Jiang wouldn\u2019t be at ease.\n Brother Jun: [Alright, I will give you the results tomorrow.]\n Yan Jiang: Thanks, I will treat you to a meal later.\n Yan Jiang returned to the hotel and sent Song Fei a message. After knowing that she was not busy, he called her.\n u Hanshen\u2019s lover, Shen Zhiyi, had retired some time ago and was planning to switch to a retirement job. She had nothing to do these few days, so she stayed home to research some strange things.\n Song Fei was staying at Fu Hanshen\u2019s house. She was standing in the kitchen of Fu Hanshen\u2019s house, studying steamed cakes with her teacher\u2019s wife, Shen Zhiyi.\n The two kitchen idiots wanted to steam cake, causing Fu Hanshen to watch on in trepidation.\n Song Fei\u2019s cell phone rang, so she washed her hands and answered Yan Jiang\u2019s call.\n She returned to her room with her cell phone and went to bed. She asked Yan Jiang, \u201cAre you in a bad mood?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d\n \u201cGut feeling.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I am in a bad mood.\u201d\n Song Fei sat up and glanced at him seriously before asking worriedly, \u201cWhat happened? Did you and your mother fight?\u201d\n \u201cNo, I suspect she\u2019s hiding something from me.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d Song Fei narrowed her eyes and asked him, \u201cIs the matter big or small?\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d\n \u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind. I can\u2019t read your mind and I don\u2019t like to guess.\u201d\n Yan Jiang remained silent for a moment before telling Song Fei his thoughts.\n \u201cI went to her house today and saw that it was very clean and that there were only women\u2019s items in the house. She told me that she was not married and had been living alone all these years. I naturally didn\u2019t suspect anything.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, and then?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI was sleeping in the guest room in the afternoon. I lost my cell phone and dropped it under the bed. Only when I left her house at night did I realize that I had lost my cell phone. I went back to my room to look for my cell phone but saw a pair of male AJ shoes under the bed.\u201d\n Song Fei narrowed her cold eyes.\n \u201cShe has a man at home, and a young man at that.\u201d Song Fei smiled coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s most likely her son.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s brows twitched. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n \u201cThere are very few middle-aged and elderly boys who like AJ shoes. It\u2019s very likely a young boy. Your mother shouldn\u2019t be keeping a gigolo, so that person is most likely her child.\u201d\n Song Fei couldn\u2019t bear to see Yan Jiang frown and look so upset at being deceived. She added. \u201cWait for me to check.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n It was the Internet era now. A person\u2019s social relationship could be easily investigated through the Internet.\n Song Fei first hacked into Nan Yiyi\u2019s home computer and realized that the contents of her home computer were all things that only boys would be interested in. For example, the internet celebrities, luxury cars, AJ shoes, little Zemaria...\n Song Fei looked at that person\u2019s photo album again and found many photos. Nan Yiyi had also appeared in those photos.\n One of the photos was of the boy\u2019s elementary school graduation photo. Nan Yiyi was dressed beautifully and was hugged by the youth. The two of them looked somewhat similar and it was obvious they were mother and son.\n Nan Yiyi had a son and was not young.\n Realization!\n \u201cGot it,\u201d Song Fei said as she copied those photos and sent them to Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang opened the chat and saw the photo Song Fei sent over.\n Upon seeing that young man, Yan Jiang was certain that he was Nan Yiyi\u2019s child because they looked very much like mother and son.\n Yan Jiang narrowed his eyes.\n Nan Yiyi lied.\n She might not be married, but she had a son.\n Her son was not young and was already in junior high school.\n Why did Nan Yiyi hide the existence of that son from me?\n Was she afraid that I will be jealous and angry if I find out?\n Yan Jiang felt that things weren\u2019t that simple.\n \u201cCan you help me find out that boy\u2019s identity?\u201d\n Song Fei started to make conditions: Yan Jiang was usually very obedient and followed her lead, and he would never dare to defy her.\n But in bed, Yan Jiang was unreasonable.\n Yan Jiang was momentarily stunned before giving in. \u201cJust once.\u201d\n Song Fei snorted. \u201cHmph!\u201d\n Song Fei started to search for information. She seemed to have found something. At first, her brows were still furrowed, but gradually, she frowned with a grave expression.\n In the end...\n \u201cF*ck!\u201d\n Song Fei scolded. \u201cWhat a vicious woman. So disgusting!\u201d\n Yan Jiang raised his brows in surprise.\n Even if the person being scolded was his mother, Yan Jiang wasn\u2019t angry.\n He looked at Song Fei\u2019s enraged expression and felt that she was so adorable, like a little dolphin.\n \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d\n Song Fei took a deep breath and gave Yan Jiang an order. \u201cImmediately set off for Wangdong City. In the future, stay away from that stupid woman, Nan Yiyi. If you dare to be soft-hearted towards her again, I will beat you up.\u201d\n After a pause, Song Fei added. \u201cUsing a belt.\u201d\n Yan Jiang swallowed quietly before asking her, \u201cWhat exactly did you find out?\u201d\n \u201cYour mother is indeed not married,\u201d Song Fei said.\n Yan Jiang raised his brows. He felt that Song Fei\u2019s next sentence would be very shocking.\n Song Fei didn\u2019t disappoint. She said, \u201cBut she is a mistress and secretly gave birth to a son for that man. The shopping mall under your mother\u2019s name is the property that that man compensated them.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n Unexpectedly, Nan Yiyi had climbed up the ladder by sleeping around.\n Yan Jiang felt slightly uncomfortable.\n No child could accept such a woman who had lost her morals.\n Today, Yan Jiang was indeed moved by Nan Yiyi\u2019s sugar-coated strategy.\n However, perhaps because he had already lost all hope for Nan Yiyi and recognized her true, selfish, and cold character, Yan Jiang was only slightly shocked and surprised when he heard Song Fei\u2019s words.\n ]Meanwhile, his heart that had once again burned with hatred for Nan Yiyi also calmed down.\n \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d If it was only this, Song Fei wouldn\u2019t be so angry and would eat the melon curiously.\n Song Fei sneered. \u201cThat son of hers is rather smart. He has good grades and looks, but his intelligence is bound to be affected. Your brother was diagnosed with leukemia last year. As for you...\u201d\n Song Fei\u2019s gaze was especially cold. She said, \u201cI went to check the hospital where your brother is and found all the medical reports your brother has done. I found a bone marrow compatible form...\u201d\n Yan Jiang narrowed his eyes as he vaguely guessed what would happen next.\n As expected, Song Fei said, \u201cYour bone marrow is very compatible with that younger brother of yours. That bastard Nan Yiyi actually wanted to use your bone marrow to save that younger brother of yours!\u201d\n \u201cDamn it!\u201d Song Fei couldn\u2019t take it anymore and scolded. \u201cWhat a jerk. She abandoned you back then and she still has the cheek to aim your bone marrow! How thick-skinned.\u201d\n Song Fei was so angry that she turned off her computer. She glared at Yan Jiang and ordered him. \u201cHurry up and scram back to Wangdong City tonight!\u201d\n After a momentary daze, Yan Jiang was pulled back to reality by Song Fei\u2019s scolding.\n He looked at the indignant Song Fei and suddenly smiled. He said passionately, \u201cOnly you are good to me. You really have no ulterior motives.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cDon\u2019t. My motives aren\u2019t pure either.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned. \u201cWhat are you after?\u201d\n Song Fei stared at Yan Jiang\u2019s face and his sexy collarbone that was faintly discernible under his shirt. She laid on the bed and gazed at the ceiling. She sighed. \u201cI crave your handsome face and charming body.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was momentarily stunned before he smiled.\n After saying that, Song Fei felt very coquettish and didn\u2019t have the face to continue chatting with Yan Jiang. She hung up the video call.\n The smile on Yan Jiang\u2019s face disappeared very quickly.\n Want my bone marrow?\n Yan Jiang sneered.\n Not to mention my bone marrow, I wouldn\u2019t even give Nan Yiyi a single strand of my hair!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "223": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-224\n\n Chapter 223: The Hypocritical Mother, The Son Who Played the Waiting Game  Yan Jiang didn\u2019t listen to Song Fei and leave obediently. Not only did he not leave, he even took a few more days off from his superior.\n The leader threatened him. \u201cIf you continue like this, your job will be ruined.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was willing to be a salted fish. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I have savings that can last me until I am 80 years old.\u201d\n The leader hung up angrily. A moment later, he sent a photo of a leave request.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s way of expressing his gratitude was very simple. He directly sent a red packet. Afraid that others would think it was a bribe, he even wrote a sentence on the red packet:\n Buying candy for Daddy Leader.\n Daddy Leader didn\u2019t accept his red packet.\n \u2013\n At 5.40am in the morning, Nan Yiyi arrived at the market as soon as the sun rose. She bought a medium-sized carp and went home to make soup.\n In the middle of making soup, she put on makeup and changed into clothes.\n ]After putting the soup into a thermos container, Nan Yiyi carried the soup and drove to the First People\u2019s Hospital in Feng City.\n It was not yet time for work, but the hospital was already bustling with activity. In the main hall on the first floor of the hospitalization department, the family members were busy buying breakfast and eating breakfast.\n Holding the food container, Nan Yiyi entered the crowded lift.\n In the lift, both men and women were secretly sizing her up.\n There were many people in the lift and very few people dressed as decently as Nan Yiyi.\n She was wearing a dark purple halter dress with a thin windbreaker wrapped around it. Feng City\u2019s mornings were rather cold, so wearing like this would keep her warm and beautiful.\n She had taken good care of herself and dressed up meticulously. She didn\u2019t look like someone in her fifties at all. Instead, she looked like a beautiful woman in her early forties.\n The lift reached the floor of the Hematology Department. Nan Yiyi opened the door and sashayed out flirtatiously.\n All the hospital staff recognized her because she was beautiful, charming, and rich.\n The head nurse brought a group of nurses to each ward to inquire about the condition of each patient, preparing to hand over their work after work.\n Seeing Nan Yiyi, the head nurse stopped and asked her with a smile, \u201cMs. Nan, you\u2019re here so early today?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi also stopped in her tracks and asked the head nurse with a smile, \u201cDid my son sleep well last night?\u201d\n \u201cIt was alright last night. He didn\u2019t see you yesterday and was slightly angry.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good. Thank you for your hard work.\u201d Nan Yiyi bid farewell to the head nurse before walking towards an independent VIP ward.\n She pushed open the door and entered. She heard her son say, \u201cDidn\u2019t I take my temperature already?\u201d\n Nan Ketong thought it was a nurse.\n ]Hearing the sound of high heels clicking on the ground, Nan Ke Tong turned to look.\n A mocking smile appeared on Nan Ketong\u2019s youthful face when he saw that it was Nan Yiyi. He said, \u201cMother, aren\u2019t you very busy? Why are you free to visit me today?\u201d\n Yesterday, Nan Yiyi was busy entertaining Yan Jiang and didn\u2019t even visit Nan Ketong.\n Nan Yiyi placed the food container on the cupboard by the bed. She placed the bowl on the table and opened the lid. As she poured the soup, she said, \u201cA guest came to our house yesterday.\u201d\n \u201cYour business partner again?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Nan Yiyi tilted Nan Ketong\u2019s head higher so that he could sit and drink the soup. Nan Yiyi\u2019s culinary skills were very good and the fish soup was delicious.\n Nan Yiyi picked up the soup and brought it to Nan Ketong\u2019s lips.\n Nan Ketong remained silent as she engaged in a quiet battle with Nan Yiyi.\n Although Nan Yiyi was angry, she couldn\u2019t flare up.\n Nan Ketong was usually a very filial child. It was just that he was sick and the pain of his illness made his heart break. He had nowhere to vent his emotions and could only vent his anger on his only family.\n Nan Yiyi controlled her temper and coaxed Nan Ketong. \u201cThis is the fish that I woke up to buy at the market before dawn. It\u2019s also very tough on me. Tong Tong, don\u2019t be angry with me, alright?\u201d\n Nan Ketong glanced at Nan Yiyi.\n Nan Ketong didn\u2019t feel good seeing the fatigue in Nan Yiyi\u2019s eyes.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I threw a tantrum.\u201d\n Nan Ketong held his own bowl and took small sips.\n Only when she saw that Nan Ke Tong was willing to drink something did Nan Yiyi relax.\n ]After Nan Ketong finished his soup, Nan Yiyi took a piece of tissue and handed it to him.\n Nan Ketong was wiping his mouth when she heard Nan Yiyi say, \u201cYour brother is here for me.\u201d\n Nan Ke Tong\u2019s hand trembled.\n He looked up in shock and asked in disbelief, \u201cMy brother?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s the elder brother you and your ex-husband gave birth to?\u201d Nan Ketong knew that his mother had another child. He was 12 years older than him and lived in Wangdong City.\n But all these years, that elder brother had never contacted Nan Yiyi. Hearing that elder brother suddenly came, Nan Ketong couldn\u2019t help feeling shocked.\n ]Nan Yiyi acknowledged again.\n \u201cWhy is he looking for you at this time?\u201d Nan Ketong couldn\u2019t help speculating maliciously. \u201cHe wants to get married and buy a house, so he came to look for you to ask for money?\u201d\n There was a reason why Nan Ketong thought so.\n Nan Ketong knew that that elder brother had been living with his grandmother since he was young. After his grandmother died, he lived alone.\n Thinking about it, his elder brother was almost 27 years old. At this age, he should be talking about marriage.\n Shouldn\u2019t he buy cars and houses now that he were getting married? Every inch of land in Wangdong City was expensive and the houses there were not affordable for ordinary people.\n \u201cNo, your brother is very rich. Even if I want to buy him a house, he won\u2019t accept it.\u201d Yan Jiang was too hostile towards her. Yesterday, Yan Jiang was already magnanimous to agree to have a meal with her.\n \u201cThen why is he here?\u201d Nan Ke Tong was puzzled.\n \u201cHe just came to visit me.\u201d Nan Yiyi\u2019s eyes were slightly red. She said, \u201cI am already very happy that your brother is willing to come and meet me and not fuss over what I did to him.\u201d\n Nan Ketong looked at Nan Yiyi\u2019s reddened eyes and remained silent.\n Thinking of his illness, Nan Ke Tong smiled mockingly. \u201cThat\u2019s good too. If I die, you will have another son to accompany you. Mother, you won\u2019t have to worry about not having anyone to support you when you\u2019re old...\u201d\n Pa!\n Before Nan Ketong could speak, Nan Yiyi gave him a tight slap across the face.\n Nan Yiyi immediately regretted the slap.\n She anxiously sized up Nan Ketong\u2019s face, and was relieved to see that he didn\u2019t bleed.\n Nan Ketong was stunned. He covered his face and realized that his words doubted Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart.\n He looked down at his own hands and apologized in a muffled voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mother.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been running around between the hospital and the office for me, but I still maliciously speculated on you. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d Nan Ketong wanted to take back his words, but his words were like water that couldn\u2019t be taken back.\n Nan Yiyi saw that Nan Ketong\u2019s teeth were bleeding and hurriedly called for a nurse.\n The head nurse ran over and saw that Nan Ke Tong\u2019s teeth were bleeding profusely. She hurriedly called the doctor over to treat him.\n After some work, the bleeding finally stopped.\n Nan Yiyi sat on a stool and covered her face as she cried. I shouldn\u2019t have hit the child!\n Nan Ketong laid weakly on the bed. He reached out to hold Nan Yiyi\u2019s hand and said weakly, \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself, Mother. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi cried even louder.\n As she was crying, she suddenly heard a strange female voice coming from outside the ward. \u201cHey, what\u2019s the matter? Nan Yiyi, why are you crying? Isn\u2019t your son still alive?\u201d\n an Yiyi stopped crying and looked up angrily at the uninvited woman.\n That woman was wearing a red cheongsam with her hair in a bun. She was wearing a pair of ruby earrings and looked very elegant.\n The woman had a slender waist and a classy face. Even if she was smiling mockingly, it was not detestable.\n Nan Yiyi stared at that woman and gritted her teeth. \u201cXu Fangyuan, must you stab me now?\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan sneered. She said, \u201cIf you can come to my house to make a scene during my confinement period after my miscarriage, while you yourself were pregnant, why can\u2019t I stab you in the back?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi glared at Xu Fangyuan, so angry that she couldn\u2019t speak.\n This Xu Fangyuan was the daughter of the Xu Family, a scholarly family in Feng City. 16 years ago, she had married the eldest young master of the Yan Family, a business family.\n The two of them had always been very close after their marriage. In the third year after their marriage, Xu Fangyuan was pregnant but lost the child due to an accident.\n After Xu Fangyuan had a miscarriage, she had a confinement period of one month. At this moment, Nan Yiyi actually came to the Yan Family with a seven-month-old belly and openly provoked Xu Fangyuan.\n Xu Fangyuan fainted from anger. As vengeance hurt her health, she didn\u2019t have a child for five years. Only five years later did Xu Fangyuan get pregnant again and have a daughter.\n However, the bigger the family, the more they valued bloodlines. The boy that Nan Yiyi secretly gave birth to was the only male child under the Yan family name.\n Although Yan Yu had never acknowledged Nan Ketong\u2019s status in consideration of Xu Fangyuan, he was still Yan Yu\u2019s son and would eventually acknowledge his roots and ancestors.\n Nan Ketong was only 13 years old and had already shown extraordinary intelligence. What would happen when he was a few years older?\n That was something that Xu Fangyuan would never allow to happen!\n But the heavens had eyes and the bitch would be punished by the heavens. Before Xu Fangyuan could lay his hands on Nan Ke Tong and her son, the heavens had already laid their hands on them.\n [fuzzy]Half a year ago, Nan Ketong suddenly bled profusely during class and was sent to the hospital for a check-up. Only then did they know that he had acute leukemia.\n In half a year, Nan Ketong\u2019s health was deteriorating rapidly. He didn\u2019t have much time left and Xu Fangyuan would definitely come to take a look.\n As a result, she specially wore a festive red qipao today.\n It was very appropriate!\n Xu Fangyuan sat down at the furthest corner from the bed. Her expression was filled with disdain, as if Nan Ketong was suffering from some kind of infectious disease.\n Staring at Nan Ke Tong, who became as skinny as skeleton, in just half a year, Xu Fangyuan\u2019s lips curled into a fake smile. She said, \u201cTong Tong, you look so pitiful now. Auntie\u2019s heart hurts seeing you like this.\u201d\n Nan Ketong seemed to have heard something that shocked him. He looked slightly dazed and pretended not to hear Xu Fangyuan\u2019s words.\n A moment later, Nan Ketong snapped out of his trance. He smiled at Xu Fangyuan. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be merciful.\u201d\n \u201cOh, you saw through me.\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan chuckled. \u201cYou have good eyesight despite your poor health.\u201d\n \u201cXu Fangyuan, shut up!\u201d Nan Yiyi saw that Xu Fangyuan was still not giving up and was instantly enraged. She stood up and was about to fight with Xu Fangyuan.\n Xu Fangyuan suddenly ordered. \u201cCome in!\u201d\n Two burly men entered.\n Xu Fangyuan smiled provocatively at Nan Yiyi, looking both despicable and adorable. \u201cHit me, hit me in the face! You must think carefully. You\u2019re not going to hit my face, but the Yan Family\u2019s face!\u201d\n \u201cLook, you already gave birth to a son for Yan Yu, but he didn\u2019t divorce me to marry you. What kind of position do you have in his heart? You don\u2019t have any...\u201d Thinking that such forceful words didn\u2019t match her elegant and dignified image, Xu Fangyuan changed her words.\u201d Don\u2019t you know? \u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s face was red and pale from embarrassment, but she couldn\u2019t refute Xu Fangyuan\u2019s words.\n Xu Fangyuan and Yan Yu were truly in love. Even with Nan Ke Tong between the two of them, he didn\u2019t tear them apart.\n Nan Yiyi knew all too well how important Xu Fangyuan was to Yan Yu, and how much she and her son meant to him.\n \u201cI am indeed not as important as you in his heart.\u201d Nan Yiyi gave a strange smile and said, \u201cBut in his heart, you are also not a darling child of a fairy. If he really loved you, he wouldn\u2019t have been mesmerized by me back then and spent a blissful time with me.\u201d\n Hearing this, Xu Fangyuan gritted her teeth in anger. She instinctively retorted. \u201cHe was drunk! You took the opportunity to sneak into his room! You know very well how you climbed into his bed!\u201d\n \u201cHa, drunk. What a good excuse. Every man who has an affair uses an excuse of being drunk. Alcohol itself is also very innocent!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi asked Xu Fangyuan in amusement, \u201cYou are a woman and you know better than me how Yan Yu is like when he\u2019s drunk. You should also know whether he was drunk or not.\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan was speechless.\n Of course she knew how he looked like when he was drunk. He was like a loach after he was drunk and couldn\u2019t even stand steadily, let alone having sex with a strange woman!\n At the end of the day, he was obsessed with beauty!\n Although he had regained his senses after the incident with Nan Yiyi and loved her wholeheartedly, the incident with Nan Yiyi was still a thorn in Xu Fangyuan\u2019s heart.\n Xu Fangyuan took a deep breath and muttered softly, \u201cNo, no, no. Her son is dying and she is in a pitiful state. I won\u2019t get angry at that poor woman.\u201d After repeating the incantation a few times, Xu Fangyuan really calmed down.\n Hearing Xu Fangyuan\u2019s muttering, Nan Yiyi\u2019s blood rushed to her head and she nearly fainted!\n \u201cGo!\u201d Nan Yiyi pointed at the door and ordered Xu Fangyuan to leave.\n Xu Fangyuan stood up and leaned close to Nan Yiyi. She whispered in her ear, \u201cYiyi, don\u2019t be afraid. After Tong Tong leaves, I will come to offer incense and burn some paper money.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She raised her hand and was about to slap Xu Fangyuan.\n Xu Fangyuan grabbed Nan Yiyi\u2019s wrist and flung her hand away. She scolded. \u201cYou\u2019re just a mistress. Don\u2019t be too arrogant!\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan turned and walked away arrogantly, but somehow couldn\u2019t bring herself to hate her.\n Nan Yiyi closed the door and turned to see Nan Ketong\u2019s disgusted and cold eyes. Her heart ached. \u201cTong Tong, don\u2019t take her words to heart. Tong Tong, she won\u2019t come in again.\u201d\n Nan Ketong stared at Nan Yiyi indifferently. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that you were deceived by Yan Yu back then?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s expression froze.\n Nan Ketong sneered and said disappointedly, \u201cI always thought you were a pitiful woman who was deceived. I really didn\u2019t expect you to be a mistress. And I...\u201d\n Nan Kotong pointed at himself and said tearfully, \u201cSo I am an illegitimate child...\u201d\n No wonder Yan Yu never came to visit me. Even when I graduated from primary school with full marks, Yan Yu never even called me.\n So I am an illegitimate child.\n No wonder.\n Nan Yiyi shook her head in tears. \u201cTong Tong, it\u2019s not what that woman Xu Fangyuan said. Xu Fangyuan is trying to sow discord! Believe me!\u201d\n Nan Ketong pulled the blanket up to cover his face. \u201cDon\u2019t speak. Leave.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi saw that her son was avoiding her and could only leave first.\n She had just reached the entrance of the hospital when her cell phone rang.\n Nan Yiyi picked up the phone and heard Yan Jiang\u2019s voice.\n \u201cI still have to stay in Feng City for a few more days. Can you introduce me to a few fun places?\u201d Yan Jiang was trying to be friendly.\n Nan Yiyi wiped her tears and pulled herself together. \u201cI don\u2019t have much to do these few days. Jiang Jiang, let me walk around with you.\u201d\n Yan Jiang hesitated as if he wanted to refuse.\n Afraid that he would reject her outright, Nan Yiyi hurriedly added. \u201cJiang Jiang, don\u2019t reject me. It\u2019s not easy for Mother to meet you. I can\u2019t bear for you to go back like this. Just give Mother a chance and let me accompany you for a few days, alright?\u201d\n Yan Jiang acknowledged awkwardly. \u201cAlright then...\u201d\n After hanging up, Nan Yiyi glanced back at the hospital building before turning to leave.\n \u2013\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s car was parked at the entrance of the hotel. After a while, she saw Yan Jiang.\n He was wearing black pants, a light pink suit jacket, and a black, narrow, fashionable tie. His brown hair was scattered casually, making him look lazy and devilish.\n He was biting on the leg of his chain glasses and typing a message on his cell phone. His fingers were tapping away rapidly, but she didn\u2019t know who he was talking to.\n Nan Yiyi hurriedly put down the car window, reached out her left hand, and shook it at Yan Jiang. \u201cJiang Jiang, Mother is here!\u201d\n Yan Jiang stopped and stared at Nan Yiyi from a distance. He then looked down, took off his glasses, and placed them on his face.\n He got into the car gracefully.\n Sitting in the passenger seat, Yan Jiang fastened his seatbelt and replied: [The shark is here. Let\u2019s not chat for now.]\n Song Ci: [Go fishing then.]\n Yan Jiang turned off his cell phone and turned to look at Nan Yiyi\u2019s slightly red eyes under her sunhat. \u201cYou cried?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi laughed awkwardly. Her voice was slightly hoarse as she said, \u201cYou can tell?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Yan Jiang asked again, \u201cWhy are you unhappy?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi said, \u201cLast night, I thought of you and was about to go back. I couldn\u2019t bear it. Thinking of how adorable you were when you were young and those memories of us living together, I really couldn\u2019t hold it in.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s expression was sincere, as if she was speaking the truth.\n Yan Jiang smiled and said in a profound tone, \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I will accompany you for a few more days.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Nan Yiyi smiled again.\n \u201cWhere are we going to play?\u201d Yan Jiang crossed his arms and looked straight ahead of the car. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about Feng City. In the past, I came because of work.\u201d\n Hearing this, Nan Yiyi sank into her memories.\n She vaguely remembered that when Yan Jiang was 12 years old, she had promised him that she would bring him to Hong Kong Disneyland when the summer vacation arrived.\n In the end, before the summer vacation arrived, Yan Rufeng abandoned them and ran away.\n During the summer vacation, she also abandoned Yan Jiang and left home.\n She still owed Yan Jiang a trip to Disneyland.\n Nan Yiyi suddenly asked Yan Jiang, \u201cHow many more days do you have?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cFive days.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Disneyland, alright?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was slightly stunned.\n Yan Jiang had a very deep memory of that year when he was 12 years old. Too many things happened that year and changed his life.\n The moment Nan Yiyi mentioned Disneyland, Yan Jiang naturally recalled that Nan Yiyi had promised to bring him on a trip to Disneyland.\n Yan Jiang narrowed his eyes and smiled ambiguously. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was driving and didn\u2019t notice the coldness in Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes.\n Hearing Yan Jiang\u2019s agreement, Nan Yiyi heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cAlright, I will book a flight now.\u201d\n At noon, they arrived in Shanghai.\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s assistant had already bought tickets for them in advance. They would be spending three days and two nights at Disneyland. As a result, once they arrived in Shanghai, they boarded a car to Disneyland and checked into the hotel.\n It was a weekend and there were many people at the theme park. Yan Jiang and Nan Yiyi had been queuing for two hours and only managed to ride on one of the rides, before it was late.\n They went to the restaurant for an expensive and unpalatable dinner and watched the fireworks show at night. Yan Jiang recorded the fireworks show as a video and posted it in his WeChat group with Song Ci, Song Fei, and Han Zhan.\n After Song Fei was done, she saw that video and posted: [Looking for flowers and asking about the willow, so happy.]\n Song Ci didn\u2019t mind the trouble and even asked Yan Jiang: [Is the sleeping beauty beautiful? Have you kissed her?]\n After taking a shower, Yan Jiang saw the Song sisters\u2019 comments. He first tagged Song Ci and threw a big, bleeding knife at her.\n The moment the knife was thrown out, Han Zhan popped his head out.\n Han Zhan: [@ Yan Jiang.]\n Han Zhan: [Explosive emoticon.]\n Song Ci: [Brother Han is awesome. I love you.]\n Yan Jiang raised his brows and asked them: [Can we still have a good chat? If you want to show off your love, can\u2019t you just close the door and hide in your room? Please return my WeChat to a pure land.]\n Song Fei: [This is for you. Picture.jpg @ Han Zhan.]\n Han Zhan opened the photo and saw that it was a cell image magnified by a microscope.\n Han Zhan: [Sister Fei, what is this?]\n Song Fei: [The predecessor of the Ebola virus is for you.]\n Song Fei: [Don\u2019t bully Yan Jiang. Do you think I am dead?]\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Song Ci giggled beside him. \u201cSong Fei is very protective of her loved ones. Brother Han, don\u2019t provoke her.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly innocent. \u201cYan Jiang handed you a knife first.\u201d\n This was logical, but after Song Fei appeared, Han Zhan didn\u2019t appear in the group anymore.\n Song Fei asked Yan Jiang privately: [Did you go to Disneyland?]\n Yan Jiang: [Mmm.]\n Song Fei: [Why did you go there?]\n Yan Jiang: [To play the long game.]\n Song Fei: [What can I do for you?] If Song Fei didn\u2019t do anything for Yan Jiang, she would feel uneasy.\n After thinking for a moment, Yan Jiang said, [I do need your help with something, but not now. I have to wait a few more days.]\n Song Fei: [Let me know when the time comes.]\n [Okay.]\n The next morning, Nan Yiyi and Yan Jiang were dressed very casually. They put on sneakers and sunhat.\n Although it was Monday, there were still many tourists in the scenic area. Every ride had lines for more than an hour and the ride itself would only last a few minutes.\n Only when he was in the amusement park did Yan Jiang realize that Disneyland was not as exciting as he had imagined.\n Arriving at Mickey Street, Yan Jiang bought an ice cream. Thinking that Song Fei liked to eat sugar, he ate the ice cream and entered a shop called the Chichi Diti Fruit Shop.\n The shelves of the shop were filled with a dazzling array of snacks.\n Yan Jiang chose a few types of snacks. As he queued up to cash in, the few young girls behind him were all slightly excited.\n Yan Jiang looked down and sent a voice message to Song Fei. [I bought you candy. Should I send it to you or bring it home to wait for you to come back to eat?]\n Knowing that Song Fei must be busy, Yan Jiang put his cell phone back into his pocket. He looked up and saw that everyone was holding their cell phones up to take photos of him.\n Seeing that he looked up and revealed a handsome face that was no different from the exquisite poster, the young ladies immediately covered their mouths and exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s really Yan Jiang!\u201d\n Yan Jiang was slightly distressed to be recognized.\n This was Disneyland. If people came to surround me...\n Yan Jiang put his hand to his mouth and shushed them.\n The fans understood and said excitedly, \u201cYan Jiang, don\u2019t worry. We will never tell anyone that you are at Disneyland!\u201d\n The fans took photos with Yan Jiang, asked for his autograph, and chatted with him for a while before reluctantly bidding farewell.\n Yan Jiang walked out and found Nan Yiyi.\n Nan Yiyi saw that he looked slightly frustrated and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \u201cI was recognized by my fans.\u201d\n \u201cWill it be very troublesome then?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cProbably...\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Caribbean to play.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t know that his fans, who had promised not to divulge any information about him, immediately uploaded the photo to Weibo.\n As a result, after just 10 minutes, # Yan Jiang, Disney # became the hottest topic!\n Yan Jiang and Nan Yiyi arrived at the Caribbean Sea and stood at the back of the queue. After queuing for a few minutes, the tourist beside Yan Jiang noticed him.\n Yan Jiang was surrounded by his fans.\n His allure seemed to be even greater than that of the Disney tour program, as everyone surrounded him thoroughly.\n In the end, the commotion here alerted the security guards at the scenic area.\n By the time Yan Jiang escaped, it was already two hours later.\n Returning to the hotel, Yan Jiang laid weakly in bed. He couldn\u2019t help complaining on Weibo.\n Yan Jiang: I didn\u2019t expect everyone to still be so passionate even after a year.\n Knowing that Yan Jiang was lamenting about the commotion at Disneyland today, his fans teased him and said that he could only wear a mask to play.\n Yan Jiang ignored his fans\u2019 comments and quickly fell asleep.\n Only when he woke up did Yan Jiang realize that there was another trending topic related to him on the trending topic list. However, the main character this time was not him but the mysterious beautiful woman who had appeared in the video with him!\n As Nan Yiyi had maintained herself well and looked young and beautiful, some citizens of Feng City recognized her.\n After knowing that Nan Yiyi was the boss of several major shopping malls in Feng City, some people started to speculate maliciously that Yan Jiang had found a wealthy lady.\n Yan Jiang had over 40 million fans, 30 million of whom were fans and the other 10 million haters.\n Faced with his anti-fans, Yan Jiang had always been one to fight back and never compromise.\n He chose a malicious comment and replied:\n Yan Jiang: If your mother knew that you have such a vicious tongue, she might want to stuff you back in for a rebirth. I never knew that son and mother hanging out would be misunderstood as gigolos and sugar daddies. I am sad that such trashy things like you exist in this world / @ Yan Jiang is an orphan. This woman is definitely not his mother, he\u2019s an oprhan. She might be his godmother, the kind who gives money to warm his bed.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s words were undoubtedly a formal response to his relationship with Nan Yiyi.\n Then someone was unconvinced.\n The anti-fans found another black spot and started attacking Yan Jiang crazily.\n Big Yellow Dog: [Hehe, what happened to being an orphan? His mother is so rich, what kind of orphan is he? His image is ruined!]\n The Godly Monarch of Destruction: Yan Jiang is a fool. He created an orphan image to gain the sympathy of his female fans. Disgusting!\n Glutton\u2019s Hand: [So shameless. Can you be any more fake?]\n The masses were spreading rumors and damaging his image. Yan Jiang quickly became the target of public criticism and was slandered in all sorts of ways.\n There was no way to play in Disney anymore. Yan Jiang packed his things and was about to leave. He was busy packing his things and didn\u2019t have the time to deal with these lazy and useless haters.\n He and Nan Yiyi left Disneyland discreetly and boarded a car to the airport.\n Along the way, Nan Yiyi felt very apologetic. She apologized to Yan Jiang and said, \u201cJiang Jiang, I am very sorry that I didn\u2019t let you have fun to your heart\u2019s content this time.\u201d\n \u201cWhen there\u2019s a chance in the future, let\u2019s go overseas to play together, alright?\u201d\n Yan Jiang leaned back in his chair and pretended to be asleep. He shook his head. \u201cI am very happy.\u201d\n Opening his eyes, Yan Jiang comforted Nan Yiyi when he saw her frustrated expression. \u201cI am serious. I am already very happy that you still remember the promise from back then.\u201d\n Hearing this, Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart ached slightly and she nearly cried on the spot.\n \u2013\n Arriving on the plane, Yan Jiang turned off his cell phone according to the rules. After alighting, he sent Nan Yiyi home before returning to his hotel.\n After calling for a hotel delivery service, Yan Jiang ate, took a shower, wrapped himself in a bathrobe, and sat on the balcony to check on the progress on Weibo.\n Seeing that the topic of \u201cYan Jiang\u2019s broken character profile\u201d had already become the top trending topic on Weibo, Yan Jiang clicked on the topic and saw dozens of comments from the haters and netizens. He was very satisfied.\n After logging out of Weibo, Yan Jiang called his ex-manager, Lan Ling. \u201cBrother Lan, you can send out the things I asked you to prepare previously.\u201d\n Lan Ling was puzzled. He said, \u201cWhy did you have to put on such a show?\u201d No one knew that the development on Weibo was under Yan Jiang\u2019s control.\n Even Yan Jiang and the female sugar daddy started trending because of Yan Jiang.\n Lan Ling didn\u2019t understand why Yan Jiang would do this.\n First, he purposely lured the haters to dig out the fact that he was an orphan and then released his tragic background. Was this Weibo\u2019s sympathy?\n But the Yan Jiang he knew was not someone who liked to use his private life to hype things up.\n Moreover, Yan Jiang had always acted according to his own wishes in the past. After he left the industry, he became even more unruly.\n There was really no need.\n Yan Jiang sneered. \u201cThere will be an even better show in a few days. Just you wait and see.\u201d\n Lan Ling was silent for a moment before suddenly sighing. \u201cAh Jiang, stop being a forensic doctor. Come back to my company\u2019s public relations department and I will let you be the minister. What do you think?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cDon\u2019t. It\u2019s fun being a forensic doctor.\u201d\n He could face different problems every day. Every time he solved a mystery, that sense of accomplishment was something Lan Ling couldn\u2019t understand.\n Lan Ling felt pity.\n \u201cYou are a talent.\u201d He smoked and said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t be a forensic doctor anymore, welcome back to my side.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang hung up and started watching the movie.\n At 3pm in the afternoon, different comments started appearing online.\n The big rooster woke up early: [To put it bluntly, Yan Jiang is indeed an orphan. I was his dormitory mate in university. He had a very tough time then and went to work every day when he was free. We stayed in the same room for four years and I didn\u2019t see his family call him. The information on his enrollment form is that he is an orphan. It is absolutely true. What happened today might have its own secret.]\n July Rain: [Actually, Yan Jiang\u2019s family\u2019s situation is rather complicated. If not for today\u2019s incident, I wouldn\u2019t have said such things.]\n Yan Jiang and I lived in the same neighborhood when we were young. Our neighborhood was called the Garden of the Rich. It was demolished seven years ago and became the current famous mall.\n It must have been many years ago, more than 10 years ago. At that time, Yan Jiang\u2019s father suddenly ran off with a pervert. This incident spread like wildfire. The owners of our community and several other neighborhoods nearby all knew about it.\n Not long after his father eloped with a pervert, his mother abandoned him and left home one night. Yan Jiang lived with his grandmother after he was 12 years old. Due to his father, Yan Jiang had been bullied since he was young.\n Yan Jiang was already very good-looking when he was young. On the way home from school, I saw him getting beaten up by the senior students several times.\n But at that time, I was rather small-minded and timid. Moreover, I was a girl and didn\u2019t dare to help when I saw him getting beaten up.\n A few years later, his grandmother died. I think she hung herself. I was not very old then. I heard from my parents that Old Madam Yan hung herself and passed away. I heard that her grandson went to the toilet at night and saw his grandmother hanging by the door. He was so scared that he screamed and shouted. He didn\u2019t dare to sleep for a long time after that.\n It\u2019s all true. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask your relatives who stayed in the area.]\n This Weibo user called \u201cJuly Rain\u201d spoke very convincingly and vividly. Gradually, the comments under her Weibo account increased.\n Many of Yan Jiang\u2019s fans were saying that if this news was true, Yan Jiang would be too pitiful.\n But there were also people who questioned the authenticity of July Rain.\n It was only when Song Ci posted on Weibo that everyone stopped talking.\n Song Song, Song Ci: [July Rain\u2019s news is true. Everyone knows that I am very close to Ah Jiang. Actually, we were childhood sweethearts and lived in the same building from a young age.]\n On the night of Ah Jiang\u2019s grandmother\u2019s death, my father helped him carry Grandma Yan off the rope. Although Ah Jiang\u2019s background was very tragic, he was very strong and lived very well alone.\n I know that everyone has the right to speak freely.\n However, the reason why the mouth and heart are red is because the Creator believes that humans are kind and not dark. Please be merciful with your words and don\u2019t maliciously guess other people\u2019s lives.]\n Song Ci\u2019s words confirmed the authenticity of July Rain.\n As a result, a large number of people online were feeling sorry for Yan Jiang. They wanted to stroke his head, give him a hug, and lift him up high.\n Lan Ling sat in her office and watched as her fans\u2019 attitude towards Yan Jiang changed. He couldn\u2019t help sighing. It\u2019s such a big loss to lose you in the entertainment circles!\n However, even Lan Ling only knew today that Yan Jiang actually had such a tragic background.\n His father had abandoned him and fled with the pervert. His mother had abandoned him to seek a second romance, while his grandmother had abandoned him to go to the netherworld alone. This series of events was enough to put on a bitter show.\n Lan Ling sent Yan Jiang a message: [I have a screenwriter who is especially good at writing bitter dramas. Do you want to give her the authorization?]\n Yan Jiang\u2019s reply was very unique.\n [Get lost!]\n Lan Ling laughed out loud.\n Lan Ling asked him again: [Is your grandma the reason why you don\u2019t dare to sleep?]\n Yan Jiang:[... I am not afraid to sleep.]\n Lan Ling saw that Yan Jiang was unwilling to admit this and knew that he also cared about his face, so he didn\u2019t ask him again.\n Lan Ling: [It\u2019s all in the past.]\n Yan Jiang: [Mmm.]\n At 6pm in the evening, Yan Jiang, the person involved in the incident, spoke again after a day.\n Yan Jiang: [I will always be abandoned, but never by myself.]\n With Yan Jiang\u2019s announcement, he was once again trending!\n \u2013\n In the hospital, Nan Ke Tong spent some time to sort out the commotion on Weibo over the past two days.\n Nan Ke Tong\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw Yan Jiang\u2019s speech half an hour ago.\n It turned out that the elder brother her mother was talking about was Yan Jiang!\n Nan Ketong used to admire Yan Jiang very much. He felt that Yan Jiang was just like a clear stream in the entertainment circles. He didn\u2019t care about his image, didn\u2019t put on airs, and dissed anyone he didn\u2019t like. He was just like a wolf cub.\n From a young age, Nan Ketong had been taught by Nan Yiyi to be a well-educated and cultured person. But deep down, he especially yearned to become a man like Yan Jiang who did whatever he wanted.\n Nan Yiyi pushed open the door and entered. Before Nan Ketong could turn off her cell phone, she heard the female host explain. \u201cSo, yesterday, Ms. Nan who appeared at Disneyland with Yan Jiang was his biological mother who abandoned him. But from the way they interacted, it seems like Yan Jiang has already forgiven his biological mother.\u201d\n \u201cI have to admit that Yan Jiang is still soft-hearted towards his mother.\u201d\n ...\n Nan Ketong hurriedly turned off her cell phone. She looked up and saw Nan Yiyi standing at the door with a pale face.\n \u201cYou heard everything.\u201d Having been discovered, Nan Ke Tong decided not to hide anything.\n He raised his cell phone and smiled mockingly at Nan Yiyi. \u201cThe night before yesterday, you said you were busy with work, so you were going to Disneyland with your eldest son?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi looked at her youngest son guiltily and remained silent.\n Nan Ketong pulled out the IV tube on impulse. Seeing this, Nan Yiyi\u2019s expression changed and she hurriedly shouted at him, \u201cTong Tong! Don\u2019t be like this! Don\u2019t be agitated!\u201d Nan Yiyi hurriedly pressed the button.\n Nan Ketong struggled and roared angrily. \u201cI am going to die lying in bed! Do you see? I am going to die! How heartless must you be to abandon your dying child and go Disneyland with your other son!\u201d\n Nan Ketong\u2019s rebuke made Nan Yiyi want to cry.\n Nan Yiyi hugged Nan Ketong and said in a sobbing voice, \u201cTongtong, how can I not care about you! You are the child I raise by my side everyday. My relationship with you is definitely deeper than your brother\u2019s!\u201d\n \u201cI want to build a good relationship with your brother and want his...\u201d Nan Yiyi suddenly shut up and stopped.\n Nan Ketong calmed down slightly. He grabbed Nan Yiyi\u2019s arm and looked at her with reddened eyes. \u201cWhat do you want? Tell me what do you want to do!\u201d\n Nan Ketong didn\u2019t believe Nan Yiyi at all.\n He felt that Nan Yiyi\u2019s lies were not trustworthy at all.\n Nan Yiyi released Nan Ketong and took out a medical report from her bag. She opened it and handed it to Nan Ketong.\n Nan Ke Tong took the report and saw that it read:\n The HLA test at Feng City\u2019s First People\u2019s Hospital.\n Nan Ketong continued reading and was surprised to find that he was compatible with the tested HLA!\n Nan Ketong was overjoyed. He hurriedly looked up and asked Nan Yiyi, \u201cMother, who is this from my HLA test?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi looked at him with teary eyes. \u201cWho do you think it is?\u201d\n Nan Ketong guessed a possibility and was stunned.\n Nan Yiyi told him, \u201cMother has been coaxing that child these few days, hoping that he will forgive me. I will tell him of your existence and strive to make him voluntarily donate his bone marrow to you.\u201d Nan Yiyi also felt ashamed at the mention of her real motive.\n To do this to her own child, the mother was truly ruthless.\n Nan Yiyi also knew that she deserved to die, but she had no choice. She wanted Nan Ketong to live!\n Nan Ketong was her hope!\n With that stumbling block Xu Fangyuan around, Nan Ketong would never be able to get a suitable bone marrow!\n Nan Yiyi could only curry favor with Yan Jiang!\n Even if Yan Jiang didn\u2019t come to Feng City this time, Nan Yiyi would still go to Wangdong City to meet him.\n With the test report in front of him, Nan Ketong had no reason to doubt Nan Yiyi anymore. Nan Ketong\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he said hoarsely, \u201cWill he agree?\u201d Medical records said that donating bone marrow was not a big problem for donors, but how many people were willing to donate bone marrow?\n \u201cHe will.\u201d Nan Yiyi\u2019s tone was very confident. \u201cHe can even forgive me for abandoning him back then. This means that he loves me.\u201d\n \u201cHe will agree.\u201d\n Family tie was a knife. It was always on your neck, forcing you to do things against your will.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "224": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-225\n\n Chapter 224: I Wasted Her Efforts  Nan Ketong still felt it was inappropriate to hear such certainty in Nan Yiyi\u2019s voice.\n He said, \u201cI knew Yan Jiang before. He is a celebrity and very popular. He is also very hot-tempered and is famous for being difficult to deal with.\u201d\n \u201cMother, I feel that if he discovers your true motive, he might not agree to it.\u201d\n Nan Ketong felt that Nan Yiyi was being overly confident.\n Think about it. It was already not easy for a child who had been abandoned by his mother since young to be able to let bygones be bygones.\n After knowing that his biological mother had ulterior motives for treating him well, given Yan Jiang\u2019s unyielding character, he might do something crazy.\n When she heard Nan Ke Tong\u2019s analysis, Nan Yiyi said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand him. I single-handedly brought him to the age of 12. I know better than anyone how soft-hearted and kind that child is.\u201d\n When Yan Jiang was very young, Nan Yiyi and Yan Rufeng quarreled once and she ran away from home in the middle of the night.\n After she walked out of the district, she heard footsteps behind her. Nan Yiyi turned and saw Yan Jiang holding his little school bag and following behind her quietly.\n It was so cold that Yan Jiang\u2019s nose turned red.\n Seeing that his mother had discovered him, Yan Jiang felt very uneasy. He ran up to Nan Yiyi in small steps, opened his little school bag, and brought the piggy bank that he had saved for two years to her.\n At that time, the small savings was Yan Jiang\u2019s everything.\n Yan Jiang looked up at Nan Yiyi. \u201cMother, I have money. Let\u2019s go to a hotel. It\u2019s already dark and it\u2019s not safe for a girl to be alone outside.\u201d\n At that time, Yan Jiang was only nine years old and was already very good at doting on others.\n Nan Yiyi ended this touching memory. She gently wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and said in a choked voice, \u201cHe loves me very much. He can\u2019t bear to reject me.\u201d\n Nan Ketong frowned slightly at Nan Yiyi\u2019s words.\n \u201cMother.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi replied, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n Nan Ketong suddenly asked, \u201cWill you treat me the same way you treated Yan Jiang in the future?\u201d\n Nan Ketong was slightly afraid. He clenched his glass and gritted his teeth. \u201cMother, don\u2019t hurt me like this. I will be very sad.\u201d\n Nan Ketong felt suffocated at the thought of being used and deceived by her own mother.\n Hearing this, Nan Yiyi froze.\n She rubbed her arms and gave Nan Ketong a faint smile to comfort him. \u201cMother loves you the most. How can I lie to you and use you? I don\u2019t have the intention to lie to your brother. I just can\u2019t watch you die. I have no choice.\u201d\n Nan Ketong was convinced by Nan Yiyi.\n Nan Yiyi stayed in the ward with Nan Ketong until 10pm. She only returned home when she saw that he was sleepy.\n Only after reaching home did she have the time to play with her cell phone.\n In the past, in order to pay attention to Yan Jiang\u2019s life, Nan Yiyi had downloaded Weibo and played it for a few years. After Yan Jiang retired from the entertainment circles and stopped acting, there were fewer and fewer trending topics related to him on Weibo. As a result, Nan Yiyi seldom used Weibo.\n Yesterday, Yan Jiang\u2019s video of her appearing together in Disneyland was posted on Weibo. It attracted many suspicions and speculations, and she did not know how the online comments were now.\n Nan Yiyi was still worried about this. After taking a shower and having some time, Nan Yiyi put on a facial mask, leaned against the head of the bed, sat down, and opened Weibo.\n The moment Nan Yiyi opened Weibo, she saw the trending topic # Yan Jiang\u2019s parentage #.\n Nan Yiyi opened a trending topic.\n Only then did Nan Yiyi know that the netizens had dug up Yan Jiang\u2019s background in just one day, including his perverted father and his mother who couldn\u2019t stand the gossip and abandoned him.\n With this, the entire internet knew that Nan Yiyi was a cold-hearted woman who did not want her husband and abandoned her child!\n Nan Yiyi finished reading the revelations about the rain in July. Her eyes were dark and her face was dark.\n Are these people all sharp-tongued?\n It\u2019s already so many years ago. Is there a point in harping on this?\n Nan Yiyi threw her cell phone away in anger.\n It took Nan Yiyi some time to fall asleep. After that, she had a strange dream.\n She dreamed of her teenage years, following Yan Rufeng every day and chasing after his back. But his eyes and heart were filled with another person.\n Nan Yiyi dreamed of the time when she first gave birth to Yan Jiang. When she was pushed out of the delivery room by the nurse, she hugged the child and smiled happily at Yan Rufeng. But Yan Rufeng frowned as he stared at the child in her arms.\n All sorts of demons and monsters appeared in the dream. The contents of the dream were also in a mess. In the end, Nan Yiyi saw a little boy.\n Holding a cute, honest piggy bank account, the little boy tiptoed and said to her innocently, \u201cMother, I will give you all the money. Don\u2019t be sad, alright?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was awake.\n She opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling in a daze.\n She couldn\u2019t even remember the contents of her dream, but she remembered Yan Jiang\u2019s handsome and innocent face when she was young. Nan Yiyi covered her face with a pillow and felt a lump in her heart.\n Sorry, Jiang Jiang.\n \u2013\n Yan Jiang video-called Song Fei before he went to bed. Song Fei was still busy at the research institute. She placed her cell phone in front of an instrument and found an open field for Yan Jiang to watch her from all sides.\n Yan Jiang quietly observed Song Fei in her working state. Song Fei, who was immersed in her research, looked less unruly and quiet, like a female scientist.\n Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t resist taking a screenshot of the video. He censored all the equipment and data in the screenshot and posted Song Fei on his Weibo page.\n Yan Jiang: My girlfriend is so charming at work.\n After posting on Weibo, Yan Jiang stared at Song Fei for a while more, before falling asleep.\n The next morning, Yan Jiang woke up to find his cell phone still standing on the bedside table, leaning against the hotel\u2019s tissue box.\n He actually forgot to turn off the video last night and just fell asleep.\n Reaching out, he placed his cell phone under the blanket and pressed the unlock button. Only then did he realize that his cell phone was out of battery. Yan Jiang plugged his cell phone into the charger and laid in bed for a while before getting up to wash up.\n He was shaving when his cell phone rang.\n Yan Jiang gritted his teeth as he walked over and picked up his ringing cell phone.\n Lowering his head, he saw that it was Nan Yiyi calling. Yan Jiang pretended not to see and waited for it to finish ringing, before going back to brushing his teeth. Just as he finished brushing his teeth, his cell phone rang again.\n Yan Jiang slowly walked to the bed and sat down. Just as his cell phone was about to stop ringing, he picked up the call unhurriedly.\n \u201cJiang Jiang?\u201d Nan Yiyi\u2019s tone was cautious, as if she was testing his temper.\n Yan Jiang stared at the glass door of the toilet and saw his reflection on the glass panel. He smiled coldly, but his voice sounded very gentle and patient. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mother?\u201d\n Hearing that Yan Jiang was still willing to call her mother, Nan Yiyi finally relaxed.\n \u201cJiang Jiang, are you awake?\u201d\n Yan Jiang glanced at the time.\n It was 8am.\n As his cell phone was out of battery and his alarm clock didn\u2019t ring, Yan Jiang woke up half an hour later than usual.\n He said, \u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201d\n Sensing that Yan Jiang was not going to speak much today, Nan Yiyi, who was a smart person, immediately thought that Yan Jiang might have been affected by the comments on Weibo yesterday.\n \u201cJiang Jiang, I saw Weibo.\u201d Nan Yiyi\u2019s voice became softer, like she was a guilty person repenting. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d\n Yan Jiang remained silent.\n He looked at the person in the glass mirror. That man\u2019s eyes were cold and his gaze no longer held any hope for motherly love.\n Yan Jiang smiled at the mirror. \u201cMother, it\u2019s all in the past. Don\u2019t mention those things again.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was upset for a moment before saying, \u201cI saw them say that after I left, you were often bullied by your classmates. Is that true?\u201d\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t deny it.\n Nan Yiyi started crying on the other end of the phone. She apologized to Yan Jiang in tears. \u201cJiang Jiang, I really didn\u2019t know that you were living such a life. Those children bullied you. Why didn\u2019t you bully them back?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said faintly, \u201cYour father is a pervert and you are a jinx. Even your mother doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d He paused and laughed self-deprecatingly before saying, \u201cThat\u2019s what those people said when they bullied me.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was so stunned that she forgot to speak.\n She heard Yan Jiang say, \u201cThey\u2019re right. I do have a perverted father and a mother who abandoned me. They didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Why should I retort?\u201d\n Being born in such a family was a crime.\n Hearing this, Nan Yiyi just cried bitterly.\n Yan Jiang listened quietly, his heart as still as water.\n Apart from Song Fei, very few people in this world could move his heart with just a few crocodile tears.\n After Nan Yiyi was almost done crying, Yan Jiang said, \u201cI will be going back the day after tomorrow. Mother, are you still free these two days?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi hurriedly said, \u201cOf course I am free, Jiang Jiang.\u201d\n \u201cLet me accompany you for a few more days then. Once I go back this time, it will be very difficult to apply for leave again.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll make the arrangements.\u201d\n Since Nan Yiyi said that she would make the arrangements, everything was really arranged.\n At noon, she brought Yan Jiang to a restaurant on sea in Feng City for lunch. In the afternoon, Nan Yiyi booked a luxurious yacht and went out to sea with Yan Jiang.\n The yacht was cruising very slowly. Yan Jiang was standing on the deck fishing. Under the rays of the setting sun, his silhouette looked exceptionally stylish.\n Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t resist taking out her cell phone and snapping a photo of Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang turned to look at Nan Yiyi and suddenly asked, \u201cMother, do you know how to swim?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi said, \u201cI\u2019ve only swam in the pool and never in the sea. I\u2019m slightly afraid of the sea.\u201d The sea was too big. If a person died in the sea, it wouldn\u2019t be enough for a shark to swallow him whole.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how to swim.\u201d Yan Jiang smiled at Nan Yiyi and said, \u201cWhen I go back this time, I will learn how to swim.\u201d\n Yan Jiang took out his cell phone and recorded a video of the sea. After sending the video to Song Fei, he placed his cell phone on the deck.\n Staring at the hooked fishing rod, Yan Jiang said, \u201cThe fish has taken the bait.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was about to put away the fishing rod, but the fish was too big and bent the rod. Yan Jiang exclaimed. \u201cIt must be a big fish!\u201d\n Seeing that Yan Jiang was struggling, Nan Yiyi walked over barefooted and said, \u201cLet me help...\u201d\n \u201cAh!\u201d\n Before Nan Yiyi could finish speaking, Yan Jiang was suddenly pulled off the railing of the yacht by the fishing rod and rolled down into the deep sea.\n Nan Yiyi was stunned. She hurried over to the railing.\n Holding the railing, she looked down at the sea and shouted, \u201cJiang Jiang! Jiang Jiang, how are you?\u201d\n Yan Jiang popped his head out and slapped the surface of the sea with both hands. He shouted in panic, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to swim! Mother, save me!\u201d He opened his mouth and the seawater poured into it.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dare to speak again. He struggled a few times and his body started to sink slowly.\n Nan Yiyi was very anxious. She hesitated for a moment before jumping into the deep sea!\n The moment she jumped into the deep sea, Yan Jiang, who was submerged in the water, suddenly opened his eyes. He looked at the person who had jumped into the sea. In a desperate situation, a dying seed suddenly sprouted.\n The moment Nan Yiyi jumped into the sea, the seawater enveloped her. Her feet couldn\u2019t step on anything and she instantly felt flustered.\n Nan Yiyi popped her head out of the water. She took a deep breath and held her breath as she dived into the water.\n Nan Yiyi saw Yan Jiang, but he had already sunk a distance.\n Nan Yiyi was slightly hesitant.\n Can I really save Yan Jiang?\n It was said that drowning people would cling onto the savior tightly without letting go. There were even some who would climb up the savior\u2019s head under their survival instincts...\n Nan Yiyi took a deep look at Yan Jiang, who was sinking. She made up her mind and swam towards the yacht.\n From the moment she jumped into the sea to the moment she turned to leave, Yan Jiang saw everything.\n The moment Nan Yiyi turned around, something in Yan Jiang\u2019s heart broke completely. That little sapling that had just sprouted was broken by the wind and rain again.\n Nan Yiyi climbed onto the deck and started coughing.\n She coughed out the seawater and suddenly heard a splash.\n Nan Yiyi hurriedly stood up, ran to the railing, looked down, and saw Yan Jiang swimming out of the sea himself. His hands were tightly grabbing the deck of the cruise ship as he laid there unmoving.\n Overjoyed, Nan Yiyi scrambled down, grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s arms, and dragged him out of the water with great difficulty.\n Yan Jiang laid on the deck and narrowed his moist eyes at Nan Yiyi. \u201cI thought I would die.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi hurriedly performed CPR on him. Nan Yiyi pressed down on Yan Jiang\u2019s chest and saw him spewing out large mouthfuls of seawater. Only then did Nan Yiyi relax.\n Nan Yiyi sat down on the wet deck and cried. \u201cJiang Jiang, you really scared me to death!\u201d\n Yan Jiang laid on the deck and allowed the seawater to wash over him.\n He looked up at the blue sky and said, \u201cI thought I would die in the sea.\u201d\n Beside her ear, Nan Yiyi was crying very sadly. She said, \u201cI jumped into the sea to save you just now but didn\u2019t see you. Where did you sink to just now?\u201d\n Didn\u2019t see me?\n She had obviously seen me and was afraid, so she decided to give up his life.\n Yan Jiang thought: Nan Yiyi might have some love for me, but she will always love herself the most.\n More than 10 years ago, Nan Yiyi abandoned Yan Jiang and left home because she couldn\u2019t stand the rumors.\n More than a decade later, because she was afraid that she would die in the sea, Nan Yiyi abandoned her son once again and chose to escape on her own.\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s selfishness disappointed Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I nearly died, but I suddenly thought of Song Fei. I haven\u2019t married Song Fei yet. How can I die?\u201d\n Love gave him strength.\n Hearing this, Nan Yiyi smiled through her tears again. \u201cDoes Song Fei know that you love her so much?\u201d\n \u201cWho knows?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi helped Yan Jiang back to his room.\n After changing clothes, Yan Jiang laid on the bed. The boat swayed and Yan Jiang quickly fell asleep.\n When she woke up, their yacht was already ashore.\n Nan Yiyi asked Yan Jiang, \u201cAre you hungry? Mother knows of a very delicious restaurant and wants to bring you to try their dishes.\u201d\n Yan Jiang, who had just survived a disaster, was not in good spirits. Hearing this, he acknowledged mildly, got into the car, and followed Nan Yiyi to that restaurant.\n Nan Yiyi had reserved a table in advance and the dishes were ready by the time they arrived.\n Nan Yiyi brought Yan Jiang into the dining room. The manager walked over from behind and smiled at Nan Yiyi. \u201cMs. Nan, you brought your son over for dinner again!\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s clothes were wet previously and he was wearing a simple t-shirt and black pants.\n From the back, he looked somewhat like Nan Ke Tong.\n The manager walked over from behind. The moment he saw Nan Yiyi standing with a young man, he mistook Yan Jiang for Nan Ketong.\n In reality, the 13-year-old Nan Ketong was slightly shorter and thinner than Yan Jiang, both in terms of figure and height.\n It was strange that the manager could see it wrongly.\n Yan Jiang stood behind Nan Yiyi with his arms crossed. He wanted to see what would happen next.\n Nan Yiyi turned back awkwardly, grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s hand, turned around, and said to the manager, \u201cThis is my eldest son.\u201d She was talking about his eldest son, not his son.\n Yan Jiang raised his brows and put on a doubtful expression.\n The manager was slightly stunned to see a ridiculously handsome face. After recognizing Yan Jiang, the manager immediately recalled the rumors about Yan Jiang and Nan Yiyi these two days.\n It looked like Yan Jiang and Nan Yiyi were really mother and son.\n The manager smiled slightly and nodded at Yan Jiang. \u201cMr. Yan, welcome.\u201d\n \u201cHave you prepared the dishes?\u201d Nan Yiyi asked the manager.\n \u201cIt\u2019s already done. This way please.\u201d\n The manager personally brought Nan Yiyi and Yan Jiang to the private room.\n The manager closed the door and left.\n After Yan Jiang sat down, he looked down and played with his cell phone without saying a word.\n Nan Yiyi carefully sized up Yan Jiang\u2019s expression. She saw that his lips were pursed and was clearly slightly displeased.\n Nan Yiyi knew what Yan Jiang was thinking.\n She grabbed the disinfectant bowl and chopsticks that were covered in plastic bags and asked Yan Jiang anxiously, \u201cJiang Jiang, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Yan Jiang put down his cell phone.\n The cell phone landed on the table with a loud thud.\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s brows twitched, but she pretended to be calm and smiled. \u201cJiang Jiang, are you angry?\u201d\n Yan Jiang leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs. He tapped the back of his cell phone gently and narrowed his eyes at Nan Yiyi. Holding back his anger, he asked her, \u201cI am your eldest son. Who is your youngest son?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi remained silent as panic flashed across her face.\n He had indeed sensed something amiss.\n Yan Jiang questioned Nan Yiyi. \u201cDo you have another son?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi bit her lower lip so hard that it was bleeding.\n Unable to get Nan Yiyi\u2019s reply, Yan Jiang picked up his cell phone and got up to leave.\n Seeing that Yan Jiang was about to leave, Nan Yiyi panicked and hurriedly said, \u201cJiang Jiang, I have another son!\u201d\n Yan Jiang stood rooted to the ground.\n With his back facing Nan Yiyi, Yan Jiang\u2019s lips curled into a devilish smile.\n He knew very well that Nan Yiyi had brought him to this restaurant to let him know that she had a son. As a person with a bad temper, Yan Jiang naturally had to make an issue out of it.\n Nan Yiyi walked over in her high heels. She grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s hand and pulled him back to his seat.\n Yan Jiang sat down and lowered his head without looking at Nan Yiyi.\n Nan Yiyi observed Yan Jiang\u2019s reaction carefully, but he didn\u2019t want to look up, so Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t guess his mood.\n Nan Yiyi said softly, \u201cI do have a son. He is 10 years younger than you and 13 years old this year.\u201d\n Hearing this, Yan Jiang sneered and said in a sarcastic manner, \u201cYou\u2019ve only left me for two years and already had a child with someone else. Mother, you\u2019re so quick and have such a good mentality.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s words were like thorns of roses piercing Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart.\n But Nan Yiyi didn\u2019t dare to say anything.\n Yan Jiang took out his cigarette case and started smoking.\n She placed her hand under the table and pinched the back of her left hand with her right hand. It hurt badly. Nan Yiyi cried. She complained to Yan Jiang, \u201cJiang Jiang, it\u2019s not what you think. Mother was deceived by a man!\u201d\n Holding the cigarette between his fingers, Yan Jiang exhaled a puff of smoke at Nan Yiyi. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi said, \u201cI came to Feng City and was a cashier at a nightclub. As I was slightly pretty, I was targeted by the nightclub boss.\u201d\n \u201cHe... He forced me to have sex with me. After that, he coaxed me and said that he liked me and couldn\u2019t control himself, so he did something wrong.\u201d\n \u201cThat man looks well-dressed and is very good at coaxing women. Meanwhile, after being hurt by your father, it\u2019s rare for me to meet an outstanding man again, so I was moved.\u201d\n \u201cI got pregnant very quickly. We were planning to have the child. When the child was seven months old, that man suddenly went missing.\u201d\n \u201cI gave birth to the child alone. Later on, I realized that the boss was already married and came from a very powerful family. His wife is also a lady from a wealthy family of equal social status.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi lowered her head in tears. She sobbed and said intermittently, \u201cI was deceived by that man and even had a child with him. What can I do after knowing the truth? I can\u2019t possibly break up someone else\u2019s family!\u201d\n \u201cAll these years, I\u2019ve brought your brother up to this point alone. It hasn\u2019t been easy for me either.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi hurriedly took a few tissues to wipe her tears.\n She was crying very sadly and her words sounded very sincere. If Yan Jiang had not investigated Nan Yiyi\u2019s past, he might really have believed her.\n But knowing the truth, watching Nan Yiyi\u2019s performance was like watching a clown.\n He was already sick of Nan Yiyi, but Yan Jiang\u2019s ultimate goal had yet to arrive. He could only endure it.\n Yan Jiang looked indignant as he asked angrily, \u201cWho is that man?!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi shook her head. \u201cHow many years has it been? I\u2019ve already waved goodbye to my previous life. I won\u2019t think about those people and those things anymore.\u201d\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who that man is anymore.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s important is the present and the future. To me, the most important people now are you and your brother.\u201d\n Her words were sincere, but Yan Jiang felt so disgusted that he wanted to vomit.\n Yan Jiang took a few deep breaths to calm down before asking Nan Yiyi, \u201cWhat\u2019s his name... that child?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi said softly, \u201cNan Ketong.\u201d\n \u201cNan Ketong...\u201d Yan Jiang suddenly smiled.\n Nan Yiyi looked up in surprise and stared at Yan Jiang, who was holding a cigarette and smiling like a demon. She felt puzzled. \u201cWhat are you laughing at, Jiang Jiang?\u201d\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring him over to meet me?\u201d Yan Jiang snorted. \u201cThe last time I went to your house, you told me that you lived alone. If you lived alone, what about that child? He couldn\u2019t have been fetched by his father, right?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s eyes reddened slightly. She shook her head and said, \u201cNo, Tong Tong...\u201d\n \u201cTong Tong...\u201d\n Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t utter a complete sentence.\n Yan Jiang frowned. After Nan Yiyi calmed down, he asked, \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi said sadly, \u201cHe is ill and has leukemia. He is still hospitalized.\u201d\n Yan Jiang fell silent.\n In the private room, only Nan Yiyi\u2019s sobs could be heard.\n After a long while, Yan Jiang said despondently, \u201cNow that medical skills are advanced, there must be a way to treat leukemia.\u201d\n \u201cYes, if we change the bone marrow, there is still a chance of survival.\u201d\n \u201cChange then.\u201d Yan Jiang looked at Nan Yiyi\u2019s jewelry and said, \u201cAre you short of money? If you are short of money, I can give it to you. I have also made a lot of money these few years.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart warmed slightly.\n She shook her head. \u201cThank you, Jiang Jiang. Your brother will be very happy to know that you have such intentions. I am not short of money, but...\u201d\n Nan Yiyi looked hesitant. \u201cIt\u2019s just that after that man\u2019s wife found out about Tong Tong, in order to completely kill us, she contacted the higher-ups and cut off the source of his bone marrow.\u201d\n Yan Jiang frowned. \u201cWe are in a society ruled by law now. How capable must she be to dare to do such a thing? She is committing murder!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was relieved to see Yan Jiang\u2019s indignant expression as he defended his brother.\n Since Yan Jiang cared so much about his younger brother, he should agree to donate his bone marrow to Tong Tong.\n Nan Yiyi said, \u201cWe can\u2019t win against him with our thin arms. That man\u2019s family is so powerful that we really can\u2019t compete with him. Jiang Jiang, you have also been in the entertainment circle for a few years. You should understand that sometimes, power can indeed control everything.\u201d\n Yan Jiang remained silent.\n The older one was, the more they could recognize reality.\n Yan Jiang was indignant again. He said, \u201cAre we just going to wait for him to die? How old is he? 13? Or 14? He is still at such a young age and the excitement of his life has yet to start. How cruel is it to just leave like this...\u201d\n Nan Yiyi nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, I feel terrible at the thought of Tong Tong dying.\u201d\n Yan Jiang remained silent for a moment before asking, \u201cIs there no other way?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi bit her lips and hesitated.\n Yan Jiang lost his temper and growled at Nan Yiyi. \u201cTell me, why are you hiding it!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi told Yan Jiang, \u201cI have already done an HLA match with Tong Tong, but the results are not ideal. There might be a serious rejection after the surgery.\u201d\n \u201cIf the rejection is too big, he won\u2019t be able to keep his life.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s shoulders shrank as she said in a small voice, \u201cPerhaps... perhaps you can give it a try. You are his elder brother and your blood type is the same. Both of you have Type A blood. Perhaps you can match his HLA?\u201d\n With that, Nan Yiyi secretly observed Yan Jiang\u2019s reaction.\n Yan Jiang remained expressionless and just smoked quietly.\n He took another stick.\n Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and couldn\u2019t help reminding Yan Jiang in a low voice, \u201cJiang Jiang, don\u2019t smoke so much. Smoking is bad for your health. For you and Song Fei to be better, don\u2019t smoke so much.\u201d\n Hearing Song Fei\u2019s name, Yan Jiang extinguished the cigarette and threw it into the teacup.\n He suddenly stood up and asked Nan Yiyi, \u201cWhich hospital?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was overjoyed.\n \u201cAre you going to visit your brother?\u201d\n \u201cGo for a compatible checkup.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi couldn\u2019t conceal the joy on her face.\n \u201cI will bring you there now!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi practically jogged as she brought Yan Jiang out of the restaurant.\n \u2013\n In the hospital, Nan Ketong knew that Yan Jiang was coming to visit him and was slightly nervous.\n He waited anxiously for dozens of minutes before Yan Jiang and Nan Yiyi arrived.\n Nan Yiyi pushed open the ward door and turned to Yan Jiang. \u201cJiang Jiang, this is your younger brother, Tong Tong.\u201d\n Yan Jiang entered the room and sized up the young man on the bed.\n The young man was 13 or 14 years old. He looked handsome for the first time. He had a very prominent nose and exquisite facial features. But because of his illness, his face was pale and his lips were cyanotic.\n Due to the chemotherapy, Nan Ketong had lost all his hair, but the young man loved beauty and put a hat on his head to cover his ugly bald head.\n Yan Jiang stared at this young man and remained silent.\n Nan Ketong recognized Yan Jiang. He looked at Nan Yiyi helplessly.\n Nan Yiyi gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cTong Tong, this is your elder brother. He is a big star. You must know him.\u201d\n Nan Ketong had already found out about Yan Jiang\u2019s identity from Nan Yiyi, but he had to act like he had just found out that his elder brother was Yan Jiang.\n Nan Ketong was stunned. She stammered. \u201cBrother... Brother? Yan Jiang is my brother?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi nodded.\n Nan Ketong gazed at the tall, handsome Yan Jiang. He blushed and lowered his head in embarrassment.\n Nan Yiyi turned and smiled apologetically at Yan Jiang. \u201cTong Tong is rather shy.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cMmm, I can tell.\u201d\n Yan Jiang wasn\u2019t familiar with Nan Ketong. In addition, Nan Ketong looked sickly and looked like he would die the next second. Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dare to speak to him.\n He went straight to the doctor to get a blood sample and sent it to Nan Ketong for a compatible examination.\n The results were out. The match was a success!\n Holding this medical report, Nan Yiyi cried tears of joy.\n She grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s arm and cried and smiled at him. \u201cJiang Jiang, this is great. You and Tong Tong are compatible. Tong Tong won\u2019t die now!\u201d\n Yan Jiang replied, \u201cMmm.\u201d\n After knowing that his elder brother had successfully matched with his HLA, Nan Ketong was slightly stunned by this pleasant surprise. He suppressed his excitement and asked Nan Yiyi, \u201cMother, I won\u2019t die?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi turned to look at Yan Jiang before nodding at Nan Ke Tong.\n Nan Ketong looked up at Yan Jiang and grinned at him, revealing a few white teeth. \u201cBrother, thank you!\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s heart quivered slightly at this address.\n Yan Jiang was troubled. Returning to the hotel, he told Song Fei about Nan Ketong.\n Song Fei saw the hesitation in Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes and understood his intentions. \u201cAre you soft-hearted?\u201d\n Yan Jiang instinctively said, \u201cHe\u2019s still so young and hasn\u2019t even started his life... You don\u2019t know how complicated my feelings were when I heard him call me elder brother.\u201d\n Song Fei took a deep look at Yan Jiang and asked him, \u201cAre we still going according to the original plan?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cThe plan remains unchanged.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Before the bone marrow surgery, Yan Jiang had more than 10 days to prepare. During this period, he had to draw a few hundred milliliters of blood in advance so that he could replenish his energy after the surgery.\n Yan Jiang made two trips to the hospital and stored 600 milliliters of blood. On the fourth day before the surgery, Yan Jiang was admitted to the hospital for the final injection to stimulate the growth of stem cells.\n Late at night, in the Yan Family\u2019s master bedroom.\n Xu Fangyuan and Yan Yu had just ended their lovemaking session. She was sweating profusely and feeling very uncomfortable. Xu Fangyuan went to the toilet to take a shower. When she came out, she saw her cell phone glowing.\n Xu Fangyuan picked up her cell phone and realized that her WeChat was flashing.\n Xu Fangyuan opened her WeChat and saw a friend called F. She had sent her a few messages.\n F: [Mrs. Yan, I saw that bitch Nan Yiyi at the hospital today. Her celebrity elder son seems to have successfully matched with her youngest son and is planning to undergo a marrow transplant tomorrow.]\n F: [This is the testing information sent to me by a relative of my hospital\u2019s Blood Testing Department. Look, a month ago, Nan Yiyi secretly did Yan Jiang and Nan Ketong\u2019s HLA compatibility test.]\n F: [I think that Nan Yiyi purposely acknowledged Yan Jiang because she wanted her elder son\u2019s bone marrow to save her younger son! Mrs. Yan, this cannot succeed. If it really succeeds, Nan Yiyi will definitely bring her youngest son and fight it out with you.]\n F: [But Yan Jiang is really pitiful.]\n Xu Fangyuan was so overwhelmed by this news that she forgot to ask who exactly F was. She just thought that it was a WeChat message from an unfamiliar friend she had accidentally added in the past.\n Xu Fangyuan zoomed in on that test report and saw that it was indeed from last month. She was instantly energized.\n Changing marrow?\n You want to use your eldest son\u2019s bone marrow to save your youngest son so that you can fight for the inheritance with my daughter?\n Alright, this old lady will make you waste your efforts!\n Special Note: I found a bug. Nan Yiyi left Yan Jiang when he was 12 years old. That child should be at least 10 years younger than Yan Jiang. As a result, I changed Nan Ketong\u2019s age to 13.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "225": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-226\n\n Chapter 225: I Treat You As My Little Brother  At dawn, a nurse came over to remind Yan Jiang of all sorts of things to take note of before the surgery.\n Yan Jiang and Nan Ketong\u2019s ward were next to each other. Before the surgery, Nan Ketong was very excited. His face reddened at the thought of being saved.\n Nan Yiyi was also very happy to see Nan Ketong so happy.\n After chatting with Nan Ketong for a while, Nan Yiyi went to the ward next door.\n Yan Jiang sat calmly on the bed and played with his cell phone.\n Knock knock.\n Hearing the knock on the door, Yan Jiang put down his cell phone and turned to look at Nan Yiyi. He called out with a smile, \u201cMother.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi walked over to the bed and sat down. She reached out tentatively to shake Yan Jiang\u2019s hand.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dodge.\n Nan Yiyi grew bolder. She grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s hand and asked, \u201cJiang Jiang, are you nervous?\u201d\n Yan Jiang shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bone marrow. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi asked him again, \u201cHow are you feeling now? Are you feeling very uncomfortable?\u201d\n After Yan Jiang was admitted to the hospital, he was injected with medication to stimulate the growth of stem cells for four consecutive days. These days, his waist had been in constant pain and he couldn\u2019t sleep well.\n Last night, Yan Jiang even asked the doctor for painkillers.\n He had rested the entire night and was in good spirits today.\n Hearing Nan Yiyi\u2019s question, Yan Jiang shook his head slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not very painful. I can endure it.\u201d\n Glancing at the time, Yan Jiang said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go to the operating theater.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, the doctor went to the operating theater to make preparations and I\u2019m waiting for his notice.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi asked him again, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the surgery. Aren\u2019t you going to call Song Fei?\u201d\n \u201cWe even chatted on video just now.\u201d Yan Jiang said, \u201cI need to post on Weibo to record it.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi wanted to stop Yan Jiang\u2019s actions, but felt that she had no right to do so and could only hold it in.\n Yan Jiang picked up his cell phone and asked Nan Yiyi with raised brows, \u201cMother, do you want to take a photo with me?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi nodded.\n The two of them took a photo together. Yan Jiang said, \u201cI will take a photo with Tong Tong as a memento.\u201d\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang arrived at Nan Ketong\u2019s ward.\n Upon seeing Yan Jiang, Nan Ketong smiled at him, revealing his white teeth. His innocent smile was very likable.\n \u201cBrother.\u201d\n Hearing Nan Ketong call him \u2018elder brother\u2019, Yan Jiang stopped and gave him a meaningful look.\n He waved his cell phone and asked Nan Ketong, \u201cAre you willing to take a photo with me?\u201d\n Nan Ketong nodded obediently. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang walked over, squatted beside Nan Ketong\u2019s bed, and took a photo with him.\n In front of the camera, Nan Ketong smiled sweetly and adorably.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI will make you look more energetic using photoshop.\u201d\n Nan Ke Tong said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Yan Jiang photoshopped the photo and posted it on Weibo.\n Yan Jiang: [Two pre-operative photos. Wait for our post-operative selfies. @ Ke Lan\u2019s little fan. Picture.jpg / photo.jpg]\n Ke Lan\u2019s little fan was Nan Ketong\u2019s Weibo name. Yan Jiang had followed him the day before yesterday.\n In the photo, Yan Jiang and Nan Ketong were both wearing hospital gowns. When his fans saw this, they left messages asking him what was wrong with his body and if he was sick.\n Yan Jiang answered an old fan\u2019s question.\n Yan Jiang: My younger brother has leukemia and I\u2019m fortunate to have my bone marrow successfully compatible with hsm. There is still half an hour before the marrow transplant surgery. Wish for our surgery to be a success! / / @ Yan Family\u2019s Little Ah Hua: Pre-operative? Shock Face. What happened to Brother Jiang? Give us an accurate reply!\n After seeing Yan Jiang\u2019s reply, many fans praised him for being kind and selfless, while others scolded him for being silly.\n Everyone knew that Yan Jiang was an orphan and an only child. He didn\u2019t have a younger brother!\n Then where did this little brother who suddenly appeared come from?\n Isn\u2019t it silly to donate bone marrow to your cheap brother?\n Yan Jiang closed Weibo and returned to his operating theater. He was about to turn off his cell phone and lock it in the drawer when his cell phone suddenly rang.\n It was an unknown number that belonged to Wangdong City.\n Thinking that an old friend had changed his number, Yan Jiang answered the call. \u201cHello.\u201d\n \u201cJiang Jiang.\u201d Yan Rufeng\u2019s steady voice sounded from the phone receiver.\n Yan Jiang was slightly surprised to suddenly hear Yan Rufeng\u2019s voice.\n His face was cold as he said mockingly, \u201cI don\u2019t remember giving my cell phone number to Director Yan.\u201d\n Yan Rufeng said, \u201cI asked Mr. Han for it.\u201d\n Yan Jiang scolded Han Zhan in his heart.\n Yan Jiang remained silent and Yan Rufeng also felt awkward. Yan Rufeng said, \u201cAre you really going to donate your bone marrow to that child?\u201d\n It looked like Yan Rufeng knew about Nan Yiyi\u2019s current lifestyle.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cYes, I can\u2019t just watch a young child die. I just need to donate some bone marrow and rest for a few months.\u201d\n Yan Rufeng sighed. \u201cDonating the bone marrow might not pose any obvious harm to you now, but the future is uncertain. Although the doctors say that donating the bone marrow is a good thing and is harmless to the body, think about it\u2014the bone marrow has been extracted\u2014how can it be fine?\u201d\n \u201cJiang Jiang, think twice!\u201d\n Yan Rufeng couldn\u2019t stop or influence Yan Jiang\u2019s decision, but there were definitely drawbacks to donating bone marrow. Yan Rufeng had to remind Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang sneered and asked Yan Rufeng, \u201cWhat right does a heartless and perverted man who abandoned his own flesh and blood have to persuade me to cherish my own health?\u201d\n Yan Rufeng was speechless.\n \u201cI\u2019m hanging up.\u201d Yan Jiang was about to hang up when he heard Yan Rufeng suddenly say, \u201cI\u2019m downstairs at your hospital. Can I wait for you outside the operating theater?\u201d\n Yan Jiang was shocked. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d He thought he had heard wrongly.\n Yan Rufeng said, \u201cDownstairs at your hospital.\u201d\n Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cHow did you know...\u201d Needless to say, it must be that Han Zhan again.\n \u201cUp to you!\u201d Yan Jiang hung up stubbornly.\n But Yan Rufeng could hear some anticipation in Yan Jiang\u2019s arrogant reply.\n After hanging up, Yan Rufeng alighted. When he entered the lift, he met a woman in a yellow cheongsam.\n Xu Fangyuan was slightly stunned to see Yan Rufeng.\n \u201cMr. Yan?\u201d As the lover of Yan Yu, Xu Fangyuan had met Yan Rufeng several times when she went to Wangdong City to attend a commercial event with him.\n They weren\u2019t familiar with each other, but they had met several times.\n Yan Rufeng entered the lift and pressed the button to close the door. He turned and stared at the man dressed like a reporter on the left side of Xu Fangyuan. He asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you doing, Mrs. Yan?\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan smiled and said mysteriously, \u201cTo catch a poisonous scorpion!\u201d\n Yan Rufeng raised her brows and didn\u2019t answer.\n The lift stopped on the ninth floor and the two of them were about to walk out when they noticed each other\u2019s actions. They were stunned again.\n Yan Rufeng asked Xu Fangyuan, \u201cMadam Yan, you\u2019re also going to the ninth floor?\u201d\n \u201cMr. Yan too?\u201d\n Yan Rufeng nodded.\n Yan Rufeng took a step back and waited for Xu Fangyuan to exit the lift before walking out behind her.\n After exiting the lift, the two of them turned and walked to the right. On the right was the inpatient area, on the left was the Hematology Department, and on the right was the Neurology Department.\n Standing in the middle of the two departments, Xu Fangyuan smiled and told Yan Rufeng, \u201cMr. Yan, I am going to the Hematology Department.\u201d\n Yan Rufeng said, \u201cWhat a coincidence. I\u2019m going to the Hematology Department too.\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan smiled again. \u201cShall we go together then?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The two of them passed through a corridor and stopped at Room 15 and 16 respectively.\n The door was open and they could see the scene in the ward in front of them.\n Yan Rufeng saw a thin, sickly young man sitting in the ward in front of Xu Fangyuan. A beautiful woman was talking to that young man.\n Meanwhile, Xu Fangyuan saw that handsome young man in the ward in front of Yan Rufeng.\n Xu Fangyuan looked at Yan Rufeng and then at Yan Jiang. She suddenly understood.\n Yan Rufeng\u2019s surname was Yan. She was already in her early fifties and his lover was Han Chenyi...\n Everything matched.\n Xu Fangyuan couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect Nan Yiyi\u2019s ex-husband to be Mr. Yan.\u201d\n Hearing Xu Fangyuan\u2019s words, Yan Rufeng was rather surprised. \u201cMadam Yan, you know Nan Yiyi?\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan\u2019s lips curled up as she sneered. \u201cNot only do I know her, she even gave birth to a son for my husband.\u201d\n Yan Rufeng frowned and remained silent.\n Xu Fangyuan took two steps forward and knocked on Nan Ke Tong\u2019s ward door.\n Hearing the knock, Nan Yiyi and Nan Ketong turned to look at the door at the same time. At the same time, Yan Jiang also heard the knock. He looked up and saw Yan Rufeng rushing over to the hospital.\n Looking at Yan Rufeng, Yan Jiang\u2019s expression was very complicated. He didn\u2019t call Yan Rufeng in to sit, but didn\u2019t chase him away either.\n Yan Rufeng walked in and stared at Yan Jiang\u2019s face for a moment. He suddenly said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t rested well these few days?\u201d\n Yan Jiang acknowledged.\n Yan Rufeng added, \u201cAfter the surgery, nourish yourself well. It\u2019s not a small matter to have your bone marrow extracted.\u201d\n Yan Jiang replied, \u201cMmm.\u201d\n His son\u2019s cold attitude hurt Yan Rufeng slightly.\n Yan Rufeng was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cJiang Jiang, don\u2019t be afraid. Father is waiting for you outside.\n Yan Jiang lowered his head and didn\u2019t respond.\n Just then, there was a commotion next door.\n Yan Rufeng frowned and saw Yan Jiang striding towards the room next door. He followed behind him and went to the room next door.\n The room next door was packed.\n Nan Yiyi, her son Nan Ketong, and the beautifully-dressed Xu Fangyuan.\n Two men were standing on each side of Xu Fangyuan. One was a reporter and the other was a bodyguard.\n The reporters were taking photos with their cameras and the bodyguard was also holding a cell phone with the camera aimed at Nan Yiyi.\n Nan Yiyi protected Nan Ketong and fought against Xu Fangyuan.\n Xu Fangyuan heard footsteps and glanced sideways at Yan Jiang, who was rushing over.\n Xu Fangyuan saw Yan Jiang\u2019s displeased expression and smiled gently. She introduced herself. \u201cHello, Mr. Yan Jiang. It\u2019s our first meeting. May I introduce myself?\u201d\n Yan Jiang narrowed his eyes at Xu Fangyuan and asked her coldly, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan placed her hand on her chest and said in an exaggerated tone, \u201cI am Xu Fangyuan, the wife of your brother, Nan Ketong\u2019s biological father!\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n From the moment Yan Jiang entered the ward, Nan Yiyi\u2019s expression looked slightly off.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t have the time to observe Nan Yiyi\u2019s reaction. He stared at Xu Fangyuan, clenched his fists, glared at her, and scolded her. \u201cYou still have the cheek to come here! Your husband deceived my mother\u2019s feelings, deceived her heart and body, and abandoned her when she was pregnant!\u201d\n \u201cHow can you still have the cheek to strut around in this state?!\u201d\n Hearing Yan Jiang\u2019s accusation, Xu Fangyuan blinked in confusion.\n What is this?\n Xu Fangyuan could understand every word that Yan Jiang said, but how could she be confused when they were put together?\n Xu Fangyuan glanced at Nan Yiyi strangely and asked, \u201cLittle slut, is this how you explain Nan Ketong\u2019s background to Yan Jiang?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi looked uneasy and didn\u2019t answer.\n Xu Fangyuan pointed at Nan Yiyi. She looked at Yan Jiang sympathetically and told him the ugly truth. \u201cYou were deceived by your mother.\u201d\n \u201cMy husband is not a scumbag who lies about marriage and relationships. That year, your mother took advantage of my husband being drunk to have a romantic time with him and secretly got pregnant with Nan Ketong! That year, when I was giving birth in the confinement period after my miscarriage, your kind and innocent mother came to my doorstep with a big belly to provoke me and flaunt that she was pregnant with a boy!\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan hated those memories.\n \u201cDo you think your mother is a good woman? A good woman would abandon her child and run away? A good woman would steal someone else\u2019s husband?\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan snorted.\n \u201cLook at your mother\u2019s expression. She looked like she had walked too much in the dark!\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan spoke eloquently and humiliated Nan Yiyi with just a few words.\n Nan Yiyi looked up in embarrassment and saw that Yan Jiang was looking at her suspiciously.\n Nan Yiyi instinctively shook her head to defend herself. \u201cJiang Jiang, don\u2019t listen to Xu Fangyuan\u2019s nonsense. She is distorting the truth!\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked softly, \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s true, you must believe me! I was once cheated on by your father and I was injured. How could I be the third party and ruin someone else\u2019s relationship!\u201d With the reporters taking photos, Nan Yiyi looked very aggrieved and innocent.\n Before Yan Jiang could speak, Yan Rufeng, who was standing behind him like a transparent person, suddenly walked out.\n He stared at Nan Yiyi\u2019s face and mocked her. \u201cIt has been so many years since we last met. Nan Yiyi, your ability to distort facts is getting better and better.\u201d\n Only when Yan Rufeng spoke did Nan Yiyi notice his existence.\n She looked at Yan Rufeng with widened eyes.\n \u201cRu... Rufeng...\u201d Nan Yiyi\u2019s eyes flickered with guilt.\u201d Why are you here...\u201d\n Yan Rufeng said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Rufeng. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi covered her mouth.\n Yan Rufeng revealed a shocking truth. \u201c28 years ago, if not for my mother\u2019s birthday, I wouldn\u2019t have gone home to accompany her for a drugged meal. How could you have climbed into my bed and gotten pregnant with my child?\u201d\n \u201cStarting as the third party and ruining other people\u2019s family happiness. If you, Nan Yiyi, claim to be second, no one will dare to claim to be first.\u201d\n After eating such a shocking piece of news, Xu Fangyuan\u2019s expression was very interesting.\n She looked at Yan Rufeng like she was looking at a good friend who was in the same boat.\n Yan Jiang was stunned by Yan Rufeng\u2019s words.\n This silliness was naturally a fake expression he had purposely put on.\n But he also felt it was ironic.\n He had already guessed that the relationship between Nan Yiyi and Yan Rufeng was very suspicious. He was afraid that his own birth was not expected or blessed by Yan Rufeng.\n Yan Jiang still felt disgusted when he heard the truth from Yan Rufeng.\n He felt disgusted by Nan Yiyi\u2019s actions.\n He also felt disgusted of being the son of such a woman.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s gaze towards Nan Yiyi gradually changed.\n Nan Ketong sat on the bed in a daze. He watched this scene in a daze, his heart in turmoil.\n What is going on?\n Nan Yiyi just kept shaking her head at Yan Jiang, wanting him to believe that she was innocent and kind-hearted.\n However, the warmth in Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes gradually disappeared and was replaced with coldness.\n Xu Fangyuan felt that the scene today was not lively enough and continued to fan the flames.\n Xu Fangyuan raised the document in her hand and made an exaggerated tsk-tsk sound. She said, \u201cMr. Yan, you don\u2019t know that this little bitch has more tricks up her sleeve than this. What\u2019s the big deal about climbing into a man\u2019s bed? Not only does she love climbing into different men\u2019s beds and having children with them, she also loves to scheme against her own son!\u201d\n At this point, Xu Fangyuan shot Yan Jiang a sympathetic look.\n Yan Jiang frowned, looking slightly uneasy.\n Xu Fangyuan waved the document in his hand and told everyone, \u201cThis document in my hand is a compatible HLA gene test report that must be done to replace the bone marrow. This report was done a month ago. The person being tested is Nan Ketong who is suffering from acute leukemia and...\u201d\n \u201cYan Jiang!\u201d\n Hearing this, Yan Jiang took a step back and leaned against the wall.\n Everyone present was a cunning fox. With just one sentence from Xu Fangyuan, they thought of a deeper level.\n Yan Jiang and Nan Yiyi had just reunited this month, but Nan Yiyi had tested Nan Ke Tong and her eldest son\u2019s DNA last month.\n What does this mean?\n This meant that Nan Yiyi had long had designs on Yan Jiang!\n Yan Rufeng understood the entire situation. He glared at Nan Yiyi and scolded. \u201cNan Yiyi, you\u2019re really not human. You even schemed against your own child. Do you even have a heart?!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was very ashamed. Her embarrassment turned into anger and she felt slightly out of sorts. She actually rushed towards Xu Fangyuan and raised her arm to slap her.\n The burly man behind Xu Fangyuan pulled Xu Fangyuan behind him and hid her behind him. He raised his cell phone and purposely provoked Nan Yiyi. He actually said, \u201cNan Yiyi, my cell phone is currently on live-stream and there are over 8 million fans watching. If you continue to attack, you will go to jail!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was stunned.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Her throat was hoarse as she asked sharply, \u201cLive-stream?\u201d\n Xu Fangyuan\u2019s head popped out from behind the burly man. She purposely stuck out her tongue to provoke Nan Yiyi. \u201cYes, we have been live-streaming the entire time. Our conversation just now has already been synchronized with the live-streaming platform. Now, more and more viewers are streaming into the platform.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s face was deathly pale and she was trembling with anger.\n Xu Fangyuan was in a wonderful mood.\n She added fuel to the fire. \u201cNan Yiyi, you\u2019re finished. You seduced Yan Rufeng to get pregnant with his child, seduced my husband to give birth to Nan Ketong, used his existence to blackmail my husband, and got the management rights of several supermarkets from him.\u201d\n \u201cYou purposely got close to Yan Jiang, acknowledged him, and accompanied him to Disneyland. It was just a way to make him happy and make him agree to donate his bone marrow to your youngest son!\u201d\n \u201cNan Yiyi, I\u2019ve never seen a woman more despicable than you.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi thought of how her perfect plan had been disrupted by that damned Xu Fangyuan. She thought of how Nan Ketong might die soon and how her eldest son, Yan Jiang, would also lose all hope in her. Nan Yiyi felt like killing someone!\n Nan Yiyi suddenly turned and ran to the cupboard by the bed. Holding the fruit knife, she raised it and chased after Xu Fangyuan!\n Xu Fangyuan hurriedly said to the bodyguard, \u201cGo, go, go, don\u2019t provoke this lunatic!\u201d\n The bodyguard was strong and muscular. Holding Xu Fangyuan in one hand, he hurried away from the disaster site like he was carrying a little chick.\n They came and went in a hurry.\n Nan Yiyi chased after her with a knife in hand, startling the nurses and patients in the hospital. Everyone ran up together and subdued the trembling Nan Yiyi.\n The head nurse personally came over with a rope, tied up Nan Yiyi\u2019s hands, and called the police.\n \u2013\n Outside the ward, Nan Yiyi was pinned to the ground like a dead dog. Unable to move, she cursed.\n \u201cXu Fangyuan, you bitch!\u201d\n \u201cYour man is a jerk who can\u2019t control his pants!\u201d\n \u201cYou are so vicious. You deserve to never have a son!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was cursing wildly.\n Inside the ward, the old and the young remained silent.\n Yan Jiang finally snapped out of his trance and looked at the young man on the bed with a complicated and doubtful expression.\n Nan Ketong lowered her head and didn\u2019t dare to meet Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes.\n \u201cYou already knew, right?\u201d Yan Jiang\u2019s words came out of nowhere, but he believed that Nan Ketong could understand.\n Nan Ketong remained silent and didn\u2019t dare to look up.\n The young man was still young and not a professional actor. His acting skills were flawed and he was not brave enough. His reaction was a silent admission.\n Yan Jiang smiled bitterly.\n He said, \u201cI treated you as my younger brother.\u201d\n Nan Ketong suddenly started sobbing.\n Yan Jiang was unmoved. He added. \u201cThese few days, I have to be injected with muscle medicine every morning and afternoon just to stimulate stem cell growth and to donate my bone marrow to you.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t have to bear all this pain.\u201d\n \u201cI treated you like a younger brother.\u201d Yan Jiang shook his head in disappointment. \u201cBut you treated me like a fool.\u201d\n Nan Ketong cried.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother!\u201d\n Nan Ketong covered her face with her hands and couldn\u2019t stop crying. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at first. I only heard my mother talk about your successful match with me on the day you and mother went to Disneyland.\u201d\n Nan Ketong was very ashamed.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother. I just want to live too much!\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

I just want to live too much!\u201d\n Nan Ketong cried as he spoke. His pitiful manner was heartbreaking.\n Yan Jiang stared at the young man coldly with a dark expression.\n A moment later, Yan Jiang snorted.\n Hearing the laughter, Nan Ketong looked up in confusion. Staring at Yan Jiang\u2019s mocking smile, Nan Ketong\u2019s face burned with embarrassment.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cYou wanted to live, so you joined your mother in deceiving me. Nan Ketong, at such a young age, who taught you to deceive your own family?\u201d\n Hearing Yan Jiang\u2019s question, Nan Ketong\u2019s lips quivered for a long while, but she couldn\u2019t say a word.\n Obviously, he also knew that lying to Yan Jiang was wrong.\n He knew that it was wrong but still wanted to do it. This was selfishness!\n At this moment, the doctor walked in.\n On the way here, the doctor had already heard the nurses talking about Nan Yiyi and the rest. After entering the ward, the doctor looked at Nan Ketong and Yan Jiang.\n He asked Yan Jiang, \u201cMr. Yan, are we still performing this surgery?\u201d\n Yan Jiang pursed his lips and remained silent.\n The doctor didn\u2019t urge him.\n Nan Ketong acutely sensed the hesitation in his elder brother\u2019s heart. He had to seize the opportunity to melt Yan Jiang\u2019s heart before he made up his mind.\n Nan Ketong started crying.\n Yan Jiang glanced at the child.\n Nan Ketong said tearfully, \u201cBrother, it doesn\u2019t matter even if you don\u2019t want to save me. Anyway, there\u2019s a possibility of rejection after the marrow swap surgery. It\u2019s still uncertain if I can survive. Moreover, Mother and I were the ones who deceived you first. It\u2019s normal for you not to be willing to give me your marrow.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fine. Anyway, this illness has tormented me so much that I wish I were dead. It\u2019ll be better if I can leave all of this behind sooner.\u201d\n Nan Ketong wiped her tears and looked up at Yan Jiang with reddened eyes. He had actually pleaded for mercy for Nan Yiyi.\n Nan Ketong said, \u201cBrother, don\u2019t blame Mother. She also loves you. All these years, my mother has always mentioned you to me. She said that Brother is very smart and very kind. He knew how to dote on her when he was young.\u201d\n \u201cMother said that the thing she regrets the most in her life is abandoning you and running away from home alone.\u201d\n \u201cBrother, when Mother left you back then, she was also forced into a corner. I don\u2019t beg you to forgive Mother. I just hope that after I die, you can occasionally come and accompany Mother. She is too lonely.\u201d\n \u201cI am very happy to be with my elder brother these few days. I used to envy those children who had elder brothers. Now, I also have an elder brother.\u201d\n \u201cBrother, thank you for being willing to accompany me.\u201d\n After saying that, Nan Ketong lowered his head to wipe his tears.\n Nan Ketong\u2019s words were sincere and moved one to tears. The eyes of the two young nurses behind the doctor had already reddened and the doctor fell silent.\n Amidst the silence, Yan Jiang spoke. \u201cI am relieved that Tong Tong understands me.\u201d\n Nan Ke Tong:!\n He looked up in shock and stared at the cold Yan Jiang in a daze.\n Yan Jiang actually rejected me?\n \u201c...Brother.\u201d\n Yan Jiang had taken an unusual path and actually refused to donate his bone marrow. This stunned Nan Ketong, who had originally planned to put on a pitiful act.\n Yan Rufeng raised her brows and looked at Yan Jiang with a smile in his eyes.\n Yan Jiang said to Nan Ketong, \u201cYou collaborated with Nan Yiyi to deceive me. Of course I won\u2019t donate my bone marrow to a little liar.\u201d\n Turning to look at the doctor, Yan Jiang nodded apologetically. \u201cSorry doctor, I won\u2019t donate this bone marrow.\u201d\n Although the doctor was surprised, he could understand.\n But as a doctor, the doctor still hoped to save every patient.\n He looked at Nan Ke Tong\u2019s youthful face and saw the reluctance and determination in the young man\u2019s eyes. The doctor couldn\u2019t bear it.\n The doctor couldn\u2019t help thinking and said to Yan Jiang. \u201cMr. Yan, look. This donated bone marrow shouldn\u2019t be too harmful to the body. After the surgery, you will recover after a few months of rest. But your bone marrow can save a life.\u201d\n \u201cNot to mention, Nan Ketong is still your younger brother. Even if he is an ordinary stranger, we hope that you will be generous enough to donate your bone marrow when the genome is suitable.\u201d\n \u201cSaving a life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda.\u201d\n A doctor was a benevolent doctor. He would save anyone he could, but Yan Jiang was a ruthless person.\n He said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019d rather donate my bone marrow to a stranger than to a selfish, naughty child.\u201d\n Considering that he had prepared for such a long time in order to donate this broken bone marrow, and now that he had even injected it with stem cell medicine, it would be a waste if he just said no.\n Yan Jiang suddenly said to the doctor, \u201cI will donate the bone marrow as usual, but the beneficiary cannot be Nan Ketong.\u201d\n Glancing meaningfully at Nan Ke Tong, Yan Jiang said firmly, \u201cLook again and see if there are any other patients with leukemia whose genes are compatible with mine. I am willing to donate my bone marrow to other patients!\u201d\n With that, Yan Jiang left Nan Ketong\u2019s ward.\n Arriving at the corridor, Yan Jiang heard a commotion. He turned to look at the end of the corridor and saw the police dragging the knife-wielding Nan Yiyi away.\n Yan Jiang walked towards Nan Yiyi and the rest.\n Yan Jiang strode quickly and blocked the police officer\u2019s path. He said politely, \u201cOfficer, this is my mother. I have a few words to say to her. Please excuse me.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was once an artist and now a forensic doctor. That police officer was even an old fan of his.\n That fan said, \u201cWhatever you have to say, you can only say it here.\u201d\n It was impossible for the police to allow a dangerous person holding a knife to leave their sight.\n \u201cSure.\u201d\n Yan Jiang took a step forward and his toes nearly touched Nan Yiyi\u2019s toes.\n Nan Yiyi still didn\u2019t know that Yan Jiang had rejected the offer to donate his bone marrow to Nan Ketong. Upon seeing Yan Jiang, Nan Yiyi\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cJiang Jiang, I might not be able to send it out anytime soon. I\u2019ll leave your brother to you!\u201d\n Yan Jiang shook his head.\n Nan Yiyi was slightly confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She felt slightly flustered.\n Yan Jiang smiled slightly. \u201cI won\u2019t donate my bone marrow to Nan Ketong.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was shocked. Her eyes widened as she questioned Yan Jiang in shock and anger. \u201cWhy! Yes, I lied to you, but that\u2019s your younger brother! Your younger brother is about to die and you can clearly save him. Why didn\u2019t you save him!\u201d\n Yan Jiang snorted. \u201cWhy should I save him? Why should I save a little demon who has learned to deceive others at such a young age?\u201d\n \u201cI can save people, but I don\u2019t save stupid things.\u201d\n Nan Yiyi was enraged. \u201cYan Jiang, you are inhuman!\u201d Due to Yan Jiang\u2019s rejection, Nan Yiyi suddenly tore off her gentle facade and scolded him.\n \u201cYou are a jerk. You don\u2019t even want to save your own brother. You are truly vicious and heartless!\u201d\n \u201cHow did I have a son like you!\u201d\n \u201cYou are too disappointing!\u201d\n Nan Yiyi, who had been holding Yan Jiang\u2019s hand this morning and asking about his well-being, suddenly seemed to have transformed into a different person.\n All sorts of nasty insults came out of Nan Yiyi\u2019s mouth.\n After Nan Yiyi finished scolding him, Yan Jiang said nonchalantly, \u201cSelfish, heartless, and vicious. These are all good qualities that I inherited from you, Mother.\u201d\n With a wicked smile, Yan Jiang added, \u201cNan Yiyi, ask yourself honestly\u2014 are you really saving Nan Ketong out of love?\u201d\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s pupils constricted. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cYou want to save him because you are just using him as a tool. A tool to snatch the assets of the Yan Family from Xu Fangyuan and her daughter.\u201d\n Yan Jiang leaned over and looked at Nan Yiyi\u2019s trembling pupils up close. He grinned and said in her ear, \u201cNan Ketong will die and your noble wife\u2019s dream will also shatter. How are you feeling?\u201d\n With that, without waiting for Nan Yiyi to react, Yan Jiang stood up and looked up at the police officers. \u201cThank you for your accommodation. We are done talking.\u201d\n The police officers escorted Nan Yiyi away.\n Yan Jiang turned and saw Yan Rufeng standing behind him with an unreadable expression. He raised an eyebrow at him.\n Leaning against the wall, Yan Jiang asked Yan Rufeng, \u201cWhat are you trying to say? Are you trying to say that I am heartless? That I am inferior to pigs and dogs? That I can\u2019t even save my own brother?\u201d\n Yan Rufeng shook his head.\n \u201cOh, then what are you trying to say?\u201d\n Yan Rufeng walked up and grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s arm. \u201cI want to say that if you\u2019re not feeling well, just lie down and rest more. Don\u2019t just stand there.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n He looked down at Yan Rufeng\u2019s pleased expression and suddenly smiled. \u201cYan Rufeng, you disgust me even more than Nan Yiyi.\u201d\n Yan Rufeng said, \u201cMmm, I guess so. After all, I am a pervert.\u201d\n Yan Jiang\u2019s vision suddenly blurred. He slapped Yan Rufeng\u2019s hand away and walked slowly back to the ward.\n I don\u2019t need a father.\n My parents were long dead and the grass around their graves were three meters tall.\n \u2013\n That afternoon, a patient who was compatible with Yan Jiang\u2019s gene was transferred to the First People\u2019s Hospital in Feng City. She was a young girl only two years old.\n She had a pair of clear black eyes and a smile on her face that revealed her pearly white teeth.\n Before the surgery, Yan Jiang met the little girl. She already knew how to speak. She greeted him obediently. \u201cUncle.\u201d\n Yan Jiang corrected her. \u201cYou have to call me elder brother.\u201d\n The little girl pointed at the roots of Yan Jiang\u2019s beard. \u201cBeard, Uncle.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n Yan Jiang had no choice but to agree, as he could not throw his temper at the little girl.\n At 10am in the morning, Yan Jiang was pushed into the operating theater. After being injected with anesthesia, he didn\u2019t know anything.\n When he woke up and opened his eyes, he realized that he had already returned to the ward.\n A slender girl was standing by the window of the ward.\n Yan Jiang blinked and got used to the glaring afternoon sun. Only then did he recognize that it was Song Fei.\n Song Fei was wearing a red leather jacket with a red and black checkered blouse. Her long, slender legs were wrapped under black tight pants.\n Her long black hair was tied into a high ponytail. She didn\u2019t have any makeup on, but she was wearing a pair of black diamond earrings.\n Song Fei did a shooting pose toward Yan Jiang, when she saw him wake up.\n Yan Jiang chuckled. \u201cAh Fei.\u201d When he opened his mouth to speak, Yan Jiang realized that his voice was hoarse.\n Song Fei walked over and grabbed Yan Jiang\u2019s hand.\n \u201cDon\u2019t speak.\u201d\n Yan Jiang really remained silent.\n Yan Jiang fell asleep again. The next time he woke up was that night. Yan Jiang smelled an alluring fragrance. He slowly sat up and saw Song Fei sitting by the small table eating spicy soup!\n How cruel!\n Yan Jiang secretly swallowed and asked softly, \u201cAh Fei, can we go out to eat?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cIf I eat in the ward, I\u2019ll only tempt you. If i eat outside, I\u2019ll tempt everyone in the hospital. What do you think?\u201d\n Yan Jiang rubbed his tummy.\n \u201cI\u2019m also hungry.\u201d\n Song Fei put down her chopsticks, got up, walked to Yan Jiang\u2019s bed, cupped the back of his head with one hand, lowered her head, and kissed him on the lips.\n Yan Jiang\u2019s eyes widened.\n After kissing for a while, Song Fei released Yan Jiang and asked him calmly, \u201cAre you still hungry?\u201d\n Staring at Song Fei\u2019s slender figure, Yan Jiang answered, \u201cI\u2019m even hungrier.\u201d It could be said that he was very hungry.\n Song Fei understood Yan Jiang\u2019s hint. She said, \u201cRest for two weeks and recover your lost bone marrow. We will have a good meal then.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was very sad.\n Song Fei carried the spicy soup and continued eating. Yan Jiang rubbed his hungry stomach and asked her, \u201cHow is Teacher Fu\u2019s work progressing?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cThe results are out. We are one step closer to completely curing the Ebola virus. I feel that we will be able to develop the antidote in less than two years.\u201d\n \u201cAmazing.\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d\n Song Fei threw away the spicy soup and returned to the ward. She retrieved a food container from the shelf.\n The food container was filled with porridge, meat and salt. Yan Jiang ate a big bowl.\n \u201cWhen can I be discharged?\u201d\n \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cThat little girl, was the surgery successful?\u201d\n Song Fei nodded. \u201cIt succeeded. I heard that it was very effective, but it depends on whether there will be any rejection later on.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Yan Jiang couldn\u2019t fall asleep for a long time. His lips parted and closed several times.\n Taking in Yan Jiang\u2019s hesitant expression, Song Fei knew what he was thinking. She suddenly said, \u201cYan Rufeng will undergo a gastrectomy tomorrow. Han Qingshen personally came over this afternoon to bring him back.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was shocked. \u201cThe surgery is tomorrow?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n He frowned and complained. \u201cHe\u2019s about to undergo surgery. Why was he still running around?\u201d\n Song Fei looked at Yan Jiang with a complicated expression. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d\n What could it be for?\n It was all because he still remembered Yan Jiang. He would be worried if he didn\u2019t see him.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "227": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-228\n\n Chapter 227: Ridiculous Fate, Beibei Gave Birth Prematurely  Song Fei knew that Yan Jiang was a person who didn\u2019t mean what he said. Although he said that Yan Rufeng was unstable, he must be very happy inside.\n Song Fei didn\u2019t intend to expose Yan Jiang.\n She laid down beside Yan Jiang, took out her cell phone, and opened the ticketing app. Song Fei chose a flight ticket as she said, \u201cWe will be discharged in the morning. We will go straight to the airport after that.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cMmm, sure.\u201d\n \u201cThen I will choose a flight that leaves at 1pm. It will be 2.45pm when we reach Wangdong City.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cWhatever.\u201d\n Song Fei bought two tickets and threw her cell phone on the bedside table. \u201cSleep.\u201d\n Yan Jiang reached out his long arm from behind Song Fei and hugged her slender waist. He suddenly said, \u201cI haven\u2019t hugged you for a long time.\u201d\n Song Fei grabbed his restless fingers and warned him. \u201cDon\u2019t be mischievous. If you start a fire, put it out yourself.\u201d\n Yan Jiang stopped moving.\n Song Fei narrowed her eyes for a while. When she woke up, it was already daytime. Yan Jiang had already taken off his hospital gown and put on his own.\n He had already packed up and even settled the discharge procedures.\n Seeing that Song Fei was finally awake, Yan Jiang told her, \u201cIt\u2019s 9am. It\u2019s time to get up.\u201d\n Song Fei sat up and stroked her messy hair. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping well recently. I didn\u2019t expect to have slept too long.\u201d\n Hearing this, Yan Jiang said, \u201cI remember you have six hours of sleep every day. You are so sleepy. Are you especially busy these few days?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right. In order to quickly finish my work and come see you, I only sleep four hours a day.\u201d Song Fei yawned and sat by the bed to put on her British boots.\n ]She checked the ward to make sure she hadn\u2019t forgotten anything before leaving the hospital with Yan Jiang. That morning, the two of them went straight to the airport and took a flight out of Feng City.\n As for Nan Yiyi and Nan Ketong, they had already been kicked out of their own worlds by Yan Jiang.\n It was 3pm when they arrived at Wangdong City.\n Yan Jiang was rather frail and weak. Song Fei carried all his luggage. Walking out of the airport, Yan Jiang saw Song Ci standing beside the car with a big tummy and stopped.\n He glanced at Song Ci\u2019s big tummy and said to Song Fei, \u201cIs Song Song going to give birth soon?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s still more than a month, less than two months.\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked Song Fei, \u201cHave you bought presents for her children?\u201d\n Song Fei was speechless.\n Song Fei, who was focused on research, had long forgotten about this.\n Yan Jiang chuckled and lectured Song Fei. \u201cYou are going to be an aunt soon. Aren\u2019t you going to buy some gifts for your two nieces?\u201d\n \u201cI will go buy it in two days.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n As they spoke, the two of them had already reached the side of the car.\n Song Ci was pregnant with twins, so her tummy was slightly bigger than most pregnant women. She had to support her waist with one hand and her pregnant belly with the other.\n Song Ci was relieved to see that Yan Jiang was in high spirits, but his face was slightly pale. \u201cYou look rather energetic. How is it? Does it hurt to draw your bone marrow?\u201d\n \u201cOnce the anesthesia hits me, I will be a pitiful little girl lying on the bed and being trampled by the doctor.\u201d Yan Jiang opened the car door for Song Ci, helped her into the car, and let Song Fei sit beside her.\n Yan Jiang sat in the passenger seat himself. He handed a cigarette to the driver, Long Yu, and thanked him. \u201cBrother Long, sorry to trouble you again.\u201d\n Long Yu waved his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. How can I say that it\u2019s tough?\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s stomach was too big and she couldn\u2019t even fasten her seatbelt. Song Fei bent over to help Song Ci fasten her seatbelt before Long Yu started the car.\n The car drove steadily for a while before Yan Jiang realized that this was neither the way home nor the way to Old Master Han\u2019s house.\n Yan Jiang turned to Long Yu. \u201cBrother Long, where are you taking us?\u201d\n Long Yu answered honestly, \u201cMadam asked me to take this path.\u201d\n Yan Jiang turned and frowned at Song Ci.\n Song Ci said, \u201cThe hospital.\u201d\n Yan Jiang guessed what Song Ci wanted to do and was slightly angry. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I was going to the hospital.\u201d\n Song Ci rubbed her tummy. \u201cI was the one who wanted to go for a fetal heart monitor.\u201d\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cI see...\u201d\n Long Yu parked the car under Wangdong City\u2019s First People\u2019s Hospital.\n Song Ci and Song Fei alighted first. They waited outside the car for a while before Yan Jiang alighted.\n Glancing up at the hospital building, Yan Jiang asked Song Ci, \u201cIs the prenatal checkup in that building?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll bring you guys there.\u201d\n Song Ci led Yan Jiang to the building behind the main building of the hospital. They entered the lift and Song Ci pressed level 6.\n Ding-Dong.\n Only when the three of them walked out of the lift did Yan Jiang realize that they had arrived at the operating theater level.\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n He glared at the innocent Song Ci.\n Song Ci pointed at Song Fei and betrayed her elder sister without hesitation. \u201cSong Fei asked me to do this.\u201d\n Yan Jiang looked at Song Fei again.\n Song Fei raised her brows arrogantly and asked him with a cold expression, \u201cI arranged it. Do you have a problem with that?\u201d\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dare to have any objections.\n Han Qingshen finished a call and turned to see Yan Jiang standing at the lift door in a daze.\n Han Qingshen was slightly surprised. She strode over to Yan Jiang and the other two.\n Han Qingshen put on high heels and was almost as tall as Yan Jiang. Today, she was wearing a gorgeous dark purple waist-length A-line dress. Her long hair was tied up as she stood in front of Yan Jiang with her arms crossed. She looked very imposing.\n Yan Jiang had heard from others that Han Chenyi was an overbearing man who looked down on everyone wherever he went.\n As Han Chenyi\u2019s daughter, Han Qingshen was naturally not inferior.\n After scrutinizing Yan Jiang from head to toe, Han Qingshen asked him, \u201cWhy did you get discharged? You didn\u2019t stay for more than two days.\u201d\n Han Qingshen\u2019s tone was very natural, as if she was talking to a family member.\n Yan Jiang felt slightly awkward in front of Han Qing.\n Although they were not related by blood, in Yan Rufeng\u2019s heart, Han Qingshen was the child he truly looked forward to and loved deeply. Meanwhile, Yan Jiang was just an illegitimate son created by a scheme.\n One could imagine how awkward it would be for an illegitimate child to face a real child.\n If not for Yan Jiang\u2019s thick skin, he would have found a hole to bury himself in.\n Han Qingshen could tell that Yan Jiang was feeling awkward. She pointed at the waiting area for the family members and said, \u201cSince you are already here, just sit down and wait. The surgery has already been completed and it was very successful. We are just waiting for him to wake up.\u201d\n \u201cMoreover, Uncle Yan will be very happy to see you after the surgery.\u201d\n Since he was already here, it would seem petty of him to leave now.\n Yan Jiang nodded and thanked Han Qingming. He then brought Song Fei and her sister to the waiting area to wait for Yan Rufeng.\n After waiting for more than 20 minutes, they heard an assistant doctor standing at the door shouting, \u201cYan Rufeng\u2019s family!\u201d Two people suddenly stood up at his shout.\n Song Fei and Song Ci looked at Yan Jiang, who suddenly stood up, and then at Han Qingshen, who stood up at the same time as him. They were slightly surprised.\n Yan Jiang quickly realized what he had done.\n He looked at Han Qingshen awkwardly for a few seconds before saying, \u201cI have diarrhea!\u201d With that, Yan Jiang hurried to the toilet.\n Song Fei said, \u201cLittle coward!\u201d\n There was a reason for calling him a coward.\n Han Qingshen and Bei Zhan walked to the door of the operating theater. After more than a minute, Yan Rufeng was pushed out by the assistant doctor.\n Bei Zhan and the nurse pushed the bed that had been prepared long ago over. Everyone worked together to move Yan Rufeng from the operating theater to the bed.\n During the process, Yan Rufeng opened his eyes and glanced at Han Qingshen.\n The effects of the anesthesia had yet to fade completely and Yan Rufeng was slightly groggy. He said something nonsensical that Han Qingshen didn\u2019t hear clearly, but she also cooperated with a few grunts.\n \u201cUncle Yan, Yan Jiang is here too.\u201d\n As Han Qingshen spoke, everyone saw Yan Rufeng\u2019s eyes widen slightly.\n Yan Rufeng\u2019s eyes darted around and scanned the faces of the youngsters surrounding her bed. He didn\u2019t find Yan Jiang.\n The glow in Yan Rufeng\u2019s eyes gradually dimmed.\n At this moment, Yan Jiang came back after his \u201cdiarrhea\u201d.\n Seeing that Song Fei was also gathered around the bed, he slowly walked up to her side. Coincidentally, his face was revealed to Yan Rufeng.\n Upon seeing Yan Jiang, Yan Rufeng raised his hand, pointed at him, and muttered a few words.\n Han Qingshen leaned close to Yan Rufeng and heard him say, \u201cJiang Jiang is here.\u201d\n Han Qingshen patted the back of Yan Rufeng\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYan Jiang is here. He knew that you were undergoing surgery today and specially came to visit you.\u201d\n Yan Rufeng seemed to be smiling.\n Yan Jiang seemed to blush.\n an Rufeng was pushed into an independent ward and all sorts of postoperative monitoring devices were put on him. Yan Jiang saw that Yan Rufeng\u2019s mental state was not bad and knew that he was out of danger, so he called Song Fei and the rest along to leave.\n Han Qingshen chased after him. \u201cYan Jiang.\u201d\n Yan Jiang stopped in his tracks.\n He didn\u2019t turn back.\n Han Qingshen told him, \u201cYan Jiang, I know you hate Uncle Yan, but it\u2019s not easy for Uncle Yan either.\u201d\n Seeing that Yan Jiang still didn\u2019t turn to look at him, Han Qingshen walked over.\n Upon seeing this, Song Ci pulled Song Fei\u2019s hand and said to Yan Jiang, \u201cMy elder sister is not feeling well. Let\u2019s go to the toilet.\u201d With that, Song Ci pulled Song Fei away.\n Going to the toilet was a universal excuse that applied to all sorts of situations.\n Only then did Yan Jiang turn and look at Han Qingshen.\n \u201cShall we have a chat?\u201d Han Qingshen asked Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang glanced at the Song sisters\u2019 departing figures and nodded slightly.\n Han Qingshen brought Yan Jiang to the resting area upstairs where there was a cafe. The pampered Han Qingshen was not used to the coffee here and only ordered a cup of water.\n Yan Jiang had a sharp tongue. He only drank freshly ground coffee.\n The two of them carried water and sat upright in a generous manner.\n Han Qingshen took a sip of warm water and suddenly smiled.\n Hearing the laughter, Yan Jiang shot Han Chao a puzzled look.\n Han Qingshen told Yan Jiang, \u201cI\u2019ve always known that Uncle Yan has a son, but out of respect, I\u2019ve never checked your identity. Even so, I know what kind of person you are.\u201d\n Yan Jiang asked her, \u201cHow am I like?\u201d\n Han Qingshen suppressed her laughter. \u201cTmid, gentle, and very sensible. He\u2019s a considerate and adorable little boy.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was speechless.\n Han Qing Shen said, \u201cThat\u2019s how Uncle Yan described you to me.\u201d\n Yan Jiang pursed his lips. \u201cI was indeed more gentle and sensible when I was young.\u201d But the cruel life that followed forced him to grow a body of thorns.\n Han Qingshen was naturally not foolish enough to ask Yan Jiang why he changed his character after he grew up.\n A smart person would never expose someone else\u2019s scars.\n Han Qingshen gazed at Yan Jiang\u2019s handsome face. \u201cActually, I should have realized your relationship with Uncle Yan long ago. You look especially like Uncle Yan when he was young.\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t that their facial features were very similar. It was just that their expressions and the feeling they gave off were very similar.\n \u201cBack then, Uncle Yan was the most handsome guy in university. He was cheerful, charming, funny, and had a lot of fans.\u201d\n Even the arrogant Han Chenyi had stepped into a bottomless dark road for Yan Rufeng.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t know what kind of person the young Yan Rufeng was.\n The Yan Rufeng he heard from Han Qingshen was too different from the father in Yan Jiang\u2019s memory.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cFrom the time I remember, he was a taciturn man. He seldom smiled or praised me. I don\u2019t even remember if he hugged me.\u201d\n From a young age, Yan Jiang and his father had never been close.\n His father would always look at him with a complex expression. There were several times when he fought with someone in school and bled. He would then return home to complain to his parents.\n Nan Yiyi\u2019s heart ached terribly. She pulled him into her arms, kissed and hugged him lovingly for a long time. In the process, Yan Rufeng just sat on the sofa and watched coldly as the mother-son duo were doting on each other.\n But on that Saturday, Yan Rufeng brought Yan Jiang to the taekwondo club and enrolled him in class to practice Taekwondo.\n Yan Rufeng loved Yan Jiang, but that love was mixed with too much hatred and helplessness.\n Yan Jiang put himself in his shoes.\n If a woman conspired with Nan Yiyi to drug him, who was already married to Song Fei and had a child, causing that woman to secretly give birth to their child, Yan Jiang would similarly not like that child.\n He even had the heart to crush that child, let alone love him!\n Instead, Yan Jiang should thank Yan Rufeng for not killing him back then.\n However, it was one thing to understand in one\u2019s heart. Yan Jiang was still very upset.\n \u201cHe must hate me. After all, my appearance messed up his life and broke his relationship with Han Chenyi.\u201d\n Yan Jiang finished the half glass of water in one gulp. He shook his head and smiled bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s not wrong for him to hate me. After all, I am his stain.\u201d\n His existence was a stain.\n Although he didn\u2019t want to admit it, Yan Jiang could see the truth.\n Hearing the noun \u201cstain\u201d, Han Qingshen instinctively retorted. \u201cYou are not a stain. In this feud, you are the innocent one. The real guilty ones are Nan Yiyi and your grandmother.\u201d\n What has the enmity between parents got to do with the children?\n \u201cYan Jiang, never think of you as a stain.\u201d Staring at Yan Jiang\u2019s handsome face, Han Qingshen smiled deeply. \u201cYou are so good-looking. You are an angel.\u201d\n Han Qingshen was especially beautiful when she smiled.\n Yan Jiang recalled that someone had said that Han Qingshen looked very much like Han Chenyi. Thinking about it, Han Chenyi must also be a dashing and charismatic man.\n \u201c13 years ago, my father was diagnosed with brain cancer and was in the late stages.\u201d\n Han Qingshen clutched the cup tightly. She said, \u201c27 years ago, Nan Yiyi appeared in my father\u2019s office with a big belly and told him that the child was Uncle Yan\u2019s. After my father found out about this, he nearly went crazy.\u201d\n \u201cThe two of them broke up completely and had a big fight at home. I was still young then and couldn\u2019t remember clearly. But I heard from the butler that during that fight, my father stabbed Uncle Yan with a fruit knife and he nearly lost his life.\u201d\n \u201cAfter Uncle Yan survived, Father let him go. He is unwilling to face Uncle Yan again and is also afraid that he will do something to harm Uncle Yan in his madness.\u201d\n \u201cAfter Uncle Yan left, Father always had a headache, but he never took it to heart. Many years later, when his headache got worse and worse, he went to the hospital for a check-up and discovered that he was already suffering from late-stage brain cancer.\u201d\n \u201cWhen his days were numbered, Father finally realized what he had lost. For the first time, Father lowered his head to someone. He went to look for Uncle Yan and told him about his health.\u201d\n \u201cFather\u2019s cancer is the main reason why Uncle Yan decided to abandon your family and leave the Yan Family.\u201d\n After quietly listening to Han Qing\u2019s narration, Yan Jiang\u2019s heart was suddenly enlightened.\n So this was the truth behind Yan Rufeng abandoning his wife and child back then!\n Yan Jiang asked coldly, \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d\n \u201cAfter that...\u201d\n Recalling those unhappy memories, Han Qingshen felt slightly sad.\n As she recalled, she said frankly, \u201cIn the late stages of brain cancer, my father\u2019s vision became weaker and weaker. In the end, even my face couldn\u2019t be seen clearly. Not only that, he also vomited repeatedly and had a headache. When his head hurt badly, he would knock his head against the wall.\u201d\n \u201cThere was once when my father knocked his head so hard that it bled profusely and scared Uncle Yan and me. After that, whenever my father wanted to hit the wall, Uncle Yan would stand by the wall and use his body to block that wall...\u201d\n \u201cDuring that period, Uncle Yan\u2019s tummy was always bruised.\u201d In terms of affection, few could compare to Yan Rufeng.\n Yan Rufeng indeed felt guilty towards Yan Jiang.\n But Yan Rufeng had a clear conscience towards Han Chenyi!\n \u201cFather passed away less than eight months after Uncle Yan returned. When he left, he was skinny and his loose skin was plastered to every bone. He looked very ugly. At that time, my father had a very difficult time every day. He didn\u2019t want Uncle Yan to see his ugly face.\u201d\n \u201cHe smashed things everyday and scolded Uncle Yan to get lost. Every time, Uncle Yan would obediently get lost, and when Father\u2019s anger subsided, he would return to him as if nothing had happened.\u201d\n Tears welled up in Han Qingshen\u2019s eyes at the mention of those things.\n Illness was very cruel. It tortured the once high-spirited and vigorous man into a monster that was neither human nor ghost.\n \u201cI personally witnessed my father being tormented by his illness until he passed away. This strengthened the hatred in Uncle Yan\u2019s heart. He hated your mother and even more so your ignorant grandmother. So after your grandmother passed away, Uncle Yan didn\u2019t even go back to visit her.\u201d\n \u201cAfter Father died, Uncle Yan was mentally unstable. He looked like a normal person at work, but after work, he kept talking nonsense to the empty house.\u201d\n \u201cDuring that period, Uncle Yan had a very difficult time. It took him three years to recover from that pain. Because of those few irregular years of life, Uncle Yan finally contracted gastric cancer.\u201d\n With that, Han Qingshen took out a lady\u2019s cigarette from the exquisite bag she carried on her back. In the past, she had quit smoking for a few years due to her pregnancy, but due to work stress, she picked up the bad habit of smoking.\n Yan Jiang took out a lighter and lit the cigarette for Han Qingshen.\n Han Qingshen took a drag of his cigarette and glanced sideways at Yan Jiang.\n Yan Jiang hung his head slightly with a cold expression. It was difficult to guess his true thoughts from his expression.\n Han Qingshen told him, \u201cI\u2019m not saying this to gain your sympathy for Uncle Yan. I\u2019m just telling you about the Uncle Yan I know.\u201d\n \u201cWhether you want to forgive him, or whether you want to accept his compensation, the decision is yours.\u201d Han Qingshen threw two chewing gum into her mouth and got up to leave.\n Yan Jiang sat in the cafe for a while more before going downstairs to look for Song Fei and her sister.\n The two sisters stood at the entrance of the hospital eating roasted sweet potatoes. The two sisters ate one together. When Yan Jiang arrived, Song Fei was licking her fingers.\n Song Fei really loved roasted sweet potatoes in the winter, especially those top-grade sweet potatoes that were soft, soft, and fragrant.\n Realizing that Yan Jiang had arrived, Song Fei hurriedly lowered her hand. That serious look on her face made it seem like the woman licking her fingers with her tongue was not her.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n After boarding the car, Song Fei drew two wet tissues and complained as she wiped her hands. \u201cThis roasted sweet potato tastes average. It\u2019s not as good as when I was young.\u201d\n Song Ci rolled her eyes and retorted. \u201cSince it\u2019s not tasty, why did you snatch mine just now? I even saw you licking your fingers!\u201d\n Song Fei shot daggers at Song Ci. \u201cDon\u2019t speak if you don\u2019t know how to speak.\u201d\n Song Ci snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me. I\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d\n The two sisters quarreled in the back row. Most of the time, it was Song Ci who nagged non-stop. Song Fei occasionally sneered and snorted arrogantly.\n As Yan Jiang listened to the sisters\u2019 scolding, his heart, which had been numb from being hurt by Nan Yiyi and her son, gradually regained its strong heartbeat.\n As Yan Jiang had been in Feng City for some time, the refrigerator was empty. He urgently needed to go to the supermarket to replenish his stocks.\n Song Ci followed them to the supermarket.\n Song Ci was standing in front of a rack, picking dried fruits. Song Fei walked over and poked Song Ci\u2019s arm.\n Song Ci turned to look at her in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cThe little guys are about to be born. As their aunt, I intend to buy some gifts for them. Look, what else do you need?\u201d\n Song Ci was about to speak when Song Fei added. \u201cI don\u2019t have much money. Don\u2019t look for me if it\u2019s too expensive. Get Yan Jiang to buy it.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know you are poor. I don\u2019t intend to let you buy anything too expensive.\u201d\n \u201cHow about this? Buy a few sets of toys for them. I\u2019ve already bought clothes for them. Buying more will do. The toys can still be stored there. We can play with them when they are older.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Fei and Song Ci went to the mother and baby shop downstairs. After a round of selection, they chose a story machine, a set of Barbie dolls, and a set of Lego toys.\n After settling the bill, Song Ci\u2019s cell phone rang.\n Seeing that it was a call from Han Zhan, Song Ci walked to a quieter place to pick up the call.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d Thinking that Han Zhan was going home for dinner, Song Ci told him, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be coming back tonight. Yan Jiang and Song Fei are back today and I am shopping with them now.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cBaby Ci, Su Beibei is bleeding profusely and is going to give birth.\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked. \u201cWhy is she bleeding so much?!\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure about the exact situation. Li Li has already rushed to the hospital and I intend to go over too. Do you want to take a look?\u201d\n \u201cOf course!\u201d\n After hanging up, Song Ci bid Song Fei farewell and went downstairs to the garage to get Long Yu to drive her to the hospital.\n Song Ci\u2019s location was rather close to the hospital and she was the first to arrive.\n Upon seeing Song Ci, Mother Li knelt down in front of her. \u201cSong Ci, Song Ci, what should we do? Beibei is bleeding profusely!\u201d\n \u201cWill something happen to our Beibei?!\u201d\n Song Ci was shocked by Mother Li\u2019s manner.\n She was pregnant and it was easy for her to let her imagination run wild. When she saw Su Beibei\u2019s blood on Mother Li\u2019s sleeves, her heart skipped a beat and she forgot how to speak.\n Mother Li released Song Ci, clasped her hands together, and kowtowed outside the window. She begged as she kowtowed. \u201cHeavens, you must hug our Beibei. Nothing must happen to her!\u201d\n \u201cYou must ensure their safety!\u201d\n Song Ci gradually regained consciousness.\n She hurriedly shot Long Yu a look. \u201cBrother Long, help Auntie up.\u201d\n Long Yu pulled Mother Li up halfway and pressed her down on a chair. Song Ci sat down beside Mother Li and grabbed her bloodstained hand. Song Ci asked her, \u201cAuntie, what exactly happened?\u201d\n Tears streamed down Mother Li\u2019s face as she narrated intermittently. \u201cI went out to buy groceries in the afternoon and planned to make a sweet and sour fish for Beibei tonight. By the time I returned, Beibei had already bled profusely and her amniotic fluid leaked.\u201d\n \u201cShe crawled into the living room from the kitchen, wanting to get her cell phone to make a call. I pushed open the door and saw blood all over the floor. Oh my God, my legs went limp from fright!\u201d\n \u201cI only went out for a short while. How did something happen to her? How am I going to answer to Li Li?\u201d\n Mother Li was crying so hard that she was out of breath. She was truly terrified.\n Song Ci frowned. \u201cWhat is she doing in the kitchen?\u201d\n Mother Li was stunned for a moment. She said uncertainly, \u201cPerhaps she\u2019s hungry?\u201d\n Song Ci gave Mother Li a meaningful look. She felt that something was off.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "228": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-229\n\n Chapter 228: A C-section Without Anesthesia, Poor Relationship between Mother and Daughter-in-Law  As a woman, Song Ci felt that Mother Li\u2019s words were full of holes after reading all sorts of posts about how bad the relationship between mother and daughter-in-law was.\n What is a woman about to give birth doing in the kitchen?\n Moreover, based on the time when Su Beibei\u2019s accident happened, it should have been around 6pm.\n For families with leisurely jobs, they would have dinner at 6pm. Moreover, Mother Li was not at work yet and dinner should be ready between 5.30pm and 6pm.\n Buying fish to make sweet and sour fish then?\n This was obviously a loophole.\n The Mother Li that Song Ci knew was a woman who had worked hard her entire life for her child. She was the good mother-in-law who had given all her savings to her daughter-in-law at the wedding. She couldn\u2019t bear to guess at Mother Li with the greatest malice.\n Song Ci waited for a while and saw a nurse rushing over with two bags of blood.\n The operating theater door was opened. The young nurse ran in and the door closed.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart was beating faster and faster. She didn\u2019t know if she was scared, but she felt a slight pain in her stomach. Beside her, Mother Li also panicked when she saw the nurse running into the operating theater with the blood bag and started crying again.\n Hearing Mother Li\u2019s cries, Song Ci\u2019s chest tightened.\n She lowered her head and prayed that Su Beibei and her son would be safe.\n After waiting for another 20 minutes, Li Li and Han Zhan rushed over. Li Li left his work behind after receiving the news and rushed over. He was in a hurry and didn\u2019t wear a jacket, only a shirt.\n There was a heater in the Imperial Dragon Building. It was naturally not cold in this outfit, but the temperature outside was only four to five degrees.\n Li Li\u2019s face was especially pale. He arrived at the door of the operating theater and saw that Mother Li\u2019s sleeves were stained with Su Beibei\u2019s blood. His mind buzzed.\n Li Li asked Mother Li in a trembling voice, \u201cWhat exactly happened, Mother?\u201d\n Mother Li\u2019s lips quivered as she spoke incoherently about what she told Song Ci previously to Li Li.\n Li Li\u2019s mind was in a mess. After hearing Mother Li\u2019s explanation, he actually didn\u2019t sense anything wrong.\n Song Ci looked over at Han Zhan and saw that he was squinting his gray-blue eyes at Mother Li with obvious suspicion. Song Ci was relieved.\n It seems like I\u2019m not the only one who felt that there is something wrong with Mother Li.\n Han Zhan sat down beside Song Ci.\n Pinching Song Ci\u2019s hand, Han Zhan noticed that it was very cold. He asked her, \u201cAre you scared?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cI feel slightly unwell.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cFollow me to the car to rest first. Don\u2019t wait here anymore. Don\u2019t get scared.\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head and told Han Zhan, \u201cIt\u2019s not that exaggerated. It doesn\u2019t hurt, just uncomfortable. I should just wait here. I won\u2019t feel at ease until Beibei and her son are safe.\u201d\n Song Ci and Su Beibei were on pretty good terms. Song Ci\u2019s heart was naturally clenched after what happened to Su Beibei.\n She leaned against Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder and said in a low voice, \u201cBeibei and her son must be safe and sound.\u201d\n Han Zhan hugged Song Ci\u2019s shoulder and remained silent.\n Li Li was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan. He really couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and asked Han Zhan, \u201cMr. Han, can you think of a way for me to go in and take a look?\u201d\n Han Zhan gave him a meaningful look and was about to nod when he heard Mother Li say, \u201cNo way! Son, how can a man look at a woman giving birth?\u201d\n \u201cHow unlucky!\u201d\n Mother Li was superstitious and treated giving birth as a dirty thing.\n Li Li looked at his mother in disbelief.\n From what he knew, his mother was kind and reasonable. How could she say that women were very \u201cdirty\u201d when giving birth?\n Under Li Li\u2019s shocked gaze, Mother Li\u2019s expression flickered as if she was uneasy.\n Han Zhan went to make a call. Not long after, the director personally came over.\n With the hospital director\u2019s permission, Li Li put on a sterile surgical gown and entered the operating theater.\n This was Li Li\u2019s first time entering the hospital\u2019s operating theater. The operating theater was very big and had several operating tables on both sides of the corridor. Under the guidance of his assistant doctor, he walked to the innermost operating theater.\n Su Beibei was lying on the operating table. She was still wearing the pink-blue bear pajamas that Li Li had personally chosen for her.\n Due to the excessive bleeding, Su Beibei\u2019s face was pale. Moreover, she had suddenly suffered a major hemorrhage and was sent to the hospital in a hurry to stop the bleeding. In this surgery, anesthesia wasn\u2019t even administered on Su Beibei!\n When Li Li arrived, he saw the doctor use a knife to gently cut open Su Beibei\u2019s stomach!\n Li Li watched this scene in a daze, his legs trembling.\n As Su Beibei had lost too much blood, she didn\u2019t have much strength left. Tears streamed down her face from the pain, but she couldn\u2019t make a single sound.\n Li Li hurried over and grabbed Su Beibei\u2019s cold hand.\n Su Beibei thought it was the doctor\u2019s hand. She grabbed it tightly, gritted her teeth with her eyes closed, and cried in pain.\n She was crying and so was Li Li.\n Li Li suddenly remembered what happened when they first met.\n At that time, Su Beibei was dressed in black and had a cool and arrogant expression. She was the most beautiful, unrestrained female author in the world. She was rich and talented and opened a cafe. Her life was comfortable and carefree.\n But now, she was lying on the operating table, enduring all sorts of torture for their child.\n Li Li\u2019s tears landed on Su Beibei\u2019s face.\n Su Beibei opened her heavy eyelids and saw Li Li above her. She thought she was dying and was hallucinating.\n Li Li hurriedly bent down and kissed Su Beibei\u2019s sweaty forehead. \u201cBeibei, does it hurt?\u201d\n Hearing Li Li\u2019s voice, Su Beibei pouted and started crying silently and pitifully.\n At this moment, the doctor retrieved the child.\n As the amniotic fluid was about to run dry, the child was slightly hypoxic. His face was blue, but he was still alive.\n Hearing the child\u2019s cries, Su Beibei glanced at the baby.\n Su Beibei was suddenly filled with the desire to live.\n I can\u2019t die!\n I can\u2019t let my child become a motherless child!\n Su Beibei grabbed Li Li\u2019s hand tightly and begged him in a hoarse voice. \u201cSave me...\u201d\n Li Li nodded tearfully and promised her. \u201cThe doctor will definitely save you, Beibei. You will definitely be fine!\u201d\n After taking the child out, the doctor helped Su Beibei stop the bleeding. Su Beibei was about to lose consciousness, but the blood in her body was still leaking.\n The doctors were sweating profusely.\n Another 7-8 minutes passed...\n Finally, the doctor looked up and heaved a long sigh.\n A nurse at the side hurriedly used a towel to wipe the sweat off the doctor\u2019s forehead. The doctor said to the nurse, \u201cHelp me take off my glasses and wipe my eyes. My eyelashes are covered in water.\u201d\n The nurse obeyed.\n After wiping the sweat off the doctor\u2019s lashes, the nurse put on his glasses again.\n Only then did the doctor nod heavily at Li Li and tell him, \u201cThe bleeding has temporarily stopped. We just need to see if there will be any more major bleeding.\u201d\n Li Li wiped his tears and knelt down in front of the medical staff.\n He knelt on the ground and saw the blood in the dustbin and on the ground. His mind went blank.\n Li Li kowtowed several times to the doctors and nurses. He leaned his forehead against the ground and thanked them. \u201cThank you all. You saved my life!\u201d\n Su Beibei was Li Li\u2019s life. He didn\u2019t dare to imagine how dark life would be without Su Beibei.\n he doctor said, \u201cGet up quickly and go visit your child.\u201d\n The doctor was very tired. He drank half a bottle of water and stayed in the operating theater for a while before leaving.\n \u2013\n The baby\u2019s lungs were slightly infected with amniotic fluid and was sent into the incubator two hours after birth.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan went to buy milk powder for the child and returned to the Li Family.\n Su Beibei had been hospitalized due to a sudden hemorrhage. Everything had happened so suddenly that the child didn\u2019t even have a set of clothes. Previously, after the child was born, he was still wearing Li Li\u2019s shirt.\n Song Ci was pregnant and it was not convenient for her to pack up. Han Zhan didn\u2019t care about the gender difference. He entered the master bedroom and got a set of clothes for Li Li. He opened the wardrobe, took out the baby\u2019s clothes, and placed them in the bag.\n Su Beibei thought that the child was a daughter and bought light blue and pink clothes. Only after the child was born did she know that it was a boy.\n Han Zhan also found a small basin for wetting babies, a towel for washing buttocks, and everything that Su Beibei needed to stay in the hospital.\n There were three big bags scattered around.\n Han Zhan carried the items into the living room and saw Song Ci standing at the kitchen door, staring at the pool of blood on the floor in a daze.\n Han Zhan went to get a mop again. As he mopped the blood on the ground, he asked Song Ci, \u201cWere you scared badly?\u201d\n Song Ci shook her head. \u201cNo, Brother Han, don\u2019t mop the floor first. Look at the kitchen stove.\u201d\n Han Zhan stopped. Holding the mop, he turned and looked at the stove.\n There was half a pot of wonton in the pot on the stove, and the blood started from the stove.\n Han Zhan pursed his lips.\n Song Ci said, \u201cBeibei suddenly bled profusely while cooking wontons.\u201d The last time Su Beibei fell, she bled profusely. The doctor had instructed her to lie in bed and rest more when she got home.\n Why would a pregnant woman who would bleed profusely and be taken care of by someone go and cook wontons during mealtime?\n Song Ci looked at Han Zhan and said, \u201cThere are some things at home that men working outside can\u2019t detect. Brother Han, you have to tell Li Li about this.\u201d\n \u201cBeibei nearly died. We can\u2019t just let this pass.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s heart ached for Su Beibei.\n Giving birth was just the beginning. Bringing up a child after this was the most intense conflict between mother and daughter-in-law.\n If things went wrong, Su Beibei would suffer from depression. Who can they reason with at that point?\n Han Zhan also realized the severity of the matter. He said, \u201cI will tell him.\u201d He quickly wiped the blood clean and carried the items into the car twice. Only then did he drive and send the items to the hospital with Song Ci.\n After reaching the hospital, Song Ci and Mother Li guarded the unconscious Su Beibei in the ward.\n Children didn\u2019t even wear clothes in the incubator. The hospital provided them with diapers, but they could prepare milk bottles themselves. Han Zhan took the milk bottles and milk bottles and called Li Li upstairs to the sterile ward.\n Walking out of the ward, Li Li rubbed his face heavily. His eyes were red as he said, \u201cI have let her down my entire life!\u201d\n With this child, Su Beibei nearly lost her life twice. As a man, Li Li couldn\u2019t bear the pain at all.\n Li Li felt very upset.\n Like a young child, he cried as he leaned his head on Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder. He choked. \u201cWhen we got married, I promised to make her happy for the rest of her life.\u201d\n Han Zhan could understand Li Li\u2019s current feelings.\n He glanced at Mother Li in the ward and said to Li Li, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\n Li Li turned around and wiped his tears. He turned back and asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s chat as we walk.\u201d\n After sending the milk bottle and milk powder to the infant sterile ward, Han Zhan brought Li Li to the undisturbed smoking area downstairs.\n Han Zhan leaned against the window and nodded at Li Li. \u201cWhen Song Ci and I went to your house to get something, we realized that there was still half a pot of wonton in the pot on the stove.\u201d\n Hearing this, Li Li didn\u2019t understand what Han Zhan meant.\n At this point, Li Li\u2019s consciousness was not very clear. He had yet to recover from the fear of Su Beibei nearly dying.\n Han Zhan patted Li Li\u2019s shoulder and said frankly, \u201cBeibei bled profusely around 6pm in the afternoon. We saw that the blood started flowing from the kitchen counter. The blood spread from the kitchen all the way to the living room. There were traces of dragging on the floor. She indeed crawled from the kitchen to the living room to make the call.\u201d\n As they spoke, that image flashed across Han Zhan and Li Li\u2019s minds. They both felt cruel and fearful.\n \u201cLi Li, why is your mother still buying fish at dinner time?\u201d\n \u201cWhy would a pregnant woman who was supposed to be resting in bed be so hungry that she went to the kitchen to cook?\u201d\n \u201cLi Li, as a man, not only must you do well in your career, you must also take good care of your family. You are a smart person. You will notice some things if you look closely.\u201d\n While criticizing Li Li, Han Zhan also asked himself in his heart: Does Song Ci usually get along well with Grandpa at home? Grandpa that old man is also stubborn. Song Ci has never suffered, right?\n No, I have to go back and ask.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

My mother isn\u2019t that kind of person. We\u2019ve depended on each other for so many years. I know her better than you. She wouldn\u2019t do such a thing!\u201d\n Li Li and his mother had a very deep relationship. Based on Han Zhan\u2019s conjecture, it was very difficult for Li Li to believe this fact.\n After all, he was brought up by his mother and she had suffered a lot for him.\n Han Zhan raised his brows and suddenly said, \u201cI finally understand why there are such creatures as mommy\u2019s boy in this world...\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s face darkened as he warned Han Zhan. \u201cMr. Han, be careful with your words.\u201d\n Li Li respected Han Zhan, but it didn\u2019t mean that Han Zhan could slander his mother at will.\n Seeing that Li Li looked slightly angry, Han Zhan looked at him with a dark gaze and said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that your mother treats you well. After all, you are her son and her support. She can spend 99 yuan for you even if there\u2019s only 100 yuan left in the house. I admit that Auntie is a good mother, but Li Li, you have to understand that a good mother might not necessarily be a good mother-in-law.\u201d\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe my conjecture, you can think about it carefully. Has Beibei expressed her unhappiness towards Auntie recently?\u201d\n Many men were born with a thick mind when it came to family matters and couldn\u2019t understand a woman\u2019s sensitive emotions. Not to mention Li Li, even Han Zhan himself would sometimes overlook Song Ci\u2019s feelings.\n Li Li calmed down and thought about it.\n Thinking of this, Li Li really thought of something that he had neglected.\n He said, \u201cHalf a month ago, Beibei mentioned to me that my mother is old and it\u2019s tough taking care of her. She wants to move back to her own house with me and ask the nanny to take care of her.\u201d\n \u201cBut I didn\u2019t take it to heart at that time. I even told her that the nanny was not as meticulous as my biological mother. Grandma might not be considerate when taking care of the child, but she definitely didn\u2019t have any bad intentions. Beibei didn\u2019t mention this again after that...\u201d\n Speaking of this, Li Li also felt somewhat strange.\n Why did Beibei, who had been getting along well with her mother for the past few months, suddenly request to move?\n Could it be that the two of them really had a conflict at home?\n \u201cI have to investigate this carefully.\u201d\n He was Mother Li\u2019s son and Su Beibei\u2019s husband. Being sandwiched between the two women, Li Li could not act properly. He couldn\u2019t easily slander his own mother, but he couldn\u2019t ignore his wife either.\n Seeing that Li Li had taken in his words and he had achieved his goal, Han Zhan went downstairs.\n By the time Han Zhan and Song Ci returned home, it was already late.\n After calling Zhong Buhui to inform him that he wasn\u2019t going back tonight, Han Zhan drove Song Ci to their own home.\n There were always part-time cleaners at home, so it was not dirty.\n After a busy night, Song Ci didn\u2019t even take a shower. She just wanted to sleep.\n Han Zhan came out of the shower and laid on the bed hugging Song Ci. He stroked her big tummy.\n Her big tummy was very quiet. It looked like the two little guys were also sleeping.\n Han Zhan suddenly bit Song Ci\u2019s ear and asked, \u201cBaby Ci, my grandfather doesn\u2019t treat you badly usually, right?\u201d Han Zhan was traumatized by the Li Family\u2019s dirty deeds.\n Song Ci was about to fall asleep but was jolted awake by his words.\n \u201cGrandpa dotes on me so much, how could he bear to treat me badly?\u201d\n \u201cJust a little.\u201d Song Ci pinched the fat on her arm and said worriedly, \u201cHe always tells me to eat more. I\u2019ve already gained weight.\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head and chuckled. \u201cYou can lose weight after giving birth.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s the only way.\u201d\n The next morning, Han Zhan went to work and Song Ci accompanied Long Yu to the hospital to visit Su Beibei.\n When she arrived, Su Beibei was still unconscious.\n Mother Li was lying on the bed beside the nurse. Li Li was dozing off beside Su Beibei\u2019s bed. Song Ci pushed open the door and woke Li Li up.\n Li Li looked up and saw that it was Song Ci. He got up and walked over.\n \u201cSister-in-law, shall we go out for a chat?\u201d Li Li obviously didn\u2019t rest well last night and looked very tired.\n Song Ci nodded.\n The two of them arrived at the lounge area in the middle of the hospital floor. Song Ci supported her pregnant belly and sat down on the metal chair.\n Li Li rubbed his eyes and said, \u201cBeibei woke up last night and spoke to me for a while. After knowing that the child was fine, she fell asleep again.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci was relieved.\n \u201cMadam, there\u2019s something I want to ask you.\u201d Li Li looked very conflicted. He clearly hesitated for a long time before speaking.\n Song Ci guessed what Li Li was going to ask. She remained silent and waited for Li Li to ask.\n \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n Li Li asked vaguely, \u201cBeibei is very close to you. When you guys chatted on WeChat, did she mention...\u201d Li Li lowered his head and was silent for a few seconds before saying,\u201d How did she mention my mother to you? \u201d\n Song Ci knew that Li Li would ask about this.\n Song Ci told Li Li, \u201cBeibei doesn\u2019t like to share private matters with me. We usually chat about novels, movies, or criticizing our friends. But a few days ago, she told me something. At that time, I thought she was just sharing some gossip with me. Now that I think about it, she might be talking about herself.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s expression turned serious. He hurriedly asked Song Ci, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cBeibei told me that she has a university classmate who is also pregnant recently. Her husband\u2019s family situation is somewhat similar to hers. Her husband is from a single-parent family and her mother-in-law has suffered a lot to groom her husband.\u201d\n \u201cBeibei said that that friend has been complaining to her recently that her mother-in-law is a two-faced woman. She treats her daughter-in-law well in front of her friend\u2019s husband and asks about her well-being meticulously. And when her son isn\u2019t at home, she has another face.\u201d\n Song Ci glanced at Li Li.\n Li Li could also tell that the so-called friend Su Beibei was referring to was herself!\n Beibei said that my mother was a two-faced woman. She had a benevolent and kind face in front of me, but she had another face behind my back?\n Is this true?\n \u201cIs... is there more?\u201d Li Li\u2019s mood was slightly off.\n Song Ci added. \u201cI asked Beibei how that mother-in-law treated her daughter-in-law.\u201d\n \u201cBeibei said that in the beginning, Mother-in-Law treated her friend very well. But gradually, when Mother-in-Law realized that her son cared more about his daughter-in-law than her, she felt slightly jealous. When she knew that her son was coming back for dinner, that meal was definitely going to be a splendid one.\u201d\n \u201cIf the son doesn\u2019t come back, she will just cook two dishes. He also said that her mother-in-law purposely made the dishes that her friend wanted to eat very ordinarily. Her friend could tell that her mother-in-law disliked her and gradually stopped making requests.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s heart was about to explode.\n He smiled bitterly and said in a self-deprecating manner, \u201cPerhaps this really only happened to her friend?\u201d Li Li still couldn\u2019t believe that it was true.\n Song Ci smiled mockingly. \u201cBeibei said that her friend\u2019s mother-in-law loves to play mahjong. She often goes out to play after lunch. Sometimes, she forgets the time when she plays mahjong and just lets her wife cook something for herself.\u201d\n \u201cShe also said that her friend\u2019s mother-in-law likes to make dumplings and wantons. She would make a few days worth at once, so her friend often cooks a bowl of dumplings when she is hungry.\u201d\n \u201cLi Li, why don\u2019t you ask your mother\u2019s mahjong buddies if your mother was at the market or the mahjong house at 6pm last night?\u201d\n Song Ci was angry at Li Li\u2019s incompetence and his neglect of Su Beibei. Her tone was slightly harsh.\n It was better to find an older man who knew how to take care of the family.\n Li Li was not very reliable.\n Poor Beibei.\n Song Ci slowly stood up and returned to the ward with a big belly.\n When she returned to the ward, Su Beibei was still sleeping, but Mother Li was already awake.\n Mother Li was washing her face when she saw Song Ci. She poured some water from the basin and asked, \u201cSong Ci, why are you here so early? It\u2019s not easy for you to run around with such a big belly.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Some pregnant women can cook on their own even when they are about to give birth. This is nothing to me.\u201d Song Ci\u2019s tone was very calm. Hearing this, Mother Li didn\u2019t think much of it.\n \u201cAuntie, you must be tired after spending the night here. Why don\u2019t you and Li Li go back and rest first? It\u2019s good to take a shower and change clothes. Long Yu and I will stay here with Su Beibei and come over when Li Li is done cleaning up.\u201d\n As Song Ci spoke, Li Li happened to return to the ward.\n Seeing that her son had come over, Mother Li asked Li Li, \u201cAh Li, are you busy at the office? If you are, I will come over alone later. You go to work.\u201d\n Li Li said, \u201cWhy would I work at this time? I will accompany her.\u201d\n Mother Li said, \u201cBut your job...\u201d\n Li Li interrupted Mother Li and said, \u201cMother, I work so that my wife, children, and mother can lead a good life. If I leave my wife, who has just gone through a life-and-death situation, in the hospital because of work, do you think I am still human?\u201d\n Mother Li was stumped.\n Hearing this, Song Ci felt slightly better.\n \u201cSister-in-law, I\u2019ll have to trouble you and Brother Long. We\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After Li Li and his mother left, Song Ci couldn\u2019t help holding Su Beibei\u2019s hand. She looked at Su Beibei\u2019s pale face and thought of her child who was still living in the incubator. She felt especially terrible.\n A woman\u2019s life is really not easy.\n \u2013\n Li Li parked the car at the entrance of a supermarket. He said, \u201cMy razor broke. I will go to the supermarket to buy a razor. Mother, wait for me in the car.\u201d\n Mother Li also opened the car door. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the market to buy a fish for Beibei. She\u2019s very weak and needs to nourish herself well.\u201d\n Hearing his mother\u2019s words, Li Li felt slightly doubtful.\n Is my mother really the kind of person Song Ci spoke of?\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n Li Li left the supermarket and bought some candy for Su Beibei. Su Beibei liked to eat this. It was also quite boring to be hospitalized. She might feel better after eating some candy.\n After buying the milk candy, Li Li walked into the small market opposite. From afar, he saw his mother squatting in front of the fish vendor selling fish.\n There were many fish ponds in front of that stall. The same fish had different prices. The fresh ones were expensive and the dying ones were cheap.\n Li Li walked into the fish stall and saw his mother squatting in front of those dying fish, pointing and bargaining with the boss.\n Li Li had good hearing and heard his mother say \u2014\n \u201cBoss, your fish is dying. It\u2019s not fresh anymore. Sell it to me cheaply!\u201d\n The boss said, \u201cIt\u2019s not dead yet. I\u2019ll let you have a 1.50 dollar discount at most!\u201d\n Seeing that her negotiation failed, Mother Li picked out two of the smallest Yellow Bone Fish with a pained expression.\n Li Li\u2019s heart ached at the sight.\n He turned around and hurried out of the market. He squatted under a camphor tree outside the market. Li Li\u2019s eyes reddened as he thought of the vows he had made to Su Beibei during their marriage.\n I had said before that I wanted to make her happy and give her a carefree life.\n But what kind of life did Su Beibei lead after marriage?\n Why didn\u2019t that girl tell me the truth?\n Mother Li carried the fish out of the market. She was slightly shocked to see Li Li. \u201cAh Li?\u201d\n Li Li stood up and wiped his eyes. He turned and stared at the fish in Mother Li\u2019s bag. \u201cWhat fish did you buy?\u201d\n Mother Li said, \u201cTwo Yellow Bone Fish.\u201d\n Li Li looked at the quiet bag and asked, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this fish moving?\u201d\n Mother Li said, \u201cThey\u2019ve akready been slaughtered.\u201d\n His family used to sell fish in the past. Li Li knew very well that fish like Yellow Bone Fish were only fresh if they were slaughtered on the spot. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to kill this fish. Why don\u2019t you go home and kill it?\u201d\n \u201cSigh, I\u2019ll do it when I get home anyway. It doesn\u2019t matter if I kill it now!\u201d\n Mother Li boarded the car with Li Li. After boarding the car, she continued nagging. \u201cRecently, the price of fish has increased and so has the price of broccoli. The prices are getting higher and higher and the money is running out.\u201d\n Li Li told Mother Li, \u201cMother, I can earn money and am very good at it. You don\u2019t have to be so thrifty.\u201d\n \u201cAiyo, that\u2019s your hard-earned money. Can you spend it just because you have money?\u201d\n With that, Mother Li started to complain. \u201cBeibei is still the fiercest when it comes to spending money. Any dress costs 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. My heart aches just looking at it. Isn\u2019t that just a piece of fabric? Won\u2019t it hurt to buy such an expensive one?\u201d\n \u201cThis child doesn\u2019t know how to live.\u201d\n Mother Li had also said this in the past, but she didn\u2019t mention it often. Li Li treated it as if his mother had worked hard her entire life and was thrifty her entire life, so she couldn\u2019t stand Su Beibei\u2019s lifestyle and said this casually.\n But after hearing those words from Song Ci, the smart Li Li felt that his mother was brainwashing him by saying such enticing words. It made him feel like Su Beibei was a spendthrift.\n Li Li took advantage of the red light and turned to say to Mother Li, \u201cMother, Beibei is a novelist. Her annual copyright fees, royalties, and other adaptations are not a small sum. It\u2019s enough for her to buy a few dresses that are over 10,000 yuan and nice bags.\u201d\n \u201cNot to mention that she spent her own money, it\u2019s only right for her to spend your son\u2019s money!\u201d\n Stunned, Mrs. Li said, \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t spend money like this even if she\u2019s rich... She just doesn\u2019t have parents to support her. She doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s not easy to get money.\u201d\n Hearing his mother attack Su Beibei\u2019s orphan background, Li Li suddenly growled. \u201cMother! Don\u2019t say such things again!\u201d\n Mother Li\u2019s expression froze.\n Firstly, it was because his son had suddenly raised his voice. Secondly, it was because his son was overly protective of Su Beibei.\n \u201cWhy are you scolding me? I just said a few words casually. I didn\u2019t say it in front of her!\u201d Mother Li didn\u2019t feel that she was in the wrong at all. She felt that everything she said was reasonable.\n \u201cYou\u2019re talking about spending money. I\u2019ve never seen a lady who can spend as much as Beibei. Look, your Auntie Zhang\u2019s wife\u2019s most expensive clothes are only 800 yuan!\u201d\n Li Li couldn\u2019t help retorting. \u201cAuntie Zhang\u2019s daughter-in-law runs a small restaurant and your daughter-in-law is a writer. How can we compare? You only see that her daughter-in-law is thrifty, but you don\u2019t see that your daughter-in-law is talented. Who doesn\u2019t praise her as a talented girl?\u201d\n Mother Li\u2019s eyes reddened at Li Li\u2019s fierce words.\n She said, \u201cYou just like her and protect her. Ever since you got a wife, you forgot about your mother. You forgot who saved up money to give you books. That year, when our family was so poor that we didn\u2019t have the money to buy rice, I had to make sure you were full even if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cYour life is better now. You are so successful now, but you are already despising a vulgar mother like me.\u201d\n Mother Li started to spout nonsense.\n Hearing this, Li Li felt angry for the first time.\n Li Li was enraged and his voice turned cold. He said to his mother, \u201cMother, do you want to write about how you raised your child painstakingly and publish it in a book? Perhaps some film company will take a fancy to it and buy the rights to film a television drama. By then, the entire country will know that I, Li Li, was raised by you!\u201d\n Being mocked by Li Li, Mother Li widened her eyes and started crying silently.\n Li Li suppressed his anger and didn\u2019t coax her.\n Arriving at the district, Li Li had just parked his car when Mother Li opened the door with reddened eyes and carried the two fish upstairs.\n Li Li suddenly called out to her. \u201cMother.\u201d\n Mother Li thought that Li Li was going to apologize to her. She turned around smugly and looked at Li Li.\n But Li Li stared at the fish bag in her hand and said, \u201cMother, that lady whom you despise so much is my favorite girl. She is my baby. Don\u2019t bring such a dying Yellow Bone Fish to Beibei. She is delicate and expensive. It is harsh on her to eat this.\u201d\n Mother Li\u2019s expression changed slightly.\n \u201cYou...\u201d\n She realized that Li Li had seen her buying fish.\n Not wanting Li Li to hate her, Mother Li instinctively said, \u201cLi Li, when I bought this fish, it was still breathing. It\u2019s not a dead fish! It\u2019s okay!\u201d\n Li Li felt very tired knowing that he couldn\u2019t reason with his mother. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy something.\u201d\n Li Li turned and walked out of the community, his face full of fatigue.\n Li Li arrived at the mahjong house outside the community.\n Seeing Li Li, Auntie Zhang waved at him. As she played her cards, she looked up and asked him, \u201cLi Li, I heard that your wife acted up last night? Did she give birth? Is it a boy or a girl?\u201d\n Su Beibei\u2019s due date was these few days. They didn\u2019t know that Su Beibei had given birth last night due to massive bleeding and thought that she had acted up normally.\n Li Li followed their lead. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy.\u201d\n \u201cAiyo, you are so lucky to have a boy in your first pregnancy.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s attitude towards boys and girls was the same. Hearing what the auntie said, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with them.\n Auntie Zhang added, \u201cYesterday, when we were playing mahjong, your mother said that Beibei\u2019s due date was still three to four days away. Why did she suddenly give birth? Your mother was so agitated when she received your wife\u2019s call to say that she was giving birth. She must be overjoyed to have a male grandson.\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s expression remained unchanged as he smiled at Auntie Zhang. \u201cYes, it acted up a few days in advance. Yesterday, when Beibei flared up, my mother was still playing mahjong with you guys, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes, I didn\u2019t expect your wife to give birth a few days in advance.\u201d Auntie Zhang didn\u2019t realize that Li Li was trying to trick her and didn\u2019t pay attention to his words.\n Li Li chatted a little more with Auntie Zhang before turning to leave.\n On the way back to the community, Li Li\u2019s expression was dark.\n It turned out that when Beibei bled profusely at home last night and nearly lost her life, his mother was not on the way to buy fish but at the mahjong table!\n Ever since Mother Li underwent surgery, Li Li forbade Mother Li from going to work again, so Mother Li found herself a hobby of playing mahjong.\n Before he got married, Mother Li stayed at the mahjong house every day. After Su Beibei got pregnant, they got married and stayed together. Mother Li was rather happy then. Thinking that she was going to be a grandmother, she stopped playing mahjong and stayed at home to accompany Su Beibei.\n Li Li thought that his mother never went to the mahjong house again.\n She was even playing mahjong during mealtime. It was obvious how addicted her mother was to mahjong.\n And Su Beibei had never told him about this!\n Why didn\u2019t she say so?\n Li Li was deep in thought the entire way home. He didn\u2019t see Mother Li in the living room or the dining room.\n Guessing that Mother Li was probably sulking in her room, Li Li walked to the door and was about to knock when he heard her mother crying.\n Li Li stood at the door and waited for a while before knocking.\n Some things couldn\u2019t be avoided just by crying.\n Hearing the knock on the door, Mother Li hurriedly wiped her tears.\n Li Li opened the door and entered the house. He looked at his mother with tears streaming down her face. \u201cAre you crying?\u201d\n Mother Li\u2019s wrinkled face was filled with self-mockery. \u201cMy son bullied me for a woman. Shouldn\u2019t I cry?\u201d\n Li Li felt very tired.\n This kind of fatigue was even more tiring than working overtime for a week.\n He walked to the windowsill of his mother\u2019s room and sat down.\n Looking at his mother\u2019s aged face, Li Li couldn\u2019t bear to look at her face. He looked elsewhere and said, \u201cI met Auntie Zhang just now.\u201d\n Not understanding why Li Li suddenly mentioned Auntie Zhang, Mother Li asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with meeting her?\u201d\n \u201cShe told me that you received a call from Beibei yesterday. After knowing that Beibei was about to give birth, you left your mahjong game in surprise and ran off.\u201d\n Hearing this, Mother Li\u2019s expression froze slightly.\n She felt slightly guilty as her eyes twinkled. \u201cShe must have remembered wrongly. I didn\u2019t even go to play yesterday...\u201d\n \u201cMother.\u201d\n Mother Li glanced at Li Li sheepishly. \u201cMmm?\u201d\n Li Li clenched his fists. \u201cI know a service company with a very good reputation. They have a very good nanny.\u201d\n Mother Li frowned. \u201cWhat? You want to hire a nanny? I can just take care of Beibei. I am in good health and it won\u2019t be a problem to take care of a pregnant woman.\u201d\n \u201cMother!\u201d Li Li interrupted Mother Li\u2019s incessant chatter. \u201cI will find a reliable and capable nanny to take care of you.\u201d\n Mother Li was stunned.\n \u201cLi Li, what do you mean?\u201d Mother Li\u2019s expression changed.\n Li Li said, \u201cPerhaps every child\u2019s love for their parents is inferior to their parents\u2019 love for their children. I know that you have suffered your entire life for me. I should be filial to you.\u201d\n \u201cBut Mother, everything in this world is difficult. If I am filial to you, I will be letting Beibei down and my child down.\u201d\n \u201cI am now a man with a family. I must protect my wife and my child. Mother, I am sorry. I intend to move out with Beibei.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll let you stay in this house alone. When I am on leave, I will also bring Beibei and my grandson back to visit you. Since you like to play mahjong, focus on playing mahjong and enjoy your retirement. Leave the cooking, mopping the floor, and washing clothes to the nanny.\u201d\n Li Li finished what he wanted to say calmly.\n With that, Li Li saw his mother sitting on the bed like she had been struck by lightning, staring at him silently.\n Li Li lowered his head.\n He knew that his decision was very cruel to his mother, but he had no choice. He couldn\u2019t think of a win-win solution and could only do so.\n He couldn\u2019t let Su Beibei suffer just to make his mother happy. Nor could he change wives.\n Mother Li suddenly grabbed her cell phone from the bedside table and threw it at Li Li\u2019s chest.\n Li Li endured the blow and didn\u2019t move.\n Mother Li broke down and cried. She scolded Li Li. \u201cLi Li, you are really a jerk! You were really bewitched by Su Beibei! You actually abandoned me for her!\u201d\n \u201cHave you forgotten what kind of life we had in the past? I raised you painstakingly. You, Li Li, can\u2019t live without me today! Now that you\u2019ve grown up, you really don\u2019t want me anymore?\u201d\n \u201cLi Li, how can you do this to me?!\u201d\n Li Li lowered his head and apologized with reddened eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mother. I am unfilial.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t apologize!\u201d\n Mother Li pointed at her own face and scolded. \u201cLook at my face! Look, we are both in our fifties, but your Auntie Zhang looks like she is in her forties. What about me? I am like that old woman in her sixties or seventies!\u201d\n \u201cLi Li, your father is a coward. He knocked someone down and died. He handed you over to me! I am a woman. It is not easy for me to support myself and my child. Do you know that?!\u201d\n \u201cThat Su Beibei, her parents were knocked into the river by your father and drowned. In order to compensate her, we sold our only house!\u201d\n After that, we were homeless and had nowhere to go. Have you forgotten the hard times of renting houses everywhere?!\u201d\n \u201cAt the end of the day, our hardships have something to do with Su Beibei!\u201d\n After scolding her, Mother Li shut her mouth and sat by the bed, hitting her own chest hard as she panted heavily.\n nly after hearing Mother Li\u2019s scolding did Li Li realize what the problem was.\n \u201cYou hate Beibei and can\u2019t stand her at all times. Is it because you know about her parents?\u201d\n Li Li was still wondering why his mother\u2019s attitude towards Beibei had suddenly changed.\n So Mother knew about Su Beibei\u2019s parents!\n This was the problem!\n \u201cYes, I knew! It was too late when I found out. You two were already married then. If I found out about this before the wedding, you two wouldn\u2019t be able to get married!\u201d\n She didn\u2019t want her son to get a divorce and she couldn\u2019t get along with Su Beibei without any ill feelings. As a result, she could only ignore Su Beibei and target her at all times, making her unhappy.\n Mother Li felt terrible after suffering all those years!\n Li Li looked at his mother\u2019s fierce expression and finally realized that there was a dead knot between his mother and Su Beibei. If it was just a simple in-laws relationship, then living separately might solve this problem.\n But Mother hated Su Beibei...\n Li Li sighed. \u201cMother, since you hate Beibei so much, Beibei will never appear in front of you again. In the future, when I go home, I will only bring my son back.\u201d\n \u201cBut you must know one thing.\u201d\n When his mother looked up at him, Li Li looked into her eyes and told her, \u201cSu Beibei is my wife. You can hate her and not like her, but you are not allowed to hurt her.\u201d\n \u201cSimilarly, I will also request Beibei not to speak ill of you. Just treat the two of you as strangers.\u201d\n Li Li packed a few sets of clothes and left the house.\n Once he left the house, he called the housekeeping company and got them to send someone to clean up Su Beibei\u2019s house.\n \u2014\n Su Beibei was completely awake the next day.\n She opened her eyes and narrowed them at Li Li, who was standing under the blinding sunlight. Having survived a disaster, she felt like crying when she saw Li Li again.\n Su Beibei\u2019s eyes reddened.\n \u201cAh Li...\u201d\n Li Li smiled at her.\n He walked up to the bed and kissed Su Beibei\u2019s pale cheek. \u201cBeibei, welcome back to my side.\u201d\n Su Beibei couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She grabbed Li Li\u2019s collar and hid in his arms, crying.\n No one knew how terrified she was when she bled profusely and was alone at home.\n Still alive and able to see the person she loved, Su Beibei was very satisfied.\n After crying for a while, Su Beibei realized that she didn\u2019t see the child and had a bad guess. \u201cYou previously told me that the child was in the incubator. Don\u2019t tell me... you lied to me?\u201d\n At that time, I had lost so much blood. Could something have happened to the child?\n Su Beibei actually couldn\u2019t remember what happened in the operating theater. She vaguely remembered seeing Li Li in the operating theater, but suspected that it was fake.\n Li Li stroked her hair and comforted her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the child is fine. I still have his photo.\u201d\n Li Li took out his cell phone and flipped to the photo of the little guy. He handed it to Su Beibei. \u201cThis is the photo I took when I went upstairs to visit him this morning.\u201d\n In the photo, Xiao Li Li was skinny and slightly tanned. He opened his mouth slightly and made a sucking motion.\n After confirming that the child was really alive, Su Beibei\u2019s anxious heart finally settled.\n She snatched Li Li\u2019s cell phone and stared at the child for a long while before saying, \u201cWhy is this child so black?\u201d She was clearly very white, but Li Li was not black either.\n ]Li Li said, \u201cSome children are born slightly tanned. They will recover after some time.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Li Li fed Su Beibei, let her drink half a bowl of soup, and bathed her.\n After putting on fresh and clean clothes for Su Beibei, Li Li saw that she was in a good mood and told her, \u201cAfter you are discharged, I will bring you and the child to the confinement center to stay for a month. After the confinement, the three of us will return to your house to stay.\u201d\n Su Beibei had two houses. One was a commodity house and the other was upstairs in the cafe.\n Hearing Li Li\u2019s words, Su Beibei was stunned.\n She had already had enough of her mother-in-law\u2019s cold treatment and targeting. Su Beibei was naturally happy to be separated from her mother-in-law.\n But she was very curious as to why Li Li suddenly thought it through.\n \u201cWhy did you suddenly decide to move out?\u201d\n Something must have happened over the past few days.\n Li Li hugged Su Beibei again and apologized. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Beibei. I neglected you and our family and didn\u2019t realize my mother\u2019s hatred and coldness towards you. You nearly lost your life twice. I don\u2019t dare to gamble a third time.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re moving out. I\u2019ve already found a nanny for my mother.\u201d\n Su Beibei asked him, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n Li Li said, \u201cMr. Han reminded me.\u201d\n Su Beibei sighed. \u201cYou are both men, but Mr. Han is much better than you.\u201d\n ]Li Li didn\u2019t argue with Su Beibei this time.\n He also admitted that in terms of taking care of his lover, Li Li was indeed inferior to Han Zhan.\n \u2013\n Su Beibei felt better and told Song Ci about this while chatting with her.\n Song Ci stuffed a grape into Su Beibei\u2019s mouth. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to be apart. If you live together again, the war between you and your mother-in-law will affect Li Li\u2019s relationship with you sooner or later.\u201d\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Li Li that his mother treated you badly? You didn\u2019t even tell me the truth. I thought you two got along very well.\u201d\n If Song Ci had known about this earlier, she would have warned Li Li earlier. There was no need for Su Beibei to suffer like this.\n Su Beibei ate her grapes in silence.\n After finishing the grapes, Su Beibei said, \u201cI just feel that I\u2019ve let Li Li\u2019s mother down. That year, if not for the sake of compensating me, they wouldn\u2019t have sold their house and wandered around the world.\u201d\n \u201cI can understand why Mother doesn\u2019t like me. Moreover, Zeus Corporation has just been established and Li Li is busy with work. Mother and I didn\u2019t really quarrel, so I didn\u2019t tell him about this.\u201d\n But she didn\u2019t expect her health to be so poor that she would bleed profusely.\n \u201cBut I\u2019m really relieved to be able to live separately now.\u201d Su Beibei glanced at Song Ci, who had been brought up so well by her grandfather that she had gained weight. She was slightly envious of Song Ci.\n \u201cSong Ci, in the past, I still felt that you and Han Zhan were not compatible.\u201d After all, Han Zhan was old and his hands were slightly handicapped. In terms of appearance, Han Zhan was indeed not worthy of Song Ci.\n \u201cBut now, I feel that Han Zhan is really a good home. Song Ci, you and Han Zhan will definitely be happy forever.\u201d\n Firstly, there was no mother-in-law causing trouble.\n Secondly, there\u2019s no need to worry about money.\n Thirdly, she had twins coming soon.\n No matter how one looked at it, they were a blissful couple who would grow old together.\n Song Ci was pleased by Su Beibei\u2019s words. She fed the last two grapes to Su Beibei and asked her, \u201cHave you thought of a name for the child?\u201d\n Su Beibei said, \u201cI thought of a few, but I\u2019m not satisfied.\u201d\n \u201cLet me hear it.\u201d\n \u201cLi Ze, Li Yao, Li Ming, Li Nuo.\u201d\n \u201cForget about Li Ming. Don\u2019t have the same name as your idol.\u201d Song Ci thought for a moment and said, \u201cLi Nuo and Li Ze are both pretty good names. Why are they all two words? It\u2019s not easy to have the same name with three words.\u201d\n \u201cI thought it would be easier to write his name in the future.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cThe child\u2019s surname has a very high starting point.\u201d Li had a lot of strokes.\n It was a headache to name a child. Su Beibei thought about it and decided not to think about it.\n Song Ci looked at the time. She had to go.\n \u201cI want to bring some potatoes back for Grandpa. He\u2019s preparing to plant them and I have to rush back for dinner. I\u2019ll get going first.\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Okay.\u201d\n Song Ci got Long Yu to bring her to buy a bag of potato seeds and rushed home for dinner.\n After dinner, Song Ci returned to her room to practice her violin.\n Han Zhan returned home after work. The moment he entered the living room, he saw his grandfather secretly drinking in the dining room.\n Han Zhan coughed.\n The old man\u2019s hand trembled and the cup nearly fell to the ground.\n Han Aoyu turned around angrily and lectured Han Zhan. \u201cWho are you trying to scare to death?\u201d\n ]Han Zhan strode over and heartlessly snatched the Old Master\u2019s glass. \u201cI told you, you are not allowed to drink.\u201d He had tested the Old Master\u2019s blood pressure a few days ago and it was slightly higher than last month.\n Han Aoyu quibbled. \u201cI only took a sip.\u201d\n \u201cNot even a mouth.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui heard the commotion and walked out of the room. He saw Han Zhan holding a wine glass and a bottle of wine, and then glanced at the old man who was blushing. He instantly felt a headache coming on.\n \u201cOld Master, did you secretly drink again?\u201d\n Han Aoyu felt very aggrieved.\n Song Ci held onto the railing as she went downstairs. She happened to hear Zhong Buhui\u2019s words. She raised her voice to educate Old Master. \u201cGrandpa, cherish your life and stay away from alcohol so that you can live a long life!\u201d\n Han Aoyu hung his head and returned to his room listlessly.\n Han Zhan told Zhong Buhui, \u201cUncle Zhong, put away all the wine at home.\u201d Grandpa was a stubborn person. He might secretly drink again tomorrow.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u2013\n The next day, Song Ci held a drawing book called \u201cYou look delicious\u201d in her hand and narrated it vividly to the children in her womb.\n She was seriously conducting prenatal education.\n In the vegetable garden, Han Aoyu planted potatoes as he told his great-grandchildren about his glorious achievements during the war.\n Song Ci closed the book and complained to Han Aoyu. \u201cGrandpa, they are girls. Aren\u2019t you afraid of scaring them by always telling them things like killing and fighting?\u201d\n Han Aoyu snorted. \u201cPerhaps you have a Hua Mulan in your tummy?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n \u201cSong Lass, get your Uncle Zhong to pour me a cup of tea. I am thirsty.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci got up and walked to the roof of the backyard. She shouted at Zhong Buhui, who was trimming the branches in the backyard. \u201cUncle Zhong, please pour Grandpa a cup of hot tea.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d\n Song Ci turned and saw Han Aoyu put down his hoe and slowly stand up.\n \u201cGrandpa, slow...\u201d\n As she spoke, Song Ci saw Han Aoyu suddenly tilt sideways, take two steps back, and fall to the ground!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "230": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-231\n\n Chapter 230: Song Ci is Depressed and Song Fei Cannot Have A Child  \u201cGrandpa!\u201d Song Ci was shocked and hurried over to him.\n Han Aoyu fell to the ground, grabbed the tree trunk behind him, and struggled to sit up.\n Han Aoyu was shocked to see Song Ci running over. He hurriedly shouted at her, \u201cSong Ci, be careful. Don\u2019t run. I can get up myself.\u201d Nothing must happen to Song Ci. She still had two little cubs in her tummy.\n Song Ci was relieved to see that Han Aoyu could still shout at people.\n She stopped running, supported her big belly, and hurried over.\n When Han Aoyu fell, his head hit the thick trunk of a Luohan Pine tree behind him. He knelt on the ground and rubbed the back of his head. He said to Song Ci, \u201cLook behind my head, is there a bump?\u201d\n Song Ci pulled open the old man\u2019s slightly white hair and took a closer look before shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Grandpa, how are you feeling now? Do you have a headache?\u201d\n Han Aoyu touched the back of his head again before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d\n Song Ci reached out her hand to Han Aoyu. \u201cCome, Grandpa, let me help you up.\u201d\n \u201cNo need. This old man fell and has to get up on his own.\u201d\n This was common sense. Song Ci usually remembered it, but she was so flustered when she saw her grandfather fall that she forgot about it.\n Song Ci retracted her hand and watched as the old man supported that Luohan Pine and slowly stood up.\n Han Aoyu\u2019s legs trembled as he teased himself. \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t sprain my leg and I can still walk!\u201d\n \u201cGrandpa, let\u2019s go over and take a rest.\u201d\n Song Ci supported Han Aoyu\u2019s arm and led him to the chair.\n Zhong Buhui walked over with a cup of tea. \u201cLittle Song, why did you yell just now?\u201d\n Song Ci ignored Han Aoyu\u2019s pleading gaze and told Zhong Buhui, \u201cGrandpa fell just now. I was terrified.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n Zhong Buhui\u2019s expression also changed.\n He hurriedly put down his teacup and walked up to Han Aoyu. He sized him up before asking, \u201cOld Master, are you feeling unwell?\u201d\n Han Aoyu shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I can take it.\u201d\n \u201cYou are not a rock, how can you be resistant to falling!\u201d Zhong Buhui asked Song Ci, \u201cDid Old Master fall anywhere?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI think he hit my head. Uncle Zhong, look at the back of Grandpa\u2019s head. It\u2019s just slightly red when I saw it previously.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui pulled Old Master\u2019s hair and looked at it. \u201cThere\u2019s really a small bulge.\u201d\n ]\u201dNo, we have to go to the hospital!\u201d Song Ci said.\n Zhong Buhui also agreed with Song Ci\u2019s actions.\n \u201cOld Master, go to the hospital for a check-up.\u201d\n Han Aoyu waved his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m already so old, there\u2019s no need to check. If something really happens, it won\u2019t be easy to treat. When one is old, one has to admit it.\u201d\n Han Aoyu quickly became very energetic and ate more than half a bowl of rice that night.\n When Han Zhan returned at night, Song Ci took a shower and told him about this. \u201cGrandpa fell down in the vegetable garden this afternoon and hit his head on a Luo Song. He got up with a small bruise. Uncle Zhong and I asked him to go to the hospital but he didn\u2019t listen.\u201d\n \u201cBrother Han, can you take leave tomorrow morning and bring Grandpa to the hospital for a check-up? This head isn\u2019t any other place. If there really is a bruise, it will be troublesome.\u201d\n Han Zhan was shocked by this news.\n \u201cDid he hit his head?\u201d\n \u201cMmm. Grandpa was planting potatoes then and might have stood up too quickly.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s face darkened and he said helplessly, \u201cHe even secretly drank alcohol. I really don\u2019t know what to say about him.\u201d\n Han Zhan put on his jacket and slippers before heading downstairs.\n He arrived at the first level and knocked on Han Aoyu\u2019s door.\n Han Aoyu was already asleep.\n Han Zhan pushed open the door.\n He approached the bed and listened to Han Aoyu\u2019s regular snores. He didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cGrandpa, stop pretending. I know you\u2019re awake.\u201d\n Old people seldom dozed off at night. How could they fall asleep so easily?\n Han Aoyu felt slightly embarrassed that Han Zhan had seen through his disguise.\n He opened his eyes and glared at Han Zhan. \u201cWhat? Are you here to laugh at me or to teach me a lesson?\u201d\n Han Zhan snorted. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I teach you a lesson? I told you not to drink and not to drink, but you still secretly drank!\u201d Today, Han Zhan went to look at the wine box and realized that the mark on it had been touched.\n Needless to say, Grandpa must have secretly drunk alcohol this morning.\n Han Aoyu chuckled and said, \u201cYou little rascal, have you forgotten how I raised you up by your sh*t and urine in the past? Now that I want to drink some wine, you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re guarding against a thief.\u201d\n Han Aoyu said spitefully, \u201cIndeed, grandsons are not close.\u201d\n He also felt very aggrieved. He didn\u2019t have any other bad habits when he was old, but he liked to drink a little. Han Aoyu didn\u2019t drink too much and never let himself get drunk. He always drank a little.\n But Han Zhan was very strict with him, as if he was looking after a child.\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with Han Aoyu. He said, \u201cAfter breakfast tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll bring you to the hospital for a check-up. You already have a bruise and need to go to the hospital.\u201d\n Han Aoyu couldn\u2019t reject Han Zhan\u2019s decision.\n Han Aoyu also felt guilty about falling today. Thinking that he would delay Han Zhan\u2019s work tomorrow, the old man felt even more guilty.\n Seeing that his grandfather was so cooperative, Han Zhan\u2019s expression finally brightened.\n Staring at Han Aoyu\u2019s legs that were hidden under the blanket, Han Zhan frowned and asked worriedly, \u201cGrandpa, are there any other injuries other than his head?\u201d\n Han Aoyu snorted and said softly, \u201cMy butt seems to have bruised. It hurts just sitting there.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n He went to the shelf and retrieved a bottle of alcohol.\n Han Aoyu reluctantly took off his pants and laid on the bed.\n The old man\u2019s skin was loose and not very nice to look at. It also felt very strange to touch. But Han Zhan didn\u2019t mind. He first poured the medicinal wine on the old man\u2019s skin and rubbed his palms hard to make the medicinal wine work.\n Han Aoyu sighed and said, \u201cSigh, I am really old. Grandpa was so awe-inspiring in the past, but now... Sigh, a real man doesn\u2019t boast about his past achievements.\u201d\n Han Zhan knew that the old man definitely didn\u2019t feel good. He said, \u201cGrandpa is already very healthy compared to the other old men.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true. Those old fellows who fought together and worked together in the past have mostly left.\u201d The remaining few were like fighting in spirit now. They wanted to see who would live longer.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThen you should be satisfied.\u201d\n Han Aoyu shook his head. \u201cI have to admit that I am old!\u201d\n Han Aoyu screwed the cap of the medicine bottle. \u201cDone.\u201d\n Grandpa lifted his own pajama pants, turned over, and faced Han Zhan. Looking at Han Zhan\u2019s handsome and deep face, Han Aoyu suddenly sighed. \u201cWhen I fetched you back, your face was so skinny that it was not even as big as your grandmother\u2019s palm.\u201d\n \u201cHow did you unknowingly become so old? I am also old.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt has been more than 20 years.\u201d\n \u201cI still want to live for another two years.\u201d Han Aoyu gazed at the ceiling and said longingly, \u201cI still want to spend a few more years with the little guys.\u201d\n \u201cThen quit drinking!\u201d\n Grandpa remained silent.\n \u2013\n Han Zhan returned upstairs and went to the washroom to wash his hands.\n He got into bed and Song Ci smelled the lingering scent of medicine on Han Zhan. She asked him, \u201cWhere else did Grandpa fall?\u201d\n \u201cHe fell on his butt.\u201d\n Song Ci remembered that Grandfather indeed landed on his bottom first. \u201cIs it serious?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a bruise and it might hurt for two days.\u201d\n \u201cDid Grandpa agree to go to the hospital with you tomorrow morning?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci was relieved.\n The next morning, when Song Ci woke up, her side was already cold.\n It looked like Han Zhan had been up for a while.\n Song Ci touched her lips, feeling slightly aggrieved.\n Recently, Han Zhan had been coming back late and waking up early. It seemed like it had been a long time since he gave her a morning kiss.\n Song Ci changed and went downstairs. She saw Han Zhan squatting beside a cardboard box and tidying up his belongings. Zhong Buhui handed bottles of wine to Han Zhan.\n Under Han Aoyu\u2019s indignant gaze, Han Zhan neatly placed the alcohol into the paper box.\n \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t understand their act.\n Before Han Zhan and Zhong Buhui could speak, Han Aoyu turned around and stared at Song Ci aggrievedly. He complained to her. \u201cMy good grandson is going to throw the good wine that I have kept for so many years.\u201d\n \u201cInside was all the wine given to me by my old friends! The old guys have all passed away, but the wine they gave me is still there. Seeing wine is like seeing them. I often think of someone when I see it. But this Han Zhan threw my wine. I don\u2019t even have any thoughts.\u201d\n Han Aoyu found a very good excuse for his love of alcohol.\n Song Ci was not moved by Han Aoyu\u2019s heartfelt words.\n She walked up to Zhong Buhui and helped him pass the wine to Han Zhan. As she worked, Song Ci suggested. \u201cBrother Han, it\u2019s a waste to throw away so much wine. Why don\u2019t you donate it?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI think so too. These are all valuable Maotai and are worth a lot of money.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked up at Han Aoyu and said, \u201cJust take it out for auction. Donate all the money sold to the old folks\u2019 home, alright?\u201d\n Han Aoyu wanted to refuse.\n Han Zhan added, \u201cGrandpa, those old folks in the old folks\u2019 home don\u2019t have any wives or descendants. They\u2019re very pitiful.\u201d\n \u201cThe money from these bottles of Maotai can buy them a warm blanket and down jacket.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci turned around and looked at Han Aoyu with sparkling eyes. She also said, \u201cGrandpa, doing good deeds is to accumulate virtue for the children.\u201d\n Han Aoyu couldn\u2019t bring himself to say no to the high praise of \u201caccumulating virtue.\u201d\n He waved at the alcohol in pain. \u201cTake it away, take it away. I won\u2019t drink it anymore!\u201d\n He still wanted to live another two years to accompany his great-granddaughter. It was time to quit drinking.\n That day, Han Zhan used Han Aoyu\u2019s name to send that box of Maotai to the auction house. Three days later, there was good news that those six bottles of wine had been sold for a sky-high price of 3 million yuan.\n Meanwhile, the bottle of Maotai that Han Aoyu opened halfway was sold for 600,000 yuan!\n Think about it. It would be such an honor to be able to drink the Maotai wine that Han Aoyu had drunk!\n After Han Zhan received this sum of money, he used Han Aoyu\u2019s name to donate it to a dilapidated elderly home in the west.\n Han Aoyu was a networm.\n When he realized that his donation had been reported by a media company on Weibo, he couldn\u2019t resist reposting that post and leaving comments:\n [Wine money is just a worldly possession. I can\u2019t bring it with me even if I die. I am already old and it is a waste to keep it. Why do you need to report it?]\n Seeing that Han Aoyu had reposted that comment, his fans all left comments.\n Military Beetle: Old Han is indeed magnanimous. His insight is great!\n Beauty: Old Han, look here. I want to give you a heart sign!\n Sister Jade Rabbit likes to eat fish: Look at how honest these old military men are. They donated such a precious Maotai just like that. We must learn from Old Han.\n Little Sweetheart: ^ You can learn from Old Han. Firstly, you must have six bottles of Maotai.\n ...\n Han Aoyu\u2019s heart was bubbling with joy at being idolized by these children.\n He laid in the courtyard humming a tune as he swung his legs around in a very relaxed manner.\n Outside the courtyard, the sound of a car suddenly rang.\n Han Aoyu opened his eyes and stared at the courtyard door. He saw the guard opening the door.\n A silver-gray car drove in and a tall man alighted. It was Shen Yubei, whom he had not seen in a long time.\n Shen Yubei saw Han Aoyu lying in the yard basking in the sun. He stood beside the car and bowed respectfully to Han Aoyu. \u201cOld Master, you are basking in the sun.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s Yubei!\u201d\n Han Aoyu sat up.\n s he sat down, his butt hurt slightly and he couldn\u2019t help frowning slightly.\n Seeing this, Shen Yubei thought that he had done something wrong and offended Han Aoyu. He felt slightly lost. Shen Yubei stood there like a helpless child.\n \u201cI fell yesterday and my bones hurt.\u201d With Han Aoyu\u2019s explanation, Shen Yubei finally understood that he had misunderstood.\n \u201cOld Master, you must be careful. When a person is getting on in years, it\u2019s not a joke to fall.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, a few days ago, Han Zhan brought me to the hospital for a check-up. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Seeing that Shen Yubei was holding a small box, Han Aoyu asked him, \u201cAre you looking for Song Ci?\u201d\n \u201cYes, is Song Ci at home?\u201d\n \u201cShe went for a prenatal checkup and will be back soon.\u201d Han Aoyu invited Shen Yubei to have lunch at home. Since Shen Yubei had nothing to do today, he agreed.\n The two of them sat in the courtyard and chatted.\n Although Shen Yubei was in the arts, he was very knowledgeable and could chat about many topics that Han Aoyu paid attention to.\n Han Aoyu saw that Shen Yubei was very knowledgeable and looked at him in a new light. Han Aoyu was a boorish man who wielded knives and guns. He especially respected cultured people like Shen Yubei. Back then, Han Zhan\u2019s grandmother was an artistic person.\n Han Aoyu was obsessed with her.\n The two of them were chatting happily when Song Ci returned.\n Long Yu sent Song Ci home and left.\n ong Ci was slightly surprised to see Shen Yubei here. \u201cTeacher, when did you come and how long have you been waiting? Why didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d\n \u201cWhy should I rush you for your prenatal checkup?\u201d\n Shen Yubei handed the box to Song Ci. \u201cI am here to send a sample of the movie.\u201d\n Hearing the word movie, Song Ci was momentarily stunned. Only then did she realize that she was also a woman who had acted in Hollywood movies.\n Song Ci took the sample and asked Shen Yubei, \u201cTeacher, have you seen it?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, your Second Master came back the day before yesterday and watched it with me.\u201d\n \u201cHow is it?\u201d Song Ci looked at Shen Yubei expectantly and asked, \u201cDid I perform well? Am I stunning?\u201d\n Shen Yubei stared at Song Ci\u2019s chubby face for a few seconds before saying, \u201cYour performance looks alright. As for whether it\u2019s beautiful...\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to the lighting and post-production.\u201d\n Song Ci felt like hitting someone the moment Shen Yubei said this.\n \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d\n Song Ci asked Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, do you want to watch the sample with me?\u201d\n \u201cIs it that movie you went to France to film previously?\u201d Han Aoyu wasn\u2019t a person who liked to watch movies, especially those kind of artistic films that had a long history. But Han Aoyu was still very expectant of Song Ci\u2019s movie.\n \u201cYes, the sample is out. Grandpa, watch it with me.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n Meanwhile, Shen Yubei, who had watched the sample once, watched it again with Song Ci and Han Aoyu.\n Han Aoyu saw the opening of the movie and said, \u201cThis must be a romance movie.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s mainly about the life of a music genius with autism. It\u2019s a biography.\u201d\n \u201cThen who were you acting in the movie?\u201d Han Aoyu asked curiously.\n ong Ci was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cThe male lead\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d\n Han Aoyu widened his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re acting as someone else\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d\n Song Ci felt slightly awkward and blushed.\n She was clearly innocent, but she felt embarrassed as if she had cheated on another man and was caught by Han Zhan\u2019s grandfather.\n Han Aoyu rubbed his palms on his pants and asked, \u201cThen did you guys kiss? I see very few movies nowadays that don\u2019t have such scenes.\u201d\n Song Ci kept her mouth tightly shut like a clam.\n Shen Yubei looked at the restless Song Ci in amusement and thought to himself, To think that your little girl would have such a day.\n Zhong Buhui also stopped in his tracks and looked curiously at Song Ci.\n Did they kiss?\n Song Ci\u2019s scalp went numb. What should she do? In the movie, she had kissed the male lead! If Grandfather saw this, how should she explain?\n Song Ci finally experienced the feeling of shooting herself in the foot.\n Under the watchful eyes of Shen Yubei and Han Aoyu, Song Ci shook her head calmly and said, \u201cMy scenes are only for half an hour. There\u2019s no kissing scene.\u201d\n Han Aoyu acknowledged but didn\u2019t say anything.\n Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the toilet.\u201d\n It was very normal for pregnant women to have diapers during the late stages of pregnancy. Han Aoyu didn\u2019t suspect that Song Ci was lying.\n Song Ci ran to the toilet and stayed there for a while. She secretly went to the power box and pulled down the power switch guiltily.\n Song Ci pulled the power switch and heard Han Aoyu mutter in the living room. \u201cWhy did the power go out?\u201d\n Song Ci turned and saw a burly man standing behind her.\n \u201cOh my god!\u201d Song Ci patted her chest and complained to Zhong Buhui. \u201cUncle Zhong, who are you trying to scare by standing here quietly?\u201d\n Zhong Buhui pointed at the box. \u201cI saw everything just now.\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly put her finger to her lips. \u201cShh!\u201d\n Zhong Buhui guessed the reason why Song Ci turned off the power and didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n ong Ci said, \u201cThank you, Uncle Zhong.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui returned to the living room and heard Han Aoyu say, \u201cBuhui, did the power go out, or did the power switch go off at home?\u201d\n \u201cThere might be a short circuit. The circuit has aged. I\u2019ll go and check what went wrong.\u201d Zhong Buhui smiled at Song Ci, went to the tool shed, and pretended to check the tools.\n Song Ci came back after \u201cgoing to the toilet\u201d and said to Han Aoyu, \u201cLooks like we won\u2019t be able to watch the movie.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s watch it tonight then.\u201d\n Han Aoyu chatted with Shen Yubei again and totally forgot about the movie. Shen Yubei and Han Aoyu went to the tearoom to drink tea. From the corner of his eye, he saw Song Ci secretly taking out the sample and couldn\u2019t help smiling.\n Little fox!\n After lunch, Shen Yubei got up and bid farewell.\n Song Ci went to send Shen Yubei off and left the house. After Han Aoyu couldn\u2019t hear her, Song Ci asked Shen Yubei, \u201cTeacher, how are you and Godmother Rongrong now?\u201d\n Shen Yubei\u2019s ears were slightly red. He stammered. \u201cDon\u2019t you know her? She\u2019s very clingy. I told her to stay away from me, but she can always find all sorts of reasons to appear in front of me.\u201d\n Song Ci chuckled. She thought to herself: If Godmother Rongrong doesn\u2019t appear in front of you, you will probably panic and be afraid. Then, you\u2019ll find a reason to appear in front of her.\n Song Ci smiled. \u201cTeacher, when you get married, I will give you a big red packet.\u201d\n Shen Yubei blushed and flew into a rage out of humiliation. He scolded Song Ci. \u201cShut up. Who makes fun of their teacher like that?!\u201d\n \u201cHehe.\u201d\n After sending Shen Yubei off, Song Ci returned to her room with the sample and looked at it on her laptop.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t help sizing herself up in front of the mirror when she saw that fairy-like woman in the movie.\n fter she got pregnant, her family always cooked delicacies for her in a different way. Song Ci didn\u2019t have the kind of physique where she couldn\u2019t gain weight easily. After a few months of recuperation, she gained dozens of pounds.\n Before she got pregnant, Song Ci, who was 1.7 meters tall, only weighed 50 kilograms. Now, in August of her pregnancy, Song Ci actually gained 15 kilograms of weight!\n She would continue to gain weight!\n Song Ci pinched her round face, double chin, and fat legs. She felt suffocated.\n Han Zhan returned at night and saw Song Ci sitting by the bed unhappily, looking through her old photos. He turned to look at the photos on Song Ci\u2019s cell phone and said, \u201cWhy are you always looking at old photos?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI just felt that I was especially beautiful then.\u201d\n \u201cYou are also very beautiful now.\u201d\n Although Song Ci had gained weight, her features were still very well-defined. Even if she gained weight, she would still be a fat beauty.\n Song Ci was not comforted by Han Zhan\u2019s words.\n Song Ci tossed her cell phone aside and climbed out of bed. She stood barefoot on the wooden floor.\n Song Ci twirled in front of Han Zhan so that he could size her up 360 degrees.\n Han Zhan was confused.\n \u201cWhat are you doing? Spinning in circles?\u201d Han Zhan couldn\u2019t follow Song Ci\u2019s train of thought.\n Song Ci pointed at her double chin and fat thigh. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, you said that it\u2019s cuter if one is fatter. Do you think I am cute when I am fat?\u201d\n Han Zhan gave Song Ci a meaningful look. \u201cOf course you\u2019re cute.\u201d\n \u201cHow adorable?\u201d\n Han Zhan racked his brains and thought for a moment. \u201cFull and adorable?\u201d Like a panda baby.\n Song Ci was thunderstruck.\n She was about to cry.\n That night, Song Ci didn\u2019t say much. Han Zhan was also tired from work and didn\u2019t notice the change in Song Ci\u2019s mood.\n For many consecutive days, Song Ci was depressed. By the time Han Zhan realized the seriousness of the problem, Song Ci\u2019s condition was already very bad.\n He realized that Song Ci\u2019s mental state was off one night.\n That night, Han Zhan returned home at 11pm. He gently pushed open the door and saw Song Ci sitting by the bed, still awake.\n Han Zhan was slightly surprised to see that Song Ci was still awake.\n Han Zhan turned on the lights. \u201cBaby Ci, why aren\u2019t you asleep? Are you waiting for me?\u201d\n Song Ci looked up and stared at Han Zhan with a dark expression, her eyes scrutinizing him.\n Han Zhan felt that Song Ci\u2019s gaze was slightly strange.\n Song Ci got up and got off the bed. She walked barefoot to Han Zhan\u2019s side and sniffed his neck.\n Song Ci smelled the alcohol and said in an unfriendly tone, \u201cYou drank.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt apologetic and said, \u201cI promised to stop drinking, but I was so happy to see my old friend today that I couldn\u2019t resist drinking a little with him.\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cI called your assistant this afternoon.\u201d\n Han Zhan, \u201cMmm?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYour assistant said that you got off work at 5pm. But when I called you at 6pm, you said that you were very busy.\u201d\n Han Zhan was momentarily stunned. Realizing that Song Ci was suspecting him, his brows twitched. He felt slightly annoyed but also didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n \u201cI did get off work at 5pm because a friend of mine came to Wangdong City and called me to ask me out for dinner.\u201d\n Do you still remember? I told you in the past that when I was in high school, I had a very good friend. After graduating from the college entrance examination, he joined the military with me. He brought his wife and children to Wangdong City today. We haven\u2019t seen each other for many years and are good brothers. I got off work early and held a banquet for them.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s explanation was very clear, but Song Ci still suspected Han Zhan like she was being paranoid.\n Song Ci asked, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you bring me along? Did you really visit a friend?\u201d Song Ci started to get angry. She said, \u201cIn the past few months, you\u2019ve been meeting a friend or attending a banquet, but you didn\u2019t bring me along!\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan, did I get pregnant, gain weight, and become ugly? You disliked bringing me out to embarrass yourself, so you didn\u2019t bring me along!\u201d Song Ci shouted the last sentence.\n Han Zhan was stunned by Song Ci\u2019s shout.\n He looked at Song Ci, who had suddenly lost her temper, and was slightly shocked. \u201cBaby Ci, why would you think that?\u201d The Song Ci that Han Zhan knew was a confident and arrogant girl. When did she become like this?\n She was suspicious, not confident, and had a bad temper.\n Han Zhan realized that there was something wrong with Song Ci\u2019s mental health.\n Song Ci lifted her pyjamas and pointed at her big tummy. She said with a pained expression, \u201cDid you see my big tummy and the ugly pregnancy marks on it? You think that I\u2019m ugly, and you don\u2019t love me anymore!\u201d\n She pinched the fat on her arm again and questioned Han Zhan neurotically, \u201cSeeing my arm that is thicker than a girl\u2019s calf, do you hate me? Did you find an even prettier and younger girl? Did you go and meet another woman tonight!\u201d\n Song Ci was like a hedgehog, sticking up all over her body with sharp thorns, stabbing each thorn into Han Zhan\u2019s flesh.\n Han Zhan, why am I like this?! I\u2019m doing this for our children. I don\u2019t want to gain weight either, but if I don\u2019t eat more, the children will be malnourished!\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan, how can you hate me! How can you despise me!\u201d\n Song Ci suddenly ran into the cloakroom, opened the cupboard door, and swept all the beautiful dresses, clothes, shoes, and bags she had bought before she got pregnant onto the floor.\n Han Zhan chased up to the door of the cloakroom and saw Song Ci venting her anger on those clothes and shoes. He stopped in his tracks and watched this scene in shock.\n Song Ci\u2019s behavior reminded Han Zhan of a disease.\n Depression.\n When did Song Ci\u2019s condition start to deteriorate?\n Why didn\u2019t I notice anything?\n Han Zhan was very worried about Song Ci and blamed himself.\n He had neglected Song Ci.\n Song Ci was still angry and threw another set of beautiful jewelry on the ground. The gems fell to the ground and broke a corner.\n Looking at the gorgeous jewelry, Song Ci suddenly stopped making a scene. She looked up at Han Zhan standing under the door and suddenly said, \u201cHan Zhan, you haven\u2019t kissed me for 20 consecutive days.\u201d\n \u201cIn the past, you would kiss me every morning. If I tease you slightly, you will lose control and not be able to resist. But Han Zhan, you haven\u2019t touched me for a long time...\u201d\n \u201cIs it because I became ugly and fat?\u201d Song Ci suddenly grabbed the meat on her arm forcefully. \u201cIt\u2019s all this fatty meat\u2019s fault! It\u2019s all their fault!\u201d\n \u201cSong Ci! Don\u2019t be like this!\u201d Han Zhan hurriedly strode over, separated Song Ci\u2019s hands, and locked her arms behind her back.\n Hugging Song Ci tightly, Han Zhan panted heavily on top of her head in fear.\n Song Ci gradually calmed down as Han Zhan hugged her tightly.\n After calming down, Song Ci recalled what she had just said and done and was slightly shocked by her own unreasonable behavior.\n \u201cHan Zhan, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I just...\u201d Tears streamed down Song Ci\u2019s face as she said softly,\u201d I\u2019m just scared. I\u2019m so scared. I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t be able to lose weight again. I\u2019m scared that you\u2019ll have a change of heart and that you\u2019ll have someone else outside. I...\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know what she was thinking. \u201cHan Zhan, I really didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d\n She felt that it was her fault and that she was being unreasonable. She started to apologize to Han Zhan.\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s incoherent explanation, Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached so much that it felt like it was about to split open.\n \u201cBaby Ci.\u201d Han Zhan kissed Song Ci\u2019s hair lovingly. \u201cBaby Ci, don\u2019t be afraid. You are just sick. Brother Han will bring you to the doctor. You will recover.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned Song Ci around and lowered his head to kiss her tears.\n Han Zhan told Song Ci seriously, \u201cBaby Ci, when you called me today, my friend\u2019s car happened to break down and I was repairing his car. The reason why I didn\u2019t ask you to eat with us is that my friend\u2019s wife is Du Xueyan\u2019s best friend. I\u2019m afraid that you two will be awkward when you meet.\u201d\n \u201cBaby Ci, I don\u2019t despise you, I don\u2019t detest you, I don\u2019t feel that bringing you out would be embarrassing.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t to kiss you. I give you an early morning kiss every morning, but you were still in a deep sleep then. I am not uninterested in you either, but you are in the late stages of pregnancy now and I don\u2019t dare to provoke you.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I lied. I didn\u2019t consider your feelings.\u201d\n Han Zhan spoke very slowly and clearly.\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, Song Ci gradually calmed down.\n She told Han Zhan, \u201cA few days ago, I saw the movie sample Second Old Master Gu gave me. I saw that beautiful and charming self in the movie. Thinking of how I am now, I feel so sad, so sad...\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded. \u201cI know. You\u2019re just in a bad mood. I\u2019ll bring you to the psychologist tomorrow. We can\u2019t avoid it.\u201d\n \u201c... Okay.\u201d\n Han Zhan pulled Song Ci to the bed and laid down with her.\n Hugging Song Ci, Han Zhan patted her shoulder gently. After she fell asleep, Han Zhan called Song Fei.\n Song Fei was a night owl. She was still online gaming and hadn\u2019t slept.\n \u201cBrother-in-law.\u201d Song Fei unwrapped a candy and asked Han Zhan, \u201cIt\u2019s already so late, why are you looking for me?\u201d\n \u201cSister Fei, how was the psychologist you found for Yan Jiang?\u201d\n He\u2019s a dabbler. It\u2019s all thanks to our Ah Jiang\u2019s strong mental fortitude.\u201d Saying that, Song Fei thought of something and her expression changed slightly. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cWho wants to see a psychologist?\u201d\n Han Zhan told her, \u201cSong Ci.\u201d\n In the game, Song Fei missed her shot and hit her teammate in the head.\n Her teammate collapsed to the ground.\n \u201cF*ck!\u201d That teammate cursed and quickly realized who he was scolding. He hurriedly lowered himself and asked curiously, \u201cF, is something the matter on your side? You missed your shot.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cI\u2019m taking a call. You guys play first.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Fei took her cell phone and walked to the balcony.\n She leaned against the railing and stared at the pool downstairs. She frowned and asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat happened? What happened to the little fool?\u201d\n Han Zhan told her, \u201cSong Ci seems to be suffering from depression.\u201d Han Zhan told Song Fei what Song Ci did tonight.\n Han Zhan was just stating the facts objectively and didn\u2019t exaggerate. After that, Han Zhan asked Song Fei, \u201cDoes her condition look like she suffered from pregnancy depression?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it. She is.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt helpless. He said, \u201cI want to bring her to see a psychologist. I can\u2019t let her continue to let her imagination run wild alone.\u201d\n But Song Fei said, \u201cSend her to me.\u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cSend her over. I will accompany her and her condition will be better.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s give it a try then...\u201d\n The next morning, Han Zhan woke up very early. He arrived at the first level and was stopped by Han Aoyu, who had also woken up early to practice Tai Chi.\n Han Aoyu asked Han Zhan, \u201cDid Song Lass lose her temper last night?\u201d\n Han Zhan silently acknowledged.\n Han Aoyu thought that Han Zhan had done something wrong and angered Song Ci, so he told Han Zhan, \u201cYou are a man and you are older than her. You have to give in to her. Why did you make her angry?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d After thinking for a moment, Han Zhan still told Han Aoyu about Song Ci\u2019s illness.\n Han Aoyu didn\u2019t understand how serious pregnancy depression was at first. He looked it up and realized that people could die during pregnancy depression!\n Han Aoyu was so scared that he broke out in cold sweat. He hurriedly found Han Zhan and said, \u201cQuickly find a psychiatrist. Don\u2019t delay the golden treatment time.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cSong Ci\u2019s elder sister asked me to send Song Ci to her place to live with her for a period of time. Song Ci\u2019s condition isn\u2019t very serious yet. With Song Fei by her side, she might get better.\u201d\n \u201cIs it reliable?\u201d\n Han Zhan told Old Master Han how Song Fei cured Yan Jiang.\n Only then did Han Aoyu agree.\n As a result, that morning, Han Zhan sent Song Ci to Song Fei\u2019s house. From that day onwards, Han Zhan also checked into Yan Jiang\u2019s house after work.\n This way, Yan Jiang\u2019s house was instantly bustling with activity.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t live in their house for nothing. He was in charge of the water, electricity, electricity, and living expenses.\n Song Ci was still very depressed. She frequently cried for no reason and apologized to the person beside her after crying. Song Fei also felt slightly upset at Song Ci\u2019s mental state.\n On this day, Song Ci woke up from her afternoon nap and realized that she was alone in the house. She suddenly felt like she had been abandoned by the entire world. Song Ci started crying again without warning.\n She was crying so bitterly that she woke up Song Fei, who was sleeping in her room.\n Song Fei heard Song Ci crying and hurriedly opened the door. She ran downstairs and hugged Song Ci, who was wailing on the carpet.\n \u201cSong Ci, don\u2019t cry!\u201d\n Song Ci grabbed Song Fei\u2019s arm tightly and asked her in tears, \u201cSong Fei, where have you all gone? Do you all not want me anymore?\u201d\n \u201cMy elder sister is here. How can I not want you? Song Ci, you are my only family. No matter who I throw away, I will never abandon you!\u201d\n Song Ci hugged Song Fei and cried for a long while before calming down.\n Song Fei went to pour her a cup of hot tea.\n Song Ci held the tea Song Fei handed her. She took a sip and said listlessly, \u201cSong Fei, am I going to die of illness?\u201d\n \u201cNonsense.\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei, don\u2019t have children in the future. It\u2019s too scary to have children.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cI won\u2019t have a child.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled weakly and praised Song Fei. \u201cYou have foresight.\u201d\n Song Fei shook her head and said, \u201cSong Ci, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to have children. I just can\u2019t have children.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n \u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t have children?\u201d She stammered.\n Song Fei smiled at her in relief and told her, \u201cYan Jiang told me that my constitution is poor and that I am not suitable for pregnancy in recent years. I felt that something was off then. Later, I went to the doctor for a check-up and he told me that I can\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d\n That earthquake back then injured my uterus and I will never get pregnant in this life. Yan Jiang personally dug me up back then. He must know how badly I was injured then.\u201d\n \u201cHe told me that I can\u2019t get pregnant these few years. It\u2019s just a temporary measure.\u201d\n Song Fei walked up to Song Ci and sat down. She leaned on Song Ci\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cSong Ci, your elder sister can\u2019t get pregnant anymore. You must be strong and give birth to our Song family\u2019s child safely.\u201d\n \u201cThe bloodline of Old Song\u2019s family will depend on you.\u201d\n This was also the reason why Song Fei had requested Song Ci to have a child and inherit the Song Family\u2019s legacy.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "231": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-232\n\n Chapter 231: Song Song, I Can\u2019t Bear To Make You Sad  Song Fei couldn\u2019t conceive anymore.\n This was like a bolt out of the blue to Song Ci. She was shocked and in disbelief.\n How is this possible?\n Song Fei looked very healthy. Why can\u2019t she get pregnant?\n Song Ci was about to cry. She grabbed Song Fei\u2019s wrist and asked, \u201cSong Fei, are you lying to me again?\u201d\n Song Fei loved to lie.\n Song Fei didn\u2019t explain and just looked at her in silence. There was a hint of sadness in her cold eyes.\n Holding Song Ci\u2019s cold fingers, Song Fei comforted her instead. \u201cSong Ci, I just can\u2019t get pregnant. It\u2019s nothing. To me, it\u2019s already the heavens\u2019 mercy to be able to survive.\u201d\n Song Fei and Yan Jiang were very satisfied that they were still alive.\n Everything would be infinitely smaller when compared to life and death.\n \u201cAlthough it will be a pity if I can\u2019t have a child with Yan Jiang, I am very happy to think that I am still alive and can still live with you guys.\u201d\n As for the child, Song Fei didn\u2019t insist on it anymore.\n Perhaps I\u2019m born cold and have no affinity with children.\n Song Ci cried.\n Tears streamed down her face on their own accord. But this time, Song Ci just quietly cried. She didn\u2019t go crazy or spout nonsense.\n Crying, she hugged Song Fei\u2019s skinny body tightly and apologized over and over again. \u201cSong Fei, it\u2019s all my fault! I\u2019m the one who dragged you down. If not for saving me, you wouldn\u2019t have been in a coma for so many years and missed the best time to go to school and ended up with the aftereffects of infertility.\u201d\n \u201cSong Fei, can you beat me up?\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Song Fei stroked Song Ci\u2019s hair gently like her mother.\n She said, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to hit you.\u201d Although Song Ci was stupid and annoying, Song Fei couldn\u2019t bear to hit her.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I did everything willingly.\u201d Under any circumstances, Song Fei had to protect her sister well. This was her responsibility.\n Hearing this \u201cwillingly\u201d, Song Ci cried even harder.\n Song Fei patted Song Ci\u2019s back and comforted her. \u201cStop crying. Look, you are pregnant with two children at once. This is fate. Song Ci, compared to me who wants a child but can\u2019t get pregnant, you are already very fortunate now.\u201d\n \u201cBeing fat and ugly is only temporary. When the child is born, he will laugh, cry, and call you mother. At that time, you will know that your persistence and sacrifice are all worth it.\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan loves you very much. He won\u2019t dare to mess around outside. If he really can\u2019t control that third leg, I will help you cut it.\u201d\n \u201cSo, for the remaining month or so, you must take good care of yourself and the two babies. After the child is born, I will find the best weight-loss specialist for you. I guarantee that you will look as good as before you got pregnant.\u201d\n Song Fei was not a talkative person, but today, she said a lot in one breath.\n Song Ci nodded tearfully. \u201cAlright, I will listen to you.\u201d\n That night, Yan Jiang and Han Zhan arrived home one after another. Song Fei had already prepared dinner.\n During the meal, they clearly noticed that Song Ci was slightly different. A few days ago, she was very resistant to eating and would only eat a little after Han Zhan\u2019s persuasion.\n But tonight, Song Ci actually took the initiative to pick up her bowl and eat three pieces of braised pork.\n Seeing this, Han Zhan was slightly happy. He asked Song Ci probingly, \u201cBaby Ci, your appetite is not bad tonight?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded and glanced at Song Fei. \u201cSong Fei\u2019s dishes are delicious.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Fei picked up a drumstick from Song Ci\u2019s bowl, the biggest one. \u201cEat more if you like it.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Song Fei.\u201d\n Song Ci continued eating.\n Song Ci ate two bowls of white rice and half a bowl of soup for this meal.\n Taking in Song Ci\u2019s performance, Han Zhan was both happy and puzzled. Han Zhan shot Song Fei a puzzled look and thought to himself: It has only been a day since we last met, why has Song Ci changed so much?\n What did Song Fei say to Song Ci?\n It looked like it was the right decision to send Song Ci over to stay with Song Fei for a period of time.\n After dinner, Han Zhan went to the side of the pool and called Han Aoyu to report Song Ci\u2019s situation today.\n Knowing that Song Ci\u2019s mood had improved and that she could eat and drink without crying, Han Aoyu was especially happy.\n He said over the phone, \u201cThen you guys can stay at that Big Lass Song\u2019s place for a longer period of time. As long as Song Ci is happy, I will be assured.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n After ending the call, Han Zhan turned and stepped on the smooth stone pavement, preparing to go home. Passing by the garden, Han Zhan saw Song Ci and Yan Jiang sitting on the swing beside the garden.\n The two of them had their heads very close to each other. No one knew what they were talking about.\n If he didn\u2019t know that there was nothing between Yan Jiang and Song Ci, Han Zhan really would have suspected that there was something between them.\n After standing there in silence for a moment, Han Zhan suddenly turned and returned from another path. Not eavesdropping on Song Ci and Yan Jiang\u2019s conversation was Han Zhan\u2019s respect and trust for his wife.\n Han Zhan returned to the room and heard the sound of boxing coming from the training room behind.\n Han Zhan arrived at the training room and saw Song Fei practicing boxing. She was wearing a black, elastic tight suit and grey loose pants. She had gloves on and practiced boxing.\n Han Zhan leaned against the door and watched for a while. Just as he was about to leave, Song Fei suddenly turned around and said to him, \u201cBrother-in-law, come in for a fight.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned around and stared at Song Fei\u2019s slender figure. He frowned and said calmly, \u201cFighting with me is asking for it.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cLet\u2019s try.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan took off his shoes and coat and walked into the boxing room. Disgusted that his shirt was hindering his physical performance, Han Zhan even took off his shirt.\n Song Fei stared at the scars on Han Zhan\u2019s body and raised her brows.\n Han Zhan picked up the glove and shot Song Fei a sharp look. \u201cI will never show mercy to my enemies.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cNo need to be soft-hearted.\u201d\n With that, Song Fei took the initiative to attack.\n Her slender figure had great explosive power, but compared to Han Zhan, who was experienced and disciplined, Song Fei was still too weak.\n Before Song Fei\u2019s strong fist could hit Han Zhan, he quickly dodged it. He circled behind Song Fei and punched her left shoulder.\n Song Fei snorted and turned to stare at Han Zhan coldly. \u201cYou dare to hit me?\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows. \u201cYou said I don\u2019t have to be soft-hearted.\u201d\n Song Fei sneered.\n \u201cAlright!\u201d\n Song Fei attacked Han Zhan again. Han Zhan was about to grab Song Fei\u2019s arm, when Song Fei opened her fist and stuffed a blue pill into Han Zhan\u2019s mouth.\n Han Zhan was momentarily caught off guard and swallowed the pill.\n That taste...\n It\u2019s like eating chocolate.\n Han Zhan hurriedly stopped, took off his boxing gloves, knelt on the ground, grabbed his own throat with his left hand, and reached his gloved right hand directly into his throat.\n After a few seconds, Han Zhan successfully vomited out the food in his stomach.\n Seeing this, Song Fei frowned and quickly jumped out of the room. She stood in the corridor with good ventilation and looked at the disgusting Han Zhan in disdain.\n Han Zhan stared at the little pill on the ground. He turned back angrily and glared at Song Fei who was outside the door.\n \u201cSong Fei, you are courting death!\u201d For the first time, Han Zhan disregarded his friendly facade in front of Song Fei and revealed a vicious gaze like a hungry wolf.\n Han Zhan clenched his fists and asked Song Fei, \u201cWhat did you feed me?\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cI call it the \u2018Cutting Off Bloodline\u2019 pill.\u201d\n Cutting off bloodline!\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed drastically!\n \u201cSong Fei, don\u2019t be lawless just because you are Song Ci\u2019s elder sister.\u201d Han Zhan stared at Song Fei\u2019s snow-capped eyes and threatened her. \u201cYou won\u2019t have a good ending if you provoke me.\u201d\n He respected Song Fei because of Song Ci. If Song Fei really did something that crossed his bottom line, Han Zhan would kill her without hesitation!\n Song Fei was unafraid of Han Zhan\u2019s threat.\n She pouted and suddenly said, \u201cIt\u2019s popping candy.\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned.\n Popping candy?\n Song Fei took out a syringe from her pocket.\n There was some light-colored medicine in that syringe. Song Fei shook the syringe and told Han Zhan, \u201cInside this is the medicine that can really cut off your family line.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at that syringe and remained silent.\n He understood that Song Fei was purposely scaring him and punishing him.\n He had indeed done something wrong recently.\n Song Fei\u2019s expression was very cold. She said sternly, \u201cHan Zhan, if you dare to mess around outside behind my sister\u2019s back, I definitely have a way to let it enter your stomach.\u201d\n After knowing that the pill was just a candy, Han Zhan returned to his usual hypocritical and modest self.\n Hearing this, his lashes quivered as he promised. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. I only love Song Ci.\u201d\n \u201cIt better be.\u201d\n Song Fei placed the items back into her pocket.\n She looked up at Han Zhan\u2019s elegant and handsome face and said, \u201cMy sister especially loves to be beautiful and has a fragile heart. Han Zhan, you can\u2019t say that she\u2019s ugly and think that she\u2019s fat. If she really can\u2019t slim down in the future, you can\u2019t despise her and abandon her.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d\n \u201cIt better be. If you dare to abandon her, I will make sure you will never have any desire for women again.\u201d\n Song Fei was slightly unhappy with Han Zhan. If not for Han Zhan being busy with work and neglecting Song Ci, how could Song Ci have suffered from depression?\n If I don\u2019t punish him, he won\u2019t learn his lesson.\n Song Fei left after saying those harsh words.\n Han Zhan went to the washroom to rinse his mouth, before taking the broom and mop to the training room.\n \u2013\n The two inside the house nearly fell out, but outside the house, Song Ci and Yan Jiang were having a heart-to-heart talk.\n \u201cSong Fei told me everything,\u201d Song Ci said.\n These words came out of nowhere and Yan Jiang didn\u2019t understand what Song Ci was saying. \u201cWhat did Song Fei tell you?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cIt\u2019s about her infertility. Ah Jiang, it\u2019s fine if you hide it from Song Fei, but why did you hide it from me?\u201d\n Hearing the first half of Song Ci\u2019s words, Yan Jiang\u2019s expression changed drastically. \u201cYou said that Ah Fei knew that she couldn\u2019t get pregnant?\u201d Yan Jiang was shocked. \u201cWhen did she know?\u201d\n It was Song Ci\u2019s turn to be shocked.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you know that Song Fei knows about this?\u201d Song Ci thought that Song Fei and Yan Jiang had already talked things out.\n Yan Jiang shook his head slowly. \u201cI always thought that Ah Fei didn\u2019t know.\u201d That was why he had been very careful and purposely avoided talking about giving birth.\n Yan Jiang was afraid that Song Fei would notice something amiss and secretly go to the doctor for a check-up.\n Unexpectedly, Song Fei already knew the truth!\n Yan Jiang asked Song Ci, \u201cWhen did Song Fei go for the checkup?\u201d\n \u201cIt should be during the period when you lied to her and said that the doctor thought she was weak and unsuitable for pregnancy in recent years.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was stunned.\n Song Ci told Yan Jiang, \u201cAh Jiang, don\u2019t belittle Song Fei. She is very smart. You lied to her then and she saw through your lie.\u201d\n Yan Jiang had mixed feelings and remained silent for a long time.\n He had always wanted to hide this from Song Fei and planned to tell her in a few years. Unexpectedly, Song Fei already knew.\n \u201cWhat does Ah Fei think about this?\u201d Yan Jiang didn\u2019t have the courage to ask Song Fei herself. That would be too cruel.\n Song Ci said, \u201cWhen she spoke about that matter, her tone was very calm. But I know that she definitely can\u2019t get over it.\u201d\n Being infertile was ultimately a form of harm to a woman who wanted a child.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know what Song Fei was thinking, but she knew that Song Fei must be feeling very pained after knowing this outcome.\n It was just that Song Fei had learned to endure all sorts of blows and pain, so she always had a cold face to hide all the pain in her heart.\n Only then did Yan Jiang tell Song Ci, \u201cWhen she knew that you and Han Zhan were preparing for pregnancy, Ah Fei especially wanted a child. Being competitive is one thing, but liking children is another.\u201d\n The Song sisters liked children very much. Song Ci used to get along very well with those little brats in the community.\n As Song Fei looked cold and unapproachable, she didn\u2019t have the affinity for children. But she would often put a few sweets in her pocket and give one to a child she liked.\n Hence, Yan Jiang felt very cruel when he heard that Song Fei wanted to have a child.\n \u201cI already knew that she couldn\u2019t get pregnant. That year, when I dug her out from the earthquake, she lost consciousness due to the blood flow from her scalp. A steel tube happened to be inserted in the center of her abdomen.\u201d\n Recalling the scene of the earthquake in Bijiang City many years ago, where he successfully dug Song Fei out of the mud and concrete, Yan Jiang still felt afraid.\n At that time, Song Fei was covered in dirt and dust, even her lashes.\n Song Fei was seriously injured and the blood and dust on her head had dried up. That steel tube was stuck in the middle of her abdomen.\n Yan Jiang didn\u2019t dare to touch Song Fei at that time. The doctor and the rescue team worked together to lift her onto the stretcher.\n Song Fei, who was still breathing, and the other seriously injured patients were placed in a wide blue shed. The doctor took out that steel tube and saw the blood at the bottom. He told Yan Jiang, \u201cThis girl\u2019s uterus is seriously injured. I\u2019m afraid she can\u2019t be a mother in the future.\u201d\n At that time, Yan Jiang, who had just turned 18, felt like he had been struck by lightning.\n Song Fei was the girl he had secretly liked for many years. There were countless times when he hid under the blanket and secretly fantasized about him marrying the beauty Song Fei and having children with her, after they grow up.\n But the doctor said that Song Fei couldn\u2019t get pregnant in the future.\n After Song Fei\u2019s condition stabilized, she didn\u2019t wake up. Yan Jiang thought of a way to send her back to Wangdong City People\u2019s Hospital.\n Song Fei was in a vegetative state and had to use all sorts of devices to monitor her physical condition every day. She also needed nutrient fluids. The doctor told Yan Jiang that Song Fei\u2019s annual medical fees would not be less than 600,000 yuan.\n At that time, Yan Jiang had just started university. Where could he find a job that could earn 600,000 yuan a year?\n Coincidentally, during that period, there happened to be an agency that looked up to Yan Jiang and wanted to sign him as an artist.\n Yan Jiang signed the contract without hesitation.\n But after signing the contract, the company didn\u2019t treat Yan Jiang kindly. He didn\u2019t receive any work for two consecutive months and didn\u2019t earn any money. Yan Jiang was as anxious as an ant on a hot fire.\n At this point, Song Ci was adopted by the Mu Family. The Mu Family found Song Ci\u2019s lost elder sister, Song Fei, and was willing to pay her medical fees for free.\n In order to let Song Fei live, Yan Jiang had no choice but to give up his love.\n The day the Mu Family took Song Fei away from the hospital, Yan Jiang hid in the crowd and watched her disappear from his life.\n Yan Jiang had signed a four-year contract with his management company. In those four years, he had barely earned a single cent. Later, Lan Ling took a fancy to Yan Jiang\u2019s face and poached him from his original company to send him to film.\n Yan Jiang, who graduated from forensic science, had become the most dazzling celebrity in the entertainment circle.\n He had made a lot of money, but he had lost the woman who was qualified to spend his money.\n So many years later, when Song Ci came looking for him and begged him to help her steal Song Fei from the convalescent hospital, no one knew how ecstatic Yan Jiang was.\n Walking out of that painful memory, Yan Jiang rubbed his face and said to Song Ci, \u201cI know Song Fei can\u2019t conceive, but I can\u2019t bear to tell her the truth. Song Fei has been living too hard. I hope she can live happily. So I lied to her.\u201d\n But he never expected Song Fei to see through his lie.\n Song Ci could understand Yan Jiang\u2019s actions.\n Nobody would have the heart to do this.\n Song Ci asked Yan Jiang, \u201cAh Jiang, if you can\u2019t bear to tell Song Fei the truth, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n Yan Jiang smiled bitterly. \u201cDon\u2019t you know the answer?\u201d\n How could Song Ci not understand?\n \u201cAh Jiang, you are afraid that I will feel guilty towards Song Fei after knowing the truth and will feel uneasy for the rest of my life, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d Yan Jiang nodded. \u201cSong Song, I can\u2019t bear for you to be sad.\u201d\n Yan Jiang really doted on Song Ci.\n From a young age, Song Fei was the eldest among the three of them. Meanwhile, Song Ci was silly, gullible, and naive. She was often bullied by Song Fei when she was young.\n Yan Jiang admired Song Fei in his heart and didn\u2019t dare to say anything bad about her. But he couldn\u2019t bear to see Song Ci being deceived by Song Fei.\n From a young age, Yan Jiang had wanted to treat Song Ci better to make up for her bullying.\n It had already become Yan Jiang\u2019s life motto to love Song Ci like his own sister, and love Song Fei like how he would love life.\n Hearing this answer, Song Ci felt very upset.\n She leaned back in her chair and gazed at the leaden sky. She murmured softly. \u201cThere are so many people who love me, but I\u2019m crying bitterly over how I\u2019ve become fat and ugly. I suddenly feel very cowardly and weak.\u201d\n Rubbing her burning eyes, Song Ci said, \u201cI\u2019ve made you guys worried these few days. I\u2019m sorry, I will adjust my mentality as soon as possible.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Yan Jiang stood up and patted Song Ci\u2019s back. \u201cGet well soon. Don\u2019t let your elder sister worry. Did you know? Ah Fei has been checking for information on pregnancy depression these few days. She only went to bed at 3am last night.\u201d\n \u201cSong Song, don\u2019t be fooled by Ah Fei\u2019s cold exterior. She values you more than anything.\u201d With that, Yan Jiang returned to the house.\n Song Ci felt like crying again uselessly.\n Of course she knew that Song Fei treated her more importantly than anything else. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have sacrificed so much for her when the earthquake hit!\n \u2013\n an Jiang entered the house and saw Song Fei leaning against the sofa.\n Her gaze landed on Yan Jiang\u2019s face.\n \u201cYou know?\u201d Song Fei had already seen Yan Jiang and Song Ci talking together.\n Yan Jiang stopped in his tracks and looked at Song Fei. \u201cAh Fei.\u201d\n Song Fei remained silent.\n Yan Jiang said, \u201cIf you really like children, we will adopt one in the future. If you don\u2019t like adopted ones, you can raise me like a child. I am willing to be your little baby.\u201d\n Song Fei suddenly walked up to Yan Jiang and reached under his armpits to hug his waist.\n It was a little woman\u2019s hug.\n Song Fei placed her cheek on Yan Jiang\u2019s chest. \u201cAh Jiang, there\u2019s no hurry to have a child. There\u2019s a medical research big boss in the United States who developed a black technology called man-made uterus. In a few years, when this technology matures, we can have a child of our own.\u201d\n Yan Jiang was shocked by Song Fei\u2019s revelation. \u201cIs there really such advanced technology?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t speak now. Let me hug you.\u201d Song Fei rubbed her head against Yan Jiang\u2019s chest.\n Song Fei\u2019s dependence greatly satisfied Yan Jiang\u2019s vanity as a man.\n When Song Ci walked in, the two of them were still hugging.\n She coughed and attracted Song Fei and Yan Jiang\u2019s attention.\n Seeing that Song Fei had no intention of letting go of Yan Jiang, Song Ci waved her hand. \u201cContinue hugging. I am just passing by.\u201d\n Song Fei said, \u201cGet lost.\u201d\n The guest room was on the second floor and Song Ci\u2019s stomach was getting bigger and bigger. With Du Tingting\u2019s previous experience of wrestling on the stairs, Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to be distracted at all as she went upstairs and downstairs.\n She held onto the railing and climbed upstairs. Only then did she mock Song Fei. \u201cSo clingy. Who are you torturing?\u201d\n Song Ci pushed open the door and saw that Han Zhan had just finished bathing and was wiping his body. Han Zhan had taken off his clothes and his muscles were especially pleasing to the eye. Water droplets hung on his body\u2014it was very alluring.\n Staring at Han Zhan, Song Ci suddenly felt thirsty.\n Ah, I really want Brother Han!\n She was a pervert.\n Song Ci hurriedly took out a bathrobe from the cupboard and threw it on Han Zhan. She flew into a rage out of humiliation. \u201cWear it properly. Who are you showing your meat to!\u201d\n It had been a few days since he was teased by Song Ci. Han Zhan still missed hearing Song Ci tease him.\n Han Zhan put on his bathrobe and saw that Song Ci had been staring at his muscular body.\n Knowing what Song Ci was thinking about, Han Zhan walked over and rubbed her head. \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Brother Han will satisfy you when the baby is born.\u201d\n Blushing, Song Ci slapped Han Zhan\u2019s hand away.\n \u201cLet me tell you something.\u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d\n Song Ci pulled Han Zhan to the bed and sat down. Only then did she tell Han Zhan about Song Fei\u2019s infertility.\n Hearing this, Han Zhan was also slightly shocked.\n Thinking of how Song Fei ended up like this because she saved Song Ci, Han Zhan also felt guilty.\n Han Zhan had also let go of the grudge from being threatened by Song Fei previously.\n Song Ci had overheard their conversation downstairs.\n Song Ci said to Han Zhan, \u201cAren\u2019t Godmother Mo Yao and the rest using artificial wombs to give birth? Ask Godmother later on what to do to obtain a spot. I want to fight for a spot for Song Fei.\u201d\n The artificial uterus had yet to be promoted globally. In addition, the cost was too expensive, so it was very difficult to obtain a spot.\n Mo Yao only got a spot, as she had a lot of money and spent a huge sum of money to fund the research and development of the artificial uterus project.\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s suggestion, Han Zhan agreed.\n If he could give Song Fei a spot and give them a child, it would be a good thing if they could realize Song Fei\u2019s dreams of becoming a mother.\n \u201cGodmother might already be sleeping. I\u2019ll call tomorrow morning to ask.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Seeing that Song Ci had taken off her clothes and was about to take a shower, Han Zhan averted his gaze and looked at the green plant in the corner. He said, \u201cI won\u2019t be going to work tomorrow. Go somewhere with me.\u201d\n Song Ci asked him where he was going. Han Zhan purposely didn\u2019t tell her and only said, \u201cThere won\u2019t be any surprise if I tell you. You will know when you go and see it tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re so boring.\u201d\n Song Ci sat down on the bed, turned on the movie that she didn\u2019t finish yesterday, and continued watching. After that, Song Ci fell asleep.\n During the third trimester, Song Ci had to go to the toilet several times a night. This night, she went back and forth several times and didn\u2019t sleep well.\n In the morning, Song Ci was still yawning.\n Han Zhan was already dressed up and standing on the balcony to make a call.\n There was a glass door between the room and the small balcony. Through a white gauze curtain, Song Ci saw Han Zhan\u2019s side profile standing on the balcony.\n He was dressed more casually today. He was wearing a black turtleneck sweater and a pair of grey suit pants. His blue windbreaker looked especially stylish on the long-legged Han Zhan.\n Song Ci felt that Han Zhan\u2019s hair had to be longer. With a fashionable hairstyle, he was even more charming than those male celebrities in the entertainment circles.\n But Song Ci loved Han Zhan\u2019s buzz cut. He was energetic, clean, and slightly hard to touch, but very addictive.\n Hearing Song Ci slowly turning over on the bed, Han Zhan turned slightly and looked at her. Nodding at Song Ci, Han Zhan turned back and continued talking on the phone.\n After chatting for a few more minutes, Han Zhan hung up.\n Song Ci put on a thick jacket and walked to the balcony. She stood beside Han Zhan and asked him, \u201cWho were you calling?\u201d\n \u201cGodmother Mo Yao.\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat did Godmother say?\u201d\n Han Zhan raised his brows, turned his cell phone in his hand, and said, \u201cGodmother said that she directly invested 10 billion yuan and became the investor of this project, so she got a spot.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n \u201c10-10 billion?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s Zeus Corporation had just been established and was in the midst of spending money. Meanwhile, Zeus Corporation\u2019s research and development was even more expensive than the artificial womb and was still in the midst of financing.\n It would be very difficult for him to invest 10 billion yuan in the artificial uterus project.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cWe have to wait a few more years, at most three years.\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n \u201cChange your clothes first. We will go out after breakfast.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n Song Ci chose a maternity coat from the wardrobe and changed into it. After tying up her hair, she sat at the dressing table and put on light makeup to look radiant.\n After putting on makeup, Song Ci stared at the fat beauty in the mirror and smiled.\n Ever since she gained weight from her pregnancy, Song Ci had never posted a photo of herself on Weibo. But today, she decided to face her true self bravely.\n Song Ci turned on the lights and took a few photos of herself with the camera lens.\n She chose a nicer photo and posted it on Weibo.\n She wrote:\n Song Song Song Song Ci: [Recently, there have been people asking me why I am not active and not posting photos.\n Due to my pregnancy, I had gained over 30 pounds in just eight months. My once beautiful face had turned round and I had double chin on my slender neck.\n I look at the person in the mirror and often feel unfamiliar.\n I didn\u2019t have the courage to face my fat and ugly self. As a result, I was depressed for a period of time.\n But I was glad that there was still a group of adorable people by my side. With them by my side and loving me, I gradually became more cheerful and accepted this not beautiful but real me.\n Good morning, everyone.\n Image.jpg]\n After Song Ci posted on Weibo, she didn\u2019t care about the fans\u2019 comments anymore.\n Regardless of whether they were malicious insults or mocking her, they could no longer hurt Song Ci. Her greatest enemy had never been anyone else but herself.\n From the moment Song Ci recognized and accepted this imperfect self, she was already invincible.\n When Song Ci came downstairs, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t resist taking a few more glances at her.\n he was wearing a long red windbreaker today. The hem of the windbreaker was very wide and perfectly covered her big belly. Although she still looked fat, the red color made her look good. Her eyes were sparkling and exceptionally charming.\n Seeing that Han Zhan would still look at her in a daze, Song Ci felt slightly proud.\n After she was full, she took her bag and boarded the car with Han Zhan.\n Long Yu was driving when he saw Song Ci walking out of the house. He said sweetly, \u201cMadam is especially beautiful today.\u201d\n Long Yu and the rest had already received Mr. Han\u2019s instructions. In the future, when they saw Madam, they had to praise her every day for her good looks sincerely.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart melted at Long Yu\u2019s praise.\n After boarding the car, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, where are we going?\u201d\n Han Zhan still shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it mysterious.\u201d\n Seeing that she couldn\u2019t pry any information out of Han Zhan\u2019s shell, Song Ci turned on her cell phone and chatted with her friends on WeChat.\n She opened her WeChat and received a message from Liang Bo.\n Liang Bo sent a message: [Goddess, I saw your Weibo. I want to say that you are also very beautiful when she is pregnant. You\u2019re the most beautiful pregnant woman.]\n Liang Bo: [Goddess, I am holding a concert next year. Goddess, you must come!]\n Song Ci: [Congratulations, your concert dream has finally come true!]\n Receiving Song Ci\u2019s reply, Liang Bo added: [A lot of people have been guessing Cherry\u2019s identity recently.]\n Cherry was Song Ci\u2019s stage name. She and Liang Bo were fixed partners. Liang Bo had once brought Song Ci on a variety show with Wangdong City\u2019s Spring Festival Gala.\n It was just that in order not to reveal herself, Song Ci had been wearing a fox mask. As a result, everyone was curious about Liang Bo\u2019s arranger, Cherry.\n Liang Bo said: [Goddess, do you want to consider revealing yourself at my concert?]\n Song Ci: [Let me consider it.]\n Liang Bo: [Alright!]\n Song Ci thought: If I successfully slim down, I will take off my mask and reveal my identity. If I am still fat, I will never do it!\n Revealing oneself was a glorious moment. She had to look beautiful.\n Song Ci chatted a little more with Liang Bo before feeling sleepy. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep for a while.\u201d Yawning, Song Ci leaned against Han Zhan\u2019s shoulder and dozed off.\n The car was slightly bumpy, but Song Ci slept very soundly.\n \u201cBaby Ci, we are here.\u201d 40 minutes had already passed when Han Zhan woke her up.\n Song Ci opened her eyes and saw that their car was parked at the entrance of a large villa.\n Han Zhan alighted first, opened the car door, and pulled Song Ci out. Song Ci stood beside Han Zhan and looked up at the manor in front of her. Her heart suddenly thumped.\n Han Zhan actually brought her to Imperial Dragon Mountain!\n In her previous life, Imperial Dragon Mountain became the most respected land in Wangdong City because the richest man lived there.\n There were countless women in the country who wanted to live in this manor in front of her and become the mistress of the house. Unfortunately, Mr. Rich Man remained single his entire life.\n Song Ci had once seen an introduction to this luxurious manor in a magazine. It was designed by British architect Mai Kun.\n Mai Kun had also won another major architectural award for this work.\n The magazine said that the interior of this manor was extremely luxurious. The dome was beautiful and exquisite, and there was even an indoor fountain in the manor.\n In the interview, the richest man, Han Zhan, said that before building this house, he wanted to have children after getting married in the future so that it would be convenient for the children to play indoors. As a result, he built an indoor square.\n Not only was there an indoor fountain in the manor, there was also an indoor baby swimming pool. At the back of the manor, there was a suburban horse farm and a children\u2019s playground. There were roller coasters, carousels, ferris wheels...\n Han Zhan had built an amusement park for his children, but he never had children in his life.\n Song Ci looked up the hill and saw a ferris wheel being built.\n Seeing that Song Ci had discovered that ferris wheel, Han Zhan said, \u201cI made that for you.\u201d\n \u201cFor me?\u201d Song Ci was slightly shocked.\n Han Zhan acknowledged and said, \u201cI heard a legend related to you.\u201d\n A legend related to me?\n Song Ci was slightly stunned. She asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat legend?\u201d\n \u201cI heard that when you were 20 years old, the Dongfang Family\u2019s Third Young Master wooed you and invited you to take the ferris wheel. You weren\u2019t interested in that Third Young Master then and rejected him. Then, someone said that the top debutante was arrogant and looked down on the person who invited her to take the ferris wheel. She wanted to marry a rich person who was willing to build a ferris wheel for her.\u201d\n With that, Han Zhan asked Song Ci in amusement, \u201cIs the legend true?\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n She felt slightly awkward.\n \u201cSince you said that it was a legend, it must be fake.\u201d Song Ci explained the misunderstanding to Han Zhan. She said, \u201cThird Young Master is a year younger than me. He lost a bet with someone and wooed me according to the bet.\u201d\n \u201cThey bet that if Third Young Master managed to woo me, they would give him 10 million yuan. Third Young Master and I already knew each other. I was also vain and loved handsome guys then. After all, I was young. He asked me out and I went.\u201d\n \u201cBut on the way to the appointment, I received a message from Mu Qiu. Mu Qiu reminded me that Third Young Master was pursuing me to fulfill the bet. When we arrived at the amusement park, Third Young Master told him that he had reserved the entire ferris wheel for me to play alone.\u201d\n \u201cI was angry then and said in a fit of pique, \u2018What\u2019s the big deal about treating me to a Ferris wheel? If you have the capabilities, build me a Ferris wheel.\u2019\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s ears turned red as she spoke. She felt very embarrassed. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it became the version that you know.\u201d\n Hearing her explanation, Han Zhan smiled. \u201cSince the rumors have already been formed, I have to confirm them.\u201d\n He had to show everyone that Song Ci was really married to a man who was willing to build a private Ferris wheel for her!\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "232": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-233\n\n Chapter 232: Song Ci Is About to Give Birth Prematurely  Hugging Song Ci, Han Zhan rested his chin on top of her head and told her, \u201cBaby Ci, when the ferris wheel is completed, come with me. I want to bring you to stand at the highest point of Imperial Dragon Mountain to see this city.\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, Song Ci\u2019s entire body warmed up.\n Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s hand and walked towards the manor.\n As he walked, he introduced. \u201cThis mountain was given to me by Godmother Mo Yao when I was of age.\u201d\n Song Ci was not surprised to hear that this mountain was given to him by Mo Yao. \u201cGodmother treats you so well.\u201d\n \u201cThey only have me as their godson. Of course they like me.\u201d\n Jin Luolan was busy with her career and had never given birth. As Di Rongrong had lost a child, she was traumatized by pregnancy and didn\u2019t have any children.\n Mo Yao wanted to have a child but was unsuccessful. Han Zhan was their only son. How could they not love him?\n Ever since he was found by his grandfather, Han Zhan had been pampered since he was young.\n When Han Zhan was 18 years old, which was 2006, the local housing prices were not as crazy as they were now, but the land was still valuable.\n She gave Han Zhan a mountain the moment she made a move. Mo Yao\u2019s godmother really doted on Han Zhan.\n Song Ci pretended to be angry and questioned Han Zhan. \u201cYou actually secretly built a manor behind my back. When did you start building it?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cWhen Mrs. Mu was still alive, I hired someone to design this house.\u201d\n So early?\n Han Zhan explained. \u201cDo you still remember? After Madam Mu got pregnant, she fell on the stairs and suffered a major hemorrhage. She suffered a miscarriage and nearly lost her life. At that time, I decided to change to a bigger house, the kind where you need an elevator to bring you up and down.\u201d\n There were also several real estate development companies in Wangdong City that built several large villas with elevators. Han Zhan went to take a look but was not satisfied.\n Since he couldn\u2019t find anything satisfactory, he had no choice but to hire someone to design it himself.\n Han Zhan told Song Ci, \u201cOur previous duplex is getting smaller and there will be two more cubs soon. We won\u2019t be able to stay in that house anymore. It will be complete before the new year and the new house will be vacant for another year. We will move in here before the new year.\u201d\n Han Zhan felt rather regretful. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re about to give birth and the house has just been built.\u201d\n Song Ci stared at her big tummy. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. If we change to a bigger house, the children will have a place to play in the future. Moreover, we are still young. Who can guarantee that we won\u2019t have a second pregnancy in the future?\u201d\n \u201cThat will depend on you.\u201d Han Zhan had a lot of assets. Even if Song Ci had enough children to form a football team, Han Zhan could groom them into talents.\n But the body was Song Ci\u2019s. Whether she was willing to have another child or not, he had to respect Song Ci\u2019s thoughts.\n The tight door rumbled open.\n Song Ci looked up and saw a guitar-shaped fountain square.\n Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s hand as they entered the manor.\n Song Ci stood in front of the fountain square and sized up the scenery of the manor.\n To the left of the fountain was the garden and leisure area, while to the right was an artificial lake. It would take three to four minutes to walk from the main entrance of the manor to the main building.\n The building was three stories high and had two curved staircases on both sides of the building, leading from the first floor to the second.\n Han Zhan led Song Ci into the main hall on the first floor.\n Once inside, Song Ci was stunned by the circular dome hall that was 10 meters tall.\n She looked up at the circular dome above her.\n The dome was designed to be made of semi-transparent glass. It was brightly lit during the day, as if it was completely isolated.\n Countless stars filled with the top of the glass.\n Seeing Song Ci staring at those stars in a daze, Han Zhan told her, \u201cThose stars have the effect of absorbing light. At night, they will light up. At that time, when you look up, it will look like you are looking at the summer night sky.\u201d\n Song Ci was stunned.\n It turned out that the reports in the magazines were all true. Han Zhan\u2019s mansion really had a starry dome hall that was as beautiful and exquisite as a Western church.\n Han Zhan snapped his fingers.\n Above the dome, an arc-shaped barrier suddenly rose, which blocked out the daylight.\n The door behind the two of them was also closed. The originally bright hall was instantly plunged into night.\n Han Zhan\u2019s melodious voice sounded beside Song Ci\u2019s ear. \u201cBaby Ci, look up.\u201d\n Song Ci looked up obediently.\n Looking up, Song Ci saw the galaxy. The galaxy was reflected on the dome and was unbelievably beautiful.\n Those stars were still blinking.\n Song Ci was suffocating. In front of the absolute beauty, Song Ci was at a loss for words. She said, \u201cOh my god, it\u2019s too beautiful.\u201d\n Han Zhan chuckled and told her, \u201cThis is my inspiration. I told the designer and he added it.\u201d\n Under the starlight, Han Zhan suddenly bent over to Song Ci, stretched out his right hand, and invited her like an elegant gentleman.\n \u201cMrs. Han, are you willing to dance with me?\u201d\n Holding back her laughter, Song Ci placed her left hand on Han Zhan\u2019s palm.\n Han Zhan placed his other hand on Song Ci\u2019s waist. With a big belly, Song Ci danced a waltz under the starlight.\n After dancing, Han Zhan cupped Song Ci\u2019s face with both hands.\n He kissed Song Ci\u2019s lips.\n After the kiss, Han Zhan suddenly mentioned, \u201cBaby Ci, do you still remember what happened at your birthday party? That day, you walked past the crowd, brushed past them, and walked straight up to me. You smiled at me, your eyes were shining brightly, and I saw stars in your eyes.\u201d\n At that time, Han Zhan felt that Song Ci\u2019s eyes were even more mesmerizing than the stars. So when the designer asked him for the design theme of the dome, Han Zhan told him without thinking that he wanted the galaxy of stars in Song Ci\u2019s eyes.\n Hearing this, Song Ci\u2019s heart thumped wildly.\n She could gradually feel Han Zhan\u2019s body temperature rising and the heat in his eyes was very hot. Song Ci hurriedly released Han Zhan and reminded him. \u201cHan Zhan, I will give birth in a month. Don\u2019t mess around.\u201d\n \u201cSorry.\u201d\n Han Zhan snapped his fingers and the entire room was lit up.\n He hurriedly turned and went to the washroom. After a while, he walked out. When he came out, there were traces of cold water on Han Zhan\u2019s face.\n The two of them exchanged glances and suppressed their laughter.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll bring you somewhere else.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n The two of them finished touring the first floor and took the lift to the second.\n In the lift, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cHow much did this house cost?\u201d She was a layman and only cared about money.\n Han Zhan said a number.\n Song Ci was speechless and roared in her heart: So extravagant!\n Song Ci was agitated.\n Thinking back to when she lived in the countryside with her parents, she felt very blissful because the houses in the countryside were more western than those in the other houses in the village.\n After moving into the city, Song Ci felt very proud when all the neighbours gathered around to see that her family had bought a ten thousand dollar Sony television.\n After that, she was adopted by the Mu Family. The first time she moved into that three-story villa, Song Ci felt like a wild chicken that had entered a phoenix\u2019s nest.\n On the first night after entering the Mu Family residence, Song Ci laid in bed and couldn\u2019t sleep well.\n But now, she had become the mistress of this huge manor!\n For the first time, she deeply experienced the joy of being the wife of the richest man. It was the feeling of walking on clouds.\n It felt so good to be rich.\n She could already predict that the first week after moving into her new home, she would definitely be so excited that she wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep.\n Han Zhan brought Song Ci to visit the other rooms and facilities in the house. In the end, they arrived at the master bedroom.\n The master bedroom was fully open. A custom-made King-Size bed frame was leaning against the wall, and a glass French window was on the right.\n Song Ci walked up to the French window and realized that standing there, she could see the entire Great Dragon River.\n In the winter, there was not much water stored in the Imperial Dragon Abyss. The river was calm and the mountains and rivers were fine.\n Han Zhan stood side by side with her. He pointed at a building on the river in the distance. \u201cThat\u2019s the Imperial Dragon Building.\u201d\n Song Ci looked over and saw the Imperial Dragon Building standing on the river. Its tall dragon head roared at the sky in awe.\n Song Ci said, \u201cIn the future, when you go to work, the child and I can see you at home.\u201d\n Song Ci thought of something and suddenly said, \u201cLet\u2019s put a pair of binoculars here. When the children miss their father, they will be able to peek at you.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIsn\u2019t a WeChat video more convenient?\u201d\n Song Ci rolled her eyes at Han Zhan, despising him for being unromantic. She said, \u201cThis is called romance, do you understand?\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t understand why Song Ci\u2019s suggestion was romantic, but he knew that he couldn\u2019t refute Song Ci\u2019s point of view at this point.\n Han Zhan nodded obediently and agreed with Song Ci\u2019s opinion. \u201cYou make a lot of sense.\u201d\n The two of them stood by the window for a while before Song Ci turned and walked into the bathroom.\n A carved screen was used as a partition between the bathroom and the master bedroom. The left side was the bathtub, the right side was the shower room, and there were two sinks in the middle. Beside the washroom was the toilet.\n The corridor in the middle was very wide and there was a incense table. On the table was a 50cm tall jade statue.\n Song Ci stared at that jade statue in astonishment.\n \u201cIs this me?\u201d\n A slender woman was sculpted on the white jade.\n She was wearing an open-back dress with long hair and a fox mask. She was playing the violin.\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s words, Han Zhan hurried over.\n Gazing at that small statue, Han Zhan nodded and said, \u201cThis is your outfit when you and Liang Bo went on Wangdong TV Station\u2019s Spring Festival Gala together.\u201d\n That night, Han Zhan sat below the stage and admired Song Ci\u2019s beauty with the audience.\n At that time, he thought that he must get someone to carve Song Ci\u2019s beauty into time.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Song Ci was praising herself, but she didn\u2019t know if she was praising herself for being beautiful or if it was a work carved by a craftsman.\n Song Ci lovingly stroked that statue a few times. She smiled and teased Han Zhan. \u201cBrother Han, come, I\u2019ll let you touch me when my figure is sexy.\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head and chuckled. \u201cStop fooling around.\u201d\n Although the statue was beautiful, the person beside him was where his heart lay.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go to the back of the mountain to take a look.\u201d\n Han Zhan personally drove the tour bus in the manor and brought Song Ci to visit the lawn, the training grounds, and the horse farm in the backyard.\n In the end, they arrived at the amusement park on the hill behind.\n Song Ci looked up at the white Ferris wheel. She shook her head, grabbed a tree beside her, and refused to leave.\n Han Zhan thought she was tired and said, \u201cLet me carry you.\u201d Han Zhan\u2019s arms were strong and even if Song Ci had gained weight, he could easily carry her horizontally.\n Song Ci reached out and placed her hand by Han Zhan\u2019s mouth, despising his noisy words. \u201cBrother Han, shut up. Let me experience the joy of being a rich lady.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n \u2013\n It was already noon by the time they finished touring the manor.\n Han Zhan brought Song Ci to a farm at the foot of the Imperial Dragon Mountain for dinner.\n After dinner, Han Zhan received a call from Han Aoyu. He said that an old friend had sent a few quails over for them for dinner.\n Song Ci had never eaten a quail in her life.\n Han Zhan drove Song Ci back to his grandfather\u2019s place and went back to the office, before coming back for dinner at night.\n Han Aoyu was relieved to see that Song Ci\u2019s smile widened and that her depression should have improved.\n Han Aoyu covered the quail with a bamboo frame and didn\u2019t kill it.\n Due to the previous epidemic, Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to eat wild animals anymore. She asked Han Aoyu, \u201cAre quails a protected animal, Grandpa?\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat protected animals. If you eat venison now and are found out, you will be fined and sent to jail.\u201d Song Ci was a law-abiding citizen and would never do anything illegal.\n Han Aoyu didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n He liked Song Ci\u2019s obedience and cuteness.\n Han Aoyu saw that Song Ci was slightly anxious and said, \u201cThis is a quail raised in one\u2019s own home. It\u2019s raised in the mountains and not wild. There\u2019s no virus either. You can eat it without worry. Moreover, do you think I would dare to give you food that can\u2019t be eaten?\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci finally relaxed.\n This time, Zhong Buhui walked out with a kitchen knife in his hand. He saw Song Ci standing beside the bamboo frame and hurriedly said, \u201cLittle Song, I am going to kill a living thing. Please excuse me.\u201d\n Not only was Song Ci unwilling to avoid him, she even said eagerly, \u201cI like to pluck fur. Uncle Zhong, kill them and let me pluck them.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui was speechless.\n It was hard to tell that this delicate beauty actually loved to pluck bird feathers.\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n After Zhong Buhui killed the quail, Grandpa brought over water and placed it in the bucket to heat for a few minutes, before letting Song Ci pluck its feathers.\n Song Ci stood by the stone table in the garden and placed the basin containing the quail on the table. She grabbed it and felt very good.\n After cleaning the quail fur, Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist taking a photo to show off to Yan Jiang about eating quails tonight.\n Yan Jiang sent a drooling emoticon.\n But he had to go to work and couldn\u2019t go to Grandfather\u2019s house to freeload.\n Han Zhan would only reach home at 7.30pm. Zhong Buhui was worried that it would be cold if he made quails early and affect the taste of the food, so he decided to postpone dinner.\n Song Ci was rather hungry at 4pm, so Zhong Buhui made her a plate of tri-colored fried rice.\n After Song Ci finished her meal, she received a voice call from Su Huanyan.\n Why is Su Huanyan calling me now?\n Song Ci answered the call and heard Su Huanyan\u2019s sweet voice. \u201cSong Ci, are you still staying with Grandpa?\u201d\n \u201cI happened to be here today.\u201d\n Only then did Su Huanyan say, \u201cI am now at the old residence of the Cheng Family. My mother came to visit me a few days ago and brought me some specialties from Su City. I thought of how you said you liked Su City\u2019s delicacies, so I wanted to give you some and was prepared to send them to you sometime.\u201d\n \u201cSince you happen to be at Grandpa\u2019s side, shall I look for you?\u201d\n Song Ci replied, \u201cOkay!\u201d\n After hanging up, Song Ci told Han Aoyu, \u201cGrandpa, Cheng Yanmo\u2019s wife is coming soon. Did we cook enough food? I want to keep her for dinner.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s more than enough!\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Song Ci waited at the door for a while before seeing Su Huanyan.\n Su Huanyan looked like a gentle lady, but this lady was very brave. She was more than 7 months pregnant and still drove very well.\n After parking the car outside the Han residence, Su Huanyan alighted. She was wearing flat shoes and a long blue down jacket. Her stomach was slightly bigger than the last time she met Song Ci.\n Although they were both pregnant, Su Huanyan still looked slender and only had a baby bump.\n Song Ci stared at Su Huanyan\u2019s slender arms and legs, feeling extremely jealous.\n God is not giving me a way out.\n \u201cSong Ci, come and help me carry it.\u201d\n Song Ci hurried over and saw many gifts placed at the back of the row. Song Ci was slightly shocked. \u201cSo many?\u201d\n Su Huanyan smiled and said frankly, \u201cYour grandfather is here. I can\u2019t possibly meet him empty-handed, right?\u201d\n Su Huanyan patted the beautifully packaged Biluo Chun on her seat. She said, \u201cI heard from Yanmo that your grandfather likes to drink tea. This Biluo Chun of mine is one of my grandfather\u2019s treasures when he was alive. Now that he is gone, it\u2019s better to give it to someone else than to keep this.\u201d\n \u201cThen I\u2019ll thank you on behalf of Grandpa.\u201d\n The two of them entered the house carrying bags.\n Han Aoyu saw that Su Huanyan was carrying a few big bags and walked over with a smile. He asked Su Huanyan, \u201cLittle Lass Su is here to send warmth to Song Ci. What about Grandpa, do I have a share?\u201d\n \u201cGrandpa, how can I not have yours?\u201d Faced with Han Aoyu\u2019s teasing, Su Huanyan also appeared magnanimous. She handed the Biluo Chun to Han Aoyu and said, \u201cGrandpa, smell this tea and see if you like it.\u201d\n Han Aoyu took out a small box from the bag, opened the lid, and smelled the fragrance of top-grade Biluochun.\n Han Aoyu smiled. \u201cGood stuff! Eat at my place tonight. There are quails. Your Uncle Zhong is very good at cooking. You will definitely like them.\u201d\n It was difficult to refuse such a grand offer, so Su Huanyan agreed.\n Su Huanyan brought Song Ci the delicacies from Zhizhi Temple and the Great Lake Silverfish.\n Song Ci had previously revealed to Su Huanyan that she loved to drink silver fish soup. Presumably knowing that her mother was coming, Su Huanyan had told her mother in advance and asked her to bring silver fish over.\n It was not very expensive, but it was very kind of her to do so.\n Song Ci was slightly touched. Su Huanyan had given her specialties, but she didn\u2019t have anything suitable for her. She thought about when she should get something sincere for Su Huanyan.\n The two of them chatted for a while before the sky turned dark.\n During this time, Cheng Yanmo called her. The two of them were like a pair of business partners, respectful and polite, as they took turns to talk and answer questions.\n Everything was good, just not like a married couple.\n Song Ci had no say in their lives. She listened quietly, feeling very emotional.\n After hanging up, Su Huanyan saw Song Ci staring at her curiously. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s Yanmo. Every night, if he works overtime, he will call and ask about me and the child.\u201d Perhaps there was no love between the two of them, but there was kinship.\n \u201cHe is a good husband.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n Han Zhan returned very quickly and was slightly surprised to see Su Huanyan at home.\n \u201cMr. Han.\u201d\n \u201cMrs. Cheng.\u201d\n Su Huanyan greeted Han Zhan and continued chatting with Song Ci.\n After dinner, Su Huanyan bid farewell.\n Seeing that it was getting late, Han Aoyu said, \u201cBuhui, send Su Lass back. It\u2019s not safe to drive alone at night, especially on such a mountain road.\u201d The reason why he called Zhong Buhui to send Su Huanyan instead of Han Zhan was also to avoid arousing suspicion.\n Zhong Buhui was about to get up when Han Zhan stood up first. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Afraid that Song Ci would let her imagination run wild again, Han Zhan asked Song Ci gently, \u201cBaby Ci, are you coming with me?\u201d\n Song Ci would guard against anyone but Cheng Yanmo\u2019s pregnant wife.\n She shook her head. \u201cGo ahead. Come back right after.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Zhan then drove his car and sent Su Huanyan home.\n Su Huanyan sat in the passenger seat. She stroked her own tummy and chatted with Han Zhan.\n \u201cSong Ci is giving birth soon, right?\u201d\n \u201cJust next month.\u201d\n Han Zhan knew that it would be awkward for Su Huanyan to be alone with him, so he found a topic.\n After Su Huanyan fell silent, Han Zhan also said, \u201cMiss Cheng, you\u2019re going into labor in two months, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes, I\u2019m about 20 days later than Song Ci.\u201d\n \u201cYou two are really fated. You even have children together.\u201d\n Hearing this, Su Huanyan smiled ruefully. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s fate. There are so many well-bred young ladies in Wangdong City, but I can only get along with her.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled meaningfully.\n Su Huanyan felt that Han Zhan\u2019s smile was somewhat strange.\n But she didn\u2019t ask further, afraid that she might have misunderstood.\n The car stopped at the entrance of the Cheng residence. Su Huanyan wanted to open the car door but realized that it was locked. Su Huanyan realized that something was off and moved her hand away from the handle.\n u Huanyan turned and looked at Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan\u2019s jawline was very tight and his eyes were extremely cold.\n Su Huanyan was slightly stunned and felt uneasy.\n Su Huanyan felt offended. She said coldly, \u201cMr. Han, what do you mean?\u201d\n At the entrance of the Cheng Family residence, Su Huanyan didn\u2019t believe that Han Zhan would dare to do anything to her and spoke rather confidently.\n Han Zhan\u2019s gloved right hand stroked the joystick slowly. He suddenly said, \u201cMiss Su and our Song Ci can get along together. Is it because you two are compatible in character? Or is there another reason?\u201d\n Su Huanyan was slightly surprised that Han Zhan would say such a thing.\n Su Huanyan took a deep breath and said, \u201cRegardless of whether Mr. Han believes me or not, I don\u2019t have any ill intentions towards Song Ci. I admire her talent and character very much and just want to be friends with her. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can check on my background.\u201d\n As Han Aoyu\u2019s grandson, it would be easy for Han Zhan to find out more about Su Huanyan.\n Han Zhan smiled. \u201cLooks like I misunderstood.\u201d\n Su Huanyan looked at Han Zhan\u2019s smile and didn\u2019t feel relieved. Instead, she felt even more uneasy.\n uddenly, Han Zhan said, \u201cI thought you were purposely getting close to our Song Ci because of Sicilio.\u201d\n That was the first time Su Huanyan heard someone mention Sicilio\u2019s name after returning to China.\n From the moment Han Zhan said the name Sicilio, Su Huanyan knew that she had no secrets or privacy in front of Han Zhan.\n That ridiculous relationship with Sicilio was Su Huanyan\u2019s secret.\n Even her family didn\u2019t know that she had once had an unforgettable love with a man in Italy.\n Every time she heard Sicilio\u2019s name, Su Huanyan\u2019s heart would ache.\n Gripping her seatbelt, she murmured. \u201cHow did you know about him?\u201d\n \u201cSicilio?\u201d Han Zhan chuckled. \u201cAs Sicilio\u2019s only girlfriend, haven\u2019t you heard him mention that he has a younger brother whose Chinese name is Han Zhan?\u201d\n Su Huanyan was slightly surprised. She said, \u201cYou are his younger brother called Hoff?\u201d\n \u201cIt looks like Sicilio really cares a lot about you.\u201d To be able to tell Su Huanyan about his family matters was enough to prove Su Huanyan\u2019s position in Sicilio\u2019s heart.\n A few months ago, Song Ci returned from Italy after filming. She told Han Zhan that she had met Sicilio in Italy and Han Zhan sent someone to investigate Sicilio\u2019s life over the years.\n Sicilio\u2019s days were very exciting. Every day, he lived like a shooting spy. The only surprising thing was that such a cold-hearted and heartless thing actually fell in love with a woman.\n But the heavens had opened their eyes. The woman he loved still left him in the end.\n Hearing Han Zhan say that Sicilio cared a lot about her, Su Huanyan only chuckled mockingly.\n Han Zhan said to Su Huanyan, \u201cYou saw Sicilio\u2019s mother, right?\u201d\n Su Huanyan hesitated before saying, \u201cIn the past, I accidentally saw Sicilio\u2019s photo album pendant and was fortunate enough to meet Mother Song.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at her deeply and asked, \u201cWas it really unintentional?\u201d\n Su Huanyan held her breath. After a long while, she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\n Very good. The gentle tulip gene mutated, revealing the essence of her being a tyrant.\n Han Zhan suddenly pressed the button to open the door.\n Hearing a click, Su Huanyan reached out and pushed open the car door.\n She was about to go down when she heard Han Zhan say, \u201cSu Huanyan, Song Ci treats you as a friend. I don\u2019t expect you to treat her sincerely, but don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d\n Su Huanyan alighted and turned her back to Han Zhan. She was in no hurry to leave.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIf you dare to hurt her, I will make your family pay the price.\u201d\n Su Huanyan chuckled and said mockingly, \u201cAs expected of brothers. The way you speak is exactly the same...\u201d After a pause, Su Huanyan added.\u201d It\u2019s equally nauseating. \u201d\n Su Huanyan was not afraid of offending Han Zhan.\n As the ex-girlfriend of a big boss, Su Huanyan was used to all sorts of major events and dangerous situations. Faced with Han Zhan\u2019s threat, she was really not afraid.\n Su Huanyan left after saying that.\n Han Zhan scrutinized that woman\u2019s arrogant back view. Actually, he somewhat believed Su Huanyan\u2019s words.\n \u2013\n Han Zhan returned home and was stopped by Song Ci at the door.\n Han Zhan looked at her in amusement and opened his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t have any hickeys or perfume. I didn\u2019t cheat on you. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n Only then did Song Ci smile.\n \u201cDon\u2019t joke around. I\u2019m not asking you this.\u201d Song Ci narrowed her eyes and stared into Han Zhan\u2019s eyes. She asked suspiciously, \u201cDid you talk to Huanyan behind my back?\u201d\n Otherwise, the troublesome and cold Han Zhan wouldn\u2019t have taken the initiative to send Su Huanyan home.\n Han Zhan felt somewhat helpless.\n \u201cWhy are you suddenly so smart?\u201d\n Song Ci was a very strange person. Sometimes, she looked like a little fool in a daze.\n But she was also very smart when it came to major matters. For example, Song Ci had seen through everything that happened tonight, as well as his collaboration with Song Fei to plot against Mu Mian.\n Song Ci closed the door behind her, crossed her arms, leaned against the door, and ordered Han Zhan, \u201cHurry up and tell me the truth. You\u2019re not allowed to enter the house unless you tell me clearly.\u201d\n It looked like he could only make a compromise.\n Han Zhan told her, \u201cSu Huanyan.\u201d\n \u201cMmm?\u201d\n \u201cShe was Sicilio\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d\n Song Ci was confused.\n Song Ci was still slightly confused when she suddenly heard Sicilio\u2019s name. Two seconds later, Song Ci recalled Sicilio\u2019s identity and was instantly stunned.\n \u201cHow can that be? Huanyan and Sicilio?\u201d\n Huanyan and my half-brother are a couple?\n This...\n Song Ci imagined Su Huanyan and Sicilio standing together. It was like a flower stuck in a cracked rock.\n It didn\u2019t fit.\n \u201cSo what did you tell her?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cSu Huanyan might be suspecting your relationship with Sicilio\u2019s mother. I\u2019m worried that she has ulterior motives for getting close to you, so I have to warn her.\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist saying, \u201cHuanyan is definitely a good lady. Believe me, my intuition is very accurate.\u201d\n Han Zhan couldn\u2019t resist pouring cold water on her. \u201cYou also thought Mu Qiu was a good sister in the past.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Song Ci felt like giving Han Zhan a good beating.\n She raised her little fist and was about to hit him when her stomach hurt.\n Song Ci hurriedly retracted her small fists and used her palms to hold her stomach. \u201cOuch!\u201d Song Ci touched her stomach and looked up at the nervous Han Zhan. \u201cMy stomach hurts a little.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed drastically. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re giving birth?\u201d But it\u2019s only been eight months!\n Song Ci reached out her right arm. \u201cQuick, help me to bed.\u201d\n Han Zhan carried Song Ci up by the waist.\n He carried Song Ci and hurried back to the room.\n After lying in bed for a while, Song Ci felt that her stomach didn\u2019t hurt anymore.\n She carefully felt her tummy and confirmed that it really didn\u2019t hurt anymore, before feeling at ease.\n Zhong Buhui followed him upstairs. Standing outside the door, he asked, \u201cZhanzhan, what happened to Song Ci? I saw you carrying her up just now. Is she feeling unwell?\u201d\n Just now, Han Zhan had carried Song Ci upstairs and scared Han Aoyu and Zhong Buhui.\n Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I might have had a cramp just now.\u201d\n Her stomach would cramp too?\n Only then did Han Zhan turn and walk to the corridor. He explained to Zhong Buhui, \u201cIt\u2019s alright now. Song Ci\u2019s stomach cramped just now. She\u2019s recovered now.\u201d\n \u201cYou scared us.\u201d\n Knowing that Song Ci was fine, Zhong Buhui went downstairs.\n Although Song Ci had said that she was fine, Han Zhan was still worried.\n He took a shower and didn\u2019t sleep. He just laid down and chatted with Song Ci. Every now and then, he would ask her if her stomach hurt.\n Song Ci had always said that it didn\u2019t hurt.\n At 10.40pm at night, Song Ci couldn\u2019t take it anymore and fell asleep.\n Han Zhan was relieved to see that she had fallen asleep.\n Not long after, Han Zhan was suddenly awoken by Song Ci.\n \u201cHan Zhan!\u201d Song Ci sounded very flustered.\n Han Zhan jolted awake and turned on the wall lamp immediately. He sat up and looked down at Song Ci.\n Seeing that Song Ci\u2019s face was red from anxiety, Han Zhan hurriedly asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Song Ci felt ashamed but still told Han Zhan, \u201cMy pants seem to be wet.\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned. \u201cYou peed?\u201d\n Some pregnant women would indeed have leakage when they reached the third trimester.\n Song Ci shook her head and said, \u201cNot really. I don\u2019t have the habit of urinating. I think...\u201d Song Ci looked uneasy.\u201d Han Zhan, could it be that my water broke? \u201d\n Song Ci could feel something flowing through her body.\n That gentleness didn\u2019t feel like urine.\n Han Zhan hurriedly pulled open the blanket and checked Song Ci\u2019s pants.\n The transparent liquid was not urine at all.\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed drastically!\n \u201cBaby Ci, don\u2019t be afraid. I will send you to the hospital now!\u201d\n Han Zhan immediately picked up the phone and called the hospital director to instruct the gynecologist to prepare for delivery and to get them to drive an ambulance to fetch Song Ci.\n After the call, Han Zhan carried Song Ci and was about to rush downstairs when Song Ci suddenly shouted, \u201cBrother Han, I didn\u2019t take the child\u2019s clothes!\u201d\n Han Zhan had already carried her to the stairwell.\n Hearing this, he shouted at the top of his lungs. \u201cUncle Zhong, Song Ci\u2019s amniotic fluid is broken. I will send her to the hospital. Help me send the children\u2019s belongings to the hospital. I have packed everything and placed them in our bedroom!\u201d\n As he shouted, Han Zhan had already rushed to the door.\n Han Zhan\u2019s commotion woke everyone up.\n Han Aoyu was awake, Zhong Buhui was also awake, and so was the guard who had just changed shifts.\n Han Aoyu didn\u2019t even bother putting on his outer jacket. He just put on a tight thermal jacket and rushed out of the room.\n He ran to the door and saw the taillights of Han Zhan\u2019s car sweeping past the corner of the wall. They quickly disappeared.\n Han Aoyu was so anxious that his hands were trembling slightly.\n Buhui, is that Song lass going to give birth soon?\u201d\n Zhong Buhui nodded with a grim expression.\n Han Aoyu exclaimed, \u201cHow can that do? It\u2019s only been eight months!\u201d\n Zhong Buhui said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s going into premature labor.\u201d\n Zhong Buhui didn\u2019t hear Han Zhan\u2019s urgent words clearly just now, but he could guess what Han Zhan was instructing.\n Zhong Buhui went upstairs and opened Han Zhan\u2019s room. He saw the box standing by the corner.\n Inside the box were the items that Song Ci had prepared in advance for her delivery.\n hong Buhui carried his things and ran downstairs. After Han Aoyu changed, he drove Han Aoyu to the hospital with the clothes.\n ...\n In the hospital.\n Song Ci had already entered the waiting room and the doctor was checking on her water rupture. Han Zhan stood in the room like an ant on a hot pan. He asked the doctor, \u201cDoctor Zhang, what\u2019s the situation with my wife now?\u201d\n Song Ci raised her lower limbs. Due to this sudden situation, her face was pale due to the fright.\n The doctor looked up and told Han Zhan, \u201cThe amniotic fluid is indeed broken, but there is no contraction yet. Let\u2019s do an ultrasound to check the amniotic fluid first. If it really doesn\u2019t work, we can only perform surgery to take out the child. Otherwise, if there is too little amniotic fluid, the child will suffocate.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "233": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-234\n\n Chapter 233: Birth of the Children, Han Miao, Han Jun  The doctor immediately performed an ultrasound scan on Song Ci\u2019s stomach, as the device kept moving around Song Ci\u2019s womb.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan both looked at the screen and could clearly see the children.\n As for how much amniotic fluid there was, Song Ci and Han Zhan didn\u2019t understand, as they weren\u2019t medical students.\n After the doctor finished his checkup, he asked Han Zhan, \u201cThe membrane has indeed been ruptured. How long has it been since the amniotic fluid was discovered?\u201d\n Han Zhan replied, \u201cOver an hour.\u201d\n \u201cThen you guys discovered it quite timely.\u201d\n \u201cAn early rupture of the membrane is a rather serious situation. It can easily cause the umbilical cord to fall off and cause infection in the baby\u2019s womb. The children are already eight months old. If Madam has a contraction reaction, it will be best if she can deliver naturally. If there is no contraction after more than 12 hours, we will consider a cesarean section. After all, the children are very healthy. Their lives will not be in danger if they are carefully taken care of.\u201d\n \u201cThe longer the fetus stays in Madam\u2019s body, the higher the risk of infection and the greater the threat.\u201d\n After explaining the pros and cons, the doctor asked Han Zhan and Song Ci, \u201cMr. Han, Madam, consider whether to perform a cesarean section to remove the baby or wait for a few hours to see if there\u2019s any contraction.\u201d\n In other words, she could either perform a cesarean section to remove the baby in advance, or wait a few more hours to see if she had contractions and if Song Ci could give birth on her own.\n While waiting, it is also possible that the umbilical cord will fall off or too much amniotic fluid will suffocate the child.\n Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm and said decisively, \u201cI want a C-section!\u201d\n Hearing the word \u201ccut\u201d, Han Zhan\u2019s scalp went numb.\n He felt terrified at the thought that the doctor would use a knife to cut Song Ci\u2019s stomach.\n The doctor also said, \u201cC-section is the best way.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at Song Ci.\n Song Ci\u2019s eyes were filled with determination. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve already persevered for too long for them. Han Zhan, I can\u2019t take the risk of losing them.\u201d\n Han Zhan clenched his fists and nodded. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do the surgery.\u201d\n The doctor hurriedly arranged for someone to prepare for the surgery. With Han Zhan\u2019s help, Song Ci changed into a patient gown.\n At this moment, a nurse walked in with a bag of baby products. There were small clothes, a small towel, and a mat for the pregnant woman.\n The nurse stood at the end of the bed and said to Song Ci, \u201cMadam, your family has already come over and sent the children\u2019s and your things over.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d\n After the nurse left, Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s hand and told her, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I will always be by your side.\u201d\n How could Song Ci not be afraid?\n She was only 23 years old and had never undergone surgery. She was scared to death.\n Song Ci\u2019s fingers were trembling and her hands were cold. But she still forced a smile and comforted Han Zhan instead. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, once the anesthesia hits, I won\u2019t know anything. When I wake up, you will definitely be by my side and tell me: Song Ci, our daughters are all safe.\u201d\n Han Zhan forced a smile and nodded. \u201cYes, I will be by your side, always by your side.\u201d\n The anesthesiologist rushed over from home to the operating theater. The moment he entered, he asked about Song Ci\u2019s weight and other information before preparing the anesthetic.\n The surgery was about to start and Song Ci couldn\u2019t help letting her imagination run wild.\n She was afraid that if she closed her eyes, she would never have the chance to open them again.\n A few minutes before the surgery, Song Ci couldn\u2019t resist saying her last words to Han Zhan.\n Holding Han Zhan\u2019s hand tightly, Song Ci told him, \u201cHan Zhan, if I don\u2019t make it this time but the children survive, you must promise me one thing.\u201d\n Han Zhan instinctively stopped her from spouting nonsense. \u201cDon\u2019t say such nonsense. You will be fine.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me!\u201d Song Ci grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s wrist, stared at him fixedly, and said, \u201cIf I die, you definitely can\u2019t find a stepmother for our child! With a stepmother, there will be a stepfather. I can\u2019t bear for the children I exchanged my life for to be bullied by your vixen!\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n He felt amused and angry at the same time.\n \u201cYou won\u2019t die. Believe me.\u201d\n The medical skills were very advanced now and it was not difficult to perform a C-section. If Su Beibei could survive that dangerous situation, Song Ci would definitely be fine.\n Song Ci only wanted Han Zhan to make a promise. \u201cPromise me! Anyway, you must promise me that you will never find a stepmother for our child!\u201d\n Song Ci was not a magnanimous woman. Other women only wanted their men to be happy before dying, but Song Ci was not.\n She couldn\u2019t wait for Han Zhan to remember her forever!\n Han Zhan saw that the anesthesiologist had come over and knew that if he didn\u2019t give an accurate answer, Song Ci would probably not let him off. Han Zhan hurriedly nodded and said, \u201cOkay, okay, I promise you.\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s agreement, Song Ci finally allowed the anesthesiologist to administer anesthesia.\n As the anesthesia entered her body, Song Ci\u2019s consciousness was still very clear at the start. She even said to Han Zhan, \u201cHan Zhan, I feel that television and novels are all lies. They always act the kind of plot where a person will lose consciousness immediately after being injected with a drug. Look, I\u2019ve been injected with general anesthesia and my consciousness is still clear...\u201d\n In order to reassure Song Ci, Han Zhan praised her. \u201cIs that so? That must be because you are a determined person.\u201d\n Song Ci was slightly smug. She said, \u201cOf course. I don\u2019t just gain weight when I eat. I also gain courage...\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, Song Ci slowly closed her eyes.\n Han Zhan pushed her shoulder and called out, \u201cBaby Ci.\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201c...Mmm.\u201d\n After a few seconds, Han Zhan shouted again, \u201cSong Ci.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n There was no reaction.\n The anesthetist was amused. \u201cYour wife is quite interesting.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked the anesthesiologist, \u201cIs my wife\u2019s condition serious?\u201d\n \u201cThis is nothing. At most, this is considered a premature delivery. I have seen countless pregnant women in the Gynecology Department. This is a small problem for your wife. Don\u2019t worry, after the surgery, I will definitely return you a lively wife and two babies crying loudly.\u201d\n Hearing the anesthetist\u2019s words, Han Zhan felt slightly more at ease.\n Song Ci\u2019s bed was pushed into the operating theater.\n The chief surgeon was the director of the Gynecology Department. He picked up the knife, glanced at Han Zhan, and said to him warningly, \u201cMr. Han, I am going to start the surgery now. I hope you will cooperate with me and not disturb me.\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded without answering.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart quivered as he watched the doctor cut open Song Ci\u2019s stomach.\n It was not that he had never seen killing before. He had also used a knife to cut an enemy\u2019s neck. He was not afraid of pain or others\u2019 pain, but he was afraid of Song Ci\u2019s pain.\n There were many layers to a person\u2019s skin structure, but the doctor\u2019s scalpel was especially sharp. With just a gentle press, Song Ci\u2019s belly was sliced open.\n The incision was made horizontally and someone immediately dabbed the blood with a sterile cotton cloth.\n Han Zhan watched as the assistant reached into Song Ci\u2019s abdomen. A minute later, the doctor successfully retrieved a child.\n The twins were already smaller than single babies. Moreover, Song Ci had given birth prematurely. That child was pitifully small.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart trembled slightly when he saw his elder daughter.\n The nurse hurriedly hugged the child with a towel and patted her buttocks. The child let out a soft cry like a wild cat.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart thumped when he heard the child\u2019s cries. He was indescribably touched.\n The nurse was busy checking the child\u2019s body and weighing it up. Meanwhile, the assistant continued to deliver the second child.\n Han Zhan looked at the nurse\u2019s desk and saw that the nurse had placed the child on the weighing board. He turned and said, \u201cCongratulations, Mr. Han. The child is very healthy and weighs 3.4 catties.\u201d\n Han Zhan frowned at the mention of 3.4 catties.\n Can this small thing really survive?\n At this point, the assistant had already successfully retrieved the second baby girl.\n ]Upon seeing this child, the assistant exclaimed. \u201cThis girl is more domineering and more muscular.\u201d\n Hearing this, Han Zhan looked at that child born a few minutes later.\n As expected, this little girl was slightly fleshy and had a little meat on her little arms. She was slightly more muscular than the little baby girl from before.\n Han Zhan made a prompt decision. \u201cThe one born after is the elder sister.\u201d Anyway, they were both born on the same day. Whoever looked stronger would be the elder sister.\n The nurse took over the elder sister and carried her over for a checkup. She took the girl\u2019s weight, before turning to Han Zhan with a smile. \u201cMr. Han, the eldest daughter weighs 4.5kg and is very healthy.\u201d\n Han Zhan acknowledged and didn\u2019t look at the child much. He turned back and frowned as the doctor retrieved Song Ci\u2019s placenta.\n ...\n The surgery went smoothly.\n Outside the operating theater, Han Aoyu and Zhong Buhui waited anxiously.\n Han Aoyu was very anxious and his feet kept trembling gently on the ground.\n By the time Song Fei and Yan Jiang arrived at the hospital, Song Ci\u2019s surgery had already ended.\n Han Zhan personally sent the two little princesses out.\n Seeing Han Zhan come out, the four people waiting outside the operating theater immediately stood up and rushed over.\n Han Aoyu asked, \u201cAre the children alright? Where\u2019s Song Ci? Is she alright?\u201d\n Song Fei and Yan Jiang asked, \u201cHow is Song Ci?\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at them and didn\u2019t finish his sentence.\n The four of them immediately fell silent.\n Only then did Han Zhan say, \u201cSong Ci\u2019s surgery went very smoothly. Now that the surgery is over, we just need to wait for the anesthesia to clear up. As the two children are still young from premature labor, their organs are not fully developed yet. They need to be sent to the pediatric incubator.\u201d\n The doctor said that if they were not short of money, it would be best to let the child grow to six catties in the incubator before discharge.\n What Han Zhan didn\u2019t lack the most was money. For the sake of the children\u2019s health, he would naturally let them grow up in the incubator.\n As a result, the group of them sent the two little guys to the pediatric sterile ward.\n As he watched the nurse carry the child away, Han Aoyu couldn\u2019t help but say worriedly, \u201cThere are so many children inside. Could our child have been carried wrongly?\u201d\n Glancing at Han Zhan, Han Aoyu said, \u201cAfter your grandmother got old, she loved to watch television dramas where they took the wrong child.\u201d This made Han Aoyu resent the hospital for carrying the wrong child.\n Hearing Old Master\u2019s words, the nurse hurriedly said, \u201cOld Master, what nonsense are you talking about? Every baby has their identification card on their hands. There will not be any mistake!\u201d\n With that, the nurse carried the child in.\n Han Aoyu felt rather embarrassed to be lectured by a young lady.\n Han Aoyu rubbed his nose, walked to a chair, sat down, and sighed. \u201cThat little guy is so small. I feel like she\u2019s only the size of two palms. How can that be good? In the future, even if you let me hug her, I won\u2019t dare to reach out.\u201d\n Actually, Han Aoyu wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t dare to carry the child. Previously, when the nurse let Han Zhan carry the child, his arms were as stiff as two rocks.\n Han Aoyu was already old and staying up late was very harmful to his health. Han Zhan got his grandfather to go upstairs to the director\u2019s lounge to lie down for a while.\n Han Aoyu still refused. He said, \u201cI have to wait for Song Lass to come out. If she doesn\u2019t see me when she comes out, she might let her imagination run wild and think that Grandpa doesn\u2019t love her anymore!\u201d\n Due to Song Ci\u2019s previous depression, Old Master doted on her and was afraid of doing something that would make Song Ci depressed.\n Hearing this, Song Fei and Yan Jiang\u2019s hearts warmed.\n Song Ci had truly married the right person in this life.\n Seeing that he couldn\u2019t convince his grandfather, Han Zhan could only hold his grandfather\u2019s arm and return to the operating theater.\n Song Ci finally woke up at dawn. At that time, she was unconscious.\n As she was pushed out of the operating theater by the nurses, she squinted at the lights and felt uneasy.\n Only when her hand was tightly wrapped by a large hand with calluses did Song Ci blurt out, \u201cHan Zhan...\u201d\n In her daze, Song Ci heard Han Zhan grunt. Following that, her hand was kissed.\n Song Ci heard another unyielding male voice interrupt. He said, \u201cSong Lass, you\u2019re not kind. Han Zhan isn\u2019t the only one waiting for you. My legs were so scared by you tonight that I stayed up with them the entire night. You only remember your Brother Han when you woke up and don\u2019t remember your grandfather?\u201d\n Song Ci thought: Who is this old guy?\n How talkative.\n Song Ci was sent back to the ward and really wanted to sleep, but there were people talking beside her ear. Not only did they talk, they even called her every now and then. If Song Ci didn\u2019t say anything, they would lean over to her ear and continue calling her.\n Song Ci could only acknowledge repeatedly.\n After a few hours, the din finally stopped.\n As for Song Ci, she had also fallen asleep.\n When she woke up again, Song Ci opened her eyes and saw a black buzz cut lying beside her bed.\n Song Ci turned again and saw two people sleeping on the sofa. It was Song Fei and Yan Jiang.\n Song Ci felt satisfied the moment she woke up and saw her family.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d\n Hearing Song Ci\u2019s voice, Han Zhan looked up.\n Seeing that Song Ci was awake, Han Zhan was overjoyed. \u201cBaby Ci, how do you feel?\u201d\n Song Ci looked slightly embarrassed and said something in a low voice.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t hear her clearly. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cA little dense.\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned for a moment before asking, \u201cUrine? Or feces?\u201d Han Zhan was slightly shocked. The doctor said that pregnant women would not defecate after giving birth. If there was a feeling of constipation, it was very likely to be major bleeding.\n Song Ci blushed shyly and explained softly, \u201cIt\u2019s milk swelling!\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n It was his first time being a father and Han Zhan didn\u2019t know about breast milk at all.\n Han Zhan immediately went to the maternal and infant supermarket to buy an electric pump and disinfected it.\n After chasing Song Fei and Yan Jiang away, Han Zhan closed the door and let Song Ci suck out the milk with an electric pump.\n But the suckers were not as effective as the baby\u2019s. Song Ci frowned in pain but nothing was sucked out.\n She abandoned her sense of shame and said to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, why don\u2019t you try?\u201d\n Han Zhan also blushed, but still braced himself.\n .\n The milk that was sucked out was pale yellow. Han Zhan sent the two bags to the pediatric ward.\n The nurse told Han Zhan, \u201cIf possible, I hope you can deliver the breast milk on time every day. If the breast milk supply is insufficient, it needs to be mixed with milk, it won\u2019t be good for the baby\u2019s digestive system.\u201d\n Han Zhan turned back and told Song Ci about this. Song Ci thought for a moment and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just find a house near the hospital and stay there? I will suck the milk out every day. You can find someone trustworthy to be in charge of delivering milk?\u201d\n Song Ci was a breast milk advocate. She always felt that breast milk was more suitable for human infants than goat milk. She planned to breastfeed the children until they were half a year old, before considering abstaining.\n Han Zhan had no objections.\n Coincidentally, the hospital was not far from the Jetta Hotel. Han Zhan arranged for Song Ci to stay in the presidential suite of the Jetta Hotel and had a confinement nanny take care of her.\n Han Zhan called Ah Lun over again and was in charge of delivering milk to the children everyday.\n Meanwhile, Han Zhan started running between the company, the hotel and the hospital.\n They could visit the children three times a week, once on Monday, once on Wednesday, and once on Saturday. Every time Han Zhan went, he would record a video of the two little guys and bring them home for Song Ci to see.\n Song Ci\u2019s worried heart gradually calmed down as she watched the two babies grow healthier and healthier, and finally gain some weight on their faces.\n But her desire to bring the baby home was even stronger.\n On this day, Han Zhan got off work early and returned to the hotel. He pulled up a chair and sat down beside Song Ci\u2019s bed.\n Song Ci was also doing yoga in her confinement period. She had just finished exercising and was lying lazily in bed, not even willing to move her fingers.\n Han Zhan fed Song Ci the peeled orange. \u201cLet me tell you something.\u201d\n Song Ci opened her eyes and glanced at Han Zhan. She blinked at him, meaning for him to ask directly.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cHave you thought of a name for our children?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cI plan to register the children tomorrow. Once I do, I will be able to get medical insurance. When the children are discharged, we can save 10,000 yuan by applying for medical insurance.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless. \u201cThe richest man still lacks that 10,000 yuan?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to save all that I can. I pay my taxes on time and buy medical insurance according to the rules, so my children deserves the benefits from medical insurance.\u201d\n Song Ci chuckled before saying, \u201cThe elder sister is called Han Miao, the younger sister is called Han Jun, and the future younger brother will be called Han Zhen. When the elder sister grows up, her name will be Jingyu, the younger sister will be called Youyu, and the younger brother will be called Lingyu.\u201d\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cHow is it?\u201d\n Han Zhan had no objections.\n Only one...\n \u201cWho will inherit your Old Song family\u2019s bloodline?\u201d\n Song Ci pouted. \u201cNo matter what their surname is, they are still the grandson of my Song family. This cannot be changed.\u201d\n \u201cActually, I don\u2019t have any requirements for the child\u2019s surname. They can have the surname Song or Han.\u201d Han Zhan asked her again, \u201cAre you really planning to give birth again?\u201d\n \u201cWhy? You can\u2019t afford it?\u201d\n Han Zhan sneered. \u201cI can afford eight or ten.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it in a few years.\u201d\n \u201cThen let the third child bear the surname Song.\u201d\n \u201cAnything is fine.\u201d\n The next day, Han Zhan brought his marriage certificate, admission pass, and household register to the police station to register the two girls.\n The children were hospitalized for a month and a half before being discharged.\n When they were discharged from the hospital, her elder sister had grown to 6.6 catties, while the younger sister was 6.1 catties.\n On the day the children were discharged, Song Ci had already finished her confinement. She, Han Zhan, and Old Master Han arrived at the hospital and happily fetched the children away.\n Old Master was dressed rather formally today and even put on a red down jacket.\n When they were discharged from the hospital, he carried his two great-granddaughters on each side of his arms. He was so happy that the corners of his lips were almost reaching his ears.\n Worried that the old man\u2019s hand would shake and the children would fall to the ground, Song Ci and Han Zhan supported the old man from both sides.\n Han Aoyu despised the two of them for looking down on him, so he scolded Han Zhan angrily. \u201cWhy? Are you looking down on an old set of bones like me? I can\u2019t carry a gun anymore, but carrying two children shouldn\u2019t be a problem!\u201d\n Han Zhan and Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to make a sound. Their submissive manner made them look like primary school students being reprimanded by their teacher.\n A reporter who had rushed over secretly took a few photos from the bushes. He edited the manuscript and posted it online.\n [The top debutante married into a family and gave birth to two daughters prematurely. Old Master despises her for having a daughter but not having a boy?]\n The accompanying photo was of Han Aoyu scolding Han Zhan angrily.\n In the article, the reporter used an exaggerated script to describe Song Ci\u2019s life after marrying into the family. It was like a television drama.\n When the readers saw this article, they all knew that this reporter was exaggerating, but this didn\u2019t stop them from being jealous. After all, not everyone was willing to see the top socialite lead a blissful life after marriage and be doted on.\n Everyone was jealous. There were always people who couldn\u2019t wait for Song Ci to suffer.\n After the children and Song Ci fell asleep, Han Zhan finally had the time to sit down on the sofa and have a cup of hot tea.\n Ever since the little guys were born, Han Zhan barely had any private time and rarely surfed the Internet. By the time he saw those comments online, Song Ci had already become a pitiful little girl who had married into a wealthy family and suffered all sorts of hardships.\n Han Zhan found the culprit, Zhou Wen Daily, who had published the defamation news. He read it and sneered. He directly informed the deputy head of the legal department to bring up the matter of suing Zhou Wen Daily.\n The more Han Zhan thought about it, the more unhappy he felt. He decided to do something to show the netizens how blissful Song Ci\u2019s life was.\n The next day, Han Aoyu woke up and saw Han Zhan standing at the door with an evil expression.\n Han Aoyu glanced at Han Zhan warily, feeling uncertain. He asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhy are you standing here?\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled and suddenly asked, \u201cGrandpa, are you interested in being a food vlog streamer?\u201d\n Han Aoyu was stunned. His eyes lit up as he rubbed his hands. \u201cCan I? I am so old...\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of being old. As long as you have money, your grandson can still turn you into the most popular food blogger on the Internet.\u201d\n Han Aoyu was very interested in being an internet celebrity.\n As he walked towards the kitchen, he asked Han Zhan about some things to take note of as an internet celebrity.\n Han Zhan told him, \u201cRemember to praise Song Ci more and mention her more so that others will know that she is your most beloved baby!\u201d\n Didn\u2019t they suspect that Grandpa looked down on Song Ci?\n Alright then, I\u2019ll let everyone see how much Grandpa \u201clooks down\u201d on Song Ci!\n Hearing this, Han Aoyu understood Han Zhan\u2019s intentions.\n \u201cWhy? What kind of rumors are spreading again?\u201d Grandpa was especially smart and immediately guessed that something had happened.\n Han Zhan told Han Aoyu about what happened online.\n After hearing that, Han Aoyu was especially angry. \u201cI despise Song Lass for not being able to have a son? What kind of bullsh*t joke is this! Isn\u2019t your mother just a lady? I treasure her so much!\u201d\n Han Aoyu put on his apron, picked up the chicken in the cage, and shouted angrily at Han Zhan, who was taking a video. \u201cCome, aim the camera at the chicken\u2019s neck. I want to let those people know what it means to make an example out of a chicken!\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "234": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-235\n\n Chapter 234: Love is a ray of light, Green to the Point of Making you Panic  The newly-promoted internet celebrity, Old Master Han, sat on a wooden stool boldly.\n Holding the hen in his left hand and a knife in his right, he asked Han Zhan roughly, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n Han Zhan had already placed the camera properly. \u201cDone.\u201d\n Han Zhan nodded. He raised the knife in his hand, coughed lightly, and nodded seriously at the camera. \u201cHello everyone, welcome to my gourmet live-stream.\u201d\n Han Zhan suppressed his laughter and signaled for Han Aoyu to continue.\n Han Aoyu said, \u201cToday, I want to show everyone how to make chestnut chicken stew. Although I am old, my culinary skills are outstanding. My grand daughter-in-law especially likes chestnut roasted chicken and will eat two bowls of meat and soup every time!\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n Once this got out, the entire internet would know that Song Ci was a glutton.\n \u201cFirstly, we need to raise the neck of the chicken, point the knife at this position, and gently cut down.\u201d As he explained, Han Aoyu cut down.\n With a gentle cut, blood spurted out of that chicken\u2019s neck.\n Han Aoyu used a bowl to catch the chicken blood. His aged eyes stared at the camera as he said faintly, \u201cThere are so many chickens in the chicken coop. Do you know why I chose this one?\u201d\n \u201cBecause it was disobedient. As a hen, it loved to crow and forgot its identity. It did things that it shouldn\u2019t have done and said things that it shouldn\u2019t have said. What\u2019s the point of keeping it? Why not just kill it?\u201d\n With that, he threw the chicken into the half-empty bucket of water and said, \u201cSome unscrupulous news agencies who can\u2019t control their mouths and pens will eventually close down.\u201d\n Han Zhan stood behind the camera and gave Han Aoyu a thumbs-up.\n Han Aoyu chuckled and started to pluck the feathers off the chicken, opening it up.\n \u201cAs for the chestnut, we\u2019ll boil them over water for three to four minutes, scoop up the asphalt, and fry them with oil. This way, the chestnuts made will be easily burned and tasteful.\u201d\n \u201cEvery time I make this dish, my Song Lass has to eat until she\u2019s full. If not for the fact that she can\u2019t digest chestnuts, she can eat half a pot.\u201d\n \u201cThe surface of the chicken is slightly yellowish and added with spiced wine. Song Lass said that adding spiced wine at this time is better than marinating the chicken in advance...\u201d\n By the time Song Ci woke up, Han Zhan and Han Aoyu had already prepared a pot of chestnut roasted chicken. The grandfather and grandson were squeezed in front of the computer and watching the first cut.\n Song Ci stood behind the two of them and stared at the grandfather and grandson duo who were behaving mysteriously. She suddenly asked, \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d\n Han Aoyu turned and waved at her. \u201cLass Song, come and see Grandpa\u2019s food video.\u201d\n Song Ci sat down and watched the entire video from start to finish. She felt very conflicted. \u201cGrandpa, can you delete the part where I said I will eat two bowls of soup for one meal? It won\u2019t be good if others know that I am eating ravenously.\u201d\n Grandpa glared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing to be able to eat. You didn\u2019t eat chestnuts from other people\u2019s houses. What are you afraid of?\u201d\n Seeing that she could not talk sense into Grandpa, Song Ci had no choice but to give up.\n For breakfast, the family ate three-colored fried rice and chestnut roasted chicken. After eating, Han Zhan went to work. When he arrived at the company, he handed the first film to his assistant and asked him to look for professionals to do the post-production and accompaniment music.\n Late in the afternoon, she sent the finished product to Han Zhan. Han Zhan watched it once and felt that there was no problem, so he forwarded it to his grandfather. His grandfather was very satisfied after reading it and hurriedly asked Han Zhan how to use Weibo to post a video.\n Han Zhan told Grandpa about the steps. Grandpa pondered for a while but still didn\u2019t know how to do it, so he called Song Ci over.\n \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Grandpa, just watch. You can do it yourself next time.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Han Aoyu sat beside Song Ci and started posting. Like a primary school student who was listening intently to a lesson, he stared at his computer and studied the steps seriously.\n After the video was uploaded successfully, Song Ci asked her grandfather, \u201cGrandpa, do you need a certification? It\u2019s for being a food blogger.\u201d\n Han Aoyu was excited. \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Song Ci helped Han Aoyu apply for the food blogger\u2019s certification. As she had used her connections, she received the news of the certification 10 minutes later.\n Han Aoyu becoming a food blogger and personally taking food blogs was astonishing.\n The netizens commented:\n First post: The elderly sure live a rich life.\n Second post: As expected of Old Master Han. He can cook at home and kill enemies outside.\n Third post: Sob sob sob, Old Master is so domineering. When Old Madam Han was young, she must have been mesmerized by Old Master\u2019s banditry and ferocity.\n Fourth post: Am I the only one who feels that Old Master is using the excuse of killing a chicken to threaten some unscrupulous media?\n Fifth comment: Old Master dotes on Song Ci too much. He even cooked for her personally and knows her taste. One look and I can tell that he often cooks for her!\n ...\n On the same day, Zhou Wen Daily received a lawyer\u2019s notice from Zeus Corporation.\n A few days later, Zhou Wen Daily lost the lawsuit and publicly apologized for purposely writing a script to smear Song Ci.\n But the next day, Zhou Wen Daily was investigated by the relevant departments and was found with many loopholes. Within a few days, it was banned from operating and closed down.\n \u2013\n After the children returned home, they adapted to their new lives within a few days. Song Ci also found the routine of the two little guys and developed the habit of regularly feeding them and sleeping throughout the entire night.\n With the help of two well-known, professional confinement nannies, Song Ci\u2019s postpartum life was actually very leisurely. On the second month after the children were born, Han Zhan set up a first-month birthday party for the two children at the Jetta Hotel.\n On the day of the first-month birthday banquet, almost all the high ranking officials and nobles in Wangdong City came. On this day, just the gift money alone, Han Zhan received 20 million yuan.\n After the banquet ended, Han Zhan donated all the money to the \u201cBan Ban Foundation\u201d. When Song Ci first discovered her pregnancy, Han Zhan established a children\u2019s foundation to specially help those seriously ill children who had no money to get treated.\n At first, he didn\u2019t know that Song Ci was pregnant with twins, so he took the liberty of giving the child a nickname of Ban Ban. He even named the first generation holographic gaming cabin Ban Ban.\n In the end, Song Ci got pregnant with two children, so they did not use the nickname Ban Ban.\n At the one-month-old party, Cheng Yanmo and Su Huanyan also arrived. Su Huanyan was about to give birth these few days and it was slightly inconvenient for her to walk. Seeing Song Ci and her two adorable, fair daughters, Su Huanyan especially wanted to hug them.\n But for the sake of the children\u2019s health, Han Zhan didn\u2019t allow the guests to carry the children.\n Song Ci saw that Su Huanyan was staring at the child lovingly. She carried Da Bao and said to Su Huanyan, \u201cThis is elder sister Han Miao. Huanyan, do you want to carry her?\u201d\n Huan Yan reached out in surprise and carried the child stiffly.\n \u201cSo cute, her feet are still moving!\u201d Su Huanyan touched Han Miao\u2019s little feet and suddenly exclaimed. \u201cOh no.\u201d\n Song Ci raised her brows and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n Su Huanyan hugged Han Miao and said to Song Ci awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m going to the washroom.\u201d\n Su Huanyan went to the washroom and returned after a while. She saw Song Ci and said, \u201cI see red.\u201d\n It meant that she was going to give birth!\n Song Ci hurriedly found Cheng Yanmo.\n Knowing that Su Huanyan had seen red, Cheng Yanmo didn\u2019t even eat his meal and planned to bring her to the hospital. But Su Huanyan said, \u201cDon\u2019t panic. Wait until I\u2019m full. Otherwise, I won\u2019t have the strength to give birth.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo was speechless.\n Cheng Yanmo watched uneasily as Su Huanyan calmly ate two bowls of rice and drank half a bowl of soup.\n Cheng Yanmo admired Su Huanyan\u2019s composure.\n This was true calmness in the face of trouble.\n After eating, Su Huanyan turned to say to Cheng Yanmo, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I feel like I\u2019m having contractions.\u201d\n Cheng Yanmo carried Su Huanyan and walked out.\n That night, Han Zhan received a call from Cheng Yanmo. He said that Su Huanyan had already given birth and the mother and son were safe. It was a boy.\n Han Zhan congratulated the other party over the phone. He turned back and saw Song Ci anxiously waiting for the good news. He said, \u201cShe gave birth to a boy. The mother and son are safe.\u201d\n Only then did Song Ci feel at ease.\n On the 100th day of the two babies\u2019 birthday, they had a photoshoot. On the same day, the movie \u201cLe Chi\u201d was scheduled for release and the trailer was officially released.\n That day, Du Junfei posted Le Chi\u2019s trailer on Instagram and Weibo. All the actors forwarded the trailer and left a message: \u201cMay 5th. See you there.\u201d\n Song Ci also reposted her Weibo account and wrote the same official statement.\n The netizens opened the Le Chi movie and watched the trailer. They were shocked to find that the Asian beauty inside was especially beautiful, but they had never seen her before. Not everyone knew Song Ci, and there were still some who didn\u2019t.\n Those who didn\u2019t know better took a screenshot of Song Ci\u2019s scenes in \u201cLe Chi\u201d and posted it to ask about this young lady.\n When Song Ci\u2019s fans saw it, they left a warm message to explain Song Ci\u2019s information to them.\n After knowing that this lady was Zeus Corporation\u2019s lady boss, Song Ci, everyone was shocked but also not surprised.\n As Zeus Corporation\u2019s wife, Song Ci didn\u2019t lack money. Perhaps she was the one who had invested in this drama.\n Not only did the netizens in China think this way, but the netizens overseas were also making all sorts of malicious speculations about this beautiful but unknown female lead.\n There were also rumors abroad that Song Ci had brought in funds or had an ambiguous relationship with the director and producer.\n Du Junfei called Song Ci. \u201cDid you see those negative comments about you both locally and internationally?\u201d\n Song Ci was busy accompanying her child every day and practicing her violin skills. She didn\u2019t have the time to look at those scandals at all. But she had roughly heard those things from Yan Jiang.\n Hearing this, Song Ci said nonchalantly, \u201cSecond Old Master, what do you think of my performance?\u201d\n Du Junfei said, \u201cYou\u2019re outstanding. Although you\u2019re a newbie and don\u2019t have any acting experience, it\u2019s a good thing you have a good-looking face. Under my earnest guidance and post-production editing, you\u2019re as beautiful as a fairy and a pretty vase.\u201d\n Song Ci was about to cry from anger. \u201cThank you for your praise.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Let them say whatever they want. Anyway, you\u2019re not in the entertainment circles. Why would you be afraid of them?\u201d\n \u201cAlright then.\u201d\n Both negative and positive comments could also hype up the movie. Du Junfei saw that Song Ci didn\u2019t even care about herself and was happy to see the netizens hype up his movie.\n But these things eventually reached Coleman\u2019s ears.\n Coleman was a strange man. He had a perverted obsession with piano and Rain, but was very cold to other things. But such a cold man had posted a video on his instagram account.\n It was a scene from when Song Ci played her self-composed tune \u201cZhan\u201d during the interview.\n Although the setting for the interview was very simple, Song Ci\u2019s performance made one feel like she was standing at the top of a tall mountain, looking down on everyone.\n Coleman wrote down his comments for Song Ci in French.\n She was the most perfect Rain, an angel scattered across the world, my lifelong pursuit and belief.\n The entire world was shocked to see Coleman\u2019s statement!\n This autistic pianist actually confessed to a Chinese woman publicly? And even said that she was his lifelong pursuit and belief?\n Meanwhile, the netizens in the country felt a sense of pride and joy after seeing Coleman\u2019s statement. But at the same time, they felt some pity for Han Zhan and felt that his head was glowing green.\n Love is a ray of light, so green that you panic.\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",

Unfortunately, her mother had passed away many years ago and wouldn\u2019t know Coleman\u2019s devotion.\n Sometimes, when Song Ci analyzed the emotional entanglements of her mother\u2019s life, she also felt that her mother was a jerk.\n She first ruined the pianist Coleman, then Han Zhan\u2019s wretched father, and finally tied herself to her father, a healthy pine tree.\n In terms of trash, not many women were worse than Jiang Shiyu.\n Her scumbags were all reputable big bosses.\n Song Ci gave a Like to Coleman\u2019s Instagram and ignored the comments of those anti-fans online.\n The movie was scheduled to be released on May 5, 2022. It was January 28th and the lunar new year would be in a few days.\n Starting from the 23rd of February, the production team would hold several media conferences around the world.\n After all, Song Ci was the female lead, so she had to attend several major international movie promotions.\n Du Junfei told Song Ci on WeChat that he had arranged four publicity events for her.\n They were at New York Station on 23 February, London Station 26 February, and Paris Station 5 March.\n The last stop was at Yu City Station in China. The press conference was scheduled for March 12.\n In other words, from the 21st of February onwards, Song Ci had to leave home to attend a publicity event in the United States. It would only end on the 13th of March.\n Song Ci, who had just been promoted to a mother, couldn\u2019t bear to leave her two children for 20 days.\n But Song Ci couldn\u2019t break the contract.\n Since she was going to attend the publicity meeting, the vain Song Ci would never allow herself to appear sloppy and greasy in front of the reporters.\n Over the past two months after the delivery, Song Ci had successfully lost 16 catties of weight under the guidance of a nutritionist.\n The Song Ci now was considered slender compared to when she was just giving birth, but she was still much more voluptuous than before.\n There were still more than 20 days left until the publicity meeting. Song Ci planned to make use of this time to do two things. One was to stop breastfeeding the children and the other was to slim down to her prenatal size.\n During the new year, Song Ci spent a week and successfully weaned the babies.\n The process of weaning was very painful. Not only was the child uncomfortable, but Song Ci also felt very bloated. Often, when she woke up at night, her blouse would be drenched.\n During that period, their bedsheets and blankets always smelled like milk.\n Even when Han Zhan went to work, Li Li could smell the milk on him.\n Li Li teased Han Zhan. \u201cYour Song Ci is a mother, why is there a milk smell on you?\u201d Li Li\u2019s child drank milk, so Li Li didn\u2019t know about women weaning.\n Han Zhan also couldn\u2019t tell Li Li about Song Ci\u2019s recent embarrassing incident when she was breastfeeding. Hearing Li Li\u2019s question, Han Zhan said, \u201cWe are a good couple. Are you jealous?\u201d\n Li Li pouted. \u201cWhy should I be jealous of you?\u201d\n Li Li\u2019s life was rather peaceful now.\n Li Li and Su Beibei moved out to live alone. Without the war between mother and daughter-in-law, Li Li and Su Beibei\u2019s relationship had completely stabilized.\n Arriving at the new house, Li Li found a nanny for Su Beibei who was in charge of cleaning and cooking.\n Su Beibei was only in charge of taking care of the child.\n Their child was very obedient. Perhaps he knew that it was too tiring for Su Beibei to carry him, so he slept the entire night after he was discharged.\n Even if that child woke up hungry at night, he would eat and sleep again.\n He was especially worry-free.\n \u201cOh yes, has Auntie been causing trouble recently?\u201d\n As Li Li had moved house with his grandson and daughter-in-law, leaving the old lady at home alone, Mother Li had been sulking and kicking up a fuss recently, causing Li Li to be mentally exhausted.\n Hearing Han Zhan ask about his mother, Li Li looked slightly tired.\n He sighed. \u201cI only realized recently that my mother is so unreasonable.\u201d\n In the past, Li Li and Mother Li relied on each other for survival. Mother Li treated him like he was her everything. She loved him so much that she couldn\u2019t bear to hurt him.\n But now, Mother Li felt that Li Li had abandoned her for a woman and refused to let her take care of her grandson. Mother Li felt very unhappy.\n The relationship between this mother and son, who used to be very close, was getting more and more strained.\n Han Zhan counseled Li Li. \u201cAuntie still dotes on you. She\u2019s just angry for now. Don\u2019t be impatient. As a son, it\u2019s the worst thing to be caught in the middle. You have to thank your Beibei for not being an unreasonable woman.\u201d\n If Su Beibei was also muddle-headed and wanted to go against Mother Li, Li Li\u2019s days would be truly miserable.\n Li Li\u2019s heart warmed at the thought of Su Beibei.\n \u201cMmm, Beibei probably feels sorry for my mother. No matter what my mother says, she will endure it. Actually, I wish she could yell at my mother sometimes. It\u2019s not a good idea to keep suppressing it.\u201d\n Li Li felt that the arrogant and proud Su Beibei was the real Su Beibei with character and soul.\n His heart ached for such a wronged Su Beibei.\n Han Zhan agreed with Li Li\u2019s view. He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down with Beibei and have a heart-to-heart talk with her? Tell her your attitude and thoughts. Your support is her confidence when facing your mother.\u201d\n \u201cMoreover, Auntie\u2019s thinking is also wrong. Your father might not deserve to die, but he is indeed in the wrong. It is illegal for him to hit someone while drunk. Su Beibei lost her parents. In the end, she is the most pitiful person.\u201d\n Li Li nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I also explained it to my mother, but she didn\u2019t listen to anything.\u201d\n \u201cAren\u2019t all women like this?\u201d\n The two of them smiled at each other and didn\u2019t speak further.\n \u2013\n Time flew by like a white horse. In the blink of an eye, it was 19 February.\n Thinking that Song Ci would be setting off for America the day after tomorrow, Han Zhan felt slightly frustrated and distracted. In the end, he just skipped work and went home.\n Han Zhan sat in the car and called Song Ci. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cAt home.\u201d\n \u201cPack up. I\u2019ll be right back to fetch you.\u201d\n Song Ci was currently sunbathing in the courtyard with the children.\n In the courtyard, there were two bamboo beds and a baby laid on each bed.\n The names of the elder sister and younger sister were written on the bedsheets.\n The crib was made by Han Zhan, the words were written by Old Master, and the bedsheets were chosen by Song Ci.\n Although it was almost March by the time the children were born, they were still premature babies and had only been corrected for slightly more than a month. The little ones still didn\u2019t know how to turn over, but they loved to smile.\n If Song Ci teased them slightly, the elder sister would look like she had been poked in the mouth. She would open her mouth to reveal her toothless gums and smile non-stop.\n His younger sister, Han Jun, was more reserved. She smiled more gently.\n Hearing Han Zhan\u2019s words, Song Ci stuffed a rattle into the elder sister\u2019s palm and shook her hand. Hearing the rattle, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhy are you asking me to change clothes? Are you attending a party?\u201d\n \u201cNo, I want to go on a date with you.\u201d\n Hearing Han Zhan say seriously that he wanted to date her, Song Ci\u2019s heartbeat quickened.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t even remember the last time she dated Han Zhan.\n She smiled widely and asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cLet\u2019s keep it a secret first. You can just change into clothes that are convenient for movement.\u201d\n \u201cOkay!\u201d\n Song Ci called Zhong Buhui over and carried the crib back to the house with him for Old Master to look after.\n Every child had a personal nanny to take care of them. In addition, Old Master and Uncle Zhong were at home, so Song Ci could go out and relax.\n She went upstairs to put on makeup, changed clothes, and came downstairs with her bag.\n Grandpa saw that Song Ci looked especially good today. He took off his reading glasses, put down the book in his hand, and asked Song Ci with a smile, \u201cAre you going out? With a friend?\u201d\n Song Ci picked up an apple from the table and stuffed it into her bag.\n Recently, she had been on a diet and ate very little. She had to eat some fruits in the afternoon to replenish her energy.\n Song Ci smiled mischievously at Grandpa. \u201cBrother Han is going on a date with me.\u201d\n \u201cYo!\u201d Han Aoyu glanced at the two children and suddenly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come back tonight. Anyway, there\u2019s a nanny taking care of the children. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n Song Ci instinctively asked, \u201cWhy should we not come back?\u201d\n Only after asking did Song Ci realize what her grandfather meant.\n Song Ci blushed uncontrollably, until the redness spread to her neck.\n Song Ci lowered her head and stammered. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Brother Han is taking me. I won\u2019t know if I will return tonight until later...\u201d\n Hearing the sound of a car, Song Ci ran off. \u201cBrother Han is here. I\u2019ll get going first, Grandpa!\u201d\n Han Aoyu chuckled.\n He looked down at the two little babies and couldn\u2019t resist poking their chubby chins.\n It was like poking jelly, very soft and supple.\n Old Master felt that it was fun and poked it a few more times.\n Zhong Buhui saw it and hurriedly stopped him. \u201cThe children are going to sleep. Old Master, please show mercy.\u201d\n Only then did Old Master reluctantly retract his claws.\n \u2013\n Han Zhan had just parked the car at the main entrance and alighted. He saw the main door open from the inside and Song Ci rushed out like a little steel cannon.\n Song Ci ran into Han Zhan\u2019s arms.\n Han Zhan caught her and looked down at her outfit today.\n The sun was shining very brightly today and the temperature was at 12 degrees Celsius. The weather was warm and suitable for showing off one\u2019s beauty.\n Song Ci was wearing a short beige sweater and a pair of tight, high-waisted jeans.\n She pulled up her lazy curly hair and put on a pair of ruby earrings.\n Beautiful, lazy and charming.\n Seeing that Han Zhan was sizing her up, Song Ci looked up and smiled radiantly.\n Han Zhan was swayed by that smile.\n \u201cDon\u2019t smile like that.\u201d Han Zhan covered Song Ci\u2019s smiling eyes.\n Song Ci grabbed the back of his hand and suppressed her laughter. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cIt makes me want to kiss you.\u201d Even more so.\n Song Ci took Han Zhan\u2019s hand and invited him boldly. \u201cCome on, kiss me. I will give you full privileges.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at Song Ci\u2019s lipstick-stained lips and powdered face, unable to swallow.\n In the end, he just picked up the back of Song Ci\u2019s hand and kissed it.\n Song Ci retracted her hand and smiled as she grabbed Han Zhan\u2019s arm. She stood on tiptoe and said in Han Zhan\u2019s ear, \u201cJust now, Grandpa said that we can not come back tonight.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at her deeply and asked, \u201cHas it been three months?\u201d\n The doctor said that after the cesarean section, it was not recommended for the couple to sleep in the same room for three months.\n Han Zhan had already held it in for too long. He was afraid that if he let go, he would be very beastly.\n Song Ci said, \u201cJust a day or two away.\u201d\n It was alright.\n Han Zhan understood Song Ci\u2019s hint. He said, \u201cWait for me to visit our daughters. I won\u2019t be able to see them for the entire night. I miss them.\u201d\n Han Zhan returned to the house alone.\n The two little guys were drowsy.\n The moment Han Zhan returned, he carried them up, kissing and teasing them.\n After having fun, Han Zhan left, leaving behind two children who wanted to sleep but couldn\u2019t.\n Han Zhan hurried back to the car.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI think I hear the children crying.\u201d\n Han Zhan heard the nannies coaxing the children. He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s all in your imagination.\u201d\n Song Ci thought she had heard wrongly.\n Han Zhan helped Song Ci fasten her seatbelt. Staring at Song Ci\u2019s beautiful and coquettish face up close, Han Zhan suddenly said, \u201cYou\u2019re especially beautiful today. You look like an 18-year-old girl.\u201d\n fter hearing Han Zhan\u2019s praise, Song Ci felt very happy. She said, \u201cThis is called being young.\u201d\n \u201cThen I\u2019m preying on young girls?\u201d Han Zhan made a humorous joke.\n Song Ci was amused by Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan started the car. When he looked up, he saw his own face and outfit on the car recorder and frowned.\n A grey, tight turtleneck sweater and a navy blue sweater. No matter how one looked at it, he looked like an adult man.\n And it was the old and sickly type.\n Han Zhan felt slightly sad.\n As the car drove down the hill, Song Ci\u2019s sleeve accidentally brushed against her lipstick. She took out a small mirror from her bag and took out her lipstick to touch up her makeup.\n After applying her lipstick, Song Ci suddenly heard Han Zhan ask, \u201cDo you think I will look better with long hair and a fashionable hairstyle?\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci turned sideways in confusion and stared at Han Zhan strangely.\n Song Ci suspected that Han Zhan\u2019s soul had changed today.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you still my Brother Han?\u201d Her manly Brother Han never fussed about his hair and skin color.\n What happened today?\n Han Zhan explained. \u201cI\u2019m tired of looking at buzz cut.\u201d The main point was that buzz cut made one look too mature and he wanted to look younger.\n Song Ci clicked her tongue and said, \u201cThat buzz cut is pretty good. It\u2019s energetic and manly. Why must a man be so exquisite and good-looking? It\u2019s better to be rich than handsome.\u201d\n Han Zhan complained to Song Ci. \u201cYou\u2019re too realistic.\u201d\n \u201cDo you love it then?\u201d\n \u201cLove.\u201d\n After a while, Song Ci heard Han Zhan ask again, \u201cDo you have any good facial masks to recommend? I want those that can make people younger.\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n She finally understood what Han Zhan meant.\n \u201cBrother Han, do you think you are old?\u201d Song Ci felt that it was unbelievable. How did Han Zhan suddenly gain enlightenment?\n Han Zhan acknowledged softly.\n He touched the back of his eye with his left hand and felt slightly sad. \u201cSometimes when I frown, I can realize that there are one or two very light wrinkles at the bottom of my eye.\u201d\n He already had wrinkles, but what about Song Ci?\n She was as tender as grass and her face was covered in collagen. She looked so beautiful just by dressing up.\n Han Zhan still cared about his looks more or less.\n \u201cI am already starting to get wrinkles, but Baby Ci, you\u2019re still very young. I want to look more compatible with you.\u201d\n Song Ci felt amused but also sad.\n \u201cBrother Han.\u201d She reached out her left hand and pressed her index and middle fingers on the edge of Han Zhan\u2019s right eye.\n Song Ci gently rubbed the back of Han Zhan\u2019s eyes, her tone turning very gentle.\n She said, \u201cBrother Han, in my heart, you are the most handsome man in the world. I admire many young men\u2019s skin, but I only admire and like your soul.\u201d\n \u201cI like you. Whether it\u2019s the 22-year-old you or the current you.\u201d Or... the blind you in my previous life who was over 40 years old.\n Song Ci\u2019s sudden confession tingled Han Zhan\u2019s heart.\n Han Zhan really wanted to stop the car on the spot, pull Song Ci into his arms, remove her headband, and take off her sweater.\n He really wanted to.\n But Han Zhan could tolerate what ordinary people couldn\u2019t.\n He suppressed the fluttering in his heart and told Song Ci, \u201cI was overthinking.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t think like this in the future.\u201d\n Song Ci leaned against the car seat and narrowed her eyes for a while. She even had a dream that Han Zhan had gone to buy facial masks in order to become beautiful and was fooled by the salesperson\u2019s mouth again.\n He bought a bunch of facial masks and placed them on his face. The next day, his face was covered in pimples.\n In her dream, Han Zhan, who had nearly been disfigured by the toxin mask, sat pitifully on the wooden floor by the bed. He said to Song Ci without tears, \u201cSong Ci, I am already disfigured and not worthy of you. Go and find a better person.\u201d\n Song Ci laughed when she woke up from the dream.\n ]Han Zhan looked at the smiling Song Ci in surprise and asked her, \u201cWhat good thing did you dream of?\u201d\n Song Ci hurriedly shook her head. \u201cI dreamed of drumsticks.\u201d\n In order to lose weight, Song Ci had not eaten drumsticks for a long time, so Han Zhan really believed her lie.\n Han Zhan\u2019s heart ached for Song Ci.\n He parked the car by the roadside and alighted to buy a fried chicken leg for Song Ci.\n Song Ci smelled the fragrance of fried chicken and felt hungry. She really wanted to snatch the drumstick and finish it in a few bites.\n But her desire to have a good figure overcame her desire for food.\n Han Zhan ate the soft shell of the chicken and handed it to Song Ci. \u201cI\u2019ve already eaten the starch with the most heat. You won\u2019t gain weight if you eat meat.\u201d\n Song Ci said softly to Han Zhan, \u201cI want to eat that layer of skin.\u201d\n Han Zhan was speechless.\n That drumstick still ended up in Han Zhan\u2019s stomach.\n An hour later, they arrived at their destination.\n After alighting from the car, Song Ci looked up and saw the words \u201cAK outdoor hunting grounds.\u201d\n She was slightly surprised. \u201cWhy did you bring me to the hunting grounds?\u201d\n \u201cI heard from Yan Jiang that you are very good at shooting, even better than Song Fei.\u201d Han Zhan asked Song Ci, \u201cIs this true?\u201d\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cYes, I was a marksman in junior high school.\u201d\n But due to her heavy studies and limited energy, Song Ci could only choose between shooting and violin.\n Song Tingyun hoped that Song Ci could attend the Olympics and win a gold medal for China. Meanwhile, Jiang Shiyu hoped that Song Ci could learn to play the violin well and achieve her goal when she was young.\n Song Ci loved the violin more. After struggling for a while, she could only endure the pain and give up shooting.\n Jiang Shiyu was satisfied with this, but Song Tingyun felt pity.\n Han Zhan was a gun lover. His sniper skills were among the top in the world.\n The legend of him being an elite sniper was all true.\n Han Zhan wanted to test Song Ci\u2019s standards today.\n \u201cLet\u2019s have a competition today.\u201d\n Han Zhan held Song Ci\u2019s hand and brought her to the front desk. He logged in and received two automatic sensor points.\n Han Zhan put the scorer on Song Ci\u2019s wrist.\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t recognize this thing.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cThis is a scorer with an automatic sensor. After entering the hunting grounds later, every time you kill a prey, the scorer will accumulate points.\u201d\n Han Zhan explained the rules of this shooting club to Song Ci.\n \u201cThe hunting grounds will be opened three times a day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and once in the evening. The opening time is two hours each time. The number of players participating in the game is usually between 80 to 120.\u201d\n \u201cThe prey in the club are all virtual animals. The animals will randomly appear anywhere for only three seconds. The amazing thing is that they can move and are not slow. What we need to do is to kill the most prey in the shortest time possible.\u201d\n Understanding the rules, Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cWhat\u2019s the reward for getting a placing?\u201d\n Number one: \u201cFree stay at Paper-Drunk Clubhouse for a night\u201d Paper-Drunk clubhouse sounded very shady, and one could tell that it was not a proper place.\n Paper-Drunk Clubhouse was Wangdong City\u2019s most expensive entertainment venue. There were the most beautiful princesses and the most handsome male hosts. All of them had high education, good looks, and high EQ.\n Usually, one wouldn\u2019t dare to go in without 500,000 yuan in the pocket.\n Song Ci knew that money was everything. She had long heard that the gigolos inside were especially considerate and sweet-talked their guests.\n Song Ci had never enjoyed it.\n She wanted to be first and wanted to experience the glory of the male hosts.\n Without waiting for Han Zhan to introduce the rewards for the second and third place, Song Ci said, \u201cThen let\u2019s get first place.\u201d\n Han Zhan sneered. \u201cDo you think those men and women will be willing to cheer you up or more willing to cheer me up if you go with me?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t need to think to know that those money-minded people would definitely try their best to cheer Han Zhan up.\n After all, Han Zhan was a wealthy, handsome, and fit old man.\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t stand the thought of those people\u2019s dirty hands touching Brother Han\u2019s body.\n She chose a gun and asked as she tested it, \u201cWhat\u2019s the second prize?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cSecond place, 100,000 yuan in cash.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t lack that 100,000 yuan.\n After thinking for a moment, she said, \u201cWe can spend the night in Paper-Drunk Clubhouse and not order the princess and young master.\u201d\n Han Zhan had no objections.\n There were 90 people in the hunting ground.\n After Song Ci entered the hunting ground, she moved together with Han Zhan. Whoever saw the prey first would be the one to kill it.\n Han Zhan had lost two fingers and was no longer able to pull the trigger with his right hand. However, he could still fire with his left hand and his capabilities were not to be underestimated.\n Song Ci was stunned when she saw a transparent silver elk under a maple tree.\n While she was in a daze, Han Zhan had already shot that elk.\n Only then did Song Ci realize that this adorable little guy was a projection animal.\n Song Ci was unconvinced. She said, \u201cI was careless this time. I won\u2019t let you do it again!\u201d\n Han Zhan, \u201d Okay.\u201d\n The two of them walked another hundred meters forward. Song Ci\u2019s sharp eyes saw a deer appear by the side of the river. This time, Song Ci reacted quickly. She aimed at the deer immediately and fired.\n Pfft...\n The roe deer fell to the ground. Song Ci\u2019s score changed from 0 to 1.\n Han Zhan\u2019s eyes lit up as he watched Song Ci raise her gun, aim at her prey, and pull the trigger.\n \u201cBeautiful!\u201d\n Song Ci really knew how to play with guns.\n \u201cThe last time you held a gun, you were so afraid that your hands were trembling.\u201d Han Zhan was referring to a long time ago, when Song Ci mistakenly treated Han Zhan as a hired killer and forced herself to be calm as she pointed the gun at his head.\n Song Ci said, \u201cTo be honest, that was my first time touching a gun. We learned how to use an air gun and you used a real gun. How is that the same?\u201d\n Although an air gun could also hurt people, its power was far inferior to a real gun.\n Han Zhan told her, \u201cActually, no matter what gun it is, they only exist for one reason: to kill. Whether it\u2019s an air gun, a pistol, or a rifle, they are essentially the same. They are just a weapon.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci shook her head.\n She said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with you.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked down at her.\n He asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cI never raised my gun to kill, but to protect the people around me.\u201d\n Upon hearing this, a strong emotional reaction surfaced in Han Zhan\u2019s gray-blue eyes.\n Song Ci continued walking forward and didn\u2019t notice how deep and passionate Han Zhan\u2019s eyes were behind her.\n Two hours later, the competition ended.\n Song Ci got second place with a good result of 26 points.\n Han Zhan got first place with a score of 35 points.\n Song Ci received a reward of 100,000 yuan while Han Zhan received a complimentary stay at Paper-Drunk Clubhouse.\n Walking out of the hunting grounds, Song Ci was so agitated that her face was red. She stuffed the 100,000 yuan cash card into Han Zhan\u2019s belt.\n ]Han Zhan looked down at that card and asked her with a smile, \u201cWhat for? Buy me for a night?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cNo, let\u2019s change it to a real prize.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly disappointed.\n He handed that free voucher to Song Ci.\n Song Ci lowered her head and kissed her consumer voucher. She said happily, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s indulge in debauchery!\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at Song Ci lovingly and let her be. \u201cKet\u2019s eat before going.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t. There will definitely be food and drinks inside. Leave your stomach empty when you go there, and go home full!\u201d Song Ci was only so capable.\n Han Zhan agreed with Song Ci\u2019s way of doing things. \u201cAlright then, let\u2019s go to the clubhouse now.\u201d\n Paper-Drunk didn\u2019t open the door until 9pm.\n Han Zhan and Song Ci shopped around the city for a while, before buying a cup of influencer milk tea and heading to Paper-Drunk Clubhouse.\n It was built in the new city district on the north coast.\n The houses in the new city area of the north coast were all modern-style cement buildings. However, the extravagant lifestyle was an antique imitation of Tang architectural style.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan walked into the clubhouse and were attracted by the antique buildings and gardens.\n Song Ci asked Han Zhan, \u201cHave you been here before?\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s expensive here. It\u2019s a waste of money to come here to talk about food, and talking about relationships is nonsense.\u201d\n Song Ci gave Han Zhan a big thumbs-up.\n She said, \u201cI did once.\u201d\n Han Zhan was slightly surprised and heard Song Ci say, \u201cIn my previous life.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked her, \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cCheng Ziang was beaten up here. Someone called me to collect his body.\u201d\n She came and saw the beaten up Cheng Ziang. She felt exceptionally happy.\n \u201cWhy was he beaten up again?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think the boss of this shop has a personal grudge with Cheng Ziang.\u201d\n \u201cBoss?\u201d Han Zhan said, \u201cThe boss of this shop is very mysterious. I found some information about him and know that he is the world\u2019s most mysterious killer, Mu Feng. But no one knows Mu Feng\u2019s true identity.\u201d\n In other words, the identity of the boss of this shop was a mystery and no one knew the truth.\n ]Song Ci said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either. Anyway, when I died, this shop was still open.\u201d\n As they chatted, the two of them had already arrived in the middle of the courtyard.\n In the middle of the courtyard stood rows of beautiful women in silver cheongsams. Each of them had an embroidered silk shawl draped over their shoulders.\n It was winter and she was very professional to be standing in the courtyard in such a cool outfit.\n The beauties carried a lantern. It was like the light of a firefly in the dark courtyard.\n The woman on the left walked out with a lantern and bent over to Han Zhan and Song Ci. Her voice was as clear as a clear spring. She said, \u201cWelcome to our humble shop, Mr. Han and Mrs. Han.\u201d\n When they entered the shop, the two of them used their identification cards to log in. Han Zhan was not surprised to be accurately recognized.\n \u201cThe small shop has Elegance Restaurant, Clear Music Pavilion, Carefree Pavilion, and Records Pavilion. May I know where you guys want to go for fun?\u201d\n The so-called Elegance Restaurant referred to the venue for scholarly gatherings.\n Meanwhile, the Qingya Pavilion was a place for music lovers to interact.\n Carefree Pavilion was a place for entertainment.\n Political Thinking Pavilion was a secret place for the big bosses of the business world.\n Han Zhan looked at Song Ci.\n Song Ci was here to visit gigolos. Of course she had to go to Carefree Pavilion.\n \u201cCarefree Pavilion.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, I\u2019m Yue Han. I am honored to be your guide.\u201d\n Yue Han brought Han Zhan and Song Ci to Carefree Pavilion.\n The Carefree Pavilion was seven stories tall.\n Although it was an ancient building, there was an elevator inside. They arrived at the third floor and saw rows of beauties and handsome men sitting at the entrance of the main hall.\n Amongst them, some were dressed in modern clothes, some in civilian clothes, and some in traditional Chinese clothes.\n Song Ci was overjoyed as she stared at the row of beauties and men.\n She pinched Han Zhan\u2019s arm and said, \u201cBrother Han, Brother Han, that boy in a light blue Han suit is especially handsome. We want him!\u201d\n Han Zhan said coldly, \u201cI think that girl in a cheongsam is very beautiful. Shall we have her?\u201d\n If you want a handsome man, I want a beautiful woman.\n Song Ci could tell that Han Zhan was displeased and hurriedly said, \u201cForget it, forget it. He\u2019s not as handsome as Brother Han. Let\u2019s go find a seat and sit down. I heard that the performance of Carefree Pavilion in a drunken state is especially exciting. Let\u2019s take a look.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n The two of them found a seat and someone served exquisite tea and snacks.\n At this moment, a lady in a light purple dress walked up the stage carrying a zither.\n Song Ci stared at that person\u2019s profile. \u201cAt most an A.\u201d\n It could be said that she had tried her best to squeeze, but there was still no cleavage.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cShe\u2019s quite tall.\u201d\n That woman hugged her zither and bowed slightly in all directions.\n When she turned around and bowed in the direction of Han Zhan and the rest, Song Ci suddenly covered her mouth and exclaimed, \u201cIsn\u2019t this Jiang Bi from downstairs?\u201d\n Han Zhan looked up and met Jiang Bi\u2019s eyes.\n Upon seeing Jiang Bi, Han Zhan thought of Han Wangwang.\n Han Wangwang, who had originally agreed to study at the Southern Medical University, suddenly went back on her words.\n He didn\u2019t know what changed her mind.\n A strange intuition told Han Zhan that Han Wangwang\u2019s sudden change of heart had something to do with Jiang Bi.\n Han Zhan instinctively looked around and heaved a sigh of relief when he didn\u2019t see Han Wangwang.\n Jiang Bi finished her etiquette and sat down. She placed the zither on the table and played an elegant tune.\n Song Ci didn\u2019t expect Jiang Bi to have such skills.\n After Jiang Bi\u2019s performance, a guest took her cell phone or bank card and went to the corner to scan the QR code to reward her.\n This was the first time Song Ci saw a club using such a method to reward someone.\n Song Ci was stunned.\n \u201cThis club is interesting. The way to earn money is so rough. I like it!\u201d\n Jiang Bi left after her performance.\n Song Ci and Han Zhan ate and drank. Shortly after, Jiang Bi, who had changed clothes, walked over.\n She was wearing a black shirt and dark blue jeans. Her long hair was casually draped behind her head.\n Jiang Bi\u2019s makeup was off and she looked clean. Her facial features were naturally perfect.\n Jiang Bi walked up to Han Zhan and Song Ci. She nodded at Song Ci and said, \u201cMrs. Han, I heard from Wangwang that you recently gained a new pair of twins. Congratulations.\u201d\n Song Ci pointed at the empty seat in front of her and said to Jiang Bi, \u201cStudent Jiang, please sit.\u201d\n Jiang Bi sat down and chatted with them.\n Song Ci said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t been going back to stay recently. Are you still staying there?\u201d\n \u201cI am.\u201d\n After chatting with Song Ci and the rest for a while, Jiang Bi looked at her watch and said, \u201cI have to go back. Otherwise, the dormitory manager will be closing up later.\u201d\n Jiang Bi stayed in school from Monday to Friday, just like Han Wangwang.\n \u201cThen go back quickly. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d Song Ci grabbed a bunch of strawberries and handed them to Jiang Bi. \u201cThe fruits are free. Eat them on the way.\u201d\n Jiang Bi caught the strawberry and left without eating it.\n Not long after Jiang Bi left, a wealthy young master sitting opposite Song Ci and the rest suddenly went crazy.\n He got up, lifted the table, grabbed his good friend\u2019s collar, and bit his face until it was a bloody mess!\n Like a zombie!\n Song Ci was shocked.\n Han Zhan hurriedly pulled Song Ci up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s too disgusting.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n",
    "236": "https://novelusb.com/novel-book/letting-loose-after-marrying-a-tycoon-novel/chapter-237\n\n Chapter 236: Remember to Close the Balcony Door Next Time, Thank You  Jiang Bi walked out of the clubhouse and walked around the carpark to her motorbike parking space.\n Under the dim moonlight, Jiang Bi walked towards her car seat. Before she got close, she saw a lady with long hair sitting in the car.\n On a cold night at the end of winter, Han Wangwang was wearing a white sweater and a black down jacket. She was sitting on Jiang Bi\u2019s motorcycle and playing with her cell phone.\n Jiang Bi stopped in her tracks when she saw Han Wangwang.\n The night light elongated Jiang Bi\u2019s figure and covered Han Wangwang\u2019s head, casting a shadow in front of her.\n Han Wangwang sensed someone approaching. She kept her cell phone and slowly turned back, and she saw Jiang Bi.\n Han Wangwang stood up from the motorcycle and looked at Jiang Bi worriedly.\n Han Wangwang was relieved to see that Jiang Bi\u2019s clothes were clean and not stained with blood.\n Han Wangwang said, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\n Jiang Bi smiled slightly, raised her right hand, and opened it. She said, \u201cThe strawberries are very sweet. They are all for you.\u201d\n The girl was slender and tall. Although her facial features were beautiful, they were aggressive. She exuded a cold aura from head to toe, but she held the strawberries and said to her, \u201cThe strawberries are very sweet. I\u2019ll give them all to you.\u201d\n Han Wangwang really wanted to ask her, Are you also very sweet?\n But she controlled herself because those words could be suspected of seducing someone.\n Han Wangwang strode over to Jiang Bi and hugged her waist. \u201cJiang Bi, don\u2019t seduce me on purpose.\u201d\n Jiang Bi was stunned.\n Jiang Bi, who was being hugged by Han Wangwang, remained motionless. Her muscles and blood froze and she forgot to move.\n Han Wangwang didn\u2019t smell the scent of blood on Jiang Bi. There was only a faint scent of rouge and powder.\n Han Wangwang was relieved.\n She said, \u201cJiang Bi, I thought you went in to kill someone.\u201d\n Jiang Bi smiled and slowly raised her right hand to pat Han Wangwang\u2019s hair. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t kill people.\u201d\n Han Wangwang said, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n Han Zhan drove Song Ci home. As the car passed by the parking lot, he saw someone standing there.\n Glancing over casually, Han Zhan saw Jiang Bi, who had just separated from them, as well as the girl hiding in Jiang Bi\u2019s arms.\n Han Zhan felt that that girl\u2019s figure was somewhat familiar.\n Han Zhan sized up that girl carefully.\n After recognizing that person, Han Zhan\u2019s brows twitched.\n He parked the car by the side of the road and opened the window. He said to Song Ci, \u201cBaby Ci, look, isn\u2019t that Han Wangwang?\u201d He didn\u2019t even call her Wangwang Doggy anymore. It was obvious that he was angry.\n Song Ci looked over in surprise and saw Han Wangwang and Jiang Bi\u2019s postures. Her expression also looked slightly unnatural.\n A hint of suspicion flashed across Song Ci\u2019s eyes.\n Song Ci said, \u201cI think it\u2019s her.\u201d\n Strange, why is Wangwang hugging Jiang Bi?\n Many strange things flashed across Han Zhan\u2019s mind. He was also afraid that he was dirty-minded and thought badly of others.\n Han Zhan tried his best to maintain his rationality, so he decided to ask his young and understanding wife.\n \u201cBaby Ci, look, is it normal for Han Wangwang to be like Jiang Bi?\u201d She felt that something was off.\n Is it normal?\n Song Ci didn\u2019t dare to make a conclusion. She said, \u201cMy good friend and I also hug frequently.\u201d\n But my good friend and I couldn\u2019t bring ourselves to be so inseparable.\n Han Zhan could only tell himself that he was overthinking things.\n Since I\u2019m overthinking...\n Beep!\n It\u2019s okay to disturb others.\n The sudden sound of a horn alerted Jiang Bi and Han Wangwang.\n Han Wangwang hurriedly let go of Jiang Bi and they turned to look at Han Zhan simultaneously.\n Through the window of the car, Han Wangwang saw Han Zhan\u2019s face in the car.\n Han Wangwang panicked the moment she saw her little uncle.\n Damn!\n \u201cLittle Uncle.\u201d\n Han Wangwang skipped over to Han Zhan\u2019s car and saw a woman sitting beside him. Han Wangwang hurriedly looked inside.\n Seeing that it was Song Ci sitting in the passenger seat, Han Wangwang said jokingly, \u201cHello, LittleAunt. I was just thinking that if the woman sitting beside my Little Uncle isn\u2019t you, I will call you later to tell on you.\u201d\n Song Ci smiled and praised Han Wangwang. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to have such awareness.\u201d\n Han Zhan asked Han Wangwang, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n Han Wangwang said, \u201cJiang Bi is performing here and I have nothing to do, so I followed her over.\u201d\n Han Zhan acknowledged.\n In the end, he couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cWhat were you guys doing just now?\u201d\n Han Wangwang was stumped and was at a loss for words.\n Jiang Bi strode over and pressed Han Wangwang into her arms. At this moment, a car roared past Jiang Bi.\n Only when it was safe did Jiang Bi release Han Wangwang. She lowered her head and said to Han Zhan, \u201cShe is cold and was looked for warmth.\u201d\n Han Zhan was stunned.\n Is that so?\n Jiang Bi\u2019s open and honest behavior dispelled Han Zhan\u2019s doubts.\n Perhaps young people nowadays were so passionate and liked to express their friendship by hugging and lifting each other up high.\n I am too old to keep up with the trends.\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t probe further into Han Wangwang and Jiang Bi\u2019s relationship. He started the car again and said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Come to your great-grandfather\u2019s house to play some other day and visit the two little guys.\u201d\n With that, Han Zhan added. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t come empty-handed.\u201d\n Han Zhan drove off.\n Han Wangwang stuck out her tongue guiltily, but her back was already sweating profusely.\n Jiang Bi stared at Han Wangwang\u2019s slightly uneasy face under the night sky. A strange feeling flashed across her heart.\n Jiang Bi asked Han Wangwang, \u201cWhat are you afraid of? Are you afraid of your little uncle?\u201d\n Han Wangwang replied instinctively, \u201cHow can I not be afraid? He saw everything!\u201d\n Jiang Bi asked another soul-stirring question. \u201cWhat are you afraid of? We didn\u2019t do anything. Aren\u2019t all girls like this? We hold hands and each other\u2019s arms on the streets. We even have to feed each other during dessert. Being even more intimate than others.\u201d\n Jiang Bi saw that many girls were like this, sticky and clingy.\n So, why is Han Wangwang feeling guilty?\n Han Wangwang was rooted to the spot by Jiang Bi\u2019s question.\n Why am I feeling guilty?\n Han Wangwang\u2019s heart was racing.\n She looked up at Jiang Bi and said, \u201cJiang Bi, if you were a boy, I am willing to lose my virginity before marriage for you.\u201d\n Jiang Bi\u2019s gaze deepened. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n Han Wangwang turned and walked towards the motorcycle, not daring to look at Jiang Bi\u2019s expression.\n What she said just now was equivalent to a confession.\n Jiang Bi smiled and followed Han Wangwang.\n Jiang Bi sat cross-legged in the car and handed Han Wangwang a helmet. Han Wangwang wore the helmet and hugged Jiang Bi\u2019s slender and alluring waist.\n The two of them were about to leave when Han Wangwang noticed an ambulance approaching.\n A large group of people came out of the clubhouse. They were talking about things like \u2018zombies\u2019, \u2018scarring\u2019, \u2018seeing a ghost\u2019.\n \u201cWait a minute.\u201d Han Wangwang told Jiang Bi not to rush into driving.\n Jiang Bi stopped and looked at the entrance with Han Wangwang.\n The clubhouse\u2019s security guards brought the injured out and sent him to the ambulance. Shortly after, the police car also arrived and two police officers entered the clubhouse to understand the situation.\n Meanwhile, the nosy crowd was still standing at the entrance of the clubhouse muttering non-stop.\n Han Wangwang listened carefully and roughly understood what had happened at the clubhouse.\n Someone suddenly lost control of himself, grabbed his friend and bit his face.\n It was like a rabies attack.\n Han Wangwang gave Jiang Bi a meaningful look.\n In the dark, Jiang Bi\u2019s expression was cold. She narrowed her eyes slightly, looking very cold.\n Han Wangwang told herself that Jiang Bi had been out for so long and this definitely had nothing to do with her. She just happened to come here to perform and encountered this incident.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, there\u2019s nothing to see. Sit tight. I\u2019m driving.\u201d\n \u2013\n On the way, they passed by a supper shop. Han Zhan slowed down and asked Song Ci, \u201cDo you want supper? There\u2019s a barbeque shop here.\u201d\n They were originally going to eat and drink in the clubhouse with an empty stomach, but the sudden change disrupted their plans.\n Song Ci\u2019s mind was filled with that person\u2019s mangled face.\n She felt like vomiting but held it in.\n Hearing Han Zhan say supper or barbeque...\n Song Ci suddenly knocked on the car door and said to Han Zhan, \u201cStop the car!\u201d\n Han Zhan was so scared that he hurriedly stopped the car.\n Song Ci got out of the car. As soon as her feet touched the ground, she bent over and vomited violently beside the car.\n Han Zhan was momentarily stunned.\n He took out a bottle of water, walked out of the driver\u2019s seat, went to the passenger\u2019s seat, and fed the water to Song Ci to rinse her mouth.\n After vomiting, Song Ci returned to the car and laid on the car seat like a boneless worm.\n Rubbing her starving stomach, she said to Han Zhan, \u201cBrother Han, what do you think happened to that person?\u201d\n \u201cIs it rabies?\u201d\n Han Zhan shook his head. \u201cPeople with rabies don\u2019t bite. A real rabies attack results in typhoid, fear of water, and muscle spasms.\u201d\n \u201cThen what\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d Song Ci didn\u2019t believe that that person was ill.\n This is not a zombie movie.\n Han Zhan thought for a moment before saying, \u201cKind of like a drug.\u201d\n ]Song Ci nodded vigorously. \u201cI know. There is a drug that will cause hallucinations. In the past, there was a drug addict in America who tore at passersby.\u201d\n \u201cMmm, maybe that kind. This is too scary.\u201d\n Han Zhan said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, the police will deal with them.\u201d\n Han Zhan parked the car at the entrance of the community and went to the supermarket to buy some noodles, eggs and sausages.\n Walking up to the cashier, he selected another box of condoms from the shelf.\n After reaching home, Han Zhan said to Song Ci, \u201cGo take a shower.\u201d\n Song Ci saw the invitation and hint in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes.\n Her heartbeat quickened.\n I-Is it happening?\n Song Ci stayed in the bathroom for a long time.\n As she showered, she stared at the C-section scar on her stomach and the six to seven pregnancy marks that affected her beauty.\n Song Ci frowned in frustration.\n Han Zhan also took a shower downstairs.\n Song Ci walked out of the salon and was about to go downstairs, when she saw Han Zhan sitting on the sofa in a bathrobe.\n He was drinking water and a Jackie Chan movie was playing on the television in front of him.\n Hearing footsteps, Han Zhan looked up.\n Song Ci stood behind the railing of the duplex. Her hair was casually tied up with a rubber band, exposing her forehead and neck.\n A few strands of hair fell over her forehead.\n Song Ci had just taken a shower and her porcelain-white face was slightly red, giving off a coquettish allure.\n Han Zhan patted the sofa beside him. \u201cBaby Ci, come down.\u201d\n Song Ci walked down but didn\u2019t sit down.\n Standing in front of Han Zhan, Song Ci took the initiative to undo the straps of her bathrobe.\n Han Zhan stared at her with scorching eyes, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing.\n Song Ci opened her bathrobe.\n She openly appeared in front of Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan\u2019s breathing was labored and his eyes darkened.\n He was about to move when Song Ci suddenly said, \u201cI have something to say to you.\u201d\n Han Zhan stopped and sat on the sofa, looking up at Song Ci.\n \u201cTell me.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s fingers gently slid across her abdomen. She said, \u201cThis scar can\u2019t be completely removed with scar cream. These pregnancy marks have already torn open my skin and it can\u2019t grow back.\u201d\n \u201cHan Zhan, these ugly things will accompany me for life. In the future, every time you see me, you will see them.\u201d\n Han Zhan stared at those scars.\n Song Ci\u2019s skin was very fair and smooth in the past. To be honest, pregnancy marks and scars did damage her perfection.\n But Han Zhan didn\u2019t find it ugly.\n He never thought of them as ugly.\n Song Ci told Han Zhan, \u201cYou can\u2019t despise them or use them to slander me or joke around with me. They are a part of my body and given to me by you and the child. Everyone has the right to despise them except you and the children.\u201d\n Han Zhan looked at Song Ci seriously. \u201cI won\u2019t despise them.\u201d\n He pulled Song Ci to him, lowered his head, and kissed her scar.\n Han Zhan hugged Song Ci\u2019s waist, lifted his head, and said, \u201cLook, they are not ugly.\u201d\n Song Ci nodded.\n She cupped Han Zhan\u2019s head and told him, \u201cYou can do anything to me.\u201d\n Han Zhan was overjoyed at the encouragement.\n That night, they carefully worked together from the beginning to the end.\n \u2013\n Late at night, Song Ci was still hungry.\n Han Zhan had already expected Song Ci to be hungry. He only wore a pair of pants and went to the kitchen to cook a bowl of egg and sausage noodles for her.\n Song Ci finished a bowl of noodles and fell asleep guiltily.\n The next morning, Han Zhan and Song Ci had breakfast downstairs.\n Han Zhan said to Song Ci, \u201cYou\u2019re going on a work trip tomorrow. Come with me to the office today to play and accompany me, alright?\u201d\n Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear to part with the children and Han Zhan couldn\u2019t bear to part with her.\n Song Ci looked at Han Zhan in amusement and asked him, \u201cYou can\u2019t bear to leave me?\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d Han Zhan admitted openly.\n Song Ci nodded. \u201cOkay, you need to provide my food and accommodation.\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d\n On the way to the office, Song Ci had nothing to do and played with her cell phone.\n She opened her WeChat and saw that everyone was talking about what happened at the club last night.\n Song Ci scrolled through their comments and realized that the news had already spread the night before.\n \u201cLast night, the person who bit someone was the young master of Chengbei An Family. The person who was bitten was a good friend of his. His surname was Mo.\u201d\n \u201cThat Mo guy went for a freeloading party with that An guy. Unexpectedly, that An guy suddenly went crazy and bit that Mo guy.\u201d\n \u201cThat person surnamed An has some background. He was released last night. After he came out, Young Master An went to the hospital to visit his good friend who was bitten by him. But that person surnamed Mo might be angry. This morning, in the ward, that person surnamed Mo slit Young Master An\u2019s neck with a knife.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t expect things to turn out this way.\n \u201cIt\u2019s understandable for the person with the surname Mo to do this.\u201d Song Ci understood the victim very well.\n \u201cA perfectly fine face was bitten and disfigured by Young Master An. I thought that Young Master An would at least be jailed for two years. Unexpectedly, Young Master An has a strong background and was released that night.\u201d\n ]\u201dI can understand why that Mo guy killed someone in a fit of anger.\u201d\n Han Zhan didn\u2019t comment on this.\n He said, \u201cAfter killing the young master of the An Family, that Mo guy was momentarily satisfied, but he will have to bear the revenge of the An Family for the rest of his life.\u201d\n A moment of pleasure after killing someone, a lifetime of misery after that.\n Han Zhan suddenly said to Song Ci, \u201cThere\u2019s an old machine in the glove compartment. Help me take it out.\u201d\n Song Ci opened the glove box skeptically and really saw an old machine inside.\n It was that kind of black, cumbersome old man machine.\n It had been many years since she last saw such an old antique. Song Ci couldn\u2019t help taking a few more glances.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cTurn it on and give it to me.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci turned on the old cell phone. Hearing the clunky music, she handed the cell phone to Han Zhan with a dark expression.\n Han Zhan pressed a number and dialed it without hesitation.\n ]Song Ci heard Han Zhan say \u2014\n \u201cHello, is this the Drug Enforcement Unit? I want to report a suspected drug abuse case. Yes, it happened last night at the nightclub. The drug addict\u2019s surname is An...\u201d\n \u201cMe?\u201d\n \u201c...I am just a passionate civilian.\u201d\n Han Zhan hung up.\n Seeing Song Ci\u2019s shocked expression, Han Zhan smiled at her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to report someone taking drugs.\u201d\n \u201cBrother Han, you are so scheming.\u201d\n Han Zhan handed the cell phone to Song Ci. \u201cPut it back.\u201d\n Song Ci threw her cell phone into the glove box and asked Han Zhan curiously, \u201cBrother Han, do you often do such immoral things?\u201d\n \u201cNo way, who knows I did it?\u201d\n Song Ci was speechless.\n Arriving at the office, Han Zhan immersed himself in his work.\n A few days ago, a few Australian investors who wanted to invest in the aviation tourism industry came to Wangdong City. Bei Zhan had been accompanying them these few days. After three days, Bei Zhan finally signed a contract with them.\n Once the contract was signed, they would be friends.\n The Australian investors had always wanted to meet Han Zhan, but he had used the excuse of being busy with work to reject them.\n After they signed the contract and everyone became friends, Han Zhan finally \u201chad time\u201d.\n After lunch, Han Zhan took the initiative to call the investor representative. He said that he was free in the afternoon and that the weather was sunny. He wanted to invite them to ride horses at the horse farm in the suburbs.\n The other party agreed readily.\n Song Ci slept for 40 minutes before Han Zhan woke her up. She changed into the sportswear and sneakers that he had prepared for her and went to the racecourse with Han Zhan.\n Song Ci knew how to ride a horse, but her horsemanship was average and she didn\u2019t dare to play any tricks.\n There was a 40 year old female manager among the investors. That woman was very tall and muscular. She was very good at horse riding.\n Seeing Song Ci looking at her in admiration, the woman called Josephine stopped her horse in front of Song Ci.\n \u201cSong, do you want to play with me?\u201d\n Song Ci immediately abandoned her pony and boarded Josephine\u2019s horse.\n Song Ci sat in Josephine\u2019s arms. Josephine chatted with her in English as she controlled the horse beneath her. The two of them enjoyed themselves at the racecourse.\n After Han Zhan finished riding, he handed the horse to the stable boy.\n Glancing at Song Ci, who was having a good time with Josephine, Han Zhan decided not to disturb them.\n He walked under the sunshade chair and sat down with a few male investors. As soon as he sat down, he heard Eric say, \u201cHan, you must be careful of Josephine. She has very good flirting skills.\u201d\n Han Zhan smiled enigmatically. \u201cShe\u2019s not my type. I love my wife deeply and no one can affect our relationship.\u201d\n Hearing this, everyone looked at Han Zhan with an interesting and strange expression.\n Han Zhan frowned.\n He thought*: Is there something wrong?*\n \u201cHan.\u201d Eric said earnestly, \u201cJosephine likes girls.\u201d\n Han Zhan\u2019s expression changed slightly.\n \u201cYou have to be careful of her.\u201d\n Everyone looked up at Josephine and the Chinese beauty in her arms, gloating slightly.\n Han Zhan\u2019s smile disappeared completely.\n He looked at Josephine and Song Ci again and felt that they were sitting too close. Were there no horses at the racecourse? Why did she want to ride the same horse as Song Ci?\n After two laps, Song Ci realized that the straps of her sneakers had loosened. She said to Josephine, \u201cAlright, Josephine. I want to rest. Put me down.\u201d\n \u201cSure!\u201d\n Josephine ordered the horse to stop. She jumped off the horse and reached out to Song Ci in a gentlemanly manner.\n At this moment, a long arm reached over rudely, grabbed Song Ci\u2019s soft hand, and pulled her down.\n Song Ci thanked Josephine before squatting down to tie her loose laces.\n Han Zhan looked at Josephine up close and smiled. \u201cMy wife is very beautiful and charming, right?\u201d\n Josephine saw hostility in Han Zhan\u2019s eyes.\n She didn\u2019t want to offend Han Zhan and just smiled kindly. \u201cMadam is very charming. I think Mr. Han and Madam have a very close relationship and must be an enviable pair.\u201d\n Only then was Han Zhan relieved.\n He helped Song Ci fasten her other shoelace and pulled her under the umbrella to chat with the others.\n At night, after having a meal with this group of people, Han Zhan and Song Ci returned home.\n The two children happened to be awake. Han Zhan carried them up and placed them on the thick carpet, teasing them with toys.\n With just a little teasing, the elder sister would smile. The younger sister would smile occasionally, but most of the time, she was sizing up Song Ci and Han Zhan.\n \u201cMiaomiao, Junjun, Mother is going to America tomorrow.\u201d Song Ci couldn\u2019t bear to part with her daughters.\n She laid down beside Han Jun and played with her little fingers.\n Song Ci started to miss them even before she eft.\n Han Zhan said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a break midway? You can come back.\u201d\n \u201cThere are a few days off between the French and Chinese venues. We can indeed come back. But the first few rounds are too close and there\u2019s only enough time for a round trip.\u201d\n With that, Song Ci smelled a stench.\n She poked Han Zhan\u2019s arm. \u201cBrother Han, is it the elder sister or the younger sister who is smelly?\u201d\n Han Zhan first opened the younger sister\u2019s diapers and took a look. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Miaomiao.\u201d\n Han Zhan carried Miaomiao over to the nanny.\n After Miaomiao washed her butt, Han Zhan carried her back.\n Song Ci was fiddling with her selfie stick.\n \u201cBrother Han, sit down here with Miaomiao in your arms. Let\u2019s take a photo together.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Song Ci and Han Zhan sat cross-legged together with their heads leaning against each other. Each of them had a baby in their arms.\n Song Ci raised her selfie stick and found an angle. When she was about to take a photo, she saw that Han Zhan didn\u2019t smile.\n Song Ci rolled her eyes at Han Zhan and lectured him. \u201cYou have to smile when taking a family photo, understand? The sillier you smile, the happier you will be.\u201d\n Han Zhan grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.\n Song Ci accepted her fate. \u201cBrother Han, I think you shouldn\u2019t smile.\u201d\n When Han Zhan purposely put on a smile, he looked like a shark.\n It was funny and awkward.\n Han Zhan pursed his lips and stared at the camera seriously.\n Song Ci took the photo and checked it. \u201cI will send you the photo.\u201d\n Song Ci sent the photo to Han Zhan\u2019s WeChat before putting the sisters back into the crib.\n \u201cI am going to pack my luggage. Brother Han, are you coming with me?\u201d\n \u201cComing.\u201d\n \u2013\n Song Ci had brought two suitcases on this business trip.\n The next morning, after breakfast, Han Zhan helped Song Ci put her luggage in the boot of the car.\n He stared at the two big boxes and teased Song Ci. \u201cShould I find a small van to fetch you when you come back?\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t understand what Han Zhan meant. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Han Zhan explained. \u201cAccording to your shopping skills, there will be two suitcases when you go and there will definitely be eight to nine when you return, so you need a small van to transport them.\u201d\n Hearing this, Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n \u201cI will try my best to buy as little things as possible.\u201d Song Ci herself felt that this statement was especially unreliable. It had been a long time since she last shopped. If she suddenly went overseas, she would definitely buy whatever she wanted.\n In the past, she only bought things for herself. But now, she still had to buy things for her grandfather, Han Zhan, her two babies, as well as Song Fei and Yan Jiang.\n Eight to nine suitcases might not even be enough.\n Han Zhan sent Song Ci to the airport. The two of them stayed in the waiting room for a while. Once the time was up, Song Ci boarded the plane and flew to America.\n On this business trip, Song Ci even brought her personal stylist, Aaron, with her.\n Aaron knew Song Ci the best. Every time she attended an event, he would dress her up beautifully.\n This time, Song Ci also handed the responsibility of styling herself to Aaron.\n Song Ci knew her position very well. She just needed to be beautiful.\n At the press conference in New York, Song Ci was wearing a blue V-neck dress with a golden belt around her waist.\n She was only wearing a pair of pearl earrings.\n Standing on stage, she was like a walking flower.\n At the movie promotional event, Song Ci even performed the violin for the reporters.\n At first, everyone thought Song Ci was just a pretty vase.\n However, the moment Song Ci touched the violin, she instantly entered a trance-like state.\n Song Ci was the main character of the world when she played the violin. All the attention was on her.\n Only after seeing Song Ci\u2019s talent display did everyone view her in a new light.\n Du Junfei pretended to be careless and purposely leaked the fact that Song Ci was Shen Yubei\u2019s beloved disciple. As a result, that day, the reporters from the New York tabloids commented on Song Ci like this \u2014\n Song Ci, a beautiful and multi-talented Chinese girl. She had a sexy, graceful figure, a beautiful face, and even wonderful violin skills.\n She was a new actress born for Rain.\n Naturally, Song Ci also saw the news about herself in the New York entertainment news. She felt that it was unreal.\n Song Ci secretly poked Han Zhan\u2019s WeChat and asked him: [Brother Han, did you buy the news for me?]\n After more than 10 minutes, Han Zhan replied: [I can\u2019t let them slander you.]\n In order to bribe the boss of New York Entertainment News, Han Zhan promised to give him a free ticket to travel in Zeus Number 1.\n Song Ci knew it would be like that.\n Foreigners were very against Chinese people. It was already merciful of them not to mock her. How could they be willing to praise her?\n After knowing that Han Zhan had bought this title, Song Ci felt that it was boring.\n The second stop was England.\n The third stop was France.\n Wherever Song Ci went, the most famous local entertainment news website would definitely praise her.\n Anyone with eyes could tell that someone was spending money to flatter Song Ci.\n But Song Ci didn\u2019t feel embarrassed. Her husband was willing to spend money to promote her. Whoever was unhappy would shut up.\n After the publicity event at the French station, Song Ci went home for a few days.\n The two children were about to forget about Song Ci.\n When Song Ci got home and carried them, they were still crying.\n The children\u2019s resistance to her hurt Song Ci slightly.\n But she had no choice. Song Ci planned to use these few days of rest to mend her relationship with the children.\n The children were slightly older and were not as obedient as during their confinement period. They were dozing off less and less, and even loved to cry and throw a tantrum before sleeping at night.\n Song Ci told them stories, but the two children were still young and didn\u2019t understand fables.\n Song Ci recalled that when she was young, Jiang Shiyu would always play the violin to coax the two sisters to sleep.\n With the intention of giving it a try, Song Ci also took out her violin and played \u2018Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\u2019 for her daughters.\n Strangely, under the hypnosis of the tune, the sisters actually really quietened down very quickly.\n They fell asleep.\n Song Ci put down her violin and turned to see Han Zhan leaning against the door frame.\n Han Zhan smiled blissfully.\n When Song Ci looked over, Han Zhan didn\u2019t even have the time to hide his smile.\n Song Ci opened her arms to Han Zhan.\n Han Zhan walked over and bent over to hug Song Ci.\n \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d\n \u201cMmm.\u201d\n \u201cHave a good rest for a few days since you\u2019re come back. After the publicity at the last stop ends, I will bring you and the children out for a holiday.\u201d\n \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n \u201cMmm, how about Sanya?\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Sanya was rather warm recently and the sun was not scorching, so it was more suitable for travel.\n The husband and wife returned to their small room. Han Zhan bit Song Ci\u2019s ear as he said, \u201cIn the few days that you were gone, I relied on those photos of you to fall asleep.\u201d\n Song Ci\u2019s ears turned red. \u201cHow did you fall asleep?\u201d\n Han Zhan said something dirty in her ear.\n Song Ci kicked Han Zhan away and scolded him. \u201cYou are shameless!\u201d\n Han Zhan grabbed Song Ci\u2019s feet and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we last met. Even looking at your feet now, I find them beautiful and moving.\u201d\n Song Ci didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\n After being played by Han Zhan for a long time, she laid down on the bed in exhaustion and didn\u2019t move at all.\n After more than 10 days apart, Han Zhan couldn\u2019t bear to let go of Song Ci\u2019s waist even when he slept at night.\n He hugged her and slept the entire night.\n The next morning, Han Zhan felt his arm ache.\n But seeing that Song Ci was still snoring softly beside him, Han Zhan felt that everything was worth it.\n After staying at home for six days, Song Ci had to set off for Yu City.\n The promotional event at Yu City on March 12 was the last stop.\n On the 11th, Song Ci arrived at Yu City and went to the airport to fetch Du Junfei.\n Along with Du Junfei was the male lead, Damien.\n This Oscar-winning actor and future top Hollywood superstar even prepared a gift for Song Ci\u2019s children.\n It was two sets of Barbie dolls.\n Song Ci thanked Damien, before leading them into the car and returning to the hotel.\n Along the way, Du Junfei told Song Ci, \u201cDu Xueyan will also be attending tomorrow\u2019s publicity event. Her flight will arrive in the afternoon and we will have dinner together tonight.\u201d\n It had been a long time since Song Ci had heard Du Xueyan\u2019s name.\n Du Xueyan suddenly left the country a few months ago and announced that she was officially entering Hollywood.\n She didn\u2019t know who was praising her, but she actually used quite a few resources in that man-eating Hollywood.\n Du Xueyan was supposed to attend the New York promotional event the previous time, but the production cycle of her movie was rather tight and she couldn\u2019t spare the time, so she didn\u2019t attend.\n Hearing Du Xueyan\u2019s name again, Song Ci\u2019s heart was as still as water.\n She knew very well that there was nothing between Du Xueyan and Han Zhan. It was impossible.\n Damien said, \u201cI even had a meal with Xueyan last month. She has very good resources now and is likely to become the hottest Asian movie star in Hollywood.\u201d\n Du Junfei knew what Damien was hinting at. He was saying that Du Xueyan had found a big sugar daddy.\n Du Junfei didn\u2019t jump into the language trap that Damien had dug for him. He said, \u201cEveryone has their own luck, especially in a place like Hollywood.\u201d\n Seeing that Du Junfei was unwilling to reveal any information about Du Xueyan\u2019s sugar daddy, Damien didn\u2019t pursue the matter.\n Du Junfei glanced at Song Ci and spoke in Chinese. \u201cI heard from Shen Yubei that Du Xueyan had an affair with your husband?\u201d\n Song Ci retorted. \u201cWhat do you mean by having an affair? That was eight to nine years ago. At that time, they were a serious couple. It would be terrible to say that they had an affair.\u201d\n \u201cOh, you\u2019re quite protective of your man.\u201d\n Song Ci retorted. \u201cIf I don\u2019t protect my man, should I side with you instead, Second Master?\u201d\n Everyone had their own taboo topic, so Du Junfei wouldn\u2019t tease Song Ci about this.\n Du Junfei knew when to stop.\n He told Song Ci, \u201cDu Xueyan is a very ambitious and arrogant woman. Since the matter between her and your man is over, she will never rise again. Moreover, she has Gu Shengyao keeping an eye on her. Du Xueyan doesn\u2019t have the time to come back and harass your man.\u201d\n Song Ci could tell what he meant and was slightly surprised. \u201cSecond Old Master, are you saying that Du Xueyan\u2019s manager likes Du Xueyan?\u201d\n Du Junfei said, \u201cThat\u2019s why I said you have bad eyesight. You can\u2019t even tell such a simple thing.\u201d\n Song Ci was blind and indeed couldn\u2019t tell.\n She really hoped that Gu Shengyao could take down Du Xueyan as soon as possible and have a blissful marriage with her.\n \u2013\n In the afternoon, Du Xueyan had indeed come to Yu City and checked into Ankai International Hotel.\n Her room was next to Song Ci\u2019s.\n At dinner that night, Du Junfei sat between Song Ci and Du Xueyan considerately as the delectable content in the sandwich\n The meal was rather peaceful.\n At night, the two little ancestors at home refused to sleep.\n Recently, it had become a habit for them to listen to Song Ci play the violin and fall asleep.\n Song Ci suddenly left home and the little guys couldn\u2019t fall asleep without their mother\u2019s music.\n Helpless, Han Zhan could only video call Song Ci and trouble her to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to coax the children to sleep.\n Song Ci played a little star. Seeing that the children were really asleep, she felt slightly proud. \u201cBrother Han, you are not a good father. You don\u2019t even have the skills to coax children to sleep.\u201d\n \u201cMy wife is awesome.\u201d\n Han Zhan flattered Song Ci and made her happy. Only then did they hang up.\n After hanging up, Song Ci felt slightly sleepy.\n Before they got married, Song Ci wouldn\u2019t consider sleeping until 12.30am. But now, at such a young age, she had developed the habit of wanting to sleep at 10.30pm.\n Song Ci laid down on the bed and was in a daze when she suddenly heard someone crying next door.\n Song Ci opened her eyes and realized that the sound of crying was coming from outside the balcony.\n Every room had a balcony. If the balcony window was open, the commotion in the room next door could be heard.\n What is Du Xueyan crying for?\n Song Ci thought that Du Xueyan was in some kind of trouble and hesitated over whether to go next door and knock to ask about her condition.\n Just then, Song Ci heard a low male voice. \u201cJust a few more minutes.\u201d\n Du Xueyan begged. \u201cPlease, hurry up!\u201d\n Realizing what was happening next door, Song Ci felt like she had been struck by lightning!\n Du Xueyan was indeed crying, but not from sadness, but from pleasure.\n Song Ci felt very tired.\n It was fine if she was out on a work trip alone, but she had to stay in a hotel, listen to Han Zhan\u2019s ex-girlfriend and manager stirring up trouble in the room.\n Song Ci\u2019s heart felt extremely bleak.\n She covered her head with the blanket and fell asleep after a long while.\n The press conference was held downstairs of the hotel. Song Ci was dressed up and walked out of the room with her dress. At this moment, the door to the room next door opened.\n Du Xueyan also walked out.\n Song Ci was wearing a black tube dress, while Du Xueyan was wearing a white tube dress.\n Both of them had their own beauty.\n Walking into the lift, Du Xueyan said to Song Ci, \u201cAre you in a bad mood?\u201d\n Song Ci was puzzled. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\n Du Xueyan said, \u201cYou look slightly tired.\u201d\n Song Ci sneered. \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d\n Hearing this, Du Xueyan was slightly surprised. \u201cWhy is it me?\u201d Du Xueyan thought for a moment and understood. \u201cAre you still concerned about me and Han Zhan?\u201d\n Song Ci said, \u201cNo, you guys caused quite a stir last night. I was forced to listen for more than half an hour and couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d\n Du Xueyan\u2019s face turned red.\n \u201cIs... is the hotel\u2019s soundproofing so bad?\u201d She blushed.\n Song Ci snorted. \u201cRemember to close the balcony door in the future. Thank you.\u201d\n64a4499883e41362e4a34f7b\n\n"
