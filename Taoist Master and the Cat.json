When she got home, Grandma Tao started cooking. Xie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao who was sitting on the carpet eating dried fish with a serious face, and said, \u201cA little snack is enough. You are so greedy. If a stranger lures you into a car with dried fish, will you follow him?\u201d\nAfter chewing the dried fish, Su Miaomiao said, \u201cI\u2019m not that stupid. Mom and dad said that I can\u2019t go with strangers.\u201d\nShe was just a three-year-old child with no strength. Su Miaomiao always kept her parents\u2019 instructions on safety in her mind.\nAccording to her, people in that world could even build airplanes, so the means of abducting children must be more varied than in ancient times.\nWhile talking, Su Miaomiao ate the five small dried fish.\nSu Miaomiao licked her lips and looked at Xie Jingyuan, \u201cMaster, you don\u2019t like fish, can you give me your bag of dried fish?\u201d\n\u201cThis kind of snack can only be eaten once a week.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was very aware of his uncompromising temper, curled her lips, and muttered in a low voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t give it to me, I\u2019ll ask my parents to buy it for me.\u201d\n\u201cBuy it. If you eat too much of it, your teeth will rot, then uncle and aunt will take you to the hospital for injections and tooth extraction.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cGo rinse your mouth first, you smell fishy.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was a clean cat, as long as Xie Jingyuan showed such a disgusted expression, she would obediently clean up.\nWhen she came back after rinsing her mouth, she saw Xie Jingyuan staring out of the window again.\n\u201cMaster, what are you thinking?\u201d Su Miaomiao was quite curious.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her and said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about how to make money. Grandma is getting old, we can\u2019t always spend her money.\u201d\nAs for the pocket money given to him by Xie Rong, he handed it all over to Grandma Tao.\nHe didn\u2019t have any extra expenses at the moment, but Su Miaomiao was greedy. She was greedy for dried fish, and next day she may be greedy for other snacks, so as to prevent her from developing a bad habit of stealing, Xie Jingyuan felt that he needed to save some money to deal with her occasional needs.\nHe had arrested Su Miaomiao and taken her to the temple before, so she was reincarnated with him. Xie Jingyuan had the responsibility to take care of the cat and not give her a chance to cause harm to the world.\n\u201cIs grandma out of money? It doesn\u2019t matter, my parents have money. I can ask them for it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had no sense of money worries.\nAs a cat, she was also very good at observing her surroundings. With Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei\u2019s financial situation, it was no problem to support her for a lifetime.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her meaningfully, \u201cParents have the responsibility to raise you until the age of eighteen. After the age of eighteen, you have to learn to be self-reliant.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was ignorant.\nXie Jingyuan went a little deeper, \u201cStudy hard, get admitted to a good university, and it will be easier to find a good job with a high salary after graduation.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood the meaning of work.\nCouples like Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei had to go to work almost every day, stuck in one place, and couldn\u2019t go home as they pleased.\nSu Miaomiao lay down, rubbed Xie Jingyuan\u2019s leg with the top of her head like a cat, faced him on her back and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to work. When my parents don\u2019t support me, you support me, okay?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao, who hadn\u2019t fully understood the world\u2019s ways of life, really believed that her parents would abandon her after turning eighteen years old.\nAfter all, she was a wild cat without parents in her previous life.\nIf the cultivation base was still there, Su Miaomiao could be self-reliant, but that cultivation base was gone, and she didn\u2019t want to eat dirty mice. Su Miaomiao wanted to return to the way of life in Qingxu Temple, and let Xie Jingyuan continue to provide her with food and daily needs.\nXie Jingyuan looked indifferent, \u201cI can raise a cat, but you are a human being now, and as a human being, you must learn to support yourself.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao sighed in disappointment.\nAfter all, being a cat was more comfortable than being a human.\nEvening was the time for Su Miaomiao to be with her parents.\nTang Shiwei sensitively noticed that her daughter looked at them in a wrong way, as if she felt a little wronged.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Miaomiao, is someone bullying you in kindergarten?\u201d Tang Shiwei gave Su Mingan a look and asked gently.\nSu Mingan didn\u2019t care about it on the surface, but he actually raised his ears. If someone dared to bully his daughter, he would definitely vent his anger on his daughter\u2019s behalf.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s face was full of sadness as she said, \u201cWhen I am eighteen, will you both not want me?\u201d\nThe way cat parents stopped raising kittens was to drive them away and then disappear.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cHow can that be? Miaomiao, you are our daughter, so we have to be with you.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cThat\u2019s right, Miao Miao tell me, who told you this?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cBrother, he said that you will only support me until I am eighteen, and then I will have to be self-reliant.\u201d\nTang Shiwei smiled, \u201cBrother means, Miaomiao will be an adult at the age of eighteen. You can make some decisions on your own, and you can work and earn money after graduation, just like your parents.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked and confirmed, \u201cThen, if I\u2019m not good and don\u2019t want to work, will you both continue to support me?\u201d\nSu Mingan didn\u2019t think about it, he said,\u00a0 \u201cOf course, Dad will work hard to earn a lot of money, and it will be fine to raise Miao Miao for several lifetimes.\u201d\nTang Shiwei coughed. Even though it was true, they also wanted to encourage their daughter to make progress. Could it be that they really expected their daughter to accomplish nothing?\nSu Mingan understood what his wife meant, and quickly changed his words.\nBut Su Miaomiao already understood that in this life, she no longer had to worry about being abandoned by her parents.\nThe Taoist said so because he didn\u2019t have a mother, and his father was with another woman, so he prepared to be self-reliant early.\nWhat a pity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "21": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-21/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout Su Miaomiao\u2019s knowledge, Tang Shiwei and Su Mingan had a small quarrel.\nThe trigger for this quarrel was Tang Shiwei who discovered that Su Mingan secretly indulged his daughter in eating dried fish snacks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many things are added to it. It\u2019s okay to eat it occasionally. But you are feeding that to Miao Miao every day. Do you want her to eat junk and grow a weak body?\u201d\nSu Mingan shrank his head and dared not make a sound.\nIn fact, he understood the truth, but whenever his daughter leaned over cutely, shook his arm, called him daddy repeatedly, and looked at him eagerly with those big watery eyes, Su Mingan couldn\u2019t bear to refuse.\n\u201cI see. I won\u2019t buy it for her in the future unless you agree.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s best to do so. If I find out you did it again, you will move to another room to sleep!\u201d\nTang Shiwei, who had a gentle and sweet appearance, had a decisive attitude when speaking cruel words.\nSu Mingan really didn\u2019t dare to offend his wife anymore.\nAs soon as he betrayed Su Miaomiao, the snack supply was cut off. She went to pester her father again, who told his daughter with a worried face, \u201cYour mother said, if I buy it for you again, she will drive me back to grandpa\u2019s home, and not want me anymore.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao believed it to be true, and in order to let her father stay at home, she finally agreed to obediently abide by the snack distribution arrangements of Tang Shiwei, Grandma Tao and Xie Jingyuan.\nNot long after the kindergarten started, Su Miaomiao became the bully that no one else in the class except Xie Jingyuan dared to provoke.\nIt was true that she had never bullied anyone, but she ran fast, jumped high, and was fierce when she lost her temper. Even the teacher couldn\u2019t help her. How could ordinary children not be afraid of her?\nTherefore, whenever Su Miaomiao wanted to play, the children in the second class would spontaneously let her play. However, Su Miaomiao saved the teacher a lot of worry.\nIt was just that the children in class two were afraid of Su Miaomiao, while the bullies in other classes, especially middle class and senior class, hadn\u2019t heard of Su Miaomiao\u2019s name.\nAnother day of extracurricular activities, Su Miaomiao ecstatically ran up and down the slide.\nOn her head was a pink headband newly given by her mother, with two pink strawberry ornaments hanging from it. The little strawberry was smooth, reflecting the sunlight with Su Miaomiao bouncing around, shining brightly, attracting the attention of many girls.\nSome little boys liked to bully girls, or pull girls\u2019 pigtails, or snatch girls\u2019 hair ropes.\nSu Miaomiao just entered kindergarten, and she had never encountered such a thing. Just that day, when she was about to run up the slide, a hand suddenly stretched out from behind, grabbed her strawberry hair rope and pulled it down.\nHer hair was pulled, and Su Miaomiao covered her head in pain, but she took a step too late, the hair rope had already been snatched away.\nSu Miaomiao stared back.\nChen Shuo shook the hair rope toward her.\nSu Miaomiao recognized Chen Shuo. This fat boy lived in the same community as them, and he was studying in a senior class that year.\n\u201cGive it back to me!\u201d Su Miaomiao said unhappily.\nChen Shuo: \u201cI won\u2019t give it back, you come and grab it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao jumped up, startling the children around her.\nChen Shuo was stunned, and quickly grabbed the strawberry hair rope and ran to his class.\nSu Miaomiao was really angry.\nWhen she was a cat, she was often bullied by big and old demons. Why would an ordinary kid dare to bully her?!\nChen Shuo was five years old and ran very fast, but Su Miaomiao ran even faster. When the distance was close enough, Su Miaomiao jumped out and threw herself at him.\nThump!\nChen Shuo lay on the ground, with Su Miaomiao on his back.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t bother with the hair rope, and slapped his shoulders, \u201cWhy are you stealing my things?!\u201d\nChen Shuo fell in pain. He was spoiled at home, and was rarely wronged. His own mother had never beaten him, how could he obediently let Su Miaomiao beat him?\nNo matter how much Su Miaomiao could use spiritual energy, she was too small, not as tall and strong as Chen Shuo.\nChen Shuo threw Su Miaomiao to the ground.\nObviously he provoked Su Miaomiao first, but he blamed Su Miaomiao. Instead of apologizing, he even suppressed Su Miaomiao to hit her.\nHowever, before his fist fell, Xie Jingyuan grabbed his wrist and pulled him up from Su Miaomiao\u2019s body.\nChen Shuo was not reconciled, and even wanted to beat Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan pressed an acupuncture point on his wrist, and Chen Shuo immediately screamed.\n\u201cWill you still bully people in the future?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked expressionlessly.\nChen Shuo was dissatisfied in his heart, but he was in so much pain that tears were about to come out, so he shook his head repeatedly.\nOnly then did Xie Jingyuan let go.\nChen Shuo glared at him angrily, then ran away.\nXie Jingyuan picked up the strawberry hair rope on the ground, and went to support Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao was very upset, \u201cHe bullied me, why didn\u2019t you hit him?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan approached, and while patting the dirt off her body, he said in a low voice, \u201cHe\u2019s only five years old, I can\u2019t argue with a child.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI\u2019m a child too!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou have lived for a hundred years.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\nThe teacher from the second class rushed over to make sure that Su Miaomiao was not injured, tied the beautiful braid for Su Miaomiao again, and walked away.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to play anymore, so she sat in a corner and stared at the class with displeasure.\nXie Jingyuan sat beside her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "22": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-22/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe remembered the trick he used to subdue Chen Shuo, and wondered what happened. It seemed that Chen Shuo cried in pain after just pressing it lightly.\nXie Jingyuan briefly explained the acupoints of the human body.\nSu Miaomiao was a cat in her previous life, so naturally she had no way to understand those things, including the cultivation methods of Taoist priests.\n\u201cI want to learn too, would you teach me?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked very seriously.\nXie Jingyuan did not agree.\nHe was already worried that she would be unruly and would cause chaos everywhere, so how could he teach her more ways to hurt people?\nSu Miaomiao was unhappy again, as she didn\u2019t have nimble limbs, sharp claws or sharp cat teeth, so she could only fight with strength.\nSeeing her frustration, Xie Jingyuan comforted her, \u201cChildren in kindergarten are ignorant. When we go to primary school, this kind of thing won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nHe watched some TV series with Grandma Tao, and the students in the TV series were very obedient.\nSu Miaomiao curled her lips, \u201cIt will take another three years.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the children in the class, and said calmly, \u201cIt will be soon.\u201d\nTime did pass quickly.\nSu Miaomiao thought that kindergarten was fun, but she found life in it very boring. She was tired of playing with the facilities fixed in the yard, and she preferred to go to the large-scale amusement park in Anshi with her parents.\nHowever, when six-year-old Su Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan into the classroom of Class 3, Grade 1, and experienced the first elementary school class, Su Miaomiao suddenly discovered that kindergarten was better! At least in kindergarten, she just needed to have fun and play.\n\u201cMaster, I want to go home!\u201d After the first class, Su Miaomiao lay on the desk and whispered to Xie Jingyuan who was seated next door.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her, \u201cYou have lived for more than a hundred years, are you not as good as those ordinary children?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, \u201cI\u2019m not a real person.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cNow that you\u2019ve become a cat, I won\u2019t care about you anymore.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t change.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the watch on his wrist and said, \u201cYou can sleep for eight minutes, and I will wake you up when the teacher comes.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao immediately seized the time to sleep.\nBut how long was eight minutes? Just as Su Miaomiao fell into a light sleep, she was woken up by the harsh ringing of the class bell.\nClass monitor Cheng Yue, wearing a red scarf, bounced like a spring when the math teacher stepped into the classroom, \u201cStand up!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan stood up while grabbing Su Miaomiao\u2019s arm.\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\nShe didn\u2019t listen to the class on the first day at all, and the forty-five minutes of each class made her suffer.\nXie Jingyuan just watched silently.\nThe cat demon listened to the scriptures lying down in the Qingxu Temple, as if she had no bones in her body. It would take time for her to adapt to the way of teaching in elementary school.\nAfter school in the evening, Grandma Tao came to pick them up.\n\u201cGrandma, I don\u2019t like to listen to the lessons,\u201d Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help complaining.\nGrandma Tao: \u201cThat can\u2019t be done. After a while, you\u2019ll take an exam. If your score is low, the students will laugh at you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t mind that.\nUnexpectedly, when she returned to 302, Xie Jingyuan dragged her to do homework together.\nSu Miaomiao was lying on the desk that Grandma Tao bought specially for the two of them, feeling listless.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan took out a pack of dried fish, she immediately sat upright and reached out to grab it.\nXie Jingyuan pressed the plastic bag, looked at her homework and said, \u201cYou can only eat after doing homework.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was helpless, \u201cWhat is homework?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan repeated the words of the teachers of each subject.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI can\u2019t write.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019ll teach you. After finishing your homework, I will give you a test. You can only eat if you answer correctly.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao vaguely felt that something was wrong, but she had already been captured by the aroma of the dried fish, so she didn\u2019t even think about it.\nIf she could have freedom in the world, Su Miaomiao would definitely not be a studious student. But she was accompanied by a super-smart student who was so patient and insanely good\u2014\u2014Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan not only always maintained the impressive achievement of being the first in the class and even the first in the grade, he also required Su Miaomiao to achieve an excellent line of 85 points in every subject.\nIf Su Miaomiao hadn\u2019t been tempted by the dried fish at the beginning, maybe she would have allowed herself to be a poor student with the lowest grades in her class.\nBut those little dried fishes made her develop the terrible habit of obediently listening to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arrangement.\nUnder his supervision, she would sit upright and listen to the teachers\u2019 lessons, and only pay close attention to the time between classes to sleep.\nAfter school, she would obediently follow Xie Jingyuan to do her homework, and only after finishing her homework could she play, sleep, watch TV, and eat.\nSu Mingan and Tang Shiwei were very pleased with the way the two elementary school students got along with each other. Xie Jingyuan\u2019s tutoring for their daughter was simply better than a professional tutor.\nIn the final exam of the first grade of elementary school, Xie Jingyuan was the first in the grade, and Su Miaomiao was the second in the grade.\nSu Miaomiao was just lazy and lacked self-control in the first few years when she first became a human. Her soul was the soul of a century-old cat demon.\nThere were so many cats in the previous life, but only a handful of cats could become demons by themselves, which showed that Su Miaomiao still had roots of wisdom.\nTo use an analogy, Su Miaomiao was a genius among cats. She did need to learn new knowledge, but once she learned it, she could remember it forever.\nTheir daughter got good grades, so Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei called their relatives to tell them the good news.\nDuring the Chinese New Year reunion, Su Miaomiao received praise from her relatives, and at the same time received the envious eyes of the relatives\u2019 children.\nSu Miaomiao liked to see the proud smiling faces of her parents, and also enjoyed the envy, admiration and even jealousy from the children.\nThat reminded her of the eyes of the little priests looking at Xie Jingyuan in Qingxu Temple in her previous life.\nIt turned out that she could become as powerful as Xie Jingyuan.\nIn that state of mind, Su Miaomiao truly experienced the joy of learning, and gradually no longer needed the encouragement of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s dried fish.\nAfter the middle school entrance examination, Su Miaomiao was admitted to the best No. 1 Middle School in Anshi with Xie Jingyuan with excellent results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "23": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-23/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt seven o\u2019clock in the morning, Su Mingan made breakfast, went in front of his daughter\u2019s room and listened. It was quiet inside, so she must still be sleeping.\nTang Shiwei changed her clothes and came out of the master bedroom. Seeing him sticking to his daughter\u2019s door like a gecko, she said helplessly, \u201cShe won\u2019t wake up until nine o\u2019clock.\u201d\nSu Mingan also smiled wryly.\nSince the end of the high school entrance examination, his daughter resumed the routine of going to bed early and waking up late. Not to mention, sometimes seeing his daughter sleep so soundly, he would feel sleepy and rarely suffer from insomnia.\nHalf an hour later, the couple warmed up their daughter\u2019s meal, left a note, and went to work together.\nNo matter how bright and dazzling the summer sun was, it couldn\u2019t penetrate the light blue curtains in the bedroom.\nOn the two-meter big bed, Su Miaomiao slept soundly with a pillow on her head and a pillow in her arms.\nThe white phone on the bedside table suddenly rang.\nThat phone was the latest model that year, and it was also a gift from Su Mingan to his daughter for her graduation.\nSu Miaomiao was awakened by the ringtone, turned over twice, and waited until the phone returned to silence, just as she relaxed her brows, the ringtone came again.\nSu Miaomiao had no choice but to throw away the pillow and reached out to fumble for the phone. The bedroom was pitch black, and the light from the phone screen made Su Miaomiao close her eyes.\nThe phone was connected, and Cheng Yue\u2019s energetic voice came from inside, \u201cMiao Miao, have you woken up yet?\u201d\nMiaomiao hummed vaguely.\nCheng Yue: \u201cIt\u2019s already eight o\u2019clock, and you are still sleeping?! Did you forget that you have to come to my house to watch a movie later?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao rubbed her eyes, \u201cI remember, you said that auntie will make us fried fish balls.\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cYou just know how to eat, all right, get up quickly. We have to start watching the movie at nine o\u2019clock, so don\u2019t be late!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOkay.\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cBy the way, don\u2019t forget to call Xie Jingyuan! We are six good friends, and everyone needs to be here!\u201d\nThe call finally ended. Su Miaomiao\u2019s drowsiness was completely driven away by Cheng Yue. She yawned and sat up in a daze for a while, then she walked to the bed and opened the curtains.\nThe sun was shining brightly, and there were people walking up and down downstairs.\nSu Miaomiao stretched her waist and went for a stroll outside first.\nHer parents really left, and on her breakfast there was a note. She was asked to call her parents as soon as she woke up.\nSu Miaomiao called them and went to wash her face.\nBreakfast was seafood porridge and steamed buns. Su Miaomiao was full. She went back to her room and picked out a white dress from the closet. Her hair was tied in a bun, which was the simplest and what she was very good at.\nAfter everything was ready, Su Miaomiao set off with her phone, closed the door of her own room, and knocked on the door of 302 opposite.\nNot long after, familiar footsteps came from inside.\nXie Jingyuan opened the door, as if he knew it was her, he looked over indifferently, without any surprise.\nSu Miaomiao looked inside and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s grandma?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWent shopping.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOh, then did you tell her that we are going to watch a movie at Cheng Yue\u2019s house today?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI told her, are we going to leave now?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s cell phone was in his pocket. He had nothing else to take, so he came out after closing the door, and walked downstairs with Su Miaomiao.\nWhen going down the stairs, Su Miaomiao liked to walk up and down two steps at a time, bouncing up and down, revealing two fair and straight calves under her knee-length skirt.\nFifteen-year-old Su Miaomiao ate and slept well every day, and had grown to 1.6 meters.\nHer figure looked slender and petite, but she was not that morbidly thin. During jumping, her well-proportioned calves had a sense of strength, smooth and round.\nXie Jingyuan was two steps behind and followed her unhurriedly.\nAfter walking out of the corridor, the two came side by side again.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what\u2019s so good about that movie. It\u2019s better to watch cartoons,\u201d Su Miaomiao muttered softly.\nShe liked to bask in the sun in spring, autumn and winter.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her, \u201cYou still want to go even if you\u2019re not interested?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not going there to watch a movie, I\u2019m going there for the fried fish balls Cheng Yue\u2019s mother will make.\u201d\nHer eyes lit up at the mention of fried fish balls.\nXie Jingyuan thought of the few holidays in middle school. Cheng Yue\u2019s mother always liked to invite him and Su Miaomiao to accompany Cheng Yue to do holiday homework there.\nHe would refuse every time, but after Su Miaomiao tried Cheng Yue\u2019s mother\u2019s fried fish balls once, she insisted on dragging him and then he sat by the window alone, watching her eat fried fish balls with relish, while explaining some difficult problems to Cheng Yue.\nShe was a cat with poor patience, and she would only give lectures to her classmates when she was tempted by delicious food that suited her appetite. Otherwise, she would race against time and use her spare time to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "24": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-24/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they arrived at the gate of the community, the two stood on the side of the road, looking for a taxi.\n\u201cHey, are you two going on a date?\u201d An old lady came over with her newly bought vegetables. She smiled and joked when she saw those two well-known school geniuses in the community.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s expression was indifferent, while Su Miaomiao had heard such jokes a lot, and was used to it.\nWhat was a date? Some people said that she was Xie Jingyuan\u2019s little girlfriend.\nHow could those ordinary mortals know that Xie Jingyuan was actually a Taoist master? He would not be tempted by mortals at all, let alone break the precepts and be with a demon.\nAs for Su Miaomiao, being a demon or a human being, she didn\u2019t understand the meaning of love, and she didn\u2019t bother to understand it. She preferred to eat, drink, and have fun.\nIn addition, in Su Miaomiao\u2019s view, being emotional was a very terrible thing. Let alone demons, even the Gods in the sky who secretly married mortals in the lower world, would be punished. If a demon dared to seduce people, and was caught, they would either be killed, or they could only obediently serve as a mount for others, or be reduced to a house cat or a house dog.\nSu Miaomiao, who was arrested by Xie Jingyuan and taken to Qingxu Temple, was a very typical example.\nWhen the taxi came, Xie Jingyuan opened the door of the back seat. Su Miaomiao got in first, and then he came in.\n\u201cWhere are the handsome young man and beautiful young lady going?\u201d The uncle driver turned his body sideways and looked at the two with a smile.\nXie Jingyuan reported the address expressionlessly.\nHis facial features still had the childishness of a teenager, but his cold and introverted temperament and his height, which was not inferior to that of an adult man, made the uncle driver dare not strike up any more conversations and concentrate on driving.\nThere was an unpleasant smell in the taxi, so Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan opened the windows on both sides almost at the same time.\nThe wind blew in, and Su Miaomiao breathed comfortably. After a while, she fell asleep leaning against the seat.\nThe uncle driver felt that the two students were too quiet. When waiting for the red light, he glanced back through the rearview mirror and noticed that the handsome boy on the right was looking out the window indifferently, and the girl on the left was sleeping with her head tilted.\nHowever, that girl was really good-looking.\nThere were all kinds of beautiful stars on TV and billboards. That was the first time that the driver\u2019s uncle had seen such a beautiful real person. At most, she was a high school student. Her skin was fair and tender, and no amount of cosmetics could make it so natural. Her lips were red and moist, as if she had applied rose-colored lipstick, but it was lighter, which gave her a beauty that she didn\u2019t have at that age. She looked pure and moving.\n\u201cGreen light.\u201d\nThe uncle driver was fascinated, and suddenly heard a cold voice.\nThe uncle driver trembled in his heart, glanced at the high school boy who was looking at him coldly, calmed down and drove.\nThe taxi drove forward steadily. Xie Jingyuan looked to the side, and saw Su Miaomiao, who was in a light sleep, with slightly opened lips. A demon was a demon, unintentionally exuding an irresistible temptation for men.\nXie Jingyuan opened the shopping app and searched for \u201csummer wide-brimmed sun hat\u201d.\nShe always preferred white clothes and accessories, if Xie Jingyuan bought ugly ones, she would never wear them.\nXie Jingyuan picked out two white sun hats.\nAt 8:50, the taxi arrived at a villa complex.\nXie Jingyuan woke up Su Miaomiao, paid the money and got out of the car.\nSu Miaomiao fell asleep for almost twenty minutes. She was a little sleepy. When she walked to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, she wanted to hug his arm and walk by him. But Xie Jingyuan withdrew his arm mercilessly, and reminded Su Miaomiao under the strange eyes of the security guard, \u201cYou are no longer a child.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, and was just about to speak, when Feng Xiaoyu suddenly ran over from behind, hugged Su Miaomiao\u2019s arm and smiled wickedly, \u201cYou said you are not in love? I saw it just now!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026Then you didn\u2019t see him throwing my hand away?\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu looked toward Xie Jingyuan, winked at Su Miaomiao, and whispered, \u201cHe must be afraid of being bumped into us. If there was no one here, he would let you lean on him.\u201d\nThere were many such male protagonists in TV dramas and novels, commonly known as Mensao, with a serious face in front, but deep and passionate inside.\u00a0\nAlthough Xie Jingyuan was willing to help others, he always kept a cold face, so Feng Xiaoyu was a little afraid of him. She walked behind him holding Su Miaomiao\u2019s arm. She started to talk about other topics, and looked at the villa with envy, \u201cCheng Yue\u2019s family is really rich, I never dreamed of living in a villa.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nIn fact, Cheng Yue\u2019s family background was similar to that of the Su family. They were all ordinary rich. Xie Jingyuan\u2019s father, Xie Rong, was a super rich man. The technology company back then had developed into a well-known large company in China. It was said that they were actively expanding their international business in the past two years.\nXie Rong had already bought several villas, and wanted to take Grandma Tao and Xie Jingyuan to live with them, but Grandma Tao refused considering that Wenxin Community was close to elementary school and middle school.\nXie Rong liked Xie Jingyuan very much, the top student. After confirming that Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to study abroad, Xie Rong guessed that he would definitely be admitted to No. 1 High School. Three years ago, there was a new property for sale near No. 1 High School. Xie Rong bought a flat there in advance. He just waited for Xie Jingyuan\u2019s high school entrance examination to move there. Of course, he reminded Su Mingan at the opening, so Su Mingan bought a fat opposite of his again.\nAfter buying it, Su Mingan looked relieved, \u201cWith Jing Yuan here, Miao Miao will definitely be admitted to a prestigious university.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao really wanted to tell her father that she no longer needed Xie Jingyuan to help her make a study plan, she was a top student herself.\nHowever, she really wanted to continue living with Grandma Tao and Xie Jingyuan.\nWith the Taoist priest there, she didn\u2019t seem to need to worry about anything. He was the most powerful and would arrange everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Su Miaomiao looked the most lazy, but her grades were actually second only to Xie Jingyuan.\nLin Xi was firmly in third place, Zhou Yao and Feng Xiaoyu often competed for the fourth place, and her daughter Cheng Yue was the sixth which had not changed for many years.\nHer daughter was competitive. Mother Cheng also provided a lot of help, such as hiring a tutor for her daughter with a high salary, and using delicious food to lure Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan to come to their home to do homework.\nHard work could make up for one\u2019s weakness. Cheng Yue was also admitted to No. 1 High School.\nMother Cheng was very proud and hoped that the six children would continue to be good friends and encourage each other so that they could be admitted to a prestigious university together in the future.\n\u201cYou guys have fun, I\u2019m going out to do something,\u201d Mother Cheng said with a smile.\nShe was nearly forty years old, but she was maintained like a woman in her early thirties, like a lady in a wealthy TV series, no matter how warm her smile was, it also gave people a sense of distance.\nZhou Yao and Lin Xi stood up and watched her off at the same time, while Cheng Yue sat on the sofa and called Su Miaomiao.\nAfter Mother Cheng left, Lin Xi and Zhou Yao obviously relaxed a lot.\n\u201cOkay, see you later.\u201d\nAfter confirming that Su Miaomiao and the others had entered the community, Cheng Yue put down her phone in satisfaction, and seeing Zhou Yao and Lin Xi sitting motionless, she pushed the fruit plate over, \u201cEat, why are you being polite in my house?\u201d\nLin Xi was fair and handsome. He had been a quiet child since kindergarten. He was bullied by boys in the same class when he was in elementary school.\n\u201cI\u2019ve eaten at home, and I\u2019m not hungry at all,\u201d Lin Xi really couldn\u2019t eat anymore.\nZhou Yao\u2019s family was poor, and she didn\u2019t usually eat much fruit. The grapes, watermelon, and bananas in the fruit plate were all temptations to her, but she couldn\u2019t do that, so she shook her head with Lin Xi.\nCheng Yue understood her awkwardness very well, so she took a few fruits and put them on a separate tray, and enthusiastically stuffed them to Zhou Yao with a smile, \u201cEat quickly, you\u2019d better become as fat as me, or I will be the only fat one.\u201d\nZhou Yao looked at Cheng Yue\u2019s calf under the dress. It was obviously similar to hers.\nHowever, Cheng Yue\u2019s enthusiasm relieved her embarrassment. She took the tray and began to eat in small bites.\nOutside the villa, Mother Cheng\u2019s was driving a BMW along the main road. After seeing Xie Jingyuan and the others, she slowly stopped beside them and lowered the car window.\n\u201cAunt!\u201d Feng Xiaoyu shouted out in surprise, and Su Miaomiao, also called \u201cAuntie\u201d when she saw Mother Cheng looking at her.\nMother Cheng: \u201cHurry up, Yaoyao and the others are already here.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu and Su Miaomiao nodded.\nMother Cheng looked at Xie Jingyuan. Seeing that the child was still as indifferent as usual, she didn\u2019t talk about anything, and drove away.\nXie Jingyuan walked forward and heard Feng Xiaoyu whispering, \u201cCheng Yue\u2019s mother likes Xie Jingyuan first, and you second.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked puzzled, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\nShe thought that Mother Cheng liked her the most. She and Xie Jingyuan used to be guests there, and the fried fish balls Mother Cheng made were for her.\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cOf course I observed. Just like just now, after she stopped the car, the first person she looked at was Xie Jingyuan. Usually, whoever you look at first is the one you care about the most.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had either been engrossed in her homework or concentrated on eating, drinking and having fun all those years, she really didn\u2019t pay attention to those things.\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cLet\u2019s make a bet, let\u2019s bet on who Cheng Yue will look at first.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWho do you think she would look at?\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu raised her chin toward Xie Jingyuan who was in front.\nThen Su Miaomiao could only choose between herself and Feng Xiaoyu, she chose herself without hesitation. Cheng Yue must like her more.\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cWhat are you betting on? How about this, If I win, you will help me with ten questions after school starts. If you win, I will give you three packs of snacks, as long as they are available in our supermarket, you can choose whatever you want. \u201c\nSu Miaomiao agreed in one breath.\nThey arrived at the door, and in order not to let the location affect Cheng Yue\u2019s gaze, Su Miaomiao and Feng Xiaoyu stood beside Xie Jingyuan and formed a line.\nCheng Yue came to pick them up briskly, and looked at Xie Jingyuan first with smiling eyes.\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\nFeng Xiaoyu snickered, \u201cTen questions, don\u2019t cheat.\u201d\nCheng Yue looked over suspiciously, \u201cWhat ten questions?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWe\u2026\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu quickly covered her mouth with her hand, and said to Cheng Yue, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, this is a secret between me and Miao Miao, don\u2019t ask us about it.\u201d\nCheng Yue snorted, but she didn\u2019t care about that trivial matter, and greeted, \u201cCome in quickly, if it wasn\u2019t for waiting for you, I would have already started watching it.\u201d\nThat was a new movie that had just been released abroad for half a month. Unfortunately, they had no plans to release it in domestic theaters. Fortunately, Cheng Yue\u2019s mother had a way to let them watch it at home.\nThe movie was a series. They had watched the first two movies the previous year, and they were looking forward to the third movie that year.\nFeng Xiaoyu led Su Miaomiao inside.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her back and frowned.\nHe was worried that the cat demon would bully people, but her thoughts in some aspects were too simple. So if he didn\u2019t pay close attention, he was afraid that she would be bullied by someone with ulterior motives.\nHer academic performance could be improved by cultivating her self-control, but the world was too complicated, and people\u2019s hearts were too deep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "26": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-26/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe six good friends moved to the basement with fruit plate snacks.\n\u201cMy uncle is in New York. I asked him to help buy six movie tickets. Let\u2019s go to the cinema to watch it,\u201d Cheng Yue said, pushing the door of the screening room.\nThere were two rows of sofas in the projection room, with four seats in the first row and long sofas on both sides, so they could lie down and watch.\nSu Miaomiao happily occupied a couch.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at Lin Xi and walked to the second row.\nThere were four ordinary sofa seats in the second row, and Xie Jingyuan sat behind Su Miaomiao.\nLin Xi looked at him and took a seat across from him.\nAlthough the six of them were good friends in the eyes of outsiders, they were not. Xie Jingyuan just followed Su Miaomiao all the time, and treated the four of them very indifferently. He had no friendship beyond that of ordinary classmates.\nFeng Xiaoyu scrambled to sit next to Su Miaomiao. Neither of them was fat, so they could just make do and lie on the couch together.\nCheng Yue glared at Feng Xiaoyu, and after setting up the movie, she came over and sat down next to them, while Zhou Yao consciously sat on another ordinary sofa.\nThat movie series was about the love entanglement between an ordinary human girl, a vampire hero and a werewolf hero.\nBoth Cheng Yue and Zhou Yao liked vampires, but Feng Xiaoyu was a loyal fan of werewolves.\nWhen the werewolf boy showed his strong but not excessive muscles, Feng Xiaoyu excitedly shook Su Miaomiao\u2019s arm, \u201cSo handsome, so handsome, I really want to touch them!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked disgusted, \u201cWhy do you want to touch them? Wolves stink.\u201d\nIn her previous life, Su Miaomiao hid in the forest to practice since she was an ordinary wild cat, and only occasionally visited the human world. But she didn\u2019t dare to go deep into the forest, because it was the territory of all kinds of big and old demons.\nSu Miaomiao never dared to provoke a wolf demon, even an ordinary wolf could kill her, a cat who just learned to cultivate.\nFortunately, those demons were not as clean as cats, and even when they were far away, they gave off a smell, so Su Miaomiao could escape the danger in advance.\n\u201cHow come? He is a werewolf and takes baths often.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThe wolves themselves smell bad, just like a dog.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cHow come dogs smell bad? Su Miaomiao, your family have never raised a dog, let alone a wolf. Why do you sound like you know everything about animals?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026I read it in a book.\u201d\nCheng Yue interrupted suddenly, \u201cStop talking, just concentrate on watching the movie!\u201d\nAfter a period of silence, the villainous female vampire appeared, moving as fast as the wind.\nFeng Xiaoyu frowned, \u201cHey! Why is she so fast?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao held a small dried fish in her hand, and commented, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, she is not as fast as me.\u201d\nSuddenly someone kicked lightly under the back of the sofa.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s heart trembled as she didn\u2019t dare to say anything more.\nFeng Xiaoyu didn\u2019t take Su Miaomiao\u2019s words to heart at all, and only thought that she liked to brag.\nThe scene on the screen changed, and in the tent, the werewolf was able to hold the shivering female lead in his arms by virtue of his body temperature, while the vampire could only watch from the side.\nCheng Yue: \u201cThe female lead is going too far. Doesn\u2019t she feel sorry for the male lead? She obviously likes the male lead, but she still cuddles with another person with peace of mind.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cShe\u2019s cold, do you want her to freeze to death?\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cHmph, you are werewolves lover, of course you like this kind of plot.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cHow cool would it be, to be a female lead who is loved by two guys. What do you think, Miaomiao?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao finished chewing the small dried fish in her mouth, and looked at the two men on the screen with disgust, \u201cI think this female lead is too miserable. The two who like her are no good. A vampire is a kind of zombie. Wolves and dogs stink, not to mention there may be lice hidden in their fur\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSu Miaomiao!\u201d Feng Xiaoyu and Cheng Yue protested almost in unison. According to Su Miaomiao\u2019s analysis, the movie was unwatchable!\nNo one talked to her about it anymore, so Su Miaomiao concentrated on eating snacks.\nAfter the movie ended, everyone went to the living room, discussing the plot on the way.\nCheng Yue asked Xie Jingyuan and Lin Xi, \u201cYou boys, tell me, who is better, a vampire or a werewolf?\u201d\nLin Xi looked at Su Miaomiao, smiled and said, \u201cI think Miaomiao\u2019s words are very reasonable, they all have their own shortcomings.\u201d\nCheng Yue pouted, \u201cOf course you support Miao Miao. How about you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan, who was asked by her, didn\u2019t want to answer at first, but seeing Su Miaomiao and the others all looking over, he said calmly, \u201cIf they have strong self-control, these dangers can be avoided.\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cYou mean, they shouldn\u2019t be interested in her?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan agreed.\nFeng Xiaoyu stood next to Su Miaomiao, muttering in a low voice, \u201cWhy do you act like you don\u2019t want to fall in love, no wonder Miao Miao calls you the Taoist Master.\u201d\nEveryone had known each other for so long, and sometimes they overheard Su Miaomiao calling Xie Jingyuan \u201cTaoist\u201d.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her.\nFeng Xiaoyu immediately didn\u2019t dare to say more.\nSu Miaomiao fully supported Xie Jingyuan, \u201cHumans and demons have different paths. Humans and demons don\u2019t go the same way. Everyone has their own paths. Why do they have to mix together? There is no benefit in falling in love with the female lead. If the combination can increase strength\u2026\u201d\nHalfway through the speech, feeling Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cold gaze, Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help but think of the first time the two met in her previous life, and quickly shut her mouth.\nShe wanted to pull Feng Xiaoyu to change the subject, but Feng Xiaoyu exaggeratedly hid behind Cheng Yue, pointed at her and called, \u201cSu Miaomiao, so you are such a utilitarian person!\u201d\nCheng Yue snorted and said, \u201cDid you just find out? When did she give us a lecture for nothing?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "27": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-27/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was almost half past eleven after watching the movie.\nCheng Yue invited everyone to eat hot pot at a nearby restaurant, \u201cWe were admitted to No. 1 High School together. My mother was very happy that she gave me 1,000 yuan in the morning to let us celebrate.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cAuntie is so kind, then we will not be polite!\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome. Let\u2019s go, it will take about ten minutes to walk there.\u201d\nThe girls walked in front, Xie Jingyuan and Lin Xi walked behind them, one was cold and the other was quiet, there was nothing embarrassing about it.\nWhen they arrived at the hot pot restaurant, Cheng Yue asked for a box space.\nThe air conditioner was turned on and eating hot pot in the air-conditioned room was the best.\nThere were eight seats at the round table, but the waiter removed two of them.\nSu Miaomiao was the first to pick a chair, as she just sat down casually.\nXie Jingyuan sat second, on Su Miaomiao\u2019s left.\nFeng Xiaoyu still occupied the position on Su Miaomiao\u2019s right.\nCheng Yue sat on the other side of Xie Jingyuan as if nothing had happened.\nNeither Lin Xi nor Zhou Yao chose, and the remaining two seats were theirs.\nThe waiter brought three menus, Su Miaomiao and Feng Xiaoyu ordered together, Zhou Yao and Lin Xi shared one.\nCheng Yue put the menu on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, and was just about to ask Xie Jingyuan what he wanted to order, but he said indifferently, \u201cSu Miaomiao will order for me.\u201d\nHe understood what the little girl was thinking, but Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want her to go further down that fruitless wrong path.\nAt the age of fifteen or sixteen, she should focus on her studies and not be distracted by love, let alone fall in love with him.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t even look at Cheng Yue. His cold face turned slightly toward Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao, who was named, looked over and saw Cheng Yue\u2019s embarrassing appearance of a hot face pressing a cold butt. (showing warm feelings but meeting a cold rebuke)\nSu Miaomiao was too familiar with that embarrassment.\nThinking back to when she was just captured by Xie Jingyuan and taken to Qingxu Temple, in order to show her loyalty to him and prove that she was a reformed cat demon, she specially hand-copied the scriptures and dedicated it to Xie Jingyuan. In the end, Xie Jingyuan still had that cold look, he asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that you are not allowed to transform into a human form in the temple?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said aggrievedly, \u201cI did it to copy scriptures\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt is not acceptable even if you want to copy the scriptures either.\u201d\nSo, according to Su Miaomiao\u2019s experience, no one needed to think about flattering Xie Jingyuan, as he would not appreciate it at all. But there was no need to please him because Xie Jingyuan was a cold-faced and kind-hearted person. If one needed help, they just needed to ask him. That meant, as long as he could help, he would basically not refuse. Of course, outsiders couldn\u2019t ask too much. For example, if a poor man asked Xie Jingyuan for a meal, he would give it to him. If the poor person asked Xie Jingyuan to give him a hundred taels of silver, that was just a dream.\n\u201cHe is a vegetarian, just give him a few vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, basil, and potatoes, he is not picky.\u201d\nAfter Su Miaomiao finished speaking casually, she tilted her head and continued to choose meat dishes with Feng Xiaoyu.\nCheng Yue lowered her head. Her face was still a little pale. No matter how thin-skinned a\u00a0 person was, she would definitely cry a lot after being swept up in such a way.\nCheng Yue liked Xie Jingyuan, but he didn\u2019t like her at all.\nShe had always fantasized about being the female lead in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s love life, but she felt e that she was more like a poor and infatuated cannon fodder in an idol drama, who could only watch the indifferent male lead do various special deeds toward the female lead while treating her like air.\nShe would be unwilling to lose to someone else, but that person was Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao was prettier than her. She was better at studying than her, and was inseparable from Xie Jingyuan as childhood sweethearts. She had no hope at all.\nCheng Yue was a little sad, but fortunately, the feelings of a fifteen-year-old girl were not so deep-rooted, and she quickly turned her grief into appetite.\nThe waiter who came back said, \u201cWell, isn\u2019t it too much? You can order a few things and eat first, then add more dishes if it\u2019s not enough.\u201d\nIt was shameful to waste food, and the waiters in hot pot restaurants had also been trained to properly remind customers to reduce wastage.\nZhou Yao also persuaded Cheng Yue, \u201cLet\u2019s order a little less. Xie Jingyuan doesn\u2019t eat meat, so there is one less boy. How can the five of us eat so much?\u201d\nOnly then did Cheng Yue remove a few dishes.\nThe waiter walked away with the menu.\nFeng Xiaoyu looked around and sighed, \u201cAlthough all six of us were admitted to the No. 1 High School, I heard that last year\u2019s first grade was divided into 24 classes, and we probably will disperse.\u201d\nCheng Yue said, \u201cWe were not in the same class for three years in middle school.\u201d\nAfter saying so, everyone looked at Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao.\nFeng Xiaoyu was also very curious, \u201cWhy are you two always in the same class? From kindergarten to middle school, you still stayed at the same table!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao felt guilty.\nOf course, there was a reason for being together all the time, that was, her father thought that she would only study hard if she was in the same class as Xie Jingyuan, so he specially invited acquaintances from the school to help arrange it.\nHowever, her parents said that the approach was inappropriate. If every parent went to the teacher to ask for class placement, the teacher would have a headache, so she was not allowed to speak it out.\nHer dad could only interfere with the class division, and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s request was for the deskmate. That guy wanted to keep an eye on her and forbid her to sleep in class.\n\u201cProbably fate,\u201d Su Miaomiao said old-fashionedly.\nHer fate meant that the cat demon was captured by the Taoist master, and then had to be obedient for the rest of her life.\nCheng Yue and Lin Xi automatically understood it as \u201cfate\u201d.\nFeng Xiaoyu almost spat out a mouthful of the soda, and looked at Su Miaomiao in disbelief, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you are not in love, but now you are willing to admit it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "28": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-28/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, it has nothing to do with being in love.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cWhat does fate mean then?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, and explained as simply as possible, \u201cI offended him by doing something wrong in my previous life, so I will always be under his control in this life.\u201d\nIt was too profound and complicated, Feng Xiaoyu really didn\u2019t understand.\nCheng Yue observed Xie Jingyuan secretly, seeing his face cold as always, the little flame in her heart jumped a few times again.\nNeedless to say, Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t really seem to like Su Miaomiao. He was more like a serious elder brother who not only had to take care of Su Miaomiao, but also criticized and disciplined her in various ways.\nThen came the hot pot side dishes.\nFor fifteen or sixteen-year-old students, even if they had childish and superficial feelings in their hearts, they would not be entangled in them when eating.\nThe four-compartment hot pot was steaming, Cheng Yue was busy fighting with Su Miaomiao and Feng Xiaoyu while taking care of the introverted Zhou Yao.\nLin Xi ate his own food quietly, with a combination of meat and vegetables, and his movements were graceful.\nHe was elegant, and Xie Jingyuan was extraordinary and refined. He ate a clear soup pot and added a few slices of vegetables in it from time to time.\nCheng Yue couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou don\u2019t eat meat at home?\u201d\nHow could he grow so tall without eating meat?\nXie Jingyuan ate the dishes silently.\nSu Miaomiao answered for him, \u201cHe ate meat when he was a child. But his temper became more stubborn when he grew up, and grandma can\u2019t control him. Milk and eggs are the only things he is willing to eat.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cSo is this why you call him Taoist Master?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026Um.\u201d\nShe put a few slices in, and said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, keep an eye on them. Don\u2019t let them snatch it.\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cIt\u2019s too much, everyone is fighting for food according to their own ability, how can you invite foreign aid?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought to herself that since she was a cat of Qingxu Temple, Xie Jingyuan not only had the right to control her, but also had the obligation to take care of her.\nXie Jingyuan seemed to be immersed in his own world, as if he hadn\u2019t heard the girls\u2019 twittering. However, noticing that Cheng Yue and Feng Xiaoyu were about to pick up all the fat beef in the spicy pot, he still picked up the serving chopsticks and placed the remaining two slices into Su Miaomiao\u2019s bowl. At that moment, she was still eating the fish slices carefully.\nCheng Yue saw that scene, and the little flame in her heart dimmed a bit.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s indifference toward Su Miaomiao was real, but it was really natural for him to take care of her, as if the two of them were born together.\nAh, she also wanted such a bamboo horse! (childhood sweetheart)\nAfter eating the hot pot, the meal was over.\nCheng Yue could just go back to the villa. Lin Xi had moved from their place near the kindergarten and had to wait for the bus at another bus stop.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to ride the bus, so she told Xie Jingyuan, \u201cLet\u2019s take a taxi.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan stopped an empty taxi.\nThe taxi stopped by the side of the road, and he sat in the passenger seat.\nSu Miaomiao, Feng Xiaoyu, and Zhou Yao sat behind.\nThey all lived near the kindergarten, and when the driver asked for the destination, Xie Jingyuan reported the kindergarten\u2019s address.\nAs the car drove, Feng Xiaoyu said with emotion, \u201cI still remember the day when we first started kindergarten, and we are now going to high school in the blink of an eye. By the way, Miaomiao, when will you move to the new house? The new house should be renovated already, right? \u201c\n\u201cYes, it was renovated last year, and my mother said to take advantage of the hot weather to ventilate it for two months, and then move in before school starts.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cI really envy you. It will be so convenient for you to go to school in the future. My mother is going to arrange accommodation in a dorm for me, so I won\u2019t waste time traveling back and forth.\u201d\nZhou Yao: \u201cI will also stay there.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes lit up, and she took her hand and said, \u201cIt would be great if we could be assigned to the same dormitory.\u201d\nZhou Yao looked at her and smiled. She thought Feng Xiaoyu didn\u2019t like her, but she didn\u2019t think so anymore.\nSu Miaomiao had seen the dormitories in TV dramas. Those beds were too small, and there were several people living in each dormitory. If her parents wanted her to stay there, she would definitely be angry.\nFortunately, she was not a cat that liked to take the initiative to talk, and she always kept her thoughts in her heart, she woulotherwise d definitely be criticized by them.\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cDo you have any plans for such a long vacation? My father asked me to help in the supermarket. He will give me a salary of one thousand yuan a month. He is really stingy.\u201d\nZhou Yao smiled and said, \u201cAn aunt in our community knew that I was admitted to the No. 1 High School, and asked me to help her kid who is in the second year of middle school. She\u2019ll pay 20 yuan an hour. So two hours a day, and it comes to about more than a thousand a month.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cThat\u2019s actually good. I have to work eight hours a day. No, I have to ask for a raise from my dad.\u201d\nThe driver was amused by her, \u201cHow good life you guys are living now. When we were young, we could only pick up scrap iron and plastic to sell them for a few cents.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao listened and suddenly sighed.\nIn comparison, her previous life was really miserable.\nAs a wild cat, she had no way to earn money, so she could only go to people\u2019s houses to steal fish and meat, and she was often chased and beaten.\nAfter finally cultivating to adulthood, she could find a job in a brothel that included food and lodging, which could even speed up her cultivation, but Xie Jingyuan arrested her before she opened the business.\nInfected by Feng Xiaoyu and Zhou Yao\u2019s careerism, Su Miaomiao said to Xie Jingyuan after getting out of the taxi and walking side by side to the Wenxin Community, \u201d Taoist Master, I also want to make money.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cHow will you make money?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI don\u2019t know, tell me, should I help in my mother\u2019s hospital, or in my father\u2019s company?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou can\u2019t get a job in the hospital, and uncle\u2019s staff gets up at seven everyday and can\u2019t sleep during the day. Can you persevere?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said without thinking, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The only shortcoming was that she liked to sleep a lot. But in the elders\u2019 eyes, the child worked so hard at school, so summer vacation was for sleeping.\nWith the connivance of her grandparents, Su Miaomiao could sleep until she woke up naturally every day.\nSo every time Xie Jingyuan video chatted with her, he would see a girly face that was rosy and moist.\n\u201cWhat did you do today?\u201d He asked as usual. He contacted Su Miaomiao to ensure that she did not harm others outside.\nSu Miaomiao reported truthfully, \u201cI got up at nine o\u2019clock in the morning. My cousin took me to the playground for a day and we came back after dinner.\u201d\nAs she spoke, she yawned at the camera.\nShe had so much fun during the day, so at that moment she felt limp and just wanted to sleep.\nXie Jingyuan looked away, and when she closed her mouth, he looked over indifferently, \u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao rubbed her eyes and said, \u201cOn Saturday. My cousin is about to start university, so she will take me home first, and stay at our house for one night before going to Beijing.\u201d\nAnshi was located next to Jingshi, and it only took one and a half hours by train.\nThe day after was Saturday.\nXie Jingyuan confirmed her return date and was about to end the video call.\nSu Miaomiao suddenly remembered, leaned closer to the screen and said, \u201cTaoist Master, we arrive at the airport at 12 noon. Dad is still on a business trip and mom is busy with work. Why don\u2019t you come to the airport to pick us up? Grandpa and grandma bought me a lot of delicious food, but the suitcase is too heavy to drag around.\u201d\nThe cousin brought a suitcase by herself. Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to bother her cousin anymore, but it was no problem to bother Xie Jingyuan, as that was what he should do.\nXie Jingyuan was silent for a few seconds, nodded, and hung up the video call at the same time.\nSu Miaomiao also put her phone on the bedside table, pulled up the quilt and fell asleep after a second.\nAt 10:30 on Saturday morning, Xie Jingyuan came out of the study room and said to Grandma Tao who was watching TV in the living room, \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d\nGrandma Tao smiled and said, \u201cGo quickly. Miaomiao has been outside for most of the summer vacation, so bring her back soon.\u201d\nShe missed Su Miaomiao no less than Su Mingan and his wife.\nXie Jingyuan wore his sneakers and opened the door.\nAt that time, Su Miaomiao and her cousin Tang Yan were still on the plane.\nSu Miaomiao was sitting in the window seat, leaning against the back of the chair and sleeping comfortably, when suddenly the plane shook violently.\nTang Yan grabbed her cousin\u2019s hand nervously.\nShe woke up, and when her eyesight recovered, the plane had resumed a stable flight.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked, puzzled.\nTang Yan laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Even if the sky is falling, it won\u2019t affect your sleep.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at her watch. It was more than an hour before the plane landed.\nShe was bored and was about to go back to sleep when Tang Yan took out a book from her carry-on backpack. On the dark cover was printed the words \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d.\nSu Miaomiao wouldn\u2019t care about the title of the book, but the name \u201cSuppressing the Demon\u201d gave her a murderous vibe.\nAfter all, she was a demon.\n\u201cCousin, what book is this?\u201d Su Miaomiao approached curiously.\nSeeing that she was interested, Tang Yan introduced \u201cSuppressing the Demons is a novel that became popular among males last year, and it was published this year.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it about?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a Taoist master who just joined the Taoist temple. While learning art, he followed his master down the mountain to catch demons. If you like it, I will give it to you after reading it. Actually, this book has been popular for almost a year. I used to not like reading novels. I was really bored during the holidays, so my roommate recommended this book to me. It\u2019s so good!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t empathize with her cousin\u2019s obsession, she was just a little flustered, \u201cIs the story in it true? There really are demons and such powerful Taoist masters in this world?\u201d\nThe previous summer, Grandma Tao took her and Xie Jingyuan to travel, and once they passed a temple.\nThe Taoist masters inside were basically no different from ordinary people. They could only chant scriptures and do some superficial Kung Fu for physical fitness.\nSu Miaomiao also believed Xie Jingyuan\u2019s words, believing that there were no demons in that world, and there were no powerful Taoist masters.\nBut what if?\nSu Miaomiao was seriously confused which made Tang Yan laugh. She pinched Su Miaomiao\u2019s smooth apple-like face and said, \u201cYou are about to go to high school. Why are you so silly? There are no demons or ghosts in this world. They are all the author\u2019s imagination. Have you read \u2018Ghost Blowing the Lantern\u2019, you can\u2019t think that all the ghosts in it are real, right?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao knew \u201cGhost Blowing the Lantern\u201d, Cheng Yue bought a copy, and after reading it, she had nightmares.\nWhen the book was finally in Su Miaomiao\u2019s hands, she only turned a few pages in class, and Xie Jingyuan confiscated it\u2026\nSu Miaomiao looked at the cover of \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d. The author was a guy named \u201cXuanji\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The fields were getting closer and the airport was just ahead.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if your little boyfriend has arrived,\u201d Tang Yan joked with her.\n\u201cHe is not my boyfriend. Cousin, don\u2019t talk nonsense. He would be angry if he heard it.\u201d\n\u201cHe is coming to pick you up, and you still say that you are not in a relationship? Don\u2019t worry, I will not tell others.\u201d\nPeople around her always misunderstood her relationship with Xie Jingyuan, Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t explain it clearly, so she simply shut up.\nAfter getting off the plane, Su Miaomiao turned on her phone, and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s text message popped up first, saying that he had arrived and was in the pick-up hall.\nSu Miaomiao replied to the text message and went with her cousin to get the suitcase first.\nShe was not exaggerating at all. Her grandparents stuffed her suitcase so that there was no gap. It was very laborious to lift it off the turntable, and it was not easy to drag it.\nTang Yan took care of her cousin.\nComing to the exit, Su Miaomiao looked around and found Xie Jingyuan. He was wearing a black short sleeve, tall and thin.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Xie Jingyuan? No way, you didn\u2019t even think about taking a few pictures of him and putting them in your phone?\u201d\nTang Yan was deeply shocked by the appearance of her cousin\u2019s legendary boyfriend.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, then waved to Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan walked toward the end of the exit passage, the distance was close enough, Su Miaomiao took back her heavy suitcase from her cousin, and handed it to Xie Jingyuan naturally.\nXie Jingyuan took it silently.\n\u201cThis is my cousin.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Tang Yan.\nAlthough Tang Yan was a sophomore, she was about the same height as Su Miaomiao, and she couldn\u2019t picture her being a big sister in front of Xie Jingyuan who was at least 175 years old.\nThe main reason was with Xie Jingyuan\u2019s otherworldly appearance and his aloof temperament, it was really difficult for ordinary people to be casual in front of him.\n\u201cHave you eaten yet?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao again.\n\u201cNo, the food on the plane was not delicious. Grandma called me in advance and asked us to go to your house for lunch.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan hummed, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nHe dragged Su Miaomiao\u2019s suitcase and strode outside.\nTang Yan quietly asked her cousin, \u201cWhen you two are alone together, is he so cold?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYes, he is more rude to me than to you.\u201d\nTang Yan looked at her cousin who had a sweet appearance and a soft personality, and secretly made up a pair of classic love cp of \u201cThe Domineering School Girl Fell in Love with Me\u201d.\nIt took an hour by taxi from the airport to the community.\nDuring that hour, Su Miaomiao continued to sleep leaning against her cousin, while Xie Jingyuan sat in the passenger seat, without any intention of chatting.\nThe most enthusiastic one turned out to be the driver.\nWhen they finally arrived at Wenxin Community, Xie Jingyuan dragged the suitcase downstairs, and showed Tang Yan his way of hospitality for the first time \u2013 he took her suitcase there, and then carried a suitcase in each hand, to climb up to the third floor.\nTang Yan began to envy her cousin, not to mention high school students, even male college students may not have Xie Jingyuan\u2019s qualities.\nGrandma Tao enthusiastically invited the two to 302.\nLunch was ready, so Su Miaomiao took her cousin to the bathroom to wash her hands, and Grandma Tao brought the last dish to the table.\nTang Yan was still a little restrained at the Xie House. When she returned to 301, Tang Yan immediately asked, \u201cMiao Miao, is Xie Jingyuan a vegetarian?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\n\u201cI admire him. I want to lose weight, but I can\u2019t bear to only eat vegetables.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you want to lose weight? Meat is delicious. There are also nutrients in meat that vegetables cannot provide to humans.\u201d\nAlthough Xie Jingyuan was only a vegetarian, he knew how to cultivate, and the aura he absorbed was more nourishing than any other nutrition. That was why he grew so tall without affecting his normal growth.\nTang Yan sighed, \u201cYou are still young, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought of her grandma, and threatened her cousin, \u201cYou are not allowed to lose weight anyway, or I will tell grandma.\u201d\nIn Su Miaomiao\u2019s view, eating only vegetables was a form of torture, and she couldn\u2019t watch her relatives suffer in vain.\nFortunately, Tang Yan was just talking casually. Tang Shiwei took them out for a meal at night, and Tang Yan ate better than Su Miaomiao.\nThe next morning, Tang Yan got on the bullet train to Beijing. She also left \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d to Su Miaomiao as promised.\nHer parents were not at home, Su Miaomiao had nothing to do after taking a nap, and opened the novel.\nThe young Taoist master in the book worshiped the Zixia Temple, which was completely different from the Qingxu Temple that Su Miaomiao had been to.\nHowever, the scriptures chanted by the Taoist masters at Zixia Temple, the teachings given by the old Taoist masters to the young Taoist masters, and even the mantras that the old Taoist masters recited when they were catching demons, were all similar to what she heard from Xie Jingyuan.\nSu Miaomiao was so shocked, she didn\u2019t even change her pajamas, she put on her slippers and grabbed a book and went to 302.\nGrandma Tao came to open the door.\nSu Miaomiao drilled in, \u201cGrandma, where\u2019s brother?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the study, you\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had already run to the study.\nUsually there were only Xie Jingyuan and Grandma Tao in the house, so Xie Jingyuan had not developed the habit of locking the door.\nThe door of the study was suddenly pushed open, Xie Jingyuan turned his head, saw Su Miaomiao, and silently closed the laptop screen with his slender hands.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He asked indifferently.\nSu Miaomiao held up the novel in her hand in front of him, \u201cMaster, take a look, the scriptures here\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at Grandma Tao behind her, with the usual expression, \u201cIs it difficult to understand?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, these scriptures are exactly the same as what you said!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cOf course, I wrote the book.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\nGrandma Tao saw that her grandson was finally willing to tell his good friend the secret of his novel writing, and left with a smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "31": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-31/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Grandma Tao left, Xie Jingyuan signaled Su Miaomiao to close the door with his eyes.\nSu Miaomiao closed the door blankly, then sat down on the bay window by the window, looked at the book in her hand, and then looked at Xie Jingyuan in front of her.\nXie Jingyuan first asked her, \u201cWhere did you get the book?\u201d\n\u201cCousin finished reading it, and gave it to me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan basically guessed that she was usually not interested in reading novels.\n\u201cTaoist Master, why did you write a novel?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan put on an immortal-like face, and uttered a common explanation, \u201cMake money.\u201d\nIf he was alone and didn\u2019t have much demand for material life, he could just go to a temple directly.\nBut he had to take care of Grandma Tao and take care of the greedy, coquettish, lazy cat who didn\u2019t know what thrift was.\nIncluding his tuition fees and living expenses, he needed money.\nXie Rong was rich, so he was not stingy with him, but Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to rely on a father who he had little relationship with to live.\nAfter hearing his reason, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t think it was strange. People like Zhou Yao and Feng Xiaoyu were also using their own methods to earn pocket money by doing summer jobs.\nShe was even more curious about how much Xie Jingyuan could earn.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her coldly, \u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell others about this, including uncle and aunt.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cYou can go, don\u2019t go out in pajamas in the future.\u201d\nIt was only then that Su Miaomiao realized that she was wearing pajamas, and her hair was messed up from leaning on the bedside to read the book.\nExcitedly running over, Su Miaomiao was taunted for nothing. Xie Jingyuan stared at Su Miaomiao, who walked out, pouted, and closed the door for him.\n\u201cDoes Miaomiao like this book too?\u201d On the sofa, Grandma Tao asked with a smile.\nThe grandson was still underage, and he needed her assistance in signing the contract and handling things.\nSu Miaomiao changed her mind, sat down beside Grandma Tao with \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d, and asked in a low voice, \u201cBrother is so amazing, do you know how much he earns?\u201d\nSpeaking of that, Grandma Tao was proud, and was about to reveal it to Su Miaomiao quietly, when there was a sound of opening the door from the study.\nGrandma Tao\u2019s gaze changed slightly, and she said regretfully to Su Miaomiao, \u201cHe won\u2019t let me tell you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was disappointed again.\nGrandma Tao couldn\u2019t resist her pitiful appearance, and quickly added, \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a lot, you can ask him for whatever you want.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up.\nXie Jingyuan had already walked over, holding a cup in one hand, went to get water from the water dispenser, and casually glanced at Su Miaomiao who was on the sofa.\nThose eyes were cold enough for Su Miaomiao to understand his hint.\n\u201cGrandma, I\u2019ll go now,\u201d Su Miaomiao stood up holding the book.\n\u201cGo, come to play when you\u2019re bored.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao left quickly.\nXie Jingyuan watched the door close again, and asked Grandma Tao, \u201cDid you tell her?\u201d\nGrandma Tao coughed, \u201cI only said that you earn a lot, but didn\u2019t say the specific amount. Hey, what is your relationship with Miaomiao? What\u2019s wrong if you tell her?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan frowned slightly, and asked, \u201cWhat do you think is my relationship with her?\u201d\nGrandma Tao showed a mysterious and ambiguous smile to her grandson.\nHer grandson treated Su Miaomiao like his little girlfriend, and Grandma Tao had long regarded Su Miaomiao as her granddaughter-in-law.\nXie Jingyuan wanted to explain, but seeing Grandma Tao smiling so happily, he paused, and went back to the study with water.\nProbably, he couldn\u2019t explain it.\nExcept for Su Miaomiao, who would believe that he just treated her like a cat demon with a pure view?\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0In her room, Su Miaomiao leaned back to the head of the bed, carefully flipping through \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d.\nAccording to the introduction on the page, the book had 350,000 words and was priced at 40 yuan.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t understand the algorithm very well, so she sent a text message to Tang Yan, \u201cCousin, how many copies of Suppressing the Demons have been sold?\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know? Only the author and the publisher know about this, why are you asking this?\u201d\n\u201cI want to know how much money the author makes.\u201d\nHow much the Taoist master earned really had nothing to do with her, but Su Miaomiao was just curious about how powerful he could be.\n\u201cIt must be a lot. It was said that there are local rich readers who gave him ten thousands in rewards. Almost all the male lead novels with high sales were long novels with several million words, but his short book rushed forward. You can imagine how high his subscription is, and it will cost hundreds of thousands, not counting the publishing fee.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\nHundreds of thousands!\nZhou Yao and Feng Xiaoyu only earned 1,000 a month working part-time, but he quietly earned hundreds of thousands.\nAs expected of the master of the Qingxu Temple, Xie Jingyuan was a powerful Taoist master, and he was also proficient in everything even when he became a human being.\nAfter the admiration, Su Miaomiao was also a little bit shocked.\nMore or less, all her friends made money, only she didn\u2019t make a penny that summer vacation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "32": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-32/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao looked at the cover of \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d, and suddenly came up with an idea. The Taoist master could write about the demons\u2019 catcher, so she could also write a story about a cat demon.\nOn impulse, Su Miaomiao turned on the computer and created a file.\nTen minutes passed and the document was blank.\nHalf an hour passed and the document was blank.\nAfter another half hour, Su Miaomiao gave up completely.\nWriting a story was more difficult than doing the questions. She didn\u2019t like it, and she didn\u2019t know what a cat demon could do.\nForget it, she was just a cat, why did she have to compete with the dignified Taoist Master?\nAfter turning off the computer, Su Miaomiao continued to read \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d.\nAfter reading it, she felt cold all over.\nThe few demons that appeared in the book were too miserable. The little ones had not cultivated well, so it was expected that they would be beaten to death by the Taoist master. The most powerful thousand-year-old python demon was also beaten to death.\nSuch a cruel plot was the one the readers in that world actually liked so much. Which point did they like?\nHowever, the python demon\u2019s crime of killing people was as serious as hemp, and the Taoist master was obliged to do justice for the heavens.\nBut there was obviously a kind-hearted rabbit demon in it, and it had helped the Taoist master. Why didn\u2019t it get a good ending, but was swallowed by the python demon?\nWhen the rabbit demon was suddenly swallowed, Su Miaomiao got scared and uncomfortable.\nShe turned to the page where the rabbit demon died, took a picture, and then sent it to Xie Jingyuan: Taoist Master, why did you kill the rabbit demon in the book? Isn\u2019t it said that good things are rewarded with good things?\nTwo minutes later, Xie Jingyuan replied to her: To be a demon in this life, and to be a human in the next life is a good reward.\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\nSeemed to make sense.\nIt was time to move on August 19th. The Xie and Su families called the moving company, and together they moved from Wenxin Community to Pearl (Mingzhu) Garden near No. 1 High School.\nPearl Garden was full of elevator rooms, and the buildings they live in were all one-elevator, two-family units. The Su family lived in 1001, and the Xie family lived in 1002.\nTang Shiwei was in the hospital, so Su Mingan and his daughter were responsible for cleaning up the new home.\nAfter a busy day, Su Miaomiao\u2019s arms were sore, so she went back to her room to take a shower, and then came to the Xie House for dinner with her father.\nGrandma Tao and Xie Jingyuan had much less things. They packed them up earlier. While Grandma Tao was preparing dinner, Xie Jingyuan took the elevator up and down, and transported the discarded cardboard boxes from the two houses.\nWhen the father and daughter came over, he had just finished taking a shower and was wearing a set of black casual clothes. His short hair was half-brushed, jet-black, showing a fair and handsome face.\n\u201cJing Yuan helped a lot today,\u201d Su Mingan patted Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder, and squeezed it. Good guy, he had muscles!\nExcept for Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cold personality, no one could find any shortcomings.\nSu Mingan looked at his daughter.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t notice Xie Jingyuan\u2019s handsomeness as he just got out of the bath, but ran to the kitchen to find Grandma Tao.\nSu Mingan couldn\u2019t help but think of the conversation between him and his wife.\nHis daughter and Xie Jingyuan were inseparable, and they were at an age prone to puppy love. As parents, it was hard for them not to think too much.\nThe result of the discussion was that Xie Jingyuan had a heart for his daughter, but their daughter still had a child temper and was not enlightened.\nTang Shiwei was very satisfied with Xie Jingyuan. He was not the kind of impulsive boy whose hands and feet were completely dominated by hormones. He single-mindedly pulled her daughter to make progress together. Tang Shiwei asked Su Mingan not to interfere. Even if he wanted to talk, he had to wait for the children to be admitted to college. Su Mingan listened to his wife.\nBut he would occasionally test his daughter. If Xie Jingyuan behaved excessively toward his daughter that was not suitable for their age, then he wouldn\u2019t be polite.\nHowever, looking at the muscular lines looming under Xie Jingyuan\u2019s trousers, Su Mingan was a little sceptical. In a few years, would he still be able to beat this kid?\n\u201cSit down, the dishes will be ready soon,\u201d Grandma Tao poked her head out of the kitchen, saw Su Mingan standing there in a daze, and said with a smile.\nSu Mingan responded and sat down at the dining table.\nSu Miaomiao and Grandma Tao brought out the dishes together, and she asked him, \u201cThere is beer in the refrigerator, how about a bottle?\u201d\nSu Mingan glanced at Xie Jingyuan, and asked casually, \u201cHave you and Jing Yuan had beer yet?\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cWe don\u2019t drink, Jing Yuan\u2019s father said that he would come and stay here often in the future, so I bought a few bottles.\u201d\nSu Mingan understood.\nFrom Grandma Tao\u2019s occasional words, he also learned intermittently about Xie Rong\u2019s second marriage.\nOver the years, Xie Rong had become richer. Whether it was true or the media was catching rumors, there would always be some women around Xie Rong. Qiao Lili was not feeling well, and had a few fights with him.\nAs for Xie Rong, on the one hand his wife who was becoming more irritable, and his twins, dragon and phoenix (boy and girl) had mediocre grades. So he was leaning more toward his mother and the eldest son.\nGrandma Tao brought a bottle of beer.\nSu Mingan opened the lid, and raised it toward Xie Jingyuan jokingly, \u201cWant to take a sip?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan shook his head.\nHe didn\u2019t eat meat, let alone drink alcohol.\nIf Tang Shiwei were there, she would definitely scold Su Mingan. What if he really led the high school student into drinking?\n\u201cShiwei has a night shift again tonight. Is it convenient for her to go to work when she moves here?\u201d\nSu Mingming and Xie Jingyuan ate quietly, while Grandma Tao started the chat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, she can drive by herself, and she will reach the hospital in half an hour.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s convenient to be able to drive. When Miao Miao and Jingyuan graduate from high school, they should also take the driver\u2019s license test during the summer vacation.\nSu Mingan looked at his daughter, and said helplessly, \u201cMiaomiao didn\u2019t even want to learn how to ride a bicycle. Do you dare to take the driver\u2019s license test?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao really got used to it and said, \u201cIt\u2019s enough if my brother learns driving.\u201d\nGrandma Tao smiled.\nThe corners of Su Mingan\u2019s mouth twitched.\nXie Jingyuan, that brat, was cold and crude. What method did he use to make his good daughter dependent on him like that?\nWhen a man and a woman were in love, if a girl was too obedient, it was easy for her to suffer. Miao Miao should learn more from her mother. Occasionally, a tigress could calm down a man!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When he arrived at the airport in the afternoon, he asked the driver to take him directly to Pearl Garden.\nXie Rong, forty two years old, had a slender figure and a gentle and refined temperament. Compared with the boss of a listed company, he looked more like a university professor.\nHe had the key to the house there, but Xie Rong still rang the doorbell when he got to the door.\nSu Miaomiao was sitting on the sofa watching TV with Grandma Tao. When the doorbell rang, Grandma Tao said, \u201cIt must be your Uncle.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao ran to open the door.\nShe was Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei\u2019s daughter, but in the previous ten years, the elder who had taken care of her the longest was actually Grandma Tao.\nMost of the time, Su Miaomiao was a lazy cat, but she knew how to be filial to the elderly. Grandma Tao was sixty-five years old, so there was no reason for her to continue to lie on the sofa and let her run errands.\n\u201cUncle!\u201d\n\u201cMiaomiao, how is the new community, do you like it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded, and when Xie Rong came in with the suitcase, she closed the door again.\n\u201cMom!\u201d Xie Rong looked around and said to his own mother who was still sitting on the sofa.\n\u201cAre you tired? If you are tired, go back to your room and sleep for a while.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I slept on the plane. I\u2019ll go and change first.\u201d\nThen Grandma Tao stood up, took her son to the smallest bedroom in the house, opened the door and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t stay here often, so you can sleep here.\u201d\nXie Rong smiled helplessly.\nSince his second marriage, his status in his mother\u2019s heart had become lower, far inferior to that of his eldest son.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Jing Yuan?\u201d\n\u201cHe went to buy ice cream.\u201d\nIn the TV drama they were watching, there were children eating ice cream. Su Miaomiao wanted to eat it too, so Grandma Tao asked her grandson to go to the supermarket outside the community to buy it.\nXie Rong could guess that his son went to buy ice cream for Su Miaomiao.\nAfter Grandma Tao took him to his room, she also went to watch TV.\nXie Rong closed the door, opened the suitcase, took out the gifts he had prepared, then took out a change of clothes, and went to his son\u2019s room in the master bedroom to take a shower.\nAfter washing and getting dressed, Xie Rong walked around his son\u2019s bedroom slowly while wiping his head with a towel.\nThe master bedroom was very spacious, had a separate cloakroom, and a row of bookcases with densely packed books.\nThe desk and desktop were clean and tidy, and an old laptop was closed.\nXie Rong didn\u2019t touch the notebook, nor rummaged through his son\u2019s drawer, he turned and walked back. At that moment, Xie Jingyuan pushed the door open from the outside.\nWhen the father and son faced each other, Xie Rong showed a fatherly smile.\nXie Jingyuan still had that indifferent face, glanced at the open door of the bathroom, and asked him, \u201cDid you finish bathing?\u201d\n\u201cI still have to blow dry my hair. You go to my room. There is a gift for Miaomiao on the table, you take it to her first.\u201d\nWith that said, he went into the bathroom again and closed the door.\nXie Jingyuan went to the second bedroom and saw three gifts on Xie Rong\u2019s desk, a luxury brand jewelry gift box, a latest notebook, and a perfume gift box.\nThe notebook must be for him, the perfume was what Grandma Tao liked, the jewelry\u2026\nXie Jingyuan picked up the jewelry gift box and went to the living room.\nSu Miaomiao was eating strawberry ice cream, staring at the TV screen.\n\u201cYour gift,\u201d Xie Jingyuan directly placed the gift box on the empty sofa next to her.\nAs Su Miaomiao looked down, her eyes lit up.\nSince Uncle Xie became richer, the gift he gave her every year had become shiny jewelry.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t really care about the brand, as she liked shiny things.\nAfter asking Grandma Tao to help hold the ice cream, Su Miaomiao opened the gift box in twos, and inside was a pair of hairpins with simple shapes but studded with diamonds.\nDiamonds were brighter than gold!\nSu Miaomiao immediately ran to the mirror on the other side of the entrance cabinet, and happily put the hairpin on her head.\nXie Jingyuan sat on the single sofa, looking at her expressionlessly.\nShe was still a student, and her hobbies were already so extravagant. After going to university and seeing the colorful world outside, he had no idea what expensive things she would ask him for.\nXie Jingyuan was afraid that she would have evil thoughts because of greed.\nInstead of letting her escape to other places to do evil, Xie Jingyuan would rather be with her, saving his time and worry.\nWhen Xie Rong dried his hair and came out, Su Miaomiao smiled brightly, \u201cThank you uncle.\u201d\nA fifteen-year-old girl, fresh and bright, full of vigor, like a flower, was pleasing to the eye.\nXie Rong smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you like it. I saw this couple picking hairpins and I immediately thought of you and Lanlan.\u201d\nLan Lan was Xie Wenlan, the younger sister of the twins. She was thirteen years old that year, that was already at the age where she knew how to dress herself up.\nOf course, the hairpins that Xie Rong gave to the two girls looked similar, but they were still different in design.\n\u201cCome and eat ice cream, or it will melt,\u201d Grandma Tao shouted while holding up the ice cream.\nSu Miaomiao hurried back to eat.\nXie Rong sat on the other side of Grandma Tao, chatting with Xie Jingyuan, asking what his son did that summer vacation.\nXie Jingyuan used that summer vacation time to write the second part of the \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "34": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-34/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taoist masters he portrayed in the book were all fake, but the story of catching demons in it was something that his ancestors, masters, martial uncle, and even himself had personally experienced.\nXie Jingyuan had no intention of being a real writer, and he didn\u2019t want writing novels to take up too much of his time. He wrote a book during the summer vacation every year, and the manuscript fee was enough. At present, Su Miaomiao\u2019s desire for material things was not that strong.\nBut Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t intend to tell Xie Rong.\nHe said lightly, \u201cRead books.\u201d\nXie Rong thought for a while, then nodded, \u201cIf you want to go to high school, you should study more.\u201d\nOnce his son graduated from high school, he would arrange for his son to go to the company to familiarize himself with the business during the winter and summer vacations of the university.\nThinking of the company, Xie Rong was very proud.\nHe was an excellent father who built a listed company with his own hands. Fortunately, that company would have a better successor than him.\nTang Shiwei came home from work, and soon found that her daughter had a pair of diamond hairpins on her head.\nShe looked at her husband in surprise.\nSu Mingan smiled, \u201cXie Rong is back.\u201d\nTang Shiwei was no longer surprised. Xie Rong treated Miaomiao as another daughter, and gave her gold, silver and jade. Fortunately, Xie Rong did not send gifts that were too exaggerated.\nSu Mingan: \u201cXie Rong also said that we would have a barbecue at his villa on weekends, so let\u2019s take Miaomiao there to celebrate the fact that the two children are about to start school.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cHey, I happen to have a holiday this weekend.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cHe asked me which day would be convenient for me, so of course I picked your day off.\u201d\nTang Shiwei looked at her daughter and reminded her, \u201cMiaomiao, let\u2019s go to Uncle Xie\u2019s villa for barbecue, but don\u2019t quarrel with Lanlan.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cDon\u2019t bother me with her, I will ignore her.\u201d\nTang Shiwei sighed, \u201cYou always have to learn to give way to others, especially when you are a guest at someone\u2019s home.\u201d\nHer daughter was a top student, but in terms of human relationships, her daughter was the same as in kindergarten. She never took the initiative to share any delicious and fun things. Tang Shiwei was often worried that her daughter would not be able to make other new friends. As for Xie Jingyuan, Zhou Yao, Cheng Yue, Feng Xiaoyu, and Lin Xi, they had accepted their daughter\u2019s temper since kindergarten, but the older the child was, the more sensible she should be. In high school and university, if her daughter continued to be selfish, how could other students bear it?\u00a0\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t quite understand what her mother meant, and she didn\u2019t want to.\nShe didn\u2019t bully anyone, and others shouldn\u2019t even try to bully her.\nUnless she couldn\u2019t beat the opponent, she would never let herself be angry.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s eat first,\u201d Su Mingan quickly eased the atmosphere.\nAlthough Tang Shiwei thought so, she couldn\u2019t bear to force her daughter to change.\nShe still remembered that when her daughter was in the first grade, in order to protect Lin Xi, she fought with a boy in the class, pushing and shoving him. The boy hit his head on the desk and bled.\nThe class teacher called the parents of both parties to the classroom, hoping to reconcile.\nThe other parent asked her to bear the medical expenses and asked her daughter to apologize.\nTang Shiwei was willing to pay, but her daughter refused to apologize. Tang Shiwei tried to order her daughter as a mother, but the daughter just raised her head and looked at her quietly, with tears floating in her big eyes little by little.\u00a0\nTang Shiwei would never forget her daughter\u2019s appearance at that time.\nAfter falling asleep, she confided her troubles to her husband, \u201cMiaomiao has such a temper, what will she do in the future?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you worried about, Miaomiao is able to distinguish right from wrong, and she refuses to wrong herself, which is very good.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter how good friends are, they would quarrel. Learn to accommodate each other and tolerate some small shortcomings in conflicts. Have you seen Miao Miao? She would not take the initiative to talk to other students. It was Cheng Yue and the others who took the initiative to talk to her. If one day others don\u2019t want to play with her anymore, Miaomiao will just play alone.\u201d\n\u201cShe can play with Jing Yuan.\u201d\nTang Shiwei pushed him, \u201cJing Yuan is a boy, how can he still be with her all the time? I\u2019m afraid Miaomiao doesn\u2019t even have a female classmate to go to the bathroom with.\u201d\nSu Mingan was speechless, after a while, his eyes turned red.\nWould his silly daughter really become a poor little isolated one?\nWhen having breakfast the next day, Su Miaomiao felt that there was something wrong with her parents.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cMiao Miao, you have been playing outside this summer vacation, do you want to go see Cheng Yue and the others before school starts?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to go out, she preferred to watch TV with Grandma Tao.\nTang Shiwei continued to work hard, \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be time to buy new stationery? I will give you money, so ask Xiao Yu and the others to go with you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI went to the supermarket with grandma before, and I already bought everything.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cI heard that there is a new grilled fish restaurant in the Skyline Building. It\u2019s very delicious. Would you like to invite your classmates to eat at noon?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao finally became interested.\nSu Mingan immediately counted out 1,000 yuan and stuffed it into her daughter\u2019s favorite small satchel with strings of pearls.\nIn order to ensure that their daughter would not forget, the couple asked their daughter to call a few good friends in front of them.\nSu Miaomiao had no choice but to take out her phone, open the address book, and dial a number.\nAfter two beeps, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cold voice came from the phone, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cDad said there is a grilled fish restaurant in the Skyline Building that is delicious. We\u2019ll go there at noon.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\u201cCall Feng Xiaoyu and the others to go together.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nAfter that, Su Miaomiao hung up the phone.\nWhy was it so reasonable for their daughter to order Xie Jingyuan?\nWhy did Xie Jingyuan agree to their daughter so easily and didn\u2019t even resist?\nCould it be that it was the way of puppy love for children in the new era?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "35": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-35/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt noon, Su Miaomiao really took a taxi with Xie Jingyuan to the Skyline Building, and had a very delicious meal with her friends at the grilled fish shop.\nSu Miaomiao brought a satchel, and when she was full and remembered to pay, Xie Jingyuan had already paid the bill in advance.\nIf the two of them were together, no matter what they did, Xie Jingyuan would pay for it. Su Miaomiao was used to it and didn\u2019t care too much.\nWhen Su Mingan came back in the evening, Su Miaomiao took out the one thousand yuan from her wallet and returned it to her father.\nThe Taoist master had already earned hundreds of thousands of yuan, but Su Miaomiao was still a high school student who thought that a thousand yuan was too big an amount to handle. Such a sum of money should be handed over to her parents for safekeeping.\nSu Mingan looked at the banknotes in his daughter\u2019s hand, and asked speculatively, \u201cDid Jingyuan pay for lunch?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nSu Mingan took a deep breath, went to the kitchen for a while, sorted out the ingredients for dinner first, while sorting out the thoughts in his head. Su Mingan came out again, and called his daughter to the dining table, preparing for a father-daughter conversation and money education.\n\u201cMiao Miao, Jing Yuan is of the same age as you, and he is still a student. His pocket money is given by Uncle Xie and Grandma. You can\u2019t always spend his money. I have money, you can ask me for money. You can\u2019t just spend other men\u2019s money, okay?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nSu Mingan said solemnly, \u201cBecause you are short-handed, you accept the benefits of others, and the other party can use this to negotiate terms with you. In the end, you are the one who will suffer the real loss. We can only use our money, or in the future, what you earn by yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll remember that.\u201d\nSu Mingan thought it would be difficult for his daughter to accept the truth, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be resolved so smoothly.\nHe patted his daughter\u2019s head in relief, looked at the one thousand yuan on the table and said, \u201cThen you should find a chance to return the money for the grilled fish to Jing Yuan, and say it\u2019s your treat.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nThe next day her parents went to work, Su Miaomiao slept well and ate well, then she went to 1002 to find Xie Jingyuan.\nGrandma Tao was not at home either, Xie Jingyuan stood at the door, as if he didn\u2019t want to invite Su Miaomiao in, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao took out the money from her pocket and said what she was told.\nXie Jingyuan knew that Su Mingan wanted to teach his daughter the correct view of money, and he also supported it, saying, \u201cIt was more than five hundred in total, just give me five hundred.\u201d\nThe tranquility and obedience on Su Miaomiao\u2019s face disappeared, and she looked at him in disbelief, \u201cTaoist Master, you are so stingy. Do you really want it?\u201d\nHer father said that she couldn\u2019t spend other people\u2019s money casually, Su Miaomiao really accepted it.\nThe question was, what kind of outsider was Xie Jingyuan?\nShe was the cat of the Qingxu Temple, and he was the master of the Qingxu Temple, so it was right for him to support her. That was because she had her parents to take care of her, otherwise Xie Jingyuan should be responsible for her basic necessities of life.\nXie Jingyuan looked into her shining eyes, and said helplessly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to give it, then forget it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to give it, and told him, \u201cIf my father asks you, just say that I have already given you five hundred yuan.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan hummed perfunctorily.\nSu Miaomiao turned around and was about to leave, but Xie Jingyuan suddenly asked, \u201cWhat are you going to use the five hundred yuan for?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao turned her head, stared at him and said, \u201cI want to hide it. In case you don\u2019t care about me one day, and my parents don\u2019t want me anymore, I will still have money to buy food.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan felt that this was not a good sign.\nOnce the cat demon had the heart to stand on her own, her heart would become wilder, and one day she would run away.\nIn that world, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s methods of restraining demons were useless. The easiest way was to keep her in sight.\n\u201cIf you hide it, it can be discovered by uncle and aunt. Why don\u2019t you leave it to me and I will keep it for you? I will keep the account. If you want to use it in the future, I will give it to you,\u201d Xie Jingyuan suggested.\nSu Miaomiao asked vigilantly, \u201cWhat if you renege on my account?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes were calm, he said, \u201cCultivators don\u2019t lie.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao believed it, and walked to 1002, \u201cI want to see your accounts.\u201d\nThree minutes later, Su Miaomiao returned home contentedly with the remaining five hundred yuan.\nIn a blink of an eye, it was Sunday, August 29th, the last weekend before the first year of high school.\nAt around ten o\u2019clock in the morning, Su Mingan drove his family\u2019s SUV with Xie Jingyuan, Grandma Tao, Tang Shiwei, and Su Miaomiao to the villa where Xie Rong and Qiao Lili lived together.\nThe women sat in the back.\nTang Shiwei sat in the middle, with her daughter on the left and Grandma Tao on the right.\nShe chatted with Grandma Tao, \u201cMiaomiao is ignorant. Every time she sees Lanlan, she always gets into a fight. I feel embarrassed.\u201d\nGrandma Tao snorted, \u201cWhy are you telling me this? I like Miaomiao more than Lanlan. That child, Lanlan, is spoiled by her parents. Wasn\u2019t she the one who provoked Miaomiao first? I think Miaomiao is pretty good.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u2026\nSu Mingan joked, \u201cIt turns out that Miaomiao\u2019s unwillingness to suffer was learned from you.\u201d\nGrandma Tao said proudly, \u201cThat\u2019s how it should be. The child I raised can do whatever she likes.\u201d\nIf Su Miaomiao really obediently let Xie Wenlan bully her, she would be angry.\nTalking and laughing all the way, they arrived at the villa.\nWhen the two families got together, Xie Rong intentionally spared a day\u2019s schedule. He saw Su Mingan\u2019s car driving in from the living room, and he called Qiao Lili and the twins out to greet them.\n\u201cGrandmother!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "36": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-36/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXie Wenlan wore a white princess dress, ran up to Grandma Tao like a white butterfly, and hugged her.\nAt the same time, she looked provocatively at Su Miaomiao who was walking beside her.\nXie Wenlan had been jealous of Su Miaomiao since she was a child. Her grandma and elder brother liked Su Miaomiao more than her. Of course it was Su Miaomiao\u2019s fault! She was obviously an outsider, why was she trying to rob her of her grandma and elder brother?!\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s so hot, hurry up and let go,\u201d Grandma Tao held Xie Wenlan\u2019s shoulders to make her stand upright as she felt hot.\nXie Wenlan took that as one of the pieces of evidence that her grandma didn\u2019t like her.\n\u201cMiaomiao is getting more beautiful.\u201d After greeting Su Mingan and his wife, Qiao Lili praised with a smile, \u201cShe is beautiful and has good grades. I am really envious.\u201d\nBack when Qiao Lili was first pregnant, facing the two lovely children Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao, she still dreamed that she could give birth to a pair of equally lovely twins.\nAs a result, she got twins as she wished, but her own twins were far inferior to those two children in terms of appearance and grades.\nThat was all because of Xie Jingyuan. Su Miaomiao\u2019s grades were all improved due to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s help and tutoring. He had such patience, but he refused to tutor his younger brother and sister.\nIn order to raise twins, Qiao Lili had long wanted Xie Jingyuan and Grandma Tao to live with them in the villa, but they were both unwilling.\nQiao Lili hated Su Miaomiao.\nIt was all because of Su Miaomiao\u2019s beautiful face, who fascinated Xie Jingyuan at a young age. Otherwise why would Xie Jingyuan be reluctant? Wasn\u2019t a villa better than an old house?\nShe didn\u2019t like it in her heart. No matter how enthusiastic Qiao Lili was toward Su Miaomiao, she was clearly separated.\nGrandma Tao said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cThere is a swing in the garden, you can take Miaomiao to play.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t like socializing at all, so he called Su Miaomiao and left.\nXie Jingze and Xie Wenlan followed.\nIn the garden, Su Miaomiao was just about to walk toward the swing under the shade of the tree when Xie Wenlan quickened her pace and ran over, took possession of the swing, and looked at Su Miaomiao triumphantly, \u201cThis is my swing. If you promise me one thing, I will allow you to play.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan and said nothing.\nThe swing indeed belonged to the Xie family, and she had promised Xie Jingyuan that she would neither steal nor snatch other people\u2019s things.\n\u201cWant to play tennis?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked her.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up. She liked ball games, especially tennis.\nXie Jingyuan was wearing casual clothes, and Su Miaomiao was wearing denim shorts and a white T-shirt, which were just right for tennis.\nThere were two tennis courts in the villa. Xie Jingyuan asked the housekeeper to fetch the rackets.\nXie Wenlan had practiced tennis since elementary school. She glanced at Su Miaomiao\u2019s slender arms and legs, and thought that a student from an ordinary family like Su Miaomiao would never have the opportunity to play tennis often, and her skills must not be good.\n\u201cWant to compete?\u201d Xie Wenlan asked Su Miaomiao provocatively.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cCompete for what?\u201d\nXie Wenlan: \u201cDad gave me a pair of diamond hairpins, so I\u2019m sure he gave ones to you too. Let\u2019s compete. If I win, give me your hairpin.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIf you lose, you\u2019ll give me yours?\u201d\nXie Wenlan: \u201cOf course.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan again, \u201cCan I compete?\u201d A bet was not a robbery.\nXie Jingyuan nodded.\nSu Miaomiao and Xie Wenlan were very happy, and they were determined to win the other party\u2019s hairpins.\nXie Wenlan also deliberately changed into sportswear, put on a tennis cap, and held the racket very professionally.\nXie Jingyuan and Xie Jingze sat side by side in the spectator seats.\nXie Jingze: \u201cBrother, who do you think will win?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nOn the tennis court, Xie Wenlan warmed up with a standard posture, while Su Miaomiao on the opposite side just looked at her motionless.\nXie Jingze thought, even though Su Miaomiao was older, playing tennis required skill, and it was probably the younger sister who would win.\nAfter the warm-up was over, Xie Wenlan served the ball.\nShe had won an award in the tennis competition for elementary school. That ball had both speed and strength.\nSu Miaomiao just ran over and swung the tennis ball vigorously after it bounced.\nWith a \u201cbang\u201d, the turquoise ball fell to the ground at a speed that Xie Wenlan had no time to react to, as it bounced away quickly.\nXie Jingyuan reported the score indifferently.\nXie Wenlan was surprised by Su Miaomiao\u2019s counterattack, and at the same time was aroused with a stronger desire to win.\nHowever, no matter what kind of ball Xie Wenlan threw, it would be hit back by Su Miaomiao, and even if Xie Wenlan hit Su Miaomiao\u2019s ball, it was not strong enough to counterattack.\nThe game ended without any suspense, and Su Miaomiao won.\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Wenlan happily, \u201cGive me the hairpins.\u201d\nXie Wenlan gritted her teeth, and said angrily, \u201cI\u2019ll give it to you. I have better ones, so I won\u2019t care about such cheap ones.\u201d\nShe ran back to her room, angrily grabbed the pair of diamond hairpins that she actually liked very much, and stuffed them to Su Miaomiao, pretending not to care.\nHolding the hairpins in her palm, Su Miaomiao lowered her head, smelled them, and walked to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, \u201cThey smell, Taoist Master, please help me wash them.\u201d\nShe liked things that didn\u2019t smell of others, especially of people that she didn\u2019t like.\nXie Jingyuan took the pins and walked away.\nXie Wenlan stomped her feet in anger.\nSu Miaomiao swung her tennis racket and asked her, \u201cDo you want to compete with me for something else?\u201d\nXie Wenlan had already learned how powerful she was. She couldn\u2019t compete with her, so she went to complain to her parents angrily.\nXie Jingyuan washed the two hairpins and returned them to Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao smelled them again. They had a faint smell of hand sanitizer, lemon scent, much better than Xie Wenlan\u2019s smell.\nShe immediately put the hairpins on her head.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t say anything.\nXie Wenlan brought shame on herself, so he didn\u2019t blame the cat for showing off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "37": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-37/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMom, Su Miaomiao is wearing my hairpins,\u201d Xie Wenlan entered the living room, and said aggrievedly to Qiao Lili who was sitting on the sofa entertaining guests.\nSu Mingan and Tang Shiwei\u2019s hearts skipped a beat. The girls really got into a fight so early.\nXie Rong continued to chat with Su Mingan as if he didn\u2019t hear it.\nQiao Lili looked at her husband, smiled and asked her daughter, \u201cHave you two made a bet?\u201d\nXie Wenlan pursed her lips, \u201cYeah, I played tennis with her, and I bet on the hairpins for fun. Who knew that Su Miaomiao was serious and really wanted to take my pins. If I had won, I would definitely not be like that. She is my big sister, but she won\u2019t let go of me at all.\u201d\nQiao Lili took her daughter and sat down beside her, \u201cThey\u2019re just pins. I\u2019ll buy other ones for you later. If you lose, you lose. Don\u2019t be stingy.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cLanlan, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll tell Miaomiao later to return it to you.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to return it back, a game is a game. Adults shouldn\u2019t get involved in children\u2019s affairs.\u201d\nXie Rong finally interjected, \u201cMom is right, any competition should be taken seriously. Lanlan is a good tennis player and has won prizes, how can Miaomiao be so good?\u201d\nIn his impression, Su Miaomiao was a delicate and lazy little girl, who really didn\u2019t have any athletic ability.\nSpeaking of it, Grandma Tao was very proud, \u201cWhen Miao Miao and Jing Yuan were just learning tennis, the coach immediately fell in love with them, saying that they were both good prospects, and wanted to recruit them to the provincial team for special training. Unfortunately, the kids were not interested after all, and the training was too hard. So I didn\u2019t want to let the children go through that hardship.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cJing Yuan is not bad, but our Miao Miao has difficulty getting up early. I don\u2019t even dare to ask her to train for the provincial team.\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cNow that you said that, my hands got itchy. Ming An, let\u2019s go play with the kids.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cOkay.\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cThen let\u2019s go change our clothes.\u201d\nThe two fathers in their early forties went upstairs enthusiastically.\nXie Wenlan never expected that her complaint would go in that direction.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look too,\u201d Grandma Tao said to Tang Shiwei with a smile.\nSo, everyone went to the tennis court.\nSu Miaomiao was playing with Xie Jingyuan, there was no prize, she was just enjoying her time.\nShe couldn\u2019t even see Xie Jingyuan. There was only a blurry figure, and in her eyes, there was only the turquoise ball flying around, landing and bouncing off.\nRun, jump, swing, hit!\nEvery time she hit the ball successfully, Su Miaomiao would laugh happily.\nXie Jingyuan only thought he was teasing the cat.\n\u201cHey, Miaomiao played really well,\u201d Xie Rong, who had been watching for a few minutes, praised.\nSu Mingan couldn\u2019t hide his pride. His precious daughter didn\u2019t like training, otherwise she would definitely be the next female player in the Grand Slam in China.\nXie Jingyuan deliberately lost a ball to Su Miaomiao, rested for a while, and changed to a four-person game between the adult group and the children group.\nXie Rong and Su Mingan quickly entered into a rhythm, cooperating with each other, one attacking and the other defending.\nOn the children\u2019s side, Su Miaomiao was unwilling to cooperate with Xie Jingyuan, she would be unhappy if he dared to grab the ball from her.\nXie Jingyuan was stared at several times, so he simply stepped back and only hit the ball that Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t catch up with.\nWatching the match, Qiao Lili said jokingly, \u201cMiao Miao is so strong, the match has become her one-on-two.\u201d\nTang Shiwei just kept a faint smile, but she was also very worried in her heart, her daughter\u2019s temper was really \u201cspecial\u201d.\nGrandma Tao: \u201cIt\u2019s enough if Miao Miao is happy playing with the family. Miaomiao is so good that her one-on-two can last for so long.\u201d\nIndeed, Su Miaomiao was only fifteen years old that year. Although the two fathers were both in their early forties, they were both middle-aged men who paid attention to fitness. After playing a game for so long, they still couldn\u2019t beat Su Miaomiao.\n\u201cMiao Miao is really fast,\u201d Xie Rong took the time to say to Su Mingan.\nSu Mingan chuckled. It was better to be fast. If she met a bad student she couldn\u2019t beat at school, at least she could run away.\nHowever, Su Miaomiao\u2019s physical strength was limited after all, and with her style of play, she couldn\u2019t last long. When she realized that she couldn\u2019t catch the ball, her enthusiasm quickly faded, and she announced, \u201cI\u2019m tired, let\u2019s stop playing!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan left with her, and were replaced by the twins.\nGrandma Tao handed Su Miaomiao a bottle of mineral water.\nSu Miaomiao unscrewed the cap and drank.\nBecause she had just had a strenuous exercise, her face was flushed, like a freshly washed peach, with a few crystal drops of water.\nQiao Lili knew that it was actually beads of sweat, but Su Miaomiao did not make people feel that she was in an embarrassed state at all. On the contrary, she was so beautiful that even a woman couldn\u2019t help staring at her.\nGrandma Tao said, \u201cMiaomiao, bath in my room. I\u2019ll find you a set of clothes.\u201d\nQiao Lili: \u201cLanlan has some new clothes, but I don\u2019t know if they will fit Miaomiao.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cNo, I\u2019ll go to Jingyuan\u2019s room to have a look, there should be his old clothes in the closet.\u201d\nWhen that villa was just renovated, Xie Rong reserved a room for Grandma Tao and Xie Jingyuan. The two would come to stay for a few days every year.\nGrandma Tao understood that with Su Miaomiao\u2019s temper, she would not accept the twins\u2019 clothes.\nShe took the two children to the villa, and rummaged through Xie Jinyuan\u2019s closet, and sure enough, found a set of shorts and T-shirts that her grandson wore the previous summer. Su Miaomiao should be able to wear them too\nAfter taking the clothes, Grandma Tao went to her room.\nSu Miaomiao was drinking water, and the newly won diamond hairpins on her head were shining brightly. Grandma Tao thought that if she turned back to the age of a high school student, she would definitely like it too.\n\u201cMiaomiao is good at tennis, you can bet against Lanlan, but if you encounter a game that you are not good at, no matter how many diamonds, gold or other things you want, you can\u2019t bet, okay? Don\u2019t do things you are not sure of, or you will suffer a lot,\u201d Grandma Tao taught her.\nSu Miaomiao thought about it and nodded.\nIn her previous life, she didn\u2019t know how to pluck men. After hearing the old demons say that plucking could speed up her cultivation, she went there foolishly, and was then arrested by Xie Jingyuan.\nDemons must be self-aware and less aggressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "38": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-38/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone packed up and sat in the shade of the garden to have a barbecue.\nSu Miaomiao liked to eat grilled small yellow croakers. Su Mingan made it himself for his daughter, but before the roast was finished, an important call came. He had to put down the small yellow croakers to answer it.\nTang Shiwei was just about to take over her husband\u2019s unfinished cooking, but Xie Jingyuan walked to the grill and helped flip through the five small yellow croakers.\nTang Shiwei secretly smiled, who would be dissatisfied with such a prospective son-in-law?\nWhen Su Mingan came back, five small yellow croakers were already placed in front of Su Miaomiao.\nWhen Su Mingan looked at his wife, Tang Shiwei looked at Xie Jingyuan who was silently eating roasted corn.\nSu Mingan got a little uncomfortable. He took a fish from his daughter to taste, and found that the taste was not inferior to his. Su Mingan immediately felt a sense of crisis. He could already imagine that his daughter would really marry Xie Jingyuan in the future. His status in the family would change.\nXie Rong grilled several skewers of squid, because his son was close, he handed over two skewers.\nXie Jingyuan took them, and then naturally put them on Su Miaomiao\u2019s plate.\nHis son was so good at taking care of the person he liked at such a young age.\nHowever, Xie Rong was also very satisfied with Su Miaomiao, who was beautiful and smart. Seeing the grown-up child with his own eyes, his feelings were different.\nAfter the dinner party, the five left.\nQiao Lili stood beside Xie Rong, looking at the SUV going away, smiled and said to Xie Rong, \u201cIf didnt know them, I would have thought that they are a close family of five.\u201d\nXie Rong glanced at her indifferently.\nHe thought he was rich, but he also thought he was not a good son. He had been busy in business those years, and his mother had been sick several times, and it was Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei who were busy running around.\nQiao Lili had to take care of the twins, and she was also very tired. He didn\u2019t ask Qiao Lili to care for his mother, but he didn\u2019t bother to listen to Qiao Lili\u2019s eccentricity to provoke his relationship with the Su family.\n\u201cYou guys are going to start school too, have you finished your summer homework?\u201d Xie Rong asked the twins.\nXie Wenlan: \u201cIt\u2019s summer homework, the first grade teacher will not check.\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t check, you won\u2019t do it? You just lack self-discipline. Become like your elder brother, who reviewed high school courses in advance during the summer vacation.\u201d\nXie Wenlan tilted her head and muttered softly, \u201cYes, yes, elder brother is the best, and my brother and I are not as good as him.\u201d\nXie Rong pursed his lips and went to the study alone.\nQiao Lili stared at her daughter resentfully, \u201cDon\u2019t you know how to say something nice to your father?\u201d\nTheir IQ was not comparable but EQ should be higher anyway, right? With Xie Jingyuan\u2019s iceberg temper, as long as her son and daughter acted cute, they would definitely win Xie Rong\u2019s favour.\nXie Wenlan was impatient to listen to the lesson, turned around and ran away.\nQiao Lili pinned all her hopes on her son, \u201cJingze, your mother will hire you the best tutor during middle school. You should study hard and try to catch up with your elder brother.\u201d\nXie Jingze: \u2026\nEven if he turned into an eight-winged angel, he wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up!\nThe next day was the last day of August, and also Su Miaomiao\u2019s last day of vacation.\nAt 6:30 in the morning, Su Mingan ruthlessly knocked on the door of his daughter\u2019s room, \u201cMiaomiao, get up, you agreed to get used to the high school schedule from today.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pulled up the quilt to cover her head.\nSu Mingan yelled a few times, and said to his wife, \u201cForget it, let her sleep in for another day. Tomorrow is just the start of school, and there is no need to get up early today.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cYou are just spoiling her!\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cYou do what you want.\u201d\nTang Shiwei turned around and went to brush her teeth.\nOn September 1st, Su Miaomiao finally woke up at eight o\u2019clock after her father kept knocking on the door.\nAfter washing her face and changing her clothes, she came to the living room, and saw Grandma Tao and Xie Jingyuan sitting there, like every school day before.\nAfter breakfast, Su Mingan drove and sent the children to school with Grandma Tao.\nStill on the way, Su Miaomiao received a call from Feng Xiaoyu, \u201cMiaomiao, I saw your name. It\u2019s amazing, you and Xie Jingyuan are in the same class again, both in Class 9!\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s voice was so loud that everyone in the car could hear it.\nAfter hanging up the phone, Su Miaomiao looked at her father, \u201cDad, have you asked for help again?\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cNot this time, but I heard that Class 9 and Class 10 of each grade in No. 1 High School have always been the classes with the most top students.\u201d\nSome schools even had experimental classes and key classes. No. 1 High School did not make such an obvious classification, but there were some special arrangements.\nBoth his daughter and Xie Jingyuan were academic scholars, so the probability of being grouped together was quite high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "39": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-39/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe class list of freshmen was posted on the notice board of the school.\nAll freshmen would first check the class placement and find their own class when they arrive at the school.\nEven though they already knew the result, Su Miaomiao and the others came there and found the list of Class 9 directly. Xie Jingyuan was at the top of the list.\nThe last four digits of each student\u2019s number were composed of \u201cclass\u201d and \u201cthe rank of the student\u2019s high school entrance examination results in the class\u201d.\nFor example, the last four digits of Xie Jingyuan were \u201c0901\u201d, and Su Miaomiao was \u201c0903\u201d.\nFrom elementary school to junior high school, Su Miaomiao had long been used to being lower to Xie Jingyuan, but why was there another stranger ahead of her?\nSu Miaomiao squeezed away the two classmates who were in the way, and stared at the list.\n\u201c0902\u201d was a guy named Xu Shou.\nSu Miaomiao had never heard of that name, and when she asked Xie Jingyuan, he had no impression either. He was probably not from their middle school.\nSu Mingan encouraged her daughter, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, when there is competition, you will be motivated, and try to surpass this classmate Xu in the next exam.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded. She would definitely do that.\nThe two classmates who were squeezed away by her were a little unhappy at first, but when they found out from the conversation that Su Miaomiao was actually the third-ranked top student in the class, and she was also super-beautiful, their eyes turned into admiration when they looked at Su Miaomiao.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go to the classroom first.\u201d\nEach grade in No. 1 High School occupied a separate teaching building. The teaching building for the first grade was the farthest from the school gate and the closest to the playground.\nClass 9 was located in the second classroom on the second floor of the south building.\nThe classroom was empty, with only one class teacher, two students and their parents.\nThe students that were going to stay in the hostel went to the dormitory building after receiving their things. Other students needed to get their campus cards, school uniforms, and military training uniforms, and then they could move around freely, go around the campus or go home. Late evening self-study was very important, and new books would be distributed to students.\n\u00a0\u201cName,\u201d the teacher in charge looked at Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao.\n\u201cXie Jingyuan.\u201d\n\u201cSu Miaomiao.\u201d\nThe class teacher\u2019s heart moved, as they were top students.\nTeachers may not despise students with poor grades, but they basically liked top students, and the class teacher of Class 9 was no exception. His eyes looking at the two students got much more kind.\nXie Jingyuan received two sets of school uniform and one set of military training uniform.\nSu Miaomiao received them as well.\nAfter bidding farewell to the class teacher, they went to the cafeteria to recharge the campus card. For eating in the cafeteria and shopping in the school supermarket, they must use the campus card.\nWalking out of the teaching building, Grandma Tao said to Su Mingan, \u201cYou go to work, I\u2019ll stay with Miaomiao and Jing Yuan.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cThen how will you go back?\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cIt\u2019s only one kilometer away, so I\u2019ll take a walk.\u201d\nSu Mingan looked at Xie Jingyuan and left in peace.\nThe car was parked outside the school, and Su Mingan strode out. When he approached the school gate, he saw a tall and thin male student walking in with a suitcase.\nThere were freshmen everywhere, but that male student could attract Su Mingan\u2019s attention because his temperament was too special.\nHim being good-looking was only second, being tall was not a big deal, but the male student\u2019s exposed arms were strong and full of muscles.\nLike Xie Jingyuan, although he also had muscles, it was not obvious when he put on clothes, but that male student\u2019s T-shirt fitted perfectly on his body.\nIt was not the kind of muscles that were particularly exaggerated, and the blood vessels were bursting out. They were just right, and they were Tang Shiwei\u2019s favorite type.\nWhen Su Mingan looked at the male student, the male student suddenly looked at him and sniffed.\nSu Mingan: \u2026\nThe male student\u2019s introverted probing eyes and sniffing movements made him feel weird, so he quickened his pace and walked away.\nWhen he was about to get in the car, Su Mingan turned around, and saw that the student turned sideways, still staring at him.\nHe glared at the stinky boy, and got into the car.\nXu Shou watched the car drive away, and went to check the class information first, and smelled the cat again in front of the notice board of Class 9. It was so strong that he almost ignored another cool smell like autumn dew.\nThe smell on a demon was inherently heavier than that on a human.\nXu Shou followed the cat\u2019s smell and came to Class 9.\nThe class teacher gave him a bunch of dormitory supplies, so Xu Shou had no choice but to go to the dormitory to put his luggage first.\nAfter tidying up his own bed, Xu Shou ignored the few roommates who arrived earlier, returned to the teaching building, and went after the smell again.\nAfter walking around the entire campus, Xu Shou walked out of the school and finally came to a community called \u201cPearl Garden\u201d.\nHe wanted to go in, but the security guard at the door stopped him, and asked, \u201cAre you from this community? I haven\u2019t seen you before.\u201d\nXu Shou, who had just been admitted to a high school in the city from the countryside, was silent, then turned and left under the suspicious eyes of the security guard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Jing Yuan will tell you about military training.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan had nothing to say, so he used his notebook to search for a military training video, and asked Su Miaomiao to watch it by herself.\nSu Miaomiao hated all kinds of rules the most. She had a hard time getting used to sitting upright during class, and now she actually had to learn another way of walking according to the instructor\u2019s request?\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do military training,\u201d Su Miaomiao turned off the notebook laptop and peeked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cScores will be deducted if you don\u2019t do military training. You won\u2019t be able to surpass the second place in your class.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hesitated.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her and said, \u201cIf you perform well in military training, I can play tennis with you.\u201d\nShe was a very picky cat. She liked to play tennis continuously, and didn\u2019t like when Xie Wenlan lost a ball and had wasted time changing it. She had no patience to wait. The requirements for the opponent were very high. Among the familiar relatives and friends, currently only Xie Jingyuan could satisfyingly play with Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while and bargained, \u201cThe military training takes seven days, and you have to play with me seven times.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cOkay.\u201d\nIn that way, the two negotiated the conditions related to military training.\nAfter dinner at 5:30, the two put their school bags on their backs, and Xie Jingyuan rode a bicycle to drive Su Miaomiao to school.\nIt took about 15 minutes to walk for a distance of more than one kilometer, and it was much faster to ride a bicycle.\nSu Miaomiao leaned her head against Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back and sighed, \u201cAre we going to study at night from now on?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s like this in high school.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIt will be so late after school ends, I won\u2019t have time to sleep. My grades are so good, can I leave school early?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThe school will not give special treatment to students for this reason, and No. 1 High School recruits students from the whole city. If you rank high in junior high school, you may not be able to maintain it in the future. Especially some students from rural areas whose teachers were not as good. But if they receive the same education as us in No. 1 High School, their grades can be significantly improved. It is not certain whether you can keep your rank in Class 9.\u201d\nOnly then did Su Miaomiao know the difference between high school and junior high school.\nWhen they reached the school, Xie Jingyuan rode his bicycle in, and finally parked his bicycle at the teaching building\nThe starting time of evening self-study was announced by the class teacher as 6:30, and they were early.\nSu Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan up to the second floor and walked toward the classroom of Class 9.\nWhen she came to the door of the classroom, Su Miaomiao sniffed.\nXie Jingyuan looked back at her.\nShe retained the sense of smell of a century-old cat demon, so she must have discovered something by sniffing like that.\nUnder his gaze, Su Miaomiao said with disgust, \u201cI smell a dog.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\nIn the previous life, a group of demons gathered to attack Qingxu Temple, and the surviving Taoist masters moved to a safe place according to his request, only three demons did not go in.\nIn order to protect him, the dog was seriously injured and tried to bite the evil demon with all his strength.\nThe bird\u2019s wings were broken by the big demon and it fell into a coma.\nThe cat was low-level and timid, hiding in a tree hole and shivering.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan died with the group of demons, Su Miaomiao was the closest to him.\nAfter being reincarnated into the world, Xie Jingyuan kept thinking, if Su Miaomiao could be reincarnated with him, would the dog and bird also come?\nGood deeds were rewarded with good deeds, those evil demons would die when they die, and they would not have the chance to be reincarnated as human beings, so there was no need to worry.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the classroom door, raised his hand and pushed it open.\nThere were sixty students in the 9th class, and the classroom was 70% full.\nSome students knew each other and formed a tablemate spontaneously.\nWhen the classroom door was suddenly pushed open, everyone stopped talking tacitly. Except for two or three sleeping on the table, everyone who was awake looked toward the door.\nLike a majestic class teacher, Xie Jingyuan silently glanced at those students.\nOn the last seat by the window in the south, Xu Shou stood up abruptly, staring at Xie Jingyuan with burning eyes, and silently clenched his hands hanging on both sides.\nLooking at each other, Xie Jingyuan smiled, looked at his watch, and motioned for Xu Shou to come out.\nXie Jingyuan retreated to the corridor, looked left and right, and walked toward a remote corner.\nSu Miaomiao pouted unhappily, but still followed.\n\u201cTaoist Master, it really is you!\u201d\nMeeting in the corner, Xu Shou excitedly said to Xie Jingyuan. He only had Xie Jingyuan in his eyes, his black eyes, which were usually indifferent to other people, glowed with an almost devout light.\nSu Miaomiao seemed to have returned to Qingxu in her previous life, watching that big black-haired dog always run over and wag his tail when Xie Jingyuan came back from outside.\nXie Jingyuan was as calm as ever, but his tone of speaking with Xu Shou was obviously milder, just like the difference between treating the loyal dog demon and the criminal wild cat demon.\n\u201cWhere do you live? We were born in Anshi City.\u201d\n\u201cI was born in Stone Brook Town.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded, \u201cSince you are a human being now, you have to take care of the elders.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Taoist Master, I know.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was sleepy and yawned.\nXu Shou gave her a cold look. That cat, who was greedy for life and afraid of death, usually received so much care from the Taoist master, but at critical moments, she watched the Taoist master in distress.\nSu Miaomiao was stared at, but also stared back fiercely.\nXu Shou approached Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, why is she with you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be with him?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cI didn\u2019t talk to you, you don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She was very sure that Xu Shou\u2019s strength was stronger than that of the Taoist master.\nAs a little cat demon living in the cracks of all kinds of big and old demons, Su Miaomiao knew how to play.\nShe didn\u2019t respond to Xu Shou anymore, and went to the classroom alone.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her back and explained to Xu Shou, \u201cOur elders are friends and have always been neighbors.\u201d\nXu Shou understood the Taoist master\u2019s character very well, who had a cold face and a kind heart. If the cat demon pestered the Taoist master, he might not have the heart to refuse.\n\u201cThis kind of heartless person\u2026 Taoist Master, you should keep a distance from her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI have my own reasons. We are all classmates now, so don\u2019t be too hostile to her, let alone do anything.\u201d\nCats and dogs didn\u2019t get along, it was natural. As long as the two didn\u2019t cause trouble, Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to interfere too much with Xu Shou and Su Miaomiao\u2019s relationship.\nHe was not that free.\nXu Shou pursed his lips and nodded not so willingly.\nXie Jingyuan thought for a while and asked, \u201cDo you have any news about the bird?\u201d\nSeeing Xu Shou, Xie Jingyuan became even more suspicious that the bird in the temple had also been reincarnated there.\nXu Shou shook his head, \u201cNot yet.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWell, let\u2019s go to the classroom first.\u201d\nXu Shou instinctively took two steps behind, followed Xie Jingyuan like a bodyguard, and suggested, \u201cNo one sat at my desk yet, will you want to sit with me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cNo, I want to keep an eye on Su Miaomiao.\u201d\nXu Shou frowned, and immediately understood the painstaking efforts of the Taoist master. The cat always behaved obediently in front of the Taoist master. Once the Taoist master was away, she would always cause trouble everywhere. One day, she stole a little Taoist master\u2019s purse, then another day hid in the dark to attack the unprepared bord. At first the cat also tried to provoke him, but he threw her down, bit her head and threatened her, so she didn\u2019t dare to do it again.\n\u201cThen sit in front of me, there is no one at the table in front of me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan agreed, but when he opened the classroom door again, he saw Su Miaomiao in the seat farthest from Xu Shou.\nXu Shou sat at the last table in the south, and Su Miaomiao chose the other end of the diagonal line\u2014the first person in the north row, and she was the first one anyone could see when they entered the door.\nXie Jingyuan stopped in front of Su Miaomiao\u2019s desk. With his height, it was impossible for him to sit in the front row.\nHe stopped, and Xu Shou also stopped.\nSu Miaomiao glanced at him and pinched her nose with her hand.\nXu Shou\u2019s face turned dark.\nThey were all demons, and they all smelled like demons, but the cat always made such a gesture of dislike toward him.\n\u201cYou go back first,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said to Xu Shou.\nXu Shou walked away with a dark face.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao again, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao asked warily, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWe\u2019re going to sit in front of Xu Shou.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, he stinks too much!\u201d\nThe other students who were eavesdropping looked shocked, and a few looked at Xu Shou in disbelief. What a handsome boy, did he actually stink?\nAlthough Xu Shou was far away, the classroom was quiet at that moment, the students were all watching. Su Miaomiao\u2019s voice was not low, so Xu Shou of course heard it too.\nLooking at the questioning and shocked eyes of other students, Xu Shou\u2019s expression became even uglier.\nXie Jingyuan took advantage of his classmates watching Xu Shou, and whispered to Su Miaomiao, \u201cNo? Then I will come to school by myself in the future.\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, Xie Jingyuan went to Xu Shou\u2019s side with his school bag on his back.\nSu Miaomiao looked at the blackboard angrily.\nOn one side, there was the Taoist master and the big black dog, and on the other, there was the Taoist master and the bicycle.\nAfter hesitating for three minutes, Su Miaomiao grabbed the schoolbag she had put on the table, and chased after Xie Jingyuan with an unhappy expression.\nThe three of them were all good-looking who could be picked out to act in campus idol dramas. They performed such a short but sparkling drama just after the class started. The front and back tables whispered.\nBefore everyone could discuss anything, the class teacher in black shirt came in, stood at the door of the classroom, pushed his glasses, and shouted at the boys inside, \u201cBoys, go to my office to get the textbooks.\u201d\nFor the students, every time a new book was released, it was an exciting event. Immediately, several boys jumped out and walked out excitedly.\nXie Jingyuan and Xu Shou also went.\nSu Miaomiao sat in the second-to-last row on the south side, watching Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou leave the classroom one after the other.\n\u201cHey, Su Miaomiao, do you and Xie Jingyuan know that boy?\u201d\nIn the middle row of seats near the front, a round-faced girl with a ponytail left the seat, came over,.and asked Su Miaomiao curiously.\nSu Miaomiao stared at her for a while and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\nThe round-faced girl blushed and was extremely embarrassed, \u201cDon\u2019t you know me? We were in the same class in the second grade of junior high school. My name is Wang Min.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t remember her at all. In other words, except for Feng Xiaoyu and Cheng Yue, who had been together with her since kindergarten, she didn\u2019t remember the other students.\nShe didn\u2019t need to remember. She needed to concentrate on listening to the teacher, leave, and hurry up to sleep after class. She could ask Xie Jingyuan for anything, why did she need to know others?\nShe denied it so directly, without any embarrassment, the way she looked at Wang Min was like looking at a stranger.\nWith so many students around watching, Wang Min couldn\u2019t be more embarrassed.\nSu Miaomiao felt that this girl named \u201cWang Min\u201d was very strange, why did she suddenly blush?\n\u201cHey, you usually study. It\u2019s normal if you don\u2019t know me,\u201d Wang Min found a way for herself in time and continued to inquire about the relationship between Su Miaomiao and Xu Shou.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\nThe Taoist master said that the events of the previous life should not be told to anyone other than them, including parents.\nWang Min was slapped twice by her, and couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, so she returned to her seat with a blushing face in annoyance.\nSu Miaomiao found that other students were looking at her. She had nothing to do, and stared back one by one.\nThose who didn\u2019t know her all looked away. Those who used to be in the same school tried to wave and say hello, but when they met Su Miaomiao\u2019s strange eyes, they turned their heads in a self-defeating way.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Su Miaomiao too proud?\u201d Fang Jing, Wang Min\u2019s tablemate, mocked in a low voice.\nWang Min and Fang Jing were classmates in the third grade of junior high school, and they both knew Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan, two top students, but Fang Jing had never been in the same class with them, and it was only then she found that Su Miaomiao was such a person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "42": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-42/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWang Min snorted, \u201cShe is a top student, so she naturally looks down on ordinary people like us.\u201d\nIn fact, the students who could be assigned to Class 9 were all the top students in various junior high schools, but compared with Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao, they were indeed reduced to ordinary.\nFang Jing: \u201cIs Xie Jingyuan the same as her?\u201d\nWang Min immediately shook her head, \u201cXie Jingyuan looks cold, but he is actually very polite to his classmates. If you have any questions, ask him, and he will help answer them when he is free.\u201d\nThe premise was that she must ask when Su Miaomiao was not around.\nSu Miaomiao was extremely domineering, she always slept between classes, and had a bad temper. No one dared to speak loudly then, especially the front, back, left, and right desks. If someone went to Xie Jingyuan to ask for help, Su Miaomiao would be fierce. Xie Jingyuan even pampered Su Miaomiao.\nFang Jing: \u201cSo, the two of them are really in love?\u201d\nWang Min didn\u2019t want to admit it, but she had to nod sourly.\nXie Jingyuan liked Su Miaomiao, that was already a fact recognized by the teachers and students of their junior high school.\nWhen the class teacher and the boys returned to the classroom with stacks of new books, only one of the sixty desks in Class 9 was still vacant, which was the seat next to Xu Shou.\nThe class teacher asked the boys to distribute the books first.\nWhen it was sent to Su Miaomiao, almost every boy dared not look directly at her, and put the book down very gently, as if afraid of scaring her.\nOnly Xu Shou threw a physics book in front of Su Miaomiao heavily.\nSu Miaomiao took a pen from Xie Jingyuan, pressed it against the spine of the physics book, and pushed it onto his desk bit by bit.\nXu Shou returned to his seat after distributing the book, and after a while, Xie Jingyuan also came back.\nSeeing two physics books on the table, Xie Jingyuan wanted to give one to Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao immediately said, \u201cYou clean it up for me, the book is smelly.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u2026\nXie Jingyuan: \u2026\nAlthough her words seemed to be deliberately provoking Xu Shou, Xie Jingyuan knew that she had always been a clean freak who didn\u2019t like other people\u2019s smell.\nLike Xie Wenlan\u2019s pair of diamond hairpins, which were so shiny and in line with her taste, but she still wanted him to wash it first, as she would never use it if not cleaned.\nTherefore, Xie Jingyuan took out a small package of wet tissues specially prepared for her at any time from his school bag, took out one, took the physics book, and carefully wiped it along the hard cover. He wiped it with a wet tissue, then wiped it with a dry tissue, and finally wiped it with his sleeve to completely cover up the remaining dog smell, and handed it to Su Miaomiao.\nWhen Su Miaomiao smelled it, she was quite satisfied.\nWang Min, who was in the same class with them, was used to such a scene.\u00a0\nSeeing Xu Shou for the first time, her whole body was stiff, and she looked at Xie Jingyuan in disbelief.\nXie Jingyuan noticed her gaze, but he didn\u2019t turn his head back, and looked directly at the class teacher who was about to speak on the podium.\nThe class teacher cleared his throat, \u201cI\u2019ll check the attendance first. The students who are called, raise your hand. Xie Jingyuan.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan raised his hand.\n\u201cXu Shou.\u201d\nXu Shou raised his slender and powerful right arm.\n\u201cSu Miaomiao.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao lifted higher than Xu Shou!\nXu Shou: \u2026What is the significance of such a comparison?\nThe roll call continued, and when the 52nd student was called, no one raised their hand for the first time.\nThe class teacher focused on the fat male student who was yawning, \u201cGu Jialing.\u201d\nThe chubby male student closed his mouth and wiped away the tears from the corners of his eyes. Seeing the class teacher staring at him, he shrank and lowered his head. He was not Gu Jialing.\nThe class teacher had no choice but to call the rest of the students.\nAfter finishing, the class teacher checked the time. It was already 6:40. It was the first evening study session at the beginning of school. Gu Jialing dared to be late for such an important evening study session.\nSuch a special student made the class teacher focus on restoring the memory of the name \u201cGu Jialing\u201d.\nAt the beginning of the school day, Gu Jialing did not show up. It was his assistant who went through the admission procedures for him.\nThe class teacher still remembered that the suit the assistant wore looked very expensive.\nThe classroom door was suddenly pushed open by a strong force.\nThe teacher narrowed his eyes slightly, and leaned over coldly.\nStanding at the door was a tall, slender boy with a schoolbag on his shoulder.\nThe boy\u2019s facial features were outstanding, and his indistinguishable handsomeness caused gasps in the classroom, but the class teacher first saw a strand of blue hair on top of the boy\u2019s head, and the second thing he saw was the shining bright sapphire stud earrings on the boy\u2019s right earlobe.\nOf course, the teacher was from an ordinary family and had no experience with gems, so he didn\u2019t know whether the boy was wearing a real gem or a piece of blue glass.\nSu Miaomiao and Xu Shou stretched their necks.\nXie Jingyuan knew that his force value was definitely the strongest among them, but in terms of sense of smell, he may only be slightly stronger than ordinary people.\nSu Miaomiao and Xu Shou smelled the familiar smell of the bird.\nXu Shou, who was sitting behind Xie Jingyuan, leaned forward, approached his straight back, and said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s the bird.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan had already figured it out from Su Miaomiao\u2019s reaction and the abnormal hair color of the male student at the door.\nThe demon was a blue-feathered bird, which had exactly the same color as the male student\u2019s hair and earring.\nEarring\u2026\nAt that moment, Xie Jingyuan looked at Jialing in the same way as the class teacher on the podium.\nGu Jialing arrived in Anshi at ten o\u2019clock in the morning, and stayed in a villa that the old man bought for him.\nThe villa was located in the urban area. It was only a 15-minute drive from No. 1 High School. There may be some congestion during peak hours.\nGu Jialing came to Anshi alone for the first time, and sent an assistant to register for the school. He played wildly in Anshi for a day, and went back to the villa to sleep in the afternoon. If the assistant hadn\u2019t knocked on the door to wake him up, he would have forgotten the evening self-study.\nIf he got late for class, his pocket money would be deducted by the old man. Gu Jialing started running as soon as he entered the school gate, rushing to the classroom as fast as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "43": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-43/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a special physique, Gu Jialing didn\u2019t breathe much, but the moment the door was pushed open, he was startled by the excessive silence inside.\nThe classroom was full.\nThe class teacher looked at him. But Gu Jialing didn\u2019t care, just when he was about to look for a seat, three familiar faces suddenly broke into his field of vision.\nThe schoolbag in Gu Jialing\u2019s hand fell to the ground.\nSu Miaomiao smiled and waved to him.\nGu Jialing almost instinctively took off the gemstone earring from his right ear, and quickly put it in his pocket.\nThe smile on Su Miaomiao\u2019s face disappeared, and she stared at him in displeasure.\nOn the podium, the head teacher saw that Gu Jialing took off the earring, so his face looked a little better. He asked, \u201cGu Jialing, right?\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s attention was focused on another person, he nodded perfunctorily, and bent down to pick up his school bag.\nThe class teacher looked at the strand of blue hair on top of his head, \u201cThe school stipulates that students cannot dye their hair. You have to dye it back tonight or cut it off. In short, you must have black hair when you come to school tomorrow.\u201d\nGu Jialing finally gave the class teacher a straight look.\nThat summer vacation, he had blue hair on his head. Considering the school rules in high school, he dyed most of his hair black. He didn\u2019t expect that even such a small strand could not be accepted.\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Gu Jialing said angrily.\nThe class teacher had encountered many thorns, and Gu Jialing\u2019s attitude was considered good, so he didn\u2019t continue to scold him, and pointed to the empty seat next to Xu Shou.\nGu Jialing walked toward the three acquaintances stiffly.\nWhen he was in Qingxu Temple, Gu Jialing didn\u2019t like the cat demon who was always waiting for opportunities to bully him, and the big black dog who was cold. Gu Jialing was only a little grateful to Xie Jingyuan who saved him.\nThe Taoist master saved him, but he didn\u2019t ask him to stay in Qingxu Temple.\nBut Gu Jialing had no other place to go.\nHe was targeted by an ugly female crow. The crow demon\u2019s cultivation was higher than him, and Gu Jialing only learned to transform into a human form. He was no match for the crow demon. Fortunately, Xie Jingyuan appeared and rescued him back.\nAfter recovering, Gu Jialing hesitated. He would rather stay in Qingxu Temple and would rather fight with that cat at any time than go to the deep mountains and old forests full of dangers.\nGu Jialing was getting closer by time.\nSu Miaomiao changed her mind and said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, sit behind me and let him sit here.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan remained expressionless, as if he didn\u2019t hear.\nSu Miaomiao gently pushed him.\nAs if seeing her intentions, Gu Jialing quickened her pace and sat in the empty seat beside Xu Shou as if in a hurry.\nAlthough it was still very close to the cat, sitting at the back could always prevent the cat from making a sudden attack in time. If he sat next to her, he would be too miserable.\nSu Miaomiao turned around following Gu Jialing\u2019s movements, and was just about to speak, but the class teacher stared at them coldly, \u201cOkay, stop talking. Now let\u2019s start the first class meeting of this semester. Let me introduce myself, my name is\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan also used his eyes to force Su Miaomiao to sit upright.\nGu Jialing let out a long breath of relief, then kept his upper body still, and asked Xu Shou quietly, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\nXu Shou was a good student who abided by discipline. When the teacher spoke, he would never speak.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe silently observed the priest and the cat in front of him.\nThe Taoist master was still the Taoist master in his impression, but more youthful. The cat\u2019s face did not seem to have changed much from her previous life\u2019s human form, and her figure was so enchanting.\nIn Gu Jialing\u2019s heart, all kinds of gossip popped up.\n\u201cOkay, take your school bags and stand in the corridor. The boys and girls should line up according to their height. Let\u2019s rearrange the seats.\u201d\nIt was a very common way to arrange desk seats according to height.\nThe students acted immediately and packed all the books just distributed into their school bags.\nThere were so many books, so it was so heavy. Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t bother to talk, and just pushed them to Xie Jingyuan.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan stood up, he was carrying his schoolbag in one hand.\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou frowned and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cDon\u2019t you know how to carry it yourself?\u201d How could she use the Taoist master\u2019s kindness to order him to do things?\nSu Miaomiao whispered, \u201cThe dog caught the mouse.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u2026\nBefore Su Miaomiao went to Qingxu Temple, he was indeed in charge of catching the rats that came to Qingxu Temple to steal food.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan looked over coldly, both of them kept their mouths shut.\nThe students stood in line in the corridor, and other classes also started dividing seats.\n\u201cDoes anyone have any special requirements for seats? For example, myopia without glasses, or high myopia, glasses can only be adjusted to a certain degree.\u201d\nFive students raised their hands, one of them was Xie Jingyuan.\nSeeing that, Xu Shou also raised his hand.\nThe class teacher first asked the specific situation of the six of them.\nAll four were short-sighted. When it was Xie Jingyuan\u2019s turn, under the kind eyes of the class teacher, Xie Jingyuan said as usual, \u201cTeacher, Su Miaomiao doesn\u2019t like to listen to lectures in class, only I can control her. I hope you can arrange for me to sit at the same table with her. It doesn\u2019t matter if we sit in the last row.\u201d\nIn fact, Su Mingan and Grandma Tao accompanied the children to report during the day, and had already told the head teacher about the situation.\nWithout the parents\u2019 guarantee, the class teacher would probably suspect that the two children had fallen in love with each other. If the parents came forward, the class teacher would naturally not object. After agreeing, he looked at Xu Shou who raised his hand last.\nXu Shou said directly, \u201cI want to sit behind Xie Jingyuan, he has good grades. I want to learn from him.\u201d\nThe teacher appreciated the self-motivation of the number two top student in the class. Xu Shou and Xie Jingyuan were about the same height, so it was not a special arrangement.\nAt that time, Xie Jingyuan glanced at Gu Jialing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "44": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-44/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGu Jialing was still under a certain amount of pressure facing the Taoist master, so he had to move closer to Xu Shou, showing that he was still the bird of Qingxu Temple.\nIn the final qualifying result, the four sat back in their original positions.\nNext, the students went to the podium to introduce themselves one by one, starting from the first row in the south according to the seat, in addition to the name, one could also mention hobbies and so on.\nXie Jingyuan said nothing.\nSu Miaomiao had been studying for so many years, and had accumulated a lot of experience in introducing herself, and her words had gradually increased.\nStanding on the podium, she first smiled at the more than fifty students in the audience.\nShe was beautiful and had an infectious smile.\nThe corners of Wang Min\u2019s eyes twitched slightly. Sure enough, in the next second, she heard the set of words that she had heard when the second grade of junior high school started.\n\u201cHello everyone, my name is Su Miaomiao. My hobby is sleeping, so I hope that the students sitting around me can keep quiet during class breaks.\u201d\nClassmates:\u2026\u2026\n\u201cAlso, my academic performance is very good, but I don\u2019t like tutoring others, unless you can give delicious snacks or beautiful things to me.\u201d\nClassmates:\u2026\u2026\nEven the class teacher was stunned. After teaching for nearly thirty years, that was the first time he heard such a self-introduction. It was overbearing, but it didn\u2019t violate any school rules.\nAfter Su Miaomiao finished speaking, she walked off the podium, staring at Gu Jialing all the way, her eyes full of hints.\nGu Jialing thought to himself that his grades were also very good, and he didn\u2019t need the cat to help him.\nAfter the first quarter of evening self-study was over, the class suddenly became lively.\n\u201cWhere is your earring? Take it out and show it to me.\u201d\nBefore the class teacher walked out of the classroom, Su Miaomiao immediately turned to the back and said to Gu Jialing impatiently.\nGu Jialing\u2019s face was full of vigilance, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me taking a look?\u201d\nIt was really nothing to him. Gu Jialing himself also liked to show off, showing off his once perfect blue feathers, and all kinds of good blue things he collected.\nHowever, he deliberately stretched his arm far behind to ensure that Su Miaomiao would not be able to grab it.\nThe diameter of the sapphire inlaid in the middle of the diamond stud earring was about one centimeter, shining charmingly under the classroom lights.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t move her eyes.\nGu Jialing was too familiar with the light in her eyes, and put the earring in his pocket again.\nSu Miaomiao pouted, glanced at Xie Jingyuan, and asked, \u201cWhere did you buy this earring? And how much is it?\u201d\nIt couldn\u2019t be robbed or stolen. He must have bought it himself.\nGu Jialing sneered, glanced at the popular brand clothes on Su Miaomiao, and proudly said, \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, you may not be able to afford it, unless you ask your parents to help.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cHow much?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cWell, mine is not the most expensive one, I just like its color, it\u2019s only 80,000 yuan.\u201d\nXu Shou, who was listening silently: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe combined annual income of his grandparents and his odd jobs was less than 80,000 yuan. Gu Jialing actually spent 80,000 yuan to buy such a flashy earring.\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan quietly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for uncle and aunt to make money, so don\u2019t ask them for such gifts casually.\u201d\nIt was okay to give one now and then, but if she developed a luxurious style, Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei would suffer.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t intend to ask her parents for it. She was a sensible and good daughter, but the Taoist master could earn hundreds of thousands by writing a book. So giving her an earring shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, right?\nBefore Su Miaomiao could say anything, Feng Xiaoyu came, standing at the door of the classroom and called her happily.\nFeng Xiaoyu was in the second class downstairs, and she arrived there after climbing the stairs.\nSu Miaomiao had no choice but to go out to meet Feng Xiaoyu first.\nXie Jingyuan took the opportunity to learn about Gu Jialing\u2019s family.\nHis identity was a bit similar to Xu Shou\u2019s. Both his parents died when he was young. The difference lay in\u2014\u2014\nAlthough Gu Jialing was also born in a town close to the countryside, his hometown was rich in ores. Coincidentally, Gu Jialing\u2019s grandfather owned a mine.\nThe ten-minute break between classes was over quickly.\nSu Miaomiao returned to the classroom and glanced at Gu Jialing faintly. She lay listlessly on the desk, tilted her head, and looked at Xie Jingyuan who was silently preparing the Chinese textbook with a pair of beautiful big eyes.\nFrom Xu Shou\u2019s point of view, Su Miaomiao\u2019s pale face and shy eyes could also be seen.\nAlarm bells rang in Xu Shou\u2019s mind. Could it be that the cat demon wanted to seduce the Taoist master?\nWith the book in his hand, Xu Shou stretched out his long leg and kicked Su Miaomiao\u2019s leg.\nSu Miaomiao blinked and complained to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, he kicked me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan sensed it, so he turned his head and gave Xu Shou a warning look.\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAbout five minutes into the evening self-study in the second quarter, the class teacher appeared again.\nThe important content of that section was to select the members of the class committee.\nClass teacher: \u201cLet\u2019s choose the monitor first, does anyone want to be the monitor?\u201d\nThe classroom was quiet for a few seconds, and then someone started whispering.\nXu Shou raised his hand suddenly.\nThe class teacher smiled, \u201cDoes Xu Shou want to be the class monitor?\u201d\nXu Shou stood up, and said under the gaze of his classmates, \u201cI would like to recommend Xie Jingyuan to be the monitor.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t want to be the class monitor, and didn\u2019t want to assist the teachers in managing a class, but he understood what Xu Shou meant.\nIn Xu Shou\u2019s eyes, the monitor was probably the literal meaning of the leader of the class. Of course, he was only willing to listen to him. If someone else did it, Xu Shou may resist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "45": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-45/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, when the class teacher asked about his wishes, Xie Jingyuan calmly agreed.\nNo one objected, so he became the class monitor smoothly just like when the kindergarten started.\nAfter that, the deputy monitor, study committee members were also elected one after another.\nSu Miaomiao was not interested in those things at all, and listened casually.\nGu Jialing was a little interested in the art committee, but when he thought of the talent level of those ordinary people, he suppressed the urge to move.\nXu Shou took the initiative to recommend himself and was successfully elected as a disciplinary committee member.\nHe was tall, physically strong, and had a firm face, which was indeed very intimidating.\nLater, some other matters were dealt with, such as the class health duty schedule, and the self-study class was over.\nThe class teacher asked Xie Jingyuan and the sports committee to go ahead and explain about the opening ceremony.\nIt was getting dark outside the window, Su Miaomiao was lying on the table waiting for him.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing did not leave the classroom immediately either, the former was willing to wait while the later did not dare to act without authorization.\n\u201cYou\u2019re really stupid, why did you recommend the Taoist master?\u201d\nGu Jialing complained to Xu Shou in a low voice, \u201cThe Taoist master used to be the master of the temple, and all the incense money in the temple belonged to him. Is there any money paid for being the monitor? It\u2019s just a false title, and there are a lot of things to do every day.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThe Taoist master is not as secular as you.\u201d\nGu Jialing made a \u201chmph\u201d and asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cYou and the Taoist master have been together, has he ever been a monitor before?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, then nodded, \u201cFive or six times.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe Taoist master took the trouble to sacrifice his life for the people!\nThe classroom was almost empty, and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s job was finally over, and when he came back to pick up his school bag, he still carried one in each hand.\nXu Shou: \u201cI\u2019ll carry them for you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stared over vigilantly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cNo, you stay here, go back to the dormitory first. Is there any entry time limit in the dormitory?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThere\u2019s no rush, I\u2019ll take you to the school gate.\u201d\nCats had a cat\u2019s temper, and dogs also had a dog\u2019s temper, Xie Jingyuan could only acquiesce.\nThe four walked out of the classroom together, went down the stairs, and came to the bicycle parking lot on the ground floor.\nXie Jingyuan stuffed two school bags into the front basket, bent down to unlock the bicycle, and Su Miaomiao stood by and watched.\nXu Shou looked around and frowned for the first time that day, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a car?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cTaoist Master has it.\u201d\nXu Shou pursed his lips tightly.\nThinking that Xie Jingyuan had saved his life after all, Gu Jialing took the initiative, \u201cWhich neighborhood do you live in? I\u2019ll let the driver pick you up in the future, let\u2019s go together.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cNo, we live very close.\u201d\nGu Jialing no longer insisted.\nBecause Xu Shou wanted to take them to the school gate, and Gu Jialing\u2019s driver was waiting outside the school, Xie Jingyuan decided to push the bike and walk over.\nSu Miaomiao was too lazy to walk, so she jumped to the back seat, took out a small packet of crispy shrimp snacks from her pocket, and tore it open.\nXu Shou was about to propose to push the bike for the Taoist master. But seeing her like that, he quickly swallowed his words, and only stared at the lazy cat with cold eyes.\nSu Miaomiao deliberately handed him a piece, \u201cDo you want to eat?\u201d\nXu Shou looked away.\nSu Miaomiao smiled, eating with gusto, but her eyes fell on the hole in Gu Jialing\u2019s right ear, and she got in a bad mood again.\nGu Jialing vigilantly went around to Xu Shou\u2019s other side.\nAlthough the dog was cold, at least he was more stable than the cat.\nSoon they reached the school gate.\nAfter Gu Jialing failed to invite the Taoist master again, he was about to go to the car waiting for him, but Xie Jingyuan stopped him, \u201cDon\u2019t forget your hair.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan told Xu Shou to go back, and drove\u00a0 the bike.\nXie Jingyuan concentrated on watching the road. Su Miaomiao tilted her head, and saw Xu Shou standing alone under the streetlight at the school gate. His face gradually blurred, and his shadow gradually overlapped with Qingxu Temple\u2019s big black dog.\nSu Miaomiao looked back silently.\nThere was a crossroad ahead, and it happened to turn into a red light. Xie Jingyuan stopped and turned his head as if feeling something, and saw the tall and straight figure of Xu Shou standing there.\nHe remained motionless, just like in his previous life.\nXie Jingyuan was slightly moved.\nSpeaking of which, among the three demons, the dog had lived in Qingxu the longest.\nNot all demons were inherently evil and vicious. The dog was a kind-hearted demon who was born in a small village and had been guarding that village since he opened his spiritual wisdom. He had saved many local villagers.\nFor demons who wanted to improve their cultivation base, beside steadfast cultivation, there were many insidious shortcuts, such as picking up men and women, and devouring other demons\u2019 pills.\nThe dog was being followed by a big demon, and at a critical moment, Xie Jingyuan rushed over looking for the evil spirit, and rescued the dog.\nSince then, the dog had devoted allegiance to him.\nXie Jingyuan took care of the cat, freed the bird, and raised the dog for many years, just like family members.\nNo one could bear to abandon a dog at home who was willing to protect the owner with his life.\nWhen the green light turned on, Xie Jingyuan turned around and rode back.\nSu Miaomiao was stunned for a second, then pursed her lips.\nIn the past, when Xie Jingyuan went out to catch demons, the big black dog would always follow him far away, Xie Jingyuan would pat the dog\u2019s head, and the big black dog would return to Qingxu Temple.\nThe Taoist master must be going to pat the dog\u2019s head again.\nSeeing Xie Jingyuan turning back, Xu Shou\u2019s eyes lit up and he ran forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My cousin said that you have earned at least hundreds of thousands.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan almost forgot that she also had a cousin who could help her settle accounts, although that cousin\u2019s estimate was not accurate.\nThat was why he didn\u2019t want to tell Su Miaomiao how much he earned.\nIf Su Miaomiao thought he had ten yuan, she would only ask for gifts worth nine yuan at most, but if they were exchanged for hundreds of thousands or millions, the price of the gifts she asked for would also increase accordingly.\nXie Jingyuan made a rule for her, \u201cDuring school, you can ask for gifts over one thousand yuan only once a year.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked and asked, \u201cDoes birthday present count?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was silent for a few seconds, and said, \u201cThat is given separately, it doesn\u2019t count this time.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was relieved, \u201cThen for this year\u2019s gift, I want that kind of earrings.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take you to buy it during the holidays.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was very happy, happily hugging Xie Jingyuan and rubbing against him.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s back stiffened, but fortunately she finished rubbing quickly, and began to chat about other things, \u201cWhy is Gu Jialing so rich?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cHis family has a mine.\u201d\nOn the way, he told her about Gu Jialing\u2019s family\u2019s situation.\nSu Miaomiao felt that Gu Jialing was lucky to be born into a super wealthy family, but also unlucky to have no parents.\nIf they were allowed to choose which family to reincarnate into, Su Miaomiao would still choose the Su family.\nShe liked her parents and Grandma Tao the most.\nBack home, Su Miaomiao received a warm welcome from her parents. Su Mingan also prepared supper for her daughter and invited Xie Jingyuan to eat with her.\nStanding at the door, Xie Jingyuan could smell the fried fish wafting from the kitchen.\n\u201cNo, I have to do my homework.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan bid farewell to the couple and entered his house.\nGrandma Tao just came out of the bathroom. When she saw her grandson, she smiled and asked about the evening self-study.\nXie Jingyuan chatted briefly.\nGrandma Tao: \u201cI warmed tofu and fried dough sticks for you, do you want to eat?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was in the stage of growing up, he was indeed a little hungry, so he asked Grandma Tao to sit, and went to the kitchen to get supper.\nThe grandmother and grandson sat at the dining table facing each other. Xie Jingyuan looked at Grandma Tao\u2019s kind face and mentioned Xu Shou, \u201cGrandma, Xu Shou has a withdrawn personality and doesn\u2019t get along with his roommates in the dormitory. I want him to move in and live with us.\u201d\nGrandma Tao looked at her grandson unexpectedly.\nIn the past, acquaintances in the warm community praised her grandson for being helpful, but Grandma Tao knew that her grandson was kind-hearted but cold-tempered, and he was also a lonely kind. Among the children of the same age, her grandson only had one real friend, Miaomiao. Her grandson had never taken the initiative to mention Lin Xi and Feng Xiaoyu to her. He only just met Xu Shou at the high school, and had such a good relationship with him.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if there is one more person living with us. Do you trust him?\u201d Grandma Tao asked simply.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYes,\u201d\nGrandma Tao smiled, her grandson was not an ordinary high school student, she believed in his judgment.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled. I\u2019ll pack up your father\u2019s things tomorrow and ask him to send someone to fetch them. You can bring Xu Shou over tomorrow.\u201d\nXie Rong was Grandma Tao\u2019s only son, and Grandma Tao did care about him.\nHowever, since Xie Rong got married for the second time and abandoned them to start a new family, Grandma Tao\u2019s affection had also cooled down.\nThe initial freshness of the marriage passed, and the son started to be annoyed by Qiao Lili. Only then did he think of staying with them more often.\nThe so-called many meant two or three nights a month. After all, Xie Rong was too busy. He was in one city one day, and he might go to another place the next day.\nGrandma Tao really didn\u2019t miss such a child.\nInstead of leaving that secondary bedroom empty most of the time, she could give it to her grandson\u2019s new best friend.\nThe next day, Grandma Tao called Xie Rong.\nXie Rong was skeptical about the arrangement, \u201cHow can the classmate he just met be said to be reliable?\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cHow long did you know Lili before you got married?\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe freshly washed school uniform exuded the smell of sunshine. Because the weather was still a little hot, Su Miaomiao wore the short-sleeved one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Her silly child hadn\u2019t experienced the hard work of military training yet.\nEarly self-study started at 7:20 in the morning, and at 6:50, Su Miaomiao jumped onto the back seat of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bicycle.\nAt that time, the community was still very quiet. Some office workers had to catch a bus or a taxi, and they were in a hurry, not as calm as high school students.\nThe breeze blew Xie Jingyuan\u2019s school uniform back, and Su Miaomiao kept poking his school uniform.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan unzipped the zipper with one hand, the loose school uniform immediately flew back with the wind, almost completely covering Su Miaomiao\u2019s upper body.\nRiding on the wide main road leading to No. 1 High School, more students appeared. Everyone wore the same school uniform and rushed toward the same destination.\nSu Miaomiao grabbed Xie Jingyuan\u2019s clothes with one hand, supported the seat with the other, and casually looked at the students.\nEveryone was maintaining a constant speed. Suddenly, three bicycles accelerated and chased up from behind.\nThey attracted Su Miaomiao\u2019s attention, she tilted her head and looked over.\nThe three boys on the bicycles were all wearing short-sleeved sportswear, showing their slender and muscular arms and calves. The boy riding in the front had a short haircut, slightly dark complexion, rather handsome, with an arrogant and unruly vibe.\nSeeing that Su Miaomiao had noticed him, the boy smiled and whistled, and rode faster until the front of his bike remained side by side with her.\nThe three boys were all excellent sports students in the No. 1 High School. They were sophomores that year. The whistler was the boss of the three-person team, Song Yang.\n\u201cLittle beauty, are you a freshman in high school?\u201d Song Yang struck up a conversation with Su Miaomiao with a sunny smile, as if Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t exist.\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nSong Yang: \u201cI\u2019m Song Yang, a sophomore in high school. What\u2019s your name and what class are you in?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t speak, just looked at that person quietly.\nSong Yang thought that the little beauty was scared. After all, she was so good-looking, she might have never been in contact with \u201cbad students\u201d like them.\n\u201cIs he your boyfriend, or your brother?\u201d Song Yang glanced at Xie Jingyuan, who had a nerdy aura, and asked.\nIn fact, Su Miaomiao could ignore that question, but the Taoist master certainly did not want others to misunderstand, so Su Miaomiao replied, \u201cBrother.\u201d\nSong Yang already wanted to pursue Su Miaomiao, so of course he couldn\u2019t offend the little beauty\u2019s brother. He rode a little forward and chatted with Xie Jingyuan side by side, \u201cBrother, what class are you in?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s calm demeanor was not like that of a freshman. If she was a sophomore in high school, Song Yang would have had an impression of her face, and guessed that Xie Jingyuan was the sophomore.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xie Jingyuan glanced at Song Yang coldly.\nThis attitude was more like a brother-in-law!\nSong Yang rubbed his nose and said with a dry smile, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I just want to get to know you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\nSong Yang\u2019s two companions let out gleeful laughter, no matter how rough Song Yang was, he couldn\u2019t be mean to the beauty\u2019s brother.\nSong Yang also knew that continuing to pester Xie Jingyuan would be fruitless, so he turned his head, winked at Su Miaomiao, and rode forward with a smile.\nThe three vigorous sports students soon took a long lead.\nXie Jingyuan then asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cDo you want to know them?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nShe was not interested in strangers, unless the other party could come up with something good that made her heart beat.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t ask any more, anyway, they were in the same class and at the same desk, if there was a boy who clearly expressed his intention to pursue Su Miaomiao, he would give her common knowledge of the school rules prohibiting puppy love.\nWhen they arrived at the school gate, Xie Jingyuan saw Xu Shou standing there waiting from afar.\nXie Jingyuan stepped on the ground with one foot.\nSu Miaomiao continued to sit steadily.\n\u201cHave you had breakfast?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked Xu Shou while pushing the bicycle.\nXu Shou: \u201cI ate.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWell, you go home with me tonight. You ask the class teacher during the day if you can get the accommodation fee back.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cOkay.\u201d\nXu Shou finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, and looked at Su Miaomiao coldly,\u201dCan\u2019t you walk by yourself?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cMaster doesn\u2019t mind, why do you care?\u201d\nXu Shou looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cGrandma treats her like her own granddaughter, and you will have to treat her like a younger sister in the future.\u201d\nXu Shou wanted to say that the cat was not worthy, but Su Miaomiao snorted first, \u201cI don\u2019t want him to be my brother.\u201d\nSeeing that the cat and the dog were about to quarrel again, someone behind him suddenly shouted happily, \u201cMiaomiao!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao turned her head and saw Cheng Yue chasing after her with her school bag on her back.\nSu Miaomiao just jumped out of the back seat of the bike.\nCheng Yue held Su Miaomiao\u2019s arm, and said while panting, \u201cI\u2019m in Class 23, on the fourth floor of the North Building, so far away from you, fortunately, Yaoyao is with me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao already knew, Feng Xiaoyu told her that Lin Xi was in class 10, next door to class 9.\n\u201cHey, who is this classmate?\u201d\nCheng Yue gasped enough and finally noticed Xu Shou.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to introduce him.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cHis name is Xu Shou, he is my friend.\u201d\nCheng Yue\u2019s eyes widened.\nThey had known Xie Jingyuan for so long, but they had never heard him voluntarily admitting that they were friends. Why was this Xu Shou so special?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Anyway, Taoist master treats him better than me.\u201d\nCheng Yue subconsciously blurted out, \u201cImpossible!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t explain more, \u201cYou will know later.\u201d\nCheng Yue secretly observed Xu Shou and Xie Jingyuan.\nIt took seven or eight minutes to walk from the school gate to the teaching building, but during those seven or eight minutes, the two boys hardly said a word, and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s attitude toward Xu Shou was similar to his attitude toward them.\nAfter parking the bicycle, Xie Jingyuan still took the initiative to carry Su Miaomiao\u2019s bag, as if it was what he was supposed to do.\nCheng Yue confirmed her guess. Su Miaomiao was talking nonsense. How could Xie Jingyuan treat someone better than Su Miaomiao?!\n\u201cBye, let\u2019s meet in the cafeteria at noon!\u201d\nOn the second floor, Cheng Yue continued to climb up, and waved at Su Miaomiao reluctantly.\nThe other three also entered the classroom.\nGu Jialing hadn\u2019t come yet.\nUntil the second before the morning self-study bell rang, Gu Jialing pushed open the classroom door punctually. Su Miaomiao looked at the top of his head, as the strand of blue hair had disappeared.\n\u201cWhy are you all so early?\u201d\nGu Jialing put down his school bag, sat down and asked Xu Shou.\nXu Shou\u2019s attitude was cold, \u201cNo chatting between classes allowed.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhy didn\u2019t he know that the big black dog was so disciplined?!\nThe undisciplined Su Miaomiao turned her head and asked him, \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me where you bought the earring.\u201d\nThey had the money, but they didn\u2019t have the address.\nGu Jialing questioned, \u201cDo you have money? You are not allowed to steal.\u201d\nThe cat was the least disciplined about stealing among the three demons in Qingxu Temple. She even stole the hairpin of a female pilgrim, so he had to guard against her.\nSu Miaomiao glared at him, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who steals, the Taoist master promised to buy it for me during the holiday.\u201d\nXu Shou\u2019s pupils shrank.\n80,000 yuan for earrings, the Taoist master actually wanted to spend so much on the cat?\nGu Jialing\u2019s bird heart was also greatly shocked, not only by the Taoist master\u2019s financial resources, but also by his generosity to the cat.\n\u201cTaoist Master, is your family rich?\u201d\nGu Jialing, who claimed to be the most wealthy, never thought about knowing the situation of other people\u2019s families. Seeing the Taoist master riding a bicycle to school, he didn\u2019t look like a rich person.\nSu Miaomiao recalled the bird\u2019s showing off, and couldn\u2019t help showing off, \u201cUncle Xie has opened a big company!\u201d\nGu Jialing asked, \u201cHow old is he?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was about to answer when Xie Jingyuan\u2019s gaze swept over.\nThe three demons lowered their heads to read.\nThe morning self-study was over, there was music from the playground, and the first-year high school freshmen were going to the playground to participate in the opening ceremony.\nThe sports committee instructed the students to move the benches to the corridor to gather, and then lined up to go to the playground together.\nAt that time, the girls were going to be at the front, so Su Miaomiao had to separate from the three boys and moved the bench to the girls\u2019 line alone.\nHer height was above average for girls.\nSu Miaomiao stood in the queue, glanced at the female students in front of her in turn, and finally walked toward a girl wearing a pink bow tie.\n\u201cCan I stand next to you?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked.\nThe girl blushed inexplicably, was a little excited, and said while stepping inside, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao went in.\nThe girl was secretly nervous for a while, seeing that Su Miaomiao had no intention of talking, she calmed down slowly, and then secretly observed her.\nHow could there be such a beautiful girl?\nSu Miaomiao noticed her gaze and looked over suspiciously.\nThe girl became nervous again, and stammered, \u201cHello, my name is Yu Le, you can also call me Lele.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cMy name is Su Miaomiao, you can call me Miaomiao.\u201d\nYu Le said pleasantly, \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d\nBecause Su Miaomiao looked like the kind of girl who was very proud and arrogant.\nSu Miaomiao pointed to Yu Le\u2019s bow tie, \u201cI also have the same bow.\u201d\nYu Le suddenly remembered that Su Miaomiao had said in her self-introduction that she liked pretty things.\n\u201cI still have a lot of bows, do you like it? I can give you one.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOkay, then I can explain anything to you.\u201d\nYu Le: \u201cNo, no, I just want to give it to you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao laughed. Yu Le became more pleasing to her eyes.\nXie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing stood at the back of the line, but they kept looking past the moving boys in front, paying attention to Su Miaomiao all the time.\nXie Jingyuan was relieved to find that Su Miaomiao chatted with the female classmate next to her and there was no quarrel.\nThe dog had nearly two hundred years of experience in guarding the villagers. The bird was lonely and had a peaceful temperament. He didn\u2019t have to worry too much about studying at school, only the cat was not very close to people.\n\u201cTaoist Master, are you looking at Su Miaomiao?\u201d Gu Jialing suddenly turned over and followed his gaze to look forward.\nXie Jingyuan pursed his lips.\nGu Jialing asked in a low voice, \u201cYou really want to give her that kind of earrings? It\u2019s 80,000 yuan, why spend it on her?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cShe is a cat of Qingxu.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s heart moved, and he said flatteringly, \u201cTaoist Master, in fact, I also fell in love with a sapphire ring worth 70,000 yuan. It\u2019s in the same store. Master will buy it for me too, right?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan smiled, just when Gu Jialing thought he really agreed, he said lightly, \u201cYour situation is different from hers, you have a mine at home.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Looking only from the back, it would make people think that this classmate was playing with her phone.\nThere were indeed some students in each class who would play with their phones, and then hide them in time when the teachers approached.\nThe class teacher of Class 9 held his hands behind his back and slowly patrolled from behind.\nAs if with a kind of magical power, wherever the class teacher passed by, all the students who were listless and hunched over became full of energy with their heads held high.\nYu Le quietly tugged on Su Miaomiao\u2019s sleeve.\nSu Miaomiao woke up, yawning from sleepiness.\nThe teacher in charge gave her a silent look.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him as if nothing had happened. She was not afraid of the teacher, nor did she feel embarrassed.\nThe teacher in charge quickly walked forward again.\nYu Le admired Su Miaomiao, \u201cYou are so courageous, I was so nervous.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought that the girl was really timid. The class teacher didn\u2019t eat people, the evil demons in the deep mountains and old forests were the real fear.\nAfter the ceremony, the students lined up and returned to the classroom.\nIt was time to go to lunch. The students in Class 9 crowded out frantically. Everyone wanted to go to the cafeteria earlier to avoid queuing.\nIt was impossible for Xie Jingyuan to be in a hurry to eat, he patiently waited for other students to go out first, and then waited for this wave of people to squeeze out. The classroom of Class 9 was almost empty, then Xie Jingyuan walked out calmly.\nSu Miaomiao, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing also followed his rhythm calmly.\nThere was a long way to go, and there would never be any food if they didn\u2019t reach in time.\n\u201cMiaomiao!\u201d\nCheng Yue and Zhou Yao finally squeezed down from the fourth floor. They came to Class 9 without hope and found that Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan were still there, so they were very happy.\n\u201cIs he your new friend too?\u201d Cheng Yue was shocked by Gu Jialing\u2019s face, Xu Shou was already handsome enough, handsome with awe-inspiring righteousness, but Gu Jialing\u2019s handsomeness was alluring and seductive.\nSeeing how much the two girls admired him, Gu Jialing smiled.\nSu Miaomiao and Xu Shou looked down on him a bit.\nAlthough Su Miaomiao had always thought that she was the most beautiful cat, she had never thought about showing off. It was good to know some things in one heart, but there was no need to talk about it every day.\nAs for the bird, he couldn\u2019t wait for everyone in the world to praise his beauty. Every morning, he flew to the old locust tree outside the gate of Qingxu Temple. His flapping wings showed off his sea-blue feathers. If someone praised him for his beauty, the bird would fly to his shoulder, which was incomparably beautiful.\nAnd the moment Gu Jialing smiled, Cheng Yue swung Xie Jingyuan\u2019s figure out of her mind without hesitation, and replaced it with Gu Jialing.\nShe liked Xie Jingyuan before, wasn\u2019t it because he was handsome?\nBut Xie Jingyuan was too cold, and only had Su Miaomiao in his eyes, so why would Cheng Yue still like him? This new handsome guy was obviously better, his smile was so charming.\nCheng Yue enthusiastically chatted with Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing had always been at the bottom of the four-person group of Qingxu Temple. The Taoist master didn\u2019t like to talk to people, the big black dog didn\u2019t listen to people, and the cat always had ulterior motives. Those simple and straightforward human girls were cuter.\nWhen they got downstairs, Feng Xiaoyu and Lin Xi stood together, waiting for them.\nThe original kindergarten group of six became eight people.\nAmong the four girls, all three of them surrounded Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing was not only handsome, cheerful and talkative, but also had a super nice voice.\nWhich girl could refuse such a handsome guy?\nXie Jingyuan walked behind, staring at Gu Jialing\u2019s side face that appeared from time to time, his brows gradually furrowed.\nThe bird in the previous life was frightened by the demons outside, and did not dare to leave the protection range of Qingxu Temple without authorization. In Qingxu Temple, he had always maintained the form of a bird. Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t find anything bad about him.\nBut he felt that Gu Jialing was very likely to develop into a flirt and playboy.\nThe relationship between men and women in the world was not as conservative as in the previous life. If there were girls who were willing to have that kind of relationship with Gu Jialing, would he take the opportunity?\nDifferent worlds had different degrees of aura intensity, but the yin and yang essence of men and women were innate, and there was not much difference.\nFor those three demons, Xie Jingyuan was completely at ease with Xu Shou.\nFor those two who he was not at ease with, the most worry-free way at present was to keep them by his side and supervise them at any time.\nJust a few minutes away from the teaching building to the cafeteria, Xie Jingyuan made a decision, \u201cCome on, I invite you to eat in the cafeteria on the second floor.\u201d\nAt this time, Gu Jialing showed another advantage of him, his family had a mine, and he was very rich.\nFeng Xiaoyu and Cheng Yue would follow.\nZhou Yao said that she wanted to eat on the first floor.\nLin Xi was not short of money, but he was not used to such an atmosphere, so he smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m going with Zhou Yao.\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, he glanced at Su Miaomiao secretly, and left with Zhou Yao first.\nBecause of his glance, Xie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao and Xu Shou to the second floor.\nThere was a row of windows in the small restaurant on the second floor, where one could serve themselves, or they could order and prepare meals, such as common stir-fried dishes, ramen, spicy soup, dumplings, etc., were available there.\nThe three were standing by the side.\nIt was Xu Shou\u2019s first visit to the second floor, and he went to a few self-service windows. The dishes there were indeed better, but the prices were much more expensive.\nHe was born in the countryside, with limited living expenses, and he didn\u2019t have the flexible thinking of Xie Jingyuan, who wrote novels frequently.\nOf course, everyone thought differently. If Xu Shou was asked to write, he may not be able to write. Su Miaomiao was a typical example.\n\u201cEat whatever you want. Before you work, I will be responsible for your living expenses in the future,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said in a timely manner.\nXu Shou thought for a while, and said with firm eyes, \u201cWhen I start working, half of my salary will be given to my grandparents, and half to you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

During those seven years, Xie Jingyuan would try his best to help them truly integrate into the world.\nWhen they were talking, Su Miaomiao was still comparing the dishes in several windows, and then picked a window with braised fish from the queue.\nXie Jingyuan came behind her, and Xu Shou was behind him.\nSu Miaomiao ordered a dish of braised fish, a pair of chicken wings in honey sauce, and a dish of beef brisket with tomato.\nWhen it was time to swipe the card, Su Miaomiao suddenly remembered something, turned to Xie Jingyuan and said, \u201cTaoist Master, I forgot my campus card in my schoolbag.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan directly swiped the card for her.\nXu Shou glanced at her quietly.\nSu Miaomiao was used to it, so she went to find a seat first.\nXie Jingyuan ordered three vegetarian dishes.\nXu Shou wanted him to order for him.\u00a0\nXie Jingyuan knew that Xu Shou also ate some pheasants and hares before going to Qingxu Temple, so he ordered two meat dishes for Xu Shou.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIn terms of eating, I hope you follow your nature.\u201d\nXu Shou remembered.\nWhen the two of them sat next to Su Miaomiao with their plates, she glanced at Xu Shou\u2019s dishes, and said sarcastically, \u201cWhy did you break the precept?\u201d\nDuring her stay in Qingxu, she would catch fish and birds nearby to eat, while the big black dog followed the Taoist master to eat vegetarian food.\nXu Shou ignored her, picked up a piece of chicken wing, looked at Su Miaomiao, bit his lip, and snapped the bone of the chicken wing.\nSu Miaomiao: \u2026\nThe three including Gu Jialing ate Mala Tang, and Su Miaomiao finished eating a fish when they came late.\nWhen Gu Jialing looked at their dinner plates, Su Miaomiao also looked at Gu Jialing\u2019s Mala Tang bowl, there was everything from spinach and tomato to meatballs and duck blood.\n\u201cTaoist Master, do you have such a vegetarian diet?\u201d Looking at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s dishes, Gu Jialing asked.\nThe Taoist master still abided by the clear rules and precepts of Qingxu Temple, which meant, would the Taoist master continue to discipline them strictly?\n\u201cHey, why are you also calling him Taoist Master?\u201d Cheng Yue asked curiously.\nGu Jialing turned his head quickly, pointed at Su Miaomiao and said, \u201cI learned it all from her.\u201d\nCheng Yue and Feng Xiaoyu understood.\n\u2014-\nBack in the teaching building, Feng Xiaoyu and Cheng Yue returned to their classes.\nXie Jingyuan asked Xu Shou and Su Miaomiao to go back to the classroom first, and he took Gu Jialing to the remote corner suitable for talking.\nGu Jialing became nervous.\nXie Jingyuan turned around and said to him, \u201cStarting tonight, Xu Shou will move into my house. We still have a vacant room, do you want to come?\u201d\nThe new house had a four-bedroom layout, with three bedrooms and a study room, which could be converted into a bedroom.\nAfter listening to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s introduction, Gu Jialing said tactfully, \u201cIs the study room too small? Our house in the town is also a villa\u2026\u201d\nThe implication was that he was used to living in a big house and couldn\u2019t stand a small one.\nXie Jingyuan looked at him, \u201cSo, you don\u2019t want to live with us?\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s heart trembled, and he hurriedly said, \u201cNo, actually, I miss you very much too\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u2026\nWhy did he have to be hypocritical? Why didn\u2019t he dare to refuse with confidence?\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou can move over tomorrow night, remember to call your grandpa to clarify.\u201d\nGu Jialing suddenly had hope, and said, \u201cHow should I explain this to the old man? He\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cJust say that you want to study with the top two in the class and improve your grades.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u2026\nAfter so many years, Gu Jialing had never studied hard. Fortunately, he was smart. The old man looked forward to him being a scholar. Gu Jialing only read books from time to time, and had always maintained a leading grade in the town\u2019s primary and junior high schools. That made the old man very proud and he gave out pocket money very generously.\nBut in No. 1 High School and Class No. 9, Gu Jialing was suddenly reduced to the ninth from the bottom.\n\u201cIf the old man doesn\u2019t believe it, I can call him!\u201d Looking at Gu Jialing who fell into silence, Xie Jingyuan said empathetically.\nGu Jialing quickly shook his head, \u201cBelieve me, he will believe everything I say.\u201d\nWhat a joke, if he really let the old man know that there were people like Xie Jingyuan in the world, he would hand over his pocket money to Xie Jingyuan for safekeeping.\nXie Jingyuan nodded.\nWhen the two returned to the classroom, Su Miaomiao and Xu Shou found that Gu Jialing seemed to have lost his soul and turned into a listless bird with dull eyes.\nIn the afternoon, there was a military training theory class, and all freshmen in high school went to the gymnasium to attend classes.\nThe second day of school went by like that.\nAfter the evening self-study, Su Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan to Xu Shou\u2019s dormitory\nIt was dark, and there was light in each dormitory, and the street lamps next to them casted long shadows of the two on the ground.\nSu Miaomiao was sleepy again, approached Xie Jingyuan, and put her head on his shoulder.\nXie Jingyuan avoided her, and said in a low voice, \u201cHuman women don\u2019t casually have physical contact with men.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at him, paused, and suddenly closed her eyes. Her fair face gradually turned red, and it became more red by time.\nXie Jingyuan was startled, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t answer. After a full minute, she let out a long breath and said disappointedly, \u201cI want to see if I can turn back into a cat. If I become a cat, you can hug me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting him all day.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cIs the room tidy? Do you want us to help?\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s over. You are tired from working during the day. Go and rest.\u201d\nThe three members of the Su family went back.\nGrandma Tao went to the kitchen to check the supper she prepared for the two children, then went to stand on the balcony for a while, strolling around, and the door opened.\nGrandma Tao walked toward the porch with a smile, she was a little excited despite her age.\n\u201cGrandma, this is Xu Shou,\u201d Xie Jingyuan came in first, and introduced him to the old lady while changing shoes.\nGrandma Tao was first startled by Xu Shou\u2019s strong physique, and then she turned her attention to the boy\u2019s face.\nXu Shou looked handsome and upright, bad guys would feel threatened when they saw him, and kind-hearted people would think Xu Shou was very reliable.\nGrandma Tao fell in love with the high school student immediately.\n\u201cGrandma, I have caused you trouble,\u201d Xu Shou was very respectful to the Taoist master\u2019s close relative.\nGrandma Tao smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome. Go wash your hands, and we will eat supper when you come out.\u201d\nShe went to the kitchen to fetch things. Xie Jingyuan took Xu Shou to the bedroom to put the suitcase first, and then went to wash his hands.\nAt the dinner table, Grandma Tao warmly entertained Xu Shou, and at the same time got a better understanding of the situation of the Xu family.\nGrandma Tao liked the kind of strong, independent, diligent and studious child.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Grandma Tao and said, \u201cGrandma, I want to invite another classmate to move here, this will be the last time.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSince one was already accepted, the other one was just a matter of adding extra chopsticks.\n\u201cOkay, tomorrow I will tidy up the study.\u201d\n\u201cGo to bed early, Xu Shou and I will pack up tonight.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan wanted to take care of the demons that came out of his temple, but he wouldn\u2019t want to cause too much trouble for Grandma Tao. From then on, he decided that the three of them would be responsible for things like cleaning, washing clothes, and throwing out trash.\nGrandma Tao quickly saw the mobility of the two first-year boys, especially Xu Shou. He moved such a big bookcase to the living room by himself.\nThe study room was fifteen square meters, and it was enough to convert it into a bedroom.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI have already bought the bed, wardrobe, and desk, and they will be delivered tomorrow, and the store will be responsible for the installation.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be at home and wait for them to come.\u201d\nThe grandson considered everything carefully, so Grandma Tao was very relieved. She didn\u2019t want Xu Shou to be too restrained, so she went back to her room and went to bed first.\nAfter Gu Jialing\u2019s room was tidied up, Xie Jingyuan took Xu Shou to his room.\nThat room used to belong to Xie Rong, and the desk and wardrobe were well equipped. Xie Jingyuan also left the new notebook that Xie Rong gave him to Xu Shou.\n\u201cWill this work?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked.\nXu Shou didn\u2019t know much. He didn\u2019t have a computer at home. He only used that old desktop computer in the computer room of his junior high school and learned some basic operations.\nXie Jingyuan sat down and taught him.\nXu Shou was very smart, and he could pick it up fast.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the time. It was almost half past ten, and there was military training the next day, so he asked Xu Shou to go to bed early.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan left, Xu Shou closed the gift he had just received.\nSome high school students would be addicted to video games, but Xu Shou would never.\nAfter taking a shower, he turned off the lights and lay down on the bed.\nThe surroundings were pitch black, without any dangerous factors, so Xu Shou quickly fell asleep.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pretend to see Miaomiao out later, and take a look at what that student Xu Shou looks like.\u201d\nIn apartment number 1001, during breakfast, Su Mingan planned in a low voice.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cYou are really bored.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded in agreement.\nAs a result, when Su Miaomiao picked up her schoolbag and was about to go out, she saw her mother walking over with her father.\nTang Shiwei smiled, \u201cI prepared sunscreen for Jing Yuan, so I will just give it to him.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao just believed it.\nIn the corridor, Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou had been standing there waiting for a few minutes.\nThe door of apartment 1001 opened, and the two looked over at the same time.\n\u201cUncle, aunt,\u201d Xie Jingyuan greeted Su Mingan and his wife.\nSu Mingan sighed, his eyes shifted to Xu Shou, and he was stunned.\nEven if he could forget Xu Shou\u2019s face, he couldn\u2019t forget the boy\u2019s strong physique, and the strange movement of the boy sniffing him.\nTang Shiwei looked at Xu Shou from head to toe several times in surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Just apply this to your face, neck, and arms later.\u201d\nTang Shiwei took out two sunscreens and handed them to the boys respectively.\nXie Jingyuan hesitated for a few seconds and accepted it.\nXu Shou had no choice but to follow suit.\nThe elevator carried the three high school students down, and Tang Shiwei said with emotion, \u201cI\u2019m a little envious of Miaomiao. She is surrounded by handsome guys at school.\u201d\nSu Mingan was thinking about other things, and thought deeply, \u201cThis Xu Shou is weird, I\u2019m worried that he moved here for some purpose.\u201d\nHe told his wife about the day.\n\u201cAlso, just now, Xu Shou looked at Miaomiao strangely, as if he didn\u2019t like her.\u201d\nTang Shiwei felt that his thinking was too complicated, but it made sense after careful consideration.\n\u201cJing Yuan is by Miaomiao\u2019s side during the day, and we are with her at night. It should be fine.\u201d\nSu Mingan nodded.\nDownstairs where Xie Jingyuan usually kept his bicycle, there was an extra bicycle. Xie Jingyuan asked Grandma Tao to buy it for Xu Shou.\nSu Miaomiao jumped onto Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back seat, and the three of them set off immediately.\nXie Jingyuan was on the left, and Xu Shou was on the right, so the cat didn\u2019t need to look at the dog, and the dog didn\u2019t need to look at the cat, so as not to look at each other with disgust.\nWhen he came to a crossroad, Xie Jingyuan stopped the bike, glanced casually, and saw the three sports talents they met the previous morning riding over from another road.\n\u201cHey, bro!\u201d Song Yang warmly greeted Xie Jingyuan.\nXu Shou looked at him, and asked strangely, \u201cTaoist Master, are they your friends?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cI don\u2019t know them.\u201d\nWhen the green light turned on, Xie Jingyuan crossed the road directly without waiting for Song Yang and the others.\nBut Song Yang and the others quickly caught up.\nSong Yang glanced at Su Miaomiao first.\nSu Miaomiao was wearing the camouflage uniform required for military training. She had fair skin and looked good in that kind of clothing, a little more pure than usual.\nIt was a pity that the little beauty didn\u2019t like to talk, and her eyes were indifferent, as if she still didn\u2019t understand what he meant.\nSong Yang smiled, and changed to befriend Xie Jingyuan, \u201cBrother, you see we met again, this is fate, let\u2019s be friends?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan still said the same thing, \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\nSong Yang: \u201cBrother you are a top student, so do you look down on sports students like us?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan stopped talking.\nXu Shou had already seen that the Taoist master didn\u2019t like those three people.\nThose three people were also very stupid, how could they easily cling to the Taoist master?\nXu Shou deliberately slowed down, got behind the Taoist master\u2019s bike, and then went to catch up with Song Yang, then said in a cold tone, \u201cStay away from us.\u201d\nSong Yang glanced at Xu Shou and smiled.\nHe was not only a special student, but also a famous school bully in the second grade of high school. No one in the same grade dared to provoke him.\nXu Shou\u2019s powerful body was indeed a bit bluffing, but he was one, and they were three.\n\u201cWhat? Do you want to fight?\u201d Song Yang looked at Xu Shou provocatively.\nXu Shou saw that the Taoist master was just riding his bicycle forward as if nothing had happened, understood his thoughts, and replied, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to leave, let\u2019s fight.\u201d\nSong Yang and the three immediately threw their bicycles to the side of the road and rushed toward Xu Shou together.\nSu Miaomiao tilted her head and looked back. She saw Xu Shou knocking Song Yang and the others to the ground. Then he said something, so they got on their bicycles and ran away.\nSu Miaomiao expressed sympathy for the three.\nIt was not good to provoke the big black dog, or they had to fight against him.\nAfter watching the play, Su Miaomiao suddenly remembered and pulled Xie Jingyuan\u2019s clothes, \u201cTaoist Master, why don\u2019t you care about Xu Shou fighting with others?\u201d\nIn the past, when she fought with her classmates, Xie Jingyuan would always scold her.\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cFirst of all, they provoked Xu Shou first. Second, Xu Shou knew when to stop.\u201d\nWhen the cat was angry, she didn\u2019t care whether she would seriously injure the children, she just gnashed her teeth.\nIn the middle of the road, in a luxury car deliberately slowing down, Gu Jialing saw all of it.\nHe was secretly startled.\nThe spiritual energy in the world was thin. He still thought that the Taoist master would not be able to cultivate. If Taoist master really wanted to force him to do something, he might be able to resist.\nBut Xu Shou, why was he still fighting so bad?\nGu Jialing stared at Xu Shou\u2019s arms, then pinched his own, and became very sure that he couldn\u2019t beat him.\nXu Shou would definitely stand on the side of the Taoist master unswervingly, that was to say, if the Taoist master wanted to control him, he would either be obedient or be beaten by Xu Shou.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nThe driver noticed Gu Jialing\u2019s unpredictable expression through the rearview mirror.\nThe child suddenly said that he wanted to move to a classmate\u2019s house, and he acted as if he was very reluctant. Could it be that he encountered an excessive campus bully just after school started?\nThe driver\u2019s expression gradually became serious.\nGu Jialing sighed resignedly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, just drive fast.\u201d\nThinking about the kindness of the Taoist master for rescuing him from the female crow demon, it would be fine to follow him for the rest of his life.\nThe Taoist master shouldn\u2019t have had any malicious intentions, it was just that he hadn\u2019t seen him for a long time and he missed him.\nThere was no need to go to self-study in the morning on military training day. Everyone put their school bags in their classrooms and were going to the playground to gather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After applying it on her face, neck, and back of her hands, there were still residues in her palms, so Su Miaomiao asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cDo you want to apply it, Taoist master?\u201d\n\u00a0Xie Jingyuan looked at her milk-white hands with a cold expression, \u201cNo need.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao applied it on her face again.\n\u201cI forgot to bring sunscreen!\u201d Yu Le, who was sitting in the middle of the classroom, flipped through her school bag and suddenly let out a howl.\nThe girls nearby looked at her. Probably because they were not familiar with her as it was just after the beginning of school, they continued to apply their own silently.\nSu Miaomiao liked Yu Le\u2019s bow.\nIf it was some delicious food, Su Miaomiao wouldn\u2019t want to share it with others, but she couldn\u2019t eat sunscreen, so Su Miaomiao called Yu Le, and then threw the sunscreen in her hand precisely.\n\u201cWow, Miaomiao, you are so kind!\u201d Yu Le was very happy, she was also a fair-skinned girl, afraid of getting too tanned.\nIt was just a trivial matter, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t take it to heart at all.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her with gentle eyes.\nWhen Yu Le came to return the sunscreen, Gu Jialing walked into the classroom.\nSeeing what Su Miaomiao casually put on the table, Gu Jialing asked curiously, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cSunscreen.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes lit up.\nHe was the only child in the family, and he usually lived with the old man, and had no chance to touch any skin care products. The children at school were young and rarely used them, so Gu Jialing didn\u2019t even know that there was such a good thing as sunscreen.\n\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Gu Jialing leaned forward, reaching for sunscreen.\nSu Miaomiao quickly covered the sunscreen with a speed that frightened Gu Jialing, and then smiled at him who jumped a few steps away, \u201cGive me the earring, and I will lend it to you.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go dream?!\u201d\nNo matter how expensive the sunscreen was, it wouldn\u2019t be that much expensive. He bought the earring for 80,000 yuan, and was scolded by the old man for almost half a year for it, and he still scolded him from time to time.\nSu Miaomiao put the sunscreen into her schoolbag.\nGu Jialing couldn\u2019t help complaining to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cLook at this, Taoist Master, she is willing to give it to others, but not to me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan seemed to have never heard it.\nGu Jialing turned his head and asked Xu Shou, \u201cDo you have sunscreen?\u201d\nXu Shou looked over coldly. What did he do to make the bird think he would use that kind of thing?\nGu Jialing patted his forehead, thinking he was crazy to ask Xu Shou such a question, but Su Miaomiao suddenly said, \u201cHe has.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c???\u201d\nXu Shou remembered what the cat\u2019s mother gave him. His face changed slightly, he touched his pocket, and threw the sunscreen to Gu Jialing expressionlessly.\nGu Jialing: \u201c!!!\u201d\nHe really didn\u2019t discover before that Xu Shou was that kind of dog.\nIn the morning, the first-year high school freshmen occupied a playground according to their classes, and there was camouflage green everywhere.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like military training. If she could turn into a cat, she would have run away.\nAlthough Su Miaomiao had promised Xie Jingyuan to complete the military training, her movements were not cooperative enough. In the words of the instructor\u2014\u201dStudent, don\u2019t you have any bones?\u201d\nThe soft arms and soft steps made the instructor almost fall asleep.\nThe instructor called Su Miaomiao out of the queue and criticized her as a typical example.\nAny other girl would be crying, but Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t show any expression, she just found Xie Jingyuan and pouted at him.\nXie Jingyuan frowned.\nSu Miaomiao was finally willing to use her strength, and completed every movement in accordance with the instructor\u2019s instructions.\n\u201cLook, isn\u2019t this good? Be more serious in the future, you are all flowers of the motherland, learning is important, and physical fitness must also be improved.\u201d\nThe instructor had a little humor and asked Su Miaomiao to return to the team.\nDuring the rest time, she looked in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s direction. Guessing that Jingyuan would definitely not let her lean on him, she leaned on Yu Le\u2019s shoulder.\nYu Le was also tired, but seeing Su Miaomiao\u2019s long and drooping eyelashes quietly after falling asleep, she couldn\u2019t bear to push Su Miaomiao away.\nXie Jingyuan naturally noticed Su Miaomiao\u2019s behavior.\nHer physique could easily bear that kind of intensity of military training, but the cat had been lazy for more than a hundred years and couldn\u2019t bear it mentally.\nPerseverance was inherently a state of mind.\n\u201cShe still loves to sleep so much,\u201d Gu Jialing squeezed the sunscreen into his palm, while speaking of Su Miaomiao.\nWhen the bird flew around and showed off his feathers in Qingxu Temple, he could always see the cat curled up in every corner of the temple.\nXu Shou glanced at him, with the same disgust in his eyes.\nAfter training for forty-five minutes, resting for ten minutes, maintaining the rhythm and practicing under the sun for a whole morning, it was finally time to disband.\nThe exhausted students rushed to the cafeteria.\nFeng Xiaoyu and the others were not in the mood to come to see Su Miaomiao and the others. They just wanted to have lunch with their classmates and go back to the classroom to catch up on sleep after eating.\nSu Miaomiao came to Xie Jingyuan again with that boneless attitude, her eyes almost couldn\u2019t be opened, \u201cTaoist Master, I\u2019m sleepy, carry me to the cafeteria.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes widened.\nXu Shou frowned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "54": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-54/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXie Jingyuan saw that Su Miaomiao might fall asleep at any time, thought for a while, and said to Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, \u201cGo to the cafeteria and bring two lunch boxes back to the classroom.\u201d\nGu Jialing tentatively asked, \u201cWill you carry her back to the classroom?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t answer, and at the same time, he didn\u2019t avoid Su Miaomiao who leaned toward his shoulder.\nGu Jialing suddenly thought of the old lady next door to the villa in the town. The old lady liked cats, and she often hugged her three cats at home like grandchildren.\nHumans were such a strange species, they always had a soft spot for cats and dogs, especially cats.\nIt seemed that the Taoist master also failed to escape that human instinct.\nGu Jialing regretted it and felt it was unfair. Why could cats and dogs be loved by humans, but birds could only be kept in small cages?\nWith such complicated emotions, Gu Jialing ignored Xu Shou and walked forward alone.\nWhen Xu Shou wanted to say something, Xie Jingyuan spoke first, \u201cJust buy what she ate last time, and any vegetables for me.\u201d\nXu Shou had no choice but to leave with the order.\nGu Jialing walked quickly, and Xu Shou didn\u2019t deliberately chase him. The two figures, the strong and the thin, blended in with the other students, but were clearly separated.\nXie Jingyuan stood where he was and waited for everyone on the playground to leave before he carried Su Miaomiao on his back.\nThe senior teaching building was the closest to the playground. Even if the second and third grades were done, they would go to the cafeteria opposite at the time, and would not go there.\nThe sun was shining on the canopy of the tree, Xie Jingyuan carried Su Miaomiao on his back, passed one shade after another, and came to the teaching building.\nHe looked at Su Miaomiao who was lying on his shoulder.\nShe was already fast asleep, her breathing was light and shallow, her body smelled of sweat.\nXie Jingyuan had been a human being for two lifetimes, he could feel the aura fluctuations aroused by the demons when they striked, but he couldn\u2019t smell the demons smell from them.\nThe cat and dog always disliked each other, but Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t even feel it.\nClass 9\u2019s classroom was empty. Xie Jingyuan pushed the door open and closed it, came to the seat with Su Miaomiao on his back, and let her lie down.\nTaking off the camouflage jacket to cover her head, to ensure that even if someone passed by outside, they would not be able to tell whether she was a boy or a girl, Xie Jingyuan went to the shared bathroom on the same floor to clean, and then returned to Class 9 as quickly as possible.\nSu Miaomiao still maintained the sleeping position, and didn\u2019t even move the coat he put on.\nXie Jingyuan sat beside her and took out a book.\nXu Shou came back faster than he expected, and bought a total of three lunch boxes, including his own.\nAlmost as soon as Xu Shougang put down the lunch box, Su Miaomiao woke up. Ten minutes of sleep was enough for her to recover from the continuous high-intensity training all morning.\n\u201cGo wash your face first,\u201d Xie Jingyuan held down the bag containing the lunch and said to the two of them.\nSu Miaomiao looked at her hands. It was a pity, if she was still a cat, she would just lick her paws and wash her face.\nXie Jingyuan moved away from his seat to give her way. Su Miaomiao stood up helplessly, when Xu Shou had already walked out of the classroom.\nNot to be outdone, Su Miaomiao chased after him. How could that speed seem like she was really tired?\nIn the corridor outside, Xu Shou watched Su Miaomiao running past him like a wind, and ran back after a while, and the moment she passed by him, she suddenly flicked a hand of water at him.\nWhen Xu Shou turned around abruptly, Su Miaomiao jumped onto the next window sill.\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe was more sensible than a cat, and had spent more time dealing with people. He knew how to hide his strength shortly after he was born again\nBut if Su Miaomiao\u2019s running and jumping was seen by her classmates, he didn\u2019t know what they would think.\n\u201cCome down,\u201d Xu Shou said coldly.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him vigilantly, \u201cThen don\u2019t hit me.\u201d\nShe knew that Xu Shou was not easy to mess with, but she couldn\u2019t help but want to tease him. For example, when she was in Qingxu, every time she saw the big black dog sleeping, Su Miaomiao wanted to play with his tail.\nXu Shou bit the cat\u2019s head, but he couldn\u2019t do anything to the girly Su Miaomiao.\nHaving lived for more than two hundred years, he had seen men beating women quite often, both in his previous and present lives.\nLooking at Su Miaomiao with a cold face, Xu Shou continued to walk forward.\nSu Miaomiao breathed a sigh of relief, and nimbly jumped to the ground.\nWhen she returned to Class 9, Xie Jingyuan had already distributed the three lunch boxes.\n\u201cThank you, Taoist Master,\u201d Su Miaomiao took a deep breath of the fish fragrance, picked up the chopsticks and started eating.\nXie Jingyuan wanted to wait for Xu Shou, so his eyes casually fell to Su Miaomiao\u2019s side. The bangs on her forehead were still wet, sticking to her fair forehead.\nXie Jingyuan looked away in time.\nXu Shou was back.\nSu Miaomiao glanced at him secretly, worried that he would sue her to Xie Jingyuan.\nXu Shou was not so talkative.\n\u201cDid you see Gu Jialing?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked while eating.\nXu Shou: \u201cYes, he sat with two girls.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIs it Feng Xiaoyu and the others?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan silently picked up his own vegetables.\nThe three of them ate quickly. When the first wave of students returned to the classroom, they had already put all the lunch boxes in the trash can over the bathroom. The windows were opened, and the wind took away the aroma of the food.\nThere was an hour and a half lunch break at noon, so Su Miaomiao continued to sleep on the table.\nGu Jialing came back almost in the last wave, holding a box of ice cream in his hand, eating while walking, enjoying himself very much.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao, then reminded him to eat outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Why should the Taoist master care about him?\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t go out, and sat back in his seat as if he didn\u2019t understand.\nSu Miaomiao sniffed, sat up, turned her head and looked at Xie Jingyuan with a pout, \u201cTaoist Master, I also want to eat ice cream, I want strawberry flavored one.\u201d\nThis trouble was brought by Gu Jialing, Xie Jingyuan put his card in front of Gu Jialing, \u201cYou go and buy it for her.\u201d\nGu Jialing protested softly, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nXu Shou squinted at him.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nNext time, he would buy two directly!\nFor the evening self-study, many freshmen in the first year of high school fell asleep.\nOn the sophomore side, Song Yang walked out of the teaching building, came to a secluded corner, and sent messages to a dozen people in one go.\nAfter sending, he put the phone in his pocket, and exhaled viciously into the night.\nAfter being a school bully for so many years, that was the first time he was beaten.\nThat person must have practiced Kung Fu, but it didn\u2019t matter, three people couldn\u2019t beat him, but what about a dozen people? It was not a martial arts movie.\nAmong the people he called, eight were punks outside the school, and he would join them with a baseball bat later.\nSong Yang didn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it, he just wanted to find a place in front of the little beauty.\n\u2014-\nThere were only two evening self-study sessions in senior one and senior two buildings, and school ended earlier than in the senior three building.\nSong Yang left the classroom ahead of time, and left the school with seven sports students on bicycles.\nThe assembly point was the place where they were beaten during the day.\nAt that point in time, there was not even a lot of traffic on that road, and there were no pedestrians for half a day, so it was very suitable for a fight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just fighting two boys, do you need to call so many people?\u201d\nBrother Zheng, the gangster leader wearing a vest and with a snake tattoo on his arm, held a cigarette holder and smiled at Song Yang.\nSong Yang had already tasted the feeling of underestimating the enemy, and said with a straight face, \u201cOne of them can easily bring down the three of us, Brother Zheng, you\u2019d better be serious.\u201d\nBrother Zheng glanced at the muscles on Song Yang\u2019s body and nodded.\nHe took most of the people to hide in the shade of the trees where the street lights couldn\u2019t reach, only Song Yang and his two companions sat on the side of the road lazily, posing provocatively.\nAt the gate of No. 1 High School, Xie Jingyuan, Su Miaomiao, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing walked out side by side.\nGu Jialing was going to move to the Xie House that night, the driver drove ahead and waited outside, with his suitcase in the trunk.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI want to take the car too.\u201d\nWho liked a bicycle when there was a car to ride?\nSu Miaomiao neither asked Gu Jialing\u2019s permission nor told Xie Jingyuan, walked directly to the black luxury car, and opened the rear door.\nThe driver looked at the little beauty in the car in surprise.\nGu Jialing was good-looking, and girls liked him since he was a child. He didn\u2019t expect to meet such a beautiful girl just after entering No. 1 High School.\nThe driver looked at Gu Jialing enviously, which man had never been young, and which boy had never dreamed of having a puppy love with the school belle.\nHowever, when the driver\u2019s eyes fell on Gu Jialing\u2019s face, he found that he was not very happy. He left the beautiful classmate alone and sat in the passenger seat.\nThe driver: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGet in the car, drive slowly, and follow their bicycles,\u201d Gu Jialing yawned, and he was also sleepy after a day of military training.\nThe driver was full of doubts.\nThe bicycles were too slow. The driver maintained a snail\u2019s speed, glanced at the girl behind who seemed to be asleep, and asked Gu Jialing in a low voice, \u201cWho is she?\u201d\nGu Jialing said unconvincingly, \u201cThe third ranker in our class.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t understand why a lazy cat\u2019s grades were so good.\nThe reason why Gu Jialing moved to the Xie House was to learn from the first and second ranker, and there was a third ranker in the same place. So the driver immediately felt relieved for the old man at home, \u201cIt\u2019s very good, they are all academic scholars. If you become friends with them, you will definitely be admitted to a prestigious university in the future.\u201d\nGu Jialing was not interested in any famous university at all, he wanted to contract a scenic area with mountains and water, and live comfortably in it.\nThe existing scenic spots were basically managed by the state, Gu Jialing thought that when the old man died, he would take out all the inheritance and develop a resort by himself.\nThe driver noticed that among the two boys riding bicycles on the side of the road, the thin one looked into the car frequently.\nThe driver: \u201cThat\u2019s Xie Jingyuan, right? Is he the boyfriend of the girl behind?\u201d\nIn the morning he saw the girl sitting on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bicycle, they looked very intimate.\nGu Jialing was almost choked by the saliva, coughed and said, \u201cWhat boyfriend? That\u2019s our \u2026monitor. He won\u2019t fall in love.\u201d\nSuch a joke. The precepts of Qingxu Temple were so strict, as the master of the temple, how could Xie Jingyuan break the precepts? And if he really broke it, he wouldn\u2019t break it for a cat.\nHumans were just partial to cats and dogs.\nGu Jialing thought sourly.\nOn the side of the road, under the street lights, one of Song Yang\u2019s followers\u2019 eyes lit up and he reminded Song Yang, \u201cLook, it seems to be them.\u201d\nSong Yang stopped swiping his phone, raised his head, narrowed his eyes slightly, and recognized the little beauty\u2019s brother and the strong boy.\n\u201cIs this person also a freshman in high school?\u201d A follower pointed to Xie Jingyuan and asked.\nIn fact, Xie Jingyuan was also wearing a camouflage uniform in the morning. Because Su Miaomiao felt that the material of the jacket was rough and uncomfortable, so he took off the jacket.\nAt that time, their attention was mostly on Su Miaomiao, and they preconceived that Xie Jingyuan was a senior high school student, but they didn\u2019t notice his pants.\nSong Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe actually called him brother for two days in a row.\nHow embarrassing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "56": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-56/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIs that car with them?\u201d\nSong Yang looked at the logo of the car and frowned. Just when he was about to give up, Gu Jialing gloated and said to the driver in the car, \u201cHurry up and go fast.\u201d\nThe driver was a little worried, \u201cThe three boys in front\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cXu Shou can deal with them by himself. They must have come to apologize. We are here, so they dare not apologize.\u201d\nThe driver thought about it, and speeded up.\nGu Jialing tilted his head and looked outside. With his eyesight, he naturally spotted the figures hidden in the dark shade.\nHe really wanted to know the true strength of Xu Shou and the Taoist master.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou stopped their bicycles and followed Song Yang into the shade of the trees, Gu Jialing immediately asked the driver to stop, and he wanted to turn back to have a look.\nBecause of the change in the speed of the car, Su Miaomiao opened her eyes slightly, just in time to see Gu Jialing going down.\nSu Miaomiao looked out and asked strangely, \u201cWhere is the Taoist master?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cFighting, let\u2019s go and have a look.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao asked cautiously, \u201cWho are they fighting with?\u201d\nGu Jialing said jokingly, \u201cOf course it\u2019s a human being.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was relieved and got out of the car.\nThe driver also got down. He felt that something was wrong. If the high school students really wanted to fight then as an adult, he should always help.\nIn the shade of trees two hundred meters away, Song Yang and Zheng Ge led people to form a circle around Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Song Yang expressionlessly, \u201cIs this how you deal with it?\u201d\nHe just asked Xu Shou to give Song Yang a brief lesson, hoping that Song Yang would stop pestering Su Miaomiao. But Song Yang, a student, used social connections to retaliate.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the baseball bats in the hands of Brother Zheng and the others. That kind of weapon was really deadly in a fight.\nSong Yang: \u201cWhy? Now you know to be afraid? How about this, you call me Brother Sheng, and don\u2019t interfere with me dating your sister in the future, I\u2019ll forget about today\u2019s matter.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was so reserved, Xu Shou couldn\u2019t bear it anymore.\nIn his eyes, Song Yang was no different from those dandies who bullied the weak and women in his previous life.\nXu Shou rushed toward Song Yang.\nSong Yang stepped back in time. At the same time, Brother Zheng and others swung their baseball bats at Xu Shou.\nThe plan couldn\u2019t keep up with the changes. At first, they only wanted to threaten the two students, but the two provoked them. Brother Zheng and the others became impulsive and immediately threw the plan aside.\nXie Jingyuan just stood there.\nXu Shou didn\u2019t catch Song Yang, but grabbed the baseball bat of Brother Zheng who was closest to him with his backhand. On the heads of the gangsters, one of the gangsters subconsciously waved and fell, and accidentally grabbed Brother Zheng\u2019s pants, revealing his red underwear.\nThe punks fell first, followed by Brother Zheng, who had lost his weapon, and was thrown by Xu Shou. His upper body was hidden in the shade of the trees, and his two thighs, which were still quite white, became even whiter under the light of the street lamps.\nSong Yang who hadn\u2019t had time to do anything yet: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou walked toward them holding a baseball bat. He had a face full of hatred and when he walked over, his eyes looked like he wanted to kill someone.\nSong Yang was discouraged, and stammered, \u201cBrother, brother, listen to my explanation, I, I really didn\u2019t want to do anything, I just wanted to scare you!\u201d\nXu Shou continued to walk toward him.\nSong Yang looked at Xie Jingyuan with hope, \u201cBrother, you are my own brother, I will listen to you from now on, okay?\u201d\nOnly then did Xie Jingyuan call out to Xu Shou.\nXu Shou pursed his lips, and coldly threw the baseball bat in front of Song Yang.\nAs expected of a sports student, Song Yang jumped up nimbly, but when he landed, he stepped on a rolling baseball and fell even worse.\nXie Jingyuan first asked Brother Zheng who was looking at his pants in a panic, \u201cHave you ever killed someone before?\u201d\nWas he crazy? Brother Zheng really was just a bully who often hung out in bars, earning some extra money by scaring people and collecting debts.\nNot to mention killing people, he didn\u2019t even hit many people. People got frightened just on seeing him.\n\u201cNo, absolutely not, that\u2019s against the law, who would dare!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Song Yang again.\nSong Yang was about to cry, \u201cBrother, the most ruthless thing I ever did was to break someone\u2019s bone. I dare not kill anyone. What age is it? Brother, don\u2019t think too much, tonight is just a misunderstanding!\u201d\nSeeing that they were telling the truth, Xie Jingyuan was silent for a few seconds, and said, \u201cIf I see you bullying people, I will send you to the police station.\u201d\nHe only catched demons, and arresting people was a matter for the government and the police.\nSong Yang and Brother Zheng also knew that he was serious, and he really had the ability to do so, so they promised that they would not cause trouble again.\nWhen Su Miaomiao, Gu Jialing, and the driver came over, they saw a group of tall young people hurriedly riding on bicycles, and scattered away like they were fleeing for their lives.\nLooking at Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou again, whose not a single strand of hair was messed up, Gu Jialing looked shocked, \u201cYou two beat a dozen of them away?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at him and clarified, \u201cXu Shou did it alone.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAll right, he knew that Xu Shou was amazing!\nSu Miaomiao yawned, not quite understanding the situation, \u201cWhy did they want to hit us?\u201d\nXu Shou thought of Song Yang\u2019s words before, glared over and said, \u201cAs if it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\nSong Yang was really blind to fall in love with the lazy cat.\nSu Miaomiao was not convinced, \u201cI didn\u2019t mess with them. The first time we met, we were fine. We only got into a fight when you came.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Thinking that he still had important matters to ask Su Miaomiao, he decided to sacrifice his hairstyle for a while.\nOutside the car, Xie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao\u2019s figure that was almost pressing on Gu Jialing\u2019s shoulder. Just as he was about to approach, Gu Jialing slammed the car door.\nThe black luxury car slowly drove away for a distance.\nIn the car, Su Miaomiao wiped her hands on Gu Jialing\u2019s clothes with disgust, and sat back in her seat.\nThe bird\u2019s feathers were very interesting, and his human hair was softer and smoother than other people. That was what Su Miaomiao discovered after two days of observation.\nIn short, she felt itchy when she saw Gu Jialing\u2019s hair.\nBut she forgot that after the military training, Gu Jialing\u2019s hair was wet and sweaty, the touch\u2026\nSu Miaomiao wiped her hands fiercely again.\nGu Jialing endured silently.\nGlancing at the two bicycles that were a certain distance behind, Gu Jialing stared at the driver who wanted to eavesdrop, leaned his head closer to Su Miaomiao, and asked in a low voice, \u201cThere is so little aura here, can you cultivate it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao also whispered, \u201cBarely able to cultivate the body, how about you?\u201d\nGu Jialing sighed deeply, \u201cMe too, I can only jump a little higher, I can\u2019t fly at all.\u201d\nToo bad, he was a bird, but he could only walk on two feet. Only God knew how much he wanted to fly.\nOn that matter, it was rare for a cat and a bird to resonate for a while.\nGu Jialing: \u201cWhat about the Taoist master? He is a human being, and his skills may be better than ours.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cHe said he is the same as us, but who knows if he\u2019s lying.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Taoist master had a sullen face every day, as if he was hiding something.\nGu Jialing: \u201cThen have you ever seen him make a move?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, and said, \u201cHe did a few times, but he knows acupoint kung fu. Pressing some places in the body can make people cry in pain, and he doesn\u2019t need to use other methods.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cThen who do you think is better, Taoist Master or Xu Shou?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOf course it\u2019s the Taoist master, otherwise why would Xu Shou flatter him so much?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026He was not flattering him, dogs are loyal, the Taoist master saved his life, so he regards him as his master.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said with disgust, \u201cHe is really spineless.\u201d\nShe listened to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s words, firstly because she couldn\u2019t beat him, and secondly because he supported her. But she never thought of recognizing Xie Jingyuan as her master.\nGu Jialing nodded in agreement.\nOutside the car, Xie Jingyuan said to Xu Shou, \u201cSu Miaomiao doesn\u2019t know that Song Yang likes her, he just greeted her once.\u201d\nThat was to explain why he chose to acquiesce with Su Miaomiao that Xu Shou had provoked the incident.\nXu Shou thought it was normal. The cat ate and slept, so how could she see people fancy toward her?\n\u201cHas this happened before? Men seem to like her in this form.\u201d\nAlthough Su Miaomiao had a completely human body, every time Xu Shou saw her, the white cat would automatically appear in his mind. So naturally he didn\u2019t think how beautiful the cat was. However, in order to seduce people, demons would turn their male into a handsome man, and their female into a bewitching beauty, so Xu Shou had to admit that Su Miaomiao\u2019s face was actually very beautiful, and it could easily attract men.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThis is the first time, after all, she is still young.\u201d\nXu Shou looked serious, \u201cWhat should I do if this kind of thing happens again in the future?\u201d\nHe was not afraid of hitting people, but he was afraid of causing unnecessary trouble.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI will handle it well.\u201d\nHigh school students were not allowed to fall in love early. If someone pursued Su Miaomiao during this period, he would just ask her to reject the other party clearly. If the other party was entangled, he would contact the person\u2019s parents.\nXie Jingyuan had already discovered that the group of students were not afraid of anything, but they were most afraid of causing trouble and alerting their parents.\n\u2014\nAfter reaching Pearl Garden, Su Mingan met Grandma Tao when she was shopping for groceries after getting off work, and only after chatting did he realize that the Xie family was about to have a boy named Gu Jialing move in with them.\nSu Mingan: \u201d I really don\u2019t know what Jing Yuan is thinking. By the way, how is Xu Shou? He\u2019s not a bad boy, is he?\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cNo, no, Xu Shou is sensible. He cooked our breakfast this morning, which was delicious. After eating, he rushed to wash the dishes. He is very diligent.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cWell, that\u2019s good, but he just moved, so you should observe more. His size and strength may be more than mine. At first glance, he is quite bluffing.\u201d\nXie Rong also said similar things to Grandma Tao, in short, it was necessary to be defensive.\nGrandma Tao had her own judgment, and she didn\u2019t want to argue with her neighbor of nearly twenty years, so she changed the subject with a smile.\nIn the evening, Su Mingan specially stewed a pot of fish soup.\nWhen the children\u2019s voices came from the corridor, Su Mingan winked at Tang Shiwei who was on the sofa, and the couple went to open the door together.\nGrandma Tao over there also opened the door almost at the same time.\nThe three elders looked at Gu Jialing in unison.\nGu Jialing and Xie Jingyuan were about the same height and body type, they were both tall and thin.\nXie Jingyuan was cold, but Gu Jialing loved to smile a lot, especially since he also had a pair of red phoenix eyes hanging from the end of his eyes, and if his hair was longer, it was really hard to tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She thought that she shouldn\u2019t look at any handsome guy for a while.\nSu Mingan also forgot to bring up the excuse of asking the children to drink fish soup.\nGrandma Tao was the most straightforward, \u201cYou little boys, why do you all look so good?\u201d\nThe lights were bright, Xu Shou\u2019s face was reddish, while Gu Jialing was generous and proud.\nSu Miaomiao looked at Grandma Tao with a complicated expression.\nSilly grandma, except for Xie Jingyuan who was really good-looking, the other two had human faces and animal hearts, and their original bodies were very ugly.\nThere were so many people, so Su Mingan and his wife brought Su Miaomiao to apartment number 1002 first.\nFor Su Miaomiao, the Xie House was her second home, and she was quite curious about which rooms Xu Shou and Gu Jialing occupied.\nThe adults were chatting in the living room, and the four high school students went to Gu Jialing\u2019s bedroom first.\nXie Jingyuan pushed open the door, and the three demons stood at the door and looked inside together.\nXie Jingyuan was rich, so he furnished Gu Jialing\u2019s room with good furniture, and there was an antique Chinese landscape painting on the wall, which was impeccable in comfort.\nGu Jialing whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s too small, not as big as the bathroom in my villa.\u201d\nXu Shou glanced at him quietly.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like to hear him showing off, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s too small, but it\u2019s bigger than your nest in Qingxu Temple.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nUnder other\u2019s eaves, Gu Jialing chose to bow his head and accept his fate, and dragged his suitcase inside.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cUnpack later, let\u2019s go eat first.\u201d\nWhen they came to the kitchen, Su Mingan also brought over the supper he prepared for his daughter.\nThere used to be a total of five people in the two families. After so many years of quiet life, the place suddenly became so lively. Su Mingan and his wife also wanted to sit down and see how the four children got along, and listened to them talk about the military training.\nThe couple sat on the sofa in the living room with Grandma Tao, but all three of them were quietly watching the dining room.\nSu Miaomiao fended off Gu Jialing\u2019s chopsticks and pulled the fish plate to her side, \u201cFather made this for me, you are not allowed to eat it.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGrandma Tao made a silent note that Gu Jialing liked to eat fish, so she would add it for supper the next day.\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t grab Su Miaomiao\u2019s fish, but went to get the braised chicken drumsticks in the bowl.\nThere were four big drumsticks in total, logically the two should share them equally.\nBut Xu Shou was too hungry, and the military training itself was tiring. He even swung a gangster who weighed more than 100 kilograms like a baseball bat several times.\nSo, Xu Shou took a chicken leg.\nHe wouldn\u2019t rob people for food, but he wouldn\u2019t feel guilty about robbing from the bird.\nGu Jialing called out, \u201cXu Shou, don\u2019t go too far!\u201d\nSu Mingan\u2019s heart sank. Xu Shou was indeed not as honest as he appeared.\nThey were eating supper for more than ten minutes. From the beginning to the end, only Xie Jingyuan was quiet, and the surrounding aura seemed to isolate him from the other three classmates.\nWhen he was full, Xu Shou picked up his and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s dishes and plates, and went to the kitchen.\nGu Jialing quickly put his bowls and chopsticks on top.\nXu Shou avoided hom quickly, and looked at him coldly, \u201cWash it yourself.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan resentfully.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cXu Shou will do dishes tonight. I\u2019ll do it tomorrow night, and Gu Jialing the day after tomorrow, the three of us will take turns on duty.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cHey, it\u2019s fine if I do it. It\u2019s important for you to study, so why waste your time doing this?\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at the silver hair on Grandma Tao\u2019s hair, and said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, grandma, we are combining work and rest. Besides, we are all smart, so we will study well.\u201d\nTang Shiwei thought that the child was good-looking and had a sweet mouth.\nSu Mingan coughed, pulled his wife up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s go home too.\u201d\nIf he stayed any longer, his wife\u2019s soul would be divided equally by the three handsome boys.\nWhile Su Mingan was washing dishes in the kitchen, Tang Shiwei followed her daughter to the bedroom and asked excitedly, \u201cMiaomiao, who do you think of the three looks the best?\u201d\nHer husband didn\u2019t like to talk about that kind of topic, so Tang Shiwei could only share it with her daughter.\nWhen the daughter was young, they had a pure mother-daughter relationship. When the daughter grew up, they could be \u201cgood sisters\u201d in addition to being mother and daughter.\nSu Miaomiao said without hesitation, \u201cOf course it is Xie Jingyuan.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe almost forgot that her daughter and Xie Jingyuan were childhood sweethearts.\n\u201cThen between Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, who will you choose?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI won\u2019t choose anyone, they are both ugly.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThat kid Xie Jingyuan was really lucky, her daughter\u2019s love was so determined and unwavering toward him.\nIn apartment 1002, Xie Jingyuan occupied the bathroom in the master bedroom to take a shower, while Xu Shou and Gu Jialing rushed into the common one at the same time with indistinguishable speed.\n\u201cGo out.\u201d\n\u201cI came first, you go out and wait.\u201d\n\u201cWanna fight?\u201d\n\u201cIf you dare to hit me, I will tell the Taoist master!\u201d\nGrandma Tao sat on the sofa and had fun. Listening to the children bickering was more interesting than watching a TV series.\nInside the common one, Xu Shou occupied the shower, and Gu Jialing occupied the bathtub.\nGu Jialing was still filling the bathtub, while Xu Shou had already started to take a shower.\nGu Jialing looked at him several times, then said, \u201cIsn\u2019t your family very poor, how did they raise you so strong?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The kind of tan after being exposed to the sun was simply a symbol of status.\n\u201cMiaomiao, I\u2019m so envious of you, you\u2019ve not got tanned at all.\u201d\nBefore the recess exercises started, Yu Le chatted next to Su Miaomiao, looking at Su Miaomiao\u2019s still pale face for a while, and then at her neck for a while.\nThey all had a clear dividing line around their necks, but Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t.\n\u201cWe obviously wore the same sunscreen,\u201d Yu Le was still thinking about the reason.\nThe girls around also looked at Su Miaomiao with envious eyes, and wanted to hear her secret.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIt has nothing to do with sunscreen, I don\u2019t get suntanned.\u201d\nThe secret of cultivation couldn\u2019t be revealed, Su Miaomiao could only tell everyone that.\nDemon cultivators like them, once their spiritual wisdom was activated, they would naturally learn to cultivate. Even in a state of deep sleep, the exercises they practiced would automatically operate, unlike human cultivators, who must meditate in an orderly manner.\nDuring the military training, Su Miaomiao may indeed have sunburned a little during the day, but after sleeping at night, the meager spiritual energy absorbed quietly improved her physique. If there was no aura in the body, naturally it would not be able to support them to cast spells.\nStanding in front of Su Miaomiao, Wang Min did not accept the reason. She also had evidence, \u201cXie Jingyuan, Gu Jialing, and Xu Shou are also not tanned. The four of you are together every day, so there must be a special detaining method.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan and Gu Jialing both had cool fair skin, while Xu Shou had a healthy dark complexion, which was even from face to arms to legs.\u00a0\nOne person could not be tanned, but four people had that kind of physique, who could believe it?\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, if you don\u2019t believe me, ask the class monitor.\u201d\nWang Min blushed. She had no nerve to ask the boy such a question.\nYu Le stayed next to Su Miaomiao during the military training, so she believed her, \u201cIt should be a natural beauty. I reapplied some sunscreen after sweating, but Miaomiao has never reapplied.\u201d\nAnother female classmate said, \u201cMaybe Su Miaomiao and the others use sunscreen that works really well. Miaomiao, which brand do you use and where did you buy it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI don\u2019t know, my mother gave it to me.\u201d\nThe female classmate: \u201cThen when you go home, ask auntie, and then tell us, okay?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cSure.\u201d\nAfter a day of class, it was Saturday.\nThe rule of No. 1 High School was that the first and second grades had weekends, and the third grade only had Sunday.\nSu Miaomiao took a good long sleep.\nShe woke up at 9:30. Her mom and dad went to work, so Su Miaomiao ate breakfast alone, and then went to ring the doorbell of 1002.\nThe Taoist master promised her that he would take her to buy sapphire earrings during the holidays and play tennis with her.\nAlmost as soon as the doorbell rang, Gu Jialing jumped up from the sofa and ran over to open the door for her.\n\u201cWhy did you sleep for so long?\u201d\nSeeing Su Miaomiao, Gu Jialing complained first, \u201cWe had breakfast at 7:30, if it wasn\u2019t for waiting for you, we\u2019d all be in the mall now!\u201d\nThe Taoist master was so partial to the cat. They were not allowed to sleep in on weekends, but he allowed the cat to sleep until she woke up naturally.\nIt wasn\u2019t because Su Miaomiao lived in 1001. If the Taoist master didn\u2019t stop him, he would have climbed out of Su Miaomiao\u2019s window to take pictures.\nAlthough he couldn\u2019t fly, climbing windows from tall buildings was not difficult for him.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him suspiciously, \u201cAre you going to the mall too?\u201d\nGu Jialing became even more angry, \u201cWhy? If the Taoist master won\u2019t buy it for me, won\u2019t I be allowed to buy it myself?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cSince you have money, why don\u2019t you go by yourself? The Taoist master should wait for me, I didn\u2019t ask you to wait.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao narrowed her eyes slightly, \u201cOr, do you also want the Taoist master to pay for it for you?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cI have money, I don\u2019t care about it!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Xie Jingyuan came out from the study, and said to the two who were arguing at the door.\nOnly then did Xu Shou turn off the TV series of the giants that was playing, and walk behind Xie Jingyuan.\nSu Miaomiao glanced at the living room, \u201cWhere\u2019s grandma?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWent to the park.\u201d\nIn the past few years, Grandma Tao had fallen in love with square dancing. After moving, she quickly integrated into a group of old ladies in the area, and had already bought three sets of dance costumes.\nXie Jingyuan taught Grandma Tao a set of Kung Fu moves to prolong life, but the rhythm was too slow to keep up with the rhythm of those popular songs. She basically only practiced at home, so as not to be out of tune with other old ladies in the square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Xie Jingyuan opened the door first, let Su Miaomiao sit in the back, and then he sat next to her.\nRelying on his strong physique, Xu Shou squeezed Gu Jialing away, and as soon as he sat down, he closed the door.\nGu Jialing gritted his teeth and went to the passenger seat.\nThe driver gave him a worried look.\nObviously that was the Gu family\u2019s car, why were the three classmates so rude?\nJust as the driver had that thought, Su Miaomiao in the back was squeezed by Xie Jingyuan. She looked at Xu Shou and said unhappily, \u201cLet Gu Jialing sit in the back, Xu Shou is taking up too much space.\u201d\nAlthough she liked the smell of Xie Jingyuan, that didn\u2019t mean she liked being squeezed by him.\nWhen resting, Su Miaomiao liked to occupy the entire sofa by herself, and liked to sleep on a big bed by herself.\nHer meaning was too obvious, Xie Jingyuan silently moved toward Xu Shou.\nXu Shou only wanted to protect the Taoist master, but realized that his body size had brought inconvenience to him, so he changed positions with Gu Jialing without hesitation.\nGu Jialing proudly said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it inconvenient for you to grow so strong?\u201d\nXu Shou ignored him in a serious and introverted way, like a professional bodyguard.\nThe driver looked at Gu Jialing\u2019s sunny smiling face, and completely swallowed his worries.\nAfter ten o\u2019clock, the four of them arrived at Longxing Building, one of the landmark buildings in Anshi.\nThere, one could find famous domestic and international brands, including jewelry, clothing, gourmet food, etc.\nGu Jialing was most familiar with that place, and took the initiative to lead the three of them to the jewelry area on the second floor.\nSu Miaomiao seldom visited jewelry stores, because Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei were afraid of their daughter\u2019s love for jewelry. If the daughter could restrain herself and only pick one or two pieces, that was fine. But not wanting to cruelly reject their daughter\u2019s expectant eyes, the couple simply added the jewelry store on the blacklist of parent-child activities, a sad place destined to disappoint their daughter.\nBefore entering the store, Xie Jingyuan emphasized to Su Miaomiao, \u201cJust buy one kind of earring.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded obediently.\nThe four of them officially stepped in.\nThe building opened at ten o\u2019clock in the morning, and the four of them came early. They were the first wave of customers of that jewelry store.\nThree men and one woman, all about fifteen or sixteen years old, the men were handsome and the woman was beautiful.\nSeveral female shop assistants were dumbfounded. After a while, they took out their phones to secretly take pictures, and were going to show off to their friends that it was like a big star visiting the store.\nIn Su Miaomiao\u2019s eyes, only the cabinets of jewels remained.\nHer eyes were drawn to, and stuck by every jewel, and her steps became slower and slower. Her fair and beautiful face was almost attached to the glass surface of the counter.\nGu Jialing was different, he only had a soft spot for blue jewelry.\nXu Shou had no interest in jewelry, and followed Su Miaomiao every step of the way with Xie Jingyuan next to him.\nXie Jingyuan told Xu Shou that he was going to leave after buying the earrings, otherwise the mall would be closed by the time Su Miaomiao finished seeing all the jewelry.\n\u201cTaoist Master, how much living expenses does uncle give you a month?\u201d\nJust as Xie Jingyuan stood still in front of the sapphire jewelry display case, Gu Jialing approached in a fawning manner. He also understood the situation, that the Gu family was just a local tyrant, but the Xie family was the richest.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nXie Rong\u2019s money was directly handed over to Grandma Tao. Since Xie Jingyuan got his own card, he had never asked Grandma Tao for money. Instead, he regularly transferred money to Grandma Tao.\nGu Jialing mistook that Xie Rong gave too much living expenses, and the Taoist master had already saved so much that he forgot the exact amount.\n\u201cTaoist Master, my living expenses for this month have been used up, why don\u2019t you support me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him, \u201cWhat do you want to buy? If it is a necessary item for high school students, I can pay for it for you.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan ignored him and looked down. There were sapphire earrings inside, but the style was different from the one Gu Jialing had.\nXie Jingyuan called Su Miaomiao, \u201cWill you pick yourself, or should I just buy it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao finally gave up those jewels that could only be seen but not bought, and went to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side.\nThere were all kinds of sapphire jewelry in the showcase, among which sapphire stud earrings belong to the smallest category.\nSu Miaomiao pointed to a necklace inlaid with eight cat-eye-sized sapphires and diamonds in the middle, \u201cMaster Taoist, I\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said coldly, \u201cNo, you can only choose earrings, a necklace is not acceptable.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao bit her lower lip and looked at him pitifully with big eyes.\nShe knew that every time she behaved like that, her parents would have the heart to refuse, and even if they refused, they would secretly feel guilty.\nXie Jingyuan frowned.\nSeeing that the method seemed to be useful, Gu Jialing hurriedly imitated Su Miaomiao\u2019s posture and looked over pitifully.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s slightly frowned brows relaxed again, and his voice became colder, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to buy it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted angrily, pushed away Gu Jialing who was in the way, and began to carefully compare the sizes of gemstones on several earrings.\nGu Jialing could only watch helplessly.\nAlthough his family had a mine, the living expenses given by the old man couldn\u2019t be enough for him to buy gems as he liked, and the earring was bought with the money he had saved for a long time.\n\u201cJing Yuan?\u201d A familiar female voice came over.\nXie Jingyuan turned his head and saw Qiao Lili walking toward the store together with two rich wives who were similar in appearance and temperament to her.\n\u201cThis is my Jing Yuan, who just entered No. 1 High School this year,\u201d Qiao Lili introduced him to her two companions with a smile as she walked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The stepmother and stepson were said to be harmonious if they just didn\u2019t hate each other.\n\u201cDid you come to accompany Miaomiao shopping?\u201d Qiao Lili glanced at Su Miaomiao, who hadn\u2019t noticed her at all, and asked with a smile.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYes.\u201d\nQiao Lili looked at Gu Jialing and Xu Shou, then continued, \u201cThese are the two new classmates who moved to live with you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYes.\u201d\nXu Shou still had that stern face, while Gu Jialing liked to smile, but he didn\u2019t show much enthusiasm for the Taoist master\u2019s stepmother.\nQiao Lili went to talk to Su Miaomiao, \u201cWhich one is Miaomiao looking at?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao happened to have a choice, and looked at Xie Jingyuan, \u201cI want this.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the price tag. Because the gems were bigger and the diamonds were more, the price of that model had exceeded 100,000.\nBut he agreed to let Su Miaomiao choose by herself.\nXie Jingyuan asked the female clerk to wrap it up, and he followed to pay.\nQiao Lili narrowed her eyes slightly. How much did Xie Rong give Xie Jingyuan a month? Did he know that Xie Jingyuan bought such a luxury for Su Miaomiao at a young age?\nXu Shou caught Qiao Lili\u2019s stingy eyes.\nIn his previous life, he had seen a stepmother drive out her stepson and stepdaughter during meals, and only allowed her own children to eat at the same table.\nThat was just an ordinary family in a small village, Xie Rong was so rich, would the Taoist master\u2019s stepmother fight against him for the family property?\nIn short, Xu Shou would not give Qiao Lili a chance, it should belong to the Taoist master. If the Taoist master did not want a dispute, he would also keep his due share for him.\nAfter buying the earrings, Xie Jingyuan took the initiative to go to the clothing store and bought two sets of summer clothes and four sets of autumn clothes for Xu Shou from a cheap sports brand.\nThat time, if Gu Jialing wanted something, Xie Jingyuan bought it for him too.\nSu Miaomiao looked at the bags they were carrying, and said casually, \u201cSo many.\u201d\nGu Jialing said, \u201cThe sum of the two of us is not as good as a fraction of yours\u201d\nShe better not try to hide her eccentricity with that method.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t understand why he was angry. Gu Jialing also had an earring, and Xu Shou didn\u2019t even envy her.\nShe turned to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go play tennis.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at his watch. It was past eleven o\u2019clock, and he said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat first, and then play in the afternoon.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao touched her belly, \u201cI\u2019m not hungry yet.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cOf course you\u2019re not hungry, what time did you get up? We ate at 7:30!\u201d\nHe and Xu Shou ate a lot of meat anyway, and the Taoist master only ate the steamed buns and vegetables\u00a0\nSu Miaomiao was beaten up several times by him, and finally got angry. She glared at him and said, \u201cIf you keep arguing, I\u2019ll pluck your hair off.\u201d\nGu Jialing covered his head in an instant and hid behind Xie Jingyuan.\nWhen the four high school students walked along the shopping mall to choose a restaurant for lunch, Qiao Lili called Xie Rong.\nXie Rong had just finished a multi-person meeting and was resting on the sofa. When he saw the caller ID, he frowned first, and then pressed the answer button.\nQiao Lili\u2019s tone was lively, \u201cGuess who I met in Longxing?\u201d\nXie Rong rubbed his forehead, \u201cWho?\u201d\nQiao Lili: \u201cJing Yuan, he and Miaomiao took two new friends out to the shopping mall. Speaking of which, they just finished military training, but they don\u2019t seem to be tanned at all.\u201d\nXie Rong was more interested in that topic and asked, \u201cHow about the two new classmates?\u201d\nQiao Lili: \u201cThey both are pretty good-looking, as cool as Jing Yuan.\u201d\nCool, just not polite.\nXie Rong took it for granted that his son was indifferent to him, so it was strange that he was warm to Qiao Lili.\nQiao Lili suddenly said bitterly, \u201cJing Yuan is more affectionate than you. He knows how to buy gems for Miaomiao at such a young age. I envy Miaomiao.\u201d\nXie Rong immediately understood the real intention of Qiao Lili\u2019s call, and his voice became cold, \u201cI have something to do, so let\u2019s talk later.\u201d\nAfter hanging up the phone, Xie Rong snorted, and laughed again after a while.\nSince Jing Yuan liked Miaomiao so much, as long as he maintained a good relationship with Miaomiao, his son would not be estranged from him.\nUnder Gu Jialing\u2019s strong suggestion, Su Miaomiao and the others chose a barbecue restaurant.\nFor the convenience of chatting, Xie Jingyuan asked for a private room.\nGu Jialing: \u201cMaster, you are rich!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cEat as much as you want, don\u2019t waste it.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe read the menu with Xu Shou. Su Miaomiao took a menu and read it with Xie Jingyuan.\nSu Miaomiao ordered what she wanted to eat.\nGu Jialing took a peek over, and when Su Miaomiao ordered the fifth piece of meat, Gu Jialing couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWill you eat so much? Didn\u2019t you hear the Taoist master say that you shouldn\u2019t waste food?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan, she never had to consider such issues when ordering food before.\nXie Jingyuan said indifferently, \u201cYou can also eat what she ordered.\u201d\nGu Jialing deliberately rebelled, \u201cAll she wants is what I don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\u201cI can eat it,\u201d Xu Shou felt that the meats were all similar, with so many fancy names, but they actually came from a cow or a pig.\nGu Jialing glared at him, and while Xie Jingyuan was picking out the staple food, he quietly said to Xu Shou, \u201cDon\u2019t you think the Taoist master is too partial to her? We are all demons of Qingxu Temple. We must strive for fair treatment. In modern society, all beings are equal.\u201d\nXu Shou thought that Gu Jialing wanted the Taoist master to buy gems for him.\nThe priest had already spent so much money for Su Miaomiao, Gu Jialing still wanted more? No matter how rich the Taoist master was, could he afford buying expensive things for the two?\nBesides, why did Su Miaomiao want earrings? Wasn\u2019t Gu Jialing the first one who showed off?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "62": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-62/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering that Gu Jialing\u2019s request would harm the interests of the Taoist master, Xu Shou said coldly, \u201cShe accompanied the Taoist master to honor his grandma for more than ten years, how long have you been here?\u201d\nEven if the Taoist master really favored Su Miaomiao, there must be a reason for it and it was not Gu Jialing\u2019s turn to gossip.\nGu Jialing understood Xu Shou\u2019s thoughts, and hated iron for not being steel (not reaching one\u2019s expectations), \u201cFoolish loyalty!\u201d\nAccording to Xu Shou\u2019s stupid loyalty, the Taoist master would sooner or later become the second Shang Zhou King (corrupted king in China). The Shang Zhou king got his physical needs met from the vixen anyway. What could a cat give the Taoist Master for physical enjoyment? The Taoist master was pure-hearted and ascetic, and he didn\u2019t covet that kind of thing.\nAfter ordering the dishes, Gu Jialing sat on the sofa. His eyes swept back and forth between Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao, trying to find the reason how she could bewitch the Taoist master.\nSu Miaomiao concentrated on admiring the newly acquired sapphire earrings.\nThe earrings were better than the one Gu Jialing had!\nGu Jialing was quickly distracted by the earrings, looked at Su Miaomiao\u2019s ears, and asked suspiciously, \u201cYou haven\u2019t got your ears pierced, why do you want earrings?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked up at him.\nGu Jialing pulled his earlobe to show her, \u201cThis is the pierced ear, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to wear it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI won\u2019t wear them, I\u2019ll keep them in a box.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cIt\u2019s too wasteful, it looks so good on your ears, and it\u2019s also convenient for you to take it off to enjoy at any time.\u201d\u00a0\nIt was better if she threw it away, and he would pick them up.\nWhen Su Miaomiao thought about it for real, Xie Jingyuan said, \u201cJewelry is not allowed in school.\u201d So Su Miaomiao put the idea aside.\nAfter eating and drinking enough, the four of them set off to play tennis.\nSu Miaomiao was the kind of player who picked up the racket and wanted to have fun at once, and Xie Jingyuan would play with her for at least half an hour.\nGu Jialing was dumbfounded, how good was the cat playing?\nWhen he was distracted, Xu Shou hit the ball which almost bounced into his face.\nGu Jialing was furious, and protested to the nearby court, \u201cMaster, let Xu Shou play with Su Miaomiao, we two can play!\u201d\nXu Shou\u2019s throw was so heavy and fast that he really couldn\u2019t handle it.\nXie Jingyuan consulted with Su Miaomiao first.\nSu Miaomiao refused. His throw was just right, as she had to work hard to catch up with Xu Shou\u2019s ball.\nPlaying was for fun, she didn\u2019t want to work hard.\nAfter playing enough, Su Miaomiao was sweating all over, leaning on the chair to rest.\nXie Jingyuan came over and handed her a bottle of water, the cap had already been unscrewed.\nGu Jialing was still playing with Xu Shou. Xu Shou played tennis very vigorously for the first time. Gu Jialing wanted to be lazy but was afraid that Xu Shou would beat him up.\nSu Miaomiao was really exhausted, so she only followed the flying ball with her eyes.\nThere was a seat between Xie Jingyuan and her, but even so, he tilted his head slightly, and could clearly see beads of sweat sliding down her rosy cheeks.\nA fifteen-year-old girl was able to marry in their previous life, but there, she had reached the age when her parents were likely to worry about puppy love.\nGrandma Tao misunderstood that he liked Su Miaomiao, and her attitude was supportive. If Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei misunderstood, it might affect the relationship between the two neighbors.\n\u201cLet me keep the earrings with me for you, okay?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked in a low voice.\nSu Miaomiao looked over suddenly, and said unhappily, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that my uncle and aunt will see it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cSo what?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cThe earrings are too expensive. If uncle and aunt know about them, they will ask you to return them to me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao frowned, her parents would indeed do that. When Grandma Tao gave her a pearl bracelet, her parents said it was too expensive.\n\u201cThen, when will they stop doing that?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked very reluctantly.\nXie Jingyuan thought for a while, and said, \u201cWhen you get admitted to university, you can decide many things by yourself.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao wished that time would pass faster.\nAfter playing the game, the four returned to Pearl Garden by car.\nGrandma Tao bought watermelons, and when she heard the voices of the children, she came to open the door and asked Su Miaomiao to come and eat too.\nThe TV was still playing in the living room. Grandma Tao knew that Xu Shou liked to watch that rich family drama, so she turned it on.\nSu Miaomiao watched casually while eating melons, until a young lady on TV sneaked into her husband\u2019s study and tried to open a cabinet.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked.\nGrandma Tao: \u201cThis is a safe. We can put valuable things in it. It is usually locked. Unless you have a combination key, no one else can open it.\u201d\nSure enough, the young lady on the TV entered the wrong password and kicked the safe angrily.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up, and she looked at Xie Jingyuan in surprise.\nIf she asked her parents to buy her a safe, and then hid her things in it, she wouldn\u2019t be afraid that her parents would find out.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan went to the master bedroom, Su Miaomiao quickly followed in and reached out to him, \u201cGive me the earrings and the five hundred yuan, I will hide them myself.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her, first took out the earrings box, then opened the drawer, and counted out five hundred-yuan bills.\n\u201cHide it before the safe arrives,\u201d he instructed.\nSu Miaomiao nodded with a smile.\nAfter putting away her things, Su Miaomiao turned and walked out, opened the door, and saw Gu Jialing sneaking away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Su Miaomiao took it out and looked at it. The screen displayed \u2013 \u201cLittle Blue Bird\u201d.\nSu Miaomiao answered.\nGu Jialing\u2019s triumphant laughter came from inside? \u201cHow is it, my safe is not bad, is it?!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hung up the phone angrily.\nWhen she walked out of Gu Jialing\u2019s room, Xie Jingyuan also came out from the master bedroom. Seeing her unhappy face, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head.\nXie Jingyuan looked inside the second bedroom, and asked again, \u201cWhat were you doing in his room?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao changed her mind and rubbed her eyes, \u201cI\u2019m sleepy, I want to sleep, but his bed is too smelly.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t doubt it, and stepped aside to open the door of the master bedroom, \u201cGo to my room, I\u2019m done.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao really went in, and threw herself on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s big bed. The clear autumn dew breath swept over her instantly, reminding Su Miaomiao of the memory of chasing butterflies in the grass when she was an ordinary white cat.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her imageless sleeping posture, and silently closed the door.\nHe went to the living room to check on Gu Jialing\u2019s homework.\nGu Jialing snorted softly, \u201cWhere is Su Miaomiao? She went to my room to search for things, is she feeling so guilty that she can\u2019t come out to see me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s face changed slightly, recalling her expression, he smiled helplessly.\nIt was just that his smile disappeared so quickly that Gu Jialing didn\u2019t even notice it.\nGu Jialing turned to complain to him, \u201cTaoist Master, she intends to steal from me, shouldn\u2019t you take care of her?\u201d\nTaoist Master, look at this cat, she is full of bad deeds, she is not worthy of favoritism!\nGu Jialing stared at Xie Jingyuan with burning eyes, and almost yelled out those words.\nXie Jingyuan nodded with a serious expression.\nHe went to the master bedroom again.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t sleep. She turned over and lay on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bed, listless.\nXie Jingyuan walked to the bed and asked her, \u201cGu Jialing said you wanted to steal his things.\u201d\nFeeling guilty, Su Miaomiao sat up, drooped her head and said, \u201cI know I was wrong, so I won\u2019t steal from now on.\u201d\nApart from guilty conscience, Su Miaomiao was also a little scared, afraid that the priest would hit her.\nShe secretly glanced at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s fair and slender right hand.\nThat hand was up!\nSu Miaomiao rolled to the side in fright, and quickly hid on the other side of the bed.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her hair that had become more messy, and said coldly, \u201cIf this happens again, I won\u2019t give you a birthday present for three years.\u201d\nAfter the heat of the military training, the freshmen also officially started their high school life full of problems.\nThe homework of different subjects piled up, and when it was evening self-study, most of the students were immersed in doing them.\nBoth Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou were extremely self-disciplined people. Xie Jingyuan trained Su Miaomiao to be self-disciplined. She could only go to bed after finishing her homework.\nCompared with the three of them, Gu Jialing was a bit out of place.\nHe was smart, and the subjects in primary and junior high schools used to be relatively simple. Gu Jialing often kept his grades among the top three in the class without doing homework.\nGu Jialing, who claimed to be smart, just wanted to sleep or do something else during his evening self-study.\nHe put on the earphones and secretly listened to music.\nIt was just that he had just finished his preparations and hadn\u2019t adjusted the volume when Xu Shou suddenly snatched his phone and earphones away.\nGu Jialing angrily said in a low voice, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cDo your homework.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They were all doing their homework at that moment, including the bottom few, trying to catch up with the students in front.\nThe high school entrance examination results were only their starting point, and they still had three years to catch up and overtake.\nThat atmosphere of studying hard made Gu Jialing a little guilty.\nXu Shou looked at Su Miaomiao who was doing homework obediently in front of him, and whispered provocatively, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t beat a cat when you were a bird, do you want to lose to her even in exams?\u201d\nHis words awakened the dreamer, Gu Jialing suddenly understood why the Taoist master always favored Su Miaomiao.\nBecause Su Miaomiao was obedient and her grades were good.\nSo, when his grades surpass Su Miaomiao, would the Taoist master be willing to buy him gems?\nGu Jialing found motivation, without Xu Shou\u2019s supervision, he took the initiative to ask Xu Shou for the homework, and started to study hard.\nConcentrating on homework during self-study, when teachers asked questions in class, Gu Jialing also actively raised his hand, unlike Su Miaomiao, who had to be called to stand up.\nSo, when the old man of the Gu family called the class teacher to ask about his grandson\u2019s performance, he got a very positive answer.\nMr. Gu was very happy, thinking that it was all because of Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou, two toppers, so he felt more at ease letting his grandson live in the Xie House.\n\u2014\u2013\nDuring the Mid-Autumn Festival, the school was on holiday and the students were given three days off.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou were going home for the holidays.\nXie Jingyuan took them to the supermarket once and bought Mid-Autumn Festival gifts for the elders respectively. Since the town the Gu family lived in and the village the Xu family lived in were both in the northwest of Anshi, Gu Jialing offered to send Xu Shou home so that he would not have to travel by the crowded bus.\n\u201cRespect the elderly well after returning home, and don\u2019t cause trouble,\u201dXie Jingyuan told the two beside the black luxury car.\nXu Shou nodded, Gu Jialing smiled playfully, happily like a bird about to get out of the cage, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Taoist Master, we are not like the cat.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan took another look at him and stepped back.\nThe black luxury car drove away.\nXie Jingyuan returned upstairs, just in time to meet the three members of the Su family who just came out of 1001.\nSu Miaomiao was going back to her hometown in the county with her parents to visit her grandparents.\nRegarding distance, the whole family had discussed it. They would go to Su\u2019s hometown for short vacations, and Tang\u2019s house in Jiang City for long National Day holidays.\nOf course, Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei were very busy, only Su Miaomiao could stay on both sides for a longer period of time.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going, see you later,\u201d Su Mingan happily patted Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder, but there was another emotion conveyed in his eyes.\nOnly in the festivals would Su Mingan spend more time with his daughter than Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan politely sent the three of them to the elevator.\nWhen the elevator door was about to close, Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei both noticed that Xie Jingyuan\u2019s last gaze fell on their daughter\u2019s face.\nThe husband and wife had different thoughts, only Su Miaomiao understood Xie Jingyuan\u2019s meaning \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t steal, don\u2019t fight with others\u201d.\nDuring the Mid-Autumn Festival, Xie Jingyuan and Grandma Tao also went to the villa where Xie Rong and Qiao Lili lived together.\nThe dinner in the villa was well prepared, and Qiao Lili specially asked the chef to cook five or six vegetarian dishes for Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan still had that indifferent expression, he didn\u2019t care whether others treated him well or badly.\nXie Wenlan snorted.\nWhen Su Miaomiao was around, Xie Wenlan wanted to compete with Su Miaomiao for the favor of Xie Jinyuan and grandma, but when she was gone, Xie Wenlan didn\u2019t like him.\nAlthough her mother was a stepmother, she had never abused Xie Jingyuan. Why did Xie Jingyuan always put on a bad face?\n\u201cBrother, don\u2019t you know how to smile?\u201d Xie Wenlan asked jokingly.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her.\nXie Wenlan: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you smile anyway.\u201d\nQiao Lili stared over, \u201cYou talk too much, eat your food.\u201d\nXie Wenlan continued to say, \u201cBrother, a classmate of mine told me that she saw you buying diamond earrings for Su Miaomiao. I\u2019m also your own sister, so why don\u2019t you buy one for me too? I\u2019m not asking much. It doesn\u2019t need to be worth a hundred thousand, just buy one for me worth a few thousand yuan.\u201d\nHundreds of thousands?\nHer twin brother Xie Jingze almost spat out a mouthful of saliva, looking at his father in disbelief.\nHe was too partial. His father only gave him five thousand yuan a month for living expenses, and his mother was not allowed to give him any more. How could his eldest brother spend more than a hundred thousand yuan at once?\nHe was not convinced. Of course, Xie Wenlan deliberately told the matter for the same reason.\nXie Rong ate as if nothing had happened, and the children\u2019s quarrels did not make him angry.\nQiao Lili taught the twins a lesson, \u201cIf you want earrings, save money by yourself. Your elder brother has been sensible since he was a child, and he didn\u2019t spend money recklessly, so he could save so much. He is not like you, who spends all their living expenses every month. You have no sense of financial management.\u201d\nXie Wenlan curled her lips, \u201cIt may also be that the eldest brother has good grades, and father shows too much favoritism.\u201d\nXie Rong still ate calmly, neither admitting or denying it.\nHe did transfer a hundred thousand yuan to Grandma Tao every month, and he would give an extra during the holidays. The money was said to be for the living expenses of his mother and son, but given the love his mother had for Jing Yuan, the hundred thousand yuan could basically be at Jing Yuan\u2019s disposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Last year, Jingyuan even wrote a book, and the publishing fee alone cost one million. He doesn\u2019t have to ask us adults for money for a long time, and if you two feel that your parents don\u2019t give you enough money, you can find a way to earn it yourself.\u201d\nGrandma Tao said these words proudly.\nXie Rong, Qiao Lili, and the twins were all shocked, they all looked at Grandma Tao, and then at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan still had that indifferent expression.\nGrandma Tao: \u201cJing Yuan is low-key and doesn\u2019t like to show off, so you don\u2019t have to ask me what book it is, I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d\nBut the more she wanted to keep it mysterious, the more curious Qiao Lili and the twins became.\nBecause Xie Jingyuan was too academic, they didn\u2019t question the authenticity of the matter.\nNo matter how they asked, Grandma Tao just didn\u2019t say anything.\nXie Jingyuan finished his meal silently, put down his chopsticks and said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to my room first.\u201d\nXie Rong thought for a while, and left with his son.\n\u201cCan you tell Dad?\u201d Xie Rong asked with a smile.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that you will be at a disadvantage in terms of contract because you are young.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI have studied the publishing market and contract law.\u201d\nXie Rong changed the subject, \u201cI know you and Miaomiao have a good relationship, but at this stage the most important thing is to study, don\u2019t go too far with some things.\u201d\nA boy suddenly giving such an expensive gift was like a sense of ritual for a special event between lovers.\nXie Jingyuan frowned, and said coldly, \u201cHow I spend my own income has nothing to do with you.\u201d\nXie Rong coughed, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about buying earrings.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan stopped and looked directly at Xie Rong, not understanding what he meant.\nXie Rong wanted to remind his son, but when he saw his son\u2019s clear eyes, which was rare among high school boys, Xie Rong paused and swallowed his words.\nHe didn\u2019t know why, but he just had a feeling that no matter how much his son liked Miaomiao, he wouldn\u2019t be impulsive, holding hands and kissing was the limit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dad believes in you,\u201d Xie Rong smiled and patted his son on the shoulder.\nXie Jingyuan avoided it and walked to the second floor alone.\nAfter closing the door, Xie Jingyuan walked to the balcony, the breeze blew in, and the faint smell of grass and trees suppressed the irritability in his heart.\nHe didn\u2019t like that kind of meaningless entertainment.\nStanding alone for a while, Xie Jingyuan closed the glass door of the balcony, took out his phone, and first dialed Su Miaomiao\u2019s number.\nSu Miaomiao was sitting in the living room of her grandfather\u2019s house. Many relatives came to the house. Some were busy with dinner in the kitchen, and some seized the time to play mahjong. She had an ice cream in her hand and watched the relatives play cards while eating.\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u00a0\nA strange girl\u2019s face broke into the screen. Seeing Xie Jingyuan\u2019s too handsome face, the girl screamed and avoided the camera.\nSu Miaomiao explained to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cMy cousin.\u201d\nShe had so many older sisters.\nXie Jingyuan just wanted to confirm what she was doing, and now that he knew, he wanted to end the call.\nSu Miaomiao went to the bedroom with her phone, knowing that he didn\u2019t like the noise outside.\n\u201cAre you in the villa?\u201d Su Miaomiao moved her face closer to the screen, looking at the room furnishings behind Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan subconsciously dodged back, as if her head would really pass through the screen and hit him.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go back home tomorrow morning.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWe have to stay one more night. A cousin is getting married tomorrow. She invited us to dinner.\u201d\n\u00a0Xie Jingyuan: \u201cYour ice cream is going to melt.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked down and quickly licked it.\nXie Jingyuan looked away, and said lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can go to accompany your relatives.\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao looked at the screen again, the video was over.\nShe didn\u2019t think too much, the Taoist master was always worried about her. As long as she was outside, the Taoist master would definitely use that method to supervise her.\nXie Jingyuan who hung up the video sat silently for a few minutes, then dialed Gu Jialing\u2019s number.\nGu Jialing was playing \u201cAngry Bird\u201d in the study behind the old man\u2019s back, and the phone on the table lit up, showing \u201cTaoist Master\u201d.\nHis pupils shrank, and immediately closed the computer screen, and he quickly moved to the desk where he was doing his homework, pretending to be concentrating on the problem.\nAfter the video went through, Xie Jingyuan saw the black headphones on Gu Jialing\u2019s head at a glance, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cDoing my homework.\u201d\nHe held up the exercise book for Xie Jingyuan to read.\nXie Jingyuan did not expose him.\nAs long as Gu Jialing didn\u2019t go out to flirt with girls, playing games was fine.\nAfter checking those two, Xie Jingyuan also contacted Xu Shou.\nXu Shou\u2019s face couldn\u2019t be seen in the video, only the panting sound could be heard, \u201cTaoist Master, our neighbor\u2019s chicken was stolen by a weasel. I will have to chase it first. I will call you later.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nOn the last day of the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, because Tang Shiwei had to go to work, the three members of the Su family got up at five in the morning and drove to Anshi.\nAt 7:30, Su Mingan sent his wife to the hospital smoothly.\nTang Shiwei looked at her sleeping daughter beside her, smiled, and got out of the car.\nSu Mingan continued to drive toward Pearl Garden. When he arrived at the gate of the community, he received news that something went wrong with a project. He had to wake his daughter up and let her go home alone.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, find a restaurant outside, or go to grandma\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0\nAlthough he was in a hurry to set off, Su Mingan couldn\u2019t help exhorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Knowing that Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t like vegetables, Xie Jingyuan only boiled a poached egg for her and sprinkled some dried shrimps.\nHe came to the dining table with a bowl, and the aroma drifted away with the steaming mist.\nSu Miaomiao sniffed, got up from the sofa, rubbed her eyes and walked to the dining table.\nShe slept all the way in the car, and then lay on the sofa for a while, so her soft hair became more messy.\nHer face was still hot, so Xie Jingyuan asked her to go to the bathroom to wash her face first.\nSu Miaomiao shifted sleepily.\nThe cold water washed away most of the drowsiness, and when it was time to wipe her face, Su Miaomiao looked at the few towels hanging there, picked up Xie Jingyuan\u2019s one accurately, and wiped her face casually.\nXie Jingyuan came over and happened to see her hang up the towel.\n\u201cWhat time did you leave in the morning?\u201d Sitting at the dining table, Xie Jingyuan looked at her and asked. He hadn\u2019t seen her for two days, and there was no obvious change in her body.\nSu Miaomiao said, \u201cI got up at five o\u2019clock, mom works really hard.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cKnowing that your parents are hard-working, you should be diligent and help your parents with housework more often, like Xu Shou, who had been helping his family collect corn and peanuts for the past two days.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at him and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Gu Jialing?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThere is a barren hill in their town, the Gu family had contracted it. Gu Jialing had been helping to plant trees.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao buried her head in eating noodles and was about to go home after eating.\nXie Jingyuan looked toward the sofa, \u201cYour bag.\u201d\nIt was only then that Su Miaomiao remembered her pearl satchel, walked over to pick it up, and when she was already at the door, she thought of something, lowered her head and opened the zipper, took out a palm-sized red gift box from the bag, and handed it to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cThere were a lot of wedding candies left from my cousin\u2019s wedding. You like peach flavored ones, so I picked out all the peach flavored ones, here.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was a person who didn\u2019t like snacks.\nSo when he was a child, he ate peach-flavored hard candies a few times, and Su Miaomiao remembered it.\nXie Jingyuan was stunned for a few seconds before finally accepting the unexpected gift.\nSu Miaomiao smiled, held his wrist and said, \u201cI want to help my parents clean, will you help me?\u201d\nTaking advantage of people who ate softness (to be prone to gentle persuasion but resilient to force) was a principle taught to her by humans.\nXie Jingyuan showed helplessness, and followed her to 1001.\nThe Su family also had a four-bedroom layout, with two bedrooms, a study room, and a gymnasium. It was spacious and tidy.\nSu Miaomiao fell asleep on the sofa after cleaning the living room, and Xie Jingyuan did all the rest of the work by himself.\nWhen cleaning Su Miaomiao\u2019s room, Xie Jingyuan saw two photo frames on her desk, one was a photo of her with her parents, and the other was a photo of her with her grandparents.\nShe smiled in both photos.\nSome dust fell on the glass mirror of the photo frame, Xie Jingyuan picked it up and wiped it lightly.\nIn the afternoon, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing also came back one after another.\nBecause Xie Jingyuan bought gifts for them to take back, the elders also sent a gift, both of which were the freshest local products.\nThe Xu family sent a big bag of freshly unearthed peanuts. Xu Shou washed some of them and went to the kitchen to boil them in salt water.\nGu Jialing carried a large bag of red chestnuts, which were big and plump, and could be fried or cooked.\nGrandma Tao and Xu Shou got busy in the kitchen, cooking a large table of dishes, and called everyone over to eat together in the evening.\nTang Shiwei brought a lot of wedding candies, all packaged, and distributed one to each student, and the rest to Grandma Tao.\n\u00a0\u201cHey, I like to eat chocolate, give me your chocolate,\u201d Gu Jialing leaned over to Xu Shou\u2019s side, wanting to grab the chocolate.\nXu Shou pushed him away rudely.\nXie Jingyuan observed silently, and found that there was no peach-flavored hard candy in their wedding candy boxes.\nThe National Day was right next to the Mid-Autumn Festival. After enjoying the last long vacation, high school students started to study intensively again to prepare for the mid-term exams next month.\nHowever, before the midterm exams, there was another fall sports meeting to be held.\nEducation advocated the all-round development of morality, intelligence, physique, art and labor, and the sports meeting was also an indispensable activity for any school.\nThe sports committee of Class 9 had a task and actively mobilized everyone to sign up for the competition.\n\u201cStudents, it was said that our Class 9 is filled with all top students, nerds who can do nothing but study, do you like to hear this? Are we not going to take advantage of this sports meeting to wash away the labels that others put on us?\u201d\nThe sports committee member\u2019s voice was too loud, waking up Su Miaomiao who was sleeping on the table.\n\u201cWhat is he shouting for?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked Xie Jingyuan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are all cheap things like water cups, towels, and school bags. I have participated in it once but I am no longer interested in it.\u201d\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Xu Shou raised his hand.\nThe sports committee member ran over excitedly holding the registration form, \u201cXu Shou, Xu Shou, what competition do you want to sign up for?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cHow many things can one person sign up for?\u201d\nSports Committee: \u201cIn principle, there is no requirement, but it is best not to exceed four.\u201d\nXu Shou took the registration form and chose 400 meters, 800 meters, 5,000 meters and shot put.\nUsually 5,000 meters and shot put were the most unpopular events, but Xu Shou took the initiative to carry the banner, and the sports committee member quickly mobilized everyone to applaud Xu Shou.\nAfter the applause fell, Gu Jialing asked Xu Shou, \u201cYou are really not tired, what are you trying to do?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s for the collective honor of Class 9!\u201d\nXu Shou\u2019s pale wheat-colored face flushed slightly.\nHe was really doing it just for the prizes. In the past, he participated in the sports meeting, even though he only brought back some daily necessities, his grandparents would smile very happily.\n\u201cGu Jialing, I think you run very fast, do you want to sign up for a sprint?\u201d The sports committee urged almost flatteringly.\nGu Jialing was unmoved.\n\u201cYou are so handsome, the sports meeting is a good opportunity for you to show your face in front of all the girls in the school. I heard that the girls in the school forum are going to select the school grass. This title is tailor-made for you. Do you want to give it to someone else?\u201d\nGu Jialing touched his face, agreed, and checked 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump, and high jump.\nThe boys had a total of fourteen events, and the two of them filled eight of them. The sports committee member felt that he had made a lot of money. He cast his earnest eyes on Xie Jingyuan, \u201cMonitor, you are the monitor. Take the lead, okay?\u201d\nGu Jialing stared at Xie Jingyuan with the eyes of watching a show.\nSu Miaomiao praised the Taoist master so much, but he didn\u2019t know if he really had hidden strength or something else.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Gu Jialing, and chose the 200 meters, long jump, high jump, and checked the javelin throw for the last one.\nWhen Gu Jialing saw it, his expression became extremely complicated, \u201cTaoist Master, you deliberately chose the same ones as me, because you want to compete with me for the position of the school grass?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou\u2019re so ugly, it\u2019s impossible for you to be selected as the school grass.\u201d\n(School grass: most handsome boy in the school)\nGu Jialing: \u201cShut up, this is a conversation among athletes.\u201d\nSports committee member, \u201cSu Miaomiao, if you sign up too, the four of you will be athletes!\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cShe can\u2019t, unless you give her something good.\u201d\nThe sports committee member remembered Su Miaomiao\u2019s self-introduction at the beginning of the term, and immediately said, \u201cThere are all good things. In addition to the school prizes, our class has prepared participation prizes for every student who signs up, such as mineral water and snacks. If you can get a rank, you will get special prizes.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cCan I pick the snacks myself?\u201d\nSports committee member: \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao picked a few items, all of which were junk food and not expensive.\nThe sports committee noted down that other students must also like those snacks, so he just decided to purchase them.\nThe prizes were all set, and Su Miaomiao chose 100 meters, 400 meters, high jump, and long jump\nShe wanted to win the events where the dog and the bird may win the championship, so that the two of them could not be able to show off.\nThe biggest winner, the sports committee member, walked away contentedly, and continued to call on other students.\nThe group of four from Qingxu Temple really played a very good leading role, and other students in Class 9 who were confident in their athletic ability also signed up for corresponding events.\nAs for other classes, almost all of those competitions depended on the sports talents in the class.\nThe autumn sports meeting was also the best opportunity for sports students to show off their talents.\nOn the basketball court, Song Yang jumped lightly and shot a beautiful three-pointer.\nThe surrounding girls all screamed.\nSong Yang glanced around and quickly looked away.\nHe still liked Su Miaomiao the most.\nIt had been so long since school started, Song Yang had already found out the names of Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao, but unfortunately Xu Shou was too powerful. Song Yang dared not provoke Su Miaomiao again.\n\u201cBrother Yang, don\u2019t be discouraged. The key to this matter lies in Su Miaomiao. As long as she likes you, can others stop her?\u201d\nSong Yang: \u201cHe is her childhood sweetheart, how can she change her mind so easily?\u201d\nIn addition to being better than Xie Jingyuan in sports, he was far inferior in appearance and grades, and the road of relying on power for love had been blocked early on.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily the case. What\u2019s so good about being a nerd? I read those campus novels, in which the school belle liked the school bully. When you make a splash at the sports meeting, Su Miaomiao will definitely notice you.\u201d\nSong Yang twirled the basketball in his hand, and there was a glimmer of hope in his eyes.\nAfter filling out the registration form, there was still one week before the sports meeting.\nDuring that period, participating athletes may not participate in morning and evening self-study and spend time on training.\nOf course, that was all voluntary. Some students prefer to do their homework, and they may not be willing to delay their studies because of interest.\nFor Class 9, Xie Jingyuan packed his schoolbag after self-study, and was going to take Su Miaomiao and the two to the playground for training.\nGu Jialing whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary, is it? With our physique, we can win easily.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan just stood up and walked out first.\nSu Miaomiao and Xu Shou followed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "68": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-68/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGu Jialing sighed deeply. He didn\u2019t like training, but he didn\u2019t like being alone either.\nAt that point in time, there were sports special students from each class of the three grades gathered on the playground, as well as some ordinary students participating in the competition.\nBefore stepping into the playground, Xie Jingyuan walked under a tree and whispered to the three demons, \u201cWe can win the competition, but we can\u2019t surpass the second place too much. The training is also to cover up our special physique.\u201d\nThere were all kinds of geniuses among human beings, but geniuses also needed daily hard work.\nA top student needed to acquire knowledge by self-study or listening to lectures. Athletes also needed persistent training to be far ahead. Talent was just getting twice the result with half the effort. A person who had talent but did not put in any effort would never be able to achieve results in any field, including their current physique, which was also the result of absorbing spiritual energy to make their bodies better.\nCultivation was a secret, if they usually just studied, but suddenly became a blockbuster in the competition, and easily beat the top sports students selected from thousands of people in this city, it may cause some unnecessary doubts.\nXu Shou nodded, \u201cTaoist Master, you are right.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cBe low-key, I understand.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to think about any rationale, she just followed what the Taoist master said.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nThe four of them ran in circles along the playground at a relatively normal speed.\nSong Yang was also on the playground. His specialty was track and field.\nSports special students had to train every day. At that time, Song Yang had just finished his long-distance running and was sitting on the side of the long jump field to rest, surrounded by a few followers.\nThere were street lights around the playground, even though the brightness was limited in the dark, when Su Miaomiao ran over with Xie Jingyuan and the others, Song Yang recognized her at a glance.\nHe jumped up excitedly.\nIn the past, he thought that the love reaction of the heart beating fast would happen only to\u00a0 a fool. It was not until he met Su Miaomiao that Song Yang realized that he could really get excited when he saw her.\nTelling the followers to stay where they were, Song Yang rubbed his hands, trotted over, and greeted Xie Jingyuan enthusiastically, \u201cBrother, you also want to participate in this sports meeting?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him lightly.\nXu Shou approached Song Yang, and said coldly, \u201cGo aside, don\u2019t disturb us.\u201d\nSeeing Xu Shou, Song Yang remembered the embarrassing scene of Zheng Ge being thrown into the green trees. He smiled awkwardly, turned around in seconds, but didn\u2019t say a word of nonsense.\nWithout even being able to catch up with Su Miaomiao, Song Yang returned to his followers in despair.\nFollower A: \u201cFrom those three, Xu Shou is the best in terms of body shape. I heard that they are from the toppers class. There is really no one we can choose among the two.\u201d\nFollower B: \u201cWhy did Miaomiao come to train with them?\u201d\nSong Yang: \u201cMiaomiao is something you can call her by?\u201d\nFollower B: \u201cI was wrong, I should call her little flower.\u201d\u00a0 (campus belle)\nSong Yang looked sourly at Su Miaomiao obediently following Xie Jingyuan\u2019s figure. She was obedient in appearance and personality. If Su Miaomiao fell in love with him, she would definitely listen to him, right?\nLove was the driving force, Song Yang continued to train, he was determined to perform well in front of Su Miaomiao. He deliberately ran fast, and surpassed them like a gust of wind.\n\u00a0Gu Jialing: \u201cThis kid, is he provoking us?\u201d\nHe was going to speed up, but Xu Shou grabbed him in time, remembering the Taoist master\u2019s instruction to keep a low profile.\nGu Jialing had no choice but to run slowly.\nAfter the training was over, the four of them went to the classroom to get their bags. When they walked out of the teaching building, they happened to meet Song Yang and the others coming back from training.\nSong Yang saw the school bag that Xie Jingyuan was carrying for Su Miaomiao at a glance.\nHe got sour again. As long as Su Miaomiao was willing to be his girlfriend, let alone carrying her school bag, he would be happy to carry her to and from school.\nOn October 21st, No. 1 High School\u2019s current autumn sports meeting officially started.\nThe students of the three grades all moved their benches to the playground, and each class occupied a space.\nXie Jingyuan, Su Miaomiao and other athletes set up their benches and went to the first-year athletes\u2019 place to gather.\n\u201cMiaomiao!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMiaomiao!\u201d\nWhen they passed by, Feng Xiaoyu and Cheng Yue, the two good friends, stood up excitedly and cheered for her.\nHigh school studies were too heavy. Because the teacher delayed the class and other reasons, the time each class ended was different. Soon after the start of school, Feng Xiaoyu, Cheng Yue, Zhou Yao, and Lin Xi no longer deliberately waited for each other to eat in the cafeteria. They ate together with the new classmates in the class. Even on weekends, the contact got less, they only waved and greeted each other when they met in school.\nMost students went through the process, and some even met a new best friend in elementary school, middle school, high school, and college.\nSu Miaomiao looked over to where Feng Xiaoyu and Cheng Yue were, but unfortunately there were too many people and she couldn\u2019t see anyone clearly.\nAfter the opening ceremony, the competitions would start everywhere.\nSome students seized the time to take out the test papers to do the questions, and some called their friends to go to the competition venue to watch.\nThe Qingxu four-member team all had track and field events, so they came there to prepare together.\nThe competition started with the first graders, and the boys 100-meter sprint.\nGu Jialing\u2019s tracksuit had the number \u201c9\u201d on it, and everyone lined up. He looked at the female students around him and raised his hand to brush his hair.\nGirls: \u201cSo handsome!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe approached Xie Jingyuan and said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you apply for the 100-meter sprint?\u201d It was best to suppress Gu Jialing in all four.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "69": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-69/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXie Jingyuan could see that Gu Jialing had always wanted to test his strength. In order to suppress his evil heart, he picked three competitions with Gu Jialing.\nHowever, Gu Jialing was proud, lest the suppression be too severe and the bird\u2019s psychology would go wrong.\nDuring the short time between the two of them whispering, the 100-meter sprint got over, and Gu Jialing came first.\nNext was the 100-meter sprint for the first-year girls.\nSu Miaomiao walked to the starting point and saw other girls warming up. She remembered what the Taoist master said, so she followed suit.\nSong Yang stared at her intently.\nFollower A: \u201cThe school belle is also participating in the competition, can she do it?\u201d\nLook at that fair face, as if it hadn\u2019t been exposed to the sun all day, look at those arms and legs\u2026\nWait, there was a little muscle?\nWhen the whistle was blown, the game began.\nSong Yang clenched his fists involuntarily, watching Su Miaomiao rushing out swiftly, her white loose sportswear was blown up by the wind. She was very fast, but her expression was as relaxed as if she was doing morning exercises.\n\u201cOh my god, the school belle came first!\u201d\nFollow B looked at Song Yang in disbelief, but he saw him staring at Su Miaomiao at the finish line with fascination.\nWhen it was Xie Jingyuan and Gu Jialing\u2019s turn to participate in the 200-meter sprint, Song Yang finally stopped looking at Su Miaomiao. With the corners of his mouth raised contemptuously, his arms folded, he observed Xie Jingyuan as if watching a show.\nXie Jingyuan looked serious.\nHe knew that Gu Jialing was very fast, so he would not underestimate the enemy.\nWhen the whistle sounded, he and Gu Jialing rushed out almost at the same time.\nGu Jialing only wanted to win, and forgot Xie Jingyuan\u2019s request to keep a low profile. Xie Jingyuan wanted to suppress Gu Jialing\u2019s rebellious thoughts, and forgot to keep his strength.\nTwo hundred meters, half the playground, such a short distance, Xie Jingyuan and Gu Jialing just threw a few high school students out of half a circle.\nXie Jingyuan was more than twenty meters faster than Gu Jialing.\nSu Miaomiao smiled. She knew that she couldn\u2019t win against the Taoist master, then Gu Jialing would definitely not be able to.\nSong Yang was dumbfounded. The arms hugging his chest were lowered at some point, and his jaw almost fell to the ground.\nFollower A: \u201cIs this dude running faster than us?\u201d\u00a0\nOutside the finish line of the 200-meter sprint, Gu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan in front of him while panting, and finally couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cTaoist Master, are you really human?\u201d\nCould he be a ten-thousand-year-old demon hiding his secrets and was a Taoist master?\nXie Jingyuan noticed the gazes of the students around him, and secretly got annoyed that he forgot to control the speed.\nHe didn\u2019t want to show off again, so he deliberately lost to Gu Jialing in the long jump. But because Gu Jialing was too proud, Xie Jingyuan overtook him in the high jump.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan threw the javelin throw with the murderous intent of slaying monsters and demons, Gu Jialing was completely convinced.\nXie Jingyuan finished all the competitions and walked over to watch Su Miaomiao\u2019s high jump.\nBesides Su Miaomiao, Wang Min also signed up for the high jump.\nWang Min used to be the best at high jumps, and won the high jump championship in junior high school. But as far as she knew, Su Miaomiao had never participated in the high jump competition.\nTherefore, even though Su Miaomiao had won the first place in the other three events, Wang Min was still full of confidence in herself.\nBecause there were still two female special students, Wang Min\u2019s goal was to win the third place.\nThe high jump bar had been moved to 160.\nWang Min took a deep breath. She had tried that height before, and the success rate was fifty percent.\nAfter the run-up, Wang Min jumped, but unfortunately she was unlucky that day. She touched the bar, and the bar landed almost at the same time as her.\nFang Jing ran over to support her, and encouraged her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you were already very good.\u201d\nWang Min forced a smile on her face and went to watch Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao was actually eating dried fish, which was a class award she had won earlier, and the sports committee member was extremely dog-legged (one who follows a villain henchman hired thug), so he was also watching the game there at the moment.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou walked over side by side and stood beside Xie Jingyuan.\nThey watched Su Miaomiao jumping from a height of 170.\nAt that time, she had already won the competition.\nThe coach was very excited and encouraged Su Miaomiao to do 175, which was the standard for domestic women\u2019s first-level high jump athletes.\nSu Miaomiao liked jumping games.\nXie Jingyuan hesitated, but seeing her looking up at the crossbar, he finally didn\u2019t speak.\nEveryone watched as Su Miaomiao ran over, leaped lightly, and flew over the crossbar with a beautiful back-and-forth movement like a carp leaping over a dragon\u2019s gate.\nThe scene seemed to freeze at that moment.\nThe autumn wind blew up the hair on the girl\u2019s forehead, and she was actually smiling, with the corners of her lips curled up in enjoyment, and the blue sky was reflected in her bright black eyes.\nThe freeze frame moved, and in the silence, Su Miaomiao landed steadily on the spring cushion.\nThe coach jumped up, ran over in person, and adjusted the crossbar to a height of 180. He could see that Su Miaomiao still had a lot of room for challenge.\nGu Jialing coughed and reminded Su Miaomiao to give up.\nBut she ignored him, looked at Xie Jingyuan, her peach-colored lips pursed slightly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026Be careful.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao participated in three competitions that day, and she also jumped many times in the last high jump competition.\nHer power was strong, but her stamina was much inferior in comparison, and she was already a little out of breath.\nTeacher Cao, the referee in charge of the women\u2019s high jump competition, was not even 1.8 meters tall. When he adjusted the crossbar, the onlookers realized more clearly how difficult 180 was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "70": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-70/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCome on, Miaomiao!\u201d Feng Xiaoyu, Cheng Yue, Zhou Yao, and Lin Xi all came, and Yu Le, the girl from Class 9 who had the best relationship with Su Miaomiao, was also there.\nThose were friendly people, and almost all the other students in Class 9 crowded there, and there were even students from other classes who were attracted by that crowd.\nThe short ones squeezed forward, the tall ones tiptoed, and the high jump field was surrounded.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation over there?\u201d The school leadership team in the spectator seats also looked over.\nThe school director had called Teacher Cao and learned from him that there was a female student who hoped to challenge the height of 180. He excitedly told the principal, \u201cSo far, the highest record of high jump for high school students in our province is 176. That student comes from No. 3 High School. It\u2019s been there for eight years!\u201d\nIn other words, if Su Miaomiao could jump 180, she would set a new high jump record for female high school students in that province.\n\u201cPrincipal, should we go over and have a look?\u201d\nThe principal was a little worried that too many people would put pressure on Su Miaomiao, but looking at the heads around the high jump field, Su Miaomiao probably couldn\u2019t notice them in the crowd.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look.\u201d\nAfter receiving the notice from the director, Teacher Cao asked Su Miaomiao to rest for a while to adjust her state.\nThe sports committee member of Class 9 held water in one hand and dried fish snacks in the other, guarding Su Miaomiao like an eunuch next to the Empress Dowager Cixi.\nBefore that day, the sports committee member only regarded Su Miaomiao as the school flower, but she was now the number one Goddess in his heart.\nSu Miaomiao took a sip of water and ate a mouthful of dried fish, her eyes still fixed on the tall horizontal bar.\nXie Jingyuan came over and said in a low voice, \u201cTake a rest after jumping this time.\u201d\nWith her current height, successfully jumping 180 was considered a top talent, and no matter how tall she was, she should not do something impossible.\nSu Miaomiao nodded, she was a little tired, she wouldn\u2019t jump more even if Xie Jingyuan told her.\nWang Min stood diagonally opposite, looking at Su Miaomiao who seemed to be shining in the crowd, and seeing the staff of the school\u2019s publicity office closely pointing the camera at her, she was very jealous, so jealous that her heart was on fire. But in the face of the disparity in strength, there was nothing to do. In sports competitions, it was difficult to cheat. That was just a sports meeting of No. 1 High School, Su Miaomiao had no need to engage in other things.\nBesides, without certain strength, ordinary people couldn\u2019t jump so high even if they drank stimulants like water.\nSu Miaomiao had enough rest and walked to the run-up area under the attention of everyone.\nShe had been a cat for more than a hundred years, and knew the jumping technique better than anyone else. Even if she became a human, Su Miaomiao could skillfully integrate that technique with her body.\nRun up, take off, volley.\nHer head, shoulders, and waist flew over the bar smoothly, and her slender and beautiful calves adjusted their posture in time to cross the bar perfectly.\nThe students watching applauded fiercely.\nGu Jialing also felt excited for no reason, obviously that kind of height was nothing in his eyes.\nHe secretly glanced at Xie Jingyuan, and saw that he still had that cold and refined expression.\nGu Jialing admired him very much, he was indeed a Taoist master, who could stay away from worldly illusions.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s jump made her famous in the whole No. 1 High School.\nSchool girl-level beauty, in top ten grades, and genius-like sportsmanship, let alone the province, there were not a few such talents in the whole country.\nSu Miaomiao, who returned to the seating area of \u200b\u200bClass 9, was warmly welcomed by the students.\nFeng Xiaoyu and the others also followed.\nCheng Yue was already surfing the forum of the school. The most popular post was about Su Miaomiao. Someone uploaded a picture of her winning the 100-meter final, and someone uploaded that she was far ahead in the 400-meter race. No matter which one, even if it was a blurry one, one could still see Su Miaomiao\u2019s stunning beauty and high spirits.\n\u201cMiaomiao, if I were a boy, I would definitely love you to death!\u201d Cheng Yue hugged Su Miaomiao\u2019s arm and rubbed it back and forth, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I realize that you were so powerful before?!\u201d\nSports committee member: \u201cBecause Miaomiao never met me, the bole (tree trunk, main part of something) before!\u201d\nGu Jialing sneered: \u201cWhat kind of bole are you?\u201d\nThe real bole was the Taoist master, okay?\nNo, there was no bole at all, Su Miaomiao was just a little wild cat, what was so great about a cat jumping high?!\n\u201cMiaomiao, you are my own sister, I will follow you from now on!\u201d Song Yang and a few special students also came over, and they called Xie Jingyuan and the others familiarly as brother, and Su Miaomiao as sister.\nWitnessing Su Miaomiao\u2019s strength with his own eyes, Song Yang no longer dared to treat her as a good school belle.\nIn his heart, and even in the hearts of all the boys in No. 1 High School, Su Miaomiao had risen to the height of a Goddess, which was beyond reach.\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cWho\u2019s the sister? Our Miaomiao is a flower. She seems to be several years older when you call her that.\u201d\nSong Yang peeked at Xie Jingyuan, he didn\u2019t dare to call her sister.\nUntil the sports meeting was announced to be over, Su Miaomiao was still surrounded by many people, clamoring to follow Qingxu\u2019s four-member group to the cafeteria.\nWhile the students were still eating, Chen Zhixing, the coach of the provincial team\u2019s track and field team, contacted No. 1 High School and said that he would like to visit No. 1 High School\u2019s sports meeting the next day.\nThe school naturally welcomed him.\nChen Zhixing specifically asked about the situation of the four-member group, because the four showed extraordinary talent in the competition.\nKnowing that the four of them turned out to be top students at the school, Chen Zhixing was a little worried. He was afraid that the students would not want to join the provincial team and develop in the direction of sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "71": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-71/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school leader asked the head teacher of Class 9 to talk to Su Miaomiao and the others, so that the children could first understand the fact that the provincial team intended to recruit them.\nThe three demons all looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nThe class teacher also looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan looked calm, \u201cWe will consider it, and we will also consult with our family.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, you four are very good. Anyway, the teacher believes that you can lead in any sector.\u201d\nAfter leaving the classroom, Gu Jialing asked Xie Jingyuan in surprise, \u201cTaoist Master, do you really want to develop in the sports field?\u201d\nHe thought that Xie Jingyuan would directly refuse.\nXie Jingyuan led the three of them to the side, and first expressed his opinion, \u201cI will not join the provincial team, including the national team. What do you think?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cI won\u2019t join, I want to learn business.\u201d\nWith such a large property in the Taoist master\u2019s family, he may not be able to handle it alone. Only by learning business management could he help the Taoist master share his worries in the future.\nGu Jialing: \u201cI don\u2019t even want to join, I want to open a resort after graduation.\u201d\nHe liked places with beautiful scenery. With just planting trees and raising birds, he would be happy and at ease.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI\u2019m not joining either, the training is very hard.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her and said, \u201cActually, you can join. If you don\u2019t like training, you can discuss conditions with them, and they should agree.\u201d\nThe three demons had become human beings, they should adapt to human society to have their own jobs.\nXu Shou least needed him to worry. Gu Jialing\u2019s family had a mine, so he should be able to support him to run the resort well. Only Su Miaomiao, who was prone to sleepiness, may not be able to accept the usual nine-to-five job. Her appearance was suitable for development in the entertainment industry, but the actors worked equally hard, and she may not be able to comprehend the deep emotions required by each role.\nWork in the entertainment industry was not suitable for her, and complicated interpersonal relationships were not suitable for her, so Xie Jingyuan was not at ease.\nBoth Xie Jingyuan and the Su family were capable of providing Su Miaomiao with a comfortable life, even if she wanted to sleep at home every day, she also had the privilege. But Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want her to waste her life in that way, she could obviously live a more fulfilling life.\nShe liked sports, and short-term competitions were a good fit for her.\nXie Jingyuan turned on his phone and searched for medals and trophies from various international competitions.\nThe champion\u2019s medal was shining gold, the second place\u2019s medal was shining silver, and the third place\u2019s bronze medal was also glowing with a low-key and calm luster.\nSu Miaomiao was very moved.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThe prize money in international competitions is also very impressive. You only need to jump or play ball, and if you win, you can get a huge prize money, and then use the prize money to buy jewelry and diamonds.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled, \u201cOkay, as long as they don\u2019t force me to train every day, I will agree to them.\u201d\nBack home at night, Xie Jingyuan went to 1001 with Su Miaomiao to report to Su Mingan and his wife about the school sports meeting.\nKnowing that the provincial team might recruit his daughter, but she didn\u2019t want to train, Su Mingan said in doubt, \u201cCan they agree?\u201d\nProvincial teams and national teams must have particularly strict management.\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cIf they don\u2019t agree, I won\u2019t help them compete. Anyway, I can still go to university.\u201d\nTang Shiwei tentatively asked, \u201cWhat major do you want to study, and what kind of job do you want to find after graduation?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao frowned when she heard that.\nThe elders around her, Su Mingan was busy, Tang Shiwei was even busier, and Xie Rong was so busy that they didn\u2019t see each other for a month.\nTang Shiwei looked at her husband.\nSo far, competing as an athlete was the only employment option her daughter really enjoyed.\nSu Mingan: \u201cOkay, as long as the provincial team agrees to Miaomiao\u2019s conditions, we will all support it. The question is, what will Miaomiao pick when she enters the provincial team?\u201d\nHis daughter was a sports genius, she won first place in all four events!\nXie Jingyuan had already analyzed it for Su Miaomiao, \u201cMiaomiao is not good at long-distance running, and short-sprinting is all about explosive power. Even if she runs 100 meters, she will be tired. It is better to choose high jump. In addition, Miaomiao likes to play tennis, and she can also sign up for the tennis team, and only play individual singles.\u201d\nDoubles required the cooperation of teammates, and no one was willing to form a team with Su Miaomiao.\nThe most important thing was that tennis had four major international competitions with huge prize money.\nSu Mingan nodded, \u201cTennis is good. Last time we played tennis together, I also said that if Miaomiao is willing to train, she will definitely win a Grand Slam in the future.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhat is a Grand Slam?\u201d\nSu Mingan happily told his daughter the popular knowledge. When Su Miaomiao heard that the prize was so high, she showed a determined smile to win.\nXie Jingyuan poured cold water on her in time, \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate professional tennis players. Those who can reach the finals of the four major tournaments are top talents. If you don\u2019t train hard, you may not even make it to the qualifying rounds.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cThat\u2019s right, don\u2019t think too high, be down-to-earth.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cThen shall we buy a villa, and build a training ground for Miaomiao, with tennis and high jump?\u201d\nThe Su family had long been able to buy a villa, but there were only three people in the family, so there was no need. It was better to live in the urban high-rise for convenience.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cLet\u2019s wait until Miaomiao enters the provincial team.\u201d\nThose were things for them to consider. Su Miaomiao was hungry and asked Xie Jingyuan to go to the kitchen to bring her supper.\nTang Shiwei patted her daughter, \u201cDon\u2019t order Jing Yuan around, you\u2019re too lazy.\u201d\nWith that said, she directed Su Mingan to the kitchen.\nSu Mingan looked at Xie Jingyuan again, feeling inexplicably sympathetic for the person in a similar situation.\nThat weekend after the No. 1 High School sports meeting, the provincial team coach Chen Zhixing officially visited the Su family to discuss with Su Mingan and his wife about recruiting Su Miaomiao into the provincial team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "72": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-72/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChen Zhixing did a test for Su Miaomiao, and she could jump to 184, and it would not work any higher.\nThat was a very strong talent, but in the past few years, there had been a few domestic high school students who had been able to jump 180, and it was even more common abroad.\nChen Zhixing very much hoped that Su Miaomiao could enter the provincial team and receive professional high jump training.\nBut no matter what kind of conditions he threw, Su Miaomiao insisted on one thing, she could participate in the competition, but she was not willing to enter the provincial team training, that was the case in high school, university, and after graduation.\nChen Zhixing: \u201cYou are wasting your talent. If you don\u2019t keep training, your talent will lose to other athletes who are only slightly inferior to you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t mind.\nChen Zhixing left with regret.\nHowever, the provincial team cherished Su Miaomiao as a good seedling. After a long discussion, it was finally decided to let Su Miaomiao join the provincial team first. If Su Miaomiao could maintain a good ranking in the competition without training, then naturally it would be the best of both worlds. If Su Miaomiao gradually disappeared from the crowd, then the provincial team wouldn\u2019t pay attention to her anymore. Because the provincial team didn\u2019t invest any resources in Su Miaomiao, in the end it wouldn\u2019t be a waste of anything.\nAfter a good discussion, the matter was settled in that way.\nThe students in No. 1 High School discovered that Su Miaomiao had entered the provincial team, and thought she would leave No. 1 High School. Later, they found that she still appeared in the school as before, and gradually they stopped paying attention to the matter.\nBut those students didn\u2019t know that since the day Su Miaomiao became a member of the provincial team, Xie Jingyuan decided not to go to school by bicycle.\nAfter breakfast, Su Miaomiao carried her bag as usual and walked out of the house under the eyes of her parents.\nXie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing were already waiting for her in the corridor.\nSu Miaomiao habitually handed the bag to Xie Jingyuan. He also picked it up habitually.\nTaking the elevator downstairs, Su Miaomiao subconsciously stopped, waiting for Xie Jingyuan and the three to pick up the bicycles.\nBut those three guys didn\u2019t move at all. Gu Jialing even glared at her a little angrily.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t understand what happened.\nXie Jingyuan handed her the bag and explained, \u201cStarting today, unless it rains, we will run to school.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhy? I don\u2019t like running.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to the provincial team for training. You should at least strengthen your training in normal times.\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao heard that, she became unhappy, \u201cThen I won\u2019t go to the provincial team.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWon\u2019t go anymore? Don\u2019t you want future medals?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao bit her lip.\nXu Shou urged, \u201cRun, you are not running alone.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s complexion became even worse, obviously he could live in a big villa and have a car to pick him up, why did he continue to live a miserable life with the Taoist master?\nSeeing his dejected appearance, Xu Shou said with disgust, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to run, you can go for a ride. No one is forcing you.\u201d\nThe priest just wanted Gu Jialing to live there to prevent him from messing around with women.\u00a0\nGu Jialing snorted and turned his head aside.\nThe Taoist master was the most powerful, and he should have a backer for whatever would happen in the future with the Taoist master. Xu Shou\u2019s stupid and loyal head would never understand his foresight.\nSu Miaomiao saw that everyone was about to run away, so she agreed and took the bag and carried it on her back.\nThe four of them set off together, three straight boys of similar height, and a petite girl with them.\nSomeone ran at a constant speed, but the three demons quickly began chasing each other.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s talent was better than ordinary people, but she lost to Xu Shou and Gu Jialing\u2019s long legs. She simply stopped chasing and jogged side by side with Xie Jingyuan.\n\u201cBrother, are you so diligent?\u201d Song Yang chased up on a bicycle and asked in disbelief.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him lightly.\nSong Yang rode away with interest, and said to his followers, \u201cStarting tomorrow, we will also run to school. We can\u2019t lose, so we have to work hard.\u201d\nTheir goal was to become physical education teachers in the future, how could they not work so hard?\nAfter running into No. 1 High School, Xie Jingyuan handed over their bags to Xu Shou. He took Su Miaomiao to the playground and instructed her to practice high jump.\nSu Miaomiao liked to jump and didn\u2019t resist.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t let her jump casually, first taught her some high jump movement skills, and Su Miaomiao used the ones that were useful, and quickly forgot the ones she thought were useless.\nAfter a morning self-study session, the two returned to the classroom.\nSu Miaomiao fell asleep lying on the table.\nNot to mention the students around, the entire Class 9 kept quiet subconsciously, talking in low voices when they had anything to say.\nIn the evening, the first period of evening self-study was used for homework, and in the second period Xie Jingyuan called Su Miaomiao to play tennis on the school\u2019s tennis court.\nSu Miaomiao turned the racket, feeling a little disgusted with Xie Jingyuan\u2019s training plan, \u201cTaoist Master, are you underestimating me? I think I can beat them without training.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cCultivation only makes us possess the talents of top athletes. If you don\u2019t work hard, you won\u2019t even have the chance to compete with them.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao still didn\u2019t believe it.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cDon\u2019t mention the future, you should try to beat me first.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao still didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. She had played so many times with the Taoist master, and she knew his strength and speed very well. There was still a chance to win against the Taoist master.\nHowever, when Xie Jingyuan\u2019s first ball was served, Su Miaomiao caught up with it, but was almost knocked off by the force.\nHer palms were numb, she stared blankly at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan just smiled lightly.\nPlaying with her was of course different from training with her.\nSu Miaomiao was deeply stimulated by his smile. She no longer thought about other people, and no longer thought about those illusory competitions, she even forgot about the shiny medals, and started to fight Xie Jingyuan seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

On the way home, she didn\u2019t want to run anymore. She stretched out her hand to stop Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, carry me on your back.\u201d\nAt that time, a car drove by on the road, and the lights illuminated Su Miaomiao\u2019s face. She tilted her head and closed her eyes, pouting because she was unhappy.\nThe light flickered, and the surroundings returned to darkness.\nXie Jingyuan thought of her desperately chasing the ball, and said indulgently, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao laughed, ran over, and dexterously jumped onto his back.\nXie Jingyuan deliberately walked along the inside of the roadside trees, even the lights of the street lamps could not completely dispel the darkness there.\nSu Miaomiao tilted her head and saw that Xie Jingyuan\u2019s hair was also wet with sweat. She sniffed, but she didn\u2019t smell anything bad.\nHe was always clean and spotless.\n\u201cTaoist Master, it\u2019s tiring to be a human being.\u201d\nThinking of the training, Su Miaomiao sighed softly.\nXie Jingyuan looked ahead, \u201cReally?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYes, like when I was a cat, I ate and slept every day. No one asked me to wake up on time, and no one forced me to train.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, why do you demons still practice and transform into human forms?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao did not think deeply about that question.\nAt the very beginning, she got her spiritual wisdom, and suddenly she could absorb spiritual energy. After contacting more demons, Su Miaomiao found that if she didn\u2019t work hard, she would be bullied by them.\nXie Jingyuan thought that she was stumped by his question, so he asked another one, \u201cIf I have a way to let you go back to your previous life now, do you want to go back?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked, looked at him and asked, \u201cWill you go back?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while and said with a smile, \u201cI will go back if you go back, if you stay, then I will stay too.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan paused.\nBefore he could have more emotions, Su Miaomiao said, \u201cWell, I definitely want to stay. Mom, dad, and grandma are so kind to me. In the previous life, we were too poor to have such snacks, and we didn\u2019t have so much delicious food, tennis, and movies, even though some movies aren\u2019t good at all\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan just listened to her talking here and there, sometimes praising the goodness of that world, and sometimes complaining about her dissatisfaction, such as going to school too early.\nWhen she had said enough, Xie Jingyuan finally asked, \u201cDo you still like being a human being?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao quietly lay on his shoulder, and nodded after a while, \u201cI like it.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said softly, \u201cThen be a good person.\u201d\nSome Taoist Masters couldn\u2019t tolerate any demons, he was not that kind.\nAs long as there was kindness, all living beings were equal.\nTen minutes later, Xie Jingyuan stopped in front of the elevator, ready to put Su Miaomiao down who was already asleep.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to move, her arms were hooked around his neck, and her legs were tight to him.\nXie Jingyuan said in a low voice, \u201cThere are surveillance cameras in the elevator.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? I haven\u2019t broken any law.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026We\u2019ll be home soon, do you want to have supper?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao swallowed her saliva and regained consciousness.\nXie Jingyuan said again, \u201cI can\u2019t carry you anymore.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao took a closer look and saw that his face was flushed from exhaustion, so she obediently jumped down.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the two elevators, both of which were still going up.\nHe tentatively asked, \u201cShall we take the stairs?\u201d Her training intensity could be strengthened.\nSu Miaomiao glared over immediately, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll just wait for the elevator.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan also gave up the idea.\nIt was better to take things step by step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Su Miaomiao wanted to surpass Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing wanted to catch up with her.\nSu Miaomiai was ambitious but didn\u2019t put in more effort. Gu Jialing had been diligent recently and stopped playing games after returning home.\nXie Jingyuan was very supportive of Gu Jialing\u2019s self-motivation, and it was better to solve problems than to provoke his female classmates.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said, leading the two of them up.\nWhen they just arrived on the second floor, Gu Jialing came out of Class 9, humming a song, it could be seen that he was in a good mood.\nSeeing the three of them, Gu Jialing first smiled, and then said nonchalantly, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to leave first?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThe Taoist master is afraid that you will be taken away by crows again.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s face changed drastically, and he rushed over to hit Su Miaomiao, but when she took the initiative to meet his fist, Gu Jialing hid aside.\nOn the way home, the four of them divided into two groups and kept a certain distance and ran at a constant speed.\nIt was officially winter, and the weather was getting colder. Outside the community of Pearl Garden, an old man set up a stall of roasted sweet potatoes, and the wind blew the sweet smell of roasted sweet potatoes far away.\nSu Miaomiao was the first to run toward the stall, and Xie Jingyuan and the others followed.\nIn the end, Xie Jingyuan bought ten large roasted sweet potatoes, and handed three to Su Miaomiao to take back home.\n\u201cHey, Miaomiao bought it too, and I bought two when I came back.\u201d\nSeeing his daughter come in with a bag of roasted sweet potatoes, Su Mingan said with a smile.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cEat the rest tomorrow morning.\u201d\nAfter eating sweet roasted potatoes, Su Miaomiao took a shower and went to bed.\nTang Shiwei listened to the movement in her daughter\u2019s room outside, and quietly said to Su Mingan, \u201cThe mid-term exams are coming soon. I heard from Grandma Tao that Xu Shou and Gu Jialing have been working hard recently. Miaomiao doesn\u2019t seem to be worried at all.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cWhich exam did Miaomiao ever get worried about? Besides, our Miaomiao is training every day now. After playing tennis, she must be very tired. If she had to stay up late to read, I couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d\nTang Shiwei nodded, her daughter\u2019s body was the most important thing, there was no need to put too much pressure on her.\nAt six o\u2019clock in the morning, Su Miaomiao was woken up by the alarm clock.\nAlthough she was a snooze sleeper, she had developed the habit of getting up early and going to bed late after the first year of high school, so she didn\u2019t resist too much.\nAfter a while, Su Miaomiao sat up.\nAt that time, she felt that something was wrong with her body. She lifted the quilt and saw that there were some blood stains on the pajamas and sheets.\nSu Miaomiao looked at the blood, and slowly remembered what her mother said.\nWhen she was in the sixth grade, her mother gave her knowledge about girls\u2019 physiology, and she would talk about it once or twice a year.\nSu Miaomiao felt that her mother seemed to be a little worried about her in the past two years, as if it was a very important matter, and if it didn\u2019t come, it meant something was wrong with her health.\nSo it was alright, her mom could finally rest assured.\nSu Miaomiao took a quick shower, clumsily used the sanitary pads that her mother had put in her drawer, and put the stained clothes and sheets into the washing machine.\nSu Mingan was making breakfast in the kitchen. Tang Shiwei\u2019s eyes lit up when she noticed her daughter\u2019s behavior, and asked quietly, \u201cYou got your period?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded with a smile, as if she had scored 100 points in the exam.\nTang Shiwei hugged her daughter, the stone that had been pressing on her heart could finally be removed.\nShe and many of her friends had periods around the age of thirteen. Although she checked the information which said that the age of twelve to sixteen was within the normal range, as a mother, she still couldn\u2019t help worrying.\nAfter being relieved, Tang Shiwei took her daughter to the room and had a private conversation between mother and daughter, such as reminding her daughter what to pay attention to during the period, and instructing her on the correct use of sanitary pads. It had been a long time since they talked about that the previous time, and she was afraid that her daughter would forget.\n\u201cMom, should I tell the Taoist master?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao felt that it was something to be proud of, otherwise why would her mother look forward to it so much?\nShe always called Xie Jingyuan \u2018Taoist Master\u2018 and the elders were used to it. Fortunately, Xie Jingyuan did have a \u201cTaoist\u201d temper, so everyone didn\u2019t think it was strange.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell him, this is a secret among girls. Of course, if they find out by themselves, you don\u2019t have to feel embarrassed,\u201d Tang Shiwei said gently.\nSu Miaomiao understood.\nTang Shiwei just bought two small hand warmers, put one in her daughter\u2019s bag, poured some brown sugar cubes out of an empty small tea pot, and told her daughter to make brown sugar water to drink if her stomach hurt.\nSu Miaomiao especially liked such a gentle mother.\nAfter breakfast, she went out with her bag on her back.\nThe three including Xie Jingyuan were already waiting outside.\nAfter entering the elevator, Xu Shou sniffed first, and almost at the same time, Gu Jialing also sniffed vigorously.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the two of them. Knowing that they both retained the sense of smell of demons, they must have smelled something unusual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He didn\u2019t want to expose a girl\u2019s secret.\nXu Shou had an extremely embarrassing experience in the matter.\nThat was still in his previous life, he was still a dog who had just learned to cultivate but could not change form. Once he ran into a girl who was beaten by a drunkard.\nXu Shou bit the drunkard, went to see the girl again. He smelled a faint smell of blood on her body, but the girl still looked like she was not seriously injured, so Xu Shou grabbed the girl\u2019s clothes and forcefully took her to the medical clinic in the town. The medical center took the girl\u2019s pulse and said that she was weak due to menstruation and that she should not work hard those days.\u00a0\nXu Shou understood what was menstruation cycle then\nSu Miaomiao originally wanted to stare at Xu Shou, but seeing him like that, she withdrew her gaze.\nFor the first time, Xie Jingyuan was baffled by those three demons.\nWhen they got downstairs, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing ran out first, leaving Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan some distance away.\nGu Jialing asked Xu Shou: \u201cWhen did you understand the situation of human women?\u201d\nXu Shou thought for a while and said simply, \u201cMore than one hundred and fifty years ago.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cIt\u2019s so early, it\u2019s amazing. I found out when I was in the temple. A female pilgrim\u2019s clothes were stained with blood, so I wondered what was going on, and flew over to peep\u2026\u201d\nBefore he finished speaking, Xu Shou suddenly rushed over, held him down and beat him.\nGu Jialing hugged his head and screamed, \u201cI haven\u2019t finished talking yet. I didn\u2019t see anything!\u201d\nXu Shou couldn\u2019t miss it, even if Gu Jialing was only in the form of a bird at the time, he shouldn\u2019t take advantage of that woman.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Xie Jingyuan ran over and asked.\nXu Shou stared at Gu Jialing coldly.\nGu Jialing knew he was wrong. The big black dog had such a sense of justice, and the Taoist master knew about it, so he didn\u2019t burn him to serve the cat as roast chicken.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I stole his chocolate, I accept the punishment,\u201d Gu Jialing quickly ran away with Xu Shou.\nXie Jingyuan frowned.\nSu Miaomiao fanned the flames from the side, \u201cHe steals things, Taoist master, you should punish him.\u201d\nThe stinky bird always said that she had a criminal record, and that she was not a good person who obeyed the law.\nXie Jingyuan suspected that they were hiding something from him, but he just couldn\u2019t find a clue.\nXie Jingyuan continued to accompany Su Miaomiao to practice high jump while the other students went to self-study in the morning.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t feel much during the practice, but when she finished jumping and went to the teaching building, she felt uncomfortable in her stomach.\nSitting on the seat, Su Miaomiao originally wanted to sleep, but the slight discomfort made her inexplicably irritable.\nShe remembered the two solutions her mother had provided, and first took out the small hand warmer and handed it to Xie Jingyuan, asking him to find a place to charge it for her.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan came back, she pushed the brown sugar box and the water cup over, and said habitually, \u201cTaoist Master, help me make a cup of brown sugar water.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWhy are you drinking brown sugar water?\u201d\nShe had tooth decay when she was a child, and when she went to the hospital for treatment, she cried so much that the doctor almost went deaf.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI just want to drink it.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her paler than usual face, silently picked up the water glass and brown sugar.\nAfter drinking it, Su Miaomiao really felt much better. Unfortunately, the first class had already started, so there was no time for her to sleep.\nAfter class, Su Miaomiao thought for a while, opened her bag, secretly took out a pad, and quickly stuffed it into her pocket.\nXie Jingyuan observed her secretly because she slept on the table. Then he caught her small movements.\n\u201cGet up, I want to go out,\u201d Su Miaomiao said to him.\nXie Jingyuan stood aside stiffly.\nSu Miaomiao swaggered away.\u00a0\nYu Le happened to be going to the bathroom, so she took the initiative to come over and walked out of the classroom talking and laughing with Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like to talk to people, but if someone took the initiative to approach her, and was pleasing to the eye, she would not chase them away.\nXie Jingyuan sat back on the chair.\nIn his previous life, he entered the temple at the age of ten and dealt with Taoist Masters or demons every day. He had no experience with female relatives at all. As for the pilgrims who came to the temple, there was basically no distinction between men and women in his eyes. He only listened to the pilgrims\u2019 requests and tried to solve their problems. It didn\u2019t matter if the pilgrims were male or female.\nAfter reincarnation, because of going to school, there were inevitably many female classmates around.\nXie Jingyuan had read many and miscellaneous books, and he had long known the phenomena of normal growth and development of young men and women.\nWhen he was in junior high school, a female classmate accidentally dropped a sanitary pad on the floor, causing some rude boys to whisper.\nBut because Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t do anything special all that time, Xie Jingyuan almost forgot that she would gradually fade away from the youthfulness of her childhood just like a normal girl.\n\u201cMonitor, can you help me with the question?\u201d\nIt was rare that Su Miaomiao, the Goddess of sleep, was not around, and the male student at the front desk turned around holding the exercise book as if racing against the clock.\nXie Jingyuan first helped him with the question.\nAfter helping three students in a row, a familiar figure appeared at the door of the classroom. Xie Jingyuan looked up and saw Su Miaomiao and Yu Le walking in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Seeing Gu Jialing solving a test paper, Su Miaomiao\u2019s heart moved, and she suggested, \u201cHow about we bet on the midterm exam results?\u201d\nGu Jialing looked over suspiciously, \u201cWhat will you be betting on?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled and touched her ears.\nGu Jialing rolled his eyes. His study foundation was not as good as Su Miaomiao, and he was just trying to catch up, so he had little hope.\n\u201cI\u2019m not betting.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao snorted in disappointment, and when she turned her head, she met Xie Jingyuan\u2019s handsome face, and in the next second, he was looking at the blackboard.\nSince the morning class, Su Miaomiao had been a little lazy, unable to do anything.\nEven if she noticed that a student in the middle row secretly ate some snacks, she was not interested in finding out whether the snacks were delicious.\nShe still listened carefully to the teacher\u2019s lectures, and she usually sat upright, but that day she couldn\u2019t help leaning against the wall next to her, and her eyelids were fighting to shut down.\nShe actually fell asleep.\nNormally, Xie Jingyuan would definitely wake her up, but that day he just glanced at her and acted as if nothing happened.\nGu Jialing understood the special physiological phenomenon of girls, but he did not understand that this phenomenon would also cause some negative physical reactions.\nThinking that Su Miaomiao was slacking off to sleep, Gu Jialing kicked Su Miaomiao\u2019s leg under the bench.\nThe first kick was not heavy, Su Miaomiao only moved her eyelashes.\nGu Jialing wanted to kick her a second time, but Xie Jingyuan looked over coldly.\nHe shrank his head, and waited for Xie Jingyuan to turn around, then he poked Xu Shou\u2019s arm with a pen cap, and motioned him to look at Su Miaomiao.\nWasn\u2019t he a disciplinary committee member? Shouldn\u2019t Xu Shou care about students sleeping late in class?\nXu Shou had seen Su Miaomiao fall asleep in the early morning, and the Taoist master didn\u2019t care. Therefore, Xu Shou also glared at Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt was unreasonable. The Taoist master was partial to the cat, even the dog had changed! Apart from the fact that cats had more fur, what did they have that was better than birds? In terms of round heads, birds had round heads too!\nIn the evening during self-study, Su Miaomiao fell asleep, and Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t wake her up during class.\nGu Jialing: \u201cTaoist Master, aren\u2019t you going to play tennis now?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYes.\u201d\nHe looked at Su Miaomiao suspiciously.\nSeeing that he was being dumb, Xu Shou took him out and explained briefly.\nGu Jialing suddenly realized the reason, and then showed a very envious expression, \u201cIf only I had those few days, you all would have to take care of me.\u201d\nXu Shou said coldly, \u201cIt would hurt, and the degree of pain varies from person to person.\u201d\nPain?\nGu Jialing shuddered. He was most afraid of pain.\nWhen the two returned to the classroom, Jia Ling concentrated on doing the questions and did not question Su Miaomiao\u2019s special treatment.\nAfter eight o\u2019clock, the evening self-study ended, and the students packed their bags and left the classroom one after another. Gu Jialing saw that Xie Jingyuan was still working on a paper, so he took the time to do another English question.\nAfter all the students had left and the corridor of the teaching building became quiet, Xie\nJingyuan packed his bag and woke Su Miaomiao up.\nThere were pressure marks on Su Miaomiao\u2019s fair face, she blinked blankly, not quite understanding the current situation.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao woke up a little bit, rubbed her eyes and said, \u201cNo playing?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThe exams are coming, we will resume training after the exams are over.\u201d\nThat was a very fitting reason.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t suspect anything at all, stood up lazily, and said softly, \u201cI\u2019m so sleepy, you carry me on your back.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t refuse either, and handed over their bags to Xu Shou.\nThe four of them were almost the last wave of students who left the school. When they walked out of the school gate, Gu Jialing was the first to recognize Tang Shiwei\u2019s car parked by the side of the road.\n\u201cHey, you finally came out, I was about to call you, what\u2019s wrong with Miaomiao?\u201d\nTang Shiwei pushed open the car door and walked over anxiously.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cShe\u2019s fine, she\u2019s just too sleepy to walk.\u201d\nTang Shiwei showed a dumbfounding expression, not only helpless at her daughter\u2019s laziness, but also glad that her daughter had such a considerate childhood sweetheart.\n\u201cLet\u2019s all get in the car.\u201d\nXu Shou, who was physically strong, consciously sat in the co-pilot seat. Xie Jingyuan still sat next to Su Miaomiao, fastened her seat belt for her, and let her lean on his shoulder.\nTang Shiwei silently looked at the rearview mirror, then looked at Gu Jialing and Xu Shou, and found that those two students seemed to be used to the kind of scene, and they did not show any abnormal emotions.\nThere was not much traffic on the road, Tang Shiwei smiled and joked with the two high school students while paying attention to the road conditions, \u201cXu Shou, Jialing, you two are so handsome, and you are both top students, is there any girl who wrote you a love letter? \u201c\nXu Shou immediately said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nGu Jialing smiled triumphantly: \u201cI had received a love letter in junior high school, but that girl is not good-looking, I don\u2019t like her.\u201d\nIn fact, the person who wrote the love letter was their junior high school belle at the time, but Gu Jialing\u2019s aesthetic was different from that of normal boys. If a girl had natural blue hair, he might look at her seriously.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cYou have such high vision, what kind of girl do you like?\u201d\nAfter careful consideration, Gu Jialing replied, \u201cWho can fly.\u201d\nTang Shiwei smiled, \u201cYou are so humorous.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Xu Shou, what do you like?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cI just want to study.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He was not interested in dating. He had been a dog for more than two hundred years. He just wants to follow the Taoist master for the rest of his life, and take care of his home for him.\nTang Shiwei felt that those two had quite personalities.\nThe car drove into the underground garage, and after it was parked, Su Miaomiao still didn\u2019t want to walk. Xie Jingyuan insisted on carrying her, or her mother could carry her.\nWhen Su Miaomiao acted like a baby when she was a child, Tang Shiwei must have agreed to her unconditionally. But when her daughter was as tall as her, she was a little powerless.\nXie Jingyuan automatically helped Su Miaomiao onto his back.\nTang Shiwei said comfortingly, \u201cYou are the only one who is willing to spoil her like this.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was afraid that she would misunderstand, so he explained, \u201cMiaomiao is my younger sister, and it is the elder brother\u2019s duty to take care of the younger sister.\u201d\nTang Shiwei said empathetically, \u201cYes, you two grew up together, you are closer than brothers and sisters.\u201d\nHe was a fool who pretended to be smart. He used that kind of excuse to fool them.\nThe love of the two, who thought it was perfectly hidden, in fact, the adults had already seen through it.\nThe next day, Xie Jingyuan rode his bicycle again and took Su Miaomiao to and from school.\nIn fact, apart from being lazy on the first day, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t feel anything unusual, she got used to playing tennis every day, and one day she took the initiative to drag Xie Jingyuan to the tennis court.\nOn Thursday, the mid-term exams of the last semester officially started. The freshmen were assigned to the exam rooms according to their ranking in the high school entrance examination. Each exam room also had sixty students.\nIn the four-person group from Qingxu Temple, except for Gu Jialing, the other three were in the examination room of Class 1.\nAt the time of admission, most of the top two hundred students were evenly distributed in Class 9 and Class 10. So half of the room of Class 1 was occupied by Class 9 and half by Class 10.\nSu Miaomiao was sitting in the last seat on the south side, next to Lin Xi.\nThe four-person group\u2019s good grades were because of their cleverness. Lin Xi was a real student who worked hard.\nAfter taking his seat, Lin Xi smiled at Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao felt as if she hadn\u2019t seen Lin Xi for a while. After observing, she found that Lin Xi had grown taller, with fair skin, delicate and handsome. At first glance, his temperament was still very similar to Xie Jingyuan, but Xie Jingyuan was so cold and refined, Lin Xi was just quiet and introverted, not like the indifference of an outsider who rejected others for thousands of miles. For example, Xie Jingyuan, even when he was willing to help others, his expression was cold.\n\u201cDid someone bully you in your class?\u201d What came to mind, Su Miaomiao asked proactively.\nIn her memory, in the group of six, the quiet Zhou Yao and Lin Xi had been bullied before, and it was she who stood up for them.\nA nearby girl from Class 10 was drinking water, and choked up when she heard the sentence.\nLin Xi was the top student in their class, the teachers liked him, the girls liked him, the boys admired him, how could he be bullied?\nLin Xi\u2019s fair face flushed slightly, and then he shook his head.\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cIf someone bullies you, tell me, and I will take care of them for you.\u201d\nThe girls in Class 10 looked at Su Miaomiao in surprise. Although Su Miaomiao was super good at sports, she was too good-looking, and she always followed Xie Jingyuan like a bird. So they never knew that Su Miaomiao was so domineering.\nLin Xi smiled and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nAt that time, he saw Xie Jingyuan sitting at the front looking back.\nLin Xi lowered his eyes to check the stationery.\nWhen the invigilator came in, the students consciously stopped talking.\nThe bell rang, and the invigilator began to distribute the test papers.\nLin Xi answered the question for a while, turned his head slightly to the left, and looked at Su Miaomiao.\nShe was sitting in the soft winter sun with a straight posture, lowering her head and answering the questions seriously.\nThat kind of Su Miaomiao looked like a normal good student.\nBut Lin Xi remembered Su Miaomiao in kindergarten and her in the first grade of elementary school. If Xie Jingyuan hadn\u2019t taken the trouble to correct Su Miaomiao, she might have become one of those girls who didn\u2019t like to study, and she would have never been admitted to No. 1 High School at all.\nIf Xie Jingyuan liked Su Miaomiao, who could compete with him?\nThe invigilator coughed suddenly, Lin Xi raised his head, and met the invigilator\u2019s stern gaze.\nHe stopped being distracted and focused on answering the questions.\nThe only thing he could do was to remain outstanding. Maybe one day, Xie Jingyuan would no longer like Su Miaomiao, or Su Miaomiao would not listen to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s words so much.\nThe two-day midterm exams were over, and it was the weekend again.\nOriginally, he was going to the stadium, but considering Su Miaomiao\u2019s health, Xie Jingyuan took the initiative to buy four movie tickets.\nGu Jialing: \u201cI\u2019m so touched, you didn\u2019t force me to do my homework today.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him.\nIn the cinema, there was a very popular movie playing, but Xie Jingyuan deliberately chose to watch it in the morning, when the movie theater didn\u2019t have too much traffic.\nSu Miaomiao dragged Xie Jingyuan to the ice cream counter.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cToday you can only eat popcorn, not ice cream.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cAuntie told me not to buy you ice cream recently.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao just remembered that her mother said that she should not eat cold food those days.\nIn the end, Gu Jialing and Su Miaomiao got a big bag of popcorn respectively, which Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou didn\u2019t like to eat.\nThe movie played for more than two hours.\nAt the end of the movie, Dobby the elf died in Harry Potter\u2019s arms.\nSu Miaomiao was expressionless, but she heard Gu Jialing crying, and when the lights came back on, she noticed that Xu Shou\u2019s eyes were also a little red.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey were too weak. If the Taoist master was there, he would have killed that demon.\u201d Su Miaomiao commented as she walked, \u201cAnd their wands are not as powerful as the Taoist master\u2019s sword.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s not the same as in the East. Your brain is suitable for only watching Journey to the West.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cShe didn\u2019t even understand Journey to the West.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan walked beside her, smiling and put her empty popcorn bag into the trash can.\nSchool started on Monday, and at noon, the results of that midterm exams were going to come out.\nThe head teacher called Xie Jingyuan to the office and gave him two lists, one was the class ranking of Class 9, and the other was the grade ranking of the entire first year of high school.\nXie Jingyuan was the class monitor. Taking advantage of his position, he walked out of the office and stood in the corridor to look at the class ranking of Class 9 first.\nHe and Xu Shou were still first and second in the class, Su Miaomiao fell from third to sixth, and Gu Jialing rose from fifty-second to forty-third.\nXie Jingyuan frowned.\nClass 9 had a strong learning atmosphere. Because Su Miaomiao was doing self-study sessions and training, she couldn\u2019t do studies by herself when she got home at night. It was normal to be surpassed by other hard-working students, just like it was difficult for her to compete with professional athletes.\nPeople got what they paid for, there were no shortcuts.\nIf only considering the college entrance examination, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t have to worry about anything. With the sports awards, she would definitely be recommended to the top universities in China.\nHowever, she had a strong competitive spirit. Not only did she fail to catch up with Xu Shou, but she even fell down in the ranking. She must be unhappy.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the grade ranking again, where Su Miaomiao fell even more. Fortunately, she was still in the top 50 of their grade, and she would still be in the first examination room during the final exam.\nHolding those two lists, Xie Jingyuan returned to Class 9.\n\u201cMonitor, is this the grade ranking?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan posted the list on the bulletin board of the class, so that it was convenient for the students to check the results.\nIn a blink of an eye, the notice board was surrounded by students.\nGu Jialing stretched his neck and asked, \u201cMaster, where am I?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cForty-three.\u201d\nGu Jialing was as happy as a grasshopper, bouncing around and touching the ceiling with his palms a few times. Although this ranking still didn\u2019t satisfy him, his progress was good. If he kept working hard, he might be able to enter the top ten by the end of the term.\nXie Jingyuan then said to Xu Shou who was watching him silently, \u201cYou are still second in our class.\u201d\nXu Shou smiled.\nXie Jingyuan added, \u201cFifth in the whole grade.\u201d\nXu Shou\u2019s smile froze immediately. He was third ranker when he entered school. How did he fall two places?\nAt that time, Su Miaomiao also woke up and looked up at them.\nXie Jingyuan taught the three demons a lesson together, \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the diligence and talent of other students.\u201d\nThe students recruited by the No. 1 High School were originally the best students in the urban area.\nThe students in elementary school and junior high school were more playful and lacked self-discipline, so it was easy for them to show their excellence.\nHigh school was different, especially the top students in Class 9 and Class 10.\nXu Shou was taught humbly, and secretly decided to postpone his bedtime to eleven o\u2019clock at night.\nGu Jialing glanced at the other students, and felt the pressure of competition for the first time. If he was lazy, he might not be able to go to the same university as the Taoist master and the others.\n\u201cAnd me?\u201d Su Miaomiao finally understood what everyone was discussing, looked at Xie Jingyuan who was sitting down and asked.\nHe glanced at her and wrote down her rankings on the paper.\nGu Jialing came over to look at it, but Xie Jingyuan blocked it.\nGu Jialing gloated, \u201cSuch secrecy, she must have failed the exam.\u201d\nRealizing that she had fallen in the ranking, Su Miaomiao\u2019s face was already very ugly. Gu Jialing was still smiling, so Su Miaomiao jumped up and wanted to beat him up.\nGu Jialing took advantage of the fact that there was a desk beside her, and ran away all of a sudden.\nXie Jingyuan held Su Miaomiao\u2019s wrist, pulled her back to the chair, sat down, and said in a low voice, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do well in the exam this time, but you will catch up next time. In the three years of high school, the ranking cannot remain the same, and the ups and downs are normal.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao still stared at Gu Jialing in the distance.\nXie Jingyuan tried to ask, \u201cThen let\u2019s stop training, and continue to read books and do homework in the morning and evening, okay?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao finally shifted her gaze to his face, thinking about the high jump in the morning and tennis in the evening, everything was more interesting than doing the questions.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she pouted and refused.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her more gently.\nHe was very pleased that Su Miaomiao could stick to her interest and would not give up lightly because of a moment of fighting spirit.\nHer personality was too special. Xie Jingyuan thought that sports was the most suitable \u201cjob\u201d for her, but he hoped that Su Miaomiao herself would also like it, instead of simply accepting his arrangement.\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you study alone on the weekend.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded, but she was still unhappy. She stared at Gu Jialing and Xu Shou for a while.\nThat was a bit unreasonable, but Xie Jingyuan just thought that she still maintained a childlike heart.\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy you ice cream at noon,\u201d Xie Jingyuan promised.\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while and made a request, \u201cI want to eat two.\u201d\nOf course, Xie Jingyuan agreed.\nShe was very happy when there was ice cream to eat. In the afternoon, the physics teacher explained the test papers, and when she saw the questions she had done wrong, Su Miaomiao\u2019s mood fell again.\nShe was not happy, the worst one was Gu Jialing, he seemed to have everything wrong. Su Miaomiao would always find fault with him, but the Taoist master was still partial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Su Miaomiao went to the competition accompanied by her parents and Xie Jingyuan. She won the individual championship.\nThe organizer put on a golden medal for Su Miaomiao who looked at the medal and smiled.\nSu Mingan took a picture of her daughter\u2019s joyful expression.\nSeveral photos were developed, and one of them was given to Grandma Tao, which was proudly placed in the living room by her.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nOn the day it snowed in Anshi.\nIn the morning, it was just a small snowflake, but after the evening self-study, it had turned into heavy snow, and the wind was still blowing.\nSu Miaomiao wrapped her down jacket tightly around herself, and wore her hat tightly. She hugged Xie Jingyuan\u2019s waist while walking, and hid behind his back.\nHe was tall and perfectly shielded Su Miaomiao from the wind.\nGu Jialing also wanted to hide behind Xu Shou, but was thrown away by Xu Shou.\nGu Jialing complained while stomping and jumping, \u201cI just can\u2019t handle it, I really miss my feathers.\u201d\nHow could he keep warm without his century-old feathers?\nXu Shou touched his face that was about to be blown stiff by the wind, but agreed with Gu Jialing in his heart.\nWhen he was a demon, he was fearless of cold and heat.\nXie Jingyuan just smiled lightly.\nWhen he had cultivated, he no longer worried about severe cold and heat, but in the years before he entered the temple, Xie Jingyuan suffered from frostbite every winter.\nOrdinary people at that time could hardly even afford a thick cotton coat, not to mention all kinds of down jackets for modern people.\nThe four of them walked out of the school with their own thoughts.\nThe weather was bad, so Su Mingan drove to pick up the children, stood by the car and waved to them.\nSnowflakes fluttered chaotically with the wind in the halo of the street lamps, making it impossible to see Su Mingan\u2019s face clearly.\nSu Miaomiao was still hiding behind Xie Jingyuan, moving over step by step.\nSu Mingan stared at his daughter\u2019s hand tightly hugging Xie Jingyuan, his eyes changed, and finally he didn\u2019t care about Xie Jingyuan\u2019s role as a wall for his daughter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so cold, it\u2019s so cold!\u201d\nSitting in the car, Gu Jialing immediately hugged Xie Jingyuan, shaking and stamping his feet.\nBecause Su Miaomiao was stuffed with a big hand warmer by her father, she no longer competed with Gu Jialing for the master.\n\u201cHere, a cup of milk tea for each person!\u201d Su Mingan turned around and handed over the still slightly hot milk tea.\n\u201cYou are my real father!\u201d Gu Jialing held the milk tea and was so moved that he was about to cry.\nSu Mingan glanced at Xie Jingyuan quietly, the second child in his life who could call him dad was probably Xie Jingyuan.\n\u201cDrink, I\u2019ll see you off tomorrow morning,\u201d Su Mingan rubbed his hands and started the car. Because of the bad road conditions, he drove very slowly. At the same time, he took the opportunity to teach the children, \u201cThe road is slippery in rainy and snowy weather, we rather slow down and drive, than have an accident.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded solemnly.\nJust as Gu Jialing was about to respond, he suddenly sneezed loudly.\nSu Mingan: \u201cWhen you go home, cook some ginger soup, and wear more clothes inside. Don\u2019t think that you are young and don\u2019t take it seriously. You will feel uncomfortable when you get old.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at the cat\u2019s father\u2019s side face, and suddenly thought of the old man at home.\nHis parents left early in his life, and his grandma didn\u2019t survive when he got to elementary school. For many years, it was the old man who greeted and nagged him.\nSure enough, the cat was the luckiest, with the Taoists master who was partial, and parents who were always by her side.\nGu Jialing looked at Su Miaomiao with jealousy.\nSu Miaomiao held a hand warmer in one hand and milk tea in the other, drinking it comfortably.\nXie Jingyuan suddenly looked over.\nGu Jialing wanted to recognize Su Mingan as his father, and stared at Su Miaomiao. What did Gu Jialing mean?\nGu Jialing looked at him and said in a low voice, \u201cTaoist Master, when we die in this life, can you arrange for me to be reincarnated into a family with both parents?\u201d\nEver since reuniting with Xie Jingyuan, Gu Jialing had always believed that the reincarnation was because Xie Jingyuan did something to help them reincarnate.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t know how to respond.\nGu Jialing shook his head suddenly again, \u201cForget it, let me be a bird, I prefer to be a bird.\u201d\nIt was too miserable to be a human being, with a tuft of hair on the top of the head.\n\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d Su Mingan glanced back, very suspicious that Gu Jialing disliked him a lot, and a child of his age didn\u2019t know what to do.\nGu Jialing was quite clever, and sighed, \u201cI was saying that these down jackets are bad, they are not warm at all.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cNot warm? Where did you buy it from?\u201d\nGu Jialing told him about the brand.\nSu Mingan: \u201cIt is a famous brand. You must be afraid of the cold. It\u2019s okay. You tell me your height. Tomorrow I\u2019ll pick out Canada Goose for you. I heard that it is warm.\u201d\nWith a thought in his heart, Gu Jialing took out his phone and searched for \u201cCanada Goose\u201d.\nNo, it was made of one of the species of Canada goose.\nGu Jialing frowned, and put the phone in front of Xie Jingyuan, \u201cI think this bird\u2019s feathers are just ordinary, isn\u2019t it a gimmick?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was speechless.\nXu Shou turned around and said curiously, \u201cShow me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said suddenly, \u201cBird\u2019s feathers are not good, but cat\u2019s fur is the warmest.\u201d\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou both cast contemptuous looks.\nSu Miaomiao asked Xie Jingyuan to make a judgment, \u201cWhat do you think, Taoist master?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan, who was stared at by the three demons at the same time, was silent for a long time, and finally said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I only wear ordinary down jackets.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cIt\u2019s a pity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

On the table was a pot of Four Seasons Begonia (a flower) whose leaves were emerald green, and a few small flower buds had just grown in the middle.\nXie Jingyuan injected a bit of aura into the Four Seasons Begonia.\nUnless the flowers and trees were bred with wisdom, they would only absorb the basic nutrients in the air or soil, and couldn\u2019t absorb spiritual energy unless people help them.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan injected the spiritual energy, the leaves of the Four Seasons Begonia did not change much, but the small flower buds obviously grew up, and their color became redder.\nXie Jingyuan poured some water on them and opened the curtains.\nThe snow had stopped, and a thick layer had accumulated on the ground, reflecting the lights of the street lamps, making the sky look brighter than usual.\nXie Jingyuan went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast first, but before that, he went back to the room to wash up.\nWhen he came to the dining room, Grandma Tao was already cooking. Xu Shou scooped out the porridge and put it on the dining table. Gu Jialing woke up a little later and was still brushing his teeth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s snowing so thick outside, how will you go to school?\u201d Grandma Tao came out with two dishes and asked worriedly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWe\u2019ll run, it\u2019s not too cold, there is no wind.\u201d\nGu Jialing poked his head out from the bathroom, \u201cWon\u2019t Uncle Su drive us?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\nGu Jialing wailed, but didn\u2019t complain anymore.\nAfter eating, the three of them took their bags and waited for Su Miaomiao in the corridor.\nEveryone had reached a tacit agreement, three to five minutes later, Su Miaomiao came out, followed by Su Mingan who was putting on a coat.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cUncle, go to sleep for a while, we will run to school.\u201d\nSu Mingan let out an \u201cah\u201d and subconsciously said, \u201cIt\u2019s so cold now, it\u2019s best to take the car.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t mind, she was used to training every day.\nThe four children persuaded Su Mingan to go back, and they set off.\nAt 6:30 in the morning, many office workers were still sleeping, and the snow on both sides of the road had not melted much.\nSu Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan ran side by side, passing under a tree, Gu Jialing suddenly sprinted over, kicked the tree trunk, and ran away.\nThe snow on the branches fell rustlingly, even though Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan hid quickly, some snow got into her hair and neck, making her shrink from the cold.\nShe gave her bag to Xie Jingyuan, grabbed a handful of snow and went after Gu Jialing.\nThe morning exercise turned into a snowball fight, Gu Jialing took advantage of his long legs, threw several snowballs at her and ran away, making Su Miaomiao very angry.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Xu Shou.\nXu Shou caught up with Gu Jialing and dunked a ball of snow into his collar.\nThe bird dared to bully a girl because of the physical difference between men and women.\nGu Jialing\u2019s face was full of disbelief, \u201cYou help her no matter what?!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cIt\u2019s not helping her, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t like her.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao took the opportunity to catch up and stuffed another ball of snow.\nThe three demons ran and made noise, the snow was covered with their messy footprints everywhere. After they finished making trouble, the three demons stopped and waited for Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan saw that there was still some snow on Su Miaomiao\u2019s head, so he helped her dust it off casually.\nGu Jialing complained to him by pulling his collar, \u201cLook, Taoist master, my collar is wet!\u201d\nHe had some signs of a cold that morning, and it was really not good to wear wet clothes. Xie Jingyuan paused, and placed his palm on Gu Jialing\u2019s collar.\nGu Jialing felt a kind of comfort and heat from being roasted by fire in winter. When Xie Jingyuan withdrew his hand, he touched the collar again, and found that it was completely dry.\nGu Jialing was shocked. Xu Shou was stunned, and Su Miaomiao came over to check it with her own hand.\nIn the end, the three demons all stared at Xie Jingyuan. Xu Shou only had pure admiration, while Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing had a kind of envy or even jealousy.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you can\u2019t accumulate spiritual energy?\u201d Su Miaomiao was the first to pout, and Gu Jialing, who had been calling her names, was also standing beside her, looking at Xie Jingyuan resentfully.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt only recently achieved initial results, but it\u2019s limited, and it got drained after casting a small fire spell.\u201d\nIt was true that casting spells took far more aura than growing plants.\nBut Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing didn\u2019t believe it. One took Xie Jingyuan\u2019s left arm and the other took his right arm, hoping that he would teach them.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI can pass it on, but you should worship me as your master.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao and Gu Jialing said at the same time, \u201cI will worship you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cAs a disciple of Qingxu Temple, you should strictly abide by the precepts of Qingxu Temple. The most basic one is not to eat meat.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t want to hide it from you. With my qualifications, I have been meditating for thirteen years before I could condense this little aura in my body.\u201d\nGu Jialing rolled his eyes, and suddenly spat on Su Miaomiao\u2019s down jacket.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Gu Jialing wanted to run, but was held down by Xu Shou. Su Miaomiao started to scratch at him. If it wasn\u2019t for her nails not being as sharp as cat\u2019s claws, Gu Jialing\u2019s down jacket would have been scratched to pieces.\nGu Jialing shrank his head and dodged while shouting, \u201cListen to my explanation! I just wanted to see if the Taoist master had really used up his aura!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you spit on yourself?!\u201d\nGu Jialing said sadly and angrily, \u201cWill it work if I spit on myself? The Taoist master is biased toward you, and he may not be able to detect the spit on Xu Shou!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou\u2019re still quibbling! The Taoist master favors Xu Shou the most. You just can\u2019t beat him, so you\u2019re bullying me!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe Taoist master was indeed very kind to him, but was he really being partial to him?\nXie Jingyuan just took out a wet tissue from his bag, and lowered his head to help Su Miaomiao wipe the place where Gu Jialing spat on. Fortunately, it was only the outside of the down jacket, so it didn\u2019t soak the inside.\nKnowing that Su Miaomiao liked clean clothes, Xie Jingyuan used three wet tissues in a row.\nSu Miaomiao was still disgusted, and angrily took off her down jacket and threw it on Gu Jialing.\nXie Jingyuan hurriedly unbuttoned his jacket and wrapped her.\nWhen Xu Shou saw that, he immediately took off his jacket and wanted to put it on the Taoist master.\nSu Miaomiao stood in front of Xie Jingyuan and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want him to wear yours.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Taoist master smelled so good, she couldn\u2019t bear the smell of a dog on him.\nXu Shou\u2019s face darkened, \u201cThen what should I do, just let the Taoist master freeze?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, and took off Gu Jialing\u2019s jacket. She also liked the grassy smell of the bird.\nGu Jialing was trembling from the cold, \u201cWhat about me?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cI\u2019ve given you mine.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at the white down jacket in his hand. The white color was okay, but Su Miaomiao was only short, he was already 1.8 meters tall.\nXu Shou said in a cold voice, \u201cIt\u2019s your own fault, if you don\u2019t wear it, you can freeze.\u201d\nGu Jialing had no choice but to wear Su Miaomiao\u2019s jacket in the end. It didn\u2019t matter if it was tight, because the sleeves were short, his arms were exposed.\nThe four of them walked into No. 1 High School, and the students passing by were all staring at Gu Jialing. Seeing the messy short hair on Gu Jialing\u2019s head like a chicken coop, and then looking at his obviously ill-fitting down jacket, they couldn\u2019t help wondering if this student was sleepy when he went out, and wore his sister\u2019s clothes.\nIn Class 9, Gu Jialing was ridiculed by the students collectively.\nGu Jialing lay prone on the table, never wanting to see anyone again.\nThere were five study days a week, and Friday was the students\u2019 favorite day, especially that Friday was Christmas Eve.\nHigh school students didn\u2019t care about the specific origin of Christmas Eve and its profound meaning. The meaning of Christmas Eve to them was just a little romance, and it was a festival in which they could take the opportunity to express love to others.\nThere were two types of love, friendship and admiration.\nSu Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan went directly to the playground. Gu Jialing and Xu Shou walked into the classroom with their bags in their hands. From a distance, they could see red apples on their desks.\nGu Jialing narrowed his eyes.\nThere were three apples on Su Miaomiao\u2019s table, and the Taoist master had only one.\nThere were five on his desk, which seemed to be a lot, but why was Xu Shou\u2019s desk almost covered with red apples, and even a beautifully packaged bear toy?\nHe was a big dog, what would he do with the little bear?\nGu Jialing was very jealous, and he was so jealous that he deliberately bumped into Xu Shou\u2019s table when he came over.\nThe two red apples on the side shook and fell.\nXu Shou had quick eyesight and quick hands, and with a sweep of his slender and strong arms, he caught both apples.\nGu Jialing snorted, and without looking at his own apples, he casually took one from Xu Shou, tore off the pink note on it, and whispered, \u201cThank you for helping me fix my bicycle, merry Christmas.\u201d\nGu Jialing remembered that Xu Shou did help a girl repair her bicycle once after class at night, but he had already forgotten what that girl looked like.\nHe looked at the other red apples with notes, almost all of which were words of thanks.\nGu Jialing felt balanced, Xu Shou had done a good deed, and it was normal for the female students to give gifts to express their gratitude.\nXu Shou didn\u2019t need that kind of thanks.\nThe students who gave the gifts did not leave names, so Xu Shou sniffed them one by one, and decided to return all the apples after class, including the teddy bear.\nAfter the early self-study, Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan came back.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s red apples were all given by the female students in the class. Xie Jingyuan\u2019s only one was from Yu Le. The note was to wish him and Su Miaomiao peace and happiness. She also drew a playful winking expression .\nThe one that Yu Le gave to Su Miaomiao also had similar words.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t quite understand.\nXie Jingyuan tore the two pieces of paper expressionlessly. He didn\u2019t know what was going on in those kids\u2019 heads.\nThe class was lively.\nFeng Xiaoyu, Cheng Yue, and Zhou Yao all came to give Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan apples.\nXie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao to the school supermarket and bought a lot of apples as a gift in return.\nAt noon, they went to the cafeteria for dinner, and when they came back, there was another apple on Su Miaomiao\u2019s table.\nThe apple was from Lin Xi, and it simply wished her a merry Christmas.\nSu Miaomiao, who was taught by Xie Jingyuan to reciprocate courtesy. She took out an apple she bought from her desk and went to the next door to look for Lin Xi in Class 10.\nGu Jialing looked at her back and asked strangely, \u201cNo, Taoist Master, the six of you are good friends before, why Cheng Yue and the others also gave you apples, but Lin Xi only gave it to Su Miaomiao?\u201d\nXu Shou also pricked up his ears.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t know how to explain to them.\nLin Xi was a quiet boy, every time the group of six gathered, he was pulled over by Cheng Yue and the others, and Xie Jingyuan went to accompany Su Miaomiao.\nHe and Lin Xi rarely talked.\nThe girls were lively and enthusiastic and regarded him as a good friend, and Lin Xi knew in his heart that they were just ordinary classmates.\nIn Class 10, Lin Xi was helping a classmate, when suddenly a sweet and clear voice came from the door, \u201cLin Xi!\u201d\nLin Xi looked up and saw Su Miaomiao, she was wearing a new white down jacket, holding a red apple in her hand.\nShe smiled at him, her eyes were shining, clearer than the stream in the scenic spot.\nThere were whispers from some classmates around.\n\u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she Xie Jingyuan\u2019s girlfriend? How can she give Lin Xi an apple?\u201d\n\u201cHe has always been a good friend, don\u2019t think about it.\u201d\nLin Xi walked through the narrow aisle between the desks and came to the door.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cHere, I picked this one myself. It\u2019s red, big and round.\u201d\nLin Xi smiled and nodded.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\nLin Xi: \u201cOkay.\u201d\nHe knew that she must seize the time to sleep.\nWatching Su Miaomiao return to Class 9, Lin Xi slightly clenched the apple in his hand.\nThe one he gave Su Miaomiao was also the most beautiful one he had chosen out of thousands in the mall.\nDuring the day, apples were constantly being delivered, and the whole No. 1 High School was full of festive romantic atmosphere.\nAfter school, Gu Jialing suddenly remembered something and asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, you didn\u2019t even give us an apple.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIf I give you one, you will give me one as well, so why bother?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cThe meaning is different, it has a sense of ritual.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan shook his head, but after returning home, he went to the refrigerator to get three apples, and gave one to Gu Jialing and Xu Shou respectively.\nThen, he took the last apple and went out.\nHe looked at the apple in his hand, and silently injected a trace of spiritual energy into it.\nThe traces left by the natural growth on the surface of the apple disappeared quietly, and the skin became rosy and shiny, exuding a perfectly ripe sweet fruit aroma.\nThen, Xie Jingyuan sent a message to Su Miaomiao, asking her to come out to get the apple. If he knocked on the door, he might have to face Su Mingan and his wife.\nA minute later, after Su Miaomiao opened the door, Xie Jingyuan handed over the apple, \u201cHere, I gave the other two already.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOh, wait, I\u2019ll get you one too.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cNo need, go to bed early after eating.\u201d\nOn finishing speaking, Xie Jingyuan turned around and went back home.\nSu Miaomiao had already eaten two apples during the day, and she really didn\u2019t want to eat any more, so she casually put the apple on the side of the entrance cabinet.\nThe next day was Saturday, Su Miaomiao could sleep in until 8 o\u2019clock, and then get up to go to the stadium with Xie Jingyuan for training.\nTang Shiwei was going to work that day. When she saw the apple before leaving, she thought it was an ordinary apple her daughter brought back from school, so she put it in her bag and took it away.\nIn the hospital, Tang Shiwei slowly ate the apple while turning on the computer to check the medical records.\nShe herself didn\u2019t feel anything, but in the afternoon, several colleagues around her praised her for looking good.\nTang Shiwei looked in the mirror and found that her skin was indeed a little smoother, and even applying a mask did not have such a good effect.\nBut no matter how much Tang Shiwei thought about it, she wouldn\u2019t link the incident to that apple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But she promised not to speak out.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head.\nGu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan again, squinted his eyes and guessed, \u201cTell me, did the Taoist master meet some girl outside?\u201d\nXu Shou said coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t slander the Taoist master\u2019s innocence.\u201d\nGu Jialing was afraid of the loyal dog, thought for a while, and then asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cWhen we hadn\u2019t met, what gift did the priest give you at Christmas?\u201d\nThat was not a secret, so Su Miaomiao said casually, \u201cSometimes snacks, sometimes hair ties, and even chocolates.\u201d\nGu Jialing rubbed his chin. Those things were very cheap, but a few years ago, the Taoist master was also a child, and his pocket money was limited.\n\u201cWhat did he give you last year?\u201d Gu Jialing asked cleverly.\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to say something, Xu Shou suddenly reminded him, \u201cIf you tell him, he would ask for the same gift from the Taoist master.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao raised her hand and stroked Gu Jialing\u2019s hair.\nGu Jialing struggled to run away, \u201cIt must be very expensive! The Taoist master is biased and will give you good things. We will only get a casual meal.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThe meal in this restaurant costs a thousand.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cIsn\u2019t it more than a thousand? Don\u2019t you believe that the gift he gave her last year is worth tens of thousands?\u201d\nXu Shou paused for a moment, then looked at Su Miaomiao quietly. Even if the Taoist master really gave such an expensive gift, it must be the cat who was not sensible and took the initiative to ask the Taoist master for it.\nSu Miaomiao stared back at Xu Shou, \u201cIt\u2019s not tens of thousands. I picked the crystal ball myself. I saw it when the priest paid the bill. It was less than two hundred.\u201d\nXu Shou had seen the kind of Christmas crystal ball that could spray fake snowflakes and play music, and one could buy it for dozens of yuan.\nHe knew that the Taoist master would never indulge Su Miaomiao blindly.\n\u201cWhat are you arguing about again?\u201d Xie Jingyuan put away his phone and walked over, sensing that something was wrong with the atmosphere.\nGu Jialing hurriedly said, \u201cWe are trying to guess who called you.\u201d\nThere were only a handful of relatives and friends. He had seen the Taoist master answer Xie Rong\u2019s phone call, and he did that in front of them then. He wouldn\u2019t walk away on purpose.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Xu Shou.\nXu Shou: \u201cHe was guessing himself, slandering the Taoist master for having a woman outside.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes fell on Su Miaomiao\u2019s face.\nSu Miaomiao hurriedly clarified, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s mouth was so wide open that it could fit a tennis ball, so Xie Jingyuan had no choice but to explain, \u201cI wrote a book last year, and now a company wants to make it into a movie.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s shock quickly turned into another kind, and he rushed over excitedly, circling around Xie Jingyuan, \u201cWhat book? Will they pay you for making a movie? How much?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was also very excited, the Taoist master\u2019s money was Qingxu Temple\u2019s money. It was the money to support them. The more the Taoist master earned, the better their life would be!\nOnly Xu Shou, who was not moved by money, admired the Taoist master\u2019s talent.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWe\u2019re still talking.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cHow many do you think you will get?\u201d\nSeeing his greediness, Su Miaomiao was not pleased, jumped up and pulled Xie Jingyuan behind her, glared at Gu Jialing and said, \u201cHow much he gets has nothing to do with you. You obviously have a mine, why do you want to rob the Taoist master?\u201d\nShe was short, so Gu Jialing lowered his head and confronted her, \u201cThe mine is my family\u2019s, whatever Taoist master has is his, and I am also a demon of the Qingxu Temple. If the Taoist master raises you, he must raise me.\u201d\nXu Shou came over, grabbed one with each hand, and pulled the two away like chickens.\nXie Jingyuan was used to it, he just said, \u201cGo and change clothes, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\nOn the way, Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing were still fighting non-stop. For a while Su Miaomiao grabbed Gu Jialing with her hand, and for a while he stretched out his foot to kick her.\nSitting in the middle, Xie Jingyuan had to hold down Su Miaomiao\u2019s hand, and then step on Gu Jialing\u2019s foot.\nXu Shou looked at the taxi driver worriedly, afraid of revealing their identities.\nThe driver smiled.\u00a0 It was normal for high school students to be noisy.\nArriving at the mall, Gu Jialing found that there was a game room on the same floor. The lights inside were flickering, and it was fun to watch.\nHe looked at Xie Jingyuan eagerly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cAfter eating, you can play here for an hour.\u201d\nGu Jialing jumped up happily, but was glared at by Xu Shou because he jumped too high.\nAfter eating enough, the four of them went to the game room.\nXie Jingyuan applied for three cards, Gu Jialing took his and ran in. Xu Shou only at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s insistence went to find the games he was interested in.\nSu Miaomiao directly exchanged some game coins, and walked to the middle rows of claw machines.\nShe had come to that game city for the first time,\u00a0 so she kept looking around. Suddenly her eyes lit up, she pointed to Xie Jingyuan and said, \u201cTaoist Master, look quickly, doesn\u2019t this look like Xu Shou?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan had already seen it, the corner of his mouth slightly raised.\nThe doll inside resembled a police dog, with black fur on the back, top of the head, and nose, and brownish-yellow belly and limbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "83": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-83/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was indeed very similar to Xu Shou\u2019s original form.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI want to get it!\u201d\nIn her previous life, she couldn\u2019t beat the big black dog, but with it she could just scratch the head, and grab the dog\u2019s leg if she wanted to.\nXie Jingyuan saw her thoughts, smiled, and stood aside to watch her play.\nSu Miaomiao was good at batting the ball, but her ability to control the claw machine was only average, and she didn\u2019t seem to care whether she could catch it and enjoyed the game.\nXie Jingyuan scanned the other areas of the game city, but because the place was too big, he didn\u2019t find Xu Shou.\n\u201cAh, I got it!\u201d Su Miaomiao suddenly jumped up happily.\u00a0\nXie Jingyuan looked down, and there was indeed a black doll at the exit of the claw machine.\nSu Miaomiao took out the black doll and squeezed it from head to toe with both hands.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe snatched the black doll and said, \u201cSee if there is anything else you like.\u201d\nHe himself looked at other claw machines, and then saw the \u201cAngry Birds\u201d series, having a blue bird.\nSure enough, Su Miaomiao also noticed it. She thought that blue bird was ugly, with a fat body, two tufts of hair on the top of its head, and a big yellow nose.\nHowever, if she purposely said that it resembled Gu Jialing, he would definitely be pissed off, right?\nSu Miaomiao happily went to catch the fat blue bird.\nBecause the fat blue bird was a round ball, after Su Miaomiao caught it, she squeezed it a few times and gave it to Xie Jingyuan.\nThere were also many cat dolls there. Cats were one of the favorite pets of human beings. The dolls come in a variety of shapes, including domestic and foreign breeds.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like any of them, and continued to catch clownfish.\nShe only played catching dolls, and exchanged game currency four times in an hour.\nThe time limit given by Xie Jingyuan was about to expire, and Xu Shou came back first.\nSeeing the various dolls Xie Jingyuan held in his hands, especially the black dog, Xu Shou froze.\nSu Miaomiao grabbed the doll, pulled its ear and shook it at him, \u201cLook, doesn\u2019t this look like you?\u201d\nThe muscles on Xu Shou\u2019s face got tense, and there was a faint movement of gritting his teeth.\nSu Miaomiao quickly stuffed the dog to Xie Jingyuan, then pulled Xie Jingyuan to block herself, and picked another one.\nGu Jialing also came back, because he was in a good mood after playing the game, but the happy mood disappeared instantly when he saw that ugly blue bird doll.\n\u201cSu Miaomiao!\u201d Gu Jialing gritted his teeth.\nSeeing that Xie Jingyuan was standing firmly in front of her, Su Miaomiao was not afraid anymore.\nThat time, Xu Shou was on Gu Jialing\u2019s side. Naturally, he would not teach Su Miaomiao a lesson in front of the priest, but instead took Gu Jialing to exchange game coins.\nThe two caught a white cat doll respectively.\nThe white cat that Gu Jialing caught had a small head and a fat body, and its eyes were still squinted. It looked like a male rogue cat.\nThe white cat Xu Shou caught had long limbs, small black eyes, and a few black whiskers, revealing a yellowish belly.\nTwo handsome high school students with very different temperaments walked toward Su Miaomiao with a white cat doll each.\nThat scene attracted the attention of some girls.\nSu Miaomiao knew that Gu Jialing and Xu Shou were deliberately taking revenge on her. Anyway, the two white cats didn\u2019t look like her at all, so she didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cWhere will you place it?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked the two boys.\nGu Jialing: \u201cPut it on the toilet.\u201d\nNot to mention Su Miaomiao, Xie Jingyuan frowned and said coldly, \u201cNonsense.\u201d\nOnly then did Gu Jialing change his mind, and laughed, \u201cPut it on the bed, it\u2019s just right to warm my feet in winter.\u201d\nAs a result, he found that Xie Jingyuan\u2019s face was even uglier.\nXu Shou: \u201cSend it off.\u201d\nSuch ugly dolls could only play their true role if they were placed under Su Miaomiao\u2019s nose.\nUpon hearing that, Su Miaomiao snatched the two dolls and stuffed them into the corresponding claw machine outlets.\nBecause Xie Jingyuan was watching, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing didn\u2019t do anything else.\nThe four of them returned with a full load, and first went back to 1002 together.\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s amazing that you caught so many dolls,\u201d Grandma Tao smiled when she saw the pile of dolls the three boys held .\nSu Miaomiao deliberately took out the black dog and the blue bird, and sweetly said to Grandma Tao, \u201cThese two are for you.\u201d\nGrandma Tao took one in each hand, looked at them carefully, and commented, \u201cThis black one looks quite energetic, and this blue one is a little bird?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYes, I got it from another game called Angry Birds.\u201d\nGrandma Tao looked at the blue bird doll, and finally saw the shadow of the bird.\nAt that time, the real \u201cAngry Bird\u201d snorted coldly and went to his bedroom.\n\u201cI\u2019ll put it aside,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said. If those two dolls were placed in the living room, they would only be thrown into the trash can by Gu Jialing in the end.\nGrandma Tao smiled and handed it to her grandson.\nSu Miaomiao went home with the pile she really liked.\nXie Jingyuan came to the master bedroom with two dolls, thought about it, and put the dolls in the cloakroom.\nIn the storage compartment where he put the dolls, there was also a framed painting. In the painting, there was Qingxu Temple, a Taoist master meditating, and a cat lying on the roof basking in the sun.\nThat painting was created by five-year-old Su Miaomiao.\nAt that time, they were still in kindergarten. In the drawing class, the teacher encouraged the children to draw their favorite buildings.\nWhat Su Miaomiao drew was Qingxu Temple.\nOf course, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t have much talent for art, and she was even more naive when she was five years old. If she hadn\u2019t said that it was a temple, and that the thing painted in black shadow inside was a \u201cTaoist Master\u201d, the teacher would have found it impossible to see what she had drawn.\nSu Miaomiao was very satisfied with the painting and gave it to Xie Jingyuan as a Christmas gift that year.\nLooking at the \u201cself\u201d in the painting, Xie Jingyuan shook his head and closed the door of the storage compartment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The first and second year students wanted to take that opportunity to celebrate.\nThe literary and art committee encouraged everyone to present their own special programs, singing, dancing, playing musical instruments, etc.\nGu Jialing was very active, \u201cI want to sing!\u201d\nThe art committee member ran over happily, \u201cWhat do you want to sing?\u201d\nGu Jialing could sing so many songs.\nLooking at the small freckles on the face of the art committee member, Gu Jialing was about to speak when Xu Shou said quietly, \u201cYou are not allowed to sing Free Flying.\u201d\nRecently, Grandma Tao was rehearsing a new square dance, and sometimes she was humming while cooking. Gu Jialing learned it after listening to it a few times, so he went to their dance from time to time.\nNo matter how good the song was, Xu Shou couldn\u2019t bear to listen to it every day.\nGu Jialing closed his mouth, then opened it again, \u201cI\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou are not allowed to sing \u201cFlying Higher\u201d either.\u201d\nGu Jialing opened his mouth, his voice stuck in his throat.\nSu Miaomiao rubbed her eyes and raised her head. After understanding the situation, she glared at Gu Jialing and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t even sing little birds.\u201d\nGu Jialing tightly shut his mouth.\nThe literary and art committee laughed out loud, \u201cIt\u2019s all about flying.\u201d\nGu Jialing was stimulated by the sentence, and he jumped up, \u201cWhoever said that I can only sing flying songs, next time if you beg me to sing \u201cFlying Higher\u201d, I won\u2019t sing!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen what are you going to sing?\u201d\nGu Jialing thought about it for a minute, then hummed, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen Swordsman, I\u2019ll sing that theme song!\u201d\nIn elementary school, Gu Jialing was very obsessed with martial arts movies, and even studied whether the human beings in that world really knew how to do light work, so that he could fly after learning it.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he couldn\u2019t fly, primary school student Gu Jialing would wrap the sheets around his body, stand on the roof facing the wind, and enjoy the pleasure of flying while singing.\nOf course, he seldom finished singing a song smoothly, because before that, the old man would interrupt him cursing.\n\u201cA Laugh From the Sea\u201d?\u201d\n\u201cRight!\u201d\nThat song was very good, and the literary and art committee would add his program.\nGu Jialing looked at Su Miaomiao contemptuously, \u201cI sing, what talent do you have?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t stand his provocation, she showed off without thinking, \u201cI can play the guqin.\u201d\nThe art committee\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cOkay, okay, why don\u2019t you two cooperate? Gu Jialing can sing, and Su Miaomiao can play the guqin!\u201d\nA student next to them was also excited, and shouted to the whole class, \u201cSwordsman is a guqin and flute ensemble, is there anyone in our class who can play the bamboo flute?\u201d\nThe students looked at each other in blank dismay. Playing the guqin and guitar was common. Wasn\u2019t the bamboo flute a little unpopular?\nAt that time, Su Miaomiao suddenly remembered and asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cCan you, Taoist Master, play the flute?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked calmly, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI saw it in your room.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWhich room?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cJust\u2026\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t go on.\nAfter reincarnation, Xie Jingyuan had never played any musical instrument, she saw it in Qingxu Temple when she was a cat demon in her previous life.\nThat day she took advantage of the fact that Xie Jingyuan went out to catch demons, and the big black dog also went down the mountain to sneak into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room. She wanted to find out if the owner of Qingxu Temple had any treasures, but in the end there was nothing shiny. Instead, she found a bamboo flute in a cabinet.\nFacing Xie Jingyuan\u2019s see-through black eyes, Su Miaomiao lay down on the table to sleep again.\n\u201cMonitor, I\u2019ll add you too?\u201d The literary and art committee discussed with lack of confidence, \u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019ll make your show the finale of our New Year\u2019s Eve party!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was silent.\nThe literary and art committee member whispered, \u201cThe sports committee asked you to sign up for the sports meeting, and you agreed.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d\nBecause the four of them always act together, the art committee naturally turned to Xu Shou, \u201cXu Shou, do you know any musical instruments? Or do you want to sing with Gu Jialing?\u201d\nXu Shou couldn\u2019t sing, but for the musical instruments\u2026\n\u201cI can play the drums.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind? A drum set?\u201d\nXu Shou shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s just an ordinary red drum.\u201d\nIn the previous life, people would use gongs and drums for weddings and funerals, and there was a drummer in the village Xu Shou protected. The drummer was kind. His wife died and he had no children. He found that Xu Shou, a big black dog, seemed to have no decent place to live. He thought he was a stray dog, so he took Xu Shou home. Looking at him, he just provided Xu Shou with a place to live and prepared some food.\nAt that time, Xu Shou could transform into form, so of course he didn\u2019t need to eat whole grains, but he thought the drummer was pitiful, so he was willing to accompany the drummer when he was free.\nXu Shou had learned to play drums after being influenced for more than ten years.\nIt was just that human life was limited. After the drummer passed away, Xu Shou never heard the familiar drum sound again.\nThe literary and art committee saw a trace of sadness in Xu Shou\u2019s eyes, and the nostalgic expression made her want to pat Xu Shou\u2019s head inexplicably.\nFortunately, she held back, \u201cThen shall I add you?\u201d\nXu Shou was dispensable, he looked at the Taoist master.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan nodded, Xu Shou agreed.\nAfter the art committee member left, Gu Jialing looked at Su Miaomiao, and asked Xie Jingyuan suspiciously, \u201cMaster, can she really play the guqin?\u201d\nHe could imagine a cat playing tennis, but he couldn\u2019t imagine a cat playing a guqin.\nSu Miaomiao was not asleep, she had been eavesdropping, worried that the Taoist master would settle old accounts with her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She jumped up and held down Gu Jialing who was too late to hide, and rubbed his hair vigorously.\nGu Jialing shouted exaggeratedly for help.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao, she let him go.\nXie Jingyuan asked casually, \u201cDo you still remember how to play the guqin?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was still staring at Gu Jialing, and said casually, \u201cI remember, I studied for a month at that time.\u201d\nDidn\u2019t she want to speed up her cultivation in her previous life, so she went to the brothel at the suggestion of the old demon. She just wanted to catch a man quickly to absorb her vitality, but the brothel boss insisted that she be the number one card, and even arranged for her to learn to play the guqin, saying that she needed both face and art skills in order to attract more good men to bid. Su Miaomiao had to study patiently for a month, because at that time she had a lot of cultivation, she could learn everything quickly, and she was able to master it in just one month.\nThe skills learned were imprinted in the soul, so of course Su Miaomiao remembered them.\nAfter recalling, she belatedly understood what Xie Jingyuan meant.\nCould it be that when she played the guqin that night to show off her talent, the Taoist master had already been lurking near the brothel, so he knew she could play the guqin?\nIn other words, the Taoist master was settling old accounts with her again!\nThis person was too bad, he didn\u2019t have any strange expression, but was luring her to jump into the pit!\n\u201cGet up, I\u2019m going to the toilet.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her angry look, and silently moved out of the way.\nSu Miaomiao walked quickly and left the classroom in the blink of an eye.\nGu Jialing was still talking to himself, \u201cShe really knows how to play the guqin.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan just took out the textbook for the next class.\nTime passed quickly, the bell rang, and the math teacher came in, but Su Miaomiao hadn\u2019t come back yet.\nThe math teacher scanned the classroom, noticed that Su Miaomiao was not there, and looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan pointed in the direction of the toilet.\nThe math teacher understood that. In her heart, Su Miaomiao was smart and well-behaved, and would not skip class without reason.\nHowever, five minutes later, Su Miaomiao still did not come back.\nXie Jingyuan raised his hand, then walked to the front of the classroom, whispered something to the math teacher, and after getting permission, he also left the classroom.\nGu Jialing quietly said to Xu Shou, \u201cLooking at how much the Taoist master favors her, Su Miaomiao must not have brought a pad. The Taoist master will deliver it.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cShut up.\u201d\nIf he wanted to give it, he would have arranged for a female classmate to do it. The Taoist master was not that kind of person.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan left the classroom, he went to the toilet to find Su Miaomiao, and called twice in a low voice. The cleaning lady came out and looked at him strangely.\n\u201c\u2026Is there anyone inside?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan returned to the corridor, took out his phone, and called her.\nThere was no strict ban on phones in No. 1 High School, it only stipulated that they couldn\u2019t be used in class.\nThe phone rang several times, and finally connected. Xie Jingyuan pursed his lips, and was about to speak, when Gu Jialing\u2019s voice came, \u201cTaoist Master, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s phone was placed in the desk drawer, on mute, and was discovered by Gu Jialing.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026It\u2019s okay, just listen to the class carefully.\u201d\nAfter finishing the call, Xie Jingyuan stood there for a minute and sent a message to Xu Shou.\nThere was a high probability that Su Miaomiao hid herself, but he couldn\u2019t completely rule out that she might have encountered some danger.\nXu Shou walked out of the classroom and saw the Taoist master standing at the stairs.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cShe\u2019s not in the toilet.\u201d\nXu Shou sniffed, followed the freshest familiar smell, and led Xie Jingyuan to find it.\nA few minutes later, the two found Su Miaomiao on the rostrum of the playground. She was sitting on a seat exposed to the sun, holding a box of ice cream in her hand, and there was a box next to it that was eaten up. She was not in any form of danger.\nXie Jingyuan asked Xu Shou to go back to the classroom first.\nXu Shou thought that if Su Miaomiao violated the classroom discipline so seriously, the priest must give her a severe lesson.\nAfter he walked away, Xie Jingyuan stepped up the steps and revealed himself.\nSu Miaomiao was surrounded by the sweet smell of ice cream, that was why she didn\u2019t notice him approaching. Suddenly seeing Xie Jingyuan, Su Miaomiao was stunned, then lowered her head.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to class?\u201d Xie Jingyuan sat next to her and asked helplessly.\nSu Miaomiao glanced at him and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you will hit me.\u201d\nThe account of the chaos in the brothel was settled at that time, but the fact that she went to see the Taoist master\u2019s things, was just found out by him.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI won\u2019t hit you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t believe it.\nHe saw that she was so scared that she didn\u2019t even eat ice cream, and explained, \u201cActually, I knew you had been to my room.\u201d\nShe was a simple and uncomplicated cat. She rummaged through his drawers but didn\u2019t know how to put the things back where they were. Moreover, when she jumped onto the desk, her paws were stained with ink, and there were deep and shallow black paw prints everywhere.\nBefore that, some little Taoist masters came to him to make a judgment, and all of them were against her.\nBecause there were no serious consequences, Xie Jingyuan did not interfere, and only asked Xu Shou to retrieve the gold and silver items and return them to their original owners.\nSu Miaomiao was still thinking about his words, and asked curiously, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you punish me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said indifferently, \u201cYou just went there, you didn\u2019t steal anything.\u201d\nWhile Su Miaomiao breathed a sigh of relief, secretly rejoiced. Fortunately, there was no treasure in the Taoist master\u2019s room, otherwise she would have stolen it.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the ice cream box in her hand and said, \u201cEat quickly, let\u2019s go to class after eating.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "86": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-86/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao was in a better mood, scooped up a scoop of ice cream with a small spoon, and handed it to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s mouth, \u201cTaste it, Taoist Master, this is a new flavor.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan turned his head back, \u201cDon\u2019t feed me your saliva.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao curled her lips and started eating by herself.\nA few minutes later, in Class 9.\nXie Jingyuan knocked on the door, and when the math teacher said, \u201cCome in,\u201d he pushed the door open again.\nThe students raised their heads one after another and saw Su Miaomiao walking in first.\nHer eyes were bright, her lips were red, with a kind of reverie-inducing moisture.\nThose two points alone were not worth doubting. The problem was that she disappeared with Xie Jingyuan for a long time.\nWas it a kiss?\nPink bubbles popped out of Yu Le\u2019s eyes, and she blinked teasingly at Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t understand what she meant.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t understand either, but he could feel that, except for Gu Jialing and Xu Shou, the expressions of the other students were not normal.\n\u201cYou ate ice cream again, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nAs soon as Su Miaomiao sat back in her seat, Gu Jialing approached from behind, his chin almost touched her shoulder, sniffing at the ice cream smell on her body.\nSu Miaomiao neither admitted nor denied it.\nHe looked at Xie Jingyuan sourly.\nXie Jingyuan stared at the blackboard and said coldly, \u201cSit upright.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cHmph.\u201d\nAfter the evening self-study, Xie Jingyuan took the three of them to buy musical instruments for the performance.\nXu Shou picked a drum with a three-digit price.\nThe bamboo flute Xie Jingyuan chose was also very cheap.\nSu Miaomiao compared all the guqins in the store, and found that they were all similar in appearance. She plucked them and chose the one with the best sound.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan went to pay the bill, Xu Shou pulled Gu Jialing out.\nThe musical instruments were bought, and the quartet wanted to perform a good show, but they still needed to rehearse.\nRehearsing in Pearl Garden would definitely disturb the people. Gu Jialing proposed to practice in his villa. He liked to sing, and a large practice room had been remodeled in the basement of the villa, which was enough for them.\nSu Mingan, his wife and Grandma Tao were very supportive, and they were surprised by their talent.\nXie Jingyuan prepared a statement in advance, saying that they had learned it during the summer vacation before. Because it was just a temporary interest, they didn\u2019t tell the elders.\nFrom elementary school to then, there were so many summer vacations. Su Mingan and his wife were busy during the day, and Grandma Tao also had her own hobbies. It was very common for Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan to go out alone for a few hours, so the three elders did not suspect anything.\nHowever, Su Mingan insisted on transferring the money for buying the guqin to Xie Jingyuan.\nIf Xie Jingyuan refused, it may make Su Mingan suspect that he had ulterior motives.\nAfter the evening self-study, the four of them went to the villa in Gu Jialing\u2019s car.\nWith only three nights of rehearsal time, Gu Jialing had already prepared the score in advance.\nSu Miaomiao took the music score in confusion, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyeballs almost fell out, \u201cThen how did you learn the guqin?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan with a guilty conscience. Although the brothel luthier also had scores, it was completely different from the modern score.\nXie Jingyuan could understand it, and said to Gu Jialing, \u201cYou guide Xu Shou to play the drum, and we are going to the theater room to practice.\u201d\nGu Jialing believed in the Taoist master\u2019s strength.\nXie Jingyuan picked up Su Miaomiao\u2019s guqin and took her to the theater room next door.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t understand modern guqin scores, but she understood \u2018Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zheng, Yu\u2019.\nWith Xie Jingyuan translating for her, and watching the guqin player\u2019s fingers in the video a few times, Su Miaomiao quickly regained the feeling of playing the guqin.\nXie Jingyuan sat obliquely behind Su Miaomiao.\nShe concentrated on plucking the strings, and almost forgot that the Taoist master was also in that room.\nHolding the bamboo flute, Xie Jingyuan practiced silently to the music score. After memorizing it by heart, he raised his head and his eyes fell on Su Miaomiao.\nThe theater room was brightly lit. Su Miaomiao was wearing a black and white high school uniform, with a simple ponytail.\nSuch a dress was almost completely different from the \u201cYiji\u201d he saw through the carved wooden window outside the brothel in his previous life.\nBut her appearance hardly changed much, especially those eyes.\nXie Jingyuan had dealt with too many demons. He could tell whether a demon was good or evil just by looking at their eyes.\nNo matter how beautiful the human form of the evil demon was, their eyes were full of greed and evil, and they completely regarded humans as prey.\nAnd when he first met Su Miaomiao, even though she was surrounded by heavy makeup and alcohol, her eyes were still as clear as water.\nSo, when the white cat hugged his leg pitifully and swore that she only made a mistake for the first time, Xie Jingyuan believed her.\nTime passed little by little, when Su Miaomiao was able to play the melody completely, and when she plucked the strings again, Xie Jingyuan raised the flute, and the sound was in harmony.\nIt was 31st of December, which was also the last day of the Gregorian calendar year, and the next day was the new year.\nThe dormitory students sat in the classroom early to participate in the morning self-study, and the day students arrived one after another.\nWhen Gu Jialing walked into the classroom carrying a guqin and Xu Shou carrying a big red drum, the students in Class 9 immediately burst into screams and whistles one after another.\nGu Jialing was almost exhausted!\nBecause the priest wanted to train with Su Miaomiao, and she disliked Xu Shou\u2019s smell, he was the one who carried the guqin all the way.\nAlthough she disliked it, when he untied the guqin and put it down, Gu Jialing was still very careful. After putting it down, he warned his classmates, \u201cNo one should touch Su Miaomiao\u2019s guqin. She is very stingy, and if you really broke her things, I can\u2019t save you either.\u201d\nThe students all laughed, who hadn\u2019t seen the scene of Su Miaomiao ravaging Gu Jialing\u2019s hair?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Wang Min is going to do the peacock dance. She also brought a dancing skirt, which is so pretty.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, she didn\u2019t think of it, and the priest didn\u2019t remind her.\nGu Jialing suddenly poked his head from behind, glared at her and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any costumes to wear, so don\u2019t try to be special.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao raised her hand to grab his hair, but Gu Jialing quickly avoided it.\nYu Le said in regret, \u201cYou will look really good in ancient clothes.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cParticipation is the most important part of performance, not clothing.\u201d\nYu Le looked at him, suddenly realized, and muttered in a low voice, \u201cYou just don\u2019t want everyone to see Miaomiao dressed like that.\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, she laughed and left.\nXie Jingyuan remained expressionless.\nSu Miaomiao stared at him for a while, and then dispelled the suspicion aroused by Yu Le. Everyone didn\u2019t know what her relation was with the Taoist master, but he just didn\u2019t think an explanation was necessary.\nAfter lunch, the students in each class quickly returned to the classroom, moving tables and blowing balloons, and the classrooms in the corridors were full of festive atmosphere.\nSu Miaomiao was not interested in decorating the classroom, and stayed with Yu Le in the corridor to talk. Class monitor Xie Jingyuan, discipline committee member Xu Shou, and enthusiastic classmate Gu Jialing were all there to help.\n\u201cLook!\u201d Yu Le suddenly bumped into Su Miaomiao\u2019s arm.\nShe followed her gaze and turned her head, and saw Wang Min come back from the toilet, wearing a green dance dress.\nWang Min was quite pretty, but she was even more eye-catching in a sequin skirt (glittery). Wherever she and the two girls around her passed by, all the classmates would turn their heads in amazement.\nSu Miaomiao was not interested in Wang Min\u2019s face, she just stared at the sequins on her skirt.\nYu Le thought she was envious, and sighed, \u201cWho made your guy so possessive? He didn\u2019t want other male students to see your good figure.\u201d\nThe surroundings were too lively, and Yu Le\u2019s voice was so low that Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t hear clearly, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\nJust as Yu Le was about to repeat it, Xie Jingyuan came out at the door of the classroom, swept his gaze, and walked toward them.\nYu Le never had a chance, and walked away wisely, leaving Su Miaomiao to Xie Jingyuan.\nHe felt that Yu Le\u2019s eyes were wrong, and asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cWhat were you talking about?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pointed to Wang Min who had already walked near Class 10, \u201cHer skirt is so pretty.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced and then looked away.\nOn the opposite side, when Wang Min noticed that Xie Jingyuan was looking at her, her heart started beating faster and throbbing nervously.\nShe knew that she couldn\u2019t grab Su Miaomiao\u2019s man, and she didn\u2019t want to, but Xie Jingyuan was so good, she really liked him.\n\u00a0However, Xie Jingyuan just glanced at her skirt lightly, so fast that maybe he only knew that her skirt was green.\nLooking at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s slender figure that almost covered Su Miaomiao, as if only Su Miaomiao could approach him in that life, Wang Min bit her lip and went to talk to Fang Jing as if nothing had happened.\nSu Miaomiao kept staring at Wang Min\u2019s skirt until she entered the classroom.\nXie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t agree with her aesthetics. That kind of sequins could only remind him of the colorful crystal door curtains used in Grandpa and Grandma Su\u2019s house.\nThe class meeting officially began.\nThe class teacher was pulled over from the office by two male students, and sang \u201cMy Chinese Heart\u201d with a smile before leaving.\nWhen he was not there, the students got more open-minded. Facts had proved that the top students were not all the nerds in the legend. Singing pop songs was considered ordinary.\nThe boy who usually seemed to be quiet, actually came to do a hip-hop dance.\nWang Min\u2019s Peacock Dance was the penultimate program.\nWhen she walked to the center of the field, the students in Class 9 fell silent, listening to the melodious melody and admiring Wang Min\u2019s dancing posture.\nBoth Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou lowered their eyes, like two Taoist masters coming down the mountain for the first time.\nGu Jialing looked at the students watching the show one by one, imagining that he would make all the students bow down to his singing voice later.\nOnly Su Miaomiao, with her chin in her hands, followed Wang Min\u2019s figure intently, her eyes reflecting every twinkle of those sequins.\nAt the end of the dance, the students applauded enthusiastically, not only affirming Wang Min, but also looking forward to the grand finale.\nThe group of four from Qingxu Temple stood up.\nXie Jingyuan first placed Su Miaomiao\u2019s guqin in the middle of the podium. After Su Miaomiao sat down, he stood at the bottom left of the podium holding the flute, and Xu Shou placed the big drum at the bottom right of the podium.\nThe three of them settled down, and Gu Jialing took the microphone and walked to the center, which was in the middle of the open space in front of the podium.\nGu Jialing cleared his throat and smiled mysteriously at his classmates.\nHe was handsome, and when he smiled, some of the female students held their faces with their hands, and some lowered their heads as if they were shocked by electricity.\nGu Jialing raised his right hand and snapped his fingers.\nSu Miaomiao plucked the strings.\nThe sound of the guqin was like running water, and it only sounded for two or three seconds before a short and clear flute sound came.\nIt was like a quiet and uninhabited mountain forest, with streams flowing and birds chasing.\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m getting goosebumps!\u201d A girl crossed her arms excitedly.\nWhen everyone\u2019s eyes were still focused on Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan, Gu Jialing started singing.\nHis voice was clear, and he sounded like a young boy, but when he started singing, what he uttered was a thick and unrestrained middle-aged male voice.\n\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\n\u201cThis is like Huang Zhan\u2019s voice! I\u2019ve seen the video of him singing \u2018A Laugh from the Cang Hai\u2019 in concert, and it\u2019s exactly the same!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s him, the lyricist of this song!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Some people moved stools over and lay on the edge of the window to look in.\n\u201cHe is so handsome. Are they even human?\u201d\nThe four people who were inseparable, had good looks, good grades, were good at sports, and their talent was comparable to professionals. If they didn\u2019t see it with their own eyes, who would have believed it?\nThe art committee of Class 9 took a complete video of the concert, and after getting the consent of the four people, it was uploaded to the forum.\n\u00a0In the video, although the four of them were only wearing the most common school uniforms, they were all immersed in it and forgot themselves, as if they had really experienced such a chivalrous world, and they were once lonely and at ease.\nFor high school students, the indulgence was only short-lived, and most of the time they still had to study.\nDuring the three-day holiday on New Year\u2019s Day, apart from insisting on daily training, Su Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan to review and do questions.\nBecause the final exam was approaching, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou didn\u2019t go home that holiday, and neither of them would admit defeat.\nThe children were self-disciplined, and Grandma Tao didn\u2019t have to worry at all. She changed into her dance clothes and went to the square.\n\u201cTaoist Master, if I can break into the top fifty in the final exam, will you give me a reward?\u201d After completing a chemistry test paper and checking the answers, Gu Jialing stretched and walked to the door of the master bedroom, and asked with a playful smile.\nXie Jingyuan said indifferently, \u201cStudy is not for reward.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe Taoist master made so much money, why was he so stingy?\nGu Jialing went to the living room to call the old man. As long as his ranking rose, the old man would still be very generous.\nAt that time, Su Miaomiao also received a call from Cheng Yue, saying that she wanted to come and play with her.\nSu Miaomiao agreed.\nMore than half an hour later, Su Miaomiao invited Cheng Yue and Feng Xiaoyu to 1002.\nThe two girls came there because they wanted to see Su Miaomiao and the others performing. However, when they visited 1002, they were ashamed to find that Xie Jingyuan was reading a book, Xu Shou was doing a test, and Gu Jialing was using his clear and beautiful voice to recite ancient prose in a low voice. Even Su Miaomiao had her coffee table in the living room covered with test papers and textbooks.\n\u201cWhat do you want to play?\u201d Su Miaomiao entertained her friends.\nCheng Yue looked at Feng Xiaoyu, and Feng Xiaoyu also looked at her. They looked at each other for a minute, and they said in unison, \u201cNo play, we are here to study.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao cleared the coffee table to make room for them.\nAt eleven o\u2019clock, Grandma Tao came back and warmly invited the two girls to have lunch at home.\nCheng Yue thought that when they relax at noon, maybe the four top students would be willing to perform.\nUnexpectedly, because Gu Jialing wanted to compete with Su Miaomiao for the part with the fewest bones in braised fish, in order to resolve the dispute peacefully, Xie Jingyuan actually asked a physics problem at the table. He asked them if they were going to pick up Grandma Tao, how long would it take for them to meet each other. They could only do mental calculations, and couldn\u2019t pick up a pen.\nWhat was even more frightening was that Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing really figured it out.\nGrandma Tao smiled and used chopsticks to pick up food for the two girls, \u201cSeeing that you are so studious, your grades must be very good, right?\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter the meal, the two little girls ran away quickly. In the world of toppers, it was better for them mortals not to get involved.\nThe video of the four-person ensemble became the most popular post on the school forum not long after it was uploaded.\nThe direct impact was that when school started after the holiday, wherever the four of them went, there would be a small commotion.\nKnowing that Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t see the forum, Yu Le took the initiative to reveal the latest progress, \u201cMiaomiao, you are now recognized as the school belle of the three grades in our No. 1 High school. As for the school grass, the class president and Gu Jialing had basically the same number of votes, and the result of the debate has not yet been reached.\u201d\nWhat Yu Le said while sitting in the front row of Su Miaomiao was heard by the other three members of Qingxu Temple.\nGu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan quietly. In terms of handsomeness, the Taoist master was not as good as him, right?\nJust as he thought that way, Su Miaomiao said in disbelief, \u201cThe votes are even? Can Gu Jialing compare with the Taoist master?\u201d\nYu Le: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe other girls who were secretly paying attention to her: \u201c\u2026\u201d Su Miaomiao, why? Although everyone knows that you are in a relationship with the monitor, you can\u2019t just talk nonsense! It is true that Gu Jialing\u2019s grades cannot be compared with the monitor, but his appearance like the flower of the high mountain and the handsome sunshine has its own supporters.\u00a0\nIn fact, Xu Shou was not much worse, but he was a little darker and too strong, which did not meet the mainstream selection criteria for school grass.\nAfter laughing at Su Miaomiao, everyone looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nHis eyes were on the book as usual.\nGu Jialing suddenly snorted at Su Miaomiao with the utmost sarcasm, \u201cYour flattery is too obvious, you learned from Su Daji, right? Oh, no wonder your surname is Su, so you were vixen from the very beginning!\u201d\n(Su Daji was the favorite consort of King Zhou of Shang, the last king of the Shang dynasty in ancient China. In legends and fictions, she is portrayed as a malevolent fox spirit who killed and impersonated the real Daji)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Just throwing a look at King Zhou of Shang, he would not lie down and lick her feet, right?\nAlthough the monitor was not as stupid as King Zhou of Shang, he also obeyed Su Miaomiao\u2019s words, so how could there be any need for her to flatter him?\nAs for Su Miaomiao\u2019s surname, just because her family name was Su, would she have a half a dime relationship with Su Daji?\nSuch a handsome guy, why did he always act like he was stupid?\nIf the other girls in the school knew Gu Jialing\u2019s true face, there would be no suspense in the school grass selection, the monitor would win.\nIt was a pity that other girls didn\u2019t know Gu Jialing well.\nAt eight o\u2019clock in the evening, Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan walked toward the teaching building from the tennis court, and saw Xu Shou and Gu Jialing coming out of the teaching building from a distance. At that moment, two girls went up to meet them, one of them, a tall, slim, pretty and somewhat proud girl stopped Gu Jialing, not knowing what to say.\nSu Miaomiao quickened her pace curiously.\nThe girl saw Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan, but she didn\u2019t care, and continued to ask Gu Jialing, \u201cHow about it, do you want to be my boyfriend? I\u2019m an art student, and we can take the film academy exam together.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at her weirdly, \u201cWhy should I be your boyfriend?\u201d\nThe girl had a straightforward personality, otherwise she would not take the initiative to pursue the boy she liked. When questioned by Gu Jialing, the girl smiled and raised her chin slightly, \u201cI am beautiful. You see your two good friends in love every day, don\u2019t you want to be in love?\u201d\u00a0\nGu Jialing looked blank, \u201cWhich good friends of mine are in love?\u201d\nThe girl pointed at Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan.\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cAre you stupid? They\u2019re not in love. I won\u2019t talk to you, you don\u2019t look pretty at all!\u201d\nXu Shou also looked at the girl like looking at a fool.\nThe girl\u2019s face changed rapidly, from red to white.\nHer friend looked suspiciously at the group of four and suddenly pulled the girl away. After walking a long distance, she quietly analyzed, \u201cI understand now, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou both like Su Miaomiao, they can\u2019t compete with Xie Jingyuan, but they don\u2019t want to give up, and they don\u2019t like hearing others say that Su Miaomiao is dating Xie Jingyuan!\u201d\nThe girl nodded angrily.\nThat could only be the reason, otherwise, how could Gu Jialing despise her for not being beautiful?\nHmph, she didn\u2019t like that kind of fool anymore!\nThe group of four didn\u2019t pay much attention to the content of the school forum, but so many things happened, and they couldn\u2019t help talking about it on the way home.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cXu Shou, what do you think those girls think? They actually think that Gu Jialing can compete with the Taoist master.\u201d\nXu Shou was the one who understood human beings the best among the three demons, and said with a sneer, \u201cPeople are most easily confused by appearances, women by Gu Jialing and men by yours.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glared at him, \u201cI am very beautiful in my original form, which is different from him.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cYou are as narcissistic as him.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cYes, we are narcissistic, only you have self-knowledge and know that you are the ugliest.\u201d\nXu Shou dismissed that verbal provocation.\nSu Miaomiao glanced at Xu Shou up and down, supported Gu Jialing and said, \u201cYes, he is ugly in his original form, and he is also ugly after he became a human being. Otherwise, why would no girl come to him?\u201d\nGu Jialing suddenly remembered the red apples that Xu Shou received on Christmas Eve, and then thought again, girls just like Xu Shou\u2019s helpfulness, it had nothing to do with his face.\nAfter attacking Xu Shou, Gu Jialing leaned close to Su Miaomiao\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cActually, the priest is also ugly. The proof is that no girl confessed to him.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked, and ran over to complain to Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan was born with a detached attitude of love, \u201cTrees wither, and people also age. The skin gets bad, so it\u2019s better to focus on studying.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded in resignation.\nGu Jialing touched his face, looking forward to it, \u201cIf time flies faster, then I will be reborn as a bird in my next life.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked over with complicated eyes, and reminded, \u201cReincarnation is not in human control, and you may become a pig. It is better to live this life well than to count on the next life.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter making sure that Gu Jialing would not have any stupid idea of \u200b\u200bcommitting suicide just for reincarnation, Xie Jingyuan finally looked at Su Miaomiao.\nIt didn\u2019t matter to Su Miaomiao, as long as she could follow the Taoist master all the time. With him around, she didn\u2019t have to worry about being bullied by bad demons or bad people.\nSo, she stopped and asked Xie Jingyuan seriously, \u201cTaoist Master, if we get old, would you continue to care about us?\u201d\nIn two lifetimes, she had seen many old people abandoned by their children, and she had also seen more domestic animals eaten or thrown away by their owners because they couldn\u2019t do their jobs or became ugly.\nWhen she asked that question, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing also looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nThe emotions in the eyes of the three different faces were similar.\nXie Jingyuan smiled and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\nFor those with simple and pure minds, there was no need to say too much, that was enough.\nThe three demons were indeed very satisfied.\nThe performance of the New Year\u2019s Eve party was quickly overwhelmed by the atmosphere of the final exam.\nBecause her rank in the midterm exam was lowered, Su Miaomiao was also full of energy to prepare for the exam. When she got home at night, she studied for another hour after eating supper.\nSu Mingan was proud and distressed. When his daughter loved to sleep in when she was a child, he hoped that his daughter would become sensible. But when his daughter really got sensible, he hoped that she would not have to work so hard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad to go to bed at eleven o\u2019clock. I heard that some high school students don\u2019t go to bed until one or two o\u2019clock in the morning!\u201d Lying on the bed, Tang Shiwei couldn\u2019t bear her husband\u2019s sentimentality, and said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019d rather Miaomiao\u2019s grades don\u2019t improve rather than her getting sick.\u201d\nTang Shiwei smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miaomiao will be fine.\u201d\nIn a blink of an eye, it was the final exams.\nSu Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan to the first examination room.\nThere were still sixty students, but the list of students had changed. Some students regressed too much and were assigned to other examination rooms, while some students had worked hard to catch up and get promoted.\nXie Jingyuan was still seated at No. 1, but Su Miaomiao became No. 30. Not to mention Xie Jingyuan who she was far from, even Lin Xi who was in the top ten was two rows away from her.\nSu Miaomiao pouted.\nThe invigilator came in and handed out the test papers on time.\nSu Miaomiao took a deep breath, filled in her name, and began to concentrate on answering the questions.\nAt the end of the first session, the students stood up and walked away one after another.\nLin Xi passed by, raised her hand, and quietly put a strawberry-flavored fudge on Su Miaomiao\u2019s table.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up. She smiled at Lin Xi who had already walked to the door, and then went to Xie Jingyuan to check the answers.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her slightly swollen left cheek, paused, but finally said nothing.\nThe final exams were over, and the winter vacation for high school students had officially begun.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou went back to their hometowns that day.\nSu Miaomiao, same as in previous years, spent the New Year with her grandparents in Jiang City.\nOn the second day of the Lunar New Year, Su Mingan and the busy Tang Shiwei returned to Anshi first. Su Miaomiao continued to stay there until the tenth day of the first lunar month before going home to meet her cousin Tang Yan.\n\u201cHey, I haven\u2019t seen you for so long, do you miss your little boyfriend?\u201d\nAfter going through the security check at the airport, Tang Yan dragged her suitcase to the departure hall while teasing her little cousin.\nSu Miaomiao was very helpless, \u201cI\u2019ve said it several times, I don\u2019t have that kind of relationship with the Taoist master.\u201d\nTang Yan: \u201cOkay, okay, you want to hide it from me, high school students are really thin-skinned.\u201d\u00a0 (shy)\nAt that time, Tang Yan received a call. Seeing the caller ID, she quickened her pace and distanced herself from Su Miaomiao before answering.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s hearing was more sensitive than ordinary people, so she heard everything, and heard her cousin chatting with the person in a softer voice than usual, \u201cI\u2019m going to take my cousin home first\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll stay at my aunt\u2019s house for one night. I will arrive at the university tomorrow\u2026I warn you, if the gift you prepare doesn\u2019t satisfy my wishes, our relationship will come to an end, hum\u2026\u201d\nAfter the call ended, Tang Yan turned her head and waved to her little cousin who was standing there foolishly.\nSu Miaomiao said in a positive tone, \u201cYou have a boyfriend.\u201d\nEvery year on Valentine\u2019s Day, her father would give her mother a gift. Two days ago, Yu Le, Feng Xiaoyu, and Cheng Yue asked her if she would come back to spend the holiday with Xie Jingyuan, so Su Miaomiao understood the meaning of Valentine\u2019s Day very well.\nTang Yan first quibbled, but when she found that her cousin had heard her phone call completely, she quickly hugged her and coaxed her to help her hide the matter from her parents.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhy do you want to hide it? Aren\u2019t college students allowed to fall in love?\u201d\nTang Yan sighed, \u201cIf I tell you, then you will definitely ask a lot of questions. We just got together last semester, so we don\u2019t know how long we will date.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao seemed to understand, but didn\u2019t at the same time.\nTang Yan rubbed her head, changed the subject and said, \u201cWill Xie Jingyuan come to pick you up later?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cFather is at home today, he will be here to pick us up.\u201d\nTang Yan was a little disappointed. She wanted to see her little cousin\u2019s boyfriend again.\nAfter one o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Su Mingan drove the cousins \u200b\u200bback home.\nThe meals were all warmed in the kitchen, and Su Mingan brought the dishes to the dining table.\nTang Yan: \u201cUncle is so kind. When I marry in the future, I will also marry someone who can cook.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked over suspiciously, \u201cYour current boyfriend can\u2019t cook?\u201d\nTang Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Mingan laughed, \u201cYanyan is in love? Don\u2019t worry, uncle will keep it a secret for you. How about it? Do you have a picture of him? I\u2019ll check him out for you first.\u201d\nTang Yan blushed and gave the stupid cousin a look.\nOf course she wouldn\u2019t show him the pictures. Tang Yan picked up the bowl and bowed her head to eat.\nSu Miaomiao shut up obediently, and the cousins went back to the room after eating.\nWhen they were in the room, Su Miaomiao continued to ask, \u201cDoes your boyfriend know how to cook?\u201d\nTang Yan: \u201cI didn\u2019t ask. Anyway, we live in the dormitory, either eating in the cafeteria or eating out.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen why don\u2019t you ask first? If he can\u2019t cook, you shouldn\u2019t be with him.\u201d\nTang Yan: \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, love is love, and marriage is marriage. Before I get married, I can fall in love many times. Including you and Xie Jingyuan, now you both are sticky. But when you go to different universities, maybe love will fade.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao first denied her cousin\u2019s contingency, \u201cI will definitely go to the same university as the Taoist master.\u201d\nNot only her, but also Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, they all agreed that the four of them would attend the same university.\nTang Yan clicked her tongue, \u201cYou still say that you are not in a relationship. Will you say that your tongue slipped?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t even want to explain!\n\u201cYou play on the computer, I\u2019ll go see grandma,\u201d Su Miaomiao stood up and said.\nTang Yan: \u201cAre you going to see Grandma Tao or the school grass?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe quickened her pace and walked out, took the gift that was arranged for Grandma Tao by her grandparents, and went to 1002 to knock on the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "91": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-91/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was Grandma Tao who opened the door, she smiled as soon as she saw Su Miaomiao, \u201cI knew that Miaomiao would come, there are strawberries washed on the tea table, they are so sweet, go and eat them.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled and went to eat strawberries.\nGrandma Tao put away the gift and walked to the master bedroom. The door was open, and Xie Jingyuan was sitting at the desk writing something.\nGrandma Tao reminded her grandson in a low voice, \u201cMiaomiao is here!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the old lady.\nGrandma Tao curled her lips. The brat was still pretending to be calm with her.\nShe urged, \u201cI want to do laundry, you come out and sit with Miaomiao for a while.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan also understood what the old lady was thinking, and said indifferently, \u201cShe is not a guest.\u201d\nWhich girl would bear his temper?\nGrandma Tao stared at him, \u201cDon\u2019t bully Miaomiao, if you go on like this, sooner or later she will like someone else. I think Xu Shou and Jia Ling are both very good. Isn\u2019t there Lin Xi? Not much worse than you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIn order to keep the ears clean, and to save the old lady from worrying about what she shouldn\u2019t, Xie Jingyuan finally saved the document and closed the notebook, and went to the living room expressionlessly.\nGrandma Tao silently slandered him in the back. Her son was too romantic when he was young, and her grandson was too cold. How did they become two extremes?\nIn the living room, Su Miaomiao was already eating the second strawberry. When she saw Xie Jingyuan, she vaguely felt that something was wrong. After observing him carefully for a while, she frowned and asked, \u201cTaoist Master, you have grown taller again?\u201d\nWhen she was a child, she was about the same as the Taoist master, but since junior high school, the Taoist master had grown in size as if a fertilized crop, and he was a head taller than her.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t measure it, and simply glanced at Su Miaomiao, but found that she was still the same as before departure.\nHe sat down two seats away, and asked casually, \u201cDid you train over there?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI ran with my uncle and the others in the morning, but they can\u2019t play tennis well.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWell, we will continue to go to the gymnasium tomorrow morning.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hadn\u2019t played tennis for more than half a month, her hands were already itchy, but she couldn\u2019t do anything about it, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to send my cousin off.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t think too much, \u201cThen the day after tomorrow.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nAfter eating three strawberries, she remembered that her cousin was still waiting at home, said bye to Grandma Tao and left.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t send her out, but walked to the coffee table, and put the strawberry leaves she picked off into the trash can in the kitchen.\nIn 1001, Tang Yan was chatting with her boyfriend when Su Miaomiao walked in. She glanced at her casually. But her eyes widened suddenly, and she ran to close the door, grabbed Su Miaomiao again, pointed at her lips and smiled, \u201cBe honest with me, what did you and Xie Jingyuan do just now?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked puzzled, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything, we just made an appointment to play tennis together tomorrow.\u201d\nTang Yan: \u201cWho are you kidding? Go look in the mirror yourself. You must have been kissing.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao really went to look in the mirror, and saw her lips in the mirror were red, but her lips would be like that every time after eating.\n\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, just smell it, it\u2019s the smell of strawberries in my mouth,\u201d Su Miaomiao walked toward her cousin with her mouth open, wanting to prove herself.\nTang Yan ran away, \u201cI don\u2019t want to, go ask your Taoist master to smell it.\u201d\nThat was the unique intimacy between lovers, even sisters couldn\u2019t bear it.\nSu Miaomiao remembered that Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t even want to eat the ice cream with her saliva on it, so she curled her lips and lay down on the bed to sleep.\nJokes aside, at night the cousins shared the same bed, Tang Yan still set a bottom line for the little cousin in a low voice, \u201cHolding hands, hugging, and kissing are all fine, but it\u2019s absolutely not okay for him to take off your clothes, as you are still young!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIn her previous life, when she wanted to pick up a man in a brothel, she only showed her shoulders, and the Taoist master beat her back to her original shape. How could such a Taoist master take off her clothes?\nIt would be more believable for him to skin her alive.\nThe next day was Sunday, but unfortunately Tang Shiwei still had shifts.\nSu Mingan brought Su Miaomiao to the train station to send off her cousin, and after it departed, he smiled at his daughter, \u201cLet\u2019s go, accompany me to buy a gift for your mother.\u201d\nIt was Valentine\u2019s Day the next day. Although they had been married for more than ten years, that special day was still to be celebrated.\nTang Shiwei and Su Miaomiao were indeed mother and daughter, as they both had a soft spot for shiny jewelry, but Tang Shiwei knew how to restrain herself.\nThe father and daughter came to the jewelry store, and Su Mingan picked out a diamond necklace with a heart-shaped pendant for his wife.\n\u201cDad, I like this,\u201d Su Miaomiao pointed to a platinum diamond bracelet and said, she had just counted it carefully, and there were a total of sixty-six small diamonds in that bracelet.\nHow could Su Mingan refuse his daughter\u2019s big eyes full of longing?!\nShe liked it? Then buy it!\nThat gift was not given for free. On the way home, Su Mingan smiled and discussed with his daughter, \u201cTomorrow, Miaomiao will go to grandma\u2019s house to play, and I will take mom out for a date, is that okay? Mom rarely has a day off, and she doesn\u2019t usually have the chance to go out and relax.\u201d\nOf course, Su Miaomiao would cooperate with the plan that could make her mother happy.\nIn the evening when Tang Shiwei came back from work, Su Mingan secretly winked at his wife.\nShe followed him to the kitchen, and when she learned of her husband\u2019s plan, she smiled and said, \u201cWe will celebrate the holiday, maybe Miaomiao and Jing Yuan also have arrangements.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThinking of that possibility, Su Mingan gritted his teeth and regretted, \u201cIf I knew, I would have let Miaomiao stay with us for a few more days.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jing Yuan is sensible. At this age, they would probably go to the garden, watch movies and so on.\u201d\nSu Mingan was not happy either, and went out to test his daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Xie Jingyuan was drinking water, his head was raised, his Adam\u2019s apple was rolling.\nYu Le: \u201c\u2026\u201d Was this a scene she should see?\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s movements remained unchanged, and he gave Su Miaomiao a sideways glance.\nSu Miaomiao turned the phone.\nYu Le quietly asked, \u201cWhat gift did the monitor give you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo gift for me.\u201d\nYu Le looked shocked, \u201cDid he forget that today is Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026Stop talking!\u201d\nShe really hung up the video, annoyed and angry about similar misunderstandings and too much teasing.\nXie Jingyuan looked over.\nAlthough Yu Le lowered her voice, he actually heard the conversation.\nHowever, he didn\u2019t quite understand why Su Miaomiao was angry.\nShe bickered with Gu Jialing and Xu Shou, quarreling with her to sleep, and grabbing food from her. Other than that, there were very few classmates who could make her angry. She had always been indifferent to the trivial matters of human life.\nOf course, he and Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t need to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day, but it was also a festival where gifts were given. So was Su Miaomiao angry that he didn\u2019t prepare a gift?\nShe had a simple mind, she only cared about whether there were gifts, and she didn\u2019t care about the meaning of each festival.\n\u201cWhat gift do you want?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked calmly as he glanced at her pouted mouth.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him unexpectedly.\nHe screwed on the cap of the mineral water, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to buy it after playing.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao really cared about gifts the most, since the priest offered to give her, she immediately smiled and shook her empty left wrist, \u201cI want another bracelet.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cOkay.\u201d\nAfter leaving the gymnasium, Xie Jingyuan called a taxi, and the two went to Longxing Building.\nThere were quite a lot of customers in the jewelry store that day. They were basically men and women. Women in beautiful skirts were holding the men\u2019s arm, smiling happily to choose.\nSu Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan looked like high school students, so a clerk glanced at them and didn\u2019t come over to entertain them.\nAnother clerk still remembered those two customers with perfect looks, and even more remembered that Xie Jingyuan, a high school student, bought a pair of six-figure sapphire earrings for his little girlfriend without blinking an eye.\n\u201cHey, you guys are here again, what do you want to buy today?\u201d The clerk walked over with a bright smile.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao.\nHe had a cold demeanor and dull eyes, but the clerk automatically understood that kind of domineering and pampering look that he would give his girlfriend whatever she wanted.\nThe clerk concentrated on entertaining Su Miaomiao, and took her to the counter where the bracelets were placed.\nSu Miaomiao counted carefully, and chose a shiny bracelet with dozens of small diamonds.\nAfter choosing the gift, the two went to check out together.\nThe clerk packed the gift box, took out a bouquet with nine roses at the same time, handed it to Su Miaomiao and said, \u201cWe have an event in our shop today, you\u2019re welcome to visit us next time.\u201d\nThe roses were bright red, with some white flowers dotted inside, which was quite beautiful.\nSince it was a free gift, Su Miaomiao took it.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIf she really took the flowers back, the relationship between the two could no longer be explained clearly in the eyes of the elders.\nXie Jingyuan changed the plan temporarily and invited her to a restaurant for lunch, and called Grandma Tao on the way to avoid the old lady waiting for them.\nGrandma Tao smiled, \u201cGo, go, I told you early in the morning to have a lunch date.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was speechless.\nWhen he arrived at the restaurant, he looked around and found that they were all couples, and roses were placed on every table.\nSu Miaomiao was flipping through the menu intently, wearing a diamond bracelet on each of her wrists, reflecting the light and shining brightly.\nFortunately, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s plan went smoothly.\nSure enough, Su Miaomiao, whose mind was full of food, forgot the bouquet of roses and dragged him to play games.\nSu Miaomiao forgot about the roses. But the staff of the restaurant were very responsible. After she and Xie Jingyuan had walked out of the restaurant for a certain distance, the female staff in uniform chased them out enthusiastically.\n\u00a0\u201cAh, thank you,\u201d Su Miaomiao took the bouquet and said politely.\nUnder the guidance of Su Mingan, Grandma Tao, and Xie Jingyuan, Su Miaomiao had become very polite. She must thank others for helping her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, have fun.\u201d\nWith a smile in her eyes, the female employee took another look at the pair of handsome man and beautiful woman and went back contentedly.\nSu Miaomiao held the roses in front of her face, and sniffed them vigorously, but she still didn\u2019t smell a particularly obvious fragrance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Everyone looked at them. There were even a few young women who were moving together pointing at him and Su Miaomiao while happily discussing something.\nXie Jingyuan silently looked away.\nIn fact, that was not the first Valentine\u2019s Day he and Su Miaomiao spent together.\nDuring elementary school, they often went out with the old lady. When they entered junior high school, Cheng Yue and the others would ask him out with Su Miaomiao, including on Valentine\u2019s Day.\nMaybe when they were young at that time, adults would not misunderstand it as puppy love, but since they were high school students\u2026\nOn February 14th, Xie Jingyuan deliberately remembered the date, and decided that he would never go out with Su Miaomiao on that day every year.\nIn the gaming room, Su Miaomiao exchanged the game coins and went to the claw machine again.\nXie Jingyuan held flowers in one hand and put his other hand in his pocket, watching her play absent-mindedly.\n\u201cWow, you got it!\u201d A girl\u2019s excited voice came from another claw machine, and the two looked over at the same time. The girl in a skirt happily clung to her boyfriend\u2019s neck and kissed him on the lips. The boy grabbed the back of her head as they continued to kiss.\nSu Miaomiao was still watching, when Xie Jingyuan suddenly raised his hand and tapped the top of her head, letting her turn her around.\nSu Miaomiao sneaked another look, then whispered to him, \u201cTaoist Master, are they also high school students?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI think so, didn\u2019t you say that puppy love is not allowed in high school?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThere are always people who like to break the rules, and they will bear the consequences themselves in the future.\u201d\n\u00a0What he said was so serious that Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t think about it anymore, anyway, she wouldn\u2019t fall in love so early.\nAfter grabbing a bunch of dolls, Xie Jingyuan went to the front desk and asked for a shopping bag, the kind with a white logo printed on it, nothing more than ordinary.\nDolls could be taken home, but roses were a problem.\nWhen passing a trash can, Xie Jingyuan said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cThis kind of flower is not fragrant, do you still want to take it back?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cMom likes roses the most. Every time dad gives her roses, she is very happy.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIf uncle and aunt ask you where the roses came from, how would you explain?\u201d\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to say that it was from the jewelry store, she suddenly remembered that her parents didn\u2019t want her to accept such an expensive gift. With a turn of her gaze, Su Miaomiao grabbed the roses and put them on top of the trash can, placing them vertically like a decoration on the trash can.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Su Miaomiao clapped her hands with a sly look on her face as she thought she was smart.\nXie Jingyuan took another look at the roses before catching up to her.\nBack home, Su Miaomiao put the two diamond bracelets into the safe.\nShe didn\u2019t want her parents to see the one that the Taoist master gave her, and couldn\u2019t let Gu Jialing who was about to return to school see it or the stinky bird would scold her in front of the Taoist master.\n\u2014\nThe new semester started, and the students only saw the final exam results of the previous semester.\nXie Jingyuan was still first in both class and grade, Xu Shou was second in class and third in grade, and successfully regained his original ranking.\nGu Jialing made the most progress, squeezed into the top 20 in the class, and narrowly ranked 58th in the grade. In the next exam, he would be taking the exams in classroom one.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s ranking was actually the same as the midterm exam.\nHaving already experienced Su Miaomiao\u2019s concern about grades, Gu Jialing did not dare to show off.\nXie Jingyuan affirmed Su Miaomiao\u2019s performance, \u201cYou have training, so it\u2019s already very good to be able to maintain your grades.\u201d\nHow could a mere sentence appease Su Miaomiao\u2019s disappointment? She looked at Xie Jingyuan anxiously, and stretched out two fingers.\nAfter eating in the cafeteria at noon, Xie Jingyuan took her to the school supermarket to buy two ice creams.\nThere were no special school activities that semester, and there was no long holiday like National Day. The students were all immersed in the textbook test questions.\nBefore they knew it, it was April.\nApril twenty-second was Friday.\nAfter evening self-study and school, the group of four met downstairs in the teaching building and walked to the school gate together.\n\u201cTaoist Master, our birthday is on Monday, so why not celebrate it this weekend?\u201d Gu Jialing walked backward with his hands in his pockets, looking expectantly at Xie Jingyuan who was walking between Xu Shou and Su Miaomiao.\nAs early as when they reunited, the four members of Qingxu Temple discovered that their birthdays were actually on the same day, which showed that there was a destiny.\nSu Miaomiao said first, \u201cI want a birthday gift, I can\u2019t just eat a meal and make do.\u201d\nThe Taoist master said that he would only give her gifts twice a year, and he gave her the one that was an exception that year, leaving only the birthday gift.\nGu Jialing immediately said, \u201cI want one too, you can\u2019t be partial, what you give me can\u2019t be cheaper than what you give her.\u201d\nXu Shou looked at them coldly, \u201cBirthday gifts are given to each other. What will you give the Taoist master?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao whispered, \u201cTaoist master doesn\u2019t need anything. He doesn\u2019t like birthday gifts either.\u201d\nWhen she was two years old, she kissed Xie Jingyuan as a birthday gift, but he was disgusted by her.\nOn her third birthday, Su Miaomiao climbed onto the desk in the study room at home, wanting to pick a book from the bookcase to give to Xie Jingyuan, but because the human body was not so dexterous, she accidentally fell off the desk and her forehead had a big bulge. After Xie Jingyuan found out, he said that he didn\u2019t like gifts, and she did not need to give him any more in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After thinking for a while, he said with a smile, \u201cThen let\u2019s each prepare three gifts, it\u2019s the most fair.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cYes.\u201d\nHe just wanted to give one to the Taoist master alone.\nGu Jialing: \u201cThis is called \u2018in Rome do what the Romans do\u2019. Don\u2019t you think so, Taoist Master?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to hear them arguing, so he nodded.\nGu Jialing whistled happily, \u201cThen it\u2019s settled, the four of us will set off separately tomorrow, and we will exchange gifts the morning after tomorrow.\u201d\nIn her house, while Su Miaomiao was eating supper, Su Mingan and his wife were also discussing how to celebrate their daughter\u2019s sixteenth birthday.\nSu Mingan: \u201cIt\u2019s still the same as before, taking commemorative photos in the morning, eating out at a restaurant at noon, finding a place to play in the afternoon, and eating cake at home in the evening?\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cOkay, call Xu Shou and Jia Ling too.\u201d\nOnly then did Su Miaomiao remember, and told her parents, \u201cThe two of them have the same birthday.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nTang Shiwei: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nOn being surprised, the couple simply took Su Miaomiao to 1002 to discuss how to celebrate their birthday together.\nGu Jialing: \u201cYou guys actually take photos together every year?\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cYes, we went to get the photos and took a lot of them.\u201d\nShe happily went to the room and brought a thick and large photo album.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing sat side by side on the sofa, looking down together.\nThat album was specially used to hold Xie Jingyuan\u2019s birthday photos, including the photo of him and Xie Rong and his wife on the day of his birth, single photos of Xie Jingyuan, and photos of his grandma and grandson. There were actually quite a lot of photos of him and Su Miaomiao together!\nXu Shou watched, and suddenly understood why the Taoist master favored Su Miaomiao. It turned out that the Taoist master really regarded Su Miaomiao as his younger sister.\nGu Jialing was full of jealousy, as he also wanted to take a photo with the Taoist master.\nOn Saturday, the four set off separately to prepare the gifts.\nTang Shiwei was going to work, and Su Miaomiao went shopping with her father.\nFor that birthday gift, Tang Shiwei encouraged her daughter to prepare according to the three boys\u2019 preferences, but Su Mingan felt that it should not be so troublesome. It would be fair to give the boys exactly the same gift.\nSu Miaomiao agreed with her father.\nOn Su Mingan\u2019s suggestion, Su Miaomiao bought three white shirts of the same style. Xu Shou was strong so he got one size bigger.\u00a0\nSu Mingan bought three identical electric shavers.\nAlthough the three boys didn\u2019t have beards, they should be getting to that age.\nOn Sunday morning, the two families gathered at 1002 to eat longevity noodles cooked by Grandma Tao.\nThey exchanged gifts before eating.\nThe adults gave them first, and Su Mingan gave them three razors and instructed them how to use them.\nTang Shiwei gave the boys three sets of skin care products.\nGrandma Tao gave three red envelopes to the boys, and gave Su Miaomiao an emerald bracelet.\nGu Jialing moved his lips, but didn\u2019t make any partial remarks.\nIt was the children\u2019s turn to exchange gifts.\nWhen Su Miaomiao took out the three ordinary white shirts, the corners of Gu Jialing\u2019s lips twitched fiercely.\nXie Jingyuan took the gift and gave each of the three demons a set of books, of the subjects they were weaker in.\nXu Shou said solemnly, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Gu Jialing and swallowed the dissatisfaction in her heart.\nXu Shou gave Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing a pen each, and Xie Jingyuan a long sword without a sharp edge.\nSu Mingan: \u201cHey, this gift is unique, show me.\u201d\nWhile Su Mingan was concentrating on admiring the sword, Gu Jialing bitterly took out the gifts he had prepared.\nCompared to Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s comprehensive perfunctory and Xu Shou\u2019s differential treatment, Gu Jialing\u2019s gift was actually the most thoughtful.\nHe gave Su Miaomiao small five-digit earrings, Xu Shou a set of best-selling fighting novels, and Xie Jingyuan a newly published Taoist novel \u201cTown of Monsters 2\u201d.\nAlthough the prices vary from high to low, they were according to their preferences.\nGu Jialing\u2019s face was slightly sullen, hoping that the three of them would consciously repent for their perfunctory treatment of him.\nXie Jingyuan remained expressionless.\nXu Shou glanced at the elders, and with a reddish face, covered the cover of the novel with a white shirt.\nSu Miaomiao was staring at \u201cTown Monster 2\u201d in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s hand.\nHe published another book.\nHad he made at least a few hundred thousand again?\nEarning so much, he just gave her a set of \u201cHigh School History Key Encyclopedia\u201d?\nLooking up, Su Miaomiao stared at Xie Jingyuan resentfully.\nHe didn\u2019t seem to notice, and went back to his room to put the gifts.\nSu Miaomiao followed immediately.\nWithout waiting for her to speak, not letting Gu Jialing catch up, Xie Jingyuan quickly stuffed something into her hand, \u201cHide it well.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao lowered her head and saw a pair of ruby \u200b\u200bearrings, each gem as big as a cherry.\nSu Miaomiao just smiled, and ran out happily, \u201cI\u2019ll keep the gift home first!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao returned to 1001 with the four gifts she received.\nThe pen was placed on the desk, and the three jewels were locked in the safe.\nGrandma Tao liked her, and the Taoist master treated her well. When Su Miaomiao put on the pearl earrings Gu Jialing gave her at the end, she was moved.\nGu Jialing, the stinky bird, usually avoided letting her rub his hair. In fact, he really enjoyed it. That was why he gave her such a beautiful gift.\nIn the previous life, everyone had long hair. Su Miaomiao liked to have her head scratched by an eight-year-old Taoist master. Gu Jialing definitely liked it too.\nBack at 1002, Su Miaomiao came over with a smile when she saw that everyone was already sitting at the dining table ready to eat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "95": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-95/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGu Jialing\u2019s complexion was not very good, when Su Miaomiao passed by him, she suddenly stopped and scratched his head gently.\nNormally, she did that mostly to tease him, but that time Su Miaomiao wanted to reward him, so she did so lightly.\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t explode her for her father and mother\u2019s sake, so he just tilted his head and dodged, \u201cStop making trouble, and eat your longevity noodles.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao continued to scratch, \u201cI know you like it.\u201d\nHum, the bird was tight lipped.\nGu Jialing couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, turned around and grabbed her dishonest hand, \u201cWhen did I like it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen why did you give me earrings? Ice cream is so cheap, you aren\u2019t even willing to buy one for me.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Mingan coughed.\nXie Jingyuan also silently removed Su Miaomiao\u2019s hand from Gu Jialing\u2019s head.\nTang Shiwei and Grandma Tao looked at each other and smiled.\nSu Miaomiao finally sat down in her seat and picked up chopsticks to eat noodles.\nGu Jialing was full of complaints but could only swallow his anger.\nTang Shiwei looked at his aggrieved look, and said something fair, \u201cJia Ling prepared the birthday gifts with the most care, Miaomiao, you three have to learn a little bit, don\u2019t be so perfunctory next year.\u201d\nGu Jialing took a deep breath and finally felt better.\nXie Jingyuan nodded. He guessed that Xu Shou\u2019s gift would be special, and Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing were probably lazy, so he didn\u2019t expect anything from them.\nSince Gu Jialing liked \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d series, he would arrange a character based on Gu Jialing for the third part to be prepared that summer.\nXu Shou also felt that he had misjudged Gu Jialing, and to make up for it, he gave him Gu the stewed chicken legs.\nGu Jialing wasn\u2019t hungry, so he put the chicken legs back and snorted, \u201cI don\u2019t have any shortage of meat. You do the cleaning duty for the next three weeks for me.\u201d\nXu Shou agreed.\nGu Jialing looked at Su Miaomiao suggestively.\nSu Miaomiao said confidently, \u201cI can help you rub your hair a few more times.\u201d\nGu Jialing said, \u201cNo need! I\u2019m not a cat, and I\u2019m not a dog either!\u201d\nOnly cats and dogs liked to be petted, he didn\u2019t need it!\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWorried that he would slip up the secret, Xie Jingyuan stepped on Gu Jialing under the table.\nGu Jialing immediately cast a resentful look at him. In his previous life, the Taoist master must have often touched the cat\u2019s head, which caused her to treat \u201ctouching the head\u201d as a reward.\nUnfortunately, Xie Jingyuan did not understand his deep meaning.\nEven if he understood it, Xie Jingyuan had a clear conscience, because he had never touched Su Miaomiao\u2019s head.\nKnowing that she was a female demon, how could he do that kind of intimate behavior?\nAfter breakfast, seven people divided into two groups went to the photography store.\nThe boys took Su Mingan\u2019s car, Su Miaomiao and Grandma Tao took Tang Shiwei\u2019s car, and the two cars drove one after the other.\nAt that time, Tang Shiwei asked her daughter curiously, \u201cMiaomiao, why did Jialing give you such an expensive gift?\u201d\nGrandma Tao also wanted to know the answer.\nGiving expensive gifts did not necessarily represent sincerity, but Gu Jialing gave Xu Shou and her grandson cheap gifts, and Miaomiao\u2019s gift suddenly became more expensive. So it was hard not to misunderstand.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cBecause I like jewelry, didn\u2019t you say that he gave the most thoughtful gifts? Of course he gave me what I like.\u201d\nGrandma Tao nodded. That was indeed the truth. The Gu family was rich, and pearl earrings were probably not that expensive in his eyes.\nThe most important thing was that every weekend Grandma Tao would watch the four children do their homework together, she really didn\u2019t see Gu Jialing\u2019s love for Su Miaomiao.\nTang Shiwei also accepted that statement, but still told her daughter, \u201cNext time, it\u2019s not appropriate to accept such an expensive gift. You are both students, and your parents have to pay living expenses. When giving gifts, you must give what you can yourself.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOh, I see.\u201d\nIn the car ahead, Su Mingan was also thinking about that matter. The pearl earrings given by Gu Jialing flashed in his mind, and the scene of his daughter smiling and rubbing Gu Jialing\u2019s head flashed for a while.\nHe looked at Xie Jingyuan from the rearview mirror suspiciously. If Gu Jialing really wanted to pursue his daughter, would Xie Jingyuan be able to bear it?\n\u201cUncle, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nWhen their gazes met in the mirror, Xie Jingyuan took the initiative to ask.\nSu Mingan smiled awkwardly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m just wondering why the three of you are so quiet.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Xu Shou. He didn\u2019t talk much at first, but Gu Jialing was still sullen about the gift.\n\u201cUncle, there are a lot of cars on weekends, so please pay attention to the road,\u201d Xu Shou suddenly said.\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nVery good, he, an old driver, was actually taught a lesson by a high school student!\nAfter the car was parked, Tang Shiwei got out of the car, and found that her husband in front seemed to be holding his breath.\nShe quietly asked for the reason.\nSu Mingan complained about the three high school students, one seduced his daughter into puppy love, one was suspected of having a crush on his daughter, and the other scolded him.\nTang Shiwei: \u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s talk about it when we get home, don\u2019t think about it too much.\u201d\nSeven people entered the photography store in a mighty manner.\nSu Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s birthday commemorative photos after they entered junior high school were all taken in that store. They were considered regular customers, and the store manager came to entertain them in person.\nEveryone was familiar with the process, so they chose clothes first.\nBecause she still needed to do hair and makeup, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t have the patience to change frequently. In the past two years, she basically only picked one set of clothes.\nSu Miaomiao was vacillating in two clothes, one was a pure white Hanfu, and the other was a modern pure white fairy skirt.\nGu Jialing whispered, \u201cYou just like white.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When Grandma Tao saw the caller ID, it turned out to be her son\u2019s name\u2014\u2014Xie Rong.\nHow much did her grandson not want to see this father?\nGrandma Tao sighed in her heart, and raised her phone, \u201cIt\u2019s me, we\u2019re in the photography store, and Jing Yuan and the others went to change clothes.\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cOh, you were going to take photos this year, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cIf I had told you, would you come here? We will feel sorry to disturb you, a busy person like you who makes a lot of money every minute.\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cMom, look at you, you are still scolding me.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cHmph, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cIt\u2019s Jing Yuan\u2019s birthday, I want to say happy birthday to him.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cGot it, I\u2019ll tell him later.\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cI transferred a sum of money to you. You can take the children to have fun for a day. There are also birthday gifts. The assistant will deliver them for me in the evening.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cThen prepare two more, it\u2019s also Jia Ling and Xu Shou\u2019s birthdays today.\u201d\nXie Rong: \u201cWhat a coincidence. No wonder the four of them have a good relationship.\u201d\nGrandma Tao chatted with her son impatiently for a while, and after hanging up the call, she curled her lips at Su Mingan and his wife, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m partial, I think you two are more like my son and daughter-in-law, and also more like Jing Yuan\u2019s parents.\u201d\nSu Mingan coaxed the old lady, \u201cWe are not as filial as Lao Xie, how much does he give you a year? You think we are good because you are not short of money now.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cBesides, with our abilities, we can\u2019t give birth to a child as smart as Jing Yuan.\u201d\nGrandma Tao was amused by the couple.\nThe three boys came out first. They were all about 1.8 meters tall in loose Hanfu. They didn\u2019t wear much makeup, just had their hair styled long.\nGu Jialing smiled like a spring breeze, Xu Shou was calm and introverted, and Xie Jingyuan was immortal.\nTang Shiwei nodded secretly, although they were all handsome, but Xie Jingyuan was the best. Her daughter had really good eyesight.\n\u201cWhy are you carrying a sword?\u201d Grandma Tao asked her grandson with a smile.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing said, \u201cI matched it with the clothes so it can make him look more like a real Taoist master.\u201d\nGrandma Tao smiled and nodded. Her grandson was so handsome, much better than her son when he was young.\nThe three went to take a single photo for each person first.\nThe photography store had its own landscaping, bamboo, gazebo, flowing water, and antiques.\nXie Jingyuan sat in the gazebo, accepting the photographer\u2019s guidance with a blank face.\nHis kind was the easiest to shoot. When the photographer was about to call it a day, Su Miaomiao walked over.\nXie Jingyuan turned his head following the photographer\u2019s line of sight, and saw her in a pure white dress.\nModern people didn\u2019t have enough temperament in ancient costumes, but Su Miaomiao looked natural, as if she really just traveled from ancient times.\nThe white clothes were simple and elegant, and she only wore light makeup. A wooden apricot flower hairpin was inserted in her hair.\nXie Jingyuan suddenly thought of one night.\nShe quietly came out of his window in human form, dressed in moonlight, and fawningly handed in the scriptures she copied for him to read.\nXie Jingyuan just lowered his eyes, and reprimanded her in a cold voice, telling her to quickly change back to her original form, so as not to be caught by the little Taoist masters and mess up her practice.\n\u201cMiaomiao, where do you want to shoot?\u201d The photographer asked enthusiastically. It was much more comfortable to photograph a smiling beauty who really liked photography than a cold and handsome guy.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t look at Xie Jingyuan at all. She went directly to the lotus pond, and wanted to pose as if she was sitting on the bank watching the fish.\nThe photographer cooperated and took pictures from all angles.\nSu Miaomiao finished, thinking that she would take a group photo with Xie Jingyuan every year, so she took a fake lotus and walked briskly toward the gazebo.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes again.\nHe was sitting behind a table, holding a book in his hand, and there were pens, ink, and paper placed on the coffee table.\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, then sat on the left side of the table, resting her chin with her hands lazily, pretending to be watching him lecture.\nWhen she was a cat, she also liked to listen to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s lectures, but at that time she was a cat and could lie beside him.\nJust as the photographer finished taking pictures of the two of them, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing also came.\nProbably they also recalled the scene of the three demons listening to scriptures together. Xu Shou and Gu Jialing knelt side by side opposite Su Miaomiao, looking at Xie Jingyuan devoutly.\nThe photographer took a few more pictures of the four of them together.\nIn fact, the photographer had a strange feeling.\nThose three handsome men and beauty were obviously only high school students. In that pose, no matter the posture or the expression, they were more contagious than the actors in the historical drama.\nThe most special thing was the boy in white clothes, no matter in the single photo or the group photo, his expression was really the same.\nA series of photos were quickly delivered to them.\nOnly when Xie Jingyuan was alone in the room did he take out the group photo of the four of them and looked at it carefully for a long time before putting it in the special locker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "97": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-97/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third grade, winter vacation.\nThat year\u2019s Spring Festival movies had a very good reputation. \u201cSuppressing the Demons: Black Snake\u201d was adapted from a popular fantasy novel, directed by a famous director, and played by a group of powerful actors. The scenes, fantastic special effects, and the screenplay of any shot that could be used as a screensaver made it the box office champion in the first place.\nIt was only ten o\u2019clock in the morning, and a group of spectators had already gathered in the cinema waiting for the movie to begin.\nSu Miaomiao picked an empty small table, pulled out a black chair and sat down.\nA new message notification sounded on the phone. She took it out to see that it was from Gu Jialing.\nLittle Blue Bird: Are you home yet?\nSu Miaomiao: I came back yesterday afternoon.\nLittle Blue Bird: Did you go to see the Taoist master\u2019s movie? Want me to spoil it?\nSu Miaomiao: There is nothing to spoil, I have read all the novels.\nLittle Blue Bird: The movie will definitely be different to a certain extent, forget it, you will know after watching it for yourself\u2026\nGu Jialing talked a lot and typed quickly, messages popped up one by one, before Su Miaomiao finished reading, someone suddenly sat next to her.\nShe looked up and saw two young men with dyed yellow hair. Their appearance was not bad among human beings, one was wearing earring and the other was wearing studs.\n\u201cBeauty, did you come by yourself?\u201d The man with the earring raised his eyebrows at her, and his eyes obviously scrutinized her face carefully.\nSu Miaomiao could smell the smoke from the two of them, which was a very disgusting smell.\nShe glared at them, stood up with her phone, and sat down in another place.\nThe two men actually followed over again, and one of them directly handed the phone in front of Su Miaomiao, \u201cLittle sister, can I add your WeChat account?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao frowned.\nThe man with studs smiled.\nJust when he was still collecting the tickets, he noticed this little beauty, wearing an off-white skirt with a white sweater on it, so white that it seemed to glow. At that time, she was looking for a seat behind their backs, and she only showed her face when she sat down. Her skin was soft and fair, her eyes were big, and her lips were rosy. She had the kind of appearance that made her look very obedient, timid and easy to bully. Even if she got angry, she had no deterrent effect .\nThe two boys with yellow hair who were not easy to mess with at first glance blocked Su Miaomiao\u2019s way from left to right.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t do anything, because doing it may hurt the two of them, and if there was a fight, it would delay her watching the movie.\nBut she didn\u2019t want to talk to them either.\nSu Miaomiao sent a video called request to Gu Jialing.\nThe two were chatting, but Gu Jialing picked it up almost instantly. He didn\u2019t see Su Miaomiao\u2019s face, but when the camera turned, two strangers with yellow hair appeared.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThese two people are stinky, and they chased after me for WeChat, you can scold them for me.\u201d\nGu Jialing really didn\u2019t think Su Miaomiao was beautiful at all, but he also knew that almost all human men liked her.\nIt was just that they were usually by Su Miaomiao\u2019s side, so it was rare to encounter such a situation.\nGu Jialing first asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cWhere is the Taoist master?\u201d\nIt was easy to argue that he was afraid that the two of them would attack Su Miaomiao once they were angered. The cat was protected by the priest and Gu Jialing didn\u2019t know her strength.\nSu Miaomiao adjusted the phone lens.\nGu Jialing saw the Taoist master standing in the queue waiting to buy ice cream and popcorn, holding Su Miaomiao\u2019s white down jacket. The Taoist master was there, there was no need to worry about the future!\nGu Jialing asked Su Miaomiao to turn up the volume of the phone, followed him as if he was there, and made a personal attack on the two men from various angles without profanity, \u201cYou actually dyed your hair yellow, you know this yellow looks like a the color of the back of a bird\u2019s butt, right?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the dark circles under your eyes. Did you stay up late last night playing games? Let me tell you, girls like sunny and handsome men. You who are likely to be hooked by accidents at any time should be more self-aware!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, look at me with your eyes wide open. You are not even as good as me, yet you still dare to provoke her? Is it the courage that Liang Jingru (power of love songs) gave you?\u201d\nSome young people around were amused by Gu Jialing\u2019s scolding.\nThe man with earring and the man with studs had seen Gu Jialing\u2019s tricks before, impatient to listen any longer, and reached out to snatch Su Miaomiao\u2019s phone.\nSu Miaomiao quickly avoided them.\nJust when she was about to fight back, she heard Xie Jingyuan\u2019s voice, \u201cCome here.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao snorted, avoided the hands of the two smoking men, and walked briskly to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side.\nHe continued to line up while looking at the two men who came over.\nIf they had known that Su Miaomiao had a boyfriend earlier, the two men might not have come to strike up a conversation, but they had just been scolded in front of everyone and lost face, so naturally they had to fight Xie Jingyuan. Especially since Xie Jingyuan was tall , but looked like a cultural person, and his combat effectiveness would definitely not be good.\n\u201cIs she your girlfriend? She scolded us just now, what do you say?\u201d The man with the earring said provocatively.\nXie Jingyuan asked Su Miaomiao to stand in the line, then he came out and asked the two of them indifferently, \u201cDo you want to fight?\u201d\nThe man with the earring sneered, \u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cLet\u2019s go to the restroom.\u201d\nThe man with the earring and the man with the studs actually went with him. There were so many people outside and there were surveillance cameras, they were not serious about it.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s tolerance for such blatant bullies was also limited.\nHe wouldn\u2019t injure them, but they must learn a lesson, and it was best to achieve the effect that they would not dare to commit crimes again in the future.\nFrom the time the three of them left to when Xie Jingyuan came back alone, a total of two minutes must have passed.\nSu Miaomiao was already standing in front of the counter, ordering, and when she was about to pay, Xie Jingyuan stretched out his phone to scan the QR code for her.\nSu Miaomiao sniffed and was satisfied that she didn\u2019t smell any smoke on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "98": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-98/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t take the episode to heart at all, she didn\u2019t expect that when she followed Xie Jingyuan to the giant screen, she saw the two men walking out from the restroom, supporting each other.\nWhen Su Miaomiao stared at them, the men shivered. They didn\u2019t watch the movie, and left the movie theater in despair.\nSu Miaomiao whispered, \u201cIn the previous life, I\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said indifferently, \u201cIt is not allowed to kill, nor can it be harvested.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked her eyes and swallowed back the harsh words.\nThe movie theater was dimly lit, and the two seats were in the middle of the seventh row, next to each other.\nTen minutes before the opening, the audience entered the arena one after another. On Su Miaomiao\u2019s right side was Xie Jingyuan, and on the left were three girls who were watching the movie together, each holding a cup of milk tea.\nSeeing that, she said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cI want to drink milk tea too.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked around, there didn\u2019t seem to be any gangsters, so he took the time to buy her milk tea.\n\u201cWow, your boyfriend is so kind to you,\u201d the girl next to her said enviously.\nThat kind of misunderstanding was too much, Su Miaomiao went from explaining to being too lazy to explain to being upset, and now she had progressed to the state of calmness.\n\u00a0She just smiled and started eating ice cream.\nSu Miaomiao had already finished eating the ice cream before the movie started.\nXie Jingyuan opened the small bag he carried with him and asked her to put the ice cream box in.\nAs soon as the lights went off, the movie started.\nSu Miaomiao was still eating popcorn, but when the brightly colored and beautiful scenery on the screen gradually shifted to a large lake that looked deep, she gradually stopped. When the scene entered the lake, a shadow of a behemoth appeared dimly. When the camera got closer, accompanied by sound effects without warning, the behemoth suddenly opened a pair of dark yellow bloodshot eyes.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHolding the popcorn, she quickly moved to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t even react, Su Miaomiao had already shrunk into his arms, holding the popcorn in one hand and holding his arm tightly with the other.\nThe screen had changed to a lively ancient town.\nXie Jingyuan also felt that Su Miaomiao in his arms gradually relaxed.\n\u201cWhy do you have the guts to watch this kind of movie?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun for people.\u201d\nSome whispers came from behind, Xie Jingyuan pursed his lips.\nHe had watched many movies with Su Miaomiao, including the ghost movies selected by Cheng Yue and the others. Whether it was a female ghost with disheveled hair or a ghastly murderer, Su Miaomiao was never afraid.\nHe thought she was really courageous, but he didn\u2019t expect that she was actually afraid of such a terrifying demon.\nIn fact, that was very reasonable, after all, in her previous life, she was just a little cat demon who was nothing more than ordinary among demons.\n\u201cOkay, go back to your seat,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said in a low voice as much as possible.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cIt would definitely come out later.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThere are such posters outside, why aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThe poster didn\u2019t move, and the snake on the poster didn\u2019t look that big.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u2026\nThe poster was not big because the leading actors were doing publicity poses.\nHe wanted to persuade her again, but Su Miaomiao ate popcorn. He tried to push her, but she leaned even tighter.\nXie Jingyuan had to lean all the way back in his chair. The screen was constantly changing in front of his eyes, but it was difficult for him to concentrate on the plot.\nWhen the old Taoist and the young Taoist set out to get rid of the demon, Su Miaomiao finished eating the popcorn.\nXie Jingyuan took out a wet tissue from his pocket and asked her to wipe her hands.\nSu Miaomiao wiped her hands clean, because the atmosphere became more dignified, and she became more nervous, so she pressed herself against Xie Jingyuan\u2019s body, with her arms around his neck.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t watch anymore, let\u2019s go out first.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head. Although she was very afraid of the snake demon, she also wanted to see what would happen next, there was also a poor rabbit demon.\nXie Jingyuan looked to one side, and found that some girls covered their eyes with their hands.\nThe rabbit demon appeared, and the snow-white rabbit was pinched by the hunter\u2019s trap, and curled up pitifully on the ground.\nThe young Taoist master was kind-hearted, bent down and let the rabbit demon out, and took out a handkerchief to bind the rabbit demon\u2019s wound.\nSu Miaomiao was suddenly curious and asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, have you ever saved a rabbit?\u201d\nAfter Gu Jialing knew that \u201cSuppressing the Demons\u201d was written by the Taoist master, he told her that the little Taoist master in the book was Xie Jingyuan.\nIt was not allowed to talk loudly in the movie theater, so Su Miaomiao almost whispered into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s ear, her soft lips seemed to touch him.\nXie Jingyuan tilted his head, slightly distanced himself and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nHe just narrated some real experiences of Taoist masters eliminating demons. The demons were real, and other characters and their interactions were fictional.\nIf he didn\u2019t want to make money to support the three demons, he wouldn\u2019t write a book at all.\nThe book was fiction, and the movie was slightly adapted on the basis of fiction, such as the hazy relationship between the little Taoist master and the rabbit demon.\nWhen Su Miaomiao was reading the novel, she had lamented the tragic death of the rabbit demon. So seeing with her own eyes that the rabbit, who was almost as weak as her, was swallowed into the bloody mouth of the black snake, Su Miaomiao closed her eyes and buried her head in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder.\nXie Jingyuan felt a strange wetness.\nHe had no choice but to raise his hand and rub her head gently.\nShe watched the rest of the snake killing scene through her fingers. When the huge black snake finally fell heavily on the ground, her tense body completely relaxed.\nThe little Taoist master went down the mountain with the injured old Taoist on his back. The background music was playing, the movie was over, and the lights turned on.\nSu Miaomiao was still limply in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms, digesting the shock brought by the movie.\nXie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t bear other people\u2019s gaze. He lowered his head to clean up the popcorn crumbs on the seat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "99": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-99/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the audience was almost gone, Su Miaomiao took out her phone and called Gu Jialing to exchange impressions.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThe movie is pretty good, but the little Taoist master is not as good as the Taoist master. If I were a rabbit demon, he wouldn\u2019t let me die for him.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cIt\u2019s as if you are willing to die for the Taoist master.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan, who was walking behind, heard the sentence, and cast his eyes on Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao was smiling, Gu Jialing\u2019s joke had its due effect on her.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao walked out of the cinema holding Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arm, it was just twelve at noon.\nOn the third day of the first lunar month, few restaurants in the shopping mall were open. When they set off, they told Grandma Tao that they wanted to go back for lunch.\nThe movie theater was only more than one kilometer away from Pearl Garden, so Xie Jingyuan chose to ride a bicycle.\nSu Miaomiao jumped into the back seat, with her left hand in the pocket of her down jacket, and her right arm around Xie Jingyuan\u2019s waist.\nThere were not many vehicles on the road, probably the people who went back to their hometown for the New Year had not returned yet.\n\u201cTaoist Master, will the second and third parts of \u2018Suppressing the Demons\u2019 be filmed?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked suddenly after being quiet for a while.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYes.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou are amazing, the box office of the first film is so high, will the other two be sold for more money?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI signed it out before the release, so I can\u2019t take advantage of it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was a little disappointed, \u201cWhat about the fourth part? Are you going to write it after the college entrance examination?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYes.\u201d\nHe planned a total of seven volumes, which would be completed just before graduation, so that his work after graduation would not be delayed.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cHave you decided what to write? You have already written about Gu Jialing in the third part, so this time you will include me too?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWhat can you do? Help Taoist masters eliminate demons, or help demons deal with Taoist masters?\u201d\nThe third part of \u2018Suppressing the Demons\u2019 was about subduing the divine bird Suzaku. Gu Jialing\u2019s role was an ear-returning God next to Suzaku, and there were not many scenes.\nSu Miaomiao thought hard and came up with an idea, \u201cJust write that they encountered a white cat when they entered the mountain. You don\u2019t need to give a plot, just describe the white cat\u2019s beauty.\u201d\nThe corners of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s lips raised.\nIn 1002, Grandma Tao made four special dishes with two meat and two vegetables.\nThe two helped to bring out the food, and it was time to eat.\nGrandma Tao said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cThe weather forecast says it will be sunny, let\u2019s take all the quilts at home to the roof to dry. When are your friends coming back?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cOn fifth.\u201d\nSenior high school students had only ten days of winter vacation and school would start on January seventh.\nGrandma Tao opened the calendar on her phone, looked at the two children, and joked, \u201cIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, the fifth day of the lunar new year. It\u2019s a coincidence that they will come back on the same day.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was gnawing on the ribs. When she heard that, she didn\u2019t even bat an eyelid, she could eat whatever she wanted.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the old lady helplessly, \u201cDon\u2019t say that in front of them.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cI know, I know, the two of them haven\u2019t figured it out yet, of course I will keep it a secret for you.\u201d\nAfter eating, Su Miaomiao went to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room to do homework for the winter vacation, and when Xie Jingyuan finished cleaning the kitchen and came over, she looked at the open door and asked in a low voice, \u201cTaoist Master, are you really planning to marry in your life? \u201c\nXie Jingyuan sat on another chair and entered the password of the notebook without raising his eyes, \u201cWhy are you asking me that?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI heard from my cousin that grandparents like to urge their grandchildren for marriage. Grandma has only you. If you never get married, she will be anxious.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cShe is an open-minded person, she would not force me to do things I don\u2019t like.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded. Grandma Tao was really nice. When she was a child, other old ladies and fathers disliked her for being lazy and always sleeping. They suggested that Grandma Tao take care of her cruelly, but she didn\u2019t listen and allowed her to do what she liked all the time. Feng Xiaoyu\u2019s grandma was very annoying. Sometimes she asked Feng Xiaoyu to clean the room, and sometimes she didn\u2019t listen to her.\n\u201cWill you get married?\u201d Since that topic was brought up, Xie Jingyuan asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cIf uncle and aunt urge you to marry, what will you do?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, and said, \u201cIf they can help me find a man who looks good, cooks delicious food, smells good and is obedient to me, then I will marry him.\u201d\nThere were many troublesome things in human life, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to do everything by herself. She was also used to being taken care of, like cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the room and even driving, someone always had to do it for her.\nHer parents would get old, she had to be a filial daughter, and couldn\u2019t trouble her parents. At that time, she would need a husband who was as considerate and gentle as her father.\nIf she found the right one, she would get married. If she couldn\u2019t find one, she would continue to rely on the Taoist master. Anyway, the Taoist master could do those things.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t expect her, a reincarnated demon, to accept human marriage so easily.\nIt was only\u2026\u2026\n\u201cYour requirements may be too high,\u201d Xie Jingyuan helped her analyze objectively.\nGood looks, good cooking skills, and good smell were fairly easy to achieve. It may be possible for a man to be obedient to a woman for a short time, but it would be difficult for a long time.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, my maternal grandfather, my paternal grandfather, and father are all such men.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter a moment of silence, he looked at Su Miaomiao and asked, \u201cIf you meet someone who meets your requirements, will you absorb his yang?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cCultivation is not allowed in this world, so why should I do such a thing that damages my merits?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan could see that she was sincere, and looked away, \u201cDo your homework.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Should I be as serious as you and the Taoist master? Then what\u2019s the fun in life, grandma, what do you think?\u201d\nGrandma Tao liked that kind of excitement the most, and she supported Gu Jialing, \u201cChildren your age should be more lively.\u201d\nGu Jialing walked over and hugged Grandma Tao.\nGrandma Tao was very happy, but also a little regretful of why she didn\u2019t meet so many handsome boys when she was young.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing went to their rooms to put the suitcases first, and then returned to the living room. Gu Jialing deliberately asked Xie Jingyuan quietly when Grandma Tao was not around, \u201cWhat happened to those two little gangsters you met in the movie theater?\u201d\nXu Shou frowned, did the Taoist master meet gangsters?\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI have already taught them a lesson.\u201d\nGu Jialing first despised the two little gangsters, and soon mentioned Su Miaomiao, \u201cShe has become more like Su Daji in the past two years. I heard that dating is not prohibited in college, and there will definitely be more people who will pester her. Hey, Taoist Master, is Su Miaomiao good at fighting?\u201d\nNo matter what, the three of them were Qingxu Temple\u2019s demons. It didn\u2019t matter how they made trouble with each other, but if people outside bullied Su Miaomiao, Gu Jialing would be the first to be upset.\nXie Jingyuan was really not sure about Su Miaomiao\u2019s current level of fighting. When she was in kindergarten and elementary school, she was strong enough to dominate.\nGu Jialing stood up, walked out and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to discuss with her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan called him, \u201cShe is sleeping, we will talk about it when she comes over.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at the clock hanging in the living room in disbelief, \u201cWhat time is it? Taoist Master, you can\u2019t be so biased. I can\u2019t sleep until seven o\u2019clock on weekends!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cShe ran five kilometers in the morning.\u201d\nGu Jialing immediately stopped barking. It was still winter, so cold, it was good enough for a cat to keep exercising every day.\nSu Miaomiao slept until ten o\u2019clock, woke up, washed her face, changed her clothes and went to 1002.\nSeeing Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, Su Miaomiao thought of something, went back home, brought back two red envelopes, and gave each of them one, \u201cThis is the good luck money my parents left for you.\u201d\nGu Jialing opened it to take a look, and there were ten red tickets inside.\nXu Shou had the same.\nIn fact, in the countryside where Xu Shou lived, no one gave good lucky money for a child of his age. Throughout high school, only Grandma Tao and the cat\u2019s parents had been giving him lucky money.\nIt was useless to be polite, and Xu Shou accepted it silently.\nHe couldn\u2019t repay the cat\u2019s parents for the time being, he could only help them take care of Su Miaomiao. If there were any more gangsters to pester her, Xu Shou would never let them go.\nEven without the cat\u2019s parents, Xu Shou would not sit back and watch Su Miaomiao or any weaklings be bullied.\n\u201cHey, let\u2019s go out for a stroll. School will start the day after tomorrow. If we don\u2019t go out, we won\u2019t have a chance,\u201d Gu Jialing stood on the balcony, looking outside like a bird trapped in a cage.\nGrandma Tao said, \u201cGo have fun before school starts.\u201d\nThe four children were all top students, but their elders were worried that they wouldn\u2019t have enough rest.\nXie Jingyuan had no choice but to take the three demons out.\nThere was a lakeside park three kilometers away. Gu Jialing wanted to take a taxi, but Xie Jingyuan suggested riding the bicycle.\nThe purpose of going out was to breathe fresh air, and they would be trapped in a small space if they took a taxi.\nGu Jialing\u2019s objection was invalid, so the three boys went to pick up the bicycle. Because school was about to start, Grandma Tao helped Xu Shou and Gu Jialing clean their bicycles.\n\u201cAre you going to sit behind me today?\u201d Gu Jialing was the first to ride over, and stopped beside Su Miaomiao, and invited her.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhy?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day today. If the Taoist master takes you, people will misunderstand that you two are lovers. It will look like Xu Shou and I are so pitiful. It doesn\u2019t matter if Xu Shou is really single, I don\u2019t want to be sympathized with.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan who was behind.\nGu Jialing immediately said, \u201cYou follow me today, and I will give you my earrings, the ones you have always wanted.\u201d\nBecause the Taoist master forbade him to wear earrings, his pierced ear was already filled, so Gu Jialing didn\u2019t bother to pierce it again.\nHe was not like a cat, if he couldn\u2019t show off with earrings, what was the use of collecting them?\nAs soon as Gu Jialing finished speaking, Su Miaomiao jumped onto his back seat with a smile, wrapping her arms around his waist.\nIt was the most comfortable to hug and lean like that, but unfortunately the Taoist master only allowed her to hug with one hand at most.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\nJust as Xie Jingyuan frowned and was about to speak, Gu Jialing whistled and drove his fake girlfriend away.\nXie Jingyuan pursed his lips, and chased after Xu Shou side by side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As for the most beautiful string, Su Miaomiao had already snatched it away.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked Xu Shou.\nXu Shou shook his head. Roasted sweet potatoes were fine, he couldn\u2019t stand that kind of sour and sweet snack.\nThe four walked slowly along the lake.\nThere were student-aged couples around, young couples playing with their children, and elderly people playing Tai Chi, full of the breath of life in the human world.\nA three or four-year-old girl suddenly stopped chasing and stared at the candied haws in Gu Jialing and Su Miaomiao\u2019s hand.\nSu Miaomiao immediately went around to the other side of Xie Jingyuan.\nGu Jialing: \u201cLook at how stingy you are.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIf you are not stingy, then give her your candied haws.\u201d\nGu Jialing snorted.\nXie Jingyuan recalled the issues he had discussed with Su Miaomiao, and asked Xu Shou and Gu Jialing in the same way, \u201cWill you consider getting married in the future?\u201d\nXu Shou immediately shook his head. He was a demon, how could he marry a human woman? Even if the Taoist master allowed him, he would not be able to pass the hurdle in his heart.\nGu Jialing was not interested in human girls, let alone getting married and having children, so he gave them some knowledge, \u201cBirds are very good at laying eggs. There are at least five or six eggs in a nest, and there can be more than a dozen such births. Once I retain this fertility, if I marry a wife and conceive seven or eight babies at once, how will I live anymore? The way humans raise babies is harder than taking care of birds.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was inspired and recalled, \u201cThe cats I have seen seem to have three or five kittens. My mother is not very good, so she only gave birth to me and my brother.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cYou also had an older brother?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWell, he was especially good at eating, and he was stronger than me. He was taken away only two months after, and I never saw him again.\u201d\nHer brother was quite stupid. He could help people catch mice, but he may not be able to activate his spiritual wisdom and must have died a long time ago.\nXu Shou asked sympathetically, \u201cDo you miss him?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t think about him at all. He always grabbed food from me. I could only eat when he left.\u201d\nGu Jialing was very proud, \u201cI am the strongest and the smartest among my thirteen brothers and sisters. I am the only one who has become a demon.\u201d\nXu Shou didn\u2019t have much to remember. He didn\u2019t know who his father was, and his mother only gave birth to one child. The mother and son stayed in the village to look after the house, and it was not that bad. Later, the mother passed away peacefully.\nThe three demons chatted about their respective families, and suddenly looked at Xie Jingyuan in unison.\nXie Jingyuan said lightly, \u201cI forgot, I have been in Qingxu Temple since I can remember.\u201d\nThat was a lie, but it was enough to fool the three demons.\nThe four chatted and walked around, and when the candied haws were finished, they also came to an empty and uninhabited lot.\nGu Jialing ran to throw out the trash, and came back to ask Su Miaomiao, \u201cIf the priest wasn\u2019t there that day, would you have beaten those two little bastards?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOf course.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate men, come here, let\u2019s try.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They could fly as much as they could, jump as much as they could, and their claws and teeth were all weapons.\nAfter being reincarnated, they just went to school step by step like ordinary children, without any special training.\nGu Jialing had at least fought with boys, while Su Miaomiao had very little experience.\nShe jumped up to grab Gu Jialing\u2019s face.\nWhen playing around, Gu Jialing would only avoid her, but he directly grabbed Su Miaomiao\u2019s two arms and turned her around.\nWith her hands trapped, Su Miaomiao quickly moved her foot back.\n\u201cD-mn it!\u201d Gu Jialing had to let go of her and jumped back, narrowly avoiding it.\nThat was to say, if he were an ordinary person, he would definitely not be able to avoid Su Miaomiao\u2019s speed.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Xie Jingyuan interrupted.\nGu Jialing walked up to Xu Shou with lingering fear, and Su Miaomiao muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s not decided yet.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou guys\u2019 style of fighting is not that good. I will teach you how to fight during the summer vacation.\u201d\nGu Jialing had a shocked face, \u201cTaoist Master , why do you seem to know everything?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was not surprised at all, after all, Xie Jingyuan had been fond of reading since he was two years old, and he had already learned to use the computer in kindergarten.\nOn the seventh day of the first lunar month, senior high school students were the first to return.\nBecause of the four people\u2019s good grades and the fact that they were already a well-known small group of top students throughout the grade, they were still assigned to Class 9.\nFor Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan, another good friend came in Class 9\u2014Lin Xi.\nLin Xi was a top student when he was in junior high school. After he entered high school, his level of top student went up to another level. He had surpassed Xu Shou twice in a row, and he was firmly seated in second place.\nIf it was Gu Jialing, he would probably be jealous, but Xu Shou would not be, and would only continue to study hard.\nLin Xi was also 1.8 meters tall, and he was not short-sighted, so his seat was at the back.\nIn the classroom, there were two people at a table, and they needed to be adjusted along the horizontal direction once a week to protect the eyesight of the students.\nAfter that adjustment, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou sat on the right side of Xie Jingyuan, and Lin Xi and another classmate sat on the left side of Su Miaomiao, separated only by a narrow aisle.Su Miaomiao walked to the seat with her bag in her hand, and found that her desk was clean without any dust.\nShe looked at Lin Xi in surprise, \u201cDid you clean the table for me again?\u201d\nLin Xi smiled and said, \u201cI came early, so I wiped everything for you.\u201d\nGu Jialing reached out and touched her desktop, it was indeed clean.\n\u201cThank you, you are really a good person!\u201d Gu Jialing waved to Lin Xi.\nLin Xi smiled and continued to read.\nSu Miaomiao sat on the seat, took out the textbooks, exercise books, etc. and arranged them. She looked at the blackboard, but was a little sleepy.\nAlthough the winter vacation was only seven days long, Su Miaomiao slackened off from the high-intensity study for the time being.\nShe glanced at Xie Jingyuan, and asked in a low voice, \u201cMaster, can I sleep for a while?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cSleep after class.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao protested, \u201cI\u2019ve been recommended, why are you still so strict?\u201d\nThe goal of the four-person college entrance examination was Beijing University. Last summer, after Su Miaomiao won the domestic youth tennis championship, she was admitted to Beijing University ahead of schedule, and they promised to let her choose a major.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThis is classroom discipline.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao snorted, turned her head to look to the other side, and saw Lin Xi.\nBeing so close, of course Lin Xi heard their conversation.\nWhen she was in junior high school, Lin Xi, like Cheng Yue and others, agreed that Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan were in a relationship. They were in the same class in the first and second grade of senior high school, and Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan were inseparable all year round. Lin Xi also continued to maintain that default.\nIt wasn\u2019t until everyone was assigned to the same class again in the third year of high school that Lin Xi suddenly discovered something was wrong after observation.\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, no one was a child anymore. But the way Su Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan was not much different from seeing them, it was clear and magnanimous.\nSu Miaomiao would instruct Xie Jingyuan to do all kinds of trivial things, such as fetching water for her and doing sanitation duty. But when Xie Jingyuan was called to the office by the class teacher to talk, she would also ask him to do the same thing, as if he and Xie Jingyuan had a similar existence in her heart.\nThat discovery made Lin Xi jump with joy.\nHe even sent Su Miaomiao a message one night, asking if she and Xie Jingyuan were in a relationship.\nSu Miaomiao replied to him: No, you can misunderstand, but don\u2019t ask me again, I will be annoyed.\nLin Xi memorized the reply deeply in his mind, and he knew it more clearly than the ancient poems he memorized.\nHowever, the college entrance examination was coming soon, Lin Xi didn\u2019t want to be distracted. If he couldn\u2019t be admitted to the same university as Su Miaomiao, it would be useless to think about it.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t get enough sleep last night?\u201d Facing Su Miaomiao\u2019s dissatisfied gaze, Lin Xi asked with a smile.\nSu Miaomiao was in a bad mood and didn\u2019t want to talk.\nLin Xi took out a candy from his pocket and handed it to her, \u201cThis tastes good, and it can refresh your mind.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao took it, and there was a lemon pattern on the candy packaging bag.\nShe hesitated, \u201cWill it be very sour?\u201d\nLin Xi: \u201cSlightly sour, but just right.\u201d\nShe tore open the package and put the candy in her mouth.\nSeeing that she was quite satisfied, Lin Xi continued to do the questions.\nSu Miaomiao had candy, so she didn\u2019t want to sleep anymore. She took out a set of Chinese test papers.\nThe moment she lowered her head, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cold side face was revealed, and his gaze swept across Lin Xi\u2019s side.\nLin Xi didn\u2019t notice it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But it may be that the students at the bottom of the class would make them seem naughty. Next to him, he used Lin Xi\u2019s head to cover himself, then lowered his voice and said, \u201cYou like Su Miaomiao, don\u2019t you? Her genuine boyfriend is sitting next to her, how dare you give her candy?\u201d\nLin Xi didn\u2019t look sideways, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\nClassmate He: \u201cWho\u2019s talking nonsense? I\u2019ve been observing for half a semester. You are simply a professional prying the wall. You only interact with Su Miaomiao when the monitor is away.\u201d\nLin Xi smiled, \u201cWe are good friends, it has nothing to do with prying the wall but being courteous.\u201d\nIt was no wonder that Classmate He believed him.\nHowever, Classmate He understood Lin Xi\u2019s involuntary feelings very well. Su Miaomiao was too good-looking to be described by the simple word \u201cschool flower\u201d. Not to mention Class 9, all the boys in the third grade of the school may want to be with Su Miaomiao. If they were far away, they could control their desire, but if they were close to Su Miaomiao like them, how could they control themselves?\nLin Xi was a daring one. He himself looked ruffian, but he was actually very timid.\nClassmate He still remembered that once when Su Miaomiao dropped the pen while playing with Gu Jialing, and the pen rolled to him, he quickly picked it up, wiped it carefully before returning it to Su Miaomiao. In the end, it was just such a trivial matter, but Xie Jingyuan actually looked up at him. His eyes were cold and sharp, like an eagle that was patrolling the sky suddenly found that an uninvited guest broke into his territory.\nClassmate He was completely overwhelmed by Xie Jingyuan\u2019s gaze.\nWas that really the legendary good monitor who was cold on the outside and warm and helpful on the inside?\nHe believed in his own judgment even more.\nFrom then on, even if Su Miaomiao\u2019s pen rolled under his feet, Classmate He pretended not to know, anyway Lin Xi would help soon.\nThe college entrance examination was getting closer, and in the rhythm of preparing for the exams against time, the four children had their birthdays again.\nGrandma Tao specially set the alarm clock at 5:30 in the morning so that she could get up in time to prepare longevity noodles.\nPerhaps because she was happy, Grandma Tao woke up earlier than the alarm clock. She opened the curtains and saw that the sun had already come out, but it was blocked by tall buildings. She could only see the morning glow in the sky.\nGrandma Tao went to the kitchen lightly.\nMiaomiao liked fish ball noodles, Jia Ling liked braised beef noodles, Xu Shou liked sauce-flavored pork ribs noodles, and her grandson\u2019s tomato and egg noodles were the simplest and could be made last.\nThe once wobbly child turned into an eighteen-year-old adult in the blink of an eye.\nGrandma Tao not only missed the lovely childhood of the children, but also was proud that they all grew up so well.\nHumming softly, Grandma Tao moved skillfully and was busy.\nWhen Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei came to help, Grandma Tao\u2019s preparations had already been completed.\nThe four children also got up one after another.\nSu Miaomiao was the last one to get up. When she came to 1002, everyone was bringing out bowls of steaming noodles, making her stomach growl a few times.\u00a0\nSu Miaomiao walked toward the dining table with a smile.\nIt took a lot of time to prepare birthday gifts for the four children at one go. After eating, Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei followed the example of Grandma Tao and gave each of the three high school students a red envelope.\nGiving red envelopes was the most suitable. Children could use them to buy things they really like or need.\nSu Miaomiao was the only girl among the four, and she received special treatment. Grandma Tao continued to give her carefully selected jewelry.\n\u201cThe four of us have made an agreement. We are too busy preparing for the exams this year, so we won\u2019t give each other gifts. This will save everyone trouble,\u201d Gu Jialing explained to the elders.\nTang Shiwei smiled, \u201cDid you think that the gifts they always prepared were not thoughtful enough, so you offered to cancel it?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cDon\u2019t mention it, Auntie, I may get angry if someone mentions this.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pretended not to understand. Under the table, she quietly rubbed Xie Jingyuan\u2019s calf with her toes, and her eyes were full of hints.\nXie Jingyuan avoided her feet and lowered his head to eat noodles.\nAfter the meal, the elders still had time to chat, and the four high school students put on their bags and set off.\nThe morning light was bright and gentle, Su Miaomiao ran beside Xie Jingyuan, and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhere\u2019s my gift?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019ll give it to you when we get to the stadium.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood that the priest was afraid of being discovered by Gu Jialing.\nArriving at No. 1 High School, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou carried their bags to the classroom, while Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan walked to the court with tennis rackets.\nAt first, Su Miaomiao was interested in both high jump and tennis, so she specially used morning self-study to train high jump and evening self-study to practice tennis. Later, the competitions of those two sports often clashed, and the two coaches always tried to win over Su Miaomiao by taking turns.\nTennis was more tiring, but Su Miaomiao enjoyed the sense of accomplishment of chasing the ball.\nNext door to the tennis court was the school gymnasium, and the two of them went inside to change into their sportswear first.\nXie Jingyuan came out of the dressing room first, holding a small white gift box in his hand.\nSu Miaomiao walked out of the dressing room and noticed the thing in his hand at a glance.\nShe ran over happily, her ponytail flicking as she walked.\nXie Jingyuan took the initiative to extend his hand, but she snatched the gift box and opened it impatiently.\nInside the box was a butterfly headband. The headband was white, and the platinum butterfly was studded with diamonds, which was Su Miaomiao\u2019s favorite.\nDifferent from other jewelry that Xie Jingyuan bought before, that headband was customized by him from the brand, and the quantity was ten.\nShe always wore her hair tied up when she played tennis, and a hair tie was almost a necessity for her, but she had not received that kind of diamond hair tie before.\n\u201cSo nice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Don\u2019t let Gu Jialing see it. Next time you wear it, say it was given by your uncle.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know how to deal with him.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan put the things of the two into the locker, and accompanied her to the tennis court.\nSome gym students who did the same morning exercise came to watch them play during their breaks. Regardless of their skills, the sparkling diamonds on Su Miaomiao\u2019s head were really dazzling.\nOn receiving a gift she liked, Su Miaomiao was smiling when she walked into the classroom.\n\u201cYou look so happy, did you find money?\u201d Gu Jialing asked suspiciously.\nSu Miaomiao ignored him.\nLin Xi just glanced at her and continued to lecture the student in front of him.\nXie Jingyuan remembered that Cheng Yue, Lin Xi, Feng Xiaoyu, and Zhou Yao would give them birthday gifts two years ago, but now Lin Xi didn\u2019t express anything, which surprised him.\nThe day passed, and in the evening, the senior high school students also had one more night of self-study than the younger students.\nSu Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan still used the last session of self-study to play tennis, and waited for Xu Shou and Gu Jialing downstairs after the game.\nAfter standing for a while, Gu Jialing suddenly poked his head out of the window of Class 9 and waved at them, \u201cI still have two questions to finish, you guys come up first!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cTake it home and do it!\u201d She was sleepy.\nGu Jialing: \u201cYou are a recommended student, how do you know our suffering?!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cGo up.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had no choice but to follow him up to the second floor.\nEvening self-study was already very late, day students were in a hurry to go home after class, and boarding students had to rush back to the dormitory to make full use of the time before lights were out, so the classrooms were almost empty at that time.\nWhen Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan walked into Class 9, the lights in the classroom were suddenly turned off.\nThe two stayed in place, and the next second, the lights enveloped them simultaneously with screams.\n\u201cHappy birthday!\u201d\nCheng Yue, Feng Xiaoyu, and Zhou Yao jumped out from the side of the podium, holding a big three-tiered birthday cake with eighteen candles stuck in it.\nIn the last row of the classroom, apart from Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, Lin Xi was also there.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t expect that kind of scene, but he was calm that the emotion was suppressed before it even had time to appear in his eyes.\nSu Miaomiao was pleasantly surprised.\nCheng Yue enthusiastically said, \u201cThis is your eighteenth birthday, of course we have to make it more grand. Originally, I wanted to toss the colorful party popper, but Xiao Yu said cleaning it would be too troublesome, so I didn\u2019t buy them. Hey, the third year of high school is too busy, otherwise we could have gone out to celebrate, but now we can only make do with this.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t know what to say, but Xie Jingyuan said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go to your seats and eat cake.\u201d\nThe boys had already cleaned up the surfaces of the desks. Apart from the cake, Cheng Yue and the others had also prepared eight cans of beer.\n\u201cHey, grown-ups should have grown-up types of birthdays!\u201d Cheng Yue excitedly handed out a beer.\nLin Xi smiled slightly, \u201cBoth your and Zhou Yao\u2019s birthdays are on summer vacation, and you are still a few months away from becoming an adult.\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cDo you understand rounding? Thanks to you, you are still a master!\u201d\nLin Xi shook his head, took the beer and held it in his hand.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing all looked at Xie Jingyuan, seeing that the priest had no objection, they took the beer.\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s have a drink first!\u201d Feng Xiaoyu was the first to hold up the beer boldly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cDon\u2019t drink too much.\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cA Taoist master is a Taoist master, still the same, more like a class teacher than a class teacher.\u201d\nExcept for Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou, everyone else laughed.\nSu Miaomiao had never drank beer before, but that time she finally had the chance to taste it, and accidentally took a big gulp.\n\u201cKind of like Coca-Cola,\u201d licking her lips, Su Miaomiao said in a novel way.\nCheng Yue smiled and said, \u201cDrink more if you like. Anyway, you have the Taoist master, so you don\u2019t have to be afraid of getting drunk.\u201d\nLin Xi looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan kept the untouched beer on the table.\nBecause there were four people celebrating birthdays, it was more troublesome to prepare gifts, so the cake was a gift from Cheng Yue and the four of them.\nAfter the cake was cut, everyone sat around and chatted while eating.\nCheng Yue: \u201cHey, actually, I feel a little uncomfortable. The five of you are all toppers, and you should all be admitted to Beijing University. We are different. Maybe tonight will be our last time we celebrate your birthday together.\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes were reddened by her words, and she looked at Su Miaomiao reluctantly.\nZhou Yao lowered her eyes and gently turned the beer can.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWe will celebrate your birthday together during the summer vacations.\u201d\nCheng Yue snorted, \u201cWill you be free? You went to a foreign competition last summer, so you must be competing this year, right?\u201d\nWith Su Miaomiao around, they and Xie Jingyuan could get together, without her, it felt weird with him.\nBesides, Xie Jingyuan accompanied Su Miaomiao to go abroad the previous year, and the two would definitely act together the following year.\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cLet\u2019s not have the party on the day of your birthday, but have a big meal the day after the college entrance examination!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, it\u2019s a deal!\u201d Cheng Yue raised the beer again.\nThere were so many people, eating cakes and drinking beer, and before they knew it, it was time for the school to close.\nThe eight people cleaned up the trash, talked and left the teaching building.\nZhou Yao and Feng Xiaoyu separated from them halfway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019ll carry you on my back.\u201d\nIt was more comfortable for her to be carried than riding a bicycle, so Su Miaomiao turned around and skillfully lay on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou were already used to it. The cat was the most delicate, and the training was tiring. It was normal for the Taoist master to take care of her more.\nLin Xi also saw Xie Jingyuan carrying Su Miaomiao on his back, more than once.\nHe still remembered that Su Miaomiao would call Xie Jingyuan her brother when she was a child.\nSo Su Miaomiao regarded Xie Jingyuan as her elder brother now, but what about Xie Jingyuan?\nLin Xi looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan looked as usual, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, you should go back first.\u201d\n\u201cWell, see you tomorrow,\u201d Lin Xi smiled and rode forward.\nWhen the distance between the two parties was far enough, Xu Shou suddenly asked, \u201cDoes he like Su Miaomiao?\u201d\nGu Jialing seemed to have heard some big news, \u201cNo? How do you know?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThe eyes.\u201d\nGu Jialing recalled it deeply, but still didn\u2019t find any signs. Lin Xi was very gentle and polite to everyone. When he smiled, even the birds in the mountains and forests would dare to jump on his shoulders. Unlike Su Miaomiao, the cat, of whom birds would only avoid her.\nXu Shou didn\u2019t intend to discuss that kind of issue with the bird who hadn\u2019t seen much in the world. What he said just then was to the Taoist master.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Lin Xi\u2019s back and said, \u201cPrepare for the college entrance examination first, and don\u2019t worry about other things.\u201d\nIt was not their business if others liked Su Miaomiao, they couldn\u2019t interfere, and there was no need to interfere, unless those people took untimely practical actions.\nXu Shou nodded.\nAlthough Gu Jialing couldn\u2019t see what Lin Xi was thinking, he became very interested in the topic, touched his chin and said, \u201cLin Xi seems to be pretty good. He looks handsome and has a good temper, and he doesn\u2019t smell bad. So he is definitely a wonderful choice, of course, the premise is that he can get admitted to Beijing University.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him.\nGu Jialing was still immersed in his own world, \u201cAlthough Su Miaomiao is the daughter of her parents, she is also a member of Qingxu. So in the future, if Lin Xi proposes to her for marriage, will we have to prepare a dowry gift? Taoist Master, what does Lin Xi\u2019s family do, do they have money? Su Miaomiao spends so much money, ordinary people can\u2019t afford her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan did not answer.\nHowever, he remembered that Lin Xi\u2019s family also had a company, and his economic conditions must be above average. Lin Xi himself was a top student, and his employment prospects were promising.\n\u201cWhy are you so mundane?\u201d Xu Shou suddenly despised Gu Jialing, \u201cNot everyone considers each other\u2019s family conditions when they fall in love.\u201d\nKnowing that he was more familiar with human beings, Gu Jialing asked humbly, \u201cThen tell us, those men and women who pursue true love, do they all end up happy?\u201d\nSu Mingan, his wife, and Grandma Tao also prepared a birthday cake at home, watching TV while waiting for the four children to come back.\nIn fact, Xie Jingyuan sent a text message to his grandma, saying that his classmates bought a cake so that the elders would not have to wait, but how could the adults miss such an important birthday ceremony?\nAt nine forty, voices were heard in the corridor.\nSu Mingan smiled and went to open the door.\n\u201cMiaomiao is asleep?\u201d Seeing his daughter lying on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back, Su Mingan asked unexpectedly. His daughter liked blowing out birthday candles, so it was impossible for her to snooze that night.\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cCheng Yue and the others bought beer, Miaomiao drank the whole can, and got drunk.\u201d\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing saw Su Mingan\u2019s face darken, a seriousness they had never seen before.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tang Shiwei walked over.\nXie Jingyuan explained again.\nTang Shiwei looked at her husband\u2019s stinky face, glared at him, and then tried to wake up her daughter, \u201cMiaomiao, grandma has prepared a cake, do you want to blow out the candles?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head. She wanted to sleep.\nTang Shiwei asked Su Mingan to help her daughter go home first, and she stayed to eat the cake with the children.\nSu Mingan supported his daughter sullenly, and gave Xie Jingyuan a glare before leaving.\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to him, come in quickly,\u201d Tang Shiwei\u2019s smile was still gentle.\nThe three boys walked in the door with different expressions, and when they saw Grandma Tao coming out of the kitchen with a cake in her arms, they all had smiles at the same time.\nAfter happily eating the cake, Tang Shiwei went home.\nSu Mingan stood in the living room, still looking very angry.\nTang Shiwei glared at him and said, \u201cMiaomiao herself was drunk, why are you angry at Jing Yuan and the others?\u201d\nSu Mingan exhaled heavily, and looked at her, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that they will be dishonest to Miaomiao?\u201d\nHe knew that three children were very reliable, but no matter how reliable they were, Su Mingan still was uncomfortable seeing his daughter drunk like that.\n\u201cJing Yuan is really sensible, he shouldn\u2019t let Miaomiao drink.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cThey\u2019re a group of high school students. You have also gone through that stage. Everyone drinking together, who wouldn\u2019t drink? Besides, Miaomiao didn\u2019t drink alcohol before, and Jing Yuan didn\u2019t know that she would get so drunk.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, are you saying that Jing Yuan is unreliable? From Miaomiao being half-year-old to now, Jing Yuan had spent more time taking care of Miaomiao than the two of us combined. Hmph, if I really have to choose, I would hand Miaomiao over Jing Yuan who is more reassuring than you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Where were you at that time?\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cI have to go to work, if I can stay at home, will it be his turn to be courteous about these things?\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cThere is no if, Jing Yuan is always there when we can\u2019t take care of Miaomiao. Eating, and drinking are trivial matters. Apart from her own cleverness and hard work, Jing Yuan is half of the reason for Miaomiao\u2019s achievements. Can you deny it?\u201d\nSu Mingan was silent.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cI don\u2019t want Miaomiao to get drunk either, but as long as Jing Yuan is by her side, I can rest assured.\u201d\nSu Mingan whispered, \u201cAnyway, you like him, you already regard him as your son-in-law.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cYes, I just like Jing Yuan, and I\u2019m especially envious of Miaomiao. If I had a childhood sweetheart like Jing Yuan by my side when I was studying, I would have married him long ago.\u201d\nShe was beautiful, and she was pursued by many boys during her adolescence, but those high school students were either self-righteous, or clumsy, and other aspects were not even one-tenth of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s.\nGirls of course hoped to find a handsome boyfriend, but being handsome was not enough. Being considerate was sometimes more important than good looks.\nAnyway, Tang Shiwei was satisfied with Xie Jingyuan, and couldn\u2019t find any flaws with a high-powered microscope.\nSu Mingan couldn\u2019t take it anymore, \u201cHow am I worse than him? That\u2019s because we didn\u2019t know each other before. If we had been neighbors since childhood, I could be like him.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cStop putting gold on your face, Jing Yuan can go to the toilet by himself at the age of two, and can read a book quietly for a day. You were still wetting the bed when you were two, right?\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe couple discussed their daughter\u2019s feelings for a while, and turned over their old accounts for a while.\nSuddenly, the couple received a message at the same time.\nAfter the quarrel was suspended, Tang Shiwei picked up the phone on the cabinet.\nJing Yuan: Auntie, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know of Miaomiao\u2019s drinking capacity and let her be drunk. I assure you, similar things will not happen again in the future.\nTang Shiwei smiled, and was a little moved, and replied: It\u2019s okay, I know you are the best for Miaomiao, and Uncle was also a little scared after reading too much news, but I\u2019m not angry with you. Don\u2019t worry, go to sleep, tomorrow you have to get up early.\nJing Yuan: Well, good night, auntie.\nTang Shiwei finally replied with a smiling expression.\nShe walked up to Su Mingan with her phone, and found that he had also received Xie Jingyuan\u2019s apology, the content was the same as what was sent to her, only the title was changed.\n\u201cLook how sensible Jing Yuan is.\u201d\nTang Shiwei snatched her husband\u2019s phone, and comforted Xie Jingyuan with Su Mingan\u2019s phone so as not to worry anymore.\nThe negative emotions in Su Mingan\u2019s heart had almost disappeared, so he hugged his wife and kissed her.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cThink about it, Miaomiao will go to study away in the future, Jing Yuan will not be with her by then, if you don\u2019t believe in Jing Yuan, who else can you trust?\u201d\nSu Mingan sighed.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cJust get used to it. Sooner or later Miaomiao will start a small family with Jing Yuan, then I will buy you a dog so that you won\u2019t be idle.\u201d\n\u201cMiaomiao doesn\u2019t like dogs.\u201d\n\u201cThen buy a cat\u2026 Forget it, she doesn\u2019t like cats either.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get a big fish tank and raise fish, she loves fish.\u201d\nIn 1002, after Grandma Tao went back to her room to sleep, Gu Jialing called Xu Shou, and they slipped into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room together.\nXie Jingyuan put down his phone.\nGu Jialing asked in a low voice, \u201cTaoist Master, what\u2019s going on with the cat\u2019s dad, he was so fierce that I got scared.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cHe was afraid that we would bully Su Miaomiao while she was drunk.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cHow can we bully her?\u201d\nWasn\u2019t that a joke? Su Miaomiao would only bully others when she was awake, and they would protect her when she was asleep.\nXu Shou borrowed the computer from Xie Jingyuan and found a video.\nIt was a video from abroad. The girl was drunk and was rudely dragged out of the bar by several men.\nGu Jialing was so angry that he wanted to beat them up. What was the difference between that kind of behavior and that ugly crow demon!\nXu Shou turned off the video, and concluded, \u201cThere is a lot of such news, and it was only natural for her dad to worry.\u201d\nGu Jialing understood, but was still a little hurt, \u201cHow can her dad not trust us?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThe matter is over, don\u2019t think about it anymore. Just pay more attention in the future, and don\u2019t give others a chance to get her drunk.\u201d\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing both nodded.\nXie Jingyuan looked at them, and added, \u201cYou two also be careful. People have ulterior motives, maybe someone would plot against you.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s face turned pale. When he was a bird, he was easily bullied by others. Did he have to face that kind of danger as a human?\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be for your body, maybe it\u2019s for your organs.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHumans were so scary!\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIn short, drinking is not good, if you can\u2019t drink, don\u2019t drink.\u201d\nHe took the opportunity to give the two of them, especially Gu Jialing, a profound safety education.\nAs a result, Gu Jialing had a nightmare all night. In the dream, there was a female crow chasing him and flying, and other immortals who wanted to swallow his demon pill. He finally met a human monk, but the monk tied him up and said that he would gouge out his eyes and give them to others.\nThe next day, Su Miaomiao, who had a good night\u2019s sleep, was refreshed. When she saw Gu Jialing, she asked in surprise, \u201cWhy do you have dark circles?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I don\u2019t like chocolate.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao opened the package, and there was indeed a small box of chocolate inside.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Su Miaomiao was very happy, pinched a chocolate bean and put it in her mouth.\nGu Jialing remembered Xu Shou\u2019s speculation, and asked, \u201cWhy did you only give it to Su Miaomiao and not us?\u201d\nHe had a loud voice, and many students in front turned back to watch the play curiously.\nLin Xi\u2019s fair face flushed slightly, and then he explained, \u201cThere was only one box.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glared at Gu Jialing, \u201cWhy do you want to rob me of everything?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cWho wants to steal it from you? I didn\u2019t talk to you.\u201d\nThe two of them bickered, unintentionally resolving Lin Xi\u2019s embarrassment.\n\u00a0\u201cOkay, don\u2019t disturb other students\u2019 studies,\u201d Xie Jingyuan opened his mouth to stop them.\nSu Miaomiao and Gu Jialing glanced at each other for the last time, ending the quarrel.\nGu Jialing leaned in front of Xu Shou, covered his mouth with one hand and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lin Xi is indeed suspicious.\u201d\nXu Shou didn\u2019t bother to talk to him.\nOn Su Miaomiao\u2019s side, she looked at the chocolate box in her hand, moved closer to Xie Jingyuan, and said quietly, \u201cTaoist Master, why did Lin Xi get gifts for Children\u2019s Day, but I didn\u2019t?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t accept her hint, Su Miaomiao curled her lips and sat upright.\nAt noon, the group of four went to the small cafeteria for lunch. When they walked out of the cafeteria, the sun was shining.\nThe weather was hot, so Su Miaomiao wanted to eat ice cream.\nThe four of them went to the on-campus supermarket diagonally opposite the cafeteria.\nThe supermarket employees all knew them, and said with a smile, \u201cWant to buy ice cream again? Pick it yourself.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao and Gu Jialing took one each.\nJust when Gu Jialing was about to close the lid of the freezer, Su Miaomiao\u2019s heart moved, and she reached out to take out the second box.\nGu Jialing: \u201cWe agreed to eat one a day, what reason are you taking more?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThis one is for Lin Xi, he gave me chocolate this morning, and I\u2019ll give him an ice cream in return.\u201d\nThe Taoist master said that if someone gave her a gift, she had to give a return gift.\nGu Jialing blinked and didn\u2019t object anymore.\nXie Jingyuan was already standing at the cash register, glanced at the ice cream in their hands, and handed out the campus card.\nAfter paying the bill, the four of them left the supermarket and walked toward the teaching building.\nWhile digging for ice cream, Gu Jialing muttered to Xu Shou, \u201cShe has never offered us a gift before. Could it be that Lin Xi likes her, and she also likes Lin Xi?\u201d\nXu Shou couldn\u2019t tell.\nHe could see the minds of some men, but women\u2019s minds were too difficult to fathom.\nIn his previous life, Xu Shou once witnessed a girl in the village quarreling with a man from another village. The man made the girl cry and wanted to hug her and bully her. Xu Shou rushed over and bit the man, but the girl hugged him and cried. They even beat him with a stick and called him a \u201csmelly dog\u201d\u2026\nAlthough Su Miaomiao was a cat, she was also a female.\nGu Jialing clicked his tongue twice, as he thought Xu Shou knew everything.\nBefore stepping into the teaching building, Su Miaomiao finished her ice cream and threw the box into the trash can.\nLooking at the box that Xie Jingyuan held for her, she suddenly was a little bit reluctant.\nXie Jingyuan noticed the look in her eyes and asked, \u201cDo you still want to eat more?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hesitated.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cSmall gifts given on non-important festivals don\u2019t need to be returned.\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao heard it, she immediately grabbed the ice cream, tore open the package, took the spoon, and dug in one go.\nGu Jialing who was walking behind: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIf that was also called liking, then the feeling of \u201cliking\u201d was too unreliable!\n\u201cMiaomiao, let\u2019s take a picture together!\u201d Su Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan to the second floor while eating ice cream, and saw Yu Le, who was in Class 1 of senior high school, standing at the door of Class 9 with a phone in her hand.\nThe college entrance examination was only a few days away, and it was becoming more common for high school seniors to seize the time to take group pictures with their old classmates.\nSu Miaomiao still liked that old classmate who often asked her to go to the restroom together and queued up next to her during the exercise between classes, \u201cOkay, where?\u201d\nYu Le stood by the glass window opposite to the door, \u201cThe light here is good, can you help us take a picture, monitor?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t speak, but took Yu Le\u2019s cell phone.\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you hold the ice cream,\u201d Gu Jialing said kindly.\nSu Miaomiao was a little skeptical, \u201cWill you steal it?\u201d\nGu Jialing looked disgusted, \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot to eat your saliva.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao then handed him the ice cream and threatened, \u201cIf you dare to steal it, I\u2019ll pull your hair out!\u201d\nGu Jialing began to regret why he wanted to help.\nYu Le smiled and watched the two of them quarreling. That phenomenon was very common in Class 1 and 9. Unexpectedly, the two of them were still arguing.\n\u201cI\u2019ll really miss this,\u201d Yu Le put her arms around Su Miaomiao\u2019s shoulders, and whispered while looking at the phone camera.\nSu Miaomiao looked at her, thinking that it might be difficult for everyone to meet again after the college entrance examination, so she lightly rubbed the top of her head on Yu Le\u2019s neck.\nHer hair was soft, and the moment she touched it, Yu Le had an inexplicable sense of happiness, as if the upcoming college entrance examination was not so scary, and there was no need to have any pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She was reluctant to give up at first, but she was even more reluctant to give up when Su Miaomiao hugged her.\nNot wanting to be seen by the three boys, Yu Le took back her phone and ran away.\nSu Miaomiao looked at her back, blinked her eyes, and asked Gu Jialing for ice cream.\nThere was a passing girl from the same class who also wanted to take a picture with him.\nAfter lunch, there was a relatively long break, and the students in Class 9 and Class 3 also started to take pictures, either in twos or threes.\nA few years ago, students may have had to use professional cameras. But because the pixels of phones were getting higher, everyone had a phone, and it was more convenient to take pictures.\n\u201cGu Jialing, can I take a picture with you alone?\u201d\n\u201cXu Shou, shall we also do it?\u201d\nWhile Su Miaomiao was eating ice cream, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou received invitations from the girls one after another.\nAfter eating the last bite of ice cream, Su Miaomiao thought about her experience of taking pictures in the past few days, and asked Xie Jingyuan who was next to her with her head bowed, \u201cTaoist Master, why didn\u2019t any girl ask you to take a picture with her?\u201d\nIt was said that the more attractive boys were, the more times they would be invited. The Taoist master was obviously better-looking than Gu Jialing and Xu Shou, so why did no girls come to ask him for a picture? The pictures taken by him were basically of the three of them with other people.\nXie Jingyuan paused, and immediately continued, \u201cI don\u2019t like taking pictures.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stared at his repulsive face, and understood that the girls might be afraid of the Taoist master.\n\u201cMiaomiao, let\u2019s take a picture too,\u201d Lin Xi suddenly invited Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao smiled and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nShe liked Lin Xi and Cheng Yue more than Yu Le.\nLin Xi: \u201cLet\u2019s go outside the classroom.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stood up immediately.\nXie Jingyuan also left his seat and said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you take pictures.\u201d\nLin Xi originally wanted to say no, but Xie Jingyuan walked out of his seat, so he smiled, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe three walked out along the aisle between the same desks, with Su Miaomiao in the middle.\nSuddenly, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s voice sounded beside her ear, \u201cYou can take pictures, but you can\u2019t rub your head on him.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was startled, and looking back, Xie Jingyuan was clearly separated from her by tens of centimeters, and his posture didn\u2019t look like he had just approached her.\nHer eyes were full of surprise, but Xie Jingyuan just looked at her calmly.\nSu Miaomiao thought of Gu Jialing\u2019s neckline that was dried by the Taoist master\u2019s spell, and understood that he must have cast some sound transmission spell.\nShe nodded obediently.\nThere was a difference between men and women. The Taoist master taught her not to have physical contact with boys casually.\nBack in the corridor, Su Miaomiao took the initiative to stand by the window.\nLin Xi walked to her side, put his left hand in his pocket, and supported Su Miaomiao with his right\u2026\nXie Jingyuan frowned slightly, staring at Lin Xi\u2019s hand over the phone.\nLin Xi just wanted to support the window sill behind Su Miaomiao, so that he could lower his body and keep his head closer to her.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes before Lin Xi noticed.\nOn the phone screen, Su Miaomiao maintained a sweet smile, and Lin Xi also smiled gently and handsomely.\nSu Miaomiao felt that it was almost done. She tilted her head to look at Gu Jialing on the other side.\nAt that time, Xie Jingyuan returned the phone to Lin Xi.\nThe screen had returned to the main page, Lin Xi went to click on the album again, and Su Miaomiao was dragged away by other students.\nTherefore, when Lin Xi discovered that the picture taken by Xie Jingyuan perfectly captured the moment when Su Miaomiao tilted her head and looked to the side, and his eyes were lowered as if they were closed, the smile in Lin Xi\u2019s eyes froze immediately.\nHe looked up and saw Xie Jingyuan going to take pictures for Su Miaomiao again, his profile was as indifferent and cold as before.\nLin Xi looked at the picture again.\nDid Xie Jingyuan do it on purpose, or did he really have no photography skills?\n\u201cHey, monitor, how did you take the picture? You made us so ugly. Retake it, retake it!\u201d\nA girl who just took back her phone suddenly jumped up and screamed, and handed the phone to Xie Jingyuan again.\nLin Xi: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAt noon on June 5th, senior high school students were on vacation, and boarding students would stay in the dormitory until the college entrance examination was over before packing up and leaving school. The departure of day students this time was a real one.\nEach person of the four-member group of Qingxu Temple had textbooks, tutorials, test papers, etc. that couldn\u2019t be filled in their bag.\nSu Mingan called Su Miaomiao in advance and asked the four of them to wait in the classroom. He decided to pick them up by car.\nThe four sat in the last row of the classroom, watching other students pack their things.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so heavy, I can\u2019t move it all at once,\u201d a girl from the hostel wailed.\n\u201cLet me help you,\u201d Xu Shou walked over.\nSu Miaomiao saw that girl blushing.\nWhen the other girls booed and asked him to help them, Xu Shou looked behind and called Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t want to be a helpful bird at all, did he?\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call the master?\u201d\nGu Jialing muttered in a low voice, and walked over reluctantly under Xu Shou\u2019s urging eyes.\nSu Miaomiao put her chin on the pile of test papers on the table, her big eyes turned around, looking at the familiar classroom.\n\u00a0Lin Xi was still arranging things beside her. Seeing her like that, he smiled and said, \u201cAre you reluctant?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, my mother said that college life isn\u2019t so hard. I\u2019m thinking about what a college classroom will be like.\u201d\nLin Xi: \u201cUniversity life is not hard, but it depends on your major. Some majors have relatively simple content and fewer courses and more spare time after university. Some majors have complex content and difficult courses. If you want to stay ahead, you also have to go to self-study in the morning and evening.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Su Miaomiao had her own rhythm, and at her current level, it was not suitable for her to attend classes with sports students. The tennis coach had told her that she would flexibly adjust her training plan according to her college courses.\n\u201cThis, I haven\u2019t figured out yet.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cPrepare for the exam first, and then think about your major after the exam.\u201d\nAfter the topic was over, Su Miaomiao continued to stare blankly at the classroom.\nThe classroom in Class 9 turned vacant.\nAt that time, Lin Xi\u2019s father walked in with Su Mingan.\nSu Mingan was dressed casually, but Lin Xi\u2019s father was wearing a black suit, as if he had just attended a meeting.\nThe two middle-aged fathers were well maintained. Su Mingan was the kind of handsome guy who seemed to have malicious intentions when he smiled, and his eyes were especially fierce when he started. So when he got unhappy, Gu Jialing would feel very oppressive.\nLin Xi\u2019s father was gentle and elegant, similar to Xie Rong\u2019s temperament, but he lacked the aura of the chairman of a large group and was more approachable.\n\u201cUncle Lin,\u201d the group of four greeted in unison.\n\u00a0Father Lin looked at the four children with a smile, and said to Su Mingan, \u201cLin Xi\u2019s mother often mentioned the four of them to me, especially Jing Yuan and Miaomiao, who have been excellent since elementary school until now.\u201d\nSu Mingan smiled and said, \u201cYour Lin Xi is also very smart. I heard from Miaomiao that he came in second in the mock exam last time.\u201d\nLin Xi looked at Su Miaomiao unexpectedly, she mentioned him to her parents?\nAfter the conversation, Lin Xi and his dad left first.\nXie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Su Mingan moved the textbooks and test papers of the four. Gu Jialing took the opportunity to go to Su Miaomiao\u2019s side and asked, \u201cWhy did you praise Lin Xi in front of my uncle and aunt?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t remember that she ever praised him.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go. Your grandma has cooked a table of delicious food and is waiting for you to go back!\u201d With one arm around his daughter and the other around Gu Jialing, Su Mingan said with great emotion.\nXie Jingyuan and Xu Shou silently walked. The flat ground was fine, but they had to cooperate carefully when going down the stairs.\nGu Jialing was secretly proud. It was good to be liked by the cat\u2019s father, as he could work less.\nSu Mingan looked at Xie Jingyuan, who was honestly working as a coolie, and snorted.\nHe would go to another place to study in university soon, so he had no choice but to mess with him a few more times while he was still in front of his eyes.\n\u2014-\nAfter lunch, Su Mingan went to the company, and Grandma Tao asked the children what their plans were for the afternoon.\nThe three demons all looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan let them decide for themselves, \u201cThose who are sure about the college entrance examination should rest, and those who are not sure continue to study.\u201d\nOrdinary students may bear the pressure of the college entrance examination, but the three demons didn\u2019t have to worry about that, after all, they lived at least a hundred years in their previous life.\nXu Shou: \u201cI\u2019ll go back to my room to study.\u201d\nThe third ranker had already said so, and Gu Jialing, the eighth ranker, of course couldn\u2019t slack off.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao. She was the most relaxed as she had been recommended to Beijing University, and it was the kind of recommendation that did not take the college entrance examination into consideration. Also she could choose a major. She took the college entrance examination because she had studied hard for so many years and wanted to see if she could score well in the last test.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll do four more sets of test papers, one in the afternoon, one in the evening, and two tomorrow,\u201d Su Miaomiao said after thinking.\nGrandma Tao: \u201cOkay, you concentrate on your studies, I will be responsible for cooking delicious food for you.\u201d\nBefore Su Miaomiao went home, she asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cWill we still play at night?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen let\u2019s go to school at night.\u201d\nAt eight o\u2019clock in the evening, Su Miaomiao finished a set of test papers and was about to go out.\nSu Mingan hesitated to speak.\nTang Shiwei just smiled and reminded her daughter to bring water.\nSu Mingan sat on the sofa for a while, then walked to the balcony, just in time to see Xie Jingyuan riding out of the garage and his daughter jumping into the back seat.\nSu Mingan also noticed that his daughter had one arm around Xie Jingyuan\u2019s waist.\nUnder the streetlamp, the boy and the girl rode away slowly.\nSu Mingan: \u201cI feel uneasy letting Miaomiao out at night.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cIt\u2019s love. Middle-aged men like you don\u2019t understand the romance of high school students.\u201d\nSu Mingan snorted and pulled the curtains abruptly.\nWhen Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan came to No. 1 High School, some buildings in the school were still lit, and the dormitory buildings were even brightly lit.\nThe security guard knew them and reminded them that the school would close at 9:30, so they should pay attention to the time.\nXie Jingyuan nodded, and led Su Miaomiao inside.\nShe looked in the direction of the dormitory building and asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cMaster, do we have to live in a dormitory when we go to university?\u201d\nWhen she just entered high school, she and Cheng Yue visited Feng Xiaoyu and Zhou Yao\u2019s dormitory. There were actually ten people living in a room, and it was so small that one couldn\u2019t even swing their racket.\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cUniversity dormitories usually only accommodate four people, and it will be much more spacious.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI don\u2019t like it either, I just want to sleep in a big bed alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "110": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-110/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cEveryone has to live like that. You will get used to it gradually, and in the dormitory, you may meet a few good friends.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hugged his waist slightly, and put her head against his back, muttering, \u201cThe four of us will go to the same university, I don\u2019t need other friends.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWe are all men, it is impossible to live in the same dormitory with you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, and missed the time when she was a cat again.\nAt the tennis court, Xie Jingyuan parked his bicycle outside, holding a racket in one hand and a basket of tennis balls in the other, and walked in with Su Miaomiao.\nThe summer night was windy and much cooler than the day, but after playing for more than ten minutes, both of them were sweating.\nSu Miaomiao usually liked to be clean. Only when she was playing, her attention was highly concentrated on the green ball in mid-air, and she forgot everything else.\nThat was also one of Su Miaomiao\u2019s advantages.\nOther tennis players were often disturbed by some external factors, such as tens of thousands of spectators, score gaps, pressure from strong opponents, etc. Su Miaomiao was not. When she picked up the racket, only one thing was in her mind- catch the opponent\u2019s ball and bounce it back.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t even notice Xie Jingyuan\u2019s abdominal muscles that were occasionally exposed when he played. During the competition, his face was also blurred.\nXie Jingyuan deliberately imitated the playing style of different tennis masters.\nIn his previous life, Xie Jingyuan was a rare cultivation genius in the eyes of old Taoist masters. His talent followed him to the modern age. The specific manifestation was that he could easily learn everything, including textbook learning, and playing skills.\nBecause of having him as a training partner who was comparable to a professional, and Su Miaomiao\u2019s own athletic talent, although she did not spend as much training time as other professional tennis players every day, her efficiency was frighteningly high. Su Miaomiao\u2019s tennis coach had also thought about asking Xie Jingyuan to join countless times, but unfortunately he had his own career plan and was determined. No one could shake him from what he had already decided.\nAfter playing two games in a row, Xie Jingyuan went around to pick up the scattered tennis balls, while Su Miaomiao sat on the chair next to her to rest.\nAfter three years of training, Su Miaomiao\u2019s physical strength and endurance had greatly improved. She was tired, but she was far from reaching her limit.\nWhile drinking water, a strange itching suddenly came from her calf. Su Miaomiao looked down, and found that it was a big mosquito.\nXie Jingyuan had just picked up a ball when he heard a super loud \u201cpop\u201d from her side.\nHe turned his head to look over.\nSu Miaomiao complained to him while pouring mineral water to rinse her bloody calf, \u201cI was bitten by a mosquito and it sucked a lot of my blood.\u201d\nWild mosquitoes outside were often more aggressive than those at home.\nXie Jingyuan came over and knelt down in front of her.\nSu Miaomiao stretched out her left leg to show him.\nWhen she came out to play, she wore a pair of self-colored sports shorts, her slender and well-proportioned legs were almost completely exposed in front of Xie Jingyuan.\nThe white material of the clothes was dull, but her legs were as white as jade, and there were some drops of water on the calf where the mosquito bit her.\nXie Jingyuan only looked at her calf.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Su Miaomiao said, pointing to the bitten place.\nThere had been a small bulge there. It was just strange white, if left untreated, it would turn red and swollen.\nXie Jingyuan gently covered her wound with the pulp of his index finger.\nA slight coolness entered her skin, and after it passed, the itching also disappeared.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him with admiration and envy, \u201cMaster, what kind of spell is this?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cFor the trauma, luckily it\u2019s just a mosquito bite. If it was serious, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything about it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was very curious, \u201cWhat is the most powerful spell you can cast now?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t hide from her, \u201cNo powerful spells, probably fire to be able to cook a bowl of noodles, or quickly freeze the contents of the refrigerator.\u201d\nIt was really nothing in the previous life, but in that world, it was already very powerful.\nSu Miaomiao described it in another way, \u201cIf you deal with bad people, wouldn\u2019t it be possible to burn or frostbite them?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIn a society ruled by law, this method cannot be used.\u201d\nAfter speaking, he continued to pick up the balls.\nSu Miaomiao was afraid that there would be more mosquitoes to bite her, so she also went to help pick up the balls.\nAfter packing up their things, the two rode away.\nThe evening wind dried the clothes that were sweaty when playing tennis, Su Miaomiao put her nose on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back and smelled him lightly.\nXie Jingyuan frowned, \u201cWhat are you smelling?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou don\u2019t stink even when you are sweating, but some boys stink after physical class.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan thought, maybe the four of them had physiques tempered by spiritual qi daily, there were few impurities in their bodies, and the smell of sweat was not heavy.\nHowever, she was so sensitive to smells, could she really adapt to dormitory life in college?\u00a0\nOn June 7th, the college entrance examination officially began.\nEven Su Mingan who went to bed late, woke up early nervously, one could imagine the mental state of other parents.\nWhile the four children were having breakfast together, Xie Jingyuan received a call from his stepmother, Qiao Lili, expressing her best wishes for his performance in the college entrance examination.\nXie Jingyuan listened politely, occasionally humming.\nGrandma Tao couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and before Qiao Lili could say a few more words, she loudly urged her grandson to eat quickly.\nShe knew that kind of person better than anyone else. She rarely called, but on important days she called and babbled.\nSu Mingan winked at Tang Shiwei. He finally discovered a shortcoming of Xie Jingyuan. If his daughter was really with him, she would have to face an unkind step mother-in-law in the future!\nTang Shiwei just wanted to roll her eyes at him.\nGrandma Tao had revealed to her that Xie Jingyuan had already earned tens of millions of yuan by himself, so would he not be able to afford a house for the young couple to live alone in the future?\nWhat kind of step mother-in-law? Was Xie Jingyuan someone who was easily controlled by Qiao Lili, or their Miaomiao?\nNot to mention Qiao Lili as a stepmother, even for Xie Rong, his own father, he may not follow his orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Without Xu Shou reminding him, he concentrated all his attention on observing the road. The children were scholars, so he shouldn\u2019t do anything that would affect their critical moments. If he dared, Grandma Tao would scold him and his wife may divorce him.\nIt wasn\u2019t until encountering a 60-second red light that Su Mingan asked with a smile, \u201cXu Shou, Jia Ling, what are your plans for the summer vacation? Will you both go home?\u201d\nGu Jialing had planned it long ago, and said excitedly, \u201cI\u2019m going to travel, and I\u2019ll visit one resort a week.\u201d\nHe wanted to accumulate experience for opening a resort by himself in the future.\nSu Mingan looked at Xu Shou.\nXu Shoudao: \u201cI will stay in Anshi to work part-time.\u201d\nIf he got lucky, he could earn his freshman tuition and living expenses by working part-time for two months.\nAlthough the Taoist master had money and was willing to spend it on him, Xu Shou couldn\u2019t do the brazen thing of thinking about the Taoist master\u2019s money every day like the cat and the bird.\nSu Mingan\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cDo you want to help out in Uncle\u2019s company? It\u2019s hard to do the decoration, but you are strong, so it should be fine.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThank you Uncle, I will consider it, the green light is on.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe kept his mouth shut and continued to be a responsible and good driver.\nThey soon arrived at the examination place. It was just eight o\u2019clock, half an hour before the time to enter the examination room.\n\u201cShould we sit in the car or wait outside?\u201d Su Mingan asked.\nGu Jialing: \u201cGo down, the car is too small. It\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe silly boy looked quite likable, but why was his speech so unpleasant? Fortunately, he had a big heart.\nThe five people got out of the car one after another.\nStudents from several high schools in the city were randomly assigned to different examination rooms, so looking around, there were not many familiar faces.\n\u201cMiaomiao!\u201d Feng Xiaoyu and Yu Le ran out from the crowd toward Su Miaomiao happily.\nSu Mingan laughed straight at the sight. His wife was worried that his daughter\u2019s popularity was not good., but apparently she had quite a lot of good friends.\nThe three girls gathered together, and unknowingly distanced themselves from Xie Jingyuan.\nGu Jialing touched his chin, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone come to me?\u201d\nXu Shou gave a low snort. How could a bird who admired himself all day long have real friends?\nXie Jingyuan held Su Miaomiao\u2019s bag in his hand, and stood expressionlessly, standing out from the crowd.\nSu Mingan looked around, but he couldn\u2019t find a male student who was more eye-catching than Xie Jingyuan.\nTime passed by every minute and every second, and the bell rang to remind candidates that they could enter the school.\nAfter following his daughter, Su Mingan couldn\u2019t go any further. Looking at his daughter who was already taller than his wife, he was still very worried.\nNot daring to say too much, Su Mingan turned to Xie Jingyuan in the end, \u201cJingyuan, send Miaomiao to her examination room first, and watch her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded toward him, his expression was still indifferent, and he continued to walk behind Su Miaomiao.\nSu Mingan snorted.\nCandidates poured into the teaching building like carps trying to jump into the dragon gate, and then distributed to each floor and classroom.\nThe examination rooms of Gu Jialing and Xu Shou were on the second floor.\nXie Jingyuan was on the third floor, but he accompanied Su Miaomiao to the fourth floor first.\nSu Miaomiao stopped in front of the stairs and said to him, \u201cI can find it myself.\u201d\u00a0\nHer dad really made a big fuss out of nothing.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cLet\u2019s go, let me see who is sitting with you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood, \u201cYou are afraid that they will bully me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan neither admitted nor denied it.\nWhen they arrived at her examination room, it was already half full. Su Miaomiao\u2019s seat was in the third row in the middle. There were two boys and two girls in the front, back, right, and left. They were all quite honest.\nXie Jingyuan stood outside the examination room and told Su Miaomiao, \u201cEven if there is any conflict, you have to wait until the exam is over to leave the examination room.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded mechanically.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWait here for me after the exam, I\u2019ll come to pick you up.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nDidn\u2019t they say that after eighteen years old a person became an adult, and one could be self-reliant after becoming an adult? Why was the Taoist master still treating her like a father treating his kindergarten child?\nShe grabbed her own things and entered the examination room without looking back.\nAfter she cleaned up the table, she looked up and found that Xie Jingyuan was still at the door.\nFortunately, as soon as their eyes met, he walked away immediately.\nThe first test was Chinese.\nSu Miaomiao answered all the questions carefully, and checked the composition three times to make sure it was correct. After waiting for a while, the invigilator began to collect the papers.\nSu Miaomiao was the first to rush out of the examination room because she had packed everything in advance.\nShe ran very fast, and wanted to go to the third floor to wait for Xie Jingyuan and give him a surprise.\nAs a result, as soon as she ran to the stairs, he also turned around from the corridor.\nThe boy in the white shirt raised his head, and the girl in the white skirt smiled at him.\nXie Jingyuan also smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Old Su, is Xiao Wei working overtime today? If not, let\u2019s wait for her to come back and set off together.\u201d\nBefore Su Mingan could respond, he caught a glimpse of Gu Jialing\u2019s smile and wondered, \u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cI smiled at Uncle Xie calling you \u2018Old Su\u2019 and calling Auntie \u2018Xiao Wei\u2019, (little Wei: his wife) as if aunt is your daughter.\u201d\nSu Mingan kicked him.\nWhile chatting, the group came to the place where the adults parked their cars.\nXie Jingyuan first opened the rear door of Su Mingan\u2019s car for Su Miaomiao, and as soon as she entered, he followed.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou also took their usual seats.\nXie Rong: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Mingan smoothed things over, \u201cThey have done their exam, so they must want to get together to check the answers.\u201d\nXie Rong smiled wryly, \u201cThat\u2019s an excuse, it\u2019s better to say that he likes to cling to Miaomiao.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nCould the prospective father-in-laws feel the same about the two children falling in love?\nSu Mingan shook hands with Xie Rong and got into the car first.\nJokes aside, when they got in the car, Su Mingan still mentioned to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cYour father came here just after you entered the examination room, and stood outside with me for two hours.\u201d\nWith such a topic, the three demons all looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nHe remained silent.\nGu Jialing said to Su Mingan, \u201cOur Taoist master doesn\u2019t like to hear this, so you can talk about something else.\u201d\nSu Mingan stared at him, \u201cFart Taoist master, you always call him this every day.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cMiaomiao called him so first.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe concentrated on driving, and Xie Rong\u2019s car always kept a distance behind him.\nIn the evening, Xie Rong asked his assistant to book a restaurant outside, and the two families took their children there to eat, but did not invite Qiao Lili and the twins.\nWhen Su Miaomiao came home, she found that Cheng Yue, Feng Xiaoyu, Zhou Yao, and Lin Xi had already chatted in the group, discussing where to go the next day.\nCheng Yue to Su Miaomiao: Have you finished eating?\nSu Miaomiao: Well, I just got home.\nCheng Yue: Where do you want to go tomorrow?\nGu Jialing: I want to go to the botanical garden!\nFeng Xiaoyu: No, I don\u2019t want to go to the botanical garden, there are only trees there.\nGu Jialing sent an angry emoji.\nSu Miaomiao: Playing tennis?\nCheng Yue: Is it not enough that you play it every day? Besides, we can\u2019t play tennis like the four of you.\nLin Xi: Actually, I plan to learn tennis this summer.\nCheng Yue: Shut up, if the Taoist master didn\u2019t speak, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not seeing the screen.\nShe easily unraveled Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan: If Lin Xi wants to learn, I can teach him.\nFeng Xiaoyu: Hahahahaha\nCheng Yue: Hahahahaha +1\nGu Jialing: What are you laughing at?\nNo one answered him, and everyone continued to discuss.\nGu Jialing was too confused, and because Xu Shou was taking a bath, he went to the master bedroom to ask Xie Jingyuan, but he ignored him. Then Gu Jialing went to the living room to find Grandma Tao.\nGrandma Tao was watching TV. When he asked her, she didn\u2019t consider\u00a0 it carefully, but guessed perfunctorily, \u201cJing Yuan is willing to teach them how to play tennis, they are all very happy, right? Isn\u2019t \u2018hahaha\u2019 just a happy laugh?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAlthough he had just been a human for many years, he still instinctively felt that Grandma Tao\u2019s analysis was very unreliable.\nIn the morning of the next day, Su Miaomiao and the others sat in the car of the Gu family and came to the game city to join Cheng Yue and the others.\nThe eight high school students played indulgently for nearly two hours, and almost every game in the game city.\nThat time Su Miaomiao did not play the claw machine, but played a fruit-cutting game that children liked.\nShe sat at the game table and was engrossed in it, while Xie Jingyuan sat beside her and watched her play.\nLin Xi also put coins in the game table next to her, and asked Su Miaomiao before starting, \u201cDo you want to compete?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t raise her head, \u201cOkay, wait until I finish this game.\u201d\nLin Xi waited for her with a smile, and seeing Xie Jingyuan looking over, he asked, \u201cDo you want to play as well?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d\nHe looked at Su Miaomiao\u2019s hand, as if he saw a cat\u2019s paw scratching back and forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Whoever loses will give the other party something.\u201d\nLin Xi smiled, \u201cOkay, if I lose, what do you want?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was still thinking, when Xie Jingyuan\u2019s voice transmission sounded in her ear again, \u201cWhile betting with students outside, you can\u2019t bet for anything more than ten yuan.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao immediately lost most of the fun, but she still thought of one thing, \u201cLet\u2019s bet on an ice cream, strawberry flavored.\u201d\nLin Xi: \u201cOkay, if you lose, teach me how to play tennis when you have time.\u201d\nThat was too simple, so Su Miaomiao readily agreed.\nLin Xi looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nHis expression was normal, and he didn\u2019t interfere with anything.\nWhen the game started, Su Miaomiao lowered her head and used both hands, trying not to let go of any fruit that appeared on the screen.\nLin Xi shook his head helplessly, and when Su Miaomiao finished, he smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to buy ice cream now. There is a milk tea shop on this floor, which also seems to sell ice cream.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stood up.\nXie Jingyuan was still sitting, only looking at Xu Shou who was playing a shooting game diagonally across.\nXu Shou immediately stopped the game and followed.\nGu Jialing noticed his figure and asked loudly, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cBuy ice cream.\u201d\nAs early as when Lin Xi approached the Taoist master and Su Miaomiao, Xu Shou listened carefully. The distance between the two sides was close, and with his sensitive hearing, the noises did not interfere too much.\nUpon hearing it, Gu Jialing jumped and chased after him.\nThe two quickly followed Lin Xi and Su Miaomiao.\nEven if Su Miaomiao always bickered with Gu Jialing, among them, she liked his smell second to the Taoist master, and subconsciously stuck to Gu Jialing.\n\u201cYou guys actually played fruit ninja? It\u2019s too childish.\u201d\n\u201cYour Angry Birds is not childish then.\u201d\nLin Xi who was walking in front couldn\u2019t laugh or cry.\nXu Shou glanced at him silently.\n\u00a0In his heart, although Su Miaomiao, a cat with a history of stealing, was bad at best, her mind was very simple, and others could coax her away with just a few snacks.\nXu Shou didn\u2019t want Su Miaomiao to be taken advantage of by others, and the Taoist master must have been wary of it, so he signaled him to follow her to protect her.\nIn the end, Lin Xi bought a total of eight ice creams, as a treat for everyone.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t like ice cream, so he gave it to Gu Jialing.\nSu Miaomiao protested, \u201cWhy not give it to me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou have to eat grilled fish at noon, too much sweets will affect your appetite.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao reluctantly accepted this explanation.\nGu Jialing with an ice cream in each hand: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nDidn\u2019t his appetite need to be considered?\nAt the grilled fish store, Cheng Yue ordered another beer.\nXie Jingyuan asked the waiter for a large bottle of Coke.\nCheng Yue jokingly said, \u201cWe\u2019re all grown-ups, why Taoist Master, are you still drinking Coke?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cAdults can drink alcohol, but they don\u2019t have to. You girls should protect yourself even more when you are outside. Sometimes friends may not be trustworthy.\u201d\nAs soon as he opened his mouth, the atmosphere instantly became serious.\nCheng Yue: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ve known each other for so long, it doesn\u2019t matter if we drink less.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded.\nHe made his statement, and the atmosphere warmed up.\nGu Jialing was sitting on the left side of Su Miaomiao, and Xie Jingyuan was on the right. She didn\u2019t remember how drunk she was the previous time, but she remembered what her father taught her the next day.\n\u201cI\u2019ll drink Coke,\u201d Su Miaomiao said to Xie Jingyuan, the taste of beer was not very good anyway, she was not greedy for it at all.\nXie Jingyuan unscrewed the lid and poured her a glass of Coke.\nGu Jialing smoothly pushed her cup over.\nXie Jingyuan also poured it for him.\nFeng Xiaoyu whispered to Cheng Yue, \u201cI think the Taoist master is actually quite gentle.\u201d\nCheng Yue looked weirdly at her,\u00a0 \u201cHas your myopia increased again?\u201d\nFeng Xiaoyu smiled and pushed her.\n\u201cHave you all decided what major to apply for?\u201d Zhou Yao asked suddenly.\nGu Jialing was the first to raise her hand, \u201cI want to study landscape architecture!\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cYou really want to open a resort?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cOf course, I will stay in my own resort in the future.\u201d\nHe was a bird, and he liked to stay in places with beautiful scenery. If it weren\u2019t for the burden of the human body, he wouldn\u2019t need to open a resort, and he could just find a protected area to settle down.\nCheng Yue looked at Xie Jingyuan and the others, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThe first major is business administration, and the second major is computer science and technology.\u201d\nThe purpose of business management was to help the Taoist master manage the property, and the computer was to search for traces of crimes on the Internet.\nBeing a policeman in one place could only solve a limited number of crimes. It was more efficient for him to find traces of criminal activities on the Internet and report them to the local police station.\nFeng Xiaoyu: \u201cTwo majors, this is the real master.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cIt\u2019s all inspired from the Taoist master.\u201d\nHe also heard the Taoist master mention the choice of majors, so he knew that college students could choose to do a double major.\nEveryone looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI will major in pharmacy and in clinical medicine.\u201d\nCheng Yue said unexpectedly, \u201cI thought you would study finance.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cOur Taoist master is not so materialistic. He has the world in mind, and his ambition is to help the common people!\u201d\nBeing a doctor could only save a number of people. By learning medicine, even if only one key drug was developed, it would save generations of patients.\nAlthough those words came out of his mouth full of comical effects, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s calmness gave people a feeling that he would definitely realize the lofty ambition that sounded empty.\n\u201cLin Xi, what about you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I heard that the course is very easy. Do you want to abandon the Taoist master and enroll in a university with me?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao definitely shook her head.\nShe refused so quickly, Lin Xi subconsciously looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan took a sip of Coke.\nFeng Xiaoyu said seriously, \u201cI think Miaomiao can learn English, one was that the courses were relatively simple, and you will definitely have to go abroad to compete frequently in the future. Think about the day you win the Grand Slam and foreign reporters interview you. You will look so cool with your pure and fluent English by then!\u201d\nCheng Yue: \u201cMiaomiao is a top student, wouldn\u2019t learning English be a bit overkill? How about you also study business administration with Xu Shou, and you can inherit your father\u2019s company in the future.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t make up her mind.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you have a whole summer vacation to think about it.\u201d\nIf she chose a major, she could directly mention it to Beijing University without registering in the system.\nThe waiter brought up the grilled fish.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t think about it for the time being.\nAfter lunch, the eight of them went to KTV again.\nGu Jialing sang the most, and the three girls also sang in turn.\nSu Miaomiao, Xie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Lin Xi were sitting on the sofa. Due to their personalities, they were not interested in singing.\nZhou Yao was an introverted and quiet girl, and she also chose a quiet song.\n\u201cThe two of us are strange and familiar, and love seems to come very carefully.\u201d\n\u201cRecently, you and I have been in the same mood. It is something similar to love.\u201d\nAt that point, Cheng Yue and Feng Xiaoyu sang along, their bodies swaying regularly.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder suddenly felt heavy.\nHe tilted his head and saw Su Miaomiao\u2019s sleeping face.\n.That summer vacation was very short for Su Miaomiao.\nAfter only two days of rest, she flew to London with Xie Jingyuan to meet the coach and started the special training before the Wimbledon match.\nThat was also Su Miaomiao\u2019s first international competition as an adult, and her current women\u2019s world ranking was 98.\nShe just practiced every day.\nA total of fourteen days of the competition, on the first day of the competition, the domestic side just happened to release the college entrance examination scores.\n\u201cHow much did I score?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao won her first match, and when she came over to take a break, she heard Xie Jingyuan say that it was time to check the score, so she asked immediately.\nXie Jingyuan naturally checked it for her, \u201c675, it is a normal score.\u201d\nThat score was enough to be admitted to a key university, and it may be a little short of the admission line of Beijing University. If Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t take out two self-study sessions every day, she should be able to make up for the gap.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing\u2019s scores were all above 700.\nSu Miaomiao was very happy, \u201cThen we can all go to Beijing University.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her flushed face that was still sweating, and asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t like Xu Shou? Does it matter if he goes to Beijing University or not?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI just don\u2019t like the smell on his body. We are both from Qingxu Temple. Of course, it\u2019s best to be together all the time.\u201d\nExcept for some closest relatives, most people in that world, including many classmates, were strangers and irrelevant to Su Miaomiao. Xu Shou was one of her few acquaintances, even just seeing Xu Shou\u2019s face, Su Miaomiao felt kind.\nXie Jingyuan nodded, and when Su Miaomiao finished speaking with the coach, he reminded her, \u201cCall uncle and aunt first.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao went to make a phone call, and even browsed the chat group when she was free.\nLin Xi\u2019s score was still lower than Xie Jingyuan\u2019s, but ranked ahead of Xu Shou.\nZhou Yao and Feng Xiaoyu performed normally, and there would be no problem for them in getting admitted to a key university. Cheng Yue\u2019s grades had always been at the bottom, and this time the score was estimated to be only second to last.\nBut Cheng Yue was very optimistic, and laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be second to last, my mother\u2019s expectation for me before the college entrance examination was to be able to get a bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201d\nYu Le, an old classmate, also sent a message to Su Miaomiao, saying that she performed exceptionally well in the college entrance examination, and her score was more than 30 points higher than her conservative estimate.\n\u201cMiaomiao, it\u2019s all thanks to you. I was very nervous before the exam, and I was under a lot of pressure. After taking a picture with you that day, I was suddenly very moved. I cried a lot, as if I cried out all the pressure. Woohoo, when you come back, I will definitely go out with you, and I will hug you again!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was praised, so she specially played the voice message for Xie Jingyuan to listen to.\nXie Jingyuan remembered the few times she rubbed against Yu Le.\nAccording to some studies in that world, the intimacy from pets could help people reduce stress, and maybe Su Miaomiao\u2019s few strokes did inadvertently have some unexpected effects.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s college entrance examination results ranked last in the group of four, but in the arena, she became the biggest dark horse of that Wimbledon, rushed to the final at the age of 18 years, and finally lost to a foreign veteran.\nAfter that match, Su Miaomiao was exhausted, and Xie Jingyuan had to carry her on his back after receiving the trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The muscles and joints inside must also be strained.\nEven if Su Miaomiao used spiritual energy to cultivate at night, it would not be able to alleviate that kind of injury. For the sake of fairness in the competition, Xie Jingyuan could only wait until all the competition was over to help her heal as much as possible.\n\u201cWas it hard?\u201d As night fell, Xie Jingyuan sat by the bed and asked in a low voice.\nSu Miaomiao was eating, and she looked at the trophy on the bedside table, and then thought about the prize money of the competition, and said proudly, \u201cIt\u2019s not, in terms of making money, am I better than you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded cooperatively.\nAs soon as they talked about such a thing, Gu Jialing made a video call from his resort, flattering Su Miaomiao in various ways.\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cYou suddenly are saying something so nice, do you want me to buy you a gift?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cOf course you can give me one, but if you don\u2019t, I will still praise you. You really brought honor to our temple!\u201d\nThe two of them seemed to have a lot to say when they saw each other, so Xie Jingyuan looked at the time and reminded her, \u201cIt\u2019s time to sleep.\u201d\nGu Jialing ended the video tactfully.\nXie Jingyuan took away Su Miaomiao\u2019s tableware and turned off the lights for her before going out.\nAt the end of August, Su Miaomiao was going to the United States to play a game, but because of the time conflict between the schedule and the start of the university year at Beijing University, Xie Jingyuan did not accompany her, and was replaced by Su Mingan.\nXie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing arrived at Beijing University first.\nGu Jialing spent a whole summer vacation outside, but just studied while playing. He even drew the floor plan of each resort, and marked the areas that he thought were good or needed improvement. Because of his plans, the old man of the Gu family finally accepted his grandson\u2019s major and dream. Before that, the old man always thought that he was just whimsical and just wanted to play.\nXu Shou worked part-time for two months.\nAt the dinner party on the night after the college entrance examination, Xie Rong heard that Xu Shou was looking for a part-time job, and that his future employment goal was still at the top of the company. Therefore, he offered an olive branch to Xu Shou, his son\u2019s best friend.\nThe part-time job that Xie Rong arranged for Xu Shou was his accompanying assistant, who was responsible for his personal security, and also completed the daily chores.\nWhenever Xie Rong was on a business trip, Xu Shou had to follow. If he attended the meeting, Xu Shou also went to it. Xie Rong was handling various affairs within the group, Xu Shou was a bystander.\nAfter two months, Xu Shou still thought that Xie Rong was a bad father, but he admired his ability.\n\u201cTaoist Master, what have you done besides going abroad with Su Miaomiao?\u201d Gu Jialing asked curiously.\nXie Jingyuan was just reading books and various academic reports and papers non-stop.\nNot only did he choose a double major, but he also set himself the goal of obtaining a double doctorate within four years.\nSuch geniuses were rare, but they had appeared in that world both at home and abroad. Xie Jingyuan not only had that kind of talent, but also possessed a cultivation level that others did not have.\nOrdinary people needed at least a certain amount of sleep to maintain health, but Xie Jingyuan could recover from the fatigue of the brain and body by meditating for an hour.\nThere were no demons in that world, but those harmful bacteria and viruses were demons in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes.\nAt the end of the US Open, Su Miaomiao lost to the same Grand Slam veteran in the final.\nGu Jialing conducted a remote interview with Su Miaomiao, \u201cAre you angry?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhy would I be angry?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cYou always lose to the same person. Without her, you would be the champion, and your prize money would be doubled.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cBut she is very good at tennis, I like to play with her.\u201d\nXu Shou looked down on Gu Jialing, \u201cYour awareness is not as high as that of the cat.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe was a bird, and no one stipulated that the consciousness of a bird was higher than that of a cat.\nBesides, it was because he didn\u2019t choose sports. Otherwise, with his strength, he would definitely be able to win the championship in some aspects.\nXie Jingyuan did not appear in that video call, he sent a message to Su Miaomiao alone: \u200b\u200bWhen will you be back?\nSu Miaomiao: On the 14th, my dad said that it happens to be Saturday in China.\nIn fact, for Xie Jingyuan, Saturdays and Sundays during college were the same as working days, as he was just as busy.\nBut he just replied: Well, send me the flight details, we will pick you up.\nOn Saturday, Xie Jingyuan calculated the time and called Xu Shou and Gu Jialing to set off together.\nHowever, when they arrived at the airport, they discovered that a large number of reporters had gathered there.\nGu Jialing sighed, \u201cIs it because they want to interview Su Miaomiao?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cIt should be.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan sent Su Miaomiao a message, although she would not see it until the plane landed.\nGu Jialing remembered that there was a suit store in the airport, so he smiled and ran away.\nA few minutes later, Gu Jialing sent a message to Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou in the restroom: Come and find me!\n\u201cWhy are you wearing this?\u201d Xu Shou asked suspiciously when he saw the black suits that Gu Jialing had prepared for them.\nGu Jialing: \u201cOf course we have to pretend to be bodyguards. Otherwise, if we get close to Su Miaomiao, reporters will definitely chase us and ask us what our relationship is with Su Miaomiao. Think about it, many students misunderstood the Taoist master and Su Miaomiao. If these reporters catch us, people all over the country may misunderstand, and even misunderstand that you or I are Su Miaomiao\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d\nAmong the group of four, Gu Jialing knew it the best.\nWhen he was still a primary school student, some neighbors praised Gu Jialing for his good singing, saying that he could be a star in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Gu Jialing immediately lost interest in being a celebrity.\nHe just liked to sing but he didn\u2019t want to be chased and intercepted.\nXu Shou thought of a newspaper with a photo of him and Su Miaomiao posted on the newspaper, and the text describing them as a couple.\nHe, who was about 1.8 meters tall and physically strong, suddenly shivered, and without further ado, took his suit and went to change.\nXie Jingyuan also cooperated with Gu Jialing\u2019s plan.\nThe three put the changed clothes into the car of the Gu family.\nBecause Gu Jialing thought the boys\u2019 dormitory was too dirty and messy, he talked to the old man before university officially started, and rented a house near it. The old man sent his driver and life assistant for his grandson and bought a low-key and luxurious car.\nAfter a lot of tossing, the three of them waited for more than ten minutes, and the figures of Su Miaomiao and Su Mingan, father and daughter, appeared.\nSu Mingan was wearing a black suit, dragging the suitcase with one hand and wrapping his arms around his daughter\u2019s shoulders, like a father and a bodyguard.\nSu Miaomiao was wearing a white hat and dress, more like a spoiled little princess.\nXie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing squeezed ahead of the reporters and came to the father and daughter.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cDon\u2019t talk.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t want to give reporters any chance to spread rumors that he was in love with Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao stared at them.\nSu Mingan was quite satisfied with the self-consciousness of the three college students in protecting his daughter, and said with a smile, \u201cLet\u2019s talk in the car.\u201d\nFour men with both height and strength surrounded Su Miaomiao. Except for Su Mingan who answered a few questions for his daughter, they didn\u2019t communicate much with the reporters and came to Gu Jialing\u2019s car smoothly.\u00a0\nOnly four people could sit in the car, so Xu Shou took the initiative and said, \u201cGo, I\u2019ll take a taxi.\u201d\nIn that way, no matter how much the reporters made up, they couldn\u2019t think of him and Su Miaomiao being a couple.\nLooking at the black luxury car driving away, Xu Shou breathed a sigh of relief.\nIn the car, Gu Jialing was sitting in the front passenger seat, while Su Mingan stood in the back row like a mountain between Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan.\n\u201cHere, this is our gift for you,\u201d Gu Jialing took out an ice cream from the car refrigerator and handed it to Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao had been strictly controlling her diet throughout the game, and had not eaten ice cream for a long time, so she was very happy to receive ice cream.\n\u201cMiaomiao is amazing, you brought glory to our country,\u201d the driver also boasted with a smile.\nBack then, when he saw Su Miaomiao for the first time, he thought she was a quiet and good girl, but who would have thought that she was actually a tennis genius.\nSu Mingan was the proudest.\nHe used to praise his daughter for being good at tennis with his relatives, friends and business partners, and that she would win a grand slam in the future. They said it sounded good on the surface, but in fact they didn\u2019t take it seriously. So everyone could see that his precious daughter could achieve it! Even foreign grand slam veterans were particularly fond of his daughter, and they exchanged contact information enthusiastically.\nSu Miaomiao concentrated on eating the ice cream.\nSu Mingan looked at Xie Jingyuan, pointed to the suit on his body and said, \u201cYou guys are pretty smart, you pretended to be bodyguards.\u201d\nGu Jialing immediately claimed the credit, \u201cI thought of it. Those reporters are the best at making rumors. We don\u2019t want to be misunderstood by them.\u201d\nSu Mingan knew that he didn\u2019t want to. As for Xie Jingyuan, he knew how to be considerate for his daughter on such a big occasion, which made him very grateful.\nWith his daughter being so innocent, Su Mingan didn\u2019t want her privacy to be exposed to the public eye.\n\u201cHow is the university? Is it okay studying two majors together?\u201d Su Mingan took the initiative to ask the children about their university life.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\nGu Jialing laughed, turned his head and said to Su Mingan, \u201cUncle, you don\u2019t know, our Taoist master has become famous on the Internet since we entered the university. At the beginning, two universities competed for him, and the Taoist master made a lot of conditions, such as allowing him to choose courses by himself, including skipping grades under the premise of meeting the skipping standards, Beijing University agreed, so now the Taoist master can skip some ordinary freshman classes and attend sophomore or even junior professional courses. The Internet gave him the title of \u2018Prodigy\u2019.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe knew that Xie Jingyuan was great since he was a child, but he didn\u2019t expect that he could continue to stand out in a place like Beijing University where there were many top students.\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s studies were beyond his ability to evaluate, so Su Mingan asked Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing: \u201cI\u2019ll just take a step at a time. I don\u2019t have any ambitions. Why do I need to get myself so tired?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glanced at him, and said to Su Mingan, \u201cFather, Gu Jialing rented a house outside, and I want to rent a house too.\u201d\nShe had seen the pictures of the university dormitory Gu Jialing posted in the group, it was really too small. Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to live in it at all.\nNot to mention that the roommates were all strangers, even if it was the Taoist master and the three of them, she would have to move out.\nSu Mingan\u2019s brows twitched fiercely.\nHe also wanted to provide his daughter with comfortable living conditions, and his family was fully equipped with that kind of economic level. The problem was, if his daughter stayed in a dormitory with her roommates at night, he would feel at ease. If he rented a house outside, wouldn\u2019t it be an opportunity for Xie Jingyuan?\nEighteen years old was indeed an adult, but in Su Mingan\u2019s heart, his daughter still had a childish temper, and he still couldn\u2019t accept that his daughter and Xie Jingyuan would progress in the relationship to that point.\nSu Mingan coaxed her daughter, \u201cTry it first, maybe you will like it. If you really can\u2019t stand it, then move out.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "117": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-117/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGu Jialing said casually, \u201cUncle, why don\u2019t you let Miaomiao live with me? I rented a four-bedroom apartment, and the Taoist master and Xu Shoufei want to live in the dormitory. It\u2019s kind of boring that my place is deserted.\u201d\nWhen Su Mingan gave him a hard look, he immediately retracted his neck.\nThe driver didn\u2019t know what to say about him. Which parent could rest assured that their daughter was sharing an apartment with a boy no matter how good friends they were, unless they were girls?\nUnder Su Mingan\u2019s forcible suppression, the topic of renting a house came to an end.\nThe luxury car drove all the way to the gate of Beijing University.\nBefore getting out of the car, Xie Jingyuan took off his suit jacket on the white shirt.\nThe two \u201cbodyguards\u201d immediately turned back to college students, but their appearance and figure were still outstanding.\nWhen Su Miaomiao joined Beijing University at the beginning of the semester, it was Xie Jingyuan who completed the reporting procedures for her.\u00a0\nBefore Xu Shou arrived, Xie Jingyuan and Gu Jialing took the father and daughter to Su Miaomiao\u2019s dormitory.\nSu Miaomiao reported for administrative management.\nThat was what she picked out by herself from a page full of professional titles, which surprised her two seniors and three friends.\nAt that time, Gu Jialing teased Su Miaomiao, \u201cI thought you would choose jewelry design or jewelry appraisal.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cI thought it would be English.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t say anything.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him and said, \u201cI want to study administrative management. When our Taoist master opens a pharmaceutical company, I can go to his company to help.\u201d\nAt that time, Su Mingan looked at Xie Jingyuan in a wrong way.\nXie Jingyuan still said the same thing, \u201cYou have to choose what you are interested in.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was not interested in any major. She was already playing tennis, which she was most interested in. The reason for going to college was to continue to be with the Taoist master.\nApart from the factor of liking, Su Miaomiao chose a major that she thought would be most useful to her.\nShe had studied it carefully, and found that the major of administrative management was relatively easy compared to other majors, and she could help the Taoist master after graduation. In that world, they could help, even if one day they suddenly returned to their previous life, Su Miaomiao could also help him take care of the common affairs in Qingxu Temple.\nAs long as she could help the Taoist master, he would have no reason to drive her away.\nThe time they spent together in the previous life was too short, but after eighteen years in the new world, Su Miaomiao discovered early on that staying with the Taoist master was the most comfortable.\nIf one day the Taoist master would not support her, she could go join her father\u2019s company.\nDownstairs in the dormitory, Xie Jingyuan and Gu Jialing stood as they were not allowed to go up. Su Mingan, as a parent, could only go up to help Su Miaomiao clean up the dormitory after registration, and then come down immediately after that.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait downstairs.\u201d\nThere were chairs in the hall, Gu Jialing pulled Xie Jingyuan to sit on them.\nUpstairs, Su Mingan carried the suitcase and climbed up to the fourth floor in one go.\nThe students of Beijing University were very eager to learn. Although it was Saturday, most of the students had gone to class or self-study. The dormitory building was quiet, and occasionally the girls were talking, laughing or singing.\nSu Miaomiao lived in 403, she took out the key and wanted to open the door, but Su Mingan held his daughter back and knocked on the door first. He was a man, what if the girls inside were only wearing pajamas.\u00a0\nSome voices came from inside, and someone said in a suppressed excited voice, \u201cSu Miaomiao, it\u2019s Su Miaomiao!\u201d\nBefore that summer vacation, Su Miaomiao was only well-known in the tennis circle. After she won the runner-up in the two international competitions during the summer vacation, there were overwhelming reports in China just when she entered the main match. Of course, the first roommate already knew her very well.\nOrdinary outstanding people may still be envied by others, like Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao, everyone only admired them.\nThe three roommates quickly cleaned up the dormitory at the speed of a tornado, and then came to open the door together.\nSu Miaomiao saw three enthusiastic, shy, or excited smiling faces. Every girl looked at her with sparkling eyes, full of love and kindness.\nShe also smiled.\n\u201cWow, Miaomiao, you are more beautiful than in the videos!\u201d\n\u201cUncle is so handsome!\u201d\nThe father and daughter received a warm reception from the roommates.\nAfter entering the dormitory and closing the door, Su Mingan found that three roommates had reserved a lower bunk on the south side near the balcony for his daughter, where the light was very good.\nThe female classmate who slept on the upper bunk of Su Miaomiao said, \u201cDo you like the lower bunk? If you don\u2019t like it, we can switch.\u201d\nShe originally occupied the lower berth, but after learning that the last roommate who had not arrived was Su Miaomiao, she moved to the upper berth again, thinking that Su Miaomiao, who would be climbing up and down, might not like it.\nSu Miaomiao looked closely at the narrow bed, then at Su Mingan, her eyes were full of grievances.\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIn his opinion, the conditions of the university dormitory were really good. When he was in university, there were eight people living in a room.\nHowever, as parents, whenever possible, they wanted their children to be satisfied in all\u00a0 aspects, and they didn\u2019t want them to suffer even a little.\nSu Mingan tried to imagine his daughter\u2019s life in the dormitory.\nHis daughter would definitely go to bed at ten o\u2019clock in the evening. Wasn\u2019t the time too early for college students? He didn\u2019t want his daughter to accommodate others, and he didn\u2019t want the girls to accommodate for his daughter.\nHis daughter\u2019s sleeping appearance had been dishonest since she was a child, and she liked to roll around. What if his daughter rolled to the ground in such a small bed?\nHis daughter was a bit of a clean freak. In summers, whenever he came back sweating unless he took a shower immediately, his daughter would not sit next to him.\nNo matter how clean the roommates were, if there were more people, there would be more or less mess, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Wouldn\u2019t it be more pitiful to be isolated by her roommates for a long time?\nSu Mingan couldn\u2019t think about it anymore, he was afraid that he would cry in front of the girls.\nFirst, he took out the gifts he specially prepared for the three roommates from the suitcase. After giving them, Su Mingan made the bed and quilt cover for his daughter.\nA roommate smiled and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cYour father is so kind, my mother helped to set up my bed.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao continued to stare quietly at her bad father.\nSu Mingan made the bed, tidied up his daughter\u2019s desk, and then explained to the three roommates, \u201cMiaomiao plays tennis, and she will have a training plan sooner or later. In order to facilitate her training, and also not to disturb you by going in and out too early or coming back too late, we rented a house for her outside, but Miaomiao will come to the dormitory to rest after class during the day, and occasionally come in the evening. Her situation is special, I hope you can understand, and try to help her with her studies.\u201d\nAfter hearing that, Su Miaomiao was finally able to smile again.\nWhen she smiled, the roommates felt that the dormitory seemed brighter.\n\u201cUncle, don\u2019t worry, we understand. In the future, if Miaomiao misses class, we will lend her the notes.\u201d\nSu Mingan breathed a sigh of relief, and said happily, \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t help you with your studies, but Miaomiao will be participating in other competitions in the future. As long as you want to watch, the plane ticket and the ticket to watch the game will be covered by me!\u201d\nThe roommates jumped up excitedly and hugged Su Miaomiao one after another.\nSu Mingan winked at his daughter.\nSu Miaomiao stood obediently and let them hug her.\nThe new roommates gave her the feeling of Yu Le in the first class of high school, which she didn\u2019t hate.\nSu Miaomiao gave autographs to all three new roommates, and then left with her father.\nWhen the three enthusiastic girls returned to the dormitory and closed the door, Su Mingan\u2019s expression immediately became complicated.\nHe didn\u2019t regret his temporary soft-heartedness, he really wanted his daughter to sleep comfortably every day, but when he thought that his daughter living alone would create a lot of opportunities for Xie Jingyuan, Su Mingan\u2019s heart felt like it was being twisted with all kinds of entanglements.\n\u201cDad, you are so kind,\u201d Su Miaomiao was so pleasantly surprised that she hugged her father\u2019s arm and acted like a baby.\nSu Mingan touched the top of his daughter\u2019s head, trying to suppress the restlessness in his heart.\nThe father and daughter went down the stairs.\nThe aunt caught a glimpse of them and straightened the registration book on the table.\nSu Mingan wrote down the departure time, and then he looked at the three boys who came over\u2014\u2014Xu Shou, who was left behind because he took a taxi alone, also arrived.\n\u201cUncle, do you want to go out to eat, or should we treat you to the cafeteria?\u201d Gu Jialing was very enthusiastic.\nSu Mingan: \u201cLet\u2019s go to the cafeteria.\u201d\nHe wanted to visit the place where his daughter would eat for the next four years.\nWhile walking, Su Mingan also took out his phone and took a few short videos, for his wife to watch at home.\nAll of them had outstanding looks in that line of work, attracting a lot of attention, but even if someone there had seen the video of Su Miaomiao playing tennis or her picture in receiving the award, they just forgot about it after watching it. Unless one frequently appeared in the public eye like celebrities, or had a recognizable appearance like Yao Ming, sports stars were not particularly recognizable among the public, let alone a new star like Su Miaomiao.\nThe three roommates were so excited because they knew Su Miaomiao\u2019s identity from the teacher in advance.\nTherefore, although the five people did make many heads turn, it did not cause any sensation among the crowd. At most, a few people raised their phones to secretly take pictures.\nBefore the peak meal time, the cafeteria was quite empty.\nThe five of them chose their meals and walked to a corner next to the floor-to-ceiling windows with their plates.\nGu Jialing: \u201cHow are your roommates? Did you get along with each other well?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, dad said that he\u2019s going to rent a house for me outside.\u201d\nNeither Gu Jialing nor Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou showed any surprise.\nGu Jialing: \u201cI\u2019ve said it a long time ago, even I can\u2019t stand it, you are a squeamish cat\u2026 How can a person like you share a room with people? Uncle, do you really want to rent another house, my\u2026\u201d\nUnder the table, Xie Jingyuan kicked him.\nGu Jialing changed his words wittily, \u201cMy community is pretty good. It is the newest community in the vicinity. The others are all old communities. There are no elevators and they are all small apartments of fifty or sixty square meters. Miaomiao will definitely not be able to bear it.\u201d\nWhen Su Mingan arrived by car, he realized that there were very few newly built high-rise residences like the ones that could be seen everywhere in Anshi in that area.\nA place where every inch of land was expensive had its own urban planning.\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at your place after dinner,\u201d Su Mingan also knew Gu Jialing very well, and that kid would never wrong himself when it came to basic necessities of life.\nXu Shou: \u201cI have class in the evening, so I won\u2019t go with you.\u201d\nHe also chose a double major, and his weekends were almost full of courses.\nSu Mingan looked at Xie Jingyuan, who was just eating his own food.\nSu Mingan was quite satisfied, if Xie Jingyuan left him and his daughter to go to class, it would be a betrayal of his wife\u2019s trust in him.\nAfter leaving the cafeteria, Xu Shou went to the teaching building, while Xie Jingyuan and Gu Jialing accompanied the father and daughter to the campus.\nGoing out of the west gate and turning right, walking for ten minutes like a walk, one would arrive at the lakeside community.\nGu Jialing lived in 801, Building 7. There were two floors and three households. The side units were four-bedroom apartments of 120 square meters, and the middle unit was a three-bedroom apartment of 90 square meters.\nThat was all the experience Gu Jialing had accumulated after seeing several apartments in the same community.\nAfter seeing so many, of course Gu Jialing chose the one with the best decoration.\n\u201cUncle, you and Miaomiao can stay with me tonight, don\u2019t go looking for a hotel.\u201d Gu Jialing showed his enthusiasm again, and pushed open the door of the third bedroom, \u201cLook, the quilt inside, the curtains are all new, and I let the landlord take away the old ones, but the Taoist master is so ungrateful that he didn\u2019t want to move in with me.

Compared with the dormitory, they were simply luxurious rooms.\nGu Jialing\u2019s heart was quite delicate, one of the second bedrooms he prepared had pink sheets and quilts, and the curtains were all pink.\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cI like white.\u201d\nGu Jialing also hummed at her, \u201cYou won\u2019t live here, this room has nothing to do with you.\u201d\nSu Mingan said, \u201cUntil I find a house, Miaomiao will stay here first, I will sleep next door.\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, he asked Gu Jialing, \u201cDo you need a red envelope from uncle?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cNo, you are my real father.\u201d\nSu Mingan hit him with a fist.\nXie Jingyuan always stood silently behind them.\nSu Mingan looked at him and said, \u201cTell Miaomiao about your university life first, and I\u2019ll go out to see if there are any houses for rent.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cI will go with you.\u201d\nSu Mingan glanced at Gu Jialing, \u201cNo need, you have no experience in renting a house, so you don\u2019t understand anything.\u201d\nAs soon as he left, Gu Jialing immediately rushed toward Su Miaomiao, wanting to hug the powerful cat.\nXie Jingyuan stood in front of Su Miaomiao in time, and asked coldly, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cHug her, it\u2019s like this in the live broadcast, when the player wins the game, the coach and teammates around her would run to hug her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIts okay at that time, but now it will be suspected of sexual harassment.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWas he that kind of bird? Even if he was, the object of his harassment would not be a cat!\n\u201cSu Miaomiao, do you think so too? Don\u2019t you want me to hug you?\u201d Gu Jialing asked angrily when his character was questioned.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t really care, but what the Taoist master said must be right.\nSeeing her nodding, Gu Jialing went to the master bedroom with an injured heart and closed the door forcefully on purpose.\nSu Miaomiao blinked, looked at Xie Jingyuan again, suddenly threw herself into his arms, hugged him with open arms, and gently rubbed her head on his chest.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s body froze, his eyes fell on the door of the master bedroom, and he asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao closed her eyes, and took a deep breath of the clear autumn dew smell on his body, \u201cI\u2019ve been missing you since a long time.\u201d\nIt had been more than a month since she went to the United States with her father.\nAt the airport, she wanted to hug the Taoist master, but she never had the chance.\nXie Jingyuan was silent for a few seconds, then raised his hand to touch her head, \u201cWas the competition very hard? Did you get injured this time?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cMy right knee still hurts.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan let her sit on the sofa, and his palm covered her right knee.\nAll spiritual power was exhausted, Xie Jingyuan raised his eyes, and just about to ask her how she was feeling, when he saw her hugging the pillow with both hands, looking at him seriously with big eyes. The corners of her mouth turned up happily, and he didn\u2019t know what she was smiling at.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his gaze, \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao raised her legs and said happily, \u201cIt\u2019s okay now, you are really powerful.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan smiled, and took out a folded A4 paper from his pocket, \u201cThis is your class schedule for this semester. It has been two weeks since university started. I asked Zhao Lu, your roommate, to help you take notes. You can go to her, and make up for it on weekends. The books are all in the room, even if you live outside in the future, try to stay with your roommates during the day, and they will remind you of any arrangements in the class.\u201d\nFrom kindergarten to high school, except that she had to learn by herself, he took care of almost all other trivial matters.\nUniversity was a whole new way of life.\nXie Jingyuan spent eighteen years helping her develop good study habits. In the four years of university, he decided to deliberately reduce the time with her to cultivate her self-reliance.\nSu Miaomiao was still studying the new schedule, so she didn\u2019t notice the complicated look in his eyes.\nGu Jialing came out. As if forgetting the unpleasantness, he sat on the other side of Su Miaomiao and asked how much bonus she got.\nWhen Su Miaomiao reported the number, Gu Jialing\u2019s eyes became bright immediately, \u201cOkay, you and the Taoist master could both make money, a few million, and it\u2019s only me and Xu Shou\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cXu Shou has worked part-time for two months, and he has already saved enough tuition for four years of college.\u201d\nGu Jialing was not convinced, \u201cThat\u2019s because Uncle Xie gave too much.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cXie Rong is very fair in this respect, Xu Shou\u2019s ability is worthy of the salary he gets.\u201d\nGu Jialing stopped talking.\nAt that time, the voice of Su Mingan talking to someone came from the corridor.\nGu Jialing pricked up his ears and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s the tenant of 802 next door, a couple who just graduated from college, and the girl is quite pretty.\u201d\nHe raised his eyebrows at Su Miaomiao suggestively. The cat\u2019s father wouldn\u2019t cheat behind the cat mother\u2019s back, right?\nAs soon as the idea came to an end, the female tenant said, \u201cIf you pester me again, I\u2019ll call the police!\u201d\nThe three hurried out to check the situation.\nIn the corridor, Su Mingan looked embarrassed.\nThe young female tenant who was about to open the door with the key was stunned when she saw the two new faces beside Gu Jialing.\nSu Mingan explained sincerely, \u201cLook, she is my daughter, and she is a good friend with this kid. I was really worried about her renting a house outside, so I wanted them to live next door and take care of each other.\u201d\nIt was impossible for his daughter to live in the same flat with Gu Jialing. Su Mingan was worried about her being far away, so he wanted to compensate the tenant next door with double the rent, so that his daughter could rent there.\nSu Mingan\u2019s luck was good, because the young couple next door worked a bit far away, they were just planning to rent another place recently.\nThe misunderstanding was cleared up, and it was confirmed that Su Mingan was not a bad man. The female tenant exchanged contact information with Su Miaomiao, and said she would give the Su family an answer after discussing it with her boyfriend at night.\nSu Mingan breathed a sigh of relief, and went back to 801.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If anything happens to Miaomiao in the future, I can help her.\u201d\nSu Mingan snorted heavily.\nSu Miaomiao asked suspiciously, \u201cFather, don\u2019t you want the Taoist master to move here?\u201d\nSu Mingan coughed again, and said reluctantly, \u201cNo, you are not familiar with the place here. So I will feel more at ease if the two of you live next to each other.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan suddenly understood Su Mingan\u2019s concerns.\nBut it was not the occasion to make promises.\u00a0\nSu Mingan looked at the time and said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cOkay, we are going to sleep, you should go back to school too.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at Su Miaomiao and left.\nAt ten o\u2019clock in the evening, when Su Miaomiao was asleep, the young couple next door knocked on the door, expressing their willingness to accept Su Mingan\u2019s conditions.\nSu Mingan offered an extra 5,000 yuan for them to move out the next morning, because he wanted to help his daughter settle into 802 as soon as possible, and then rush back to Anshi for business.\nThe young couple collected the money and acted very quickly. They packed their luggage overnight, and the moving company came to the door early the next morning.\nSu Mingan re-signed the lease contract with the landlord, and the lease would last for four years.\nAs for the bed and cabinets in 802, Su Mingan also asked the landlord to take them away, and he wanted to buy new ones for his daughter.\nSu Miaomiao went to the dormitory for tutoring, and Su Mingan took the warm-hearted Gu Jialing to the home furnishing store.\nAfter running around for a day, at night, 802 had completely changed its appearance under Su Mingan\u2019s hands.\nThe master bedroom was Su Miaomiao\u2019s bedroom, and there were two secondary bedrooms, one for the cloakroom and one for the gym.\nThere was no TV in the living room, so Su Mingan bought a wall-mounted bookcase and kept his daughter\u2019s books and trophies there.\nThe curtains and sofas had been replaced with light colors, and some green plants and flowers had been added, which was warm and beautiful.\nGu Jialing enviously said, \u201cUncle, you\u2019re worthy of running a decoration company, why don\u2019t you help us modify 801?\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cI don\u2019t have time, I have to go back to Anshi tomorrow afternoon.\u201d\nGu Jialing was still a little bit reluctant.\nSu Mingan\u2019s heart moved, he put his arm around Gu Jialing\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cI have a task for you. If you do it, then if you want to decorate the resort in the future, I will do it for you.\u201d\nGu Jialing nodded, \u201cWhat task? You can just say it.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for a girl to live by herself. You have to protect Miaomiao for me, if a man comes to her, no matter who it is, you have to stay by Miaomiao\u2019s side.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cUnderstood, I promise.\u201d\nWhoever dared to bully the cat would be attacking their Qingxugu Temple!\nSu Mingan had deep meaning in his eyes, \u201cNo one, including Xu Shou, including Jing Yuan.\u201d\nGu Jialing continued to pat his chest, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, even if it\u2019s you, I will keep an eye on you!\u201d\nAfter tidying up the house all day, Su Mingan was actually very tired, but it was Monday morning. He slept until 5:00 and got up, checked each room, and found that the white paint on the wall was dirty, and wiped it carefully.\nWhen Su Miaomiao came out of the room, she saw her father standing in the living room on a step ladder, wiping something with a rag.\n\u201cHey, why did you get up so early, isn\u2019t class starting at eight o\u2019clock?\u201d Su Mingan looked at the wall clock and asked while continuing to wipe.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThe Taoist master said that we should develop the habit of getting up at six o\u2019clock in the future. We can rest for these two days, and then we will play tennis for an hour every morning.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cLet your coach come over, or should he continue to play with you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOn weekdays, the Taoist master will accompany me in the morning, and the coach is only responsible for the training when I have no classes in the afternoon. He will come to the university tennis center with the coach on weekends.\u201d\nSu Mingan was silent.\nHe remembered that when Xie Jingyuan was only in primary school, Xie Rong had mentioned that he had an opportunity to skip a grade, similar ones in junior high school and high school.\nXie Jingyuan refused all of them, even though his bookcase had long been filled with complicated subject books that even a college graduate could not understand.\nIf at first Su Mingan didn\u2019t understand what Xie Jingyuan was obsessed with, later on he understood that this kid wanted to be with his daughter all the time.\nSome companionship was to eat and play with, and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s companionship was to accompany his daughter to study and play, so that she would become more excellent.\nFriends and relatives all praised him and his wife for being able to teach their child, which made Su Mingan feel guilty. As his wife said, half of the credit for his daughter\u2019s excellence lay with herself, and the other half was all due to Xie Jingyuan.\nLeaving alone the past, even when Xie Jingyuan had chosen two majors, he still had to spare time to be a training partner for his daughter like he did in high school.\n\u201cLeave it, dad. Let\u2019s go to the cafeteria to have breakfast together later.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go change clothes.\u201d\nTen minutes later, the father and daughter went out, and Xie Jingyuan, Gu Jialing, and Xu Shou were already waiting outside.\nBecause Xie Jingyuan moved to 801, Xu Shou also came.\nThe room originally reserved for Su Miaomiao in 801 was converted into a study.\nSu Mingan looked at the three boys who were all over 185 in height, and thought that he didn\u2019t really have to worry about his daughter\u2019s safety.\nHe carried his daughter\u2019s bag and went to school with the four children.\nAfter breakfast, Su Mingan had to go back to help his daughter complete the decoration of the room, and made an appointment to come to the cafeteria at noon.\nAt the entrance of the cafeteria, Xie Jingyuan moved his bicycle, and said to Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, \u201cI\u2019ll take her to the classroom, you go to your own building first.\u201d\nGu Jialing was already sitting on the bicycle, with one foot on the ground, and said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s her first day, so let\u2019s go together to support her and see who dares to get any ideas about her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Even if there were no classes, they were marked as self-study.\nAlthough Gu Jialing\u2019s timetable was full enough, there were only two nights of classes.\nOnly Su Miaomiao had the emptiest timetable.\nAt seven o\u2019clock, the four of them came to her classroom for the first two classes of the day.\nIt was a professional classroom with more than thirty people, all of whom were students from Class 3 of administrative management.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s roommates had not arrived yet.\nIn order to achieve the effect of supporting Su Miaomiao, Gu Jialing suggested that they should study in that classroom in the morning, and they also wanted to occupy the four seats in the last row near the window on the south side.\nXu Shou grabbed him, pointed to the front row and said, \u201cSit there, girls like to sit in the front.\u201d\nIf they saw Su Miaomiao\u2019s roommates coming, the three of them would leave too, just to give seats to the girls.\nGu Jialing nodded.\nShe sat at the back, Xie Jingyuan next to her, then Gu Jialing and Xu Shou.\nThe three boys started to study by themselves. After Su Miaomiao put out the textbooks, she was still studying her and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s class schedule. The phone was turned on, and on the screen was the training plan formulated by the coach according to her class.\n\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked.\nSu Miaomiao said without raising her head, \u201cI don\u2019t have training at night, and I have free time in the morning on some days, so I\u2019ll come to your class.\u201d\nAs she spoke, she also copied Xie Jingyuan\u2019s courses and classrooms corresponding to the time on her schedule.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her serious profile and suddenly didn\u2019t know what to say.\nGu Jialing asked doubtfully, \u201cWhy will you go to his classes? You won\u2019t understand anything.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao finally raised her head and answered Gu Jialing, \u201cI can write my own homework. But tell me, if I go sit in his class, will the teacher kick me out?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and said, \u201cSome courses are experiments in the laboratory and there will be no place for you to sit.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen I\u2019ll watch you do the experiment.\u201d\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t quite understand, \u201cWhy do you insist on following the Taoist master?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao asked blankly, \u201cWhere should I go if I don\u2019t follow him?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cYou can go back to the dormitory to play with your roommates, or wander around the campus. There are quite a lot of fun things to do here. If you have nothing to do, you can go back to the room or the lakeside community to sleep. There are too many interesting things like a few clubs. What\u2019s the point of being bored in his classroom?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was not interested in what he said. According to the class schedule, she wouldn\u2019t have a long time to sleep except at night. For example, during the gap between two classes, she would rather go to the Taoist master and sleep next to him than travel to her room from the teaching building alone.\nXu Shou could understand Su Miaomiao\u2019s thoughts.\nHe also wanted to stay by the Taoist master\u2019s side all the time, but there were too many courses. He wanted to learn the human management company skills, so as to relieve the Taoist master from worries in the future.\nXu Shou put responsibility ahead of self-willedness. The cat had no sense of responsibility and only liked to do things she was interested in.\n\u201cTaoist Master, can I come to your classes?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked Xie Jingyuan directly.\nHis rationality told him that if he agreed, it might be difficult for Su Miaomiao to learn true independence in that life, but looking into her clear eyes, he was unable to ruthlessly force her, so he nodded.\nSu Miaomiao was very happy and continued to fill in the blanks on her schedule.\nGu Jialing shook his head, and whispered to Xu Shou, \u201cCats and dogs really cannot do without humans.\u201d\nWhere the Taoist master lived, they wanted to live, and wherever he went was where they went, which was really unbearable for the bird.\nAfter Su Miaomiao sorted out the schedule, she hurried to make up for the missed courses.\nThe students from Class 3 arrived one after another.\nThey had been in the class together for two weeks, and there were only thirty students in the class. They could basically call each student by name. That day, four new faces suddenly appeared in the classroom, and all of them were so good-looking.\n\u201cMiaomiao!\u201d\nWhen the three roommates from 403 came to the door and saw Su Miaomiao, they all ran over excitedly, \u201cWhy are you here so early?!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao raised her head from the textbook and recognized the three roommates one by one, namely Zhao Lu, Chen Ling, and Zhu Xingzhu, nicknamed Lulu, Lingling, and Zhuzhu.\n\u201cI\u2019m here for the classes.\u201d\nCompared to Su Miaomiao\u2019s calmness, Gu Jialing was much more enthusiastic. He stood up and introduced himself, \u201cYou are Miaomiao\u2019s roommates, right? We are Su Miaomiao\u2019s good friends, her high school alumni for three years. My name is Gu Jialing. Today is Miaomiao\u2019s first day in class, we were afraid she won\u2019t be able to find the classroom, so we came here with her.\u201d\nLooking at Gu Jialing\u2019s handsome face, the three blushed a little.\nXu Shou and Xie Jingyuan packed their bags silently and gave them their seats.\n\u201cMiaomiao is not very sensible sometimes, please take care of her more,\u201d Xie Jingyuan whispered to the three girls.\nThe three girls nodded in unison.\nGu Jialing looked at the other students, especially the boys in the class, and snorted, \u201cSu Miaomiao is our good friend, whoever dares to bully her, don\u2019t blame me for being rude.\u201d\nThe male toppers that were selected from all over the country: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nWas he sick?\nXu Shou grabbed Gu Jialing\u2019s arm and pulled him out of the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Before stepping out of the classroom, he stopped at the door, and scanned the faces of every boy in the classroom one by one.\nMale toppers: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe first seemed to be mentally ill, but that one also seemed to have some dangerous psychological problems.\nXie Jingyuan thought for a while, and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cIf you encounter trouble, call me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded with a smile.\nOnly then did he leave.\nZhao Lu sat next to Su Miaomiao, and asked her in a low voice, \u201cYou and Xie Jingyuan are boyfriend and girlfriend, right?\u201d\nThey met Xie Jingyuan on the first day of school, because he cared so much about Su Miaomiao, they also asked him the question.\nWhat Xie Jingyuan said was that they were just friends who grew up together.\nCould friends be considerate to that point?\nFacing the three pairs of expectant and smiling eyes, the kind of familiar eyes implying that Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t need to hide what they already knew, she thought for a while and admitted, \u201cYes.\u201d\nFor three years in high school, Su Miaomiao was really tired of answering the question countless times. Anyway, if she denied it, people around her would continue to misunderstand her. It was better to admit it, lest everyone kept asking. She didn\u2019t care about the false name.\nSure enough, Zhao Lu and the other three expressed their admiration for her and never questioned her.\nThe class was almost over, and Su Miaomiao received a message from her father saying that he was already in the cafeteria.\nAt the same time, Zhao Lu also asked her if she wanted to go to the cafeteria with them later.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to find my father, and I\u2019ll eat with Xie Jingyuan and the others in the future.\u201d\nZhao Lu and the three expressed their understanding.\nAfter class, the students were still packing their bags. Xie Jingyuan called and asked Su Miaomiao to wait downstairs to pick her up.\nShe smiled, carried her bag and went downstairs with her three roommates. The roommates walked away arm in arm. Su Miaomiao stood on the side of the road, looking left and right for a while.\nShe was still not familiar with the campus of Beijing University, and she didn\u2019t know where Xie Jingyuan and the others attend classes.\nIt was the end of class time, and students riding bicycles or walking rushed over like a flood, and they passed by Su Miaomiao.\nAlmost everyone noticed the girl in a white dress, with a shoulder-length ponytail, fair skin, and overly beautiful facial features.\nShe seemed to be waiting for someone, waiting obediently, without any impatience.\nSuddenly, she smiled in one direction.\nSomeone followed her gaze and saw a group of students riding bicycles. Among them was a boy in a white shirt, like a moving light, who was a natural protagonist.\nThe boy stopped beside the girl.\nIt was amazing, but not surprising, as if such a beautiful girl should have such a boyfriend.\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your bicycle have a basket?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao disliked Xie Jingyuan\u2019s new bicycle. Without the basket, there was no place to put their bags. Xie Jingyuan was carrying his bag on his back, and she couldn\u2019t even lean on him. Sitting upright was not comfortable at all.\nSeeing that she was so dissatisfied, Xie Jingyuan first took off his bag and hung it on the handlebar, then put hers on it too, one black and one white.\nSu Miaomiao was happy, jumped to the back seat of the bicycle, continued to wrap her arm around his waist with one hand, and put her head on it.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at the college students passing by, and set off on his bicycle.\n\u201cHow was the morning? Was the class difficult?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked while riding.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult, English class is simpler, and many new words were the ones I learned before.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\nAfter riding for a while, he suddenly heard her laugh, as if she was a little proud.\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d He glanced back.\nSu Miaomiao told him about the incident where Zhao Lu asked if the two were boyfriend and girlfriend.\n\u201cTaoist Master, am I very smart? This way, no one will bother me in the future.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan fell into silence.\nHe had no plan to marry and have children. It would be beneficial to bear the kind of misunderstanding, which would keep away those female students who were confused by his appearance, but she\u2026\n\u201cYou said that you will find someone to marry in the future. If this kind of misunderstanding spreads, you will have fewer suitors.\u201d Xie Jingyuan reminded her, \u201cNormal people would avoid meddling in other people\u2019s feelings.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at the nearby male college students, and said indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, when my parents start urging me to get married, I will choose the guy myself. I don\u2019t need them to pursue me.\u201d\nIt was no use chasing her if she didn\u2019t like him.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIf uncle and aunt won\u2019t urge you, will you still choose?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, after marriage, two people sleep in the same bed. I like to sleep by myself.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u2014\nSu Mingan booked a ticket for two o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\nThe parting was imminent, and the atmosphere at the table was a bit heavy.\nSu Miaomiao was actually fine, her parents had been very busy with work since she was a child, and she went to bed early at night. The person who had been with her the longest was Xie Jingyuan.\nSu Miaomiao liked her parents so much that although she was not interested in getting married, if her parents urged her to marry in the future, she would choose a suitable man to satisfy her parents\u2019 wishes and not let them worry about her. However, Su Miaomiao prefered to stay with the Taoist master. When she was abroad, she missed the Taoist master more than her mother and Grandma Tao.\nSince the Taoist master was at Beijing University, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t have much nostalgia for her home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He didn\u2019t dare to say too much, for fear that he would not be able to hold back his tears.\nGu Jialing understood his mood. Before he left, the old man had looked at him the same way.\n\u201cUncle, don\u2019t worry, with us here, no one would dare to bully Miaomiao,\u201d Gu Jialing assured him very loyally.\nSu Mingan nodded. It was useless to worry, as his daughter had grown up, and like other students on the campus, she was destined to take the step of leaving home.\nAfter eating, the four college students sent Su Mingan to the gate together.\nSu Mingan patted his daughter\u2019s head, \u201cCall Mom and me if you encounter any problems. We live so close, I can drive here in three hours.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded obediently.\nSu Mingan called Xie Jingyuan to the shade of a tree seven or eight meters away.\nFacing his overly calm face, Su Mingan was stuck.\nXie Jingyuan knew that the two elders had misunderstood his relationship with Su Miaomiao, and was afraid of delaying his time to catch the train, so he took the initiative to say, \u201cUncle, don\u2019t worry, my love for Miaomiao will stop at courtesy.\u201d\nThe misunderstanding had been deeply rooted and couldn\u2019t be explained clearly, so Xie Jingyuan directly promised.\nSu Mingan\u2019s expression became even more complicated.\nSu Mingan was also young, so he didn\u2019t believe Xie Jingyuan\u2019s guarantee at all, but the two children lived outside alone, so he couldn\u2019t stop what would happen.\nThousands of words were churning in his chest, and finally Su Mingan grabbed Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulders, and said, \u201cYour studies are important, and Miaomiao\u2019s competition is also important. She listens to you, and you have to be sensible. Don\u2019t make me a grandfather early!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Mingan grabbed his shoulders even harder, \u201cDon\u2019t think that just because I say that, you can be unscrupulous. If you can hold back until you graduate from college, I will treat you as my own son. If you take advantage of Miaomiao too early, then I\u2019ll never respect you in this life.\u201d\nIn fact, Xie Rong should have told Xie Jingyuan those words, but Su Mingan knew that the relationship between the father and son was not good. Xie Rong\u2019s status in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s heart was not as good as his, so he was the only one who could say that.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYes\u201d\nSu Mingan snorted heavily, waved to his daughter at the school gate, and reluctantly got into the taxi.\nXie Jingyuan watched the taxi drive away before returning to the three demons.\nGu Jialing asked curiously, \u201cWhat did uncle say to you? He looked so secretive.\u201d\u00a0\nCould it be that her father also assigned a task to the Taoist master?\nNaturally, Xie Jingyuan would not explain, \u201cLet\u2019s go back, we have a class in the afternoon.\u201d\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing rode away respectively.\nXie Jingyuan rode a bicycle and took Su Miaomiao to the campus of Beijing University during the lunch break.\n\u201cThe gym is in the third gymnasium. After the sixth class, you can come here directly and wait for the coach. The tennis court is in the second gymnasium. The coach will take you there. After playing, you have to wait for me there. In case you forget the way there, you can ask your classmates nearby, or you can look at the sign boards, which are all along the road.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at this and that, and sighed, \u201cThe campus of the university is really big.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWell, I remembered all this after staying here for a few days.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan continued to ride slowly toward the teaching building where Su Miaomiao was going to attend class later, and listened to her chatting on the phone.\n\u201cI\u2019ve arrived on Saturday. I\u2019m at the university now.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the dormitory. Dad rented a house for me outside.\u201d\n\u201cThe lakeside community, the Taoist master and the others are also there.\u201d\n\u201cNot together, they live in 801, and I live in 802.\u201d\n\u201cI have two classes later, and after that, I have to go to the gym for training.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, then you can come to the cafeteria and wait for us.\u201d\nAfter the call was over, Su Miaomiao put the phone back in her pocket.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cLin Xi?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYes, he wants to have dinner with us.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t say anything.\nWhen they arrived at the teaching building, it was already one o\u2019clock. Xie Jingyuan saw that the three roommates were in the classroom, so he told Su Miaomiao to stay with them. He watched her sit down at the door, and then left.\nZhao Lu said with emotion, \u201cI have also seen many campus couples, but you two are the stickiest.\u201d\nThis went in Su Miaomiao\u2019s left ear and out of her right ear. She fell asleep lying on the table as the class would start after twenty minutes.\nHer face was toward Zhao Lu, who couldn\u2019t help but look at her, and her heart was beating inexplicably.\nHow could there be such a beautiful girl!\nIf she was a boy, she would have her as a girlfriend. Zhao Lu thought that she would even be clingier than Xie Jingyuan!\nAt 1:25, the teacher walked into the classroom.\nThe twenty-nine students in the class all quieted down, or read books, and got ready for the lecture.\nOnly Su Miaomiao slept soundly.\nThe teacher knew that there was a recommended student in the class who went abroad to participate in the competition, and he had seen Su Miaomiao\u2019s competition video. He was very tolerant of such an outstanding female student, and made a decision. Even if Su Miaomiao slept through two classes, he wouldn\u2019t interfere.\nZhao Lu wanted to wake Su Miaomiao up, but she slept so soundly that she couldn\u2019t bear it!\nMiraculously, when the bell rang, her eyelashes fluttered and she woke up.\nShe rubbed her eyes and sat upright.\nAfter waiting for a while, Su Miaomiao turned her head blankly as she didn\u2019t get the wet wipe that would be handed over to her to wipe her face the time she woke up.\nZhao Lu smiled at her.\nOnly then did Su Miaomiao remember that she was in a university, and the Taoist master studied another major.\nShe took out the wet wipes that the Taoist master had prepared for her from her bag.\nAfter a while, looking at the wrinkled wipes in her hand, Su Miaomiao pouted.\nIf the Taoist master was there, she wouldn\u2019t have to get the tissues, collect them, or throw them herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "124": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-124/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPut it here.\u201d\nSeeing Su Miaomiao staring at the wipes in a daze, Zhao Lu took out a plastic bag she used for garbage, opened the mouth of the bag, and motioned for her to throw it in.\nThe roommate was very nice, so she smiled at her, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nZhao Lu got a little dizzy, Su Miaomiao looked even better when she smiled!\nSo Su Miaomiao began to listen to the class, and after listening for a few minutes, she suddenly remembered that the Taoist master also prepared a garbage bag for her.\n\u201cEveryone has their own business. Don\u2019t bother others all the time. Once or twice is fine. But if there are too many times, people will hate you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like to be close to others, but she also didn\u2019t want to be disgusted by others.\nAfter that time, she never troubled the three roommates again.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s tennis coach was surnamed Fang. She was thirty-five years old that year. Both Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan called her \u201cSister Fang\u201d.\nSister Fang had a wrist injury, and she was mainly responsible for Su Miaomiao\u2019s physical fitness and skills. Because Xie Jingyuan, the best training partner, had classes in the afternoon, Sister Fang brought a male training partner over.\nFrom 3:30 to 4:30 in the afternoon, Su Miaomiao was training in the No. 1 Gymnasium.\nFrom 5:00 to 6:00, Su Miaomiao and her male partner played tennis continuously for an hour on the tennis court of the No. 2 Gymnasium.\nSo far, her training for the day was over, and Xie Jingyuan had also finished his class.\n\u201cWant to have dinner together?\u201d After Su Miaomiao took a shower and changed her clothes, Sister Fang asked with a smile, \u201cHow about I give you a treat today?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cI made an appointment with Taoist master to go to the cafeteria.\u201d\nFor someone who understood people and the world, they would invite Sister Fang, but Su Miaomiao did not.\nSister Fang didn\u2019t mind at all. The more talented a person was, the more they had their own personality. Perhaps it was because of Su Miaomiao\u2019s pure state of mind that she had no distractions on the field.\nThe three walked out of the gymnasium together, and saw Xie Jingyuan waiting outside.\nXie Jingyuan took the initiative to greet Sister Fang.\nSister Fang admired the handsome young man, and left the ground with her training partner.\nXie Jingyuan sent a message to Gu Jialing before leaving, and asked him who was already waiting in the cafeteria to order the meals for them, saving time in queuing.\nIn the cafeteria, Gu Jialing received the news and gestured to Xu Shou, \u201cLet\u2019s get some food, you get the Taoist master\u2019s, I\u2019ll get Su Miaomiao\u2019s, they\u2019ll be here in three minutes.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded.\nLin Xi was also there, following Gu Jialing in the same direction.\nHe stood behind him and watched as Gu Jialing ordered his favorite dishes first, and then helped Su Miaomiao choose vegetables, including fish and meat, shrimp and eggs.\nLin Xi had seen that attitude before, Su Miaomiao with Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan regarded Su Miaomiao as his younger sister. What about Gu Jialing, and Xu Shou, they also regarded her as their younger sister?\nIf it was friendship, could there really be such pure emotion between men and women?\nIf it was a secret love, how could Gu Jialing and Xu Shou get along with each other so harmoniously?\nLin Xi fell into confusion.\nThe three of them finished ordering and sat down at the dining table. Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao also arrived.\nSu Miaomiao just took a shower. Her hair was still a little wet, her cheeks were rosy after strenuous exercise, it was easy for people, especially men, to think of some ambiguous images.\nLin Xi didn\u2019t dare to look too much at her and looked away. He found that Gu Jialing and Xu Shou both took that image of Su Miaomiao calmly, their eyes were so pure that he was ashamed.\n\u201cLin Xi, do you have many classes?\u201d Su Miaomiao was shocked by Xie Jingyuan\u2019s and Xu Shou\u2019s class schedules, and when she saw Lin Xi, she also became concerned about his classes.\nLin Xi smiled wryly.\nInfected by Xie Jingyuan\u2019s diligence, he also chose to do a double major. There were so many courses that he didn\u2019t remember to contact Su Miaomiao until that day.\nHowever, there were many students around who chose double majors, which also stimulated Lin Xi\u2019s self-motivation, and he just wanted to work harder to study well, instead of regretting his choice.\nTaking out his phone, Lin Xi showed Su Miaomiao his class schedule.\nShe stopped reading when she saw those densely packed characters.\nLin Xi smiled and said, \u201cSpeaking of which, you are also doing a double major.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was a little proud, \u201cI don\u2019t have classes at night, and I don\u2019t need to train. It\u2019s much easier than you.\u201d\nLin Xi: \u201cReally, what are your plans for the evening?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan, \u201cI will accompany the Taoist master to his class.\u201d\nLin Xi\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\nGu Jialing despised Su Miaomiao in a low voice, \u201cClingy.\u201d\nNot only did he despise Su Miaomiao, he also looked at Xu Shou with contempt.\nThe curriculum for high school students was the same, it was very normal for Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan to be inseparable, but if it was like that in college, it must be because the relationship had changed.\nHe half-jokingly asked, \u201cYou two have finally confirmed your relationship?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan, who hadn\u2019t spoken since he sat down, temporarily stopped and looked at Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao was even more proud, \u201cYeah, anyway, those classmates like to misunderstand, so when I told them that I am really in a relationship with the Taoist master, they stopped bothering me.\u201d\nGu Jialing was a little confused, \u201cThen are you really a couple or fake?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOf course it\u2019s fake, how can the Taoist master break the precept?\u201d\nGu Jialing laughed, \u201cLet me just say, even if the Taoist master breaks the precept, the person will not be you.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded in agreement.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t look angry either, as if the words \u201cthe Taoist master breaking the precept\u201d was a joke that would never happen.\nLin Xi: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe only felt that there was a transparent membrane around the four and there were completely two worlds inside and outside the membrane.\nHe couldn\u2019t understand the joke, nor those four people\u2019s way of thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "125": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-125/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Gu Jialing present, the atmosphere was not so cold, so Lin Xi didn\u2019t feel excluded during the meal.\nWalking out of the cafeteria, Gu Jialing stepped on the bicycle and waved to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, I\u2019m going to the club, and I will definitely be home at ten o\u2019clock in the evening!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cPay attention to safety.\u201d\nGu Jialing reported to an opera club of Beijing University, which mainly organized members to learn and perform folk operas such as Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera.\nIn Gu Jialing\u2019s words, he could learn popular songs without any challenges. It was not as good as Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, but the effect of singing well was better.\nFor example, if Gu Jialing sang a pop song on the side of the road, the rate of turning heads would not be too high. With a Peking Opera voice, everyone would like to watch him.\nThat was what Gu Jialing was after.\nXie Jingyuan expressed his support for it. If Gu Jialing could learn something, it could be regarded as promoting traditional culture.\nGu Jialing walked away happily.\nXie Jingyuan and Xu Shou went to fetch their bicycles, while Su Miaomiao was waiting by the roadside.\nLin Xi looked at her, but still asked in a low voice, \u201cMiaomiao, if Xie Jingyuan wants to have a real relationship with you, will you agree to him?\u201d\nHe had a feeling that Xie Jingyuan\u2019s attitude to Su Miaomiao was not that simple.\nSu Miaomiao may still have a childish temper, but Xie Jingyuan did not.\nTo Lin Xi\u2019s question, Su Miaomiao nodded without thinking.\nThe Taoist master smelled good, cooked delicious food, was good at playing tennis, and was the best for her. He could help her solve any troubles, big or small. If she had to choose a man to marry, the Taoist master would be the best choice.\nIt was a pity that it was impossible for the Taoist master to break the precept, let alone agree to marry a demon like her.\nLin Xi got bitter.\nSecret love was a combination of sweetness and sourness. When she smiled at him it was sweet, but seeing her relying on Xie Jingyuan so much made him sour.\nBitterness was completely different, as if the sunny sky was suddenly covered with dark clouds, and his heart got heavy.\nBut Lin Xi was not an hesitant person.\nHe continued to ask, \u201cIf I also want to be your boyfriend, between me and Xie Jingyuan, who will you choose?\u201d\nSince he was suffering, it was better to suffer more thoroughly.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him unexpectedly.\nLin Xi\u2019s heartbeat quickened, and he promised, \u201cWhatever Xie Jingyuan can do, I can do it too.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cCan you cook?\u201d\nShe was willing to put forth a condition, meaning there was hope. Lin Xi nodded immediately, his eyes brighter than before.\nIn fact, he didn\u2019t know how to cook many dishes, but he could learn, for Su Miaomiao\u2019s sake.\nSu Miaomiao asked several questions one after another, such as cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the room, etc. Lin Xi promised to do it all.\nHis attention was all on Su Miaomiao. His heart was beating excitedly, he didn\u2019t realize that Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou had already rode over, they both stopped behind him, watching the question and answer between them silently.\nSu Miaomiao asked around, and was very satisfied with Lin Xi, \u201cThen it\u2019s settled, when my parents start urging me to get married, we two will get married.\u201d\nLin Xi was dumbfounded, \u201cMarried?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s how it is played on TV. The elders like to urge their children to get married.\u201d\nLin Xi smiled and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve just started university, we can date first, and then consider getting married after graduation.\u201d\nWhen she was really ready.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cHow to date?\u201d\nShe understood the meaning of the word love, but she had not studied the specific way of dating.\nLin Xi thought for a while, and looked at her tenderly, \u201cDating is, we will have meals together every day in the future, when you have no class, you can come to my classroom to listen to the class, and I will take you home after school, and you can also go to see a movie, or go on a date somewhere else.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to your classroom, I want to go to the Taoist master.\u201d\nFive people could eat and watch movies.\nLin Xi choked for breath.\nAt that time, Xie Jingyuan finally spoke, and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cIf you fall in love with him, you can\u2019t come to me again.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao frowned, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nXu Shou sneered, \u201cYou are stupid, love is between a man and a woman. If you love Lin Xi, you should only think about him all the time, want to be with him, instead of running the Taoist master, that would make Lin Xi uncomfortable. If you can\u2019t do this, your feelings for Lin Xi are not love, then you shouldn\u2019t agree to fall in love with him, live up to his feelings, and waste his time. \u201c\nWhen Su Miaomiao heard that, she immediately said to Lin Xi, \u201cForget it, I don\u2019t love you, and I don\u2019t want to fall in love with you.\u201d\nWhether she loved him or not, she just found Lin Xi pleasing to her eye and Lin Xi also took the initiative to come over, so she considered him as a future marriage partner.\nShe said the most straightforward rejection to Lin Xi, but her eyes were sincere and pure, without dislike or disgust, as if she simply stated a fact.\nIn those eyes, Lin Xi saw their kindergarten years.\nShe was like that all the time, she didn\u2019t want to help her classmates study, didn\u2019t want to share snacks, she just said what she wanted.\nShe was very smart and a top student, but sometimes she seemed to be stupid, so stupid that she didn\u2019t know anything about the world.\nBut that was good too. He had the answer, so he could completely give up and devote all his energy to studying.\nTherefore, Lin Xi smiled at Su Miaomiao, \u201cWell, we can\u2019t be lovers, but we are still friends, and you can contact me if you need anything.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded with a smile.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go first,\u201d Lin Xi bid farewell to the three with a pale face, and left by bicycle.\nHe was not riding fast, but his back revealed a trace of loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "126": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-126/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXu Shou expressed sympathy for him. Lin Xi was such a good child. It was not good to like the heartless cat.\nSu Miaomiao had already put that matter behind her, and skillfully jumped onto the back seat of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bicycle.\nXie Jingyuan rode the bicycle silently.\nXu Shou fell a little behind and spoke to Su Miaomiao, \u201cAren\u2019t you planning to fall in love with anyone?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWell, in love, you can only be with that person. I don\u2019t want it. I like the four of us together.\u201d\nAlthough sometimes she thought that Gu Jialing was too noisy and Xu Shou was too aggressive, when the Taoist master was busy, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou could accompany her to relieve boredom.\nXu Shou: \u201cYou don\u2019t understand human feelings at all. Since you don\u2019t understand, if a boy pursues you in the future, you just refuse him directly. You don\u2019t need to ask anything, unless you really meet a man who makes you willing to abandon us.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cThere won\u2019t be such a man.\u201d\nXu Shou was old-fashioned, \u201cDon\u2019t say it too early, many men and women who have said such words have finally slapped themselves in the face.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at Xu Shou quietly.\nXu Shou\u2019s ears got slightly warm. He hoped that the Taoist master didn\u2019t get him wrong. He had stopped wasting time reading novels long ago, but he had lived for more than two hundred years in his previous life, and had witnessed countless love-hate entanglements between men and women with his own eyes.\n\u201cDuring college, you should take care of your studies first. After graduation, you will have plenty of time to think about these things,\u201d Xie Jingyuan summed up the discussion between the two in his usual tone.\nXu Shou: \u201cThe Taoist master is right.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cGot it.\u201d\nThe place where Xu Shou was going to class was different from that of Xie Jingyuan, and they left at a turn in the road.\nThere were not so many students who had classes in the evening, and the road leading to the teaching building was relatively quiet.\nXie Jingyuan looked back and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to think about getting married so early. Even if uncle and aunt really urge you after graduation, as long as you don\u2019t meet a man who can make you leave us, you don\u2019t have to force yourself. If you are not happy after marriage, uncle and aunt will only feel distressed.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t want to think about those complicated things any more, so she gave him a perfunctory \u201cOh\u201d.\nWhen they arrived at the teaching building, Xie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao to the last row.\nXie Jingyuan who was the super student in the class, recognized as the prodigy was usually alone. There were at most two boys who would come to him. When the boy came over, almost all the classmates paid attention to him.\nXie Jingyuan was doing his own thing like no one else was around.\nSu Miaomiao also took out her textbook and honestly wrote her homework for that day.\nIn the third year of senior high school, they were used to self-studying in the evening, and they didn\u2019t need to adapt to continue self-studying.\nThere were fewer courses than in high school, and Su Miaomiao completed her homework in one class.\nThe professor knew that Su Miaomiao was not a classmate of his class, seeing that she was quiet, unlike some couples who would chat with their lovers in class, she did not interfere.\nIn the second class, Su Miaomiao packed her bag and slept on the desk next to Xie Jingyuan.\nShe first leaned toward the window, fell asleep, changed her position, and turned her face toward Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan glanced over.\nThe lights in the classroom were bright, reflecting her white skin, only her cheeks were flushed from sleep, and her slightly parted lips were also a bright peach color.\nSuddenly, a strand of hair broke from her hair tie and fell down, landing on her eyelashes.\nShe frowned. It must have been itchy.\nXie Jingyuan stretched out his hand, and carefully pinned the strand of hair behind her ear.\n\u201cXie Jingyuan, you answer,\u201d the old professor in his fifties supported the frame of the glasses with a serious face.\nXie Jingyuan had always been the darling in the eyes of teachers of various subjects all his life, and no teacher had ever called him in such a tone.\nAt that moment, Xie Jingyuan looked at the old professor on the podium. The master who led him into the Qingxu Temple appeared in his mind.\nHis master was a very strict person.\nThe boys in the front row covered their mouths with textbooks, and whispered to remind Xie Jingyuan what the problem was.\nXie Jingyuan really didn\u2019t hear it, but when he knew the question, he could answer it fluently.\nThe professor gave him a face, glanced at Su Miaomiao who was still sleeping soundly, and didn\u2019t say much.\nClass ended soon, and when the bell rang, Su Miaomiao sat upright rubbing her eyes.\nShe was about to wipe her face with a wet towel when someone handed it to her.\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan and smiled.\nBefore he could say anything, the professor called him over.\n\u201cYou wait here,\u201d Xie Jingyuan quickly said to Su Miaomiao, and then walked toward the podium.\nThe professor waited for the other students to leave before staring at Xie Jingyuan, \u201cI don\u2019t care how you fall in love after class. There are classroom disciplines in class. You have to pay attention to the impact.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and said, \u201cYes, I will pay attention in the future.\u201d\nThe professor looked at the delicate girl who was still wiping her face with a wet towel on the seat, and asked, \u201cWhich major is she from?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cAdministrative management.\u201d\nProfessor: \u201cNext time she comes to listen, you tell her to listen carefully, or don\u2019t come.\u201d\nWhen students listened carefully, it was the most basic respect for the teacher, while sleeping was blatant contempt.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao, and explained, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but she didn\u2019t do it on purpose. She practiced tennis during the day, and she just got tired after finishing her homework.\u201d\nThe professor pushed his glasses, \u201cPlay tennis?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan took out his phone, looked through the pictures album, and handed the phone to the professor, \u201cYou can swipe, these photos are all about her.\u201d\nThe professor was really good. So, he saw the picture of Su Miaomiao accepting the award on the podium of the US Open, saw the screenshot of the report of the domestic sports official media, and watched a video of the final between Su Miaomiao and the foreign veteran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She\u2019d already been on the international podium!\nSitting behind Xie Jingyuan on the bicycle, Su Miaomiao received a video call request from her parents.\nThe lights in the campus at night were not good, so Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei asked their daughter to call them when they went home.\nSu Miaomiao put down her phone, rested her head on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back, and yawned.\nAt the end of the day, she found that college life was easier than high school. After high school, she still had to play tennis with the Taoist master. Now she could complete all the training during the day.\nWhen she went back, she didn\u2019t need to review for the college entrance examination. There was nothing to do, and Su Miaomiao was sleepy too early.\n\u201cWant to sleep?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked.\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nHe just smiled.\nHuman college students went to bed early at eleven o\u2019clock. It was only nine o\u2019clock, and the cat wanted to sleep.\nHe knew from the beginning that it was impossible for Su Miaomiao to accept the dormitory life of four people. She couldn\u2019t stand sharing a room with roommates, and the roommates wouldn\u2019t stand her either.\nBack in the lakeside community, when Xie Jingyuan went to park his bicycle, he found that neither Xu Shou nor Gu Jialing had returned.\nXu Shou had three classes that night. He sent him a message in advance. Gu Jialing was probably still learning opera.\nPicking up their bags, the two went upstairs.\nWalking to door 802, Su Miaomiao took out the key from her bag and opened the door.\nIt was pitch black inside.\nSu Miaomiao was taken aback.\nIf it was at home in Anshi, her parents would already be at home at that time, even if her mom was on night shift, her dad would be there. The living room would be brightly lit, and her dad would welcome her home loudly, instead of silence.\nXie Jingyuan stood beside her, reached in, and turned on the light for her.\nWhen the lights turned on, the living room decorated by Su Mingan looked bright and warm, and there was a vase of flowers on the coffee table in the living room.\n\u201cGo in, uncle and aunt are waiting for your video call,\u201d Xie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao.\nAfter Su Miaomiao went in, Xie Jingyuan closed the door for her outside.\nIn her previous life, she lived by herself for a hundred years. Even if her cultivation level was shallow, she was still a demon, so she was not afraid to stay alone in a house.\nSu Miaomiao sat on the sofa in the living room and made a video call to her parents first.\nWhen the video was connected, Su Mingan rushed to ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s Jing Yuan?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cHe\u2019s home.\u201d\nTang Shiwei glared at her husband. When he was young, his self-control was not strong, and he wished he could rent a house to live with her, but now he always suspected Jing Yuan.\nTang Shiwei was more serious, and asked her daughter about her day\u2019s life with concern.\nThe couple were very relieved to find that their daughter was either spending time with the coach, Sister Fang, or Xie Jingyuan and the other three.\nThere was no need to worry too much about school life, and the couple began to remind their daughter how to live by herself.\n\u201cYou know how to use the washing machine. You don\u2019t have many clothes. Take them out to dry on the balcony immediately after washing.\u201d\n\u201cYour father had already printed the instructions of how to water the potted flowers out and pasted them behind the door. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d\n\u201cThe paper also has the cell phone number of the housekeeping aunt, call her when you need to clean up\u2026\u201d\nEverything was fine, the couple talked about everything one by one, until Su Miaomiao yawned three times in a row. Only then did Tang Shiwei pushed her husband away and ended the video.\nSu Miaomiao was just sleepy and didn\u2019t feel that her parents were noisy. After so many years, she was used to their nagging.\nWhen her mom and dad were not around, and she couldn\u2019t even hear their voice, Su Miaomiao looked at the empty house, feeling a little unhappy.\nShe went to take a shower first, and threw a set of daily clothes and sportswear into the washing machine.\nAfter drying her hair, she walked out in her pajamas, then Su Miaomiao thought about it and called Xie Jingyuan.\nAfter a beep, it was connected.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cMaster Taoist, come here.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWhy?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep, you can help me hang my clothes on the balcony later, oh, and then water those flowers.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThese are very simple things, you should learn to do it yourself.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao yawned into the phone, \u201cI\u2019m so sleepy, I can\u2019t keep my eyes open.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026Open the door.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hung up the phone in satisfaction, walked from the bedroom to the entrance, and opened the door. Xie Jingyuan just came out from the 801 next door, holding a notebook in his hand.\nAlthough Su Miaomiao was wearing pajamas, it was a long-sleeved skirt, which would not reveal anything.\nXie Jingyuan went to check her bedroom first, and made sure the curtains were drawn. Just as he was about to walk away, Su Miaomiao jumped onto the bed and got under the covers.\nTurning her back to him, she said lazily, \u201cTurn off the lights for me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan shook his head, turned off the lights and closed the door.\nBefore the washing machine stopped, he watered the flowers and sat in the living room to read the information on the notebook.\nTen minutes later, the washing machine stopped.\nXie Jingyuan closed his notebook and went to the bathroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After turning on the washing machine, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes and mind were completely occupied by a white bra wrapped around other clothes.\nBeing stiff for a few seconds, Xie Jingyuan left the bathroom and came to Su Miaomiao\u2019s door.\nHis hand touched the door panel, but remembering how comfortable she was in the bed, Xie Jingyuan pursed his lips and returned to the bathroom.\nSu Mingan was a good father, and he had arranged all kinds of daily necessities, including clothes hangers and buckets.\nXie Jingyuan put some clothes into the drying bucket and lifted them to the balcony.\nHe didn\u2019t turn on the balcony light, and hung up several clothes, large and small, in the dark.\nThere was nothing embarrassing about it as he just thought these were cat clothes.\nThe bucket was carried back to the bathroom, Xie Jingyuan also cleaned the inside by the way, and then left.\nCoincidentally, just as he was leaving the house, Gu Jialing turned around from the elevator hall humming a new opera tune, saw Xie Jingyuan, and then looked at the doorknob of 802 that he was holding. The phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, and he asked vigilantly, \u201cWhat were you doing with her?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan remained expressionless, \u201cShe was sleepy and wanted to sleep, so she asked me to help her clean up.\u201d\nGu Jialing put down his vigilance for a second, and turned to look at Xie Jingyuan with accusing eyes, \u201cTaoist Master, you are so biased. I ask you to help with things, you rarely care.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou are different from her.\u201d\nGu Jialing proudly said, \u201cOf course, cats are lazy, but we birds are hardworking, and we never bother others for things we can do ourselves.\u201d\nThe two went to 801. Xie Jingyuan still had to read the information, so he went directly to his room.\nGu Jialing had a lot of things to share. The Taoist master was so busy, and Xu Shou hadn\u2019t come back yet, so he had no choice but to call the old man at home.\nMr. Gu was very happy when he first answered the phone. But as he listened to his grandson chirping for half an hour, talking about trivial matters, he became impatient, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to sleep!\u201d\nThe old man hung up the phone mercilessly.\nIn fact, he knew how to use video calls, but he didn\u2019t want to see his grandson acting as if he was taking a selfie on the screen, so he just pretended he hadn\u2019t learned it!\nGu Jialing was regretting that he hadn\u2019t said that he had enough time yet, when Xu Shou came back.\n\u201cWhy did you come later than me? Are you dating someone?\u201d Gu Jialing jumped to the entrance and asked intentionally.\nXu Shou gave him a cold look, \u201cWhere\u2019s the Taoist master?\u201d\nGu Jialing pointed to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room.\nXu Shou: \u201cThen shut up and don\u2019t disturb his studies.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes widened, then he chased Xu Shou and whispered, \u201cThis is the house I rented. I am the owner. I can speak as loudly as I want. You two can move out if you don\u2019t like it. I didn\u2019t ask you to come here.\u201d\nXu Shou stopped, and raised his phone in front of him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, we can move out, and I will pay back the rent.\u201d\nGu Jialing snorted and went back to his master bedroom.\nThe next morning, Su Miaomiao got up on time at six o\u2019clock, washed her face, brushed her teeth quickly, and walked out of the house with her bag at ten past six.\nOutside the door, the three boys stood in a row, while Gu Jialing was still yawning.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou two are going out as well?\u201d\nXu Shou said lightly, \u201cI\u2019m going to study by myself.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cI\u2019ll also study by myself. I participated in club activities yesterday and didn\u2019t do my homework.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao\u2019s bag and reminded him, \u201cStudying is the main priority, and you should not let your club activities affect your studies.\u201d\nGu Jialing covered his ears and went to the elevator first.\nXie Jingyuan signaled Xu Shou to follow, looked at Su Miaomiao\u2019s bag, and asked in a low voice, \u201cClothes, textbooks, keys, water cups, tissues, are they all packed?\u201d\nWhen she was in Anshi, she never had to worry about those things, but Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t know whether she packed her bag by herself or Tang Shiwei helped to pack it.\nOf course Su Miaomiao did it by herself, those were all the things she would use that day.\nXie Jingyuan checked it again. His eyes deliberately avoided the compartment where she put her clothes.\nSu Miaomiao thought of something, and took out the spare key that was specially prepared for him from her pocket, \u201cThis is for you, you don\u2019t need me to open the door when you come here.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like any unnecessary troubles.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her and took the key.\nWhen they arrived at Beijing University, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing went to different teaching buildings, so Xie Jingyuan said to Su Miaomiao alone, \u200b\u200b\u201dDon\u2019t tell uncle or aunt about the matter of me helping you with your laundry and you giving me a spare key.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhy?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThey will worry that you won\u2019t be able to take good care of yourself.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI understand.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was silent for a while, and when they were about to arrive at the stadium, he said again, \u201cThere must be a boundary between men and women. From now on, you wash and dry your underwear yourself.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, \u201cIt\u2019s so troublesome. Taoist Master, don\u2019t treat me as a woman. You treat me as a cat, so you don\u2019t have to follow these rules.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cBut you are in human form now.\u201d\nHe refused to compromise, Su Miaomiao thought for a while, and suddenly became relaxed again, \u201cWell, I will ask Gu Jialing to help me do the laundry in the future. He has always treated me like a cat, there is no such taboo between us.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan stopped the bicycle, looked back at her and said, \u201cHe can\u2019t do it either, you both have to avoid each other when it comes to the privacy of men and women.\u201d\nHe was so strict, Su Miaomiao lowered her head as if she made a mistake.\nShe was a domineering and unreasonable cat, but she looked like the most obedient girl.\nEvery time she wanted something, as long as she blinked her eyes or acted cute, no matter Su Mingan and his wife, Grandma Tao, or even Xie Jingyuan, they would compromise.\nIt was only that time that Xie Jingyuan was unwilling to compromise.\nHe turned his head and continued to ride forward.\nSu Miaomiao lowered her head and scratched his back with her fingers to vent her dissatisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "129": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-129/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXie Jingyuan had a different feeling, thinking that she was acting like a baby in that way, and hoped that he would change his mind.\nSo he was unmoved.\nSuddenly, she stopped scratching.\nJust when Xie Jingyuan thought that she had finally accepted the need to wash and dry her underwear. Su Miaomiao happily hugged him, and poked her head forward, taking advantage of his arm, \u201cI have a way!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her with a sinking face, \u201cWhat way?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled smugly, \u201cI won\u2019t wear underwear anymore. Anyway, I don\u2019t like to wear them.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nMany of Peking University\u2019s top students were as diligent and self-disciplined as Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou, so even though it was only after six o\u2019clock in the morning, some students were on the roads all over the campus.\nThere were two female students walking while talking.\nThey were talking about the bicycle that had just passed by.\n\u201cThe man is so handsome. It turns out that romance novels are not all lies. There really is such a man.\u201d\n\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t notice, I just looked at that girl\u2019s legs, they are so fair and long!\u201d\nTheir eyes still closely followed the bicycle in front of them.\nThen, they saw the girl in the back seat poking her head forward, in an intimate pose.\nWhen something happened suddenly, the boy riding the bicycle lost control somehow, and the bicycle turned crookedly. Fortunately, the boy\u2019s long legs supported the ground in time, so no one was injured.\nSu Miaomiao also had four classes on Tuesday morning, but she was free all afternoon and could use the time for training. Sister Fang also made arrangements.\nIt was just half past twelve when she came out of the cafeteria, and there was still an hour and a half before the start of training.\nXie Jingyuan drove Su Miaomiao to her dormitory downstairs.\nAfter Su Miaomiao jumped out of the bicycle, Xie Jingyuan asked for her cell phone.\nShe watched him set the alarm at 1:40.\n\u201cDo you remember the way to the gymnasium?\u201d Xie Jingyuan still asked uneasily when the phone was returned to her.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI remember! I\u2019m better than Xu Shou when it comes to recognizing the way.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was only glad that Xu Shou left first, otherwise the two would have another debate.\n\u201cGo up,\u201d Xie Jingyuan looked toward the stairs and said.\nSu Miaomiao took her bag and ran up.\nA passing girl looked at them.\nIn Dormitory 403, Zhao Lu, Chen Ling, and Zhu Xingzhu had just returned from the cafeteria.\nSu Miaomiao opened the door with the key, and the three roommates tilted their heads to look over when they heard the movement.\nAlthough the dormitory was small, it was cleaned by the three girls, and the slanting sunlight in the afternoon fell right in front of Su Miaomiao\u2019s bed.\n\u201cMiaomiao, what are your plans for the afternoon?\u201d Zhao Lu asked curiously.\nSu Miaomiao closed the door and replied as she walked in, \u201cI have training in the afternoon at two o\u2019clock, so I decided to come to the dormitory.\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cTraining is hard, and you have to take care of your studies as well, no wonder you always sleep during class.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I sleep even if I don\u2019t work hard.\u201d\nShe could do her homework in the evening while studying with the Taoist master. Su Miaomiao put her school bag on the desk, went to the bathroom to change into the pajamas left in the dormitory, and got under the covers.\nThe three girls were considerate of her hard training, so they stopped talking.\nSu Miaomiao liked big beds, but she could still fall asleep in a small bed. She slept until the alarm clock rang, sat up and saw that there were only Zhao Lu and Zhu Xingzhu left in the dormitory, and Chen Ling went to the library.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake, you slept soundly,\u201d Zhao Lu looked at her and took off her earphones.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWell, are you watching a movie?\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cNo, I\u2019m watching my cat\u201d\nCat?\nSu Miaomiao rubbed her eyes and came to Zhao Lu\u2019s side.\nSeeing that she was interested, Zhao Lu played the audio of the video, and moved Chen Ling\u2019s chair over so that Su Miaomiao could sit and watch with her.\nSu Miaomiao leaned closer to the screen and saw a cat playing with a ball in the living room.\nThe cat looked about four or five years old, with a round head and black and brown fur. It pulled out a red plush ball, and then pounced on it, with simple movements. The cat seemed to have a lot of fun.\nZhao Lu said, \u201cThis is Tangtang. It has been raised by me for five years. I have been in university for so long, but I don\u2019t miss my parents as much as I miss Tangtang. Fortunately, my father installed a camera so I can still see her at ordinary times.\u201d\nWith that kind of surveillance video, one couldn\u2019t control the distance of the camera, and the small cat wasn\u2019t seen clearly. Zhao Lu deliberately dug out the phone\u2019s album, and showed Su Miaomiao how cute her cat was, video after video.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t find it cute at all, wasn\u2019t this just an ordinary cat?\n\u201cLook, our sofa was scratched by it!\u201d Zhao Lu said with a complaining tone and a doting expression.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be angry.\u201d\nZhao Lu smiled, \u201cI\u2019m angry, but what mistakes can kittens make? They just like to play like this, and it was not intentional.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThat cat was very lucky. If it damaged Grandma Tao\u2019s sofa, the Taoist master would definitely punish it.\nZhu Xingzhu sat diagonally opposite, and snorted when she heard the words, \u201cYou are a cat slave through and through, you are hopeless.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cCat slave?\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cDon\u2019t you know? What was that sentence saying, oh, cats are masters, and people are just servants of cats. Cat owners are also called Poop Shoveling Officers \u94f2\u5c4e\u5b98 which sounds nicer.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked bewildered.\nShe didn\u2019t have cats around her, so she didn\u2019t know those things at all.\nZhao Lu and Zhu Xingzhu gave her common knowledge together, and also brought out \u201cdog\u201d as a comparison.\n\u201cDogs are real pets. They obey their owners. Cats are the head of the family. Everyone else has to obey cats.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "130": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-130/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, people who don\u2019t own cats may not think so. Those who own cats are basically cat slaves, and they will never turn over in this life.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cBut I\u2026 I know a person who also has a cat. He is very aggressive toward the cat and has set a lot of rules for the cat.\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cThen is his cat obedient?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nZhao Lu said enviously, \u201cHis cat must be an angel. As long as I am at home, my cat would jump on me and slap my face with its paws at five o\u2019clock every day. It will bite me even if I give it cat food. It especially likes to overturn our trash can!\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu pointed at her face so that Su Miaomiao could see clearly, \u201cLook, look, she still looks happy even after the cat is like that, what is she if not a cat slave? And she is the most loyal servant, willing to serve the cat.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao asked Zhao Lu, \u201cAre you really not angry?\u201d\nZhao Lu said with a serious face, \u201cThe poop shoveling officer won\u2019t care about such trivial matters. Tangtang is special to me because it likes me. My dad begged it to sleep in their bed, but Tangtang wouldn\u2019t even go.\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cMiaomiao, that friend of yours must also be a cat slave. Telling you how powerful he is is actually bragging, and he must have worked hard for his cat in private.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao tried to recall the Taoist master\u2019s performance.\nZhao Lu: \u201cIt\u2019s actually very simple, you go to check his phone. As long as most of the pictures on his phone are of the cat, then he must be a cat slave. But he was lucky to meet a good cat, otherwise he would have been regarded as a cat slave. Otherwise if the cat was as naughty as our Tangtang, he could only bear it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Miaomiao, shouldn\u2019t you go? It\u2019s almost two o\u2019clock!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, yes, you go. If you like Tangtang, I will send you a few more videos of it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hurriedly changed her clothes and rushed to the gymnasium to meet Sister Fang.\nAt five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, after the training was over, Su Miaomiao still went to take a shower first, came out to pick up her bag to check her phone, and found that Xie Jingyuan had sent a message saying that he had arrived.\nSu Miaomiao went outside and saw Xie Jingyuan straddling the bicycle.\nHe wore a black shirt and looked colder than usual.\nThe dignified master of Qingxu Temple, the Taoist master who once beat her back to her original form with one move, would he really treat her as a master?\nSuch a question, Su Miaomiao would never dare to ask directly, fearing that Xie Jingyuan would blow her soul away in a fit of anger.\nGu Jialing would definitely laugh at her daydream. If she asked Xu Shou, he would probably beat her harder.\nHmph, she may regard him as the owner, but Xu Shou, the big black dog, really regarded the Taoist master as his master, and he couldn\u2019t be more loyal.\nThe four of them ate dinner together and went their separate ways after eating.\nSu Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan to the evening class.\nMost of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s professors were strict. He didn\u2019t want them to misunderstand Su Miaomiao again, so he took her to the next classroom, \u201cThere is no class here, so stay here. I will come to find you during class break.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked and reached out to him, \u201cLend me your phone, mine is almost out of battery.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWhat will you do with the phone?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cCut the fruit.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t worried that she would do other things, so he took out his phone and handed it to her. Before the class bell rang, he went to his classroom.\nSu Miaomiao sat in the last row, flipping through Xie Jingyuan\u2019s phone\u2019s album.\nThere were not many pictures, they were all professors\u2019 ppts or professional book materials, anyway, they were not pictures of people, and Su Miaomiao was not interested in looking at them.\nShe had seen all the pictures. Except for a few pictures of the two of them or the four of them with Grandma Tao, Su Miaomiao did not see a single picture of herself.\nBefore exiting the album, Su Miaomiao found a folder with a lock symbol, and clicked to enter the password.\nShe pressed it a few times casually, but it was wrong.\u00a0\nSo she sent a message to Zhao Lu on her phone: Apart from pictures, are there other ways to determine whether a person is a cat slave or not?\nIf the Taoist master really treated her like he was a cat slave, Su Miaomiao would no longer have to be afraid of him!\nZhao Lu: Have you checked his phone?\nSu Miaomiao: Yes, no, a file is locked and cannot be opened.\nZhao Lu: Don\u2019t open it, most of the encrypted pictures files of boys are not suitable for children.\nSu Miaomiao: Not suitable for children?\nZhao Lu: Why are you so simple? Xie Jingyuan is really as good as his appearance, abstinent!\nSu Miaomiao thought to herself. The Taoist master didn\u2019t stop with abstinence, he also obeyed the monk precepts!\nZhao Lu speculated: Is your friend who has a cat Xu Shou?\nSince Su Miaomiao could look at the other party\u2019s phone so quickly, the other party must also be a college student in Beijing; a boy who had a cat but did not act like a cat slave at all. The sunny and handsome Gu Jialing was the first to be ruled out, and the remaining two were Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou. Both had the kind of temperament, but Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao were sticky, and they probably didn\u2019t have time to raise a cat. So the friend Su Miaomiao talked about must be Xu Shou.\nSu Miaomiao acquiesced, so that Zhao Lu would never guess that she was the cat raised by Xie Jingyuan.\nThe Taoist master had already said that the true identities of the four of them couldn\u2019t be revealed.\nZhao Lu: Is his cat around?\nSu Miaomiao: Yes, he also lives in a rented house next to mine.\nZhao Lu: That\u2019s easy. You go and observe. Let me give you a few examples. If the cat knocks over his cup, or if the cat insists on lying on his keyboard when he is playing on the computer, or if the cat scratches him carefully, and he doesn\u2019t get angry, then he must be a cat slave. But he wants to keep the cool guy persona, hide it deeply, and don\u2019t want you to see his cat slave side.\nSu Miaomiao: I see, thank you.\nZhao Lu sent a smiley emoji.\nSu Miaomiao did her homework first, and then searched for \u201chow to tell if a person was a cat slave\u201d by herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Taoist master did not.\nCat emoticons for chatting? The Taoist master never used emoticons, but Gu Jialing did use the bird ones.\nDidn\u2019t feel bad about money when buying things for the cat?\nSu Miaomiao curled her lips. The Taoist master was very stingy, she could only ask for gifts twice a year.\nAlways got cat hair on him?\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nShe herself had no cat hair, how could she leave some on the Taoist master?\nThe Taoist master met none of those criteria, which made Su Miaomiao hopeless.\nHowever, she hadn\u2019t given up yet. After all, she really wanted him to be a cat slave. As long as the Taoist master treated her as the master, then Gu Jialing, Xu Shou and even other Taoist masters from Qingxu Temple had to serve her well!\nWhen the four of them went back to the lakeside community together that night, Su Miaomiao had to go to 801 first.\nBut she still wanted to go to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room, so he asked doubtfully, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had already thought of an excuse, and patted her bag, \u201cI haven\u2019t finished my homework yet, so I\u2019ll do it by your side.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan thought for a while, let her in, and kept the door of the room open.\nHis desk was big enough for two people to use together.\nSu Miaomiao pretended to be doing her homework, and her eyes wandered around. There was indeed a white mug next to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s notebook.\nSu Miaomiao hesitated. It was a pity that the ceramic cup broke, but those cats were too ignorant.\nIt was absolutely impossible for Su Miaomiao to do such childish behavior. She was not an ordinary cat, she was the ancestor of a centenarian cat! (century old cat)\nShould she scratch the Taoist master?\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t have the courage.\nThen only laying on the Taoist master\u2019s notebook was left.\nWith her current body shape, it was too difficult to lie on the keyboard, so Su Miaomiao lay down on the table and stretched out a hand to gently cover Xie Jingyuan\u2019s keyboard.\nXie Jingyuan looked over.\nSu Miaomiao did not speak, but looked at him silently, her eyes were beautiful against the light, but seemed to hide some deep meaning.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nShe had seen the video of Zhao Lu\u2019s Tangtang laying on the keyboard, and she could understand what the cat wanted to say. Tangtang wanted Zhao Lu to play with it.\nSu Miaomiao followed Tangtang\u2019s example and said aggrievedly, \u201cStop looking at the computer all the time, play with me for a while.\u201d\nThe more she whispered, the more obvious her grievance was, and the more a person couldn\u2019t bear to refuse.\nXie Jingyuan could only ask, \u201cWhat do you want to play?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cWe can play anything?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at his watch and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a little late to play tennis.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen we won\u2019t play tennis, let\u2019s watch a movie, the clownfish one.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan opened \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s mind was not on the movie, but on spying on Xie Jingyuan frequently.\nAfter peeping for the first time, Xie Jingyuan paused the playback, frowned and asked, \u201cIs there something wrong with you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled, and asked in a low voice, \u201cWasn\u2019t the Taoist master blaming me for delaying his studies?\u201d\nHer smile seemed to have penetrated some secret, but Xie Jingyuan remained indifferent, \u201cSince you have this self-awareness, then you can go back.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao immediately covered his keyboard, \u201cI won\u2019t leave, I want you to watch the movie with me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said helplessly, \u201cThen continue watching.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao already had the answer. She chuckled, and before she left, she patted Xie Jingyuan\u2019s head lightly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTaoist Master, did you secretly give Su Miaomiao a gift?\u201d\nAs soon as Su Miaomiao left 801, Gu Jialing jumped up from the sofa in the living room, ran all the way to the door of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room, and looked at him suspiciously.\nXie Jingyuan was still recalling Su Miaomiao\u2019s strange behavior.\nIt was okay to peep at him frequently, maybe she was thinking about something, but to tap him on the head?\n\u201cNo!\u201d Looking at Gu Jialing, Xie Jingyuan turned to the laptop screen.\nHe didn\u2019t believe it, \u201cYou didn\u2019t give a gift, why was she smiling like she stole meat?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s face changed slightly.\nThe literal meaning meat was to steal meat, but the extended meaning was making love.\nThere was no meat in his room, so what was Gu Jialing suspecting?\nXie Jingyuan looked over coldly.\nGu Jialing: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t give her, then you didn\u2019t, as for\u2026\u201d\nHe quickly closed the door of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room to block the icy gaze.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t bother the Taoist master,\u201d Xu Shou heard the movement, came out from the opposite bedroom, and warned Gu Jialing in a low voice.\nOnly he, who had chosen a double major, knew how busy the Taoist master was, but the cat and bird were always causing trouble for the Taoist master.\nGu Jialing glared at him, \u201cWhoever disturbs the Taoist master?! You know how to hate me all day long. Just now Su Miaomiao went to the Taoist master to watch Nemo together, why don\u2019t you go and discipline her?\u201d\nXu Shou remained silent. As he expected, the cat was the most worrying one.\nGu Jialing pulled Xu Shou back to the room, closed the door, and analyzed the abnormality when Su Miaomiao left.\n\u201cReally, she smiled so happily, it\u2019s almost like receiving a jewelry gift!\u201d\nXu Shou didn\u2019t bother to guess, anyway, the Taoist master had his own reasons for doing things. Others were just playing tricks, and he couldn\u2019t bear to disturb him.\nIn her house, Su Miaomiao took a shower in a happy mood, put all the dirty clothes into the washing machine, and set it to the \u201cquick wash\u201d mode.\nThe washing machine started to spin, and the bathroom door was closed, so there was no loud noise.\nThe previous night, Su Miaomiao fell asleep early because she had nothing to do. She leaned on the sofa with her notebook in her arms, searching for some interactive videos between cat slave and cat owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "132": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-132/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her previous life, Su Miaomiao had always been a wild cat and had never been adopted by anyone, so she didn\u2019t know that humans who raised cats would treat cats as their masters.\nIn fact, if she thought about it carefully, the cat slave would clean up the dirty paws of ordinary cats, and the Taoist master also took care of her in that way.\nLooking at those cat videos again, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t think cats were ugly. She specialized in researching cat owners\u2019 tolerance toward cats, and how well other cat owners were willing to treat cats.\nDuring that process, Su Miaomiao also discovered that sometimes when cat slaves were really frustrated, as long as the cats walked over and cuddled against them, or jumped on their laps or even just lay down next to them, the cat slaves would show their happy emotions.\nIt could be seen that the cats were very smart, and they knew that they should give some reward to the cat slaves from time to time. Otherwise the cat slaves may become disheartened and never support the cat owner again.\nJust like the little Taoist masters of Qingxu Temple, if Xie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t provide them with benefits, why would the little Taoist masters still listen to him?\nThere were some truths that people and cats communicate with each other.\nSu Miaomiao\u2014While watching with relish, she drew his inferences in her heart.\nWhen the washing machine stopped spinning, Su Miaomiao looked at the bathroom, picked up her phone and sent a message to Xie Jingyuan: Taoist master, come and help me dry my clothes.\nXie Jingyuan: Okay.\nSu Miaomiao showed a satisfied smile in response to the reply. Although the Taoist master was sometimes very serious, he was generally very competent in supporting her.\nAfter scrolling through another video, Su Miaomiao heard the sound of unlocking the door.\nXie Jingyuan thought she had already gotten into bed like the day before, so he pushed open the door and saw her sitting cross-legged on the sofa. He was stunned for a second.\nSu Miaomiao smiled at him.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s description was correct, it really was a sneaky smile.\nHe closed the door and asked lightly, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you slept yet?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI\u2019m watching a video, I\u2019m not sleepy yet.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was very surprised. She used to have no interest in human novels, film and television dramas, including other cultures and arts, unless it was related to cats.\nXie Jingyuan walked to the sofa and sat down.\nThe notebook was held in Su Miaomiao\u2019s arms. Xie Jingyuan went to look at the screen, and smelled the shower gel all over her body, the clear and sweet peach fragrance.\nSome childhood memories crept up.\nIn the supermarket, she sniffed every scent of shower gel, and finally picked up the peach scent, and said to him with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s for you, the peach scent is indeed the best.\u201d\nBut Xie Jingyuan only liked to eat peaches, and he always used the basic ones for his toiletries.\nAfter thinking about it, he saw the scene on the laptop screen; a tabby cat was cutely licking its owner\u2019s finger.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe quickly left the sofa. Seeing that Su Miaomiao was still watching seriously, he frowned and asked, \u201cWhy are you suddenly seeing this? Didn\u2019t you say those cats are ugly?\u201d\nIn her eyes, all other cats were ugly cats except her.\nSu Miaomiao looked at the female cat slave in the video, and then looked at Qingxu Temple\u2019s owner on the opposite side, and replied seriously, \u201cYou really treat me well. I also want to learn how to make the Taoist master happy.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWho asked her to make him happy?\nWhat methods did she think would make him happy? Lick his fingers like a cat?\nXie Jingyuan went straight to the bathroom, and a minute later, he crossed the living room with a clothes drying bucket expressionlessly, and went to the balcony.\nSu Miaomiao thought he didn\u2019t know there was a light on the balcony, so she jumped over with her notebook in her arms and pressed the switch.\nThe light was bright, clearly illuminating the girl\u2019s underwear in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s hand, and two peaches printed on the white material.\nXie Jingyuan remained expressionless.\nSu Miaomiao also returned to the sofa.\nAll the clothes were dried, Xie Jingyuan ignored Su Miaomiao who was addicted to the video, and placed the bucket back into the bathroom.\nThere was some water on the ground, Xie Jingyuan was mopping the floor while trying to find the reasons why she was acting strange that night.\nSuddenly, the cat with a peach smell came over from one side, and gently rubbed the top of her head against his arm.\nXie Jingyuan froze.\nSu Miaomiao felt that the posture was not easy to exert strength, so she hugged his waist and continued to brush against him while looking at the two in the mirror.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cDo you want another gift?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled, \u201cNo.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThen why are you hugging me?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI like you. I\u2019ll hug you if I like you, don\u2019t you like it?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was also looking at the mirror. In the mirror, was her innocent smiling face, those clear eyes, free from any worldly desires.\nLove was also a kind of desire.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t hug me like this in the future,\u201d Xie Jingyuan pulled her hand away, turned the direction indifferently, and turned the mop head toward Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao retreated to the door, frowned and asked him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like it? I think other people like cats brushing against them.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t raise his head, \u201cCats can, but humans can\u2019t. Adult men and women can only do this when they are in love or get married.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at her own hand, which was white and smooth without cat hair or pink paw pads, and pouted unhappily.\n\u201cThen what to do in the future? You treat me well, I can\u2019t make you happy.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan finally looked over again, \u201cWho told you to make me happy? I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao watched him mopping the floor, and muttered in a low voice, \u201cIf I can\u2019t make you happy, what will I do if you don\u2019t raise me anymore?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou are not a cat now, so you don\u2019t need to be raised.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes were persistent, and she felt a little wronged, \u201cI am a cat, a cat of Qingxugu Temple. You brought me back, so you have to raise me.\u201d\nIf the Taoist master really dared to abandon her, just like a human who abandoned an ordinary cat, Su Miaomiao would knock over his computer, water glass, and scratch the sofa and cabinet!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Xu Shou was just as determined to be loyal to him.\nAvoiding Su Miaomiao\u2019s gaze, he promised in a low voice, \u201cOkay, unless you want to leave by yourself, I will always\u2026 take care of you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was satisfied.\nWhen she turned around, Xie Jingyuan said helplessly, \u201cStop watching that video, I don\u2019t need you to learn to make me happy.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had already seen it.\nThe Taoist master was not an ordinary human being, so how could he be easily coaxed by those simple methods?\nTurning off the notebook, Su Miaomiao got under the covers and contacted Zhao Lu: Xu Shou doesn\u2019t like being coaxed by his cat, and he doesn\u2019t like it when the cat gets close. How can the cat make him happy?\nZhao Lu: No, if he doesn\u2019t like these things, why did he keep the cat?\nSu Miaomiao was still thinking about the question, when Zhao Lu sent another message: Do you have a picture of the cat? Is that cat too ugly? Xu Shou only raised the cat because of his kindness, so that could explain why there are no pictures in his phone.\nSu Miaomiao immediately replied: It\u2019s not ugly, it\u2019s the most beautiful cat in the world.\nZhao Lu: You post a picture! Let me see!\nSu Miaomiao: I don\u2019t have any pictures, but she is very beautiful anyway, white, with eyes as blue as the sea and sky\u2026\nSu Miaomiao, who didn\u2019t like to write essays, wrote a short essay to show her beauty vividly.\nThat was Zhao Lu, if it was another person, she may not be willing to waste the time reading a description of a cat\u2019s appearance.\nZhao Lu: If there is such a beautiful cat, then this cat does not need to do anything special. As long as one could see it, people would feel super happy.\nSu Miaomiao suddenly realized something!\nShe said good night to Zhao Lu, and then sent a message to Xie Jingyuan: Taoist Master, do you think I\u2019m pretty?\nXie Jingyuan was still in apartment 802. The bathroom was mopped, and he came out to mop the living room.\nPutting the phone in his pocket, when he heard the beep, Xie Jingyuan took it out, and saw a message that made him stiff again.\nHe walked to the door of the master bedroom, the door was open, so he looked at Su Miaomiao who was leaning on the bedside, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, sleep now.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stared at him and asked, \u201cThen tell me, am I the most beautiful cat in the world?\u201d\nThe corners of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s lips raised slightly, it turned out that she was only asking about herself as a cat.\nAlthough he hadn\u2019t seen all the cats, he knew how to answer.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled, that kind of proud smile, \u201cDo you get super happy every time you see me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and nodded again.\nSu Miaomiao said to herself, \u201cNo wonder you wanted to take me back to Qingxu Temple, so you liked me back then.\u201d\nBefore she finished speaking, the lights went dark.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s cold and indifferent voice came from the door, \u201cGo to sleep, we have to play tennis tomorrow morning.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao obediently put down her phone and lay down on the pillow.\nHe gently closed the door, mopped all the floors, and left silently.\nThe next day, Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan went directly to the gymnasium to play, and only went to the cafeteria after the game.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing had to have breakfast before going to the teaching building for self-study.\n\u201cHey, Xu Shou!\u201d\nWhen the two of them were about to finish eating, they heard a girl calling Xu Shou. They all looked up and saw Su Miaomiao\u2019s three roommates.\nZhao Lu walked the fastest, and placed her meal on the table next to them. She turned her head and chatted enthusiastically with Xu Shou, \u201cI heard from Miaomiao that you have a cat, which is very beautiful, can you show me her picture?\u201d\nZhao Lu felt that Su Miaomiao was actually a little cold. That kind of natural coldness that was very polite but difficult for outsiders to integrate into her world.\nTherefore, a cat that Su Miaomiao could find beautiful must be really great.\nXu Shou frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t have a cat.\u201d\nGu Jialing added for him, \u201cHe hates cats the most, how could he raise one?\u201d\nIf Su Miaomiao hadn\u2019t been brought back to Qingxu Temple by the Taoist master, Xu Shou would have driven her away long ago.\nZhao Lu didn\u2019t believe it, so she dug out the description of Su Miaomiao and showed it to Xu Shou.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing saw it together, and their expressions were exactly the same, speechless.\nShe was too narcissistic! Who was the most beautiful cat in the world? She was obviously the most stinky cat in the world!\nSu Miaomiao had only been in class for three days, and the university was about to have the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.\nAfter discussion, the group of four decided to go home for the Mid-Autumn Festival and not go back for the National Day holiday that started at the end of the month.\nAt nine o\u2019clock in the morning on the first day of the holiday, the four of them took a taxi to the train station.\nIn the past, Mr. Gu arranged a driver and life assistant for Gu Jialing, but after Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou moved in to live with him, the old man confidently called back the assistant who was not of much use and arranged him for other jobs. So Gu Jialing had to take the train back to Anshi, and the driver would wait for him and Xu Shou at the Anshi Railway Station.\nFor a short vacation, except for Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou who brought their bags, Gu Jialing and Su Miaomiao were empty-handed.\nThere were a lot of people at the station, and when queuing up, Gu Jialing complained, \u201cI will get my driver\u2019s license in the summer vacation next year, and then I will buy a sports car.\u201d\nPassengers around looked at the college student who was going to buy a sports car.\nXu Shou: \u201cAre you rich?

Xie Jingyuan pulled Su Miaomiao in front of him, Xu Shou consciously walked to her left, Gu Jialing saw it, and stood on her right.\n\u00a0In such a way, unless Su Miaomiao squeezed forward by herself, no one in the other three directions could squeeze her.\nThe tickets of the four people were next to each other, occupying the four seats on the right side of the corridor, facing each other in pairs.\nXie Jingyuan asked Su Miaomiao to sit on the inner seat, and he sat next to her.\nXu Shou took out snacks and put their bags on the luggage rack above their heads. When he found that other passengers needed help, he walked over.\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be called Xu Shou, he should be called Xu Leifeng,\u201d Gu Jialing joked in Xu Shou\u2019s direction.\n(Lei Feng/Chinese Red Youth Revolutionary Culture Education Reader)\nOnly Su Miaomiao responded to his joke, Xie Jingyuan was reading a book.\nA few minutes later, the train set off.\nGu Jialing noticed that there was a couple on the side of the six-person seat next to the corridor, and they looked like college students who were going home for the holidays.\nThe girl was quite pretty, with ordinary black long hair and red lips.\nThe boy seemed to like her very much, and would kiss her face from time to time, or put his arms around her waist. The girl also liked to lean in his arms.\nMaybe Gu Jialing had been peeping for too long, that the boy glanced over unkindly.\nGu Jialing withdrew his gaze, leaned into Xu Shou\u2019s ear who was also reading a book, and whispered, \u201cWhy do human couples like to kiss? It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\nBird couples didn\u2019t kiss, they liked to rub their heads and feathers.\nXu Shou gave Gu Jialing a cold look, turned around with the book in his hand, and sat with his back to him.\nGu Jialing turned to discuss with Su Miaomiao who was eating ice cream opposite.\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to poke her head to see how they kiss, Xie Jingyuan grabbed the top of her head with one hand.\nGu Jialing winked at her, \u201cYou are stupid, people don\u2019t like others watching them doing that.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood. As for Gu Jialing\u2019s question, she was a cat who had seen the world, so she explained casually, \u201cYou only kiss if you like the person, like cats sometimes lick people they like.\u201d\nGu Jialing immediately looked at her and Xie Jingyuan suspiciously, \u201cDid you lick the Taoist master?\u201d\nThe way Xie Jingyuan looked at him could no longer be described simply as \u201ccold\u201d.\nXu Shou stared at Su Miaomiao carefully.\nThe sound of a cat and a bird was not loud, other people couldn\u2019t hear it, but he and the Taoist master could hear it.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head. She had rubbed her head against the Taoist master, but she hadn\u2019t thought about licking him. But even if she wanted to, the Taoist master would not like it. He was not even letting her hug him, so he would definitely not agree.\nGu Jialing said clearly, \u201cYou don\u2019t like the Taoist master.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao still wanted to speak, but Xie Jingyuan looked at the person pushing the cart along the corridor ahead, and asked her, \u201cDo you want to buy some snacks?\u201d\nShe was attracted by the snacks right away.\nAfter eating a pack of snacks, Su Miaomiao, who had nothing to do, leaned on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder and closed her eyes to sleep.\nThe only cat who was willing to chat with him was asleep. Gu Jialing looked around and took out his earphones to listen to music. He noticed that the girl next to them was also leaning on her boyfriend\u2019s shoulder, in the same posture as the Taoist master and Su Miaomiao.\nHe secretly took a picture of the young couple, and then a picture of the Taoist master and the cat.\nThen, he held the screen in front of Xu Shou, and giggled, \u201cDon\u2019t they look alike?\u201d\nXu Shou didn\u2019t feel like it at all. The boy next to him took care of his girlfriend, and his face showed a happy and sweet look. The Taoist master could only endure the humiliation for Su Miaomiao.\n\u201cDelete it, and you are not allowed to secretly take pictures of others without permission,\u201d Xu Shou said seriously.\nGu Jialing smiled, deleted the couple\u2019s picture, but kept the other.\nAfter an hour and a half, the train arrived at Anshi Station.\nTang Shiwei didn\u2019t need to go to the hospital so she went to pick up the children with Su Mingan.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou came over to greet them and followed the driver.\nTang Shiwei missed her daughter so much, she walked out with her arms around her.\nXie Jingyuan and Su Mingan walked behind. Compared to the intimacy of the mother and daughter in front, there was nothing to say between the two men.\nWhen they arrived at the parking lot, Xie Jingyuan consciously took the passenger seat.\nIn fact, he was a little worried that Su Miaomiao would cause unnecessary misunderstandings among the elders by telling them that he helped dry her clothes. Fortunately, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t say anything.\nIn Pearl Garden, Grandma Tao couldn\u2019t sit still, she came out to have a look once in a while.\n\u201cGrandmother!\u201d\nJust as the elevator door opened, Su Miaomiao saw her, ran out happily, and hugged Grandma Tao.\nGrandma Tao burst into laughter. Looking at her grandson who was only smiling at her, she thought it was better to have a girl.\nAt noon that day, both families were celebrating the festival with Grandma Tao.\nSu Mingan was busy in the kitchen alone, while Tang Shiwei and Grandma Tao sat in the living room with the children.\nWhatever the elders asked, Su Miaomiao would answer.\nGrandma Tao reassured, \u201cFortunately the four of you are still together, otherwise I would really worry about Miaomiao.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She graduated in June that year and found a job smoothly.\nBefore the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, Tang Yan was working overtime crazily. After getting off work, she didn\u2019t have the strength to find her little cousin, so she agreed to wait for Su Miaomiao to return to university on the night that everyone had dinner together.\nBecause Gu Jialing wanted to buy autumn clothes, the four of them went to the shopping mall building where the restaurant was located an hour earlier.\nPassing by a women\u2019s clothing store, Su Miaomiao was attracted by it.\nXie Jingyuan asked Xu Shou and Gu Jialing to buy men\u2019s clothes, and he followed Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao took a fancy to a white silk dress, which was knee-length and had hollowed-out sleeves.\nShe liked it so much that she touched it a few times.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s already autumn, won\u2019t you feel cold in it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the cold.\u201d\nThe female clerk smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit cold in the morning and evening, so it\u2019s just right to wear at noon. If you like it, go and try it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao happily followed the saleswoman to the fitting room.\nXie Jingyuan noticed that there were still some long trench coats in the store, so he picked out a white one and reserved it for her.\nWith their physique, it was not easy to catch a cold, but if she wore too thin clothes, she could catch a cold.\nSu Miaomiao changed her clothes and walked out.\nThe female store manager surrounded her with various compliments.\nXie Jingyuan took a look and then looked away.\nIn the end, Su Miaomiao bought both clothes, and Xie Jingyuan helped her carry the bags.\nTen minutes before the appointed time, the group of four met and went to the hot pot restaurant together.\nTang Yan and her boyfriend Zhou Hang had arrived.\nZhou Hang was Tang Yan\u2019s alumnus, a class higher than her, and the two had been dating for three years. He was the one who Su Miaomiao heard when he called Tang Yan at the airport.\nAlthough Zhou Hang often heard his girlfriend praise how handsome the three boys next to her little cousin were, seeing it with his own eyes, he still felt a mountain of pressure. When the pressure was so great when the four of them came in, he was still on the chair.\nTang Yan pulled him up and introduced him to Su Miaomiao, \u201cThis is my boyfriend, he can\u2019t be compared with yours, but take a look.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao regarded her cousin as one of her own, and so seeing Zhou Hang, she took a closer look.\n\u201cHe is not bad, he\u2019s considered handsome among humans,\u201d Gu Jialing whispered behind her.\nSu Miaomiao nodded approvingly. Although he couldn\u2019t compare with the Taoist master, he was still pleasing to the eye.\nXie Jingyuan stretched out his hand politely, \u201cHello.\u201d\nTang Yan laughed at him, \u201cIt\u2019s not meeting the elders, why are you so polite? Come and sit down.\u201d\nZhou Hang quickly shook hands with Xie Jingyuan. He was already planning to propose to Tang Yan, and of course he had to establish a good relationship with Xie Jingyuan, his prospective brother-in-law.\nAt a table for six, Su Miaomiao\u2019s cousin was on the left, and Xie Jingyuan was on the right.\nThe hot pot ingredients were all outside, boys had to get them.\nSeeing that Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t ask Su Miaomiao what ingredients she wanted, and she was still talking to Tang Yan, Zhou Hang asked, \u201cWhat sauce does Miaomiao like, I\u2019ll bring it for her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him, \u201cI will help her get it.\u201d\nTang Yan stared at Zhou Hang in distaste, \u201cShe has such a good boyfriend.\u201d\nZhou Hang felt wronged! Xie Jingyuan was cold and indifferent, he thought the kid didn\u2019t care about her enough!\nWhen everyone went to the ingredient table, Zhou Hang observed Xie Jingyuan carefully, and saw him skillfully preparing two sauces, and returned to the box first.\nThe most important thing was that Su Miaomiao was very satisfied with Xie Jingyuan\u2019s method.\nAfter eating, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s method opened Zhou Hang\u2019s eyes even more. Every time Su Miaomiao\u2019s plate\u2019s meat was almost empty, he would always add a new one for her in time. Whatever Su Miaomiao wanted to eat, there was no need for her to say or reach out, as Xie Jingyuan had covered everything for her. Even when Su Miaomiao glanced at Xie Jingyuan, he knew that she wanted to drink water, so he silently handed over the cup.\n\u201cYou see, this is the charm of childhood sweethearts,\u201d Tang Yan whispered to her boyfriend.\nZhou Hang nodded blankly. With Xie Jingyuan around, would the elders of his girlfriend\u2019s family still notice his good sides?\nThat hot pot meal was delicious.\nTang Yan liked her little cousin so much.\nIn the eyes of her classmates, Su Miaomiao may be a bit cold, but in Tang Yan\u2019s eyes, her cousin had always been obedient and soft. She especially liked to sleep when she was a child. When adults talked, Su Miaomiao could fall asleep on the sofa. Her face was so soft, Tang Yan couldn\u2019t help but want to poke it. At that time, she was criticized by the elders and ran back to the house aggrieved. When the little cousin saw her crying, she would come over and hug her, rubbing her head against her shoulder like a cat.\nTang Yan especially liked it. She could feel her cousin\u2019s care that couldn\u2019t be expressed in words from that kind of action.\n\u201cXie Jingyuan, Miaomiao is the most innocent in our family, you are not allowed to bully her.\u201d\nBefore parting, Tang Yan took a sip of beer, hugged Su Miaomiao, who was already taller than her, and glared at Xie Jingyuan, threatening, \u201cIf you dare to make Miaomiao sad, I will even ride over a bicycle to beat you!\u201d\nGu Jialing spat out, \u201cCan you beat our Taoist master?\u201d\nTang Yan and Tang Shiwei were both petite. When they first met, Gu Jialing thought of the fluffy little sparrow in the forest.\nTang Yan glared at him, \u201cDo you want to try?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He lived in peace and didn\u2019t like fighting.\nTang Yan nodded to Xu Shou and Gu Jialing again, \u201cYou two, you can\u2019t help Xie Jingyuan, or I will beat you up too.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded.\nEven if the Taoist master fought with Su Miaomiao, he would not sit idly by. Su Miaomiao could be criticized by the Taoist master, but it was too much to bully her.\nXie Jingyuan just promised, \u201cI will take good care of her.\u201d\nAfter the hot pot was finished, it was almost nine o\u2019clock, and Gu Jialing\u2019s proposal to sing was rejected, and everyone dispersed.\nSitting in the taxi, Gu Jialing suddenly sighed with emotion, \u201cWhy does Miaomiao have everyone? Parents, grandparents, maternal grandparents, paternal grandparents, cousins and everything, but the three of us are pitiful.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cI don\u2019t feel pitiful.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan never got involved in such meaningless topics.\nGu Jialing said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cWhat do you think of Zhou Hang, is he qualified to be your cousin-in-law?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cHe\u2019s okay, but he\u2019s just my cousin\u2019s boyfriend. My cousin said that one can fall in love many times, and they don\u2019t have to marry him.\u201d\nGu Jialing clicked his tongue, \u201cHuman beings are too carefree. If I like someone, then I will only recognize that one person in my life.\u201d\nIt was rare for Xu Shou to agree with Gu Jialing\u2019s words.\nSu Miaomiao felt that her cousin was right, \u201cEveryone is subject to change. If Zhou Hang treats my cousin badly in the future, or if he becomes ugly, or the food he cooks becomes more unpalatable, of course my cousin will find a new one.\u201d\u00a0\nUncle driver: \u201cHey beauty, you are looking for a boyfriend, or are you looking for a male nanny? How many men can cook nowadays?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cMy dad can do it, and so can the Taoist master.\u201d\nThe uncle driver already knew from the conversation of the four students that the \u201cTaoist master\u201d was the nickname of the boy next to the beautiful woman. Looking at Xie Jingyuan through the rearview mirror, the uncle driver smiled and said, \u201cThen you have to hold on to him, otherwise it will be difficult to find one in the future.\u201d\nXu Shou frowned, \u201cYou concentrate on driving and don\u2019t talk.\u201d\nThe uncle driver glanced at Xu Shou\u2019s muscles and shut his mouth obediently.\nSu Miaomiao lazily leaned on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s body. Thinking about what the driver said for a while, she took Xie Jingyuan\u2019s left arm and put it in her arms, hugging him tightly.\nGu Jialing was sitting on the right side of Xie Jingyuan, not paying attention to her small movements. Xu Shou caught a glimpse when he turned his head, and his heart sank.\nThis greedy lazy cat, would she really rely on the Taoist master to cook for her for the rest of her life?\nWhen they reached the lakeside community, it was almost ten o\u2019clock.\nThere was a traffic jam on the road, Su Miaomiao fell asleep, and she didn\u2019t want to move when she got out of the car, so Xie Jingyuan insisted on carrying it.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing were not surprised by it, and each carried the autumn clothes that everyone bought.\nOn the eighth floor, Xie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao\u2019s share and wanted to accompany her to 802.\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t even know that he went to 802 many times to dry the clothes, but when it happened right in front of his eyes, he remembered Su Mingan\u2019s request, so he wanted to follow.\nXie Jingyuan turned around with Su Miaomiao on his back, and asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nGu Jialing said, \u201cThe cat\u2019s dad told me not to let a boy come here alone, even if it\u2019s you and Xu Shou, I need to keep an eye on you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was not surprised.\nXu Shou\u2019s face darkened. Was he that kind of person? What worries did the cat\u2019s dad have about him? If he was the only one it was fine, but he suspected the Taoist master?\nXu Shou was very angry.\nXie Jingyuan only said to Gu Jialing,\u201dIt\u2019s just in time, let\u2019s clean up her place.\u201d\nUpon hearing that, Gu Jialing slipped to 801.\nXu Shou took the initiative and said, \u201cI\u2019ll clean it for her.\u201d Otherwise, the Taoist master would do it.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cNo, you go to clean up our side, and on the way, ask Gu Jialing if he has finished his homework.\u201d\nXu Shou also entered 801.\nAs for the Taoist master being alone with Su Miaomiao, Xu Shou was not worried at all.\nXie Jingyuan closed the door, put the bag of clothes in his hand on the dining table, and then carried Su Miaomiao into the bathroom, \u201cBrush your teeth and take a shower, and then go to bed after.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao finally opened her eyes, looked around, and became a little more awake.\nXie Jingyuan took out the rag and mop, and really started to clean her room. That kind of three-bedroom apartment only needed the most basic mopping and dust removal, and it could be cleaned quickly.\n\u201cTaoist Master, help me dry my hair.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was really sleepy, she didn\u2019t even want to blow dry her hair.\nXie Jingyuan raised his head and saw her leaning against the bathroom door as if she had no bones, her hair was wet and messy, and she was holding a hair dryer in her hand.\nXie Jingyuan had no choice but to go to help her first.\nWith him there, Su Miaomiao no longer leaned on the door, she threw herself into his arms, wrapping them around his waist.\nXie Jingyuan took a step back and pressed against the door panel.\nAfter making sure that she would not move around again, Xie Jingyuan grabbed her hair with one hand and adjusted the direction of the hair dryer with the other.\nThe thin, soft, black and satin-like hair gradually dried amidst the buzzing sound.\nHe supported her with one hand, put the hair dryer on the washstand, and picked up her comb.\nWith such messy hair, no matter how careful he was, he would inevitably pull it a few times. Su Miaomiao felt pain, so she hummed to express her dissatisfaction.\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\nEverything went smoothly, then Xie Jingyuan held her shoulders, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao rushed back with her eyes closed, \u201cYou carry me.\u201d\nHe had no choice but to carry her back to the bed. When he put her down, his right hand was pressed by her head. Xie Jingyuan was afraid that he would pull her hair again, so he pulled his hand out little by little.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Unlike hers, his Adam\u2019s apple was very obvious, and it moved like a small ball.\nSu Miaomiao suddenly raised her neck, smiled and bit it, not allowing it to move again.\nXie Jingyuan froze.\nSeeing that the \u201csmall ball\u201d was sliding faster, Su Miaomiao wanted to catch it again, but Xie Jingyuan suddenly withdrew his hand, and took two steps back.\nSu Miaomiao saw his eyes, which were dark and seemed to be brewing with anger.\nShe also remembered that he had said that she was not allowed to hug him, kiss him, and do things like giving or receiving a kiss to him.\nNot wanting to listen to his scolding, Su Miaomiao pulled up the quilt and buried herself completely in it.\nXie Jingyuan stared at the person, and finally said nothing, pulled the quilt off her face, turned and left.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like to bury her head in sleep either, her breathing recovered and she fell asleep comfortably.\nThat night, Su Miaomiao dreamed that she had returned to Qingxiu Temple and could become a cat again.\nShe wandered around her territory, and followed the familiar autumn dew breath to the Taoist master\u2019s room.\nThe Taoist master was meditating and closed his eyes that always looked at people coldly.\nSu Miaomiao circled around the room. There was nothing interesting, and then circled around the Taoist master, her eyes fell on his \u201csmall ball\u201d. (Adam\u2019s apple)\nSu Miaomiao tentatively placed a front paw on his knee.\n\u201cGet out,\u201d the cold Taoist master opened his mouth coldly, making Su Miaomiao run away in a flash.\nWhen she woke up in the morning, Su Miaomiao had already forgotten what happened before going to bed the previous night. But she still remembered what the uncle driver said.\nAfter Gu Jialing and Xu Shou left by bicycle, Su Miaomiao leaned on his back and asked, \u201cTaoist Master, are there really very few men who can cook delicious food?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked ahead and said lightly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t find such a man in the future?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI said before that even if uncle and aunt urge you to marry, as long as you say you haven\u2019t met someone you like, they won\u2019t force you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao breathed a sigh of relief, stayed quiet for a while, then suddenly smiled and said, \u201cIf they don\u2019t urge me, then I wouldn\u2019t look for him and stay with the Taoist master all the time.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s still early, we haven\u2019t graduated. You don\u2019t worry about this kind of problem.\u201d\nWhen they arrived at the gymnasium, the two of them changed into their sportswear and went to play first.\nAfter taking a break, Xie Jingyuan sat next to Su Miaomiao drinking water, who turned her head and saw his rolling Adam\u2019s apple again.\nAt this time, what happened the night before finally came to mind, she turned around guiltily and turned her back to him to drink water.\nThat movement was not small, Xie Jingyuan glanced over.\nWhen screwing back the bottle cap, Xie Jingyuan thought about it, but still asked, \u201cLast night, you\u2026\u201d\nAs soon as he started, Su Miaomiao immediately admitted her mistake, \u201cTaoist Master , I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I just watched it rolling around for fun, so I couldn\u2019t hold back.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan actually guessed it.\nWhen his Adam\u2019s apple just became obvious, she came over to look at it and insisted on touching it.\nXie Jingyuan twisted the bottle cap for the last time, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it again.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded repeatedly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou are not allowed to play with other people\u2019s Adam apples too.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao still nodded.\nXie Jingyuan stood up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nAfter being scolded early in the morning, Su Miaomiao was in a little bad mood.\nDuring the recess, she was about to lie down and sleep for a while, when the male classmate at the back desk suddenly asked her, \u201cSu Miaomiao, will you participate in the National Day Open?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao turned her head and saw clearly the appearance of the male classmate, he looked neat and was wearing glasses.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\nThe venue of the competition was in Beijing, which was very convenient.\nThe male student\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cThen can you get me two tickets? I can give you the price of the tickets. I wanted to buy it before, but the tickets were all sold out!\u201d\nIn fact, his girlfriend was not interested in that competition at first, but knowing that Su Miaomiao in his class had a chance to win the championship, her interest suddenly erupted like a volcano.\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to agree, Zhao Lu coughed beside her.\nSu Miaomiao suddenly remembered that Sister Fang had prepared eight tickets for her, three for the Taoist master and the others, three for the roommates, and two for her cousin and Zhou Hang.\n\u201cI\u2019ve given away all of mine.\u201d\nThe male classmate looked disappointed.\nSu Miaomiao noticed that his Adam\u2019s apple was not good-looking at all.\nThe Taoist master was also worried that she would play with other people\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple. Was she that careless?\nOctober 6th, the penultimate day of the National Day holiday, was also the final day of that China Open.\n\u00a0Banners supporting Su Miaomiao were hung on the campus of the university.\nGu Jialing came to the university early to take pictures, and sent all of them to Su Miaomiao.\nThat final would be the third match between Su Miaomiao and the foreign veteran. Su Miaomiao failed to win the championship the previous two times, so that time there may not be any chance.\nXie Rong pre-booked two tickets for private rooms, both with eighteen seats, one for Xie\u2019s family and one for Su Mingan\u2019s.\nSu Mingan called all the relatives who were available on both sides, such as Su Miaomiao\u2019s grandparents, uncles, and cousins. In short, none of the eighteen seats were empty. Tang Yan wasn\u2019t ready to bring her boyfriend to meet her parents, so she gave her ticket to a close buddy of Zhou Hang, and she happily went to meet her family.\nXie Rong only had a family of five. When Xie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing came to welcome Grandma Tao, Xie Rong invited the three children to go with them to the private room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m old, otherwise I would sit outside.\u201d\nShe wanted her grandson to watch the game in the open, as she didn\u2019t want him to listen to Qiao Lili\u2019s eccentricities, so both sides should watch separately.\nXie Rong smiled with no intention to force anyone.\nThe Xie family arrived first. Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei were going to the airport to pick up their relatives from Jiangcheng. They arrived relatively late, but eighteen relatives walked over in a mighty manner, with great momentum.\nGu Jialing originally envied Su Miaomiao for having parents who love her, but when he saw so many relatives, he became even more sour. With that many people, Su Miaomiao would receive so many red envelopes (new year money) every year.\nOn the relative side, Tang Yan held Grandma Su\u2019s arm, pointed at Xie Jingyuan and said, \u201cThat\u2019s Miaomiao\u2019s boyfriend, Xie Jingyuan!\u201d\nThe \u201clove relationship\u201d between Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan had long been spread among the relatives of both parties.\nGrandma Su wore her reading glasses and looked at Xie Jingyuan with a smile. The more she looked at him, the more pleasing he looked in her eyes.\nBefore the group of relatives came over, Gu Jialing approached Xu Shou, touched his arm and said, \u201cWhy do I feel that they are looking at the Taoist master with strange eyes?\u201d\nThe well-informed Xu Shou felt aggrieved for the Taoist master in his heart.\nA good Taoist master, because of being entangled by Su Miaomiao, was judged critically by those mortals as their prospective son-in-law.\n\u201cUncle, aunt, Miaomiao is preparing for the competition, so she let us pick you up,\u201d Xie Jingyuan politely explained when the two sides met.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry for the trouble.\u201d\nAs she said that, Tang Shiwei took Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arm and introduced him to the relatives. As for Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, although she also wanted to introduce them, they were not the main attraction.\nGrandpa Su: \u201cI heard that you are doing two majors. Young people are amazing.\u201d\nGrandpa Su: \u201cThe young man looks good, our Miaomiao really has a good eye.\u201d\nGrandma Su: \u201cMiaomiao has a good eye, and Jing Yuan has an even better eye!\u201d\nGrandma Su: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Our Miaomiao is beautiful and good at playing tennis. You can\u2019t find anyone like her in the whole country.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt was bustling, so the three college students sent everyone to the box, and then left first.\nGu Jialing wiped his sweat while walking, \u201cIt\u2019s better to be in the woods, these humans are noisier than birds.\u201d\nXu Shou was also very thankful that the Xu family did not have many relatives, and he had strengthened his singleness.\nHe also persuaded Xie Jingyuan in a low voice, \u201cTaoist Master, you\u2019d better separate yourself from Su Miaomiao as soon as possible.\u201d\nIf the relatives continued to misunderstand like that, the Taoist master would have to marry Su Miaomiao in the future. If not, those enthusiastic people would be fierce to him in the future.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cHey, why did you come late? The game is about to start!\u201d\nThe eight tickets Su Miaomiao had were consecutive numbers, so Zhou Hang\u2019s good buddy and her three roommates were all there.\nGu Jialing sighed, \u201cWe were entertaining her relatives.\u201d\nZhao Lu looked behind them, \u201cAren\u2019t they sitting here?\u201d\nAthletes probably wouldn\u2019t get too many tickets, they got free ones. If Su Miaomiao\u2019s relatives had to pay for tickets themselves, that would be embarrassing.\nGu Jialing: \u201cThey are in a private box.\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nZhou Hang was not surprised to hear that. Tang Yan told him how powerful Xie Jingyuan\u2019s father was.\nXie Jingyuan sat in the middle seat, looking toward the arena. At that moment, Su Miaomiao and the foreign veteran entered the arena, walking side by side, chatting happily.\nShe had always been a top student. Since she decided to take the road of competition, Xie Jingyuan also specially strengthened her vocabulary expansion.\nUnder the anticipation of more than ten thousand spectators, the first game began.\nZhao Lu stared at Su Miaomiao\u2019s running figure obsessively, \u201cHave you noticed that Miaomiao always wears her diamond hair tie every time she competes?\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cOur Miaomiao is rich!\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu asked Gu Jialing, \u201cMiaomiao is usually very low-key, but she wears that diamond hair tie during competitions. Is there any special meaning? Lucky hair tie or something?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cShe, keeping a low profile? She\u2019s already saved a safe full of jewelry, and she doesn\u2019t usually wear it because she\u2019s afraid of losing it.\u201d\nThe three roommates: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe life of the school beauty really exceeded their imagination.\nIn the first game, Su Miaomiao lost 1-6.\nThe good friends in the spectator seats all had serious expressions, except for Xie Jingyuan who still had that cold expression that hardly changed.\nWhen the second game was 2-5, Zhao Lu secretly wiped away tears several times.\nShe knew that it was normal to win or lose, and Su Miaomiao was just eighteen years old, and it was not shameful to lose to a veteran in her thirties, but she was really sitting there and watching Su Miaomiao fight every time with her own eyes. She really couldn\u2019t stand the feeling of powerlessness when she tried so hard but missed the ball.\nAt the beginning of a new round, Gu Jialing legs began to shake.\nXu Shou frowned and knocked him hard.\nIt was the first time for Gu Jialing to visit Su Miaomiao\u2019s arena in person. At the critical moment, he was so nervous that he couldn\u2019t control himself.\nXu Shou knocked a few times but it didn\u2019t work, so he ignored him, frowned and continued to pay attention to Su Miaomiao.\nBut just when the entire audience believed that the foreign veteran would easily win the second game, Su Miaomiao started to catch up.\n2-5, 3-5, 4-5, 5-5!\nAfter a few long rounds of stalemate, Su Miaomiao successfully overtook and won the second round.\nThe domestic audience stood up and applauded. On the field, Su Miaomiao was sweating sitting next to Sister Fang to rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Usually, Su Miaomiao was so obedient and lazy. They couldn\u2019t see Su Miaomiao\u2019s training, and they couldn\u2019t really appreciate her hard work. Watching the game made them feel that their child worked hard, but they even attributed that power to her talent.\nIn the Xie family\u2019s box, Grandma Tao\u2019s eyes were red.\nQiao Lili looked at Xie Rong and sighed, but she hoped that no matter how serious Su Miaomiao\u2019s injury was, she would not be able to play in the future.\nShe had no enmity with Su Miaomiao, but the more powerful the girl was, the more Xie Rong\u2019s heart would be on Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, and the less property would be distributed to her children.\nAfter the break, the third game began.\u00a0\nThat time, Su Miaomiao faced Xie Jingyuan and the others.\nBefore the start of the match, Zhao Lu jumped up three times and waved at Su Miaomiao. Gu Jialing also jumped up when he saw her. He hoped that she would win, as long as she won, he wouldn\u2019t care if the Taoist master favored her in the future.\nSu Miaomiao saw them, and also saw Xie Jingyuan sitting on the seat.\nShe actually didn\u2019t care much about winning or losing the game, she just wanted to finish it well with the veteran on the opposite side.\nThat would be the last match she would participate in that year, and if she wanted to play against a veteran opponent next time, she would have to wait until next year.\nFor the person she liked, Su Miaomiao would be reluctant to leave.\nThe more reluctant she was, the more she cherished that game.\nEvery time she hit the ball, Su Miaomiao would laugh. The more the opponent striked, the harder she chased it, and then she also hit the ball back.\nThe veteran was amused by the expression on Su Miaomiao\u2019s face. She could tell that this child was different from other players. Su Miaomiao was not playing in competition, she was playing to chase the ball.\nThe last game was not as difficult as the one in the middle. With Su Miaomiao hitting the last ball, the veteran hit the air with her racket. Su Miaomiao won the third game with a score of 6-4, and also won the women\u2019s singles championship.\n\u201cAhhh, Miaomiao won!\u201d Zhao Lu and her roommates hugged each other and jumped up and down excitedly.\nGu Jialing also wanted to hug, but the Taoisit master refused him with his eyes while Xu Shou looked disgusted. He then wanted to hug the girls, but Xu Shou grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back.\nThere was no other way, Gu Jialing had no choice but to hug the two men, Zhou Hang, and the smell of sweat from the two of them was ignored.\nThey were just watching the game, why were they sweating so much?\nAfter receiving the award, Su Miaomiao walked out of the arena, and was surrounded by reporters. All enthusiastic reporters stopped her, so she could only answer them one by one with Sister Fang\u2019s help.\nWhen the reporters backed away, Tang Yan, Zhao Lu and the other young girls rushed over.\nSu Miaomiao took a breath.\nSuddenly, someone grabbed her wrist, Xie Jingyuan squeezed beside her, and said to Tang Yan and the others, \u201cShe has injuries on her body, so it\u2019s not suitable to hug her for now.\u201d\nTang Yan and the others hurriedly backed away.\nXie Jingyuan also let go of Su Miaomiao\u2019s hand.\nBut Su Miaomiao grabbed him, first handed the heavy golden trophy to her cousin, and then moved toward Xie Jingyuan, wanting him to carry her.\nXie Jingyuan said in a low voice, \u201cThere are too many people here, it\u2019s not suitable.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted.\nHe brought her to Su Mingan\u2019s side.\nWhen Su Mingan saw that his daughter was too tired to walk, he immediately squatted down.\nSu Miaomiao lay down, sniffed, and said in disgust, \u201cWhy is dad sweating so much?\u201d\nThat was her own father, and she wouldn\u2019t want him to carry her if he was someone else.\nSu Mingan couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cWhen you played, Dad was also playing with you in his heart. I sweat because I was nervous.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThe Taoist master is not sweating.\u201d He still smelled so good.\nSu Mingan: \u201cThat means he\u2019s not nervous, so that means he doesn\u2019t care about you!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao tilted her head and found that the Taoist master, Gu Jialing, and Xu Shou were walking at the back, but when she looked over, the Taoist master also looked over immediately.\nWith just a calm look, the wound on her body seemed to be less painful.\nHer father liked to talk nonsense.\nThe Taoist master cared about her, and he would secretly cure her when everyone was away.\nAfter the game, there were still many things to deal with, but Su Miaomiao had always been a maverick, and she had the help of Sister Fang. So Su Miaomiao and her relatives went back to the lakeside community directly after leaving the game.\nThe relatives of the Su family gathered in Su Miaomiao\u2019s apartment.\nAlthough Xie Rong had already regarded the members of the Su family as in-laws, after all, the two families just tacitly agreed, and the marriage hadn\u2019t happened yet. In addition, 801 was an apartment that Gu Jialing rented, so it was neither suitable for him to go to his apartment to join in the fun, nor was it appropriate for him to call the shots and invite guests there.\nSo the scene changed, Gu Jialing was holding Grandma Tao\u2019s hand, he and Qiao Lili were sitting on the sofa.\nXu Shou politely brought tea, and then stood behind Xie Jingyuan. If he changed into a black suit, he would look like a bodyguard.\nXie Rong had only one idea. His son was powerful and charismatic, making friends value him so much.\nXie Rong also personally led Xu Shou for two months so he knew Xu Shou\u2019s ability. He was simply a natural leader.\nIf his son insisted on starting a pharmaceutical company in the future, he could also train Xu Shou to manage his business for his son.\n\u201cCome and sit, why are you standing up?\u201d Xie Rong waved at the two outstanding young men.\nXie Jingyuan looked at his watch and asked, \u201cUncle said that we are going to the hotel to celebrate at night, did he invite you?\u201d\nQiao Lili smiled and said, \u201cWe were invited, but Miaomiao won the championship, and the family is very lively. Your father said it\u2019s better not to affect their family atmosphere. When you return to Anshi for the holiday, we will celebrate with Miaomiao alone.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you don\u2019t say a word, no one would treat you as dumb.\u201d\nXie Jingze, the elder brother of the twins, said, \u201cBrother has always been like this, as if everyone owes him.\u201d\nQiao Lili also gestured to her son to stop talking. Xie Rong was too partial to Xie Jingyuan, saying those things would only aggravate his dislike for the three of them.\nXie Rong\u2019s temper was not that small. If not, he couldn\u2019t have managed his big group.\nHe simply treated those three as air, and brought them over to watch the game, just wanting to show in front of everyone in the Su family that he attached great importance to that marriage.\n\u201cI told the driver to take you back tomorrow morning.\u201d\nNo one cared about the departure of the family of four, including Grandma Tao.\nSu Mingan booked a five-star hotel nearby where his relatives would stay there, and everyone would go to the hotel\u2019s banquet hall for dinner that night.\n\u201cMiaomiao, is your injury serious? If you feel uncomfortable, you can rest at home, Dad will cook for you.\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao woke up from her nap and walked out, Su Mingan immediately expressed concern.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s muscles were sore all over, and her wrists, knees, and ankles were injured in several places, but she still came out for dinner.\nHer maternal and paternal grandparents were so old, but they all made a special trip to watch her match, so how could she not accompany everyone to have dinner?\nBesides, only by going to the hotel together could she meet the Taoist master and find a chance for him to help her relieve her pain first.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not serious, I\u2019ve rested just now,\u201d Su Miaomiao said obediently with a smile.\nShe also didn\u2019t look like she had to be on bed rest.\nEveryone went out in peace, and Tang Shiwei also called out Grandma Tao, Xie Jingyuan, and the two other college students.\nIf Gu Jialing and Xu Shou were normal people, it might indeed be embarrassing to go to the Su family gathering, but they were both reincarnations of demons, so they didn\u2019t care about trivial matters.\nWhen they got downstairs, Su Miaomiao walked up to Xie Jingyuan, and said as if there was no one else around, \u201cI don\u2019t want to walk there, you take me by bicycle.\u201d\nIn fact, the hotel was only one kilometer away from there, and it took only ten minutes to walk.\nBut everyone knew that Su Miaomiao had worked hard in the competition and had injuries on her body, so it was better for her to take a taxi.\n\u201cThen let\u2019s all take a taxi?\u201d Su Mingan suggested.\nTang Yan\u2019s father said, \u201cLet Miaomiao and her grandparents take a taxi. We will walk over, the road is blocked there, so maybe they might not be as fast as us.\u201d\nGrandpa Su: \u201cI want to walk too. After sitting for a whole day, I want to move around now.\u201d\nThe five elderly people, including Grandma Tao, did not want to take a taxi, so Xie Jingyuan said, \u201cThen I will take Miaomiao with me on the bicycle.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cLet her ride the bicycle by herself.\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao insisted on taking Xie Jingyuan with her, the relatives looked at Xie Jingyuan and smiled kindly, only Su Mingan\u2019s eyes were as wide as copper bells.\nXie Jingyuan signaled Xu Shou and Gu Jialing to help Grandma Tao with his eyes, and said to everyone, \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the hotel to see the situation first, and ask the restaurant to prepare.\u201d\nTang Shiwei rushed ahead of her husband and said, \u201cGo, go.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan rode away on his bicycle.\nHe didn\u2019t speed up on purpose, but the wheels ran faster than walking, and the bicycle quickly turned a corner, out of everyone\u2019s sight.\nJust a while ago, Su Miaomiao listened to Xie Jingyuan, and put her hands on her lap obediently. But at that moment it didn\u2019t matter, and she immediately wrapped her arms around Xie Jingyuan\u2019s waist, and leaned on him comfortably.\nThere were some sweet-scented osmanthus trees planted in the community, which was the time when the flowers were blooming.\nThe aroma was stronger when the place was close to the sweet-scented osmanthus tree, and became weaker when it was farther away.\nXie Jingyuan glanced back, rode under the shade of a row of trees, and asked her in a low voice, \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cShoulders, elbows and knees all hurt.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan held the handle with one hand, while his right hand held her rounded elbow.\nShe rubbed his back comfortably as the coolness permeated through his sleeves and skin into her veins and bone marrow.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s spiritual power was limited, he just temporarily relieved the pain and then stopped.\nAfter leaving the lakeside community, he speeded up, but everyone arrived at the hotel five or six minutes earlier.\nThere were already waiters busy in the banquet hall.\nXie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao sat at the innermost table. When she pretended to drop the fork, Xie Jingyuan squatted down on one knee to pick it up.\nWhere the waiters couldn\u2019t see, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s hands held Su Miaomiao\u2019s knees and ankles successively.\nWhen he stopped, Su Miaomiao was still not comfortable enough. She looked at him eagerly with big moist eyes, \u201cTouch it for a while, it still hurts.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan corrected expressionlessly, \u201cIt\u2019s a treatment.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao immediately changed her words, \u201cTreat me for a while.\u201d\nHe sat on the seat next to her, still with the same cold expression, \u201cIt\u2019s drained.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted.\nXie Jingyuan looked away.\nIt was really difficult to cultivate in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It took him more than ten years to dig a little place and store a little spiritual energy.\nWhen it ran out, it took him two hours to meditate and recharge it.\nIt may be nine o\u2019clock after dinner and back to the community\u2026\nAfter calculating the time, Xie Jingyuan said in a low voice, \u201cAround twelve o\u2019clock, I will come to treat you again.\u201d\nIf it was just muscle soreness, he could help her relieve it when they meet next morning, and the pain would not be delayed.\nSu Miaomiao was not very satisfied, but the Taoist master was not as good to her as in her previous life, so she could do nothing.\nAfter Su Mingan and others arrived, Xie Jingyuan consciously gave up the seat next to Su Miaomiao.\nExcept for Su Miaomiao who was at the same table with the old people, Xie Jingyuan and the other two sat with Tang Yan and other young people.\nTang Yan officially introduced Xie Jingyuan to Su Miaomiao\u2019s other cousins, \u201cLook, this is the man behind our Miaomiao\u2014\u2014Xie Jingyuan!\u201d\nThe young people all laughed.\nXie Jingyuan just lowered his eyes, and Xu Shou endured it.\nGu Jialing leaned over to him and asked in a low voice, \u201cAre they molesting the Taoist master by doing this?\u201d\nXu Shou pursed his lips.\nThe Taoist master was handsome, and some frivolous women in his previous life deliberately ran to Qingxu Temple. They said it was to offer incense, but it was to deliberately approach the Taoist master, but then they were all scared away by him.\nIt was a pity that he couldn\u2019t change his form, and couldn\u2019t use it to scare those people. The Taoist master had to worry about the cat\u2019s parents, so as not to embarrass the relatives over there.\nAfter the meal, Xu Shou was very unhappy.\nBut he looked the same when he was happy or unhappy, so no one was suspicious. It was Su Miaomiao\u2019s cousin who secretly took a few pictures of Xu Shou.\nTang Shiwei missed her daughter very much, and originally planned to sleep with her in the same bed that night.\nSu Miaomiao was thinking about asking the Taoist master to come and heal her, so she said that she was afraid of rolling around at night and bumping into her mother, which would hurt her hidden wounds.\nTang Shiwei thought about it, and then decided to stay in the hotel with Su Mingan.\nThe couple were very busy, and they had to send their relatives to the airport the next morning, and they also had to rush to Anshi, so they slept early.\nXie Jingyuan rode a bicycle with Su Miaomiao, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing ran to follow, and the four returned to the lakeside community.\nBack in the apartment, Xie Jingyuan locked himself in the bedroom and never went out again.\u00a0\nGu Jialing drank wine at night, and soon fell asleep on the bed.\nXu Shou didn\u2019t lie down until eleven o\u2019clock while reading.\nDue to his nature, Xu Shou woke up when the door of another room opened, even if it was a very soft voice.\nDid he want to go to the toilet?\nAs soon as the idea came up, the Taoist master\u2019s voice suddenly rang in his ears, \u201cShe has an injury, I am going to help her heal.\u201d\nXu Shou listened to the familiar footsteps that left 801 directly, and went to 802 next door.\nSu Miaomiao fell down several times during the competition because she was chasing the ball with all her strength. Xu Shou fully understood what the Taoist master said, and fell asleep again.\nAlthough Su Miaomiao was sleeping, she was in a state of light sleep because of several faint pains. When the sound of keys opening the door came from the entrance, Su Miaomiao woke up suddenly.\u00a0\nIt was the sound of the Taoist master\u2019s footsteps.\nSu Miaomiao continued to lie on the bed.\nXie Jingyuan came to the bedroom door, thought about it, and knocked lightly.\nShe said lazily, \u201cCome in.\u201d\nHearing that, he pushed the door open and switched the lights on.\nThe light was bright, Su Miaomiao immediately shrank her head into the bed, \u201cDon\u2019t turn on the light!\u201d\nShe felt uncomfortable.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan immediately turned it off, she poked her head out again.\nXie Jingyuan came to the bed according to his memory, and found that she was not moving, so he whispered, \u201cSit up.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hummed, \u201cI don\u2019t want to move, you come up.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan just stayed silent by the bed for a minute, and then heard Su Miaomiao\u2019s breathing getting lighter. If he didn\u2019t do anything again, she would fall back into sleep.\nAt that time, the outside temperature was only ten degrees, and the room temperature was higher, but she should be covered.\nXie Jingyuan sat on the side of the bed and said to her, \u201cWhere does it hurt the most?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao closed her eyes and muttered, \u201cThe right knee and elbow still hurts.\u201d\nEvery opponent on the field was at an international leading level, and every person was packed with strong strength.\nFrom the first day of the competition, the athletes were like machines that were overloaded, with muscles constantly pulling and twisting, and joints constantly rubbing and shaking.\nSu Miaomiao pulled the quilt, stretched out her right leg, and pulled up the hem of the nightgown.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes were already used to the darkness. He pressed down on the hem of her skirt after she exposed her knee, and covered her with the quilt.\nWhen his spiritual power was about to drain, Su Miaomiao hummed and stretched out her right arm actively.\nXie Jingyuan used the last bit of spiritual power on her elbow joint.\nThe refreshing spiritual power made Su Miaomiao sober up a bit. She looked at the blurred shadow of the Taoist master in front of her, took his hand and asked, \u201cDid it get drained again?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cBut my whole body is sore, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable turning over. Please give me a massage.\u201d\nHumans had a way of massage, which could also relieve muscle soreness. If she didn\u2019t have to accompany her relatives, she could go to the tennis team to enjoy a massage.\nHe had accompanied her to the tennis team and heard her voice in the massage room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So she turned around, wrapped her arms around his waist and wouldn\u2019t let him go.\nThe peach smell around Xie Jingyuan became even stronger, as if she had also turned into a peach demon, rolling into his arms and not allowing him to move away.\nSu Miaomiao took a deep breath, \u201cTaoist master, you smell really good.\u201d\nIf the Taoist master was a tree in her previous life, she would settle down and meditate on the tree instead of changing places frequently and not settling in a fixed place.\nXie Jingyuan could feel her soft and warm body, as well as her pure emotions.\nShe must understand the difference between men and women, but she only regarded herself as a cat.\nIn the dark, Xie Jingyuan patted her head, \u201cGo to sleep, I will treat you again in two hours.\u201d\nJust to relieve muscle soreness, the consumption of spiritual power would be much less, one time was enough.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to disturb Xu Shou\u2019s sleep frequently, so he agreed.\nSatisfied, Su Miaomiao let go of him and lay back under the quilt.\nXie Jingyuan was meditating on the ground beside the bed.\nThere was no danger in that world. When meditating, Xie Jingyuan concentrated his attention and was not distracted. Therefore, he did not notice in time that a \u201ccat\u201d was chasing his breath in her sleep, and she squinted her eyes. Stretching out her hand, she touched Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder, and she slid directly over the bed.\nXie Jingyuan woke up when she touched his shoulder, and before he could react, she had already nestled into his arms.\nMaybe at this time she realized that she was not a cat, and there was no place to bury her head, so she clung to his neck in a daze, put her head on one of his shoulders, and continued to sleep.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhat a smart cat. Her bare feet retracted immediately when they touched the cool floor. He sat on the floor, and she slept in his arms.\nXie Jingyuan picked her up and wanted to put her back on the bed, but she refused to let go, even if she fell asleep, she knew that that \u201ctree\u201d was her favorite nest.\nAs long as Xie Jingyuan stood up, she would use all four limbs to wrap him up. Xie Jingyuan threw off her legs, but then her arms quickly climbed up again.\nIt was already the middle of the night. No matter how troublesome the cat was, the cat slept soundly. Only Xie Jingyuan\u2019s breathing became more chaotic.\nHe had no choice but to meditate with a \u201ccat\u201d in his arms.\nThe operation of spiritual power made his body temperature higher than usual, just like a humanoid air conditioner, so there was no need to worry about Su Miaomiao catching cold.\nAt three o\u2019clock in the morning, Xie Jingyuan treated Su Miaomiao again.\nShe was asleep, but she could feel what the Taoist master had done, and happily rubbed her head on his shoulder.\nXie Jingyuan thought for a while and said in a low voice, \u201cGo back to bed and sleep first, I\u2019ll go buy fish, so that you can drink fish soup when you wake up.\u201d\nThat time, he put Su Miaomiao on the bed again, and Su Miaomiao finally did not pester him again.\nXie Jingyuan immediately returned to his room.\nIn the second bedroom, Xu Shou heard the footsteps of the Taoist master, and continued to sleep deeply.\nXie Jingyuan, who returned to his room, checked the time and continued to meditate.\nAt 5:30 in the morning, Xie Jingyuan walked out of the room, and when he came out of the bathroom, he saw Xu Shou standing outside.\n\u201cWhy did you get up so early?\u201d\nThe Taoist master knew that he was alert, and even if he got up early, he would stay in the room and read a book, but that day he was the first one to leave the room.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cShe wants to eat fish, so I\u2019ll go to the vegetable market.\u201d\nXu Shou pursed his lips, but thinking of Su Miaomiao\u2019s hard work in the competition, and at the same time winning glory for the country, it was understandable for the Taoist master to be more indulgent.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d\nHow could Xu Shou make the Taoist master worry about such trivial matters?\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWell, buy three.\u201d\nShe liked to drink that kind of thick fish soup. One fish could only make a big bowl, and three fish would be enough for the three demons.\nXu Shou\u2019s eyes got bright, and he went out after washing his face.\nXie Jingyuan went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.\nTen minutes later, Xu Shou came back with three packed fish. As a dog who had experienced two lives and was proficient in the world, Xu Shou was almost omnipotent. He helped the Taoist master to share all worries. But even if he followed the recipe and practiced every step of cooking, the taste of the cooked food was just not good. Su Miaomiao attributed it to him being too stinky, so Gu Jialing didn\u2019t say anything.\nTherefore, Xu Shou could only stand at the door of the kitchen full of self-blame, watching the once immortal Taoist master be swept away by the smoke and fire of the world.\nWhen the first scent of fish soup wafted out of the kitchen, Gu Jialing sniffed and came out.\n\u201cWow, Taoist Master, you\u2019re so nice, you even made breakfast!\u201d\nDuring the National Day holiday, because many students stayed in the campus, the cafeteria of Beijing University was open. The three of them had been eating in the cafeteria a few days ago, and Su Miaomiao lived in the tennis center with Sister Fang.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Xie Jingyuan glanced at him and asked Gu Jialing to brush his teeth first.\nGu Jialing hummed his opera ditty and went back to the master bedroom.\nAt seven o\u2019clock in the morning, Xie Jingyuan called Su Miaomiao, but she didn\u2019t pick up.\nGu Jialing: \u201cIs she too tired? Then let her sleep well. The fish soup won\u2019t taste good when it\u2019s cold. I\u2019ll drink it for her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him, took her fish soup, put it back into the pot and continued to warm it.\nHe guessed that Su Miaomiao must also have slept late, so Xu Shou and Gu Jialing stayed there, and he went to the hotel.\nSu Mingan and other relatives were having breakfast in the restaurant.\nAs soon as the handsome and tall college student walked into the restaurant, Tang Shiwei saw him and waved with a smile.\nThe tables around her were filled with relatives.\n\u201cMiaomiao must still be sleeping, right?\u201d Tang Shiwei asked.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWell, she didn\u2019t pick up the phone.\u201d\nGrandma Su: \u201cLet her sleep, we\u2019ll leave later, so don\u2019t bother her.\u201d\nGrandpa Su: \u201cYes, Miaomiao has been working too hard recently, please don\u2019t disturb her.\u201d\nTang Yan blinked and smiled, \u201cAnyway, you will leave together.\u201d\nEveryone laughed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Although he didn\u2019t smile, his expression was a bit gentler than when facing Xie Rong.\nTang Shiwei: \u201cDid you have breakfast? Come eat with us.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019ve already eaten.\u201d\nGrandma Su: \u201cDid you eat outside?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI cooked myself.\u201d\n\u201cCan you cook?\u201d\n\u201cOnly some home dishes.\u201d\n\u201cHey, he is so handsome, studies so well and can cook, there are too few boys like this now.\u201d\nSu Mingan couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he said, \u201cHey, I can do it too!\u201d\nGrandma Su: \u201cYou were not as handsome as Jing Yuan when you were young.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cMom, the more you say that, the more Ming An becomes jealous of Jing Yuan.\u201d\nGrandma Su: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be jealous about, Jing Yuan is more handsome than him!\u201d\nTang Yan: \u201cHahaha! Uncle is too miserable!\u201d\nEarly in the morning, Xie Jingyuan first ran to the airport to see off relatives from the Tang family, and then went to the station to see off relatives from the Su family to Anshi.\n\u201cThis kid is not bad, I feel relieved to entrust Miaomiao to his care!\u201d After checking the tickets, when Xie Jingyuan was no longer in sight, Grandpa Su said to his son and daughter-in-law in satisfaction.\nThe cold boy who was not easy to get close to, was actually very good at taking care of others, and he was also polite in front of them. They were just in a relationship, but he came to see them off for Miaomiao.\nSu Mingan hummed, \u201cThey\u2019re only freshmen, don\u2019t think so far ahead.\u201d\nOutside the station, Xie Jingyuan took a taxi.\nWhile still in the taxi, Grandma Tao called. After dinner at the hotel the previous night, Xie Rong personally took Grandma Tao to his villa.\nQiao Lilin and her kids had been picked up by the driver, so Xie Rong could go with Grandma Tao and the four college students to scenic spots.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cMiaomiao is still sleeping.\u201d\nGrandma Tao: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, wait until Miaomiao wakes up.\u201d\nAfter the call ended, Xie Jingyuan checked the time again, it was almost ten o\u2019clock.\nReturning to the lakeside community, Xie Jingyuan called Su Miaomiao again when he walked outside her apartment.\nAfter several beeps, it finally went through, and her lazy humming sound came from inside.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at the door of apartment 801, walked to the safe passage, and asked in a low voice, \u201cDo you still want to sleep? It\u2019s already ten o\u2019clock.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI won\u2019t sleep anymore, I\u2019m hungry, I want to eat.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI made breakfast.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen I\u2019ll come over.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIs your body still sore?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao moved a bit, then she said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m not sore anymore, I slept very comfortably last night.\u201d\nUsually she basically only slept until around nine o\u2019clock, but that day she slept until ten o\u2019clock in one go, because it was too comfortable.\n\u201cTaoist Master, will you come to my side every night from now on?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao did not forget what happened the previous night, and happily invited him. It was getting colder, and she liked the temperature of his body.\nAfter a few seconds, she heard the Taoist master\u2019s stern and cold reprimand, \u201cGirls can\u2019t just invite men to sleep in their own room.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026Then I will secretly come to yours?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted and hung up the phone.\nEven if she was unhappy, she still had to eat breakfast.\nAfter changing clothes, Su Miaomiao went to 801.\nGu Jialing stared at her face and asked strangely, \u201cWhy do you look so good?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was injured on the field. He thought he would see a weak cat, but Su Miaomiao looked like some demons who had just been groomed in the previous life.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIs it?\u201d\nShe ran to look in the mirror, and was surprised to find that there was no trace of fatigue on her face, her eyes were bright, and her skin was so smooth that she couldn\u2019t help poking it.\nXu Shou was drying clothes on the balcony, and when Su Miaomiao came out, he also took a look.\nBut he knew that it was all because the Taoist master used his spiritual power to heal her.\n\u201cBreakfast is in the pot, you can get it yourself.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked around, \u201cWhere is the Taoist master?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cHe just came back from the station, don\u2019t disturb his sleep.\u201d\nFor the cat, the Taoist master paid too much.\nGu Jialing thought about the Taoist master\u2019s performance in the last couple days, crossed his arms and said, \u201cIt\u2019s too miserable to be a human son-in-law. You have to serve your wife and her relatives. Fortunately, the Taoist master is not really in a relationship with you.\u201d\nWhat Su Miaomiao thought of was her father, who also took care of her mother every day, and was very happy to serve her.\nAlthough the Taoist master didn\u2019t regard her as his wife, he treated her like a cat. If she was such a beautiful cat, just by his side, the Taoist master would be very happy.\nJust thinking about that, Xie Jingyuan came out of the room, took a look at her, then went to the kitchen, and brought out her fish soup.\nSu Miaomiao thought with a smile, \u2018Zhao Lu was right.\u2019\nBecause Su Miaomiao got up late, it was almost eleven o\u2019clock when the four of them met Xie Rong and Grandma Tao in the park.\nGrandma Tao was a little worried about Su Miaomiao\u2019s physical problems. She was afraid that the child would ignore her physical injuries just to go out with them.\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan, smiled and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, I am fine after a night of sleep.\u201d\nShe also raised her arms to reveal her elbows. She had fair and clear skin, neither red nor swollen, which was better than the stars who shoot skin care commercials.\nXie Rong said, \u201cThen let\u2019s take a boat around on the lake, we can also have lunch.\u201d\nAt Grandma Tao\u2019s age, it was unrealistic to take her to climb mountains or walk for a long time. Xie Rong\u2019s plan was to only visit that one scenic spot.\nWhen they got to the lake, Xie Rong rented a six-seater hand-cranked boat.\nThere were three seats on each side, and Grandma Tao sat between Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Rong asked her, \u201cMiaomiao, you are so good, did any company invite you to be an advertising spokesperson?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "144": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-144/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it came to business, Xie Rong was afraid that the children would be too naive and suffer from the contract.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYes, many people contacted Sister Fang, but the Taoist master said that I must be honest when shooting commercials. My skin condition has nothing to do with those skin care products, and I don\u2019t like some kinds of snacks and drinks at all, so I didn\u2019t care about their advertisements. There are a lot of sporting goods, I have to try every one and choose the most comfortable one for me.\u201d\nGu Jialing shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s too wasteful, it\u2019s all money!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cA gentleman gets money in a proper way. She must be responsible to consumers.\u201d\nGrandma Tao agreed with the children\u2019s choice, \u201cIt should be like this, anyway, our Miaomiao is not short of money.\u201d\nXie Rong discovered that except for Gu Jialing who was a little more slick, the other three children had a strong sense of morality.\nAfter being on the boat for fifty minutes, the six people went ashore and walked slowly toward the restaurant.\nGu Jialing looked around, wondering, \u201cMiaomiao won the championship, why didn\u2019t anyone ask her for a picture?\u201d\nGrandma Tao smiled and said, \u201cThey probably don\u2019t recognize Miaomiao.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was very beautiful, but she wore sportswear on the field, showing a side of concentration, aggressiveness, and explosive power. That was the side that impressed the audience the most. Su Miaomiao usually liked to wear a white dress, had an obedient face, and was quiet. She rarely spoke unless she was arguing with Gu Jialing. Such a huge contrast made it difficult for people who were not familiar with her to recognize her.\nAfter lunch, Xie Rong and Grandma Tao went back home.\nUniversity would start again, so Xie Jingyuan, Gu Jialing, and Xu Shou went back to their rooms to read books.\nSu Miaomiao stayed alone in her apartment. After a while, Sister Fang called to discuss the endorsement. New and old classmates sent messages to congratulate her on winning the championship.\nSu Miaomiao picked out students who she remembered and responded to the message. She ignored the others who she had no impression of. In the end, she simply set the phone to silent.\nAfter finishing her vacation homework, Su Miaomiao took a shower and asked Xie Jingyuan to come over to help dry the clothes.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan was about to go out, Gu Jialing asked curiously, \u201cWhere is the Taoist master going?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at him and said, \u201cHelping her clean up.\u201d\nAfter Xie Jingyuan left, Gu Jialing thought for a while, and ran to Xu Shou, \u201cWhen we were in high school, the Taoist master just helped Su Miaomiao carry her school bag and hand out tissues, but now he even has to clean up the toilet for her. Why is he too kind to her?\u201d\nXu Shou\u2019s expression was heavy, \u201cThe Taoist master is keeping his word. He promised the Su family that he will take good care of her, so he will naturally do so.\u201d\nIf Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t dislike his scent, he would definitely do those trivial matters for the Taoist master.\nAfter Gu Jialing heard his explanation, he no longer doubted anything. He instead started to blame himself for not being reborn in the cat\u2019s house, and not being a neighbor with the Taoist master.\nSu Miaomiao sat on the sofa and watched Xie Jingyuan help her.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan finished mopping the floor and went to the bathroom to put the mop, she chased after him and hugged him from behind.\nSu Miaomiao rubbed her head against him, \u201cTonight, will you come to my side to meditate?\u201d With the Taoist master accompanying her, she would sleep very warmly and comfortably.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI said many times that a man can\u2019t just enter a woman\u2019s room.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI also said that it\u2019s okay for the Taoist master to treat me like a cat. Others don\u2019t know I\u2019m a cat, but you know.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the ground, \u201cUnless you turn back into a cat, I can\u2019t treat you like a cat.\u201d\nWith that said, he pulled Su Miaomiao\u2019s hand away, turned and walked out.\nSu Miaomiao chased him out, \u201cYou\u2019re lying, you obviously treat me like a cat.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan stopped, turned back to her and asked, \u201cWhen did I treat you like a cat?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao came over and confronted him face to face, \u201cIf you don\u2019t treat me like a cat, then why are you so kind to me? Why do you help me wipe my hands, do housework, serve food and water, and when I am sleepy, you tell me to sleep on your back? If I want to play, you don\u2019t get angry at me for disturbing your studies and you play tennis with me every day. You have never done these things for Xu Shou, Gu Jialing, and last night, last night I hugged you, but you didn\u2019t push me away.\u201d\nWhy did it work the previous night but not every night?\nXie Jingyuan looked into her clear eyes that stubbornly wanted him to admit, \u201cWho told you that these things could prove that I treat you as a cat?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, took out her notebook, and showed him the cat videos uploaded by those netizens, \u201cLook, other cat slaves take care of their cat owner like this. Zhao Lu treats her Tangtang better than you treat me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0Zhao Lu, cat slave, cat owner.\nHe finally knew why she was watching the cat video on the sofa that night, and why she looked at him with triumphant eyes.\nIt turned out that she had proclaimed herself the owner and recognized him as her slave.\nXie Jingyuan turned off her notebook.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s fingers were almost pinched by the notebook, and when she raised her head, she met a cold and majestic face.\nSu Miaomiao was stunned.\nThe Taoist master in her previous life was always like that, like a piece of ice that no one could melt, but Xie Jingyuan, who was reincarnated with her, rarely showed that expression.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her, as if he was only looking at himself reflected in her eyes.\n\u201cI take care of you not because I treat you like a cat, but because you treat yourself like a cat, because you are too lazy to take care of yourself.\u201d\n\u201cXu Shou and Gu Jialing had learned things a long time ago. Only you, who have been doted on by your parents, have never learned it.\u201d\n\u201cYou are not a cat, and I am not a slave.\u201d\n\u201cStarting tomorrow, do your own thing, and I won\u2019t care about you anymore.\u201d\nAfter finishing the last sentence, Xie Jingyuan walked away expressionlessly.\nSu Miaomiao froze in place until the sound of closing the door came from the entrance.\nShe looked at the door, then at her notebook.\nSo, was the Taoist master really not a cat slave?\nThe Taoist master really didn\u2019t care about her anymore?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "145": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-145/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a sudden \u201cbang\u201d sound in the bathroom, and Su Miaomiao walked over to take a look. It turned out that Xie Jingyuan had not placed the mop properly and it fell to the ground.\nSu Miaomiao stared at the mop, and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s words rang in her ears, saying that he wouldn\u2019t take care of her, that she couldn\u2019t learn what Gu Jialing and Xu Shou would do.\nSu Miaomiao curled her lips. She couldn\u2019t do it because she had been helped all the time.\nShe lived alone for a hundred years in her previous life, didn\u2019t she also live well?\nPicking up the mop and putting it away, Su Miaomiao turned off the light, and got into bed with anger.\nThe quilt was carefully selected by her father, and it warmed up in a short time, and the autumn dew on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s body still remained on the quilt.\nSu Miaomiao thought of her past self. She would go to the river to drink water in spring, summer and winter. Autumn had the most dew. She just had to leave the nest and lick the dewdrops on the leaves. When she had drunk enough, she would move the leaves with her paws to see the shiny, round dewdrops rolling around on it. After playing enough, Su Miaomiao would squat by the grass, tilt her head to watch the sun shine on the dewdrops, and then the dewdrops would reflect colorful rays of light.\nThinking of something fun, Su Miaomiao fell asleep with a smile.\nThe next morning, Su Miaomiao was woken up by the alarm clock as usual, washed her face and brushed her teeth, and went out with her bag.\nOutside the door, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing were already waiting for her.\nSu Miaomiao looked at the door panel of 801 suspiciously, \u201cWhere is the Taoist master?\u201d\nXu Shou stared at her carefully, \u201cDid you make the Taoist master angry?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was at a loss at first, and then a little guilty.\nGu Jialing looked shocked, \u201cYou really offended the Taoist master? What did you do?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao guessed, \u201cI always ask him to help, he dislikes it and told me to take care of myself.\u201d\nIt was also possible that he was not happy because she regarded him as a cat slave, but that couldn\u2019t be said. Xu Shou and Gu Jialing would laugh at her wishful thinking and daydreaming.\nXu Shou snorted, \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t bother the Taoist master.\u201d\nAfter determining the reason, Xu Shou left first.\nGu Jialing sighed, and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cThe Taoist master is good enough to us, especially you. You have to learn to accept it, but you even need the Taoist master\u2019s help to do cleaning, this is really too much.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glared at him and handed over her bag.\nGu Jialing raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhy, you can\u2019t order the Taoist master anymore, so you want to order me?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at his hair.\nGu Jialing endured it and obediently took her bag.\nAfter going downstairs, Su Miaomiao jumped into the back seat of Gu Jialing\u2019s bicycle, and it took a while to remember, \u201cIf the Taoist master doesn\u2019t care about me, who will play tennis with me in the morning?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cWho said that the Taoist master doesn\u2019t care about you anymore? He just didn\u2019t want to help you with those trivial things anymore. Playing tennis with you is a serious matter. How could he not care? He\u2019s already waiting for you in the gymnasium right now.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was dubious.\nWhen she arrived at the gymnasium, she found that Xie Jingyuan was indeed sitting there, with a book in his hand, a tennis racket next to him, and he had even changed into his sportswear, Su Miaomiao laughed.\nShe ran to change into her sports clothes, and happily came to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, \u201cTaoist Master, shall we start?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her lightly, then walked toward the side of the tennis court.\nAfter playing for an hour, Su Miaomiao went to take a shower and change clothes.\nHowever, when she came out again, she found that Xie Jingyuan, who used to be waiting for her outside, had disappeared.\nThere was no one outside the stadium either, neither him nor his bicycle.\nSu Miaomiao took out her phone and called him.\nAfter beeping four or five times, the phone was connected, and his cold voice rang in her ear, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao felt wronged, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait for me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI said I won\u2019t care about you in the future, except as a training partner.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pursed her lips.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cGo to the cafeteria by yourself. From now on, you should follow Zhao Lu and the others in the university, don\u2019t come looking for me.\u201d\nThat was the end of the call.\nSu Miaomiao looked at her phone, and then at her stomach that had started to growl, so she had to carry her bag and head to the cafeteria.\nWithout the bicycle, Su Miaomiao was two minutes late for the first class.\nThe teacher was very tolerant to her and let her in with a smile.\nIn the classroom, she didn\u2019t know who started it, but the students gathered for the first time after the holiday, applauded enthusiastically, and congratulated her on winning the No. 6 Open.\nEveryone laughed so happily and sincerely that Su Miaomiao smiled too.\nShe returned to her seat, the applause also stopped, and the teacher continued the class.\nZhao Lu secretly asked, \u201cWhy are you late? Didn\u2019t Xie Jingyuan see you off today?\u201d\nIn the past, Xie Jingyuan would send Su Miaomiao to the door of the classroom.\nSu Miaomiao curled her lips, \u201cHe said he will never care about me again.\u201d\nZhao Lu almost cried out, and asked in disbelief, \u201cWhat do you mean? You two broke up?\u201d\nNo way, Xie Jingyuan went to watch the match on the day of the final, and smiled when Su Miaomiao won, as if the flower that had been frozen for thousands of years had finally bloomed. Why did that suddenly happen?\nWhen it came to her identity as a cat, it was difficult to explain clearly in a few words. Usually at such a time, Su Miaomiao would be too lazy to explain.\nZhao Lu only thought that she was in a bad mood, and after thinking about it, she sent a message to Xie Jingyuan: Did you break up with Miaomiao?\nThe news fell like a stone in a sea, and there was no response.\nSu Miaomiao packed her bag and walked out of the teaching building with her roommates.\nThe campus was very large, but not every student could buy a bicycle. The three roommates usually walked to the cafeteria together.\nZhao Lu: \u201cMiaomiao, have you really broken up with Xie Jingyuan?\u201d\nThat was related to whether they would invite Su Miaomiao to the cafeteria with them. If Xie Jingyuan would come to pick her up and she was dragged away by them, that would be bad.\nOriginally, their being in love was a lie, but the Taoist master said he would leave her alone, so \u201cbreaking up\u201d was fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "146": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-146/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t show any aggrieved or sad expression. The roommates thought she would be sad, and looking at her obedient face, they were very distressed.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhao Lu took Su Miaomiao\u2019s arm and asked in a low voice while walking.\nZhao Lu didn\u2019t want to force her to say it, and just patted her hand, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you are so kind. Xie Jingyuan will definitely regret it, and he will come back soon to ask you to get back together.\u201d\nAnyway, she absolutely did not believe that Xie Jingyuan, who was so kind to Su Miaomiao, could break up with her cruelly.\nThe two must have quarreled and were currently in the stage of a cold war.\nChen Ling: \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, ignore him, and we\u2019ll see who regrets it first.\u201d\nThe roommates didn\u2019t believe that Su Miaomiao would make mistakes. A good girl who was busy training, studying and sleeping every day, how could she have time to make mistakes?\nSu Miaomiao was surrounded by enthusiastic roommates and went to the cafeteria.\nThat was also the cafeteria where the four often went to eat together.\nAfter Su Miaomiao came in, she subconsciously searched for familiar figures, but she didn\u2019t see the Taoist master and Xu Shou, only saw Gu Jialing waving at her at a table with two plates on it.\nZhao Lu: \u201cYou go first and listen to what Gu Jialing has to say.\u201d\nShe guessed that Xie Jingyuan might have sent a message through Gu Jialing.\nWhen the two sat down facing each other, Gu Jialing frowned and said, \u201cI think the Taoist master is really angry this time, and went to another cafeteria for lunch. Xu Shou followed him. Miaomiao, you should go to the Taoist master and apologize. Just say that you won\u2019t bother him with those trivial things in the future, so we can have lunch together.\u201d\nGu Jialing was not as sticky as cats and dogs, but he was used to the four of them eating together, so it felt strange to be separated suddenly.\nThe Taoist master and Xu Shou, those two guys cherished words like gold, so he came to Su Miaomiao, afraid that the Taoist master would keep getting angry, and treated them in that cold manner, Gu Jialing couldn\u2019t stand it, it was too scary.\nThe Taoist master was not angry, otherwise he would not continue to play tennis with her.\nHe just didn\u2019t want to take care of her anymore.\nNo matter how lazy or mischievous an ordinary cat was, the cat slaves would continue to pamper it as always. If the Taoist master didn\u2019t treat her as a cat, how could he always pamper her?\nThe previous night, the Taoist master told her coldly to let her do her own things. He really didn\u2019t care about her, and didn\u2019t take her to university or to the cafeteria.\nThe Taoist master had always said the same thing. What was the use of apologizing? She would only be scolded by him.\nSu Miaomiao still remembered that in her previous life, she carefully copied scriptures and showed them to him, and when she first met the Taoist master, he coldly ordered her to change back to her original form.\nNo matter what Gu Jialing said, she just didn\u2019t go.\nWhen the three roommates came over with their plates, they asked Gu Jialing about the matter.\nGu Jialing: \u201cI want Miaomiao to apologize to the Taoist master\u2026\u201d\nZhao Lu said, \u201cWhy should Miaomiao apologize? What did Miaomiao do?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026She asked the Taoist master to help her with housework\u2026\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cThat\u2019s all? Miaomiao is so tired from playing the game the day before yesterday, and she is still injured. What\u2019s wrong with Xie Jingyuan doing some housework? This is worth breaking up with, and you want Miaomiao to apologize?\u201d\nChen Ling and Zhu Xingzhu both stood up for Su Miaomiao, so Gu Jialing ran away with his plate.\nNot even eating enough, Gu Jialing, aggrieved, cycled around a long way and went to look for Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan was already studying in the teaching building, so he came to the corridor to meet Gu Jialing.\nThe two stood in an empty corner, Gu Jialing wiped his sweat and said: \u201cSu Miaomiao\u2019s roommates are too fierce, I just want her to come and apologize to you, and they scolded me!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan frowned and said, \u201cWho asked you to talk about this?\u201d\nHe thought that Gu Jialing was just going to help her.\nGu Jialing: \u201cShe made you angry, what\u2019s wrong if I ask her to come over and apologize?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d\nShe did nothing wrong.\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cThen you are sullen? Don\u2019t you care about her?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt has nothing to do with you, anyway, I don\u2019t need her to apologize.\u201d\nGu Jialing felt wronged and confused.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him and said, \u201cShe finishes training at six in the afternoon. You pick her up at the gymnasium and accompany her to the cafeteria for a meal. After which, she wants to study by herself, so you accompany her to the study room, library or go home. In short, don\u2019t let her be alone unless she wants to go back to the dormitory.\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, Xie Jingyuan turned around and returned to the classroom.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhat did he mean? The Taoist master didn\u2019t care about the cat anymore, but he wanted him to do that to him?\nHe didn\u2019t understand, but at six o\u2019clock in the evening, Gu Jialing rode a bicycle to wait outside the gymnasium on time.\nWhen Su Miaomiao came out and saw him, her eyes lit up.\nSister Fang asked strangely, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Jing Yuan come?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cWe broke up.\u201d\nSister Fang: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was hungry, so she ran to jump into the back seat of Gu Jialing\u2019s bicycle, and urged him to go to the cafeteria. When she left, she waved to Sister Fang who was stunned.\nSister Fang had been with Su Miaomiao for so long, and was more familiar with the relationship between the two children than Zhao Lu. She couldn\u2019t believe it, and took out her phone to call Xie Jingyuan.\n\u201cJing Yuan, Miaomiao said you two broke up, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan parked his bicycle on the side of the road, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, you don\u2019t have to think about it.\u201d\nIt was not good for outsiders to interfere too much in emotional matters, especially when facing a taciturn person like Xie Jingyuan.\nSister Fang: \u201cThen, Miaomiao\u2019s morning exercise\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI will continue to play with her.\u201d\nSister Fang vaguely understood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She knew how to.\nAfter drying the clothes, Su Miaomiao turned her phone to silent and got into bed to sleep.\nAfter evening class, Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou met at the gate and went back to the lakeside community together.\nEntering the elevator, exiting the elevator, and passing the door of 802, Xie Jingyuan glanced at the door panel over there.\nIn the living room of 801, Gu Jialing was learning opera from the Opera masters on TV.\nXu Shou asked him, \u201cWhere\u2019s Su Miaomiao?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cI dropped her home.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cDid she come here or not?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was no longer attached to the Taoist master, and Gu Jialing made people feel uneasy. Xu Shou needed to make sure that Su Miaomiao was already in 802 at that time, instead of wandering outside alone. What if someone deceived her?\nGu Jialing paused the show, stared at him and said, \u201cWhere could she be if she\u2019s not at home? Anyway, I sent her home according to the Taoist master\u2019s order. As for whether she went out by herself, I don\u2019t leave a single eye in the corridor. How should I know?\u201d\nThe Taoist master was fierce to him, but the dog was also fierce to him, so who had he provoked?\nXu Shou looked at the Taoist master.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cCall.\u201d\nXu Shou made three phone calls in a row, but no one answered.\nGu Jialing: \u201cHas she gone to sleep?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cGo and have a look.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe went out the door in his slippers, and then went to ring 802\u2019s doorbell.\nAlthough Su Miaomiao slept soundly, she woke up when the doorbell rang, rubbed her eyes, and walked all the way to the entrance without turning on the light.\nOpening the door, the light from the corridor came in. Su Miaomiao subconsciously covered her eyes with her hands, and said in disgust, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at her messy hair, looked at her pajamas, and hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Xu Shou and the Taoist master were worried about whether you were at home or not, and told me to take a look.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao closed the door with a \u201cbang\u201d.\nXu Shou and Xie Jingyuan, who heard that conversation, went back to their rooms respectively.\nGu Jialing wanted to complain that the two were worrying about nothing, but as soon as he came in, they disappeared.\nOn Tuesday, Su Miaomiao had no class in the afternoon and needed training, so she went back to the dormitory to rest at noon.\nThe three roommates gossiped, \u201cDid Xie Jingyuan take the initiative to contact you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head.\nZhao Lu: \u201cYou two live next door, haven\u2019t you met each other until now?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cHe still plays tennis with me in the morning, but he doesn\u2019t talk or look at me.\u201d\nZhao Lu smiled: \u201cHe\u2019s still playing, that means he already knows he\u2019s wrong, he just can\u2019t let go of his ego, and he\u2019s waiting for you to take the initiative to coax him.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao knew that they had misunderstood, and explained, \u201cThe Taoist master didn\u2019t make a mistake, he just doesn\u2019t want to take care of me anymore.\u201d\nChen Ling frowned, \u201cWhat does this mean? He is your boyfriend, so who would take care of you if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d\nIt was fine if he didn\u2019t do housework, it didn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t drop Su Miaomiao at the door of the classroom, but he didn\u2019t even eat with her? If one didn\u2019t have that kind of companion, what kind of relationship was there?\nThe three roommates couldn\u2019t figure out Xie Jingyuan\u2019s complicated thoughts.\nSu Miaomiao was the only one who knew the truth. The Taoist master was not her boyfriend, so of course he didn\u2019t need to take care of her.\n\u201cStop talking, I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao got into bed skillfully.\nThe three roommates looked at each other.\nSome girls would be in pain when they lose their love. She said that she wanted to sleep, but they guessed she would just want to lay on the bed silently in sadness. But Su Miaomiao slept with her face outward, her brows were stretched and her face was ruddy. Who would believe that she was sad?\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cVery good, no matter what Xie Jingyuan thinks, the most important thing is for Miaomiao to continue eating and sleeping well!\u201d\nZhao Lu and Chen Ling nodded one after another.\nZhao Lu: \u201cGirls should put their studies and career first. Having a happy relationship is the icing on the cake. It\u2019s not a loss if you don\u2019t have it!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t know that she had become a role model in every aspect in the minds of her roommates. As soon as the alarm clock rang, she got up and walked to the gymnasium.\nAfter training all afternoon, Gu Jialing came to pick her up in the evening.\nAfter five days of classes like that, Su Miaomiao either followed her roommate, or Gu Jialing accompanied her to dinner and then sent her back to the lakeside community, but she never placed an order.\nSu Miaomiao was taken to the tennis center by Sister Fang for training on Saturday morning, and she was sent back at 5:00 pm.\nShe didn\u2019t pay attention at ordinary times, but when she entered the door that time, Su Miaomiao suddenly found that several pots of plants in the house were yellow.\nShe liked wildflowers and weeds in the woods, but was not interested in growing flowers by herself.\nThinking of something, Su Miaomiao found the phone number of the housekeeping aunt left by her father and asked her to come to clean the house.\nIt was okay to hang clothes, but she wouldn\u2019t do other troublesome housework.\nThe housekeeping aunt came. She was a kind-looking person in her forties.\nWhen she was waiting for the elevator with cleaning tools, she met Xie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing.\nXu Shou carried two shopping bags in his hand, which contained ingredients such as vegetables, fish and shrimp, and Gu Jialing carried a bag of quick-frozen food, including ice cream.\nThe three college students were so handsome, making the housekeeping aunt secretly watch them a few times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She took the aunt into 802 first, before closing the door, and running over like a hurricane.\nIt was related to Su Miaomiao\u2019s safety, even if the housekeeping aunt was a woman, Gu Jialing wanted to come over and watch her.\nSu Miaomiao told the housekeeping aunt where to clean, and finally pointed to those yellow plants and said, \u201cThrow them all away.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity to lose such good flower pots. I don\u2019t think the plants are completely dead. Maybe they could turn green again with some water.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m too lazy to pour water, you can keep it.\u201d\nThe housekeeping aunt didn\u2019t grow flowers either.\nGu Jialing said pleasantly, \u201cHere, we are short of a few pots of plants.\u201d\nAfter confirming that Su Miaomiao really didn\u2019t want them anymore, Gu Jialing happily started moving them to his apartment.\nXie Jingyuan came out of the kitchen and frowned when he saw those yellow and wilting plants.\nThe fish soup was still simmering, but it should be ready to drink when everyone finished eating.\nThe three college students were all over 185 cm and ate a lot. Su Miaomiao exercised every day and could eat two bowls of rice.\nXu Shou found out when he was shopping for vegetables in the supermarket that the Taoist master bought Su Miaomiao\u2019s favorite fish and shrimp. When the Taoist master put the rice in the rice cooker, he also secretly noticed it, and confirmed that he cooked the meal for four people.\u00a0\nHe knew that the Taoist master had a cold face and a warm heart. He just didn\u2019t want to help Su Miaomiao with those trivial things anymore, and it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care about her.\nTo be conservative, Xu Shou still consulted the Taoist master first.\nThe housekeeper continued to clean, and Su Miaomiao followed Xu Shou to 802.\nOn the rectangular dining table, Xie Jingyuan used to sit next to Su Miaomiao. But when she came over, she happened to see Xie Jingyuan put his bowl and chopsticks on Xu Shou\u2019s side.\n\u201cThe dishes are all ready, come and eat,\u201d Gu Jialing held a plate of braised fish with a smile on his face.\nAlthough the food in the canteen was good, it was still not as good as the Taoist master\u2019s cooking.\nThe Taoist master was also a real chef. He didn\u2019t eat meat, but he cooked all kinds of meat dishes with good taste.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s stomach was already growling. She washed her hands, and sat in her old seat, except that Gu Jialing was next to her, and Xie Jingyuan was on the opposite side.\nGu Jialing talked to her while eating, \u201cIs it worth calling a housekeeper for your small apartment? You don\u2019t cook, but can\u2019t you just wipe the table and mop the floor?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI don\u2019t like doing it, mind your own business.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t care. Anyway, you have money. By the way, how much does it take to call the auntie once?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThree hundred yuan, it\u2019s cheaper during the day, this time it\u2019s a night bill.\u201d\nXu Shou glanced over silently. If it wasn\u2019t for Su Miaomiao who always disliked him, he didn\u2019t need three hundred, he could help her clean for two hundred.\nGu Jialing tried to ease the atmosphere, so he deliberately joked, \u201cThe Taoist master cleaned it for you a few times, shouldn\u2019t you give the money to him?\u201d\nIt was just that those words were unknown if they were spoken to Su Miaomiao or himself.\nIn fact, she really wanted to go to university with the Taoist master like before, and then come back with him. She wanted to sit in the back seat of the Taoist master\u2019s bicycle with her arms around his waist.\nShe liked the smell of the Taoist master, liked the various things he did for her, and also liked the dishes that he cooked.\nBut the Taoist master didn\u2019t want to care about her anymore, and didn\u2019t even talk to her.\nThe fish in the bowl didn\u2019t seem so tasty anymore.\nHowever, thinking that next time he might not even ask her to come over to eat fish, Su Miaomiao began to eat again.\nWhen she was full, Su Miaomiao was ready to leave, but Gu Jialing stopped her, \u201cHey, I won\u2019t clean your dishes.\u201d\nIn the past, the Taoist master took over Su Miaomiao\u2019s bowls and chopsticks, but when he didn\u2019t care, and Xu Shou wouldn\u2019t touch Su Miaomiao\u2019s things all the time, did she want him to do it?\u00a0\nGu Jialing wanted to fight for bird rights for himself, so he wouldn\u2019t be suppressed by Su Miaomiao all the time.\nSu Miaomiao had never washed dishes since she was a child.\nShe subconsciously looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nJust when she remembered that the Taoist master would no longer help her, and when Xu Shou and Gu Jialing thought that the Taoist master would refuse, he stood up expressionlessly and took away Su Miaomiao\u2019s bowl and chopsticks.\nSu Miaomiao watched him walk into the kitchen in surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a result, even when Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t say anything, he still actually helped her.\nWasn\u2019t she just a cat?\nThey heard the sound of water in the kitchen, and not long after, Xie Jingyuan came out again holding Su Miaomiao\u2019s bowl, which contained thick milky crucian carp soup.\n\u201cGrandma called in the morning and asked me to make soup for you to nourish your body.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan put the fish soup in front of Su Miaomiao, and then sat back in his seat.\nSu Miaomiao understood, sat down again, and scooped up the soup with a spoon.\nXu Shou reminded her, \u201cIt\u2019s just out of the pan, be careful not to burn your tongue.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao grew up drinking fish soup, and she could tell whether the temperature was burning her mouth by the heat wafting from the soup bowl.\nGlancing at Xu Shou suspiciously, Su Miaomiao lowered her head and tried to lick the soup in the spoon.\nIt was slightly hot, which was the right temperament.\nShe completely ignored Xu Shou\u2019s words and drank with relish.\nGu Jialing was so greedy. He also ran to the kitchen to scoop up the soup, but the gas stove had just turned off, so let alone the soup, the heat from the pot when he lifted the lid made him gasp.\nGu Jialing suddenly understood something, and shouted, \u201cTaoist Master, you used a spell to cool hers down, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao raised her head again.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her, and said calmly, \u201cYou have a lot of valuables over there, finish your drink early and go back to look at them.\u201d\nOnly then did Su Miaomiao understand the meticulousness of the Taoist master.\nAfter drinking the soup, she hurried back, and she forgot to wash the dishes. Gu Jialing didn\u2019t remind her anymore, anyway, someone was biased.\nThe three of them worked together to clean up the kitchen.\nGu Jialing took the water with a cup, hummed a ditty while watering the plants he had just brought back, and whispered something to those wilting yellow plants while watering.\nXu Shou vaguely heard words such as \u201ccome alive\u201d and \u201csing to you\u201d, and went to the room to read a book speechlessly.\nXie Jingyuan walked to a pot of green plants.\nGu Jialing quickly explained, \u201cTaoist Master, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t want this. If I didn\u2019t move it here, she would have thrown it away.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t respond, and only touched a leaf with his fingertips.\nGu Jialing was about to continue watering, but when he saw the potted plant turn green at a speed visible to the naked eye, his eyes widened.\nXie Jingyuan injected spiritual power into each pot of green plants in turn.\nThe green plants had regained their vitality, but the soil in the pots was still dry.\nXie Jingyuan took the cup from the dumbfounded Gu Jialing and finished the watering work for him.\n\u201cTaoist Master, your spell is too powerful, isn\u2019t it possible that even a dead person could be brought back to life?\u201d Gu Jialing said in admiration.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThis is the simplest plant nourishment technique. Taking care of this ordinary small plant is fine but my power is useless to humans.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cWhat about the birds?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cBirds are plants?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the door and said, \u201cWhen the housekeeping aunt leaves, you can move them back.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cShe didn\u2019t want them herself, I\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t listen to his explanation and went back to the room.\nGu Jialing was heartbroken, he had taken care of Su Miaomiao many times that week, had finally had the opportunity to take advantage of it, but was disturbed by the Taoist master.\nLooking at those shiny green leaves, Gu Jialing even felt a sense of pity for reckless abandonment.\nSu Miaomiao was just a cat. How could he expect her to take care of the plants?\nGu Jialing went to Xu Shou to reason, hoping that he could help him persuade the Taoist master to change his decision.\nXu Shou: \u201cThe cat dad bought it, and the Taoist master rescued it. What does it have to do with you?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cI moved them here!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThen you move them back.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAggrieved, he went back to the living room and deliberately turned up the volume of the TV. Later, worried about disturbing the neighbors upstairs and downstairs, he hurriedly restored the volume to normal.\nAt nine o\u2019clock in the evening, the housekeeper took her wage and left with a smile.\nGu Jialing pushed open the door and looked at Su Miaomiao who was about to enter.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cThe Taoist master saved all your plants, do you want them anymore? Don\u2019t tell him yourself, lest he think that I insisted on stealing your things.\u201d\nSaved?\nSu Miaomiao passed Gu Jialing curiously, and was still in the entrance, and saw those pots of green plants, some of which had flower buds.\nShe just didn\u2019t like to take care of plants, but if there were ready-made good plants for her, how could she not like it?\n\u201cThe Taoist master is really powerful,\u201d Su Miaomiao said in admiration, and then began to move back the green plants.\nGu Jialing gritted his teeth, and finally helped her move them.\nWhen all the green plants were placed back to their original positions, Su Miaomiao looked at the newly cleaned house again, and her mood became very good.\nShe took a picture of it and sent it to Xie Jingyuan: Thank you, Taoist Master.\nA minute later, Xie Jingyuan replied: Remember to water regularly.\nSu Miaomiao: Okay.\nBut Xie Jingyuan thought she would definitely forget.\nOn Sunday night, Su Miaomiao drank the fish soup stewed by Xie Jingyuan again.\nShe also found that the Taoist master\u2019s face was not cold, and it became the same as before. Although there was no expression, it was not too scary.\nHowever, on Monday morning, the only one waiting in the corridor was Gu Jialing who wanted to take her to school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She would pick a tree and curl up in a ball until the sun moved away.\nWith a sound of \u201cbang\u201d, the ball hit the ground and bounced high.\nOn the opposite side of the court, Xie Jingyuan said indifferently, \u201cDon\u2019t be distracted.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t dare to be distracted anymore, and continued to just stare at the little ball.\nNo matter how low the temperature got, a person would sweat when they played. Su Miaomiao went to take a shower and change clothes, and her movements were much faster than before. Otherwise, she would be late if she walked to the cafeteria and then to the teaching building.\nTo her surprise, this time when she came out after changing her clothes, she found that Xie Jingyuan was still waiting outside.\nSeeing her, Xie Jingyuan explained, \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten yet, let\u2019s go together.\u201d\nThe sun was much brighter than half an hour ago, and it made her smile even brighter.\nHe stepped onto the bicycle first, and then Su Miaomiao jumped up skillfully, but just as her hand touched his waist, Xie Jingyuan suddenly turned around.\nHe didn\u2019t say anything, but Su Miaomiao understood what he meant, and retracted her hand embarrassingly.\nHe had breakfast with her, and then sent her downstairs to the teaching building.\n\u201cThank you, Taoist Master,\u201d Su Miaomiao glanced at him when she took her bag and said politely.\nIn the past, the Taoist master took care of her every day, and she was used to it, so she never thought of thanking him.\nIt was different then, the Taoist master said he would ignore her, but helped out occasionally, of course Su Miaomiao must be polite.\nThat was what the Taoist master emphasized countless times when she was a child, so she remembered to thank her classmates for helping her.\nSu Miaomiao also climbed the stairs and walked to her classroom.\nIn the mornings of the next three days, Xie Jingyuan did not accompany Su Miaomiao to the cafeteria, nor did he appear in the afternoon or evening.\nFrom being unaccustomed to Su Miaomiao at the beginning, it had also become a habit.\nOn Friday morning, Su Miaomiao only had the first and second classes, which were two professional classes, and the students listened very carefully.\nIn the middle of the second class, some raindrops hit the glass windows.\nSu Miaomiao was distracted by the sound, turned her head, and saw more fine and dense raindrops falling, and the rain in the distance also became heavier.\n\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t bring an umbrella!\u201d\n\u201cI brought one. I checked the weather forecast in the morning and it said that it\u2019s going to rain today.\u201d\nFrom Dormitory 403, Zhao Lu didn\u2019t bring an umbrella, but Chen Ling and Zhu Xingzhu did.\n\u201cLet\u2019s share,\u201d Chen Ling said with a smile.\nZhao Lu breathed a sigh of relief and continued to listen.\nSu Miaomiao was still looking out the window.\nShe liked sunny days, but she hated rain the most. She hated getting wet and getting mud on her beautiful shoes.\nWhen it rained for the first time when she was still in kindergarten, she didn\u2019t even have to walk the distance from the classroom to the school gate by herself.\nThe Taoist master would carry her on his back.\nFrom kindergarten to high school, the Taoist master never did let her shoes get wet even once.\nWhen class was over, because the remaining two classes were empty, Zhao Lu and the others had to go back to the dormitory, so they called Su Miaomiao to go with them.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cYou go first, I\u2019m waiting for the Taoist master to pick me up.\u201d\nZhao Lu and the others thought that Xie Jingyuan had contacted Su Miaomiao first, and that the couple who had been in a cold war for almost two weeks was finally reconciled.\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask you the details later!\u201d\nThe three girls walked out of the classroom smiling.\nSu Miaomiao then took out her phone and sent a message to Xie Jingyuan: It\u2019s raining. Taoist Master, come here to pick me up.\nXie Jingyuan was standing on the back side of the teaching building where Su Miaomiao was, standing in a corner that could not be seen by the college students who kept walking out of the building.\nHe also had class, but he left the classroom three minutes early and ran there with an umbrella.\nIt was raining heavily, and it was inconvenient to ride a bicycle, and there was no need to ride a bicycle, because it would be useless there.\nShe hated rain the most, she could do other things by herself, but that was definitely not the case.\nIf she didn\u2019t take the initiative to contact him even when it was raining, then in her heart, he wouldn\u2019t even be a \u201cTaoist master\u201d.\nThe phone was always held in his hand. In vibration mode, when the message arrived, the screen lit up first.\nXie Jingyuan paused, and then replied: I\u2019m busy.\nHe wondered if she would be as clingy as before, or if she would be as polite to him as she was that morning.\nUpstairs, in the classroom.\nSeeing Xie Jingyuan\u2019s reply, Su Miaomiao pouted, and was about to ask him what he was up to. But at the door of the classroom, a boy who had already sneaked a few glances at Su Miaomiao finally plucked up his courage and asked, \u201cSu Miaomiao, don\u2019t you have an umbrella?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There was no pleasant smell, but it was not unpleasant.\nThe Taoist master didn\u2019t send any new messages, so Su Miaomiao thought of the Taoist master\u2019s indifference in the past two weeks, and guessed that he really didn\u2019t care about her, even the rain was no exception.\n\u201cCan you carry me back? I don\u2019t want to get my shoes dirty.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stretched out her feet to show the male classmate the white shoes on her feet.\nStudents watching the excitement: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe male classmate who recommended himself: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe blushed even more.\nFor a girl as beautiful as Su Miaomiao, a girl like a princess, being able to carry her on his back once was simply a reward for him. Usually, he was the only one who dared not dream, so if Su Miaomiao asked for it, he would not foolishly refuse.\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d the male classmate stammered.\nSu Miaomiao was very happy. The Taoist master didn\u2019t care about her, but there were others to help. Although there were bad people in human beings, there were also many good people.\nThinking of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cold face, Su Miaomiao sent him another message: It\u2019s okay, there is a classmate who is willing to send me back to the dormitory. Taoist Master, you can continue your work.\nAfter sending that, Su Miaomiao put her phone in her bag, raised her head and said to the kind-hearted male classmate, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nThe male student was dizzy, and walked out of the classroom.\nSu Miaomiao followed him, going down the stairs on the third floor, turning downstairs,\u00a0\nWhen she settled on the landing at the corner, she stared blankly at a person.\u00a0\nXie Jingyuan raised his head, his eyes quickly moved away from her face, and fell on the enthusiastic male classmate.\nMale classmate: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe knew that Su Miaomiao used to have a boyfriend, a boyfriend who was still the prodigy in Beijing University that year, with a high IQ.\nBut that boyfriend had not shown up for two consecutive weeks.\nIt didn\u2019t matter whether he showed up or not, the male student didn\u2019t mean to pursue Su Miaomiao, not only him, but other male students in the class didn\u2019t have that courage.\nThe male classmate could swear that he really just wanted to send Su Miaomiao to her dormitory. It was raining so heavily outside, it was pitiful for her to go out without an umbrella.\nHis thoughts were simple, so why did the genius look at him that way?\nNoticing that Xie Jingyuan was also holding an umbrella in his hand, the male classmate said nervously to Su Miaomiao, \u201cYou, your boyfriend is here, then I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, the male student wished he could step down the twelve steps and leave quickly.\nXie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t stare at the other party all the time, so he looked away, then looked at Su Miaomiao. He walked to the side of the stairs and waited for her.\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you busy?\u201d Su Miaomiao was a little confused, so she came down and asked.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d\nWith that said, he opened the umbrella and handed it to Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao took it over, watched Xie Jingyuan squat down with his back to her, and she lay on his back habitually.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t give her another chance to ask, strode out of the teaching building, and walked into the increasingly heavy rain.\nSu Miaomiao clasped his shoulder with one hand and held the umbrella with the other. The umbrella surface could protect their upper body from the rain, including Su Miaomiao\u2019s pair of white shoes that swayed regularly with Xie Jingyuan\u2019s footsteps.\nXie Jingyuan walked silently.\nSu Miaomiao looked at his cold face from the side and was also thinking about something.\nThere were bicycles passing by constantly, and the wheels rolled and splashed water.\nXie Jingyuan chose the most secluded path.\nAfter an unknown amount of time, he finally stopped and asked her, \u201cZhao Lu and the others hadn\u2019t brought umbrellas?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201d Lingling and Zhuzhu brought it.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you go back to the dormitory with them?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThey are not as tall as me, they can\u2019t carry me on their backs.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan tilted his head and looked into her eyes, \u201cSo, were you going to let that male classmate carry you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao saw that he was unhappy, and explained, \u201cIt was what he wanted, I did not bully him.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIf he wants, you could let him carry you? Are you not afraid of being misunderstood as lovers?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao avoided his gaze, tilted her head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine even if it causes misunderstanding. Anyway, you don\u2019t care about me. I\u2019m single now, so it\u2019s not cheating.\u201d\nBecause she spent more time with her roommates, Su Miaomiao also learned a lot of new vocabulary.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo, if he pursues you, will you agree to have a relationship with him?\u201d He asked as calmly as possible.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay with him every day, I just asked him to carry me once.\u201d\nXu Shou said that to fall in love was to love someone, and to love someone was to want to be with them every day and only with them.\n\u201cSince you don\u2019t want to fall in love with him, don\u2019t do things that are easy to misunderstand.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao muttered softly, \u201cWho told you not to come pick me up?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her dangling little white shoes, and said after a few seconds, \u201cI\u2019m busy, so I came over after I was done.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao recalled the doubt, looked back at the teaching building in the distance, and asked strangely, \u201cIt\u2019s so far, can you fly?\u201d\nUnless he used a spell, the Taoist master couldn\u2019t be so fast even if he rode a bicycle.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI can\u2019t fly, I\u2019m just faster.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When she opened the door, she was still smiling.\nZhao Lu: \u201cHey, you\u2019ve reconciled for sure! Is that why you\u2019re smiling so sweetly?\u201d\nChen Ling walked in from the balcony and asked strangely, \u201cWhich way did you two come from? We wanted to see.\u201d\nThe three of them took turns watching on the balcony for several minutes, but they didn\u2019t see Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan.\nChen Ling: \u201cImpossible, I\u2019ve been watching this place, what color is Xie Jingyuan\u2019s umbrella?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cBlack.\u201d\nChen Ling remembered that a black umbrella had indeed walked past, and came back not long after.\nZhao Lu suddenly noticed that Su Miaomiao\u2019s shoes were not wet at all, and when she contacted Chen Ling again, she said in shock, \u201cNo way, Xie Jingyuan carried you back?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like rain, so the Taoist master carries me home every time it rains.\u201d\nThe three roommates were speechless.\nA childhood sweetheart was enough to make people envious, but such childhood sweethearts were simply a couple of Gods!\n\u201cOkay, we don\u2019t have to go to the cafeteria at noon, my stomach is already full with the dog food.\u201d Zhao Lu leaned back in the chair with blank eyes, and muttered to the ceiling, \u201cWhen will the love of the Gods come to me?\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cLove is impossible. If you want dog food, I can buy a pack and sprinkle it over.\u201d\nThey were just joking. The three girls surrounded Su Miaomiao, wanting to know the details of the young couple\u2019s reconciliation, \u201cTell us, how did Xie Jingyuan coax you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t think she had quarreled with the Taoist master, but explaining would be troublesome, so she thought for a while and said, \u201cHe cooked fish soup for me.\u201d\n\u201cJust a bowl of fish soup?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThe fish soup the Taoist master made was very delicious.\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cWell, that\u2019s actually not bad. Cooking skills are an advantage that could last a lifetime, and it is rarer than good looks.\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cNot just cooking skills, Xie Jingyuan can conquer me with his face.\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cI don\u2019t need a face. The figure of him straddling a bicycle waiting for Miaomiao downstairs has already made me intoxicated. None of the male protagonists in the comics are as handsome as him.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nBut the Taoist master was indeed the best-looking among human men.\nZhao Lu: \u201cHey, hey, both of you restrain yourself, Miaomiao is still here. Don\u2019t worry Miaomiao, I don\u2019t like your Taoist master, tell me about Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, are they single? What kind of girl are they interested in?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cXu Shou will definitely not fall in love. Gu Jialing likes a girl with natural blue hair.\u201d\nHer roommates: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAt noon, since Su Miaomiao had a boyfriend to accompany her for lunch, her three roommates went to the cafeteria in advance.\nThey rushed there before other college students finished their classes, and when they finished eating and walked out, they saw Xie Jingyuan, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing.\nWhen the two sides met each other, Zhao Lu asked Xie Jingyuan suspiciously, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat with Miaomiao?\u201d\nGu Jialing said sourly, \u201cWhat do you know? Su Miaomiao doesn\u2019t like rain, so the Taoist master is going to pack it up and send it to her!\u201d\nHe also didn\u2019t like the rain, but he didn\u2019t get any special treatment.\nNo! What about the equality of all beings? In the eyes of humans, birds were not as good as cats!\nGu Jialing went in angrily.\nXie Jingyuan nodded toward the three girls, and walked away with Xu Shou.\nZhao Lu and the others: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nDog food, dog food was there again!\nTen minutes later, Su Miaomiao took the packed canteen food from Xie Jingyuan to the dormitory to eat.\nThe roommates made fun of her again.\nSu Miaomiao concentrated on eating, cleaned up the lunch boxes and other garbage after eating, and then went to the bathroom to wash her face.\n\u201cAre you going to the classroom now?\u201d Seeing Su Miaomiao picking up her bag, Zhao Lu asked casually.\nChen Ling: \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, we go to the classroom early to study, and others go to the classroom early for a date!\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao walked out of the dormitory, the three girls gathered on the balcony again.\nThe weather forecast said there would be showers, and the rain was much lighter than in the morning, and it was estimated that it would stop soon.\nSoon, they saw Xie Jingyuan turning around from the corner of the dormitory building with Su Miaomiao on his back, but the umbrella she was holding was too big, covering only Xie Jingyuan\u2019s long legs.\nWhen the two passed directly under the dormitory building, Su Miaomiao heard coughing and laughter from the roommates on purpose.\nShe looked up, and Xie Jingyuan also looked up.\nThe three laughed and waved at them.\nBecause the sky was still raining, Su Miaomiao raised her umbrella again.\nXie Jingyuan took a few steps forward and asked her, \u201cYou told them that we broke up, so how did you explain it now?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThere is no need to explain, they misunderstood that we reconciled again.\u201d\nShe leaned on his shoulder and said it face to face.\nXie Jingyuan looked over and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t quarrel with you, nor was I angry with you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Su Miaomiao talked endlessly from the dormitory to the teaching building, and she even talked about the kindergarten class.\nXie Jingyuan started to climb the stairs with her behind his back, his tone was very calm, \u201cIf I\u2019m so fierce, then why did you still misunderstand that I regard you as the owner?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shrunk her head guiltily, turned the back of her head to him again, and muttered, \u201cNo matter what, who told you to always be nice to me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cBeing kind to you doesn\u2019t mean treating you like a cat\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI know, I know, it\u2019s because I\u2019m too lazy!\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t want to hear him yelling at her again, grabbed her bag, jumped off his back, and ran away by herself.\nXie Jingyuan stood in the middle of the stairs, watching her back. After a while, he shook his head, and then continued to walk up.\nSu Miaomiao just sat down in her seat when she saw the classroom door was pushed open and Xie Jingyuan walked in.\nShe looked at him puzzled.\n\u201cI\u2019m studying here,\u201d Xie Jingyuan only said that sentence, and then took out a medical book that looked very complicated from his bag.\nOnce he started reading, he would concentrate on it. Before going to kindergarten, no matter how Su Miaomiao made trouble around him, he would remain indifferent.\nThe current Su Miaomiao would not do such boring things, she would just lie down quietly and sleep next to him.\nAt 1:15, after almost all the students in Su Miaomiao\u2019s class arrived, Xie Jingyuan packed his stuff and stood up.\nBefore walking out of the classroom, he looked at the enthusiastic male classmate who wanted to send Su Miaomiao back to the dormitory in the morning.\nThe male classmate: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWas he wrong?\nThat night, Su Miaomiao trained at the Beijing University Gymnasium until nine o\u2019clock in the evening. After the training was over, it was Xie Jingyuan who came to pick her up.\nSister Fang breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that the two of them had finally reconciled.\nThe rain had stopped long ago, but the ground was still wet. Xie Jingyuan parked his bicycle in a dry place, and Su Miaomiao directly sat on the back seat of the bicycle there.\nAt that time, the campus was much quieter than during the day, and only occasionally some students could be heard talking and laughing.\nSu Miaomiao looked at the Taoist master who was close in front of her, and at the familiar waist and back.\nShe tried to lean forward again.\nAt the moment of touching, she could feel the tense muscles of the Taoist master\u2019s waist and back, and her heart also tightened, but he didn\u2019t scold her.\n\u201cTaoist Master, are you going to scold me again?\u201d Su Miaomiao guessed.\nXie Jingyuan was silent for a long time before asking, \u201cDo you still treat me as a cat slave?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head repeatedly, \u201cYou\u2019re not a cat slave, you\u2019re the Taoist master.\u201d\nHow could there be such a cruel and ruthless cat slave? The cat slave treated cats well.\nXie Jingyuan did not formally answer her question, but only asked her what she would like to eat next morning.\nSu Miaomiao was not stupid, she understood that he was acquiescing, and immediately said, \u201cI want to eat fish ball noodles and fish soup!\u201d\nThe stars twinkled in the sky, Xie Jingyuan said yes in a low voice.\nWhat was promised would naturally be done. On Saturday morning, Xie Jingyuan got up before Xu Shou again.\nXu Shou got up immediately, making sure that the Taoist master was going to prepare breakfast, and he wanted to help with the grocery shopping.\nXie Jingyuan asked him to go back to catch up on sleep, and went to the vegetable market by himself.\nBy bicycle, it would take five or six minutes to arrive at the nearby vegetable market. Some old men and women who got up early had already begun to pick and choose in front of various stalls.\nXie Jingyuan bought a big carp, and later made the freshest fish balls for her, and crucian carp to make soup.\nLakeside Community, 801.\nGu Jialing originally wanted to sleep late, but was woken up by the sound of the cooking and stirring. He came out rubbing his eyes, and saw the back of the Taoist master standing busy in the kitchen, and there was a lingering fishy smell in the air.\nGu Jialing liked to eat fish, but he couldn\u2019t stand the smell, so he quickly opened the windows.\nWhen he came to the kitchen, he looked here and there, and hummed, \u201cAre you making fish ball noodles for her?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019ll eat by myself.\u201d\nGu Jialing laughed, and took that as a joke.\nBefore he finished cooking, Xie Jingyuan asked Gu Jialing to call Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao was going to practice at the tennis center on weekends and got up early. When Gu Jialing knocked on the door, she was washing her face.\n\u201cDid you reconcile with the Taoist master?\u201d Gu Jialing asked, \u201cHow did you reconcile?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Looking at the counter, they saw four large bowls, and each bowl contained almost identical fish ball noodles.\nGu Jialing hummed first, pointed to the bowl with the most fish balls and said, \u201cThis bowl must be for Su Miaomiao, right?\u201d\nXu Shou glared at him.\nAt that time, even Xu Shou didn\u2019t notice anything wrong.\nWhen the four bowls of noodles were all set on the dining table, and Xie Jingyuan was sitting next to Su Miaomiao, holding a fish ball with chopsticks to eat, Xu Shou was stunned, \u201cMaster, you\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao and Gu Jialing looked up at the same time, and they were also dumbfounded when they saw the fish balls in front of Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan looked as usual, and said indifferently, \u201cActually, the patriarch of Qingxu Temple did not avoid meat and vegetables, and even allowed the Taoist masters in the temple to marry and have children. After some incidents, new rules for the temple were established.\u201d\nThe three demons: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe silence lasted until Xie Jingyuan ate a whole fish ball slowly.\nXu Shou finally found his voice, \u201cMaster, do you want to follow the patriarch?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWell, the patriarch came in my dream last night.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cSuch privileges make your life not so hard.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan agreed.\nGu Jialing was very moved, \u201cThe patriarch must have seen that we eat meat every day and only the Taoist master is a vegetarian, so he has been hurt!\u201d\nXu Shou thought of the past three years when they had dinner together, grilled fish, barbecued meat, hot pot and so on. They ate meat while the Taoist master could only eat vegetables, and he also thought that the patriarch was really good.\nBoth of them expressed their opinions, and Xie Jingyuan finally looked at Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao lowered her head guiltily.\nDid the patriarch of Qingxu Temple appear again?\nIn her previous life, she stole the offerings from the patriarch, did he see it?\n\u2014\nAfter a day of training in the tennis center, Sister Fang drove Su Miaomiao back to the lakeside community at around five o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\nThere was still some distance from the entrance of the community, and Sister Fang saw a familiar figure.\nThe slender and tall boy stood under a tree with his handsome face facing them. Although he was waiting for someone, he was not in a hurry.\nSister Fang smiled and said to the girl who was dozing in the back seat, \u201cMiaomiao, we\u2019re here.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao fell asleep quickly and woke up quickly. She rubbed her eyes and found that the car was parked at the gate of the community.\nShe grabbed her bag, said bye to Sister Fang, and got out of the car.\nAt that moment, she realized that Xie Jingyuan was waiting for her standing under a tree not far away.\nThat kind of scene was very familiar, but Xie Jingyuan ignored her for the past two weeks, so Su Miaomiao was stunned.\nXie Jingyuan had already walked to her side, and took her bag naturally.\nSu Miaomiao recalled the conversation the previous night and the fish soup in the morning, and the little strange feeling that just appeared disappeared completely.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ride the bicycle?\u201d She asked with some disappointment. It would take five or six minutes to walk from the gate of the community to the No. 7 building where they lived.\nAfter a day of training, Su Miaomiao just wanted to stay still, and do nothing.\n\u201cI will bring it tomorrow,\u201d Xie Jingyuan promised, and then took her to the supermarket next to the community.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go shopping, don\u2019t you want to replenish some daily necessities?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought about it, and found that she didn\u2019t lack anything. Her father had prepared enough for her before leaving, and it was just over a month ago.\nThere was nothing to buy, and when they entered the supermarket, Su Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan like a shadow.\nXie Jingyuan bought salt, vinegar and other condiments, walked around several rows of shelves, and stopped in front of a row of canned beers.\nAlthough the Taoist master said in the morning that he would respect the rules set by the patriarch of Qingxu Temple and no longer needed to be a vegetarian, seeing him buying beers with her own eyes still had a big impact on her.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her and said in a low voice, \u201cThe patriarch once called himself the Immortal of Wine.\u201d\nShe thought of the majestic statue of the patriarch, and remembered that there was indeed a gourd hanging on the patriarch. But she always thought that the gourd contained panacea, and only then did she realize that the gourd was used to hold wine.\n\u201cHowever, you should not drink too much. If you make a mistake because of getting drunk, you will be punished according to the discipline,\u201d Xie Jingyuan added.\nSu Miaomiao nodded, enough was enough, she understood.\nLeaving the supermarket, the two walked back along the relatively quiet path. Su Miaomiao smelled the faint smell of alcohol wafting out of the shopping bag, and imagined how the Taoist master would eat meat and drink. But she was still not used to it, so she said, \u201cTaoist Master, according to the rules of the patriarch, whoever the master of the temple is the one who revises the rules at the beginning, aren\u2019t you afraid that he will be angry with you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When she opened the door, Xie Jingyuan stood by and watched.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cLet me see if your plants are still alive.\u201d\nHe helped a few pots of green plants come back to life, and carefully wiped off the dust on the leaves.\nHaving planned to eat hot pot that night, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing went to the vegetable market to buy vegetables and hadn\u2019t come back yet. Taking advantage of that time, Xie Jingyuan cleaned up for Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao sat on the sofa, watching his busy figure, and the feeling of \u201cunaccustomed\u201d emerged again.\n\u201cMaster, actually you don\u2019t need to do these things, I can call the housekeeper over,\u201d Su Miaomiao said while looking at him and lifting her feet.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her, \u201cFor three hundred yuan?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s a little expensive, you can transfer me two hundred, don\u2019t give it to outsiders.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan continued mopping the floor.\nSu Miaomiao felt that it must not be a joke, so she picked up her phone and sent him a red envelope.\nFamiliar footsteps sounded in the corridor, and she went to open the door.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou looked at 802 at the same time, saw Su Miaomiao who was right in front of them, but Xie Jingyuan\u2019s hardworking back mopping the floor proficiently.\nXu Shou frowned, \u201cYou are bothering the Taoist master again.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao immediately raised her phone and showed them the red envelope she just sent, \u201cI paid for it, he said calling auntie is too expensive, and to just give him two hundred!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe also had the idea of \u200b\u200bcharging two hundred yuan to help Su Miaomiao clean up, but he didn\u2019t expect the Taoist master to do so.\nGu Jialing clicked his tongue and said, \u201cThe Taoist master is really diligent and thrifty in managing his money. You have saved tens of millions, and still need to earn such a small amount of money.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cYou should also learn a little bit, don\u2019t always gnaw at the old man.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cWho is too old? My grandfather has money and is willing to give it to me. You are just jealous of me!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan turned around and glanced at them.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou shut up at the same time, and went to 801 to prepare the ingredients for the hot pot.\nSu Miaomiao also followed, after all, watching the Taoist master clean up was not as fun as watching the food being prepared. In addition to various meat and vegetable ingredients, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou also bought fruits, such as apples and oranges.\nThere was also a box of strawberries. Gu Jialing wanted to hide it secretly, but was discovered by Su Miaomiao.\n\u201cI bought it out of my own pocket, if you want to eat it, buy it yourself!\u201d Gu Jialing held up the strawberry box and said to Su Miaomiao.\nIn 801, those ingredients and daily necessities usually were brought from the public funds. Just now they were shopping in the vegetable market, because the out-of-season strawberries were too expensive, Xu Shou did not approve of buying them, and he was not allowed to use public funds. Gu Jialing had no choice but to spend his pocket money.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t touch his hand, so she scratched Gu Jialing\u2019s waist that was exposed in front of her.\nGu Jialing fled around holding a strawberry box, and Su Miaomiao ran after him.\nXu Shou stood at the door of the kitchen, staring at Gu Jialing sharply. He had reason to suspect that Gu Jialing was not stingy with strawberries, but was just using the excuse to avoid labor in the kitchen.\nThe door was pushed open, and Xie Jingyuan walked in, just in time to see the scene where he was holding up the strawberries and Su Miaomiao hugging him with both hands.\nXie Jingyuan frowned.\nGu Jialing ran toward him, \u201cMaster, this is the strawberry I bought, you must uphold justice for me!\u201d After speaking, he quickly hid behind Xie Jingyuan.\nWith that pounce, Su Miaomiao landed firmly on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s body.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s eyebrows that had just been frowned quietly relaxed.\n\u201cStop making trouble,\u201d Xie Jingyuan grabbed her arm and wanted to reach for Gu Jialing.\nSu Miaomiao pouted to him, \u201cI want to eat strawberries.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019ll give you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stood up in satisfaction.\nXie Jingyuan stretched out his hand toward Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing snorted, \u201cI paid for it out of my own pocket. A strawberry costs ten yuan. If she eats a few, you have to pay it back to me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at the strawberry box, there were ten strawberries in total, such an order of fruit cost one hundred yuan. With Xu Shou\u2019s character, he would really be reluctant to buy it.\nHe took the strawberries to the kitchen, washed all ten of them, and put them on two plates, five on each side.\nBefore bringing it out, Xie Jingyuan gave one to Xu Shou.\nXu Shou was still washing vegetables, so he shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan directly stuffed the strawberry into his mouth.\nHe had nothing to repay, and washed the vegetables faster and worked harder.\nXie Jingyuan handed a plate to Gu Jialing and the other with the five strawberries to Su Miaomiao.\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes were sour, his heart was sour, and he took a bite of the strawberry bitterly. Oh, that strawberry was so sour!\n\u201cThe merchant is too black-hearted. These strawberries aren\u2019t ripened naturally!\u201d Gu Jialing vented his anger on the strawberry merchant.\nSu Miaomiao just took a bite of a strawberry, and said after eating, \u201cThis one is very sweet.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can\u2019t be biased like this!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cRipening can be done, fifteen yuan a piece.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe Taoist master took six strawberries from him in total, and he should be given sixty yuan. One ripened for fifteen yuan, and four strawberries were evenly matched.\nAfter finishing the calculation, Gu Jialing looked at the strawberry he just took a bite of in his hand, and hummed, \u201cThis one counts as twelve, Taoist Master, you still have to transfer me more than three yuan.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him, and touched the three strawberries on the plate one by one with his fingertips, regardless of the one in his hand.\nGu Jialing tentatively asked, \u201cThen you transfer me another ten yuan?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cRipen one for twenty.\u201d\nSeeing that Gu Jialing was staring at him, he just moved his plate to Su Miaomiao\u2019s side, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to eat them, I will give the plate to her. I will transfer you one hundred yuan, and the extra ten yuan could be counted as your errand expenses.\u201d\nWas Gu Jialing short of a hundred yuan?\nHe snatched the plate back and ate on the sofa.\nXie Jingyuan ignored him and looked at Su Miaomiao who was concentrating on eating strawberries.\nThe strawberries were bright red, and the juice moistened her lips.\nXie Jingyuan immediately looked away, and was about to leave when Su Miaomiao handed over a strawberry, \u201cThe Taoist master should eat one too, right?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s gaze fell on the strawberry, and then he noticed that her hand shrank back slightly.\nIt could be seen that the cat was hesitating, it all depended on whether he wanted it or not.\n\u201cEat it, I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up, and she immediately put the big red strawberry back on the plate.\nXie Jingyuan went to help Xu Shou prepare the ingredients.\nIt was late autumn, and the temperature in Beijing had already dropped below ten degrees. That kind of weather was the most suitable for having a hot pot.\nThe prepared hot pot ingredients were served one by one, and the last one was the three cans of beer that Xie Jingyuan took out from his shopping bag.\nGu Jialing expressed the same doubts as Su Miaomiao, \u201cThe patriarch also allows drinking?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao explained it to him.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing also quickly accepted the history of Qingxu.\nThe three boys each had a can of beer, while Su Miaomiao had a can of Coke.\nGu Jialing raised the beer to the middle, and said with pride, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s celebrate that our Taoist Master can finally drink and eat meat!\u201d\nXu Shou looked at the Taoist master, and also raised the beer.\nSu Miaomiao was not far behind.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her and clinked the cans cooperatively.\nOn the new Monday, Xie Jingyuan finally waited for Su Miaomiao in the corridor with Gu Jialing like two weeks ago.\nSu Miaomiao came out with her bag, and when she saw the three familiar people, the corners of her lips curled up.\nThe two walked in front, behind, Gu Jialing hugged Xu Shou\u2019s shoulders, and said with emotion, \u201cThis is the right way, we\u2019re like a family.\u201d\nXu Shou coldly pushed away his hand, including the heavy bag that Gu Jialing took the opportunity to take.\nThe group of four took the elevator downstairs, and when they got downstairs, the three boys went to pick up their bicycles.\nSu Miaomiao smiled and jumped into the back seat of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bicycle, instinctively wrapped her right hand around the familiar waist.\nThe three bicycles rode forward side by side. After Gu Jialing complained about the cold weather, Xie Jingyuan suddenly said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cNow you can still lean on me like this. When I have a real girlfriend in the future, there will be nothing between you and me. We will have to keep a physical distance.\u201d\nGu Jialing screamed and slammed on the brakes. Xu Shou also tilted a few times, and his long legs supported the ground in time to avoid colliding with Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bicycle.\nSu Miaomiao was also shocked, and sat in the back seat of the bicycle blankly.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, and simply stopped the bike, holding on to the handlebar with one hand and the seat with the other to keep the balance of the bike so that Su Miaomiao wouldn\u2019t fall off.\nWhen the eyes of the three demons were all focused on his face, Xie Jingyuan formally explained, \u201cThe patriarch\u2019s concept is to refrain from obscenity, evil, and not to abstain from normal marriage. Grandma is old, and her biggest wish is to see me get married. With the permission of the patriarch, I naturally can\u2019t bear to let grandma down.\u201d\nThe three demons all thought of Grandma Tao\u2019s amiable face.\nTherefore, it was very normal for the Taoist master to have such thoughts.\nShock was shock, since the reasoning made sense, Su Miaomiao, Xu Shou, and Gu Jialing all understood Xie Jingyuan\u2019s decision.\nHowever, when Su Miaomiao thought that the Taoist master would have a real girlfriend in the future, she would no longer be able to lean on him and smell the Taoist master at a close distance, she got very uncomfortable.\nShe lowered her head and scratched the seat unconsciously with her fingers.\nXu Shou noticed her expression and small movements, thought for a moment, and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cSince the Taoist master will fall in love and get married normally, from today onwards, you can continue to ride Gu Jialing\u2019s bicycle, and stop clinging to the Taoist master. Otherwise, if other women misunderstand your relationship with the Taoist master, how will they dare pursue him then?\u201d\nThe kind of woman who would misunderstand that the Taoist master and Su Miaomiao were lovers but still pursued the Taoist master would not be a serious woman.\nSu Miaomiao was already in a bad mood, so after being scolded by him, she immediately glared at him fiercely.\nIn the two lifetimes, what she really obeyed was Xie Jingyuan\u2019s discipline, and even some teachings of Su Mingan and his wife and Grandma Tao, because Xie Jingyuan kept repeating them to her in private, she could remember and accept them.\nXu Shou knew her temper, looked at the Taoist master, and believed that he would explain the truth to her clearly.\nXie Jingyuan said calmly, \u201cI\u2019ll be too busy in university. I probably won\u2019t fall in love during this period, I can continue to take care of her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As long as you ignore Su Miaomiao and let out the signal that you are single, the girls will definitely come rushing.\u201d\nGu Jialing got closer to them before speaking, \u201cIt\u2019s useless for you to stare at me. The Taoist master wants to fall in love. If you are sensible, you should take the initiative to keep a distance from him. But you don\u2019t have to worry, your appearance is also good. It is very attractive to human men. As long as you say that you are single, there will be no fewer boys who pursue you than girls who pursue him, but men are too bad. They may just want to take advantage of you, and their feelings may not be sincere enough. You\u2019d better keep your eyes open, oh, I remembered, Lin Xi is pretty good\u2026\u201d\nBefore he could list Lin Xi\u2019s advantages one by one, Xie Jingyuan looked over coldly.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhy was he staring at him? And what did he say wrong?\nXie Jingyuan said seriously, \u201cDuring university, her studies are the most important. She is already busy with training and studies. Don\u2019t mislead her astray.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded, and then reprimanded Gu Jialing, \u201cThe purpose of entering the university is to study, not to fall in love. Moreover, Su Miaomiao doesn\u2019t like Lin Xi at all, so if she seeks out a relationship with him just to manipulate Lin Xi, it won\u2019t be fair.\u201d\nGu Jialing thought about it, and it seemed to be the reason.\n\u201cOkay, then you two pretend to be in love for another four years, and then think about your respective lifelong events after you graduate,\u201d Gu Jialing concluded smartly.\nHe stopped talking, and Su Miaomiao continued to think about things with her head down.\nAfter entering the campus, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou first went to the cafeteria to eat.\nXie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao to the gymnasium.\nIt was not yet sunrise time, the sky was dark, and the light from the street lamps seemed listless.\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back, pouted and asked, \u201cIs the Taoist master really planning to find a woman to fall in love with?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan slowed down, \u201cYes, since I am going to consider getting married after graduation, I must go through the step of falling in love first to determine whether we are suitable.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen what should I do?\u201d\nHe was the Taoist master. Su Miaomiao never thought that the Taoist master would get married. She thought that he would live alone all the time, so she could stay with him forever. Live in a house with her marriage partner, and continue to go to the Taoist master during the day.\nHowever, if the Taoist master fell in love and had another woman with him, she could no longer get close to him.\nXie Jingyuan tilted his head, \u201cHaven\u2019t you also considered getting married? Of course you will be living with your marriage partner.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cI want to be with you even after I get married, and just stay with him at night. Parents also do their own things during the day.\u201d\nIt was only then that Xie Jingyuan realized that she thought of marriage so simply, and only then did he know that he was also a part of her original marriage plan.\nHe stopped the bicycle, turned his head, looked at her and said, \u201cIf you like someone, you will be willing to marry him. When you meet that kind of person, you will leave me naturally.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked bewildered, \u201cIf I can\u2019t meet such a person, what should you do?\u201d\nShe was still more concerned about whether Xie Jingyuan would abandon her, and when she thought of that, the blankness in her eyes quickly turned into grievance.\nXie Jingyuan patted her head, \u201cObserve slowly, you will always meet someone, but don\u2019t worry, I will wait for you, wait for you to meet him, wait for you to leave me first.\u201d\nThat answer was still not enough to satisfy Su Miaomiao, \u201cWhat if I never meet him in my life?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan smiled, and said helplessly, \u201cThen let\u2019s have a fake marriage, so that the hearts of the elders on both sides will be assured.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up all of a sudden, like those pots of wilted green plants, instantly glowing again.\nXie Jingyuan put away his smile and looked at her with complicated eyes, \u201cI still hope you meet a good guy, because there is a big difference between a real marriage and a fake marriage.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t answer any more, and took her to the tennis court to start the day\u2019s morning exercise.\nSu Miaomiao was a cat who didn\u2019t like to have too many things in her head, including people she thought had nothing to do with her, including those simple or complicated human relationships.\nBut if she had doubts, she would always think about it and be eager to know the answer.\nAfter breakfast, Xie Jingyuan sent Su Miaomiao to the door of the classroom and left. At that time, there were only ten minutes left before class.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t sleep, she asked Zhao Lu beside her in a low voice, \u201cDo you know the difference between a real marriage and a fake marriage?\u201d\nThat was also the first time that Su Miaomiao asked her roommates such a \u201cworldly\u201d question.\nZhao Lu: \u201cThis, can you be more specific?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t understand what \u201cspecific\u201d meant.\nZhao Lu spread it out for her, \u201cTrue marriage is very simple, that is, two people like each other, and they get married naturally. False marriages can be divided into many situations. For example, a woman didn\u2019t like him, but her grandmother was dying, wanted to see her get married before she died, this woman couldn\u2019t bear to refuse. So she found a good friend for a fake marriage, or a woman didn\u2019t like a man, but the man promised to give her some kind of benefits after the fake marriage\u2026\u201d\nAfter listening to several examples, Su Miaomiao felt that if she and the Taoist master got married in a fake way, it would be more like the first one Zhao Lu mentioned, and the others would be too complicated.\nAt that time, the teacher came in.\nZhao Lu gave her a \u201cto be continued\u201d look, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it after class.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao waited patiently for forty-five minutes.\nAfter class, Zhao Lu immediately continued, \u201cThis kind of fake marriage, the woman will pretend to be in love with the man in front of the elders, and the two of them will not have intimate contact in private, such as hugging or something.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIntimate contact after they get married?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Since the patriarch allowed it, he must also want to marry a woman to do that kind of thing.\nSo the Taoist master didn\u2019t want a fake marriage with her, but hoped to find another woman for a real marriage.\nHey, why was the Taoist master so stupid? As long as he wanted it, she could satisfy him.\nAfter figuring out the key to solving the problem, Su Miaomiao became happy again, free of doubts and burdens.\nAt noon, Xie Jingyuan came to pick her up, and found Su Miaomiao standing by the roadside, smiling brightly at him.\nXie Jingyuan stopped in front of her, \u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes were crooked with a smile, she leaned on the handlebars and stood on tiptoe, approached his ear and said, \u201cTaoist Master, we can actually get married, I understand!\u201d\nWhen the warm breath rushed into his ear, Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t move his body, he only looked at her with his eyes, \u201cWhat do you understand?\u201d\nSeeing her smiling like that, it seemed that she didn\u2019t seem to understand at all.\nThen, he heard Su Miaomiao say triumphantly, \u201cYou want to find a woman to consummate the marriage with, and I can do it too.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe pushed her hand away and rode forward.\nSu Miaomiao yelled, \u201cHey, why are you leaving? Wait for me!\u201d\nShe ran a few steps quickly and skillfully jumped into the back seat of the bicycle.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t chase her away, but just rode silently all the way with a sullen face.\nIn the evening, Xie Jingyuan had classes, and Su Miaomiao was sitting in the self-study classroom next door doing homework.\nAfter finishing her homework, Su Miaomiao took out her phone and opened the link to the novel Zhao Lu sent.\nThis novel was called \u201cOverbearing CEO: 99 Days of Contract Marriage\u201d.\nAccording to Zhao Lu, if Su Miaomiao read that novel, she would understand the specific situation of another fake marriage.\nIn fact, Su Miaomiao certainly understood whether she could have children or not. It was just the Taoist master who had always been extraordinary and refined, so Su Miaomiao thought there may be some serious differences.\nDuring the day, she told the Taoist master that she could accompany him to have a baby, but the Taoist master\u2019s face turned cold all day, which showed that she guessed wrong, and the Taoist master was not such a secular man.\nUnder the leadership of Xie Jingyuan, Su Miaomiao got very serious once she read a book. So then, she started to read the novel with the spirit of serious study, trying to find other mysteries of real marriage besides having children.\nSeeing the paid chapter, Su Miaomiao bought the rest of the content in one go. Since it was learning, she must start and end it.\nShe read it so seriously that she didn\u2019t even hear the bell ring.\nXie Jingyuan pushed away the students in the classroom, expecting to see Su Miaomiao just waking up, but found her with her head down, looking at the phone intently.\nOther than playing fruit ninja, the phone in her hands was only used to perform the most basic functions such as making calls and sending messages.\nThe last time she held an electronic device so seriously was because she listened to Zhao Lu\u2019s words and wanted to study the relationship between cat slaves and cat owners.\nThinking of it, Xie Jingyuan suddenly had a bad feeling in his heart.\nAgainst the flow of self-study students going out, Xie Jingyuan came to Su Miaomiao\u2019s side, but she didn\u2019t realize that he was standing behind her, looking at her phone screen.\n[Feng Lingye looked at the woman who was pushed against the wall by him, and smiled coldly. His slender fingers with well-defined bony joints lifted her fair and delicate chin, and his eyes were forty percent indifferent, thirty percent playful, twenty percent mocking, and ten percent affectionate as he said, \u201cAre you trying to seduce me by dressing like this?\u201d]\n[The domineering aura that belonged only to the man surrounding her, and Luo Bingqing, who had never been in such close contact with a strange man before, had red face. But her petite and slender body was touched by Feng Lingye. She lowered her butterfly-like eyelashes, bit her bright red lips, and wanted to cry, \u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know you are coming back.\u201d]\n[The sarcasm in Feng Lingye\u2019s eyes became stronger, and his eyes moved down the little woman\u2019s blushing face\u2026]\nWhen the domineering CEO began to look at the heroine\u2019s clothes, Xie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, and reached out to snatch Su Miaomiao\u2019s phone.\nSu Miaomiao was startled, turned her head to look up, and met Xie Jingyuan\u2019s unusually serious face, as if she had been caught by him for stealing food.\nThere were no other students in the self-study room, so Xie Jingyuan could only ask her directly.\nHe raised his hands, looked at her and asked, \u201cWhy did you suddenly think of reading novels?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me the difference between real and fake marriages, so I can only know it by reading.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThis kind of book is just for entertainment. You won\u2019t learn anything from it, so don\u2019t waste your time.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted and packed her bag, and obediently followed him out.\nThe temperature outside was only seven or eight degrees, and as soon as they left the teaching building, there was a gust of wind blowing in her face, making her subconsciously hide into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms.\nXie Jingyuan glanced around, and hugged her shoulder cooperatively.\nHe wore a coat without pockets that day, and after getting on the bicycle, Su Miaomiao\u2019s arms around him were exposed outside, blown cold by the wind. But how could she be freezing in vain? The bicycle hadn\u2019t been driven very far, when Su Miaomiao placed her hand under Xie Jingyuan\u2019s clothes. Her original intention was to stick to his inner clothes to keep warm, but she didn\u2019t expect that she directly touched Xie Jingyuan\u2019s lower abdomen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After washing, she got into bed and remembered the novel again.\nLeaning on the bed, Su Miaomiao picked up her phone and continued to read with relish.\nThat novel only had more than 300,000 words, and Su Miaomiao seemed to read it very fast. As for the content, it was about the domineering president who was forced to obey the marriage that the old man made, but the old man had only three months to live. He signed a ninety-nine-day contract marriage with the heroine.\nIn the early days of the fake marriage, the domineering president always bullied the heroine, and she also told her good friends that she hated the domineering president, but as the domineering president did all kinds of intimate things to the heroine, she quickly accepted it. After meeting the male protagonist, he also fell in love with her because of repeated intimacy. The fake marriage turned into a real marriage. Before the old man passed away, the female protagonist was pregnant.\u00a0\nThe novel had a happy ending!\nSu Miaomiao was not sleepy at all, thinking about things facing the ceiling.\nThrough that novel, Su Miaomiao had fully understood that whether a man and a woman loved each other was the biggest difference between a real marriage and a fake marriage.\nIf she didn\u2019t want to be separated from the Taoist master, and she didn\u2019t want him to abandon her just because he fell in love with another woman, the only way was to make him fall in love with her.\nA demon like her had different ways, but the Taoist master said she was a human and not a cat. If she insisted on treating herself as a cat, the Taoist master would get angry.\nSince there was no distinction between human and demon, as long as she used the right method, it was not impossible for the Taoist master to fall in love with her.\nThanks to Zhao Lu, she had already learned how to make a person fall in love with her within ninety-nine days, from the domineering president.\nAt six o\u2019clock in the morning, three boys walked out of 801 and stood in the corridor waiting for Su Miaomiao.\nGu Jialing looked particularly lethargic that day and was yawning non-stop.\nXie Jingyuan asked him, \u201cWhat time did you sleep last night?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cI didn\u2019t play games, I went to bed at twelve o\u2019clock.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cWhen I woke up, I heard you typing on the keyboard.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nDid dogs\u2019 ears need to be so sharp?!\nAfter glaring at Xu Shou fiercely, Gu Jialing looked at the Taoist master with a guilty conscience.\nXie Jingyuan just said indifferently, \u201cIt is said that staying up late will lead to hair loss.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cIt\u2019s fine to be bald. You don\u2019t have to worry about Su Miaomiao bullying you anymore.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s face changed drastically. He would rather be scratched by a cat every day than become a bald bird.\nAt that moment, Su Miaomiao came out, before seeing the three of them clearly, she yawned.\nGu Jialing immediately asked Xu Shou, \u201cDid you hear what she did last night?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWith such a distance, unless Su Miaomiao sang in the middle of the night, how could he hear it?\nXie Jingyuan noticed Su Miaomiao\u2019s dark circles.\nThe cultivation of the three demons was subtly carried out during sleep. If she did not sleep, once she stayed up late, she would experience certain symptoms like ordinary people.\nWithout him asking, Gu Jialing had already started interrogating, \u201cBe honest, what did you do last night?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glanced at Xie Jingyuan, and lied, \u201cIt was too cold, so I couldn\u2019t sleep well. I need to change to a thick quilt today.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cIt has been so long since the temperature dropped, but you haven\u2019t changed it yet?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel cold before.\u201d\nThat kind of excuse, whether Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou believed it or not, Gu Jialing believed it, and he successfully diverted the topic.\nThey separated when they reached the campus, and Xie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao to the gymnasium. Before playing, he asked her to stand still and touched her eyebrows with his fingertips.\nSu Miaomiao felt the familiar coolness, as if the pattering rain had nourished the yellowish and wilting young saplings.\nIt was a pity that this comfortable feeling didn\u2019t last long.\nSu Miaomiao opened her eyes with a lot of thought.\nXie Jingyuan pursed his lips and explained, \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao knew that he was not that powerful yet, but she was already content.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan was holding the racket and was about to walk away, Su Miaomiao suddenly grabbed his arm and asked with a smile, \u201cTaoist Master, do you like me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe looked at her expressionlessly, and his tone was as calm as usual, even colder, \u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao touched her forehead and said triumphantly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like me, why did you give me the spiritual power?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cTraining is a serious matter, I don\u2019t want you to delay training.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to quibble, I know exactly what you are thinking.\u201d\nAfter speaking, she went to the opposite side of the field first.\nThe domineering president\u2019s first move was no matter what the female lead thought, he must first believe that the other party had him in her heart, and everything she did was to seduce him.\nThe time in the morning was too short, and Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t do much.\nWhen eating in the cafeteria at noon, Su Miaomiao ate slowly on purpose. After Xu Shou and Gu Jialing left impatiently, she took out the contract that she spent an hour writing in the morning from her bag and handed it to Xie Jingyuan.\nTheir dining table was located in the corner of the cafeteria, and there were no people around at that time.\nHowever, when he saw clearly the content on the paper, Xie Jingyuan still changed his direction to ensure that even if someone passed by, they couldn\u2019t peep.\nAfter reading it, he asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cWhy did you suddenly think of the written evidence?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "160": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-160/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao smiled and said, \u201cYou promised that if I never met someone I like, you would marry me, and you would never abandon me for the rest of your life. There is no evidence for what you said, and it will only count if you sign it.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan guessed that she must have been influenced by the romance novel, and must have thought that after signing the contract, the two of them would naturally become real like in the novel.\nIf he didn\u2019t sign, she might continue to resort to other dodgy romance novels, wasting time for nothing.\nXie Jingyuan took out a pen, made some amendments to that ineffective contract, and then signed his name.\nSu Miaomiao checked again and found that Xie Jingyuan changed the first line of \u201ccontract marriage\u201d to \u201ccontract love\u201d, and shortened the validity period to college graduation.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cFall in love first. If you haven\u2019t found someone you really like when you graduate, then we will sign a marriage contract.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought it was okay. Anyway, the Taoist master would fall in love with her in less than ninety-nine days, and love would be real by then, and they could get married directly after graduation.\nEach of them held a copy of the handwritten note written by Su Miaomiao.\nAfter leaving the cafeteria, Xie Jingyuan sent Su Miaomiao back to the dormitory, and reminded her, \u201cReplenish your sleep and stop thinking about it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at his handsome face, and showed that kind of smug smile again, \u201cYou care about me so much, you really like me, right?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhat was written in that domineering president\u2019s novel?!\nXie Jingyuan was too busy, although he was very curious about what kind of mess Su Miaomiao had learned from that novel, he didn\u2019t have time to check it out.\nAfter five consecutive classes, it was six o\u2019clock when he left the teaching building.\nRiding a bicycle to the gymnasium to pick her up may be due to excessive physical exertion from the afternoon\u2019s training, but Su Miaomiao looked very normal at that time.\nXie Jingyuan still had three classes in the evening. Considering that Su Miaomiao stayed up late the previous night, Xie Jingyuan asked her if she wanted to go back to the lakeside community first.\nStaying up late still had a great negative impact on Su Miaomiao, even the spiritual power that Xie Jingyuan gave her in the morning could not completely make her recover.\nShe looked quieter, as if she might fall asleep at any moment.\nXie Jingyuan was worried about leaving her alone in the study room, so he explained to the professor in advance, and then sat at the same table with Su Miaomiao.\nThe professor\u2019s voice was so loud, and the students\u2019 discussions during the break were so noisy, but none of which disturbed Su Miaomiao.\nShe slept soundly, like a cat lying on a desk.\nXie Jingyuan remembered that when he brought her back to Qingxu Temple, he came back the next day and found her sleeping under his bed board. He wanted to ask her why she was sleeping there, but she was too afraid of him and ran away in panic. Of course, as long as he was not there, Su Miaomiao would still slip into his room and get under his bed.\nXie Jingyuan asked a little Taoist to clean up the bottom of the bed as well, so as not to stain her cat fur.\nThinking about it, if Su Miaomiao wasn\u2019t afraid of him at the time, she would have slept directly on his bed.\nSu Miaomiao followed him downstairs in a daze, sat on the bicycle and continued to sleep with her arms around him.\nXie Jingyuan rode very slowly, because he was afraid that she would let go and fall if she slept too soundly.\nBack in the lakeside community, Su Miaomiao was still in a daze.\nXie Jingyuan remembered the problem of the quilt, and asked her, \u201cIs the quilt really not warm enough?\u201d\nTheir physique was more frost-resistant than ordinary people.\nSu Miaomiao thought he was going to meditate in her room like the previous time, so she nodded quickly.\nXie Jingyuan followed her into 802, \u201cI\u2019ll change the quilt for you.\u201d\nHowever, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t know which cabinet her father kept the thick quilt in.\nXie Jingyuan asked her to wash her face, walked into the cloakroom, opened several cabinets, and found it.\nSu Miaomiao came out of the bathroom, walked to the door of the master bedroom, and saw Xie Jingyuan putting the quilt, standing with his back to the door, tall and thin, with a good-looking figure.\nFacing his cold gaze, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t dare do anything, she changed direction and sat on the head of the bed, watching him put on the quilt.\nLooking at the scene, the content of that book came to mind again.\nShe just smiled and said, \u201cYou helped me put on the quilt, and you still say that you don\u2019t like me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her, continued to stuff the quilt core into the quilt cover with his hands, and asked lightly \u201cYou seem to really want to make sure whether I like you, is that important?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhy didn\u2019t the Taoist master deny it, but instead asked her a question?\nThat was different from what was written in the novel, Su Miaomiao had no choice but to put aside the novel for the time being, and replied seriously, \u201cIt\u2019s important, if you like me, you will fall in love with me, and we will never have to separate again.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s expression did not change at all, as if he only saw the quilt in his hand, \u201cHow can it be considered as a real relationship?\u201d\nAfter asking, he frowned suddenly, remembering her theory of giving birth.\nHe was about to change the topic, but Su Miaomiao replied with a smile, \u201cI like you, and you also like me, so it\u2019s called true love.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her unexpectedly.\nSu Miaomiao confirmed, \u201cAm I right?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked away and hummed.\nIt seemed that the novel of the domineering president was not without merit.\nSu Miaomiao moved to his side, and asked expectantly, \u201cMaster Taoist, I like you, do you like me? If you do, we two can be in a real relationship.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t even need to look into her eyes, but he knew how innocent those eyes would be.\nHe asked in a low voice, \u201cDo you know what love is?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI do, what Xu Shou said, love is a man and a woman together, they will miss each other all the time, want to cling to each other, this is how I treat you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was very clear that her liking was a habit that the two had developed together in the past eighteen years. If it was another person, such as Lin Xi or Gu Jialing, as long as they were willing to give the same patience as him, Su Miaomiao would also like them and would be equally dependent on them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "161": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-161/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t blame her for her innocence. In the final analysis, she was like that because of his connivance step by step.\nIt was he who chose to acquiesce when she acted cutely for the first time.\n\u201cWhat Xu Shou said is only one part of it, not entirely correct.\u201d\nAfter Xie Jingyuan finished speaking, he walked to the other side of the bed, pulled the two corners of the quilt, and shook it vigorously.\nThe quilt went up and down, and his cold face appeared and disappeared from time to time. After he relayed the quilt and looked over from the bed, Su Miaomiao found a chance to ask, \u201cIs Xu Shou not telling the whole truth?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to answer so specifically, but he was afraid that she would continue to ask her roommates.\nHe had no choice but to assume the posture of a professor, and rationally gave her some knowledge, \u201cWhen you love someone, in addition to wanting to spend time with the other person, you will also have physical desires for that person, including holding hands, hugging, and kissing. This kind of emotion comes naturally, not that you come to do these things with me deliberately because you want to be with me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was dumbfounded.\nXie Jingyuan asked her directly,\u201dHave you ever thought of kissing me?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at his lips and shook her head honestly.\nXie Jingyuan smiled, his eyes were gentle, \u201cLook, so you don\u2019t love me like a woman loves a man.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was not happy, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, as long as you love me, I am willing to accompany you like that.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s related, I like the relationship between the two to be like that.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stared at him blankly, and the image of Xie Jingyuan hugging and kissing a strange woman gradually appeared in her mind.\nShe couldn\u2019t imagine that woman\u2019s face, but she knew that sooner or later there would be such a woman who would make the Taoist master fall in love with her and want to sleep with her.\nEven if the Taoist master wanted to marry her in a fake relationship because of that contract, what if his heart was taken away by a woman? At that time, how could he treat her well?\u00a0\u00a0\nAt that moment, Su Miaomiao suddenly didn\u2019t want to go to university anymore, and she didn\u2019t want to play tennis. She just wanted to go back to Anshi to her parents, Grandma Tao or the mountains and forests and continue to live a life that a cat should live.\nSu Miaomiao took out her phone.\nXie Jingyuan asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cCalling dad to ask him to pick me up.\u201d\nJust when she was about to press the dial button, Xie Jingyuan leaned over, supported the bed with one hand, and snatched her phone with the other.\nAfter confirming that the call had not been dialed, Xie Jingyuan asked her with a complicated expression, \u201cWhy do you want to go home?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at him coldly, \u201cYou won\u2019t love me, you will sleep with another woman sooner or later, I don\u2019t want to follow you anymore.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s eyebrows twitched fiercely, \u201cWho said I want to sleep with another woman?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou said it yourself, you want to find a woman who desires you, the two of you will be in love with each other!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI mean, I want to find someone who I love and she loves me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhatever you say, anyway, that person is not me!\u201d\nShe was very angry and had no patience at all, and she wanted to grab her phone back with a sullen face.\nXie Jingyuan quickly left the bed, avoiding her hand.\nSu Miaomiao jumped down, and after two jumps, she couldn\u2019t reach the phone that Xie Jingyuan held up high. She was so heartbroken that she stretched out her hand to scratch his neck.\nShe often quarreled with Gu Jialing like that, but he seldom really made her angry. Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t know how to use her nails, but that time she was pissed off by Xie Jingyuan.\nSince he didn\u2019t want to support her for the rest of his life, why did he bring her back to Qingxu Temple?\nAs for the other things, he had no one around to observe him, so he started eating meat, drinking, and thinking about women.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t expect her to be so ruthless.\nThe place where she scratched his neck seemed to have been touched by fire. Xie Jingyuan touched it with his other hand, and sure enough, he saw blood.\n\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Su Miaomiao glared at him angrily.\nXie Jingyuan just looked into her eyes and saw the strong emotion appearing in them for the first time.\nWhen Su Miaomiao was about to scratch him again, Xie Jingyuan grabbed her hand in time.\nSu Miaomiao tried to break free, but couldn\u2019t get rid of him at all.\nAt that time, she finally remembered the gap between the two of them. She couldn\u2019t beat Xie Jingyuan in her previous life, and she couldn\u2019t beat him in the current life either.\nThe fear quickly replaced the anger in her eyes, and she slowly lowered her head.\nShe had never had any backbone. She lived for a hundred years in her previous life, and she only wanted not to be bullied by the old demons, but to practice hard to improve her strength.\nXie Jingyuan threw her phone on the bed and said with lowered eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s you who don\u2019t love me, not that I don\u2019t love you.\u201d\nBefore Su Miaomiao could react, Xie Jingyuan suddenly raised her chin.\nShe saw that familiar face getting closer, and even his unique clear autumn dew aura was replaced by a fiery aura that was unfamiliar to her.\nSu Miaomiao was already burned by the scorching heat. At that moment, Xie Jingyuan let go of her hand, took two steps back, and pulled open the glass window of the balcony with his backhand.\nHe went to the balcony, his figure was hidden by the curtains.\nSu Miaomiao froze in place.\n\u201cIt\u2019s you who don\u2019t love me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love you.\u201d\nSo, the Taoist master loved her?\nAny of her emotions come quickly and purely. She would be very angry when she was vexed, and she would be very happy when she was surprised.\nSo, did the Taoist master just want to kiss her because he loved her, and had a physical desire for her?\nSu Miaomiao, who fully understood all that, happily opened the glass window that had been closed again, jumped into the darkness, and threw herself into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms.\nXie Jingyuan leaned against the balcony railing, almost instinctively opening his arms.\nThe force of Su Miaomiao was not light, and his back was hurt by the railing.\nXie Jingyuan just patted the top of her head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When Su Miaomiao raised her head, she first saw the blood mark on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s neck from being scratched by her. He was fair, so those streaks of red were obvious.\nSu Miaomiao sat down on the bed with a guilty conscience, lowered her head and picked her fingers.\nAlthough the wound looked miserable, it was actually just a slight skin trauma. After a night of meditation and healing, there would be no traces left.\nSu Miaomiao also followed to the bathroom, stood at the door, and looked at him eagerly.\nXie Jingyuan opened the cabinet, took out a box of cotton swabs, and comforted her while cleaning up the blood, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it will be fine tomorrow morning.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao breathed a sigh of relief, seeing that it was inconvenient for him to lift his neck, she kindly said, \u201cMay I help you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her, handed her the cotton swab in his hand, turned and leaned against the sink.\nSu Miaomiao supported his waist with one hand, and gently wiped away the blood around the wound with the cotton swab in the other hand.\nHe still had to raise his head slightly, his eyes drooped, and he could only see the top of her head.\nSu Miaomiao defended herself, \u201cSince you loved me, why didn\u2019t you say it earlier? If you had said it earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have scratched you.\u201d\nOriginally, he wanted to wait for Su Miaomiao to slowly come to her senses, but she actually misrepresented his kindness to her as the connivance of the cat slave to the cat owner.\nOf course, Xie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t let her misunderstand him any longer. During those two weeks, he deliberately kept a distance, hoping that she would feel something, but she became more polite, and even thanked him.\nSu Miaomiao would be so polite only when outsiders helped her.\nAlienation was useless, if he continued to be the Taoist master, she would only become the same as before, so Xie Jingyuan thought of breaking the precept.\nMaybe, if she saw him as a normal man, she would be a little tempted.\nAt the same time, let Xu Shou and Gu Jialing be prepared first, and accept that kind of thing step by step, so as not to scare them by suddenly announcing that he was in love with Su Miaomiao in the future.\nThe plan was well done, but he didn\u2019t expect Su Miaomiao to be so insecure and so worried about being abandoned by him.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want her to be afraid, and he didn\u2019t want her to leave with the misunderstanding that he would like another person.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like me, so what\u2019s the use of telling you?\u201d Xie Jingyuan explained simply.\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cI also like the Taoist master. I like to hug you and lean against you. I also want to sleep in the same bed with you, but I don\u2019t have the desire to kiss or have children for the time being.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the lamp above his head, and felt that it was not suitable to discuss such a topic at that moment.\nSu Miaomiao continued, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, Taoist Master, I will study hard.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan guessed that she would say that, and said coldly, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to learn this kind of thing, just obey your heart. If you don\u2019t feel it, don\u2019t force it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao paused.\nWould she feel it? What was it like?\nShe raised her head and saw the slender and fair neck of the Taoist master. The lines were more beautiful because of the slight upward movement.\nShe couldn\u2019t kiss, but she could lick.\nWhen cats liked someone, they also used licking.\nSu Miaomiao stood on tiptoe, passed through his Adam\u2019s apple, and stopped at his chin.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe grabbed her shoulders violently, pushed her out of the bathroom immediately, and closed the door.\nSu Miaomiao was stunned, and knocked on the door outside,\u201dMaster, why are you pushing me out?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t make trouble, just wait outside.\u201d\nShe obediently went to the living room.\nXie Jingyuan stayed in the bathroom alone for ten minutes, cleaned up the blood on his neck, and finally came out.\nSu Miaomiao was almost falling asleep lying on the sofa, still holding the cotton swab she just took in her hand.\nHearing the sound of the door opening, she sat up in a daze.\nWith her like that, Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t think about what she just did, walked up to her, knelt down on one knee, and discussed in a low voice, \u201cI love you, don\u2019t tell Xu Shou and the others yet.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was very sleepy, and when she was sleepy, she didn\u2019t bother to think about it, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and said, \u201cI just broke the precept. If they knew I fell in love with you so quickly, they would think that you seduced me.\u201d\nSince she hadn\u2019t really understood the matter of feelings, she was not in a hurry to disclose it, so she could leave some time for the other demons to adapt.\nSu Miaomiao snorted. Gu Jialing would be fine with it, but Xu Shou would easily think of her as a bad person.\n\u201cOkay, but when you think you can tell them, you have to make it clear that you fell in love with me first,\u201d Su Miaomiao said angrily.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes were gentle as he said, \u201cOf course.\u201d\nOnly then was she satisfied.\nXie Jingyuan took the cotton swab in her hand, \u201cGo to sleep, don\u2019t stay up late.\u201d\nShe stayed up all night the previous night, so she didn\u2019t have the energy to stay up. In the end, she rubbed her eyes and went to the bedroom.\nXie Jingyuan turned off the light outside for her, then turned up his collar to cover his neck, and then left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "163": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-163/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 801, Gu Jialing was playing games in the room, and Xu Shou was sitting in the living room reading a book.\nXie Jingyuan specially washed the wound with soapy water to cover up the faint smell of blood. As for the collar, it was normal for him to raise it up because of the strong wind outside.\nXu Shou just asked, \u201cYou just came back from university?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI came back after class and put on a quilt for Su Miaomiao.\u201d\nXu Shou knew that the Taoist master returned later than usual, and he must have gone to work for Su Miaomiao again.\n\u201cGo to bed early,\u201d Xie Jingyuan told him, and returned to the room with his bag.\nXu Shou also turned off the light in the living room.\nIn the morning, Su Miaomiao was woken up by the alarm clock and stretched, feeling refreshed.\nShe jumped out of bed and went to the bathroom. While brushing her teeth, the scenes of the previous night suddenly and clearly appeared in front of her eyes.\nIt turned out that the Taoist master loved her and wanted to kiss her, and he would not go to those women outside.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s mood became very good.\nPreviously, she was the cat of Qingxu Temple, but in the future she would become the wife of the master of Qingxu Temple. Therefore, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing would listen to her.\nToo bad it may take a while before she could tell them.\nEven so, when she opened the door and saw the three boys outside, Su Miaomiao still showed a happy smile.\nXie Jingyuan looked away, Xu Shou frowned, and Gu Jialing was the most direct. He looked at Su Miaomiao suspiciously, \u201cYou are smiling so wickedly, what have you done?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked, but did not refute.\nThat time she stole the master of Qingxu Temple, and she was considered a thief once, even though Xie Jingyuan himself wanted to give her his heart.\nIgnoring Gu Jialing, Su Miaomiao smiled and handed her bag to Xie Jingyuan, taking the opportunity to look at his neck.\nSure enough, no traces could be seen there, the Taoist master was very powerful.\nXie Jingyuan took the bag and walked forward, to prevent her from licking it again.\nWhen they got downstairs, Su Miaomiao jumped into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back seat.\nIn the past, she would hug him obediently with one hand, but the relationship was different. Su Miaomiao deliberately changed to hug him with both hands, and leaned her head comfortably against him.\nXu Shou was on the opposite side, and seeing her enjoyment, he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cBe careful, even if everyone thinks you and the Taoist master are lovers, it\u2019s not appropriate to hug like this.\u201d\nIn fact, men and women in that world were much more open than in their previous life, and it was not uncommon to kiss each other on the street. Xu Shou just couldn\u2019t see Su Miaomiao always taking advantage of the Taoist master openly, so he said so.\nSu Miaomiao glared at him, \u201cThe Taoist master doesn\u2019t mind, so mind your own business.\u201d\nAfter making the relationship public, she would do even more outrageous things to the Taoist master in front of Xu Shou.\nXu Shou pursed his lips.\nXie Jingyuan looked around and said, \u201cThere is no one on the road now, let her.\u201d\nGu Jialing asked sourly, \u201cTaoist Master, if I were a female bird and became a girl after reincarnation, would you take care of me like this?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s voice was cold and decisive, \u201cNo.\u201d\nGu Jialing snorted, and he knew that it had nothing to do with gender, the Taoist master just favored cats and dogs. Xu Shou was too sensible and self-reliant, if he was also like Su Miaomiao, a scoundrel, the Taoist master would not be biased to him.\nSu Miaomiao actually restrained herself in front of them. After everyone entered the campus and Xu Shou and Gu Jialing left, Su Miaomiao happily rubbed Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI didn\u2019t agree just now because of your self-respect. This is not allowed in public places from now on.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pricked up her ears, \u201cIs it okay to do so in a non-public place?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan paused, and said, \u201cYou can rub, but you are not allowed to lick.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThen I won\u2019t lick. Taoist Master, will you teach me to kiss?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait until you really love me.\u201d\nHe forbade her to bring up the subject again.\nSu Miaomiao thought she loved the Taoist master very much now, but the Taoist master refused to believe it.\nAt noon, she did not go to the study room with Xie Jingyuan, but went back to the dormitory.\nShe suddenly opened the door and came in, and the three roommates were very surprised.\nZhao Lu: \u201cHey, why aren\u2019t you with the guy today?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was very frank, \u201cI have a question to ask you.\u201d\nZhao Lu asked with a smile, \u201cStudy, or emotional life?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cEmotional.\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cCan it be discussed publicly, or the two of them shouldn\u2019t hear it?\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a few seconds before confirming, \u201cWe can discuss it openly.\u201d\nThe three roommates surrounded Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI love the Taoist master, but he thinks that I don\u2019t love him enough. Is there any way to make him believe me?\u201d\nZhao Lu touched the goosebumps on her arms, \u201cNo way! You two are so sticky, but Xie Jingyuan is still worried about this?\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cMaybe Miaomiao is too good, Xie Jingyuan has no sense of security, after all, he is only a genius of Beijing University, but Miaomiao is the world champion!\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cThat\u2019s why he treats Miaomiao so well. He wishes he could take Miaomiao with him everywhere, and even ran to our classroom to declare his sovereignty!\u201d\nAfter such an analysis, the roommates who just thought it was unbelievable immediately accepted the fact that Xie Jingyuan was \u201cextremely insecure\u201d in the relationship.\nSu Miaomiao just waited for her roommates to help her. In that respect, human girls were much smarter than her.\nZhao Lu suddenly smiled, \u201cKiss him, the most direct, simple and effective!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, \u201cHe won\u2019t let me kiss, he asked me to make sure I love him before I could kiss.\u201d\n\u201cI have seen that he is abstinent, but I didn\u2019t expect to be so abstinent!\u201d\n\u201cTo a beauty of Miaomiao\u2019s level, he could actually stand refusing her!\u201d\n\u201cKing Taoist master, his reputation is well-deserved!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "164": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-164/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the end of the eighth class, Xie Jingyuan received a message from Su Miaomiao, saying that she would have dinner with her roommates, and that she would stay in the dormitory for evening self-study. She asked Xie Jingyuan to pick her up in the dormitory after finishing class.\nFrom kindergarten to university, Su Miaomiao had never abandoned him for others. It was so boring to study alone in the classroom, and she also wanted to stay in the place closest to him.\nShe had undergone such a big change on the first day of her relationship, it was hard not to let Xie Jingyuan think too much.\nSu Miaomiao: No activity, sleeping on my stomach in the study room is not comfortable, I like to lie on the bed.\nSu Miaomiao: No, I like to spend more time with my roommates.\nHer roommates were all very nice, warm and generous, and they took good care of Su Miaomiao, but, thinking of her cat slave theory and domineering CEO talk style, Xie Jingyuan always felt that something would happen that would surprise him.\nWhen Su Miaomiao came out of the gymnasium, her three roommates were already waiting for her outside.\nZhao Lu warmly held Su Miaomiao, Chen Ling and Zhu Xingzhu took turns, and the four girls lined up intimately.\nNot all college students ate in the cafeteria every day. The time was tight in the morning, and at noon and evening, there would be waves of students flocking to restaurants outside the campus.\nZhao Lu touched the scarf around her neck, and said with a smile, \u201cLook, it\u2019s cold when you walk, and your Taoist master rides a bicycle every day, and it will definitely be colder when the wind blows. At this time, if you send him a hand-knitted scarf, he will surely be overwhelmed.\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cMiaomiao, do you know why the gift shop near our university puts woolen yarn in autumn? It\u2019s because many girls give boys scarves to keep for a lifetime, which is so romantic.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was still not confident, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to knit.\u201d She only knew how to play.\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cI know, I will teach you the simplest weaving method, and you can finish weaving in a week.\u201d\nZhao Lu took out the phone and looked at it, and excitedly said, \u201cThe end of the month is Halloween, so it will be your Halloween gift for him.\u201d\nFeeling the oncoming late autumn wind, Su Miaomiao felt that giving a scarf was really practical. If the Taoist master didn\u2019t like it, she could wear it by herself, or if it was too long, she would wear it with the Taoist master.\nAfter eating the steaming noodles, the four girls went to the gift shop talking and laughing.\nThe store was almost full of things that girls liked, including all kinds of shiny accessories, but Su Miaomiao had raised her eyes on those expensive jewelry and diamonds those years, and the plastic products or poor quality jewelry could no longer attract her.\nThere were indeed a lot of woolen yarns in the store, thick and thin, and colorful.\n\u201cWhite? Won\u2019t it get dirty too easily?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao liked white, so she chose five balls of white wool without considering too many other factors.\n\u201cThree are almost enough, right?\u201d\n\u201cI want to knit longer.\u201d\nAfter buying the wool, the girls went straight back to the dormitory.\nZhu Xingzhu was ingenious and knew several scarf weaving methods. First, she searched the Internet for the finished product corresponding to the weaving method, and asked Su Miaomiao to choose the one she liked.\nAfter choosing the style, Zhu Xingzhu started teaching Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao watched her movements with her eyes, and unconsciously twirled her yarn ball in her hands. If Zhao Lu hadn\u2019t reminded her several times that the thread was going to be messed up, Su Miaomiao wouldn\u2019t know how to stop.\nFortunately, she was a century-old cat demon in her previous life, so it was easy to suppress that urge to pull the wool.\nAfter learning, Su Miaomiao sat on her bed and knit the scarf earnestly.\nZhao Lu picked up Su Miaomiao\u2019s phone, took a short video of her, and said with a smile, \u201cI will take a video for you every day, and finally synthesize a complete one. With the scarf, you can also send this video to Xie Jingyuan, if he still doesn\u2019t believe that you have him in your heart, then he is not a Taoist master, but a humanoid tree!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought that her roommates were very nice.\nThe roommates felt that Su Miaomiao really liked Xie Jingyuan.\nHowever, after a while, when Zhao Lu took off her earphones and went to pour water from the water dispenser, she suddenly found that Su Miaomiao, who was knitting a scarf, had fallen asleep with her back leaning against the head of the bed, holding a needle and a yarn in her hand.\nZhao Lu muffled a laugh and signaled the other two roommates to come and see.\nChen Ling: \u201cWell, I suddenly understand why Xie Jingyuan is so insecure.\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cFive balls of wool, won\u2019t they all be useless in the end?\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cMaybe Miaomiao is too tired from training in the afternoon. Hey, I\u2019ll include this part of her too. If Miaomiao ends up knitting the scarf without taking a break, Xie Jingyuan will definitely be more moved.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to wake Miaomiao up?\u201d\n\u201cNo, if Miaomiao really wants to give a gift, she will wake up by herself.\u201d\nThe roommates continued to do their own things, and looked at Su Miaomiao from time to time. After about ten minutes, Su Miaomiao really woke up, stared blankly for a while, and continued to knit the scarf.\nAfter eight o\u2019clock in the evening, Xie Jingyuan rode his bicycle to the dormitory and called Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao just felt a sense of accomplishment in knitting, and wanted to knit a little longer, but the ball of wool was too bulging to take home.\nZhao Lu: \u201cKeep it in the dormitory. Your Taoist master is so smart, so be careful not to be spotted by him, then it won\u2019t be a surprise.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao packed her things and went downstairs with her bag.\nDownstairs, Xie Jingyuan was sitting on the bicycle with his left foot on the ground and his right foot on the pedal.\nHe looked at the bushes in front of him until he heard familiar footsteps before turning into the dormitory building.\nThe first to appear on the stairs were Su Miaomiao\u2019s favorite white shoes.\nShe didn\u2019t like washing clothes, but if she found those little white shoes dirty, she would clean them up at any time. Of course, if Xie Jingyuan was by her side, she would directly stretch her feet in front of him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "165": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-165/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecalling those scenes, Xie Jingyuan smiled.\nIt was no wonder that Su Miaomiao treated him as a cat slave. Some pet owners carefully clean their pet\u2019s paws.\n\u201cHave you finished your homework?\u201d Xie Jingyuan took her bag and asked.\nSu Miaomiao nodded. She had already developed a good habit of self-discipline and study, so she finished her homework before she started knitting the scarf.\nA female student came there, so Xie Jingyuan motioned for Su Miaomiao to sit, as they could talk on the way.\nSu Miaomiao sat in the back seat, and instead of hugging him immediately, she raised her head and used her eyes to estimate the distance between Xie Jingyuan\u2019s neck and her.\nOn the university campus, they rarely walked side by side, and basically rode his bicycle.\nThen the length of the scarf should be enough that two people could wear it together in that case.\nAfter thinking, Su Miaomiao hugged him habitually.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the hands on his waist, and asked her why she suddenly changed her plan.\nSu Miaomiao still had reason for the daytime, and did not leak the secret.\nShe remained like that for the next few days, and stayed in the dormitory when she could study by herself, Xie Jingyuan dispelled his doubts, thinking that she was really just tired of sleeping on the table.\nOn the contrary, a certain professor of Xie Jingyuan who often mingled with the students teased him, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I seen your girlfriend recently, did she dump you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t dumped. It was just that his girlfriend wasn\u2019t so clingy to him anymore.\nOther men and women would usher in a period of passionate love after confirming their relationship, but Su Miaomiao suddenly became indifferent to him.\nHe was very familiar with all kinds of demons and even the sinister human heart, but he had never been involved in the sea of \u200b\u200blove, so naturally he couldn\u2019t explain that phenomenon.\nOn the penultimate night of October, Gu Jialing called Su Miaomiao to 801 to discuss whether to have a special Halloween that year.\nThe three years of high school were very stressful, and he stayed in No. 1 High School for a whole day. Although college life was still busy, for him and Su Miaomiao, there was a lot more free time.\n\u201cTomorrow there will be a Halloween event at the school, and the venue is our playground. Everyone can dress up as they like and participate in it. Shall we go too?\u201d\nSince Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou were too serious, Gu Jialing was the first to encourage Su Miaomiao.\nAs long as Su Miaomiao went, the Taoist master would definitely go. Once the Taoist master did, how could Xu Shou not follow?\nTherefore, winning Su Miaomiao was equivalent to winning the other two.\nFor that reason, Gu Jialing also took the initiative to prepare a box of expensive strawberries for Su Miaomiao, and asked Xie Jingyuan to ripen them in advance.\nSu Miaomiao tasted the sweet strawberries with relish, but she was not very interested in Halloween activities, \u201cDo you want to pretend to be a bird?\u201d\nGu Jialing chuckled, and showed her the picture on the phone.\nFor that Halloween, Gu Jialing specially ordered four sets of spy costumes in advance. His was a gorgeous blue robe with a pair of exaggerated and gorgeous blue wings, and masks with blue feather design.\nSu Miaomiao really couldn\u2019t appreciate that kind of bird.\n\u201cAnd for yours, slide down.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao slid down, and saw that the second one was Xu Shou\u2019s clothes. The robe was brown in the front and black in the back, the straps look thick with a hard dog tail. The mask was the head of a ferocious dog.\nSu Miaomiao was startled, and slid past without observing the details.\nXu Shou standing behind the sofa: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe third one belonged to Su Miaomiao.\nGu Jialing knew Su Miaomiao very well. She was so picky, so he didn\u2019t dare to fool her at all. He carefully ordered a very beautiful ancient style dress for her, with a furry cat tail and a cat head mask. Gu Jialing had seen Su Miaomiao\u2019s original shape, and asked a designer to draw the mask pattern before sending it to the manufacturer. So although the finished product was not as beautiful as Su Miaomiao\u2019s original shape, it could barely satisfy her.\n\u201cThe Taoist master doesn\u2019t have one?\u201d\u00a0\nXu Shou couldn\u2019t stand Su Miaomiao\u2019s narcissism, and urged her to keep sliding.\nSu Miaomiao just swiped the screen.\nThe last one was of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s Taoist crown and Taoist robe. On the black as ink Taoist robe, some complicated Taoist patterns were embroidered with gold thread, and a long sword was attached.\nBecause Gu Jialing still expected that Xie Jingyuan would reimburse him for the expenses, the details of the clothes he designed for him were also very careful.\nSu Miaomiao looked at the familiar Taoist robe silently.\nGu Jialing accompanied her to watch with a look of intoxication, \u201cI\u2019m such a genius, if the four of us dress up like this to attend the Halloween party, everyone would be amazed when we appear on stage.\u201d\nXu Shou felt that among the four outfits, the Taoist master\u2019s was the most beautiful.\nLooking away, Xu Shou asked the person who had been sitting quietly on the single sofa reading a book, \u201cTaoist Master, are you going?\u201d\nGu Jialing also looked up instantly.\nThen, just as he expected, the Taoist master really looked at Su Miaomiao.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So she refused, and turned into the dormitory building with her clothes.\nXu Shou was too serious, and Su Miaomiao was too lazy. It was really boring to participate in those kinds of social activities where they were not active at all.\nHe was a free bird, he was not as clingy as\u00a0 the cat and dog who had to wait for the Taoist master.\nWhistling, Gu Jialing set off in a happy mood, and went to the activity room to change into his blue feather suit that was destined to amaze everyone.\nIn Dormitory 403, Su Miaomiao came in with her outfit, which immediately attracted the attention of her roommates.\nThe antique white long dress was full of fairy aura, and even the cat-head mask could be seen as a bit gorgeous and charming because of its exquisite workmanship.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much interest in Halloween activities, but now I want to go for Miaomiao!\u201d\nBut Su Miaomiao had already sat back on the bed, and skillfully picked up the knitting needle and wool. On her left was a ball of wool the size of an apple, and on her right was a white scarf that had been stacked several times.\n\u201cWait until I finish knitting,\u201d Su Miaomiao looked at her roommates and continued to work.\nThe roommates knew the significance of that gift, and stopped disturbing her, and patted the outfit excitedly.\n\u201cThis tail is so comfortable to the touch. It feels similar to our Tangtang\u2019s. Hey, there is a battery inside, which can control the tail and curl it up!\u201d\nZhao Lu liked the cat\u2019s tail very much, and played with it in her hand.\nSu Miaomiao was distracted several times by the hook of the cat\u2019s tail, and the movements of her hands became faster.\nAt 7:30 in the evening, Su Miaomiao finally finished the three-meter-long white scarf.\nWhen she ran to the bathroom to change clothes, the three roommates took the opportunity to look at her scarf.\n\u201cThree meters, it can pack Xie Jingyuan.\u201d\n\u201cMiaomiao wants to wear it with Xie Jingyuan.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea is quite romantic, but won\u2019t it really strangle her neck?\u201d\n\u201cThat depends on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s riding skills. Otherwise, if he falls, he would fall bad. Hey, will the traffic policeman stop them if he sees it?\u201d\n\u201cBut white is so pretty, I want to knit a white one.\u201d\nThe roommates were in full swing, and the bathroom door finally opened again.\nNot only did Su Miaomiao change into that ancient white dress, she also spread out her ponytail and combed her hair into a matching bun.\nIn her previous life, the banshees she had seen were very good at dressing up. Su Miaomiao also learned some hair combing skills after she was able to change her form, so as not to keep her long hair loose and get caught by branches when running.\nShe was beautiful enough in modern clothes, but in ancient clothes, it was another kind of stunning beauty, as if she had just traveled from ancient time and space.\nZhao Lu: \u201cOutsiders always say that the dormitory of our Beijing University is shabby. I didn\u2019t feel it before. Now, I think our dormitory is not worthy of Miaomiao\u2019s suit.\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cThat\u2019s right, I want to take a picture of Miaomiao, but when I look at the background behind, it\u2019s really a hindrance!\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, let\u2019s go outside to take pictures later!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao just laughed, impatiently put on her cat-head mask, and then fastened her tail to the belt behind the long skirt.\nXu Shou disliked the dog tail that Gu Jialing prepared for him, but Su Miaomiao liked it very much.\nIn the past, when she was alone and had nothing to do, her tail was her best toy, and she could play with it anytime, anywhere.\nThe mask was designed with two cute cat ears. After wearing it, only Su Miaomiao\u2019s peach-colored lips and chin were exposed.\nHer eyes were clear, but the ends of her eyes were slightly raised, which were almost exactly the same shape as the cat\u2019s eyes on the mask. The mysteriousness doubled her charming effect at that moment.\nSu Miaomiao usually wore a simple ponytail, with her plain face facing the sky, giving people a very pure feeling. Who knew she could actually be so charming?!\n\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful, so beautiful, let\u2019s go down quickly, I\u2019m going to take pictures of you like crazy!\u201d\nGirls liked to look at handsome guys, but they actually preferred to look at beautiful women.\nChen Ling and Zhu Xingzhu stopped what they were doing, and walked out of the dormitory with both Zhao Lu and Su Miaomiao.\nNot long after the four of them went out, a girl screamed excitedly in the corridor, so many female students poked their heads out from the dormitories on both sides, and then chased after Su Miaomiao, admiring her beautiful outfit.\nOn the way to the playground, the roommates picked out a bunch of places suitable for taking pictures, and turned into crazy photographers. When they finally came to the playground where the Halloween event was held, Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou were about to finish their classes.\nGu Jialing called Su Miaomiao and said that he would deliver clothes to those two first, and the four of them would gather at the southwest entrance of the playground later.\nZhao Lu: \u201cWhat are they going to wear?\u201d\nThe group of four looked good. If the three boys also looked like that in ancient costumes, it would be too pleasing to the eye.\nThe more Zhao Lu thought about it, the more she looked forward to it.\nSu Miaomiao introduced calmly, \u201cXu Shou is a dog, Gu Jialing is a blue bird, and the Taoist master is the Taoist master.\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cAre you four playing New Journey to the West with us?\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cHahahaha!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao remembered \u201cJourney to the West\u201d that she had read with Grandma Tao when she was a child, and immediately said, \u201cThe Taoist master is more handsome than Tang Seng!\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cI should really record your words\u2026 Hey, look, Iron Man!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The blue macaw from Rio?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao clarified for Gu Jialing, \u201cIt\u2019s not a parrot, it\u2019s a blue bird.\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cThis is Gu Jialing? I didn\u2019t notice that he is so flirtatious. By the way, why didn\u2019t I see your Taoist master?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cBlocked by his wings.\u201d\nRoommates: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing was not a normal blue bird, but a blue bird demon, so he was so big!\nHe swaggered for a long time, and when he was only a few meters away from the girls, Gu Jialing first retracted his left wing, revealing Xu Shou wearing a dog mask.\nZhao Lu and the others: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe dog mask looked so fierce!\n\u201cDid he slap the werewolf boy from Twilight?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIt\u2019s not a wolf, it\u2019s a dog.\u201d\nAt that time, Gu Jialing retracted his right wing again.\nBecause the three were all animals, so even though she revealed that Xie Jingyuan would be the Taoist master, Zhao Lu and the others first envisioned an animal version of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s image, and because of that, when the blue wings slowly retracted, revealing Xie Jingyuan with a long sword on his back and a fairy-like black robe, the three roommates all opened their mouths in shock.\nEven though the surroundings were full of strange costumes, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s appearance as a Taoist still caught everyone\u2019s eyes.\nXie Jingyuan himself also had an extraordinary aura. Wherever he passed, the loudly speaking students fell silent, and the passionately jumping students couldn\u2019t help but stand firm, and all eyes followed Xie Jingyuan.\nSu Miaomiao stared blankly at Xie Jingyuan who was walking toward her.\nShe remembered the first time the two met in the brothel. The first time she saw this Taoist master, she thought he was handsome.\nShe liked beautiful trees, beautiful grass, and beautiful people.\nBut just after she gave a teasing comment, Xie Jingyuan drew out his sword, the blade was as cold as his cold eyes.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s liking for him turned into fear.\nWhen she entered Qingxu Temple and was sure that Xie Jingyuan would not kill her for no reason, she liked to hide in a corner and watch him secretly, liked to sleep under his bed when he was not around, and liked the smell left by him. But she was even more afraid of Xie Jingyuan, so afraid that she would run away as soon as he came back.\nThat day, Xie Jingyuan seemed to have become the Taoist master who frightened her again.\nSu Miaomiao subconsciously hid behind Zhao Lu.\nXie Jingyuan paused.\nThe next second, Zhao Lu pulled Su Miaomiao out with a smile, \u201cYou two are childhood sweethearts, so why be shy?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was not shy, she lowered her head uneasily.\nEven when he finally came to her side, she still kept her eyes down.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing have seen her like that before, and they could understand Su Miaomiao\u2019s mood in view of the Taoist master\u2019s attire.\nGu Jialing gloated and said, \u201cAre you afraid? You usually show off your power, but when you see the Taoist master, you get honest.\u201d\nWhen Xie Jingyuan glanced at him lightly, he snorted, \u201cOkay, go on your own, I\u2019m going to participate in tonight\u2019s S contest!\u201d\nHe had already played most of the time alone, and there would be the most important voting session later, so he had to hurry up and show his wings to canvass votes.\nZhao Lu stopped him, \u201cWait, let me take a group picture for you!\u201d\nOnly then did Gu Jialing stay.\nZhao Lu asked him to stand at the back and spread out his two big wings.\nXie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao stood on the left side of Gu Jialing, and Xu Shou stood on the right side by himself.\nRegarding Zhao Lu\u2019s arrangement, Xu Shou pursed his lips.\nHe was still silently unhappy, and then he heard Zhao Lu arrange for the Taoist master again, \u201cXie Jingyuan, don\u2019t be so rigid, raise your hand, with Miaomiao in your arms.\u201d\nXu Shou\u2019s face darkened even more, but it was a pity that no one could see it because it was blocked by the mask.\nXie Jingyuan smiled helplessly, and then hugged Su Miaomiao\u2019s waist cooperatively.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help leaning against him, smelling the smell of new clothes and the autumn dew on his body.\n\u201cIs it cold?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked suddenly, his voice was very low.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head. The ancient dress looked elegant, but it was actually very warm inside.\nIt may be that Xie Jingyuan\u2019s tone of concern was completely different from that of his previous self, that Su Miaomiao was finally not so afraid of him.\n\u201cCome on, look at me!\u201d Zhao Lu directed enthusiastically.\nThe group of four looked at the camera with different expressions.\nZhao Lu took three pictures in a row.\nGu Jialing still had that coquettish expression of \u201cthe most beautiful bird in the world\u201d.\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to take off the mask, someone touched her ear lightly. She raised her head, and it happened that Xie Jingyuan had already taken off the mask, allowing her to see that handsome face without any concealment.\nIt was the Taoist master who no longer reprimanded her fiercely.\nFeeling better, Su Miaomiao leaned into his arms more naturally, and smiled sweetly at the camera in Zhao Lu\u2019s hand.\nAfter taking pictures, Gu Jialing immediately went to participate in the S contest.\nXie Jingyuan said to Xu Shou, \u201cGo and watch over him.\u201d\nXu Shou understood that the Taoist master was afraid that Gu Jialing would attract girls and mess with them.\nWearing a mask, Xu Shou, exuding a dangerous aura, looked in the direction Gu Jialing left from. The crowded college students quickly overwhelmed him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The college students either went to the playground, or hurried back to the dormitory. There were not many pedestrians on the road.\nBecause he was wearing \u201cextraordinary clothes\u201d, Xie Jingyuan chose a remote road. He had to go back to the teaching building to change clothes, get his bag, and pick up his bicycle.\nHe held her hand just because he was afraid that she would be squeezed by others, but when it was just the two of them, Xie Jingyuan let go of her hand a long time ago.\nThe relationship was confirmed, but he was not used to taking the initiative to do that kind of intimacy.\nHe was not used to it, but Su Miaomiao was very used to it, hugging his arm, and tilting her head to look at his face from time to time.\nPassing a street light, Xie Jingyuan stopped, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\nUnder the cat-head mask, Su Miaomiao\u2019s eyes were smiling, \u201cTaoist Master, the way you\u2019re like now is very similar to your previous life.\u201d\nThe Taoist crown covered his short hair, and he wore a long robe and a long sword on his back. He was almost the Taoist master of the previous life.\nXie Jingyuan remembered her dodge on the playground, and asked in a low voice, \u201cWere you afraid of me at that time?\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, he saw her lips purse slightly, and she said aggrievedly, \u201cOf course I was afraid. Taoist Master, you used to always scold me with your eyes.\u201d\nHow could he not know how sharp his eyes were?\n\u201cSince you are afraid, how dare you sneak into my room even after I did that?\u201d\nGu Jialing also twittered and sang on the tree in his yard, deliberately showing off his feathers, hoping to stay in the Taoist master\u2019s room, but after he coldly refused, he never dared to come again.\nSu Miaomiao said with a smile, \u201cYou smell good, and I slept better with it.\u201d\nHis sense of smell was mediocre, and he didn\u2019t find that he had any good smell.\nAs soon as the thought came to her mind, Su Miaomiao suddenly rushed over, grabbed his shoulders with both hands, stood on tiptoe, and sucked hard on his neck.\nWhen Su Miaomiao saw it, she opened her mouth and bit it, of course it was just a light bite. As long as the Taoist master didn\u2019t make her angry, she wouldn\u2019t hurt the Taoist master.\nBut even if she wanted to use force, she didn\u2019t have that chance. Almost when she touched Xie Jingyuan, he held her shoulders and turned her around.\nXie Jingyuan looked around, including some windows of nearby teaching buildings.\nAfter returning to the teaching building where Xie Jingyuan took evening classes, he picked up the clothes on the table and went to change.\nA few minutes later, he turned into Xie Jingyuan, a top student in modern attire.\nSu Miaomiao touched the skirt on her and asked him, \u201cDo you like the original clothes?\u201d\nShe was in no hurry to switch back.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to attract people\u2019s attention.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cBut I think you look better in Taoist robe.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t say anything, and put the Taoist robe and so on into his bag. The props and swords were too long, so he could only continue to carry them on his back.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t have any props, so she grabbed her own cat\u2019s tail and showed it to him, \u201cLook, it can also be raised.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan just watched the cat\u2019s tail, which was very similar to her original shape, dangling in front of him.\nAt that time, a college student suddenly opened the door. Maybe he still wanted to find a classroom for self-study, but he didn\u2019t expect to see such a private scene as soon as he opened the door.\nHe apologized with a blushing face, and quickly closed the door and walked away.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe was only glad that it wasn\u2019t a classmate in their class, and he was also glad that Su Miaomiao was still wearing a mask, not showing her face.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Xie Jingyuan picked up his bag, turned around and walked out.\nNo one watched her play with her tail anymore, so Su Miaomiao had no choice but to chase after him.\nIt was much faster to go back to the dormitory building by riding a bicycle.\nDownstairs in the dormitory, Xie Jingyuan reminded Su Miaomiao, \u201cCome down after changing your clothes.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, and her big eyes clearly expressed her emotions.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cDon\u2019t wear the tail anymore.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao reluctantly agreed.\nShe walked briskly back to the dormitory.\nWhen Zhao Lu saw her, she said in surprise, \u201cThe party isn\u2019t over yet, you two aren\u2019t going on a date?\u201d\nThey all knew that Xie Jingyuan was a genius, and Su Miaomiao also had training on weekends. The two had almost no time for a formal date, so they thought they would cherish the night.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIt\u2019s too late, we have to go back.\u201d\nShe reluctantly took off the tail and put it in her bag together with the white scarf. In order to make room, she put all the books in the dormitory, and her roommates would help her take them to the classroom the next day.\nChen Ling: \u201cHave you noticed that Miaomiao\u2019s tail and scarf are the same color, and they are almost indistinguishable when put together.\u201d\nZhao Lu read romance novels all the time. So when she looked at the cat mask that Su Miaomiao was still wearing, she smiled and said, \u201cIf our Miaomiao was a cat demon, this scarf may be equivalent to giving a tail to Xie Jingyuan, right?\u201d\nBoth Chen Ling and Zhu Xingzhu got very romantic.\nOnly Su Miaomiao felt that it was unrealistic, \u201cI will not give my tail to the Taoist master.\u201d\nNo matter how much she liked someone, she wouldn\u2019t give her tail away. If the Taoist master really forced her to cut off her tail, she would run away.\nWhen Su Miaomiao was about to leave, Zhao Lu reminded her, \u201cRemember to show Xie Jingyuan that video first!\u201d\nThe roommates advised Su Miaomiao on how to give gifts and when.\nSu Miaomiao smiled and opened the dormitory door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If he could distinguish carefully, there was Gu Jialing\u2019s loud and cheerful singing.\nXie Jingyuan smiled helplessly.\nSometimes he hoped that the personalities of Gu Jialing and Xu Shou could be neutralized, one was too lively and the other was too silent.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t mind whether he had friends or not, but he hoped that Xu Shou could make more friends and pursue a life that belonged to him instead of treating him as his master all the time.\nHowever, if Xu Shou liked following him, he would not force him to leave.\nSu Miaomiao also thought of Xu Shou, \u201cWhere\u2019s his tail?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cHe put it in his bag.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI thought he would throw it into\u00a0 the trash can.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t tell Su Miaomiao, but he could tell that Xu Shou also liked that dog tail very much, but his pride didn\u2019t allow him to wear it to show off like her.\nSu Miaomiao said, giggling, \u201cIt\u2019s good to keep it, you can use it as a feather duster to clean off the dust.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cDon\u2019t always provoke him.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hummed, \u201cLook, I just said a few words casually, you got so partial to him again.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe bicycle drove into the lakeside community.\nWhen going upstairs, Xie Jingyuan pinched Su Miaomiao\u2019s bag, but he didn\u2019t pay attention to it just now, but then he felt that the things inside didn\u2019t look like books.\nSu Miaomiao, seeing that, grabbed the bag and explained, \u201cIt\u2019s my cat tail!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe wouldn\u2019t snatch her tail.\nWalking to the door of 802, Su Miaomiao took out the key, and said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cMy green plants need to be watered, you help me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t think too much, and followed her into 802.\nTurning on the light in the living room, Su Miaomiao casually put the mask on the porch cabinet, then went to the bedroom with her bag in her arms, and told Xie Jingyuan not to leave after watering the plants, then she slammed the bedroom door and locked it.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the bedroom door strangely.\nDid she just lock it?\nShe had never been private in front of him. If she hadn\u2019t been reminded repeatedly since she was a child, Su Miaomiao would have dared to change clothes in front of him.\nHe first went to water a few pots of green plants.\nAfter a few minutes, Su Miaomiao called him into the bedroom.\nXie Jingyuan put away the watering tool and walked over.\nThe door was ajar, and there was a light inside. After making sure that Su Miaomiao was well dressed and standing in front of the desk, Xie Jingyuan pushed the door open and entered.\n\u201cZhao Lu made a video for me that I\u2019ll show to you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao set up the chair and signaled for Xie Jingyuan to sit down quickly. The laptop screen on the table was already turned on, and there was a video file.\nZhao Lu\u2026\nAt that moment, some scenes that might not be suitable for him appeared in his mind.\n\u201cWhat video?\u201d Xie Jingyuan\u2019s face turned cold when he spoke.\nIf Zhao Lu secretly took a video of Su Miaomiao that shouldn\u2019t be taken, he would stop Su Miaomiao from continuing to communicate with her.\nShe shouldn\u2019t be friends with people who didn\u2019t respect her privacy.\nSu Miaomiao thought he was dawdling, so she pulled him onto the chair impatiently, \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d\nThe roommates said that the video may make the Taoist master\u2019s heart move more than the gift.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan sat down, Su Miaomiao opened the file with a smile and played it in full screen.\nThe part in front of the screen was a dark background, which seemed to be specially reserved for the preparation time of the viewers.\nXie Jingyuan saw his face reflected on the screen, which looked very cold.\nThe next second, soft background music sounded, and the image finally appeared.\nHe saw Su Miaomiao sitting on the bed in the dormitory. She had an obedient and quiet face, and became even more obedient as she knitted.\nThe rhythm of the music was gentle, and Su Miaomiao on the screen also had changes in movements.\nSometimes she knitted very seriously, sometimes she fell asleep while knitting, sometimes she looked up at her roommates, and seemed to be aroused by their words and deeds, sometimes she was aroused by the sunlight coming in from the window. She then moved her eyes and turned to the bed.\nXie Jingyuan kept looking at her face until the scarf in her hand had reached a certain length, then he realized that she was knitting a scarf.\nThe background was constantly changing, sometimes it was sunny, and sometimes it was dark outside the window.\nAnd Xie Jingyuan\u2019s gaze was always fixed on Su Miaomiao\u2019s body, or her face, or her hands.\nWhen the scarf was finished, Su Miaomiao disappeared, and the scene was frozen on the snow-white scarf.\nAt that moment, a white cloth fell around him, wrapping around his neck softly.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and saw the scarf in the video.\nIt was snow white and soft, like the white cat fur she had in her previous life.\nThe warm, sunny aura was something she had had in her two lifetimes.\nThe background sound of the video was still going on:\n\u201cDarling, don\u2019t be afraid. I have loved you for a thousand years.\u201d\nWhen Xie Jingyuan was watching the video, Su Miaomiao was sitting on the edge of the bed behind him, taking out the scarf hidden in advance from under the quilt with her backhand.\nWhen the video stopped on the scarf, Su Miaomiao also stood up quietly, lowered the scarf from above, and hung it gently on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulders.\nWith her arms around his neck, Su Miaomiao said with her head tilted, \u201cSurprise!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan raised his eyes and met her clear and bright eyes with joy and anticipation.\nIt turned out that sincerity could be as hot as fire, and it was so hot that it was difficult for him to fight it after thirty-four years of practice in two lives.\n\u201cDid you always stay in the dormitory just to knit the scarf?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYes, you didn\u2019t believe that I like you, so I just wanted to do something to make you believe it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Although the video was frozen, the images of her quietly weaving the scarf were already imprinted in his mind.\n\u201cZhao Lu said that you ride a bicycle every day, so a scarf will be better in the wind. Look, I\u2019ve been knitting for such a long time, so we can wear it together.\u201d\nWhile talking, Su Miaomiao tidied up the loosely hanging scarf for him, and then pulled the other end of the scarf around her neck.\nShe deliberately walked further away, and a part hung down between the two of them to ensure that she would not strangle her neck when riding a bicycle.\nAfter Su Miaomiao finished showing, she returned to him with a smile, and hugged his waist, \u201cHow is it? Do you believe that I love you now?\u201d\nMaybe Su Miaomiao\u2019s liking for him was not the love between men and women, but she really liked him, otherwise she would not have patiently weaved such a long scarf.\nShe may not have the habits of ordinary cats, but she did retain some habits from her previous life.\nWith Su Miaomiao\u2019s personality, if he bought a few balls of wool and put them in 801, once Su Miaomiao saw them, she would definitely mess up the balls of wool.\nBecause she loved him and wanted to give him a gift, she restrained that urge.\nBecause she loved him even when her training was so tiring, she would give up the free time she could sleep and spend all of it knitting the scarf.\nBecause she wanted to prove her love, she didn\u2019t cling to him for a whole week, but ran back to the dormitory.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHearing his affirmation, Su Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up, and then her eyes fell on his lips, \u201cCan you teach me how to kiss?\u201d\nHe explained in a low voice, \u201cTwo people who like each other would indeed kiss, but it happens naturally on specific occasions, and there is no need for deliberate teaching.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, \u201cBut I want to learn now, you teach me first, then when I want to kiss you, I can kiss you directly.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at those clean eyes that were thirsty for knowledge, and found it difficult to kiss.\nEven if she was not just eighteen years old, even if she was still a cat demon who had lived for a hundred years, thinking of teaching her that, Xie Jingyuan still felt guilty for coaxing her.\nXie Jingyuan tried to divert her mind, and asked, \u201cYou haven\u2019t said why you love me.\u201d\nTo his question, Su Miaomiao answered honestly, \u201cYou are so good-looking and smell good, so I love you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was a little surprised, \u201cJust because of these? Isn\u2019t it because I treat you well?\u201d\nHe thought she would put \u201ctreating her well\u201d first.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, and said seriously, \u201cI liked you as soon as you appeared in my previous life, but you were too fierce, so I dared not approach you.\u201d\nHe thought of the cat sleeping under his bed, and of her who was always peeping at him secretly.\nHe understood that at that time Su Miaomiao\u2019s liking was as pure as it was in human life, and she just wanted to stick by his side.\nMaybe, that was how she loved him.\n\u201cBesides me, have you ever liked anyone else?\u201d Xie Jingyuan held her waist with one hand, and brushed her hair behind her ears with the other, \u201cOther people, or demons.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head.\nMale demons were too stinky, not to mention rabbits and foxes, even male cats had a smell that she couldn\u2019t stand.\nAs for humans, she hadn\u2019t seen many of them. Maybe they didn\u2019t smell bad, but none of them smelled good to her, let alone none of their faces could compare to Xie Jingyuan.\nGu Jialing was good-looking and smelled good, but when she saw him, she just wanted to bully him, hold the little bird under her paws, and watch his wings flutter.\n\u201cI only like you.\u201d\nLooking into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes, Su Miaomiao was honest and firm.\nThe mesmerizing skills of a century-old cat demon couldn\u2019t break the practice of the master of Qingxu Temple, but those few words were enough.\nXie Jingyuan flicked his fingers to the switch on the wall at the door.\nThe white switch was pressed by spiritual power and made a \u201cclick\u201d.\nThe lights dimmed in response, and the brightness of the room was replaced by darkness. Even the notebook on the desk went black because it had not been operated for a long time.\nSu Miaomiao felt that her waist was being lifted up by the Taoist master, and she obeyed the force and stood on tiptoe.\nThe familiar breath surrounded her, and she was evaporated by the warm sun.\nSu Miaomiao had always liked to bask in the sun. She liked the warm sun in autumn under which she could stay comfortably for a long time, under the shade of trees until the heat was unbearable at noon.\nAt that moment he had become that bright autumn day.\nThe heat piled up layer by layer, Su Miaomiao\u2019s whole body was going to be melted by the Taoist master, and there was also a strange feeling of suffocation, she was about to be out of breath.\nGrabbing his shoulders with both hands, Su Miaomiao protested.\nLike a squeamish cat, her voice was also soft, continuously tapping on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s body with one whimper and one hum.\nIt was like a fire.\nWhen Su Miaomiao was about to use her nails, Xie Jingyuan let her go with difficulty.\nShe heard his heavy breathing, like a beast chasing prey, greedy and dangerous, it was bound to hunt.\nSu Miaomiao was inexplicably frightened. She wanted to run away, but when she stepped back, her calf hit the bed, and she fell down without warning.\nXie Jingyuan wanted to hold her back, but at that moment, the scarf around his neck tightened.\nThe wide and large bed had a soft mattress surface and was full of elasticity inside.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t fall in pain, but was pressed deeply into the bed by Xie Jingyuan who followed closely.\nShe writhed uncomfortably.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s breathing became heavier.\nBefore she could react, and before he could restrain himself, he untied the scarf around his neck as quickly as possible and jumped out of bed.\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d His concern was far duller than usual.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, still feeling dizzy.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom. If you\u2019re sleepy, go to sleep.\u201d\nAfter speaking, he walked away quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After her eyes got used to the darkness, she gradually saw the light in the middle of the ceiling clearly, and her thoughts became clear again.\nShe touched her lips.\nWas that the kissing that both men and women liked?\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s mood became complicated. At first she was fine, but later she always felt that the Taoist master had turned into a demon who wanted to eat her.\nAfter regaining her strength, Su Miaomiao took off the scarf around her neck, got out of bed, and turned on the light.\nThe bedroom was still the same as before, but the scarf was piled up on the bed in a mess, and the quilt also showed signs of being crushed.\nSu Miaomiao walked out of the room.\nShe stopped at the door of the bathroom, and out of curiosity, she pressed her ear to the door.\nBefore she could hear anything, the faucet was turned on, and the water started to run.\nShe picked up her phone and sat on the sofa.\nThe roommates said that if the gift-giving was successful, she had to tell them the good news.\nShe opened the chat group \u201c403 is full of fairies\u201d and sent a message: Success.\nAfter waiting for a few seconds, the roommates popped up like mushrooms after the rain.\nZhao Lu: So fast? Xie Jingyuan is finally willing to believe that you love him?\nSu Miaomiao: Well, he believed it. Thank you. I will treat you to milk tea tomorrow.\nWhen Zhao Lu got her part-time job income, she invited them to drink milk tea.\nChen Ling: Milk tea is not important. Hey, did you two kiss?\nSu Miaomiao: Yes.\nZhu Xingzhu: What did it feel like? Tell us quickly!\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, and still answered honestly: It\u2019s not very comfortable.\nThe chat group was silent for a second, and then started bubbling again.\nZhao Lu: It\u2019s normal. After all, it\u2019s the first time for both of you. It is said that kissing skills need to be practiced, and practice makes perfect.\nChen Ling: Yes, yes, Miaomiao, you have to have confidence in your Taoist master. With his IQ, his skills will be maxed out soon.\nZhu Xingzhu: Ahem, I have a friend who got hit by her boyfriend\u2019s teeth during the first kiss, and her gums bled!\nSu Miaomiao was still reading the messages of her roommates making jokes, when Xie Jingyuan came out from the bathroom.\nSu Miaomiao was a little thirsty and said casually, \u201cI want to drink water.\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, she continued to look at the phone.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe had imagined so many embarrassing scenes that may happen when she saw him and thought of how to respond, but it was completely useless.\n\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Xie Jingyuan was observing her while filling a cup of water, seeing her laughing and surprised at times, he asked curiously.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI\u2019m chatting with my roommates.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes changed slightly.\nHe apologized for suspecting that Zhao Lu secretly took a video of Su Miaomiao secretly, but why would Su Miaomiao talk to her roommates at that time?\nWhen he walked to Su Miaomiao and sat down, she took the cup from his hand.\nXie Jingyuan took her phone and asked, \u201cCan I have a look?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nHe swiped the screen and only looked at the content of their chat in the past few minutes.\nAfter drinking the water, Su Miaomiao leaned against him and read it with him, laughing amusedly, \u201cSomeone tore his partner\u2019s lips!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWas that the point?\nHe returned the phone to Su Miaomiao, and explained calmly, \u201cThe intimacy between lovers is private, so don\u2019t talk about such things in the future.\u201d\nPerhaps the friendship of the girls allowed them to share some little secrets, Zhao Lu and the other two did not deliberately inquire about any details. Xie Jingyuan was worried that Su Miaomiao would reveal too much unintentionally. Kiss was okay, but rest\u2026\n\u201cWell, I remember.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t need to worry, Su Miaomiao told her roommates goodnight and put down her phone.\nWhen her eyes fell on his face again, Xie Jingyuan lowered his eyes evasively.\nHe had just mopped the floor the day before, and it was clean, reflecting the light from the living room.\nThe words said in the chat popped into his mind, so he finally looked at Su Miaomiao again, \u201cDid you feel uncomfortable?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao curled her lips, \u201cIt was okay at first, but you kissed too hard later, so I couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026I will pay attention to it in the future.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao still preferred to use licking, hugged his neck and said, \u201cTaoist Master, kissing is uncomfortable, shall I teach you to lick?\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, she rushed to lick his lips.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe still wanted to press her into his arms more to make her less comfortable.\nSeeing that he was stiff, Su Miaomiao guessed that he didn\u2019t like it, and snorted, \u201cForget it, you like to kiss but you have to improve your kissing skills quickly, and you can not kiss like tonight. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan responded with a complicated expression.\nSu Miaomiao knew that he was very smart and could learn everything quickly, so she jumped off the sofa with confidence, went to the bedroom and took the long scarf out, \u201cTake it back. Taoist Master, remember to wear it tomorrow morning.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan remembered the accident just now, and was a little worried, \u201cWill it strangle your neck if you wear it together?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, I have measured everything, and I will untie it before you stop the cycle.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan no longer objected, after all, that was her wish.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sleepy too.\u201d\nIn order to weave the scarf, Su Miaomiao sacrificed a lot of sleep time in the past week.\nSu Miaomiao would never send Xie Jingyuan out. He left with his bag and prop sword in one hand and a scarf in the other.\nUntil he returned to his room in 801, her words were still echoing in his ears.\n\u201cI\u2019m sleepy too.\u201d\nWithin a few minutes of the first kiss between the two, she was sleepy.\nAt eleven o\u2019clock in the evening, Gu Jialing and Xu Shou finally came back from university.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With that high-profile blue feather suit, a singing voice comparable to the original singer\u2019s outstanding appearance, Gu Jialing won the championship of that contest with a high number of votes.\nThe champion got a trophy, made of crystal clear glass, with the official certification of Beijing University.\nHolding the trophy, Gu Jialing excitedly pushed open the door of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room, \u201cLook, Taoist Master, I won the championship!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan who was reading a book glanced at him lightly.\nAfraid that he might not see it clearly, Gu Jialing put the trophy on the desk so that Xie Jingyuan could appreciate it up close.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t be so disappointed, I can do my homework tomorrow morning. After all, tonight I won an honor for our Qingxu Temple!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t need that kind of honor, let alone Qingxu Temple.\nGu Jialing looked at his face and snorted, \u201cWhen Su Miaomiao won the championship, the Taoist master didn\u2019t look like this.\u201d\nXu Shou outside the door couldn\u2019t listen anymore, \u201cCan your competition compare with hers?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be compared? They are both competitions, there is no distinction between high and low!\u201d\nXu Shou immediately pulled Gu Jialing out, and thoughtfully closed the door from the outside.\nGu Jialing looked at the door panel and whispered to Xu Shou, \u201cWhy do I feel that something is wrong with the Taoist master?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThe Taoist master doesn\u2019t like to be disturbed when reading.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cExcept for Su Miaomiao! Hmph, no matter what she does, he will not get angry.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cAfter all, she is a girl now, and the Taoist master grew up with her, so they have a brother-sister relationship.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cSpecies discrimination plus gender discrimination, I\u2019m going to the Taoist Management Association to file a complaint against him!\u201d\nWhen Xie Jingyuan heard Xu Shou\u2019s \u201cbrother-sister relationship\u201d, his froze.\nThe next day was Friday, and the four had to go to university.\nWhen they met in the corridor, Xie Jingyuan saw that Su Miaomiao\u2019s expression was normal, so he calmed down.\nThey got downstairs, and the three boys came over with their bicycles.\nSu Miaomiao used to run over and jump into the backseat of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bicycle, but that day he deliberately stopped in front of her.\nXu Shou subconsciously supported the bicycle with his feet, and Gu Jialing rode forward slowly, but his head was also tilted.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the scarf?\u201d Su Miaomiao looked at his bag.\nHe had no choice but to unzip his bag and take out the big scarf that he had folded several times so he could stuff it in.\nWith a \u201ccreak\u201d, Gu Jialing also stopped, turned around, and looked at the two of them suspiciously.\nSu Miaomiao put one end for Xie Jingyuan first, and she stood around to wrap the other end, and then rode the bicycle with satisfaction.\nA long white scarf tied the two of them together.\nAfter all, Xie Jingyuan had made psychological preparations in advance, so his expression at that time was as cold and indifferent as ever.\nGu Jialing rode back and laughed loudly at the appearance of the two of them, \u201cTaoist Master, you two are like grasshoppers tied to the same rope!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glared at Gu Jialing, \u201cBe careful I\u2019ll string you up like a bird on a rope!\u201d\nGu Jialing deliberately approached her, \u201cYou do it. If you have the ability, come here.\u201d\nHe was still worried that Su Miaomiao would really pounce on him, but with such a scarf wrapped around her neck, if she would jump, it may strangle the Taoist master!\nWhen Su Miaomiao was about to untie the scarf, Gu Jialing hurriedly rode to the other side of Xu Shou.\nXu Shou stared at the scarf with a complicated expression, and asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cDid you buy it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao raised her chin triumphantly, \u201cI bought the wool, wove it myself, and gave it to the Taoist master as a Halloween gift.\u201d\nGu Jialing called again, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you prepare a gift for me?\u201d\nNo one paid attention to him, Xu Shou looked at the Taoist master sympathetically, what kind of gift was it, it was more of a shackle.\nThe Taoist master was just too used to Su Miaomiao, and he wanted to indulge her in mischief regardless of his safety.\nXu Shou gave Su Miaomiao a traffic safety lesson in a serious manner for a few minutes.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t appreciate it, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Taoist master is riding a bicycle.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026 There can always be accidents.\u201d\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to refute, she suddenly remembered the accident that happened the previous night, so she couldn\u2019t speak.\nAfter thinking for a moment, Su Miaomiao untied the scarf on her own end, and wrapped it loosely around her neck without knotting it, and put her head on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back.\nWithout a security threat, Xu Shou had no reason to object.\nAt that time, Gu Jialing approached him and said in a low voice, \u201cI know why the Taoist master was strange last night. It\u2019s because the scarf that Su Miaomiao gave him is so stupid to be worn like that.\u201d\nXu Shou acquiesced, after all, apart from that, there was no other reason, and there were very few things in that world that could affect the mood of the Taoist master.\nXie Jingyuan played tennis with Su Miaomiao for an hour as before. After the exercise, he felt hot all over, and put the scarf back into his bag when he was riding a bicycle.\nBut when he came to pick up Su Miaomiao to go to the cafeteria at noon, although he was not cold, he still put on a scarf. At the same time, in order to prevent the scarf from getting caught in the bicycle, he wrapped it around his neck a few times.\nAfter making the phone call, Xie Jingyuan was waiting for her downstairs in front of the dormitory.\nThe roommates also went to the cafeteria and came down with Su Miaomiao.\nSeeing the big scarf around Xie Jingyuan\u2019s neck, Zhao Lu asked, \u201cMiaomiao, is that the scarf you wovened?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan smiled, as a response to her teasing.\nHe was more worried about whether the girls would laugh at his kissing skills, but fortunately the three just smiled ambiguously and left first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If Gu Jialing could calm down and weave the scarf, they would have more peace.\nComing out of the cafeteria, the four went in three different directions as usual.\nXie Jingyuan rode the bicycle to the main road of the university, and then headed toward the outside.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cAren\u2019t you going to the university building?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you want to treat your roommates to milk tea?\u201d\nZhao Lu and the others were all eager to help, especially the video that Zhao Lu edited for Su Miaomiao, which required skill and patience.\nHe and Su Miaomiao really wanted to express their gratitude to the roommates who had given them so much advice.\n\u201cIf they are free on weekends, you can invite them over to have hot pot together.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan felt that only a cup of milk tea to show their gratitude was too little.\nInviting the roommates to eat hot pot in the lakeside community could not only express sincerity, but also indirectly tell them that Su Miaomiao and him were still indeed together, so as to avoid misunderstanding.\nSu Miaomiao listened to him.\nSeveral milk tea stores opened near the university. Su Miaomiao asked the roommates which one and what flavor they wanted in the chat group.\nZhao Lu: Taoist Xie\u2019s treat?\nSu Miaomiao: Yes.\nZhao Lu: Haha, then we will accept!\nThe girls chose the store they liked, and sent her the flavors they wanted to drink.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan parked his bicycle on the side of the road, Su Miaomiao took his arm and walked toward the milk tea store. She saw a couple of college students waiting for milk tea. When the girl raised her head to talk to the boy, the boy lowered his head and quickly kissed the girl on the lips. The girl glared at him while blushing, and the boy put one hand in his pocket and another around the girl, smiling happily.\nSu Miaomiao thought human couples really liked kissing.\nThe couple bought milk tea and left talking and laughing. Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan stepped forward instead.\nShe looked at her phone, read out the milk tea ordered by her roommates, and then ordered a cup of \u201cstrawberry fresh milk\u201d for herself.\n\u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d Su Miaomiao raised her head and asked.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her and said, \u201cI won\u2019t drink.\u201d\nUnder normal circumstances, he could look away after speaking, but Xie Jingyuan saw Su Miaomiao blink her lower eyelids at him, and then slightly opened her lips.\nOf course Xie Jingyuan also saw what the couple of college students did just a while ago.\nHe turned his eyes away, pressed Su Miaomiao\u2019s head, and asked her to look into the milk tea store.\nSu Miaomiao was unhappy, and raised her head again, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to kiss me?\u201d\nFortunately, the mixer in the milk tea store started working, and the employees inside probably didn\u2019t hear what Su Miaomiao said.\nXie Jingyuan whispered while scanning the QR code to pay, \u201cThis is a public place.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood that the Taoist master had the majesty of a Taoist master, so it was not good to be intimate with her in public places.\nAfter waiting for a few minutes, Xie Jingyuan took three packaged milk teas, and Su Miaomiao took her strawberry fresh milk and started to drink directly.\nThe bicycle rode unhurriedly back to the girls\u2019 dormitory.\nXie Jingyuan stood on one foot, and when Su Miaomiao jumped down and stood up on the steps, he took down the three servings of milk tea hanging on the handlebars and handed them to her.\nA ray of sunlight penetrated through the dark clouds and shone in front of the dormitory building, illuminating Xie Jingyuan\u2019s fair and handsome face.\nSu Miaomiao looked at such a Taoist master, and suddenly had the feeling he had talked about.\nSo, instead of picking up the milk tea for her roommates, she held her own cup with one hand, held Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder with the other, and kissed him.\nXie Jingyuan received a slightly jerky, strawberry-flavored kiss.\nOnce the astonishment passed, he instinctively wanted to keep her, but Su Miaomiao thought that it was enough. She withdrew before she was grabbed by Xie Jingyuan, then brushed the tip of her tongue over his lips, and stood up straight with a smile.\nBut she saw his Adam\u2019s apple rolling again.\nSu Miaomiao really wanted to bite on it again, but she knew that the Taoist master didn\u2019t like that.\nHumming unhappily, Su Miaomiao took the milk tea for her roommates, turned and entered the dormitory.\nShe walked so gracefully that she didn\u2019t even take a second look at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s face.\nXie Jingyuan, on the other hand, sat there following her back closely with his eyes, until her little white shoes disappeared on the last stairs that could be seen.\nThe clouds blocked the sun again, and the air seemed to be a few degrees colder, but Xie Jingyuan\u2019s chest was still filled with a fire that was stirred up by his girlfriend.\nIn the next second, through a layer of transparent glass windows, his line of sight unexpectedly met the auntie who was sitting in front of the registration desk.\nThe dormitory aunt in her forties looked at him with a smile.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe immediately looked back and rode away.\nWhen turning the corner, Xie Jingyuan raised his head and looked toward the balcony of 403.\nOf course Su Miaomiao was not there.\nBut he seemed to see her in front of the milk tea store. She smiled and raised her head, waiting expectantly for him to kiss her.\nOn Saturday evening, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing went to the supermarket to buy hot pot side dishes, and Xie Jingyuan stood at the gate of the community waiting for Su Miaomiao who had returned from training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Taoist Xie, you\u2019re so kind.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at Su Miaomiao, and explained, \u201cMiaomiao said that you like to eat these.\u201d\nThe roommates were very moved and rushed over to hug Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cDon\u2019t crush my strawberries!\u201d\nSoon the girls were walking in front, and Xie Jingyuan followed silently.\nOn the way, Su Miaomiao also received a video call from her parents. When Su Mingan and his wife saw their daughter getting along so well with her roommates, and they even would have a meal together on weekend, they were so moved that they wanted to cry.\nAt the end of the video, the couple hugged each other and giggled. Finally, they didn\u2019t have to worry about their daughter not being able to make friends.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t see that scene. Xie Jingyuan went to 801 to wash the fruits first, and she took her roommates to 802 to visit her small home.\nWhen Gu Jialing, the cheerful bird, came from the corridor, the four girls followed and went to 801.\n\u201cWow, the house shared by the boys is so clean, I thought it would be messy.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cOf course, we are not the same as those mortals who wash their dirty socks after a week.\u201d\nGu Jialing liked cleanliness very much, Xu Shou and Xie Jingyuan were the same, and in order to entertain Su Miaomiao\u2019s roommates that day, they did clean in a serious manner early in the morning.\nHe wiped the entrance cabinet with his fingers and showed it to the girls.\nZhao Lu: \u201cI admire it! It\u2019s much cleaner than our dormitory!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao continued to visit their rooms with her roommates, only looking in at the door of each room.\nXu Shou\u2019s room was simple, and there was nothing worth discussing. In Gu Jialing\u2019s master bedroom, as soon as they opened the door, they saw the blue feather suit hanging on the wall.\n\u201cThis outfit is definitely eye-catching if worn by someone. Gu Jialing has a good height and appearance, so it looked good on him.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I want to hear him sing later, I don\u2019t know if he wants to.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he will definitely be willing.\u201d\nNo need to ask, Gu Jialing wanted to sing almost all the time.\nIn Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room, the quilt was neatly folded, and the sheets were spread without any creases, as if that bed was not used at all, and it was just a decoration.\nThere was a white hanger in the room, on which hung the big scarf Su Miaomiao made, layered on top of each other. It was quite artistic.\nZhao Lu whispered, \u201cI can completely imagine Taoist Xie\u2019s tenderness when he hung up the scarf.\u201d\nChen Ling: \u201cYeah, if it were me, I would have just thrown it, as long as it didn\u2019t fall off.\u201d\nZhu Xingzhu: \u201cTo be honest, if I were a man and received such a long scarf, I would just keep it in the bottom of the suitcase.\u201d\nThe scarf was obviously pretty, and the Taoist master also liked it very much. He wore it every day, and he knew some small spells, which could always keep the scarf as white as snow.\n\u201cHey, Miaomiao, can you show us the two photo frames on Taoist Xie\u2019s desk?\u201d Zhao Lu noticed the bright spot, \u201cTaoist Xie doesn\u2019t seem like a narcissistic person, so the two photos must have lots of stories.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao knew what the photos were, so she showed them openly.\nThose were two photos of Su Miaomiao, Xie Jingyuan and Grandma Tao, one was taken when they were three years old, and the other was taken after they graduated from high school.\n\u201cTaoist Xie was very cute!\u201d\n\u201cThe two of you actually started wearing a couple\u2019s clothes at that time!\u201d\nIn the photo when they were three-year-old, Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan were both wearing ancient costumes.\nThe girls were chattering, and in the kitchen, Gu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan sourly, \u201cThe Taoist master is biased, why didn\u2019t he arrange for me and Xu Shou to be reincarnated next door to his house?\u201d\nHe also wanted to grow up with the Taoist master, and he also wanted to cultivate a brotherhood with him, so that he would take care of him as his own brother and pamper him like he pampered Su Miaomiao.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI didn\u2019t arrange it.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cThen how could you two be together?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t explain.\nXu Shou guessed, \u201cMaybe at that time, Su Miaomiao was the closest to the Taoist master.\u201d\nMentioning the vicious fight with the demons in\u00a0 Qingxu Temple in the previous life, Gu Jialing\u2019s heart trembled, and his face showed fear.\nXie Jingyuan cleaned the fruits silently, a trace of confusion appeared in his eyes.\nThe sword light from his best cultivation would only attack the evil demons on the opposite side, and would never hurt Su Miaomiao who was hiding behind him.\nAt that time, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing had already been seriously injured, so why would Su Miaomiao\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The last thing she saw before reincarnation was a golden light from him.\nAfter the side dishes were prepared, the seven college students sat around the dining table and ate, three of which were brought from 802.\nSu Miaomiao still looked like she was enjoying it. Whatever she liked to eat, Xie Jingyuan, would cook it for her and put it on her plate.\nZhao Lu: \u201cThis is too great. If my future boyfriend is willing to treat me like this, then it won\u2019t matter if he is ugly.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cNo, your partner must be good-looking, otherwise you won\u2019t even be able to eat.\u201d\nBack then, if a beautiful female bird wanted to forcefully cover him, Gu Jialing might be able to bear it. He would rather die than obey the black crow!\nZhao Lu made fun of him, \u201cI think you look pretty, how about we try it?\u201d\nGu Jialing glanced at her black hair, then said, \u201cI can cook your meat for you, it\u2019s fine if we fall in love.\u201d\nZhao Lu was already overjoyed, \u201cOkay, then let me enjoy the wonderful Queen Mother treatment!\u201d\nGu Jialing really helped her cook the meat.\nChen Ling and Zhu Xingzhu cast their eyes on Xu Shou\u2019s face together, but his aura was colder than Xie Jingyuan\u2019s, so they didn\u2019t dare to speak.\nXu Shou took the initiative to help the two girls a few times, with a typical cold face and warm heart.\nEveryone had a great time eating hot pot, and there were fruits and meat after eating.\nThe roommates found that the fruits sold in the fruit store outside the lakeside community seemed to be very sweet, as if they were picked after the fruits naturally ripened.\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ve lived for eighteen years, but I\u2019ve never eaten such a sweet durian!\u201d\n\u201cMiaomiao, thanks to you, I had such a great time tonight!\u201d\nThe roommates surrounded Su Miaomiao, the happy smiles on their faces never stopped.\nThey stayed until after eight o\u2019clock in the evening before they had to go back to university.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cIt\u2019s dark outside, we\u2019ll drop you all back.\u201d\nZhao Lu: \u201cNo, no, no, we are not children anymore.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan insisted on sending them off because they were all Su Miaomiao\u2019s roommates, so of course Su Miaomiao would accompany them. As for Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, they had to stay in 801 to clean up the mess.\nGu Jialing gritted his teeth at a table of bowls and chopsticks, \u201cThe Taoist master must have done it on purpose!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cStop talking nonsense, the Taoist master just did his due courtesy.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cWhat kind of etiquette? They\u2019re Su Miaomiao\u2019s roommates. Can\u2019t it be enough for her to drop them off by herself?\u201d\nXu Shou explained to him, \u201cThe Taoist master is now Su Miaomiao\u2019s nominal boyfriend. If he asks Su Miaomiao to drop them off by herself, it would be dereliction of duty. Zhao Lu and the others would blame and dislike him.\u201d\nA competent boyfriend would worry about accidents when his girlfriend\u2019s roommates walked back home at night, and he must personally accompany his girlfriend.\nIn short, Xu Shou understood the Taoist master\u2019s approach very well.\nXie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao sent the roommates to the gate of the university. When they arrived, the roommates didn\u2019t need them to drop them all the way to the dormitory, so they entered the campus intimately arm in arm alone.\n\u201cDo you want to go shopping?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao had been training for a day, and since she was full, she just wanted to sleep.\n\u201cYou carry me back.\u201d\nShe walked around behind Xie Jingyuan, and her hands were already on his shoulders.\nXie Jingyuan had no choice but to lower his body and let her.\nThe two walked back, on the left was the bustling road with cars coming and going, and on the right was the outer wall of Beijing University.\nBecause they had only eaten hot pot, even if there was a wind blowing, they would not feel cold.\nSu Miaomiao dozed off comfortably. For a moment, she sniffed and smelled the fresh mint scent.\nShe opened her eyes, looked ahead, stared at Xie Jingyuan for a while, and found that he was chewing mint.\n\u201cDo you want it?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked, \u201cIt is strawberry flavored.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao immediately said, \u201cYes.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan took one out of his pocket, tore off the package, and handed it to her.\nSu Miaomiao bit it over, took it in her mouth, continued to tilt her head and lay on his shoulder, chewing with relish.\nBack in the community, he dropped her at the gate of 802. Only after seeing Su Miaomiao go in did he go back to 801.\nGu Jialing came out of the kitchen, saw him, and started to get angry, \u201cIt\u2019s really good that you took such a long time, we just finished cleaning the dishes.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cThen I will move Su Miaomiao\u2019s chairs back.\u201d\nThree chairs with backrests were not convenient for one person to carry.\nXu Shou wanted to help, but Xie Jingyuan asked him to study. He carried two in one hand and one in the other, and went out the door.\nXu Shou glared at Gu Jialing, making him feel guilty.\nHe knew that the Taoist master was not that kind of person, so he was just joking.\nXu Shou didn\u2019t read a book either, and took out the mop to mop the floor.\nXie Jingyuan put the three dining chairs back to their original places, and heard the sound of water splashing from the bathroom; Su Miaomiao was taking a bath.\nHe wanted to leave, but he also wanted to stay.\nHe still clearly remembered that Su Miaomiao took the initiative to kiss him in front of the dormitory at noon.\nHe was standing in the living room. The sound of water in the bathroom was so loud, but he could still hear the \u201cda da\u201d sound of the second hand of the wall clock moving.\nMaybe, she would need his help to dry her hair.\nThree minutes later, the sound of the water stopped, and Xie Jingyuan walked toward the entrance in case she thought there was no one there and would come out without her pajamas.\nHe just stood still, and after a brief silence, the sound of the hair dryer came from the bathroom again.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe held the doorknob and opened it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She finished drying her hair, and when she came to the living room to pick up her phone, she noticed the change at the dining table.\nImmediately afterward, Xie Jingyuan sent a message saying that he had put back the dining chair.\nSu Miaomiao: I see.\nXie Jingyuan: Are you going to sleep?\nSu Miaomiao: Yes, I\u2019ll sleep after hanging the clothes.\nXie Jingyuan: Do you want my help?\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while and replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\nShe still remembered that time when the Taoist master lost his temper with her because of those trivial housework, he was so fierce.\nTherefore, she didn\u2019t want to bother the Taoist master for trivial things like hanging clothes.\nAfter breakfast on the weekend, Su Miaomiao was picked up by Sister Fang to the tennis center.\nGu Jialing was still sleeping, and Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou went to their classes respectively.\nAfter the eighth class, Xie Jingyuan sent a message to Xu Shou, telling him to go to the cafeteria first, and he went to wait for Su Miaomiao.\nXie Jingyuan: No, you can eat first, she might be late.\nHalf an hour later, Xie Jingyuan picked up Su Miaomiao at the gate of the community.\nSu Miaomiao was disappointed, \u201cWon\u2019t you come with me today?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cThe professor left a lot of homework, and I have to go to the library later.\u201d\nIt may take some time for Xie Jingyuan to find the books, so he took Su Miaomiao to an empty seat and asked her to sit for a while.\nBeijing University had a strong learning atmosphere. The library on each floor was almost full of college students, and the other five seats next to their table were also occupied.\nXie Jingyuan led her to look for books.\nAfter passing through rows of bookshelves, they finally arrived at the destination.\nXie Jingyuan concentrated on looking for the books. Because some information books were frequently borrowed by students, and the administrators did not organize them in a timely manner, they may not be in the correct position prompted by the retrieval machine.\nSu Miaomiao was not interested in his professional books and had nothing to do, so she just stared at Xie Jingyuan.\nThe lights in the library were very bright, but\u00a0 \u00a0 Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t need that kind of lighting, but under it, his face had a jade-like luster.\nSu Miaomiao liked dazzling diamonds, and also liked gentle and restrained jade.\nXie Jingyuan was scanning the spines of several rows of books above when Su Miaomiao threw his hand away suddenly. He lowered his head, and saw Su Miaomiao squeezed between him and the bookshelf, hugged his waist with both hands and leaned up to him with a smile.\nLooking at each other, she looked at his lips again, the hint was very obvious.\nThe never-extinguished flame in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s chest jumped up suddenly.\nWhy did she always choose such public places?\nHer brain was spoiled by the couple who kissed in public.\nXie Jingyuan was still hesitating when a boy suddenly turned to his side.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe patted Su Miaomiao\u2019s head, and said via voice transmission, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk when we go back.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted.\nIt just so happened that the boy skipped the row and went elsewhere because he saw the intimate posture of the two, either out of embarrassment or out of consideration.\nXie Jingyuan took out a book and placed it on both sides of Su Miaomiao\u2019s head, bowed his head and kissed her.\nIt was a very short kiss, so shallow that when Su Miaomiao opened her lips to wait for him to come in, Xie Jingyuan had already stood up straight again.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThat was not what the Taoist master taught her that night.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t look at her accusing eyes again, and put the book back as usual.\nSu Miaomiao snorted, and continued to follow him.\nAfter more than ten minutes, Xie Jingyuan finally found two heavy books that might be five centimeters thick.\nAfter borrowing books and leaving that quiet area, Su Miaomiao asked curiously, \u201cIt\u2019s so thick, how long will you have to read it?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cReading both books intensively, it may take two nights.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026Can you remember the content?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cAlmost.\u201d\nIn fact, Su Miaomiao knew that Xie Jingyuan liked to read since he was a child, and the bookshelves in his study were filled with all kinds of complicated and profound books, yet she always thought that Xie Jingyuan only had a wide range of interests, but she never thought that he could remember all of them.\n\u201cThe Taoist master is really powerful, no wonder there are so many old Taoist masters in Qingxu Temple, but you became the master of the temple at a young age.\u201d\nYoung?\nXie Jingyuan clarified, \u201cI was twenty-six years old when you met me. A secular man may have been a father for many years at that age, so I should not be considered young.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s point was not that, \u201cAnyway, you\u2019re very powerful.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan met her stubborn eyes and stopped refuting.\nIn terms of talent, he may indeed be better than ordinary people.\nPutting away his bag, he waited for Su Miaomiao to jump on the seat, and rode toward the gate of Beijing University.\nSu Miaomiao found that the Taoist master was riding a little fast that night, and the speed of the bicycle was so fast that the wind blowing head-on was even stronger.\nShe hugged Xie Jingyuan\u2019s waist tightly, and leaned against him with her neck shrunk.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Taoist master wear a scarf?\u201d She muttered.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to come outside at night.\u201d\nThe scarf was too big, it was inconvenient to put it in the bag, and she was not at university during the day. Xie Jingyuan himself didn\u2019t mind the wind blowing.\nSu Miaomiao remembered Gu Jialing\u2019s provocation, \u201cWill you use Gu Jiangling\u2019s scarf when he finishes weaving it?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cNo, if he doesn\u2019t wear it himself, he can give it to Xu Shou.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYou\u2019re so partial, why don\u2019t you give it to me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou want it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She bought the most comfortable wool and knitted sweaters for him and Su Miaomiao that were even more beautiful than those sold in the mall.\nOf course, that was all when they were children. Later, when Grandma Tao got older, Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to bother her anymore, so she just bought finished products.\nHowever, Xie Jingyuan had also learned how to weave from Grandma Tao after so many years, and even secretly helped her when she was sleeping.\nIt took Su Miaomiao a week to weave it. Three hours should be enough for him to weave a normal length scarf.\nAfter sending Su Miaomiao back to 802, Xie Jingyuan went back downstairs, walked around the Beijing University, and found the gift shop that Su Miaomiao had mentioned.\nHe bought three balls of white yarn, three balls of black yarn, paused before walking away, and took three balls of blue yarn.\nBack in the community, Xu Shou hadn\u2019t come back yet, and Gu Jialing was playing games. The weather was cold, and he didn\u2019t even want to participate in the activities of the opera club recently.\nBefore seven o\u2019clock, Xie Jingyuan locked the door, opened the book, and knitted a scarf while reading.\nFor those who were skilled in weaving, weaving scarves was a mechanical handwork that did not require brains.\nWhen needing to flip the book, Xie Jingyuan only needed to use a little spiritual power, just like he used spiritual power to press the switch in Su Miaomiao\u2019s room.\nThe speed was faster than he expected. At 8:40, Xie Jingyuan finished Xu Shou\u2019s piece.\nAfter meditating for twenty minutes, Xie Jingyuan continued to read and weave Su Miaomiao\u2019s piece.\nBy eleven o\u2019clock, the white scarf was finished too.\nXie Jingyuan put the key of 802 into his pocket, and went out with two scarves.\nGu Jialing was still playing games frantically in the room. The sound of clicking the keyboard was clearly audible, mixed with one or two curses.\nHe was a good person when he sang, and he didn\u2019t use dirty words when he scolded people.\nXie Jingyuan went to knock on Xu Shou\u2019s door.\nXu Shou had just washed up and was about to go to bed, when he heard the Taoist master knock on the door, so he came to open it immediately.\nXie Jingyuan handed him the black scarf, and said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s cold, I knitted a scarf, this one\u2019s for you, I\u2019ll give the other to Su Miaomiao.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe was taller and stronger than Xie Jingyuan, but at that moment, his eyes were uncontrollably moist.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at Gu Jialing\u2019s door.\nXu Shou understood, and quickly swallowed the words from the bottom of his heart.\nXie Jingyuan then pointed to the living room and the hallway.\nXu Shou nodded, and watched the Taoist master go out, before returning to the room with the scarf that was warm to the touch.\nThe moment the door was closed, he heard Gu Jialing scolding the players who were playing games together again.\nXu Shou thought that the Taoist master was the most impartial and selfless. Gu Jialing was weaving a scarf for himself, but he still gave him the gift.\nSpeaking of which, he would also like to thank Su Miaomiao. If she hadn\u2019t given the Taoist master a scarf first, the Taoist master might not have thought of returning the gift, and then specially knitted one for him.\nXie Jingyuan walked out of 801, stood in the corridor and called Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao would not mute her phone unless she wanted to sleep. When the phone rang for the second time, she got out of bed irritably, and when she saw the screen displayed \u201cTaoist Master\u201d, she restrained her anger, but she was not very happy, \u201cTaoist Master, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan could hear her sleepiness and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat time did you sleep?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cEight o\u2019clock.\u201d\nShe finished her homework on Friday, and after she separated from Xie Jingyuan, she had a video chat with her parents, Grandma Tao, and chatted with relatives and friends in the chat group. When she started to feel sleepy, she got under the covers.\nThe colder it was, the sooner she fell asleep.\nXie Jingyuan knew that going there at that time would disturb her sleep, but he would use his spiritual power to make up for it, ensuring that her sleep quality that night would be higher than usual.\n\u201cI knitted a scarf for you, do you want to see it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s heart skipped a beat, \u201cDid you weave it?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYes, it only took me two hours. If you want to see it, open the door and let me come in.\u201d\nOf course Su Miaomiao wanted to see it.\nXie Jingyuan hung up the phone, took out the key, and opened the door.\nThe living room was pitch black. Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t turn on the light, and after his eyes got used to the darkness, he went straight to the master bedroom.\nWhen a knock fell on the door, Su Miaomiao, lying comfortably under the quilt, said, \u201cCome in.\u201d\nWhen he pushed open the door,\u00a0 she covered her head with a quilt in advance and asked him to turn on the light.\nXie Jingyuan turned on the light, looked up, and saw a snow-white quilt spread on the big bed, completely covering her.\nAfter her eyes got used to the light, Su Miaomiao poked her head out and saw the white scarf in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s hand clearly. She sat up with a smile and reached out to him.\nShe was wearing a white long-sleeved pullover pajamas. Although her long hair was messed up in sleep, against her rosy sleeping face, it only made her a little more lazy and charming than in the daytime.\nXie Jingyuan walked to the head of the bed and handed over the scarf.\nSu Miaomiao looked at it, touched it, and said pleasantly, \u201cIt looks like grandma\u2019s weaving.\u201d\nWhen she was young, Grandma Tao liked to knit sweaters for them, and asked her what patterns she liked. Su Miaomiao liked cats. There was a kitten on the clothes, scarves or gloves that Grandma Tao knitted for her, although the cat didn\u2019t look like her.\nSeeing her rummaging through, Xie Jingyuan explained, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to weave patterns.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "178": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-178/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was a more advanced technique, which he hadn\u2019t learned.\nSu Miaomiao was not disappointed. She tried wearing the scarf, which was comfortable and warm, and smelled like the Taoist master.\nXie Jingyuan sat down by the bed and watched her admiring the scarf without distraction.\nWhat he thought of was the downstairs of the dormitory, and the library.\nThe hint was useless, so Xie Jingyuan turned off the light with spiritual power again. He felt her unexpectedly raise her head, so he asked, \u201cDo you still want to kiss?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao also thought of that shallow kiss in the library.\nShe took off the scarf, lifted the quilt, wrapped her arms around his neck, and sat in his arms.\nXie Jingyuan avoided the lips she offered, and first reminded her in her ear, \u201cIt might be uncomfortable.\u201d\nWhat he wanted, and what she imagined in her heart, was by no means a kiss.\nSu Miaomiao pouted and asked, \u201cWill that be long?\u201d\nIf it was just for a while, she could bear it.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI will try my best.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nBut Xie Jingyuan carried her down, told her to cover the quilt and sit at the head of the bed.\nSu Miaomiao protested, \u201cI like to sit with you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan explained patiently, \u201cThat would be inconvenient for me.\u201d\nOf course Su Miaomiao believed him.\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Su Miaomiao was about to ask why he didn\u2019t start yet, when Xie Jingyuan pressed her shoulder with one hand, held her face with the other, and kissed her.\nIn the darkness, only the chaotic breathing of the two remained.\nSu Miaomiao started to get scared again, afraid that the Taoist master would eat her.\nShe couldn\u2019t push the Taoist master away, so she touched his head to make sure he didn\u2019t grow fairy ears, and also wanted to check if he had a long tail.\nShe was once chased by a wolf demon, when she met a kind-hearted female tiger demon who rescued her.\nSu Miaomiao felt that the current Taoist master was like that wolf.\nBut as soon as her hand touched the Taoist master\u2019s clothes, he clasped her tightly, making her unable to move.\n\u201cDon\u2019t move around.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u201d\nUnknowingly, Su Miaomiao slipped softly from the cushion at the head of the bed, and Xie Jingyuan also chased her and pressed down.\nAt that time, Su Miaomiao was sure that the Taoist master was still the Taoist master, not some vicious jackal or beast.\nBecause if he was really a wolf, the Taoist master would have eaten her long ago.\nFeeling less afraid, Su Miaomiao remembered the scenes she had seen in the brothel.\nWrapping her hands around the Taoist master\u2019s neck, Su Miaomiao stopped dodging. The Taoist master kissed her ears, and she also kissed his ears.\nXie Jingyuan froze, and grabbed her hand again.\nIt was a pity that in the dark room, she couldn\u2019t see the Taoist master\u2019s face clearly, but she could only hear his beast-like breathing.\nHowever, Xie Jingyuan felt that every word of hers was full of seductive charms, destroying his little reason left.\nBut he also knew that Su Miaomiao in human life could not display any charm skills, it was because of his lack of concentration and self-disruption in his cultivation.\nWhile talking, Xie Jingyuan let go of her hand and prepared to stand up.\nSu Miaomiao hugged him at that moment, \u201cYou sleep with me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan held her shoulders, not allowing her to stick too tightly, \u201cWe can only sleep together when we get married, and now if I accompany you, Uncle will be angry if he finds out.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said smartly, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to tell dad, just like before when you gave me jewelry, mom and dad didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan paused, and brought out someone who could shock her, \u201cThe Patriarch will know.\u201d\nShe was so easy to deceive and believed in him so much. Xie Jingyuan\u2019s chest suddenly calmed down, he patted her head, and helped cover her with the quilt, \u201cSleep, I will leave when you fall asleep.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was wrapped in a quilt and arched toward him, her forehead was next to him.\nXie Jingyuan pressed his fingertips against her eyebrows, and slowly injected all his spiritual energy.\nSu Miaomiao was easy to fall asleep, but under that kind of spring-like spiritual energy, her breathing quickly became shallow and regular, and she didn\u2019t even know when Xie Jingyuan left.\nOutside the gate of 802, Xie Jingyuan took out his phone, and the screen showed that it was 11:45.\nDid he stay there that long?\nHe thought it was only a few minutes.\nXie Jingyuan opened the door of 801 with complicated emotions.\nThe living room was pitch black, Xu Shou\u2019s room was quiet, and Gu Jialing was still playing games.\nBut Xie Jingyuan knew that Xu Shou must not have fallen asleep.\nIn his previous life, he was watching Qingxu, and every time he went out, no matter how far or near, Xu Shou would definitely wait for him to come back.\nAfter closing the door, Xie Jingyuan turned on the light and saw three balls of blue wool on the desk.\nHe sent a message to Xu Shou: I just went to the gift shop and bought three balls of wool, and also knitted one scarf for Gu Jialing.\nXu Shou was indeed still awake, and when he saw the message from the Taoist master, he understood him.\nThe Taoist master must have been afraid that Gu Jialing would be angry if he knew that Su Miaomiao and him had scarves the next morning, so he made an extra trip in the cold night.\nHe replied: Next time, if something like this happens again, you should tell me.\nXie Jingyuan: Go to sleep.\nPutting down his phone, Xie Jingyuan went to the bathroom to take a shower, and when he came out, he saw Gu Jialing poking his head out from the master bedroom furtively.\nLooking at him, Gu Jialing was stunned.\nXie Jingyuan frowned and asked, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you slept yet?\u201d\nBefore Gu Jialing could speak, his stomach started to growl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

How could he not be hungry?\nGu Jialing clutched his stomach and looked at Xie Jingyuan pitifully.\nHe could make noodles by himself, but the Taoist master was awake, so he just wanted to eat the noodles from his hands.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cSleep right after eating.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll turn off the phone now!\u201d\nIn the next room, Xu Shou, who was silently lying on the bed, pursed his lips.\nThe Taoist master had worked so hard, the cat and the bird were both troublesome.\nEarly the next morning, Xie Jingyuan also gave Gu Jialing a blue scarf.\nGu Jialing was happy but a little confused, \u201cIs it a holiday today? Why are you giving us gifts all of a sudden?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s expression was flat, \u201cIt\u2019s cold, you three have one for each of you.\u201d\nGu Jialing understood, \u201cThis is the winter welfare for our Qingxu Temple!\u201d\nXu Shou glared at him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you want to weave a scarf for the Taoist master? Have you bought wool yet?\u201d\nGu Jialing touched the back of his head guiltily.\nKnitting scarves was too boring, he preferred playing games.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cForget it, I already have one, so you don\u2019t need to make one for me.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cBut the one Su Miaomiao wove\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good, as long as I can wear it.\u201d\nThe topic of the scarf stopped there, and the three of them went outside to wait for Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao slept so comfortably that she was woken up by the alarm clock.\nWhen she opened the door, Gu Jialing first saw the white scarf around her neck, which was almost identical to his except for the color.\nSu Miaomiao also saw the scarves around his and Xu Shou\u2019s necks.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s expression changed slightly, worried that she would mind.\nWhat Su Miaomiao thought was that the Taoist master could knit two scarves in two hours, which was actually great.\nAs expected of a Taoist master, he was so powerful in everything he did.\nThat Thursday Lidong, the custom in Anshi was to eat dumplings in Lidong (winter start).\nThe time was too tight in the morning, so the group of four decided to have a dumpling supper at night.\nSince Xu Shou and Xie Jingyuan both had evening classes, and Su Miaomiao had to accompany Xie Jingyuan again, the glorious task of grocery shopping fell to Gu Jialing.\nWhen the three returned, Gu Jialing had already prepared all the flour and side dishes ingredients, and only waited for chef Xie Jingyuan to make it.\nXie Jingyuan cut vegetables and meat, and instructed Xu Shou to knead the dough.\nSu Miaomiao and Gu Jialing were sitting in the living room watching TV. Gu Jialing kept pressing the remote control, and finally stopped on a channel, which was playing a martial arts drama.\nIn the scene, a Taoist master from Wudang Mountain was entangled with a demon girl.\nGu Jialing asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cHave you seen this?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at the Taoist master and nodded, \u201cI think I have seen it. Didn\u2019t they both die in the end?\u201d\nGrandma Tao had watched a lot of TV series, including modern and ancient martial arts and immortals. Su Miaomiao would always be by Grandma Tao\u2019s side, sometimes watching along, sometimes falling asleep watching, so she remembered everything in fragments, not the full story.\nGu Jialing chatted with her while eating melon seeds, \u201cSpeaking of which, people from Wudang Mountain could be regarded as Taoist masters. You can see that Zhang Cuishan could marry a wife and have children. It can be seen that our patriarchs who were not strict in Taoism were reasonable. What are the benefits of getting married especially for beautiful women, none of their words can be trusted. Hey, the Taoist master will find a woman to marry in the future, so we have to help him keep an eye on her, lest the Taoist master also end up like Zhang Cuishan in the end.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stared at the actress on the screen, and then touched her face.\nShe was also a beautiful woman, right?\nBut she had never lied to the Taoist master, so he would marry her, and it would end well.\nAt that time, Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou brought the dough and stuffing to the dining table, and sat there to make dumplings.\nSu Miaomiao immediately lost interest in TV dramas, and sat next to Xie Jingyuan, watching him make seafood-filled dumplings for her.\nGu Jialing turned off the TV, sat down and asked Xie Jingyuan seriously, \u201cMaster, have you watched \u2018Heavenly Sword and Dragon Slaying Sabre\u2019?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d\nWhen the TV series was on the air, the primary school students in the class would discuss it, and together with some scenes he glimpsed in the living room at home, probably all the plots could be connected.\nGu Jialing: \u201cIf you were Zhang Wuji, which woman would you choose?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cOkay, you\u2019re not, but from those women over there, who do you like?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in any of them.\u201d\nXu Shou glared at Gu Jialing, \u201cWatch TV. If you don\u2019t want to help, at least don\u2019t make trouble.\u201d\nGu Jialing was quiet for a while, then suddenly asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cWhich male character do you like in it? It seems that many girls like Yang Xiao. Hey, I suddenly discovered that this kind of drama always pairs a demon and a human together, like Zhang Cuishan and Yin Susu, Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min, and Yang Xiao and Ji Xiaofu\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao just looked at him.\nIn the end, Gu Jialing concluded, \u201cBut most couples of a good human and demon do not end well.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan. He was about to make the dumpling wrapper, when he saw her looking over, he added some fillings to the dumpling with a spoon.\nSu Miaomiao smiled.\nThe dumplings with four kinds of fillings were all wrapped, so Xie Jingyuan went to the kitchen to cook them. Xu Shou wanted to follow, but Su Miaomiao followed him one step ahead.\nThe kitchen was such a closed place, Xu Shou didn\u2019t want Su Miaomiao to complain of the smell on his body, so he just stayed in the living room and watched TV with Gu Jialing.\nThe scene at that time happened to be when Zhang Cuishan and Yin Susu consummated in the cave.\nGu Jialing watched with relish, when suddenly Xu Shou changed the channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Besides, their concept of Qingxu temple no longer existed, and he couldn\u2019t deduce what would happen next.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t know what he was thinking. When he nodded, she was very happy.\nIt turned out that even if she was a cat, the Taoist master would still like her.\nFeeling at will, Su Miaomiao stood on tiptoe and kissed his lips.\nXie Jingyuan still had the sense of where he was, so he wanted to avoid it. But he saw Su Miaomiao\u2019s face clearly. Although her eyes were closed, the corners of her mouth were curled up.\nXie Jingyuan froze.\nIt was just like the time he was distracted during their first kiss but he nervously paid attention to the movement in the living room.\nWhen Xu Shou was tired of Gu Jialing nagging, he left the sofa and walked toward the side. Xie Jingyuan pressed Su Miaomiao\u2019s shoulder, gave her a final kiss, and left in time.\nWhen Xu Shou looked over, he saw the Taoist master standing upright, and Su Miaomiao leaning against the Taoist master\u2019s back as if she had no bones.\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt was not just dumplings stuffed with seafood, but Su Miaomiao was so greedy that she insisted on staring at the pot.\nAfter Su Miaomiao ate up her bowl full of dumplings filled with seafood, and drank a bowl of dumpling soup, her whole body warmed up.\nAfter leaving the bowl and chopsticks to Xie Jingyuan to wash, she returned to 802 contentedly.\nMaybe 801 was too lively. When Su Miaomiao opened the door of her house, she felt that her place was deserted.\nThe temperature outside was almost zero, and the room was not very warm. It seemed that the heating would not be turned on until the middle of the month.\nSu Miaomiao liked the air conditioner in summer, but it would be too dry in winter, and she had never been used to it.\nAfter brushing her teeth, Su Miaomiao walked into the bedroom and put her hands under the blanket, feeling cold.\nShe also didn\u2019t like to use electric blankets. After lying down those nights, she had to roll around first to warm the quilt before she could fall asleep.\nSitting by the bed, Su Miaomiao picked up her phone and sent a message to Xie Jingyuan: Taoist Master, come and help me warm the bed.\nIn 801, Xie Jingyuan washed his and Su Miaomiao\u2019s bowls and chopsticks, and only saw her message when he returned to the room. At that time, two minutes had passed.\nXie Jingyuan said to the two, \u201cThe sewer of 802 is blocked, I\u2019ll go and have a look.\u201d\nGu Jialing enthusiastically said, \u201cI can pass through the sewer, I will go with you!\u201d\nHowever, before he could turn around, Xu Shou held him down. Gu Jialing was lying, just looking for an excuse to avoid the work of cleaning up the pot there.\nSeeing that Xu Shou had subdued Gu Jialing, Xie Jingyuan left straight away.\nThe living room of 802 was still dark, only the bedroom was lit.\nSu Miaomiao was dressed warmly and was leaning on the bedside to cut fruit. When she saw Xie Jingyuan, she patted the bed next to her, \u201cTaoist Master, lie down first.\u201d\nTherefore, he was a warm quilt in the literal sense.\nHe went around to the other side of the big bed, and when he lifted the quilt to go in, Su Miaomiao looked over, frowned and said, \u201cYou take off your coat.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was a hygienic cat.\nXie Jingyuan paused, and then asked her to turn off the light.\nAfter Su Miaomiao turned off the light and turned around, she caught a glimpse of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s tall and straight figure, with his back to her, and the coat on top had already been taken off, as if he was unbuttoning his belt.\nWhen Su Miaomiao sat back on the bed, Xie Jingyuan was already lying on her pillow.\nShe estimated that it would take a few minutes for the quilt to completely warm up. She continued to play fruit ninja, her eyes fixed on the screen, and her fingers moved quickly.\nThe sound of fruit being cut was continuous, covering Xie Jingyuan\u2019s breathing.\nXie Jingyuan lay silently for five minutes, then left the bed from the other side, and said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s fine now.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao immediately put down her phone, quickly took off her thick coat, got into bed, and lay down where he had just been.\nThe sheets were warm and the quilt was also warm.\nSu Miaomiao let out a breath of joy.\n\u201cIs it warm enough?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked when he put on his pants and buckled his belt.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI\u2019m still a little cold.\u201d\nEspecially the hands, which were always exposed when playing games.\nXie Jingyuan sat down again, first covered her with the quilt, and then leaned over to kiss her.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s arm was wrapped in the quilt by him, unable to move. She could only forcefully speak out when Xie Jingyuan let go of her a few times, \u201cHand\u2026\u201d\nBut before her words fell, Xie Jingyuan kissed her again.\nHalf an hour later, when Su Miaomiao was so hot that she was about to sweat, Xie Jingyuan finally sat up.\nShe pulled half of the quilt off her body suddenly, panting heavily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to catch a cold,\u201d Xie Jingyuan quickly covered her with the quilt.\nSu Miaomiao gradually calmed down, turned sideways, and pouted, \u201cYou\u2019re so stupid.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan asked hoarsely, \u201cWhy am I stupid?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "181": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-181/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cI asked you to improve your kissing skills. You haven\u2019t improved at all. It\u2019s almost the same as the first time. You seem to be eating me. Fortunately, I am brave, otherwise I would be scared to death by you and think you transformed into a wolf demon.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe stroked her hair, \u201cHave you ever met a wolf demon?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThat\u2019s right, that time when I turned into a human and sat by the river to practice braiding a new bun, a male wolf demon suddenly appeared, ugly and fierce, even scarier than Xu Shou\u2019s original form. He had green eyes. He said he wanted to do the double cultivation with me. I didn\u2019t like him, so I returned to my original form and ran away, but he kept chasing me. Fortunately, I met a kind tiger demon sister who helped me beat the wolf demon away.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s breath became heavier and lighter as she narrated.\nThinking about her being a lonely little cat demon, she must have suffered a lot before meeting him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not any monster,\u201d Xie Jingyuan comforted her in a low voice.\nSu Miaomiao rubbed his palm and fell asleep while Xie Jingyuan continued to look at her for a while before quietly leaving.\nAfter passing the bathroom, Xie Jingyuan walked in, wet his cuffs with water on purpose, and also splashed some water droplets on his pants.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing didn\u2019t suspect him when he returned to 801 that way.\nIn fact, Xu Shou could smell Su Miaomiao\u2019s strong smell on the Taoist master, but she often rubbed on him. He was used to it, furthermore it was abnormal that the Taoist master didn\u2019t smell like the cat one day.\nXie Jingyuan returned to the room and looked at the calendar on the phone.\nTwenty days had passed since he announced the restoration of the patriarch\u2019s concept of Qingxu.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want Xu Shou and Gu Jialing to misunderstand that Su Miaomiao had seduced him.\nHe wanted them to understand that it was he who liked her first.\nHe also had to make sure that in the hearts of the two of them, the time of \u201clike\u201d should not be too early, preferably after the college entrance examination. After all, Su Miaomiao was only eighteen years old that year.\nThe plan was good, but the execution was difficult.\nBecause after getting along with Su Miaomiao in the past three years, no matter how good he was to her, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing would not think about other aspects.\u00a0\nKissing directly in front of them was indecent, and it would be more like Su Miaomiao seducing him, while he was just indulging in the physical desire of ordinary men.\nAt noon, the group of four ate in the cafeteria.\nXu Shou ate very attentively, until he found that the Taoist master opposite him seemed to have not moved his chopsticks for a long time.\nXu Shou looked up and found that the Taoist master was looking at Su Miaomiao.\nHe looked at Su Miaomiao again, who was eating fish, skillfully removing fishbone, her expression and behavior were normal.\nGu Jialing suddenly came over and asked him, \u201cDoes the Taoist master want to eat fish?\u201d As he spoke, he swallowed his saliva.\nHe didn\u2019t know why, but every time he saw Su Miaomiao eating fish, he also became very greedy. Obviously he didn\u2019t even think about eating fish when he was ordering vegetables.\nXu Shou glared at him. The Taoist master would not be easily swayed by his appetite.\nAt that time, Xie Jingyuan spoke up and asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cThere is a movie tonight, do you want to watch it? I bought tickets to watch it at ten o\u2019clock.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWhat movie?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u201dThor, part two.\u201d\nGu Jialing asked curiously, \u201cSince when did the Taoist master become interested in the superhero series?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan ignored him and just waited for Su Miaomiao to answer.\nSu Miaomiao hesitated, as it was too cold at night, she preferred to sleep.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou can eat ice cream.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao reluctantly agreed, \u201cLet\u2019s go and see it.\u201d\nGu Jialing was also very happy, and asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cOf which movie theater did you buy the tickets?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan reported the name of the cinema, and then poured cold water on Gu Jialing, \u201cWhen I bought the tickets, there were only two seats left in the best viewing area, so I only bought two tickets.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou knew that the ticket price for that kind of movie that had just been released was expensive, so he immediately said, \u201cYou go with her, we won\u2019t go.\u201d\nGu Jialing was not happy, \u201cEven if there are only two tickets, why did you only invite Su Miaomiao? She obviously doesn\u2019t want to go, why didn\u2019t you invite me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan and him looked at each other for a moment. He then clicked on the ticket sales interface helplessly, bought two tickets at the only corner left, and then said to Xu Shou, \u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201d\nXu Shou glared at Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing kicked him under the table.\nComing out of the cafeteria, Xie Jingyuan sent Su Miaomiao to the university building, while Gu Jialing and Xu Shou rode bicycles side by side.\nXu Shou taught Gu Jialing a lesson, \u201cIf you want to watch a movie, you can watch it by yourself. You can choose the best viewing area, and it\u2019s only a few dozen yuan. Why do you have to bother the Taoist master?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cIs this a matter of money? The three of us are all demons of Qingxu. Why does the Taoist master only favor Su Miaomiao? You are too stupid, let me tell you, there is a saying in human beings, children who cry get milk, the more sensible and honest you are, the easier it will be for him to ignore you.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cI\u2019m not a child. I don\u2019t need the Taoist master to take care of me like a child. I want to help him do things.\u201d\nGu Jialing shook her head in anticipation, \u201cYou are stupid.\u201d\nXu Shou rode his bicycle silently.\nGu Jialing was quiet for a while, then suddenly said, \u201cHowever, the Taoist master never liked watching movies. Don\u2019t you find it strange that he suddenly wants to watch a movie today?\u201d\nXu Shou wanted to say that Su Miaomiao wanted to watch it, but then he remembered that she didn\u2019t like to watch that kind of movie, but the Taoist master even lured her to go with ice cream.\nIt was indeed a bit strange.\nAfter class in the evening, the four of them went back to the lakeside community to put away their bags, and then took a taxi outside the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That night, he actually touched Su Miaomiao\u2019s head and looked down at her for a long time with gentle eyes.\nOn the other side, while shrinking his neck, Gu Jialing bumped Xu Shou with his shoulder, motioning for him to look.\nXu Shou had seen it a long time ago, and it was nothing unusual for the Taoist master to take care of Su Miaomiao as his younger sister. Especially after she won the championship, the Taoist master\u2019s connivance with Su Miaomiao went even further.\nThe four of them were still in the back seats, and Xu Shou was in front.\nThe air conditioner was turned on in the taxi, so it was stuffy and the smell was not good. Su Miaomiao continued to bury her head in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms.\nWhen the taxi stopped, Su Miaomiao almost fell asleep, and opened her eyes only after being blown by the cold wind.\nThe movie was about to start, Gu Jialing ran to buy milk tea furst, and Xu Shou went to get tickets, while xie Jingyuan continued to be a pillar for Su Miaomiao.\nWhen entering the arena, Xie Jingyuan led Su Miaomiao to sit in the middle seat.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing were four rows away from them, obliquely behind.\nNot long after the movie started, Su Miaomiao fell asleep leaning on Xie Jingyuan.\nSo many heads were vertical, she tilted her head suddenly, which naturally attracted the attention of Xu Shou and Gu Jialing.\nThey saw that Xie Jingyuan took off his down jacket and used it as a quilt for Su Miaomiao.\nThat was not all. The next second, Xie Jingyuan turned his head and kissed Su Miaomiao\u2019s head, although he quickly moved away, as if afraid of being discovered by her.\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing didn\u2019t know what was going on at the end of the movie. When others were watching the movie, they just stared at Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao who were sitting in the middle of the best viewing area.\nAfter finally surviving until the end of the movie, the two stood up in the first wave, not caring at all whether there would be easter eggs later.\nXie Jingyuan still sat steadily, and waited until everyone was gone before waking up Su Miaomiao who had slept for two hours.\nSu Miaomiao was still rubbing her eyes, but Gu Jialing could not wait and came over from behind, \u201cTaoist Master, you just\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s face changed slightly, and he sent a voice transmission to him and Xu Shou who was standing behind him, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it when we go back.\u201d\nGu Jialing wanted to ask again, but Xu Shou looked at the Taoist master and pulled him away.\nAt midnight, it was even colder outside, Su Miaomiao continued to lie in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms, sleepy, and did not notice anything wrong with the three men.\nAfter getting out of the car at the gate of the lakeside community, there was no one around, so Xie Jingyuan directly carried Su Miaomiao.\nGu Jialing\u2019s hands were tightly tucked into the pockets of the down jacket, and his neck seemed to be half-shortened. He was close to Xu Shou, not only to shield him from the wind but also to facilitate talking, \u201cYou always said that the reason the Taoist master is taking care of Su Miaomiao is because of brother-sister relationship. Would a brother hug his sister like that?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t meet many people in his previous life, and he hadn\u2019t come into contact with many brothers and sisters in this life. Gu Jialing really didn\u2019t understand the boundaries between brothers and sisters.\nHe had seen some pictures of brothers carrying their sisters on their backs. The ones hugging them horizontally, including the ones hugging people in jackets, were most seen in TV dramas and novels about petting sisters.\nEven if he hadn\u2019t met one, before that night, no matter how kind the Taoist master was to Su Miaomiao, Xu Shou would only understand it on the basis of brother-sister relationship.\nHowever, seeing the Taoist master kiss Su Miaomiao\u2019s head with his own eyes, it was difficult for Xu Shou to understand.\nXie Jingyuan walked to the elevator, but the two hadn\u2019t followed.\nHe carried Su Miaomiao in first, went up to the eighth floor, and went to 802.\nProbably because she was too sleepy, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t dislike the coldness of the quilt. She was put on the bed by Xie Jingyuan, hugged and warmed by him with the quilt for a while, then he injected spiritual power into her, making her fall asleep comfortably.\nXie Jingyuan left quietly, opened the door of 802, and saw Xu Shou and Gu Jialing standing in the corridor.\nHe took out the key and led the two into 801.\nAlmost as soon as he turned on the light, Gu Jialing couldn\u2019t hold back and asked, \u201cTaoist Master, what\u2019s the matter with you and Su Miaomiao? Why do I feel that something is wrong?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan picked up his cup, took half cold water and half hot water in front of the water dispenser, then walked to the side of the sofa, sat down, and took two sips slowly.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan drank the water, he held the cup and looked at the two of them, \u201cHave you all seen it?\u201d\nGu Jialing yelled, \u201cAre you talking about how you kissed Su Miaomiao? Yes, we saw it! Many people also saw it!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan frowned and said, \u201cSpeak normally, don\u2019t disturb other people.\u201d\nAfter he became quiet, Xie Jingyuan explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t kiss Su Miaomiao, I kissed her secretly.\u201d\nGu Jialing opened his mouth wide, but fortunately he stopped in time, and said in a low voice, \u201cWhy did you secretly kiss her?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Xu Shou, lowered his eyes and said, \u201cBecause I love her. I love her.\u201d\nAlthough Gu Jialing had already guessed it, when he heard Xie Jingyuan say it, he was dumbfounded and froze on the spot.\nXie Jingyuan looked at his watch, and about three minutes later, Xu Shou came back to his senses before Gu Jialing, and asked doubtfully, \u201cWhy do you love her?\u201d\nA smile appeared in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s downcast eyes.\nHe thought they would ask him why his heart set on mundane changed.\nIt could be seen that the foreshadowing of breaking the precepts before had worked, at least they wouldn\u2019t feel that it was abnormal for him.\nXie Jingyuan put the water glass on the coffee table, and Xu Shou and Gu Jialing silently sat on the double sofa diagonally opposite.\nThey sat down, but Xie Jingyuan stood up, and went to get a glass of water for the two of them, which was slightly hot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Now we are all human beings. After making sure that you would not do evil, I have not treated you as demons.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cEven so, you should find a normal human woman like you to fall in love with, right? Su Miaomiao is almost like a cat except that she can\u2019t turn into a cat. She smells like a cat, lazy, greedy and domineering and is not cute!\u201d\nHe looked at Xie Jingyuan as if he was sick in head, as only when he was sick would he like Su Miaomiao.\nXie Jingyuan said lightly, \u201cIf you really think she\u2019s not cute, why do you always let her scratch your hair, and a while ago you picked her up to and from the class on time?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe snorted, \u201cI\u2019m too lazy to care about her. It has nothing to do with her being cute. In this world, only kind birds are cute, and no cat is cute!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t argue with him, but looked at Xu Shou.\nXu Shou also thought about the same reason as Gu Jialing, but obviously, in the eyes of the Taoist master, Su Miaomiao was cute, and he didn\u2019t mind her lazy shortcomings.\nTherefore, Xu Shou pointed out calmly, \u201cThe Taoist master deserves a woman with a better bloodline and a purer blood.\u201d\nAlthough Su Miaomiao\u2019s body was human, her soul was still a demon, at most she was half human and half demon.\nXie Jingyuan said seriously, \u201cHumans are humans, regardless of blood, don\u2019t discriminate against species.\u201d\nWhen Gu Jialing heard that, he glared at Xu Shou immediately, \u201cThat\u2019s right, the Taoist master doesn\u2019t look down on us, but you look down on us?!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cOkay, Su Miaomiao is a human being, and is a talent, but you could meet more outstanding women, so why rush to choose her?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cMiaomiao is only eighteen years old. She had already won the world-class tennis championship and was admitted to Beijing University based on her own results. You can find only a few who are better than her, regardless of gender.\u201d\nXu Shou was silent.\nGu Jialing also spoke for Su Miaomiao, and punched Xu Shou, \u201cYou can be jealous of the cat, but you can\u2019t tell nonsense with your eyes open. Apart from academic performance and sports awards, Su Miaomiao also has top-notch beauty that other girls can\u2019t match. In ancient times, it was comparable to Su Daji, the kind that only human Emperors could have, although the Taoist master is the master of Qingxu Temple, in terms of status, he can\u2019t compare with an Emperor, right?\u201d\nXu Shou glared at him.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI am indeed far inferior to an Emperor.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThat\u2019s because the Taoist master doesn\u2019t have the heart to be the Emperor, otherwise\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s gaze became stern again.\nGu Jialing also warned Xu Shou, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! Now it is socialism, and the people are the masters of the country. If you want to break the law, the Taoist master will be the first to kill you!\u201d\nXu Shou didn\u2019t want to be a bad person, he just felt that Su Miaomiao was not good enough for Taoist master.\nIn the final analysis, he still regarded Su Miaomiao as a cat demon, and the Taoist master as two different species.\nXie Jingyuan could see what Xu Shou was thinking, and said, \u201cXu Shou, the four of us have lived the longest life, and you have watched the most novels and TV series, please tell me your understanding of the relationship between men and women.\u201d\nXu Shou blushed.\nGu Jialing encouraged him with a playful smile, \u201cMaster Xu, tell us quickly.\u201d\nXu Shou didn\u2019t know where to start.\nXie Jingyuan reminded, \u201cIs it true that you only decide by looking at the other party\u2019s family background?\u201d\nXu Shou shook his head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the other person\u2019s intelligence, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nXu Shou shook his head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the other party\u2019s wealth, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nXu Shou still shook his head.\nNext, no matter what Xie Jingyuan said, including a person\u2019s external conditions, internal talents and even the utilitarian benefits brought about by marriage, etc., Xu Shou shook his head.\nXie Jingyuan concluded, \u201cMy liking for Su Miaomiao has nothing to do with these things, it\u2019s just because she is her.\u201d\n\u201cEven if there was another perfect woman of your imagination, I wouldn\u2019t take another look at her,\u201d his voice was calm, yet firm and powerful.\nAt that moment, a scene emerged from the depths of Xu Shou\u2019s memory.\nIn the village he was guarding, there was once a scholar who met an injured fox demon.\nThe scholar applied medicine to the fox demon. After the fox recovered from her injuries, she turned into a beautiful woman and wanted to make love to the scholar.\nXu Shou knew that it was wrong, humans and demons should not be together, so he drove away the fox demon while the scholar was away. The fox demon would rather offer up her demon pill, lose her cultivation to only be able to accompany the scholar as an ordinary person, and would rather stay with the scholar.\u00a0\nAnd that scholar was not a talented person, nor did he have Pan An\u2019s appearance, just ordinary appearance, and ordinary family background.\nXu Shou thought that the fox demon was grateful to the scholar for the grace of saving her life.\nThe fox demon said, \u201cIt\u2019s not gratitude, I love him, and I am very happy with him.\u201d\nBecause the fox demon insisted, Xu Shou withheld her demon pill for the time being, because he was responsible for other villagers and even the scholar\u2019s family.\nThe fox demon married the scholar in an ordinary human body.\nLater, a wealthy businessman in the county took a fancy to the beauty of the fox demon and offered a hundred gold to the scholar for her.\nThe scholar agreed, and the fox demon was tied to the sedan chair.\nXu Shou stopped the sedan chair on the road, and the people fled in all directions frightened by his deliberately enlarged figure. He opened the sedan chair and saw the fox demon with tears streaming down her face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "184": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-184/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXu Shou returned the fox demon\u2019s core to her. Since then, the fox demon had never appeared again. It was not until the scholar died of illness in middle age that the fox demon came to offer a stick of incense.\n\u201cHey, what are you thinking?\u201d\nA dangling hand appeared in front of his eyes, and Xu Shou returned to reality.\nHe looked at the Taoist master with complicated eyes.\nSo the Taoist master liked Su Miaomiao, but was it just like the fox demon\u2019s attachment to the scholar? When one was in love, they just wanted to stay with the person forever.\n\u201cI understand, I respect the Taoist master\u2019s choice,\u201d Xu Shou said calmly.\nIf Su Miaomiao was really the Taoist master\u2019s destined partner, and she could make the Taoist master happy, of course Xu Shou would support the marriage.\nIf Su Miaomiao was not, then sooner or later the Taoist master would be separated from her, even if he would be injured, it would be his life lesson to get over it.\nIn short, with him there, he would never let the Taoist master face the situation where Su Miaomiao could sell him for money.\nXu Shou accepted it, so Gu Jialing also did not object, and asked excitedly, \u201cWhen are you going to confess your love to Su Miaomiao? Do you want me to design a romantic scene for you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026No, I plan to proceed step by step so as not to scare her.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cWhat\u2019s so scary about that? You love her, so you should be happy.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cJust like you, she has always regarded herself as a demon, and it is not so easy to change her mind.\u201d\nGu Jialing rubbed his chin, \u201cYeah, she still wants to treat the Taoist master as a cat slave. If the Taoist master dares to confess, maybe Su Miaomiao will think you have committed a crime.\u201d\nXu Shou glared at him.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s all go to bed early, this is a matter between me and Su Miaomiao, you can just hide it for me, I don\u2019t need help.\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, Xie Jingyuan went back to his room first.\nGu Jialing looked at Xu Shou who was still sitting on the sofa, and suddenly thought of something, then gloatingly asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you always regard the Taoist master as your master? Then in the future, if Su Miaomiao really married the Taoist master, wouldn\u2019t she become your master as well?\u201d\nIn an instant, Xu Shou looked at him with eyes colder than ice.\nGu Jialing trembled with fright, jumped and ran away.\nXu Shou clenched his fists.\nHe regarded the Taoist master as his master, and would only maintain due respect for the Taoist master\u2019s partner, no matter who they were.\nIf Su Miaomiao dared to act like a mistress in front of him, he would\u2026\nXu Shou was stuck.\nIf Su Miaomiao was still a cat, he would bite her cat\u2019s head as a threat, but she was a girl, so he couldn\u2019t think of any suitable threat method.\nIt would be better if he deliberately soiled her white skirt and white shoes.\nIn the end, it was difficult to wash it fast.\nGu Jialing wanted to sleep late, and hung a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign on the doorknob.\nXie Jingyuan got up early to cook, and Xu Shou helped.\nAt 6:30, Su Miaomiao came over for dinner on time. She slept well the previous night, her face was flushed, her skin was fair and soft, and her big eyes were dark and bright.\nAt least Gu Jialing said one thing correctly, Su Miaomiao was very beautiful, more like the legendary fox beauty than the \u201cSu Daji\u201d he had seen in a TV series.\nOf course, if Su Miaomiao heard what he was thinking, she would definitely quarrel with him again. She was a majestic cat, why did they compare her beauty with a fox? The fox\u2019s nose was so sharp, how could it be cuter than a cat\u2019s nose?\nXie Jingyuan came out of the kitchen with Su Miaomiao\u2019s seafood porridge, and smiled when he saw the scene.\nAlthough Xu Shou was not as cheerful as Gu Jialing, and his animal form had the cruelest appearance, in fact he had the best temper.\nDuring their time in Qingxu Temple, Gu Jialing twittered every day. Xu Shou just lowered his own ears silently, Su Miaomiao jumped up and down in front of him and made various provocations, but Xu Shou was also indulgent most of the time. There was only one time he bit Su Miaomiao. After being reminded by the Taoist master, Xu Shou never frightened Su Miaomiao in that way again.\nAfter all, he lived a hundred years longer, so perhaps in Xu Shou\u2019s eyes, Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing were just two children with their own flaws.\nXu Shou had a prejudice against Su Miaomiao the previous night, not because he really thought she was bad, but because the concept of \u201chumans and demons\u201d was too deep-rooted, and because Xu Shou thought too well of his \u201cmaster\u201d.\nBut based on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s understanding of Xu Shou, even if he couldn\u2019t accept it for a while, he would not make any inappropriate actions toward Su Miaomiao.\nJust like Xu Shou couldn\u2019t understand why he helped Su Miaomiao with all the trivial things at first, but he got used to it.\nXie Jingyuan put down the bowl and sat next to Su Miaomiao.\n\u201cTaoist Master, I dreamed of you last night,\u201d Su Miaomiao scooped up a few spoonfuls of porridge, and when she remembered something, she suddenly tilted her head and said to Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s heart tightened, fearing that she would say something inappropriate for children\u2019s ears.\nBefore he could hint, Su Miaomiao had already started talking with a smile, \u201cI dreamed that you turned into a tree, and I lived on the tree. When it rained, you used the branches to protect me from the rain, and you would also become warm after snowing, especially spiritually.\u201d\nXu Shou lowered his head and listened. When Su Miaomiao was halfway through her speech, Xu Shou secretly looked at the Taoist master, and saw that he was looking at her in the eyes, very much like the fox and the scholar back then, but the affection in his eyes was more restrained.\nThe fox\u2019s smiling voice sounded again in his mind and his eating became slower.\nHe was more advanced than Gu Jialing and Su Miaomiao in the concept of Qingxu (pure emptiness). At that time, the Taoist master would never laugh or get angry, and was as cold as ice.\nBut when they reunited in their current life, the coldness in the Taoist master\u2019s eyes had softened a lot, especially when he looked at Su Miaomiao.\nHe always thought that the Taoist master treated Su Miaomiao like a cat or his younger sister. Perhaps, he had already been tempted by Su Miaomiao.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There was no reason for love and it had nothing to do with whether a person was excellent or not.\nIn addition, in all fairness, Su Miaomiao was a genius among cats, and she was also an excellent human.\nAfter eating, Xu Shou collected all the bowls and chopsticks and went to the kitchen.\nIn the past, he would not take the initiative to wash Su Miaomiao\u2019s bowls and chopsticks, although she didn\u2019t need help either.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll take you down,\u201d Xie Jingyuan picked up her bag, and said while supporting her shoulder.\nXie Jingyuan walked her to meet Sister Fang outside the community.\nOn the way, Xie Jingyuan briefly told Su Miaomiao about the conversation he had with Xu Shou and Gu Jialing.\n\u201cIn this way, they will believe that I fell in love with you first.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was very satisfied. She didn\u2019t want Xu Shou to suspect that she had seduced the Taoist master, as she was a reformed cat, so she would not seduce anyone.\n\u201cNow they all think that I have a crush on you, so you have to pay attention to your tone,\u201d Xie Jingyuan explained.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cTaoist Master, I understand, you don\u2019t need to worry!\u201d\nLooking at her confident smiling face, Xie Jingyuan was not so relieved.\nIn the evening, the group of four ate at home.\nWhen Gu Jialing came back from buying groceries, he nestled on the sofa with Su Miaomiao and watched TV. Because Gu Jialing didn\u2019t like to turn on the air conditioner in winter, both of them held a hand warmer in their hands.\nGu Jialing\u2019s mind was not on the TV.\nAfter making sure that the Taoist master started chopping vegetables and would not come out for a short time, Gu Jialing sneaked up to Su Miaomiao and asked in a low voice, \u201cDo you know that the Taoist master likes you?\u201d\nJust as Su Mingan arranged for Gu Jialing to help him take care of his daughter and he turned into a trustless person, Xie Jingyuan asked Gu Jialing to keep the \u201csecret\u201d, and he was not very reliable.\nFortunately, Su Miaomiao was a little smarter than Gu Jialing, and still remembered Xie Jingyuan\u2019s plan, so she pretended to not know and asked, \u201cThe Taoist master likes me?\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s voice became softer, \u201cYeah, last night at the movie theater, he secretly kissed you, we all saw it!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was really surprised because she was asleep at the time and didn\u2019t know there was such a thing as stealing a kiss.\nGu Jialing admired her expression, and snorted, \u201cWhy are you acting so proud? Let me tell you, because you are the only girl in our view, the Taoist master likes you. If I were a female bird, the Taoist master would have definitely liked me.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t believe in those high-sounding reasons like the Taoist master liked Su Miaomiao because of herself. In fact, it was just because of her beauty!\nEven Emperors couldn\u2019t resist Su Daji\u2019s beauty. So how could a pure little Taoist master be able to resist a demon who was more beautiful than a fox?\nMaybe the Taoist master had already been tempted when he brought Su Miaomiao back to Qingxu Temple.\nTherefore, if he was a female bird, with his appearance better than hers, the Taoist master would definitely like him too.\nSu Miaomiao scratched his head directly.\nGu Jialing covered the top of his head and took a deep breath, \u201cWhy do you always strike when you disagree?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glared at him and said, \u201cThe Taoist master would not like you.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m a man.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cEven if you were a female, the Taoist master wouldn\u2019t like you.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao turned off the TV, dragged Gu Jialing to the kitchen, and questioned Xie Jingyuan at the door, \u201cTaoist Master, if he was a woman, would you like him?\u201d Gu Jialing held his head up proudly.\nXie Jingyuan frowned, and Xu Shou looked at Gu Jialing with unkind eyes.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said with a sullen face.\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t believe it, \u201cIsn\u2019t it because of her face that you like Su Miaomiao? If I were a girl, I would definitely look better than her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSo, the two got into an argument because of Gu Jialing\u2019s words?\nAt that time, Xu Shou couldn\u2019t listen to Gu Jialing\u2019s nonsense anymore. It was nothing more than fighting for food and movie tickets with Su Miaomiao, even fighting for the Taoist master\u2019s feelings?\nIt was just making trouble for no reason!\n\u201cEven if you become a woman, you won\u2019t look better than her,\u201d Xu Shou shattered Gu Jialing\u2019s fantasy in a cold voice.\nGu Jialing said as he stared at him, \u201cYou have never seen me as a girl, how do you know?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cIn you birds, the male bird is prettier than the female bird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cOf course.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cI\u2019ve heard some pilgrims talking about it. They all said that the white cat in the temple is more likable than the blue bird. Your male bird form couldn\u2019t compare to her, and you can\u2019t compare to her in human form.\u201d\nGu Jialing couldn\u2019t believe it, \u201cThose people like cats more?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cThink about it for yourself, do children and women often run to find her?\u201d\nHis expression changed. Since Su Miaomiao entered Qingxu Temple, there were indeed many pilgrims who came to see the cat.\nGu Jialing subconsciously looked at his own wings.\nUnfortunately, he had no wings anymore.\nBut even if there was, so what? Such a beautiful and gorgeous blue feather couldn\u2019t compare to an ordinary white cat\u2019s fur.\nGu Jialing returned to the room like a zombie.\nHe didn\u2019t care whether the Taoist master liked him or not, but the fact that in the eyes of everyone, he was not as good-looking as a white cat?\nGu Jialing couldn\u2019t accept it!\nAs soon as he left, the kitchen became extremely quiet.\nAfter a while, Su Miaomiao asked Xu Shou unexpectedly, \u201cYou also think I\u2019m prettier than him?\u201d\nShe thought Xu Shou hated her very much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Gu Jialing stood in the most conspicuous place on the tree every day, and of course the pilgrims were more sought after by the mysterious white cat.\nIt was the first time Su Miaomiao came to know about it and she smiled triumphantly.\nXu Shou looked at the Taoist master.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes, turned around, and chopped vegetables.\nXu Shou thought that the Taoist master clearly had a crush on Su Miaomiao, and obviously wanted to develop their relationship step by step. But he was suddenly exposed by that idiot Gu Jialing. The Taoist master might not know how to deal with Su Miaomiao after that, right?\nXu Shou took Su Miaomiao to the entrance, and asked seriously, \u201cNow that you know that the Taoist master likes you, what are you going to do?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao still remembered the Taoist master\u2019s plan, but she didn\u2019t like to hide it.\nNow that everything was clear, Su Miaomiao smiled and said, \u201cThen I also like the Taoist master!\u201d\nXu Shou said with doubt, \u201cDo you know what love is? Don\u2019t treat Taoist masters like a cat slave.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glared at him, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, liking someone is not just about wanting to be with him, but also having physical desire for him/her!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan who was listening attentively in the kitchen: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe continued chopping vegetables.\nBut he heard familiar brisk footsteps running toward the kitchen, and soon, Su Miaomiao came to him, squeezed between him and the cabinet, put her arms around his neck, then smiled cunningly and said, \u201cTaoist Master, now we can kiss openly, right?\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, without waiting for Xie Jingyuan to speak, Su Miaomiao stood on tiptoe and took the initiative to kiss him.\nXie Jingyuan had to put down the kitchen knife in his hand.\nHe heard Xu Shou\u2019s footsteps, then took a few steps toward that side, and then turned to the bedroom.\nXie Jingyuan hesitated for a few seconds, then sent a voice transmission to Xu Shou, \u201cGo and talk to Gu Jialing.\u201d\nXu Shou wanted to go back to his room, but when he heard the sound transmission from the Taoist master, his body froze.\nDid the Taoist master really care about Gu Jialing, or did he just want to dismiss him temporarily?\nSu Miaomiao wouldn\u2019t do something indecent to the Taoist master in broad daylight, right?\nBut the Taoist master probably liked it, so he had to dismiss him.\nAfter understanding, Xu Shou quickly went to Gu Jialing\u2019s side.\nHe was lying on the bed with dull eyes, as if he had no interest in life.\nXu Shou leaned against the door, stared at him for a while, and said helplessly, \u201cIs appearance so important?\u201d\nGu Jialing said dully, \u201cYes.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201cDid you forget about that black crow?\u201d\nGu Jialing moved his eyes and sat up abruptly.\nXu Shou said earnestly, \u201cIt\u2019s never too late. Su Miaomiao will be protected by the Taoist master in the future. If you want to open a resort independently, it\u2019s better not to be too high-profile. Women demons have lust, and human women are the same. I met a woman who was using force on a handsome young master\u2026\u201d\nPersuaded by Xu Shou\u2019s reasoning and examples, Gu Jialing not only gave up the idea of \u200b\u200bcompeting in beauty, but also became worried about his future.\nXu Shou: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is a society ruled by law, no one will dare to treat you like that, even if there is, the Taoist master will back you up.\u201d\nGu Jialing came to his senses, and jumped out of bed, \u201cDid the Taoist master get angry with me just now? I have to apologize quickly.\u201d\nXu Shou stopped him with a complicated expression, \u201cWait for a while, right now, the Taoist master is not free.\u201d\nWhen the regular sound of cutting vegetables reappeared in the kitchen, Xu Shou waited for another two minutes before opening the door and allowing Gu Jialing to go out.\nGu Jialing walked to the living room and found Su Miaomiao nestled on the sofa. Her posture was lazy, her head was resting on one armrest, and she was holding a hand warmer in her arms, as comfortable as a cat.\nGu Jialing realized something was wrong, \u201cDid the Taoist master give you ice cream again?\u201d\nBecause it was winter, the Taoist master limited their ice cream intake, and they couldn\u2019t eat too much.\nHearing that, Xu Shou, who was walking toward the kitchen, froze again.\nWhat made him even more stiff was Su Miaomiao\u2019s answer, \u201cI was kissed by the Taoist master.\u201d\nThere was also a brief pause in the sound of chopping vegetables in the kitchen.\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes widened, his face was full of disbelief, \u201cDid the Taoist master kiss you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cYes, you told me that the Taoist master likes me, and it happens that I also like him, so we kissed.\u201d\nIn her tone, two people kissing seemed as common as two people playing a game of tennis together.\nFortunately, Gu Jialing was not an ordinary person. He squatted in front of Su Miaomiao, stared at her rosy lips and sniffed, as if the detective had found some clues, nodded and said, \u201cWell, there is indeed the smell of the Taoist master.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at him proudly, \u201cEven if you become a girl, he will not like you, let alone kiss you.\u201d\nThe two had a heated argument about that before but Gu Jialing didn\u2019t care anymore. He sat next to her and said, \u201cIf he wouldn\u2019t love me, then so be it. I don\u2019t want to be loved by anyone. It\u2019s nice to be alone. What if I really meet someone I like, and accidentally give birth to a dozen children? I couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao showed a disdainful expression, \u201cYou birds are so fertile, no wonder the mountains and forests are always so noisy.\u201d\nGu Jialing probably didn\u2019t think \u201cbeing able to give birth\u201d was an advantage, so it was rare that he didn\u2019t argue with her.\nHe tried to imagine the Taoist master and Su Miaomiao kissing, suddenly smiled and asked in a low voice, \u201cHow are the Taoist master\u2019s kissing skills? He was a Taoist master and had no experience in two lifetimes. Was the first kiss bad?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao remembered that the Taoist master had said that she could not share those private matters with the outside world, and did not answer.\nGu Jialing continued to ask, \u201cAre you two developing too fast? But I knew a long time ago that the Taoist master is so good, once he confesses his love, you would definitely accept him.\u201d\nAt that moment, Xu Shou suddenly took out an onion and asked Gu Jialing to peel it.\nGu Jialing protested, \u201cWhy did you give me the most difficult task?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The mouth was for talking, and he couldn\u2019t bear to shut up.\nHe was sitting in front of the coffee table peeling. Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t stand the smell of the onion, so she went to lie down on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bed and wait.\nGu Jialing was crying and talking to himself.\nHalf an hour later, dinner was ready, and Xie Jingyuan finally walked out of the kitchen.\nHe looked as usual, it seemed as if he had never kissed Su Miaomiao, nor had he heard the content of the chat between Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing.\nThe four of them sat down, and Gu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan with a smile, \u201cTaoist Master, you just fell in love\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou immediately tore off the steamed bun in his hand, stuffed half of it into his mouth, but didn\u2019t eat the other half, and put it aside.\nSeeing that Gu Jialing was feeling wronged, Xu Shou warned in a cold voice, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything wrong.\u201d\nAfter staring at Gu Jialing, Xu Shou also glanced at Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao thought that she had done nothing wrong and ate fish with peace of mind.\nGu Jialing took the steamed bun out of his mouth, and muttered softly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say don\u2019t do evil to others?\u201d\nAfter eating, Su Miaomiao said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cCome to my room when you are done with work, and help me warm the bed.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked over suspiciously, while Xu Shou lowered his eyes stiffly.\nHe frowned and said, \u201cHow can you help her warm the bed? Let me tell you, I promised her father to keep an eye on her for him, and not allow men to be in the same room with her alone, including you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him, and put his index finger on the collar of his sweater.\nGu Jialing felt as if his sweater would automatically heat up, as it was several degrees warmer than before.\nXie Jingyuan put down his hand and explained lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s warm now.\u201d\nGu Jialing understood, and said excitedly, \u201cYou should go and come back quickly, and then help me warm the bed when you come back!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cMy spiritual power is limited, I should reserve it for emergencies, and not waste it on such trivial things.\u201d\nGu Jialing was upset, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a waste to warm her up?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao, held her hand and said, \u201cShe is my girlfriend now, our relationship is different.\u201d\nXu Shou went directly to the kitchen.\nAs soon as they left, Su Miaomiao rushed over, hugged Xie Jingyuan\u2019s waist, and asked in a low voice, \u201cTaoist Master, you can warm the bed like this, last time\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u2018Why did you use such a troublesome way to warm me up last time, causing me to wait a few minutes longer?\u2019\nXie Jingyuan pressed her lips, and explained in her mind, \u201cYou have worked hard in training, so I wanted to use all my spiritual power to help you relieve physical fatigue. It is too wasteful to use it to warm the quilt.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood that there was no need to waste spiritual power on trivial matters that could be solved by physical means.\nThe Taoist was the Taoist, and he was very considerate in everything he did.\nSu Miaomiao tiptoed and wanted to kiss him again, but he turned his head in time and greeted her kiss with his face, making her pout.\nXie Jingyuan patted her head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be seen by them.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at the kitchen, and she saw Gu Jialing sneaking his head out.\nShe glared at him and went home.\nXie Jingyuan went to the kitchen to help clean up.\nGu Jialing peeped at him frequently while scrubbing the dishes.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cSpeak up if you have something to say.\u201d\nGu Jialing immediately asked, \u201cMaster, you kissed on the first day of your relationship, would you do more\u2026 indecent things later?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and said, \u201cBefore marriage, we will do nothing more than kissing.\u201d\nGu Jialing breathed a long sigh of relief, \u201cThat\u2019s good. After all, I promised her father not to let a man spend the night there, but you are the Taoist master, and I don\u2019t want to separate the mandarin duck\u2026\u201d\nHe went blah blah blah, blah blah. Until Xie Jingyuan went out, he hadn\u2019t finished speaking.\nXu Shou interrupted him coldly, \u201cShut up, the Taoist master is not that kind of man.\u201d\nAlthough the relationship between men and women was open in modern society, it was natural for such things to happen before marriage, but who was the Taoist master? How could he waste the 26 years of etiquette of his previous life for a moment of pleasure?\nWhile Su Miaomiao was still brushing her teeth in her apartment, Xie Jingyuan used physical methods to warm her bed again, and when she came over, he had already buckled his belt.\nIn another week, the heating would be turned on, and that way of warming the bed could be over.\nSu Miaomiao got into the bed, and the big quilt covered her body, only her head was exposed, with black and messy hair, and a flushed face.\nSeeing Xie Jingyuan walking toward the door, Su Miaomiao asked knowingly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kiss me?\u201d\nAlthough he was fierce when kissing, after getting used to it, she also liked that kind of intimacy.\nXie Jingyuan tilted his head, and met her expectant eyes, almost like asking him for ice cream.\nXie Jingyuan turned off the light and walked to her side.\nHe actually didn\u2019t quite understand whether she would have that kind of worldly desire, or whether she only regarded kissing as a ritual between lovers.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d In the darkness, Xie Jingyuan pressed her forehead and asked.\nSu Miaomiao blinked and gasped, \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cApart from heat, what else?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stretched out her hand from under the quilt, wrapped her arms around his neck, and said softly, \u201cI want to consummate with you, I think that it will be fun.\u201d\nShe had no experience in that area, but she had observed it on the roof of a brothel for a month.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t think about those things before, but during the few kisses, some images popped up in her mind of how the Taoist master would also get into her bed, and that he would also\u2026\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help but rub her head against his neck. She didn\u2019t even realize that her hand had actually penetrated into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s collar, but it was held tightly by him.\nSu Miaomiao protested vigorously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Taoist master must be afraid of the punishment of the patriarch, so he didn\u2019t dare to overstep his rules.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan covered her with the quilt, input spiritual power, closed the door and left.\nGu Jialing sat on the sofa, staring intently at the clock on the wall.\nWhen Xie Jingyuan came in, Gu Jialing couldn\u2019t help questioning, \u201cYou just went to warm the bed, why weren\u2019t you back after twenty minutes? Your spell is so effective, three minutes is enough, and the remaining seventeen minutes, one minute to walk, um, six minutes for kissing, what did you do for the other ten minutes?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t change his expression as he said, \u201cI mopped the floor.\u201d\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t quite believe it.\nXu Shou glared at him, \u201cIt\u2019s only been ten minutes, what do you think the Taoist master could do in it?\u201d\nWould ten minutes be enough?\nBut any burly villager would not take such a short time, let alone the Taoist master.\nThe most important thing was that the Taoist master would never do anything to Su Miaomiao before marriage.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe knew that Xu Shou had good intentions, but was it really appropriate to say such words?\nHe went straight back to the room.\nIn the living room, Gu Jialing was still arguing with Xu Shou about what people could do in ten minutes.\nIn mid-November, the heating was finally turned on in Beijing, and there seemed to be two seasons inside and outside the house.\nWith the progress of the university courses, the homework became more complicated, and in addition they had to prepare for the final exam in early January. Even Gu Jialing was too busy and had to shorten the time for playing games. Xie Jingyuan and Xu Shou, the two double-major geniuses, were even more busy.\nAs for Su Miaomiao, in addition to preparing for the final exam, she also had to prepare for the upcoming Australian Open in January.\nThat was to say, she and Xie Jingyuan lived next door, and they could exchange a deep kiss before going to bed. Even if they were in the same university, it would be difficult for them to find time to date as both of them were so busy.\nThe time for the final exam was different for different majors.\nSu Miaomiao, for example, completed the exams for all subjects on January 6th, and the winter vacation officially started. Xie Jingyuan and the others exams hadn\u2019t even started yet.\nShe would fly directly from Beijing to Australia. She would spend more than half of her winter vacation on the field. Fortunately, she could still go home before New Year\u2019s Eve.\nBecause Anshi was so close, Su Mingan and Tang Shiwei also took a day off to go to Beijing to send their daughter off to the plane.\n\u201cPlay the game happily, you don\u2019t need to be burdened. Come home to celebrate the New Year after the game, and mom and I will make your favorite dumplings for you.\u201d\nAt the airport, Tang Shiwei hugged her daughter reluctantly.\nSu Mingan took the time to communicate with Sister Fang, hoping that she would help take good care of his daughter.\nSister Fang smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there is a whole team behind Miaomiao.\u201d\nSu Mingan nodded repeatedly.\nHis daughter had gone abroad for competitions more than a dozen times, and he had also accompanied her a few times, so there was really nothing to worry about. Besides, his daughter was not an obedient character to be bullied.\n\u201cAlright, let Jing Yuan talk to Miaomiao.\u201d\nTang Shiwei looked at Xie Jingyuan who had been standing quietly a few steps away, and pulled her husband away with a smile.\nSu Miaomiao walked up to Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan said in a low voice, \u201cI will return to Anshi on the 26th, a few days earlier than you, and I will pick you up then.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded.\nThen, she tiptoed and skillfully climbed onto Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder.\nXie Jingyuan paused, hugged her and turned around, with his back to the three elders.\nSu Mingan: \u201c!!!\u201d\nAt four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Xie Rong, the chairman of the group with a net worth of hundreds of billions, returned to the Pearl Garden community in a low-key manner.\nGrandma Tao was in Su\u2019s house in 1001, waiting to watch the live broadcast of the Australian Open singles final on time at 4:30.\nSu Mingan and Tang Shiwei cut the fruits and brought them over, and sat with Grandma Tao.\nJust on the counter below the TV, there were two runner-up awards for Su Miaomiao\u2019s Wimbledon and US Open wins the previous year.\nSu Miaomiao won the China Open, but the trophy was in the apartment she rented and had not been brought back yet.\nGrandma Tao: \u201cThe more I look at these two cups, the more they look like melon seed cups.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201cOkay, when Miaomiao comes back with the championship trophy, we\u2019ll use them to put melon seeds to entertain guests during the Chinese New Year.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cThat\u2019s too ostentatious. If you really want to show off, you have to save it for more important occasions.\u201d\nBefore Su Mingan could answer, he heard the doorbell, so he ran to open the door, only to find Xie Rong.\nSu Mingan joked, \u201cThank you for being so busy, why did you take so much time to come back?\u201d\nXie Rong smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s Miaomiao\u2019s big day, if I wasn\u2019t afraid of being compared to you, her own father, I would have flown over there to see the scene.\u201d\nThe two middle-aged men punched each other and came to the living room.\n\u201cWhen will Jing Yuan come back? I see that other college students are already on vacation.\u201d\nGrandma Tao explained, \u201cHe has a lot to study doing two majors, but he will be home at noon tomorrow.\u201d\nXie Rong glanced at the TV screen and said with a smile, \u201cHe will pick this day, as Miaomiao will be back in two days.\u201d\nHalf a month ago, Xie Jingyuan dared to kiss his daughter in front of his face at the Beijing airport. His anger still persisted to that day. Although it was his daughter who kissed him first, Xie Jingyuan shouldn\u2019t have kissed her for that long.\nThe four of them were talking about their current situation, and before they knew it, it was half past four.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Su Miaomiao booked a flight ticket back to Anshi on the 29th, and the plane landed at 3:00 pm.\nTang Shiwei, the director of obstetrics and gynecology, had to go to the hospital to work overtime, and the glorious task of taking her daughter home fell on Su Mingan.\nTang Shiwei was still worried in the hospital, so she called Su Mingan before he left and reminded him to take Xie Jingyuan with him.\nSu Mingan: \u201cWhy? So that I could watch the two of them have a hot kiss at the airport?\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cYoung people are like that, if he didn\u2019t want to kiss our Miaomiao, I would have been anxious.\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cStop talking nonsense, if you drive there by yourself, don\u2019t even think about having a good time this year!\u201d\nSu Mingan had no choice but to knock on the door of 1002.\nXie Jingyuan was also preparing to go out, and was wearing a white down jacket.\nSu Mingan narrowed his eyes slightly, \u201cHow could a big boy wear such a color?\u201d\nHis daughter\u2019s clothes were almost all white, and the brat usually wore dark clothes, but he deliberately wanted to wear a couple outfit with his daughter, right?\nBefore Xie Jingyuan opened his mouth, Grandma Tao who came over to see off her grandson smiled and said, \u201cI bought it for Jingyuan, isn\u2019t it very beautiful?\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026Well, of course it is.\u201d\nGrandma Tao waved her hand, \u201cThen you two go, come here to eat at night!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded, closed the door outside, and followed Su Mingan to the elevator.\nThere was silence in the elevator.\nWhen a new message notification came from Xie Jingyuan\u2019s phone, Su Mingan glanced over secretly, and found that the person chatting with Xie Jingyuan turned out to have a cute avatar that only girls could use.\n\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Su Mingan asked nonchalantly.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cCheng Yue, Miaomiao and I were her classmates in kindergarten.\u201d\nSu Mingan remembered those few good friends of theirs, and his expression eased, \u201cWhat is she talking about with you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cShe organized some friends we know from elementary school, middle school, and high school who wanted to go to congratulate Miaomiao, they rented a bus, and now they also set off for the airport.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe and his wife were always worried that their daughter had no good friends other than Xie Jingyuan, but then there was a bus of classmates going to the airport to congratulate their daughter on her return after winning the championship.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him, and took out a small pack of tissues from his pocket, which he had put for Su Miaomiao.\nSu Mingan froze for a moment, and then concealed, \u201cI have a bit of a cold recently.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t expose him either.\nOn the way to the airport, he asked who the students were.\nCheng Yue sent the list to Xie Jingyuan earlier, and he read it intermittently while waiting for the red light, and Su Mingan even remembered it.\n\u201cHey, didn\u2019t this kid fight with Miaomiao?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIs this girl prettier than Miaomiao?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I have no impression.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s memory was indeed very good, but in the previous eighteen years, he was either taking care of Su Miaomiao or reading books. Except for the faces of the teachers of various subjects and some classmates who he had a lot of contact with, Xie Jingyuan, never deliberately went to see other ordinary classmates including this girl whom Cheng Yue marked as a middle school classmate that he had just known the name but had no memory of.\nSu Mingan held the steering wheel and smiled mysteriously.\nSo what if he was a top student, he still answered wrong. The correct answer should be\u2014\u201dImpossible, there is no girl in this world who is more beautiful than Miaomiao!\u201d\nAt the airport, in the waiting hall, Cheng Yue, Zhou Yao, Feng Xiaoyu, and Lin Xi were all there, including more than forty youthful young men and women standing behind them.\nBesides them, there were also many reporters waiting to interview the returning champion.\nKnowing that Cheng Yue and the others were Su Miaomiao\u2019s classmates, the reporters interviewed them first. The champion\u2019s school life when she was a child was also a point of national interest.\nCheng Yue was studying journalism.\nShe had already anticipated the situation, so she prepared the students on the bus, and stipulated several prohibitions, including not to speak ill of Su Miaomiao, not to talk about her puppy love with Xie Jingyuan, and not to say anything about how she liked to sleep in between classes and so on.\nSu Mingan was still a little worried at first, but when he got close to his daughter\u2019s old classmates and heard all kinds of praises from the classmates for his daughter, Su Mingan suddenly became a little uncertain. Was the helpful student really his daughter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Only Sister Fang booked a plane ticket to Anshi with her, and she had to send her to her family in person to rest assured.\nThe two dragged a suitcase each and walked out wearing masks.\n\u201cSu Miaomiao!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMiaomiao, I love you!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMiaomiao, you were the best!\u201d\nEnthusiastic shouts swept over like thunder, Su Miaomiao was stunned, stopped, and stared blankly at the rows of heads outside the isolation zone.\nSome she recognized, such as the friends she knew in kindergarten, and Yu Le, a female classmate she met in high school.\nIn Su Miaomiao\u2019s eyes, the rest were all strangers.\nBut everyone was excited and smiling at her.\nSu Miaomiao remembered that Sister Fang said that she already had a group of fans, and maybe some fans would come to pick her up.\nFans were people who liked her.\nSu Miaomiao smiled at the fans.\n\u201cSu Miaomiao, sign for me!\u201d A fan raised a tennis ball in his hand.\nSu Miaomiao went to sign some. But she didn\u2019t have much patience, and when she didn\u2019t want to sign any more, Su Miaomiao finally reunited with her father, the Taoist master and the others.\nAccompanied by her most familiar family members and friends, Su Miaomiao answered some reporters\u2019 questions.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just answer the last question before going home to celebrate the New Year!\u201d\n\u201cMiaomiao, I heard that Xie Jingyuan is your boyfriend. Is that true?\u201d\nSu Mingan\u2019s face darkened, he had already clearly denied it before, why did the reporter ask again?\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan beside her, but after receiving hints from Xie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes, she said disobediently, \u201cYes, he is my boyfriend.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe reporters were shocked, but then they rushed to take pictures of the two of them. The old classmates who lined up on the side of the isolation zone all showed ambiguous smiles of \u201cI knew it was so\u201d.\nBecause\u2013\nThe whole kindergarten knew that Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao were in the same group.\nThe whole elementary school knew that Xie Jingyuan was always inseparable from Su Miaomiao.\nEveryone in middle school knew that Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao were in puppy love.\nEveryone in high school knew that Xie Jingyuan was Su Miaomiao\u2019s filial boyfriend.\nEveryone in Beijing knew that Xie Jingyuan, the prodigy, and Su Miaomiao, the tennis champion, were in a clingy relationship.\nNow, the whole world would soon know that Xie Jingyuan was Su Miaomiao\u2019s official boyfriend.\n\u2014\nOn the eve of her university graduation, Su Miaomiao was very busy in Europe.\nThere was the Madrid Open in early May. After the match, Su Miaomiao decided to stay in Europe and prepare for the French Open at the end of the month, while revising her graduation thesis in her spare time.\nThree days before the final of the French Open, Su Miaomiao made an exception to conduct her graduation defense through online video due to special circumstances.\nIn the past four years of university life, although she had to take care of competitions, her professional grades had never fallen behind. Even if she sometimes missed classes because of competitions, the three good roommates would always take class notes and key knowledge in time. After sending it to her, Su Miaomiao seized the time to review after the competition. With such hard work, her grades had remained at an excellent level.\nAt the end of the defense, Su Miaomiao looked nervously at the seven teachers in the camera, as well as her roommate Zhao Lu who stood aside to help her with the video.\nThe two members of Qingxu Temple and the Taoist master had graduated successfully, so she couldn\u2019t be left behind.\nFortunately, the teachers affirmed her performance after asking a few questions.\nBefore the end of the video, the teachers also smiled and kindly wished her that she would continue to win the Grand Slam that year.\nZhao Lu blinked at Su Miaomiao and turned off the video.\nAnd Su Miaomiao, who finished her graduation defense, finally no longer had any worries, and won the French Open championship, the intermediate tour championships, and the Wimbledon championship that was also held in Europe in early July.\nOn July 20th, Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t wait to fly back to Beijing.\nSu Miaomiao and Sister Fang came out dragging their suitcases. As usual, they saw enthusiastic reporters and fans, as well as Xie Jingyuan wearing a white casual outfit.\nTwenty-two-year-old Xie Jingyuan was nearly 1.9 meters tall, and his facial features had completely faded from the youthfulness of high school, and his temperament had become colder and restrained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s obviously his talent. He is a genius recognized by Beijing University. Have you forgotten the super hair growth liquid that got popular all over the world? It\u2019s just a senior who accidentally participated in Jingshen\u2019s sophomore year research project, and then casually succeeded, and made billions!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI heard that Jingshen established his own pharmaceutical company last year, and domestic and foreign giants rushed to invest. In a few years, would he be richer than his father?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so envious of Su Miaomiao, why wasn\u2019t I his childhood sweetheart?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m also very envious. If you fall in love with him, you don\u2019t have to worry about hair loss!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t just be limited to the top of the head.\u201d\nAfter the memories were over, Su Miaomiao had already reached where Xie Jingyuan was.\nOne rushed forward, and the other opened his arms tacitly. In a blink of an eye, Su Miaomiao leaned into the familiar embrace and smelled the familiar scent of autumn dew.\nIt didn\u2019t matter whether there were reporters around to take pictures, Su Miaomiao just missed him very much.\nXie Jingyuan patted her head, protected her in his arms with one hand, blocked the reporters in front with the other, led her slowly out of the airport, and got into his black car parked outside.\nAs soon as the car door was closed, the noise outside was cut off, and the world seemed to be quiet.\nSu Miaomiao nodded, then turned on the air conditioner all the way.\nAfter she drank half of the bottle in one go and put away the water bottle, Xie Jingyuan drove off and left the airport.\nSu Miaomiao sat crookedly, looking at him intently while chatting, \u201cWhere are Xu Shou and the others?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cXu Shou went to Xie Group and is still at the stage of familiarizing himself with the business. He is not in Beijing now. Gu Jialing bought a piece of land between Anshi and Beijing and is about to start building a resort. He may be busier than Xu Shou. So they didn\u2019t have time to come pick you up.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao knew Gu Jialing\u2019s current situation very well because he would post various videos in the four-person chat group every day. The day before, he was at the construction site, and the video was full of excavators. The next day, he ran to the green plant cultivation base to take pictures of various landscape trees.\nGu Jialing had also made various drawings of the resort, most of which were his own ideas, and there were also suggestions provided by the professors of Beijing University. After modification, the final concept drawing was very beautiful.\nHe also said that she and Xie Jingyuan would hold a wedding at his resort in the future.\nXie Jingyuan parked the car, looked at her and asked, \u201cDo you want to stay in the lakeside community tonight, or go to my place?\u201d\nAt the beginning of June, Gu Jialing withdrew the lease of the apartment in the lakeside community. If he and Xu Shou came to Beijing, they would stay in the villa he bought near the company.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s apartment was rented until October that year. Xie Jingyuan just cleaned it the previous night, and the quilt was also dried out.\nSu Miaomiao rubbed her stomach and asked, \u201cWhich one is closest? I\u2019m hungry and want to eat quickly.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the green signal light ahead, and said while driving, \u201cThen let\u2019s go to my house, it will probably take more than forty minutes.\u201d\nForty minutes was long enough, Su Miaomiao pouted, lowered the seat, closed her eyes and took a nap.\nXie Jingyuan concentrated on driving and only looked at her while waiting for the red light to turn green.\nTang Shiwei called, and Su Miaomiao answered with squinted eyes.\n\u201cHere we are, now in the Taoist master\u2019s car.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s good, you have a good rest tonight, and we\u2019ll video chat tomorrow.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao seemed to have heard her father\u2019s voice, but her mother hung up too quickly, so she had no idea what her father wanted to say.\nSu Mingan muttered, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask Miaomiao where she will stay tonight?\u201d\nTang Shiwei: \u201cEven if she goes back to the lakeside community, what young people really want to do they will do. Jing Yuan could still stay overnight.\u201d\nSu Mingan wanted to say more, but she glared at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s hard for Jing Yuan to be able to restrain himself until now. Think about your virtues back then. According to your thinking, my dad should have tied you up and beat you?\u201d\nSu Mingan finally stopped nagging.\nThinking of her daughter, Tang Shiwei was very happy for her.\nFour years in university, her daughter was busy, often flying international flights, and Xie Jingyuan was even busier. So when her daughter didn\u2019t have to go to class, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s company had started to get on the right track. The two could finally have a good relationship. As revealed to her, the young couple only had time to kiss for a while at night, and they would separate after kissing for more than ten minutes.\nOf course, Tang Shiwei guessed that Xie Jingyuan might be too thin-skinned (shy) and didn\u2019t dare to delay for too long, lest he be laughed at by Xu Shou and Gu Jialing who used to live in 801 together.\nAt nine o\u2019clock in the evening, Xie Jingyuan finally drove back to the villa.\nSu Miaomiao was hungry and sleepy, so she got out of the car and climbed onto Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back.\nShe tilted her head to observe his new home.\nShe went there the previous year when Xie Jingyuan first bought it. After more than a year of construction, the villa had changed a lot. There was a four-story main building in the middle, which was his personal research and development center.\nEntering the lobby of the main building, Xie Jingyuan put Su Miaomiao on the sofa, rolled up his sleeves and said to her, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the kitchen to make noodles for you. If you want to rest, you can rest. If you want to go upstairs to see my room, just go. Xu Shou and Gu Jialing\u2019s rooms are on the second floor, there are signs on the door, you\u2019d better not go in.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was so hungry that she waved her hand and told him to cook the noodles.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan left, Su Miaomiao was lying on the sofa. If she wanted to visit upstairs, she would have to eat enough to be strong.\nThe fish balls were prepared by Xie Jingyuan in the morning, so they were cooked very quickly. In ten minutes, a large bowl of delicious fish ball noodles was brought to Su Miaomiao, and the temperature was controlled just right by his spiritual power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "192": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-192/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao sat at the dining table, gorging on noodles, as if she hadn\u2019t been eating in the past three months abroad.\nAfter eating and drinking, Su Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan and suddenly smiled, \u201cTaoist Master, you are very much like your previous life, except for your hair.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes passed over her face and body, but he didn\u2019t say anything.\nSu Miaomiao stood up and walked over to hold his arm, \u201cOkay, now take me to visit your villa.\u201d\nShe was so close, and the summer clothes were thin, Xie Jingyuan was inevitably touched by her elbow.\nHe tried his best to keep the distance away, but before he moved, Su Miaomiao immediately stuck to him again.\nHe had no choice but to deliberately not pay attention to her.\nThe second floor had two bedrooms, a study and a gym. The third floor had the same layout. One bedroom was for Grandma Tao and the other was a guest room. If Xie Rong or Su Mingan and his wife come over, they could both stay in the guest room.\nThere were two bedrooms on the fourth floor, one for Xie Jingyuan, and the other for Su Miaomiao. The interior had been decorated according to her preferences, even the cupboards in the cloakroom were half-filled with clothes, skirts, shoes, bags, all in the white color that Su Miaomiao liked.\nA row of jewelry cabinets were also designed in the cloakroom, above which were display cabinets.\nAt that moment, in the empty display cabinet, there was an exquisite gift box.\n\u201cThis is a graduation gift for you. I\u2019ll buy the rest when you see which one you like.\u201d\nAs Su Miaomiao became more picky about jewelry, and was no longer the same person who would like whatever style Xie Jingyuan picked.\nSu Miaomiao took the gift box and opened it. Inside was a diamond necklace, and the pendant was a little white cat that was almost exactly the same as her original shape.\nShe couldn\u2019t take her eyes off it. She had seen enough. She was about to wear it when she suddenly remembered that she hadn\u2019t taken a shower after taking the flight all the way.\n\u201cYou take it first, I\u2019m going to take a shower!\u201d Su Miaomiao happily ran into the bathroom.\nXie Jingyuan smiled, giving her favorite necklace was so ritualistic.\nHowever, when he was walking out with the necklace in his hand, and accidentally caught sight of those white skirts, his whole body froze suddenly.\nApart from the toiletries, there was no change of clothes in the bathroom. She ran in in a hurry and forgot to take them.\nAt that moment, the sound of water came from the bathroom.\nXie Jingyuan had no choice but to go to his room first, and after sitting for a while, he found a pen and paper, wrote a note reminding Su Miaomiao to change clothes, and posted it in a prominent place where she could see it when she walked out of the bathroom. The necklace was also hung by the side, to make sure she could see it.\nAfter finishing all that, Xie Jingyuan went back to his room again.\nNot long after, he received a call from Su Miaomiao, asking him to go downstairs to the hall and bring up her suitcase. The reason was that there was a beautiful dress Su Miaomiao bought in it, which she was going to wear.\nOf course Xie Jingyuan would satisfy her demand.\nA few minutes later, he stood at the door of her room, opened a crack in the door, pushed the suitcase in, and closed it again.\nBefore Xie Jingyuan walked away, he heard her cheerful running footsteps, heard her flatten the suitcase and unzip it.\nThe beautiful dress must be white again, right?\nXie Jingyuan thought silently.\nHe didn\u2019t go back to the room, but walked to the French window on the south side and looked into the distance of the villa.\nThere were no tall buildings nearby, and the vast night was in front of his eyes, and the stars were twinkling like her favorite diamonds.\nWhen he heard the door opening, he turned around.\nSu Miaomiao came out, wearing a dark gold suspender dress studded with diamonds.\nXie Jingyuan only had time to see the large bare area under her neck, and immediately lowered his eyes and turned his back.\nSu Miaomiao bought that new dress in Paris, but she had been playing competitions since then, so she hadn\u2019t had a chance to wear it yet.\nSister Fang was by her side when she was shopping for clothes, and even made a joke to Su Miaomiao, \u201cWon\u2019t your Taoist master get a nosebleed looking at you in it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t connect the beautiful dress with his nosebleed at all.\nSeeing that Xie Jingyuan looked away without admiring her new dress, Sister Fang\u2019s joke rang in Su Miaomiao\u2019s ears again.\nShe hurried over, ran to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, and poked her head to look at his face.\nNoticing Xie Jingyuan\u2019s evasive gesture, Su Miaomiao asked strangely, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nIn the past, every time they reunited after a competition, when only the two of them were left alone, the Taoist master would look at her with a very focused look, and then he would hold her in his arms or push her against the wall, and kiss her deeply.\nBut he was avoiding her at that moment and because of her approaching, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s body deflected a little more.\nEven though Su Miaomiao had grown up, she had never worn such a mature style of dress, so mature that she looked like a different person.\nIt seemed that Su Miaomiao who had been sticking to him like a child all of a sudden grew up and became charming.\nBut Xie Jingyuan also knew that she had started to change as early as in high school, but it was covered up by her usual casual and loose dressing style.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for him being known as her boyfriend early on, and if she wasn\u2019t too outstanding and dazzling, there would have been countless men who pursued her.\n\u201cHow did you come up with the idea of \u200b\u200bbuying this style of dress?\u201d\nAfter a moment of silence, Xie Jingyuan asked outside the window, deliberately not even looking at her figure reflected in the glass window next to her.\nHowever, in the peripheral vision, there was still a large area of \u200b\u200bwhite (her skin), like rolling snow hills, reflecting the bright lights of the hall.\n\u201cIt looks good that even if I don\u2019t move, the diamonds on it still shine,\u201d Su Miaomiao looked down at the new dress.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at the hem of her skirt, the diamonds were like stars inlaid in the dark golden sky, shining with pearls. He could imagine her surprised expression when she encountered that dress in the glass cabinet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty, but it\u2019s not suitable for everyday wear.\u201d Xie Jingyuan commented in the usual tone, and then suggested to her, \u201cChange it, and be careful, the diamonds may fall.\u201d\nThose diamonds were the selling point, and they were not so easy to get rid of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She jumped forward, and skillfully hooked her hands around Xie Jingyuan\u2019s neck. Of course, Xie Jingyuan was too tall, so he had to lower down cooperatively.\nWith that height, Xie Jingyuan saw more things that shouldn\u2019t be seen.\nHe had no choice but to hug Su Miaomiao into his arms and put his chin on her forehead.\nSu Miaomiao leaned on him nostalgically, and came to smell the autumn dew on his body again.\nIt was refreshing and made people feel cold, but she could always feel at ease.\nXie Jingyuan lifted her up subconsciously, letting her step on his shoe.\nIn the past four years, the two often kissed each other, but never once did Su Miaomiao dress that way.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t know where to put his hands. Holding her shoulders was too dangerous. Holding her waist, with such a thin layer of clothing, was not much safer than shoulders.\nBefore losing control of his body, Xie Jingyuan suddenly picked up Su Miaomiao and sent her back to the room.\nHe turned off the light first, and then put Su Miaomiao on her big bed. When he was about to stand up straight, Su Miaomiao tightly hooked his neck.\n\u201cYou sleep with me,\u201d Su Miaomiao just missed him after being separated for so long.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s breathing was already chaotic, and he said in a low voice, \u201cWait a little longer, I will ask for your hand from uncle and aunt on National Day.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t listen, she only cared about the present. So she just wanted Xie Jingyuan to accompany her.\nXie Jingyuan had no choice but to grab her two arms, ready to forcibly break free from her shackles.\nSensing his attempt, Su Miaomiao immediately raised her legs and entangled him like a koala.\nXie Jingyuan slipped and fell into the soft and comfortable big bed together with her.\nWhile Su Miaomiao was like a goblin who had successfully captured its prey, holding him tightly with her hands and feet, not giving him a chance to leave.\nShe, who was smiling smugly, suddenly realized something was wrong.\nIf she was just a simple little goblin, Xie Jingyuan, who was pressing on her, would breathe like an old goblin struggling on the verge of sanity and collapse.\n\u201cTaoist Master, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Su Miaomiao finally loosened the grip on his neck and looked at his face in confusion.\nIn the next second, Xie Jingyuan kissed her, more greedy and hot than ever before.\nIn the spacious and dark master bedroom, without any neighbors, under Xie Jingyuan\u2019s acquiescence and connivance, Su Miaomiao responded to his every movement.\nWhen he kissed her neck and lingered there, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t know what was going on, and pushed his head down.\nShe felt Xie Jingyuan stiff for a second, and then Su Miaomiao hugged his head tightly.\nThere were some shattering noises, and it was the dress that got in the way, being thrown on the floor.\nWith a bang, Su Miaomiao accidentally bumped her head against the bedside when dodging.\nOnce, Su Miaomiao met a tree in the forest. It was a kind of demon that had already grown its spiritual wisdom and its spiritual marrow.\nUnfortunately, at the same time, the one who found the tree was a leopard who was stronger than her. Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t beat the leopard, so she could only hide in the grass, watching the leopard scratch a hole in the tree with its claws, revealing the pool of sweet spiritual marrow inside. She could only watch helplessly as the leopard stuck out his long tongue and sucked all the precious spiritual marrow.\nIt turned out that the Taoist master also knew that kind of black magic?\nDid he want to eat her pill?\nNo, she didn\u2019t have a demon pill\u2026\nOh, Su Miaomiao finally remembered, she had seen that kind of scene in the brothel.\nBut how could the Taoist master do it? Could it be that he also went to the brothel to peep?\nHowever, Su Miaomiao soon lost the energy to think wildly.\nWhile she could only lie limply on the bed, Xie Jingyuan walked away without looking back, strode to his room, and pushed open the bathroom door.\nStill surrounded by her breath and the sounds she made, Xie Jingyuan turned on the shower and closed his eyes.\nAfter an unknown amount of time, when Xie Jingyuan walked out and leaned against the sink to wipe his head with downcast eyes, a calendar appeared in his mind.\nHe wanted to accompany her to see Su Mingan and his wife that weekend, and get the certificate immediately after getting permission.\nObtaining the certificate meant formal marriage, and the wedding could be held at another time.\nBut if he did it that way, would his intention be too obvious?\nShe still had to prepare for the US Open at the end of August, the last round of that year\u2019s Grand Slam. Would temporary indulgence affect her performance of the game?\nAfter the impulse passed, Xie Jingyuan was still firm in his original plan.\nHe decided to propose marriage after the year\u2019s China Open. She had almost no matches in the fourth quarter, so she could just adapt.\nAfter changing his clothes, Xie Jingyuan walked to the bathroom, and when he looked up, he found Su Miaomiao lying on his bed.\n\u201cWhy did you take so long to bathe?\u201d Su Miaomiao rubbed her eyes, because she almost fell asleep after waiting for a long time.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026Why did you come here?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao braced herself up, sat up and said, \u201cI want to help you to be happy.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t quite understand what she meant, but it was all about that aspect.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need it,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said coldly.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t believe it, she lifted the quilt and walked over, reaching out to greet him.\nHe held down her hand, afraid of chaos in time.\nSu Miaomiao blinked, suddenly smiled, and looked up at him, \u201cTaoist Master, you\u2019re blushing, are you shy?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said without changing his face, \u201cBlushing is a normal body change after bathing.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood, and looked at his body suspiciously, \u201cThen you hadn\u2019t peed just now?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan pursed his lips, stared at her and asked, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\nBoth of them were boyfriend and girlfriend, and Su Miaomiao was not afraid that he, who was pure, would not accept her. But it was not something to be proud of, so she lowered her head and whispered, \u201cI learned from the brothel. One month of playing the qin, learning the qin during the day, and watching others at night\u2026\u201d\nWatch?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Otherwise how could you\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s hand she held seemed to shake slightly, but soon stabilized again. He said in a cold voice, \u201cI\u2019m doing it out of love, I follow nature, and I definitely won\u2019t deliberately please you. I didn\u2019t think about copying them just now, but if you do, it\u2019s deliberate.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was coaxed by that truth.\nThinking about the wretched demeanor of those brothel benefactors, and then looking at Xie Jingyuan, of course she couldn\u2019t confuse the Taoist master with those people.\n\u201cBut I still want to sleep with the Taoist master,\u201d Su Miaomiao leaned into his arms and acted like a baby.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s body stiffened for a moment, and then he compromised, \u201cYes, but one quilt per person.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao smiled, turned around and jumped back to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bed, and commanded him, \u201cThen you carry my quilt over, I\u2019ll sleep on your side.\u201d\nHer quilt was still a new one, but the Taoist master\u2019s\u00a0 quilt smelled like him.\nShe had changed into new pajamas, and the beautiful new dress was still scattered on the floor.\nThe moment Xie Jingyuan went to pick up the dress, some chaotic images appeared in his mind.\nHe was suddenly not sure whether the night would go smoothly as planned.\nA few minutes later, Xie Jingyuan was lying on the bed stiffly. Although Su Miaomiao was sleeping with the quilt on her, her upper body was tilted, with her head resting on his shoulder and her arms around his waist.\nFortunately, she was very tired and didn\u2019t make trouble anymore. Under the comfort of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s psychic power, she soon fell asleep.\nUntil then, Xie Jingyuan wanted to put her back on her pillow.\nWhen he slightly pushed her, she let out a dissatisfied murmur, and hugged him even tighter.\nXie Jingyuan had no choice but to close his eyes and silently recited the Mantra of Purifying Heart.\nThat night, the Taoist, who had been meditating every night since he was reincarnated in that world since the age of two, was lazy for the first time.\nAfter Wimbledon, Su Miaomiao could enjoy a short vacation.\nHowever, with many years of high school, college life and daily training, she had formed a fixed biological clock. Su Miaomiao woke up naturally at six o\u2019clock in the morning. Surrounded by Xie Jingyuan\u2019s aura, she subconsciously went to hug the person beside her, but didn\u2019t find anyone.\nThe villa was very quiet. After a while, she heard some noise from the kitchen on the first floor.\nSu Miaomiao was very satisfied, jumped out of bed happily, and went to the bathroom to wash up.\nAfter putting on a white dress and casually tying up her hair in a simple bun, she came to the first floor refreshed.\nXie Jingyuan had just finished frying two steaks. When he heard her coming, he didn\u2019t look back, and lowered his eyes to put the steaks on the plate.\nHer laughter behind him came, and in the next second, she was close to him, wrapping her hands around his waist.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sleep a little longer?\u201d Xie Jingyuan looked at her, and said, \u201cTake the steak to the table first, and I\u2019ll serve the porridge.\u201d\nIn addition to seafood porridge and fried steak, Xie Jingyuan also stewed fish soup and cut fruits.\nAfter the two sat side by side, Su Miaomiao took another look around the villa that Xie Jingyuan had just moved into, and asked curiously, \u201cWhen are you going to now?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cExcept for some special positions, the employees of the company go to work at 8:00 in the morning and get off work at 5:30 in the afternoon, and I am the same.\u201d\nThe purpose of going to university was to acquire the necessary modern knowledge for independent research and development of drugs as soon as possible. So when he was working, Xie Jingyuan wanted to maintain a stable pace of life. He was like that, and so were the employees of the company. In addition, the eight-hour working day was a part of \u201cLabor Work\u201d working hours of employees stipulated in the Act.\nHe needed to make money to guarantee his daily expenses, and he needed to make money to open a company that could give full play to his value, but making money was not the ultimate goal of his life in that world. The development of drugs couldn\u2019t be completed in a short time, so there was really no need to force the employees to overwork.\nSu Miaomiao was very envious, \u201cYour company\u2019s treatment is really good. Feng Xiaoyu and the others often complain in their company that they have to work overtime, and my cousin always works overtime.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to be a boss who was complained by employees every day.\n\u201cDo you want to work with me?\u201d Xie Jingyuan looked at her and asked.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cWhen you majored in administration, didn\u2019t you just want to be my secretary?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stared at him, \u201cAre you really planning to let me do things for you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything. You only need a title, otherwise if you always stay in my office, the employees would talk about me not doing my job properly.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cOkay, then you have to pay me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan took out a card and pushed it in front of her, \u201cThe salary card is ready, and the password is the one you often use.\u201d\nIt was a black card, which looked quite textured. Su Miaomiao flipped it, and then put it aside casually.\nAfter breakfast, it was only half past six.\nXie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao to visit the garden of the villa.\nGu Jialing helped design the garden. Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t have any requirements, so he designed it completely according to Su Miaomiao\u2019s preferences\u2014a professional-grade tennis court full of modern technology was the top priority, and the swimming pool was for the owners. Yes, there was also a small pond with lotus flowers blooming just in time, and some red carps were raised in it, which was convenient for Su Miaomiao to fish.\nThere were two swings in the shade next to the pond.\nSu Miaomiao sat on one of them, shook it, and asked doubtfully, \u201cYou don\u2019t play on swings, why did you get two?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan helped her push and said, \u201cMaybe someone wants to play when he comes over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "195": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-195/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, Gu Jialing\u2019s original words were that when they have a child, Su Miaomiao could play with the child.\nSince Su Miaomiao was already enthusiastic enough the previous night, Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to stimulate her to have more enthusiastic thoughts.\nSu Miaomiao stared at the swing next to her, imagining that a big man as tall as Gu Jialing would also sit on the swing. No matter how she looked at it, it was against the law, but if it was his original form, a small blue bird the size of a palm, it would be very cute .\nAfter the garden, Su Miaomiao visited Xie Jingyuan\u2019s personal research and development center.\nTwenty-two-year-old Xie Jingyuan, because of his persistent cultivation in the previous four years, the spiritual power he could accumulate in his body had increased to a higher level, and he could display more spiritual cultivation skills.\nIn his previous life, he was mainly responsible for catching demons. For things such as cultivating spiritual plants, he only remembered them because he had read extensively about them. But he had never used them much in his previous life. In modern society, with the meager spiritual power, he could not use some offensive spells, and the social environment of peace and prosperity of the country also made those spells useless. So Xie Jingyuan devoted all his thoughts to cultivating medicinal herbs.\nHis idea of \u200b\u200bmedicine was also a combination of ancient alchemy and modern pharmacy. In order to deceive people, he even successfully prepared a nutrient solution for cultivation to explain why he could stimulate those herbs to produce higher medicinal effects. To put it simply, relying on his mind, he transformed the previous spiritual power cultivation method into a cultivation method acceptable to the public that could be explained by modern science.\nOf course, that was his patent, and he would only supply it to the country in a limited amount, and then the country would select qualified drug research institutions to distribute the nutrient solution and conduct their own research.\nSu Miaomiao saw many medicine gardens in the research and development center, but she basically didn\u2019t know, and wasn\u2019t interested in learning about them.\nAfter all, she was just a cat, and saving the common people was ideal for the Taoist master.\n\u201cWhy is there a strawberry field?\u201d Su Miaomiao stopped in front of a small strawberry field in surprise, \u201cDo strawberries have any medicinal value?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her happy side face, and said in a low voice, \u201cTheir medicinal value is not high, it is mainly for you.\u201d\nAs he spoke, he ripened a strawberry plant.\nSu Miaomiao just watched the strawberry seedlings grow up and bloom, and finally produce six big red strawberries, exuding a sour and sweet fruity aroma.\nShe couldn\u2019t help picking one.\nIt was as sweet as every strawberry Xie Jingyuan gave her in the past.\nSu Miaomiao threw herself into his arms happily, but at the same time she was very regretful, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I meet you in my previous life?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan patted her head, \u201cDidn\u2019t we meet?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, \u201cBut at that time, you were always fierce. Don\u2019t talk about planting strawberries for me, you didn\u2019t even cook fish soup for me. There is only simple food in the temple. If I wanted to eat meat, I had to find it nearby by myself.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t argue that at that time he really wouldn\u2019t make an exception to provide her meals. Xu Shou who was willing to eat steamed buns with vegetables, Gu Jialing also went out to look for food by himself.\n\u201cThere are rules for the temple,\u201d Xie Jingyuan could only explain it that way.\nSu Miaomiao snorted, \u201cThen if we suddenly go back now, will you make an exception for me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her and nodded.\nIf they had been chasing nirvana all the time, he might not have gotten to this point with her at all. But if he went back, after experiencing the world, he would of course continue to treat her well.\nSatisfied, Su Miaomiao hooked his neck on tiptoe.\nXie Jingyuan supported her with both hands, placed her on the marble table outside the strawberry field, and kissed her.\nSu Miaomiao was a cat, a cat who wanted what she liked, and would never be reserved.\nShe felt happy like the previous night, and before Xie Jingyuan could put space between them, she pressed down hard on his head.\nAnd when Xie Jingyuan was pressed down by her, he saw that she had torn off half of the shoulder straps of the dress.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe lifted her up again.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him in protest, because thinking of such a thing, her eyes were foggy at that moment, and the tails of her eyes were full of charm.\nXie Jingyuan grabbed her hands and explained helplessly, \u201cNot during the day.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao pouted, why were there so many rules?\nXie Jingyuan looked at his watch and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go to the company, and wages will be deducted if I am late.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao let him go.\nThe two returned to the main building of the villa. Xie Jingyuan was wearing a shirt, and so he took off the suit jacket from the hanger.\nSu Miaomiao just looked at him standing there fastening the buttons one by one, which made her want to jump over and help him untie them. It would be best to pull off those buttons and throw them on the ground.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Xie Jingyuan came over and held her hand.\nSu Miaomiao half leaned on him, pinched a button and turned it around, and pressed his rolling Adam\u2019s apple.\nXie Jingyuan glanced around and said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t do this outside.\u201d\nThat kind of her was like a \u201cbad girl\u201d who flirted with men, which would damage her image of a fresh and cute tennis girl outside.\nAlthough Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t need Su Miaomiao to deliberately create a positive persona, he couldn\u2019t let the pictures that would affect her image leak out. If he didn\u2019t, Su Mingan, his wife and Grandma Tao would also be unhappy.\nSu Miaomiao glared at him and withdrew her hand.\nHe made two rules early in the morning. Su Miaomiao was very upset. She walked to the front of the car, and purposely sat in the back seat.\nJust as she was about to close the door, Xie Jingyuan grabbed the handlebar outside and looked down at her.\nSu Miaomiao moved inside, not letting him see.\nXie Jingyuan had no choice but to sit in too.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cIf you sit here, who would drive?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cI\u2019ll coax you well first.\u201d\nAfter speaking, he stretched out his left hand to let her play with his cuff button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His eyes fell on her face through the window.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s heart beat faster for no reason, and she was a little flustered. At the same time, she felt thirsty and wanted to drink water.\nBut she obediently sat in the co-pilot.\nXie Jingyuan closed the door for her, walked around to the driver\u2019s seat from the rear of the car, took out his phone with his back turned to her, seemed to reply to a few messages, and then sat in.\nSu Miaomiao peeked over and found that Xie Jingyuan had turned into that normal Taoist master with a cold expression and peaceful eyes.\n\u201cI am thirsty.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore Xie Jingyuan started the car, Su Miaomiao whispered.\nXie Jingyuan took out a bottle and opened the lid for her.\nSu Miaomiao took several sips and returned it to him who paused, then unscrewed the lid again.\nSu Miaomiao just watched him raise his chin, gulping more than her in one breath, his reddish Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down. So she withdrew her gaze in time and looked out of the window.\nThe Taoist master still had to go to work, she couldn\u2019t make trouble.\nIt only took ten minutes to drive from Xie Jingyuan\u2019s villa to his company.\nThat was to say, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s special ability and sufficient funds allowed him to own an independent pharmaceutical factory in the early stage of his business.\nThe seven-story white building directly opposite the entrance was the company\u2019s office building. Some arc designs gave the building a gentle and natural overall style. Several other buildings, such as pharmaceutical workshops, quality inspection centers, research and development centers, canteens, staff apartments, etc., also had their own characteristics. The greenery in the company was also very comfortable, and the leisure and fitness areas were also designed.\nXie Jingyuan drove the car and took Su Miaomiao around.\nHis company was her company. Su Miaomiao was very interested in visiting her own site. She lowered the window and watched with gusto.\nOccasionally, employees in uniform passed by. They first recognized the boss\u2019s car, and then looked at the beautiful woman sitting in the passenger seat. They immediately matched her up with the tennis champion who was often seen on the Internet, and even had a lively personality. When Su Miaomiao got out of the car to enjoy the scenery, the female employee ran over excitedly and asked for her autograph.\nAfter which, Xie Jingyuan parked the car and took Su Miaomiao into the office building.\nWhen the two front desk ladies saw Su Miaomiao, they were stunned.\nXie Jingyuan guessed that they all knew Su Miaomiao, but he still put his arm on her shoulders and introduced, \u201cMy girlfriend.\u201d\nThe ladies at the front desk smiled and said, \u201cWe know the lady boss!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan smiled, took his special elevator with Su Miaomiao, and went directly to the seventh floor.\nThe seventh floor was entirely Xie Jingyuan\u2019s office area, including the offices of several secretaries and assistants.\n\u201cIs there an office for me?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked, looking at the signs.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s office was not so exaggeratedly big. It was even simply a little shabby. Except that all kinds of furniture were made of high-quality materials, which reminded Su Miaomiao of his room in Qingxu Temple, there was really nothing extra.\nThere were, however, two lounges inside the office.\nClosely connected to the office was Xie Jingyuan\u2019s study room, which also had a long sofa. One could imagine him lying on it to rest after being tired from work.\nIn the innermost part of the office was the real lounge he specially prepared for her. Its luxury and comfort were comparable to a hotel\u2019s VIP suite.\nAs soon as Su Miaomiao came in, she was attracted by the super big bed inside, so she took off her shoes and jumped on it happily.\nXie Jingyuan looked at his watch and said, \u201cI have to work, you rest first. If you are bored, I can arrange someone to take you to visit other places, or wait until noon and I will accompany you.\u201d\nAs long as there was a bed, Su Miaomiao would not be bored at all, and she waved at him without raising her head.\nAfter Xie Jingyuan left, she first rolled around on the bed a few times, and took a closer look at that place which was decorated in her favorite style.\nAfter admiring the place, Su Miaomiao nestled into the front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, and made a video call to her parents first.\nTang Shiwei was relatively busy, so she hung up after making sure her daughter was happy.\nSu Mingan was the boss himself, and he happened to be free then. When the video was connected, he saw a super seductive and comfortable big bed in the background of his daughter, squinted his eyes and asked, \u201cAre you in Jing Yuan\u2019s villa?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, this is their company. He works outside, this is the lounge.\u201d\nSu Mingan inhaled, thinking that\u00a0 Xie Jingyuan had ulterior motives\nIt was just that he couldn\u2019t say that to his daughter, he could only wait to complain to his wife at night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you want to come back, I will pick you up by car.\u201d\nThe high-speed rail was open, so naturally it took more than forty minutes from Beijing to Anshi. However, his daughter was also considered a public figure, and taking the high-speed rail may cause some unnecessary commotion, so she would be more at ease to travel by car.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cNo, I\u2019ll just wait and come back with the Taoist master.\u201d\nSu Mingan thought that his daughter must have missed them, but she was too confused by that brat Xie Jingyuan.\nThe father and daughter chatted for more than half an hour, and Su Miaomiao suddenly yawned.\nThe sun came over and shone warmly on her, making her want to sleep.\nSu Mingan tentatively asked, \u201cWhat time did you go to bed last night?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while and said, \u201cAround ten o\u2019clock?\u201d\nSu Mingan quickly calculated that his daughter got off the plane at eight o\u2019clock, Beijing was so congested, therefore Xie Jingyuan reached the villa at nine o\u2019clock, and there was an hour left for his daughter to eat, wash and take a bath. That made him think that Xie Jingyuan probably wouldn\u2019t have a chance to do anything.\nAfter taking a nap, Su Miaomiao felt that Xie Jingyuan had come in, but she didn\u2019t react. At ten o\u2019clock, she was woken up by a video call from Zhao Lu, her roommate from the university.\nZhao Lu continued to study in graduate school. At that time, she was on summer vacation. She stayed in Beijing University and did some part-time jobs.\n\u201cWhat time is it, and you haven\u2019t woken up yet?!\u201d Seeing Su Miaomiao\u2019s lazy look in the camera, Zhao Lu exclaimed exaggeratedly.\nSu Miaomiao rubbed her eyes, leaned against the head of the bed, and explained, \u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m in the Taoist master\u2019s company.\u201d\nZhao Lu also expressed her shock at that luxurious lounge, and then showed an ambiguous smile. \u201cTaoist Xie seems restrained, but he\u2019s actually a gentle rogue,\u201d she said.\nSu Miaomiao thought, \u201cgentle rogue\u201d was definitely not a good word.\n\u201cYou slept in the lounge for two hours? Isn\u2019t Boss Xie afraid that the employees are going to think wildly?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m now the Taoist master\u2019s secretary.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You don\u2019t look like a secretary at all, but more like a college student lover that Boss Xie brought over to the company,\u201d Zhao Lu teased.\n\u201cAre you free now? I\u2019ll take you to buy clothes. I promise it\u2019ll fascinate Boss Xie,\u201d Zhao Lu offered.\u00a0\nSu Miaomiao was intrigued and immediately made an appointment with Zhao Lu. She ran to the bathroom to wash her face, tied her hair, grabbed her small bag, and headed out.\nXie Jingyuan wasn\u2019t in the office and had gone to the R&D center, so Su Miaomiao called him.\nKnowing that Su Miaomiao was going to see Zhao Lu and he couldn\u2019t leave, Xie Jingyuan arranged a driver for her.\n\u201cAre you coming back at noon?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m eating with Zhao Lu!\u201d Su Miaomiao replied.\nSu Miaomiao got into the car, made sure that Xie Jingyuan had nothing else to say, and hung up the call without hesitation.\nIn the R&D center, an alumni colleague standing next to Xie Jingyuan saw that Boss Xie, who could keep his face cold even when the laboratory was on fire, pursed his lips slightly, as if he was a little disappointed.\nZhao Lu accompanied Su Miaomiao to the shopping mall, where they bought three sets of secretary outfits with different styles for her. She also bought a skirt for herself. They settled for lunch in the mall, and in the middle of it, Xie Jingyuan even made a phone call.\n\u201cBoss Xie, are you afraid that I might not keep an eye on Miaomiao and let her be abducted by other handsome guys?\u201d When the phone call was about to end, Zhao Lu came to Su Miaomiao\u2019s side and joked on the phone.\nXie Jingyuan said calmly, \u201cNo.\u201d\nAfter Su Miaomiao hung up the call, Zhao Lu blinked at her and said, \u201cIt must be true. You always go to his place when you are free, so he couldn\u2019t feel relieved when you came out today. I really can\u2019t tell whether who is more clingy to whom between the two of you. Thankfully, the boss is clinging to you even more.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cThe Taoist master won\u2019t cling to me.\u201d\nIn the morning, she wanted to have a little more intimacy with the Taoist master, but he listed all kinds of rules for her, such as what couldn\u2019t be done during the day or outside.\nOf course, Su Miaomiao did not tell Zhao Lu those details.\nZhao Lu analyzed for her based on some clues she had gotten, \u201cBoss Xie is boring, maybe he enjoys it more in his heart. Besides, if you take the initiative to stick to him, of course he wouldn\u2019t need to stick to you again. So today, wash up and wear the new clothes and stay in the lakeside community in the afternoon. When he comes to pick you up in the evening, you put on new clothes, keep a distance from him, don\u2019t hug or kiss him, and see how long he can hold back.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded with a smile.\nIn the past four years, Zhao Lu had given her many good ideas. In Su Miaomiao\u2019s eyes, she was the smartest girl she knew among human beings.\nAfter eating, Su Miaomiao and Zhao Lu got into the car Xie Jingyuan arranged and asked the driver to drive to the lakeside community.\nOn the way, Su Miaomiao called Xie Jingyuan again and told him her new arrangements for the afternoon.\nXie Jingyuan was silent for a few seconds, and then said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll come there in the evening and move all your things to the villa.\u201d\nWhen Zhao Lu heard it, and after the call ended, she teased Su Miaomiao in a low voice, \u201cYou just graduated and are going to live together?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao replied, \u201cWell, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing live there, so of course I have to move there.\u201d\nZhao Lu was surprised, \u201cYou four still live together?\u201d\nShe had heard of strong friendships before, but at most, everyone rented a house together before buying a house. But Xie Jingyuan bought a villa and left a room for Xu Shou and Gu Jialing.\nSu Miaomiao just thought it was normal, although she had become the wife of the master, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing were still Qingxu Temple\u2019 demons.\nMoreover, the Taoist master arranged their rooms on the second floor, and only hers was on the fourth floor, which obviously showed that he favored her the most.\nSeeing that Su Miaomiao was very satisfied with the arrangement, Zhao Lu thought she was not at all afraid of their couple\u2019s two-person world being disturbed by two good friends, so she did not say anything else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m downstairs, I\u2019ll come up right away.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at the time; it was only five-twenty.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get off work at 5:30?\u201d\n\u201cI am the boss, and I can freely arrange my working hours.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao remembered that when he was the master of Qingxu Temple, he also had some privileges. For example, Xie Jingyuan could bring the three demons back, and other Taoist masters couldn\u2019t even think about it.\n\u201cI bought vegetables, so let\u2019s have dinner there,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said.\nWith that said, Su Miaomiao was immediately reminded of the times when Xie Jingyuan would not cook for her.\nSu Miaomiao hung up the call quickly, and combed her hair into a professional-looking style in front of the mirror. She had never liked to apply make up on her face, and she had never learned any makeup skills.\nRacing against time, before Xie Jingyuan came, she sat on the sofa in the living room with her notebook in her arms, and opened the video of a tennis final that she had prepared in advance.\nWhen she heard footsteps outside the door, she clicked on the video.\nXie Jingyuan held the fresh ingredients he had just bought in one hand, and pushed open the door with the other. When he looked up, he saw the familiar living room layout there, but saw a very strange silhouette sitting on the sofa.\nXie Jingyuan paused, and at the moment when he suspected that he had gone to the wrong room or that Su Miaomiao had invited a guest, he saw the woman\u2019s face clearly.\nIt was Su Miaomiao.\nAfter confirming the identity of his girlfriend, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but move down along her focused profile.\nThe top two buttons of the white shirt were unbuttoned.\nUnder the short tight skirt, two slender white legs were stacked together, one foot was raised, and she was wearing a high-heeled shoe studded with diamonds.\nSu Miaomiao glanced at Xie Jingyuan, then continued to concentrate on watching the game.\nZhao Lu said that as long as she didn\u2019t take the initiative, the Taoist master would definitely take the initiative to stick to her.\nShe even fantasized that when the Taoist master clung to her, she would also be fierce and set up rules for him, so that he could taste what it was like.\u00a0 Looking at her appearance, one could tell that Zhao Lu must have given her another \u201cgood idea\u201d.\nAfter changing the shoes, Xie Jingyuan held up the ingredients in his hand and asked for her opinion, \u201cIs it good enough to cook a braised fish, stew a chicken soup, and stir-fry two more dishes?\u201d\nHe first put the ingredients into the kitchen, then walked out, took off his suit jacket and hung it on the hanger, unbuttoned his shirt cuff buttons, and rolled them up above his elbows.\nAfter preparing, he took one last look at Su Miaomiao, went into the kitchen, and closed the glass partition door.\nSu Miaomiao had enough, took off the high heels that she seldom wore before, and lay lazily on the sofa to take a nap.\nXie Jingyuan was busy inside, and when he turned around, he looked toward the living room, and saw his girlfriend on the sofa turned into a familiar look again, with her feet curled up, and two beautiful high-heeled shoes on the floor as if the owner didn\u2019t cherish them.\nHe stir-fried the vegetables first, then the fish. After that, he stewed the chicken soup in the pot, gradually exuding the aroma and attracting the cat.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s stomach growled, and she couldn\u2019t help leaving the sofa and stood up.\nWhen she lowered her head and straightened her skirt, Xie Jingyuan opened the glass door and came out with two plates of fried vegetables, just in time to see her clumsy and cute moments.\n\u201cWhy are you dressed like this?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked, pretending not to know that she had never liked clothes that were too restrictive.\nSu Miaomiao raised her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m your secretary now, so I should dress like this.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan gave her a complicated look, and without saying anything, turned around to serve the braised fish.\nWhile the chicken soup continued to simmer slowly, Xie Jingyuan brought out the rice and sat down opposite Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao asked strangely, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit next to me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the white shirt she wore, and said, \u201cI\u2019m not used to being so close to my secretary.\u201d\nDidn\u2019t her friend say that if she wore such clothes, he would take the initiative to stick to her? Why was he getting farther away?\nFortunately, the food was delicious, so Su Miaomiao ate it first.\nXie Jingyuan cleaned the bowl, and the chicken soup had to be simmered for another half an hour.\nHe said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cI\u2019ll help you pack your luggage.\u201d\nSooner or later, she had to move, so he brought a few empty suitcases and boxes there in advance. Because there were a lot of Su Miaomiao\u2019s personal belongings, he put them in the boxes first, decided to take away the valuable ones that night, and let the assistant take care of the rest.\nSu Miaomiao watched him start to pack the things he wanted to take away from the living room one by one. He also packed the things in the gym and went into the cloakroom next door.\nMost of her clothes were what she wore before graduation. Xie Jingyuan was very familiar with them, so the two new sets of clothes immediately caught his eye\nThe suit was okay, but when he took out the slender cheongsam and compared it to Su Miaomiao, who was leaning against the door, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cCan you really wear this?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao glared at him, \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything, why can\u2019t I wear it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "199": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-199/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXie Jingyuan deliberately didn\u2019t imagine her wearing that cheongsam, folded the clothes and packed them into suitcases separately.\nThere were not only coats in the cloakroom, but also many underwear.\nXie Jingyuan left the underwear at the end, and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cI\u2019m going to clean up the master bedroom, you pack these yourself.\u201d\nFrom the beginning to the end, he didn\u2019t seem to have seen the suit that Su Miaomiao was wearing.\nWhen he went to the master bedroom, Su Miaomiao was packing her underwear while muttering in her heart whether Zhao Lu\u2019s method would work that time.\nAfter packing her underwear, she went to the master bedroom and saw Xie Jingyuan being busy making the bed and packing.\nSu Miaomiao suddenly felt a little bit reluctant, after all, that was a place where she had lived for four years.\nXie Jingyuan looked at his watch and reminded her, \u201cThe chicken soup is ready, I\u2019ll help you get it first.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s reluctance disappeared immediately, and she happily followed him to the dining room to drink chicken soup.\nAfter finishing the chicken soup, Xie Jingyuan efficiently packed up the last few items in the master bedroom. He then asked Su Miaomiao to check inside again to ensure nothing was missed.\nAs she looked through the room, Su Miaomiao spotted a white dress hanging in the wardrobe, which made her ask Xie Jingyuan suspiciously, \u201cWhy did you confiscate this?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan finally looked at the short dress, and said in a low voice, \u201cYou will wear it later.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan closed the door with his backhand, and the curtains on the south side were drawn even earlier.\nThe slender index finger pressed the switch, and the room suddenly fell into darkness.\nTurning off the lights was also a kind of signal between the two of them. Su Miaomiao stood in front of the closet, watching that familiar blurry figure walking toward her.\nShe wanted to go to bed, but there was only one mattress left on her bed, which might be dusty.\nHe reached out and closed the wardrobe door for her, and after that, he turned her to face the solid wood wardrobe.\nSu Miaomiao thought that Xie Jingyuan would kiss her right away, but she heard him squat down and then hold her left ankle.\n\u201cLift it.\u201d\nThen, there was an extra high-heeled shoe under her foot, a high-heeled shoe with a height of ten centimeters, which she obviously removed in the living room.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the sparkling beauty of those high heels, Su Miaomiao wouldn\u2019t have bought them.\nHowever, just standing there, Su Miaomiao could still wear it without twisting her feet.\nAfter putting on both high heels, Xie Jingyuan stood up.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s height was 168, and the high heels made up a large gap. So if Xie Jingyuan kissed her side neck from behind, it would be much more convenient.\nSu Miaomiao leaned against the closet softly, tilting her head cooperatively.\nXie Jingyuan heard her laugh, very lightly.\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d He put one arm around her waist and stretched out the other to help her unbutton all the shirts slowly.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t hide her thoughts, and said contentedly, \u201cZhao Lu is indeed right, so the Taoist master did take the initiative to stick to me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was a little helpless, \u201cDo you think this is a good thing?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao rubbed his face and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing. I absolutely like it.\u201d\nShe wished that the Taoist master would also become a cat. At that time, they wouldn\u2019t have to go to work. When the sun was good, they would bask in the sun, and when it rained, they would crawl into a tree nest and play together.\nXie Jingyuan knew that even if she had a bad idea, her motives were extremely pure.\n\u201cI\u2019m so attached to you, but I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to bear it,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said with unclear meaning.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t understand very well, but he didn\u2019t explain anything anymore, and tore away her obstructive shirt.\nXie Jingyuan had been standing behind Su Miaomiao.\nIn Su Miaomiao\u2019s chaotic mind, his slender and white right hand swayed.\nThe Taoist master once used that hand to hold a sword, used that hand to turn over a book, used that hand to force her head to separate from the desk and forbade her to sleep during class, and also used that hand to wipe her sweat when she played tennis, patiently.\nIt turned out that the Taoist master\u2019s hand had other uses.\n\u201cIs it uncomfortable?\u201d Xie Jingyuan suddenly asked in her ear.\nSu Miaomiao shook her head, no matter what the Taoist master did, she liked it.\nXie Jingyuan left suddenly.\nJust when Su Miaomiao felt lost, he suddenly held her tightly.\u00a0\nHer body froze, and in an instant, a cloud of mushrooms printed in textbooks popped up in her mind.\nComparing the scenes she had seen in the brothel, she finally understood that she shouldn\u2019t fantasize about the Taoist master as an ordinary man.\nAfter her soul returned to her body, she wished that the high heels under her feet could be higher.\nXie Jingyuan restrained her and did not allow her to escape.\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d Su Miaomiao protested aggrievedly.\nXie Jingyuan backed away, fastened his belt with one hand and said in a deep voice, \u201cIf I cling to you, this will happen. Do you still want to try?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao shook her head repeatedly.\n\u201cThen change your clothes, and I\u2019ll go to the bathroom.\u201d\nBut before leaving, Xie Jingyuan helped her take off the pair of high heels that might make her fall down.\nWhen he went out, he turned on the light in the master bedroom, and before Su Miaomiao could look over, he quickly closed the door from the outside.\nSu Miaomiao was still leaning against the closet weakly. Looking down, she pulled back the wrinkled skirt in fear, pulled it and took it off, and quickly took out the dress that looked safer from the closet.\nFrom the bathroom, there came the sound of the shower.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s body and courage were still a little weak, so she lay down on the sofa to relax.\nAfter waiting for about twenty minutes, Xie Jingyuan came out.\nShe sat upright nervously, with both hands firmly pressing down on the hem of her skirt, when she looked at Xie Jingyuan, it wasn\u2019t his face that she looked at first.\nNoticing her gaze, Xie Jingyuan froze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Xie Jingyuan was still more used to her like that.\nThere was no need to try, of course he would stick to Su Miaomiao, in the two lifetimes, she was the only one whom he loved all the time.\nIt was great to be together. When she was not in front of him, Xie Jingyuan would be worried that she would not be able to eat or sleep well, or that she would be wronged.\nSu Miaomiao liked to hug him, and he also liked to have her in his arms.\nIt was just that some things needed the right time for it. If Su Miaomiao was allowed to use different tricks to lure him, Xie Jingyuan was afraid that he would go crazy.\nCarrying the two suitcases that he was going to take away, he followed her out of 802.\nThey had just locked the door when a couple who looked like college students walked out from the elevator hall.\nThe two sides met face to face, and the couple was shocked by the looks of Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan for a few seconds, until they realized that it would be impolite to stare at them all the time. So they quickly looked away and passed by the side, finally stopping in front of the 801.\nSu Miaomiao watched as the boy took out the key and opened the door that she often entered and exited.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Xie Jingyuan whispered to her, dragging the suitcase with both hands.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a rented house. We had canceled the lease, so new tenants naturally moved in.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood that she was missing those two guys a little bit.\nThe competitions in the first three quarters of each year were very intensive. She hadn\u2019t seen the Taoist master, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing for so long.\nAfter three years in high school and four years in college, Su Miaomiao had become used to having the Taoist master and those two around her.\nXie Jingyuan hugged her and said, \u201cNext week, I\u2019ll ask the two of them to come together.\u201d\nCoincidentally, when Xie Jingyuan was driving, Su Miaomiao received Gu Jialing\u2019s video call.\nWhen the call was connected, she first saw Gu Jialing\u2019s gorgeous short blue hair.\nShe could admit that the little bird with blue feathers was indeed pretty and cute, but Gu Jialing\u2019s figure with blue hair was weird.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I look more handsome with blue hair?\u201d Gu Jialing brushed his hair and smiled brightly.\nHe then continued to say, \u201cI was not allowed to dye my hair when we were in university, now am I not allowed to dye your hair even after graduation?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s heart moved and she said, \u201cThen I will also dye my hair white.\u201d\nSome words were not suitable for Gu Jialing to hear, so Xie Jingyuan did not interfere for the time being.\nSu Miaomiao continued to chat with Gu Jialing, \u201cAre you at the hotel?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cYeah, I came here to check a batch of saplings I ordered before, but I\u2019m going back to Beijing tomorrow.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to Anshi tomorrow, and we\u2019ll be back on Sunday night.\u201d\nGu Jialing started to complain. He talked a lot of nonsense, but Su Miaomiao listened to him, and didn\u2019t miss any of his words.\nAfter the video call ended, Xie Jingyuan asked, \u201cDo you really want to dye your hair white?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao stroked her hair and asked for his opinion, \u201cDo you think white hair looks good?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan paused, and then said, \u201cIf it can be as white and beautiful as your original form it may look good, but the roots of your hair will still be black after dyeing, which might be annoying, and you need to use hair dye regularly. You may not be able to stand the smell of that chemical preparation.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao frowned when she heard that and said, \u201cForget it, black hair looks good too, I used to have black hair in my human form.\u201d\nBack at the villa, Su Miaomiaon had nothing to do so she went to bed.\nXie Jingyuan still had some company affairs to deal with, and even if he was not busy, he was not used to wasting time like that. He was either reading or practicing, in short, he would not use it for sleeping.\nSu Miaomiao lay on his bed and continued to occupy it.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201cCan I sit at the desk?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought about it and agreed.\nAs she heard him typing on the keyboard, Su Miaomiao quickly fell asleep.\nXie Jingyuan was busy until eleven o\u2019clock, and simply took a shower. He looked at Su Miaomiao who was sleeping soundly, and sat on the floor next to the bed to meditate.\nIn the past, he would practice until it was time to wake up. That time, Xie Jingyuan finished an hour earlier, and then got into Su Miaomiao\u2019s quilt next to her\nAs he expected, not long after that, Su Miaomiao\u2019s upper body was tilted, her head was resting on his shoulder, and her arms were around his waist.\nThat was a dependent and simple posture.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t have any distracting thoughts, he just felt at ease.\nFrom the day he brought her back to Qingxu Temple, he was no longer alone.\nShe liked to smell his body, and liked to get under his bed, but she didn\u2019t know that even if she ran away timidly, the warm and sunny smell on her body would accompany him through many nights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "201": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-201/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday morning, the two set off at seven o\u2019clock, drove for three hours, and arrived at Pearl Garden at ten thirty.\nTang Shiwei had rest, and was waiting for her daughter at home with Su Mingan. Grandma Tao knew that the two children were coming back, so she was also in their house.\nIn the underground garage, Su Miaomiao got out of the car first, and then saw Xie Jingyuan open the trunk, and came out with four gift bags one after another.\nSu Miaomiao walked over curiously, and found that the four bags of gifts were two bottles of Moutai, a box of famous tea, a set of skin care products for rich ladies, and two boxes of bright red strawberries.\n\u201cWhen did you buy these?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her and explained, \u201cThis is the first time for me to accompany you home as your boyfriend. Of course I have to prepare gifts for my uncle and aunt.\u201d\nPerhaps since middle school, Su Mingan and his wife misunderstood that he and Su Miaomiao were in a puppy relationship, and the misunderstanding continued until college.\nEven if he was a college student, he was just a child in the couple\u2019s eyes. But it got different, he had entered the society, so it was impolite to come to their door empty-handed.\nSu Miaomiao had the heart of a demon and never cared about those things, but Xie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t ignore them.\nShe remembered that every time her father went to her grandparents\u2019 house, he would prepare a lot of gifts.\n\u201cYou know everything,\u201d Su Miaomiao smiled and took his arm.\nXie Jingyuan reminded her, \u201cThese two boxes of strawberries are specially prepared for uncle and aunt. If you want to eat, you can eat as much as you want when you go back to the villa.\u201d\nFruits ripened by spiritual power could improve the body to a certain extent. After Xie Jingyuan discovered it, he started preparing some fruits every once in a while to honor the elders. If they were taken for a long time, they should be able to help the elders prolong their lives. Of course, the effect would not be too obvious, after all, it was not a panacea.\nThree minutes later, Su Miaomiao rang the doorbell instead of entering her fingerprint.\nThe three elders sitting on the sofa all stood up. Su Mingan quickly opened the door, Tang Shiwei and Grandma Tao followed behind and watched.\n\u201cDad!\u201d Su Miaomiao gave her father a hug, and then rushed over to hug her mother and grandma.\nSu Mingan looked at the things in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s hand in surprise.\nTang Shiwei was also surprised and said, \u201cAre these for us?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked normal, and explained, \u201cIn the past, uncle and aunt took care of me. Now that I am working, I should respect you. I just don\u2019t know if you will like them or not.\u201d\nTang Shiwei immediately said, \u201cI like them, show them to me!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan put the four gifts on the coffee table.\nSkin care products were the brand he noticed Tang Shiwei often used when he helped Su Miaomiao clean the house before. The tea was what the husband and wife both liked to drink. He specially prepared it for Su Mingan who liked to drink it himself or take it to entertain business partners. The strawberries\u2026\n\u201cThis is a strawberry variety cultivated with nutrient solution. Uncle, aunt, you should eat it while it is fresh. I also prepared others for my grandma,\u201d Xie Jingyuan stood beside them and said.\nSu Mingan and his wife had already eaten some of the fruits that Xie Jingyuan paid special attention to, and they had personally experienced the effects. It could be said that the value of those two boxes of strawberries was higher than that of the other three gifts, and it must be worthwhile to sell them outside.\nSu Mingan was critical, but he couldn\u2019t say anything bad about those four gifts.\nXie Jingyuan even picked up two servings of strawberries and took the initiative to wash them in the kitchen.\u00a0\nTang Shiwei took the opportunity to say to Grandma Tao, \u201cLooking at Jing Yuan\u2019s cold face every day, he seemed like he didn\u2019t understand the world. I really didn\u2019t expect him to know everything. He is so familiar with us and still knows how to bring gifts when he comes with Miaomiao.\u201d\nGrandma Tao also smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s because he treats you two as elders.\u201d\nShe specially said to Su Mingan, \u201cJing Yuan respects you much more than his own father.\u201d\nSu Mingan knew Xie Jingyuan really treated him better than his own father.\nAfter being happy for a while, remembering that Xie Jingyuan\u2019s attitude was due to the brat thinking about his daughter early on, Su Mingan immediately put away his smile.\nIt was almost time to prepare lunch. Xie Jingyuan wanted to help in the kitchen, but Tang Shiwei insisted on pulling him out and let Su Mingan do the work by himself. Anyway, there were only five people, so he needed just to make a few home-cooked dishes, which was not much more than what he usually cooked.\nWhile talking about Xie Jingyuan\u2019s company, and Su Miaomiao\u2019s competition, time passed without anyone realizing it.\nWhen Su Mingan started serving food outside, Xie Jingyuan happened to be talking about Su Miaomiao moving in with him, \u201cFrom now on, Miaomiao will live with me\u2026\u201d\nNoticing Su Mingan\u2019s sudden gaze, Xie Jingyuan added seriously, \u201cThere is a separate room in the villa for Miaomiao.\u201d\nGrandma Tao added, \u201cYes, Xu Shou and Jia Ling also have rooms there. These four children will be inseparable from now on.\u201d\nSu Mian had no choice but to suppress the dissatisfaction in his heart when his wife warned him with her eyes.\nAfter eating, Xie Jingyuan and Grandma Tao went back to 1002 first.\nSu Mingan said to his daughter earnestly, \u201cMiaomiao, you\u2019re always out of home competing, don\u2019t you miss your parents? From now on, you can come home to stay here after the competition. No matter how good Jingyuan\u2019s villa is, it is also his home. How can you live comfortably in his house?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the Taoist master\u2019s house is more comfortable. My room is twice as big as the one at home.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy a villa right away and give you a bigger room!\u201d\n\u201cStill I want to be with the Taoist master.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nTang Shiwei watched the excitement patiently, and when her husband had eaten enough losses, she smiled and said, \u201cYou can stay there, mom supports you, but you have to come home often, I miss you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao leaned into her mother\u2019s arms.\nIn 1002 on the other side, Grandma Tao asked her grandson curiously, \u201cYou both have graduated, have you thought about when to get married?\u201d\nFor young people in the new era, cohabitation before marriage was too common, and Grandma Tao was not that old. However, they were living together anyway, so why not get married first, so that Su Mingan and his wife could feel more at ease? The most important thing was that the two children were a natural pair of childhood sweethearts, and the relationship foundation was very solid. The marriage was a matter of course, unlike her son\u2019s impulsive marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After the National Day Open, I plan to go to my uncle and aunt to propose marriage.\u201d\nPropose marriage?\nGrandma Tao was amused by her grandson\u2019s words, but she understood that it was necessary . When it was time to discuss marriage, the man would go to the woman\u2019s home to formally meet the parents. Although the grandson and Su Mingan were already very familiar with each other, such a major event as marriage had to be discussed with the elders.\n\u201cHave you proposed to Miaomiao?\u201d Grandma Tao asked, making Xie Jingyuan pause.\nGrandma Tao asked him, \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked yet?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded.\nWith the relationship between him and Su Miaomiao, there was no need to go through the process of \u201cmarriage proposal\u201d, which had no practical meaning.\nGrandma Tao scolded him, \u201cMarriage is a once in a lifetime event. You can\u2019t cancel such an important ceremony just because she likes you. Prepare what should be prepared, hurry up and do it. If you don\u2019t understand, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\n\u201cNo need, I\u2019ll do it myself, I know what to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou really know? Did you buy the engagement ring?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe planned to take Su Miaomiao to choose a wedding ring. However, there was still time to prepare the engagement ring.\nAfter dinner, Xie Jingyuan accompanied Grandma Tao to the square.\nGrandma Tao was very popular in the square. Whether it was her square dance partners or other old men and women, seeing her bring her grandson over, they all gathered around to join in the fun.\n\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t seen Xiao Xie for a long time, he has grown so tall!\u201d\n\u201cI heard that Xiao Xie started his own company right? You got so great just after graduation!\u201d\n\u201cOf course, there is also that little girl from the Su family, the one who won the tennis championship!\u201d\nEveryone praised Jing Yuan and Su Miaomiao, just like they praised Grandma Tao directly, who smiled radiantly.\nXie Jingyuan had been studying far away for those years, and had just come back. At that moment, he was patiently standing beside Grandma Tao. He would answer patiently when the uncles and aunts asked questions. Although the language was concise, Grandma Tao even needed to translate it for him.\nWhen Grandma Tao was about to start dancing, he sat on the bench beside her and watched, thinking about how to propose.\nAt that moment, he suddenly got a call. Xie Jingyuan answered, raised the phone to his ear, and waited for the other side to speak first.\nXie Rong said, \u201cWhere are you? It sounds so lively.\u201d\nXie Rong guessed what was going on with his son, \u201cDid you go back home with Miaomiao? You and Miaomiao are so close, have you thought about when to get married?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan suddenly remembered what Su Miaomiao said before, saying that the elders liked to urge marriages.\n\u201cThere is a plan, and you will be notified when the wedding date is confirmed.\u201d\nXie Rong understood his son\u2019s implication, that was to say, besides being able to attend his son\u2019s wedding, he didn\u2019t need him to worry about other things.\n\u201cFine, it\u2019s good that you have a plan, but if you really want to hold a wedding, you still need to invite more relatives and friends from the two families to show that you attach great importance to Miaomiao.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, you spend more time with your grandma, bye.\u201d\nThe call between the father and son ended so simply.\nXie Jingyuan thought that Xie Rong was better than his father in his previous life, but unfortunately he was not a real child and it was difficult to cultivate feelings with a father like Xie Rong who was so busy that he only saw him once or twice a month. So what kind of father-son relationship was there?\nAt eight o\u2019clock, Xie Jingyuan accompanied Grandma Tao back to the community after dancing.\nGrandma Tao wanted to take a bath, so Xie Jingyuan sat down at the desk, picked up a pen, and drew something on the paper.\nSome skills were ones he learned in modern society, but painting was something he knew in his previous life.\nSu Miaomiao sat on her bed and asked him in a low voice, \u201cTaoist Master, I want to go and sleep with you.\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t seen the Taoist master for a whole afternoon, and she wanted to be with her parents when she was awake, but since she was going to sleep, she wanted to sleep in his room.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t dare to let her do what she liked at that time. If Su Mingan found out, he might be so angry that he would refuse his marriage proposal.\nSu Miaomiao asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Uncle and aunt will get sad, thinking that you don\u2019t miss them at all.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t bear to make such good parents sad, so she agreed.\n\u201cJing Yuan, are you busy?\u201d Grandma Tao passed by the study and asked suspiciously when she saw her grandson sitting at the desk as if he were studying.\nXie Jingyuan stopped writing, stood up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nAfter Grandma Tao finally fell asleep after chatting, Xie Jingyuan continued to draw.\nAt around midnight, a newly-finished drawing of a ring appeared. There were some complicated patterns drawn on the inside and outside of the ring.\nThe next morning, Tang Shiwei was going to the hospital to work overtime, and Su Mingan suggested taking his daughter to the mall.\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask grandma to go with us.\u201d\nSu Mingan knew that his daughter wanted Xie Jingyuan to come.\nMaybe his daughter was getting older and the generation gap with her family was getting stronger, so she liked Xie Jingyuan more.\nSu Mingan wanted his daughter to be happy, so he went to invite Grandma Tao and her grandson.\nAfter staying in the mall for a long time, and then having a meal with Tang Shiwei at noon, Xie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao on the return bus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "203": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-203/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Mingan was very reluctant, so Grandma Tao, who had been in that situation before, explained to him, \u201cChildren become like this when they grow up, and they will only take care of their small family from then on.\u201d\nThere was another thing that Grandma Tao didn\u2019t say, after all, she was a man\u2019s grandmother.\nThat was\u2013\nIf Su Mingan really wanted to live with his daughter, he could only wait for the young couple to have a baby and then help take care of the child.\nIn Beijing city, Xie Jingyuan drove the car into the villa, and saw Xu Shou and Gu Jialing waiting in front of the main building.\nNo matter how busy Xu Shou was, he still had time to rest on Sunday, while Gu Jialing\u2019s time was completely up to him. The construction site of his resort was mainly taken care of by Mr. Gu.\nSu Miaomiao got out of the car, walked to Gu Jialing\u2019s side first, and pulled his arm to make him bow his head.\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t understand why she did that.\nShe sniffed his blue hair, and immediately pushed him away in disgust, \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t smell good.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe wanted Xu Shou to smell it for him, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I finished dyeing it, how could the smell still remain?\u201d\nHowever, Xu Shou took a few steps away without waiting for him to approach.\nGu Jialing was very angry, on the surface he pretended not to care, but in fact, he secretly touched his hair and smelled his hands after a while, trying to make sure if there was any peculiar smell.\nHowever, when he found that Su Miaomiao was really not interested in scratching his hair anymore, it became an ironclad proof.\n\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll dye it back tomorrow, so that the old man won\u2019t scold me,\u201d Gu Jialing compromised helplessly.\nXu Shou advised him, \u201cYour old man is in his seventies, right? You should respect the old man more and make him less angry.\u201d\nGu Jialing snorted and said, \u201cHe\u2019s tough, and he still has the strength to chase after me, and he\u2019s going to turn seventy in the twelfth lunar month. I\u2019m going to hold a birthday party for him before the end of the year.\u201d\nXu Shou said unexpectedly, \u201cMy grandparents are two years younger.\u201d\nThe two looked at Xie Jingyuan together, and then remembered at the same time that Grandma Tao had already celebrated her 70th birthday in their junior year, and they even gave her a birthday gift.\nGu Jialing said, \u201cWhen the old man celebrates his birthday, you all have to be there.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded.\nSu Miaomiao asked him, \u201cWhen will your resort be built?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s early, even if I hire a lot of workers, it will be around this time next year at the earliest. By the way, when will you two get married?\u201d\n\u201cThe Taoist master said that the certificate can be obtained after the National Day.\u201d\n\u201cSo early? You can get the certificate in July next year, and you can go to my place for the wedding in October.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan who said lightly, \u201cWe can get the certificate this year, and hold the wedding next year.\u201d\nGu Jialing said jokingly, \u201cYou\u2019re in such a hurry because you\u2019re afraid that Su Miaomiao would be snatched away?\u201d\nHe had said long ago that Su Miaomiao had Su Daji\u2019s level of beauty, and no matter how rich the Taoist master was, it would be difficult for him to bear it. If he didn\u2019t settle down sooner, Su Miaomiao might be snatched away by a prince of some country.\nhearing his words, Xu Shou kicked him from under the table.\nGu Jialing couldn\u2019t beat him, so he had to shut up.\nWhen it was time to rest after eating, Gu Jialing complained softly again, \u201cWhy could Su Miaomiao live on the fourth floor, while our rooms are all on the second floor?\u201d\nXu Shou said coldly, \u201cShe will marry the Taoist master.\u201d\nOn the fourth floor, Su Miaomiao went directly to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room, and was just about to speak, when he pressed her lips with his finger and said in a low voice, \u201cBefore we get the certificate, don\u2019t let them know that you are sleeping with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cXu Shou won\u2019t agree with etiquette, and Gu Jialing would laugh at you and me if he finds out.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought of Gu Jialing.\nBut that weekend, the two of them had no chance to stick together alone. After taking a bath, Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help but throw herself on Xie Jingyuan, wanting to kiss him.\nXie Jingyuan wanted to remind her not to be loud, when suddenly Gu Jialing\u2019s loud singing came from downstairs.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe brought Su Miaomiao into the soundproof cloakroom.\nThat year\u2019s US Open officially started on August 28.\nThere was still training to do before the game, so Su Miaomiao set off with the team in mid-August and stayed in a luxury hotel in New York.\nSince the year when she won the US Open runner-up for the first time, that hotel had extended an olive branch to Su Miaomiao. As long as Su Miaomiao went to New York to play games, she could stay in the top suite of the hotel for free. Of course, her stay was also an advertisement for the hotel, which was a kind of win-win business cooperation.\nOn the 27th, Su Miaomiao finished her training during the day and returned to the hotel with Sister Fang in the evening.\nAfter taking a bath, Su Miaomiao received a message from Sister Fang, saying that she was waiting for her in the restaurant.\nSu Miaomiao changed her clothes and walked to the door.\nLike every time, she simply opened the door, but that time, when she looked up, she saw a person who shouldn\u2019t be there.\nSu Miaomiao stared blankly at Xie Jingyuan who was standing in front of her.\nHe was wearing a pair of black casual trousers and a white short sleeve, looking clean and refreshed.\nAfter the astonishment passed, Su Miaomiao rushed over with a smile, jumped up high, hugged his neck with her hands, and wrapped her legs around his waist.\nXie Jingyuan carried her into the guest room while the door was still closed, and then pressed her against the door panel to kiss.\nAfter the long kiss ended, Su Miaomiao held his face, and said in surprise, \u201cDid you come to watch me compete?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her and said, \u201cTonight is Qixi Festival (Chinese Valentine\u2019s Day) in China, and lovers spend it together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "204": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-204/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao understood, and happily kissed him again.\nShe liked the Qixi Festival. If every day was the Qixi Festival, then Taoist master would be with her every day.\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d After kissing repeatedly, Xie Jingyuan asked with concern.\nSu Miaomiao nodded. She did a lot of exercise during the day, so she tended to get hungry when it was time for meals.\nXie Jingyuan held her hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to eat. I heard of a western restaurant by the river that is highly rated.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao listened to him.\nAfter sending a message to Sister Fang, Su Miaomiao wore the same low-key and fresh white dress and walked out the door holding Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arm.\nAs Xie Jingyuan said, the taste of that western restaurant\u2019s food was really good.\nAfter eating enough, the two of them walked along the river, arm in arm.\nThe evening wind was blowing, and a half moon hung in the sky.\nThere were so many changes in the past and present, but the moon was still exactly the same.\nSu Miaomiao was tired after walking, so Xie Jingyuan sat on an empty bench, and she sat sideways in his arms, leaning against him comfortably.\nBefore she fell asleep, Xie Jingyuan took out a small white box from his pocket.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up, and she grabbed the small gift box, then asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cThe marriage proposal ring.\u201d\nAs he expected, the word \u201cmarriage proposal\u201d had no meaning in Su Miaomiao\u2019s heart, she cared more about what the \u201cproposal ring\u201d looked like.\nXie Jingyuan observed her expression silently.\nSu Miaomiao had already taken out the ring.\nIt was a ring made of gold, with no gemstones or diamonds on it. In the night, such a gold ring didn\u2019t shine at all.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s expression gradually became serious. She held the ring closer to her eyes, trying to distinguish the cumbersome patterns engraved on the surface and inside of the ring, and murmured, \u201cTaoist Master, are there scriptures on it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, a protective spell.\u201d\nAt that time, Su Miaomiao happened to see a drawing in the middle of the ring, which was a golden long sword with a gourd hanging on the scabbard.\nThe day when the demons besieged Qingxu Temple, Xie Jingyuan once used a ring on his hand, and the golden halo from the ring directly killed a demon.\nAnd his ring seemed to be the same as the one in her hand.\nSu Miaomiao thrust the ring to Xie Jingyuan abruptly.\nXie Jingyuan hugged her, who was still about to jump out of his arms, and explained in a low voice, \u201cWhen the patriarch founded Qingxu Temple, he cast a ring, and the ring was engraved with sutras to protect the body from evil. It was also a symbol of the identity of the previous Qingxu Temple\u2019s masters.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s face was pale, and she said unhappily, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you wear it.\u201d\nBut she was still a demon in her heart, belonging to the \u201cevil\u201d that the ring could ward off. If Xie Jingyuan gave her such a thing, wouldn\u2019t that be to make things difficult for her on purpose?\nXie Jingyuan continued to explain, \u201cThe temple\u2019s ring runes can protect the body and ward off evil spirits. For yours, I only carved amulets.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at him in surprise.\nXie Jingyuan said with gentle eyes, \u201cI sealed the spiritual power inside. If you are in danger, this ring will activate scriptures spontaneously to protect you. The sealed spiritual power can only be activated three times. When you use it up, I will add new spiritual power which can be sealed in time.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao finally understood that it was a powerful ring, a magic weapon he especially prepared for her.\nNot to mention a little demon like her, even for a thousand-year-old demon, because she didn\u2019t know how to refine weapons like a monk, it was hard to get a magic weapon.\n\u201cThank you, Taoist Master!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao reversed her previous dislike and couldn\u2019t wait to put the ring on her finger.\nXie Jingyuan reminded her, \u201cThis is a proposal ring. After you wear it, you promise to marry me and become my wife.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao just felt that he was a little silly. She was going to marry him, so why should he ask her?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an engagement ring, it\u2019s my weapon!\u201d Su Miaomiao raised her hand. Even after earning so much money in the world, it was only then, she truly experienced the happiness of being \u201crich\u201d.\nShe, Su Miaomiao, was also a demon with a magic weapon.\nWhen Su Miaomiao played the US Open again, she had a gold ring on her left ring finger.\nWhen the final was over, when she once raised the championship trophy in front of the camera, the gold ring clearly entered the media\u2019s field of vision.\nDomestic reporters interviewed her excitedly, \u201cDoes this ring have any special meaning?\u201d\nIn fact, the reporter wanted to ask if Xie Jingyuan gave her the marriage proposal ring, but diamond rings were popular, and gold rings were ordinary, not suitable for Xie Jingyuan\u2019s worth. If it was not the proposal ring, wouldn\u2019t Su Miaomiao be embarrassed?\nThe reporters liked Su Miaomiao very much. Of course, when asking questions, they should also consider her and try to avoid embarrassing her.\nFacing the question, Su Miaomiao raised her left hand happily, and showed the ring off, \u201cThis is my\u2026 treasure, it\u2019s my amulet!\u201d\u00a0\nShe smiled so happily, as if that ring was really the best treasure in the world. The reporters were also very touched and took pictures of this scene one after another.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t wear the amulet in games before, why did you think of wearing it this time? Did you encounter any special opportunity?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had not yet returned to China, but the interview video had gone viral on domestic social media.\nGiven that Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan had established a relationship long ago, it was not too surprising that Xie Jingyuan proposed marriage at the Qixi Festival. The focus of discussion among netizens was on that ordinary-looking gold ring that was not so ordinary.\n\u201cI asked my Taoist grandfather to study it. The runes on the ring should be a Taoist amulet, but it is different from what is recorded in Taoist literature, and it is more complicated.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Taoist masters are divided into sects, and many sects can marry, have children, drink alcohol and eat meat.\u201d\n\u201cCould it be that Mr. Jing really believes in Taoism, that\u2019s why Miaomiao keeps calling him Taoist Master?\u201d\nThe so-called divine pictures of the Beijing University Halloween party that the group of four joined in their first year of freshman year spread. At that time, many alumni also took pictures of the group of four, and the most widely circulated one was a picture of Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan together.\nIn the picture, Xie Jingyuan in Taoist robe with a long sword on his back was holding Su Miaomiao\u2019s hand who was wearing a white dress and a cat mask. The two seem to be talking about something. Xie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao tenderly whose corners of the lower lips were raised happily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "205": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-205/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time Gu Jialing saw Su Miaomiao\u2019s gold ring, he went crazy in the chat group.\nBefore Xie Jingyuan appeared, Xu Shou was annoyed by Gu Jialing\u2019s messages: Shut up.\nIt was obviously just words, but the words Gu Jialing sent seemed to have their own sound effects.\nGu Jialing sent him a screenshot of Su Miaomiao\u2019s ring: Does this ring look familiar to you?\nOf course Xu Shou was familiar with it. It was the Taoist master\u2019s ring that never left his finger in his previous life. There was once a wealthy gentry who wanted to spend a lot of money to buy the ring, but the Taoist master refused.\nGu Jialing: The Taoist master gave the ring to her, so doesn\u2019t that mean that he wants her to be the temple master?\nAlthough Qingxu Temple did not exist in that world, in the hearts of the group of four, it always had a special and extraordinary meaning.\nXu Shou: That\u2019s the Taoist master\u2019s ring, and he has the right to give it to anyone.\nXie Jingyuan finally said: It isn\u2019t the temple master\u2019s ring, it is the master\u2019s wife\u2019s ring, and the runes are somewhat different.\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t understand those complicated Taoist runes. After all, Xu Shou had read the scriptures with Xie Jingyuan for two or three years. Protecting the body from evil was also a basic spell. After studying the picture carefully for a while, the difference was revealed.\nOf course Gu Jialing couldn\u2019t snatch Su Miaomiao\u2019s ring, but he was still not happy: Taoist Master, you\u2019re so partial, why didn\u2019t you give us amulets?\nXie Jingyuan silently sent a picture.\nThere were two boxes of silver rings, one box had only two, and the other box had hundreds of them. Those silver rings did not have the \u201csword\u201d of Qingxu Temple, but they were all engraved with scriptures.\n\u201cYour ones are amulets, which can protect you in case of danger.\u201d\n\u201cThe other rings will be given to the guests as souvenirs at the wedding next year, engraved with disaster avoidance talismans.\u201d\nThe so-called disaster avoidance was to use the sixth sense to change some people\u2019s decisions before a disaster that may endanger their life. There was no external interference, but it could subtly resolve the danger. For example, if a person were to be hit by a speeding car, with the disaster avoidance amulet, the person would hesitate to cross the road.\u00a0\nXie Jingyuan wanted to give some special care to his relatives and friends, but he could not reveal that his cultivation was not in line with that world, so that was all he could do.\nThe disaster-avoiding talisman of each ring could only be activated three times, except for the close relatives who he would regularly inject new spiritual power to, he decided not to interfere with others too much.\nLife and death were fate, and too much interference may not be a good thing.\nXu Shou: The Taoist master is really thoughtful.\nGu Jialing: Forget about other rings, why are our rings silver? They don\u2019t even have a sword engraved on them.\nXu Shou: You want a gold ring and you also want the emblem of Qingxu Temple? Do you want to be the master of the temple?\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u2013\nIn mid-September, Su Miaomiao returned to China and went straight to Beijing.\nIt was the weekend, and it was a rare free time for Tang Shiwei. So she called Su Mingan, and the couple went to Beijing by high-speed train.\nXie Jingyuan drove, and brought Su Miaomiao to the high-speed railway station to pick them up.\nAs soon as she got in the car, Tang Shiwei couldn\u2019t wait to hold her daughter\u2019s hand and observe the ring closely.\nSu Mingan was sitting in the co-pilot seat, looking at Xie Jingyuan with unconcealed distaste, \u201cThis is the engagement ring you prepared for Miaomiao?\u201d\nWasn\u2019t it worth tens of billions? Such an important ring didn\u2019t even have a single diamond?\nAs the prospective father-in-law, Su Mingan was very dissatisfied.\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cThis ring has a special meaning, but the wedding ring will be more in line with the public\u2019s aesthetics.\u201d\nThat was very euphemistic. What it really meant was that the price of the wedding ring would be higher, and it would show how much he attached importance to Su Miaomiao from a secular perspective.\nTang Shiwei already knew that Xie Jingyuan had given her daughter a bunch of jewels, and giving such an engagement ring had nothing to do with money at all.\n\u201cJing Yuan, is this amulet really effective?\u201d Tang Shiwei was more concerned about that.\nSu Miaomiao answered for him, \u201cOf course, the Taoist master does not lie.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to speak too bluntly, and said, \u201cBelieve in the spirit.\u201d\nWith that said, Xie Jingyuan took out the ring gift box that he had prepared earlier, and handed it to Tang Shiwei, \u201cThis is for uncle and aunt, and other relatives and friends. I will give it to them when I have a chance in the future.\u201d\nTang Shiwei happily took the gift box, opened it, and found a pair of silver rings inside, the smaller one was just right for her.\n\u201cSo lovely,\u201d Tang Shiwei touched the circle of runes and said with a smile.\nSu Mingan interjected, \u201cThe diamond ring I gave you looks good, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou just know how to compete.\u201d\n\u201cHis goodness is all feudal superstition!\u201d\n\u201cIf you talk nonsense again, go back home!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan just raised the corners of his lips slightly, and didn\u2019t care about his father-in-law\u2019s criticism.\nWhen they arrived at the villa, Xie Jingyuan entertained the couple with tea and water.\nSu Mingan made an excuse that he didn\u2019t like drinking tea, so he went to the fourth floor alone to see how his daughter\u2019s room was decorated.\nXie Jingyuan stayed in the hall to entertain Tang Shiwei with his usual expression, and Su Miaomiao was also sitting there.\nWhen Su Mingan arrived on the fourth floor, he went to his daughter\u2019s room first, and found that the room was clean but full of life, and there was a family photo on the bedside table.\nAfter which, Su Mingan thought for a while, then went downstairs and said, \u201cJing Yuan, I\u2019ll use your washroom.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want.\u201d\nWith his permission, Su Mingan went in with peace of mind.\nHe first looked at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bed. The bed was made neatly, with a pillow in the middle.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After such a long delay, she knew that he had done something bad.\nXie Jingyuan originally wanted to formally propose marriage to the two elders after the National Day. But that ring revealed the fact that he had already proposed to Su Miaomiao, and since the couple had come, he thought that it was not good to postpone it any longer.\nWhen Su Mingan also sat on the sofa next to Tang Shiwei, Xie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao, and said to the couple, \u201cUncle, Aunt, I want to marry Miaomiao with your blessings. \u201c\nJust hearing that, Tang Shiwei couldn\u2019t stop smiling, she had already regarded Xie Jingyuan as her son-in-law.\nHolding her daughter in her arms, Tang Shiwei patted her daughter\u2019s hand while looking at Xie Jingyuan and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any requirements, as long as you always treat Miaomiao well.\u201d\n\u201cAunt, don\u2019t worry, I will always be this way with Miaomiao.\u201d\nTang Shiwei looked at her husband on the other side.\nSu Mingan kept a straight face, the more happily his wife agreed, the less he wanted to make Xie Jingyuan happy.\nTang Shiwei pushed him.\nSu Miaomiao looked over curiously, \u201cDad, why don\u2019t you speak?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to take you away from Dad, I don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d\n\u201cThe Taoist master isn\u2019t going to take me away, I am the one who is willing to marry him.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUncle, don\u2019t worry, even if Miaomiao and I get married, I will often come to visit you on weekends or holidays.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t agreed yet!\u201d\n\u201cUncle, if you have any request, as long as you tell me, I will do it.\u201d\nSu Mingan knew that he was making trouble for no reason, and his daughter would definitely marry Xie Jingyuan. They couldn\u2019t find anyone who was more suitable and loving for their daughter than hin.\nIt was just that his wife liked Xie Jingyuan so much. If he was not serious, what would they do if Xie Jingyuan was too proud?\n\u201cHave you had a premarital checkup?\u201d Su Mingan drank his saliva and put on a calm look, \u201cI don\u2019t doubt you, it\u2019s just that the premarital check up is a normal marriage procedure, which is related to whether your marriage could develop healthily and long-term. I did it before we got married.\u201d\n\u201cI did it, wait a moment, I\u2019ll get the report.\u201d\nSu Mingan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nTang Shiwei was surprised at first, and then looked at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s tall and straight back, and her smile deepened. This kid was so anxious to marry her daughter, and he had prepared everything comprehensively.\nA few minutes later, Xie Jingyuan returned with his premarital examination report.\nTang Shiwei read it with her husband. She was a doctor and could confirm that their son-in-law was very healthy and had no problems.\n\u201cWe definitely agree, but when are you two going to get the certificate?\u201d After reading the report, Tang Shiwei asked with a smile.\nSu Miaomiao had already moved to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, hugged his arm and said, \u201cWe will sign it after the open match.\u201d\nSu Mingan took a sip of tea, and said, \u201cIn such a rush? How can young people nowadays get married right after graduating from university? Your cousin who has been in love for six or seven years hasn\u2019t received a certificate yet!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was silent.\nHis motive for rushing to obtain the certificate was indeed not very simple.\nHowever, he was serious about marrying Su Miaomiao, and about wanting to grow old with her forever.\n\u201cUncle, when do you think it\u2019s appropriate to get the certificate?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked politely. Su Mingan and his wife were her parents, so naturally he would respect the elders\u2019 opinions.\nSu Mingan pursed his lips and glanced at his wife.\nTang Shiwei smiled and said, \u201cFollow your plan, it\u2019s the two of you getting married, as long as you are happy.\u201d\nAnalyzing their specific situation in detail, other people didn\u2019t see their son-in-law growing up in front of their own eyes, so of course they opposed getting the certificate hastily.\nAs for Xie Jingyuan, he had been in love with Miaomiao for twenty two years. It was not too early to get the certificate then\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Su Miaomiao grabbed her phone to check; it was already ten o\u2019clock in the morning.\nIn the Open Finals the day before, she met a very powerful opponent. Although she won, it was not an easy win. After the match, she was injured in many places all over her body.\nEven if she slept deeply the night before, Su Miaomiao knew that the Taoist master had been sitting by the side and meditating, and when he had accumulated enough spiritual power, he would use it to heal her wounds, repeating it countless times.\nSu Miaomiao tried to roll around in bed a few times, and sure enough the discomfort disappeared.\nIt was Xie Jingyuan who called, \u201cAre you awake? Grandpa and the others just entered the station, and are going back home now.\u201d\nWith the departure of Grandma Tao and relatives from the Su family, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s villa returned to tranquility. In the lobby on the first floor, only the nanny was waiting to serve Su Miaomiao breakfast.\nAfter Su Miaomiao finished her meal, she leaned on the sofa and made a video call with Gu Jialing.\nXu Shou was a busy person, only Gu Jialing seemed to be there all the time in the chat group.\nGu Jialing was at the resort, and it was also raining over there. The workers stopped the outdoor work and started to do some indoor work.\n\u201cI just sang a song for them, and their morale is quite high now,\u201d Gu Jialing got into his RV and showed off leisurely.\nSu Miaomiao noticed that the shoulders of his blue shirt were wet from the rain.\nGu Jialing looked down and didn\u2019t care, \u201cWhat is a little rain? I was often drenched when I was flying in the woods. You think all demons are as sensitive as you? By the way, when will you and the Taoist master go to get the certificate? Don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you that although you are beautiful, the Taoist master is quite popular among human girls. You better hurry up. There is no second man in this world who is willing to serve you like that besides the Taoist master.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, if we don\u2019t get the certificate, he will be snatched away by another woman?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. You forgot in Qingxu, there were often female pilgrims who asked the Taoist master for help, but actually just wanted to see him. Ignoring them now doesn\u2019t mean ignoring them in the future. Let me tell you, human men aren\u2019t good, even if they are Taoists, they can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\nAt that time, through the floor-to-ceiling windows, Su Miaomiao saw a black car driving in, it should be the Taoist master.\nIn the video, Gu Jialing was still telling her about divorce due to a cheating party that he had seen in human society.\nXie Jingyuan walked into the hall and saw Su Miaomiao lying lazily on the sofa, a familiar voice came from the phone, because the hall was empty but the words were clear.\nSu Miaomiao squinted at Xie Jingyuan, who took off his suit jacket, and asked Gu Jialing, \u201cYou mean, the Taoist master might cheat?\u201d\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t trust him too much.\u201d\n\u201cThen what does it have to do with whether or not to get a certificate? If he really wants to cheat, he will do so after he gets a certificate.\u201d\n\u201cYou are stupid. After you two get legally married, if he cheats, you can get half of his property if you file for divorce. By the way, he didn\u2019t ask you to sign a prenuptial agreement, did he?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Xie Jingyuan sat next to Su Miaomiao, looked at Gu Jialing, and answered expressionlessly.\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe video ended immediately.\nXie Jingyuan took Su Miaomiao\u2019s cell phone and hugged her, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to his nonsense.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at his handsome face and asked, \u201cWill you find another woman?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked her eyes and snorted, \u201cThere is no basis for what you say, I want to sign a prenuptial agreement with you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan only thought it was funny, \u201cWhat kind of agreement do you want to make?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, and said, \u201cJust write that if you hang out with other women, you will be reborn as a mouse in your next life, so that I will catch and eat you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan patted her head and said, \u201cDo you really want me to sign it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao firmly said, \u201cYes.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan carried her to the study and asked her to write the agreement, and he drafted it himself.\n\u201cDo you want witnesses?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the patriarch is our witness.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan wrote two copies by hand and handed them over to Su Miaomiao for inspection.\nSu Miaomiao discovered that Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t write the word cheating, but wrote\u2014\u2014\n[Xie Jingyuan, the sixteenth master of Qingxu Temple, makes an oath to the patriarch that he will be devoted to Su Miaomiao for life. If he violates this oath, he will be reincarnated as a rat after entering reincarnation, willing to be a meal for Su Miaomiao.]\nSu Miaomiao was very satisfied. After the two signed, she took a screenshot and sent it to the chat group.\nGu Jialing: Too ruthless, too ruthless, now I believe that the Taoist master would never cheat.\nXu Shou: What nonsense are you talking about? How could the Taoist master cheat? Even if he didn\u2019t make an oath, he wouldn\u2019t cheat!\nGu Jialing: Why are you barking at me? I\u2019m not the only one who doubts the Taoist master. If Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t doubt him, did the Taoist master need to make an oath?\nXu Shou: You must have provoked her.\nGu Jialing: Stop wronging this poor human!\nXu Shou: You are not human.\nGu Jialing: You bast-rd!\nXie Jingyuan: Shut up.\nWith that, the chat group went quiet.\nXie Jingyuan put away his phone and looked at Su Miaomiao who was sitting in his arms, \u201cYou really don\u2019t believe in me?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao sniffed, hugged his neck and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether I believe in you or not. I just want to be with you. If one day you smell like someone else, then I won\u2019t be with you.\u201d\nShe was just a cat and didn\u2019t want to think about such complicated things. She didn\u2019t think, but Xie Jingyuan thought a lot.\n\u201cIf there was another man who smelled better than me, would you cling to him?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, if she imagined it, she liked the Taoist master the most.\n\u201cI\u2019ll still choose you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan kissed her hand, \u201cThank you, if you choose someone else, I would have been very sad.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao asked curiously, \u201cHow sad?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said in words she could understand, \u201cIt\u2019s as sad as losing your demon pill.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao immediately hugged him tightly, and promised,\u201dDon\u2019t be afraid, I will always be with you, never cling to others.\u201d\nIn Xie Jingyuan\u2019s mind, for some reason, a white cat appeared.\nThe speed at which she ran out from under his bed, and out of his sight, was as fast as a ray of light.\nObtaining a certificate was the same as the ancient marriage certificate, in fact, it was just a formality.\nBut even if it was the form, if one day she really encountered other temptations and wanted to run away, she would always give him a chance to win her back.\nXie Jingyuan looked at his watch. It was an hour before the Civil Affairs Bureau got off work at noon.\n\u201cShould we go get the certificate now?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked, kissing her ear.\nSu Miaomiao said with a pout, \u201cIt\u2019s raining outside.\u201d\nShe hated rain the most.\n\u201cI will bring an umbrella so that you won\u2019t get caught in the rain.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked out the window, then said stubbornly, \u201cIt\u2019s windy today, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get wet.\u201d\n\u201cYou forgot, I could already cast some small spells now.\u201d\nThere was a pot of tea on the desk. Xie Jingyuan lifted the teapot in front of the two of them, tilted the pot, a wisp of tea flowed out immediately, but turned a corner just before touching the clothes of the two, and finally flowed back into the pot .\nSu Miaomiao was very happy, hugged his neck and kissed him resoundingly.\nXie Jingyuan suddenly discovered that Su Miaomiao\u2019s liking for him would deepen with the improvement of his cultivation.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nBoth of them were already wearing white. As for the required documents, Xie Jingyuan had sorted them out the night before and put them in the drawer of the study. Of course, it was all thanks to Tang Shiwei, who brought Su Miaomiao\u2019s account book in advance.\nHalf an hour later, Xie Jingyuan held an umbrella in one hand, carried Su Miaomiao on his shoulder with the other, and strode toward the Civil Affairs Bureau.\nBecause it was raining, there was no one around the Civil Affairs Bureau, and the few passers-by who saw the two of them in that posture would just envy their youth.\nNot everyone could watch tennis games or pay too much attention to social media. Xie Jingyuan and Su Miaomiao made the relevant employees a little excited just because of their looks.\nAfter taking a good photo and reading the oath, the staff of the Civil Affairs Bureau skillfully stamped the little red stamp, and the two brand new marriage certificates were released smoothly.\nSu Miaomiao was not emotionally excited, she only regarded getting the certificate as a form, a form of telling the patriarch that she and the Taoist master could consummate their marriage.\nXie Jingyuan solemnly put the two marriage certificates into a waterproof bag and handed it to Su Miaomiao to keep.\nWalking to the exit of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the rain was heavier than before.\nXie Jingyuan was still the same as when he came, holding the umbrella in one hand, carrying Su Miaomiao on his shoulders with the other, and strode back to the front of the car.\nGoing around to the driver\u2019s seat, Xie Jingyuan first observed Su Miaomiao to make sure that she was not exposed to the rain, and then asked her for the bag.\nSuch important things had always been kept by him.\nSu Miaomiao handed it to him obediently.\nXie Jingyuan confirmed that the two marriage certificates were inside, then put them away, and drove back to the villa.\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t you have to go to work today on Monday?\u201d Su Miaomiao finally thought of that and asked.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the road and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to go today.\u201d\nOf course she was happy that he could stay in the villa with her.\nAfter reaching the villa, he carried her into the hall.\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Putting down the umbrella, Xie Jingyuan asked his wife.\nSu Miaomiao just had breakfast an hour ago, how could she be hungry?\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll take you back to your room to rest.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nAlthough Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t like rain, she liked to find a comfortable place to sleep on a rainy day.\nXie Jingyuan carried her to the fourth floor, walked into her room, and closed the door.\nThe curtains were still drawn, and Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t turn on the lights.\nSu Miaomiao was put on the bed by him, and the next moment, Xie Jingyuan followed suit, and all the restraint he had before was gone.\nThe piece of clothing was thrown on the ground, and there was no secular barrier between the two.\nLike intertwined vines on a tree, like two demons chasing the purest instinct deep in a cave.\nThe rain outside the window was getting heavier. As the wind slapped on the glass window, it seemed that it knew some secrets inside and clamor to unfold them.\nSuddenly, there was thunder in the sky.\nSu Miaomiao was not afraid of thunder, but such a sudden thunder still made her jump.\nThen thinking of what the two of them were doing, Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help feeling guilty, she said while shivering under the blanket, \u201cTaoist Master, is the patriarch angry?\u201d\nPerhaps, the patriarch still cared about her status as a demon.\nXie Jingyuan lifted her up, and his fiery lips touched her ear and the side of her neck,\u201dThunderstorms are natural phenomena, so there is no need to over-interpret them.\u201d\nIf the patriarch really wanted to interfere, he still wouldn\u2019t resist Su Miaomiao.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "209": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-209/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera shook as Gu Jialing moved to another location, clearly not interested in hearing Xu Shou\u2019s nagging.\nHe showed Su Miaomiao the gate, and said, \u201cOur home is very easy to recognize, it\u2019s the most magnificent villa in the town.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had already known that the Gu family had a mine, so of course they built a big villa for themselves, but that big villa had obviously been remodeled by Gu Jialing, and trees could be seen everywhere.\nSu Miaomiao approached the camera in disbelief, \u201cIt\u2019s so cold, why are your trees still green?\u201d\nBoth Anshi and Jingshi were located in the north. Except for pines and cypresses, at most they would both only have bare trunks in winter, but Gu Jialing didn\u2019t like pines and cypresses.\nGu Jialing showed her a big smile, and said, \u201cThese leaves are fake. My craftsmanship is so good that not to mention on camera, even standing in our house, you still can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s real or fake.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter hanging up the video call, Su Miaomiao recalled the Gu family\u2019s villa for a moment, and asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, isn\u2019t his resort full of trees?\u201d\n\u201cIf it was built according to the drawings, three quarters of the area would be botanical gardens.\u201d\n\u201cI see that other resorts have all kinds of entertainment facilities. Will there be tourists in his place?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say, but he didn\u2019t do it for profit.\u201d\nIn Gu Jialing\u2019s words, that resort would be his future home.\nA bird always returned to the jungle.\nAlthough Gu Jialing\u2019s resort was a bit of a prodigal, Mr. Gu was willing to spoil his grandson, and Gu Jialing himself liked it, so Xie Jingyuan also supported it.\nBoth Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing had found a way of life they liked, and only Xu Shou made Xie Jingyuan feel uneasy.\u00a0\nBecause Xie Jingyuan really didn\u2019t know, whether Xu Shou went to the Xie Group to help him take care of Xie Rong\u2019s family property, and did work only because of responsibility, or he also enjoyed that job.\nAt 10:05, the car finally arrived in the town.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing were waiting at the door of the villa.\nSu Miaomiao fell asleep halfway, and the first thing she felt after getting out of the car was cold, so she shrank into the jacket involuntarily.\nGu Jialing, whose nose was red, looked at Xu Shou resentfully, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all his fault, he insisted on coming out to wait for you. The old man drove me out to wait for you too, and I was in the wind for two hours in vain.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Xu Shou who maybe because of his better physique didn\u2019t look as miserable as Gu Jialing.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go in.\u201d\nRejecting Xu Shou\u2019s proposal to help, Xie Jingyuan carried two hands full of gifts, and gave the red envelopes to Su Miaomiao.\nBecause Old man Gu had already eaten the fruit Xie Jingyuan gave him the past few years, the seventy-year-old old man looked very tough, with a height of 1.8 meters, and a straight back. His hair was also much darker, thick and it was more lush than some young people who were busy in the metropolis.\n\u201cYou look quite similar to your grandfather,\u201d Su Miaomiao said to Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing replied, \u201cWhat? I\u2019m much more handsome than him!\u201d\nOld man Gu had good ears and heard it. He snorted, \u201cHe just talks nonsense. Later, show Miaomiao a photo of me when I was young and let her compare.\u201d\nMr. Gu, who owned a mine, was very good at receiving people and things, and he really liked his grandson\u2019s three good friends. He completely treated the three of them as his own grandchildrens.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for you to come all this way. You can stay at home tonight. I\u2019ve prepared the rooms for you,\u201d Mr. Gu smiled authentically while handing a thick photo album to Su Miaomiao.\nXie Jingyuan politely said, \u201cWe have caused you trouble.\u201d\nMr. Gu replied, \u201cNo trouble at all. You have helped me take care of Jingyuan these few years, and you have saved me a lot of worry. Otherwise, my hair would have turned gray a long time ago!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao focused on flipping through the album and found that Mr. Gu was not completely exaggerating. His appearance was no worse than Xie Jingyuan\u2019s when he was young, but his clothes looked more rustic.\nHowever, the grandpa and grandson were quite alike, and they even talked a lot. From the moment they met, Mr. Gu seemed to have never stopped talking.\nSu Miaomiao quietly asked Gu Jialing, \u201cWas your grandfather also a bird in his previous life?\u201d\nGu Jialing glanced at the old man, and snorted, \u201cIt should be, just like your mother, who was either a cat or a tiger in her previous life.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao took that as a compliment; cats were wonderful, and tigers and cats were also relatives! As she thought back to when the tiger sister had rescued her, she realized that it was likely because they looked alike.\nGu Jialing thought of something, and quickly reminded Su Miaomiao, \u201cBut you can\u2019t say that in front of him. Once I called him that, he almost got high blood pressure out of anger.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao laughed.\nMr. Gu looked at the beautiful and well-behaved girl, and enviously said, \u201cJing Yuan is amazing. He got married just after graduation to a good girl like Miao Miao. Our Jia Ling, on the other hand, I don\u2019t know if he is serious enough, let alone if he\u2019ll bring a girlfriend back.\u201d\nGu Jialing protested, \u201cWhy am I not serious enough?\u201d\nMr. Gu exclaimed, \u201cYou literally grabbed a bunch of plastic leaves and stuck them to the trees. So how can that be serious enough? When people see it, they ask me if you\u2019re crazy!\u201d\nXu Shou held Gu Jialing down in time when he saw him about to jump in anger, and explained to the old man, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, he\u2019s not sick, he just likes trees.\u201d\nThere was no need to be unhappy on a birthday.\nMr. Gu kept complaining, \u201cThere is no way to like trees that much. He said he wanted to open a resort and brought so many trees here. I think he wants to open a botanical garden!\u201d\nXu Shou replied, \u201cWhether it\u2019s a botanical garden or not, having many trees means there\u2019s enough oxygen. Nowadays, many scenic spots have the slogan of being \u2018a forest oxygen bar\u2019. When the time comes, I will pick you up to retire and prolong your life.\u201d\nThese words were so pleasing to the ear that Mr. Gu\u2019s fiery temper finally calmed down.\nNo matter what the quarrel was about, Mr. Gu still preferred his grandson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They already have obtained the certificate, so you have no chance.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want the chance!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was a cat, and he was a bird, so why chase her?\u00a0\nMr. Gu\u2019s birthday banquet was very lively, and maybe half of the people in the town came to have the banquet.\nGu Jialing also passionately performed a piece of Peking Opera, which aroused bursts of applause.\nMr. Gu smiled happily. His grandson was his most valuable treasure.\nIt wasn\u2019t until night fell that the villa became quiet.\nOld man Gu drank and became sleepy, so Gu Jialing helped him to the room on the second floor.\nGu Jialing\u2019s room was located on the third floor, while the two guest rooms were situated on the fourth floor.\nIt was just after six o\u2019clock, and even Su Miaomiao felt that it was too early to go to bed.\nThe group of four gathered in the theater room, and since none of the three had a particular movie preference, Gu Jialing made the decision and picked the first part of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s \u201cSuppressing the Demon\u201d series, which had premiered several years ago.\nAs he sat next to Xu Shou, Gu Jialingn commented, \u201cThe Taoist master\u2019s novel is wonderful, but among the seven movies, I still like the first one the most.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought of something and looked resentfully at Xie Jingyuan .\nShe still remembered how the Taoist master once made a character based on Gu Jialing, and she had also requested a character for herself, but the Taoist master refused to write anything.\nIf he really wrote about a cat that did not have Su Miaomiao\u2019s original form, she would definitely be angry. If they could really make it exactly like her with the special effects, it would definitely turn to such a beautiful cat. But what would happen between the demon and the male lead was something Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t want to see.\nSu Miaomiao was always next to Xie Jingyuan, when that fierce and terrifying big black snake appeared, she hid in his arms again.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou were sitting in front, so when they heard the movement, they both turned their heads at the same time. Seeing the scene, they turned back at the same time.\nSome scenes, when seen too many times, were not worth making a fuss about.\nAt the end of the movie, Xie Jingyuan sent Su Miaomiao back to the room first, and then he went to Xu Shou\u2019s room opposite.\n\u201cWhy are you being polite? Sit down and talk.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan first asked him how his grandparents were doing, and then asked him about his recent work.\nWhen Xu Shou was reporting, Xie Jingyuan saw a light in his eyes.\n\u201cDo you like your current job?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked.\nXu Shou nodded, \u201cI like it. The bigger the company, the easier it\u2019s for some dark sides to be discovered. I will help the Taoist master to prevent this from happening.\u201d\nThe Xie Group had hundreds of thousands of employees. Xu Shou had been trained by Xie Rong to be the next CEO. So he needed to be responsible for those hundreds of thousands of employees, including providing them with a healthy and orderly working environment.\nSu Miaomiao liked to play tennis and sleep. Gu Jialing liked the woods, and Xu Shou\u2019s hobby was to keep an area peaceful and orderly.\nTherefore, even though Xu Shou\u2019s intention for joining the Xie Group was to take care of the Xie family\u2019s property, in the process, he also enjoyed it.\nXie Jingyuan stood up and patted Xu Shou on the shoulder.\nXu Shou showed him a loyal and honest smile.\nBut Xie Jingyuan had seen his working side in the group. At that time, Xu Shou was more like a dog, and he didn\u2019t allow employees to fool around.\nAfter talking with him, Xie Jingyuan went back to his and Su Miaomiao\u2019s room. He thought she should have fallen asleep, but saw her lying in front of the glass window, observing something.\nXie Jingyuan walked to her side. Through the glass window, he saw the branches swaying in the wind in the yard, and a white cat.\nThe villa held a banquet during the day, and there may be some food scent left, which attracted the cat.\n\u201cThere is another one over there,\u201d Su Miaomiao pointed to a corner and said.\nXie Jingyuan smiled, hugged her and said, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re hungry.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like cats other than herself, but seeing the two cats looking for food, she thought of herself.\nAfter she was driven away from home by her mother and before she started to learn to cultivate spiritually, Su Miaomiao was often hungry. Sometimes she managed to find something to eat, only for it to be snatched away by other demons that were stronger than her.\nNo matter how warm her fur was, she needed shelter from the wind in winter. Those two cats must be extremely hungry to go out to look for food at that time.\n\u201cDo you want to feed them?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked after observing her expression.\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to nod, Gu Jialing appeared in the yard and threw a big chicken drumstick to the two cats respectively, and said, \u201cI am already entertaining one, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference if there are two more cats. Why only her? Is she more noble than you two? We birds are the most fair, not like some people, who are partial to one!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing fed the cats and looked at them provocatively.\nSu Miaomiao was about to go down and beat him when Xie Jingyuan hugged her with one hand and closed the curtain with the other.\nThe light cast their figures on the curtains, and they seemed to be embracing each other.\nAs soon as Gu Jialing thought his eyes were getting hot, the light in that room was turned off.\nHe clicked his tongue twice, and came to the fourth floor to chat with Xu Shou.\nXu Shou sat on the bed with his notebook on his lap, looking serious.\nGu Jialing probed to take a look, but Xu Shou slammed the screen shut with a displeased expression, saying, \u201cIt involves the company\u2019s secrets, so don\u2019t look.\u201d\nGu Jialing sneered, \u201cI even know the secret that you\u2019re a dog, but you still care about the company\u2019s secrets?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "211": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-211/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXu Shou refused to engage in such a meaningless dispute with him and asked directly, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nGu Jialing stepped on the ground, moved the office chair, and gestured toward the other room.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Taoist master and Su Miaomiao got married fast, so are they going to have a baby soon?\u201d\nXu Shou thought for a moment, and then said, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be so fast. The Taoist master has just started a company, and Su Miaomiao has to play tennis. So now is not a suitable time for pregnancy.\u201d\nGu Jialing said unexpectedly, \u201cYou know a lot.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s human nature.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t use these kinds of words, what does human nature have to do with you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can go.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s chat since we rarely see each other. By the way, do you have a preference for the gender of their future baby? If it\u2019s a boy, I\u2019m afraid that his temperament would be like the Taoist masters\u2019, which wouldn\u2019t be fun at all. If it\u2019s a girl, I\u2019m afraid she would be as domineering as Su Miaomiao, not cute either,\u201d Gu Jianling said.\nXu Shou replied, \u201cWhether they have a boy or girl has nothing to do with you, you don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201d\nGu Jialing retorted, \u201cWhat you said is wrong. Their children are also children of Qingxu Temple. We are all guardians of the temple, so it does concern me. We will be seeing each other often in the future, so have you thought about how to get along with the little ones? Oh my God, I hope Su Miaomiao\u2019s children won\u2019t be as greedy as her. I bet they might demand jewelry as gifts.\u201d\nXu Shou pushed him out.\nAfter he left, Gu Jialing\u2019s words seemed to echo in his ears.\nXu Shou\u2019s thoughts shifted accordingly.\nWhat if Su Miaomiao\u2019s children also disliked his smell?\nHis mood quickly fell when he thought that the children of the Taoist master would avoid him and not let him hold them.\nTen minutes later, Xu Shou opened a \u201cmen\u2019s perfume\u201d webpage.\nIn the other room, after rolling around in the bed for a few times, Su Miaomiao pressed onto Xie Jingyuan\u2019s body.\nXie Jingyuan held her hand and explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t bring that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cFor contraception.\u201d\nHow could he prepare such a thing when they were going to stay there for one night.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine even if you didnt bring it.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan asked in a serious tone, \u201cDo you want a child?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao, however, wanted the Taoist master.\nHowever, knowing that human pregnancy took close to nine months, Su Miaomiao immediately shook her head to his question. She knew that if she really got pregnant that night, it meant she would not be able to be intimate with the Taoist master for nine months.\nXie Jingyuan breathed a sigh of relief, and then became curious about her attitude toward having a child. Of course, whether Su Miaomiao wanted a child or not, Xie Jingyuan would respect her preference.\nHe was alone in his previous life, but with Su Miaomiao by his side in the current one, he was already satisfied.\nSu Miaomiao leaned on his shoulder and explained, \u201cI might think about it in the future, but I definitely don\u2019t want to now, and now I like the Taoist master more.\u201d\nShe hugged him stickily, as if when two people were together, they should be intimate in such a posture.\nXie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t help but hug her to his body and let her lie on his chest.\n\u2014-\nThat night, it snowed heavily.\nXie Jingyuan woke up first in the morning, and heard the sound of someone sweeping snow on the street in the distance.\nHe let Su Miaomiao continue to sleep, got dressed, and went with Xu Shou to help clear the road.\nThe two of them were so diligent that they couldn\u2019t be persuaded, so Mr. Gu dragged Gu Jialing out of bed and kicked him out to sweep the snow.\nGu Jialing told them, \u201cYou both are so troublesome!\u201d\nXu Shou ignored his complaints, swept the snow for a while, and then secretly glanced at Xie Jingyuan who walked to his side and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nXu Shou subconsciously looked at the room on the fourth floor.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t quite understand what he meant. Mr. Xu Shou didn\u2019t want to ask Su Miaomiao to come down and sweep the snow with them, did he?\nXu Shou clenched the broom tightly, lowered his eyes and said, \u201cTaoist Master, is there any way you can block the dog\u2019s smell on me?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan asked with a frown, \u201cBesides the three of you, is there anyone else who can smell your original body?\u201d\nXu Shou explained, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if you have children in the future, the children would hate me too.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nRecalling the previous night, and confirming that he and Su Miaomiao did not do any actions that Xu Shou would hear and misunderstand, he said as usual, \u201cFirst of all, we will not have children in some time, and we may not necessarily have children in the future. Secondly, no one hates you, including Miaomiao. Finally, if there comes such a day, I will find a way to help block your smell.\u201d\nXu Shou just smiled on hearing that.\nGu Jialing approached suspiciously, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan returned to his original place and continued to sweep the snow, Xu Shou also kicked Gu Jialing away with the broom like a bird.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t stay in bed for too long, she put on a warm down jacket and came down to play in the snow.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t taken a group picture for a long time, shall we take one?\u201d Gu Jialing chose a snow scene that hadn\u2019t been cleared, and called the old man to help.\nSu Miaomiao must be next to Xie Jingyuan, so Gu Jialing rushed to occupy her other side, and Xu Shou continued to stand on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s other side.\nAfter taking a few pictures, Xie Jingyuan looked at Xu Shou and asked Su Miaomiao, \u201cYou can also take a picture with Xu Shou.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xu Shou, and found that he was also looking at her with red ears.\nSu Miaomiao thought of the big dog in Qingxu Temple.\nShe was very afraid of him, but always wanted to jump on his back to play.\nSu Miaomiao made a condition, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, but you have to carry me on your back.\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But when she tried to pull his hair, he warned her, \u201cDon\u2019t go too far.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too stingy! Do you know how many people want to take a picture with me?\u201d\nXu Shou pursed his lips in dissatisfaction.\nSeeing that, Mr. Gu asked the two young people to look at the camera.\nSu Miaomiao smiled brightly.\nXu Shou looked at her white and clean hands, and felt that Su Miaomiao\u2019s children would definitely let him hug them in the future.\nAfter the picture was taken, the group of four came together to take a look.\nIn the middle of the screen was of course Xu Shou who was carrying Su Miaomiao on his back, and Xie Jingyuan was also standing in the corner of the screen, with a weird expression.\nGu Jialing said on seeing that, \u201cTaoist Master, you seem to have discovered Su Miaomiao having an affair with Xu Shou in this picture.\u201d\nNot long after congratulating Mr. Gu on his birthday, it would be new year.\nOn the day of the new year, Xie Jingyuan went to the county town to accompany Grandpa and Grandma Su.\nOn the eve of the Spring Festival, due to Tang Shiwei\u2019s work arrangements, she would not be able to return to Jiangcheng that year, and Su Mingan was going to stay with her to celebrate the New Year. So Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan planned to go to Jiangcheng together.\nGrandma Tao assured her grandson, \u201cYou have nothing to worry about, your father is here.\u201d\nShe liked her eldest grandson the most, but her son, his wife, and the twins were also her family members, so she wouldn\u2019t be lonely during the New Year. Her grandson usually spent a lot of time with her, and that year was the year he and Miaomiao obtained the certificate, so he should visit Miaomiao\u2019s elders on both sides.\nWhen the old lady said so, Xie Jingyuan went to buy new year\u2019s goods without worry, and then boarded the plane to Jiangcheng with Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s grandparents were very strong, and the old couple lived alone in a villa, but every Chinese New Year, her two uncles would bring their families to the villa for the New Year, and it was very lively for several days in a row. Her uncle\u2019s cousin drove to the airport and picked them up.\nAfter getting out of the car, Su Miaomiao saw her grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, and finally her cousin Tang Yan.\nIt was just that next to Tang Yan, there was another familiar but not very familiar face, Zhou Hang.\nMeeting Su Miaomiao\u2019s gaze, Zhou Hang showed a slightly shy smile.\nHe had been in love with Tang Yan for so many years, and he was finally qualified to meet her parents that year.\n\u201cXiao Hang, this is Jing Yuan, haven\u2019t you seen him in Beijing before?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him before, we had dinner once.\u201d\nThinking that Tang Yan would at least take him to a dinner party with her cousin, Zhou Hang felt somewhat comforted.\nXie Jingyuan greeted every relative, and finally shook hands with Zhou Hang.\nZhou Hang, who had already felt inferior to Xie Jingyuan countless times, had developed immunity, and could get along with him more naturally.\nHowever, because Xie Jingyuan would entertain those relatives in Jiangcheng for Su Miaomiao every year when Beijing held the China Open, the relatives treated him more intimately, just like their own child. So Zhou Hang observed for a while, and he complained to Tang Yan in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault, if you had brought me here earlier, I would have become one with everyone.\u201d\n\u201cJing Yuan has been with Miaomiao for twenty-two years, how do you compare with him?\u201d\nThat day was New Year\u2019s Eve. In the evening, everyone was divided into two groups to prepare dinner. The uncles and aunts went to cook southern New Year\u2019s Eve dishes, and the grandparents started preparing dumplings for Su Miaomiao, Xie Jingyuan, and Zhou Hang.\nSeeing Zhou Hang helping her, the grandma said in surprise, \u201cXiao Hang can make dumplings?\u201d\nZhou Hang smiled very brightly, and glanced at Xie Jingyuan secretly. Even if Xie Jingyuan was a God-level person who could take care of Su Miaomiao, he probably had never done such a down-to-earth job as making dumplings.\u00a0\nThen Zhou Hang watched as Xie Jingyuan took off his coat and rolled up his shirt sleeves, as if he was about to strike.\n\u201cWell, Miaomiao likes to eat seafood stuffing, I\u2019ll go to the kitchen to make the stuffing first.\u201d\nTang Yan brought out two new aprons, one with \u201cGod of Cooking\u201d printed on it, and the other with \u201cFoodie\u201d printed on it.\n\u201cThis is a gift I gave to my grandparents before, and it\u2019s just right for you to use.\u201d\nAs she said that, Tang Yan casually handed the \u201cGod of Cooking\u201d to Xie Jingyuan, and then handed the \u201cFoodie\u201d to Zhou Hang.\nZhou Hang felt that his girlfriend did it on purpose, since he could also be a chef.\nHowever, Tang Yan also cared about Zhou Hang, fearing that he would not be able to integrate into the family, when Zhou Hang accompanied her grandparents rolling dumpling wrappers, Tang Yan sat beside him and chatted.\nXie Jingyuan was standing in the kitchen packing up the seafood. After seeing the scene, he went to look at the sofa.\nSu Miaomiao sat on the sofa comfortably and lazily. The three-year-old nephew of her cousin was watching a cartoon, and Su Miaomiao watched it as well.\nXie Jingyuan thought about it, but still didn\u2019t call her over via voice transmission.\nUnexpectedly, Su Miaomiao voluntarily left the sofa and came to him.\n\u201cIs the cartoon not good?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked while chopping stuffing.\nSu Miaomiao nodded and snorted, \u201cIt\u2019s all about dogs, Xu Shou probably will like to watch it.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter finishing the stuffing, Xie Jingyuan took it in and Su Miaomiao also followed.\nThe grandma said to Tang Yan, \u201cWhen are you and Xiao Hang going to get married? Miaomiao is younger than you, and will have a wedding on National Day this year.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know why I only brought Zhou Hang home now? I was afraid that you would urge me to marry.\u201d\nHer grandpa said from the side, \u201cIf you had done it earlier, why would we need to urge you? We didn\u2019t urge Miaomiao.\u201d\nZhou Hang rescued his girlfriend, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault that I\u2019m not good enough. I just earned Yanyan\u2019s approval this year.\u201d\nThe grandma said with a smile, \u201cHe is so sweet and tall, growing more handsome each day. Plus, he can cook too \u2013 he\u2019s already very impressive!.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Cousin is the best!\u201d\nTang Yan also hugged her little cousin and kissed her.\nIf it were another cousin, Tang Yan would have to vent her anger to some extent because she would be forced to marry by her elders because the other party married too early, but how could she be willing to do so with her obedient and sweet little cousin?\nThe grandparents just chatted casually, and the young people didn\u2019t seem interested in their conversation, so they shifted the topic to other things.\nZhou Hang continued to observe Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cooking skills. The dumplings were like a work of art, with folds resembling fish scales.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to eat these dumplings,\u201d Tang Yan exclaimed.\nThe uncles and aunts were attracted by the work of art, and some even took out their phones to take pictures.\nZhou Hang looked at the dumplings he had made and sighed inwardly. Compared to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s impressive dumplings, the ones he made seemed quite ordinary. He felt like he was destined to be overshadowed by his brother-in-law and couldn\u2019t help but feel defeated.\nXie Jingyuan just secretly grabbed Su Miaomiao who was about to poke the dumpling, making her pout because her fingers were stained with flour from his hand. After wiping it on his apron, she obediently stopped making trouble.\nThe whole family had a lively New Year\u2019s Eve dinner, and after the meal, they walked to the riverside one kilometer away to enjoy the fireworks.\nIt was the first time Xie Jingyuan went to that riverside. In the past, he would often see the river scene there on video calls with Su Miaomiao.\nBecause there would be fireworks, many citizens gathered by the river with their significant other or family members.\nSu Miaomiao held hands with Tang Yan and walked beside her grandparents.\nXie Jingyuan and Zhou Hang followed side by side.\nZhou Hang tried to chat with him, \u201cActually, I wanted to propose to Yanyan a long time ago, but she didn\u2019t want to marry so fast and dragged the matter until now. But she said that if she catches the bouquet of flowers at your wedding, that will be the signal to propose. Brother-in-law, see if you can talk to Miaomiao and ask her to help me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan refused directly, \u201cIt depends on fate, you can\u2019t cheat.\u201d\nZhou Hang laughed dryly, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded.\nWhen they came to an area where there were few people, the whole family stopped.\nThe fireworks show hadn\u2019t started yet.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s phone, which was with Xie Jingyuan, rang.\nWhen the video call was connected, Gu Jialing\u2019s smiling face visibly froze when it met Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cold face, \u201cTaoist Master, why is it you?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan remembered the nonsense that Gu Jialing had said to Su Miaomiao by chance before, and asked lightly, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be me? Do you have something to do with her?\u201d\nGu Jialing said in a hurry, \u201cNo, I just want to chat with her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan moved the phone, showed him Su Miaomiao and Tang Yan together, and said, \u201cShe\u2019s not free right now.\u201d\n\u201cOh, then I\u2019ll hang up.\u201d\nHe really hung up, without even looking at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s face again.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t care either.\nNext to him, Zhou Hang also received a video call from his relatives, and they chatted very lively.\nXie Jingyuan stood by the fence, facing the broad river.\nOn the other side was a line of high-rise buildings. Various electronically projected images of Spring Festival congratulations were played on the surface of the building, and a shadow of people could be seen faintly shaking below. He thought that it must be as lively as the place they were in.\nSeveral cruise ships were floating on the river, making rumbling noises.\nAs the slightly cold river wind blew, Xie Jingyuan suddenly thought of his previous life.\nWhen he hadn\u2019t entered Qingxu Temple, he only had his grandmother by his side, and every festival was lonely. The neighbors next door would set off firecrackers, but he was not interested in them, and his grandmother was not in that mood either. His grandmother preferred to sit by the window and sigh, recalling how hard it was for her to raise her son, and no matter how much she gave up for him, her son after getting married and starting a business, left her alone.\nAfter his grandmother died of illness, Xie Jingyuan was taken to Qingxu Temple. Since then, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s life was only for cultivation.\nAs a Taoist master, far away from the world of mortals, there was no sorrow in his heart, and even the feeling of loneliness was seldom felt. Until there were three more demons in the view.\nXu Shou was loyal to him because he saved his life, but he didn\u2019t talk to Xu Shou, who wouldn\u2019t chat with him except when he was ordered to do something.\nGu Jialing relied on him, and had nowhere to go. Because he didn\u2019t allow it, Gu Jialing didn\u2019t dare to make noise in front of him.\nSu Miaomiao seemed to be the most helpless because she was brought back to be taken care of, but she was also the most courageous one and liked to go to his room the most.\nShe went there so frequently that every time Xie Jingyuan looked back, he would subconsciously observe if there were any new changes in the room.\nObviously he could stop it, but he chose to acquiesce.\n\u201cMaster, what are you thinking about?\u201d Su Miaomiao ran over suddenly, squeezed into the gap between him and the protective fence as usual, and hugged him.\nXie Jingyuan patted her head and said in a low voice, \u201cI miss you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao asked strangely, \u201cWhy do you miss me? Am I not by your side?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was thinking about how to explain it, when suddenly fireworks shot up above the river.\nThe fireworks bloomed so fast that Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t even have time to turn her head.\nHowever, she saw the Taoist master\u2019s eyes, those eyes that were always cold and indifferent, were now filled with bright and gorgeous fireworks.\nSuch a Taoist master was a little strange, but very good-looking.\nSu Miaomiao smiled, stood on tiptoe, and kissed those eyes.\nWhen she wanted to retreat, Xie Jingyuan hugged her waist, and kissed her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The remaining quarter was an ancient garden designed by Gu Jialing himself. After posting the beautiful pictures he took on the Internet, some netizens misunderstood that it was a classical garden in the south of Yangtze River.\nBecause Gu Jialing said that he had a surprise for the three of them, Su Miaomiao and the others were not allowed to visit in advance, so it was not until the afternoon before the wedding that Su Miaomiao and other relatives and friends finally moved in.\nGu Jialing said, \u201cThe announcement will be made tomorrow night, you should concentrate on preparing to be a bride first!\u201d\nIf Su Miaomiao were a cat, she would have explored the entire resort to find the surprise Gu Jialing hidden. But as a human being who was busy preparing for a grand wedding, even if she spared a little time, the resort was too big to be explored in half a day.\nShe didn\u2019t have time to explore, and Xie Jingyuan was also busy, so he couldn\u2019t help her if he wanted to.\nXu Shou was free, but he was not interested in that kind of thing. Anyway, Gu Jialing would show them the surprise the next night, so there was no need to think about it much.\nSu Miaomiaon, who was about to go to bed, was still messaging Gu Jialing: What kind of surprise is it?!\nGu Jialing: Go to sleep. The dark circles under your eyes will not look good in pictures tomorrow.\nXu Shou: If you don\u2019t tell her in three minutes, I\u2019ll go over and beat you.\nGu Jialing: You people! How can it be a surprise if I tell her?!\nGu Jialing: Forget it, I\u2019ll tell her. I built a temple that looks exactly like Qingxu Temple in the most beautiful place in the garden where visitors are not allowed to go!\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the fear that the group of relatives and friends would not be able to accept the wedding in the temple, Gu Jialing would have wanted to make it there.\nGu Jialing: Don\u2019t go too far! Without building the temple, the Taoist master and his wife\u2019s temple will just be virtually made!\nSu Miaomiao thought about it and felt that it made sense, so she admitted the surprise.\nAfter her curiosity was satisfied, she quit chatting and went to sleep peacefully.\nGu Jialing: Taoist Master, are you nervous? Let me tell you, I also spent a lot of money to carve statues of the patriarch and Sanqing Tianzun (three highest Taoist deities), which are exactly the same as the ones in the temple, and they have been moved there, so that they could witness your wedding with Su Miaomiao together.\nXie Jingyuan did not speak for a long time.\nGu Jialing: Taoist Master, did you fall asleep? Xu Shou?\nXu Shou was silent.\nAlthough he felt that the Taoist master married Su Miaomiao for a good reason, and that he deserved to be worthy of the patriarch, he felt that something was wrong.\nAt that time, Xie Jingyuan finally sent a message: Send me the address, and I will consecrate (state formally that a place or an object can be used for religious purposes) the patriarch and the others.\nIn the middle of the night, Xie Jingyuan, the groom-to-be, led two connoisseurs who were not Taoists, and went to consecrate the four statues.\nThe consecration ceremony was over at one o\u2019clock in the morning.\nGu Jialing yawned after walking out of the side hall dedicated to the patriarch.\nIf he had known that there would be a consecration, he would have told the Taoist master in advance, so that he would not have to worry about it that night.\nHe was so sleepy that when going down the mountain, Gu Jialing slipped and fell. Luckily, Xu Shou pulled him up on time.\nGu Jialing was not injured, so Xu Shou turned his head to look at the temple hidden in the darkness, and asked in a low voice, \u201cTaoist Master, won\u2019t the patriarch be angry?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would he be? In the future, the patriarch will only be happy to be here.\u201d\nXu Shou observed his expression, and saw that the Taoist master was as indifferent as ever, so he dispelled the doubt in his heart.\nAt dawn, Su Miaomiao got up early to get dressed.\nThe bridesmaids were already by her side, including her cousin Tang Yan, her roommates from the university, and Cheng Yue and Feng Xiaoyu whom she had known since kindergarten.\nThe wedding was a Chinese-style one, so naturally Su Miaomiao wore a phoenix crown and Xiapei. (embroidered wedding dress)\u00a0\nThe wedding dress was dotted with sparkling jewels and decorated with gemstone flowers.\n\u201cMiaomiao is the most beautiful and luxurious bride,\u201d Cheng Yue commented enviously while taking pictures.\nSu Miaomiao stretched out her two feet and was very satisfied with that pair of beautiful shoes.\nShe was a white cat, and she preferred that kind of snow-white wedding dress. Gu Jialing insisted on holding a Chinese-style wedding. In order to happily wear the phoenix coronet and Xiapei, he could only let her pick the wedding dress she liked. Fortunately, both Su Miaomiao and Xie Jingyuan could afford the luxury.\nWhen the auspicious time came, Xie Jingyuan drove a BMW to the garden where Su Miaomiao was staying.\nOriginally, Gu Jialing wanted to prepare real horses and sedan chairs, but the real horses could get out of control easily, so he compromised at that step.\nThe bride Xie Jingyuan received was covered with a veiling embroidered with red and gold thread.\nSu Miaomiao wanted to lift the veil to look at him, but Xie Jingyuan took her hand first and said, \u201cWait a little longer. I will help you remove it by then.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao obediently sat beside him.\nThe car slowly drove to the wedding venue.\nThe relatives and friends had gathered together.\nSu Mingan, Tang Shiwei, Xie Rong and Qiao Lili both sat in the main seats because they wanted to pay homage to the high hall.\nXie Rong was really happy and always had a smile on his face.\nQiao Lili also tried her best to smile like a loving mother instead of putting on a flattery smile.\nIn the past, Xie Jingyuan was very good, so good that she was envious and jealous, jealous that Xie Jingyuan took away all Xie Rong\u2019s attention from their children.\nBut Xie Jingyuan, who had studied in university, was so outstanding that he developed a super hair growth serum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "215": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-215/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQiao Lili began to lose her hair when she was in her thirties, and finally waited for Xie Jingyuan\u2019s super hair growth serum to save the fate of being completely bald.\nBut was that enough?\nTang Shiwei who was sitting next to her was obviously a few years older than her but looked as if she was just in her early thirties. Her beauty was still the same, including Su Mingan who looked a few years younger than Xie Rong. Qiao Lili decided that Xie Jingyuan must have developed good things that could help people delay aging.\nQiao Lili wanted those goodies.\nTherefore, she no longer dared to be jealous, wishing to send them the warmth of a real mother.\nOf course, the young couple didn\u2019t need it, but it didn\u2019t matter, Qiao Lili would continue to work hard, and try to win their favor with continuous sincerity.\nFor Su Miaomiao, what she liked most about that wedding was the beautiful wedding dress, and the rest was nothing more than going through the process.\nFinally, throwing the bouquet was about to start. After that, they would toast, and after that, they would eat.\nThe bridesmaids were excited.\nZhou Hang was more excited than them. Even ignoring the good-natured laughter of relatives and friends, he went over to snatch the bouquet.\nIn the end, Zhou Hang used his height advantage to lift Tang Yan high, allowing her to receive the bouquet smoothly.\nCheng Yue and the girls had just graduated from college the previous year, so they were not in a hurry at all, so they pushed the two together with a smile and made a fuss.\nOn the other side, Su Miaomiao took Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arm and went to make a toast with relatives and friends together.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t drink enough, so her husband specially prepared boiled water for her. As for him, he drank real wine, but didn\u2019t even turn red.\nGu Jialing quietly murmured to Xu Shou, \u201cBased on the Taoist master\u2019s drinking capacity, the patriarch must also like him.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded. In his eyes, the Taoist master was indeed the best in everything he did.\nThey had a meal with relatives and friends at noon, and continued to eat at night.\nWhen the banquet was finally over, some relatives and friends continued to gather and some others went back to their rooms to rest, while Gu Jialing drove the bride and groom to the secret base that belonged to them alone.\nSu Miaomiao was tired, so she leaned against Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms, wanting to sleep.\nGu Jialing looked back and reminded her, \u201cDon\u2019t sleep, the patriarch is still waiting in the temple. If you don\u2019t offer incense to the patriarch, he wouldn\u2019t recognize you as his wife.\u201d\nHis words were enough for her to wake up. Therefore, she shook her head, trying to drive away the drowsiness.\nXie Jingyuan injected a bit of spiritual power into her, so that she would not feel sleepy so quickly.\nWhen they reached the foot of the mountain, they walked up there.\nGu Jialing went up first, briskly, alone. While Xie Jingyuan carried Su Miaomiao on his back.\nThe moonlight was a bit brighter than the previous night. Su Miaomiao looked at the surrounding roads and woods. It was as if she had returned to the day when she first was brought to Qingxu Temple.\nOn that day, Xie Jingyuan locked her in a spirit animal bag and hung it around his waist, so she could see outside, but people outside couldn\u2019t see her.\nThe spirit animal bag and the outside air were also circulated. Although she was locked up and couldn\u2019t move freely, she was surrounded by Xie Jingyuan\u2019s pleasant smell of autumn dew, listening to him talking with the two little Taoist masters.\nHis voice was very pleasant to hear, like the gurgling of a clean and cool stream. Listening to it, one would feel comfortable and want to sleep.\nShe was obviously caught by Xie Jingyuan at that time, but she didn\u2019t hate him at all.\nIf it were another Taoist master, Su Miaomiao would definitely find a way to escape, and even kill him.\n\u201cWe reached,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said suddenly.\nSu Miaomiao raised her head from his shoulder, and under the moonlight, she saw a familiar gate, with the words \u2013 Qingxu Temple.\nXie Jingyuan put her down, took her hand and walked inside.\nThere was no one there, only Gu Jialing and Xu Shou were standing in front of the main hall, watching them, one with a bright smile, and the other without emotions.\nWhat Su Miaomiao saw was the little blue bird that flew over to look at her curiously on that day in her previous life, and a majestic big black dog.\nAt that time, she was a little scared, afraid that she would be the weakest demon.\nFortunately, Gu Jialing\u2019s cultivation was comparable to hers, or he would catch her and bully her if she was not careful.\nAs for Xu Shou, he turned out to be a good dog who would chase several miles to return the pilgrims coins she picked up.\nWhen she was sure that she would not encounter danger in Qingxu Temple, Su Miaomiao considered it her home.\nShe felt comfortable going home.\nWitnessed by Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, Su Miaomiao followed Xie Jingyuan to burn incense for Sanqing Tianzun, and even went to burn incense for the patriarch.\nThe statue of the patriarch was majestic, with a long sword on his waist and a wine gourd hanging beside him.\nXie Jingyuan looked devout, and Su Miaomiao was also very serious.\nThe incense burned quietly, and it was not extinguished, which meant that the patriarch had approved of their marriage.\nSu Miaomiao smiled happily at Xie Jingyuan.\nAfter watching the ceremony, Gu Jialing dragged Xu Shou down the mountain, while Xie Jingyuan picked up Su Miaomiao and went to his room.\nGu Jialing had a good memory, and restored all the things as it was in the previous life, except for a new bed with a red quilt on it, and a red gauze curtain beside the bed.\nOn the desk by the window, a pair of dragon and phoenix candles were burning.\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m officially Mrs. Taoist.\u201d\nLooking at the familiar room, Su Miaomiao looked at the ring on her hand, and said to Xie Jingyuan with satisfaction.\nXie Jingyuan interjected, \u201cNot yet,\u201d making her look suspiciously at him. But he only put down the gauze curtain, pulled her his arms, and explained in her ear, \u201cUntil the consummation of the marriage, it\u2019s not a marriage.\u201d\n\u201cWe have already\u2026\u201d\nBefore she could finish speaking, Xie Jingyuan kissed her and pressed her on the bed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "216": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-216/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was clearly noon, but Chenxian Town was covered by dark clouds for dozens of miles, and there were even frightening roars of demons from the mountain from time to time.\nAs early as when there was a change in the sky, the people in the town hid in their homes one after another, closed the doors and windows, and kept silent.\nIn a five-entry compound, the dignified old mayor clinged to the door, looking in the direction of Qingxu Mountain through the crack of the door.\nOn the mountain, there was a temple that was well-known to the surrounding people.\nIt was said that Qingxu Temple had existed for thousands of years. The patriarch was a Taoist surnamed Chen, who had already ascended to immortality, and the name \u201cChenxian Town\u201d was taken because of him.\nThe old mayor had never seen the elegant demeanor of the patriarch surnamed Chen before his death, but he had seen the former master of the temple, Master Ling Xiao. Four years ago, Master Ling Xiao passed away and became immortal. He passed on the temple duty to his youngest and best disciple, Xie Jingyuan.\nAt the beginning, the common people were worried that the young man was not good enough, but they didn\u2019t expect him to be better. He could even deal with a thousand-year-old demon.\nIn such a way, the power of Qingxu Temple to eliminate demons was still there, but it was a pity that the masters of the past dynasties did not have the aggressiveness to become famous in the world, and they did not bother to promote their reputation, so only the nearby people knew the power of Qingxu Temple.\n\u201cIt seems that some evil demons have gone to Qingxu Mountain. Judging by the situation, the evil demons may be difficult to deal with.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of demons are so bold? Taoist Master Xie killed two thousand-year-old demons in a row in recent years. Could it be that there are still ten thousand-year-old demons left?\u201d\n\u201cImpossible! That can\u2019t be. Not to mention Qingxu Mountain, they could wipe out our town at the same time\u2026\u201d\nBefore the old mayor finished speaking, he saw a black-winged eagle demon and a large python as thick as a millstone soaring into the sky, roaring and attacking downward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over! It\u2019s over! Taoist Master Xie was able to subdue a thousand-year-old demon alone, but if two, three or even more old demons besieged Qingxu Temple together, how could he cope?\u201d\nIt was indeed difficult for Xie Jingyuan to deal with three thousand-year-old demons at the same time. He fell in front of the half old tree in the yard. There was a hole at the bottom of the tree. At that moment, there was a shivering white cat hiding in the hole. Her snow-white hair was stained with someone\u2019s blood, and her blue eyes looked at him worriedly.\nThat cat was usually very alert, but she didn\u2019t hide with the other Taoist masters.\nTime was running out, Xie Jingyuan looked at the cat for the last time with gentle eyes and said, \u201cYou must cultivate hard and do good with your heart.\u201d\nHer eyes were so clear, they shouldn\u2019t be stained with the dirt of humans or demons.\nWiping off the blood from his lips, Xie Jingyuan stood up in front of her, and looked at the fox, eagle, and python on the opposite side.\nThe eyes of the beauty transformed into by the Nine-Tailed Fox gleamed with bloodthirsty light. Since Xie Jingyuan killed her partner, the Nine-Tailed Fox wanted to peel off the person\u2019s skin and drink up his blood.\nShe couldn\u2019t deal with Xie Jingyuan alone, so the Nine-Tailed Fox went to cooperate with other thousand-year-old demons, and did not hesitate to travel thousands of miles and spend all her family money.\nThe man turned into a python demon, squinted his dark yellow pupils, and looked at the temple with disgust,\u201dSister Fox, this place is too shabby, I\u2019m afraid there is nothing good here.\u201d\nThe Nine-Tailed Fox said, \u201cIsn\u2019t my reward enough for you? As I said earlier, I want to kill this person not for money, but for revenge.\u201d\nFlying in mid-air, the eagle said impatiently, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t be so long-winded, kill them all as soon as possible.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t deal with the three demons, and if the three demons wanted to kill him, they had to attack together.\nAs the eagle\u2019s voice fell, the three demons flew into the air at the same time, lining up in a line, and their powers condensed into a black light.\nThe ball of light was getting darker and blacker, with black threads running around the edge like electric lights, it seemed that it could no longer bear the more demonic power, and it couldn\u2019t wait to claim his life.\nA spell fell, and the sword glowed. In an instant, golden light enveloped the entire temple, and then headed toward the black light flying in midair.\nOn the ground in the distance, Gu Jialing had long been in a coma, and Xu Shou, who was covered in bruises, also passed out unwillingly the moment Xie Jingyuan raised his sword.\nOnly Su Miaomiao saw the brilliant golden light and the black light stalemate for a moment, and suddenly it shattered like an ice cover.\nThe shattered golden light bypassed the black one, entered the bodies of the fox and the python one after another, and pierced their cores.\nRelying on his speed advantage, the eagle narrowly avoided the golden light, and was only shot through one wing.\nBut Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t notice the scene, she only saw a black light flying straight toward Xie\nJingyuan after the golden light curtain was broken.\nAt that moment, in her mind was still the afterimage of that golden lighty.\nBut her body involuntarily turned into a white light, flew over, hugged the fallen man, and turned around.\nThe white robe and white skirt tightly protected the Taoist in her arms, but her thin back was exposed in front of the black light emitted by the three thousand-year-old demons.\nSeeing that the black light was about to take their lives, a golden phantom suddenly came from the side hall where the ancestor was worshiped, and smashed the black light.\nThe eagle with only half of his wings that could move was terrified. His feathers stood in horror, and he turned around to run away.\nXu Ying let out a sneer, and slapped the thousand-year-old eagle deeply into the ground. He couldn\u2019t die anymore, and even his core was split in two.\nAt the same time, the dense layers of dark clouds in the sky quietly dissipated, and the sun continued to shine brightly.\nIt was only at that moment that Su Miaomiao realized what she had done.\nShe looked at the unconscious Xie Jingyuan in her arms, then turned her head in a daze.\nThe black cloud and the demons disappeared, and behind her stood a phantom that was somewhat familiar but she could not remember where she had seen the phantom before.\nSu Miaomiao kept staring blankly at it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "217": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-217/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXu Ying was also looking at her, trying to say something, but his light began to fade.\nXu Ying had no choice but to swallow that nonsense, glanced at the ring on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s finger, and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cTell him that I only left a remnant in the temple. Because he was useless, it had already been used. If he can\u2019t hold on to Qingxu Temple, then he should drink the northwest wind together!\u201d (Live in poverty)\nBefore the deafening lingering sound fell, the phantom disappeared completely as if it had never appeared before.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the patriarch, the patriarch has appeared!\u201d\nThe little Taoist masters who had been hiding in the formation of the main hall ran out one after another and kowtowed to the place where the afterimage of the patriarch disappeared.\nAfter paying homage to the patriarch, one of Xie Jingyuan\u2019s martial uncles ran up to him, first felt his pulse, and then excitedly said, \u201cThe master is still alive!\u201d\nAfter finishing speaking, the uncle took Xie Jingyuan from Su Miaomiao\u2019s arms and carried him inside to heal his injuries.\nOriginally there were only a dozen or so Taoist masters in Qingxu Temple, and a few died in the melee, but now only nine of them could stand.\nThe six Taoist masters followed their uncles to take care of the temple\u2019s master. Only the seven-year-old Xuan Ling and the sixteen-year-old Xuan Cheng went to check on the dead brothers and uncles in grief. Finally, Xuan Cheng knelt beside Xu Shou\u2019s original shape with tears. Xuan Ling also held up Gu Jialing\u2019s small body, with his lips quivering, as if he might cry at any time.\nSu Miaomiao just focused on Xie Jingyuan, but when she saw the motionless bodies of Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, her voice trembled, \u201cAre they dead?\u201d\nShe liked the little blue bird. Although the little blue bird was very noisy, without him, Qingxu Temple would be too boring. She was afraid of Xu Shou, but she knew that he was a good dog. Even if she provoked him when she was bored, the big dog would not really kill her.\nXuan Cheng choked up and said, \u201cThey still have some energy, but they are hurt so badly\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao quickly checked their injuries, and then ran to the corpses of the fox and the python. Overcoming her fear of the two demons, she tried to dig out their cores, but unfortunately they were smashed to pieces by Xie Jingyuan\u2019s sword light, which also showed how determined Xie Jingyuan\u2019s heart was to kill demons.\nSu Miaomiao then ran to the big pit she had sunk into and dug out the body of the eagle. Fortunately, she found the demon\u2019s core that was cut into two.\nA complete core was a great supplement to demons. Although that core was split into two and its effectiveness was greatly reduced, it should be enough to save their lives.\nSu Miaomiao gave Xu Shou and Gu Jialing half a core respectively.\nAt that moment, two middle-aged Taoist masters came out and looked at Su Miaomiao with complicated eyes.\nSu Miaomiao remembered Xie Jingyuan\u2019s warning that she was not allowed to take human form in the temple. Therefore, Su Miaomiao became her original form again; a beautiful and harmless white cat.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing were both males, so they always regarded the white cat as a male.\nUnexpectedly, when they were hiding in the main hall just now, they saw the white cat transform into a woman, and sacrifice herself to protect their junior.\nHowever, the demons that could be brought back by their junior should all be pure and good demons. Xu Shou and Gu Jialing had tried their best to protect their junior, and it was normal for the white cat to sacrifice her life.\nSince the white cat didn\u2019t pay much attention to them, Senior Zhao said, \u201cThe master is seriously injured and needs to rest. We are going to clean up the mess in the temple, so feel free to do whatever you want.\u201d\nAs soon as he finished speaking, other Taoist masters also came out, and the senior uncle Sun Shishu assigned the errands.\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t like to work, so while the Taoist masters were busy, she slipped into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room.\nThe seven-year-old Xuan Ling was sent to guard Xie Jingyuan.\nAfter going through such a big change, Xuan Ling\u2019s heart was still hanging tightly. When he suddenly heard the door being pushed open with no sound of footsteps, he trembled thinking that another big demon was coming. But when he looked at the door, all he saw was a round cat\u2019s head, with a white front paw on the door.\nUnaware of Xuan Ling\u2019s fear, Su Miaomiao went straight to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bed and jumped up lightly.\nXie Jingyuan, who was lying on the bed, was pale and frowning.\n\u201cCan you heal him?\u201d Xuan Ling asked with a glimmer of hope.\nBecause he was young and cute, Xuan Ling was the only little Taoist master Su Miaomiao had paid attention to except Xie Jingyuan after entering the temple.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s cultivation level was not high, and Xie Jingyuan\u2019s injury was too serious, even Master Sun couldn\u2019t heal him.\nBut with Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cultivation base, as long as he didn\u2019t die, he would be able to take care of himself after waking up.\nLooking at Xie Jingyuan for the last time, Su Miaomiao jumped out of the bed, then went to her usual sleeping position under the bed, and curled up into a ball.\nIt was too scary. She also had to sleep for a while, to suppress the shock.\nIn the evening, the last rays of the setting sun dyed the roof of Qingxu Temple red.\nSenior Zhao and Senior Qian came back from Chenxian Town and brought back several coffins.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because we didn\u2019t cultivate enough that we couldn\u2019t protect everyone.\u201d\nUncle Sun and Uncle Wang looked at each other, both showing shame.\nThe two of them, one in his 70s and the other in his early 60s, were decades older than Xie Jingyuan. However, they were not talented enough. The two of them combined couldn\u2019t beat one of the three thousand-year-old demons. So they could only try their best to protect the sect, and let Xie Jingyuan face the danger alone.\nSenior Zhao said, \u201cSenior, why did you say that? We practice to slay demons and protect the people. We don\u2019t want to be invincible, but we want to be worthy.\u201d\n\u201cYes, no matter how hard you work, don\u2019t blame yourself, Senior.\u201d\nSenior Sun nodded. As the night fell, he made a decision and said, \u201cI will guard the temple tonight. Junior Wang will be on duty tonight, and the rest of you can go to rest first. There will likely be pilgrims coming to the mountain to inquire about the situation tomorrow morning, and we will be busy.\u201d\nAfter the Taoists parted ways, Senior Sun went to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room.\nSu Miaomiao, who was still nested under the bed, heard footsteps. But she knew who was coming, so she didn\u2019t get up.\nUncle Sun checked Xie Jingyuan\u2019s condition, took a futon and put it on the ground beside him, and began to meditate.\nTime passed silently. At midnight, Su Miaomiao\u2019s ears twitched again. The next moment, she emerged from under the bed, and stepped on the ground without making a sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Xie Jingyuan was indeed in a bad condition. His thin lips moved slightly, as if he was thirsty.\nSu Miaomiao glanced at Senior Sun once more, but the old man was still immersed in his cultivation.\nShe had no choice but to transform into a human, fetched the kettle and tea bowl, supported Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder with one hand, and carefully pushed the edge of the tea bowl into his lips.\nAfter feeding him half a bowl of water little by little, Xie Jingyuan fell into a deep coma again.\nAfter putting the kettle away, Su Miaomiao turned her gaze to the white bearded Senior Sun. A sudden impulse took hold of her heart, and she sneaked under Xie Jingyuan\u2019s quilt.\nAlthough she was used to wandering in the mountains and forests, and had slept in even more uncomfortable places, when she had a bed to sleep on, why did she still need to sleep on the floor?\nAnyway, Senior Sun didn\u2019t know, and neither did Xie Jingyuan.\nAfter getting into the bed, Su Miaomiao nestled on the edge first, but smelling Xie Jingyuan and feeling the temperature of the human body passing over there, she couldn\u2019t help but rub toward him little by little, and finally clung to him.\nPerhaps it was because Xie Jingyuan\u2019s quilt was too comfortable, or because his smell made her feel at ease, so she slept for a long time.\nXie Jingyuan opened his eyes, saw the familiar room, and also saw Senior Sun who was meditating not far away.\nXie Jingyuan speculated that it might be because he successfully killed the three demons with his attack before he fell unconscious, so he survived, and Senior Sun and others were also there.\nWhen he woke up, he couldn\u2019t move, as if all the muscles and bones of his body had been crushed, and he felt powerless.\nHe just lay there, and the scene of fighting kept appearing in his mind, as well as those fellow disciples who died because they couldn\u2019t be rescued.\nHis thoughts were all occupied by memories until a slight itchiness came from his waist.\nUnable to move his arms, Xie Jingyuan was unable to find out what was lurking beside him.\nSuddenly, something soft brushed the back of his hand, small and delicate like a pair of cat ears.\nJust as he was about to speak, Senior Sun made a sudden movement. He opened his eyes and looked toward the bed after finishing his night\u2019s practice.\nThe soft and warm \u201cthing\u201d near his waist stopped moving.\nAlthough Xie Jingyuan wasn\u2019t sure if it was Su Miaomiao, he didn\u2019t dare to tell Senior Sun because he was afraid that he would really find her there, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it clearly.\n\u201cJing Yuan, are you awake?\u201d Senior Sun came over in surprise.\nXie Jingyuan also had some difficulty in speaking, and he could only condense his words, \u201cHow is the Qingxu Temple?\u201d\nSenior Sun sighed, and sat beside him, taking Xie Jingyuan\u2019s pulse while telling him what happened after he fell into a coma.\nThe focus was on the patriarch who appeared and solved the crisis, as well as the casualties. Regarding the cat sacrificing her life to save Xie Jingyuan, Senior Sun probably had forgotten it or thought it was not important, so he didn\u2019t mention it.\nIt was only then that Xie Jingyuan realized that the patriarch actually left a remnant in the temple, and it was fortunate that it was the case, otherwise the eagle would have survived, and would definitely continue to slaughter other members of the same sect, and even the people nearby.\nXie Jingyuan asked about Xu Shou and Gu Jialing\u2019s situation, and then said, \u201cSenior, go take care of other affairs.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go first. I\u2019ll let Xuan Cheng deliver the medicine later.\u201d\nAs soon as Senior Sun left, Xie Jingyuan lowered his eyes, looked at the spot near his waist where nothing unusual could be discerned from the surface, and said coldly, \u201cCome out.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan continued to say, \u201cI know you\u2019re inside.\u201d\nThe camouflage failed, so Su Miaomiao had no choice but to drill out.\nSu Miaomiao got out of the quilt, turned her head, and looked at Xie Jingyuan with a guilty conscience.\nSeeing that it was really her, Xie Jingyuan asked, \u201cWhy are you on my bed?\u201d\nOf course Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t say it was because the bed was comfortable, she blinked and said pitifully, \u201cI\u2019m afraid. I won\u2019t be afraid if I\u2019m next to the Taoist master.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan recalled the scene of her shivering while hiding in the tree hole.\nPerhaps in her eyes, the safest place was with him, the temple\u2019s master.\n\u201cThis is not appropriate,\u201d Xie Jingyuan said.\nSu Miaomiao jumped over him lightly and fell to the ground soundlessly.\n\u201cGo and see how Xu Shou and the others are doing,\u201d Xie Jingyuan ordered.\nSu Miaomiao wagged her tail obediently, walked to the door, opened a small gap with one paw, and then slipped out.\nQingxu Temple was not a big place, and there were no vacant rooms. When Xu Shou moved in, Xie Jingyuan personally built a wooden doghouse for him. Gu Jialing couldn\u2019t get a room, so he built a very beautiful birdhouse for him on a tree.\nBecause of serious injuries and coma, the dog and bird were placed in the guest room by the little Taoist masters to recuperate.\nSu Miaomiao came over and when she entered the door, she saw the big black dog lying on the wooden bed, with his mouth crooked, revealing two rows of fangs.\nGu Jialing may have received more considerate treatment because of his petite body and fragile look. He was not placed directly on the crude bed board, but in the soft futon.\nSu Miaomiao thought that even if it was Xie Jingyuan\u2019s futon for meditation, she would not lie on it. She wondered if Gu Jialing would curse after waking up.\nJumping onto the wooden bed, Su Miaomiao first checked Xu Shou\u2019s injuries.\nShe witnessed Xu Shou being relentlessly attacked by the fox, each time he was knocked to the ground. Despite the continuous attacks he faced, he rose to his feet every time. But eventually, one of the tails struck him with such force that it seemed like his bones might have been broken.\nBut those skin wounds on Xu Shou\u2019s body had disappeared, and there were only blood stains left on his black hair, which smelled bad.\nSu Miaomiao hurried away and went to see Gu Jialing.\nGu Jialing was a blue bird, not as big as Su Miaomiao\u2019s cat head. That guy always complained in Su Miaomiao\u2019s ear that Xie Jingyuan was stingy. That time, for some reason, he summoned the courage to fight the thousand-year-old eagle in order to protect Xie Jingyuan, and in the process, his two wings were broken.\nWith the help of half the demon\u2019s core, Gu Jialing not only recovered from the injury, but also shed a layer of feather, and sprouted a new set of royal blue wings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "219": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-219/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t hold back, and plucked his feathers with her paws, but he remained motionless.\nShe observed carefully, and felt that he might still be absorbing the remaining spiritual power of the core, and perhaps after waking up, both their cultivation could increase for decades.\nShe felt a tinge of regret, realizing she could have picked the core and kept it for herself.\nAfter the inspection, Su Miaomiao returned to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side.\nAs she was about to push the door open, she heard a low voice from inside, \u201cDon\u2019t come in.\u201d Reluctantly, Su Miaomiao had to lower her half-raised paw.\nShe heard Xuan Cheng\u2019s voice, and also heard the sound of splashing water.\nAfter a while, the seven-year-old Xuan Ling came out with a chamber pot.\nSu Miaomiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXuan Ling liked the white cat in the temple very much, and explained with a smile, \u201cThe temple\u2019s master just finished, now you can go in.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao tried to push the door again, but she did not hear any obstruction.\nAt that time, Xie Jingyuan was sitting on the head of the bed, and Xuan Cheng was holding a medicine bowl in his hand, feeding him spoonful by spoonful.\nFacing Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cold gaze, she thought for a while and jumped onto the south window sill.\nThe morning sun shone over, making the ball of snow-white cat fur dazzlingly white.\nThe sunshine at that time was the most comfortable, and Su Miaomiao squinted her eyes in enjoyment.\nSeeing the cat on the window sill, Xuan Cheng said in admiration, \u201cThe temple\u2019s master really has good eyes to recognize demons. The three demons you brought back are really loyal to you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao squinted her eyes, but did not sleep. Hearing Xuan Cheng\u2019s words, her ears twitched.\nLoyal? Besides Xu Shou, who else was loyal to Xie Jingyuan?\nXie Jingyuan also looked at Xuan Cheng inquiringly.\nXuan Cheng raised his chin to the white cat, and explained, \u201cThe dog and the bird helped us deal with the three evil demons. Later, when you fell into a coma, the white cat also jumped out of the hole, sacrificing herself to protect you in her arms. At that time, if the patriarch hadn\u2019t appeared at the critical moment, I\u2019m afraid that both the white cat and you would\u2026 Bah, bad luck, bad luck, I shouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was stunned, and looked toward the window sill in disbelief.\nSu Miaomiao was still basking in the sun with her eyes squinted, lazily retorting to Xuan Cheng, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I went to save the Taoist master, but it\u2019s definitely not because of loyalty. Don\u2019t talk nonsense. I won\u2019t treat the Taoist master as my master.\u201d\nXuan Cheng was only sixteen years old and was raised in the temple since he was a child, so his thoughts were simple.\u00a0\n\u201cYou are a pet he brought back, and he is of course your master.\u201d\nXuan Cheng didnt understand why Su Miaomiao opened her eyes unhappily and shot him a fierce glare.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and said, \u201cContinue to feed me the medicine.\u201d\nXuan Cheng also forgot about that brief debate and concentrated on serving him.\nAfter feeding him medicine, Xuan Cheng helped Xie Jingyuan lie back on the bed, and left with the tray.\nThe room became extremely quiet, so quiet that Xie Jingyuan could hear her breathing under the sunlight.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was almost falling asleep when she suddenly heard a familiar voice, cold and short.\nShe glanced blankly at Xie Jingyuan, who also looked at her, then looked away and said, \u201cThank you for saving me yesterday.\u201d\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the little Taoist master insisting on mentioning it, Su Miaomiao would not have taken it to heart at all.\nAs Xie Jingyuan expressed his gratitude, Su Miaomiao grew curious and asked \u201cHow is the Taoist master going to thank me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nQingxu Temple\u2019s master, who just expressed his gratitude casually, of course had to show sincerity.\nSu Miaomiao wanted a lot of things, including a steady supply of demon\u2019s cores, delicious food, jade pendants, and jewelry worn by wealthy pilgrims.\nHowever, what she needed most at that time was a comfortable nest.\nWhen she visited him the previous year, Xie Jingyuan also got her a futon, which was shabby, and Su Miaomiao was very dissatisfied.\n\u201cI want a new nest, something nice and comfortable.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan thought of the futon he had prepared for her, a brand new futon that had not been used by anyone, covered with a plain blue coarse cloth.\nHe knew she was a banshee, so her requirements may be higher in that regard.\n\u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d\nAfter healing, he would take her to town and let her choose a futon that could meet her requirement.\nAfter dawn, many people really went to Qingxu Temple.\nKnowing that Qingxu Temple eradicated three thousand-year-old demons with the help of the patriarch, and suffered serious losses at the same time, devout people donated a sum of money.\nIn that world where demons frequently appeared, those common people had been blessed by Qingxu Temple for generations, and naturally hoped that it could exist for a long time.\nIt was not until dusk that the steady stream of pilgrims finally left.\nXie Jingyuan lay on the bed for a whole day, and Su Miaomiao also stayed with him. Of course, she hid under Xie Jingyuan\u2019s bed most of the time. Although that guy didn\u2019t drive her away, he was not happy to let others know about her on his side.\nDuring dinner, Xie Jingyuan could barely get out of bed, so he didn\u2019t let anyone take care of him that night.\nAs for Su Miaomiao, because she stayed under the bed obediently and quietly, Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t drive her out on purpose.\nCultivation was the best way to heal injuries. At night, Xie Jingyuan sat cross-legged as usual.\nThat posture tore the wounds everywhere, but when the spiritual power circulated in the body, it quickly suppressed the pain of the wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "220": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-220/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao got out of the bed and saw Xie Jingyuan, who looked much better.\nAfter staring at Xie Jingyuan for a while, Su Miaomiao\u2019s gaze moved elsewhere.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s room could only be considered ordinary, the bed was also the kind of simple wooden bed used by Taoist masters, covered with a thin layer of sheets.\nBecause Xie Jingyuan was sitting, there was a lot of space on both sides and behind him, enough for Su Miaomiao to roll around on it several times.\nThe bed should be used for sleeping. Since he was not sleeping, it shouldn\u2019t matter if she took up some space, right?\nIt may be that they had gone through a life-and-death crisis together, so she was not so afraid of him. After all, he stood in front of her and was willing to protect her.\nAfter she glanced at his face, she jumped up lightly, carefully walked around behind him, and curled up into a ball.\nUsually when Xie Jingyuan meditated at night, he would send out a ray of spiritual consciousness to alert his surroundings, but since healing was important, Xie Jingyuan concentrated on cultivation.\nIf Su Miaomiao just moved carefully around him, no matter how lightly she moved, Xie Jingyuan would not be able to notice it. But she was not honest in her sleep. She moved to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side little by little, and pressed against his back tightly.\nWhen he felt a warm sensation against his back, he turned his head and saw the sleeping cat in the dark, with her head and back against him, and her limbs stretched out.\nIf it was her human form, Xie Jingyuan would definitely drive her away and make her turn back into a cat\u2026\nHowever, before he could continue cultivating, the cat moved again. The round cat\u2019s head spun around against him, and finally nestled on his crossed legs.\nXie Jingyuan wanted to carry her away, but when he touched the soft snow-white fur, he retracted his hand as if it was scalded.\nSu Miaomiao groaned as if disturbed, and soon fell asleep again.\nHe was the Taoist master, so naturally there was no safer place than his side. She could not think about anything, and did not need to be vigilant because of the noise outside, but slept peacefully for a whole night.\nXie Jingyuan stared at her for a while, made sure that she was only there to sleep and would not cause trouble, and he continued to cultivate.\nAt dawn, Xie Jingyuan finished his training, closed his eyes and said, \u201cGo out.\u201d\nThe sound was like a wake-up call, causing Su Miaomiao to raise her head suddenly to look at the Taoist master and obediently step away from his legs.\nXie Jingyuan made a new rule for her: Nobody, including Gu Jialing, should find out that she spent the night in his room.\nAlthough he couldn\u2019t hide that matter from Xu Shou, he trusted that he would never misunderstand his intentions.\nThat morning, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s face was still pale, but he was able to go out and walk around. He first went to pay homage to a few fellow disciples, and then went to visit Xu Shou and Gu Jialing.\nXuan Ling washed Xu Shou\u2019s hair clean, coupled with the nourishment of the demon\u2019s core, the black hair on his back got shiny. Su Miaomiao, who followed, was tempted to play with his hair even more.\nGu Jialing\u2019s body seemed to have grown a lot, but it was still not as big as Su Miaomiao\u2019s cat head. Of course, if he woke up, he could use a certain amount of spiritual power to turn into a big bird. The bigger he got, the more spiritual power he would consume. It could be said that any demon who wanted to go against the realm of cultivation to enlarge the size of the original body was very extravagant at the cost of continuous consumption of spiritual power.\n\u201cIf the Taoist master didn\u2019t smash the demons\u2019 cores of the fox and the python, I could have had one!\u201d Jumping to Gu Jialing\u2019s side, Su Miaomiao said to Xie Jingyuan resentfully.\nThe demon\u2019s core was useless to human cultivation, so when Xie Jingyuan dealt with evil demons, he would never show mercy, and strive to shatter it with one blow, so as to avoid future troubles.\nThe reason why the other demon\u2019s core could be preserved was because he had exhausted his spiritual power at that time and couldn\u2019t take care of it.\nXie Jingyuan looked at Su Miaomiao and explained, \u201cThe foundation of cultivation obtained by opportunism is not stable, and it will be useless in the long run. Diligent cultivation is the right way.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao put her head on her two front paws. Even though she was a cat, Xie Jingyuan could see disapproval on her face at that moment.\nWhat Xie Jingyuan said was the truth, but if she didn\u2019t believe it, there was nothing he could do.\nMost demons acted on instinct, and had never learned cultivation methods. It was not a one-day effort to change their ideas.\n\u201cI have something to do, you can stay here.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao silently watched him walk out of the room and close the door, and then heard his footsteps getting further away.\nThe temple had a lot of affairs to attend to, and with the pilgrims arriving one after another, it was very lively.\nShe lay next to Gu Jialing for a while, and then her eyes slowly shifted to Xu Shou. The big dog that had cultivated for more than two hundred years was twice the size of an ordinary dog, lying there like a big blanket.\nIn fact, Xu Shou didn\u2019t smell bad, it was just the smell of an ordinary dog, which at most was not what Su Miaomiao liked. But Xu Shou was always fierce toward her, so Su Miaomiao deliberately said that he smelled bad. She couldn\u2019t beat him and could only express her dissatisfaction with him in such a way.\nWhile Xu Shou was asleep, Su Miaomiao went to him quietly, and first poked his black back with her paw.\nWhen he didn\u2019t respond, she jumped up happily, walked from near his head to his butt, and then walked in the opposite direction.\nAfter walking for a while, Su Miaomiao lay down next to Xu Shou\u2019s tail, fiddling with it using her paws, and then took two bites.\nSuddenly, the big tail flicked high and she instinctively ran after it.\nThe next moment, she was thrown away.\nWhen Su Miaomiao raised her head, she met a fierce dog face, and shrank her body guiltily.\nXu Shou was eager to find the Taoist master, so he ignored her, glanced at the sleeping Gu Jialing, jumped out of bed, and left without looking back.\nFollowing the familiar smell, Xu Shou came to the place where the Taoist masters practiced rituals for their fellow disciples.\nXie Jingyuan presided over the ceremony as the host of the temple. He was wearing a black Taoist robe, with a cold and solemn expression.\nXu Shou walked in quietly, squatted at the side of the door, silently remembering the dead Taoist masters.\nXie Jingyuan saw him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At this time, Xu Shou also squatted down in front of the bed, staring at him with a pair of big and dark eyes.\nXie Jingyuan asked him, \u201cHow is your body?\u201d\nXu Shou said with a trace of worry, \u201cMy injuries are all healed, but my cultivation base has increased by nearly a hundred years.\u201d\nWith Xie Jingyuan\u2019s acquiescence, he had read a lot of Taoist scriptures and cultivation experience, and he knew that absorbing the demon\u2019s core was not a good thing. Even if those evil demons who cruelly kill and plunder demons\u2019 cores were not killed by the Taoist masters, they would not be able to practice well all the way. It was also difficult for them to die in peace.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cNo problem, I will find a way to help you stabilize that part of your cultivation.\u201d\nThere was a solution to everything, as long as there was perseverance.\nXu Shou breathed a sigh of relief.\nXie Jingyuan briefly explained to him what happened after the day of the fight, including the scene where Su Miaomiao sacrificed herself to protect him, making Xu Shou very surprised.\nXie Jingyuan said with the hope that Xu Shou could live in harmony with Su Miaomiao, \u201cAlthough she has some bad habits, she is pure and kind in nature. Not only did she want to save me, but she also fed you the eagle\u2019s core in time. She could have eaten it secretly and left while taking advantage of the chaos.\u201d\nXu Shou understood.\nDemons\u2019 cores could attract some evil demons, not to mention the thousand-year-old eagle\u2019s core. Su Miaomiao did not hesitate to share the core between him and Gu Jialing when faced with the fact that it was readily available to her, which showed that she was pure and kind.\nIt turned out that the Taoist master had seen through her essence long ago, so he didn\u2019t punish Su Miaomiao for her harmless petty theft incidents before.\n\u201cGu Jialing might be waking up too, so go and look after him.\u201d\nAfter explaining, Xie Jingyuan formed seals with both hands and began to practice healing.\nXu Shou turned around and left.\nOver there, Gu Jialing did indeed wake up.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he saw a huge cat\u2019s face almost pressed against his face.\n\u201cAh!\u201d The man\u2019s scream quickly penetrated the roof of Qingxu Temple, and it was so loud that all the Taoist masters and pilgrims in the temple heard it.\nXie Jingyuan, who was just about to practice, frowned.\nFortunately, Gu Jialing was a male, and if Su Miaomiao screamed like that, the pilgrims would have misunderstood.\nWhen Gu Jialing was about to call out for the second time, Su Miaomiao put her paw on his mouth.\nIn fright, Gu Jialing flapped his wings vigorously.\nIn the past, it took him a lot of effort to break free from Su Miaomiao\u2019s cat claws, but Gu Jialing, who had absorbed half of the demon\u2019s core and had a shallow foundation, was even better than Xu Shou before.\nHe only flopped a bit, and successfully flew out of the cat\u2019s claw, making Su Miaomiao feel upset.\nGu Jialing was so happy, and was about to fly out to show off, when a black shadow suddenly rushed in from the door, slapped him to the ground with one paw, and pressed him tightly.\nSeeing Xu Shou\u2019s wolf-dog face clearly, Gu Jialing was no longer afraid, but just felt wronged.\n\u201cIf you have something to say, just say it, why are you being like her?\u201d\nXu Shou reprimanded coldly, \u201cShut up.\u201d\nExcept for the Taoist masters, in the eyes of the common people, they were just three ordinary adopted animals, and they were spiritual at most.\nEvil demons caused harm to the world, and the common people were afraid of all demons. If they find out that the three of them were demons, they may not dare to visit that place in the future, and it would be difficult to believe in Qingxu Temple.\nGu Jialing couldn\u2019t beat Xu Shou, so he had to shut up obediently.\nXu Shou repeated the words of the Taoist master to make sure that Gu Jialing would not move again, and then let him go..\nGu Jialing flew into the air, flapped his wings, and shook off the dust all over his body.\nSu Miaomiao was still on the plank bed, originally in a squatting position, seeing Gu Jialing shaking there, she arched her body involuntarily.\nXu Shou suddenly coughed.\nGu Jialing raised his head and immediately noticed the danger, flew to Xu Shou\u2019s side and stared at Su Miaomiao warily.\nSu Miaomiao lay down as if nothing had happened.\nXu Shou looked at her and said coldly, \u201cThank you for the demon\u2019s core matter.\u201d\nThose words were so familiar, but Su Miaomiao asked in surprise, \u201cDo you want to give me a thank you gift too?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nGu Jialing spat, \u201cA gentleman repays with kindness, can you learn more from the Taoist master, cat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Taoist master, besides, he decided to give me a thank you gift first.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is he going to give you?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said triumphantly, \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful and comfortable nest.\u201d\nGu Jialing was not convinced and said, \u201cI helped him too, so he has to prepare a gift for me!\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhen Qingxu Temple\u2019s deceased Taoists were buried, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s injuries were completely healed.\nBefore dawn, he heard a bird chirping outside the window- it was Gu Jialing\u2019s voice.\nBecause he was too noisy, Su Miaomiao looked at him protestingly, her blue eyes full of displeasure.\nXie Jingyuan put her on the ground, and motioned her to hide under the bed with his eyes.\nWhen Su Miaomiao\u2019s tail was not visible under the bed, Xie Jingyuan opened the window and found Gu Jialing\u2019s figure on a branch.\nFacing Gu Jialing\u2019s original form, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s patience would be better, so he asked blankly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Why are you making noise early in the morning?\u201d\nGu Jialing flew over, landed on his window sill, and murmured in a low voice, \u201cMaster, Su Miaomiao said that today you will take her to the town to choose a new nest, and I will go too. I also want a thank you gift.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan asked, \u201cWhat type of nest do you want?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Even if she liked satin, with the quality of satin in the town, fifty was enough to buy a small piece of satin.\nGu Jialing said in satisfaction, \u201cThen when shall we set off?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the sky and said, \u201cAfter half an hour.\u201d\nGu Jialing flapped his wings and flew away. His nest was built on an old elm tree in the courtyard of the main hall of Qingxu Temple.\nAs soon as he left, Su Miaomiao came out from under the bed, and said disgustedly to the man by the window, \u201cWhat beautiful nest can you buy for fifty cents?\u201d\nShe lived in the world for a while when she was a child, so she knew the approximate price.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cIt\u2019s enough to buy you a beautiful futon.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said with her eyes wide open in disbelief, \u201cWhat I want is a new litter, not a futon! That futon is so hard, it\u2019s not comfortable to sleep on it!\u201d\nHer voice was so soft and sweet that people who could hear her would think that there was a beautiful woman acting like a baby in his room.\nXie Jingyuan closed the window and set up a sound-proof spiritual barrier.\nLooking at the cat squatting on the desk and facing him with her head up, Xie Jingyuan asked doubtfully, \u201cThen what kind of new litter do you want?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had been waiting for him to fulfill his promise, and said, \u201cI want a Babu bed like the one the rich ladies have, so that I can sleep in my original and human form. It should be made of Jichimu wood. It\u2019s better if the bed is inlaid with more jewels. Let\u2019s go to the silk and satin shop to pick out gauze curtains, including bedding and other fabrics.\u201d\nNot to mention jewelry, just a Babu bed made of Jichimu wood costs a hundred taels of silver. If one pursued carving craftsmanship, they may not be able to afford one thousand taels.\n(Babu bed is based on a canopy bed with a shallow corridor outside, like a house)\nAlthough Qingxu Temple was worshiped by the common people, it also needed to help the common people from time to time, and it only saved more than a dozen taels of silver.\nFacing Su Miaomiao\u2019s expectant eyes, Xie Jingyuan said bluntly, \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive, I don\u2019t have that much money.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao lowered her head in disappointment and said, \u201cBut I just want such a beautiful bed.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026You\u2019ve been sleeping on my bed lately, so you don\u2019t need that kind of bed.\u201d\n\u201cBut I can only lie under your bed during the day and sleep on the cold floor.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan thought of her figure basking in the sun and sleeping in every corner of the temple. She didn\u2019t even think the roof tiles were too cold, but she disliked the floor.\nHowever, no matter how expensive the request was, he personally promised to give her a beautiful new nest.\nAfter a moment of silence, Xie Jingyuan discussed with her, \u201cIf you are willing to wait, I can make you a small bed for you to sleep on.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t make a big one not because he was afraid of wasting time, but because such a luxurious bed was too eye-catching, and it looked like it would be for a woman to sleep on, so it was not appropriate to put it in the temple.\n\u201cDo you have the materials?\u201d\n\u201cNot currently, but I will collect them slowly. As long as I collect them, I will make a bed for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Jichimu wood?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive, there are some old elm trees in the back mountain, the patterns are similar to it, how about it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t think so, but Qingxu Temple was so poor, even Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room was extremely shabby, so she could only make do with it.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s pick out the bedding fabric and buy cotton today.\u201d\nIn the past, Su Miaomiao would put leaves in the nest, but since someone was there to support her needs, of course she would want soft white cotton on it.\nAfter Su Miaomiao left, Xie Jingyuan dug out his purse.\nEvery Taoist master had some private property, and Xie Jingyuan was no exception. However, the private money of the dignified Qingxu Temple\u2019s master was only a few taels of silver.\nAt dawn, Xuan Ling brought breakfast over.\nXu Shou followed his master to eat steamed buns, Su Miaomiao lazily nestled on the window sill, and Gu Jialing stood on the hanger, watching silently.\nXu Shou asked them, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat?\u201d\nAs far as he knew, neither the cat nor the bird went to the nearby forest for food in the previous two days.\nGu Jialing said, \u201cI heard that there is a restaurant in the town. I want to go there to eat meat.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao flicked her tail agreeingly.\nCultivating demons like them could last two or three days with a full meal. Although she was a little hungry at the moment, she wanted to save space in her stomach to eat meat.\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe three looked toward the door at the same time when they heard heavy footsteps from the corridor\u00a0\nThe person who came was Senior Sun, and the reason for his heavy footsteps was that he was holding in his arms a fox fur that had been dried and rolled into a bedding.\nThe original shape of the fox was not big, but the demon had been cultivating for thousands of years, so the fur could cover the main hall of Qingxu Temple evenly.\nAfter obtaining Xie Jingyuan\u2019s permission, Senior Sun pushed the door open and was used to the scene of the three demons surrounding Xie Jingyuan inside, so he said directly to the business, \u201cJingyuan, this time we have lost quite a lot in Qingxu Temple. It collapsed, and most of the roof of the main hall was destroyed, including many floors, doors and windows. We don\u2019t have much money, so I thought, since you are going down the mountain, you might as well go to Fucheng to sell this fur.\u201d\nThe eagle demon was smashed by the patriarch, and there was no use value to his body at all.\nThe whole body of the python could be used as medicine, and Senior Sun decided to use it to refine an elixir, which could be used by Taoist masters and ordinary people.\nOnly the fur of the nine-tailed fox was suitable for exchanging money.\nAs soon as Senior Sun\u2019s words fell, the eyes of Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing fell on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s face at the same time.\nXie Jingyuan first answered Senior Sun, \u201cSince we are going to Fucheng, it may take a month. During this time, I will trouble you to take care of the temple.\u201d\n\u201cYou can go down the mountain with peace of mind.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Humans love white fox furs the most. There are so many tails. Each of them can be used to make a big scarf, and each can be sold for hundreds of taels.\u201d\nIn fact, most of what she said was speculation. Xu Shou, who was well-informed, explained, \u201cThe fur of the thousand-year-old nine-tailed fox can deter ordinary evil spirits and prevent them from approaching. Therefore, if you meet a suitable buyer, a single tail can be sold for a thousand taels of silver.\u201d\nXu Shou was just explaining a fact in a serious manner, and when he finished speaking, Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing smiled.\nSeeing the look on their face, Xu Shou hurriedly said, \u201c\u2026The fur belongs to Qingxu Temple, so don\u2019t be greedy.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao jumped off the window sill, came to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, and kept rubbing her head on his calf, \u201cTaoist Master, you promised to give me a beautiful Babu bed.\u201d\nGu Jialing also flew onto the table, but was interrupted by Su Miaomiao, so he asked curiously, \u201cWhat kind of bed is the Babu bed?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao explained, \u201cA particularly beautiful bed that can be bought with a foxtail.\u201d\nGu Jialing said, \u201cThen I have to get a bed too. Now that the temple has empty rooms, you can give one to me.\u201d\nSeeing Su Miaomiao rubbing Taoist master\u2019s left leg with the top of her head, Gu Jialing flew down and rubbed his right leg with his head.\nThere were vacant rooms in the temple because people died. Xie Jingyuan was originally sullen because of Gu Jialing\u2019s unintentional words, but facing two round heads of different sizes, he couldn\u2019t get angry again.\nHe looked at Xu Shou and asked, \u201cDo you want to buy anything?\u201d\nXu Shou shook his head and said, \u201cBeing able to cultivate with the Taoist master is already a great fortune for me.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan decided to buy something for Xu Shou after selling the fur.\nAfter breakfast, Xie Jingyuan said goodbye to his fellow disciples, and took the three demons with him down the mountain.\nXu Shou patiently followed him, Gu Jialing was flying around in the sky, and Su Miaomiao was lazy, so she\u00a0 jumped onto Xu Shou\u2019s back secretly.\nFeeling her on his back, he bared his teeth at her, making her jump on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder in fright.\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too cold, I\u2019ll use my tail as a scarf for you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao watched Xie Jingyuan\u2019s expression, and wrapped her tail around while making excuses, not caring whether it was early summer and not cold at all.\nThe fluffy cat\u2019s tail made his neck itch a lot, so he said coldly, \u201cRemove your tail from my neck.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao quickly withdrew her tail. She decided to jump down, but after a while she found that he didn\u2019t push her away, so she clung to his shoulder with peace of mind.\nSeeing that, Xu Shou said, \u201cDon\u2019t be presumptuous with the Taoist master. Come down, I\u2019ll carry you on my back.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao turned around and pointed her round cat butt at him, which made Xu Shou look away resentfully.\nGu Jialing flew around in front and came back. Seeing that Su Miaomiao was so comfortable, he also wanted to land on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder. But before he got close, a section of the sword on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back suddenly appeared.\nGu Jialing had to stop and complain in mid-air, \u201cWhy is the Taoist master willing to carry her? Obviously I am lighter than her.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cYou are too noisy.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter descending the mountain, Chenxian Town was five miles away.\nXie Jingyuan was going to rent a carriage, and let the three demons stay where they were and guard the fur. But Su Miaomiao said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with the Taoist master.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the cat on his shoulder, and said, \u201cYou must not talk after entering the town.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded, as she didn\u2019t like to talk anyway.\nGu Jialing, who was about to ask to go with him, listened, and swallowed the words directly. For him, it was better to kill him than to silence him.\nAs for Xu Shou, he knew that his appearance would easily scare some people, so he would never make such unreasonable demands.\nJust like that, Xie Jingyuan left behind the dog and the bird, and led Su Miaomiao to the town.\nGu Jialing stood on the branch, looked at their backs, and said to Xu Shou, \u201cI still think that the Taoist master treats Su Miaomiao better.\u201d\nXu Shou lowered his ears, as he was too lazy to listen.\nIn the town, almost all the people there recognized Xie Jingyuan, and greeted him warmly when they saw him.\n\u201cIs the Taoist master here to buy something?\u201d\n\u201cWhy did the Taoist master bring the cat out? This cat is so obedient!\u201d\n\u201cThe Taoist master\u2019s cat is so beautiful, can I pet it?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at the little girl who was talking, tilted her head, and whispered into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s ear, \u201cI just live in Qingxu Temple. I\u2019m not your cat. I don\u2019t want her to pet me.\u201d\nHer cat fur rubbed against Xie Jingyuan\u2019s neck, and when she spoke in such a soft voice, Xie Jingyuan felt a strange throbbing that penetrated the skin and reached the bone marrow.\nHe gave an absent-minded \u201chmm\u201d.\nSatisfied, Su Miaomiao was about to shrink her head when she suddenly saw a steamed stuffed bun store that sold meat stuffed ones, which smelled delicious.\nShe continued to whisper to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, I want to eat meat buns.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan subconsciously walked over and said, \u201cI want six meat buns, divided into three portions.\u201d\n\u201cMeat buns?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe stall owner asked as he thought that the Taoist masters of Qingxu Temple didn\u2019t eat meat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Just as he lowered his head to look into Xu Shou\u2019s eyes, he suddenly raised his eyelids, and the big black dog eyes startled him.\nHis eyes lit up, and he flew back to the branch to look in the direction of the town, and sure enough, he saw a carriage slowly driving toward that side.\nXu Shou thought to himself that apart from having children, there was nothing in that world that Taoist masters couldn\u2019t do.\nThe wheels were rolling, and the carriage finally stopped in front of the two demons.\nThere was a rich merchant in Chenxian Town who once received the favor of Qingxu Temple. Xie Jingyuan borrowed the carriage from that rich merchant.\nThe wealthy businessman was very generous. He lent out his newly bought carriage, and even replaced the brocade cushion inside with a new one.\nBefore Xie Jingyuan got out of the carriage, Gu Jialing flew in from the side of the curtain, and saw that Su Miaomiao inside had turned into a human figure, wearing a fairy-like white dress and sitting on the main seat. There was a large bowl in her hand which contained a bunch of snacks, including beef jerky, dried fish, melon seeds, walnuts, candied fruit, etc. The aroma of various foods filled the place.\nGu Jialing was furious, and while turning into a human, he glared at Su Miaomiao and said, \u201cI knew that you guys should have eaten something good!\u201d\nWith that said, Gu Jialing was about to snatch the big bowl from Su Miaomiao\u2019s hands.\nSu Miaomiao held the bowl in one hand, and gently raised the other hand, showing her sharp nails toward him.\nAlthough Gu Jialing had a high level of cultivation, he had a kind of fear of cats and tigers from the bottom of his heart, so he couldn\u2019t help but pause.\nXie Jingyuan suddenly opened the curtain, and gave the two of them a cold look, \u201cNo fighting or making noise.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao obediently stopped, picked up a small dried fish and took a bite.\nXie Jinghyuan gave Xu Shou the buns. But when the dog smelled the meat, he refused to take them no matter what.\nXie Jingyuan persuaded him, \u201cEat, you don\u2019t have to strictly abide by the precepts in the temple after you go down the mountain.\u201d\nOnly then did Xu Shou transform into a strong man in black, and took the two meat buns with both hands.\nSu Miaomiao and Gu Jialing were both people who liked beauty, and the clothes they transformed into were exquisite silks and satins that even excellent embroiderers in the world may not be able to weave them.\nXu Shou may have lived in the village for a long time, and the villagers all wore common clothes, so his transformed clothes were ordinary.\nXie Jingyuan said to the three demons, \u201cTo go to Fucheng, we will pass many places. Do you want to keep your original form, or turn into a human? No matter what, once you choose, you can not change it, so as not to attract suspicion.\u201d\nIn the human world, demons were like mice crossing the street. Everyone shouted and beat them, but they were more scared than mice.\nXu Shou said, \u201cI will pretend to be the coachman and guard.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought that there must be more restaurants and gourmet food in Fucheng, so for the convenience of eating, of course, she had to use a human form.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cAlright, you two will pretend to be a pair of rich siblings. I was entrusted by you to hunt down this fox, and now I will escort you to Fucheng to sell it. When people ask me on the way, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at Gu Jialing and said with disgust, \u201cI don\u2019t have such an ugly brother.\u201d\nGu Jialing said in disgust as well, \u201cI don\u2019t have an ugly sister like you either!\u201d\nXu Shou recalled their habits, and suddenly felt that they were siblings\u00a0 who had been separated for many years.\n\u201cTaoist Master, you can get in the carriage too, I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d\nWhen Xie Jingyuan glanced inside,\u00a0 Gu Jialing immediately looked at Su Miaomiao and said, \u201cThe Taoist master is about to get in the carriage, why don\u2019t you give up the main seat?\u201d\nInside the carriage, on the northside was a narrow couch that could accommodate Su Miaomiao to sleep with her legs curled up. At that moment, she was leaning on one head with her back and her legs resting comfortably on it.\nOn the left side of the main seat was a side seat that could accommodate two people sitting side by side, and on the right side was a five-three-story mahogany cabinet to store the necessary items in the carriage.\nSu Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan questioningly, \u201cDoes the Taoist master want to sit by my side?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes and said, \u201cNo need.\u201d\nWith that said, Xie Jingyuan got into the carriage and sat cross-legged with his back against the mahogany cabinet.\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while, and leaned in another direction, so that her upper body was very close to Xie Jingyuan.\nHe glanced at the hem of her skirt, and moved toward the door.\nGu Jialing gloated, \u201cLook, the Taoist master is smelling like a cat.\u201d\nUpon hearing that, Su Miaomiao threw melon seeds at him.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s brows were slightly frowned, and he made a rule, \u201cFirstly, no noise is allowed in the carriage and secondly, no fighting is allowed. Those who break the law will have to enter the spirit animal bag.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao didn\u2019t dare to throw melon seeds anymore, and Gu Jialing didn\u2019t dare to make noise anymore.\nXie Jingyuan instructed Xu Shou and then closed his eyes and started practicing.\nSu Miaomiao and Gu Jialing concentrated on eating their respective snacks. Su Miaomiao was alright, but not being able to talk would kill Gu Jialing. After holding back for a while, he got out and sat outside chatting with Xu Shou.\nBut there was only a door panel between the inside and outside of the carriage, so he could hear it from inside.\nNoticing that Xie Jingyuan was frowning deeply, Su Miaomiao knew that he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and said, \u201cTaoist Master, you can create an enchantment, I\u2019m going to sleep later.\u201d\nNot hearing any movement from Xie Jingyuan, Xu Shou\u2019s voice came in, \u201cDo it, Taoist Master. I will take good care of him.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan did it at that moment.\nOnce the barrier was cast, the interior of the carriage seemed to form a space of its own, which isolated Gu Jialing\u2019s noise and rolling wheels.\nXie Jingyuan sat quietly again, the only sound in the carriage was the sound of Su Miaomiao peeling melon seeds.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Because she had nothing to do, she wanted to sleep. But she knew she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable sleeping there.\u00a0\nShe turned over twice, and when she faced Xie Jingyuan again, she quietly transformed back into a white cat, and skillfully landed on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s leg.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe opened his eyes, frowned and looked at the cat below, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that you can\u2019t change casually on the road?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s round cat head was resting on his leg, and she said as she glanced at him guiltily, \u201cI have changed in the carriage, so no one saw. When I get out of the carriage later, I will change back.\u201d\n\u201cThen you go to the couch.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too hard and uncomfortable.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan wanted to say more, but Su Miaomiao shrank her head, and her whole body shrank into a furry ball in the hollow of his leg.\nXie Jingyuan knew he could lift her, but as long as he started cultivating again, she would definitely come back.\nXie Jingyuan could only acquiesce.\nOutside the carriage, Gu Jialing ate enough snacks and lay down. Sleeping was cultivation, so he didn\u2019t care about the comfort of the \u201cnest\u201d.\nXu Shou drove the carriage silently.\nSometimes the carriage passed by crowded places, and sometimes by the secluded official road among the green hills.\nIf ordinary people were to walk that way, they might encounter some small demons, but there was a thousand-year-old nine-tailed fox fur in their carriage, and the little demons would hide after smelling it.\nAt noon, when Xu Shou saw a small town, he stopped the carriage.\nXie Jingyuan immediately ended his cultivation, looked outside, lifted the sound barrier, and said to Xu Shou, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the town for dinner.\u201d\nXu Shou continued to set off toward the town.\nGu Jialing was sleeping soundly, his face hidden in Xu Shou\u2019s figure.\nInside the carriage, Xie Jingyuan looked at the white cat in his arms, and said via voice transmission, \u201cWe are about to get off the carriage.\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao heard it, she just remembered \u201cget off the car and change into a human being\u201d, and forgot where she was at the moment.\nWithout a thought, she directly changed from a cat curled up in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s lap to a girl in white clothes.\nXie Jingyuan was unprepared. His head was lowered as he was looking at the cat, so he was\u00a0 suddenly hit by her head, and he subconsciously dodged back.\nSu Miaomiao, who had become a human, also felt that.\nWhen she just woke up, she felt lazy all over, with her arms around Xie Jingyuan\u2019s neck, she just wanted to sleep on his shoulder for a while.\nXie Jingyuan was overwhelmed. He had never been that close to a young woman.\nIn other words, since his grandmother passed away, no woman could approach him. If not for some female pilgrims who would come to the temple for help, Xie Jingyuan would not have come into contact with any women.\nThe banshee he had seen, all of them died under his sword.\nTherefore, whether human or demon, Su Miaomiao was the first person of the opposite sex who could lean on him like that.\nAlmost instinctively, Xie Jingyuan restored the barrier, fearing that Xu Shou and Gu Jialing would misunderstand.\nWith no further worries, Xie Jingyuan grabbed the corner of the cabinet with both hands, tilted his head back as much as possible, and yelled at Su Miaomiao in a cold voice, \u201cGo down.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao opened her eyes in a daze, and saw an \u201cAdam\u2019s Apple\u201d rolling up and down.\nPerhaps before her head started to work, Su Miaomiao had already rushed over, opened her peach-colored lips, and lightly bit the \u201csmall ball\u201d with the tip of her teeth.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s already stiff body was frozen.\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s attention was distracted by something under, she slightly distanced herself from Xie Jingyuan, looked down, but unfortunately her sight was covered by layers of fabrics.\nAt that moment, Xie Jingyuan suddenly pinched her waist, and put her on the main couch rudely, and then he resumed his cross-legged sitting posture, with his eyes downcast, and warned her, \u201cDon\u2019t do such a\u00a0 move in my arms in the future.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was completely awake, and hummed obediently.\nXie Jingyuan continued, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything offensive to me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was stunned for a moment before she understood the meaning of \u201coffend\u201d. She looked at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple, and couldn\u2019t help but argue, \u201cTaoist Master, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose, but\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan interrupted coldly, \u201cNo arguing.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao curled her lips and said nothing.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone what happened just now.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan continued to meditate for a while before releasing the barrier.\nGu Jialing also woke up, rubbed his eyes and got into the carriage, and saw the Taoist master still sitting in the previous position, and Su Miaomiao looking out of the window, with a strange look on her face.\nThe town ahead was more prosperous than Chenxian Town, and one could tell the difference by looking at the clothes of the people on the road.\nXu Shou parked the carriage in front of a restaurant, and a waiter from the restaurant helped to lead the horse. As for the fur, Xu Shou used a spell and hid it in a cage under the carriage, so he was at ease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Seeing an empty table next to him, he immediately sat down. While looking at the dishes served by diners on the surrounding tables, he swallowed and said, \u201cStop talking nonsense, and quickly serve your restaurant\u2019s signature dishes!\u201d\nJust as the guy was about to answer, Xie Jingyuan called him, glanced at the wooden menu board hanging on the side wall of the restaurant, and ordered, \u201cA piece of braised fish, a piece of roast chicken, a piece of braised pork, a piece of tofu mixed with green onions, and ten steamed buns.\u201d\nThe clerk looked at the Taoist robe on him, and then at Su Miaomiao and the other two.\nSu Miaomiao did not dare to refute the Taoist master, and Gu Jialing also had no guts.\nThe man understood, and ran to the kitchen, and came over with a pot of tea.\nAfter the group of four sat down, Gu Jialing whispered, \u201cWe come out rarely, but the Taoist master is still so stingy.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao understood the situation better, and explained, \u201cThe Taoist master has no money now, and when we sell the fur, we can order a few more dishes.\u201d\nA fox tail could be sold for a thousand taels of silver. The old fox had nine tails, plus such a big body. In short, Su Miaomiao was full of hope for her future life.\nGu Jialing had nothing to say, and looked around, staring at the delicious dishes on other tables.\nXu Shou said via voice transmission, \u201cPay attention to your manners, how can you act like a pampered rich man this way?\u201d\nHe looked like a beggar who had just entered the city and put on brocade clothes, with only the face of a nobleman.\nCompared with him, Su Miaomiao was considered steady. She didn\u2019t look around, but she propped her hand on the table, resting her chin lazily.\nThe cat and bird had no choice but to imitate him and sit upright.\nThe steamed buns were ready-made, and the waiter brought over two large plates of ten in total, plus a plate of tofu mixed with shallots.\nThe waiter knew how to read words and expressions, and directly put the mixed tofu in front of Xie Jingyuan, the only Taoist master.\nGu Jialing said to the waiter, \u201cGive us a plate too\u2026\u201d\nBefore he could finish speaking, Xu Shou stepped on him under the table.\nGu Jialing waved his hand with a painful expression, who made Qingxugu Temple so poor?!\nAfter the waiter left, Xu Shou said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cTaoist Master, let\u2019s eat first.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan raised his eyes and met the three pairs of eyes that paid attention to him.\nHe took a sip of tea and said lightly, \u201cStart eating.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao and Gu Jialing picked up their chopsticks almost at the same time.\nIn the blink of an eye, a large piece of braised fish was divided into two halves by the two of them, and they put it directly into their own bowls.\nWhen others saw those two who were dressed so richly eating that way, they felt weird.\nXie Jingyuan picked Xu Shou\u2019s chopsticks, picked up a few pieces of braised pork for him, and then started to eat himself.\nHalfway through the meal, the roasted chicken also came.\nSu Miaomiao grabbed a big chicken leg, Gu Jialing was a step slower, but that time Xu Shou was not polite, and grabbed the other chicken leg and put it in his bowl.\nThe three demons ate quickly, before Xie Jingyuan had finished eating all the tofu, Gu Jialing and Su Miaomiao stared at him with unsatisfied eyes.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s money would still be reserved for the next half month\u2019s board and lodging, and he couldn\u2019t afford such a waste. So he just pretended not to see it.\nAt that time, there was a sudden commotion from upstairs, and soon, seven or eight strong young servants walked down the stairs swaggeringly, surrounding a rich man.\nThe young man from the rich family was only in his early twenties, but he was tall and round.\nSuddenly, he stopped and tilted his head forward, as if he had been captivated by something.\nThe boys followed the young master\u2019s line of sight and took a breath at the same time.\nBecause they were ugly, Su Miaomiao looked away with little interest.\nBut the young master of the rich family seemed to have lost his soul, and ran down, running all the way to Su Miaomiao\u2019s side.\n\u201cThe four of you are outsiders, why did you come to our town?\u201d The young master of the rich family looked at Su Miaomiao lewdly and chatted absently.\nGu Jialing looked at the purse at his waist. Seeing the bulging shape on the surface, he determined that there must be a lot of money there.\nXu Shou stared at the rich young master displeasedly, and said coldly, \u201cGet lost!\u201d\nHe had seen dandies and local hooligans as many as eight hundred, and he could tell at a glance what kind of stupid idea that person had.\nThe rich young master let out a sneer, then stepped back, and those servants rushed over immediately.\nSu Miaomiao wanted to make a move, but Xie Jingyuan stopped her, so she had to sit still.\nGu Jialing and Xu Shou left the table respectively. Xu Shou carried six of them away, and Gu Jialing carried the rich young master in one hand, and the two servants in the other, and left the restaurant successively.\nFighting in the restaurant would damage the tables and chairs, but there was no scruple on the street.\nXu Shou beat up every servant who was helping the tyrant.\nGu Jialing focused on taking care of the rich young master.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, don\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d Xu Shou reminded him in time.\nOnly then did Gu Jialing let go, and kicked Master Zhutou.\nMaster Zhutou got up from the ground, ran away and threatened angrily, \u201cDon\u2019t leave if you have the guts, wait here!\u201d\nGu Jialing snorted, rubbed his hands, and then asked Xu Shou, \u201cThey just came to strike up a conversation, why did you tell them that?\u201d\nWhen the other party wanted to hit them, Gu Jialing would fight back, but he didn\u2019t quite understand the reason for the fight.\nXu Shou gave him a complicated look, and explained, \u201cHe wants to do to Su Miaomiao what that crow did to you.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nIt turned out that humans also had that kind of scum!\nWhen the two went back in, the diners in the lobby persuaded them, \u201cYou guys go, he\u2019s a well-known bully in our town, and when he goes home and calls more thugs over, you won\u2019t be able to leave!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He frowned and said, \u201cMaster, they are here again, this time there are more than thirty people.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao put down the big bowl of snacks and thought that it was her turn this time.\nAs a result, Xie Jingyuan suddenly picked up the long sword placed on the mahogany cabinet.\nThe next moment, the long sword came out of its sheath and flew out of the carriage.\nGu Jialing immediately raised the curtain, and Su Miaomiao watched the long sword flying straight toward the thugs, like a ray of light flying over the heads of the front thugs on horseback.\nThe long sword hit the opponent\u2019s bun, and the strong wind moved his hair and scattered toward the rushing thugs.\nAccompanied by the horrified screams of the riders, the thugs hurriedly stopped.\nThe long sword flew around the crowd, then flew back to the carriage, and sank into the scabbard with a \u201cclang\u201d.\nThe thugs did not chase after them, and the carriage gradually moved away from the town.\n\u201cThe Taoist master is really powerful!\u201d Gu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s sword with lingering fear, and felt that even if he flew out, at that speed, it could cut off his wings.\nXie Jingyuan closed his eyes, not wanting to pay attention to him.\nGu Jialing was quiet for a while, then suddenly smiled, took out something from his sleeve, and waved it in front of Su Miaomiao\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cThat fat man\u2019s purse!\u201d\nAs he said that, he opened the money bag, and poured out two large ingots of five taels, a few pieces of silver, a few pieces of gold, and even a silver bill of fifty taels.\n\u201cThis is enough for us to have a good meal on the road,\u201d Gu Jialing said triumphantly.\nSu Miaomiao rolled her eyes, put her legs away, patted her side, and asked him to come and sit.\nGu Jialing liked that very much, so he sat down and said domineeringly, \u201cPeel me a few melon seeds, and I will treat you to meat.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was afraid that he would renege on the debt, so she asked Gu Jialing to give her an ingot first.\nThe bank note was the most valuable, and Gu Jialing generously gave her one.\nSu Miaomiao was very happy and hid the ingot, but stopped peeling the seeds for him because she had already allocated half of the seat to him.\nNo matter how rich Gu Jialing was, he couldn\u2019t tolerate that kind of deceit, and rushed over to snatch the ingots back.\nSu Miaomiao threw down the big bowl, turned around and dodged down, and hid directly by Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side, pushing his shoulder so that she could hide behind.\nXie Jingyuan frowned, and looked at Gu Jialing coldly.\nGu Jialing had no choice but to retreat to his seat, and then asked Xie Jingyuan to uphold justice for him.\n\u201cIf you promise to peel the melon seeds, you have to peel the melon seeds. If you don\u2019t want to peel the melon seeds, return the money to me!\u201d\n\u201cThe five taels of ingot will give you half of the seat and peeling melon seeds is another price.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes, which was almost equivalent to approving Su Miaomiao\u2019s words.\nGu Jialing laughed angrily, raised his legs, and occupied the main couch.\nSu Miaomiao was upset, she walked over, trying to pull Gu Jialing up.\nGu Jialing\u2019s cultivation had increased, so how could Su Miaomiao be able to pull him?\nShe thought for a while, and suddenly sat on Gu Jialing\u2019s stomach, using him as a cushion.\nGu Jialing rolled his eyes, sat up suddenly and hugged Su Miaomiao, stroking her arms, trying to snatch the ingot back.\nBefore Su Miaomiao had time to react, Xie Jingyuan slapped Gu Jialing\u2019s back with his palm, making him directly turn into his original form.\nThe blue bird was knocked out, fell on the couch, swayed again, caught a glimpse of the familiar money bag from the corner of his eye, staggered toward it, and spread his wings to cover it.\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to steal it, Xie Jingyuan looked over and said sternly, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble anymore.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao withdrew her hand embarrassingly.\nXie Jingyuan grabbed Gu Jialing with one hand, who grabbed the money bag, and moved them to the side seat together.\nGu Jialing protested in a low voice, \u201cWhat did the Taoist Master move me for? I bought the seat with five taels of silver.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan asked, \u201cWhere did the money come from?\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201cSteal\u2026\u201d\nHe shut his mouth tightly.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at Su Miaomiao, and said coldly, \u201cYou are not allowed to sit on him again in the future.\u201d\nHe was angry, so of course Su Miaomiao agreed.\nGu Jialing breathed a sigh of relief, the Taoist master had not been partial to her yet, and knew to protect him.\nAs the red sun slanted to the west, Gu Jialing poked his head out of the window and found a beautiful landscape outside.\nBut did Gu Jialing want a beautiful landscape? He wanted a town or county to eat delicious food.\nXu Shou said, \u201cThe horse has been walking for a day. I heard the sound of water ahead, so let\u2019s sleep here tonight.\u201d\nGu Jialing said, \u201cSleep here? Are you deliberately using this method to save money?\u201d\nPutting down the curtain, Gu Jialing retreated into the carriage, and looked resentfully at the Taoist master who was still meditating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I saw Xu Shou buy a lot of dry food when we passed by the market, and we can\u2019t even go to restaurants as the Taoist thinks we eat too much.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at Xie Jingyuan resentfully and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to pay the bill, you can tell me, I have money now.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said angrily, \u201cThen why do you still want the Taoist master to pay? If you had taken it out earlier, we wouldn\u2019t be sleeping out at night.\u201d\nThe carriage went for another quarter of an hour, and finally stopped at a side of the road. Below the official road was a rocky beach. A wide river was flowing slowly, and the setting sun was reflected on the water.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the surroundings, and said to Xu Shou, \u201cGo find something to eat.\u201d\nXu Shou changed back to his original shape, and rushed into the forest where the edge could not be seen at a glance like a gust of wind.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go too!\u201d Gu Jialing had been looking for a chance to test his current strength, but before Xie Jingyuan agreed, he had turned into a bird and chased after Xu Shou.\nSu Miaomiao was obviously not interested in hunting, so she walked to the river and looked at the water seriously.\nThe sunset was beautiful, and she stood facing the wind in a white dress with a fluttering skirt, much like a person in painting.\nThe next moment, the person in the painting looked toward a certain spot in the water, and a big fish was caught by an invisible force, and landed precisely beside Xie Jingyuan.\n\u201cTaoist Master, can you grill fish?\u201d Su Miaomiao asked expectantly.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nAfter getting a positive response, she happily grabbed three more.\nXie Jingyuan went to look for dry firewood, and then picked up some large stones to build a stove.\nWhen setting up the stove, he was taken aback when he head a sudden sound of splashing behind him. He\u00a0 turned around, and saw Su Miaomiao was already sitting in the water, with half of her shoulders exposed, as white as jade.\nXie Jingyuan immediately avoided looking at her, but when he turned his head back, the image was still lingering in his mind, and his breathing became chaotic.\nHe understood that reaction as anger.\nShe was a banshee, how could she bathe in front of him?!\nEven if he kept the etiquette and didn\u2019t watch, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing would come back at any time, didn\u2019t she care at all?\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Xie Jingyuan asked coldly.\nSu Miaomiao glanced at him and said with a smile, \u201cTaking a bath, the water is just warm, do you want to take a bath too? When it gets dark, the water will be cold.\u201d\nWhen she was in cat form, Su Miaomiao didn\u2019t like to get wet, but when she turned into human, taking a bath was quite comfortable.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cMen and women are different, even if you are a demon, you shouldn\u2019t take off your clothes in front of a man. Go ashore quickly.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had just entered the water. She was not willing to go up, so she looked at Xie Jingyuan\u2019s back, and snorted, \u201cThen I\u2019ll bathe in another place.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan still wanted to stop her, but he heard a strange sound. He hesitated and looked toward the river, but only had time to catch a glimpse of a white light fleeing upstream.\nThe person left, but Xie Jingyuan couldn\u2019t feel relieved.\nThere was no evil spirit around there, but if there were people passing by, wouldn\u2019t she be seen by all of them bathing in the river like that?\nMoreover there were Xu Shou and Gu Jialing who may return at any time.\nBefore the white light disappeared from sight, Xie Jingyuan made a move, chanted a mantra, and stretched out his hand toward Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao was still swimming happily in the water, when suddenly a strong force came from behind\u00a0\nThe world was spinning, and when she realized it, she had already fallen into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s hands, in her cat form.\nWith the back of her neck pinched by him, Su Miaomiao obediently remained motionless. But she looked at Xie Jingyuan innocently, and said, \u201cWhy did the Taoist master do that?\u201d\nHer fur was still wet and dripping water constantly.\nXie Jingyuan had seen some wild cats, they would become ugly after being wet by rain. But although her hair was wet and stuck to her body, she didn\u2019t look bad, and even the cat face added a bit of strange beauty.\nXie Jingyuan turned his eyes away. The reason couldn\u2019t be explained, so he directly set the rules for her, \u201cFrom now on, you are not allowed to reveal your body outdoors, unless it is in your original shape.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re also forbidden from having physical contact with men at will, including Gu Jialing and Xu Shou.\u201d\n\u201cIs doing so in the original form okay?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan thought about the scene of her patting Gu Jialing, and said, \u201cTry to avoid it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan thought of those two for then, and seeing that she was willing to cooperate, he bent down and put her on the ground.\nAs soon as Su Miaomiao touched the ground with her four paws, she shook her wet hair.\nWater droplets splashed everywhere, even on the Taoist master\u2019s face.\nXie Jingyuan turned around silently, wiped his face, and continued to set up the stove.\nSu Miaomiao shook her hair half dry, squatted on the big rocks where the sun was still shining, and squinted her eyes comfortably.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing were back, one was running on the ground and the other was flying in the sky.\nWhen Su Miaomiao heard the movement, she glanced at Gu Jialing, then at Xu Shou, and suddenly said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask what Xu Shou and Gu Jiangling did?\u201d\nXu Shou put the prey he brought to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s side. When he heard Su Miaomiao\u2019s complaint, the big dog showed a hint of confusion on his face.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t understand what Su Miaomiao meant either.\nShe stretched out her paw, pointed at the big wolf dog\u2019s abdomen and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for him to reveal his body, right?\u201d\nXu Shou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou immediately turned into a human form. His black clothes seemed to be tighter than before. His slightly dark face got reddened to the base of his neck. He wanted to explain something, but he didn\u2019t know how to say it.\nWho cared when they were in demon\u2019s form?\nBut at that moment, Su Miaomiao deliberately pointed it out, thinking that something was wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Although he was also a demon, he was fluffy and nothing could be seen.\nRecalling Su Miaomiao, who was usually in the form of a white cat, nothing seemed to be shown in that form, only Xu Shou was a bit special.\nMaybe, when they pass by the market, he could buy a few pieces of cloth and make a pair of pants for Xu Shou that he could wear.\nHe just didn\u2019t know how long Su Miaomiao had been paying attention to Xu Shou.\nXie Jingyuan stopped thinking about it, picked up the mountain rabbit and pheasant Xu Shou brought back, and the fish Su Miaomiao caught, and went to the river to clean them up.\n\u201cThe Taoist master knows how to do that?\u201d Gu Jialing turned into a young man and squatted aside to watch the excitement.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his head to clean the meat, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the cat licking her fur with her small tongue\u2026\nXie Jingyuan casually threw a fish to Gu Jialing and said, \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t want to learn!\nWhen night fell completely, Xie Jingyuan had already grilled two fish, and Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing were eating with relish, Xu Shou came back with a large bundle of dry firewood.\nWith Su Miaomiao\u2019s eyesight, she could tell at a glance that Xu Shou\u2019s face was still red.\nShe went to see Xie Jingyuan again, but was coldly warned by him.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t say anything, but she was very proud. The Taoist master set rules for her every day, but she found out that Xu Shou was the most indecent one.\nBut it was not Xu Shou\u2019s fault, the male demons in the forest were very careless, and Su Miaomiao had long since seen them.\nXie Jingyuan ate dry food, and handed the roasted rabbit meat sprinkled with seasonings to Xu Shou.\nHe took it and bit it very hard.\nGu Jialing retaliated, \u201cYou eat gently, it looks like you haven\u2019t eaten for a few days.\u201d\nWhen Xu Shou glanced at him, Gu Jialing was startled, and couldn\u2019t help shrinking toward Su Miaomiao, almost touching her shoulder.\nSeeing Xie Jingyuan looking over, Su Miaomiao immediately pushed Gu Jialing away in disgust, and quoted Xie Jingyuan\u2019s words,.\u201dMen and women should maintain a distance, stay away from me in the future.\u201d\nGu Jialing said angrily, \u201cI\u2019ll stay as far as I can, don\u2019t even think about playing with my feathers in the future!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao thought for a while and explained, \u201cI\u2019m talking about human form, if you become a bird, you can still touch me.\u201d\nOnly then was Gu Jialing satisfied.\nXu Shou thought about what Su Miaomiao said before and after, and suddenly realized that Su Miaomiao must have done something inappropriate when they left, and was reprimanded by the Taoist master, so she took it out on him.\nAfter trying to understand the reason, Xu Shou stopped digging into it.\n\u201cSpeaking of which, Taoist master\u2019s cooking is really good, even better than the ones made by the master chefs in restaurants.\u201d After eating the fish and pheasant, Gu Jialing lay on his back on the rocky beach, looking at the stars in the sky and savoring contentedly.\nSu Miaomiao nodded. If the Taoist master cooked food for them every day in the future, it wouldn\u2019t matter if they didn\u2019t go to restaurants.\nXu Shou tidied up the stone stove silently, lest the wind blow away the sparks and cause a wildfire, and Xie Jingyuan squatted by the river to wash his face.\nSuddenly, when he heard a splash, Xie Jingyuan froze, and then he looked up. It was Gu Jialing who jumped into the water, and he was still standing shamelessly.\nXie Jingyuan just slapped him out with his hand.\nThat was a move handed down by the patriarch, as long as the cultivation level was sufficient, any demon would show their original shape under that move.\nPoor Gu Jialing was about to splash water on his body, but then he turned into a little bird floating on the water.\nAfter regaining consciousness, Gu Jialing quickly flapped his wings and flew up, \u201cWhy did you hit me again?!\u201d\nXu Shou watched coldly, guessing the truth more, glanced at Su Miaomiao, and he explained the etiquette to Gu Jialing on his behalf.\nGu Jialing was convinced, and flew to a distance to take a bath.\nXu Shou also went to find a place to take a bath.\nSu Miaomiao nestled on the stone and asked Xie Jingyuan, \u201cWon\u2019t you bathe?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan turned his back to her and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go when they come back.\u201d\n\u201cYou can bathe here, there is no one here.\u201d\nWhen he remained silent, she suddenly understood, turned around and jumped into the carriage and said, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep now. Taoist master, please bathe.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at the carriage, picked up a big stone, and threw it into the middle of the river.\nThen, he saw that the curtains in the carriage raised automatically without wind, and two cat ears were first exposed, and then the familiar cat\u2019s head.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter bathing, Xie Jingyuan changed into a Taoist robe and walked back to the carriage. He hung the newly washed one beside the carriage.\nAlthough he knew spells, unless necessary, Xie Jingyuan would not waste his spiritual power on such trivial matters.\nAfter hanging it up, Xie Jingyuan lifted the curtain and saw Su Miaomiao nestled on the main couch and Gu Jialing sleeping on the side seat.\nWhen Su Miaomiao opened her eyes, Xie Jingyuan put down the curtain, walked to the rocky beach, and sat down beside Xu Shou.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201d Xie Jingyuan glanced at Xu Shou and asked.\nXie Jingyuan glanced casually, and found out that Xu Shou was wearing weird clothes, which just covered his waist and abdomen, but would not affect the free movement of his hind legs.\nXu Shou had black hair, and the outside of that robe was also black, so it was hard to distinguish without looking carefully.\nHe wanted to explain that Xu Shou didn\u2019t need to take Su Miaomiao\u2019s words to heart, but thinking that she might look at it, he thought it would be good for Xu Shou to dress like that.\nXu Shou wanted to cultivate while sleeping, and when he was sure that the Taoist master had noticed his clothes, he lay down and closed his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She also said, \u201cI will pretend to be the Taoist master\u2019s cat, and you can book one less room, saving money.\u201d\nGu Jialing asked, \u201cThen you won\u2019t have dinner?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t eat.\u201d\nAt noon, the Taoist master made grilled fish, and she was very full.\nGu Jialing didn\u2019t care much, he just wanted to see if there was anything delicious in the inn, so he left the carriage first with an umbrella.\nXie Jingyuan looked at the cat in his arms. The cat\u2019s fur was white and soft, it was really not good to get wet by the rain.\nSo, he hugged Su Miaomiao in one hand and got out of the carriage with an umbrella in the other one.\nThe rain dripped down the umbrella surface, and Su Miaomiao hid in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms more.\nXie Jingyuan strode into the inn, and asked the storekeeper for two rooms, one for him, and one for Xu Shou and Gu Jialing.\nAfter a simple dinner, it was completely dark, and the three of them and one cat went back to their room.\nXie Jingyuan booked the most common room, which was even more shabby than the room he had in Qingxu Temple. The bed looked very old, and the only set of table and chair seemed to have been used for an unknown number of years.\nGu Jialing\u2019s complaints came from next door, and soon he paid out of his own pocket to get a better room. After a while, Xu Shou went to the new room to find Gu Jialing.\nXie Jingyuan shook his head and let them be.\nHe sat by the window, looking out at the street.\nHe watched so intently that it aroused Su Miaomiao\u2019s curiosity. She also jumped over, squatted in front of him, and raised her head to look out.\nThere were not many pedestrians on the street, and everyone hated the heavy rain. They either held umbrellas or covered their heads with their sleeves, and ran very fast.\nSeeing those people splashing clusters of water seemed to be really fun.\nAnd Xie Jingyuan\u2019s gaze had long unconsciously lowered and landed on her cat\u2019s head.\nIt was undeniable that Su Miaomiao was a very beautiful white cat, and she was still very clean. Other demons had some smell, but Su Miaomiao exuded a warm and sunny one, especially in that form. In the miserable and rainy weather, just being close to her would make people feel soothed.\nIf she was just an ordinary beautiful white cat, Xie Jingyuan might not be able to resist touching her head.\nAs soon as the idea came up, Su Miaomiao\u2019s head moved.\nXie Jingyuan followed her gaze and saw a young Taoist guarding a young woman, rushing into the inn in a hurry.\nXie Jingyuan didn\u2019t care.\nBut soon, he heard footsteps in the corridor, and the inn clerk led the two people to the room next to them.\n\u201cExcuse me, do you two want to eat?\u201d\n\u201cThank you, please bring us two buckets of hot water first.\u201d\n\u201cOkay!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan continued to watch the rain, but Su Miaomiao was attracted by the conversation next door, she heard the young woman calling the Taoist \u201cMaster\u201d!\nWith the cat\u2019s head up, Su Miaomiao asked Xie Jingyuan in a low voice, \u201cMaster, can Taoist masters get married?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her and explained in a low voice, \u201cDifferent Taoist temples have different precepts. Most of the Taoist masters in the world do not prescribe marriage.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao asked, \u201cCan you get married?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked out the window and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nIn the beginning, Qingxu Temple did not abstain from marriage. Later, a master of the temple was hurt by love. In order to prevent future generations of disciples from repeating the same mistake, he changed the rules.\nOf course, he didn\u2019t explain that to Su Miaomiao.\nAfter waiting, the inn clerk brought up hot water, gave two buckets to the neighbor, and gave one bucket to Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan thanked him, came in with a bucket, raised his head, and met Su Miaomiao\u2019s eyes.\nSu Miaomiao swore, \u201cI really won\u2019t peek again this time!\u201d\nHe directly put her on the bed, and without knowing what spell Xie Jingyuan had cast, her field of vision was limited inside the bed. The outside was a vast expanse of whiteness, like clouds and fog.\nUnable to see, Su Miaomiao simply curled up to sleep.\nXie Jingyuan waited until the clerk took away the bucket, then he lifted the blindfold on the bed, put on a gray Taoist robe, and sat cross-legged on the bed.\nSu Miaomiao burrowed into the hollow of his legs, and sniffed with her cat nose against his waist. The smell of autumn dew on the Taoist master just after taking a bath became even better.\nXie Jingyuan ignored her and meditated.\nIt was raining heavily, and the people in the inn slept very early. At about three o\u2019clock, Su Miaomiao was awakened by the sound from the next door.\nShe heard the young woman\u2019s low moans, and the young Taoist\u2019s heavy breathing.\nBefore she could hear more, Xie Jingyuan raised his hand, making those voices and the sound of rain outside the window disappear.\nSu Miaomiao raised her head and met his cold face. Afterward, Xie Jingyuan kicked her and forbade her to sleep on him again.\nSu Miaomiao could only curl up behind him.\nShe slept soundly, but for the first time Xie Jingyuan was restless.\nHe knew that it was easy to go crazy if he cultivated forcefully under such circumstances.\nUnable to cultivate, sitting would only waste energy in vain. After listening to the rain for a quarter of an hour, Xie Jingyuan gave up and lay down with his clothes on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "231": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-231/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as the Taoist master moved, Su Miaomiao also moved. Her head slid up against his waist, and finally nestled in the gap between Xie Jingyuan\u2019s shoulder and the pillow.\nNot long after, Xie Jingyuan heard her purr, which was shallow and long.\nListening to it, Xie Jingyuan also fell asleep.\nFrom the age of ten, Xie Jingyuan used to cultivate at night, he no longer slept, and rarely dreamed.\nBut that night, he actually had a dream.\nHe dreamed that he returned to that river again, and saw Su Miaomiao bathing in the water again.\nIt was just that in the dream, he didn\u2019t stop Su Miaomiao, just watched her slowly turn around in the water, like a water lily under the moon.\nIt was beautiful, but he resisted such a picture.\nSo the dream changed, and he and Su Miaomiao went back to the inn, back to the time when she asked him if he could get married.\nHe actually said yes.\nSu Miaomiao was very happy, turned into her human form, and sat on him with her hands around his neck, \u201cThen you should marry me!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan woke up suddenly.\nThe place was pitch black, Xie Jingyuan heard his rapid breathing, as if something was pressing him, so he reached out and touched a fluffy cat.\nXie Jingyuan looked at his chest, only to find Su Miaomiao really lying there. Probably angry that he disturbed her sleep, she moved slightly to avoid his hand.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe stared blankly, still having those messy dreams in his mind.\nAfter an unknown amount of time, his breathing calmed down, Xie Jingyuan put Su Miaomiao aside first, and then quietly got out of bed.\nThe sound of the rain resumed, and the couple next door also fell asleep.\nXie Jingyuan walked to the window.\nThe wind was cool, taking away the impetuousness in his heart, so he meditated there until dawn.\nWhen the rain had stopped, he washed his face, and carried the cat downstairs to have dinner. Not long after he sat down, Xu Shou also pushed Gu Jialing downstairs.\nThe three of them had breakfast, and Su Miaomiao sat on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s lap, not interested in a simple breakfast.\nAt that time, the couple next door came downstairs. The Taoist was fine. The young woman changed into a colorful skirt, her complexion was rosy, and the corners of her eyes were full of charm.\nWhen the two looked at each other, their eyes were full of affection, and their manners were also very intimate.\nGu Jialing stared intently.\nXu Shou turned his head around, not allowing him to talk nonsense.\nAfter the four got into the carriage, Su Miaomiao explained to Gu Jialing, \u201cThose two are husband and wife, and I heard them consummate their marriage last night.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan was just explaining the route to Xu Shou, and he just listened to her talking by the side.\nHis body was slightly stiff, but Gu Jialing was very interested, \u201cWhat is consummation?\u201d\nGu Jialing, who had lived in the mountains and forests since he could remember, really had no understanding of human affairs.\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to speak, the Taoist master looked over coldly.\nSu Miaomiao said helplessly, \u201cThe Taoist master won\u2019t let me tell, you should go and see for yourself if you have a chance.\u201d\n\u201cWhere should I go?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan interrupted, \u201cShut up.\u201d\nAfraid of his palm technique, Gu Jialing got out of the carriage to ask Xu Shou.\nXu Shou explained, \u201cIt\u2019s similar to the crow\u2019s intentions toward you, but the husband and wife are in love with each other.\u201d\nGu Jialing: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nHe digested his words for a while, got inside the carriage again, and then asked, \u201cTaoist Master, can Taoist masters get married?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan closed his eyes, so Su Miaomiao explained to him.\nGu Jialing gained insight, glanced at Xie Jingyuan, and said solemnly, \u201cAlthough you will not get married, but with your looks, there is no guarantee that there will be no female bullies who want to use force on you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded in agreement. If the Taoist master was not too powerful, the Taoist master would have been forced by her as early as the night they met in the brothel.\nGu Jialing said in determination, \u201cWe must protect the Taoist master!\u201d\nHe hated female bullies the most!\nSu Miaomiao still nodded.\nThe Taoist master was the man she liked, but she didn\u2019t succeed. Other women and banshees shouldn\u2019t even think about it!\nAfter driving for half a month, the group of four finally arrived at Fucheng.\nFucheng was already prosperous, but since the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, it was crowded with vendors, big and small, making it dizzying.\nXu Shou found an inn, and Xie Jingyuan paid the rent for three days first. The fox fur had to be sold to rich customers, so it probably wouldn\u2019t be sold out so quickly.\nDiagonally opposite the inn was a big restaurant. With Gu Jialing\u2019s treat, the four of them went over to have a big meal.\n\u201cTaoist Master, how do we sell fox fur?\u201d Xu Shou asked about the business.\nXie Jingyuan had a plan long ago, he said, \u201cWe need to go to the busiest street in the city, find a long pole to put on the fox fur, and soon the news will spread through the mouth.\u201d\nIf he was the only one on that trip, Xie Jingyuan might go directly to the prefecture and sell it for a few hundred taels.\nBut Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing had already figured out how to spend thousands of taels of silver, so Xie Jingyuan could only sell the fox fur at the highest price possible.\nThat area was rich in bamboo, and Xu Shou quickly bought a long straight bamboo pole with more than ten cents.\nXie Jingyuan found a suitable place to set up a stall, bought a table and four chairs, put the fox fur behind him on the bamboo pole, and placed a wooden sign next to it with the price of the fox fur written on it. The four of them just sat and waited.\nSuch a big and white fur quickly attracted countless people.\n\u201cOne thousand taels of silver for a tail?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan closed his eyes as if he was resting, Xu Shou and Su Miaomiao looked at Gu Jialing together.\nGu Jialing stood up and fought against the Confucian scholars with his tongue. While exaggerating the power of it as if that fox fur was the only treasure in the world, he scolded those rude people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "232": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-232/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe common people kept coming. After watching, there would be a new wave. No matter how expensive the fox fur was, such a large fox fur was indeed rare in the world. Many people who stayed at home heard about it and rushed over in a hurry, as if not being able to see the fox fur was a big loss.\nThere were ordinary people in Fucheng, as well as officials, and rich people.\nThe fox fur had only been hung for an hour, and those people sent their subordinates to confirm whether the news was true.\nAfter confirming it, buyers came to bargain in front of the group of four one after another.\nIn the name of dedicating the fox fur to the Emperor, the magistrate hoped that Xie Jingyuan would lower the price.\nHowever, in that world where demons and beasts were rampant, the \u201cEmperor\u201d could also frighten the common people, but cultivators who could subdue demons could refuse. On the contrary, the imperial court used many means to win over cultivators to work for them.\nStill without the need for Xie Jingyuan\u2019s opening his mouth, Gu Jialing gave the magistrate a scolding, to either hand over the money, or walk away without thinking about other ideas.\nThe magistrate was still hesitating. Several local rich merchants came, some wanted to buy one fox tail, some wanted to buy two, and they argued endlessly over it.\nWhen Gu Jialing was about to be annoyed by their noise, a high-pitched voice suddenly sounded, \u201cZiyun Palace will buy the whole fox fur for six thousand taels!\u201d\nAs soon as those words came, the people watching the excitement all around took a breath.\nXie Jingyuan finally opened his eyes.\nThe people consciously made way for the visitors, and soon, two young men in white robes appeared in front of the group of four.\nTwo Taoist masters, one of them was tall, so handsome that everyone forgot to look at his companion.\nThis handsome man was also looking at the four people in front of him, and his eyes lingered on Su Miaomiao\u2019s face for a while. He cupped his hands and said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cI am Xiao Heng from Ziyun Palace, can I dare to ask for the friend\u2019s name?\u201d\nThey were demons, and maybe they didn\u2019t even know or have any interest in the royal surnames in the world, but they would discuss with each other and pass on information about the powerful cultivators in the world.\nThe forest where Su Miaomiao lived was relatively close to Qingxu, so she knew that there was another temple, and Xie Guanzhu of the Temple was also a person that couldn\u2019t be messed with.\nIn addition to Qingxu Temple, there were only some temples that were famous all over the world, so that little demons in remote areas like them had heard of them.\nSu Miaomiao had heard other demons mention that Ziyun Palace was the number one Taoist temple in the world. Its master was the Emperor\u2019s own national teacher, and the number of demons who died under the gate of Ziyun Palace was even more innumerable.\nSu Miaomiao became a little more wary of Xiao Heng.\nXie Jingyuan usually lived in Qingxu Temple, away from the world of mortals, and was obsessed with cultivation. Most of the time, he went to subdue demons, and he had little interest in the world.\n\u201cThank you, I am Jing Yuan, a poor Taoist, I am a master of the concept of Qingxu,\u201d Xie Jingyuan got up and returned the salute.\nGu Jialing looked at the brocade Taoist robe on Xiao Heng\u2019s body, and then at the cloth Taoist robe on Xie Jingyuan\u2019s body, and felt the words he said described him well.\nXiao Heng had never heard of Qingxu, so he exchanged a glance with his fellow junior brother calmly, and found that the younger brother\u2019s eyes were also blank.\nBut Xie Jingyuan\u2019s ability to hunt that thousand-year-old nine-tailed fox was enough to prove his strength.\nThere were many cultivators, some pursued fame and were admired by others, but there were also those who didn\u2019t like fame and wealth, but were willing to remain unknown despite their great talents.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s Brother Xie. I don\u2019t know where Brother Xie got this fox fur from?\u201d Xiao Heng raised his head and looked at the fox fur again.\nThe nine-tailed fox came to the door by herself, but Xie Jingyuan didn\u2019t tell the truth, only told him about the place where he killed the fox.\nXiao Heng nodded, and said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cI want to buy this fox fur, but I just came out, and I don\u2019t have much money with me. I need to send someone back to get it, and he will be back in about three days. I wonder if Brother Xie can wait for me for three days.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at the other rich merchants, and seeing that none of them seemed to want to compete with Ziyun Palace for the fox fur, he agreed.\nXiao Heng said enthusiastically, \u201cI have rented a house here, and there are still a few vacant guest rooms in it. If you don\u2019t mind, Brother Xie, can you come and stay with me for the next three days, so that I can entertain you for a while? We can also discuss cultivation.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan refused, \u201cThank you for your kindness, but I have already booked an inn.\u201d\nHis expression was cold and his words were concise. He looked like someone who didn\u2019t like to socialize. Xiao Heng smiled wittily, took off the jade pendant, handed it to Xie Jingyuan, and said, \u201cThis is the token of the deal between you and me. If I go back on my word, the jade pendant will be yours.\u201d\nThe jade pendant was white, and it looked expensive at first glance.\nXie Jingyuan refused, \u201cNo need, I will wait at the inn for three days. If you don\u2019t come after three days, we will find another buyer.\u201d\nXu Shou nodded, and removed the fox fur hanging on the bamboo pole.\nXie Jingyuan walked in front, followed by the three demons, and left.\nWhen the surroundings became quiet, Xie Jingyuan glanced at Su Miaomiao.\nSu Miaomiao held Gu Jialing\u2019s arm. She had always been timid. The prestige of \u201cZiyun Palace\u201d was more intimidating than Qingxu Temple. Since Xiao Heng appeared, Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help leaning against Gu Jialing.\nIn fact, she wanted to rely more on the Taoist master, but he asked her to play the role of a rich lady. How could he let her get close to him in front of the common people?\nGu Jialing was more courageous than her. When the Taoist master looked over, he asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you accept that person\u2019s invitation? He looked like a rich man, and so the house he lived in must be very good. Let\u2019s move there and save money.\u201d\nXu Shou hummed, \u201cHow can the Taoist master repay him for staying there for three days?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at Gu Jialing\u2019s arm that was still held by Su Miaomiao, and said expressionlessly, \u201cEven brothers and sisters don\u2019t behave like that.\u201d\nOnly then did Su Miaomiao let go of Gu Jialing\u2019s arm, and after looking back, she approached Xie Jingyuan, and asked worriedly, \u201cMaster, can you tell whether Xiao Heng\u2019s cultivation is better than yours? Will he find out we are demons, and call someone to catch us?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan saw fear and anxiety in those clear eyes.\nIt turned out that she was holding Gu Jialing\u2019s arm like that because she was afraid.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t be able to discover your identities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Looking at the Taoist master, I can tell he is two or three years older than him.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c,\u2026\u201d\nXu Shou still answered Gu Jialing, \u201cThe Taoist master is a genius, and Senior Sun and Senior Wang are not as good as the Taoist master after decades of practice. How can Xiao Heng be the Taoist master\u2019s opponent?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if Xiao Heng is also a heavenly genius? He also came from a Taoist temple, maybe their ancestors are more powerful than Qingxu Temple\u2019s ancestors!\u201d\nAs soon as he finished speaking, there was a rumbling thunder in the sky.\nThe four of them raised their heads, and saw that the sky was still clear there, but there was a large dark cloud billowing in the distance.\nIn fact, around the Dragon Boat Festival was the season when the weather was changeable, but Gu Jialing just said something bad about the patriarch, and there was thunder over there\u2026\nThinking that a phantom left by the patriarch could kill a thousand-year-old demon, cold sweat broke out from Gu Jialing\u2019s back, and he bowed to the cloud repeatedly, \u201cPatriarch, calm down! You are the most powerful, and your disciples are also the best! They are stronger than that Ziyun Palace!\u201d\nSeeing that thundercloud was still approaching there at a speed visible to the naked eyes, Xie Jingyuan frowned and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the inn first.\u201d\nNeedless to say, Gu Jialing had already started running, and Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t turn into a cat on the street, but she could run very fast.\nJust when the four of them saw the signboard of the inn, the raindrops began to fall.\nApart from the sword, Xie Jingyuan also carried an umbrella on his back.\nHe went down the mountain to eliminate demons, those were necessary things, and he was used to bringing them with him.\nWhen the first drop of rain hit his face, Xie Jingyuan glanced at Su Miaomiao, and immediately took the umbrella and opened it.\nSeeing that, Su Miaomiao turned around and ran over. Xie Jingyuan was about to give her the umbrella, but Su Miaomiao went around behind him and jumped onto his back.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou carry me on your back, I don\u2019t want to get my shoes wet.\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao hooked his neck, and raised her feet forward, Xie Jingyuan saw a pair of small and delicate clean embroidered shoes with white soles protruding from the bottom.\nAfraid that he would not understand, Su Miaomiao explained in his ear, \u201cthat\u2019s an illusion.\u201d\nThe two beautiful feet suddenly turned into a pair of cat\u2019s claws.\nAfter a pause, Xie Jingyuan asked her to hold the umbrella, and he supported her knees with both hands.\nThe rain came quickly and densely. Fortunately, there was no wind, and an umbrella was enough to protect the two of them.\nThe people on both sides were running wildly, and it was inconvenient for Xie Jingyuan to run because he was carrying her on his back.\nXie Jingyuan had a different feeling. The dress she transformed with cat fur was soft and seemed to be layered, but as it was attached to his back like that, it seemed to be nothing.\nWithout clothes to block, there was only\u2026\nWhat he saw by the river and what he saw in his dream came to his mind again.\n\u201cWhy are the Taoist master\u2019s ears red?\u201d Su Miaomiao quickly noticed the red ears in front of her.\n\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s just running.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at the people passing by. Everyone was in a hurry and ran very fast, but she didn\u2019t see anyone with red ears.\nWas the Taoist master\u2019s cultivation in vain?\nBut she had personally seen the Taoist master deal with three thousand-year-old demons at the same time with his strength.\nIt was so strange that Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t figure it out.\nHowever, she was more concerned about another matter, and asked him in a low voice, \u201cTaoist Master, who is stronger between you and Xiao Heng?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan asked back, \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\u201cIf the Taoist master is powerful, I won\u2019t have to be afraid of him. If he is more powerful, I have to leave quickly to avoid being caught by him.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cHe is not as good as me.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Doesn\u2019t it mean that you can\u2019t compare without a fight?\u201d\nIf he knew that earlier, why should he be humble?!\nThe torrential rain was pouring, and the entrance of the inn was full of footprints of others, mixed with some yellow mud.\nXie Jingyuan walked all the way to the stairs leading to the second floor before letting Su Miaomiao down.\nThere were a lot of people gathered in the lobby to shelter from the rain, and they didn\u2019t think the scene was too strange. After all, half of the Taoist masters could get married, not to mention the beauty, could get a cold in the rain.\nThrough the open window, the damp rain came in, which was very cool.\nGu Jialing walked back and forth excitedly, \u201cAfter three days, 60,000 taels will be in hand!\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at them, and said, \u201cThat day\u2019s battle, you also contributed to the protection of the temple. I will give you 10,000 taels each, and the rest will be used for the temple. How about it?\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at Su Miaomiao. She had no objection, so he agreed.\nSu Miaomiao said something else, \u201cI have 10,000 taels, but the Taoist master promised to give me a gift, so I have to get the money from the Taoist master.\u201d\nGu Jialing agreed, \u201cYes, yes, this cannot be confused with that.\u201d\nXu Shou interfered, \u201cIt\u2019s useless for me to ask for money, and I\u2019m willing to hand it over to the Taoist master for distribution.\u201d\nGu Jialing finally knew why Xu Shou didn\u2019t bully others, but he liked Su Miaomiao even more. Hearing Xu Shou\u2019s words, he was deliberately against him.\nAfter discussing the distribution of money, Gu Jialing started talking about Xiao Heng again, and said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cAfter we get the money, you should hurry to the silk store to make two new Taoist robes. You are obviously better looking than Xiao Heng.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded agreeingly. The Taoist master\u2019s robe was rough, and it was not comfortable to rub against it.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her and said, \u201cFor a cultivator, clothing that could cover the body is enough.\u201d\nHe liked to be shabby, so Gu Jialing went to discuss with Su Miaomiao about going to the silk and satin store to buy satin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Otherwise, what will we be doing these three days?\u201d\nThe rainstorm came and went quickly, and the next morning, the Qingshi street was washed clean by the heavy rain, and the weather was cooler, just right for going out.\nGu Jialing asked the innkeeper which was the best silk and satin store in the city, so he and Su Miaomiao led the way.\nBefore they reached the store, Su Miaomiao found a jewelry store, left Gu Jialing and walked there.\nFortunately, he was also interested in jewelry, so he continued to follow.\nXu Shou looked at the Taoist master next to him.\nXie Jingyuan still had that clear and cold expression, as if he didn\u2019t care about everything around him, and seemed to be full of patience for everything.\nSeeing Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing\u2019s outstanding looks and well-dressed clothes, the storekeeper, thinking that a rich customer was coming, displayed all kinds of good products with a smile on his face.\nGu Jialing liked sapphires, but Su Miaomiao liked almost everything.\n\u201cYou two, do you want to wrap these up?\u201d The shopkeeper blushed with excitement.\nJust as Su Miaomiao was about to nod, Xu Shou coughed behind her.\nSu Miaomiao thought of the money, and said helplessly to the storekeeper, \u201cWe have no money now, but we can buy it in three days, is that okay?\u201d\nThe storekeeper\u2019s smile froze.\nThere were also two rich ladies in the store, with their own maids.\nOriginally, the store keeper was entertaining them warmly, but because Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing seemed richer, he walked away, which made the two girls very unhappy.\nSo when Su Miaomiao said that she had no money, the rich ladies looked at each other and burst out laughing. They walked over there and took out the jewelry that Su Miaomiao liked.\nSu Miaomiao reached out to snatch the jewelry back, and said unhappily, \u201cThis is what I want to buy.\u201d\nMiss Fu said, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you pay for them? Storekeeper, tell me, who are you selling this jewelry to?\u201d\nOf course he wanted to collect the money, but before he could open his mouth, a gold ingot suddenly flew from the door onto the counter.\nThe storekeeper raised his head in shock, and Su Miaomiao and others also looked toward the door.\nXiao Heng, who was dressed in a white Taoist robe, stepped in, with a handsome face and a dignified demeanor. With his arrival, the inside of the store seemed to be somewhat brighter.\nThe two rich ladies subconsciously looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s appearance was even more eye-catching than Xiao Heng\u2019s, but it was a pity that he had the attitude of a Taoist who rejected others thousands of miles away. When everyone saw him, they were in awe.\nXiao Heng was different, he had a gentle expression. He looked more like a son of a noble family, and it was easier to arouse the love of young girls.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my friend saw these first, please excuse me, young ladies,\u201d Xiao Heng walked to Su Miaomiao and said to the two young ladies.\nThe ladies blushed, saluted shyly, returned to their original place, and kept a distance to watch.\nXiao Heng smiled at Su Miaomiao, and said to Xie Jingyuan, \u201cWhat a coincidence, Brother Xie, are you here to shop too?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan nodded.\nXu Shou was dressed like a guard. Xiao Heng ignored him, and cupped his hands toward Gu Jialing and Su Miaomiao, \u201cYesterday, I was in too much of a hurry, so I haven\u2019t asked your names yet.\u201d\nGu Jialing received Xu Shou\u2019s gesture, smiled, and introduced himself, \u201cMy name is Su Jialing, and this is my younger sister.\u201d\nSince they wanted to play brother and sister, of course they needed a surname.\nXiao Heng saluted, \u201cSo it\u2019s Young Master Su, Miss Su.\u201d\nGu Jialing returned the salute in a dignified manner, but Su Miaomiao just stood beside him, looking at Xiao Heng curiously.\nThe Taoist master repeatedly assured her that he was better than Xiao Heng, so Su Miaomiao was not afraid of him.\nFacing her beautiful eyes, Xiao Heng smiled even more tenderly, \u201cWho are you two to Brother Xie?\u201d\nAfter Gu Jialing told her the planned story, Xiao Heng said, \u201cIt turns out that the fox fur belongs to Mr. Su and Miss Su. If so, don\u2019t I owe you sixty thousand taels?\u201d\nHearing money, Gu Jialing smiled even brighter.\nXiao Heng looked at the jewelry on the counter, and said to Su Miaomiao, \u201cThe fox fur is extremely precious. Thanks to your willingness to sell it to me, these jewelry can be considered as a gift from me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao\u2019s eyes lit up, but Xie Jingyuan said, \u201cWe sell, and you pay money, so there is no need to spend any more.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of thoughtfulness, Brother Xie is too out of touch to say that.\u201d\nAs he said that, he picked up a hairpin studded with rubies on the counter, handed it to Su Miaomiao, and said, \u201cYoung lady, you have good eyes, this hairpin is really suitable for you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao looked at the hairpin and sniffed at the same time, and then looked at Xiao Heng, her gaze became a little fond.\nXie Jingyuan asked Xu Shou via voice transmission, \u201cWhat kind of smell does Xiao Heng have?\u201d\nXu Shou had already smelled it, and replied to him, \u201cThere is a smell of a tree.\u201d\n\u201cWhat tree?\u201d\n\u201cJichimu wood.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSu Miaomiao asked him for a Babu bed as a gift, and asked for it to be made of Jichimu wood, because she liked it.\nWhen he was communicating with Xu Shou, Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing had already happily accepted the gifts from Xiao Heng.\nSu Miaomiao immediately put the hairpin on her head.\n\u201cThere are many good places in the city, how about I take you there?\u201d Xiao Heng said politely.\nGu Jialing readily agreed.\nXiao Heng was very good at receiving people. He could talk to Gu Jialing and buy things that Su Miaomiao liked at any time. It didn\u2019t take long for Xu Shou to hold a bunch of things in his arms\u2014after all, the character he played was the rich siblings\u2019 guard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Until they had a big meal in the restaurant at night, and then sent them back to the inn himself, did Xiao Heng leave gracefully.\nAs night fell, after taking a shower, Gu Jialing fell asleep on the bed, and Xu Shou lay on the ground in his original body, with his ears drooping.\nAt a certain moment, his ears twitched, as he heard a cat sneak out of the room, scratching the door at the Taoist master\u2019s side.\nThinking of the master\u2019s indulgence to her, Xu Shou ignored it.\nIn another room, Xie Jingyuan was sitting by the window, facing the night.\nWhen he heard the door being gently scratched, Xie Jingyuan used a spell to open the door without looking back.\nAfter Su Miaomiao got in, the door was closed again. Xie Jingyuan glanced at her, set up a sound-proof enchantment, and asked lightly, \u201cI told you, you can\u2019t change at will when you get here.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao came over, jumped into his arms lightly, curled up into a ball habitually, and lazily said, \u201cI like to sleep with you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan looked at her closed eyes and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou smell good, and I sleep better next to you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cReally? What kind of smell?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao felt that the Taoist master that night was a bit strange. In the past, he cherished words like gold and rarely chatted with her.\nBut the Taoist master wanted to talk, so Su Miaomiao yawned, raised her head and rubbed against his chest, sniffed and said, \u201cIt is the smell of autumn dew.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan frowned. She could not only smell a unique fragrance of natural vegetation from him, but autumn dew. At the corner of the opposite street, a tuft of weeds grew, with a dewdrop hanging on the blade of grass.\nXie Jingyuan stretched out his hand, and the dew quietly flew to his palm. He sniffed it while Su Miaomiao was not paying attention, but found nothing.\n\u201cLooking at you today, it seems that you are no longer afraid of Xiao Heng, why?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said with a smile, \u201cBecause he was very kind to us, bought me a bunch of things, and he smells good too.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan knowingly asked, \u201cWhat kind of smell?\u201d\n\u201cJichimu wood.\u201d\n\u201cSince he treats you well, why don\u2019t you go to him?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao paused, then raised her head blankly.\nXie Jingyuan seemed to smile at her, and looked very kind as he said, \u201cQingxu Temple is just a small remote temple. If you follow him, you may be able to live a better life.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao blinked.\nXie Jingyuan touched her cat\u2019s head for the first time, and said in a low voice, \u201cI think he seems to like you very much, even if he comes to know that you are a demon, he might not care.\u201d\nHis touch was very light, even more comfortable than that little Taoist Xuan Ling\u2019s.\nSu Miaomiao narrowed her eyes and said without thinking, \u201cNo, I will follow you.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan paused for a while before asking, \u201cWhy? He has more money than me.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao lay in his arms and licked his hand, \u201cBecause I like you better.\u201d\nHe was good-looking and smelled good. He could kill her, but he was willing to take her home.\nIn the mountains and forests before, Su Miaomiao was often frightened, but on the road when Xie Jingyuan locked her in the spirit animal bag, smelling him, she slept very peacefully.\nShe was a wild cat, and the Taoist master was the first person who was willing to support her.\nSu Miaomiao liked the Taoist master and Qingxu Temple, so she didn\u2019t care about Ziyun Palace no matter how good it was, as for Xiao Heng, he was just a well-known rich traveler.\nShe also liked butterflies passing by, but that didn\u2019t mean she would move to the butterfly\u2019s house.\nXie Jingyuan\u2019s ears were filled with the phrase \u201clike\u201d that she blurted out casually.\nDid she know what liking was?\nIt wasn\u2019t until Su Miaomiao licked his palm, which was wet and warm, that Xie Jingyuan suddenly came back to his senses.\nHe pressed Su Miaomiao\u2019s cat head.\nSu Miaomiao thought that the Taoist master was going to touch her again, so she waited comfortably.\nMaybe it was because of observing too much, but Xie Jingyuan actually understood what she meant, paused, and continued.\nWhile he was touching her, Su Miaomiao suddenly turned into a human, threw herself into his arms with a smile, and hugged his neck with both hands.\nXie Jingyuan froze.\nSu Miaomiao breathed hot air in his ear, laughed and said, \u201cTaoist Master, it\u2019s so itchy.\nShe couldn\u2019t control it.\nWhile Su Miaomiao was hanging on him, Xie Jingyuan did nothing.\nShe pressed against him softly, the feeling was warm and fulfilling.\nIt had been twenty years since Xie Jingyuan could remember, Su Miaomiao was the first one who liked to pounce on him, and was able to pounce on him smoothly\u2026\nFor a moment, Xie Jingyuan was unable to define her identity.\nHowever, it didn\u2019t seem to matter what she was.\nXie Jingyuan just needed to make sure that she had no intention of leaving Qingxu Temple to seek refuge with another person.\nThe night was dark, and the wooden window next to them had been quietly closed at some point, and the room was quiet.\nSu Miaomiao originally went to find the Taoist master to sleep. So as she calmed down, she slowly closed her eyes, turned her face to him, and exhaled lightly.\nIt wasn\u2019t until she fell asleep that Xie Jingyuan lowered his head, looked at her for a while, and pressed his palm against her back.\nXie Jingyuan picked her up and walked to the bed. After sitting down, he put Su Miaomiao near his leg. And when she found a familiar and comfortable sleeping position, Xie Jingyuan also started to cultivate.\nIn Ziyun Palace where Xiao Heng lived, Taoist masters could get married.\nXiao Heng was the grandson of the temple master of Ziyun Palace, and also a leader of that generation. He was extremely talented and handsome, and there were countless women who wanted to marry him.\nXiao Heng had never been attracted to any woman, until this time when he was traveling and met Su Miaomiao.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "236": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-236/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSu Miaomiao had a beauty that Xiao Heng had never seen before, but what attracted Xiao Heng more was her clear and pure eyes. It was also the lazy charm that Su Miaomiao exuded at any time. In short, when Xiao Heng first saw Su Miaomiao, his heart skipped a beat. After being with her all day, Xiao Heng couldn\u2019t wait to keep Su Miaomiao by his side.\nThat morning, before the inn opened, Xiao Heng came over early and waited.\nCoincidentally, when Xie Jingyuan opened the window, he saw the young Taoist master standing downstairs.\nBefore Xiao Heng raised his head, Xie Jingyuan left the window, and on his bed, Su Miaomiao was still sleeping soundly.\nXie Jingyuan closed the door, went downstairs, quickly brought two buckets of water up, one bucket was given to Xu Shou and Gu Jialing in the other room, and the other bucket was taken to his own room.\nAt that time, Su Miaomiao was still in her original form, and her tail was held in her arms.\nXie Jingyuan wet a handkerchief and wiped his face with his back to her.\nHearing the sound of water, Su Miaomiao stretched her waist, opened her eyes, and glanced at the Taoist master.\n\u201cDo you want to wash your face?\u201d Xie Jingyuan looked back at her and asked.\nSu Miaomiao nodded, and immediately, the cat on the bed disappeared, and there was a beauty with loose long hair, her cheeks were flushed from sleep, and her eyes remained blurred.\nXie Jingyuan sat by the window, facing the street. From the corner of his eye, he watched her every move. After she wiped her face, she took out a bronze mirror. Then she put the pile of jewelry that she bought all on the bed, and began to pick and choose.\n\u201cTaoist Master, does this hairpin look good, or this one?\u201d\nAfter choosing two, Su Miaomiao held a ruby \u200b\u200bhairpin in one hand and a white pearl in the other, and asked Xie Jingyuan to help her make up her mind.\n\u201cThe white one.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao said with a smile, \u201cI also think the white one looks better.\u201d\nShe combed her hair in a beautiful bun first, then put the pearl hairpin in her hair, and put a pair of white jade bracelets on her wrists.\nWhile there was no one in the corridor, Su Miaomiao quietly went back to her room, and when Gu Jialing was woken up by Xu Shou, the four went downstairs together.\nSeeing Xiao Heng, Gu Jialing greeted in surprise.\nXie Jingyuan glanced at him silently.\nGu Jialing couldn\u2019t understand the complicated eyes of the master of Qingxu Temple, he had already walked to Xiao Heng\u2019s side, and put his arms around him enthusiastically.\nThose demons were more sensitive to smell, and Xiao Heng\u2019s Jichimu wood smell among humans was the kind that was very easy to please demons.\nXiao Heng glanced at Su Miaomiao, and explained with a smile, \u201cThere is a restaurant that makes delicious breakfast in Fucheng, I would like to invite the four of you to go and have a taste.\u201d\nHearing that, Gu Jialing and Su Miaomiao were very happy.\nXu Shou looked at the Taoist master, as he felt that he didn\u2019t like Xiao Heng very much. The Taoist master\u2019s face was uglier than usual. Although it was difficult for people who were not familiar with him to detect it, Xu Shou saw he had less of unhappiness, and was still immortal and extraordinary.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Seeing that Su Miaomiao was leaving with Xiao Heng, Xie Jingyuan whispered to Xu Shou.\nXiao Heng was very familiar with the delicious food and interesting places in Fucheng. With him as a guide, Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing had a great time.\nAt night, Xie Jingyuan left Xu Shou to protect the two, and he left for two hours.\nAt noon on the third day, Xiao Heng came again to the restaurant.\nWhen Xu Shou carried the roll of fox fur on his back over, Xiao Heng also took out 60,000 taels of silver notes as promised.\nGu Jialing took it first, and then handed over a few bank notes to Xie Jingyuan for safekeeping on the grounds that it would be more reassuring to leave them with him.\nWhen the deal was fulfilled, everyone concentrated on eating and drinking.\nWhen Xiao Heng asked Gu Jialing what plans he had next, Gu Jialing subconsciously looked at Xie Jingyuan who said, \u201cMaster Su told me that he wants them to go back as soon as possible after selling the fur.\u201d\nXiao Heng smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s natural. Brother Su and Miss Su are young, and their father is definitely worried about them staying outside for too long. However, there will be a gourmet feast in the capital. Famous chefs from all over the world will gather. If Brother Su and Miss Su are interested, you can write a letter and ask Brother Xie to take it back for you, and then I will escort you to the capital. You can taste all the delicious food in the world, and you can also visit the jewelry stores in the capital. It\u2019s comparable to an underworld city.\u201d\nHearing the tempting offer, Gu Jialing and Su Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan together.\nXie Jingyuan sent a voice transmission to the two demons, \u201cThere are so many cultivators in the capital, it\u2019s hard to guarantee that no one will recognize your identities.\u201d\nUpon hearing that, the siblings rejected Xiao Heng\u2019s invitation.\nFood and jewelry were not as important as their lives.\nXiao Heng could vaguely see that both the brother and sister seemed to listen to Xie Jingyuan\u2019s words, so he continued to invite Xie Jingyuan, using the name of Ziyun Palace. He felt that a Taoist master like Xie Jingyuan, who was not well-known, wouldn\u2019t refuse to go to Ziyun Palace.\nXie Jingyuan said coldly, \u201cNo need.\u201d\nThen he took out two banknotes and two bills from his sleeve, and put them in front of Xiao Heng, and then said, \u201cBrother Xiao, you have entertained us for the past three days, and it cost a lot of money, please check to see if there are any omissions.\u201d\nXiao Heng took the notes and the bill in a daze, and then looked at the bill. It actually listed every expense he paid for the Su siblings including even the bowl of cold drink he bought for Su Miaomiao.\u00a0\nXiao Heng asked, \u201cThis is?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cMaster Su has said that we can\u2019t accept people\u2019s kindness for nothing.\u201d\nWhen they were talking, Gu Jialing took the bill, and looked at it with Su Miaomiao, and asked Xie Jingyuan in shock, \u201cTaoist Master, how did you get so much money?\u201d\nThe shabbiness and stinginess of the Taoist master were obvious to all, but he suddenly took out a few hundred taels?\nXie Jingyuan explained, \u201cYesterday, I passed by a house with a demonic aura inside. These are my rewards for eliminating the demon for them.\u201d\nXiao Heng: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhat evil spirit? He had been walking with the four of them. Xie Jingyuan could detect the evil spirit, but he didn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t it prove that his cultivation level was not as good as Xie Jingyuan\u2019s?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "237": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-237/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Xie Jingyuan hunted the fox, because he was too young, Xiao Heng subconsciously thought that he might have used some kind of trickery. So if the cultivation level of the two was compared, even Xie Jingyuan would not be as good as him.\nHe was thinking a lot, and Gu Jialing had already asked, \u201cWhat demon?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a 500-year-old scorpion.\u201d\nFive hundred years!\nNot to mention Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing, even Xu Shou could only escape for his life against the five-hundred-year-old poisonous scorpion! However, because the three of them knew that Xie Jingyuan had the strength to deal with three thousand-year-old demons at the same time, so when the Taoist master said that the poisonous scorpion was only five hundred years old, the three demons showed an expression that said that it was indeed easy for the Taoist master to subdue that demon.\nWhen Xiao Heng saw it, his heart sank quickly.\nHe could feel that Xie Jingyuan also had some thoughts on Su Miaomiao, but he boasted of his background and financial resources, and so did not regard Xie Jingyuan as an opponent. Judging by the smiling faces that Su Miaomiao gave him in the past two days, it was much more than Xie Jingyuan.\nBut was Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cultivation so high?\n\u201cWe stayed in Fucheng for so long and it\u2019s time for us to go on the road.\u201d\nAfter paying off the money, Xie Jingyuan left his seat and bid farewell to Xiao Heng with a distant expression.\nAs soon as he left, the three others followed.\nIt took Xiao Heng a while to realize that even if Xie Jingyuan liked Su Miaomiao, the Taoist masters of Qingxu Temple couldn\u2019t get married, which was revealed to him by Mr. Su himself.\nThinking so, Xiao Heng chased after Su Miaomiao in a hurry, and stopped her when she was about to step into the carriage.\nXu Shou was already sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. Seeing him, he frowned, jumped down, and stood with Xie Jingyuan and Gu Jialing, staring at Xiao Heng vigilantly.\nThe parting was imminent, but Xiao Heng couldn\u2019t care about it anymore, he looked at Gu Jialing, then cast his eyes on Su Miaomiao. His fair and handsome face quickly turned red.\nSu Miaomiao looked at him in astonishment.\nThe last time she saw that face, it was the Taoist with red ears!\nXiao Heng had already opened his mouth, but because he was nervous, he stuttered a little, \u201cMiss Su, I, I, I liked you the first time I saw you. If you want, I want to go back with you and personally propose marriage to your father.\u201d\nAs soon as those words came out, Gu Jialing opened his mouth in shock, and Xu Shou was also a little surprised. Unexpectedly Xiao Heng was not simply interested in Su Miaomiao, but wanted to ask for marriage.\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes, waiting for Su Miaomiao\u2019s answer.\nSu Miaomiao finally stopped thinking about the red ears, took a look at Xiao Heng, and directly refused, \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry you.\u201d\nXiao Heng\u2019s blushing face suddenly turned pale.\nSu Miaomiao ignored him and was about to get in the carriage, but Xiao Heng blurted out, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to marry me?\u201d\nOf course, Su Miaomiao had many reasons.\nFirst, a demon had a different path. If she married Xiao Heng, she may be punished by heaven.\nSecond, even if she would not be punished and she could really marry, she only wanted to marry the Taoist master.\nThinking so, Su Miaomiao looked at Xie Jingyuan.\nAfter looking at each other, Xie Jingyuan quickly lowered his eyes.\nXu Shou and Gu Jialing\u2019s attention was focused on Xiao Heng, a silly Taoist master who actually liked the cat. So they naturally didn\u2019t notice the eye contact between their Taoist master and the cat.\nXiao Heng saw it clearly. Since Su Miaomiao already had her own crush and didn\u2019t care about his background and financial resources at all, he could only accept it.\nFrustrated in love, Xiao Heng turned and left silently.\nThe group of four got into the carriage one after another.\nXu Shou was driving the carriage outside, and inside, Gu Jialing tutted at Su Miaomiao, \u201cThere is actually a Taoist master who wants to marry you, but he is just bewitched by your beauty. If he knows that you are lazy, greedy, cunning and overbearing, he will never like you again.\u201d\nThe few words he used were full of derogatory meanings in people\u2019s eyes, but Su Miaomiao was such a cat. So she didn\u2019t feel offended, and just looked at Xie Jingyuan with a smile.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nJust when he was worried that Su Miaomiao would say something inappropriate in front of Gu Jialing, she reached out to him and said, \u201cTaoist Master, you can give me my ten thousand taels of silver now.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan gave Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing ten thousand taels of silver each, and Xu Shou\u2019s share was reserved for Qingxu Temple because he refused to take it.\nIn addition to money, Xie Jingyuan also had to fulfill his promise to give the three demons a gift each to show his gratitude.\nSo, they passed by another bustling county town on their way, and the group of four went for a stroll in it.\nThere was a store specializing in the sale of furniture in the city where Gu Jialing saw the legendary Babu bed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bed, it\u2019s like a house.\u201d\nGu Jialing circled around the Babu bed, wishing to buy it right away and bring it back to Qingxu Temple.\nSu Miaomiao was not very satisfied with that Babu bed, because it was not made of Jichimu wood, and there were no precious stones on it.\nSince she didn\u2019t like it, Gu Jialing also gave up that Babu bed in order to prove that his vision was equally high.\nXie Jingyuan drew the structure of the Babu bed, and suggested, \u201cWe can buy wood and I\u2019ll make a small bed for you each, and the money saved can be used to buy gems.\u201d\nXu Shou felt that the kennel that the Taoist master made for him was already very good, and he refused to let the Taoist master spend any more money.\nBut the gratitude gift still needed to be prepared. So when Su Miaomiao and Gu Jialing ran into the jewelry store to pick gems, Xie Jingyuan also picked out a box of high-quality black pearls for Xu Shou.\n\u201cYou keep it aside first, and I\u2019ll help you embed it when we get back.\u201d\nXu Shou took the pearl box with both hands, and tears appeared faintly in his black eyes.\nGu Jialing came over, looked at his black pearls, and said with disgust, \u201cThey are too ugly.\u201d\nXu Shou was satisfied. He liked black, black looked the best, and the Taoist master was also very discerning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Her figure was enchanting, and her beauty was even rarer in the world.\nWhen the beauty in the white dress walked within a hundred steps, Xu Shou suddenly raised his head. When he saw the person coming, Xu Shou\u2019s hair stood up vigilantly. He knew that the other party\u2019s cultivation level was far higher than his own, but he still stood in front. At the same time, Gu Jialing, who was awakened by the smell of the demon, flew out of the carriage in a panic, and hid behind Xie Jingyuan.\nSu Miaomiao also woke up, huddled in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms, staring at the visitor with her blue eyes in fear..\nXie Jingyuan said indifferently, \u201cAn eight-hundred-year-old cat demon.\u201d\nWhen he said that, Gu Jialing was no longer afraid. Xu Shou\u2019s upside-down dog hair also fell down, and Su Miaomiao heaved a sigh of relief.\nXie Jingyuan could see the cultivation base of the other party, but the eight hundred year old cat beauty couldn\u2019t see the depth of his cultivation base.\nThe cat demon\u2019s lair was in the nearby mountains and forests, and she usually hid in her lair to practice, or she went out to pick up mortal men.\nThe four passed by there before, and it happened that the cat was not there. That time, the cat came back. After the practice, she felt the smell of one person and three demons, and so she went to find him.\nSince she liked picking up men, she naturally liked handsome people like Xie Jingyuan, and then she made the same mistake like Su Miaomiao back then. Seeing that Xie Jingyuan was young, she thought that this Taoist master wouldn\u2019t have much experience.\nEven if Xu Shou and the two demons were there, the demon only thought that Xie Jingyuan could subdue the three or four hundred year old demons, but he was not her opponent.\n\u201cTaoist Master, you\u2019re so powerful to have been able to catch three demons to follow you at such a young age,\u201d the demon said to Xie Jingyuan with a coquettish smile.\nXie Jingyuan instructed Xu Shou and Gu Jialing, \u201cGo and fight her first.\u201d\nGu Jialing yelled, \u201cHow can I beat her?\u201d\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Xu Shou said.\nAs he said that, he had already grabbed Gu Jialing and threw him at the demon.\nXu Shou also rushed toward her.\nWith a dog with a cultivation base of about three hundred years, and a bird with a cultivation base of more than two hundred years, although they were not her opponent, they wouldn\u2019t be defeated by a single move if they worked together.\nThe demon was contemptuous of them, and did not go all out. While fighting back, she continued to tease Xie Jingyuan, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this? Since you like the little girl in your arms, why don\u2019t you like me? In terms of cultivation and beauty, am I not better than her?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was so domineering in front of Gu Jialing, but facing such a situation, she didn\u2019t say a word.\nIt was difficult for ordinary people to see the real body of the eight-hundred-year-old demon, but Su Miaomiao could see the real shape of the cat clearly at a glance.\nLike her, that eight-hundred-year-old demon was also a white cat, except for a pair of amber-like eyes. Her fur was longer than hers, including the tail.\nHer head was rounder than hers, and the whiskers around her mouth seemed to curve more beautifully.\nHer body was several times bigger than hers, and the four legs appeared to be more slender.\nAs a cat, she was not as good as her in those aspects, but it meant that she was not as good-looking as her. Su Miaomiao believed that when she reached her age, she would definitely compare with her.\nBut the most important thing at that moment was what the Taoist master thought.\nSu Miaomiao raised her head apprehensively. She was very worried that the Taoist master would abandon her on seeing a more beautiful cat.\nHer blue eyes were so clear, so Xie Jingyuan could tell at a glance what she was thinking.\nHe touched Su Miaomiao\u2019s cat\u2019s head, and the next moment, the long sword came out of its sheath from behind, and flew toward the eight-hundred-year-old demon.\nSince the Taoist master made a move, Xu Shou and Gu Jialing voluntarily withdrew from the battle.\nSensing Xie Jingyuan\u2019s sword energy, the demon finally realized that he was a powerful Taoist master, immediately put away her contempt, and responded with all her strength.\nBefore the battle that happened in Qingxu Temple, Xie Jingyuan\u2019s cultivation base was enough to kill a thousand-year-old demon. After the battle, although he was seriously injured, his cultivation base broke through the previous bottleneck and improved to a higher level.\nThe long sword was wrapped in a golden light, and galloped like a shooting star in the night. The demon tried her best to dodge several times, but finally couldn\u2019t deal with one of them. She was stabbed in the shoulder by the long sword, and fell to the ground from mid-air, turning into a huge white cat that was bigger than Xu Shou\u2019s original shape.\nGu Jialing was trembling, and couldn\u2019t help laughing at the other party, \u201cLook at your big body, how can you look better than Su Miaomiao? Birds will be scared to death when they see you!\u201d\nThe demon vomited blood, and because she couldn\u2019t escape, she could only raise her head. She looked at Xie Jingyuan in fear, and then stared at Su Miaomiao with jealousy, \u201cThis is so unfair, I am obviously more beautiful than her, you stinky Taoist master, why don\u2019t you want to be with me but her\u2026\u201d\nBefore she uttered more nonsense, Xie Jingyuan controlled the long sword and pierced the opponent\u2019s core.\nThe demon lowered her head and died completely.\nXie Jingyuan retracted the sword, cleaned it with spells, and put it back in its sheath.\nGu Jialing flew to the demon, and felt sorry for the core that was so broken into pieces, so he said, \u201cTaoist Master, the cores are good for us, can you keep it next time?\u201d\nXu Shou said, \u201cThe Taoist master said that taking the core is tantamount to counterproductive growth. Even if someone offered to give me the core, I wouldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\nAfter Gu Jialing looked at him in disbelief, Xie Jingyuan only said, \u201cFind a place and bury it.\u201d\nWhen Gu Jialing heard that he had to work, he quickly flew back to the carriage and continued to sleep.\nXu Shou took away the demon\u2019s body and found a place to bury it.\nXie Jingyuan looked into his arms. Feeling his movements, Su Miaomiao also raised her head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That demon is full of turbidity and has killed countless people. How can I keep her alive?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nodded, rested her chin on his lap, then she looked up again after a while, and asked, \u201cIf she was as harmless as me, would you take her in?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? She looks so good-looking.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nWhen Su Miaomiao thought he didn\u2019t know how to judge the cat\u2019s appearance, she analyzed it for him one by one, \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand her cat form, look at her human figure, her lips are redder than mine, and her breasts are bigger than mine\u2026\u201d\nXie Jingyuan closed his eyes and interrupted her, \u201cSee no evil, I never pay attention to these things.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao flicked her tail and wanted to say something more, but Xie Jingyuan suddenly said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take in another cat other than you.\u201d\nBesides her, he would not take in any banshees.\nSu Miaomiao couldn\u2019t hear what was in his heart, but what he said was enough to make her happy.\nThe happy Su Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help but raise her front paws to touch his chest, then raised her head to lick his chin.\nXie Jingyuan pushed her down with one hand, and moved his eyes to the carriage.\nFortunately, Gu Jialing was not as curious as Su Miaomiao, so he got into the carriage and fell asleep.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this again in the future,\u201d Xie Jingyuan demanded seriously.\nSu Miaomiao blinked and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d\nCats liked to lick each other\u2019s fur.\nXie Jingyuan turned his eyes away and replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao began to think, was she licking in the wrong way, or did her tongue accidentally touch the Taoist master? It shouldn\u2019t be, she was obviously very careful to lick with the tip of her tongue.\nAt that time, Su Miaomiao thought of the men and women in the brothel.\nThose men seemed to like to let women kiss them.\nSu Miaomiao turned into a human form, and before Xie Jingyuan could react, she hugged his head and clumsily kissed his neck.\nXie Jingyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow about this, do you like it?\u201d After kissing, Su Miaomiao asked seriously.\nXie Jingyuan looked at her ignorant face, paused, and shot.\nSu Miaomiao, who turned into a cat again, suddenly became a lot shorter.\n\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d Xie Jingyuan rubbed her cat\u2019s head absently, not allowing her to mess around anymore.\nSu Miaomiao hummed and went to sleep obediently.\nAfter a while, Xu Shou came back, and saw the Taoist master sitting on the ground from a distance, looking intently in his direction.\nWas the Taoist master worried about him, so he didn\u2019t practice?\n\u201cTaoist Master, it has been buried, and I promise it will not be discovered by the common people,\u201d Xu Shou reported in a low voice.\nXie Jingyuan nodded.\nSu Miaomiao lazily opened her eyes, and proudly showed off to Xu Shou, \u201cThe Taoist master said that he will not take in other cats.\u201d\nXu Shou fully understood the Taoist master\u2019s decision.\nIt costs so much to raise a cat, so how could Qingxu Temple afford another cat?\nIn late May, Xie Jingyuan took the three demons out for a month, and finally returned to Qingxu Temple.\nThe courtyard walls of Qingxu Temple that were damaged during the battle had been repaired, and of course, only a few copper plates were left of the dozen taels of silver in the temple.\n\u201cHow much did you sell them for?\u201d Senior Sun looked at Xie Jingyuan expectantly.\nThe Taoist masters of Qingxu Temple were not greedy for money, but they also had expenses like food and clothes, and they didn\u2019t have any savings.\nWhen Senior Sun saw the amount, his face flushed with excitement, and his body shook.\nAlthough he was quite old, he usually lived away from people and rarely cared about the price of high-quality furs, he thought that the fur of a nine-tailed fox could be sold for a few thousand taels at most.\nXie Jingyuan took out another bag of silver and explained, \u201cActually, it sold for sixty thousands taels, and I divided some with Xu Shou and the others. After all, they made great contributions in protecting the temple that day.\u201d\nSenior Sun held a huge sum of thirty thousand taels in his hand, which was enough to spend for several generations. He didn\u2019t care about the rest that were distributed, so he couldn\u2019t help but laugh, while nodding repeatedly, \u201cIt should be. Although the three of them are demons, they are dedicated to doing good. It is not an exaggeration to say that they are the guardian spirits of the temple.\u201d\nSome temples in the world wanted to kill all the demons, while others were willing to let the kind demons go.\nQingxu Temple had been adhering to a benevolent heart since the patriarch\u2019s time. It had been passed down for hundreds of years, and the Taoist masters in the temple still maintained different treatment for different demons.\u00a0\nAfter learning about the situation during the month, there was nothing he needed to worry about, so Xie Jingyuan went back to his room.\nThe three demons had all returned to their original form. Xu Shou liked to observe the pilgrims coming and going to distinguish between good and evil. Gu Jialing flew to the old tree in front of the main hall and showed his feathers to the pilgrims who missed his beauty.\nSu Miaomiao was not happy, so she slipped into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room.\nXie Jingyuan sat at the desk which was covered with pens, ink, paper and inkstones.\nShe jumped onto the table and asked, \u201cWhat are you drawing?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan glanced at her and said, \u201cBabu bed.\u201d\nThe Taoist master\u2019s hands were beautiful, and his drawing skills were also good, but Su Miaomiao was not an elegant cat in her bones, she fell asleep after watching for a long time, raised her paw, and curled up in a ball on his lap.\nOne drew, the other slept, and gradually only the regular purring of a cat remained in the room.\nIn the evening, all the pilgrims went down the mountain, and Xie Jingyuan finished painting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "240": "https://wordrain69.com/manga/taoist-master-and-the-cat/chapter-240/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe drew a miniature Babu bed for Su Miaomiao with birds, butterflies, swimming fish, and flowers on the bed frame, and made the patterns to be embellished with gems.\nWhat he drew for Gu Jialing was an improved version of a bird\u2019s-nest-shaped stepping bed, which was divided into two layers.\nSince Xu Shou was very satisfied with the kennel he lived in, Xie Jingyuan kept the kennel as it was and only added carvings.\n\u201cWhy do I feel that each of these three pictures is more perfunctory than the other?\u201d\nGu Jialing carefully compared the three pictures. No matter how he looked at it, he felt that Su Miaomiao\u2019s Babu bed was the most delicately drawn, as the butterflies and swimming fish were all drawn lifelike.\nXie Jingyuan said, \u201cYour nest is hung on a tree, and pilgrims can see it when they come and go, so it shouldn\u2019t be too extravagant outside.\u201d\nXu Sho agreed with him, \u201cYes, if gems were exposed outside, there would be pilgrims climbing up to steal them.\u201d\nPeople couldn\u2019t withstand the temptation of the gems that were at their fingertips.\nThat made sense, and Gu Jialing reluctantly accepted it. In addition, although his nest wasn\u2019t the most exquisite, it wasn\u2019t the ugliest either. It was prettier than Xu Shou\u2019s kennel anyway.\n\u201cEarly tomorrow morning, you follow me to the back of the mountain, I have something to say, \u201cXie Jingyuan said to Xu Shou and Gu Jialing while looking outside the window..\nGu Jialing asked, \u201cWhat can\u2019t be said here?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao nestled in Xie Jingyuan\u2019s arms and raised her head curiously.\nXie Jingyuan patted her head, and revealed in advance, \u201cThe two of you have taken a demon\u2019s core, and your cultivation base has greatly increased, but your foundation is not stable. I will teach you the method of strengthening your foundation tomorrow morning.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan simply washed up, sat on the bed and prepared to meditate, while Su Miaomiao was lying on his lap, staring at his face.\nHe hadn\u2019t settled down yet, felt her gaze, and asked, \u201cDo you have something on your mind?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao had something on her mind, but she was still not very happy.\nShe wanted to hug the Taoist master and say it, but her legs were not long enough, so there was no other way. Su Miaomiao turned into a human again, wrapped her arms around his neck skillfully, and rested her head on his shoulder.\n\u201cTaoist Master, you are so talented, will you ascend to immortality like the patriarch?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan lowered his eyes, and said, \u201cIt depends on my good fortune, I could become immortal if I want to.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao hugged him even tighter and said, \u201cIf you become immortal, what should I do? Xu Shou and the bird have higher cultivation bases than me, so they might ascend with you, but I can\u2019t.\u201d\nThe difference of one or two hundred years in cultivation was not something she could catch up with casually.\nHe wanted to touch her head, but he raised his hand, and suddenly remembered that she was not in a cat form.\nAfter putting down his hand, Xie Jingyuan said in a low voice, \u201cIf there is a day, I will take you to soar together, if the law of heaven does not allow, I will stay in the world to accompany you.\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was very happy. She always believed in what the Taoist master said.\nEarly the next morning, Xie Jingyuan took Xu Shou and Gu Jialing to the back mountain. Asfor Su Miaomiao, she squatted on his shoulder and followed to watch the excitement.\nThere was no shortcut to cultivate. Xu Shou and Gu Jialing absorbed the core, so they had to pay more to make up for that opportunistic trick.\n\u201cFrom now on, you will live in the back mountain, keep your human form every day, and you cannot change at will.\u201d\n\u201cRun for an hour every day from dawn, rest for half an hour in the morning, climb the mountain after breakfast, and go back and forth from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain a hundred times. Rest for half an hour at noon, fight with each other in the afternoon, and run for another hour. In the evening, following the mantras I imparted in meditation until dawn, so in three years, your foundation can be solidified.\u201d\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Gu Jialing slumped on the ground.\nXu Shou was as calm and stable as ever, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Taoist Master. We will practice hard and will never disappoint your painstaking efforts.\u201d\nGu Jialing\u2019s eyes moved wildly, and before he could speak, Xie Jingyuan said coldly, \u201cIf you find it hard, you can leave now, but if you leave today, don\u2019t even think about relying on Qingxu Temple in the future.\u201d\nGu Jialing looked at him, then at Su Miaomiao, who was gloating, and Xu Shou, who was solemn, and suddenly fell to the ground and burst into tears.\nIf the Taoist master had tortured him like that when he first came to Qingxu Temple, Gu Jialing would definitely run away.\nBut he had lived in Qingxu for so long, and he was so familiar with him, the cat and the dog, and so was uncomfortable to let go.\nXu Shou said with distaste, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to cry about. The Taoist master is doing this for our own good. How can you cultivate if your foundation is not stable?\u201d\nGu Jialing understood the truth, but he just felt that the future was bleak, and said, \u201cDo we have to practice hard every day for three years?\u201d\nXie Jingyuan paused, and then said, \u201cYou can go back to the temple to rest at the end of every month.\u201d\nGu Jialing seemed to see a ray of light in the dark clouds.\n\u201cOkay, but the day we go back, the Taoist master will prepare something delicious for us.\u201d\nXie Jingyuan agreed.\n\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Before he made his second request, Xie Jingyuan turned around and left without looking back, only Su Miaomiao tilted her head with her face full of gloating.\nGu Jialing shouted furiously, \u201cYou wait for me!\u201d\nSu Miaomiao also turned her head, only wagging her tail at him happily.\nThe two demons practiced hard, and Xie Jingyuan also asked Su Miaomiao about her training progress when building the Babu bed, and gave her some pointers.\nWhen it came to cultivation, Su Miaomiao listened very carefully, but when watching Xie Jingyuan tinkering with a pile of wood every day, she occasionally found it boring.\u00a0\nShe started running to the back of the mountain, and watched Gu Jialing being threatened by Xu Shou to insist on running or climbing the mountain, or being beaten up by Xu Shou during sparring.\u00a0\nIn the first few days, Xie Jingyuan would deliberately go to the back of the mountain to look for her, but after confirming that Su Miaomiao would not leave the area of \u200b\u200bQingxu Temple and go to other places, he let her run around with confidence.\nOf course, no matter how Su Miaomiao ran during the day, every time the sun went down, she would return to Qingxu Temple and sneak into Xie Jingyuan\u2019s room.\nThat morning, Su Miaomiao came to see her two companions again, and climbed the mountain with them on a whim.\n\u201cThis mountain is not high, it\u2019s easy to climb up!\u201d At the top of the mountain, Su Miaomiao squinted her eyes comfortably, enjoying the mountain wind blowing her fur.\nBoth Xu Shou and Gu Jialing were human, Xu Shou looked at Qingxu Temple at the foot of the mountain, while Gu Jialing who was laying on the ground on his back said bitterly, \u201cOf course it won\u2019t be tiring to run once, why don\u2019t you try running a hundred times?\u201d\nSu Miaomiao was not so free, so she followed them down the mountain, and then slipped away.\nThere was still a long mountain road from the place where they practiced to Qingxu Temple.\nSu Miaomiao wandered happily. Suddenly, a few human voices came from ahead, Su Miaomiao got curious, and she approached quietly while lurking in the grass.\nAs she got closer, she saw Xuan Cheng and a girl with almond eyes and peach cheeks standing under an old tree in front of him.\nSu Miaomiao recognized the girl. The hairpin that Xuan Cheng kept privately was given by that girl. Of course, she had stolen the hairpin a long time ago, and Xuan Cheng didn\u2019t dare to say anything.\n\u201cDo you really not like me?\u201d The girl glared at Xuan Cheng with tears in her almond eyes.\nXuan Cheng avoided her gaze, lowered his head and said, \u201cQingxu Temple has its own rules, and this poor Taoist dare not violate them.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to go against the rules. I just asked you if you like me or not. If you like me, I will never marry for the rest of my life. If you don\u2019t have me in your heart, then I will find someone to marry when I go back, lest my parents, brother and sister-in-law worry about me.\u201d\nXuan Cheng turned his back to her and said, \u201cYoung lady, you\u2019re already old enough to marry if you meet the right one.\u201d\nHis tone was so flat that the girl burst into tears.\nHowever, Su Miaomiao saw that Xuan Cheng also shed tears.\nShe didn\u2019t understand love in the world, but she had seen Xuan Cheng tossing and turning in the night holding the hairpin. She had also seen him walking toward her, as if he wanted to get the hairpin back, but changed his mind temporarily, with a complicated look on his face.\u00a0\nXuan Cheng actually liked this girl, right? Would he be willing to let her marry someone else?\nThey obviously like each other, so why say something against their will?\nSu Miaomiao rummaged through her personal treasure.\nEach demon had a similar space where they could put their collection.\nXuan Cheng\u2019s hairpin was under Su Miaomiao\u2019s newly bought jewelry, and when she took out the hairpin, the girl had already walked a few steps.\nSu Miaomiao hurriedly used a spell to throw the hairpin to Xuan Cheng\u2019s feet, and deliberately let the hairpin hit a small stone, making a crisp sound.\nHearing the sound, Xuan Cheng looked at his feet, and the girl also looked back.\nXuan Cheng was startled when he recognized the hairpin, and raised his head subconsciously, only to see a white cat sticking her head out from the grass. She seemed to smile at him, and then ran away in a hurry.\nXuan Cheng went stiff all over.\nThe white cat indeed stole the hairpin in the temple, but she never returned it. What did she mean by returning it then?\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you lost it, why is it still there?\u201d The little girl smiled through tears, ran over to pick up the hairpin first, and then interrogated Xuan Cheng with tears in her eyes.\n\u201cI knew you liked me too!\u201d\nThe little girl rushed over and hugged the sweetheart who had saved her life tightly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
